This development is often associated with Salvador Dal?, one of the most acute theoreticians of the Surrealist Object and, for a while, their creator par excellence. That Dal?, who channeled in the late 1930s a substantial amount of energy into advertisement, d?cor, and haute couture, is commonly held to be the worst offender in this respect is indubitably due to his growing estrangement in these years from the surrealist group, culminating in his defiant and enthusiastic adoption of Breton's anagrammatic rendering of his name as "Avida Dollars." However, the peripeteia befalling Dali's preoccupation with the object offer their own particular twists and complexities. Thus, in terms of the actual production of objects, Dal? turns out to be only moderately prolific, considering the place the object occupies in his theoretical writings. Indeed, his efforts in this respect become more intensive only around the mid-1930s, when his theoretical interest in the object seems already at a low ebb. These productions are generally viewed as yet another selling-out typical on the part of Dali in those years; yet they also may be seen largely as realizations of ideas underlying Dali's most advanced notions regarding the "thingness" of human beings and the "beingness" of objects or "machines." Furthermore, the dynamics informing these works both are the mark of a frustration stemming from the very nature of the ambition expressed by theoretical and other writings that spelled out Dali's vision vis-?-vis the world of objects, and also derive from the shortcomings of the objects themselves that Dal? created with the intention of fulfilling that ambition. This view does not contradict the general perception of the growing commercialization of Dali's art in the The Surrealist Object existed at the nexus of the mainstreams of surrealist thought and activity in the period leading up to, and even beyond, the Second World War. Proposing in 1924 the creation and circulation of "dream objects," Breton envisaged their potential for discrediting the "creatures and things of 'reason,'" and extending the "limits of so-called reality."1 This was seen primarily as an extension of the poetic project intended to raise man above the "paucity of reality" (le peu de r?alit?). Thus, if poetry?or "po?sie-activit? de l'esprit," to use the term coined by Tristan Tzara2?was to achieve its aim of transforming man and the world, it had to invade reality and permeate life. Three dimensional and comprised mostly of "found" materials, the Surrealist Object offered in its tangible character the most cogent and immediate form of poetic activity to satisfy this demand. As a concretized expression of elusive sensations related to perversion, it occupied a central position in surrealist sexual politics as an agent of sexual subversion. In its blatantly anti-aesthetic stance, it may also be viewed, along Marxist lines, as serving meaningful social action by undermining the "status of the bourgeois commodity object."3 However provocative, impertinent, and aggressively "anti-artistic" these objects may have been in the 1930s, especially in the latter half of the decade, they became quite fashionable and were wholeheartedly embraced by the same bourgeois consumers whom they were supposed to befuddle and enrage.4 Witty and 1.

Spector, "The avant-garde object: Form and fetish between World War I and World War II," RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics 12 (Autumn 1986): 132. Spector offers a primarily Marxist reading of the history of the avant-garde object, which presents a view of the early manifestations of the object in surrealism, relative to the deepening political commitment of the surrealists in the mid 1920s, as an effort to disturb the "commodity-fetish character of the artwork" (p. 131) by turning the Surrealist Object into a sexually aggressive thing, brazenly displaying "useless and disagreeable things that had no place in galleries beside 'good art'" (p. 135). 4. Analyzing the social and political undercurrents affecting the Surrealist Object, Spector argues that it was largely the surrealists' disillusionment with "the reality of Soviet Communism as a model for their libertarian ideals" that brought them to "emphasize the fantastic, even occult aspect of their productions and to reinterpret their fetish objects as works of bizarre but fashionably ?patant modernism: they began to sell well . . ."

As revealed in Dali's writings concerning the object, this pattern involves a perception of failure that is already inherent in his new theoretical formulation, to be followed by his attempt to rechannel his ambitions regarding the object in a different direction altogether. This development, in its broad outline, comprises a movement from the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique through the "cannibalisme des objets," to the perception of the failure of the Surrealist Object implied by the notions underlying the "objets psycho-atmosph?riques-anamorphiques," and on to the development of the alternate concept of the "beings-objects." The Surrealist Object circa 1930 The objets ? fonctionnement symbolique, to judge by most accounts of surrealist art, appear to be a landmark in the history of the Surrealist Object. Introducing these objects under the label "objets surr?alistes," Dal? meant this activity to be associated with a term that had been in use for quite some time.5 As early as March 1929, Dali himself, in a survey of "anti-artistic" trends published in L'Amie de les Arts, refers to "those already created and defined Surrealist Objects" (Oui 1 102).6 If the Surrealist Object was indeed a well-established concept and category of creative activity, as Dali's words seem to imply, what were those objects to which the appellation "surrealist" had been previously applied? Speculations concerning the ancestry of the Surrealist Object point, naturally enough, primarily to Duchamp's readymades and to various types of dada objects. Indeed, enumerating in his essay "Crise de l'objet" (1936) the various measures taken to bring about a "total revolution of the object," Breton starts off with Duchamp's readymades. The readymade's chief attraction lay for Breton and his friends in the notion of "change of role" as applying to the activity of transforming a commonplace object and helping it achieve a "separate identity."7 The appeal of the readymade could also have derived from the immediacy of a found object, involving no sculptural or aesthetic considerations and based, as Duchamp argues, on the "total absence of good or bad taste."8 In a lecture given in 1922 at the Barcelona Ateneo, Breton chose to illustrate his comments on Duchamp with the object Why Not Sneeze Rose S?lavy? (1921), an "assisted readymade" comprising a bird cage half full of marble blocks in the shape of sugar lumps, among which is thrust a thermometer (fig. 1). What Breton chooses to emphasize regarding this object, the only readymade he mentions in his writing until the publication in 1935 of his comprehensive essay on Duchamp's work, is the disorienting effect of the unexpected weight of the marble blocks (a quality that, indeed, brings this object closer to the surrealist orbit).9 Figure 1.

ADAGP Paris 1992. 5. Dal? published his first sustained theoretical contribution to the subject in an essay entitled "Objets surr?alistes," which appeared in the third issue of Le Surr?alisme au service de la R?volution (1931). 6. We can also note in this respect a cryptic remark found in his "Documental-Paris 1929" (pub. May 1929), reporting that "in Desnos's bedroom, next to a ball by de Chirico where it snows (Surrealist Object), there is a starfish suspended in alcohol (the one from the film L'?toile de mer)" (Oui 1, p. 138).

Those were the objets trouv?s or the objets insolites. Bizarre encounters with these objects during the course of the early 1920s are amply documented by Breton in Nadja (1928). The first book in his "Trilogie surr?aliste," Nadja is an account of Breton's search for surreality in the urban landscape of Paris. It is a narrative of "daily marvels" and hallucinatory revelations, punctuated with encounters with "l'Objet insolite" which, as an "irregular, white half-cylinder covered with reliefs and depressions without significance for me" (Nadja 59), is encountered in the march? aux puces, or presented, as the enigmatic bronze glove, at the "Centrale surr?aliste" (64). The "special, indefinable reaction at the sight of extremely rare objects" (20) that Breton experiences while encountering these "outmoded, fragmented, useless, almost incomprehensible, in a word perverse" objects (59) is similar to his reaction to the arrangements of certain objects in de Chirico's paintings.10 There are no further references to objects in Nadja other than, perhaps, the reproductions of two primitive art objects, to which Breton refers only in terms of Nadja's quite idiosyncratic reaction to them. Those, of course, are not Surrealist Objects; however, enthusiastically collected by the surrealists and shown in a few exhibitions at the Galerie Surr?aliste (1926, 1927), they may have been considered a subspecies of the Surrealist Object. The surrealists' response to these objects was far from ethnographic and quite subjective. Indeed, there were more primitive objects reproduced in La R?volution Surr?aliste than any other kind of object. Another subspecies is the art of the insane, and one should remember the two metal and wood constructions made by a schizophrenic (reproduced in the twelfth issue of La R?volution Surr?aliste, 1929) that were acquired by Breton in a show of art by the insane in 1929. The "objets insolites" in Nadja are not made objects but, rather, found objects. Indeed, there is hardly any concrete documentation regarding the actual production of objects in the course of the 1920s.11 In the twelve issues of La R?volution Surr?aliste (1924-1930), one finds only a few examples of this activity. A notable exception is Man Ray's wrapped-up object (presumably a sewing machine) entitled L'?nigme d'Isidore Ducasse (1920), which is shown in a photograph by Man Ray (no. 1, 1924).12 The only other object that appears close to the later conception of the Surrealist Object is a box by Breton and Aragon entitled Ci-g?t Giorgio de Chirico (La R?volution Surr?aliste, no. 11, 1928), containing a sewing machine and a model of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.13 Dal?, who since 1928 closely followed current as well as earlier manifestations of the object in surrealism, stands witness in his writings to this scarcity of actually realized objects. Thus it would be worthwhile to mentions by name in Entretiens (1913-1952), Nouvelle ?dition revue et corrig?e (Paris: Editions Gallimard, 1969), p. 161, and it should remind us of the woman's glove made of bronze, which has a similar disorienting effect on Breton in Nadja, Edition enti?rement revue par l'auteur (Paris: Editions Gallimard, 1964), p. 64. Breton mentions, in the same lecture, Picasso's metal and paper constructions, referring to the analogous results achieved by Man Ray's photographs, but at that time (in 1922) he still makes no mention of Man Ray's dada objects, although those were somewhat more entrenched in the surrealist consciousness than were the readymades. 10. It is interesting to note the resemblance between Breton's strange half-cylinder and several cryptic objects found in de Chirico's paintings, such as Evil Genius of a King (1914) or The Sailors' Barracks. The only de Chirico painting illustrating Nadja (p. 149) has a glove as its central motif. For a more detailed discussion of these relationships, see Haim Finkelstein, Surrealism and the Crisis of the Object, chaps. 1 and 2. 11. If there was any extensive production of Surrealist Objects in the 1920s, Breton, too, appears to have been oblivious to it. In a short survey of the types of objects leading up to the Surrealist Object of the 1930s presented by Breton in Entretiens, Breton names only Duchamp's readymades, Breton's own objet insolite of Ulntroduction au discours sur le peu de r?alit? (see below), Giacometti's constructions of 1930, and Dali's symbolically functioning objects. Had other objects been made, Breton would have mentioned their existence. With regard to his own dream-objects, Breton notes his proposal to realize such objects and cites as an only example "le livre que je d?cris [emphasis mine] dans Ulntroduction au discours sur le peu de r?alit?." Breton also appears to designate the early 1930s as the moment in which many surrealist objects saw the light of day (pp. 161-162). 12. This is Man Ray's witty comment on Lautr?amont's evocation of beauty in terms of "la rencontre fortuite sur une table de dissection d'une machine ? coudre et d'un parapluie!" (the fortuitous encounter on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella). See Isidore Ducasse (Comte de Lautr?amont), Oeuvres Compl?tes (Paris: Librairie Jos? Corti, 1969), p. 327. A close friend and associate of Duchamp's since 1915, Man Ray, in his objects, came closer to the conception underlying the humorous objects that were to predominate in the 1936 Exposition surr?aliste d'objets. One should note in this respect Man Ray's Cadeau (1921), a flat-iron bristling with nails, or Emak Bakia (1927), an object consisting of the neck of a violin covered with a long lock of blond hair. 13. Having associated de Chirico in Les pas perdus (94) with Lautr?amont and with the sewing machine of the latter's famous aphorism, Breton may have counterpoised in this object the sewing machine, to which he alludes at times as a feminine symbol, with the phallic Leaning Tower of Pisa, possibly as a comment on de Chirico's dwindling virility.</page><page sequence="5">118 RES 23 SPRING 1993 consider an article he wrote in 1932, not long before Breton's Les Vases communicants came off the press, in which he presents his own version of surrealist theory regarding the object. In "The Object as Revealed in Surrealist Experiment,"14 Dal? attempted to present himself in the role of a sober historian of the surrealist movement, and to appear a faithful adherent of current surrealist doctrine and a follower of Breton. Although Dal? generally is not loath to revise history to further his own aims, in the present case his whole purpose was to legitimize his own activities vis-?-vis the object by introducing, as an early "nocturnal or subterranean phase," the already mentioned precedents (from Duchamp, Man Ray, and Breton) found within the movement. Dali also appears to place objects, or arrangements of objects, such as the T-squares and biscuits found in de Chirico's Metaphysical Interiors, on an equal footing with the actual objects described or reproduced in print (Surrealists on Art 88-89). However, besides these ?examples, there is no other reference to an actual production of objects conceived along surrealist lines until he gets to his own objets ? fonctionnement symbolique. In this essay, the only development that Dal? considers a true landmark in the history of the object is Breton's proposal for the creation of dream objects found in his "Introduction au discours sur le peu de r?alit?."15 Having referred to it also as the "most lucid and prophetic moment in Surrealism" (Oui 2 13), Dal? introduces, in "The Object as Revealed in Surrealist Experiment," a lengthy quotation from Breton's text to illustrate how this proposal gets the object "out of the dark and into the light" (89). The book that Breton, in his dream, encounters in an open-air market near Saint Malo (Point du jour 24)?its back in the shape of a wooden gnome with an Assyrian-style beard down to his feet, its pages made of thick black wool?is essentially no different from any real-life object. What places it in an entirely different position is its having been "invented" by Breton in his dream. Dal? is attracted primarily by Breton's proposal to re-create this object and put it in circulation. This concrete manifestation of the dream-object may answer man's continuous fetishistic "d?sir de v?rification," which amounts to man's need for an objectification of certain subjective phenomena, whether dreams or any other psychic phenomena, or even the poetic process itself. This ambition, which underlies much of what Dali proposed in his theoretical writings, ever since he had hauntingly presented it in his early prose poem "Sant Sebasti?" (1927), is of primary importance to his evolving concept of the Surrealist Object. As shall be seen, another important notion concerning the actual realization of the object, which Breton's text seems to imply for Dal?, is the use of materials found by chance, such as those that one can find in an open-air flea market, rather than resorting to the use of sculptural means. Objets ? fonctionnement symbolique Thus when Dal? began conceiving the notion of the Surrealist Object, he could only fall back on the very few examples of this activity that have been noted above. Even Breton's objets oniriques were still just a proposal, albeit one that proved to be more fecund and lasting for Dal? than most. Breton envisaged the effect of his proposed dream-objects in terms of a discrediting of "reasonable" beings and objects that would demolish the "detestable concrete trophies" that encumber man's life (Point du jour 24). What Breton's text remained oblivious to at that point was the erotic dimension. It was the concept of symbolic functioning (fonctionnement symbolique) that was to introduce this dimension, providing Dal? with a mechanism that would animate this new form of expression and help channel his erotic preoccupations. As defined by Dal? in "Objets surr?alistes," the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique, "lending themselves to a minimum of mechanical functioning, are based upon phantasms and representations that are likely to be provoked by the realization of unconscious acts." These acts correspond to "distinctly characterized erotic fantasies and desires," and Dal? argues further that the "incarnation of those desires, their objectifying through substitution and metaphor and their symbolic realization, all constitute a process of sexual perversion, which resembles, in all respects, the process involved in the poetic act" (Oui 1 178). There is no question as to the significance of the impetus given to Dali's conception of symbolic functioning by Giacometti's Suspended Ball 14. Translated by David Gascoyne, the article appeared in This Quarter 5, no. 1 (September 1932): 197-207. References are to Lucy R. Lippard, Surrealists on Art (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1970), pp. 87-96. It is not known whether the original French version of it has survived. 15. Dal? had long been familiar with Breton's proposal, having referred to it before in his 1929 survey of "anti-artistic" trends (Oui 1 102). First published in 1924, the "Discours" was republished separately by Gallimard in 1927. Dal? may have had this edition in mind while writing about Breton's dream objects as a recent trend.</page><page sequence="6">Finkelstein: The incarnation of desire 119 (1930-1931) (fig. 2).16 Dal? in his essay acknowledges his debt to Giacometti and refers to Suspended Ball as having "already set down and brought together all the essential principles of our definition" (Oui 1 178). Indeed, its description in Dali's essay, far more succinct and legible than those devoted to the other objects listed, bears witness to the immediacy and effectiveness with which it communicated these principles: A wooden ball, stamped with a feminine groove, is suspended by a violin string over a crescent the wedge of which merely grazes the cavity. The spectator finds himself instinctively compelled to slide the ball up and down the ridge, but the length of the string does not allow a full contact between the two. Oui 1 179-180 It is also well established that before Giacometti introduced his sculpture to the surrealists, Dal? had very little to show in terms of actual creation of objects.17 Yet, whereas Dal? acknowledged his debt to the conception underlying Giacometti's Suspended Ball, he had not fallen on Giacometti's innovation wholly unprepared. Significantly enough, two instances of an action that is akin to symbolic functioning may be found in two films with which Dali was associated. A symbolic manipulation of objects appears in Dal? and Bu?uel's Un chien andalou (1929) in a sequence showing a woman who, following the fall of a cyclist, unlocks a striped box hung around the cyclist's neck, Figure 2.

See Reinhold Hohl, Alberto Giacometti: Sculpture, Painting, Drawing (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1972); Rosalind E. Krauss, Ihe Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1985). Both Reinhold Hohl (p. 249) and Rosalind Krauss {Originality, p. 57) cite Georges Sadoul: "In 1930 he [Giacometti] introduced a new mode into Surrealism with his sculptures that were mobile objects. This launched the vogue of Surrealist objects with a symbolic or erotic function, the making of which became practically obligatory." Krauss adds in the footnote that the date of Dali's "Objets surr?alistes" (1931) "demonstrates this later attempt to absorb Giacometti's innovative work into the heart of the surrealist movement." 17. The only object by Dal? that might have preceded Giacometti's sculpture is entitled Planche d'associations d?mentielles, or Feux d'artifice. In the Centre Pompidou catalog, it is dated 1930-1931. See Salvador Dali, r?trospective 1920-1980 (18 D?cembre 1979-14 Avril 1980) (Paris: Centre Georges Pompidou, Mus?e national d'Art Moderne, 1979), p. 214. It consists of an embossed tin surface that must have been an advertisement board for fireworks, with what appear to be receptacles for the different types of fireworks offered for sale, with its back painted over by Dali in oil colors. The iconography of some of these miniatured ?mages is derived from his 1929-1930 works (butterflies, sharp-toothed woman, the Great Masturbator, and so on). One of the images, a dark shoe on which is placed a glass of milk, echoes Dali's own objet ? fonctionnement symbolique. However, in the light of the heavy use of 1929-1930 ?mages, my impression is that this object preceded the latter. Dal? may have referred to this particular object in the "general catalog" of different types of objects with which he opens his essay "Objets surr?alistes," where a "Planche d'association" (Board for Association) appears as an example for the category of "Objects machines (experimental fantasies)." At any rate, all other categories and examples listed?for example, the "Transubstantiated objects (affective origin)" illustrated by a soft watch or a watch made of straw, or the "Objects intended for throwing (oneiric origin)" which Dal? considers both in the physical and figurative sense)?should at that point be regarded as mere speculations rather than actual objects. I might add that if the Planche d'associations d?mentielles is indeed the one referred to in the essay, it is quite different from any of Dali's future speculations concerning "objects-machines" or "machines ? penser"; rather, formally it has an obvious antecedent in an object from Breton's collection that was made by a schizophrenic (La R?volution Surr?aliste, no. 12, 1929).</page><page sequence="7">120 RES 23 SPRING 1993 takes out a package wrapped in striped tissue paper and out of this package a striped tie; afterward, she lays the cyclist's frilly cuffs, collar, and striped tie on a bed, "as if an invisible man were wearing them." This action appears to help materialize the cyclist in another corner of the room.18 There is no need to go into the details of the film's quite elaborate symbolism, which has to do with the ambiguity of sexual identity and the inescapable horrors of the fear of castration, to be aware of the symbolic action that such a scene implies. In L'?ge d'or (1930), too, there is a sequence that introduces symbolic functioning, especially as described in the original screenplay, which refers to a hand-cream poster showing a white hand with the wedding-ring finger stuck inside a painted hole. The picture is superimposed onto a shot of a real hand like the one in the poster, with the wedding-ring finger also inside a hole. The screenplay adds: "The movement of the fingers should be extremely disturbing with strong onanistic connotations" (33). These close-ups of fingers may refer back to Dali's Catalan article ". . . L'alliberament dels dits . . ." ("The Liberation of Fingers," L'Amie de les Arts, March 1929), with its illustrations of close-ups of human fingers, as well as to Georges Bataille's "Le gros orteil" ("The Big Toe," Documents, no. 6, 1929), with its accompanying photographs. Dal?, indeed, shared with Giacometti a special predilection for the thought of Georges Bataille. Rosalind Krauss has shown convincingly how Suspended Ball reflects Giacometti's recent initiation into the group that made up the avant-garde magazine Documents, which included Georges Bataille, Michel Leiris, Andr? Masson, and other "dissident" surrealists (Originality 56). In 1929, Dali also was associated for a while with this group and felt close to many of Bataille's ideas.19 Whereas his subsequent political estrangement from Bataille brought him, in his article "L'?ne pourri" (1930), to refute Bataille's materialist ideas as "idiotically" confusing the violence of the "simulacra" of reality with the violence of reality itself (Oui 1 158), there is no doubt as to the affinity that still existed after 1930 between his ideas and those of Bataille. True enough, some of Dali's pronouncements in this article may exemplify the kind of antimaterial ist idealism for which Bataille blamed surrealism. Yet, while entertaining the somewhat idealizing notion that behind the "three great simulacra, excrement, blood and putrefaction" there might be hidden the "desired treasure land," the "dawn of the 'Golden Age,'" Dal? probably still felt close enough to Bataille, who in his writing embraces scatology and transgressive sexuality, in an effort to escape from the "idealist plot" and to counter "neurotic cultural sublimation."20 It appears, indeed, that both Giacometti and Dal? demonstrate a marked affinity with Bataille's vision of sadism, cruelty, and sexual violence. Both may have found interesting Bataille's poetic evocation of sexuality in terms of movement, although Giacometti appears to apply it more forcefully and directly, in his Suspended Ball, with its sliding and cutting movement of the ball and the wedge, than Dal? ever did in his objets ? fonctionnement symbolique.2^ The differences, however, between Giacometti's work and Dali's objects go farther than that. One very important notion concerning the actual realization of these objects, which Breton's proposal for the creation of dream objects seems to imply for Dal?, is the use of 18. Luis Bunuel, L'Age d'Or and Un Chien Andalou: Films by Luis Bunuel, trans. Marianne Alexandre (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1968), p. 96. 19. Dali's work was reproduced in the magazine, and Bataille enthusiastically praised Dali's and Bu?uel's film Un chien andalou (Documents 1, no. 4, 1929, p. 216). Dali's ties with Bataille were severed as a result of the deepening controversy between Bataille and Breton, in which Dal? became involved when Bataille published an article concerning his painting The Lugubrious Game (Documents 1, no. 7, 1929). The article proved to be another attack on Breton, and Dal?, who felt that his interests lay with the surrealist group, did not grant Bataille permission to reproduce a photograph of the painting. For English translations of Bataille's most important essays, see Georges Bataille, Visions of Excess: Selected Writings 1927-1939, ed. Allan Stoekl, Theory and History of Literature, vol. 14 (Minneapolis, Minn.: University of Minnesota Press, 1985). 20. These expressions are used by Denis Hollier (pp. 109, 112). See his Against Architecture: Ihe Writings of Georges Bataille, trans. Betsy Wing (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1989) for a very illuminating discussion about the role of scatology in Bataille's writing and about the Bataille-Breton polemic. 21. In Bataille's "The Solar Anus," which was written in 1927 and first published in 1931, accompanied with illustrations by Andr? Masson, we find the following: The two primary motions are rotation and sexual movement, whose combination is expressed by the locomotive's wheels and pistons. These two motions are reciprocally transformed, the one into the other. Thus one notes that the earth, by turning, makes animals and men have coitus, and (because the result is as much the cause as that which provokes it) that animals and men make the earth turn by having coitus. It is the mechanical combination or transformation of these movements that the alchemist sought as the philosopher's stone. Visions of Excess, p. 6</page><page sequence="8">Finkelstein: The incarnation of desire 121 found materials rather than of traditional sculptural techniques. Dal? argues in his essay that Giacometti's Suspended Ball still employs sculptural means, while the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique do not "allow any likelihood of formal preoccupation" and are "extra plastiques" (Oui 1 178). In view of Breton's allusion to these objects in Les Vases communicants, and his enumeration in Entretiens (161) of Giacometti's "astonishing constructions"22 and Dali's objects as belonging to two separate categories, it would appear that this distinction, quite crucial to Dali's conception, has been accepted all along by Breton too. For Dal? such formal preoccupations were limiting. His declared purpose was the establishment of a "true spiritual culture" based on man's ability to pervert thought (Oui 1 179). To further this aim, he set out to launch a communal activity open to all surrealists, following Lautr?amont's dictum that "poetry ought to be made by everyone" or, as Aragon paraphrased it in his then recently published La peinture au d?fi (Challenge to Painting, 1930), "The Marvelous should be made by all and not by one alone."23 In this light, the "extra-plastic" character of Dali's objects was a necessary condition, found objects being accessible to anyone. The distinction between the two conceptions?Dali's and Giacometti's?is as valid on aesthetic or political grounds as in terms of symbolic functioning. The reading of feminine and masculine forms in Suspended Ball, notwithstanding a certain ambiguity, as has been argued, of sexual identity, is based on some generalized notions regarding sexual symbolism that derive from accepted formal sexual attributes (feminine depression, masculine wedge-form, and so on). The sliding motion, frustrating any attempt at "fulfillment"?while hinting at a perpetum mobile of unbound pleasure?enhances the sado-masochistic flair of the work. Dali's insistence on nonsculptural means reflects a desire to encompass the whole gamut of sexual symbolism, depending both on materials and on found, everyday objects that already have acquired a certain symbolic character. The symbolic functioning is not limited to movement but applies to any type of interaction of the constituent components, as illustrated by Dali's description of one of his own objects (fig. 3): A woman's shoe, inside which a glass of warm milk has been placed, in the center of a soft paste in the color of excrement. The mechanism consists of the dipping in the milk of a sugar lump, on which there is a drawing of a shoe, so that the dissolving of the sugar, and consequently of the image of the shoe, may be observed. Several accessories (pubic hairs glued to a sugar lump, an erotic little photograph) complete the object, which is accompanied by a box of spare sugar lumps and a special spoon used for stirring lead pellets inside the shoe. Oui 1 181-182 Combining sexual symbols from Freud with some more explicit erotic elements found in Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia sexualis, Dali's object still is not too easily accessible to interpretation. Although some components (shoe, hair) may be found in psychoanalytical works devoted to sexual symbolism, and others (excrement, for instance) occupy a prominent position in Dali's iconography of those years, the action of dipping the sugar lump in milk appears less understandable, requiring an elucidation of a more specific, and perhaps even biographical, nature. Dal? is at times quite generous with these kinds of explanations, although they often merely serve his purpose of the moment. Thus, in his book-length study Le mythe tragique de l'Ang?lus de Millet, Dali associates this action with his terror of the sexual act, which he relates to a fear of being absorbed, annihilated, eaten by his mother.24 It also illustrates Dali's growing Although Giacometti's sculpture may reflect such notions more obviously than Dali's objects, one should also note in this respect the pedaling of the cyclist in the second scene of Un chien andalou, or, more strikingly, the motion of the cloud and the sliding or cutting motion of the razor in the famous opening scene of the film, which was praised by Bataille in one of his Documents articles (see n. 19). By the time they wrote the screenplay of Un chien andalou, Dal? and Bu?uel may have read Bataille's L'histoire de l' il (1928). See also Rosalind Krauss's extended comparison of L'histoire de l' il ano Suspended Ball (Originality, pp. 62-64). 22. We should note that within the framework of Giacometti's sculptural work, Suspended Ball is one of a number of works entitled "objets mobiles et muets" (movable and silent objects), drawings of which appear in the same issue of Le Surr?alisme au service de la R?volution (no. 3, 1931) in which Dali's "Objets surr?alistes" appeared. 23. Louis Aragon, Les collages, Collection miroirs de l'art (Paris: Hermann, 1965), p. 71. 24. One may note that such an interpretation goes well in hand with the thesis forwarded by him in this work regarding the underlying theme of the Ang?lus. Dal? began writing this book-length study of Millet's Ang?lus, Le mythe tragique de l'Ang?lus de Millet, ?n the early 1930s. Having supposedly lost the manuscript just before the Germans occupied France, Dal? found it again in the early 1960s, submitting it for publication without, as he professes, changing a comma. See Le mythe tragique de L'Ang?lus de Millet: Interpr?tation "parano?aque-critique" (Paris: Jean-Jacques Pauvert, 1963), p. 7. The origin for some of his fantasies related to milk and the images they evoke is found, according to Dal? (55), in remote childhood</page><page sequence="9">122 RES 23 SPRING 1993 preoccupation in the early 1930s with notions related to eating and "cannibalism" (a point to be discussed later on). One cannot tell to what extent such notions were already on Dali's mind in 1931 when he made this object. One may accept that, for the object to be realized, a full conscious awareness of all the symbolic implications is hardly necessary. Dal?, indeed, argues in "Objets surr?alistes" that "the pleasure extracted from the realization of these acts is unexplainable, or is accounted for by erroneous theories elaborated by the censorship or repression" (Oui 1 178). Furthermore, the object itself is just the point of departure for a "new and absolutely unknown series of perversions and, consequently, of poetic facts." It is quite obvious, however, that Dali's object as well as the other objects introduced in this issue of Le Surr?alisme au service de la R?volution exhibit a certain degree of conscious incorporation of sexual content. It is this conscious aspect of the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique that Breton appears to criticize in Les Vases communicants. Breton's reservations are elucidated in Les Vases communicants (1932), in relation to his proposal to put into circulation erotically suggestive objects of the kind revealed in dreams.25 Breton argues that even "condensation and displacement, the effects of censorship" (66), cannot ward off a rigorous interpretation that would reveal the sexual content underlying such objects. What Breton appears to suggest is that their power derives from their origin in dreams or automatic thought processes, which also subsume the principles of condensation and displacement. Citing as an example Lautr?amont's powerful aphorism, "Il est beau . . . comme la rencontre fortuite sur une table de dissection d'une machine ? coudre et d'un parapluie!" (Ducasse 327), Breton asserts that the force of this phrase derives from the encounter of male and female symbols.26 Objects partaking of a similar mechanism, argues Breton, offer a wider scope of interpretation and have a greater power of suggestion than objects in which some "latent" sexual content has been incorporated intentionally (68). Breton, of course, refers here to Dali's objets ? fonctionnement symbolique?"without formulating the least reserve as to their explosive value or their 'beauty'"?and to Dali's argument that the intentional incorporation of "latent" sexual content is just the impetus for the formation of a "new and absolutely unknown series of perversions" (Oui 1 178). This is the essence of the confrontation between the two attitudes underlying Dali's and Breton's conceptions. An object such as the speculative "objet fant?me" would be constructed in Breton's mind in an automatic process, revealing its latent sexual content only after the fact. In opposition to dream and automatism, Dal? advocates the active soliciting of the mind to discharge the images hidden in the unconscious by means of a conscious incorporation of sexual content. Furthermore, Breton puts great stock in the "astonishing power of suggestion that certain almost ordinary objects acquire by chance, if we take for example the gold-leaf electroscope (the two gold leaves, perfectly joined together in the middle of the cage, spring apart the moment that a rubbed stick approaches them), which should contribute to the excitement that children find in the study of physics" (Les Vases communicants 68). This simplicity, for which the gold-leaf electroscope, indeed, has no peers, is quite contrary to the exceedingly complex structure of the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique that illustrate Dali's essay. Of course, judging by the descriptions and photographs alone, it is almost impossible to assess correctly the effect of these objects. Breton's object, for memories of a book for children in which there was a picture of young kangaroos in their mother's pouch that, the bottom of the pouch being white, appear to be floating in milk. These milk images are also related to childhood fantasies concerning large milk-bearing vegetables (Dali also refers to a vegetable found near Figueras called "Saint Teresa's Milk"). Milk appears to Dali as possessing an ambivalent quality (55-57) related to erotic desires, as well as to the Oedipal fixation and to the fear of incest. The submersion in milk is an expression of the fear of being eaten and absorbed by his mother. Dal? at this point (57) refers to the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique as instructing us on the subject of liquids that serve as intermediaries for the desires of cannibalism. 25. This type of object is defined by the "Nosferatu Tie," an object revealed to Breton in a dream, to which he devotes an exhaustive analysis, as well as by another speculative construction, the "objet-fant?me," named by him "I'enveloppe-silence." See Andr? Breton, Les Vases communicants (Paris: Editions Gallimard, 1955), pp. 36-37, 48-54. 26. If one thinks of the extraordinary force that Lautr?amont's celebrated phrase . . . can exert upon the reader's mind, and if one refers to the key of the simplest sexual ?mages, it should not take us long to realize that this power derives from the fact that the umbrella cannot but represent the man, the sewing machine represents the woman (as moreover most machines do, the more so since this one, as is well known, is frequently used by women for onanistic purposes), and the dissecting table represents the bed, itself a common measure of life and death. The contrast beween the immediate sexual act and the extremely broken up picture that Lautr?amont makes of it, it alone provokes the shock. Les Vases communicants, p. 65</page><page sequence="10">Finkelstein: The incarnation of desire 123 instance, seems quite ponderous in its agglomeration of elements, and perhaps it also is too esoteric in conception to evoke any sexual reaction.27 Valentine Hugo's object, as described by Dal?, consists of two hands, one white-gloved, the other red, that are placed on a green roulette cloth. The gloved hand holds a die between thumb and forefinger. The fingers of the red hand are movable, and its forefinger is stuck in the glove's opening. Unlike Breton's creation, the latter object, with its white- and red-gloved hands over a green roulette cloth, must have been quite striking, and one can also accept that the "fonctionnement" of the movable fingers could provoke some erotic fantasy. Although the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique, from contemporary accounts, appear to have been considered a surrealist vogue, almost an obligatory activity, on examination they prove to be a very short lived phenomenon. Furthermore, even during the heyday of this vogue, it is difficult to point to an extensive production of such objects. Dali uses the same list of five objects found in his "Objets surr?alistes" to illustrate his article "The Object as Revealed in Surrealist Experiment," which was published close to a year later. Less than a year in duration, and showing few, if any, objects beyond those illustrating its beginning, it is doubtful whether this activity had met with real success. The reasons for their short-lived duration are quite obvious. In the first place, the objects pose problems with regard to their actual "functioning," which is, at best, cumbersome and, in other cases (Breton's object, for instance), quite unspecified. Indeed, only a "sculptural" object such as Giacometti's, with its well-defined sliding movement, would offer a smooth and easily accomplished Operation. There is also the question of durability of component parts and the need to replenish continuously some of the perishable materials. In addition, those objects, passed around and appreciated in a small circle of friends, would pose problems when offered up for broader public dissemination, because this obviously would curtail the opportunity of "operating" and thus genuinely appreciating them. Regardless of their shortcomings, what these objects represent (i.e., the active "operating" of certain elements in a shortcut to the hidden sources of man's sexual obsessions) was hailed by Breton and his fellow surrealists as a major breakthrough in the domain of the object. It was thus to be expected that new developments in this domain would preserve their essential qualities, even while offering some solution to the problems associated with their physical operation. In this perspective, the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique can be considered a landmark of surrealist thought and aesthetics, providing a theoretical, as well as practical, basis for the Surrealist Object proper. When Marcel Jean, in The History of Surrealist Painting (1960), argues that the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique lack "the essential quality of Giacometti's invention, the sense of unity of a true object," he is projecting on them the considerations applied to objects created later in the mid-1930s. In an article included in the special issue of Cahiers d'Art (no. 1-2, 1936), published in conjunction with the 1936 Exposition surr?aliste d'objets, Jean argues that, unlike the earlier objects, the new object "is no longer destined to accomplish a determined symbolic movement, always the same one. It tends to answer general physiological and intellectual needs, a need, for instance, which is to nutrition what M?ret Oppenheim's The Fur-Covered Cup is to cups and saucers."28 Jean is referring here to the celebrated object that epitomizes, in a sense, the general character of the new Surrealist Objects (fig. 4). Contrary to the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique, what these offer is a "potential movement of great poetic violence," a virtual "fonctionnement" in the mind through a chain of associations that, in The Fur-Covered Cup, for instance, concerns the shape of the cup, the imagined texture of the fur, and the speculation with regard to the act of drinking out of this cup. Jean finds here the presence of "sexual perversion 27. Dal? describes it as the "most complex and difficult to analyze." It consists of a little bicycle saddle, an earthenware receptacle filled with tobacco on which are two long pink sugared almonds, a polished wooden globe, and so forth; and the functioning in part involves turning the saddle around its axis, slinging a green sugared almond by means of a catapult, and making the bicycle bell ring (Oui 1, p. 180). Breton's very few realized objects, often serving to demonstrate his theory, are seldom accessible or immediate in their effects. His only realized dream-object, existing as a small model, was reproduced under the title "R?ve-Objet" in Cahiers d'Art (no. 5-6, [1935]: 125), accompanied by a short introduction. It consists of a miniaturized hotel corridor with five doors opening into it, behind which appear images, letters, or short texts. Its basic structuring principle is shaped by a play on words in the tradition of Raymond Roussel and Jean-Pierre Brisset. The complicated analogies relating the different elements composing this object, according to Breton, refute the assumption that "dream with all its inconsequence is not under the sign of Euclid." 28. See Marcel Jean, Ihe History of Surrealist Painting, with the collaboration of Arpad Mezei, trans. Simon Watson Taylor (New York: Grove Press, 1967), p. 227; Marcel Jean, "Arriv?e de la belle ?poque," Cahiers d'Art (L'Objet) 1-2 (1936): 60.</page><page sequence="11">124 RES 23 SPRING 1993 Figure 4.

Thus, for Jean, these new objects are no longer open to the kind of criticism Breton voices in Les Vases communicants. Furthermore, unencumbered by the requirement of actual "fonctionnement," the creators of such objects can indulge in compositional considerations that would endow their objects with a greater visual immediacy. The danger this conception might hold in store for the practitioner, which Jean does not appear to acknowledge, is the aestheticizing tendency, or the placing of the "sense of unity of a true object," to use Jean's phrase, above any other consideration. Few are the objects, like The Fur Covered Cup, which would combine a strong plastic sense with a rich connotative function. In fact, in addition to their disorienting effect ("d?paysement"), resulting from the often radical manipulation of the commonplace object, many Surrealist Objects of the mid-1930s appear to offer an ornamental sense only slightly, or titillatingly (whichever the case might be), touched with erotic overtones.29 Yet, one may argue that sexual connotations or latent sexual content are in the eyes of the beholder, and this was especially true for the surrealists, who were always on the lookout for any manifestation of the "?rotique voil?" (veiled-erotic) factor, which for Breton was one of the ingredients of "convulsive beauty." Breton, indeed, contends that "any piece of flotsam and jetsam within our grasp should be considered a precipitate of our desire" (Surrealism and Painting 283). Similarly, for Jean, in the essay quoted above, any object of daily use would have a dual sense, combining practical utilization with latent sexual content. In the light of these pronouncements, even those objects employing humor or black humor as their guiding principle should be considered as vehicles of erotic fantasy.30 It can be suggested, however, that Jean's "sexual perversion with its dazzling poetic value" may appear in a more striking fashion in those objects explicitly employing human limbs in isolation (as, for instance, in Oscar Dominguez's jamais [1938], in which two female legs emerge from the horn of an old gramophone painted white, while a pickup arm in the shape of a hand is poised above the turntable). One of the most striking creations in this genre is Hans Bellmer's Poup?e,3* which, being manipulated and reassembled in various postures and combinations, embodies both total submission and subversion (figs. 5 and 6). Similar considerations, this time related to the manipulation of the human body itself, will come up again in the discussion of Dali's concept of "?tres-objets," or beings objects. Fetishism and cannibalism Dal? did not remain wholly aloof from these aestheticizing tendencies. Although some of his objects of the mid-1930s might appear to offer a virtual "fonctionnement" in the mind, most of them come forth as visually appealing sculptural realizations of themes found in his paintings (such as, for instance, Retrospective Bust of a Woman of 1933, or Venus with 29. Two interesting examples for this kind of objects are Oscar Dominguez's Armchair (1937), a wheelbarrow upholstered in red satin, and Marcel Jean's Specter of the Gardenia (1936), a woman's head made of plaster and covered with a tight black fabric, with zippers for eyes. 30. Maurice Henry's visually striking Homage to Paganini (1936), for instance, a typical representative of this type of absurd object consisting of a little violin wrapped up in elastic bandages, derives its erotic dimension from the similarity of the violin to the female body and the perverse practices associated with bandages. 31. The surrealists first became acquainted with Bellmer's work in 1934, when a series of photographs under the title "Poup?e: Variations sur le montage d'une mineure articul?e" appeared in the December issue of Minotaure.</page><page sequence="12">Finkelstein: The incarnation of desire 125 Figures 5 and 6.

Drawers of 1936).32 But if these works could be seen as Dali's bowing to commercial necessity, there was the theory, as well as other objects, to show where Dali's real inclinations lay. What Dal? would have found objectionable in Jean's approach all along is the attempt to see these objects in terms of sublimation of sexual desire. Although it is debatable to what extent the notion of sublimation is fully applicable to objects that so often present such an overt erotization of the commonplace, Dali's own philosophical disavowal of any idea of sublimation, indeed, his notion of "fonctionnement," points to a much more emphatic utilization of the fetishistic fixation associated with some of the component parts of the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique than what might have been offered by the aestheticized and visually appealing Surrealist Object of the mid-1930s. Dal?, indubitably, was continuously aware of the fetishistic power of articles of clothing such as shoes and hats, as is fully borne out even by his later commercial "inventions." He also knew, however, that much of this power might be tapered off in the aestheticizing processes of cultural sublimation, and looked for the means of enhancing "man's capacity for perverting his thought"(Ou7 / 179) in impulses lying closer to the source of unadulterated fetishistic fixation.33 As William Pietz aptly points out, the most essential quality of the fetish object is its "irreducible materiality. The truth of the fetish resides in this status as a material embodiment. . ." (7).34 What one may readily discover to be a common thread through much of Dali's theory of the object, especially in its early phases in the early 1930s, is the "desire for the object, the tangible object" (Surrealists on Art, p. 89), even when the point of 32. The first consists of a porcelain bust of a woman with two cobs of corn hanging from the neck, the forehead covered with ants, and a large loaf of bread balanced on the naked scalp with two inkwells and a small sculptural representation of the Ang?lus of Millet in its middle (Millet's figures appear in many guises and shapes in his work of these years). The small sculptural reproduction of the Venus de Milo in which are embedded drawers with furlined knobs (a rather successful use of fur in this context) is a variation on another familiar motif in Dali's work. 33. A Surrealist Object made by Dali in 1936, an assemblage in a box or tray in which various fetish articles, such as shoes, a foot made of plaster, a chocolate glove wrapped in silver paper, an erotic toy, and so on, are placed in compartments or containers, might be seen as Dali's wry comment on the taming of the fetish in a process of cultural appropriation. 34. William Pietz offers in his article "The Problem of the Fetish, I," RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics 9 (1985): 5-17, several other interesting insights. His paraphrasing of Michel Leiris's "Alberto</page><page sequence="13">126 RES 23 SPRING 1993 departure is in the realm of the purely visual. His is an increasingly anxious, almost desperate, attempt to get closer to the materiality of the object. The essay "The Object as Revealed in Surrealist Experiment" is Dali's most systematic attempt to view the whole history of the object in surrealism from this particular perspective. In so proffering this history, Dal? also, quite inadvertently, provides some important clues regarding the future course of his own activity as a creator of objects. As Dal? would have it, in the first phase of the Surrealist Object, defined primarily by the unexpected encounter with objects (as in Nadja, for instance), "Every object was regarded as a disturbing and arbitrary 'being' and was credited with having an existence entirely independent of the experimenters' activity" (87). The desire to interfere in the life of the object, to have it shed its arbitrary character, is partially accomplished in the second phase when the object, in Breton's dream-object proposal, "assumes the immovable shape of desire and acts upon our contemplation" (96). This concretization of the "shape of desire," satisfying the fetishistic "d?sir de v?rification," is another step toward a "direct contact with the object." The objets ? fonctionnement symbolique introduce the attempt to create "objects which fulfil the necessity of being open to action by our own hands and moved about by our own wishes" (94). The ultimate ideal, in Dalfs view, is the "fusion" or the "formation of unity" with the object. It is well in line with Dali's brand of logic that this continuing need to take an active part in the existence of things is characterized by a "yearning to form a whole with them," and then a "sudden consciousness of a new hunger," which results in the desire to eat them (95). It is interesting to note that Dal?, enumerating "eatables" in surrealist works, places those found in de Chirico's early paintings?crescents, macaroons, biscuits, as well as pairs of artichokes and clusters of bananas in public squares?at the head of his list as objects that he conceives as "actual surrealist articles." Dal? also points to the predominance of eatables in the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique (alluding to objects by Gala Eluard, Man Ray, and Crevel for which there is no other documentation available). A wax object by Eluard prompts him to develop some notions concerning wax, describing it as being malleable, eatable "in former times," used in magic and in the making of effigies (thus being a true precursor, Dal? insists, of the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique), or used as an edible matter in spiritual s?ances. The taper in Eluard's object is seen by Dali as an "intestinal morphological metaphor," yet wax is also considered by him as being consubstantial with honey, which, as he notes, is used in magic for erotic purposes (96). Dal? did not have a wealth of material to draw on to illustrate this last phase of his history of the Surrealist Object, and whatever he did offer as documentation served his overall purpose of legitimizing his own idiosyncratic concerns in the eyes of his surrealist friends. In Le mythe tragique de L'Ang?lus de Millet, Dali recounts how, a few years after proposing these objects, he was led to discover their original purpose as being related to notions of cannibalism?"a cannibalism tending to become exteriorized by the obsessive and significant presence in them of comestible elements, of intestinal metaphors, or of constituents subjected to physical conditions that make them to some degree digestible" (61). And as noted before, Dali's writing after 1933 is dominated by metaphors related to eating, devouring, and hunger, which, although obviously related to the Freudian equation of the sexual act with eating, are associated more meaningfully in his case with an aesthetic and philosophical adoption of the basic characteristics of infantile sexuality and the "regression" to an oral, pregenital sexual disposition. The confluence at this time of excremental, culinary, and erotic concerns reflects a new phase in his aesthetics of regression, best exemplified by his ideas regarding the "modern style" or Art Nouveau architecture. In his essay "De la beaut? terrifiante et comestible de l'architecture modem style" (1933), Dali refers to the aspects of anachronism, deliriousness, sadomasochism, edibility, extra-plastic character, and so on of this architecture?all fitting, in some degree, his ideas regarding the object. It is important in this respect to consider his vehement objection to any attempt to see in it a "plastic" phenomenon in which the right-angle formula is simply replaced by the "convulsive-ondulante" formula (Oui 2 23). Dal? views the origins of this architecture in terms of a "faim originale," which submits architectural elements of the Giacometti," Documents 1, no. 4 (1929), seems to be a very fitting description of the mechanism to which Dal? himself often refers in his writing (particularly in Le mythe tragique de L'Ang?lus de Millet): The fetish object "recalls" the sense of being touched within the embodied self as this was made conscious in singular moments of "crisis" in which the identity of the self is called into question, put at risk, by a sudden encounter with the life of the outside world. Such a crisis brings together and fixes into a singularly resonant unified intensity an unrepeatable event (permanent in memory), a particular object or arrangement of objects, and a localized space.

Dal? sees those "modern style" buildings as the "r?alisation de d?sirs solidifi?s," (realization of solidified desires) and cites the presence in them of "characteristic dream elements: condensation, displacement, etc." (27). All those ideas are finally labeled by Dali as "cannibalisme des objets." His conclusion, "La beaut? sera comestible ou ne sera pas" (29), in which he paraphrases Breton's concluding sentence of Nadja, "La beaut? sera CONVULSIVE ou ne sera pas"(187), is a call for a "nutritional" aesthetics that would transgress Breton's own.35 Notwithstanding the use of real pork chops on his wife's shoulders on one of their arrivals in New York, the cannibalistic cum "modern style" conception failed to leave a lasting imprint on Dali's object production. Although Dali's essay treats "modern style" in terms of sculpture or architecture, there is no doubt that it was his painting, primarily, to which this style offered a formal medium suitable as an expression for his overriding preoccupations with regression and perversion. Indeed, from 1929 to 1931 Dali's forms bear directly on Art Nouveau ornamentation, its arabesques and convolutions forming a skeleton for the spiraling floating images that often characterize the paintings of these years (it might be noted in passing that these paintings preceded the "modern style" essay).36 Objects made of ready-made materials, on the other hand, regardless of the level of "symbolic functioning" that inspired them, ordinarily would lend themselves less readily to the demands of this formal language; at best, they would adopt the "cannibalistic" notion through associational devices (for instance, the dipping of the sugar cube in milk, in Dali's objet ? fonctionnement symbolique of 1931). Objets psycho-atmosph?riques-anamorphiques The limitations of the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique led Dali to consider some other options in an essay that marks the widening of the gap between his theory of the object and his actual artistic practice. In "Objets psycho-atmosph?riques-anamorphiques" (1933), Dal? submits the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique to a "convulsive-formal grinding." The resulting objets psycho-atmosph?riques-anamorphiques are meant to go beyond the stage of the "cannibalism of objects" and, for that matter, "any symbolic stage in general" (Oui 1 203). The obviously parodistic and blatant absurdity of Dali's suggested "scrupulous preparation" discloses the true nature of these "objects" as just vehicles of Dali's thought rather than as an activity to be practically pursued. Dal? is out to cleanse the stables, so to speak, of all former notions regarding the Surrealist Object by a tour de force that takes the basic assumptions underlying them to their logical or, rather, illogical conclusion. To briefly summarize Dali's elaborate "preparation," the process starts in a dark room with the random choice of one out of an array of bizarre objects. The chosen item is then placed in the hands of several "technicians," who describe orally what they have sensed by way of touch. Others, on the basis of this description, construct the components separately, which then are combined in an automatic manner. The object thus reconstructed is then photographed without being seen by the photographer. Seen by nobody, the photograph is enclosed in a hollow piece of metal, which is then dipped in molten iron. The resulting chunk of metal is the wished-for objet psycho atmosph?rique-anamorphique. As Dal? would have it, "going beyond the symbolic stage, the object gradually 'verifies' itself by its own 'real constitution' and no longer by the associational evocations of its constitution. The 'lyrical enigma' comes to acquire, beyond the didactic haze of symbols, its real 'materialist constitution'" (205). In other words, in the "symbolic" stage of the Surrealist Object the realization of desire has been provoked by an interaction and association of the component parts within the object. Dali's continuous movement toward a greater concretization of mental phenomena is characterized, as reflected in his scheme for the evolution of the Surrealist Object, by the ambition to achieve an objectification of perversion. A greater objectification could be attained if the symbolic "fonctionnement," serving as an intermediary between the object and the emotions it provokes, would be discarded in favor of a direct rapport between the object and the emotions or sensations and perversions related to it. As a result, "obscure feelings will become classifiable entities that can be measured, adjusted by light, according to the cognitive level of the hardest and most precise anatomies . . ." (205). 35. It is interesting, however, that Dal? still makes use of Breton's term in expressions such as "convulsive-ondulante formula" (Oui 2, p. 23) or "convulsive-formal grinding"(p. 25). 36.

Dali's conclusion points in two directions that, although not mutually exclusive, have different ramifications. One involves the "paranoiac accession of the object" (205), which turns it into a "meteor of the imagination." Dal? argues that the sense of mystery felt by a person as he dreamily contemplates a brilliant star in the sky is destroyed when he discovers it to be the burning tip of a cigarette. However, this tip will recover "all of its most incontestable dizzying sensations of seduction and irrational curiosity" the moment it becomes the only visible element of an immense objet psycho atmosph?rique-anamorphique, and the person observing it is told that this object contains the skulls of Richard Wagner and Ludwig II of Bavaria, smoking this cigarette together through an ingenious mechanical device. "The tip of this cigarette," adds Dali, "will shine so much more lyrically than the atmospheric scintillations of the clearest star" (207). As frivolous as these suggestions may appear, they do reflect Dali's persistent attempt during these years to formulate a theory of paranoia-criticism that would express the supremacy of paranoiac thought as a tool for endowing the gratuitous with some sense.37 There is, however, an underlying thought that appears to be even more consistent with Dali's preoccupations at the time. The expression "meteor of the imagination" relates the objets psycho atmosph?riques-anamorphiques to a "Communication" he made in the sixth issue of Le Surr?alisme au service de la R?volution (1933) concerning meteors and false meteors.38 Commenting on the inexplicable fact that there is a surprising resemblance between real meteors and the large number of false meteors found in European museums, Dal? refers to anonymous scientific or pseudo-scientific authorities purporting to explain this phenomenon. Taking this essay as his point of departure, Dal? argues that even primitive people, who have seen a meteor exploding in the sky and have no notion what a real meteor is like, always seem to choose stones that closely resemble real meteors because these look unlike any other stones in the area. Not entirely satisfied with this explanation, Dal? comes up with the conclusion that man irrationally recognizes the shape of these metal slags that fall on the earth: they resemble shit. Dal?, who has been arguing before that irrational "connaissance" originates in a paranoiac association that derives its power from a certain obsession, now universalizes his own scatological obsessions and insights and applies them to the whole of mankind. Such a determination is already well apparent in "L'?ne pourri" where Dal? asks whether "the three great simulacra?shit, blood and putrefaction?do not hide behind them a desired 'land of treasures'" (Oui 1 159). Dal? undoubtedly meant his "Communication" to complement the essay by pointing to the similarity between his objets psycho atmosph?riques-anamorphiques and the excremental false meteors. The formal resemblance is brought home in the illustration accompanying the essay?clearly meant to be a parody of a scientific illustration?which presents a score of numbered small stonelike objects of no determined shape. Furthermore, the chunks of matter that are the objets psycho-atmosph?riques anamorphiques also resemble excremental matter, not just in their final form but even in their process of becoming, which moves from the distinctness of the 37. These notions have been stated in greater detail in my article "Dali's Paranoia-Criticism or The Exercise of Freedom," Twentieth Century Literature 21, no. 1 (1975): 59-71. Briefly, Dali's point of departure is the common definition of paranoia as a delusional psychosis in which the obsessional delusions develop into a complex and logically elaborated system. Paranoia-criticism or paranoiac critical activity is an active and willed "systematization of confusion" that manifests itself as an organizer and objectifier of the "unlimited and unknown possibilities of the systematic association of subjective and objective phenomena presenting themselves to us as irrational concerns" (La conqu?te de l'irrationnel [1935], Oui 2, p. 62). Differently stated, it is a "spontaneous method of irrational knowledge based on the interpretative-critical association of delirium phenomena" (61). While in its early stages Dal? considered the theory mostly in reference to its visual application as a tool for subverting our perception of reality (a function embodied in the concept of the double and multiple ?mage), later he employed it as a method of interpreting phenomena in the external world or works of art. Gratuitousness is indispensable to Dali as a constructive element of the paranoiac process. The gratuitous creates a relationship where such a relationship is not perceived consciously or even unconsciously. Far from being a passive element given to interpretation and intervention, asserts Dal?, the paranoiac delirium constitutes in itself a form of interpretation ("Nouvelles consid?rations g?n?rales sur le m?canisme du ph?nom?ne parano?aque du point de vue surr?aliste," Minotaure, no. 1 [1933]; Oui 2, pp. 11-12). Thus one should not attempt to find sense in what is gratuitous, but rather allow the gratuitous to form a new and altogether irrational meaning for the phenomenon considered. 38. The sixth issue appeared simultaneously with the fifth, which included the essay "Objets psycho-atmosph?riques-anamorphiques."</page><page sequence="16">Finkelstein: The incarnation of desire 129 of Degradation in Erotic Life" [1912]), Dalf argues in the "L'amour" section of La femme visible (1930) that "one experiences repugnance and disgust for what at heart one desires, and from this comes the irresistible and 'morbid' attraction, often betrayed by incomprehensible curiosity regarding what may appear to us as repugnant."40 In this essay Dali also equates the images of desire and scatology and declares, not without the pleasure of shocking his reader, that "one loves wholly when one is ready to eat the shit of the beloved woman." Scatology was supplanted in the early 1930s by thematics related to food and ingestion, which dominate, as we have seen, his theory of the object. One suspects, however, that this displacement was not due to any repression in the psychoanalytical sense. Rather, explicit representations of scatology proved to be quite irksome to his surrealist friends, as evidenced by the reception of his painting Le jeu lugubre (1929), and at that time Dal? still felt the need to remain in Breton's good graces. While shifting his major metaphors, as noted before, from the anal to the oral or "cannibalistic" organization, Dal? retained his allegiance to the scatological vision. All along he probably had been associating in his mind the perverse dimension underlying his concept of the Surrealist Object with scatology. Already, in the essay "Objets surr?alistes," he evoked objects such as "great automobiles, three times their natural size," which will be "reproduced in minute detail in plaster or onyx, only in order to be enclosed, wrapped in women's linen, in sepulchers which will be hidden from view, their presence indicated only by a thin clock made of straw" (Oui 1 179). Straw and excrement often, indeed, being associated in Dali's mind,41 this suggests another Surrealist Object, through a "convulsive-formal grinding" (digestion), to the formlessness and homogeneity of excrement.39 These considerations suggest that in this essay Dal? illustrates, perhaps even allegorizes, the evolution of his theory of the Surrealist Object as a project of desublimation. Since 1929, Dal?, upholding the "polymorphously perverse" sexuality as an emancipatory stance, a rebellion against the norms of society, quite consciously perceived it mostly in scatological terms. Pursuing ideas similar to Freud's (as expounded, for instance, in "The Most Prevalent Form 39. It is quite possible, as Rosalind Krauss points out, that the adjective "informe," used to describe the objets psycho atmosph?riques-anamorphiques, was borrowed by Dal? from Georges Bataille. See "Corpus Delicti," L'Amour fou: Photography and Surrealism, ed. Rosalind Krauss and Jane Livingston, with an essay by Dawn Ades (New York: Abbeville Press, 1985), p. 57. The way the word "informe" was used by Dal? and Bataille points to another interesting confluence between the two. In one of the "Dictionary" entries Bataille published occasionally in Documents, the word "informe" (translated as "formless" or, better, "unformed") is not given a meaning but a task to "bring things down in the world" by demolishing the form assigned to them. Philosophers or academic men need to create formal categories, to assign the universe a shape. "On the other hand, affirming that the universe resembles nothing and is only formless amounts to saying that the universe is something like a spider or spit" {Visions of Excess, p. 31). Spider or spit serve in Bataille's thought as a denial of form or, rather, of the limits of form; their role is thus similar to that of scatology. Denis Hollier offers an interesting perspective on Bataille's "informe" by relating it to concepts found in one of Plato's dialogues. In this dialogue, questions are being raised concerning the notion of a separate form or idea for certain types of objects; those objects that "would really seem ridiculous . . ." hair and mud and dirt, for example, or anything else which is utterly worthless and trivial . . . (99). In Hollier's "scatological reading" of the dialogue, these "ridiculous" objects, which are perceived merely by touch, postulate a connection in scatology between laughter and touch as well as a conflict between repulsion and desire (100-101). We should note, in this respect, a series of drawings by Tanguy that appeared under the title "Poids et couleurs" (Weights and colors) in the third issue of Le Surr?alisme au service de la R?volution (the December 1931 issue which also included Dali's "Objets surr?alistes"). The drawings and explanatory texts introduce objects made of different materials?pink plush, painted plaster, cotton, wax, chalk, hairs, and so on?that appear comical, as well as perverse and repugnant. Although they vaguely suggest human organs, these objects, looking like nothing else, convey a scatological sense and appear to satisfy Bataille's requirement for the "informe." Furthermore, not unlike Dali's conception, these objects are open to handling or functioning (the pink plush object has four holes in it that permit passing the fingers of the hand through them, as the text suggests). They also foreshadow certain aspects of Dali's concept of "beings-objects" (see below), as well as Duchamp's collage Pri?re de toucher?foam-rubber breasts on velvet?that was used as a cover for the catalog Le Surr?alisme en 1947. 40. Salvador Dal?, La femme visible (Paris: Editions surr?alistes, 1930), p. 67. In "L'Esprit moderne et le jeu des transpositions" (Documents 2, no. 8, [1930]), Bataille similarly asserts that "what one really loves, one loves above all in shame, and I defy any amateur of paintings to love a canvas as much as a fetishist loves a shoe" (pp. 50-51). Paintings, a product of cultural sublimation, are formed in the "play of transpositions" referred to in the title. These are "symbolic transpositions" (p. 49) or, as Bataille points out elsewhere, "poetic concoctions that are, ultimately, nothing but a diversion (most human beings are naturally feeble and can only abandon themselves to their instincts when in a poetic haze)" (Visions of Excess, p. 23). Thus, Bataille advocates forgoing symbolism or transposition and embracing the "base seduction" of perversion. Dal? adopts a similar viewpoint when he allows that the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique have gone beyond the symbolic stage, hinting at the excremental nature of their "real constitution." 41. For example, in a prose piece entitled "R?verie," published in</page><page sequence="17">130 RES 23 SPRING 1993 passage in "Objets psycho-atmosph?riques anamorphiques" in which Dal? fetishizes excrement, so to speak, by specifying that those objects be placed "inside houses, in locations where they will impede passage and, if possible, preferably on small fresh haycocks" (Oui 1 205). It would appear that Dal? evokes here, again in a quasi-allegorical manner, two separate but complementary modes of anality in his objects: one referring to its hidden "underground" action against the norms of society, the other to its unexpected surfacing as an impediment to sexual complacency, or as a "terrorizing" agent, countering the anal taboo, as he often refers to it in later years.42 Later yet, in Diary of a Genius (1964), Dal? somewhat whimsically relates how the surrealists "did not like anuses! I tried to trick them by giving them lots of anuses, carefully dissimulated, and preferably Machiavellian ones. If I constructed a Surrealist Object in which no fantasy of this type appeared, the symbolic functioning of this object would be anal."43 When Dal? wrote these words, he probably felt free to embellish the past and endow his activities with a greater conscious determination. But however debatable Dali's contention might appear, particularly in view of his meager output of realized objects to justify it, the issue obviously had been on his mind and found expression in some of his writing. Meager, indeed, to say the least. Although it would be difficult to trace the whole reasoning behind every object by Dal?, one may safely surmise that most would not relate to an "anal" functioning unless in a very indirect manner, perhaps as a form of displacement. As has been pointed out earlier, the objets ? fonctionnement symbolique were, for Dal? as well as for others, a short-lived phenomenon. Dali's later objects were more often simply sculptural realizations of themes found in his paintings or illustrations of paranoiac-critical themes, some of which are also found in the painted work. Whether or not one should give credence to Dali's contention that some of the motifs found in Retrospective Bust of a Woman, for instance, appeared to him in diurnal fantasies or as hypnagogic images (Le mythe tragique 102-103), it would be difficult to find in them any underlying "anal" motivation of the kind that Dal? hinted at in the writings of the early 1930s or flaunted in later writings. Thus, the essay "Objets psycho-atmosph?riques anamorphiques" might be seen not only as an allegory recounting the evolution of his theory of the Surrealist Object as a project of desublimation but also as an implied acknowledgment of its limits. The theory pressed for a greater objectification of perversion by discarding the symbolic "fonctionnement" serving as an intermediary between the object and the emotions engendered by it. Paradoxically, the success of this theoretical tour de force lay in its inexorable logic, which posited those formless excremental chunks of metal as the only possible objects satisfying it. Like Dali's "great automobiles," they, too, lie buried and hidden from view, until they are brought forth into the light of day by the power of Dali's reasoning. The parodistic tone Dal? adopts throughout most of the essay, so reminiscent at times of Lautr?amont's rhetorical methods in Les Chants de Maldoror,44 well reflects his ambivalence. As in much of Dali's writing, it offers an ironic deflation of his declared credo, while still suggesting the possibility that he may be quite serious after all. Such intimations regarding Dali's seriousness are, in a sense, vindicated by an examination of the next stage of his theory of the object, which follows through the conclusions of "Objets psycho-atmosph?riques-anamorphiques" while giving them a new and quite unexpected turn. "Beings-objects" The vision of the collapse of form that the objets psycho-atmosph?riques-anamorphiques usher in is a mark of the dynamics inherent in Dali's evolving theory of the object, which, in practical terms, leads to its complete formal extinction. At the same time, this vision is a consummation of Dali's notion of man's "true spiritual culture," which is one of perversion and a return of the repressed. Subsuming both cannibalism and anality, ingestion and excretion, these objects imply, in Freudian terms?the occurrence together in the pregenital organization of both active and passive forms?the aggressive instinct for mastery and the ?e Surr?alisme au service de la R?volution (no. 4, 1931), Dali describes an erotic masturbatory daydream in which he contemplates the sodomizing of a little girl in a stable, amid excrement and rotten straw. 42.

Although obliged to fall back on symbolic functioning, Dal? hoped to raise the objectification of perversion close to the level reached theoretically with the objets psycho-atmosph?riques-anamorphiques by introducing the human element directly into the equation. Dal? made a few tentative forays toward the conception underlying the "?tres-objets," or "beings objects," even before publishing his essay "Apparitions a?rodynamiques des '?tres-objets'" (December 1934). In "Lettre ? Andr? Breton," printed in the catalog of his exhibition at the Pierre-Colle Gallery in June 1933, he had offered a somewhat whimsical account of the birth of the Surrealist Object, which he traced back to the cubist collages and papiers coll?s. The growth and greater concretization of the collage elements, together with the progressive reduction of their support, would have led eventually, so Dal? argues, to the point where the object physically fell down from the picture and started living his "prenatal life" (Oui 2 19). Dal? then related this second stage to some of the earlier phases of the development of the Surrealist Object he had identified in his writings, including symbolic functioning and cannibalism, and announced that all this ended up in the possibility of a "keen lyrical and irrational utilization of real and concrete objects" leading to the coming grandiose actuality of the opera . . . which is none other than the keen irrational utilization of the objects and "beings-objects" that surround us, with the total confusion of all the lyrical genres today, which allows a true manifestation of vital and insane "acts-objects" that would allow you to describe in the most complete form all the dynamic and "concrete irrationality" of the true "modern and surrealist hysteria" Oui 2 19 This is certainly no common notion of the opera. As these and other expressions imply, Dal? had in mind something akin to "performance" in its modern usage. His parodistic bent gets the better of him when he evokes as an example the Picasso etchings that "one can already sing in their entirety and also fling at one's head." Another example, the helmet invented by Sade that amplifies the cries of pain of the victims, hints at the association of his concept of performance with sadism or sadomasochism.47 A similar notion introduced in the "modern style" essay, written around the same time, concerns "one of those tragic and grandiose sado-masochistic edible costumes . . ." (Oui 2 23). Special costumes, headdresses, and other accoutrements are rife in Dali's writing and artistic practice. Here again, as in most other areas of activity, he moved between high-fashion commercial exploits to conceptions that are more intriguing and thought provoking, such as the Aphrodisiac jacket (1936), based on the conception of an even distribution of erotic stimuli all over the body (fig. 7).48 Costumes of this type often figure in "performances," such as the bizarre event in 1934 when Dal?, standing on a low table amid pen holders and inkstands, wore a strange costume bearing large-scale reproductions of Millet's L'Angelus. 45. See Sigmund Freud, Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, trans. James Strachey (New York: Basic Books, n.d.), p. 64; Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, trans. James Strachey (New York: W. W. Norton, 1977), p. 327. 46. In "On the Transformation of Instincts with Special Reference to Anal Erotism" (1917), Freud also describes anal erotism in relation to the pregenital anal-sadistic phase in which the "faecal mass, or as one patient called it, the faecal 'stick,' represents as it were the first penis, and the stimulated mucous membrane of the rectum represents that of the vagina." See Character and Culture, ed. Philip Rieff (New York: Collier Books, n.d), p. 206. 47. In The Secret Life of Salvador Dali (pp. 344-345), Dal? relates an amusing story about one of his "performances" in London, probably in 1936, in the course of which he appeared in a diving suit and a special helmet and almost suffocated. In the early and futile attempts to pry off the helmet, a hammer was used to strike the bolts and make them turn. One assumes the effect was quite close, in reverse, to that envisaged by Dal? with regard to Sade's helmet. 48. This was a jacket to which were attached fifty glasses of peppermint (according to Dali, a liquor endowed with aphrodisiac properties) in which flies had been dipped. Analyzing this object, Dal? states: "This jacket can mathematically gain from the paranoiac critical combinations and games of numbers likely to be called to mind by the anthropomorphic arrangement of the glasses. The St. Sebastian myth offers a similar case: pain which can be objectified and measured due to the number and positions of the arrows." See Cahiers d'Art (L'Objet), no. 1-2 (1936): 57. The thought behind this object can be summed up in the following simple formula: the pain inflicted on St. Sebastian is measurable; pain being equated with eroticism, this jacket should enable one to control the distribution of erotic stimuli over one's body.</page><page sequence="19">132 RES 23 SPRING 1993 Figure 7.

Courtesy of Editions Albert Skira and ? 1992 DEMART PRO ARTE / ARS, New York. Photographs of this exploit illustrate Dali's Minotaure essay on the "?tres-objets" (figs. 8 and 9). Were Dali's conception to remain on this level of costuming and performance with erotic overtones, the notion of the "?tres-objets" would have been just another bizarrerie. Here again, however, Dali's theory, as promulgated in "Apparitions a?rodynamiques des '?tres-objets,'" parts with the artistic practice, leaving it far behind. The essay also bears witness to the fact that Dali's ideas cannot be set apart from the manner of their exposition. Dali's humorous-philosophical tract sets the nondifferentiation of people and objects in the context of an all-pervading vision of "culinary" softness. Coming at the very beginning, the pivotal statement "Beings-objects are the foreign bodies of space" is followed by an extended conceit evoking the vertiginous joy and gratification involved in the extraction of "com?dons," or blackheads, out of the pores of the nose (Oui 2 43). The "slippery," new, and aerodynamic com?don dextrously squeezed out of the flesh of the nose represents for Dal? the "ultraconcrete personalization of what is most vital and most lyrical in contemporary moral, scientific and artistic thought" (44). Dal? illustrates this notion by resorting to the</page><page sequence="20">Finkelstein: The incarnation of desire 133 space of modern physics as a viscous "appetizing feast," he equates it with the flesh of the nose and sees its objects and people in terms of these aerodynamics. He then equates this "physical aerodynamism" of space, its objects and people, with what he calls "moral aerodynamism," and represents the latter with an example of a sadistic objectlike manipulation of a "little old lady in an advanced stage of decrepitude," who should be exposed "dressed like a toreador, an herb omelette placed on her previously shaven head; the omelette will tremble following the continuous wagging of the little old lady. One may also place a twenty franc piece on the omelette" (48). Including Dali in his Anthologie de l'humour noir, Breton made special mention of the proposal quoted above in his introductory essay, explaining Dali's "spectacular" fantasy as resulting from the "infantile non-differentiation regarding the knowledge of objects and that of beings."49 This view, however, is as limiting as that suggesting that Dali, in this essay, was merely promoting his vision of "culinary softness" in terms of "Mae West Modern Style." Indeed, under the surface vision of orality there lurks a very insistent expression of masturbatory and anal concerns, apparent primarily in the images and in the connotations of some of the words and expressions used. Thus the "intimate act" of extracting the blackheads is described as the "spurting out of the pores of the nose, by a skillful and painful compression," with the words "spurt" (faire jaillir) and "compression" clearly referring to sperm and masturbation as well as to defecation. This connection of the anal and genital is also implied by the "neurotic ceremonial" intended to prolong "voluptuously" the action by the "deft failures" and the "hurried slowness" of the "manipulation," or prolong the "culminating moment out of which one draws the enigmatic pleasure contained in moral conflicts and mechanical elasticity." Once this act is over, it "plunges the spirit into an authentic regret and a most inconsolable desolation" (Oui 2 43-44). The French word "branlement" used by Dal? to describe the wagging or shaking of the old lady in his example for "moral aerodynamism" may also refer, in its slang connotation (se branler), to masturbation. The evocation of a "slippery, new and aerodynamic com?don" or "sleek and precious larva" provides an additional anal dimension. Consequently, the sadistic manipulation of the "?tre objet" in Dali's example holds a promise of encompassing the whole gamut of perversions and erotic concerns that he had previously applied to the idea of the Surrealist Object.

Indeed, Dali's "?tres-objets" essay bears in its terminology and general tenor a striking resemblance to Bataille's "The Use Value of D. A. F. de Sade," written in 1929-1930, and although the latter had not been published at the time, it may be assumed quite safely that Dali was acquainted with it to some extent. As Bataille declared in another essay, "Excavating the fetid ditch of bourgeois culture," he hoped to "see open up in the depths of the earth immense and even sinister caves where force and human liberty will establish themselves" (Visions of Excess 43). The use value of de Sade for Bataille lies in his unflinching view of humanity in this "fetid ditch" as polarized between two impulses, excretion and appropriation. To simplify Bataille's involved argument, appropriation, associated with civil, political, or commercial organization, is basically oral consumption of food but also the consumption of the products of man's activity. It is characterized by homogeneity implied, in the oral context, by the conventions of food preparation, or in the broader context by the identity "between the possessor and the object possessed." Homogeneity thus implies that man surrounds himself by identified elements and, in the philosophical sense, by classified series of conceptions or ideas (95-96). Excretion, on the other hand, is the expulsion of unassimilable elements of these appropriations. Notwithstanding its application to social revolution, as Bataille proposes in the later part of the essay, excretion is the creation of heterogeneous matter recognized as repulsive, filthy, or impure?what society attempts to transform or expel? associated with certain "religious facts" or the notion of the sacred. Excremental collective impulses, or "orgiastic impulses" as Bataille calls them, are established "in opposition to political, juridical, and economic institutions" (94). Bataille's evocation of excretion in human affairs deserves to be quoted extensively: Sexual activity, whether perverted or not; the behavior of one sex before the other; defecation; urination; death and the cult of cadavers (above all, insofar as it involves the stinking decomposition of bodies); the different taboos; ritual cannibalism . . . religious ecstasy; the identical attitude toward shit, gods, and cadavers; the terror that so often accompanies involuntary defecation; the custom of making women both brilliant and lubricious with makeup, gems, and gleaming jewels; gambling; heedless expenditure and certain fanciful uses of money, etc. together present a common character in that the object of the activity (excrement, shameful parts, cadavers, etc.) is found each time treated as a foreign body (das ganz Anderes); in other words, it can just as well be expelled following a brutal rupture as reabsorbed through the desire to put one's body and mind entirely in a more or less violent state of expulsion (or projection). The notion of the (heterogeneous) foreign body permits one to note the elementary subjective identity between types of excrement (sperm, menstrual blood, urine, fecal matter) and everything that can be seen as sacred, divine, or marvelous: a half-decomposed cadaver fleeing through the night in a luminous shroud can be seen as characteristic of this unity (94).50 It is superfluous to enumerate the similarities between this passage and Dali's evocation of the process of extracting the com?don as a preliminary to his conception of the "?tre-objet." His declaration that "beings-objects are the foreign bodies of space" can be seen now in its true perspective. This "space"?social, cultural, and philosophical?has become, in the reality of our time, as Dal? argues, "this good meat, colossally seductive, voracious and personal which presses at any time with its disinterested and soft enthusiasm the smooth fineness of 'foreign bodies' and also the bodies of 'beings-objects' which similarly are more or less foreign bodies" (Oui 2 45). The phrasing of this passage clearly reveals the less obvious meaning of Dali's statement and points to the indubitable excremental character of the "beings-objects." Indeed, Dal? evokes here the excretory expulsion of the "being-object" out of "space"?or the social and cultural order?as a heterogeneous or excremental matter. To cite Bataille again, sadism . . . appears positively, on the one hand, as an irruption of excremental forces . . . and on the other as a corresponding limitation, a narrow enslavement of everything that is opposed to this irruption. It is only in these concrete conditions that sad social necessity, human 50. This image of the half-decomposed cadaver may also be related to the notions of the "Spectre," as Dal? develops it in "Les nouvelles couleurs du sex-appeal spectral" (Februrary 1934), which have to do with decomposition, luminous rapidity, and so on {Oui 2, p. 34). As a side remark, I would also call attention to a number of paintings done by Dali in 1933-1935, with spectral figures (some of riders or riderless horses) that are very close in mood to the last lines of this passage.</page><page sequence="22">Finkelstein: The incarnation of desire 135 dignity, fatherland and family, as well as poetic sentiments, appear without a mask and without any play of light and shadow; it is finally impossible to see in those things anything other than subordinate forces: so many slaves working like cowards to prepare the beautiful blustering eruptions that alone are capable of answering the needs that torment the bowels of most men. Visions of Excess 92-93 Similarly, it is against "sad social necessity, human dignity, fatherland and family"51 that Dal? unleashes his excremental "?tres-objets." Like the objets psycho atmosph?riques-anamorphiques, they also imply a hidden underground action against the norms of society. What distinguishes the "?tre-objet" from the earlier conception, however, is the erection around it of a system of sadomasochistic impulses encompassing both "victim" and creator or perpetrator. Dali's example for "moral aerodynamism"?the sadistic manipulation of the "little old lady"?preposterous as it may be, would be considered by him worth examining, as he argues elsewhere with regard to a similar proposal, by token of its being one of those actions "liable owing to their irrationality to produce deep currents of demoralization and cause serious conflicts in interpretation and practice."52 The essay in which these ideas are expressed, "The object as revealed in surrealist experiment" (1932), although written before the "?tres-objets" essay, already offers some clues to the meaning of the "?tre-objet" and the moral standing that it implies. Speaking of surrealism's new "fears" replacing "our former habitual phantoms," Dal? locates them at "the limit of the emerging cultivation of desire" (91). There one can perceive the existence of another body outside of oneself, which is akin to Feuerbach's "second self." According to Dali, Feuerbach viewed the concept of the object as deriving from that of the second self.53 Dal? appears to make use here of Feuerbach's conception of religion as the means by which man projects an image of himself into some form of objectivity, and then makes himself an object to this projected image of himself. But although religion is the objectification of man's essence in ideal terms, Dal? sees that objective "other" as a terrifying "new dream" in which man's desire and perversions are vested. The perception by man of the objective "other" depends on an alienation from himself. As the "?tres-objets" essay makes clear, this is a two-way action in which one can objectify one's essence by making oneself into an object?an "other." On the other hand, another person who, given special characteristics through the use of masks and costumes, is being manipulated as an object becomes a projected image of the person performing this "fonctionnement." As already noted, in addition to its pronounced sadomasochistic implications, the "?tre-objet" as an excremental "other," in its actual manifestation in Dali's work, turns often on a denial of the representation of sexual differentiation and also entails a breaching of form and idea that is akin to Bataille's concept of "informe." In this, as was claimed at the beginning of this section, the "?tres-objets" follow the theoretical formulations involving the objets psycho atmosph?riques-anamorphiques. And like those others, they, too, subsume dialectics of appropriation and excretion, orality, and anality. It is in this light that one should view the "little old lady . . . dressed like a toreador" with the omelette placed on her shaven head, or Gala with the lamb chop on her shoulder. This indeed is the conceptual basis even for some of Dali's high-fashion adventures, especially the fetishistic hat made of a high-heeled shoe or the lamb chop hat designed in 1936-1937 for Elsa Schiaparelli.54 Dali also relates how he invented "dresses with false insets and anatomical paddings calculatingly and strategically disposed in such a way as to create a type of feminine beauty corresponding to man's erotic imagination; I had invented false supplementary breasts budding from the back?this could have revolutionized fashion for a hundred years, and still might" (Secret Life 291-292). 51. In La femme visible (1930), Dal? evokes the "abominable, ignoble native land where I lived my adolescence. ... Far from love. In the family, the parents' unventilated bedroom in the morning, releasing the hideous stench of uric acid, of bad tobacco, of respectability and of shit. . ." (p. 69). 52. In his proposal for an experimental scheme presented in "The Object as Revealed in Surrealist Experiment," Dal? includes an item wherein the action calls for luring a little old lady to come along and then to pull out one of her teeth (Surrealists on Art, p. 93). (It is always the little old lady?traditionally, "the witch," the nonsexual female?who suffers most in Dali's experiments!) 53. Dal? quotes Feuerbach to the effect that the "concept of the object is usually produced with the help of the 'you' which is the 'objective self.'" 54. Designs based on Dali's ideas, found in Schiaparelli's albums, are reproduced in a companion volume to the Centre Pompidou 1980 catalog, La Vie Publique de Salvador Dal?, publi? ? l'occasion de la r?trospective Salvador Dali au Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris: Centre Georges Pompidou, Mus?e national d'Art Moderne, 1979), p. 66.</page><page sequence="23">136 RES 23 SPRING 1993 The added breasts, a fetishistic transformation of the body, become, in fact, a threatening reminder of a missing phallus. However, as indicated before, the gap between theory and artistic practice found in earlier manifestations of the object also remains in effect here. But for those few, already mentioned, instances of costumes or "performances," which fall short of the theoretical conception, Dal? does not have much to offer in this direction. True enough, where human subjects would not do, Dal? took on mannequins. A docile substitute for a live person, like Bellmer's Poup?e, the mannequin could easily submit to sadomasochistic manipulation and lend itself to any attempt to transgress the limitations of the human body. Among Dali's creations in this genre, one may note the mannequin covered with small spoons placed in the Rue surr?aliste at the Exposition Internationale du Surr?alisme held in Paris in 1938, or the very effective Rainy Taxi shown in the same exhibition, with the two mannequins occupying it: a shark-headed driver and a blonde seated in the backseat amid lettuce heads and live burgundy snails. Dali's activity in this respect, however effective, is not too different from that of other surrealists and hardly more significant.55 An intriguing use of a live woman that approaches in some respects the "?tre-objet" concept may be found in his aborted project for the "Dream of Venus" (New York, 1939). What has remained of it are a few staged photographs executed by the German photographer Horst (fig. 10).56 Those, however, place the viewer in a different artistic perspective that requires a separate treatment. The use of live women as objects in Dali's later career may appear to be manipulative in the prurient sense, sensational and often commercially motivated. However, further examination would be required to determine whether such activities altogether lack any ideological or conceptual weight, or if they may be considered as a provocative response to the unlimited ability of modern culture to appropriate any transgression and exploit it to its own ends. "Apparitions a?rodynamiques des '?tres-objets'" is Dali's last sustained theoretical effort regarding the object. However playful its humorous-philosophical method may appear, it forms an integral part of Dali's evolving theory and represents, as has been seen, some of his overriding concerns and preoccupations. Together with "objets psycho-atmosph?riques anamorphiques," published the year before, the essay reflects the impasse he arrived at in his attempt to discover a theory that would sustain poetic and intellectual flights of the highest order and still furnish viable and practicable possibilities on the concrete level. Following this essay, there was hardly anything in Dali's writing on this topic except for his essay "Honneur ? l'objet!" which appeared in a special issue of Cahiers d'art (no. 1-2, 1936) devoted to the Surrealist Object. It is a mark of Dali's decreasing enthusiasm for the subject, however, or perhaps of the dwindling strength of his theoretical convictions in Figure 10. Salvador Dal? and Horst P. Horst.

There is nothing political about this examination of the swastika, "this supremely irrational sign," as Dal? refers to it, an "amalgam of antagonistic tendencies and movements. ..." But neither is there anything else to commend itself in this essay, but for the insight it offers into Dali's "paranoiac-critical" writing strategies. The Surrealist Object is brought in quite arbitrarily, and then Dal? has little to say about it but for a few rather well-worn notions. These may, however, also be seen as revealing, however inadvertently, the nature of the impasse reached by the theory of the object: "The Surrealist Object is impracticable. It has no other use but to make man march, to exhaust and cretinize him. The Surrealist Object is made only for honor, and it exists only for the honor of thought" (Oui 2 84). Dal? also unquestionably suggests that the Surrealist Object, "inflexibly determined not to allow itself to be manipulated further" (84), would be preferable?even in its "cretinizing" capacity?to the swastika, an "emblem of action, antisculptural, showing even in its morphology its unmistakable intention of really destroying everything for the sake of the object..." (82-83). At this stage, for better or for worse, exhaustion and "cretinization" take the lead, and the "honor of thought" becomes the sole object of Dali's theory.</page></plain_text>
