Its use can lead, among other things, to reductions in time cycles, reductions in costs, and improve- ments in quality. However, recent evidence shews that many conpanies using CADCAM are not achie- ving these benefits. A lot of information has been published on subjects such as the potential benefits of CADCAM and benchmarking procedures used in selecting a CADCAM system. Hcwever, these subjects are of little help to a company that has purchased a CADCAM system and is trying to use CADCAM profitably and in line with caipany ob- jectives . This paper proposes solutions to seme of the problems facing such conpanies. Topics include : the definition of CADCAM objectives? allocating CADCAM costs? necessary activities in implemen- ting successful CADCAM? supporting use of CADCAM? CADCAM as a tool for innovation. THE BENEFITS OF CADCAM IN THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY CADCAM has been used in the automobile industry since the early 1960s. It is now enplcyed ty car, truck, coach and motorcycle manufacturers as well as ty suppliers of all sorts of parts such as tyres, windscreens, headlights, fuel sensors, seats, spoilers, and engines . Within the overall design and rranu f actur ing engineering development cycle of a car, CADCAM can come into play as early as the styling stage. Hie geometry of the car body can be defined ty the system, and the car's appearance under different colour and lighting conditions examined. The majority of car manufacturers still produce a full-scale clay model of the car. This is digitised and the digitised points entered into the system's data base. They form the basis of the definition of the exact overall body surface geometry. This application is carried out with a 3D carpi ex surface geometrical nodeller. Special functions to analyse curve and surface properties such as curvature are used to ensure that surfaces are aesthetically pleasing and smooth. Wien the complete body surface has been correctly defined, the geometry model is generally checked ty using it to ISC machine a model of the car body in soft material. Once the external body shape has been defined, the interior body panels are defined. CADCAM geometric data is input to programs for structural analysis (e.g., to check the strength of a panel), kinematic analysis (e.g., to check the action of a door hinge), aerodynamic analysis, visibility analysis (e.g. rear mirrors), and space allocation (e.g., engine and passenger oaipartment layouts). CADCAM techniques are also applied to powertrain (engine and transmission) engineering. Itory major suppliers to the car industry also use CADCAM, in particular for the detailed design of parts that have been broadly specified ty the car manufacturer. The geometry data built up in the CADCAM data base during the design engineering process is transferred to the manufacturing engineers who design and manufacture the press tools for the body parts. CADCAM techniques are also used to assist NC programming of dies and moulds for other parts, to program (or to check the actions of) welding, painting, and assembly robots, and to design and manufacture fixtures and tools for car body assembly. THE BENEFITS OF CADCAM IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY" CADCAM techniques are used at many stages of the design and manufacturing engineering cycles of an aircraft. 2.1494 0096-736X/88/9602-1 494$02.50 Copyright 1988 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">870934 At the conceptual design phase, fuselage and wing geometry can be defined and held in the syst an' s data base. This geometry is then fed to aerodynamic and structural analysis programs and eventually becomes the basis of ISC programs to produce wind tunnel nodels. In more detailed stages of design, CADCAM techniques are enployed in defining the exact shape of the aircraft, in positioning antenna and radones, in space allocation studies, and in producing structural drawings. As interference checks can be made with the system, it is possible to build to a tighter tolerance. Improved geometry and documentation benefit subcontractors trying to understand a design. Parts lists are input through the system keyboard. The system is also used in defining the position and connections of the engine and the associated power system, the fuel system and the environment control system. CADCAM techniques are used in carrying out kinematic analysis of moving parts such as wing flaps, landing gear, and door mechanisms. The position and logic of the miles of wiring is decided with the assistance of the system. Three- dimensional anthropomorphic models built up in the computer are used in testing the freedom of movement of crew members. Clearance and vision can also be checked. Cockpit instrument panels are laid out with CADCAM. Tubing is designed taking care that sufficient clearance exists. In the manufacturing engineering area, process planning may be assisted by a computer-based system that is either part of the CADCAM system or closely linked to it. Users of the system generate part programs for machining centers and other NC-controlled machine tools. Structural parts are developed (i.e., flattened out) ty the system so that the flat shapes can be cut out of large sheets ty NC-controlled sheet-metal cutting machines. NC tube-bending machines form tubing to the required dimensions. Tbols, jigs, and machine tool fixtures are designed with CADCAM. Multilayer conposite parts and their forming tools can be designed with the system. NC-controlled quality control machines are programmed directly with CADCAM geometry, as are NC-controlled tapelaying nachines, robots, and electrical testing machines. UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE BENEFITS CCME FRCM CADCAM should be seen as a technique that allows automotive companies to inprove the quality, flow and use of engineering information. The often-mentioned benefits of CADCAM such as reduced cost, reduced time cycles and inproved quality are different manifesta- tions of this improvement in information quality, flow and use. Nfenagement should focus on ensuring that use of CADCAM results in such improvements. These will lead to substantial benefits that can, in turn, lead to competitive products and services. Che of the major benefits of CADCAM is the reduction of time cycles. This results from the reuse of data and from the increased speed with vhich sorte applications can be carried out. It can lead to a reduction in the overall product lead time. Since only one product model is used, (rather than several misinterpretable and retranscribed drawings) it is possible to improve the integrity of information and the quality of the product. Use of the computer's calculating power means that results can be more accurate - another dimension of improved quality. Another potential improvement resulting from the use of CADCAM is reduction in design cost (e.g., the same number of people doing the job quicker) and manufacturing cost (e.g. ty reducing over-engineering or ty improving the efficiency of production processes) . 2.1495</page><page sequence="3">The benefits that a oarpany achieves fran use of CADCAM should reflect the carpany 's CADCAM objectives. Many conpanies will not be able to simultaneously reduce costs and time cycles, whilst also increasing quality. In most cases, a choice will have to be made to pursue only one or two of these benefits . The actual benefits arising frcm use of CADCAM will therefore vary from carpany to carpany and fran function to function. The ira jor gains that many catpanies lock for are reduction of time, quality improvement and the ability to carry out tests that just were not possible before introduction of the system. Reduction of time is generally appreciated because it offers the possibility to create alternative designs within a given time period. Sometimes, however, for exanple at early stages of styling/design, it is used to reduce lead times. Quality improvement both produces a better product and results in a reduction of harmonizing and modification work at later stages. There are companies though, that do not attain productivity gains through use of CADCAM. Most outside observers would agree that the fault generally lies with tcp management's unwillingness to come to grips with CADCAM. This manifests itself in a lack of strategy, a lack of objectives, a lack of planning, a lack of the information required to base decisions on, failure to implement a suitable CADCAM organisation, failure to motivate CADCAM users, and so on. Father than dwell on the reasons for failure, it is more helpful to lock at some of the ways in which improvements can be made. SETTING OBJECTIVES AND ALLOCATING COSTS Unless tcp managers are fully ccmmdtted to the use of CADCAM, there is little chance of it being a success. Only top management has the global view of the company that is necessary to define carpany-wide use of CADCAM and its associated product def initiai data. Only they know the real objectives of the carpany. Without this knowledge, the objectives of CADCAM can not be defined, and without CADCAM objectives, its use will be a failure. Tcp management must ensure that a long-term CADCAM plan is develcped. Detailed implementation steps can then be planned within the framework of this plan ty lower-level managers. The costs associated with use of CADCAM are high. If conservative, short-term calculations are used to cost- justify purchase of CADCAM equipment, or to define the way in which users are charged for use of the system, then purchase and use of the system will often appear to be prohibitively high. Top management needs to be aware of this, and modify costing techniques accordingly . Middle management is often a major impediment to successful use of CADCAM. Marry middle managers, judged entirely on their performance in a small area of the company's activities, see CADCAM as a threat. Tcp management should adjust the goals of these managers to motivate them to support use of CADCAM, and consequen- tly to assist in meeting objectives. Tcp management's ccmmi tment to CADCAM must be well defined and highly visible, and be associated with active support of the staff directly involved in implementation of CADCAM. Mary managers still believe that low-paid, untrained personnel sitting at a CADCAM workstation automatical ly became skilled engineers. They don't. Oi the contrary, the most important productivity benefits occur when highly-skilled staff use CADCAM. NECESSARI ACTIVITIES IN IMPLEMENTING SUCCESSFUL CADCAM Unless a thorough analysis of a company's resources and requirements is made before a CADCAM solution is chosen, the wrong choice can easily be made. The analysis of resources and requirements, along with the objectives, provides the information necessary to define the required type and size of CADCAM solution. 2.1496</page><page sequence="4">870934 It is not possible to simultaneously apply CADCAM techniques to all opérations of the ccnpany. It is best to use CADCAM initially in those application areas where productivity gains are expected. This will help to build up a successful CADCAM image and cause CADCAM experience and knowledge levels to grow. A good foundation will thus be laid for the time when CADCAM is applied to areas where the potential for productivity gains is less obvious. Selection of the CADCAM system is an inportant activity during the early stages of CADCAM implementation. Among the most inportant factors in choosing a system are (i) that the hardware and software be relatively modern (otherwise they will soon be replaced fcy the vendor, a process that generally causes chaos), ii) that the geometric modeller be suited to the needs of the ccnpany, (iii) that it be possible to interface the CADCAM system to other systems in the ccnpany, (iv) that the data management functions of the system be capable of handling the creation, retrieval and modification of the models, drawings, standard part libraries and assemblies expected to be produced over the next five years within the capaný (v) that the user interface be acceptable to the capaný' s users, (vi) that the vendor has a track record of making significant developments to the system and (vii) that it be possible for the company to make small, oarpary-specific developments to the system. Training is one of the most inportant activities in the implementation and use of CADCAM, and yet it is one of the most neglected. Perhaps this is because it is so easy to cut the training budget to make "savings". People at all levels of the ccnpany need to learn about CADCAM. Tcp management needs to learn about the possibilities offered fcy CADCAM, about the resources needed for CADCAM, and about the changes that will result frcm use of CADCAM. Middle management needs to understand how it will affect their projects and people. Initially, users need to learn low to use the CADCAM system. Later, they must learn to use new versions and more advanced functions, thus becoming more efficient. SUPPORTING USE OF CADCAM It is throucji the users of CADCAM systems that productivity gains should actually occur. If the users don't want to use CADCAM, or don't know how to use it, then gains will not occur. All through the CADCAM implementation process it is inportant to communicate with them, and get them to participate positively. Vfell before a system is selected, users should be made aware of the fact that introduction of CADCAM is under discussion. They should be informed why CADCAM is inportant to the conpany, and what effect it will have en their jobs. They should be trained to use the system efficiently, and encouraged to extend their abilities. They should be shown that new career opportunities are opened up for them fcy CADCAM. Support staff should be available to assist users during the difficult initial stages of using CADCAM. Later, participation in user groups and user meetings will extend users' knowledge. Use of CADCAM should be monitored, and the results fed back to help users improve their performance. lhe ccnpany will need a CADCAM support team (headed fcy a CADCAM Manager) to support the system. The CADCAM Nfenager will have to be a good organiser and a good ccmnunicator, since this person will be in contact with the system vendor, top and middle management, and the users. Tcisk include making sure that the system runs efficiently on a day to day basis, making sure that interfaces are built and that suitable training is available, attracting new users to the system, developing a medi uri- term plan, etc. The CADCAM Nhnager has a key role to play and must be given the necessary resources for success to be possible. The "best" CADCAM system is of no use if it is not available to users. In all conpanies, support staff are needed as systems need to be maintained, workstation use needs to be scheduled, and data needs to be backed-up and nanaged. Before new versions are made available to the users they need to be thoroughly tested. 2.1497</page><page sequence="5">Procedures to use the system need to be put in place and documented. Project management procedures nust be modified to take account of use of CADCAM. A library of frequently used parts should be built up. Use of the system should be monitored. Results should be fed back to users to help inprove their performance, and used fcy tcp management to determine the future course of CADCAM implementation . Meetings should be held regularly between management, the CADCAM support team and the users to disseminate information and knowledge, and support the drive to successful use of CADCAM. CADCAM AS A TOOL FOR INNOVATION Innovation can occur almost aryvhere within an automotive company, Relatively few such companies are actually involved in "invention", and if they are, this activity takes place in the Research Department. Even in this Department though, a great deal of the work that is carried out is innovative rather than inventive. Innovation, in fact, takes place throughout the corrpany-in R+D, marketing, engineering, production and distribution. It needs to be a continuous process in each of these areas, driven ty basic research or by market requirements, and affecting both product and process. Innovation can take place with respect to the product or to the process. As far as the product is concerned it can affect parameters such as design, quality and functionality. Cn the process side it affects parameters such as technology, materials and quality. Recently, investigations have been carried out to identify characteristics of successfully innovative companies. The characteristics identified are somewhat similar to those required for successful use of CADCAM. They include : - - tcp management involvement - open, responsive, flexible management - a long-term corporate strategy supporting innovation - effective internal communications - an awareness of market needs - the use of interdisciplinary teams - the employment of talented and motivated pecple - the allocation of individuals to broad assignments rather than to individual, highly specific tasks. Mary of the successful, "high-tech" innovative carpanies are in industry sectors that are major users of CADCAM. The aerospace and automobile industries are typical examples. Examination of a list of reasons why innovation is becoming so important to automotive carpanies, and a list of expected gains frati use of CADCAM, shows many similarities betwen the two. Innovation tends to produce 'higher-value" products cheaper. Due to increasing competition and changing market requirements, innovation must also reduce the cycle time for these products. These correspond to the often quoted advantages of CADCAM - reduction in cycles, reduction in costs and increase in quality. Thus in the areas where CADCAM techniques can be used, they can be regarded as tools to assist innovation. CADCAM offers possibilities to parameterise parts, to increase use of standard parts and to build "product families". These are all activities used in incremental innovation (although they may be of little use in assisting "invention" ) . The possibilities for increased innovation would appear to be an additional bonus for the company that uses CADCAM techniques. 2.1498</page><page sequence="6">870934 In the same vay that it is useful to conpare characteristics leading to successful innovation with those leading to successful use of CADCAM, it is also useful to lock at sane of the obstacles to innovation. These include - too nan/ levels of management; - organisational rigidity; - impermeable departmental barriers; - restrictive job descriptions; - a reward system based on past requirements ; - an unwillingness to analyse the conpany ' s present and future; - a resistance to change; - a refusal to listen to clients and subordinates; - a tendency to over-restrict access to information. Again it is striking to note the similarity with CADCAM. Mary of the above attitudes (eg impermeable departmental barriers, organisational rigidity, a reward system based cai past requirements) are just as mudi obstacles to successful use of CADCAM as they are to successful innovation. SUMMARY It can be seen that CADCAM is not a "turnkey" product that can be boucjit off the shelf, but it is a technique that can only be used successfully if the correct environnent is created for it by tcp management. Creation of such an environnent starts with the definition of a CADCAM strategy Which nust concord with the carpan/' s manufacturing strategy and the overall corrpany-wide strategy. In addition to the often-mentioned benefits of CADCAM such as reduction in tine cycles and costs, and improvement in quality, it has been shewn that an increased potential for innovation is a further benefit for a conpany that successfully implements CADCAM. 2.1499</page></plain_text>
