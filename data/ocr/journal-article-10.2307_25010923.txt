SHAPIRO Old and New Heroes: Narrative, Composition, and Subject in Attic Black-Figure THE DEVELOPMENT OF NARRATIVE technique and pictorial composition in Greek art cannot be separated from changes in the repertoire of its subject matter, since how a story is told is always to some extent affected by what story it is, and certain stories naturally lend themselves to certain types of composition.1 To take an obvious example, the disposition of sculpture on the Parthenon reflects a logical relationship between subject and composition. The Panathenaic procession-an event comprising a great many figures who move through time and space-decorated the continuous Ionic frieze along which the viewer also had to move in order to take in the entire scene.2 The subject of each of the two pediments-the Birth of Athena and the Contest of Athena and Poseidon-is a single, narrowly focused event, witnessed by a number of subsidiary figures. All this could be understood at once by a viewer at the correct vantage point, the apex of the triangle helping to focus his attention on the main action. The metopes have as their principal subjects four monumental battles-Greeks and Amazons or Persians, Gods and Giants, Greeks and Centaurs, Greeks and 1.

Each subject seems so perfectly suited to the space it occupies that it is at first hard to imagine any other arrangement. But the use of some of the same subjects on other temples in other positions, for example the Trojan Battle pediments at Aigina, the Centauromachy and Amazonomachy on the Bassai frieze, or the Centauromachy on the Olympia west pediment, remind us that the subject matter may suggest a type of composition, but does not absolutely deter mine it. The object of this paper is to examine some changes in narrative art in Athens during the formative period of its development, the first two-thirds of the sixth century, in relation to changes in the mythological repertoire favored by Attic artists. Most of the evidence will necessarily come from vase-painting, since sculptural narratives, though an important influence on painters as I shall argue, are in this period very few, and other media that carried mythological scenes elsewhere in Greece, such as bronze fibulae in Boeotia, ivory plaques at Delphi and Sparta, or bronze shield bands at Olympia, were not produced in Athens. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first, the repertoire of mythological subject matter of Attic black-figure is surveyed, with special atten tion to significant changes that took place in the second quarter of the sixth century.3 Though representations of the same myths in non-Attic art are fre quently adduced for comparison, the focus is on the continuous and coherent evolution within Attika. In the second part, I consider a variety of factors that relate these changes to both intellectual and artistic developments. I I begin with the premise that an almost complete shift in the stock of myths on which Attic vase-painters drew took place in the period about 560 ? 10 years. Thus I distinguish two sets of myths: "old scenes," which are popular in the earliest black-figure, in some cases reaching back to Protoattic, but start rapidly to disappear by about 550 and are almost totally absent from the most productive half-century of black-figure (and from early red-figure), 550-500-though some reappear in the latest black-figure, after 500, or in red-figure of the fifth century-and "new scenes," which first occur no earlier than 570, more often close to 560, and remain steadily popular to the end of the century and beyond. This framework implies a "transitional period" of about two decades (570-550), 3. The figures used here are based on the Mythological Indexes of J. D. Beazley's ABV and Paralipomena (hereafter Para) and on F. Brommer's Vasenlisten zur greichischen Heldensage, 3d ed. (Marburg, 1973; hereafter cited as Vasenlisten3), supplemented wherever possible with recently published additions.</page><page sequence="3">116 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 during which old and new scenes occur side by side. This leeway allows for the difficulty of dating most vases with absolute precision4-it is always hard, for example, to say that an object must be dated 560 and cannot be as late as 555 and for the incomplete state of our evidence, since we have only a small fraction of the original output of Attic potteries, and a new find will sometimes change the picture considerably; and as well for the obvious fact that such changes do not happen overnight. Rather, the occurrences of any myth in vase-painting (assuming a statistically significant number), if plotted on a graph against time, are likely to follow a "battleship-shaped" curve, gradually reaching a peak of popularity, then petering out over a period of one to two decades, or more.5 For each of the individual heroes and myths catalogued here, the lifespan and period of greatest popularity has no doubt often been noted by others. But it seemed nevertheless worthwhile to try to assemble a summary of all the data in one place, to facilitate an overview of the full range of mythological vase iconog raphy in the period under discussion and to serve as a basis for the observation of patterns and trends. In each instance the myth's popularity in contemporary non Attic art, represented primarily by Corinthian vase-painting and Peloponnesian bronze shield bands, is briefly noted.6 There are nine myths or myth cycles that comprise the old scenes. 1. BELLEROPHON AND THE CHIMAIRA This myth appears on twelve Attic vases earlier than 550 and on only two after 550.7 The earliest are several still in the late seventh century attributed to the Bellerophon and Chimaira painters.8 In later black-figure, the Chimaira and 4. A radical challenge to the entire chronological framework of Archaic Greek art has been mounted by David Francis and Michael Vickers in a series of papers, e.g., M. Vickers, "Dates, Methods and Icons," in Images et society en Grece ancienne (Lausanne, 1987) 19-25. For a rebuttal, see J. Boardman, "Dates and Doubts," AA 1988, 423-25. 5. On the use of the battleship-shaped curve, as it applies to all archaeological material, see James Deetz, Invitation to Archaeology (Garden City, N.Y., 1967) 27. 6. For Corinthian I rely primarily on H. Payne, Necrocorinthia (Oxford, 1931; hereafter cited as Payne). D. A. Amyx, Corinthian Vase-painting of the Archaic Period (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1988), unfortunately appeared too late to be used here. For the shield bands, and many other general observations on Archaic iconography, I refer to E. Kunze, Archaische Schildbander, Olympische Forschungen 2 (Berlin, 1950; hereafter cited as Kunze). 7. This and all the myths discussed in this section are treated in two relatively recent studies of early mythological representations: Klaus Fittschen, Untersuchungen zum Beginn der Sagendarstell ungen bei den Griechen (Berlin, 1969; hereafter cited as Fittschen); and Hans von Steuben, Friihe Sagendarstellungen in Korinth und Athen (Berlin, 1968; hereafter von Steuben). Most are also discussed and illustrated in two indispensable books by Karl Schefold: Frihgriechische Sagenbilder (Munich, 1964; hereafter FS), and Gotter- und Heldensagen der Griechen in der spatarchaischen Kunst (Munich, 1978; hereafter GHG).

Since the story is told briefly by Homer (Iliad 6.155-83), where Bellerophon is said to be a native of Ephyre (Corinth), it is not surprising that the earliest depictions are in Corinthian art. As we shall see, several of the old scenes seem to have entered Attic vase-painting under the influence of Corinthian models, and it may be significant that their decline in popularity coincides with the end of the manufacture of Corinthian export pottery. 2. PERSEUS AND THE GORGONS This is by far the most popular of all mythological scenes in early black figure.'1 It occurs in several versions, from a more complete one, with Perseus, the beheaded Medusa, her sisters in pursuit, and sometimes additional figures like Hermes and Athena, to excerpts, without Perseus or, less often, without the Gorgons. Since the Gorgon was a nearly ubiquitous figure in Greek art from the Orientalizing period on, it is sometimes difficult to say whether, when shown alone, she is meant as an excerpt from the Perseus story or simply as a decorative or apotropaic element. Of those scenes that present a full narrative-Perseus in the act of beheading Medusa or the ensuing chase-fifteen can be dated before 550 and nine in the second half of the sixth century. The drop-off is not as striking as in the case of Bellerophon, but several factors should be taken into account. Preserved black figure vases produced between 550 and 500 outnumber those earlier than 550 by roughly three to one, so that proportionally the decline after 550 is much steeper than the absolute figures suggest. In addition, there are eighteen vases with one or more Gorgons earlier than 550, many of which, though Perseus is absent, clearly allude to the myth. One of these is the great Nessos amphora in Athens (Fig. 1).12 There are none of this type that I am aware of after 550, until the latest black-figure of the early fifth century. Like Bellerophon, Perseus is popular in Corinthian art, though the only Peloponnesian representation of the beheading of Medusa occurs on a shield band. 3 It is more difficult to argue that the myth entered the Attic repertoire from Corinth or elsewhere, since the Protoattic 9.

ARGONAUTIKA Scenes from the Voyage of the Argo and related events are extremely rare in Archaic Greek art, both in Athens and elsewhere.15 Only two episodes are depicted with any frequency: the Harpies, whom the Boreads chased away from the dinner table of Phineus,16 and the Funeral Games for King Pelias.17 One excerpt from the Games, the wrestling match of Peleus and Atalante, is an exception, in that it occurs both in early black-figure and on several early red figure vases of the Pioneer Group (late sixth century).18 The three early Attic vases range from the end of the seventh century to about 560, and there are a few Peloponnesian examples that also fall into this period. After the mid-sixth cen tury these scenes disappear, the Funeral Games for good, to be replaced by other Argonautika episodes in fifth-century red-figure.19 4. THE KALYDONIAN BOAR HUNT This myth is second only to that of Perseus in popularity in Attic black-figure before the middle of the sixth century and occurs far more often in Athens than in any non-Attic ware.20 Of the Attic vases, eighteen can be dated earlier than 550 and only three after 550.21 The lifespan of the myth is noticeably shorter than that of other old scenes, since, at one end, it does not occur in Protoattic or the very earliest black-figure (the first is probably on a dinos from the Agora of about 580-570),22 and at the other, the three late vases all belong to the third 14.

THE THEBAN CYCLE The term "Theban Cycle" denotes a set of stories comprising the mythical history of that city over several generations,27 and so not all necessarily interre lated, as in the Argonautika or the Trojan Cycle. Several of these stories were represented in Archaic Greek art, but only one with any frequency: the Depar ture of Amphiaraos. There are six Attic black-figure versions of this episode before 550 and three later.28 Altogether, thirteen Attic vases with Theban stories can be dated earlier than the mid-century and five after. The other myths include the Death of Eriphyle (once, early),29 the Sphinx with Theban Youths (thrice, early),30 the Departure of Adrastos (twice, late),31 Tydeus and Ismene (once, early),32 the Slaughter of the Niobids (once early),33 and the Death of Aktaion (once, early).34 Two Theban stories have earlier models in Corinthian vase painting, the Departure of Amphiaraos and Tydeus and Ismene, but the others do not.

ODYSSEY Surprisingly, only two of Odysseus's many adventures were illustrated in the Archaic period: the Blinding of Polyphemos (Fig. 2), with the subsequent escape from the Cyclops' cave (Fig. 3), and Circe's Witchcraft, turning Odysseus's men into beasts.35 Between these two episodes there are eight Attic representations earlier than 550 and only four between 550 and 500, though the Cyclops story, as well as the Sirens episode, becomes enormously popular on very late black figure oinochoai and lekythoi.36 Both the blinding and the escape scene occur in Protoattic,37 earlier than any Corinthian version, but about contemporary with the Argive Aristonothos krater.38 A recently published fragment by Kleitias (ca. 570) and another in the collection of Herbert Cahn, both with the escape from the Cyclops, help bridge the gap between the Protoattic example and the latest, about 550.39 Circe occurs on only two early black-figure cups of the mid-sixth century,40 though she too later reappears on late black-figure lekythoi.41 The scene does not occur in Corinthian art and in fact is very rare outside Attika altogether.42 7.

PROMETHEUS FREED BY HERAKLES The representations of this myth50 are unusual in several ways. They do not occur at all outside Attika, with the possible exception of a Late Archaic black figure cup that may be Boeotian.51 In Attika, this is the only one of Herakles' adventures that is popular in early black-figure but not in the period 550-500, which is otherwise the heyday of Heraklean scenes. There are six representations between the late seventh century and about 560,52 and none later, except for the possibly Boeotian cup just mentioned and an Attic black-figure cup of the early fifth century.53 Nor does the scene recur in red-figure, as do most of the old scenes. The scene seems clearly to be an Attic invention, and a rather early one, since two of the vases are by or near the Nettos Painter.54 9.

Let us now look at the new scenes, those that first occur during the years 570-550 and will account for the bulk of vases that have a mythological scene down to the end of black figure.

The Nemean Lion, which will become the most popular in art of all Herakles' labors, first occurs on several Siana cups by the C-Painter and Heidel berg Painter, about 560.60 The subject had appeared by 600 on two shield bands and soon after on several Corinthian vases,61 but outside Athens never enjoyed anything like the popularity it had in Attic black-figure. B. The Lernaean Hydra is first seen in Attic black-figure on a recently published kantharos fragment dated 570-560 and then on several Tyrrhenian vases of about 550.62 Earlier in the sixth century, at Corinth, this is probably the favorite of all Herakles' adventures, with over a dozen extant examples.63 C. The Erymanthian Boar first appears in two tondi by the Heidelberg Painter of about 560.64 The scene is not represented in Corinthian vase-painting and is extremely rare outside Attika.65 D. The Keryneian Hind occurs earliest on a recently published cup dated 560-550 and, perhaps about the same time, on a Tyrrhenian amphora.66 This episode never became as popular in black-figure as those listed above and does not occur outside Attika. A related subject, possibly a confusion of the Hind labor and the Struggle for the Tripod, in which Herakles and Apollo wrestle over a deer, appears first a few years later, on a plate close to Lydos.67 E. The Amazons, whom Herakles battles on hundreds of black-figure vases, though the girdle of Queen Hippolyte that he sought is never shown, appear first on a lekythos and two Siana cups, all dated 560-550.68 The myth is 60.

In two important articles, T. H. Carpenter has presented strong arguments that the traditional chronology of these vases is too high and that most should be dated in the period ca. 560-530: "On the Dating of the Tyrrhenian Group," OJA 2 (1983) 279-93; and "The Tyrrhenian Group: Problems of Provenance," QJA 3 (1984) 45-56. One of Carpenter's most cogent arguments in the earlier paper is that the traditional chronology gave the Tyrrhenian painters too much credit for introducing new sub ject matter to the vase-painting repertoire. Here Tyrrhenian vases will be mentioned only when a sub ject is securely attested on other vases that are unmistakably earlier than the mid-sixth century as well. 63. Vasenlisten3 81; P.

The Apples of the Hesperides are far more popular in Attic red-figure of the fifth century than in black-figure of the sixth, but a recently published cup in Bern by Nearchos is now the earliest known depiction, dating to about 560.70 Like several other of Herakles' labors, the episode is found only in Attic art. G. Geryon, the triple-bodied monster whom Herakles fought in the Far West, on the way to the Garden of the Hesperides, first appears on an early work of Lydos, the hydria in the Villa Giulia, of about 560.71 There is a much earlier representation on a Protocorinthian pyxis, and a shield band from Delphi also antedates Lydos,72 but again the myth is popular only in Attika. In this instance it seems clear that a literary work of the early sixth century helped inspire the series of Attic vases, Stesichoros's Geryoneis.73 H. Kerberos is a very popular figure in Attic black-figure after about 540, as well as in early red-figure. No earlier example was known until a Siana cup by the C-Painter of about 560 appeared on the Swiss art market a few years ago (Fig. 4).74 This episode may now join the large group of Herakles scenes that first appear in Attika soon before the middle of the sixth century. A Corinthian depiction and a Lakonian one would be about contemporary with the earliest Attic.75 Among Herakles' other adventures and parerga, several are more popular in Attic black-figure than many of the Twelve Labors. In fact, it seems likely that the canonical twelve had not yet been fixed in the sixth century and that this happened only with the metopes of the Zeus Temple at Olympia, about 460.76 I. The Fight with Kyknos may, like the Geryonomachy, owe its popularity in large part to poems of the early sixth century, another lyric of Stesichoros and the pseudo-Hesiodic Shield of Herakles.77 The earliest Attic representations are 69.

The Wrestling Match with Acheloos is a relatively uncommon scene that begins in Attic black-figure in the decade 570-560,80 and, like several others, is preceded by a single Corinthian example.81 K. The Busiris Story belongs almost exclusively to Attic red-figure, but one of the two known black-figure versions is early, on a cup by the Heidelberg Painter, about 560-550.82 There are no Corinthian representations, and the three non-Attic examples all appear to be East Greek, including a well-known Caeretan hydria, and a little later than the Heidelberg Painter's cup.83 Like the Geranomachy, this myth clearly had its roots in Ionia. L. Herakles' Struggle with Apollo over the Tripod is extremely popular in Attic black-figure of the last quarter of the sixth century, as well as in early red figure of the same years, partly under the influence of the east pediment of the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi.84 Curiously, however, there is one much earlier painted example, on a pyxis of about 560,85 which is contemporary with the earliest non-Attic versions.86 Not much later than this early pyxis comes the earliest instance of a variant theme, Herakles and Apollo struggling over the Hind.87 M. Herakles' Capture of the Twin Kerkopes, a rare comic episode, deco rates about ten Attic vases, the earliest of which is an unpublished fragmentary Little Master cup of about 560 in a private collection.88 The subject had ap peared first in Corinth, soon after 600.89 N. Herakles' Introduction to Mount Olympos, whether on foot or, more usually, in a chariot, is a favorite subject of Attic black-figure, much less so in 78.

Boardman has shown that the earliest versions are those with all the participants on foot, about 560-550, and he ascribes the change to the version with a chariot to the influence of Peisistratos's return from exile in a chariot conducted by a costumed "Athena."91 These fourteen episodes do not by any means exhaust the repertoire of Herakles' adventures in vase-painting, though they account for the vast majority of preserved vases. There are two episodes (neither of them among the Twelve Labors) that had been popular well before 570 and will be discussed below;92 of those that first appear later than 550, only one occurs in significant numbers, the Cretan Bull.93 Others of the new scenes are as follows. 2. THE TROJAN CYCLE A number of Trojan subjects, a few derived from the Iliad94 but most from other parts of the Epic Cycle (though seldom the Odyssey),95 are first repre sented during the years 570-550, and of these several remain extremely popular in later generations. As we have seen, one episode from the Iliad (23.257-897), the Funeral Games for Patroklos, occurs only on two early vases;96 and a few scenes involving Achilles occur both early and late.97 A. Ajax Carrying the Body of Achilles is first seen on the Francois Vase, 570-560, and about a decade later on two cups.98 There are dozens of scenes in later black-figure of a warrior carrying a dead comrade that are probably in tended for Ajax and Achilles, though in the absence of inscriptions it is difficult to be certain.99 The scene is unknown outside Attika, except in an Etruscan imitation and on a shield band from Olympia.100 B. Achilles' Ambush of Troilos is one of the most popular Trojan subjects in both Attic and non-Attic art of the sixth century. The earliest Attic version is the remarkably complete scene on the Franqois Vase, which belongs to the type 90.

Diomedes never becomes an especially popular figure in Greek art and is often only recognizable on vases when his name is inscribed. The earliest Attic representations, both depicting the hero in his chariot, belong to about 560.107 Later black-figure vases show Diomedes' duels with Hektor and Aeneas.108 The duel with Aeneas is shown on a Late Corinthian plaque contemporary with the earliest Attic Diomedes vases.109 D. Hektor figures in several scenes inspired by the Iliad, such as the duel with Diomedes mentioned above. The only one that becomes fairly popular, however, is the ransoming of Hektor's body from Achilles by his father, Priam, first seen on several Attic vases of about 570-560.110 Another vase of the same date shows Hektor departing in his chariot.1' One very early non-Attic depic tion of Hektor is the well-known Rhodian plate of the late seventh century, where he fights with Menelaos over the body of Euphorbos.12 E. The lliou Persis comprises several incidents that may be combined into a single scene, usually chief among them the deaths of Priam and of Astyanax at the hands of Neoptolemos. Other episodes that are sometimes also included, or may occur separately, are the Rape of Kassandra by the Lesser Ajax and the Recovery of Helen by Menelaos. All these scenes occur first in Attic black-figure about 560, on a lekanis lid by the C-Painter and two early works of Lydos.113 Yet another important scene from the Iliou Persis, though much less often depicted, is the 101.

Some that begin twenty or more years later and then become favorites are the dice game of Achilles and Ajax,"18 Achilles and Penthesilea,19 and Aeneas carrying his aged father, Anchises.120 Virtually all Trojan subjects are far more common in Attic black-figure than in any non-Attic ware, with one striking exception, the Suicide of Ajax, which occurs only once in Attic but often in Peloponnesian art.12 Apart from Herakles' deeds and the Trojan Cycle, there are several myths mostly individual episodes rather than cycles-that also make their first appear ance in Attic art about 560 and remain popular down to the end of red-figure. Only one involves an epic hero, Theseus, while the rest deal either with the Olympian gods or with largely anonymous groups of participants. 3. THESEUS SLAYING THE MINOTAUR This is by far the most popular of all Theseus's deeds and one of the most frequent subjects of Attic vase-painting.'22 It does not occur, however, before about 560, on two early hydriai.123 A few years earlier, Kleitias had depicted another scene from Theseus's Cretan adventure, the hero with the Athenian youths and maidens meeting Ariadne on Crete, and he apparently repeated the scene on at least one other vase surviving only in fragments.124 But this subject was never taken up by later artists.

The slaying of the Minotaur had appeared on several Corinthian and Boeotian vases of the early sixth century and on an even earlier Corinthian gold plaque and Peloponnesian shield bands.125 4. THE BATTLE OF GODS AND GIANTS The earliest Attic Gigantomachies are on several vases dated about 565-560 from the Akropolis,126 one of which is signed by Nearchos, and another, a slightly later one, by Lydos.127 The Lydan version is quite full and already includes all the Olympian gods, except Ares, as well as Herakles.'28 A few years earlier the myth had been depicted on several Corinthian votive pinakes, now very fragmentary, and one other non-Attic vase at Eleusis,'29 but once the Attic series starts (cf. Fig. 11), the subject is very rare elsewhere.130 5. THE RETURN OF HEPHAISTOS TO OLYMPOS Like several of the subjects already dealt with, this myth first enters the Attic vase-painters' repertoire with the Francois Vase in the decade 570-560.3M It then continues to be popular through the sixth and fifth centuries, with about equal numbers of examples in black-figure and red. The scene occurs on a Corinthian vase two or more decades earlier than Kleitias's krater and in several other non-Attic wares during the sixth century.132 6. THE BIRTH OF ATHENA This myth,'33 which also occurs first in Attika in the work of Kleitias,134 though not on the FranCois Vase, is far more popular in black-figure than in red and is naturally an especially popular subject in the city whose patron deity Athena was. Yet there was an active Peloponnesian tradition of the Birth of Athena, possibly starting earlier than in Athens.'35 Within a few years after 125. See Payne 133 for the Corinthian representations.

BATTLE OF GREEKS AND AMAZONS The earliest Amazonomachies137 are those in which Herakles participates, mentioned earlier. 13 Contemporary with the early Attic vases of about 560 are a number from which Herakles is absent, even though, as Bothmer points out, they are in other respects very similar to the Heraklean Amazonomachies.139 8. BATTLE OF LAPITHS AND CENTAURS Most Centaurs in early Greek art140 are associated with one of the great heroes, Herakles or Achilles, but there is also the Battle of the Thessalian Lapiths with the Centaurs, which first occurs on the Francois Vase.141 It then appears on several vases of about 560-550142 and remains popular throughout black- and red-figure. Sometimes, as on the Francois Vase, Theseus is pictured in the Centauromachy as loyal friend of the Lapith Perithoos, but he is by no means the central figure in the story, and the episode does not seem to be regarded as part of the cycle of Theseus's deeds. 9. DIONYSOS AND HIS CIRCLE Dionysos and his attendant maenads and satyrs enter the repertoire of Attic black-figure as part of a story already mentioned, the Return of Hephaistos to Olympos, first and most fully depicted on the Francois Vase.'43 From this time on both the god and his thiasos are ubiquitous on vases, though seldom is there a recognizable narrative.144 One early and unusual example of narrative shows Dionysos introducing Poseidon to his future consort Amphitrite, on the island of Naxos. 145 This completes the repertoire of new scenes, which enter Attic black-figure shortly before the middle of the sixth century and among them account for most 136.

It remains to list one last group of subjects, those relatively few exceptions to the fundamental division into old and new scenes proposed here. I call these the "overlapping" scenes, those that begin to be represented in the early sixth century or before and continue in significant numbers after 550. 1. ACHILLES While the Trojan Cycle as a whole belongs almost entirely to the body of new scenes, Achilles is the one hero belonging to that cycle who interested Attic vase-painters from the very beginning.14 Three incidents are represented in Protoattic or early black-figure and also later. A. The Infant Achilles brought by his father, Peleus, to the Centaur Chiron is the subject of a well-known Protoattic amphora in Berlin147 and occurs next on a few vases of about 560-550.148 A related theme, Chiron at the wedding of Achilles' parents, Peleus and Thetis, appears on Sophilos's dinos in London and on the Franqois Vase, but nowhere else.149 The child Achilles occurs then fre quently in black-figure and about a half-dozen times in red-figure, mostly of the Late Archaic period.150 B. Achilles in His Chariot, preparing for battle, is a rare subject, appearing first on a kantharos of the Komast Group in the early sixth century, then on Nearchos's well-known kantharos from the Akropolis of about 560 and on a neck-amphora by Exekias, in the 540s.151 C. Achilles Arming, or receiving his new armor from his mother, is a sub ject of direct Homeric inspiration (Iliad 19.1-13). The first representation is on a lekanis of about 580, the next on several vases of about 560, and then the scene occurs in the work of the Amasis Painter, once more in black-figure, and often in red-figure. 152 D. Achilles' Duel with Memnon occurs first on a fragment from the circle of Sophilos not later than 570,153 then on vases by the Painter of London B76 and the C-Painter, perhaps a decade later. It is then popular on a group of Tyrrhenian neck-amphoras and periodically through the rest of the century.154 146. See D.

THE WEDDING OF PELEUS AND THETIS This scene is connected thematically with the Trojan Cycle,156 both because the bride and groom would become the parents of Achilles and because it was at this wedding that Eris instigated the dispute xtel xdakovS among the three goddesses, which would in turn lead to the Judgment of Paris and the Abduction of Helen.157 The wedding procession is the subject of two vases by Sophilos, probably in the decade 580-570,'58 and of the principal frieze of the slightly later Francois Vase. A very different version of the same subject, in which the bridal couple stand in a chariot accompanied by gods and goddesses, occurs certainly on a hydria of about 530159 and probably on several other vases of the same period on which the participants are not named. 60 We should, thus, better speak of a revival and a reformulation of an older scene than of a continuous tradition. As we shall see, this process of reformulation is particularly instructive for our understanding of the relationship between narrative and subject matter that concerns us here. An early, non-Attic version of the Wedding of Peleus and Thetis appears on a Cycladic amphora in Kavala of the late seventh century.161 After this, the scene is not known outside Attika, except on an Eretrian imita tion of Attic black-figure of 550-540.162 3. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS This is the third Trojan subject that occurs early in Attika and never ceases to be popular in both black-figure and red.163 The earliest depiction may be on a Protoattic fragment whose identification depends on the restoration of the frag mentary inscription AA[EEANAPOS].164 If the vase did show the Judgment of Paris, it is contemporary with the earliest non-Attic version, on the Corinthian Chigi Vase.165 But even if it did not, the subject was certainly represented well 155.

HERAKLES AND NESSOS Only two of the many Herakles stories that became popular in developed Attic black-figure had already occurred in the early sixth century or before.168 The combat with the Centaur Nessos, who had tried to abduct Herakles' wife Deianeira, is well known from two of the most celebrated early Attic vases, the Protoattic amphora in New York and the name vase of the Nettos Painter in Athens (Fig. 1).169 The former was painted well before the middle of the seventh century and is one of the earliest complex and easily recognized mythological narratives on an Attic vase. The latter belongs to the last years of the same century. Two other Protoattic examples are fragmentary,170 and a third complete version can be dated soon after 600.171 The subject is also popular at Corinth at this time.172 By the second quarter of the sixth century the scene is well estab lished in the Attic repertoire, though still subject to iconographical variants. Herakles had encounters with other Centaurs, such as Eurytion and Pholos, but Fittschen has convincingly established that all vase-paintings, down to the early fifth century, that show the death of a "frauenraubenden Kentaur" refer to the Nessos story.173 5. HERAKLES AND NEREUS/TRITON The distinction between the two sea monsters that Herakles encountered,174 Nereus and Triton, is not always clear. Brommer avoids the question by using the neutral designation "Herakles-Meerwesen" for all the scenes, but Ruth Glynn has recently proposed a simple and persuasive solution. On the earliest vases Nereus is a huge monster; later Triton is substituted after Nereus starts to be depicted in human form.175 For our purposes, however, both types may be 166.

The earliest vases can be dated about 590, with six placed by Glynn in the period 590-570.176 After 570 the scene becomes steadily more popular in black figure. The subject is rare outside Attika, occurring only on a very early Boeo tian imitation of Attic black-figure, an early gem, and a single shield band.177 These five subjects, three related to the Trojan Cycle and two belonging to the deeds of Herakles, are the only mythological scenes that occur in Attic vase painting both before the second quarter of the sixth century and throughout the rest of the Archaic period. This division of the repertoire of Attic black-figure into old, new, and over lapping scenes may also be discerned in the oeuvres of some of the more impor tant individual painters. The earliest identifiable artists, such as the Nettos and Gorgon painters, and those of the next generation, including Sophilos and the painters of the Komast Group, naturally paint both old and overlapping scenes, but none of the new. The chief artists active in the period 570-550-Kleitias, the C-Painter and Heidelberg Painter, the earliest painters of Tyrrhenian vases display the richest variety of subject matter, including old, overlapping, and new. Lydos is the first major figure who paints exclusively overlapping and new scenes, with a strong emphasis on the new. In fact he may well have introduced several of these, including Herakles' combat with Geryon.178 Lydos was certainly active by the 560s and quite possibly a bit earlier,179 a time when most of the old scenes were still current among other artists. Yet he did not paint a single one of them, which suggests that the disappearance of old scenes and the introduction of new ones was not accidental or capricious.180 Lydos must in some sense have perceived that certain subjects were old-fashioned and dying out, and particu larly that the future lay with Herakles, of whom he is especially fond, and other new subjects. II We have established that a nearly complete overhaul in the repertoire of Attic black-figure iconography took place in the course of the second quarter of the sixth century. The framework proposed here differs in some key points from that of Karl Schefold, who of all students of Greek art and mythology has 176. Ibid. 123. 177.

But since there are no other figures present, it is uncertain whether an excerpt from the Argonautika is intended.</page><page sequence="22">SHAPIRO: Old and New Heroes 135 devoted the most attention to the problem in recent years.181 Schefold would divide the mythological representations of the sixth century into three phases roughly equal in length, in each of which he sees not only variations in subject matter, but a distinctive narrative technique and ethos. Thus the first third of the sixth century (the "Solonian period") is for Schefold "epic," both because many themes come from the recently composed Epic Cycle and because the large, paratactic, many-figured compositions echo the narrative style of those poems. The middle third of the century is the "dramatic" phase, characterized by concen trated pictures of individual heroes, especially from the Homeric poems, while the last third is the "lyric," a natural evolution of the dramatic into more monu mental compositions, foreshadowing Early Classical wall-painting. The sharper break, then, is the one between "epic" and "dramatic" in the 560s (the Frangois Vase still belongs to the "epic") and corresponds approximately with our divid ing line between old and new subjects. In part the difference between Schefold's framework and that proposed here arises from the fact that he considers the output of all major artistic centers of the mainland, islands, and East Greece as a whole, while our observations apply only to Attika. As the century wore on and Athenian artists became increasingly dominant and independent (a phenomenon well recognized by Schefold), the differences between "Greek art" and "Attic art" were bound to become more pronounced. When we seek to account for such radical changes in the Attic repertoire, however, no obvious or all-encompassing explanation presents itself. The factors involved seem to me to be of two basic, though interrelated types: one, "psycho logical," that is, fundamental changes in the Athenians' perception of themselves and the world around them, taking place as their civilization evolved through its Early Archaic phase; and second, artistic, that is, changing principles of composi tion and narrative, perhaps under the influence of monumental art, which would in turn dictate changes in the choice of subject matter. NARRATIVE AND THE ARCHAIC MENTALITY In general, the reasons that have been adduced by most scholars belong to the first type, the psychological, but any attempt to formulate a single broad principle is immediately undermined by a few obvious exceptions. So, for example, it has often been noted that the old scenes show a consistent preference for monsters and animals, while the new focus on human protagonists.182 Certainly Gorgons, Cy clops, Kalydonian Boar, Chimaira, Pygmies and Cranes, Nereus, Harpies, and 181. Schefold's arguments are most conveniently summarized in GHG 271-84, and some are presented more fully in "Archfologisches zum Stil Homers," MH 12 (1955) 132-44; "Das ho merische Epos in der antiken Kunst," in Wort und Bild (Basel, 1975) 27-42; and "Poesie hom6rique et art archaique," RA 1972, 9-22. 182. GHG 272. On the similar preference for mythological subjecs with animal figures in early Corinthian art, see I. Scheibler, Die symmetrische Bildform in der friihgriechischen Flichenkunst (Kallmunz, 1960) 55.</page><page sequence="23">136 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 Sphinx all belong to the old scenes, while many of the new scenes have exclusively human, or at least anthropomorphic, participants: all Trojan subjects, Giganto machy, Amazonomachy, and several Herakles episodes (Kyknos, Atlas, Introduc tion to Olympos). Perhaps the most obvious exception, however, is the Minotaur story, one of the most popular of the new scenes. Also several of Herakles' animal combats (Lion, Hydra, Boar, Hind) and his encounters with Centaurs would seem to contradict this rule. Conversely, several old scenes that involved no animals or monsters, such as the Departure of Amphiaraos, disappear nonetheless. Despite these exceptions, there is surely some truth in the idea of a shift toward more anthropocentric subject matter. One proof of this is the great number of early black-figure vases decorated with nothing but animals and the Mischwesen (Sphinxes, Griffins, etc.) that are the legacy of the Orientalizing period of the seventh century. After about 560 such vases are increasingly rare. Another indication is the emergence in Attic black-figure, about 560, of a whole new class of subjects, the genre scenes drawn from the daily lives of the Athe nians: courtship, hunting, athletics, valediction, funerals.183 What these have in common with the new mythological scenes is that they are about people, men and women, not animals and fantastic creatures. A second psychological factor that has been adduced is a new interest in the deeds of individual heroes rather than in group activities.'84 Thus several of the old scenes-the Kalydonian Hunt, the Argonauts, the Battle of Pygmies and Cranes-involve large numbers of anonymous or weakly characterized partici pants. Among the new heroes, Herakles, Theseus, and several of the Trojan and Greek warriors (Achilles, Ajax, Hektor, Menelaos, Diomedes) are all strongly individual, both in poetic sources and in their artistic depictions. Obvious excep tions, however, are Bellerophon, Perseus, and Odysseus, individuals who all belong to the old scenes and disappear by about 550. It could be argued that the first two of these derive from old folk-tale motifs and are essentially colorless monster-slayers who would not lend themselves to the new interest in character ization. But Odysseus is such a highly individual and remarkably varied personal ity that it is hard to imagine, by this argument, how he could have lost his appeal for Athenian artists. PAINTING AND POETRY This naturally raises the broader question of epic and literary sources and their availability and influence on the repertoire of vase-painting. We know 183. There is no comprehensive survey of genre scenes in Archaic art, as of mythological. On hunting scenes, see J. K. Anderson, Hunting in the Ancient World (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1985) 17-29; on athletics, D. G. Kyle, Athletics in Ancient Athens (Leiden, 1987); on courtship scenes, G. Koch-Harnack, Knabenliebe und Tiergeschenke (Berlin, 1983); on funerals (which occur continu ously from Late Geometric but especially from the mid-sixth century), D. C. Kurtz, "Vases for the Dead, an Attic Selection, 750-400 B.c.," in Ancient Greek and Related Pottery, ed. H. A. G. Brijder (Amsterdam, 1984) 314-28. 184. See GHG 275, 284.</page><page sequence="24">SHAPIRO: Old and New Heroes 137 really very little about the spread and transmission of the epic poems, whether in written or oral form, during the eighth to sixth centuries, and all too often artistic depictions are adduced as primary evidence for the problem of transmission, so that the whole argument is quickly in danger of becoming circular. The terribly fragmentary and partial state of epic representations that happen to survive can at best be a very unreliable guide to the question of which epic poems became known in which artistic centers of Greece and when.185 Nevertheless, Schefold postulates that the first third of the sixth century witnessed the composition in written form of virtually the entire Epic Cycle, most likely the final version of the Iliad and Odyssey as well, which he would ascribe to Solonian Athens.186 Others would place at least some of the cycle somewhat earlier, still within the seventh century,187 but in terms of the iconographic tradition the difference may not be significant, since the stories themselves clearly circulated in oral form and in spired a few early depictions before they were written down. And in any event, the availability of many new epic poems in written form in the early sixth century may help account for the popularity of old scenes in Attic art of these years, but only makes their sudden disappearance after only a generation (one thinks again especially of the Odyssey) the more difficult to explain. ATHENIAN AND NON-ATHENIAN MYTH Yet another explanation, which can at best be only very partial, is that from the 560s there is a new preference in Athens for myths with specifically Attic associations, or for Panhellenic myths that are in some sense coopted by the Athenians as their own. In the latter category I think mainly of Herakles, the Panhellenic hero par excellence, who, though none of his important myths is set in Athens or Attika, is nevertheless more prevalent in Attic art after 550 than anywhere else in Greece, and later in Attic cult as well.188 Of the specifically Attic myths the most obvious newcomers are Theseus and the Minotaur (clearly here the monster motif is acceptable for the sake of the Athenian hero), the Birth of Athena, and the Gigantomachy, in which Athena usually plays a most prominent role. Another is certainly Ajax, the Salaminian hero at Troy, who first appears on the Frangois Vase, but is never a popular figure in vase-painting except in the work of Exekias.189 Panhellenic figures, aside from Herakles, would include a few of the Olympian gods who first appear in vase-painting in 185.

Some would say it looks as if Attic vase painters, so long under the influence of Corinth and other artistic centers, sud denly proclaimed their independence by rejecting the borrowed myths and creat ing their own repertoire.192 Here too there are exceptions, however: scenes popular in developed black-figure that had first appeared much earlier in Cor inth, such as Herakles' encounter with the Hydra and Achilles' ambush of Troilos. EXCURSUS: THE CHEST OF KYPSELOS AND THE FRANCOIS VASE To assess more accurately the validity of the premise that the abrupt shift in the repertoire of Attic black-figure represents a conscious emancipation from Corinthian and other outside influence, let us take a close look at the Chest of Kypselos (Fig. 7), as preserved in Pausanias's description (5.17-19), in the light of our observations on the changes in Attika.193 Though other parts of Greece produced occasional mythological narratives in the seventh and early sixth centu ries that could have been known to the Athenians, it is Corinth that, both in quantity of output and range of mythological subjects, represents the major center in those years (together with the "Argive-Corinthian" school of metal shield bands),'94 the only corpus of iconography even remotely comparable to the Attic that from the mid-sixth century superseded it. As a summation of the Corinthian mythological repertoire, the Chest of Kypselos offers us a kind of handbook to the full range of myths known to Corinthian artists at a particular moment. Unfortunately we cannot put an absolute date on this lost monument, but on both historical and archaeological grounds the dating can be narrowed to 190. On early cults of Dionysos in Athens, see F. Kolb, Agora und Theater (Berlin, 1981) 31 34 and passim. 191. See J. Travlos, Pictorial Dictionary of Ancient Athens (New York, 1971) 258; E.

Schefold, GHG 275, for example, notes that several of our old scenes, the Argonauts, the Kalydonian Hunt, and the Theban Cycle, were popular in Athens only so long as Athenian artists followed Corinthian models. 193. The fullest and most useful attempt to imagine the chest and its decoration is still that of W. von Massow, "Die Kypseloslade," MDAI (A) 41 (1916) 1-117, whose reconstruction is repro duced here. 194.

The ordering of scenes on the chest can only be regarded as random, with only occasional thematic links between adjoining subjects, and though Pausanias's description sometimes suggests an alternation of long friezes and metope-like panels, as von Massow reconstructed it, the format of most individual scenes is not clear. The breakdown in terms of the subject categories used for Attic art in this paper is as follows. Of the old scenes, five stories or parts of cycles are included: Meilanion and Atalante, from the Kalydonian Boar Hunt; the Departure of Amphiaraos and the combat of Eteokles and Polyneikes, from the Theban Cycle; the Funeral Games for Pelias, the Boreads chasing the Harpies away from Phineus's table, and Jason and Medea with Aphrodite, all from the Argonautika; Perseus chased by the Gorgons; and Odysseus and Circe. Of those subjects we have called overlapping there are two: Herakles battling Centaurs and the deeds of Achilles, once fighting Memnon and once, indirectly, in the scene of Thetis receiving the new armor from Hephaistos. The new scenes are well represented with the following episodes: three of Herakles' labors (Hydra, Geryon, and Ap ples of the Hesperides); Peleus and Thetis wrestling; and, from the Trojan Cycle, Menelaos and Helen, Ajax fighting Hektor, the Rape of Kassandra, the Judgment of Paris, and Agamemnon fighting Koon. Then there is a small assortment of subjects that are more decorative than narrative and those that have either no direct parallels at all in Attic art or occur only many decades later: Boreas and Oreithyia, Dike and Adikia, the Dioskouroi rescuing Helen,196 Apollo and the Muses, Zeus and Alkmene, women with mortar and pestle,197 Idas and Marpessa, Artemis as Potnie Theron, Dionysos, and finally a panoramic battle scene, the occasion uncertain, stretching across one entire frieze. The encyclopedic range of subjects, and especially the prevalence of those that are just coming into Attic art, argues against any extreme view of Athens trying to free herself from Corinthian influence. Only with some reservations can we accept that the old scenes in Attika came from the Peloponnese and disap 195. See E. Simon, in EAA 4 (1961) 427-28, s.v. Kypselos, Arca, di. She favors a date nearer the middle of the century, as does von Steuben 78. But if we accept an association of the dedication with the Kypselid family (Paus. 5.17.5), the date should not be after their fall from power with the death of Periander in 582. 196. This episode may be depicted on Attic black-figure vases of the sixth century, such as two by the Amasis Painter (ABV 153,4; 155,62) and an early hydria by Lydos (cf.

Dioskouroi (A. Hermary). The subject had almost certainly been shown already on a Corinthian vase a century earlier than the Chest of Kypselos: FS 39, fig. 9. 197. This motif occurs on an Attic black-figure amphora of about 530, Leningrad 2065; ABV 309,95; E. Bohr, Der Schaukelmaler (Mainz, 1982) pl. 116.

The correlation of episodes depicted on the chest with those in Early Attic black-figure is indeed striking, though the presence of several unknown in Attic art (the wedding of Jason and Medea, the combat of Eteokles and Polyneikes) is also noteworthy. As always, the paucity of preserved Attic vases, especially before ca. 560, warns against inferring too much from such correlations. It seems to me that the closest we may come to an Attic "encyclopedia" of mythology comparable to the Chest of Kypselos is the Francois Vase (Fig. 8).198 The two monuments are in fact likely to be extremely close in date, and in purely artistic terms Kleitias was clearly influenced by the fine Corinthian miniaturist figure style and fondness for superimposed friezes. But is his narrative style something radically new, as Schefold maintains, mirroring the cyclical epics formulated in Athens in Solonian times?'99 The search for a key to the narrative "program" of the Frangois Vase has engaged the interest and ingenuity of iconographers for several generations. For Schefold it lies in the confrontation of two parallel heroes, Achilles and Theseus, and in the unfolding of a cycle from the generation of Achilles' father, Peleus, to that of the Trojan War.200 In the most recent and learned interpretation, Andrew Stewart places Achilles and his family, and the theme of arete, at the center of an "intricate and subtle web of interconnections," which include the subsidiary theme of marriage and the god Dionysos as linking elements.201 Against such brilliant and seductive argumentation it may seem rather pedestrian and reaction ary to return to the view of an essentially random collection of subjects, and in dismissing the perceived connections as "overly sophisticated" we may risk doing an injustice to the artist. Nevertheless, I would argue that there is no more unified "program" on the Francois Vase than on the Chest of Kypselos, even if "random" is in this context a misleading word. None of the choices of subjects Kleitias made for his masterpiece is random, in the sense that each lends itself perfectly to the long friezes he wished to fill (with one exception to be considered presently) or, in the case of Ajax and Achilles, the Potnia Theron, and the Gorgons, the metope-like spaces on the outside of the handles. Furthermore, they are not random in that each represents either a subject at the height of its popularity in Kleitias's day (the Kalydonian Hunt, the Wedding of Peleus and Thetis) or one that Kleitias created with consid erable artistic imagination and narrative power (Theseus and the Athenians, the Return of Hephaistos, Troilos). That he proclaimed his independence from Cor inth by including themes of purely local Attic interest, made most specific and topical in the names of the youths and maidens in the Theseus frieze, has been 198.

On a vase with two hundred named figures, it is unavoidable that such links suggest themselves, since if we pursue genealogies and variant versions of myths far enough, practically every important myth has links to all the others. Thus, for example, the presence of Achilles' father, Peleus, in scribed, at the Kalydonian Hunt, and of Theseus, inscribed, in the Cen tauromachy, near other friezes devoted to those same heroes, is of course not entirely accidental, but neither is it very profound or subtle. Clearly Kleitias did not choose to depict a Centauromachy because of Theseus's participation in it, for Theseus is given no particular prominence in the ambitious composition. Though Peleus is prominent in the Hunt, because very near the Boar, a half-dozen others are equally so. Indeed, the most striking characteristic of the way Kleitias has formulated these scenes, as opposed to Late Archaic and Classical versions, is that no one hero is the focus of attention, but each plays a nearly equal role in the composition. "Teamwork" is important, not the individual. As far as a "program" is concerned, we are left with the one inescapable observation that Achilles is prominent on the Francois Vase, though there are far too many scenes unrelated to him for us to say that the vase as a whole is about Achilles. Rather, his impor tance only confirms what we were able to observe in our survey of all Attic iconography, that Achilles is the one epic hero who captured the imagination of artists well before the surge of popularity of the Trojan Cycle in the sixth century and the one hero who retained his unequalled popularity throughout that time. Once we free ourselves of the "unified program" approach, the Francois Vase may be seen to have much else in common with the Chest of Kypselos. Beyond the similar division into superimposed friezes, there is one striking correspon dence in the compositions. Unlike the other four friezes, which had multiple subjects lined up paratactically, the middle row on the Chest of Kypselos was devoted to a single subject: two large armies, mostly on foot but with some chariots. Pausanias suggests two fairly abstruse interpretations of the subject of this long frieze that he had heard from others, then tries his own hand as iconographer, proposing an even more obscure alternative, worthy of a Schefold or Simon, tying it to the genealogy of the Kypselids (5.18.7-8). On the Francois Vase, the middle and broadest frieze of the five (not counting the foot) is, like wise, the only one devoted to a single subject running all around the vase, also with some chariots and many figures on foot: the Wedding of Peleus and Thetis. We cannot in the end consider the Francois Vase "typical" of the cyclical style (with Schefold), or of Attic art of its time, or of anything else, for it is a unique object. It is not even a reliable guide to Attic iconography, when we recall a scene like that of the Theseus frieze on the mouth, which never occurs 202. E. Simon and M. and A. Hirmer, Die griechischen Vasen2 (Munich, 1981) 73.</page><page sequence="29">142 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 outside the work of Kleitias.203 We can perhaps say that, allowing for Kleitias's exceptional originality and unusual literary bent, it presents a cross section of the many possibilities open to Athenian artists in this transitional and stimulating decade of the 560s: stories of both gods and heroes; among the latter, stories focusing on a single hero (e.g., Theseus) or those presenting a vast tapestry of heroes in a common enterprise; stories belonging to the shared stock of myths known and depicted throughout Greece from the seventh century and those of specifically Athenian interest and even, perhaps, a timely relevance to history and politics of the time of Kleitias;204 stories for which older Athenian contempo raries of Kleitias had already provided the model and those that he created utterly new. These observations do not even begin to touch on other important aspects of Kleitias's narrative technique, such as the way the Troilos band combines in a continuous frieze chronologically distinct moments in the story. This issue has been well studied by others, especially Himmelmann,205 and is only relevant to our discussion in a tangential way, that is, as a solution to the problem of filling a long frieze. For all the other friezes on the vase, Kleitias chose subjects that, in good Early Archaic tradition, are infinitely expandable (or contractable) to fill the space available. Extra Lapiths and Centaurs, or boar hunters, or gods in proces sion, or satyrs and nymphs, or racing chariots, can always be added or subtracted as needed. But the story of Achilles' ambush of Troilos has a very specific and restricted cast of characters. It is by nature a "metope" composition, and to turn it into a long frieze, Kleitias turned to the remarkably bold and original device of opening up his narrative in time as well as space. It was an experiment that was then adapted by a few painters on a modest scale,206 but was perhaps too ingenious and eccentric to have much impact on the great mass of vase-painters. NARRATIVE, COMPOSITION, AND VASE SHAPE Since these "psychological" and literary explanations of the change from old scenes to new are clearly only partial (though no less valid for that), it seems worthwhile to consider factors of an entirely different order, by examining these same subjects not for their content or meaning, but as varieties of artistic narra tive and formal composition.207 This approach recognizes that Attic black-figure 203. I have suggested a new interpretation of this scene in a forthcoming paper, in New Approaches to Early Greek Art, ed. D. M. Buitron (National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990). 204.

Here too we will find that no one consider ation is sufficient to explain all the changes taking place or is without exception. First, as we have observed in several specific instances, there seems to be a fondness in Early Archaic Greek art for large scenes crowded with many figures, which later gives way to more strictly limited compositions with fewer figures. This development could be regarded as a kind of visual analogue of the change from stories of group activities to those of individual feats, discussed above. The earliest figural tradition in Attic art, that of Late Geometric pottery (Fig. 9), betrays a special fondness for large, undifferentiated groups, and I would suggest that many of the crowd scenes in early black-figure are the artistic descendants of these Geometric antecedents. The Geometric vases are of course mainly large funerary amphoras and kraters, on which the figures are quite small, but many: mourners at the bier, members of the cortege, warriors, dancers.208 During the century that intervened between Late Geometric and the intro duction of black-figure, Attic vase-painting experienced a radically different phase, Protoattic (Figs. 2, 3). There is relatively little extant pottery from this period, and much that is called Protoattic may not have been made in Attika at all, but on Aigina.209 What Protoattic we have is, stylistically, under a powerful Orientalizing influence that pervades all of Greek art in the seventh century, as well as influence from other parts of the Aegean, especially East Greece and the Cyclades. The vases are often still quite large, but this is the only obvious legacy from the Late Geometric. It is true that many of the themes of Protoattic allow a friezelike composition, but the figures are now much larger relative to the size of the vase, and as a result there are fewer of them.210 Also, they are vividly delineated, unlike the anonymous stick figures of Late Geometric. The Eleusis amphora is perhaps the best example (Fig. 2).211 The Nessos vase (Fig. 1), over half a century later, although in technique it stands at the beginning of the black figure tradition, in terms of composition and ethos marks the last of Protoattic. To be sure, in the repertoire of their subject matter, there is a good deal of continuity from Protoattic to early black-figure, as we have seen, but this in part reflects the fact that the iconography of Early Archaic Attic art was largely introduced from outside Athens. In composition, much early black-figure re vives the basic scheme of Late Geometric-large groups rendered on a small scale-while adding many refinements of style and technique learned in the 208.

Scheibler (supra n. 182: 54), who sees more a continuity from the friezes of Late Geometric to those of Protoattic than the differences, which seem to me to outweigh it. 211. Supra n. 14.</page><page sequence="31">144 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 interim, as well as a rich store of mythological narrative.212 The small-scale figures on a large surface, as most obviously on the Frangois Vase, have usually been linked to the influence of the Corinthian miniaturist style, but there is in fact earlier precedent for it in Athens itself. Some of the old scenes that bring together a large number of figures in a format more or less reminiscent of Geometric prothesis and ekphora scenes are the Funeral Games for Pelias or Patroklos, the Wedding Procession for Peleus and Thetis, and the Departure of Amphiaraos. Two more in which the figures are less neatly organized, but still numerous, are the Kalydonian Boar Hunt and the Battle of Pygmies and Cranes. About 560, the figures start to grow larger again, diminish in number, and take up more of the picture field, especially on amphoras, soon to emerge as the favorite shape of black-figure (Fig. 11).213 This is in part a concomitant of the elimination of much plant and animal ornament left over from the Orientalizing style, yet in the size of figures and shape of composition it actually looks like a return to the model of Protoattic pictures. Most of the new subjects lend them selves to two-, three-, or four-figure groups: Herakles and an opponent, perhaps accompanied by Athena or Iolaos; Theseus and the Minotaur; a duel of Trojan heroes. Apparent exceptions would be the Gigantomachy and Amazonomachy, but these move very quickly in the direction of excerpted small groups rather than the full complement of participants. For example, Lydos's Akropolis Giganto machy, which presents the fullest version of this myth known on a vase, is also perhaps the earliest, about 560,214 while after 550 the typical Gigantomachy has one or two pairs of combatants, often grouped around a single chariot (Fig. 11).215 Likewise, one of the first Amazonomachies, on a dinos in the Louvre,216 is also the most complete; later ones seldom have more than five figures.217 Closely connected with this change from larger, densely populated scenes to more narrowly focused ones is a change in the shape of the picture field, which can perhaps best be described in terminology borrowed from architectural sculp ture. The many-figured compositions of early black-figure are usually set on long, narrow bands, analogous to the continuous frieze of an Ionic temple. The same had been true of the figured scenes on Attic Late Geometric vases. One fundamental reason for this is that early Greek artists always put all their figures in the same picture plane, until the invention of "Polygnotan perspective" in the 212.

After about 560, there is an increasing preference for fewer figures on a roughly square (actually more often trapezoidal) surface reminiscent of the Doric metope.219 Here again there is a curious parallel between developed black figure and the Orientalizing period, balancing that between early black-figure and the Late Geometric. For it was in the course of the seventh century that the actual (i.e., architectural) metope came into existence. Such early examples as the painted metopes from Thermon in Aitolia,220 about 630, seem almost to be precursors of the metopal compositions of black-figure amphoras a century later. An even earlier forerunner is the early seventh-century relief pithos from Mykonos (Figs. 5, 6),221 whose square panels depicting scenes from the Sack of Troy could serve as a model for both the metope cycles of Classical Doric temples and the two- and three-figure compositions of mature black-figure. On other vases starting in the second quarter of the sixth century, a composi tion of three or more figures may fill a rectangular field that is not so attenuated as the old frieze arrangement, nor as nearly square as a metope, but is closest to a pedimental group, with a central figure or pair flanked by a small number of others. The space itself is not shaped like a triangular pediment, but the effect of concentrating attention on a central figure or group is similar. Here we may suspect some direct influence from sculptural pediments made to decorate tem ples or treasuries on the Akropolis in the 560s and after, the earliest architectural sculptures we have from Athens. These include the poros pediments for the Old Temple of Athena, as well as several smaller ones, such as the Hydra (Fig. 10) and Olive Tree pediments.222 Large portions of at least six pediments are pre 218. Best exemplified in Pausanias's description of Polygnotos's paintings at Delphi (10.25 31); cf. M. D. Stansbury-O'Donnell, "Polygnotos' Ilioupersis: A New Reconstruction," AJA 93 (1989) 203-15. For a reflection of this type of composition in vase-painting, cf., for example, the great Niobid krater, Louvre G341; ARV2 601,22; AJA 67 (1963) pll. 7-8. A rare exception to the principle governing Early Archaic art is Sophilos's dinos showing the Funeral Games for Patroklos, with the spectators on stepped bleachers: FS pl. VI. 219. Scheibler (supra n. 182: 49) also speaks of "frieze" and "metope" as the two basic forms of picture in Archaic narrative art, but would not include the panels of amphoras under "metope" because they are not strictly speaking square (59). 220. FS 35; pll. 18-21. 221. Supra n. 116. 222. R. Heberdey, Altattische Porosskulptur (Vienna, 1919), illustrates all the pediments. For more recent discussion, cf. M. Brouskari, The Acropolis Museum (Athens, 1974) 25-43; on the Olive Tree pediment, cf. B. S. Ridgway, The Archaic Style in Greek Sculpture (Princeton, 1978) 204. The Bluebeard pediment, with the triple-bodied, snaky-tailed monster, has not been satisfactorily ex plained, nor does it have any exact parallels in vase-painting; on the various theories, see Ridgway 200. The conventional dating of the Akropolis pediments was recently questioned by J. Boardman, Greek Sculpture: The Archaic Period (London, 1978) 154-55, who would lower some or all of them to the 540s. The latest attempt at a reconstruction of all the pediments of the major temple (the Old Athena Temple) is that of I. Beyer, "Die Reliefgiebel des alten Athena-Tempels der Akropolis," AA 1974, 639-51.</page><page sequence="33">146 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 served and, not surprisingly, those three with identifiable mythological scenes depict new subjects involving Herakles that were first represented in vase painting during these same years: his combat with Hydra and Triton and the Introduction to Olympos.223 The evolution from friezelike compositions on vases to "metopes" and "pedi ments" correlates well with changes in the repertoire of favored vase shapes, and it could even be argued that the invention of certain new shapes and the disap pearance of some of the old were at least in part the results of a need to accomodate different types of composition and, indirectly, different subject mat ter. A shape popular only in early black-figure down to about 560, for example, is the dinos, which allows for a long frieze of figures going all the way round, uninterrupted by handles.224 On the FranCois Vase, an enormous volute-krater, Kleitias tried painting very small figures, for such a large pot, and in this way was able to create many superimposed friezes, but this experiment was not repeated by others. Tyrrhenian amphoras do something like this, but generally only one band, at handle level, has a narrative scene. Lydos's great column-krater in New York adapts the continuous frieze to a larger surface, with much larger figures in keeping with the spirit of his generation,225 but is exceptional in that there are no panels; the single subject continues under the handles and all the way round. Like the FranCois Vase, this krater was a bold experiment that had little influ ence. After 550 the old-style miniature frieze survives occasionally on band cups and on the narrow necks of column-kraters,226 where it is, however, clearly subsidiary to the main picture panels. Metopal compositions are best suited to the large bellies of the one-piece panel amphoras that became so popular in the third quarter of the sixth century. Very rarely does a painter eliminate the panels to allow the composition to continue uninterrupted around the amphora.227 Other shapes that offer a roughly square field are the pelike and stamnos, both introduced later in the century.228 "Pedimental" groups will fit well on either the body or, on a reduced scale, on the shoulder of a hydria, the shape next in popularity after the amphora 223. If the Olive Tree pediment represented the Troilos story, as some have thought (cf. M. Heidenreich, "Zu den friihen Troilosdarstellungen," Mdl 4 [1951] 110-14), it would be another example. But I believe the subject is not narrative, but cultic, involving a priestess of Athena and the sanctuary of Pandrosos. Cf. J. M. Hurwit, The Art and Culture of Early Greece (Ithaca, N.Y., 1985) 245. 224. A good example is the name vase of the Gorgon Painter, Louvre E874; ABV 8,1; Simon/ Hirmer (supra n. 202) pll. 47-48.

From about 540, however, when the subject is depicted almost exclusively on amphoras and hydriai, the focus is rather on the bridal pair in their chariot, and the number of gods is reduced to five or six at most.234 A similar change can be observed in the Perseus myth. Early friezelike compositions, like the one on the dinos that is the Gorgon Painter's name vase,235 show the hero pursued (as on the Troilos band of the FranCois Vase the long frieze suits the spatial require ments of a pursuit), while the few examples after 550 tend to show the more concentrated moment of the decapitation of Medusa.236 This survey is by no means intended to account for all Attic vase shapes,237 which no doubt were designed in the first instance to suit particular functions, rather than as canvases for artistic narratives. But it does suggest that variations in the dimensions and proportions of the desired picture field were also a factor in the evolution of at least some of the standard shapes. CONCLUSION This paper has examined one aspect of the iconography of Attic vase painting, focusing mainly on a brief, though important, period, the second quar ter of the sixth century. During the more than three centuries that pottery with figured decoration was produced in Athens, an extraordinary range of subject 229. See W.

The forces that shaped the iconography of vase painting in the course of its long evolution are extremely complex. Those factors that seem most important for the period under consideration here are the influ ence in Athens of non-Attic art, the changing temperament of audiences, as reflected in the appeal of different types of stories and characters, and the development of narrative techniques along with esthetic preferences, as in the size and shape of pictorial composition. The latter in particular deserves atten tion, because it has not usually been thought of as a potential determinant of iconographical change. Other factors scarcely mentioned here, though of crucial importance in other periods, are the availability and impact of literary sources, the influence of other art forms, such as drama, the interests and temperament of individual artists, and the historical and political climate. Insofar as the Greek myths are a reflection of all the most serious concerns of Greek life and thought, the visual expression of those myths, like all of Greek culture, was subject to a continual process of growth, change, refinement, and questioning. In Greece, when a myth reached a version that was no longer open to reinterpretation or variant forms, it was dead.
