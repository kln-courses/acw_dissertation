<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ART OF EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA James Willis Gallery, San Francisco October 20-December 31, 1987 The James Willis Gallery is to be congratulated for its exhibition of art from eastern and southern Africa. The overall quality of the selection was good and the variety intriguing, from tiny spoons to huge grave markers. Even the installation was exciting, each piece being spotlighted against a brightly colored wall in a dimly lit space. The exhibition was particularly rich in works of art from Mozambique. The most striking piece was an early Yao helmet mask in the form of a male head with full, sensuous lips and high cheekbones. The smooth planes of the face were offset by the rough texture of real, curly hair inserted into slits made on the scalp, a hallmark of Mozambique art. Another Makonde helmet mask illustrated how an African culture can borrow forms from a European culture without losing its own identity. According to the story accom- panying the mask when it was acquired, some local people making a rare trip to a nearby town in the early twentieth century saw a white policeman in a pith helmet directing traffic. Awed by his ability to stop and start vehicles with a simple hand gesture, they em- bodied the policeman's assumed power and energy in a mask carved in his likeness. The back of a chief's chair from Kenya had an openwork representation of a supernatural anthropomorphic figure carved so that it would appear to embrace the occupant of the chair with its protective powers. The object was carved out of a solid piece of wood in a tour de force of craftsmanship. Also notable was a Mahafaly commemora- tive grave post from Madagascar. It was more akin in style to the art of southeast Asia than that of southeast Africa, which is not surpris- ing since the island was settled by peoples from Indonesia. Numerous other interesting but less im- pressive objects, including a Ndebele bead- work ceremonial skirt, a collection of spoons, and several war clubs, made up the balance of the exhibition. A Nguni staff was entwined with carved snakes that appeared to move around the piece in a writhing serpentine dance. Mashona, Zulu, and Swazi headrests tempted the viewer to caress their warm- looking smooth surfaces, acquired through years of use. A powerfully stylized female figure made by the Zulu exuded a surprising energy for a statue only 48 centimeters high. A Karamajong wig from Kenya of rather recent date bristled with feathers. One came away from the exhibit somewhat frustrated by the lack of information provided about the customs and symbolism of the many peoples of eastern and southern Africa. A map indicating the location of the peoples represented would have been enormously helpful. Since no labels were in evidence, a descriptive list of these pieces with pertinent data would also have been a very welcome addition. Instead, each work was numbered to correspond to a checklist available at the re- ception desk. Unless the viewer was an Afri- can art expert, the pieces became merely ob- jects to admire without any reference to their function or ritual meaning. Nevertheless, the exhibition was well worth a visit. It was refreshing to encounter many pieces from traditional African contexts rather than the usual mediocre material that abounds on the art market these days. Emma C.
