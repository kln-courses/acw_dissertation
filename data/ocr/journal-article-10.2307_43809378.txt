Gordon Kaufmans last book (in terms of both most recent and final), Jesus and Creativity , continues a theme he has been developing for years. It goes something like this: The traditional Christian metaphors for God (i.e., creator, lord, and father) portray some sort of cosmic person beyond the world, acting within it. Unfortunately, the rise in modern science and its subsequent explanations of the cosmos make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain traditional, personal metaphors for God. Simply put, the findings of modern science, combined with our postmodern mindsets, lead us to consider thinking of God, not as the creator , but as creativity. Kaufmans focus in this book is to apply this radically immanent view of reality to Jesus. For Kaufman, images for Jesus (like images for God) are denied the status of brute givens, either in the biblical texts or the historical church doctrines; instead, they are viewed as inventive interpretations developed within particular historical moments. For Kaufman, it is the theologians job to rethink Jesus-language in light of her present-day situation. So, what does that mean for theologians living in the 21st century? Kaufmans Christology is based on the distinction he makes between "Jesus-trajectoryj" and "Jesus-trajectory2." Stated simply, Jesus-trajectoryj is about the divinity of Jesus Christ while Jesus-trajectory2 is about the historical phenomenon that surrounds the man Jesus who is from Naza- reth. Let me describe a few features of each. The story of Jesus-trajectoryj is known by most of those familiar with the Christian tradition and Kaufman believes it is expressed in four significant steps: 1) Jesus baptism, his preaching about the coming kingdom of God, performance of healings, and his crucifixion, 2) Jesus appearance to the disciples after his crucifixion, 3) the biblical texts claim that Jesus was the incarnation of God on earth, 4) the official church doctrine where Jesus is given status alongside God the Father and the Holy Spirit (the Trinity). Kaufman notes that the implication of Jesus- trajectory ] is immense because now "apart from Jesus, God is ultimately inscrutable mystery - a mystery that had, however, been unveiled in and through the person, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus" (p. 13). Obviously, this vision is thoroughly anthropo- morphic and anthropocentric - a serious problem for Kaufmans theology.

Kaufman turns to Jesus-trajectory2 as a means of main- taining Christological ideas in light of God as creativity. This alternative "is the sequence of creative historical events beginning with Jesus' baptism, ministry, death, and resurrection, and then continuing on creatively through human history all the way to the present" (p. 16). This viewpoint gives explicit attention to the person of Jesus and his astonishing influence in the minds of those around him. The focus is taken away from the actions of the creator God in and through Jesus and shifted to the amazing creativ- ity that spread throughout the world after Jesus' life, death, and resurrec- tion. By shifting to an interpretation that God is creativity, Kaufman believes he is able to modify the anthropomorphic language associated with Jesus as God to a process version where Jesus' impact is through crea- tivity in history. Kaufman has been attacked in the past with claims that he has attributed to God the most horrific events in history via creativity. When Kaufman argues that God is creativity, he is accepting that the evolutionary processes are responsible for producing the greatest beauty and the most obscene repugnance in the cosmos. So, should God be identified with enhancive or destructive creativity? In this book, Kaufman makes clear that "Creativity unqualified, therefore - the divine creativity as such - does not provide an adequate model of how we human should live and what we should be try- ing to do" (p. 22). Shifting to Jesus' creativity, Kaufman argues that Jesus represents, at least in the Christian tradition, a place for humans to seek moral normativity. For Kaufman, Jesus has normative significance, not because of a type of "otherworldly authority but because, "[the] thor- oughly human Jesus provides us with a picture of profound appeal, a pic- ture in terms of which we may be drawn to measure and judge our own humanness and humaneness" (p. 32). The Jesus story is important because it reveals something about the mystery of God as creativity. Jesus-trajec- toryj stabilizes Jesus' significance on an immutable foundation, a founda- tion that collides with current scientific understandings of the world. Jesus-trajectory2 embraces the evolutionary picture of the universe and notes the mysterious creativity present throughout. Jesus' life, death, and resurrection are noteworthy, according to Kaufman, not because of some supernatural being breaking into reality; rather, there is significance here</page><page sequence="3">1 00 Book Reviews / Worldviews 12 (2008) 91-107 because Jesus "may still inspire us to strive toward creating a new and bet- ter world" (p. 97). A vital task, indeed. Those that have followed and admired Kaufmans work over the decades will find this book agreeable, even though many of his points are redun- dant on past works. Those that struggle or disagree with Kaufmans notion of God as creativity will not be persuaded to alter their viewpoints. Actu- ally, most will likely find Kaufmans ideas here predictable. One might expect that a book with this title would offer a robust Christology, albeit one with Kaufmans theological take - he even states several times that this is his intention. Unfortunately, there is very little here to judge as a serious Christology. Instead, Kaufman has offered a further description of creativ- ity and how it tangentially informs our notions of Jesus. A more apt title would have been Creativity and Jesus . That said, Kaufmans continuous challenge to traditional theology should be affirmed. His is a voice that has not been lifted up to the degree it deserves. There is a legacy here that can- not be ignored, and Jesus and Creativity is a fitting conclusion to a laudable career.
