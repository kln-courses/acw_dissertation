<plain_text><page sequence="1">Challenging Formalism: The Implications of Contemporary Cultural Theory for Historic Preservation Kenrick Ian Grandison K. Ian Grandison teaches landscape architecture at the University of Michigan's School of Natural Resources and Environment in Ann Arbor. He studies college campuses in the Deep South, particularly explor- ing how historically black campuses record the history of race relations in that region in the postbellum moment. In addition his work raises theoretical and methodological questions regard- ing the incorporation of multicul- turalism in discourses on the built environment. He is currently working on a book that brings together this research. Tentatively entitled "Land- scapes from the Bottoms: The Black College Campus as Cultural History," the book is under advance contract with Johns Hopkins University Press as part of the series "Creating the North American Landscape." Abstract: Contemporary cultural theory has taken hold in a wide range of academic disci- plines such as literary studies , anthropology , and history , and has succeeded in challenging con- ceptions of ''culture33 that once circumscribed these disciplines 3 intellectual endeavors. No longer do we hear literary critics indiscriminately expound on K culture33 as (cthe best that has been thought and said in the world 33 (to recall Matthew Arnold's phrase) or insist on this notion of Ci culture33 as the universal basis of their criticism. Instead , academia now operates with a grow- ing awareness of multiculturalismi forcing disciplines to engage the histories and identities of groups heretofore not recognized as contributing to history. In the field of historic preservation , however, attempts to embrace multiculturalism are hindered by a continuing desire to valorize a canon: a static group of cultural products considered to be e' great.33 "High33 cultural assumptions still predominate as the basis of discourse in historic preservation; theorists and practitioners consciously and unconsciously continue to insist on the canon as a standard. Historic preservation therefore is left with a dilemma: it tries to expand the canon to include the once ignored places, but at the same time desires to leave unquestioned the assump- tions that originally led to the exclusion of these places. This essay seeks to elucidate these assumptions, showing how high cultural ideas have persisted in the field and more generally within discourses of the built environment. Challenging formalism in these discourses, the essay sets the stage for further critical work, especially regarding the theory and practices of historic preservation. Contemporary ory poses a formidable cultural the- ory poses a formidable challenge to the discourses of historic preservation and more generally of the built environment by interrogat- ing conventional assumptions about what constitutes "culture." In con- trast to the idea of culture as "the best that has been thought and said in the world," in Matthew Arnold's words, contemporary cultural theo- rists advocate a politically-engaged form of analysis that is oppositional in that it aims at uncovering the ways in which "culture" has been mobi- lized historically to control society in the interest of the powerful. These critics show how history is always told from the perspective of some political orientation - most frequently from the viewpoint of those already pos- sessing political and economic power and social status - and argue that the project of the cultural critic should be to put forth the perspectives of the most disempowered groups in society - women, racial and ethnic minorities, poor people, and other subjugated "others." While it is clear that contempo- rary cultural theory has affected his- toric preservation - most notably in its attempt to embrace the new social history - the oppositional project of unveiling the politics of the discourse has not taken hold. Contemporary cultural critics challenge formalism, which insists on the authority of high cultural forms and the need to pre- serve these forms.1 They question the canonical assumption that the body of "great" literary, musical, architec- tural, and landscape architectural forms and the geniuses and patrons associated with them provide the moral and aesthetic standard of soci- ety. The modern importance of this concept of culture was inaugurated most prominently by the British poet and critic Matthew Arnold more than 125 years ago and remained largely unquestioned as the dominant assumption of cultural analysis until it was challenged by critics in the 1950s. Today, however, this conception of culture still escapes full interroga- tion in the field of historic preserva- tion. As in the larger society, high cul- tural assumptions continue to prevail despite attempts to embrace "multi- culturalism," which seeks to acknowl- edge the histories and identities of those groups previously not recog- nized in historic preservation. Thus, we try to canonize examples of places considered to represent such histories and identities, and in so doing we cre- ate a dilemma: we aim to expand the canon to include the once-ignored places, but at the same time desire to leave unquestioned the assumptions that led to their original exclusion. Rather than serving as a vehicle for rethinking the canonical discourse of historic preservation, multicultural- 30 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="2">ism becomes a gesture of tokenism that merely includes selective multi- cultural forms within the scope of historic preservation. Drawing on literature in the area of architectural and landscape architectural criticism and historic preservation, my essay explores these issues. I will investi- gate how high cultural assumptions continue to operate in the discourses of architecture, landscape architec- ture, and historic preservation, and how related formalist concepts such as the "artifact" and the "genius" con- tinue to escape interrogation in these fields. By way of providing background for subsequent discussion, the essay begins by attempting a brief history of the development of contemporary cultural criticism in opposing earlier formalist approaches to culture.2 Contemporary Cultural Theory3 Scholars of contemporary cul- tural theory generally agree that its beginnings can be traced most clearly to the work of British intellectuals, most notably Richard Hoggart's The Uses of Literacy (1957), Raymond Williams's Culture and Society: 1780-1959 (1958) and The Long Revolution (1961), and E. R Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class (1963).4 First published in the 1950s, these works sought to understand post-war British society. In particular, they broadened the scope of serious cultural analysis to encompass traditional British working-class life, which was being increasingly fragmented as a result of burgeoning "mass culture." In so doing, these works set the stage for interrogating the narrow Arnoldian assumptions of culture. Background: The Arnoldian- Leavisite Tradition.5 In his influential work Culture and Anarchy (1869), Matthew Arnold articulated a theory that would permeate British intellec- tual life for nearly a century. Respond- ing to what he implied was the anar- chy and confusion of Victorian Eng- land,6 Arnold recommended "culture [emphasis mine] as the great help out of our present difficulties; culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know on all the matters which concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world" (Arnold 1883, p. xi). Far from validating the variegated cul- tural forms of all classes, races, eth- nicities, and genders, Arnold con- flated culture and civilization and defined them in opposition to bar- barism and ignorance. The project of "great men of culture"- as Arnold referred to the select few in society who pursued this total perfection - was a social one: to be "true apostles of equality" (Arnold 1883, p. 38), apostles whose passion for "sweetness [beauty] and light [intelligence] . . . must be imperfect [cannot be satis- fied] until the raw and unkindled masses of humanity are touched with sweetness and light" (Arnold 1883, p. 37). For Arnold, the best that has been thought and said in the world becomes sacred knowledge, a Bible of civilization that could provide the moral compass to anchor the "ends for which freedom is to be desired" and to counter-balance "our idolatry of machinery." Culture in this canon- ical sense becomes the means by which all contemporary social, eco- nomic, and political contests might be arbitrated, and the critic becomes a member of a priestly caste "who works for sweetness and light, works to make reason and the will of God prevail" (Arnold 1883, p. 37). In Arnold's view, the cultural critic bears the responsibility of serving society not only as the judge and police, but also as an apostolic agent to carry the sacred knowledge of culture to the masses.7 As Arnold's notions spread gen- erally throughout Western culture, other British critics, Frank Raymond Leavis and Leavisite critics of the journal Scrutiny, updated and advanced this theory of culture to meet the anxieties of the twentieth century. The belief that the ideal cur- riculum of a public school should include, say, "art" appreciation courses or that a public radio station should carry "classical" music is a legacy of Leavisism.8 In his work Mass Civilization and Minority Culture, pub- lished in 1930, Leavis wrote about the birth of "mass civilization," which he saw as precipitated by the expansion of industrial capitalism and the asso- ciated passive consumption of mass commercial culture by the urban and industrial working-class. Blaming mass civilization for the supposed col- lapse of the authority of Arnold's great men of culture, Leavis echoed Arnold's construction of these men as a select few who are worthy of dis- seminating refinement and enlight- enment; to Leavis they are a "minor- ity" upon whom "the discerning appreciation of art and literature depends" (Leavis 1948, p. 143). He writes: Upon this minority depends our power of profiting by the finest human experience of the past; they keep alive the subtlest and most perishable parts of tradition. Upon them depend the implicit standards that order the finer living of an age, the sense that this is worth more than that, this rather than that is the direction in which to go, that the centre is here rather than there. (Leavis 1948, pp. 144-145) Like Arnold before him, Leavis is most concerned about preserving the values of the past in a moment that feels to him anarchic and thus disrup- tive to traditional forms of civiliza- tion. In the midst of what he per- ceived as a social crisis bought on by the post-war expansion of Fordisim's mass production and consumption,9 he argues for a "centre," a right "direction in which to go." His appar- ent anxieties over the loss of a proper order stand in marked contrast to Arnold's self-confident assertion that the purveyors of culture are "apos- tles" and that those lower on the social hierarchy are "raw and unkin- dled masses of humanity" (Arnold 1883, p. 37). To Leavis, the changes inaugurated by industrial capitalism are "so catastrophic" that hierarchy itself is threatened: "parents are helpless to deal with their children" (Leavis 1948, p. 146). The influence of Arnold's "men of culture" was now being under- mined by the "revolutionizing] of social custom" (Leavis 1948, p. 146) that accompanied mass consumerism. They were thus prevented from enacting their traditionally-assigned disinterested role to referee, guard, and transfer to society the system of habit and valuation, which for cen- Grandison 31</page><page sequence="3">turies previously had been passed smoothly from generation to genera- tion and enforced from the social elite down to the lower ranks. Leavis writes that . . . the minority is now made con- scious ... of a hostile environ- ment [It] is being cut off as never before from the powers that rule the world It is not merely that the power and the sense of authority are now divorced from culture, but that some of the most disinterested solicitude for civiliza- tion is apt to be, consciously or unconsciously, inimical to culture. (Leavis 1948, p. 164) It is clear that what Leavis fears is commercialization, which he sees as inimical to high culture and civilized refinement. Mass culture, however, could be seen as representing the democratization of taste, a goal that could be seen as contradicting high culture. What dominates in mass cul- ture is what most people desire and can afford to buy. Leavis, however, views the masses - the vast plurality of working-class people - as a passive engine of industrial capitalism. Because he views the masses as inca- pable of determining what is good for them, they will always direct culture in the wrong direction. In Arnoldian- Leavisite discourse, the struggle against the mass commercialization of culture is always conflated with an anxiety over the rise of the working- class, racial minorities, and others whose interest in having a voice in expanded democracy is seen as reduc- ing public taste and consumption to the lowest common denominator. Thus, Leavis uses Henry Ford as an example in launching his appeal to the cultured minority in defense of civilization: Are we then to listen to . . . Henry Ford's . . . admonition to cease bothering about the inevitable future? That is impossible. . . . [If] we care at all about the issues we cannot help believing that, for the immediate future, ... we have some responsibility. (Leavis 1949, p. 170) So it was that the cultured minority of a late modern England, now past its prime as the supreme global power, sought to arm itself actively to resist the bewitching power of mass culture on society. Mere apos- tolic fervor could no longer match the appeal of consumerism and its agent, the emerging mass media. The ideals of an "organic society" were now threatened, perhaps irrevocably.10 Leavisites proposed conscripting no less than the instruments of govern- ment, in particular the public educa- tion system, to disseminate the values and taste that comprised Arnold's notion of "culture." "Sweetness and light" now existed in the form of a restricted canon of literary works of "the great tradition," works such as by those Shakespeare, Austen, and Hardy, which were considered suit- able in building the moral and aes- thetic sensibilities of the masses to resist the unhealthy manipulations of commercial culture. Against the utilitarianism of industrial capitalism, Arnold's con- struction of culture was of doubtful value. Increasingly, "culture" seemed to be less relevant to a society focused on the materiality of industrial capi- talist production. The cultural critic, therefore, as a matter of urgency, believed that he had to reassert the relevance of culture in this setting as the moral and aesthetic standard by which society could form mature citi- zens and so ward off the threat of spiritual collapse. Culture was no longer just a leisure activity for a cul- tured minority, but rather became an essential aspect of mass society. If they could not return society to its supposed organic mode in which elites taught their inferiors in tight, controlled communities, the next best thing for cultural critics was to corral the powerful instruments of the state in the interest of refine- ments and enlightenment. Beyond Arnold and Leavis: Contem - porary Cňtique.11 The Arnoldian idea of culture dominated cultural analysis until the 1950s, when critics such as Hoggart, Williams, and Thompson challenged it. Raised in working-class families between the two World Wars, this younger generation of scholars held a different relationship to the class structure than did their pre- decessors. Mass culture, they felt, threatened not only high culture, but also the traditional communal culture of the urban and industrial working class, institutions like the pub. Working-class culture was being frag- mented in this moment for a number of reasons, as Simon During explains. First, after the Second World War, Britain had developed into a welfare state fostering a full employment economy with an increasing percent- age of jobs being provided by the gov- ernment sector. Increased immigra- tion from the former colonies meant that the most undesirable jobs could be filled by immigrants. Second, ever- expanding mass production resulted not only in a continuing decline in the number of skilled workers, but also corresponded with the increasing affluence of the masses. This, along with the increasing democratization of education, expansion of state rehousing programs, and continuing development of mass communication, especially via television, began to dis- mantle working-class culture, a cir- cumstance, the new cultural critics felt, that Leavisism probably exacer- bated (During 1993, pp. 3-4). Both "low" culture and "high" culture were now considered endangered by "mass" culture. While these critics did not totally dismiss Arnoldian ideas of cul- ture, they set the stage for its interro- gation. This challenge occurred not only because they acknowledged working-class culture as worthy of serious cultural analysis - as Hoggart does in what could be described as an early instance of multiculturalism - but also because they began to point out the political dimension of culture. Implicit to the work of Thompson, for example, is the assertion that tradi- tional British working-class culture was not merely "a way of life," but was also strongly political and conflic- tive in character.12 Similarly, when Williams, in analyzing the category of culture, advocated the recoupling of the idea of culture and the idea of society, he challenged the Arnoldian assumption that culture is transcen- dent, that it is above the history and politics of society.13 Hence, these crit- ics began the overt political mission of contemporary cultural criticism to uncover the political function of cul- ture.14 In the 1970s, for instance, crit- 32 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="4">ics returned to the concept of hege- mony - which sees invisible systems as enabling a minority elite to domi- nate society - as a basis of cultural analysis.15 The French cultural histo- rian Michel Foucault revived this idea when he argued that culture func- tions as an instrument of the modern liberal state, as a form of government through which conforming citizens are produced. Similarly, he politicizes the concept of "subjectivity," which declares that all knowledge is consti- tuted from particular points of view. Thus, Foucaulťs theory interrogates not only the supposed objectivity of social scientific methods as employed in all disciplines in the academy, but also the assumptions of disinterest or neutrality associated with Arnoldian analysis of culture. What is consid- ered "the best that has been thought or said in the world" is not an absolute truth, but rather is mobi- lized from particular subject positions toward particular ideological ends. With the partiality of all positions highlighted, "culture" from the view- point of society's "others" could be voiced with increasing fervor.16 By explicitly acknowledging the subjec- tivity of all knowledge-production, these critics question the premise of high culture as universal and timeless and of the supposed neutrality of for- malist methods. By connecting high culture to the larger sense of culture, they reconnect culture to the process of history itself. They critique the notion that culture is somehow above everyday experience and, in particu- lar, above politics and the history of society. Ideological questions, they argue, are not beyond the purview of the category of culture. Quite to the contrary, they are central to it (Dur- ing 1993, pp. 1-2). Rather than trust- ing the benign power of the state to enforce social discipline and dissemi- nate refinement, the new cultural theory tends to be deeply suspicious of such unilateral authority. It instead focuses on the agency that should reside in the populace in a process of democratization. These concepts form the theoretical basis for my dis- cussion of the discourse of historic preservation in this article. Arnoldian-Leavisite Assumptions of Culture and Historic Preservation The Cňticism of Ada Louise Huxtable and the Uncomfortable Coexis- tence of High and Low. Dolores Hayden draws our attention to a good early example of the impact of contem- porary cultural criticism on historic preservation. She discusses an exchange that took place in 1975 between the urban sociologist Herbert Gans and the architectural critic for the New York Times, Ada Louise Huxtable. The debate flared up in the op-ed pages of the New York Times after Gans criticized New York's Landmarks Preservation Com- mission for their continuing bias toward preserving "high" architec- ture at the expense of popular archi- tecture. Hayden summarizes: Gans . . . opened the controversy by attacking [the commission] ... for what he called rewriting New York's architectural history: "Since it tends to designate the stately man- sions of the rich and buildings designed by famous architects, the commission mainly preserves the elite portion of the architectural past. It allows popular architecture to disappear. . . . This landmarks policy distorts the real past, exag- gerates affluence and grandeur, and denigrates the present. . . ." Huxtable . . . defended the commis- sion's record. She warned: "to stig- matize major architectural monu- ments as products of the rich, and attention to them as elitist cultural policy, is a perverse and unservice- able distortion of history. . . . The buildings are a primary and irre- placeable part of civilization. . . . Money frequently made superb examples of art and architecture possible, and there were, fortu- nately, great architects to design and build great buildings." She also argued that in addition to monu- mental buildings she judged as essential to public culture, the . . . Commission had designated twenty-six historic districts includ- ing 11,000 buildings, most of them what she called "vernacular." Gans countered ...[:] "Pri- vate citizens are . . . entitled to save their own past, but when preserva- tion becomes a public act, sup- ported with public funds, it must attend to everyone's past."17 (Hayden 1995, p. 3) That this exchange took place in a newspaper is important. As a mass medium, the newspaper has become one of the central sites in which the contest over culture has taken place. In the newspaper, mass advertisements are found next to reviews of high art and "great" architecture. Reviews of B-movies and sports events compete with sections devoted to "refined liv- ing," which urge readers to seek the higher rather than the lower forms of living. It should not be surprising, then, that a newspaper's architectural critic should become one of the most influential Leavisite advocates for the role of public government in the preservation and dissemination of the best that has been designed and built. Huxtable 's contributions to his- toric preservation are legendary. It is possible that she was the first regular architectural critic for a newspaper in America and in that capacity blazed the trail in making the discourse of architecture and historic preservation accessible to the public.18 In response to the postwar building boom that erupted in Manhattan in the 1950s, which consumed Pennsylvania Station among many other casualties, she became a vigorous crusader for pre- serving "architectural monuments." She explains in work published in 1986, that these monuments were rapidly falling victim to the "winds of profit and power . . . [that produced an] enormous amount of building and [only] occasional architecture." She argues that reforms introducing incentive zoning to New York in 196 1 were turned into a "Frankenstein instrument for creating monsters" because of the "cleverness and cupid- ity of New York's developers and lawyers . . . [who engaged] in a sophisticated corruption and erosion of the planning process" (, Architecture Anyone , pp. xi-xii). John B. Oakes, in a forward to Huxtable 's book Goodbye History , Hello Hamburger, describes her achievements by recalling the "pic- ture" she paints of American laissez faire capitalism: America the beautiful, Let me sing of thee; Burger King and Dairy Queen From sea to shining sea. (Huxtable 1986, Goodbye History , p. 7) Grandison 33</page><page sequence="5">Like Arnold and Leavis before her, Huxtable became an eloquent defender of past forms of refined val- uation against the onslaught of a mass culture that seems to threaten "sweetness and light." As academic and designer, I am inclined to sym- pathize with Huxtable's desire to control rabid "free enterprise," as likely do many of my readers.19 My interrogation of her positions, espe- cially in the light of Gans's critique, is therefore a process of personal reflec- tion, an opportunity for me to grapple with my own conflicting ideological inclinations. We might begin by examining the basis upon which Huxtable char- acterizes Gans's populist assertion as "a perverse and unserviceable distor- tion of history." In support of this point of view, she suggests that the buildings favored for preservation by the commission deserve this status because they are "major architectural monuments" that are an "irreplace- able part of civilization." But what exactly makes "major architectural monuments" an irreplaceable part of civilization? Is the problem that today's technology is insufficient to reproduce them? Are we to believe that while science is able to clone Dolly, it is yet incapable of cloning nineteenth-century building tech- nologies? Or is the issue that no one wishes to invest the funds necessary to replace architectural monuments: in other words, society deems such buildings unworthy of replacement? Maybe the difficulty is that the par- ticular histories and ways of life that major architectural monuments doc- ument cannot be duplicated. Then, would it not be also true to say that all cultural products - "major" and "minor" - are irreplaceable: that Huxtable's Burger Kings and Dairy Queens are someone else's land- marks; the sites of someone else's memories, identity, and history; some-anonymous-other-ones' "Penn- sylvania Station"?20 If we assume, therefore, that all buildings are irre- placeable, then on what grounds can we explain the disparity in the places New York's Landmarks Commission targeted for preservation? We are left only with the circular reasoning that major architectural monuments are historically significant only because they are major monuments of civiliza- tion. A shorthand version of this logic would be the claim that historically significant buildings are historically significant because they are histori- cally significant. Historic preservation has responded to Gans's criticism by attempting to embrace multicultural- ism. In the debate, for example, Huxtable counters Gans by noting that of the 11,000 buildings desig- nated for preservation in twenty-six historic districts, "many" were "ver- nacular." When we look closely at the evidence, however, her claim itself might support Gans's position: while many of the great architectural mon- uments were recognized as histori- cally significant on their own terms - that is, in abstraction of their context of neighboring buildings - all the ver- nacular buildings recognized, it seems, were preserved only as part of an anonymous multitude of buildings in historic districts. Moreover, given that eminent scholars of vernacular architecture such as Amos Rapoport (1969, p. 2) have estimated that ninety-five percent of the built envi- ronment designed by architects and built by engineers is considered "ver- nacular," even allowing for substan- tial error, shouldn't the overwhelming majority of buildings preserved by the Commission be vernacular? It is pos- sible that, on these grounds alone, a reasonable case could be made that the Commission discriminated against vernacular buildings. The distinction made between the "monumental" and the "vernacular" derives from Arnold and Leavis and their convic- tion that a major task of the cultural critic is to police the line between high and low. The distinction betrays a lin- gering allegiance to older assump- tions about culture. These high-cultural assumptions emerge, as well, in Huxtable's use of the terms "major," "great," and "irre- placeable" in describing the architec- tural monuments of New York. Echo- ing Arnold's certainty that what con- stitutes the "best" of culture is knowable as absolute truth, Huxtable develops her argument on behalf of "great architects" and "great build- ings" with the apparent view that her evaluative criteria are self-evident. She assumes a shared belief in the transcendence of particular criteria by which greatness can be judged. In making a claim for the universality and timelessness of high culture - its transcendence - Huxtable in fact takes a position that is highly political and subjective, in spite of its apparent neutrality. What then makes Gans's position so "distorted" and "per- verse," to use Huxtable's words? He appears this way only when we accept the belief that the architectural critic knows and can identify in the built environment the absolute features of "great architectural monuments." 21 We resonate with Huxtable's position because we need to believe that our purposes are not only sepa- rate from but also of a higher order than those of the players in the mar- ketplace. Like Leavisites, we are on the noble side of "art" - like being on the noble side of "mother earth" - in this culture contest between art and unbridled capitalism. Indeed, it is interesting to examine how Huxtable evokes this sensibility in Goodbye His- tory, Hello Hamburger by coupling "his- toric heritage" and environment. She writes about the decades of the 1960s and 1970s when organizations such as the Madison Trust for Historic Pre- servation were formed - in no small part due to her efforts, I might add: During those same decades we were in the midst of the discovery of something called environment; it had always been there. ... It was a time of Earth Days, . . . druidic spring festivals that . . . resulted in changes in perception and attitude toward air, water and land . . . [and] anything that could remotely be called natural. . . . The growing ideal of conser- vation of resources was not unre- lated to the husbanding of the his- toric heritage. At the same time that the preservation movement was gaining strength, the built environment was developing its constituency. . . . The quality of the environment was finally beginning to be seen as a whole thing, inti- mately related to the quality of life. (Huxtable 1986, Goodbye History, p. 9) Underlying the analogy between pre- serving historic heritage and conserv- ing the natural environment lies the politics of making the category of high culture a natural phenomenon. While 34 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="6">"historie heritage" is generally under- stood to be in the realm of culture - the product of humans - and environ- ment in the realm of nature and the product of natural forces (God for some), Huxtable yokes the two together. In so doing, she implies that "historic heritage" is as natural as "environment," that art is as essen- tial and as absolute as air. The claim is so matter-of-fact that one feels obliged to agree with it as if it had always been so. Along these lines of analysis we might also interrogate the title of the book itself and the photograph used to illustrate its cover. The photograph depicts "classical shards" of the demolished Pennsylvania Station before it was carted off to a New Jer- sey dump (Figure 1) (Huxtable 1986b, p. 53). Featured prominently in the photograph is the broken relief in the image of a woman strewn among the rubble like the remains of a real human being after a massacre. The piece of the relief operates to give the impression that the building was once alive and that its demolition is a tragedy of the magnitude of a human holocaust - an act of humans taking life that was given by nature. The "history" to which Huxtable bids farewell is made natural, while the "hamburger" she sardonically wel- comes is left in the realm of human consumption. The arbitrary separa- tion of the two bespeaks a kind of nostalgia and historical amnesia that was present in Arnold's time and in other historical moments, as it surely is in ours. Pennsylvania Station, as any other "architectural monument," represented commercial interests in much the same way as the Madison Square Garden that replaced it, or any McDonalds' headquarters, for that matter. The grandeur of the ter- minal surely did not function merely to uplift or refine weary Pullman travelers, but also to impress them. In its excesses of space and decora- tion, the terminal embodied and made a spectacle of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company's power and wealth - wealth that was amassed in the wake of one of the greatest acts of unbridled commercial real-estate speculation in the history of the world. To cover this reality, literally, Figure L Rubble from the demolished Pennsylvania Station before it was carted off to the Meadowlands landfill in New Jersey. The photograph was used for the cover of Huxtable's Goodbye History, Hello Hamburger. Photograph by Edward Hausner. Reprinted with the per- mission of the New York Times Pictures Department. with the anthropomorphic image of "classical shards" is to revise history. In celebrating New York's Pennsylva- nia Station as a pure artistic form embodying a great era in social and architectural history, we forget its impure human origins. The railroad magnates were not only the most rabid real-estate speculators of their time, they were also the primary tar- get of the Huxtables of their time. The reformers of the Progressive Era Grandison 35</page><page sequence="7">who were attempting to break up the railroad monopolies so despised the magnates that they dubbed them "robber barons." These men were the Hamburger Kings of the turn of the century. Thorstein Veblen, one such reformer, actually created a new soci- ological term to describe the robber barons' greed, exorbitant display of consumption in building mansions, and disregard for the land and public resources: "conspicuous consump- tion.'^ Huxtable's rebuttal of Gans provides a good example of the opera- tion of formalism in the field of his- toric preservation, which arbitrarily insists on the superiority of the forms of high culture. Architectural forms, like those of literature, music, and visual art, were defined by an enlight- ened Europe after it emerged from the "Dark Ages." Canonized over the centuries, they continue to provide, the eternal and universal yardstick by which the significance of all other "forms" in the built environment might be measured. Like snowfalls from the sky, the rules and principles exemplified by these canonical forms have come to be accepted as perfectly natural. Treated as architectural and landscape architectural first-truths, like the canonical texts of the Bible, they cannot and need not be explained in cultural-historical terms. The major architectural monuments to which Huxtable refers, then, like the text of the book of Genesis, stand eternally as the model by which the significance of forms of the built envi- ronment might be determined. How- ever, the moment we begin to exam- ine the cultural history of these high forms from below, as we did briefly in our discussion of the robber barons who built Penn Station, we see that all forms are embedded in a system that is always political, never neutral. While critics like Huxtable have played an important role in calling attention to some negative conse- quences of the profit motive, their adherence to formalist conventions has hindered their ability to develop a politicized critique of forms; ironi- cally, by insisting that their taste is universal and transcendent, these same critics cover up the profit motive operating in the erection of the monuments that they continue to canonize. Objects and Canonical Lineage. Implicit in the alleged transcen- dence of the canon of great architec- tural monuments, therefore, is the separation of the products of cul- ture - in this case architecture - from society, as Raymond Williams argued in the postwar period. This separa- tion has two somewhat paradoxical but logical consequences for an Arnoldian-Leavisite approach to architectural criticism. First, we gen- erally assume that architecture can be understood in isolation from its context, a belief that rests on the idea that architectural objects possess meaning in and of themselves. Con- text, according to this formalist understanding, is irrelevant or at least peripheral to an appreciation of the essential, intrinsic meaning that resides within the architectural form. According to this view, the signifi- cance of an architectural object can be determined by the degree to which it displays such permanent principles as the Vitruvian trilogy - commoditas, firmitas, venustas. Hence, the inter- preters of architecture need only devote themselves to the project of identifying these qualities in objects under investigation. The second idea arising from this separation of an ostensibly transcendent art from soci- ety is that architectural objects are imbued with significance only in rela- tion to each other. The hierarchy of works that creates an art-historical lineage determines the meaning and value of any individual object. We, therefore, face the paradox that while we claim the autonomy of architec- tural monuments, we must also con- struct their significance on the basis of comparisons with other artifacts. Simultaneously, we wish to claim that architecture is significant in and of itself and to mediate this significance in relation to a chronology of canon- ized styles and types. Because of the value placed on the canon and on art-historical lin- eage, such critics of the built environ- ment as the architect Thomas Gaines have attempted to understand "what ... it takes for a college ground to be a work of art" (Gaines 1991, p. 1). With the backing of architectural truths, Gaines can comfortably con- clude that "a good campus consists of a group of harmonious buildings related by various means (such as arches and landscaping)23 that create well proportioned . . . spaces." So cer- tain is he of the universality of these ideals of "harmony" and "proportion" that he is able to launch his objective assessment of the American college campus with no further clarification. In his book Gaines writes about these campuses as though their formal fea- tures sprout full blown from their art- historical precedents. Using the lan- guage of Genesis he writes: In the beginning, there was Geor- gian, . . . characterized by axiality, symmetry, low-hipped roofs, [etc.], . . . giving human scale to Prince- ton's Nassau Hall. . . . [Georgian led to] Federal and Greek Revival, . . . throwbacks to the classical, [when] architects engaged in an orgy of rediscovery. . . . Federal showed attenuated columns, blind arches, [etc.], . . .[while] Greek Revival . . . [showed] butted siding, sidelights, and low-pitched pedi- ments . . . elements . . . [that] touched our collective conscious- ness. . . . Then the artistic sands shifted ... in a chaotic reaction to discipline - a bacchanalian fancy dress ball in Gothic Revival, Ital- ianate, Second Empire French, and Queen Anne attire [ensued] ... on land-grant colleges in the Midwest. Subsequently, ivy was planted everywhere to dampen the explo- sive diversity of styles. . . . Formal- ism [was] called forth by the muses to tame the wild Victorians, [as] the city beautiful movement returned us to dignity and discipline, follow- ing as it did the axial planning of the French Ecole des Beaux Arts [exemplified] by William Welles Bosworth's plan for MIT. . . . Mod- ern campuses extracted what they wanted from each of these stylistic periods. . . . [and] finally, in the 1970s, retro-postmodernism reared its trendy head, . . . [displaying] a series of historical one-liners and recycled images. (Gaines 1991, pp. 6-11) Gaines's comment becomes a series of styles, one begetting the next, a "his- tory" in a vacuum. A critic who viewed architecture in relation to cultural history might have been interested, for instance, in why the land-grant 36 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="8">concept becomes connected in the Midwest with the "bacchanalian fancy dress ball." Could it be that Gothic Revival, "chaotic" though it may be, conveyed instant authority to these new campuses for the masses? This "chaos," after all, because of its association with such institutions as Oxbridge, also serves as the architec- tural signifier of longevity and high cultural standing. Beyond his separating of archi- tecture from society, we may also examine Gaines's belief that he could conduct a disinterested analysis, a notion implied by the authority with which he states his mission to inform us about "what ... it takes for a col- lege ground to be a work of art." He becomes an Arnoldian-style culture priest, who, armed with the transcen- dent principles and rules that define the best architectural thought in the world, is sure that he can rationally accomplish this goal. But his lan- guage betrays his biases, which con- tradict his intended objectivity or even historical and political neutral- ity. It is clear, for instance, that he views postmodernism in architecture with some disapproval, for he affixes to his comments on this style such adjectives as "retro," "trendy," and "recycled." In contrast, he values the "scale giving" devices of Georgian and those of Federal and Greek Revival, which he tells us "touched our collective consciousness." It is not clear why Federal and Greek Revival are any less "retro," "trendy," or "recycled" than postmodern, given that these styles are also hodgepodge copies of a distant idealized architec- tural root. The shapes, textures, col- ors, and other objective qualities embodied by these styles mysteriously moved the consciousness of a people. Postmodernism, on the other hand, merely followed the trends of its time and recycled from the past, its bor- rowing for some reason a more seri- ous offense than that enacted by Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival. Gaines, as do so many other architectural critics, demonstrates the limitations of formalism as it operates in the discourses of the built environment. He believes he can investigate with objectivity the histor- ical significance of college campuses. But this objectivity is shaped by a "history" fixed by "architecture" - understood as the forms of buildings. Therefore, his analysis focuses on the architectural objects collected on campuses, understanding them in the absence of all context but their canonical lineage. With the "great- ness" of these objects established, we can now celebrate the enigmatic cre- ative impulse that led to them. Genius and Patronage. It is said that the opera soprano Lotte Lehman once asked of another, Geraldine Ferrar, "How does one get a voice such as Ponselle's?" To this question Ferrar replied, "There is only one way, by special arrangement with God!" Farrar implies that Ponselle's voice really cannot be understood in human terms. In one phrase she sweeps away any cultural context for Ponselle's celebrity. Ponselle's musi- cian parents, her experience in vaudeville, her family's ability to sup- port her voice training and its access to the institutions that facilitated her discovery by the most famous tenor of her time, Enrico Caruso - all this is replaced by the mystery of heavenly intercession. This mystification exem- plifies the operation of the concept of genius in our culture, a concept that is as central as that of the object in understanding the operation of for- malist assumptions of the discourse of architecture, landscape architec- ture, and historic preservation. As Ponselle, Price, and Pavarotti are to opera, or Shakespeare, Austen, and Hardy to Leavisim, so are the fol- lowing men to campus design accord- ing to Gaines: "Benjamin Latrobe; Robert Mills; James Renwick; A.J. Davis; Walter Cope; Charles Coolidge; Ralph Adams Cram; Charles Klauder; Cass Gilbert; the Olmsteds; Stanford White; William Pereira; John Carl Warnecke; Thomas Church; Walter Netsch; Hugh Stubbins; Harry Weese; the firm Caudill Rowlett Scott; Edward Larrabee Barnes; and I. M. Pei" (Gaines 1991, p. 3). Gaines, secure in his knowledge of the ideals of har- mony and proportion, can proceed to pay homage to a patrilineal canon of designers who apparently share these ideals. These designers are deified for how they manipulated original princi- ples in one way or another to invent the styles and types that advanced the history of design. In contrast to the conventional historical approach that Gaines's list represents, new social history argues that "individual ťgreat men' and events [can] no longer orga- nize the past. . . . [Instead,] the writ- ing of seminal books or the formula- tion of new laws . . . are usually fitted in to a framework created by larger forces such as economic trends, new technologies, or new patterns of belief. . . . The . . . focus . . . has become processes, not events or indi- viduals" (Stearns 1993, p. 41-42). But in historic preservation, as is still often the case in the disciplines of architec- ture and landscape architecture, the focus remains on individuals as iso- lated creative impulses. Thus, the legacy of Frederick Law Olmsted becomes the stimulus for the National Association for Olmsted Parks (NAOP), the organization which perhaps most symbolizes the rise of cultural land- scape preservation in America. Few preservationists who accept the tenets of social history go so far as to ques- tion the concept of the National Park Service's Olmsted Archives, a reposi- tory of plans and other drawings, pho- tographs, planting lists, lithographs, letters, financial records and reports for "Olmsted-designed" landscapes. These documents celebrate the pro- duction of the Olmsted firm as a cul- tural form that is important in and of itself. The stated justification for the archive is to advance a greater under- standing of Olmstedian work as art- historical entities and provide a clear direction for recapturing the historic designs across America. We don't question this celebration of Olmsted or the attempt to recreate his works as art-historical ends because we assume Olmsted to be the foremost parkmaker in the nation and the founder of landscape architecture. Raymond Williams describes this idealizing attachment as roman- tic formalism, which insists on "the active making of forms." In contrast, the more static formalism associated with neoclassical and academic theo- ries of culture constructs the histori- cal significance of contemporary forms according to the accuracy with which they mimic standards set by classical forms. Thus, romantic for- malism assumes new forms to be the Grandison 37</page><page sequence="9">unique "achievement of a particular vital impulse," like that of Olmsted's. In romantic formalism the canon develops into a list of names that apparently give agency and individu- ality to mute forms. In another dis- play of the separation of culture and society, new forms are billed as emerging from the minds of geniuses, special individuals who, in isolation from context, punctuate the history of design with their unique creative output (Williams 1970, pp. 186-191). This genius usually embodies an extraordinary individuality: one that is above or outside the culture he or she inhabits; "a person endowed with transcendent mental superiority, inventiveness, and ability."24 Geniuses always remain enigmatic: mortals cannot quite comprehend their cre- ativity because this creativity cannot be explained in human terms. At least, so we must construct genius if we are to preserve the mystery of the great monuments upon which all "civ- ilization" rests. We cannot afford to consider them as mere vehicles of cul- tural history. For instance, we would object to the suggestion that "Falling- water" would have been built even if Wright had not lived, and prefer instead to think of it as a unique expression of Frank Lloyd Wright's mind (adapted from Eagleton, p. 3). Romantic formalism, however, does contradict itself in the occa- sional acknowledgment that even "geniuses" need resources to live and produce. As Huxtable points out, "Money frequently made superb examples of art and architecture pos- sible." Thus, the concept of genius is impossible without the cultural prac- tice of patronage in one form or another. From Bramante and Pope Julius II to Olmsted and the Vander- bilts, our culture couples geniuses and patrons while at the same time persisting in the creed that genius happens in isolation. Hiding this conundrum becomes possible by iso- lating patrons, like geniuses, from the context of society: the universality and timelessness of the creative out- put of the genius justify the wealth and power that make it possible. This wealth and power need not be exam- ined or explained. Bramante's eternal Greek cross plan for St. Peter's Basil- ica - lovingly restored by Michelan- gelo - as a treasure of civilization jus- tifies the fact that the Basilica along with the Vatican required, according to David Jacobs, "the most lavish expenditure of time . . . [and] money" in Rome during the Renaissance (Jacobs 1974, p. 121). In other words, since the Basilica belongs to all peo- ple for all time, it would be sacrile- gious to wonder how the various Popes amassed the astounding wealth required to finance its construction. It would be even worse to wonder about their political purposes for underwriting so expensive a project. Alas, such considerations do not mat- ter given the greatness of the monu- ment that this patronage made possi- ble. In this way, therefore, geniuses not only acquire cultural immunity for themselves, but they also confer this attribute on their patrons. It turns out that, as this aspect of formalism is borne out in historic preservation, it is often the patron who is remembered and not the genius. The architects and master gardeners of Southern antebellum plantations, for instance, are hardly ever remembered unless they happen to have financed their own ambitions, as did Thomas Jefferson. In an appar- ent corruption of the romantic for- malist system, we end up celebrating not so much the work of art itself but the wealth that led to it - a corrup- tion that actually constitutes the rela- tion between patron and genius. Thus, when I visit these plantations, I am usually so awed by the resources invested in the great monuments therein that, even as a designer myself, I forget all about architecture and its eternal principles. Instead, I think about the opportunities that a free society offers and about possi- bilities for myself. I become lost in dreams that figure me as patron, sip- ping tea on my terrace, surveying my gardens and my shady pecan groves, and presiding over my beautiful fam- ily and my contented workers whom I imagine delight in serving at my beck and call. The larger and more lavish the big house and the more extensive the grounds, the more historically sig- nificant the plantation seems to me. In the end, I am somewhat embar- rassed to confess, it is usually a con- flation of the lifestyle the plantations represent and my own aspirations that constitutes my most compelling memories of such sites. Possibly, this kind of fantasy underlies the canonization of many monuments. With admiration for the wealth that enabled such cultural production, as well as the professions that celebrate those productions, we confer inherent beauty and signifi- cance on culturally-specific forms. Helped by patrons, geniuses realize manifestations of architectural and landscape architectural ideals that are worthy of canonization and thereby serve as perpetual models for all design. The built environment might now be understood relative to the history of these exemplary works, its forms infinitely classified accord- ing to styles, types, and periods so that cultural-historical context becomes nonessential to the meaning supposedly embodied in objects. Conclusion The cultural critic John Storey writes about the persistence of Arnoldian-Leavisite assumptions of culture - which he calls the "culture and civilization tradition" - even today: Given recent developments in the field of cultural theory, it is almost enough to present a narrative of its approach to condemn it to "pop- ulist" disapproval. . . . [However,] for almost a hundred years it was undoubtedly the dominant para- digm in cultural analysis. Indeed it could be argued that it still forms a kind of repressed "common sense" in certain areas of British and American academic and non- academic life. (Storey 1994, p. 5) The foregoing discussion suggests that Storey's assertion is also the case in the discourse of historic preservation as well as in the associated discourses of the built environment. Despite our efforts to engage contemporary cul- tural criticism, the authority of the canon of "great architectural monu- ments" and the geniuses and patrons who facilitated them, remains perva- sive. Our continuing assumptions of formalism not only cause uncomfort- able contradictions and leaps of logic, but also prevent us from realizing the full implications of contemporary cul- 38 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="10">turai theory in historic preservation. In a later essay, I will explore how this continuing formalism hinders the degree to which we can embrace more critically both "culture" and "landscape" in cultural-landscape preservation. Can we successfully engage multiculturalism, for instance, and still preserve intact the concept of the canon? Can we make gestures to the "low" without interrogating the validity of the "high"? Similarly, cultural landscape preservation has moved toward a "holistic" approach to preserving and interpreting his- toric properties. It has drawn atten- tion to the importance of "landscape" as opposed to just buildings which, heretofore, were the primary targets of preservation efforts. But have we really succeeded in achieving this "holistic" embrace of the built envi- ronment as we have supposed? Can we fully exploit the notion of a holis- tic landscape without interrogating the formalist tendency to focus on artifacts as the significant units of historical meaning? As we move toward addressing these concerns, so too must we nudge the discourse of historic preservation forward to real- ize more fully the democratic ideals toward which it strives. The purpose of this essay has been to raise theoret- ical questions concerning the uses of culture in the discourses of the built environment. Now that we have begun to clear the ground, we can take the next step. In my next essay, I will examine current methods and prac- tices being used to integrate multi- culturalism and other ideas from con- temporary cultural theory into the disciplines of architecture, landscape architecture and historic preservation. Notes 1 . The Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines formalism as, "the emphatic or predom- inant attention to arrangement, style, or artis- tic means of such cultural products as graphic art, literature, or music, often involving strict adherence to traditional or prescribed rules and methods usually with corresponding de- emphasis of content" (1986, p. 893). The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language , Third Edition defines it as "rigorous or excessive adherence to recognized forms, as in religion" (1992, p. 714). I use dictionary definitions to pinpoint the dominant cultural usage of this and a few other important terms used in this essay. 2. 1 say "attempting" because it is difficult - possibly impossible - to really trace, far less to outline, the development of an intellectual tra- dition that is as complex in its sources and pro- gression as contemporary cultural studies. As the cultural critic Stuart Hall (1980, p. 16) points out, "the search for origins is tempting but illusory. In intellectual matters absolute beginnings are exceedingly rare. We find instead continuities and breaks." While this outline cannot do justice to the complex his- tory and concepts of the field, it is important to provide context and to mâp the important terms and approaches used in later discussion. 3. Much of the discussion under this heading is drawn from Hall (1980), During, ed. (1993), and Storey (1994); Other references consulted more generally include Davies (1993), hooks (1990), and Turner (1992). Dutton and Hurst Mann, eds. (1996) was a helpful reference from the discipline of architecture. 4. See, for instance, Hall (1980, p. 16). 5. Additional references consulted for this sub- section include Culler, ed. (1961), Bell (1988), and Samson (1992). 6. In addition to the ascent of the working- classes into formal politics in Victorian Eng- land and the general rise of urban industrial and working-class consciousness, some other contemporary events would have contributed to Arnold's sense of a shift in the established social order. Perhaps most important, Charles Darwin published his book On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection in 1859 (Darwin 1859) based on his scientific research of plant and animal species on the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The work, by questioning the creation story, threatened the moral authority of the Bible, contributing to the anarchy Arnold perceived. 7. For more on this reading of Arnold, see Culler (1961) and Storey (1994). 8. 1 use quotation marks here because "art" and "classical music" in this context are popu- larly assumed to refer to "Western" forms. 9. One of the most influential changes in the mode of production was brought about by Henry Ford when he initiated the mass produc- tion of automobiles with the Model T. Fordism, as it was called, became a symbol of the late modern shift in the established social order, a shift precipitated by the continuing expansion of industrial capitalism and further decline in agrarian capitalism. The symptoms of the ensuing "crisis" included the almost complete disappearance of skilled labor in favor of fac- tory labor, the increasing affluence and urban- ism of the working-class, and the correspond- ing expansion of consumption by this class. Fordism was the symbol of mass culture from beyond as a burgeoning America gained more and more cultural authority across the globe, thus threatening Britain's claim to global ascendancy. For more discussion on this see Smith (1993). 10. The organic society to which Leavisites referred was that of England before the Indus- trial Revolution. Idealizing this moment, these critics argued that people then had a healthy way of life that was tied to the land and to com- munity. People supposedly shared a belief in such traditional values as family, hard work, and civic pride. Most important, they saw it as a time when the lower ranks of society accepted without question the legitimate authority of the higher-cultured minority. 11. The history that is presented is focused on the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, which has been tremendously influential in shaping contemporary cultural theory. At this center, early criticism interro- gated Arnoldian thought (via Leavisism). Strictly speaking, however, contemporary cul- tural criticism developed over a period of more than thirty years with successive traditions cri- tiquing and elaborating earlier ones. Moreover, the history is not linear but occurred in several disciplines and regions of the world and along a number of different lines of thought, as diverse as history and linguistics. 12. Hoggart eventually founded the Birming- ham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Stud- ies. 13. This critique, which he introduced in Cul- ture and Society , (Williams 1958) was elaborated in Marxism and Literature (Williams 1977). 14. Raymond Williams's writings are probably the most frequently cited of the foundational works that shape contemporary cultural stud- ies. A Marxist critic, his notion of recoupling "culture" and "society" captures the essential political aspect of the movement. His works, therefore, are cited throughout this article to provide theoretical context. 15. The concept was advanced earlier by the work of the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci in the 1930s. Refer to Hoare and Smith (1971) for a collection of influential selections from this body of work. 16. In this sense Foucault's work paves the way for constructing culture not only as an instru- ment of the state's power - hegemony - but also as an instrument of resistance by the masses - counter-hegemony. 17. Sòme may view as unsuitable my decision to use a newspaper exchange in a scholarly essay. It is important to note, however, that Huxtable's eminence is largely based on her work for the New York Times. Her early views, to the degree that they can be discerned, are recorded in this medium. Finally, her later books rely heavily on her newspaper articles. 18. For her contributions she received many distinguished awards. These include not only the first Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Criti- cism, but also an award from the McArthur Foundation. 19. It is interesting, for instance, that all of the peer reviewers of an earlier draft of this article were troubled by my critique of Huxtable. While I have taken very seriously the impor- tant comments that were made and have responded to them, I could not help but wonder whether one of the reasons underlying the reviews was our continuing Arnoldian assump- tions about the role of the cultural critic as guardian of (high) culture and as arbiter of con- temporary cultural contests between "minority culture" and "mass civilization." 20. The demolition of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, New York City, became the symbol mobilizing Huxtable's mission on behalf of "great architectural monuments." The build- Grandison 39</page><page sequence="11">ing was taken down in order to make way for Madison Square Garden, a major venue for mass cultural events like sports and rock con- certs. Following the dispute that ensued from the demolition, the New York's Landmarks Preservation Commission was formed. 21. 1 use quotation marks to distinguish archi- tecture from building, recalling Huxtable's own use of the two terms. 22. See Chapter IV of Vehlen (1979). 23. Notice here that Gaines uses "landscape" in its narrow sense as "the gardens." Like the building, landscape becomes an another arti- fact of the historic site. As an alternative, land- scape could be understood as the whole built environment. I will discuss this issue in a future paper. 24. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1986, p. 946). The American Heritage Dictionary, Third Edition (1992, p. 757) defines genius as "extraordinary intellectual and creative power." Again, I use the dictionary definitions to pinpoint the culturally dominant usage of this term. References The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language , Third Edition. 1992.
