<plain_text><page sequence="1">ONTOLOGICAL VERTIGO Peter Preuss University of Lethbridge The Ontological Argument continues to fascinate despite almost universal agreement that it is fallacious. One reason for this is surely its fecundity. Anselm's conception of a being of the understanding, for example, has made its contribution to inquiry into fictional objects, intentional objects and the like; discussion of the issue whether existence is a predicate has contributed to inquiry into predication; and inquiry into the nature of necessity also owes a debt to the On- tological Argument. More could be said, but I don't think that the argument's fecundity is the chief reason for its continuing fascination. Rather, I think, it is an uneasy feeling that the standard objections to it and their various ingenious refinements fail quite to do it justice. It is an uneasy feeling that unless one, as it were, bends over back- ward a bit the objections don't really defeat the argument. But one is willing to bend over backward a bit because there is also an uneasy feeling that one's real reservations about the argument are not fully captured by the objections. Perhaps this is why new refinements on the objections are always welcome. The battle against the Ontological Argument is a bit like the fight against cancer. We know it can be beaten. If one considers the argument and the objections to it seriously and without any partisan spirit or psychological set, and sustains this con- sideration for any length of time, a peculiar phenomenon may occur, a phenomenon akin to looking at a Necker cube or that picture we've all seen in psychology textbooks in which we see two faces looking at each other at one moment and the next moment we see a goblet. So with the Ontological Argument. At one moment we see the force of the argument and the objections pale. At such moments one is in- clined to throw one's tobacco tin in the air and shout "Great Scott, Int 1 Phil Rel 11: 93-110 (1980) 0020-7047/80/0112-0093 $2.70.

But at the next moment reservations flood in, quicken the objections and pale the force of the argument. At such times one may become intellectually dizzy, become affected with what I wish to call ontological vertigo.2 But this is not a simple oscillation which might simply indicate intel- lectual vacillation and inability to make up one's mind. That would probably be uninteresting and not worth writing about. Rather, what I propose to give an account of involves transformations in both the argument and the objections to it which are, I believe, most instruc- tive to anyone interested in the Ontological Argument, even if they end in a vertiginous position. A good way of beginning this enterprise is by showing how the On- tological Argument survives the objection which in the minds of most philosophers is the fatal one. The objection I have in mind is this: if the Ontological Argument can prove the existence of God it can also prove the existence of almost anything you please, but it does not prove God's existence because 'existence' is not a predicate and, there- fore, not a perfection. This objection is a complex of those credited to Gaunilo and to Kant.3 An acceptable formulation of the first premise of the Ontological Argument is as follows: 'God is the most perfect conceivable being'. The use of the word 'being' in this premise is not to indicate that we are discussing something which exists, but rather that we are discus- sing something concerning which it makes sense to ask whether it exists or not. Gaunilo's objection is that we can construct an argument just like the Ontological Argument except that its first premise reads: 'Lost Island is the most perfect conceivable island' (with appropriate changes in the rest of the argument to accomodate the change in topic) . We may treat 'God' and 'Lost Island' as proper names. The significant change, therefore, is the change from 'being' to 'island'. This change seems innocent enough, especially to philosophers who know that arguments are valid in virtue of their form and who are, therefore, quite happy to symbolize an argument when the issue is whether or not it is valid. That Gaunilo chose 'island' as the word to replace 'being' is quite accidental, it could have been 'frog' or 'cloud' or whatever. So it seems that Gaunilo's point is not one about special effects achievable with islands, but one about the form of the argu- ment. But the change is not as innocent as all this. What is Gaunilo asking?</page><page sequence="3">Ontological Vertigo 95 Is he asking that the word 'island' be substituted for the word 'being' or is he asking that the notion of a being be qualified in such a way that it also answer to the description of an island? Let us sup- pose he is asking for a substitution. He is asking that the word 'being' be discarded and the word 'island' substituted in its place. This is a full blooded substitution. We are now talking about an island and not about a being, that is, we are no longer talking about something concerning which it makes sense to ask whether it exists or not. But it is nonsense to attempt to prove the existence of such a thing. If this is what Gaunilo had in mind then his objection is absurd and need not be taken seriously. But probably Gaunilo had qualification in mind. Surely he would not want to deny that an island is a being, that there may or may not be islands and that it makes sense to ask whether there are or not. He is asking that rather than try to prove the existence of the most perfect conceivable being without restriction or qualification we re- construct the argument to prove the existence of the most perfect con- ceivable being with the qualification that it also answer to the descrip- tion of an island. Now, the qualification of its answering to the des- cription of an island is arbitrary. Gaunilo's point is that if one can prove the existence of the most perfect conceivable being with the Ontological Argument, then that argument can also be used to prove the existence of the very same being subject to any change or qualifica- tion that he or anyone else cares to impose. Gaunilo's demand, under- stood in this way, seems almost as absurd as our earlier way of under- standing it. Or, at best, it is not at all obvious that it is a legitimate demand. The force of Gaunilo's objection largely depends on the reasonableness of his request to make an apparently legitimate change in the argument, apparently legitimate because it involves no change in the form of the argument, and on the circumstance that this change has absurd consequences. That his request is not so reasonable as it appears to be on the face of it seems clear. But it can also be shown to be an illegitimate request, I think. I'll try to show that now. One might object to the Ontological Argument on the grounds that it is an ill-conceived enterprise from the start, that the attempt to spin the existence of something merely out of its concept is a hopeless attempt because no concept gives us any information about its instan- tiations. We could even define something as existing, even as neces- sarily existing, and it would still be legitimate to ask whether it exists</page><page sequence="4">96 Peter Preuss or whether the concept is instantiated. Concepts, one might object, just do not imply anything about what there is, concepts do not imply existence. But this view is mistaken. All concepts of beings have ontological implications ('being' taken in the non-question-begging sense specified above) . The concept of a house is the concept of a being. Whether or not a house, or a certain house, exists is a matter of empirical inquiry. We know it could exist but we do not know from the mere concept whether it does or not. The concept of a house is not unusual in this. It is a member of a very large class of concepts which imply possible existence. They are concepts of things which may or may not exist, things the existence of which is possible. This is an ontological im- plication which we can accept quite readily, an implication tacitly assumed in all design of things which will later be built. The assump- tion is that the thing can be built, can exist, that its existence is pos- sible. And we can know this by a mere scrutiny of the concept. Some- times we are not sure. Could Frank Lloyd Wright's "Mile High" be built if the design called for balsa wood as the building material? And sometimes we are sure that the thing cannot be built, not because of anticipated engineering problems, but because the concept is of a different class. Had the house been taken from the graphic work of M. C. Escher,4 where we find two dimensional representations of buildings impos- sible in three dimensions, we could say without hesitation that the thing cannot be built. We know this not because we are competent architects but because we understand the concept to belong to the class which implies impossible existence (or necessary non-existence) . A builder given the plans for an Escher building would take one look at the presentation drawings and refuse to begin construction. He knows it cannot be done. If one suggested to him that all he had was a concept and that concepts do not have ontological implications he would reply with a well deserved blank stare, or worse. He knows that he cannot build this design and he knows that no house ans- wering this description is to be found anywhere in town (or out of it) . He knows all this because concepts do have ontological implications and he has a sufficient grasp of the proposed one to infer its necessary non-existence. The same considerations apply to anyone asked to check his attic for a misplaced square circle (a squound) . He would refuse to go up and look not because he will not believe that people</page><page sequence="5">Ontological Vertigo 97 misplace such things, but because he knows that there are no such things to be misplaced. We can talk about squounds, inquire into some of their strange geometrical properties, but we cannot misplace them because we cannot have one to misplace. Squounds do not exist, and we know that as a result of a mere scrutiny of the concept. There are then at least two classes of concepts distinguished accor- ding to their ontological implications: those that imply possible exis- tence and those that imply necessary non-existence. The Ontological Argument is an argument to the effect that there is a class of concepts which imply necessary existence, and that this class has at least one member. Again, if there is such a concept, a mere scrutiny of that con- cept will show it, although an empirical encounter with the instantia- tion of that concept would provide further confirmation just as the failure to find an Escher building would provide such confirmation of the conceptual implication. Now we can see the nature of Gaunilo's objection in a new light. Anselm claims to have discovered that there is a concept of the third class, a concept that implies necessary existence. Gaunilo asks to make any change he pleases to this concept, in particular one which turns it into a concept of the first class (an island), a concept which im- plies possible existence. Then he points out that the new concept does not imply necessary existence. The implicit argument is that since some concepts imply possible existence, no concept implies necessary exis- tence. Understood in this way we are less than impressed with Gaunilo's objection. One might of course contemplate some changes to Anselm's concept of God such that it became a concept of the second class, the class that implies necessary non-existence, but that sort of tampering is surely as illegitimate as Gaunilo's. We can lay to rest, I think, the part of the apparently fatal objec- tion to the Ontological Argument which is credited to Gaunilo. It is anyway the softer part. Most philosophers who today reject the argu- ment do so because of the part of the objection credited to Kant: the argument requires that 'existence' be a predicate and a perfection, but it is not a predicate and therefore not a perfection. I will now try to lay that part of the objection to rest as well by showing that, in the required sense, 'existence' is a predicate and a perfection. There is no question that 'exisence' or one of its forms can be a grammatical predicate, for surely it can. 'Fishes swim', 'John runs' and 'God exists' are paradigmatic subject-predicate propositions in the</page><page sequence="6">98 Peter Preuss grammatical sense. The issue is rather whether 'existence' and its grammatical variations can be epistemological predicates. Every indicative proposition may be said to have a topic-comment structure. In every such proposition there is a word or a phrase which indicates the topic the proposition is about. This is the epistemologi- cal subject. And every such proposition also makes a comment, it af- firms or denies something concerning that topic or says something about that topic. The word or phrase which does that is the episte- mological predicate. How could a grammatical predicate fail to be- come an epistemological predicate? It is hard to say, certainly Kant is less than helpful here, but perhaps the following account will be acceptable. Sometimes in indicating the topic of the proposition a certain amount of information about that topic is also already given. If now the grammatical predicate merely states what is already given in in- dicating the topic, then it does not succeed in giving any more infor- mation or making a comment that has not already been made and, so, fails to become an epistemological predicate. If you say, for example, 'This coloured thing is coloured' you have a grammatical predicate which fails to become an epistemological predicate. Or take for another example 'This being exists'. Anselm has been accused of beg- ging the question by defining God as a being and then simply con- cluding that this being exists. But that won't do. If one construes 'being' as we have done above, as something concerning which it makes sense to ask whether it exists, then 'This being does not exist' make as much sense as "This being exists' but they convey different information. In either case 'exists' succeeds in becoming an episte- mological predicate. But if one construes 'being' in another way, as something which exists, then it is worth pointing out that the con- clusion of the Ontological Argument is not 'God exists' but 'God does not exist only in the understanding but in reality as well'. How we continue our discussion now depends on how we construe the second premise of the Ontological Argument which may be for- mulated: 'God is at least a being of the understanding'. There are two ways of construing this notion of a being of the understanding and the argument is immune to the Kantian objection either way. Let me first construe it in the way that it seems Anselm meant it to be construed. A being of the understanding has some ontological status less than real beings but greater than beings which simply do not</page><page sequence="7">Ontological Vertigo 99 exist. Fictional characters like Hamlet or Sherlock Holmes are beings of the understanding. They exist in fiction, not in reality. To the extent that any being (in our soft sense) becomes a topic of myth, folklore, fiction, conversation or debate, it acquires the ontological status of a being of the understanding.5 Let us call such beings infra- real beings. There is no doubt that God has at least the ontological status of an infra-real being. Anyone who has some understanding of the first premise must agree to that, even the anonymous atheist who is An- selm's foil. The disputed point then is not whether God exists at all, but whether God is only an infra-real being and no more, or whether he is a real being. We could conceive a similar sort of dispute about Sherlock Holmes. Both parties to the dispute agree that Holmes is at least an infra-real being and both know enough about Holmes to agree that they are both talking about the same person. But one party to the dispute insists that Holmes is only a fictional character, while the other insists that he is a real detective. There is substantial disa- greement. Just so Anselm's atheist will grant God the same ontological status as Sherlock Holmes but no more, while Anselm insists there is more. If we accept that any being we can talk about exists, if only be- cause we talk about it, then of course 'existence' will fail to become an epistemological predicate. 'Such and such a being exists' would be as informitave as 'such and such a coloured thing is coloured'. But the specification of the kind of existence the thing has is informative, as informative as specifying the kind of colour this coloured thing has. Anselm and his atheist are not arguing about existence but about a specific kind of existence. Thus I might in many respects agree with a certain treasure hunter about the squound which has become the object of local legend. I would, for example, agree about many of its geometrical properties. But I would insist that it would be pointless to search my attic because the squound was necessarily confined to in- fra-reality. Just so Anselm argues with the atheist that God is neces- sarily not confined to infra-reality, that he is necessarily real. And in both cases a scrutiny of the concept is the crucial evidence. If one can accept that the specification of existence is a predicate in the required sense, given our present construal of 'being of the understanding', then an argument can be given to show why it is also a perfection. Anselm accepts this intuitively and perhaps there</page><page sequence="8">100 Peter Preuss is some small merit in briefly rehearsing what might have been An- selm's intuition. If Anselm's painter came to me offering a certain painting for sale, a painting which he described to me in such detail that I could see it in my mind's eye, I would feel cheated if after I had paid for the painting he claimed that I had already received it. I may, as it were, have received the infra-real painting, but I want the real one. To receive a vivid description of a painting may even be a satis- fying aesthetic experience, but it is not what art lovers pay for. The real painting is valued, not because the greens are greener or the lines more graceful or any such thing, but because it is the real painting. In paintings, it seems, real existence is a much-valued perfec- tion. We need not stay with intuitions however. Infra-real beings share this common feature: they pass out of existence when they pass out of mind. Like dream images they cease to be as soon as we cease men- tally to entertain them somehow. To be sure, there are certain aids to memory and communication like books or films to which certain infra-real beings may owe their resurrection, as it were, even after they have passed out of mind, but such aids must address themselves to minds to effect this resurrection. The point is that infra-real beings depend for their existence upon real conscious beings. Infra-reality stands in a relation of ontological dependency to reality. I think we can accept as a principle that, of any two beings, if one is dependent upon the other in a certain respect, then in that respect the dependent one is the less perfect and the supporting one the more perfect. For example, if two students cheat during an examination by one giving the other the answers to a question, then in respect of that particular knowledge the giver is more perfect than the receiver. But in the case of the Ontological Argument the dependency is an ontological one. Infra-real beings, no matter in what other respects they may excel real beings, depend upon them for their existence and are there- fore ontologically less perfect. But, argues Anselm, we can conceive God to be a real being. Even the atheist can do that, for he knows what Anselm is trying to get him to believe and what he, the atheist, is denying. God the real being, however, is more perfect than God the infra-real being, and because we can conceive him we can con- ceive of a being more perfect than the infra-real God. And so the contradiction is generated in maintaining that the most perfect con- ceivable being is infra-real, for no infra-real being can be the most</page><page sequence="9">Ontological Vertigo 101 perfect conceivable being. Atheism is self -contradictory. From this An- selm infers that its denial, theism, is true. I suppose one might object that the problem here lies in our construal of 'being of the understanding'. That bizarre assumptions can lead to bizarre conclusions is not a very exciting discovery. But I don't think that only such an ontological construal of 'being of the understanding' makes the Ontological Argument immune to the "fatal objection." I think it is also immune to that objection if we construe 'being of the understanding' less extravagantly. I will try to show this now. 'Being' in that phrase is to be construed in our soft sense as anything concerning which it makes sense to ask whether it exists or not, whether or not it exists in fact. And such a being becomes a being of the understanding as soon as we understand enough about what it is we are looking for to get on with the job of looking for it. Atlantis is a being of the understanding in that sense. We understand it to be an island of a certain description located (probably) in the Atlantic Ocean. Two people can survey the evidence for its existence and really both be looking for evidence of the existence of the same thing. But the fact that they are both looking for evidence of the existence of the same thing has no ontological implications. We may also construe the second premise of the Ontological Argument in this way. That both Anselm and the atheist can agree to God's being a being of the understanding need mean no more than that both agree that they are talking about the same thing and know enough about it to inquire into its existence. How much one has to know is difficult to say. I need to know very little about Escher buildings or the geometrical properties of square circles in order to come to some conclusion about their existence. The first premise of the Ontological Argument supplies all the information we need to get on with deciding about the existence of God. You don't have to be able to give a description of, or have a very clear idea of what the most perfect conceivable being is like. All you need to know is something negative: that if you can think of a more perfect being than the one you're thinking of, then you are not thinking of God, but of something else. And this very little is ap- parently enough. If I tell you that Atlantis exists then 'exists' surely conveys some very interesting information not already supplied in presenting the topic, Atlantis. It is true that as a rule we take for granted that people talk about real things but anyone who has any knowledge at all of Atlantis</page><page sequence="10">102 Peter Preuss will not take that for granted in this case. It seems then that sometimes, at least, to be told that something does or does not exist is to be genuinely informed. So it seems that sometimes, at least, 'exists' suc- ceeds in becoming a genuine epistemological predicate. But there does seem to be something special about 'exists' when it functions as a predicate. Suppose I ask you to find a mountain 2374 meters high with a weathered monolith at the top from which the sea is visible. Sup- pose also that you cooperate and search in various mountainous re- gions near the sea for a while, but without success. Then you read a novel in which such a mountain features and claim to have found the mountain I asked for. But I insist that I want the real mountain, I want you to find it in the real world, not in fiction. I do this, let us say, knowing very well that no such mountain can be found be- cause it doesn't exist. I only made it up because I have a liking for impossible tasks. What have I done by insisting as I do? It seems I have made real existence part of the definition of the mountain. And what does that amount to? Well, it neither amounts to nothing, nor to very much. It amounts to excluding fictitious mountains, for exam- ple, so it does amount to something. But it certainly does not add to the furniture of the universe. I cannot make something real merely by saying that it is. Real existence may or may not be a defining feature of an object; in either case it does not settle whether the object exists. It seems I can, without contradiction, deny the real existence of some- thing defined as really existing. Surely there is something very odd in this, and philosophers have tried to isolate and explain this oddity. But the general problem with such explanations, as regards their rele- vance to the Ontological Argument, is that either they go too far, or they fail to touch the argument more than superficially. One might try to capture the basic fallacy of the Ontological Argu- ment by pointing out that it attempts to infer an extensional statement about God from an intensional statement about God. But intensional statements, one might insist, do not imply extensional statements. Such an inference is, therefore, fallacious.6 If the view that intensional statements don't imply extensional statements were correct, then the Ontological Argument would surely be irreparably unsound. But, of course, that view is mistaken. Intensional statements about M. C. Escher's Belvedere imply extensional statements about that building. This attempt to explain the oddity evident in the predicative function of existence has clearly gone too far. One might try a qualification and admit that some intensional statements imply negative extensional</page><page sequence="11">Ontological Vertigo 103 statements, but that no intensional statements imply positive extensional statements. But I have never seen that view defended nor do I see how it could plausibly be defended. Would not the Ontological Argument be a good counterexample unless it could be defeated on other grounds? Perhaps we should say that 'existence' is not a first-level property, a property of objects, but a second-level property, a property of con- cepts. It is not clear that this view is correct,7 but even if it were, I doubt that the Ontological Argument would be seriously touched by it. Suppose that 'existence' is a second-level property, that is, suppose that to say 'X exists' is not to say anything about X but about the concept 'X', namely that it is not empty or that it is instantiated. To say 'There is a pebble in my shoe', then, is not to say anything about pebbles, but rather about the concept 'pebble in my shoe'. To ask 'Is there any salt in this porridge?' is not to ask about salt or porridge, but about the concept 'salt in this porridge'. And to ask 'Is there a God?' or 'Does God exist?' is to ask about the concept 'God'. "Very well," a religious person might say, "tell me about the concept. Is it or is it not instantiated? Everything depends on that for me." The Ontological Argument could now be reformulated in such a way that rather then speaking of the existence of God it spoke of the instan- tiation of the concept 'God'. One might, of course, object that con- cepts do not imply anything about their instantiations. But that would be going too far again. Escher's Belvedere is an obvious counterexam- ple to that objection. One could try to qualify the objection in such a way as to aim it not at concepts which imply that they are not instan- tiated, but only at concepts which someone thinks imply that they are instantiated. But surely an argument would be required to sustain this qualification. Why is one kind of concept acceptable and the other not? I know of no such argument, nor do I see how such an argument would go. Again, I think, the concept of God would be a good counter- example, unless the Ontological Argument were defeated on other grounds. It may be possible to translate existence claims into expressions which do not use 'existence' or any of its forms.8 Surely there is some point to this kind of exercise, but I don't believe it affects the On- tological Argument. In the new language one can surely still wonder whether there is a pebble in my shoe, a squound in my attic, or a God. And if the new language prevents our concluding, merely from a</page><page sequence="12">104 Peter Preuss scrutiny of the concept, that, while there may be a pebble in my shoe, there cannot be a squound in my attic, then the new language is defective. And if it does not prevent that, then the fact that existence claims may be so translated is irrelevant to the Ontological Argument, though it may be relevant to how it is best formulated.9 It seems that nothing stands in the way of accepting that 'existence' is a predicate, even if an odd one. But this oddity affects the Onto- logical Argument no more than it affects a similar argument in reverse about Escher buildings. Perhaps all that is important here is to under- stand that when the existence of something is in doubt then to be in- formed about the existence of that thing really is to be informed. And sometimes a mere conceptual scrutiny can provide that information. Nothing more is required for 'existence' to be an epistemological predicate in the required sense. We can also understand that 'existence' is a perfection in at least some cases, the case of God included. If an architect designed an Escher building he might draw praise from his associates for many features of the design, but the fact that the building cannot be built is a defect. The necessary non-existence of the building is a flaw in the design if the design was commissioned by a builder. Could he remove the Escher quality from the design without jeopardizing its desirable features the architect would have improved his design, made it more perfect. Possible existence is a perfection in buildings. My young son follows the careers of Superman and Steve Austin with keen interest and we frequently invent exploits for them. But, when in telling him how Theseus slew the great Procrustes and the dread Minotaur, his eyes light up in a new way when I tell him that, unlike "Supy" and "Steve," Theseus was real (wasn't he?) . Frequently when I tell him a story he will ask whether the hero is real or just "pretend." And I have heard him, when debating the stature of super-heroes with his friends include that one is real and the other only "pretend" as a stature-increasing property, and have this be quite readily accepted. The exploits of a hero may be dramatic and unequaled by any real hero, but his being only "pretend" is quite readily accepted as a defect by these children. In a loftier vein we might describe a certain coun- selor to a king and do such a good job of it that the king might con- sult him in his imagination much as we might, when in need of ad- vice, wonder what Gandalf or some other wise man of fiction would advise in this case. But, given the choice between such an imaginary</page><page sequence="13">Ontological Vertigo 105 counselor and a real one with equal wisdom, etc. surely the king would prefer the real one. Characters of fiction can be important sources of strength and guidance but real counselors are preferable just as are real paintings, real sweethearts and many other things besides. Whether or not existence is in every case a perfection, it surely is so with God. Ask any worshipper. In fact, for the religious devotee, everything depends on the existence of God. However perfect God may be in all other respects, if he is only an imaginary God, if he is only "pretend " and not real, he would not be worthy of worship. Only a God who really exists is good enough for that. I think it follows from what has been said that the Ontological Argument is immune to its most formidable objection. If one puts as much effort into the argument as into the objection, the argument turns out the more convincing of the two. And yet the objection has taken its toll. The argument carried the day but became too sparse, too miserly as a consequence. We faulted Gaunilo for tampering with the first premise. It is true that you cannot insist that the most perfect con- ceivable being be redescribed in just any way you please and still expect the argument to work. But it is also true that the most perfect conceivable being cannot be one which only exists because existence is not the only perfection. If, in order to survive Gaunilo's objection the argument must forbid tampering with the first premise to the extent that it is in principle restricted to the existence of the being at issue and cannot be about any other property, then it really is an argument about the most perfectly existing being. However the argu- ment interpreted in this way would be received, it is a significantly different argument from the Ontological Argument. Probably this new argument would be dismissed for rather flagrantly begging the ques- tion. This would, I think, be rather superficial a reaction. In their own peculiar way all deductive arguments have a question-begging quality. Perhaps it needn't beg the question quite so flagrantly, and surely one of its premises could still be the supposition that this being didn't exist so that the required contradiction is generaed. But it would be a signi- ficantly different argument from the Ontological Argument because whether or not God exists is left an open issue. If the Ontological Argument must restrict itself to the existence of the being at issue it may prove that this being exists, but it cannot say what his being is, whether it is the universe as a whole, some particularly stable element</page><page sequence="14">106 Peter Preuss within the universe, or whether it is God. If the toll taken by Gaunilo's objection is as great as this, then Gaunilo carries the day after all, for he will have crippled the victorious argument so badly that the price for victory is the inability to say anything about God, including that it is he who must exist. It seems that Gaunilo's intuition was at least partly right: we must specify the most perfect conceivable being more than the first premise does. But the rest of Gaunilo's intuition is that this further specification is uncontrollable. There are no apparent rules. Anyone can specify this being as he pleases and so prove the existence of the God he fancies, even if this extends to absurdity. Gaunilo's intuition then, is that we must further specify the being at issue but cannot be sure that in so specifiying we continue to speak of God. To insist that we specify in a way guided by the conception of God which the best minds of Christendom have is arbitrary. That conception changes, but God does not change (or does he?) . And why limit it to Christendom, and why to the best minds? Do not Mohammedans have anything worth saying about God, and surely the greatest saints were not also the best minds. But perhaps we need not enter that sort of debate. Are we not simply required to unpack the concept of perfection? Even if we can- not give an exhaustive description of the most perfect conceivable being can we not nevertheless say a good deal about it? For example, goodness seems pretty clearly to be a perfection, as does wisdom and power. It seems that we are on safe ground if we run goodness, wisdom and power through the same argument as the Ontological Argument for that being's existence. And we needn't stop there. What of merci- ful, truthful, incorruptible, and so on? I think if we fell to unpacking our concept of perfection we could come up with quite a formidable list of divine properties. Even if we did not list every property which had some right to be considered a perfection but limited the list to those which had as much right or more to be considered a perfection as had existence, we would still have a formidable list. Could we be wrong about one of them? What is the force of this question? Well once upon a time it was thought a necessary truth that swans were white, and then black ones were discovered. Think of a philosopher who had just listed the essen- tial properties of swans before black ones were found being asked that question. He might have been asked: suppose the bird had all the other properties, need it be white, could you be wrong about that</page><page sequence="15">Ontological Vertigo 107 property? Biologists answered that question in the affirmative, of course. And so in our case. Could you conceive of dying, meeting God and discovering that some of the properties at least were erroneously ascribed to him? What you had in mind when you ascribed wisdom, for example, might turn out to have been a curious anthropomorphism, a projection of a favorite uncle's qualities onto God. Now that you are dead you know that that was foolish. And how about power? We don't think a feeble God very perfect, but when the Christian God revealed himself in man he did so as a gentle man who allowed a few soldiers to nail him to a cross. Perhaps your conception of power too is mistaken. We might want to say that while our list of perfections captured God fairly well, none is sacrosanct, any single one by itself might be mistaken or seriously distorted. After all, it was only our understanding of God and there is no guarantee that we are quite right on all counts. But the trouble is that existence is one of that list. If none of the properties in the list is inviolable then we must be willing to admit that we could be wrong about any one of them, existence included. To extend the description of the most perfect conceivable being beyond existence is, it seems, to throw new doubt on existence. If each property is added to our conception of the most perfect conceivable being by a separate argument like the Ontological Argument two pro- blems are introduced. The first we have just encountered. If we can admit doubt about any one of them that doubt necessarily affects the Ontological Argument itself. We had restricted our list to properties with as much right or more to be considered perfections as existence. Existence therefore has no privileged position and becomes subject to doubt. And if there are no other properties with as much or more right to be considered perfections as existence, then we are unable to specify the first premise further and must restrict ourselves to the existence of the being at issue. We have already seen that this effec- tively destroys the argument. The second difficulty with adding each new perfection to our con- ception of God with a separate argument is that there is no guarantee that all these arguments are about the same being. The Ontological Argument merely proves God's existence not his goodness, and so on with the other perfections. There is no guarantee that if we prove God's goodness by a separate argument that the God in this argument is the same God as the one the Ontological Argument is about, But</page><page sequence="16">108 Peter Preuss could one not, rather than simply speak of one perfection at a time, speak of a conjunction of them? But in that case to infect the con- junction with doubt because one of the conjuncts may be doubtful (even if we cannot say which one) is to destroy the force of the argu- ment. Would we want to say that we could not possibly be wrong about any property we deem to be a perfection? That seems to be too extra- vagant, more extravagant even than saying that we could not pos- sibly ever change our minds about the nature of perfection. Surely everyone will admit that his present conception of perfection is more considered, more mature and in significant respects different from the conception he had as a child. And many would also admit, I think, that there is some explanation of how the ball came to exist, illustra- so the Ontological Argument becomes ever more infected with doubt and affected with uncertainty. A new set of objections has come to the fore and succeeded in draining the argument of its persuasive force. These objections are not new, however, in the sense of having been strategically withheld earlier so as to be deployed at a convenient moment. They are objections which have grown out of a development of Gaunilo's intuition about the weak spot of the argument and so have come to take their toll in due time. But the Ontological Argument has a way of reasserting its force if we hold the present position up to mental scrutiny for even a short time. All we are doing in the Ontological Argument is to unpack a particular conception of perfection that we happen to have, one that may in many respects be problematical. But perhaps that is not so bad. We have certain views and they have certain implications. We cannot just ignore the implications of those views because we cannot be certain that one day we will not change those views. What matters is whether we are prepared to abandon those views after having con- sidered them and seen their implications. And unless we are prepared to accept an evil, imaginary and transitory being, for example, as the most perfect conceivable being we cannot just leave the Ontological Argument with a shrug. Of course the conception of a real, good, eternal (and so forth) being is just a conception of ours. But are we prepared to abandon it? Can we say that an imaginary God is as great, as important for our lives, as worthy of worship, in short, as perfect, as that God would be were he real? It seems inconceivable</page><page sequence="17">Ontological Vertigo 109 that anyone could seriously maintain that. And the same applies, I think, to a good God rather than an evil one, a wise one rather than a foolish one, and so on. All this is compatible with admitting that our concept of God is deficient and does not fully capture the divine nature, and it is also compatible with admitting that this is so not only because our list of perfections is incomplete, but also because our understanding of the various attributes itself is incomplete. Let us take existence for example. Perhaps a complete understanding of existence includes the view that beings of the understanding exist to a lesser degree than real beings, but nevertheless exist. And perhaps such an understanding would also include that there are degrees of being greater than real existence. A person with such an understanding would have to deny reality to God and attribute to him the highest conceivable degree of being. But all this is speculation. What matters is our actual understanding. Unless we are prepared to abandon it or are prepared to live with contradiction, the Ontological Argument reasserts itself with new force. And so a serious consideration of the Ontological Argument oc- casions vertigo, a kind of intellectual giddiness and double vision. The doubts and the force of it seem to have an uncanny ability to steal the limelight from each other and occasion a state of mind quite unlike that of the person who vacillates because he can't make up his mind. You might as well ask me to make up my mind whether I see two faces or a goblet in the famous picture. NOTES 1. Bertrand Russell describes his response in this way in "My Mental Development/' in The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell, edited by P. A. Schlipp (Evanston and Chicago, 1944) , p. 10. 2. I say 'ontological' for two reasons. First I wish to distingiush it from what William P.Alston called "logical vertigo" in "The Ontological Argument Revisited," The Philosophical Review, (1960), p. 462; and second, because I think that it is an intellectual condition somehow characteristic of the Ontological Argument. 3. While the objection that 'existence* is not a predicate is generally credited to Kant it was not original with him.
