'UNFORTUNATELY', writes Prof. Stebbing, 'there are famous scientists who do not seem to realise that their subject has an intrinsic interest for the common reader, and accordingly they seek to arouse his emotions, thereby inducing a frame of mind inimical to intellectual discernment' (5.5). Why then does the common reader go on and on buying fairy stories in scientific clothing ? If he went on buying up edition after edition of Round the World in Forty Seconds, in spite of its containing only blank pages, one could hardly call that interest in travel. Why, then, if for a decade he has tirelessly devoured The Mysterious Universe and The Nature of the Physical World, should this be called a straightforward interest in science ? Is it not better called an interest in the alleged 'philo- sophical implications' of physical theories, in their supposed 'far- reaching consequences for philosophy' ? (ix, 5). What the common reader has shown interest in is whether real, brown, solid tables are really real, brown and solid, whether matter is not after all thought, whether we really have power to do what we have power to do, whether there is a god, and so on, and whether scientific theories have any bearing on these problems. How else are we to describe the fact that by comparison with Prof. Eddington's enquiry into those matters such a work as Prof. Thomson's elegant, straight- forward account of the growth and nature of " atomic" hypotheses languishes ? 1 This is not in any way to mock at thli common reader for his interests, or at Jeans and Eddington for what they have written: it is rather to emphasise the extent of the service Prof. Stebbing has performed for the common reader in at last giving skilled consideration to their problems. As she many times emphasises, scientific or mathematical training is no guarantee of ability to deal with these problems; but in view of the decade that has elapsed between the appearance of The Nature of the Physical World and this, the first adequate consideration of it by a philo- sopher, it must appear either that 'philosophical training' (xi, 5) is no guarantee of it either, or that philosophers are unaware of what the common reader is thinking, or uninterested in what he thinks. 1 Cf. 100.7: 'lHe seems to regard his audiences as composed of childish persons ready to be charmed with parables and fancies.' 24</page><page sequence="2">362 CRITICAL NOTICES: Certainly it cannot be said that the majority of philosophers have ' avoided slipping into ' (xi, 5) the very pitfalls which have so readily received these able and honestly enquiring physicists; and it must be said that if philosophers had been more skilful in avoiding them, and been more in contact with common trends of opinion, there would surely have grown up a body of opinion sufficient to prevent them slipping into their largest pitfalls, and the public from being deluded by their crudest confnsions. But to call the confusions crude is, again, not to blame the physicists who fall into them and the public who follow, but rather the philosophers who have been so little able themselves to avoid them, or to assist others to do so. Prof. Stebbing's exhaustive exposition and criticism of these argu- ments should leave neither common reader, physicist, nor philo- sopher in doubt as to their worth, and one can only hope that her work will reach a high proportion of those places for which it is intended. That it is unlikely to do so is primarily due to no defect in the work, but rather to its merit; for few are likely to follow Prof. Stebbing through the rigour of her discussion with the prospect of having to abandon many comfortable notions. Prof. Stebbing has a particularly low opinion of the metaphysical extravagances of Jeans: his argument that there is a Great Architect of the Universe, who ' is a pure Mathematician, and that the Universe is his thoughts ' (14.6) is carefully analysed and shown to rest on simple confusions. This part of the book should be comprehensible by any reader, and any inclination to follow Jeans will have a struggle to survive it. There should be no difficulty in following her refusal to be terrified by Jeans' picture of us as beings 'standing on a microscopic fragment of a grain of sand ' in a universe of ' vast, meaningless distances', 'terrifying because of our extreme loneliness, and because of the material insignificance of our home in space', 'terrifying because it appears to be indifferent to life like our own' (p. 9): she therefore stands in no need of the comfort she refuses to accept., viz., that ' there is no matter to be afraid of, and no meaning- less distances to appal us ' (14.6), 'we are not terrified by the size of the structures which our own thoughts create ' (14.8). She prefers Ramsey's picture ' drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale; the foreground occupied by human beings, and the stars as small as threepenny bits ' (12.7). Still more reprehensible than this ' strangely perverted sense of values' (10.7) is Jeans' lack of consistency: 'To regard the laws of the universe as having been specially selected, to speak of laws as producing this, that, or the other is not considered by Jeans to be inconsistent with dismissing " every trace of anthropomorphism from our minds ".' Jeans is firmly, if justly, dealt with, and we pass to more lenient treatment when we come to consider Eddington's Barryesque picture of a measuring rod as a bewildered, wondering child which 'wants to do just as it did before', of the plank which is really just a swarm of flies, and the elephant sliding down a hill.</page><page sequence="3">L. SUSAN STEBBING, Philosophy and the Physicists. 363 In the third chapter, 'Furniture of the Earth', Prof. Stebbing first gives a list of things we know from time to time-e.g., that the table I am leaning on is real and not a shadow cast on the wall, is solid not transparent or malleable, is white not colourless, and so on; secondly, she remarks that if I say of this obviously solid table that it is not solid I am not 'speaking in conformity with the rules of good English' (46.9), and that I am ' expressing a denial in common- sense language used in such a way as to be devoid of sense' (51.7); for 'if the plank is non-solid, then what does "solid" mean?' (52.7), and 'if the plank is non-solid, then where can we find an example to show us what " solid " means ? ' (53.4). It might have been better to have augmented this point and (1) used it to throw light on the peculiar status of common-sense knowledge, so much debated now by philosophers and so vital to the problems we are dealing with, and (2) sacrificed some of her ' asides' to developing its force against Eddington's idea of 'the two tables, the ordinary and the scientific' ; i.e., if we say in the present example (where all my papers are on one table) that they are on two tables (and that there are two lots of papers), ' where can we find an example to show us what " one table " and " one lot of papers " means ? ' The dis- cussion which in fact follows concerning the absurdity of calling the scientific a ' shadow ' of the real table, and of saying that a ' coloured object is duplicated by something with regard to which it would be meaningless to say it is coloured ' (60.7), viz., a group of electric charges, and a comparison of this with the duplication of the Image- world and the Real-world by Descartes and Newton-all this discus- sion raises too many interesting points in a space too short to deal with them. Prof. Stebbing then deals with Eddington's ideas about the use of symbols in physics. He describes himself as playing a game called ' world-building', which is, as Prof. Stebbing puts it, the 'construc- tion of a general deductive system, i.e., of a mathematical structure ' (82.4). in which the laws of conservation of energy, mass, momentum, and of electric charge, and the law of gravitation are deduced from some highly general premisses. We must distinguish two kinds of philosophical trouble he gets into about this: (1) some rather obvious confusions which lead him to say such things as that we make natural laws, and do not discover them, that we add them to nature, and so on. These confusions are most adequately exposed in this chapter; (2) really serious difficulties about how mathe- matical equations are applied in physics, which lead him to the simpler confusions in (1); and serious difficulties about the nature of deductive systems, e.g., what Braithwaite has called the idea that the mathematical logician 'can make cement without lime' (74.6). Prof. Stebbing gives a very satisfactory account of the confusions in (1), and also of difficulties about the nature and application of deduc- tive systems: though, if it were not too much to ask in so brief an outline, the reader would be greatly helped by a more extended</page><page sequence="4">364 CRITICAL NOTICES: treatment of Prof. Stebbing's own positive.account of their nature and application. She well says, e.g., ' Eddington has so been able to build his world only because, at the present stage of the development of the physical sciences, he could take for granted the field laws, and could thus select just those hypotheses that are necessary and jointly sufficient to entail Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism' (76.5). And 'Only when the terms in the mathematical identities [in the structure] are identified with electric and magnetic quantities, can the identities be regarded as Maxwell's equations. . . . The justification for making the identification is that the electromagnetic equations are true as a matter of experimental fact ' (82.5). On the other hand, the reader would have been greatly assisted by a fuller exposition of Prof. Stebbing's own view that the field laws are now in the position of ' conventions ', i.e., ' experimental facts will now be so interpreted as to be consistent with them' (86.3); she says also that they are ' guiding principles in physical science ' (87.1), and that 'the mind selects from Nature those properties that are conformable to the conservation laws ' (90.6). This assistance to the reader could very usefully have been given by taking some simple case in which the phenomena are prima facie not conformable to a given conservation law, and considering how scientists would deal with the case, and what they would do if more and more cases of prima facie non-conformity arose. Without consideration of such cases, the phrases 'guiding principle' (etc.) are no more than suggestive. Would one ever reach a point at which to express the truth one would have to say, ' It is a fact about the natural world that it can not be so ordered that conservation laws apply to it' (86.8) ? or could one equally express the truth by saying, 'The world is so ordered that the conservation laws still apply, provided we make sufficient supplementary hypotheses' ? There follows an excellent criticism of Eddington's description of the mind as occupied by an editor who decodes obscure telegrams conducted to him by wires (nerves) coming from an outside world of inscrutable nature. Similarly, behind sets of positive readings there stands an inscrutable nature; and another stands behind at least one of the terms in the set of cyclic definitions; and another stands as that which connects the 'two worlds '-the shadow and the familiar. I shall not go into the detail of the arguments on these points, as they are on the whole well known to philosophers and comparatively straightforward. But, if I may pick out a point for criticism, it is the definition Prof. Stebbing offers of 'Nature '- viz., 'whatever is, or could be, sensibly experienced together with the occasions and conditions of what can be sensibly experienced and the modes of their interconnections' (115.1), which, 'in certain of its aspects' is ' the theme of study propounded to the physicist', viz., in ' those aspects that are susceptible of mathematical treatment' (115.2), ' of metrical treatment' (117.1). The common reader, to say nothing of the philosopher, would have been greatly helped by</page><page sequence="5">L. SUSAN STEBBING, Philosophy and the Physicists. 365 the giving of the examples required to explain the terms 'sensibly experienced', 'wwhat can be sensibly experienced', 'occasions', ' conditions', and especially by examples of 'what is not susceptible of mathematical, or metrical, treatment'. Shorn of the examples, these words only hint at what Prof. Stebbing has in mind. We come now to a section called' Causality and Human Freedom'. Before giving what Eddington (and other physicists) and she herself have to say on the topic, she has the excellent idea of giving an outline of the difficulties in which Mill and Huxley found themselves, and which Eddington is trying to escape from by way of a ' Principle of Indeterminacy '. She then defines a 'deterministic system' as one in which 'if the initial state of the system and the laws of its behaviour are known, then its states at any other moment can be predicted, and the prediction can be verified by measurement. Any science which is wholly based upon such reasoning may be said to be a physically determined system, and its " scheme of law " is a deterministic scheme of law. The theories of classical physics provide an example of such a deterministic scheme ' (170.8). She then gives a very useful account of recent developments which have 'sshown that in the case of sub-atomic phenomena it is in principle impossible to determine precisely the initial conditions ' (171.4). To do so one would have to measure both the initial position and the initial momentum of a given particle: in order to measure the first accurately one requires to use radiation of very short wave-length, and in order to measure the second accurately one requires radiation of a comparatively long wave-lengthl; for radiation of short wave-length would consist of photons of great energy, part of which would be lost to the given particle and so alter its momentum. Prof. Stebbing is content with saying: And so 'it is not possible, even in principle, to know the initial conditions in the case of quantum phenomena ' (182.3), and ' the development of quantum mechanics has shown that no precise meaning can be given to the combination of momentum and position as simultaneously ascertainable in the case of an electron ' (182.7). (She must, I think, mean: 'no meaning can be given to the combination of momentum and position as simultaneously precisely ascertainable in the case of an electron'.) But a crucial point is not made clear in her account. She says of 'tthe radiation would have to be of very short wave-length' that ' This is equivalent to saying that the radiation would consist of photons of very great energy' (180.4). Does she mean that from the fact that a radiation is of very short wave-length it follows logically that it consists of photons of high energy ? or that this connexion is so as a matter of fact ? If it is the latter, one can say: 'This impossibility can hardly be one of principle, since one can imagine a radiation of short wave-length, to be discovered not con- sisting of photons of high energy; and if this were done, we might precisely measure the two simultaneously '. If the former, one</page><page sequence="6">366 CRITICAL NOTICES: might say, 'I'm not prepared to lay it down that nothing will ever be suggested which it would be proper to call " measuring with precision the position and momentum of such a particle simul- taneously ", and the empirical facts you have adduced do not, as you can see, force me to abandon saying in this case as in others: " The future position and momentum must be determined by some- thing which is the case now " ' . I feel that the matter is far from settled until the possibility of someone's saying such things as this has been considered, and until it is considered whether the difference between this and what Prof. Stebbing says is a question of fact (it is obvious that the two are apparently inconsistent), or whether it is a difference of attitude. We shall now have to pass over much that Prof. Stebbing says about probability, which is both interesting and within the compass of the common reader, in order to come to her treatment of free will where, I fear, I find some things rather confused, and feel that the common reader's understanding of the problem has not been as much assisted as it might have been. If one thing excites the common reader's interest in recent physical theory, it is its supposed relevance to the problem or problems which have been discussed under the name of " free will ". This chapter therefore is of the first importance, and unfortunately it cannot be said that either the statement of the problems or their treatment is as careful as it seems justifiable to expect. One statement of 'tthe problem' is as follows: (A) ' The problem of free will does not present itself to plain men as a problem of analysis, but rather as a problem of reconciliation' (224.5), viz., between ' our beltiefs concerning the nature of the physical world' and each of the following: (1) ' the fact of our intuition of freedom'; (2) ' our beliefs with regard to the correct analysis of that intuition'; (3) 'our beliefs with regard to the nature of the conditions of moral responsibility.' The question ' What beliefs concerning the nature of the physical world ? ' is answered thus (222.6) (i) (a) classical physics; (b) evolutionary biology. About those the problem is whether they 'involve the denial of freedom '. (ii) recent physical speculations. About these two problems are mentioned, (X) whether they lead to the reaffirmation of freedom; (f) whether they have any bearing at all on the problem.</page><page sequence="7">L. SUSAN STEBBING, Philosophy and the Physicists. 367 But later we find a different statement, viz., that (B) 'TThe prob7em of free will does not arise until we pass from the notion of being responsible for [an action] to the notion of being responsible for [an action] to [somebody or something] ' (227.5), and still later a third, (C) ' The problem of freedom is the problem of the self ' (249.7). On page 222.5 we find the following: ' The right way to approach the problem of human freedom is to attempt to answer the question:- What do we suppose ourselves to be asserting when we say (i) that we are free, or alternatively, (ii) that our actions are free, or at least, (iii) that sometimes we act freely ? ' This question can be taken in two ways: (1) as asking for an account of a philosophical theory, viz., the theory that we have free will, (2) as asking what is the analysis of succh ordinarily used propositions as the following: (i) 'I am free to keep or break my promise.' (ii) 'My act in refusing the offer is free.' (iii) 'I acted freely in refusing the offer.' I take it that (2) is what is intended. Now (2, i) can be put in the words 'I have the power to keep or break my promise'; (2, ii) in the words ' My act in refusing the offer is deliberate '; (2, iii) in the words ' I acted consciously in refusing the offer'. Having apparently said that the right way to approach the problem of human freedom is to attempt to analyse such propositions, Prof. Stebbing mentions the statement 'I have the power to keep this promise ' and remarks ' What it is to act, to be cpnscious of acting, to have a power of acting in such and such a way-these admit of analysis. . . .With these analyses we are not concerned' (224.5). And again she writes: ' To me it does not seem that any puzzling questions arise in connexion with the statement " I did it ", or with its elabora- tion in the form " I am responsible for it" ' (227.3). Yet later she does in fact go on to treat the problem in the way she originally said it should be approached, and says: 'Responsibility, it must be emphasised, is ascribed to persons. Whatever difficulties there may be in the notion of responsibility, it may safely be asserted that their solution must presuppose a satisfactory account of what it is to be " a person ", what it is that " I " in the sentence " I acted freely " refers to ' (238.6). Then she proceeds some way with analysis of 'I did this' in saying that it entails (a) 'TThis sprang from what I</page><page sequence="8">368 CRITICAL NOTICES: was', and (b) ' It is false that this was spontaneous, uncaused': the relevant passage is: ' Let it be granted that " heredity, training and other predetermining causes " have made me what I am. Surely I am still responsible for what I do. Suppose, however, that my . . .decisions are spontaneous, uncaused, in no sense springing from what I am. How then can I be said to be responsible for that which issues from that choice ? It would, indeed, be a straining of language to say either that it was " an act of choice " or that it was " mine " ' (239.3). We shall return later to the analysis of 'I did this', and only ask for the moment why Prof. Stebbing at first asserts that to attempt to analyse it is the right way to approach the problem of free will, then denies that it is relevant to it at all, but finally does herself treat it as relevant and actually suggests an analysis. It seems to me that she has made the following formal slip: she points out that the problem presents itself to plain men not as a problem of analysis but rather of reconciliation, and assumes that from the fact that it is one of reconciliation it follows that it is not one of analysis. But this does not follow unless we say that it is a problem only of reconciliation, and it is easy to see that it is in fact a problem both of reconciliation and analysis. The problem given in (A) above is roughly: 'Is (oc) " every event is completely determined by earlier events " compatible with (f) " I am free to do this ", and with (y) " I am morally responsible for doing this " ? ' Plainly, in order to decide this one would require to attempt a most careful analysis of 'I am free to do this'. Again, if we take the problem referred to in (B) above, we get: ' Is (oc) " a being has predestined my ways" compatible with (,B) " I am morally responsible for doing this"?'; and this too one cannot answer without a most careful analysis of 'I am free to do this'. The reason for this need not be laboured: it is that in their ordinary senses ' I am responsible for this ' entails ' I am free to do this '; or, if the matter is retrospective, ' I was free in doing this ', ' I did this ', ' I had the power to do or not to do this'. If we say, for example, " He could not help it; he was driven to it by an inherited madness ", it is inconsistent to add, " And he is morally responsible for having done it ". Thus if 'He did it ' is inconsistent with ' Every event is completely deter- mined', then also' He is responsible for having done it' is inconsistent with it: and this is the reason given in controversies about free will for their being inconsistent. And the reason given for saying that ' He did it ' is inconsistent with ' Every event is completely determined ' is this: To say that 'He did it' is to say, in part, that the doing of it was not completely determined by earlier events, which is plainly inconsistent with the proposition above. This is in fact how Prof. Stebbing does deal with the problem. She enables herself to assert that 'Every event is completely determined' is not inconsistent with 'I am responsible for this' by giving as an analysis of 'I did this', 'This was deter-</page><page sequence="9">L. SUSAN STEBBING, Philosophy and the Physicists. 369 mined by what I am', and adding that 'This was in part undeter- mined' is not entailed by 'I did this'. Unfortunately, her statements on the topic do not enable us to be clear as to what she takes the relation to be between ' He is responsible for this ' and ' He did this '. Is it one of entailment or matter of fact connexion ? Here is what she says:- (1) ' Ordinarily, I think, we accept responsibility for those changes in a situation which result from our activity' (225.7). (2) ' What we inadvertently do is just that for which we are not conscious of responsibility ' (226.7). (3) ' " I am responsible for this " means " This has happened . . . and my decision was a causal factor in its happening " ' (225.9). (4) ' " I am responsible for it " is an elaboration of " I did it"' (227.4). The first of these makes a statement of fact, viz., that the changes about which, as a matter of fact, we are prepared to say ' I am responsible for this ' are those which result from our own activity; whereas (3) and (4) are the assertion that if we say ' I am responsible for this change' we are by that already saying that this change is one resulting from our own activity, and, substituting in (1), we should get ' Ordinarily we accept it that our decision is a causal factor in the happening of those changes which result from our activity '. One cannot have it both ways, and it is of the first importance to make clear whether we are concerned with something which is part of the meaning of 'He is responsible' or with something which is commonly held to be associated,with being responsible. We have to ask in fact, 'Was the problem of free will rightly stated in the form (A, 3) above ? Are we concerned to reconcile "our beliefs with regard to the nature of the physical world " with "our beliefs with regard to the nature of the conditions of moral responsibility ", or with what is being said of a person when it is said that he is morally responsible? ' It is a serious omission that this question is not treated. (A, 3) suggests the following: We are dealing with a conflict of opinions: one (that every event is completely determined) a hypo- thesis held by scientists, and (until recently) amply supported by their investigations; the other the commonly held opinion of ordinary people, and so, presumably, based on experience and yet liable to confutation by further experience (the common opinion that the sun puts the fire out is based on what we see when it shines on a fire, but is confuted by more careful observation). Thus Sir William Bragg (quoted p. 233) says that in addition to scientific laboratories 'we have another laboratory, wherever we meet our fellow men, and there also we learn by experience, and make observations on which we base our thoughts and actions. We feel that we have some control over what we do, and may act selfishly or unselfishly. If the lessons</page><page sequence="10">370 CRITICAL NOTICES: of the two laboratories seem to contradict each other, etc.'. Again, Eddington speaks of ' doubting " our intuition of free will" ' (223.9). And Prof. Stebbing writes: 'I am conscious of having power to act' (224.3); and ' What we inadvertently do is just that for which we are not conscious of responsibility' (226.7). In these passages we find the varied suggestions that what justifies us in saying 'I have power to do so and so' is learning by experience, making observations, feeling that I have power, intuition, consciousness that I have power. The general idea of the last three is, to put it coarsely, that we've got a hunch that we've got power to do this and that: and passages already quoted suggest that we've also got a hunch that we're responsible for a thing only if we had power to have done otherwise. Since it is a conflict between our hunch and what is alleged to be established by scientists, nothing could be more important than to try and see how we come by our hunch, and yet Prof. Stebbing does not attempt this at all. The reader can hardly fail at this point to recall some instances earlier in the book where Prof. Stebbing did with some success defend the plain man's hunch against the scientist's attack, and that her method was to show that the alleged hunch wasn't a hunch after all; and so to surmise that here too it may turn out to be no mere hunch that we have power to do this and that. Scientists seem now to have produced reason to suppose that we never really have the power to do this or that, and that hence we are never really respon- sible for doing this or that, just as earlier they seemed to have produced reason to suppose that ordinary tables are not real, never really red, or solid, and so on. What was effective before may be effective again, and it may be worth while to consider these earlier arguments. Let us take one which Prof. Stebbing used to show that Eddington had not succeeded in giving an argument which proved that no material thing is ever solid. She writes: 'It is worth while to examine with some care what exactly it is that Eddington is denying when he asserts that " the plank has no solidity of substance ". What are we to understand by " solidity " ? Unless we do understand it we cannot understand what the denial of solidity to the plank amounts to. But we can understand " solidity " only if we can truly say that the plank is solid. For " solid " just is the word we use to describe a certain respect in which a plank of wood resembles a block of marble, a piece of paper, and a cricket ball, and in which each of these differs from a sponge, etc. . . . The point is that the common usage of language enables us to attribute a meaning to the phrase " a solid plank " ' (51.8 sq.). Could she not with equal effect have written: 'It is worth while</page><page sequence="11">L. SUSAN STEBBING, Philosophy and the Physicists. 371 to examine with some care what exactly it is that the scientist is denying when he asserts that we never act freely. What are we to understand by " freely " ? Unless we do understand it we cannot understand what the denial of freedom to the human being amounts to. But we can understand " freely " only if we can truly say that, e.g., Jones in giving ?100,000 to the hospital acted freely. For " freely " just is the word we use to describe a certain respect in which this piece of behaviour of Jones resembles that of Smith in robbing the bank, and differs from that of Robinson who was found shoplifting after drugs, and that of Robertson who signed away ?100,000 with a pistol at his head. . . . The point is that the common usage of language enables us to attribute a meaning to the phrase " a free action ".' Thus common usage of language makes the distinction between something done deliberately and something done inadvertently (as Prof. Stebbing says on p. 226.4), between 'Jones himself signed it' and 'Jones signed it-under compulsion ', between ' Jones had the power to sign or not to sign' and 'Jones was powerless in the matter of signing or not signing', between ' The signing was his act ' and ' His hand signed, but it was no act of his'. The scientist wishes us to deny that the first of each of these pairs is ever true, and his reason may be expressed thus: The use of each of these statements (and we have picked up their use from other people in picking up our ordinary language) is such that, if any movement, e.g., the movement of Jones' hand in writing his name, was completely determined, then the statement is untrue of that event. Now every event is completely determined, therefore there are no events of which these statements are true. But what is the evidence for the premiss that these statements are so used that if an event is completely determined the statement is untrue of it ? The evidence ought to be careful consideration of how we do in the ordinary way use such statements, what a person has to learn to look for in learning to say ' This was his act' whenever (if at all) it is his act, and to say 'He had no power to do otherwise' whenever (if at all) he had none. Some of the things he has to learn to look for are plain: e.g., whether Jones was asleep when he did it, or drugged, or hypnotised, or has a mania for signing whenever he sees a cheque, or is no longer in possession of all his faculties, and so on; and, on the other side, whether he suffered from none of these dis- abilities, discussed with his friends whether or not he should sign, was not greatly persuaded to it or against it, ruminated over it for a time, and so on, and then went and signed. This is a rough outline of the way we draw the distinction, and it is undoubtedly a useful one in everyday affairs. For example, if we wish to prevent the recurrence of actions of a certain sort, e.g., the signing of cheques which will be dishonoured, we shall hardly succeed unless we can distinguish thd cases where the person could have avoided doing as he did, and where a reprimand (more or less severe) is likely to prevent recurrence, from those unavoidable by the agent, where treatment</page><page sequence="12">372 CRITICAL NOTICES: for the drugged or unbalanced condition, or reprimand of those who gave the drugs, or of those who threatened his life is required. And if we say of a wrong action, ' He did it ', ' It was his deliberate action', we tend to have towards him an attitude of disapproval and perhaps to express it in our way of uttering the words, and to reprimand and perhaps punish him; whereas if of some good deed we say 'He did it' or ' It was his deliberate action', etc., we tend to have rather an attitude of approval and to express it in our way of saying the words, and to praise him and maybe decorate him. But if of the wrong action we say, 'He did not do it, though it was the work of his hand', 'He cannot have done it deliberately', we do not in general disapprove of him for his part in it, nor do we tend to repri- mand him or punish him, but rather to remove or discourage the circumstances-e.g., we imprison the man who held the pistol over him, or blackmailed him, or otherwise got him unduly in his power; or, if his action was due to mental unbalance, we send him for treat- ment or, if he is beyond treatment, place him where he cannot repeat his action, and so on. Now suppose we follow the scientists' suggestion and, if we are agreed that every event is completely determined, agree never to say of a man who forges a cheque ' He did it ', ' It was his deliberate action ', ' He did it under no com- pulsion ', 'He had the power to sign or not to sign', but always to say some such thing as ' Circumstances determined him to sign a worthless cheque': then we can do one or other of two things, either (1) we can do as we did before-have the attitude of dis- approval to him, and reprimand him, and punish him by imprison- ment, or (2) we may change our attitude with our words and have to him the attitude we now have to those who do wrong acts under duress, and fail to reprimand him, and not punish him at all. If we do the second, the scientist has indeed persuaded us, but the results will not be fortunate: absence of disapproval and kindliness of treatment will lead to the abandonment of the cheque system, of purchasing rather than shoplifting, and many others of our present arrangements. But if we do the first, nothing will have been altered but our words; we shall fail to mark in our words the distinction we at present mark with the pair 'free '-' compelled', etc., but we shall have different attitudes to and treat the two cases differently just as before. Is not this highly comparable with Eddington's wishing to persuade us to abandon the use at present made of ' solid' and 'not solid', and yet no doubt wishing to continue to make the distinction ? for even he would still wish to distinguish the solid roof-beam from the worm-eaten, the plank that will bear one from the plank that won't; i.e., he wishes us to say of our floor, 'No, no, it's not solid' in the confident tone appropriate to ' Yes, of course, it's solid ', and step on it in the confident way appropriate to belief in this. One way of expressing this is that he wishes us to say: 'So you see, solid things are not really solid', and ' So you see, free actions</page><page sequence="13">L. SUSAN STEBBING, Philosophy and the Physicists. 373 are not really free '. ' What we have power to do we have not, of course, really power to do.' 'People never really do things; they just occur ', etc. His procedure is unlike that of the philosopher who tries to persuade us that the plank is not literally solid because it is really a group of sense-data, in that, whereas the philosopher only draws our attention to well-known facts of illusion, double vision, after images, and so on, the scientist does give us new facts on which to base his claim, viz., some of the experimental evidence leading to the electron hypothesis; and the only question in dispute is whether these new results are properly described as showing that solid things are not really solid. Similarly, the arguments against the truth of such statements as 'He did it' claim to be based on experimental results, viz., that, wherever it is tried, the idea that every event is completely deter- mined is indicated in scientific work; and it is supposed that these results are in conflict with the results of everyday observation. Let us see how this comes about. It is often said, 'The more you know of the criminal-his heredity, his early environment, his later associates, the hopelessness of his poverty, etc.-the less you blame him and the more you will try to reform him and his circumstances'. I.e., the more we can explain his act as determined by heredity or mental unbalance or vicious environment the less do we tend to say 'iHe had the power to do otherwise' and so 'He is responsible'. Now in fact it is unreason- able to suppose his act not completely determined by prior circum- stances, and in fact we suppose the very movement of his hand in forging the signature to be explicable in terms of just prior events in his body and conditions near it; so it is unreasonable ever to say he had power to do otherwise. This is, on the whole, a correct account of ordinary usage. Once we know that an inherited passion, or extreme and desperate poverty, or absence of affection in childhood chiefly determined the stealing, it is no longer correct to say 'He could have done otherwise' and so 'He was to blame', and the less are we inclined to disapproval towards the person. But if someone in comfortable circumstances, in their right mind, having ' had every chance in life ', having planned carefully, and so on, forges a cheque or breaks a till, usage goes: 'He could have done otherwise' : yet if it is shown that children who have had their thumb frequently and forcibly taken from their mouths in early childhood suffer a tremendous temptation to steal, which can be removed by bringing these experiences to memory, and if he is shown to be one of these, then it would again become correct to say 'He could not have done otherwise'. In scientific investigation of a phenomenon we assume that if we probe carefully enough and far enough, we shall find the cause of it, the explanation of it. This most people would agree with; but to say that we assume it is to suggest that it is something for which, although we have no proof as yet, a proof (and equally a disproof)</page><page sequence="14">374 CPRITICAL NOTICES: could be given. Yet there can be no proof and no disproof of it- and here I must write shortly and dogmatically on a matter which requires elaborate and tentative discussion. Looking for causes and explanations of natural phenomena has been remarkably successful: ever so many phenomena which at first defied explanation have finally yielded to it, so that now in facing a new problem even after failure upon failure we encourage ourselves to the assault with the slogan, 'Nevertheless there must be an explanation', and when we still do not find one we excuse this by saying, 'We have not probed far enough'. 'There must be an explanation, though we have not yet probed far enough ' does not stand at the end of a proof, and our use of it does not envisage a proof for it. Nor does it envisage the possibility of a disproof of it; repeated failure to find an explana- tion does not constitute a disproof; but if we consistently failed to find one, to repeat our slogan would be the expression of a forlorn hope not of something which we use as provable or disprovable. Similarly, if the scientists' success in finding the complete deter- mining factors of this and that phenomenon encourages us to say, 'So we are not ultimately free', ' Ultimately we have not power to do this rather than that ', no one can object by saying they have a proof that what we say is false, nor even that it is improbable. What they can do is watch and see what use we make of our words, and object if we make a wrong one. We may, for example, say such words and cease to disapprove of people who forge signatures with no extenuating circumstance of heredity or environment, and cease to reprimand and punish them. But the scientists' success did not justify this change of attitude and course of action. Or we may say the words and change neither our attitude nor our action, but continue to disapprove, reprimand, and punish as before, not trying, where we do not already plainly know of them, to find circumstances to explain the person's action. But the scientists' success justifies something different from this, viz., the following: We may say the words, and, while not ceasing to disapprove, reprimand, and punish, as before, try by investigating at every turn what led to the behaviour in question to replace our attitude of disapproval, etc., by one of understanding what did bring about the behaviour and so become able to deal with such cases not by repri- manding and punishing the offender, but by arresting them at their sources. Thus, just as one might hang over the door of a science laboratory the motto, ' Ultimately every event is completely determined', so over a penal reform institute one might put, ' Ultimately no one is ever responsible'. I have given in outline how one might attempt to deal with the problem ' Do we ever really have the power to do this rather than that ? ' and allied questions, by the same method which Prof. Stebbing used in dealing with 'Are solid planks really solid ? ' and 'Are real</page><page sequence="15">L. SUSAN STEBBING, Philosophy and the Physicists. 375 tables really real ? ' Let us turn now to what Prof. Stebbing gives as a solution to the problem. 'Let it be granted', she says, 'that "heredity, training, and other predetermining causes " have made me what I am. Surely I am still responsible for what I do. Suppose, however, that my . . . decisions are spontaneous, uncaused, in no sense springing from what I am. How then can I be said to be responsible for that which issues from that choice ? It would, indeed, be a straining of language to say either that it was " an act of choice " or that it was " mine " ' (239.3). In various places she puts forward the following as analyses of ' I did this', ' This was my doing', ' I had power to do this or not': (1) This sprang (in some sense) from what I am (227.4). (2) This proceeded from what I am (249.6). (3) This proceeded from the person I am (242.3). (4) 1 (in some way) contributed to the occurrence of this (247.4). Her final word on the matter is: (5) ' The problem of freedom is the problem of the self. Human freedom consists in this (a) that we do not yet know what we shall be, because we are not yet finished, and (b) that what we have already become and are becoming plays a part in what we shall become.' It is hardly necessary to point out that each of these supposed analyses of ' I did this ', or explanations of what my freedom consists in, is nothing but a metaphorical picture of it-that it suffers in fact from the very defect of Jeans' and Eddington's supposed ex- planations which Prof. Stebbing has so clearly exposed. The act is pictured as springing from, proceeding from, being contributed to by something which is variously described as what I am, the person I am, what I have already become and am becoming, I. That she does take them as explanations is explicitly shown on page 242X2, where she says that 'my acts proceed from the person I am ', gives ' a quite precise sense' to ' my acts are determined '. It might be thought that what she means here is that it makes the meaning more precise not by substituting ' proceed from ' for ' are determined by ' but by saying what they proceed from or are determined by, viz., by ' the person I am'. But ' This act proceeded from the person he is' is, so far as I know, not a phrase used in English, though it is not unlike one used, viz., ' This act proceeded from the sort of person</page><page sequence="16">376 CRITICAL NOTICES: he is' which would be the same as 'This act proceeded from his character'. We might well say, e.g., 'it proceeded from his dissolute character '. Thus perhaps we may take her to be saying here that a person's acts are determined by his dispositions (to adopt Prof. Broad's expression-" dispositions of the agent " (236.4)), and later (249.8) to be saying that that they are free means that they are so determined. This is suggested by the following sort of case: Suppose a person does something very far from his nature: e.g., a kind, gentle person (Jones) who has always been affectionate to his child suddenly murders the child; we say, ' It was not Jones who did it: that is not the sort of person he is; some brainstorm must have seized him'. Whereas if Bloggs, a dissolute lout, does this, we may say, 'That's just the sort of thing he would do: he deserves all he gets'. But Prof. Stebbing's formula, though suggested by such cases, is far from covering all; for if we then find that Bloggs became dissolute and a lout through a hereditarv disease of the brain-cells, we should be wrong to say it was his act, even though it proceeded from what he had become and was becoming. We might try to save the formula by adding, 'An act is a man's own when it proceeds from his nature, and he had the power to have either that or a different nature '. If now we try to say that we mean by ' he had the power to have a different nature ' that ' his having the nature he has proceeded from his having had that nature', our difficulty recurs. In general, of some acts which proceed from a person's nature we say, ' He had power to do this or refrain ' (e.g., we often say this of a generously disposed person's acts of generosity); while of others which proceed from his nature we say, 'He had no power to do other- wise '. There follows a chapter in which a critical account is given of Eddington's view that our mind keeps ' its record of the flight of time' by 'the reading of some kind of a clock in the material of the brain ', viz., the increasing randomness of the distribution of its ultimate physical elements. Prof. Stebbing shortly and effectively counters the general suggestion that increased disorganisation of the ultimate physical elements in the universe is ' the signpost' by which the mind is guided in 'selecting its direction in time' from earlier to later. She remarks: ' If increase of entropy is the criterion of the distinction of earlier from later, how was it discovered that entropy increases as time goes on ? (262.8). . . . These entropy-clocks measure " the rate of disorganisation of energy ", and Eddington has dis- tinguished between the increase of energy and the passage of time' (263.3). G. A.
