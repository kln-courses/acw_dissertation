<plain_text><page sequence="1">Articles What's to Be Done With the Fox? Inuit Teachers Inventing Musical Games for Inuit Classrooms JOAN RUSSELL McGill University Montreal, PQ, Canada ABSTRACT This paper explores the issue of culturally responsive music curriculum content in the context of a music course that I taught on three occasions for Nunavut Arctic College's Teacher Education Program (NTEP). The 19 Inuit students who attended the course were working toward achieving certification for teaching in Nunavut schools. One of the assign- ments asked the student teachers to invent and peer teach a musical activity that adapted some of the concepts, materials, and skills I brought to the course to something traditional to Inuit culture. Three questions emerged from this assignment: What themes would their musical activities address? What values and traditions would be embedded in these themes? How would these themes relate to the themes expressed in the wider culture-in Inuit-produced carvings, printmaking, weaving, legends, and poetry? A thematic analysis of the student-designed activities revealed a connection to the "land" in ways that we do not see in Eurocentric music curricula, and the chosen themes were consistent with those that are present in other Inuit cultural products. One student's assignment is presented as an example of a musical activity that positions the Inuit relationship with the land at the core of the activity, while drawing on ideas from both Inuit and qallunaat (non-Inuit) traditions. I conclude that Inuit-created musical activities that are derived from Inuit experience have a role to play in decolonizing the curriculum for Inuit students. INTRODUCTION "A-Hunting We Will Go" is a song from traditional Eurocentric repertoire, usually thought of as a children's song. It goes like this: A-hunting we will go; A-hunting we will go; We'll catch afox and put him in a box And then we'll let him go. ? 2006 by The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto.

The lyrics are culturally loaded, for they carry a message that a fox caught is a fox to be freed; they carry a myth of a culture that views wildlife through a sentimental lens. Elisapie, an Inuit student teacher in my class, initiated a conversation with me about the hunting song. She said, "We wouldn't say that. We'd say, 'And then we'll eat him!'"" Elisapie's comment, reflecting a view of the fox through an Inuit lens, was a flash of insight that led me to grasp one of the fundamental differences between her culture and mine, and how that difference is expressed in the song lyrics and the actions of the musical games in the music curriculum that I know. It revealed to me in an instant that the values and traditions embedded in the lyrics I am familiar with, and the stories they tell about my society which invents and uses them, reflect the values and traditions of my culture, but not necessar- ily hers. It led me to think about the ethical and political issues that inform curriculum decisions, and about the ways in which these issues are coming to the fore in the discourse on decolonization in education in many parts of the world (Addo, 2001; Addo, Miya, &amp; Potgieter, 2003; Battiste, 2004; Dzansi, 2002; Flolu, 1998, 2000; Kanonhsionni/Hill &amp; Stairs, 2002; McConaghy, 2002; Ng'andu &amp; Herbst, 2004; Orr, San Salom/Paul, &amp; Kelusilew/Paul, 2002; Ross, 2004; Tuhiwai-Smith, 1999). Elisapie stimulated my thinking about my role and responsibility as a qallunaat educator working in the Canadian North with Inuit student teach- ers who are destined to assume responsibility for educational leadership in their communities. Elisapie's comment, made en passant, served as an inspiration for this paper, which explores the issue of culturally relevant music curriculum and the tensions between tradition and change in the context of Nunavut. First I establish some contextual background-historical, geographical, cultural-that framed my Nunavut experience and helped to awaken me to the cultural and political implications involved in choosing and developing curriculum materials. Next I offer a conceptual framework for interpreting musical activities-songs, chants, and rhythmic games-as the stories of a culture. Following this I explain the context in which 19 student teachers invented musical activities, and I present the results of my analysis of their creations in terms of themes addressed and where these creations are located on a continuum of preservation of tradition on one end and development on the other. In the concluding section I revisit the notion of music curriculum choice as a sociopolitical cultural act, and I discuss the importance of thinking about what is to be done with the fox. I suggest that Inuit teachers' invented musical activities that fuse qallunaat and Inuit traditions have a place in an Inuit-inspired emergent music curriculum in the North because it accommodates both preservation and development (Russell, 2006) in a climate of decolonization. To comply with McGill University's ethical guidelines I use pseudonyms for individuals and I do not mention the actual names of the communities or the schools.2</page><page sequence="3">WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH THE FOX? 17 CONTEXTUAL BACKGROUND Nunavut was established as a geopolitical territory in the Canadian Arctic in 1999. Its parliament is located in the capital city of Iqaluit. The Inuit population of approximately 27,000 is scattered in small settlements over a territory of about 2 million square hectares. These settlements are isolated from one another, and from the rest of Canada, by great distances. Air is a common mode of travel between settlements, and people there refer to their air travel plans much in the way that we in the south refer to taking a bus or the subway, but always with the understanding that travel plans are subject to sudden inclement weather, and the possibility that one will have to charter a private plane to reach one's destination. The northern climate has, in the past, allowed only the hardiest and most skillful to survive, and the recollection of starvation resides in the memories of people over a certain age, and, through personal narratives and popular legend, in the collective memory as well. There are two languages (Inuktitut and Innuinaktuun), many dialects, and two different writing systems. Inuktitut uses both syllabics and Roman orthography, while Innuinaktuun uses Roman orthography. Many elders, who are the repositories of wisdom and cultural knowledge (Inuit IQ), do not speak English. In barely one generation much of the population moved from a nomadic lifestyle, relying on hunting and fishing for survival, to life in settlements. Many men and women now in their 40s and 50s who live in permanent homes lived, as youngsters, in tents and snow houses (iglus), and moved from place to place, following the food supply. While most of the children in Nunavut schools are Inuit, most of the certified teachers and administrators, especially at the secondary level, are qallunaat, who have little or no knowledge of Inuit languages or dialects. Qallunaat teachers receive little or no formal preparation for the social and cultural realities of teaching in Nunavut. Many stay for a short period then leave for a variety of personal and social reasons, such as unmet expecta- tions and social isolation (Tompkins, 1998).' Children from K-3 receive instruction in Inuktitut with some texts hastily adapted, or created, to suit their cultural needs. The curriculum in English begins in grade four, but unless children are in homes where English is spoken, there is little oppor- tunity or reason to use it outside of the classroom.4 Mainstream Canadian values have been imposed on the Inuit, especially in the pre-1970s era of the notorious residential schools, when, with gov- ernment complicity, church- and state-run schools attempted to erase cul- tural knowledge (language, beliefs, food, dress, social practices) from the Inuit children in their care (e.g., Freeman, 1988; French, 1988; Petrone, 1988). During this time whole communities existed that had no teenagers in their midst for the duration of the school year, and teenagers in resi- dential schools spent much of their formative years without their families around them. This policy has had disastrous, long-term social effects-low</page><page sequence="4">18 JOAN RUSSELL school retention rates and high suicide rates-that continue to pose chal- lenges in Nunavut schools (Maguire &amp; McAlpine, 1996; Tompkins, 1998; Wolforth, 1991). Memories of schooling as an act of colonization and consequent sup- pression of culture are still fresh in the minds of many older people and have affected their attitudes toward schooling. For instance, some of those who experienced residential schools do not necessarily take seriously the schools' claim that it is important for their grandchildren to attend classes regularly or to be punctual. They do not necessarily see the point in putting children to bed at a prescribed hour, especially in the spring when it is light 24 hours per day. In the long days of May and June it is not uncommon to see young children playing outside at 11 p.m. The Nunavut Teacher Education Program (NTEP), developed by McGill University in the 1980s and now offered in several Nunavut loca- tions, aims to prepare Inuit men and women5 for certification (awarded by the Ministere d'Education du Qu6bec [MEQ]) to teach in Nunavut schools. However, for a variety of social and demographic reasons' there continues to be a shortage of certified Inuit teachers. Concurrent with the plan to staff Nunavut schools with Inuit teachers is the production of culturally appropriate curriculum content, with curriculum designers attempting to identify objectives and provide materials and plans that both respond to Inuit needs and satisfy Canadian educational standards (Tomp- kins, 1998).7 This is a challenge not easily met, for definitions of what is deemed to be culturally responsive may vary according to who is making the decisions, and it is unrealistic to expect that the types of academic goals and achievements that are meaningful, for instance, in a middle-class sub- urban school in Toronto, Edmonton, or Montreal will be meaningful in an Inuit school in Nunavut. Philosophical arguments about what is worth learning in mainstream Canadian music classes are ongoing, with some arguing that students are more engaged when their encounters with music are more closely aligned with the music they know and like, and others argue that the function of music education should be to lead students into experiences of music with which they are unfamiliar and are unlikely to encounter once they leave school. Others argue that composition or jazz improvisation or mastery of the rules of 19th-century music offer the best paths to musicianship. Any number of reasons are presented to support all arguments, as each group tries to persuade the others of the rightness of their positions. In the absence of a mandated music curriculum, teachers' positions on this con- tinuum may be discerned from examining their concert programs, the types of materials they use in their classrooms, their stated goals, and the goals they actually pursue and achieve. Whatever the validity of these schools of thought, curriculum decisions are especially critical in situations where whole groups of people have suffered loss of identity due to coloni- zation and suppression of culture.8 In such cases it is essential to provide</page><page sequence="5">WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH THE FOX? 19 students in such communities with experiences that reflect the values and traditions and histories of their cultures (Ashton-Warner, 1986; Battiste, 2004; Dei, 1996; Flolu, 1998, 2000; Tuhiwai-Smith, 1999).9' MYTHS, SONGS, AND MUSICAL GAMES: TELL OUR STORIES According to Brody (2000), myths denote, in European culture, a story that is not true but contains truths about the human condition. In indigenous culture, Brody asserts, myths are accounts of real events and processes. Bringhurst (1999) explains that the power of myth is that it is a recurring story, a "piece of timelessness caught like an eddy in narrative time. Once the story is known, a single image or even a single word can evoke it. But only a linked sequence of images, words or gestures can tell it" (p. 47). A genuine mythology, Bringhurst continues, is "a kind of science in narrative form" (p. 288). Applebee (1978) views stories as "an important agent of socialization, one of many modes through which the young are taught the values and standards of their elders" (p. 53). Stories rich in images capture and engage the collective imagination, expressing metaphorically the col- lective's history and revealing truths upon which a society upholds its ways of living. Hence, the importance of myth in curriculum;just as middle-class, mainstream myths, where the fox is released, are deemed suitable for middle-class curricula, so are Inuit myths suitable for Inuit curricula. Inuit culture is rich is in myths, and therefore, in a culturally responsive curricu- lum one would expect to find this richness at the core. Songs and musical games are culturally defined terms. For the purposes of this paper I am calling a song any musical activity that includes any or all of the following: repeated patterns of pitch, rhythm, expressive movement, and lyrics.'o Songs and musical games may be conceptualized as musical stories, in the sense that they embody and transmit the myths and values of a collectivity (Ng'andu &amp; Herbst, 2004). Moreover, they do so through a rich variety of genres." Musical stories serve as an agent of socialization; so it is important to examine the content, production, and purpose of musical stories in the development of a meaningful curriculum in music. Although in practice we experience through performance and listening the musical stories of other cultures, they are nevertheless culture specific, and we do not always understand the underlying purpose and value of the musics we experience. Ethnographic studies of children's songs and singing games, and studies of ritual chants and other musical practices, have demonstrated (Addo, 2001; Blacking, 1995; Campbell, 1996, 2002; Dzansi, 2002; Mans, 2000; Russell, 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003) their reciprocal relationship with the culture and values of their communities. Children internalize the values and traditions of their cultures when they engage in singing and singing games. If a split occurs between what children experi- ence in school and what they experience in their community, a dissonance</page><page sequence="6">20 JOAN RUSSELL may result, and students may find it difficult to relate what they learn in school to those things that are more meaningful to them. They may fail to be engaged. Indeed, Dzansi found that Ghanaian children, experiencing only the Western concepts and aesthetics in their Eurocentric Ghanaian formal music classes in school-a legacy of the colonization period- described music as the "most useless subject in the school curriculum." Research suggests that students are likely to find school a more meaningful experience if they are not alienated from their own cultural values (Cummins, 1986; Foster 2002; Heath, 1983; Ogbu, 2002). Songs and musical games, then, are culture-specific in their purpose, value, and contexts of use and production. Carrying the stories, myths, and traditions of the culture that produces them, they reflect a culture's values and ways of being in the world (Applebee, 1978; Ladson-Billings, 1994), and they teach a way of life (Gaiwayene/Thomas, 2002, p. 441). These are some of thoughts that accompanied my journeys to the North. ISSUES ARISING FROM THE TEACHING EXPERIENCE In Nunavut, courses in music that are offered within the framework of the Nunavut Teacher Education Program (NTEP) challenge qallunaat instruc- tors to teach in ways that are culturally responsive in terms both of materials and pedagogy. I faced this challenge three times during 2002-2003. The course I taught-Music, Movement &amp; Communication-takes a kinesthetic approach to the experience of music. The idea is that music is expressed and perceived through body movements. Course activities are interactive and collaborative. I was conscious that the materials and ways of teaching that I brought to the North were culturally loaded, and I knew I would have to adapt my pedagogical style and materials according to the situations I encountered. I was also anxious to learn what my students would consider culturally responsive material. What might an Inuit-designed music curricu- lum consist of that captured the collective imagination in the ways of which Applebee, Bringhurst, and Brody speak? Would it be culturally insensitive to introduce songs and games involving horses, for instance, when there are no horses in Nunavut? About trees, when there are no trees in Nunavut? About riding on buses,'2 when the main means of transportation in Nunavut is ATV, snowmobile, and airplane? What would these student teachers find enjoyable and worth knowing? These are some of the ques- tions I posed to myself as I assembled my course materials. I hoped that some answers would emerge in my interactions with the student teachers. I expected that I would learn from them far more than they would learn from me. This paper builds on the assumption that songs are musical stories that are imbued with values and traditions, and thus carry the myths of a culture. Focus is on the cultural content in the musical stories invented by the Inuit student teachers in my classes.</page><page sequence="7">WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH THE FOX? 21 Three questions evolved from my 9 weeks of working with Inuit student teachers in Nunavut, questions that I think are important for any qallunaat music teacher who plans to teach in Nunavut: What would the student teachers produce if asked to design an activity that incorporated some of the concepts, moves, games, and skills that I brought to the course with something traditional from their culture? What themes would be reflected in their choices of lyrics and actions-their created musical "stories." And, what would be the connection with the myths and stories of Inuit culture that are expressed so powerfully in Inuit sculpture, printmaking, tapestry, legends, narratives, and poetry? METHODOLOGY Embedded case study (Yin, 1984) and an ethnographic posture (Wolcott, 1992) offered a suitable conceptual-methodological framework for this inquiry. Methodological tools included participant observation, purposeful conversation, and document analysis. Sources of Reflection, Information, Insight Sources of information and insight were rich and varied. It is easy to talk to people in the North. Most conversations occurred informally, around class- room breaks, at mealtimes, at social outings, and at community celebra- tions. I spoke to students, hotel staff, supermarket workers, people I met casually while going for walks, professionals on short-term visits (1 to 3 days) from the South, teachers and school administrators, and community workers.13 I conversed with Inuit men and women, long-term qallunaat residents, and short-term qallunaat contract workers. Sarah, a well-traveled, multilingual Inuit woman who was working on a contract in several Nunavut communities, was a delightful companion and a willing resource. During our nightly dinners together in a public dining room, Sarah explained social behaviors and their basis in family relation- ships, and provided explanations for social phenomena I had observed during the day. She explained, for instance, that a younger student would not contradict an older student or offer an opinion in front of an older student, especially if the two were related.'4 She provided insights into life in the North, answering questions that I had not thought to ask, such as the practices around the naming of children and adoption. Other resources that helped me to construct context and interpret events and behaviors were provided by songbooks and song sheets in Inuktitut that I found among stacks of music materials in my music room at McGill and in a school in one of the communities. While in Nunavut I took</page><page sequence="8">22 JOAN RUSSELL every opportunity to read local newspapers, particularly the weekly news- paper Nunatsiaq News, and notices on bulletin boards. I looked at the local television stations, which posted community notices, advertisements of goods and services, and which carried limited, live broadcasts of cultural activities.'5 I listened, observed, questioned, danced, played, and conversed with people in the three communities. I recorded social events, such as community celebrations like Umingmak Frolics (a 3-day springtime cel- ebration in May featuring a parade and snowmobile races on 8-foot-thick sea ice), with photographs and videotape. In field notes, which I wrote during the long summer evenings and on weekends, and in emails and letters to friends and family, I described the events and experiences in as much detail as I could recall. This written data allowed for reflection, speculation, the generation of questions, and the recording of anecdotes, and served as an invaluable source of information in the preparation of this paper. Additional contextual background was provided by a film on Cape Dorset artists (Houston, 1999), books on Inuit art and artists (Leroux, Jackson, &amp; Freeman, 1994; Von Fickenstein, 1999, 2002), and narratives in qallunaat and Inuit voices about life in the North in the distant and the more recent past (Beaudry, 1988; Boas, 1998; Brody, 2000; Lopez, 1986; Morrison &amp; Germain, 1995; Pelly, 1999, 2001; Petrone, 1988; Thorpe, Hakongak, Eyegetok, &amp; the Kitikmeot elders, 2001). I videotaped Tagaq ("Tagaq," 2002, 2003), an Inuit throat singer who explained, demon- strated, and taught throat singing technique and songs to my students in Nunavut and in Montreal. Tagaq provided information about the skill involved and the cultural significance of this traditional activity.'" These resources helped to shape an interpretive frame for my experiences. These resources revealed connections between the musical stories that the student teachers created and the community's myths and stories. Teaching Context I worked with three small classes of Inuit student teachers: with four women in the central Arctic, seven women and one man in the eastern Arctic, and seven women in the southeastern Arctic. Courses were offered in May and July 2002 and June 2003, after the end of the regular college year. All 19 students completed the course. I adapted the materials and pedagogies to the needs of each specific teaching situation, which differed in terms of location, physical resources, size of class, backgrounds, and social contexts of the students."7 The courses were intensive with classes meeting from Monday to Friday, 9 a.m.-3 p.m., with breaks for coffee and lunch. In the morning we explored, experimented, and played with musical concepts, games, songs, movement, and skills. Students brought to the class traditional Inuit</page><page sequence="9">WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH THE FOX? 23 musical games (usually rhythmic, chanting, movement games) to share with one another. The student teachers were familiar with a variety of traditional Inuit musical genres: string games, circle games, and juggling games accompanied by songs; "drum dancing" (community-specific); and throat singing. In many cases, their acquaintance with cultural activities from their own childhood was renewed. This traditional material would be a resource for teaching. They were also familiar with mainstream Eurocen- tric genres, such as hymns and Sunday-school songs in English and Inuktitut (and Innuinaktuun), contemporary "hip-hop" songs, traditional qallunaat folk songs, popular songs, and children's songs. The students enjoyed listening to popular songs adapted stylistically from mainstream songs-especially the genre of country &amp; western-performed in Inuktitut by Inuit artists singing about northern themes. Songs in Inuktitut are broadcast on the Nunavut radio station across the territory, and local artists travel around the territory, performing at community celebrations and renewing connections with family and acquaintances. CDs of this style of music are available for purchase in some communities and on the Internet. Inventing and Sharing Culturally Responsive Musical Stories Afternoons were devoted to working on assignments in the classroom, using college resources such as the Internet, word processing, paper sup- plies, and the photocopy machine. I was available for consultation and support as needed. One major assignment asked the students to design a musical activity that would be culturally appropriate for an Inuit elementary classroom and write it up as a plan of action complete with instructions, purposes, words (if applicable), and descriptions of movements (as neces- sary). After teaching the prepared activity to their peers, they discussed their responses to the experience. Nineteen written assignments resulted from this particular course activity. For the thematic analysis I noted the author, location, and date of the course and the theme addressed in the lyrics or the actions. The themes of the activities were revealed either in the title (e.g., "Going Camping") or in the lyrics (e.g., "I'm eating a seal") or in the description of the accompa- nying movements (e.g., point the rifle). All assignments were submitted in English and Inuktitut or Innuinaktuun. I kept copies of all assignments, which is consistent with my practice at McGill, namely that all lesson plans are distributed among fellow students (and their instructor). These assign- ments became part of the students' repertoire of teaching resources, the accumulation of which was a major assignment. Prominent were themes that referred to the land: ten lessons were specifically narratives of being on "the land"; four lessons referred to wild animals but did not specifically mention being on the land; five lessons had no specific reference to being on the land, but of these five, two focused on</page><page sequence="10">24 JOAN RUSSELL throat singing, a skill-based activity in which two women, facing one another, reproduce in strict rhythmic imitation sounds that are heard "on the land," such as the cries of gulls, rushing water, or the rhythmic sounds of a dog team running on snow. I then examined the stories that were embedded in these themes, and I sought to uncover the values that these stories embodied. My understanding of Inuit values, if I had only the students' musical stories as a source of insight, would be that the close relationship with the land is a central Inuit myth. In terms of tradition versus development, the students' responses to the assignment varied. Some activities were conservationist (directly replicating Inuit practices such as a lesson in throat singing), some borrowed heavily on qallunaat traditions ("Where Is Thumbkin?"/"Where Is Tuktu?" where the names of animals are substituted for finger names), and some were more adventurous, fusing Inuit and qallunaat traditions to create a hybrid genre of musical story. Four fell into this last category. Annesie's "A Polar Bear Hunt" is a good example of a culturally responsive, innovative, more adventurous response. Her musical story adapts a qallunaat traditional song, incorporates movements of the type that we explored during the course, and is situated in Inuit experience. "A POLAR BEAR HUNT" I chose to present this one here because it was typical of what I am calling a hybrid genre-fusing Inuit and qallunaat traditions to create a musical story. Using the tune of London Bridge Is FallingDown, Annesie invented new lyrics, which sing each of 11 stages of the hunt. Lyrics are sung in Inuktitut. At each stage of the hunt the hunters express movements, which they are free to improvise, that correspond to the lyrics of the verse they are singing. This is how the game is played: Participants are divided into two groups: the polar bears and the hunters. Each verse relates a stage of the hunt: 1) getting up in the morning, 2) getting dressed, 3) packing the gear, 4) driving the ski-doo, 5) looking for polar bears, 6) sighting some polar bears, 7) loading the rifle, 8) shooting at the bears and missing them, 9) being chased by the bears, finally 10) taking aim and killing the bears, and 11) dancing to celebrate the success of the hunt. Then the students change roles and the hunters became the hunted. The polar bear "hunt" was done with great hilarity, especially when the polar bears charged the hunters who fled with alacrity and nimbleness, clambering over desks and chairs, and even running out of the room to escape. The excitement in the room was palpable; the actions were intense, giving the game a dynamism and tension that their own hunting experiences no doubt made possible. When the polar bears chased the "hunters," there was no doubt in my mind, as a viewer, that their lives were in virtual danger.</page><page sequence="11">WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH THE FOX? 25 DISCUSSION The land is present in all of the schools I visited. Carvings, knives, and baskets are displayed in glass cabinets; and furs, skins, and sealskin kamiks and other traditional garments are mounted on the walls. A traditional sealskin qayaq sits by the entrance. On the wall of a library an entire musk ox hide looks down on the students from its place of honor. The polar bear is no stranger to the Inuit. It is neither a mythical nor a cartoon character; it is real, and it is present. It is highly respected for its strength, speed, and agility and for its potential to kill humans; it is also respected for its potential economic benefit. Some women earn extra money by preparing polar bear skins for sale to qallunaat visitors. Inuit guides earn money by taking qallunaat visitors out on the land to hunt and photograph polar bears. At certain times of the year teachers must check the school grounds for the presence of polar bears. In the lobby of Annesie's children's school stands a polar bear about 8 feet tall and weighing 400-500 kg. Thus, the polar bear hunt was a logical choice as a theme in Annesie's musical story. Inuit children who are provided with opportunities to sing and act out stories grounded in real events and processes-Brody's (2000) myths- have opportunities to internalize fundamental values in Inuit culture, values that they encounter in the rich array of other Inuit cultural products, such as stone carvings (Von Fickenstein, 1999, 2002), drawings and tapes- tries (Leroux, Jackson, &amp; Freeman, 1994), legends (Pelly, 2001; Pelly &amp; Crockatt, 1999; Petrone, 1988), and the narratives of their parents' and grandparents' lived lives. One of the student teachers affirmed this value when she said to the class, "We are part of the people who are going to keep our culture alive." For Inuit children, to portray wild animals in song and story in a senti- mental way could be puzzling at best, and alienating at worst. Songs and games that view animals through an anthropomorphic lens present an unrealistic, irrelevant, and falsely sentimental portrait of the relationship of humans to animals. If the Disney view of wildlife should prevail among Inuit children, it could create serious, perhaps irreparable, cultural conflict within their families. If at least a portion of Inuit children's songs and musical stories portray wildlife in terms of the hunt, the music curriculum will have helped to achieve coherence between the values and traditions of the their homes, their community, and their school. WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH THE FOX? So, what's to be done with the fox? I began this paper by recounting a conversation with Elisapie. She pointed out that Inuit would not sing "And then we'll let him go!" but would sing instead "And then we'll eat him!"- lyrics that would make more sense to an Inuit child. The fox may be</page><page sequence="12">26 JOAN RUSSELL viewed as a metaphor for a way of life, a way of being in the world. To a mainstream qallunaat child, the words and then we'll let him go! reflect a sentimental, now "politically correct," view of wildlife; to the Inuit and then we'll eat him represents physical survival and psychic well-being. Brody (2000) and others observe that hunting, trapping, and fishing is where Inuit live "most fully as themselves" (p. 31). This relationship with the land is what the students expressed in their invented musical stories, whether they took a conservationist or more adventurous approach. Stories and games that express the Inuit experience of the land have an important role to play in an Inuit school curriculum. Annesie's musical story reflects the continuing meaningfulness of the hunt in Inuit culture. Her creation bears some similarities to the traditional Inuit song stories, the pisiq, and the ayaya. TRADITIONAL INUIT STORY SONGS The genre of traditional pisiq or ayaya, combining movement, chanting or singing, and drumming is a musical story genre that is well known in Nunavut. However, as Joyce (2005) points out, these songs are highly personal, and are generally regarded as private intellectual and cultural property belonging solely to the creator of the song. Passing the song on to others is the prerogative of the creator. Thus, these songs are rarely heard outside of one's one community, and certainly not taught as part of the community's or territory's cultural capital. This poses a problem for teachers of the form in that it is difficult to find songs that are public domain and teachable in a classroom setting. (p. 2) Annesie's and the other students' invented musical stories have a public quality; they can be modeled, taught, experienced in a classroom or other social gathering places, and transformed by anyone who wishes to do so. The genre of the musical story, derived in educational settings, has there- fore the potential for development. The student teachers in my classes in the NTEP program created activities that contain the seeds of an Inuit- centred genre that fuses aspects of Inuit and European musical experience. These activities were educative in the sense that students were invited to identify what is meaningful in Inuit culture and to express that meaning through experimentation with new forms and ideas. With a little more development of the choreography, and perhaps the addition of some instruments such as a drum or bone rattles, Annesie's "Polar Bear Hunt" could continue to evolve into an art form that situates Inuit experience at the center of the curriculum, satisfies Canadian education standards, and brings a land-based, sophisticated art form to the world.</page><page sequence="13">WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH THE FOX? 27 WORKING IN THE ZONE BETWEEN PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT Official curricula represent institutional ideologies (Dei, 1996), and where there is a dominant culture, materials and pedagogical styles are likely to serve one group's ideology at the expense of another's. The decolonization movement in education that is taking place in different parts of the world understands curriculum development as a political activity, in the sense that it strives to place the accumulated wisdom, interests, values, aspira- tions, learning styles, and traditions of a particular group of people at the center of the curriculum. IQ-Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit-is traditional Inuit knowledge. The principles of IQ as it relates to education are articulated in the Bathurst Mandate (1999)18 as follows: "Land and language skills and respectful pride in our cultures and languages are fundamental for adults and children. Our education system needs to be built within the context of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit." Inuit children live in a world that is different from that of their ancestors. The Bathurst Mandate recognizes this, projecting that in 2020, Nunavut will be in a place where the "population is adaptable to change and wel- comes new skills, while preserving its culture, values and language of origin." Negotiating the tensions between traditional life and modern reali- ties is a challenge for Inuit educators; it is also the responsibility of qallunaat educators in the North to be conscious of this process. Music is a useful tool for engaging past and present. In the past Inuit have used music to help people remember stories and moral lessons and to transmit and reinforce the nuances of language, spirituality, culture, science, and technology that comprise IQ (Joyce, 2005). Music educators who work in Nunavut and who explore these tensions with Inuit students are engaged in political work, bridging a colonial past and a decolonial present.19 As one reviewer for this paper reminded me, curriculum work is political work, and in the North, decolonizing the curriculum, which is what this paper addresses, involves helping Inuit teachers to move Inuit experience to a more central place in Inuit schools. New and hybridized genres in music come about from the fusion of aspects drawn from different musical traditions. Whereas reproduction of traditional genres and practices ensures survival of traditions, appropria- tion and adaptation of styles and practices across porous cultural borders leads to transformation (Bresler, 2003; Russell, 2006) and new forms. The crossing of cultural borders is more and more a feature of life as the advances of the 21st century reach into the lives of people around the globe. The rich repertoire of traditional Inuit songs and singing games is transmitted from elders to youth. Inuit singers have also adopted stylistic features of Western-style popular genres, fusing Western-style melodic and harmonic structures and forms with Inuktitut lyrics and themes. Music curriculum materials prepared for use in Inuit elementary schools contain</page><page sequence="14">28 JOAN RUSSELL translated Eurocentric songs, with lyrics presented in syllabics and accom- panying drawings of northern images. These lyrics are altered to reflect Inuit experiences. For instance, "Baa, Baa, Black Sheep" becomes a song about a seal. "Where Is Thumbkin?" becomes "Where Is Tuuktu?" Because Inuktitut has different rhythmic patterns from English, translations do not always work well, musically. Moreover, these materials retain their essential qallunaat characteristics, purposes, and sentiments. The musical story genre that builds on the hunt or other important activities and incorporates choreography (a sequence of movements and their placement within space), chanting or singing, and drumming can be considered a hybrid genre because it draws for inspiration on Inuit realities and incorporates both Inuit and qallunaat traditions. "Learning begins with the land" (Kanonhsionni/Hill &amp; Stairs, 2002, p. 282) is a recurring theme in much writing on indigenous education.20 For Inuit children, the stories that allow them to express real land-based expe- riences through words and movement resonate with the truths of their home and community experience. Inuit-designed musical stories that express these truths can make important contributions to the development of a culturally appropriate music curriculum for Nunavut schools-a music curriculum in which the polar bear is eventually killed and the fox doesn't get away. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I am grateful to Liora Bresler and to the six anonymous reviewers for their careful readings of this paper and their many helpful suggestions for its improvement. I am especially grateful toJoanne Tompkins for pointing out to me the importance of interpreting my work in the North as political work. NOTES 1. Another student teacher was quick to point out that Inuit do not, in fact, eat fox-at least, not to her knowledge. But eating is not the issue; fox fur is a valuable commodity for use, trade, and sale, and it would be foolish for an Inuit hunter to let the fox go. 2. The practice of assigning pseudonyms presents a thorny ethical issue, as some of my students insisted that they wanted me to use their names and the names of their communities for the publicity that might accrue to their community. For a discussion about the conventions, derived from the biomedical model, surrounding disclosure of participants in scholarly research, see J. Corbin &amp; J.M. Morse (2003), The unstructured interactive interview: Issues of reciprocity and risks when dealing with sensitive topics. Qualitative Inquiry, 9(3), 335-354.</page><page sequence="15">WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH THE FOX? 29 3. I learned this also from a graduate student who had taught in the North and whose research included inquiring into the experiences of qallunaat teachers in Nunavut schools. 4. Although it is the case that, as one reviewer reminded me, Inuit communities have access to the very powerful influences of English-language popular culture via electronic means, my impression is that the use of English outside class- rooms varies according to the size and location of the various communities. Except for one class, where the students did not have a common mother tongue, I found that the students spoke to each other in Inuktitut, only revert- ing to English when speaking to me. The levels of English mastery among the student teachers varied greatly. I am not aware of any statistics on the frequency or contexts of the use(s) of English outside Inuit classrooms. 5. Teaching is, apparently, still seen as a profession for women. Most of the graduates of the NTEP program are women, and of the 19 students in my three classes, only 1 was a man. 6. I have observed or been informed of a number of obstacles to completing the Nunavut Teacher Education Program. Studying to become a teacher requires long periods of absence from students' home communities, and Inuit students do not do well when separated from their tightly knit communities. Whole families relocate so that mother (or father) can study in a distant community where the program is offered but a shortage of housing creates conditions of overcrowding. Lack of moral support from some family members who do not see the value of the long-term commitment to the professional program can undermine a student teacher's resolve. 7. For example, Through Mala's eyes: Life in an Inuit community (2003), published by the Ministry of Indian Affairs and Northern Development for the use of teach- ers in Inuit classrooms, focuses on life in Nunavut. However it is organized in a distinctly qallunaat style (lesson objectives, materials required, sequencing of teaching steps, etc.) and is not respectful of indigenous ways of teaching and learning (Kanonhsionni/Hill &amp; Stairs, 2002). I do not claim to have developed a pedagogical style that is respectful of indigenous ways of teaching, only to be conscious that I have much to learn. 8. An Inuit woman told me that the traditional Inuit practice of throat singing was forbidden by missionaries on the ground that it was orgiastic. 9. I have noted elsewhere (Russell, 1997, 2001, 2002) that Fijian children know a range of musical styles and genres, from Methodist hymns and Anglo-American folk songs (translated into Fijian) to knowledge of traditional Fijian meke, each genre having its place in the appropriate social context. 10. In an essay review (Russell, 2004) I explained that translating words such as singing and song from Inuktitut into English is fraught with difficulty, for the words are conceptual; their meanings are culture specific. And so, for cross- cultural discourse, definitions are important. Music and musicianship are also contested terms, for their meanings vary according to who is using them. To simplify matters here, I use song, singing, music, musical stories to refer to any Inuit or qallunaat practice that involves rhythmic activity.</page><page sequence="16">30 JOAN RUSSELL 11. Some examples of Anglo-American genres: nonsense ("Mairzy Doats"), tall tale ("I Was Born About Ten Thousand Years Ago"), social commentary ("Which Side Are You On?"), social protest ('Jim Crow"), historical narrative ("Un- Canadien Errant"), lament ("St. Louis Blues"), ballad ("Ballad of the Boll Weevil"), hymns ("In the Sweet By and By"), and so forth. 12. For example, "The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round" is a song that is known to most qallunaat children. 13. One feature of life in small, isolated communities is that one's social exchanges can include persons across a range of ages, professions, and socioeconomic statuses. This provides opportunities to learn about a community from a rich variety of perspectives. 14. This cultural knowledge helped me to understand why Lucy never spoke up in class: her mother was also her classmate. 15. One example of a television broadcast of a cultural activity was a traditional game played with animal bones by two local men, presented without commentary. 16. From Tagaq I also learned that she is subject to criticism by some of the more traditional members of her community because she also pushes the boundaries of throat singing, using it as an expressive, artistic, and very personal art form. 17. What I wish to convey here is that although all of the students were Inuit and have some common history and share a basic cultural experience and way of life, I learned that I could not assume that an approach that worked well with one group would necessarily work with another. 18.
