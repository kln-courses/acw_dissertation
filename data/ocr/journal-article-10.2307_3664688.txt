<plain_text><page sequence="1">Romantic Topography and the Dilemma of Empire: The Caucasus in the Dialogue of Georgian and Russian Poetry HARSHA RAM AND ZAZA SHATIRISHVILI Georgian romantic poetry is widely considered one of the earliest manifestations of Georgia's modem opening to the West, an indirect consequence of her annexation by and absorption into the Russian Empire. Georgia's own subsequent political fate represents a striking paradox. While arguably victims of a colonial expansion that they intermittently resisted, many members of the Georgian nobility also served their Russian overlords as officers and administrators, participating vigorously in Russia's prolonged military cam- paigns of the early and mid-nineteenth century against Georgia's northern neighbors, the mountain peoples of the Northern Caucasus. For this reason, in place of the familiar binary opposition of colonizer and colonized, one might speak of a "trichotomy" involving Russia, Georgia, and the Northern Caucasus. How did Georgian romanticism come to reflect this peculiar alignment of forces, that at times pitted the Georgian nobility against the Russian imperial state and on other occasions saw the same privileged.class serve willingly in Russia's wars against the North Caucasian highlanders? And how can this be textually related to the specifically aesthetic problem of how Georgian poetry took up and creatively reworked Russian literary models? It is clear from the historical record that many of Georgia's romantic poets conspired actively against Russian rule. Punished with varying degrees of severity for their involve- ment in such watershed events as the failed anti-Russian conspiracy of 1832, they were also eventually pardoned and reabsorbed with considerable success into the military and bureaucratic structure of empire. Such was the fate of the gentry poets Aleksandre Ch'avch'avadze (1786-1846) and Grigol Orbeliani (1804-83)--the former twice arrested and exiled from Georgia for subversive activities or suspected antigovernment sympathies but rising ultimately to the rank of lieutenant-general in the Russian army; the latter ac- tively participating over several decades in Russia's Caucasian wars and even serving periodically as the tsar's regent from 1859 to 1865, a career briefly interrupted by a short The Russian Review 63 (January 2004): 1-25 Copyright 2004 The Russian Review</page><page sequence="2">2 Harsha Ram and Zaza Shatirishvili period of exile to Poland and the Baltic states in the aftermath of the abortive plot of 1832. These tangled destinies, combining elements of resistance as well as cooptation and col- laboration, speak eloquently of the profound ambivalence with which Georgia's gentry viewed Russian domination, while the readiness of Russia's rulers to pardon its repeated transgressions suggests how essential the same class was to Russia as, in Donald Rayfield's words, a "bulwark in the conquest of the Caucasus."' What more, we might ask, do these poets' works tell us that their nonliterary careers do not amply demonstrate? Georgian romantic poets did ponder the fate of their nation as well as Georgia's relationship to its neighbors, and to this extent much of their verse can be readily consid- ered a document of their epoch. This article does not seek to provide an overview of the Georgian romantic tradition in its political dimension. Rather, we shall examine no more than three Georgian poems by two authors, Aleksandre Ch'avch'avadze, and his younger and greater contemporary Nik'oloz Baratashvili. Explicitly or indirectly, these poems address the Northern Caucasus as a pressing concern of the day, as well as the "trichoto- mous" relations they imply. They have been chosen not only for the theme they represent, but how they represent it. Each poem can be seen to offer a different solution, both literary and historical, to the geopolitical challenge posed by Georgia's northern neighbors. These solutions involve varying symbolic strategies of inclusion and exclusion, realignment and compensation, that provide a subtle gauge of how Georgian poetry, and with it some two generations of Georgian gentry writers, struggled to fashion a new language as well as new identities, personal and collective, in the face of shifting political pressures. Al- though the primary theme of these texts is the Caucasus mountains or their inhabitants, the poems below betray to varying degrees the wider context of their composition. This context can be termed imperial modernity, which in Georgia as elsewhere meant more than just the bureaucratic or military apparatus of the Russian state. Two of the three texts below also display a profound engagement with the rich and contradictory legacy of Rus- sian (and in one case even Polish) romantic poetry, a dialogue we shall explore by placing and discussing the Georgian works alongside their counterparts from the north. ALEKSANDRE CH'AVCH'AVADZE'S "K'AVK'AZIA" Known to students of Russian culture as father-in-law to Aleksandr Griboedov and gener- ous host to the many Russian and Polish travellers, dignitaries, and exiles who visited his home over several decades, Aleksandre Ch'avch'avadze is widely considered the father of Georgian romanticism. Son of Georgia's last ambassador to Russia, born and educated in St. Petersburg, and versed in Russian, French, German, Turkish, and Persian as well as his 'Donald Rayfield, The Literature of Georgia: A History (Oxford, 1994), 148. It is a commonplace of Soviet literary criticism that that the Georgian romantics-and indeed prerevolutionary Georgian intellectuals as a whole- were ambivalent in their attitude to Russia. Soviet-era critics rationalized this ambivalence by distinguishing between tsarist colonial policy, which the Georgians had justifiably resented, and the progressive Russian culture that Ch'avch'avadze and others admired and emulated. There is some truth to this view, but the distinction, in Soviet accounts, between the "Russia of Tsar Nicholas I" and the "Russia of Pushkin" remained simplistic and schematic. A locus classicus of this interpretation is Igor' Bogomolov, Aleksandr Chavchavadze i russkaia kul'tura (Tbilisi, 1964).</page><page sequence="3">Romantic Topography and the Dilemma of Empire 3 native Georgian, Ch'avch'avadze played a vital role in introducing Russian and European literary themes and forms into Georgian literature, without severing ties with the Persian tradition that had nourished Georgian verse in the past.2 The poem by Ch'avch'avadze that interests us here is "K'avk'azia" ("The Caucasus"). The poem was first published in 1852, six years after the author's death, and the date of its original composition, a fact of considerable importance to us, has not been definitively established. An examination of surviving manuscript copies in Ch'avch'avadze's own hand or written by his contemporaries does, however, allow us to assume that the poem was written between 1824 and 1832.3 Hailed as a "programmatic masterpiece" by I. G. Grishashvili, poet, historian, and editor of the first scholarly edition of Ch'avch'avadze's works,4 the poem is also a rich intertextual conglomerate, saturated with references to the Russian poetic tradition. While critics have commented in general terms on the intertextual nature of the poem and even named at random some of its possible sources (albeit omitting many of the most important ones), the precise textual basis of this Russo-Georgian poetic encounter, the literary tradition it assumes, and the cultural 2The standard critical accounts ofAleksandre Ch'avch'avadze are V. K'ot'et'ishvili, Kartuli lit'erat'uris ist'oria XX sauk'unidan dghevandlamde (Kutaisi, 1925), 70-95; I. Grishashvili, "A. Ch'avch'avadze (shesavali barati)," in A. Ch'avch'avadze: Tkhzulebebi (Tbilisi, 1940), 7-72; and K'. Abashidze, Et'iudebi XIXsauk'unis kartuli lit'erat'uris shesakheb (Tbilisi, 1970), 91-116. These works do not, however, shed much light on the poem we propose to analyze. Most stylistic analyses of Ch'avch'avadze's modernizing role in literature have focused on his translations from Russian and other European languages: cf. K. Dondua, "Pushkin v gruzinskoi literature," in Pushkin v mirovoi literature: Sbornik statei (Leningrad, 1926), 199-214; David Lashkaradze, Problema evropeizma v gruzinskoi literature (Tbilisi, 1987), 136-50; and two works by Igor' Bogomolov, Aleksandr Chavchavadze i russkaia kul'tura, 47-71, and "A. S. Pushkin i gruzinskie romantiki," in Spaiany druzhboi (Tbilisi, 1987), 20-77. 3There are several extant manuscripts: first, the manuscript in the author's own hand (Manuscript No. S N2481-a, located in the K'. K'ek'elidze Manuscript Institute), a copy in the hand of Piladelpos K'ik'nadze (Manuscript No. N1811-26[2], Central State Archives of Georgia), and the Avalashvili copies (Nos. H - N1103[9], S-N4907, Q- N318[7], K'. K'ek'elidze Manuscript Institute). In his edition of 1940, I. Grishashvili claimed to be publishing the poem on the basis of the author's manuscript (Tkhzulebebi, 295). In fact, Grishashvili's published version (p. 77) contains several discrepancies: for example, it spells the title "K'avk'asia," whereas the manuscript clearly has "K'avk'azia." It is probable that this and like mistakes were made during the process of comparing the author's original manuscript with those copied by the poet's contemporaries: all of Grishashvili's errors correspond to the Avalishvili manuscript No. H - N1103(9). I. K'enchoshvili, the editor of the second edition of Ch'avch'avadze's collected works, Tkhzulebebi (Tbilisi, 1986), corrected most of Grishashvili's errors, but preserved the spelling "K'avk'asia" and "k'avk'asi." The most recent edition of Ch'avch'avadze's works, Tkhzulebebi (Tbilisi, 1996), finally restores the specific spelling and punctuation of the author's original manuscript, but commits other errors that need not concern us. I. K'enchoshvili, in Tkhzulebebi (1986), 288-89, asserts that "K'avk'azia" was written in 1824-26 on the basis of the watermark dated 1824 that is found on the pages of the extant manuscript. We believe that a compari- son of the latter text with Kiknadze's copy allows us to state only that the poem was written some time between 1824, the date of the watermark, and 1832, the last year that Kiknadze could have copied the text (he was arrested that year for taking part in the anti-Russian conspiracy and died a year later). This point is important, since the date of the poem's composition determines which Russian texts Ch'avch'avadze could have known when writing "K'avk'azia." The highly plausible presence in the poem of several Russian intertexts dating from the period between 1824 and 1832 also persuades us as to the validity of ascribing a somewhat later date of composition. 41.

Gol'tsev, in Literaturno-kriticheskie stat'i: Klassicheskaia i sovremennaia gruzinskaia literatura (Tbilisi, 1957), 55, writes that "certain later poems by A. Ch'avch'avadze are composed in the spirit of Russian and Western romanticism. For example, the poem 'The Caucasus' gives us a picture of the wild unfettered natural scenery of the Caucasus, rich in imagery and romantically elevated in tone." This observation is not substantiated by any specific references or further analysis. Vano Shaduri, in Dekabristskaia literatura i gruzinskaia obshchestvennost' (Tbilisi, 1958), 501, goes somewhat further, calling the poem "akin thematically and conceptually to the well-known 'Cauca- sian works' of the Decembrist poets, and of Pushkin and Lermontov," but gives no analysis of the analogy beyond the false identification of the natural detail in the poem as "realist." A few pages later Shaduri points to the possible Decembrist roots of the Prometheus image found at the end of the poem (p. 502), and suggests further parallels between Ch'avch'avadze's poem and such Russian works as Lermontov's "Spor" ("An Argument"), Pushkin's "Kavkaz" ("The Caucasus"), and "Puteshestvie v Arzrum" ("Journey to Arzrum"), as well as unnamed writings by Odoevskii, Bestuzhev-Marlinskii, and Kornilovich. This list, while not inaccurate, is chaotic and incomplete, and shows little understanding of the Caucasian topos as an evolving Russian theme. Astonishingly, Shaduri then dismisses the possi- bility of a serious study of possible Russian "influences" on Ch'avch'avadze's poem in view of the fact that he could not establish when it was composed. "The certain similarity between [these works]," concludes Shaduri, "can possibly be explained by the similar views held by all the authors on this question" (p. 503). Bogomolov, in Aleksandr Chavchavadze i russkaia kul'tura, dismisses the need for a serious analysis of this rich Russo-Georgian intertext for the same reason: "The most important thing is not a certain analogy between plot-situations, poetic images and compo- sitional devices etc., but the proximity in terms of creative thought and ideological direction shown by these poets of different nationality who wrote at the same time" (pp. 40-41). Shaduri's subsequent comments on the question, Pushkin i gruzinskaia obshchestvennost' (Tbilisi, 1966), 188-191, like Bogomolov's in "A. S. Pushkin i gruzinskie romantiki," Spaiany druzhboi, 33-34, are in fact reformulations of their earlier views. Georgian-language criticism has had even less to say about this question: cf. M. K'ak'abadze, Kartuli romant'izmis erovnuli sapudzvlebi (Tbilisi, 1983), 87 ("A. Chavchavadze has a fairly long poem called 'The Caucasus' where the influence of Pushkin's 'Caucasus' is felt"). 6The Georgian text of"K'avk'azia" is taken from A. Ch'avch'avadze, Tkhzulebebi (Tbilisi, 1996), 82-83. Readers can compare our literal translation to the two very different Russian translations undertaken by the same poet, P. Antokol'skii, in Gruzinskie romantiki (Moscow, 1989), 56-58, and Antologiia gruzinskoi poezii (Moscow, 1958) 250-51, republished in A. Chavchavadze.

The vast ma- jority of these intertexts seem to us indisputable; in other cases, such as Tepliakov and Ryleev, we may be dealing with widely circulating ideological or literary cliches rather than with an immediate textual correlation. The list of intertexts provided may not be exhaustive: one could probably supplement it with further quotes from lesser romantic or Decembrist poets. We have also provided, for the sake of interest, three texts composed (or in the case of Pushkin's "Puteshestvie v Arzrum" at least published) after "K'avk'azia" was likely to have been written: these are marked in italics, since they cannot be considered intertexts in the narrow sense of the term. The Russian intertexts are:7 (,4.): G. Derzhavin, "Vozvrashchenie grafa Zubova iz Persii" (1797) (oK.): V. Zhukovskii, "K Voeikovu. Poslanie" (1814) (I. 1): A. S.

Polonskii's "V Imeretii" (1848), whose closing lines closely match the conclusion of Ch'avch'avadze's poem, but view Russia's civilizing mission in a more sceptical light (cf.

One might even say that it was through Russian romanticism that Ch'avch'avadze, and with him the Georgian poetic tradition, discovered the Caucasus as an aesthetically charged landscape. A qualification is immediately necessary here. Elements of the alpine land- scape of the Northern Caucasus had of course figured in Georgian poetry before, but in the form of descriptive epithets and evocations of specific natural detail. Nowhere in the preceding centuries of Georgian folk verse or high literature do we find a representation of the North Caucasus in its natural beauty as an extended and aesthetically self-sufficient topos., To understand Ch'avch'avdze's literary innovation as well as its significant political ramifications, it becomes necessary to comment briefly on the place of the Caucasus in the Russian poetic tradition. For the eighteenth-century odic poets such as Lomonosov, the orient (and increasingly the Caucasus) had functioned primarily as a geopolitical sign, whose few discernible physical features were designated much as a cartographer would attribute location. The ceremonial odes of Lomonosov read as allegorical maps in which space is marked as territory whose acquisition might accrue glory to the empress and the empire. Imperial space was generated on the basis of two axes: a horizontal axis repre- senting the infinitely receding confines of Russia's territories, and a vertical axis from whose imaginary height the empire might be viewed. The vertical axis was frequently 8The eighteenth-century poet Davit Guramishvili's Davitiani is a case in point: even in those sections of his epic where the poet describes his captivity in Daghestan at the hands of the Lezghins, the mountain landscape plays no significant symbolic role. See Davit Guramishvili, Davitiani (Tbilisi, 1980), 197-223 (in Russian translation, Bedstviia Gruzii, Cantos 12-18, in Stikhotvoreniia ipoemy [Leningrad, 1980], 98-112). In any case, Guramishvili's compen- dium was first published in an incomplete edition in 1852 and in full only in 1870, so we can exclude the possibility of his directly influencing the Georgian romantics.</page><page sequence="10">10 Harsha Ram and Zaza Shatirishvili achieved by personifying the empire as a kind of human colossus who bestraddled and surveyed his domain much as Gulliver would have seen Lilliput. Thus Lomonosov speaks of Russia as a giantess who "turns her merry gaze / and counts the prosperity around her, / Resting with her elbow on the Caucasus."9 Ch'avch'avadze's imaging of the Caucasus as a huge ungainly giant had its ultimate origins in Lomonosov's "odic maps," but its imme- diate source were the Russian romantics, to whom we now turn. The Russian romantic rendering of the Caucasus was first elaborated in two poems, Derzhavin's "Vozvrashchenie grafa Zubova iz Persii" (1797) and Zhukovskii's "K Voeikovu. Poslanie" (1814). These poems eliminate the allegorical personification of empire and establish the realm of nature as a self-sufficient aesthetic experience arising from the dia- lectic between the traveller's gaze and the magnificent alpine scenery. The spectacular upward thrust of the mountains offered a natural vertical axis to replace the abstract spa- tial figurations of the eighteenth-century ode. Quintessentially a place of "terror and gran- deur," the Caucasus would furnish the Russian imagination with a topography of the sub- lime, much as the Swiss Alps had functioned for preromantic and romantic verse in Eu- rope.1" The alpine sublime selectively dwelt on those aspects of the mountain scenery that inspired awe or fear: soaring heights and plunging depths, sudden avalanches and torren- tial cascades, snow-capped peaks and lush green valleys. It was Pushkin's Kavkazskii plennik (1822) that established the Caucasus as a Rus- sian literary tradition, a topos with a discernible set of features. The sublime alpine land- scape and the tenaciously independent inhabitants of the North Caucasus region would constitute its primary descriptive elements. These pictorial and ethnographic details would be contextualized, frequently by the narrative or lyric voice itself, within the broader the- ater of a prolonged colonial war that did much to define Russia in the nineteenth century as an imperial power. At least in Pushkin's romantic verse, however, imperial conflict did not function simply as an objectifying historical category; rather, it provided a dialectical counterpoint to Pushkin's psychological experiment in a new form of subjectivity known as the Byronic or romantic hero. The romantic hero, still absent in the poems by Derzhavin and Zhukovskii cited above, allowed for a more nuanced relationship between the subjec- tive and objective realm. Political alienation and existential restlessness are persistent traits of the romantic hero in Pushkin and Lermontov, preventing us from reading their works as unequivocally supportive of the Russian imperial state. Beyond the evocative power of Pushkin's lyric descriptions of the region, it is this play of self and history that constitutes the real interest of the Caucasian topos in Pushkin. How does Ch'avch'avadze's "K'avk'azia" relate to this Russian tradition? As the textual evidence overwhelmingly indicates, the poem is effectively a patchwork of 9M. V. Lomonosov, Polnoe sobranie sochinenii (Moscow, 1952), 8:221-22. 1oFor an extended discussion of the sublime and its role in shaping Russia's Caucasian theme see Susan Layton, Russian Literature and Empire: Conquest of the Caucasus from Pushkin to Tolstoi (Cambridge, England, 1994); Harsha Ram, "Russian Poetry and the Imperial Sublime," in Russian Subjects: Empire, Nation and the Culture of the Golden Age, ed.

To the Russian tradition Ch'avch'avadze clearly owes that mode of evoking landscape which we have called the alpine sublime. The vertical axis is filled with natural details that are both "terrifying" (sashinelad) and "splendid" (mshvenad), corresponding precisely to the combination of horror (uzhasy) and beauty (krasy) found in Derzhavin and his successors. This formula effectively dictates the na- ture of the descriptive detail found in the Russians as in Ch'avch'avadze, from the ava- lanches and precipitous cascades to the anthropomorphic (or better still theomorphic) rep- resentation of the mountain range as a giant god. To quote, however, is always to rewrite: Ch'avch'avadze's poem is of interest to us as much for what it excludes of the Russian tradition as for what it includes. Absent in Ch'avch'avadze are any references to the human inhabitants of the Northern Caucasus: we find deer and goats, but none of the evocations of fierce Circassians and Chechens that abound in the poems of Zhukovskii, Pushkin, and Lermontov. In the absence of ethno- graphic detail the Caucasus appears through most of Ch'avch'avadze's poem as a hyposta- sis of nature, both a part of the created world and the theurgic force behind its creation. Whether apocalyptic or occasionally pastoral, the Caucasus are decidedly not human." As important as the omission of ethnographical detail is the absence in Ch'avch'avadze of a romantic lyric hero who might bear witness to the sublime in nature and then be transported by it. Although we find traces of a human subject in references to "snowy avalanches that captivate the ear and eye," we are unable to answer the question, "who sees or hears?"-precisely the question whose answer is the rhetorical basis of Derzhavin's poem, which addresses Count Zubov in a series of apostrophes that begin "you saw" (ty zrel). The only human named by Ch'avch'avadze until the poem's very end is Prometheus, whose chains are themselves emblematic of the limits the poem imposes on psychological response. Ch'avch'avadze's poem thus remains suspended outside humanity and history, until the final stanza. It is only in the closing lines that history appears to finally and violently shatter the natural barrier the Caucasus represents, thereby accomplishing what neither Prometheus nor the realm of nature (in the form of the mountain goat and the River Terek) was able to do. In these lines Ch'avch'avadze's debt to Pushkin is overwhelming: not only is the use of the River Terek as a symbol of checked force or frustrated strength taken from Pushkin's "Kavkaz" and "Obval," one might read the entire final stanza as a Georgian poet's response to the notorious epilogue to Pushkin's Kavkazskiiplennik. In the epilogue, we will recall, Pushkin hopes one day to "celebrate the glorious hour/ when, sensing a bloody battle,/ Our two-headed eagle rose / Against the indignant Caucasus" and then provides a list of courageous Russian military leaders who waged campaigns against the North Caucasian tribes. Ch'avch'avadze's closing lines reproduces the celebratory martial pathos of Pushkin's epilogue but reduces his list of heroes to one. Pushkin's "valorous" General Tsitsianov reappears here as the "brave" Tsitsishvili, crucially identified here by the Georgian form of "Among the variant lines to this poem we find the following: "The formerly free Ingush and Ossetians / felt fear and astonishment for the first time" (Manuscript S N248 1-a, first published in K'enchoshvili's 1986 edition, Tkhzulebebi, 289). In rejecting these lines Ch'avch'vadze eliminated both the ethnographic element of the Caucasian sublime as well as the possibility of a concrete human subject capable of responding to the sublime in nature or history.</page><page sequence="12">12 Harsha Ram and Zaza Shatirishvili his name. "Raised as a Russian warrior" yet Georgian by blood, Tsitsianov is the historical figure through whom Ch'avch'avadze is able to articulate his qualified support for the Russian conquest of the region. Born, like Ch'avch'avadze, in Russia, Pavel Dmitrievich Tsitsianov-Tsitsishvili ( 1754-1806) enjoyed a prominent career in the Russian army, serving as the tsar's governor-general in Georgia from 1802. In radically improving the condition of the Georgian Military Highway linking Russia and Georgia, in successfully annexing Mingrelia to the Russian Empire, and in suppressing an uprising in the Georgian high- lands, Tsitsianov proved himself a loyal Russian subject; in opening a school for the Geor- gian nobility in Tiflis and granting them many of the privileges reserved for Russian noblemen (such as exemption from corporal punishment as well as recruitment into high positions in state service), Tsitsianov also demonstrated an ability to mediate between the new Russian dispensation and the interests of the Georgian elite.12 A unique document authored by Ch'avch'avadze himself throws further light on how the poet regarded Tsitsianov as well as the consequences of Russian colonial policies in Georgia and the North Caucasus. In 1837, Ch'avch'avadze took the unusual step of writ- ing a report to Tsar Nicholas I, "A Short Historical Essay on Georgia and its Condition from 1801 to 1831.3"" A candid and courageous document considering to whom it was addressed, the "Essay" commented pointedly on the systemic failures of the tsarist admin- istration over thirty years even as it reasserted the loyalty of Ch'avch'avadze and the Geor- gian people to the Russian sovereign. The "Essay" singled out Tsitsianov as a rare excep- tion to the rule of abuse and neglect that prevailed under successive colonial administra- tors in Georgia: Prince Tsitsianov, who possessed a basic idea of the condition in which Georgia and her neighboring lands found themselves, could not help but note the error committed by his predecessor, but he could do no more than seek to remedy the abuses arising from the aforesaid error, moreover, without entertaining any hope of establishing a desired sense of order on account of the lack of resources allo- cated to such a task, which should have been anticipated at the very beginning.14 Among the geopolitical advantages which Ch'avch'avadze saw accruing to Russia through its annexation of Georgia was the fact that the "Caucasian mountaineers were now sur- rounded." If subjugated, argued Ch'avch'avadze, these mountain peoples "would doubt- less increase the number of imperial subjects," while "if left in their previous condition would constitute a danger to the Empire's southern border."" Georgia, then, provided '2See Ronald Grigor Suny, The Making of the Georgian Nation (Bloomington, 1988), 68. '3"Kratkii istoricheskii ocherk Gruzii i ee polozheniia s 1801 po 1831 lgg."

Falsely attributed to Luka Isarlov, it was first published in a posthumous edition of his works, Pis'ma o Gruzii (Tiflis, 1899), 297-323.

The latter idea is also taken up by Ch'avch'avadze in "K'avk'azia," but with the striking omission of any mention of the highlanders themselves. We can thus speak of two liminal or threshold figures in Ch'avch'avadze's poem, Tsitsianov and, more figuratively, the Caucasian mountains themselves. The Caucasus are evoked by the poem in many guises: it is an invincible and self-sufficient body that re- mains unchanging even as it effects change all around it; it is a mediating bridge between the Black and the Caspian Seas; finally, it is a natural barrier, soon to collapse, between Russia and Transcaucasia. Two of these guises are challenged by Tsitsianov, whose con- struction of the Georgian Military Highway will be seen to bridge not only Georgia and Russia, but equally nature (the alpine sublime) and culture (Western enlightenment). Like Lermontov's "Spor" (which Ch'avch'avadze of course could not have known when writing "K'avk'azia"), the poem reads ultimately as the defeat of nature by history. By the poem's end the trichotomy of Russia/North Caucasus/Georgia has been eroded in favor of the increasingly homogeneous space of imperial modernity. Ch'avch'avadze's poem is a suggestive example of poetic intertextuality in a colonial context. Ch'avch'avadze borrows heavily from the topoi and imagery of a newly hege- monic Russian and European tradition, but the poem he writes is not just a pale copy of the dominant model. The Russian imperial sublime had involved two axes: a vertical axis provided in the romantic period by the alpine landscape, and a horizontal axis created by the panoramic stretch of conquered territory that was viewed from a height by the enrap- tured lyric subject. It was the intersecting of these two axes that had allowed for an en- counter between the sublime and history. In Ch'avch'avadze's poem the vertical axis is not complemented by a horizontal one: there is no "I" who sees and no larger territory to see. The vertical and the horizontal remain in conflict to the end, preventing the poet and the poem from identifying with the Russian Empire as a whole. The ideological effects of the Russian sublime are thus reduced to the far more limited hope that with empire will come the advantages of new ways of thinking. Ch'avch'avadze's "geopoetical" strategy may thus be stated as follows: the poem initially accepts the "trichotomy" of Russia/Georgia/ North Caucasus, only to have Russia effectively abolish the Northern Caucasus and absorb Georgia. While the "abolition" of the North Caucasus is presented as the conquest of a natural world seemingly uninhabited by humans, the absorption of Georgia is presented in cultural terms, as the arrival of modernity that is welcomed and even facilitated by the Georgians themselves.

His great epic poem Bedi Kartlisa (The Fate of Georgia, 1839) conveys the poet's view of the Russian annexation of his land as an unavoidable but tragic neces- sity, politically sound but spiritually enervating. Such a conclusion did not prevent Baratashvili from pursuing the cultural and professional fruits of Russia's ascendancy: namely, a dialogue with European romanticism and the chance of pursuing a career as an officer in the Russian army, perhaps the only attractive avenue then open to a young Geor- gian man of high birth. Regrettably, few of Baratashvili's aspirations were to be realized: a childhood accident left him crippled and unfit for military service, his love for Aleksandre Ch'avch'avadze's second daughter Ekaterine was never reciprocated, and his hopes for further study in Russia were dashed by his family's financial destitution. Compelled by circumstances to take up the prosaic career of a tsarist official, Baratashvili perished dur- ing a malaria epidemic in the provincial Azeri town of Ganja, where he had been ap- pointed deputy governor. Unknown and unpublished at the time of his death, Baratashvili found posthumous acclaim in the second half of the nineteenth century, when his typically romantic juxtaposition of unrealized individual aspiration and historical loss provided an eloquent idiom for Georgia's resurgent sense of nationhood. Two of Baratashvili's poems are relevant to our concerns: the little-remembered and seldom-published "The Battle of Georgia's Princes, Noblemen, and Peasants against the Daghestanis and Chechens in 1844 under the Leadership of the provincial Marshal Prince Dmitrii Tamazovich Orbeliani," written in 1844, and the poem "Merani" (1841), arguably the most celebrated poem in nineteenth-century Georgian poetry.

Whereas Ch'avch'avadze had reduced the trichotomy to only two elements, Russia and Georgia, by finally excluding the North Caucasus Baratashvili here eliminates Russia entirely, leaving Georgia to con- front the North Caucasian highlanders on its own. A reader unaware of the date of the poem's composition might indeed assume that the poem had been written in some earlier age, when Georgia was still independent and before Russia had encroached upon the re- gion. The voice of King Irakli II resounding from the heavens gives an imaginary histori- cal basis to Baratashvili's fantasy, which projects the military campaigns of the 1840s onto the political realities of the eighteenth century. This fantasy corresponded precisely to what might be called the discourse of retribution that had wide currency in Georgian society during Baratashvili's time. According to this discourse, the participation of Geor- gians in Russia's North Caucasian wars was just revenge for the raids which the tribes of Daghestan had conducted to devastating effect in eastern Georgia during the eighteenth century. By participating in Russia's subjugation of the Caucasus, Georgians were thus not just exacting vengeance for past injuries, they were also resurrecting the political con- text in which those injuries were suffered. In Baratashvili's poem this is expressed with extreme clarity: Georgia appears not as a conquered region of the Russian Empire, but as an independent entity here represented by the sum of its historical provinces, Kartli, Kakheti, Lower Kartli, and the mountainous north. This spatial unity acquires a fantasmatic conti- nuity in time through the evocation of rulers and military heroes from Georgia's past. Like the discourse of retribution that it expresses, the poem effectively obscures the historical present, allowing the North Caucasian wars to serve as partial compensation for Georgia's loss of independence. A similar historical perspective can be found in two better known poems by Baratashvili, the epic Bedi Kartlisa (The Fate of Georgia) and "Saplavi mepis Iraklisa" ("The Grave of King Irakli," 1842): all three view Baratashvili's own time through the prism of the eighteenth century. Yet while "Saplavi mepis Iraklisa" and Bedi Kartlisa attempt to reconcile past and present by surrendering to the reality of Russian conquest, "The Battle of Georgia's Princes" seeks to evade precisely that reality. This conflation of distinct historical periods is also achieved by other, specifically poetic, means. The entire poem is permeated by the rhetorical figures and tropes taken from the Georgian poetic tradition of the sixteenth-eighteenth centuries; even its meter, the sixteen-syllable shairi, is the metrical form of Georgia's epics, such as Rustaveli's twelfth-century Knight in the Panther Skin. This recourse to the classical tradition was exceptional for Baratashvili: this was his only extended poem in the shairi meter. The poem, then, is an anachronism, comparable to Pushkin's selective revival of the eigh- teenth-century ode in his anti-Polish poems of 1831. By resuscitating the poetics and thematics of traditional Georgian poetry, Baratashvili resurrects a Georgia of times past. The poem restores to Georgia its lost territorial unity and sovereignty, but at the price of erasing what made Baratashvili's other poems so unique in the Georgian context: their romantic sensibility, and specifically the voice of the romantic lyric hero. This would, however, be the voice of Baratashvili's poem "Merani," to which we now turn.</page><page sequence="18">18 Harsha Ram and Zaza Shatirishvili "MERANI" Arguably the most celebrated Georgian poem written between Rustaveli and the twentieth century, Baratashvili's "Merani" (1842)-the title, referring to the lyric hero's horse, was attributed to the poem by subsequent generations-has been traditionally read as a cel- ebration of the quintessentially romantic theme of flight.

Elaborating the hero's desire to escape beyond the confines of time and space, the poem contains no tangible references to history or geography. It might thus come as a surprise that this supremely utopian poem has a dramatic and immediate historical refer- ent, albeit one that is not evident from the poem itself. Indeed, one might say that the poem's unstated task is to erase this referent in order to assert the poet's search for a place outside time and space. It is essential, then, that we reconstruct this context, even as we honor the poem's desire to obscure it. On 22 March 1842, Ilia Orbeliani (1817-53), the poet's uncle, peer, and classmate, was captured along with other officers of the Russian army and their families by the cel- ebrated North Caucasian resistance leader Imam Shamil. As one critic has observed, of all of Baratashvili's contemporaries it was Ilia Orbeliani who most intrigued the poet, an "object of rapturous interest, but at the same time his clear polar opposite.""9 Ilia's distin- guished military career, consolidated through a series of legendary encounters with the Daghestani forces of Shamil, contrasted sharply with Baratashvili's unrealized hopes for an active life. Clearly agitated by the news of Ilia's captivity, Baratashvili wrote a letter some months later to Ilia's brother, the poet Grigol Orbeliani, in which he detailed his response to Ilia's fate, and to which he then appended the poem "Merani": I don't know whether you will like these lines. Here many tears, sincere and affected, were shed when they were read, naturally for the reason that they are being spoken by Ilia while in captivity, and not by me. To tell you the truth, the news of his capture saddened me greatly, so that for three days I was as if in a fog from being assailed by thousands of different terrifying thoughts and desires, and if someone then had asked me what I wanted I would not have known what to say. Finally on the third day I wrote this poem which seems to have brought me some relief.20 From Baratashvili's letter it is clear that "Merani" was born out of an intense identi- fication with the fate of his captive uncle Ilia Orbeliani. "Merani" is thus the desperate cry 19Guram Asatiani, "Merani" i ego avtor (Moscow, 1975), 7. 20Baratashvili, Tkhzulebani, 177 (Stikhotvoreniia, poema, pis'ma, 122; emphasis added).</page><page sequence="21">Romantic Topography and the Dilemma of Empire 21 of yet another "prisoner of the Caucasus." This fact is widely known, but also generally forgotten, and for reasons that seem related to the poem's own textual strategy. For if "Merani" was created as a response to the trichotomous configuration that is the subject of this article, its way of dealing with the geopolitics of the time is unique. Unlike the previous two poems, which abolish only one of the three elements of the trichotomy-the North Caucasus or Russia-"Merani" abolishes all markers of geography and history, including Georgia itself. The principal strategy of the poem is in fact to erode the distinc- tion between the native and the foreign: the symbolic landscape of the poem is systemati- cally stripped of any toponymic markers and historical features. To this emptied land- scape corresponds the deterrfitorialized body of the lyric hero, who is imaged in the present as a horseman gallopping aimlessly through space-"pathless and traceless" (ugzo ukvlod)-and in the future as the skeletal remnants of a once living man, The poet's goal is to transcend the bounds of fate (or fatal boundary: bedis samzghvari can mean both) that keep him tied to his native soil. Only the natural world escapes the poem's strategy of despecification, taking on the rituals of burial and lamentation that would normally be performed by the hero's kinsmen. A vast divide thus separates Baratashvili's "Merani" from Ch'avch'avadze's "K'avk'azia." Ch'avch'avadze's position, in politics as in literature, was essentially con- servative: his moderate vision of reconciliation with Russia as the bearer of Western mo- dernity finds its literary analogy in a poetics that, at least in the case of the poem we have read, is deeply indebted to the Russian tradition. Baratashvili's position was considerably more radical: both the poems we have examined suggest a desire to flee the contingent circumstances of his own time and place, corresponding to a literary strategy that, while quintessentially romantic, also outstrips similar poems by his romantic contemporaries in Russia and Poland. The names of Adam Mickiewicz and Mikhail Lermontov are usually mentioned as Baratashvili's closest analogues, and it would be useful in conclusion to examine "Merani" alongside related or comparable works by these two poets. The poem most often cited as directly influencing Baratashvili's "Merani" is Mickiewicz's "Farys." Written in 1828 during Mickiewicz's period of Russian exile, "Farys" is "said to have been suggested by a most prosaic incident, a ride home through a storm over the rough streets of St. Petersburg."21 This incident was transformed by Mickiewicz into a stylized oriental lyric celebrating the desperate ride of an Arab horseman "headlong upon the desert vast." Both horse and rider encounter various elements of the natural world-rocks, a vulture, a cloud, and finally a hurricane-that affirm a universe hostile and indifferent to the affairs of men. In a final twist, the rider "grapples with the writhing sand" and defeats the hurricane, a victory more spiritual than physical, since it derives from the sudden onset of a sublime awareness of his human capacity to "embrace / the world in friendship - to my breast / I gather it, from east to west!" This sublime cognition is the poem's closing paradox: since it is the dying horseman's final thought, it 21George Rapall Noyes, "Introduction," in Poems by Adam Mickiewicz, trans. George Rapall Noyes (New York, 1944), 19.</page><page sequence="22">22 Harsha Ram and Zaza Shatirishvili simultaneously represents nature's physical victory over man and man's spiritual triumph over the elements.22 It is widely assumed that Baratashvili was intimately acquainted with the Russian translation of "Farys," which appeared in print even before the Polish original.23 The poem, its theme and style, would have spoken to Baratashvili in numerous ways. Mickiewicz's interest in the Islamic orient had in fact been stimulated by his contact with Russia's southern peripheries: one might even say that the poem's exotic locale, as well as the human struggle it dramatizes, are a kind of stylistic and thematic compensation for the loss of freedom experienced by the Polish poet and his nation. The analogy between the fate of Georgia and that of Poland would have been clear to a patriot of either nation; more subtle is the way both poems similarly affirm and obscure the personal and historical circumstances of their creation. As M. Filina has observed, both "Farys" and "Merani" acquire that level of universality in their expression of human needs and desires when the reasons that brought them into being fade away and are in time forgotten. And truly, the inner charge of these poems is irreconcilable either with the fact of Baratashvili's uncle Ilia Orbeliani's captiv- ity ... or with that storm in Petersburg which the Polish poet experienced and to which he felt obliged to respond in verse.24 This observation is correct but also inadequate, since it ignores the fact that the process of abstraction by which both poems acquire their universality is in itself in need of interpre- tation. While Mickiewicz replaces the predicament of a Pole in Russia with a stylized orient, Baratashvili provides his poem with neither a clear geographical setting nor a sequential narrative. Unlike Mickiewicz's Arab, Baratashvili's rider remains unreconciled to his homeland and to the universe at large. His only consolation is the hope that the path he has taken might ease the life journey of generations to come. Even more than to Mickiewicz, Baratashvili's work has been compared to the poetry of Lermontov. Indeed, Baratashvili was dubbed the "Georgian Lermontov" from the mo- ment his verse appeared in print. As one early critic put it, "[Baratashvili's] gift bore the imprint of disenchantment and dissatisfaction, of joyless melancholy, that marks the po- etry of Lermontov."25 To these psychological commonalities one might add a similarly 22Poems by Adam Mickiewicz, 231-35. The Polish text of "Farys" can be found in Adam Mickiewicz, Dziela (Warsaw, 1955), 321-26. 23"Farys" was translated into Russian by V. N. Schastnyi; this text was probably recited to Baratashvili by his Russian teacher Dement'ev (see Iona Meunargia, Tskhovreba dap'oezia Nik'oloz Baratashvilisa [Tbilisi, 1968], 12). We might also note that Baratashvili's poem mirrors many stylistic devices of "Farys," such as the succession of stanzas of different metrical length, as well as the use of a refrain. 24"M.

For all these commonalities, Baratashvili's work reveals little in the way of direct Lermontovian influences.26 The Lermontov poems that most strikingly recall Baratashvili's "Merani"--"Spesha na sever izdaleka" ("Hastening northward from afar," written in 1837 but published in 1845) or "Son" ("The Dream," written in 1841 and first published in 1843)-cannot be considered real intertexts, since both appeared in print after "Merani" was written (Baratashvili knew Lermontov's work chiefly through his collection of 1840). Nevertheless, a brief typological comparison of "Merani" and these poems might be useful.27 The above-mentioned Lermontov poems arise from the poet's two periods of exile in the North Caucasus. Both reflect the anxiety of displacement, which deepens into a fear provoked by something greater than the sheer physical distance of the poet from his home- land. In "Spesha na sever izdaleka" the poet addresses Mount Kazbek as he embarks on his journey from the Caucasus back to Russia. The Caucasus mountains here function as a kind of mediator between earth and sky, a divine intercessor capable of facilitating the fulfillment of human hopes and desires. The poet prays first for safe passage and benign weather, but we ultimately learn that his deepest fear is of having been forgotten by his near and dear ones back home. If he has indeed been forgotten, says the poet, then may Mount Kazbek send a snowstorm to scatter his ashes in the ravines (this final stanza is particularly reminiscent of Baratashvili: his hero is also buried by a snowstorm). Lermontov's "Son" returns to address this fear. In this poem the lyric hero is a Russian soldier lying mortally wounded in a "valley of Daghestan." In his dying moments, he dreams of his beloved back in his native land, who in turn dreams of him as a "familiar corpse" lying in the Daghestani valley. In dreaming simultaneously of each other, the soldier and his beloved create a kind of fantasmatic circuit of intimacy that compensates for the soldier's physical death abroad: although abandoned and unburied, he will still be remembered and mourned by those closest to him. Like Lermontov's above two poems, "Merani" also deals with the loss of homeland as a consequence, both personal and political, of empire. Yet "Merani" also disavows the basic descriptive strategy and ideological premise of Lermontov's poems. Like Mickiewicz's "Farys," "Spesha na sever izdaleka" and "Son" always offer the minimum amount of de- scriptive detail by which the reader can identify the poems' landscape and the provenance of the lyric hero. The valley of "Son" is Daghestani, while the title of "Spesha na sever izdaleka" clearly provides the direction and destination of the hero's journey, which is further specified by clear topographical and climatic markers throughout the poem itself. 26Baratashvili quotes the famous Lermontovian line "I skuchno i grustno, i nekomu ruku podat'..." twice in his correspondence (letters 9 and 18), Tkhzulebani, 183, 198 (Stikhotvoreniia, poema, pis'ma, 124, 134). No other explicit references to Lermontov can be found in his work. 27Lermontov, Sobranie sochinenii 1:432, 530. Critics have previously noted the typological similarities between "Merani" and Lermontov's "Spesha na sever izdaleka." See G Jibladze, "Merani," Mnatobi 1 (1945): 109-23; and M. K'ak'abadze, Kartuli romant'izmis erovnuli sapudzvlebi, 40-45.</page><page sequence="24">24 Harsha Ram and Zaza Shatirishvili These are works of exilic nostalgia, a longing for the Russian motherland that Lermontov would always distinguish from the imperial state. The lyric hero's impersonal death as a soldier in the tsar's army is thus contrasted to the organically Russian structures of kinship manifested in the acts of mourning and memory. Baratashvili's "Merani" denies his lyric hero this final solace. Homeland and ties of kinship are erased along with the historical context from which the poem arose: mourning and memory are now the prerogatives of nature rather than of history. Baratashvilii's poetic vision, we might add, was in some ways prescient: the poet died unknown and unremembered, and his body was buried in Azerbaijan where he spent his final years. By a further twist of fate, his remains were to be disinterred and reburied not once but twice: for the first time in 1893, when his body was brought from Ganja to Tiflis, and for the second time in 1938, when it was finally laid to rest in the Pantheon of Geor- gian heroes on Mtatsminda. This two-stage act of repatriation has of course much to do with the history of modem Georgian nationalism, as well as with the nationalities policy of the Soviet Union. One might also speculate whether this understandable act of restitu- tion also in some sense betrayed the utopian spirit of Baratashvili's "Merani." THREE STRATEGIES OF GEORGIAN ROMANTICISM To conclude, we can say that the Georgian romantics deployed three "geopoetic" strategies to deal with the trichotomy of Georgia, Russia, and the North Caucasus. The first of these can be termed a strategy of partial identification, by which the colonized Georgian elite found many, though not all, of its aspirations met by Georgia's absorption into the Russian Empire. Ch'avch'avadze's "K'avk'azia" expresses this model with absolute clarity: Geor- gia here aligns itself with Russia at the expense of the North Caucasus, which is seen as a natural and political barrier to Europeanization and modernization. Like much of the Russian tradition to which it is heavily in debt, "K'avk'azia" evocatively portrays the sub- lime grandeur of the Caucasus only to celebrate its defeat by modem civilization, here represented by the Russified Georgian Tsitsianov. The second strategy we have seen involves a truncation or suspension of history. Here Russia, not the Caucasus, is eliminated, and Georgia appears as a sovereign nation waging war against the North Caucasian rebels without Russian aid. The realities of Baratashvili's time are abandoned in favor of a nostalgic return to a time preceding Rus- sian encroachment, and an archaic, preromantic poetics corresponds to this nostalgic theme. The third model, manifested by Baratashvili's masterpiece "Merani," can be termed a utopian strategy of deterritorialization. Not only do Russia and the North Caucasus van- ish, Georgia itself is left behind, and with it all markers of geographical location and biological or cultural affinity. If Ch'avch'avadze's "K'avk'azia" remains both poetically and politically in debt to the Russians, then with "Merani" Georgian romanticism strikes a note of unique defiance, moving beyond the stylistic and ideological resolutions adopted by Baratashvili's romantic contemporaries in Russia and Poland. If the nonliterary careers of Ch'avch'avadze, Orbeliani, and Baratashvili point chiefly to instances of resistance, cooptation, or critical engagement in the political realities of the</page><page sequence="25">Romantic Topography and the Dilemma of Empire 25 day, then the poems we have read suggest other ways of living as well as evading history. Their strategies redirect the reader's attention away from the realities of the colonial present, for which they substitute a compensatory or even utopian vision. This is certainly what makes literature different from life; this is also how literature contributes to the aesthetic and cultural models by which history is lived and remembered.</page></plain_text>
