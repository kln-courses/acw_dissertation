SWAMINATHAN Art and the Adivasi* Writing about the art of the Indians of the Pacific North-West Coast, an area extending from Alaska to British Columbia, Levi-Strauss sayi: "This unceasing renewal, this inventive assuredness that guarantees success wherever it is applied, this scorn for the beaten track, bring about ever new improvisations which infallibly lead to dazzling results—to get any idea of them, our times had to await the exceptional destiny of a Picasso."1 Les Demoiselles d'Avignon2 was completed in 1907. Picasso had seen tribal art objects in the studios of his friends, in the flea market and had indeed visited the Musee d'Ethnographie du Trocadero before the completion of Demoiselles. After visiting the Museum Picasso is said to have remarked: "I realised what painting was all about."3 In another statement he asserted: "Primitive sculpture has never been surpassed."4 "All art," said Henry Moore, "has its roots in the primitive."5 And Andre Malraux wrote: "Europe's dominance of the world would have served no purpose if it had not called forth the painting which removed the cataract from our Western eyes and revealed for the first time 'formal dynamism' of works of art whose distortion had formerly been put down to ignorance or clumsiness."6 Sir Herbert Read, in a symposium on "Artist in Tribal Societies" raised the question: "What constitutes artistic quality in primitive art?" and answered, "I wish to avoid the word Ijeauty', because as I have often pointed out the appeal of a work of art is complex, and an element of expressionistic vitality is always present in effective works of art and may even predominate over the element of beauty, which is impersonal and universal. Tribal art in general is vital rather * From The Perceiving Fingers published by Bharat Bhawan, Bhopal.

Beauty might almost be described as a classical prejudice, but it is one which most of us share. I would say that very little aboriginal art can be described as beautiful in this classical sense of the word, but the best of it has a vitality that is not surpassed by any art."7 William Rubin, in his extremely well documented essay on "Modernist Primitivism" says, "The early twentieth century emancipation from the restrictions of a perceptually based art encouraged a variety of aesthetic attributes that parallel those of tribal art. Not the least of these was the freedom to sacrifice the essentially naturalistic proportions to which European artists— however different their styles—had adhered from the Gothic period through Post-Impressionism (and even into the Fauvism of 1905-06). During those centuries, the proportion of the head of the body's total height, varied only within distinct limits. The change in favour of extreme ratios of proportion is anticipated in the latter part of 1906 in Picasso's "Iberian" style, in such pictures as Two Women... But it is in 1907—in the Demoiselles (the lower right-hand figure particularly), and in Matisses such as Le Luxe—that freedom from the older conventions was definitively established. It was soon adapted by the German artists to a practice of "expressive disproportion".8 What we are concerned with here is the vital, expressive, evocative and magical—magical not in the social-anthropological but in the phenomenal sense—dimension of Adivasi art. This vitalist magical dimension as against the naturalistic-representational tradition, is not to be confused with Marx's comparison of our appreciation of child art and the art of classical Greece. When Marx talks about the Greeks "as the normal children of mankind"9 and our capacity to appreciate their art as to be like our appreciation of child art, he is really not talking of Greek art in its plastic expression at all, which is, by and large, naturalistic in form, but of the anthropomorphic content of mythology. Released from the closed world of mythology into the open ended system of history, a Vulcan may not possibly take birth in the industrial age, but surely the neorealists of today are painting or sculpting in a manner very much reminiscent of the naturalism in which the artists of classical Greece rendered their gods and deities. Only, even the imaginative breath of mythology has been replaced by the journalistic reportage of narrative figuration. To give an example in the reverse order, Dali may paint the dream world of</page><page sequence="3">Art and the Adivasi / 115 Freud, but surely he is a naturalist and not a surrealist painter, for he renders the other reality with complete naturalistic fidelity. Greek rationalism counterposed a unilinear opposition to the multi-dimensional and anthropomorphic imagination of tribal art. Thus the seemingly grotesque but highly charged images of tribal expression are so to speak, reduced to the dimensions of a Venus de Milo,10 a perfect naturalistic body-proportion for the bourgeoisie for judging female beauty contests even today. It required a Picasso in our century in the West to for ever "destroy" the Venus as the Western classical notion of beauty in art by creating Les Demoiselles de Avignon. The power and vitality of tribal art was discovered by Picasso and a number of European artists in the very beginning of this century and as William Rubin puts it, they found "affinity" with it. Whether it was a matter of affinity or they were directly influenced by tribal art does not concern us here. What is of significance is the fact that they realised that tribal art was not to be treated either as curio objects or the art of people with "under-developed" minds. They realised that tribal art was not "simple" but highly economical and reductive rendering of complex concepts. Tribal art was not to be treated as "childish" in the sense of being "naive", lacking in adult expression. The conclusion is inescapable that even if on the basis of the technological base of social formations one may accept certain societies as 'primitive' and others as advanced, the notion of primary and advanced stages of development in art on the basis of technological advancement is a pernicious doctrine. If such a notion were to be accepted, one would have to reject all the art of the "past" as well as contemporary manifestations of tribal art, as one rejects obsolete technology. And as for admiring the art of the past as we admire the art of children, it should be noted that even child art does not brook such a simplistic approach. This, however, is another matter. The difficulty in the appreciation of the intrinsic and abiding power of Adivasi art perhaps lies in the fact that many of us still cling to nineteenth century notions of naturalism as it developed in the West. Following the course of the natural sciences, the proponents of naturalism in art wanted art also to adhere to "objectivity", as seen and verifiable phenomena. For Zola, the whole effort was "directed towards obliterating the imaginary with the real".11 Damian Grant is reminded by Zola's relegation of imagination of Plato's expulsion of</page><page sequence="4">116 / J. SWAMINATHAN the poet from the ideal state.12 Bernard Croce states: "The superstitious cult of natural sciences was often accompanied (as is frequently the fate of superstition) by a sort of hypocrisy. Chemical, physical and physiological laboratories became Sybilline grottoes, resounding with the questions of credulous inquirers concerning the profoundest problems of the human spirit." Quoting Hippolyte Taine from his Philosophy of Art, Croce says that "Taine claims to an Aesthetic which fixes characters and indicates laws like Botany, and studies with equal attention orange and ivy, pine and birch; indeed it is a sort of botanical science applied to the work of man instead of the plants."13 Lukacs, in his essay on Zola, talks of the "monotonous commonplace of naturalism, which results from the direct, mechanical mirroring of the humdrum reality of capitalism".14 The inanity of the naked eye was imposed upon the upper urbanised strata of the Indians by the erstwhile English rulers. Thus in 1868 a second rate English painter Theodor Jenson visited India. The Maharaja of Travancore invited him and Ravi Varma15 learnt the technique of oil painting from him. It is to be noted that Ravi Varma learnt not only the oil technique but also picked up academic naturalism at second hand from Jenson. The Duke of Buckingham who was then the Governor of Madras, who thought poorly of the Indian artistic tradition, commissioned Ravi Varma's works with great glee, and his reproductions in oleographs spread throughout the length and breadth of India like wild fire. Anand Coomarswamy thought that Ravi Varma's pictures "are such as any European student could paint, after perusal of the necessary literature and a superficial study of Indian life".16 Havel saw in him "A painful lack of poetic faculty in illustrating the most imaginative Indian poetry and allegory".17 Yet the early English ruler's dictum still holds good in many of our art schools and students still draw from plaster casts of Greek and Roman statuary. And unknowingly and willy-nilly, our urban intelligentsia seems to have acquired the naturalistic blinkers of the former English mentor, with regard to their approach to art whether 'modern' or Adivasi. Inasmuch as the human eye is a lens, its projection of what we see is dependent upon its nature and composition. Moreover, the eye is only one of the sense faculties passing messages to the mind, which may be contradicted by one or more of the other senses. How then do</page><page sequence="5">Art and the Adivasi / 117 we transform a living experience into an image in terms of art? It is easier to understand this point in terms of literature or poetry. The use of similies and metaphors is common and even primary to both. Thus a damsel may have the eyes of a deer or a child may have the face of the moon, a woman may be a bitch and a man a dog or donkey or a monster. However, these anthropomorphic transformations are looked upon, if not with disbelief, than with cynicism as far as painting and sculpture are concerned, and even if such transformations are accepted, they are accepted only as illustrative of a story or a legend or a myth. Thus the naturalistic blinkers are even turned upon the non-visual contributive factors of art, thereby denuding, even these of the palpitating breath of imagination. It is important here to understand the difference between sight and vision. The human eye, of course, projects an image but at the receiving end there is not a blank screen but the human mind. The human mind is not only served by senses other than that of the eye but also genetic perceptions, or perhaps what Jung calls the 'collective unconscious'. The capacity of sight becoming vision lies not in the lenses but in the mind. As Croce says: "What would a picture mean to an imaginary man, lacking all or many of his senses, who should in an instant acquire the organ of sight? The picture we are looking at and believe we see only with our eyes would seem to his eyes to be little more than an artist's paint-smeared pallet."18 The scope of Adivasi imagination is not contained by the constraints of naturalism though it hovers over nature and derives its sustenance from it. The naturalistic approach laid claim to the realisation of the mirror image of objective reality. Art, however, does not mirror nature. It is on the other hand a parallel reality. This parallel reality is possible only because of the all pervading truth of mythology, a function of imagination, which weaves its fabric from the warp and woof of both the world as it exists and the mind as it perceives it in a dual dynamic relationship. The tragedy of a civilisation which took to the route of a unilinear development and the shaping of the one dimensional man,19 led even ideologues like Fischer to assert the primacy of art, and the relevance of the myth even in our own times.20 Let us dwell a little more on the problem of representation in art. We have already dropped the notion that the 'Eye alone' is a guide to perception. It is generally known that Adivasi art lacks a sense of perspective. Historically speaking, the notion of the linear perspective</page><page sequence="6">Paintings by Pando Tribal from Surguja, Madhya Pradesh</page><page sequence="7">Art and the Adivasi / 119 or the so called vanishing point was introduced into painting during the High Renaissance. To state it simply, objects as they recede towards the horizon gradually begin to look smaller and smaller, and as we approach them they start gaining in size. This is the normal experience of the human eye. The introduction of this visual experience into painting was supposed to have made representation more real. However, despite the illusion of the eye objects do not become small or big. In the name of bringing more realism to art, what the Renaissance perspective actually did was to introduce an illusion into painting. It buttressed the illustrative aspect of art to the detriment of its nature as revelation. It also violated the internal compositional structure and positioning of the revealed image by trying to approximate it to the illusion of the eye. To presume that Adivasi artists lack the sense of perspective because of mental deficiency or the technical incapacity of 'proper' representation is to insult both intelligence and art. Moreover to think that the primitive is not aware of the sense of perspective is obviously wrong; for how can he return to his hut or his dwelling once having left it for the hunt or any other purpose, as from a distance he would find it not of the same size as when he left it? Identification would become impossible were he not to know that his hut or his dwelling would look smaller or bigger depending upon his relative position to it. And as regards competence, it would be foolish to think that a mind and a hand capable of such marvellous use and manipulation of line, colour and space would become incapable of realising perspectival juxtaposition. The simple fact which emerges out of this is that the Adivasi has no use for perspective in his painting because he is not attempting to represent reality as seen by the naked eye but is creating a parallel reality of art. The modern movement in art, as is well-known, threw out the renaissance perspective. It also questioned the very fundamentals of representation and attempted a re-definition of art freed from mechanistic and unilogical constraints. I quote here the famous statement of Paul Klee: May I use a simile, the simile of the tree? The artist has studied this world of variety and has, we may suppose, unobtrusively found his way in it. His sense of direction has brought order into the passing stream of image and experience. This sense of direction in nature and</page><page sequence="8">120 / J. SWAMINATHAN life, this branching and spreading array, I shall compare with the root of the tree. From the root the sap flows to the artist, flows through him, flows to his eye. Thus he stands as the trunk of the tree. Battered and stilled by the strength of the flow, he moulds his vision into his work. As, in full view of the world, the crown of the tree unfolds and spreads in time and in space, so with his work. Nobody would affirm that the tree grows its crown in the image of its root. Between above and below can be no mirrored reflection. It is obvious that different functions expanding in different elements must produce vital divergence. But it is just the artist who at times is denied those departures from nature which his art demands. He has even been charged with incompetence and deliberate distortion. And yet, standing at his appointed place, the trunk of the tree, he does nothing other than gather and pass on what comes to him from the depths. He neither serves nor rules—he transmits.21 Shorn of the naturalistic blinkers and the notion of art as mere representation, we now take the leap from the footboard of sight into the realm of vision. Talking of the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, Daniel Helpern writes: "Pictographs and petroglyphs of constellations or elk or antelope draw their magic in part from the process wherein the focus of all prayer and concentration is upon the thing itself, which, in its turn, guides the hunter's hand. Connection with the spirit dimensions requires a figure or form which is all inclusive. A "lifelike" rendering of an elk is too restrictive. Only the elk is itself. A realistic rendering of an elk would be only one particular elk anyway. The purpose of the hunt rituals and magic is to make contact with all the spirits of the Elk."22 All true art, and Adivasi art specifically, is visionary. It is through art that the tyranny of the senses is overcome and the terror of the unknown transcended. Art, therefore, has been the primary need of man for the health of his mind just as food has been for that of his body. It is an essential stimulant for overcoming the boredom of existence, for man is not merely a biological machine. He not merely eats, defecates and makes love, but as a being both perceived</page><page sequence="9">Art and the Adivasi / 121 and perceiving, is for ever locating his place in the cosmos. It is interesting to note that alcoholic beverages and hallucinogenative drugs have been used by man from the very beginnings of time and indeed most Adivasi communities treat them as essentials of life. If such stimulants provide a corporeal means for living in a parallel reality, art is a sublime means of achieving it. In dealing with art, whether Adivasi or otherwise, we must bear in mind that we are not so much concerned with the image of reality as with the reality of the image. The image acquires reality in art as Form. The image springs from our perception of reality or even the conceptualisation of it. However, in art, it passes through a process of transmutation and transformation and not that of translation. The faculty which brings this about is the creative faculty which does not lend itself to analysis but only appears as expression. The image in art, as pointed out above, is not a mirror image. Traced back to its source it would have subserved its purpose—a vehicle of communicating information and, therefore, of no intrinsic value in itself. However, as we know, such is not the case. "In language as a means of communication, the message is received or is supposed to be received as it is meant to be. True communication abhors ambiguity. Even a child writing E = mC2 will not be conveying less than what is meant to be. In language, as a means of communication, the visual face of the vehicle is, so to speak, obliterated. Bad handwriting does not come in the way of what is meant to be communicated. In painting the visual formulation is itself the message. If E = mC2 is to acquire truth in painting, it will have to, over and above, aspire to calligraphy, the visual experience of which does not allow any pegging and reduction to the message conveyed."23 In experiencing art and especially and specifically Adivasi art, this point is of paramount importance. For, from the point of view of social anthropology we may analyse the art and the myths of Adivasi people to arrive at an understanding of their social relationships, but surely we are not presumptuous enough to think that they create art for the benefit of our analytical appetites. To assign to myth or art the sole role of signification by other means of known or knowable facts, is to deny the meaning of the means itself; because in art as in myth the movement is not towards the matrix of its origin but in the opposite direction of the possibilities of redemption from it. It is a flight from "reality" in order to make the imaginable real.</page><page sequence="10">122 / J. SWAM/NATHAN Granting the possibilities of functional and structural analysis of myths in establishing social relationships and the relationship of man to nature, they remain a process of reduction, of abstraction and emaciation, a book-keeper's evidence of such palpable presences which have the capacity to lift us out of the routine of knowledgeable reflex into the wondrous world of experience. As Dr Mary Douglas remarks, "It is partly in this process of semantic chopping that so much of the meaning of myth gets lost."24 In the attempt to define an approach for confronting Adivasi art for art's sake or art as a thing in itself. Without retreating from our stand we shall try to recoup our credibility. Any expression of man, even of a deranged mind, can be traced back to its causes. Unknown scripts may be deciphered, codes may be 'broken'. In this sense the subject matter of art, its content, its source or sources of reference may be traced. But art is not just a symbol or a heiroglyphic character. ".. .the aesthetic dimension cannot validate a reality principle."25 "Like imagination, its constructive mental faculty, the realm of Aesthetic is essentially 'unrealistic'."26 It defies, overcomes and even seduces reason in order to give palpable, tactile form to sensuousness. It does not deal with the realm of hypothesis and the proofs thereof. In a sense it is a specific faculty pertaining to the mind, as the reproductive faculty is to the body. Only in the aesthetic dimension the possibilities of cross-fertilisation are infinite; what may seem impossible in the realm of biology becomes an accepted fact in the realm of art. The semantics of art are guided by the idiosyncratic law of imagination. If we call it a law, it is only because there is an inevitability about it which leads to unanticipated but fully formed results, with completely logical internal structures; a work of art, in fact, can be "understood" in its own terms on the basis of the correlation of its formal elements. "The work of art, as such, is not a faulty and imperfect mere instrument of conveyance. It is an intrinsic and self-sufficient entity, existing in its own right and with its own autonomy."27 Art, of course, is for art's sake, but it is addressed to man, it is addressed to him as a gift from the unknown, as a thing of wonder. An important aspect of Adivasi art is the role of the individual as an artist. Whatever be the motivations, the fact remains that individual genius in Adivasi societies invariably finds expression in works of art which the community may then accept as its collective heritage. As Sir Herbert Read says:</page><page sequence="11">Art and the Adivasi / 123 I believe, it is essentially individualistic in its origins, that the work of the individual artist comes into existence before it is adopted as a social symbol or as part of a communal system of symbolic signs. In other words, I believe that art exists before religious art, or art qualified in any other way, exists. Of course, it becomes immensely difficult to distinguish individual quality in a work of art from its social or religious content. This difficulty increases as society becomes more complex and the individual gets merged into society and has to take his part in the communal activity of creation. But, basically, I think this is psychologically sound. Basically, the work of art is an individual creation and only afterwards thrown into a communal pool, as it were. That, of course, would explain the individual variations which seem to puzzle some anthropologists, individual variations that you find in tribal symbols. I think that these are due to variations of personality or temperament in the individual making the work of art. . . Therefore, I want to maintain that the aesthetic quality in primitive art in general is the same as the aesthetic quality in any other form of art.. .2S And William Rubin states: It is still sometimes said that traditional tribal art was a collective rather than an individual creation involving constant repetition of established formulae, to which the individual carver brought little beyond artisanal skill. My own experience with this art, on the contrary, has confirmed for me the assumption that good art is made only by gifted individuals. I am, in fact, struck by the differences rather than the similarities between tribal pieces of the same style (at least in types not standardised for European taste), and especially by the uniqueness of those works I would call masterpieces. For example, of the dozen or so Grebo masks I have seen, no two are alike, though all include the basic constituents. And the Metropolitan's, the finest of the group, is the least typical. The differences between these masks are just as marked as those between works by anonymous Western artists of Medieval schools in given regions—any particular school of Romanesque sculptors, for example. And the best works of both is distinguished by unique qualities of expressiveness and invention. That sculptures as fine as the Metropolitan's Grebo mask are, indeed rare among primitive objects, that the overwhelming bulk of tribal art is not very good, says nothing about it that would not be true of the production of any period, including—if not especially—our own.29 Our field experience has been the same. Among the various</page><page sequence="12">124 / J. SWAMINATHAN Adivasi communities with whom we established contact, we found that certain individuals in the community were generally recognised as gifted in this direction, and indeed our assessment invariably coincided with the judgement of the people concerned. There is, however, perhaps a difference between the individual as an artist in the Adivasi communities and the individual in our own. Jung says that: Thanks to our one-sided emphasis upon so-called natural causation, we have learned to distinguish what is subjective and psychic from what is objective and 'natural'. For primitive man, on the contrary, the psychic and the objective coalesce in the external world. In the face of something extraordinary it is not he who is astonished, but rather the thing which is astonishing. It is mana-endowed with magic power. What we would call the powers of imagination and suggestion seem to him invisible forces which act upon him from without. His country is neither a geographical nor a political entity. It is that territory which contains his mythology, his religion, all his thinking and feeling in so far as he is unconscious of these functions.30 And again: Primitive man is unpsychological. Psychic happenings take place outside him in an objective way. Even the things he dreams about seem to him real; that is his only reason for paying attention to dreams.31 Marcuse talks of the aesthetic principle being at variance and even in conflict with the reality principle which, he hopes, will be solved thus: "desublimation of reason is just as essential a process in the emergence of a free culture as is the self-sublimation of sensuousness. In the established system of domination the repressive structure of reason and the repressive organisation of the sense faculties supplement and sustain each other." In Freud's terms "civilised morality is the morality of repressed instincts; liberation of the latter implies 'debasement' of the former. But this debasement of the higher values may take them back into the organic structure of the human existence from which they were separated and the reunion may transform this structure itself. If the higher values lose their remoteness, their isolation from and against the lower faculties, the latter may become freely susceptible to culture".32</page><page sequence="13">Art and the Adivasi / 125 Marcuse also says that "Non-repressive order is essentially an order of abundance; the necessary constraint is brought about by 'superfluity' rather than need. Only an order of abundance is compatible with freedom . . . when all basic needs can be satisfied with minimum of time."33 Can we not counterpose austerity to abundance? And indeed what may be termed as austerity or denial or restricting of needs in a society of abundance based upon the unjust distribution of material wealth, becomes abundance in primitive or Adivasi economies? A man living by hunting or by gathering fruits and tubers from the jungle or practising shifting cultivation is a man not at work but at play. Perhaps he is not subject so much to the schizophrenic pressures of the discordance between the play and the work principle. Is not Adivasi art, therefore, the art of a whole man? And indeed, in modern society, as Herbert Read points out: "The final source of power in the artist is given by society, and that is precisely what is lacking in the modern artist. We have no sense of community, tragedy of the modern artist, and only those who are blind to their own social disunity and spiritual separateness blame the modern artist for his obscurity."34 {italics added) Let us not bring out social dis-unity and spiritual separateness to the possibility of our response to Adivasi art or art as such. What I am trying to formulate is a simbiotic approach to art as related to anthropology. This is a radical proposition. It does not involve the static notion of understanding as much as the active notion of participation. //HP he great obsession of nineteenth century was, as we know history," says Michel Foucault, "with its themes 1 of developments and of suspension, of crisis and cycle, themes of the ever accumulating past with its great preponderance of dead men and the menacing glaciation of the world. The nineteenth century found its essential mythological resources in the second principle of thermodynamics. The present epoch will perhaps be above all the epoch of space. We are in the epoch of simultaneity; we are in the epoch of juxtaposition, the epoch of near and far, of the side of side, of the dispersed."35 As we have already said, from our standpoint, we define contemporaneity as a simultaneous validy of co-existing cultures, as</page><page sequence="14">126 / J. SWAMINATHAN is the validity of the simultaneity of events on the matrix of infinity. What is the destiny of man, if it is not man? History as we know, knowing it from the point of view of the West, has reduced man from the status of an aspect of infinity to that of a creature of time. In the unequal development of technologies, the universal brotherhood of man lies bifurcated, chopped into pieces, and whole cultures are subject to a dominant civilisation which has lost the spirit of man. For man to become homo sapiens, as indeed he is conceived by anthropology to start with we have to approach the Adivasi cultures in our own society with an attitude of brotherhood and one of shared wonder at the palpable presence of the incomprehensible incessantly unfolding around us. We have earlier talked about the impossibility of treating Adivasi communities as closed systems. Even if for theoretical purposes, such an approach may yield some guidelines, such guidelines have to subserve the needs and challenges of a changing reality. Respecting the innate creative genius of the Adivasi people, just as we respect our own, we are seeing them as living in a commonality with us. We see our fates inexorably linked together, and the new artistic ethos can only be born if this commonality is realised. References and Notes 1.
