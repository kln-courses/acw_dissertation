<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EVOLUTION OF PARENTAL CARE. T. H. Clutton-Brock. 1991. Princeton Univer- sity Press, Princeton, New Jersey. ISBN 0-691- 02516-9. 352 p., $49.50 (hardcover), $19.95 (softcover).-Despite its critical importance in evolutionary biology and animal behavior, pa- rental care has been surprisingly little studied. T. H. Clutton-Brock, best known for his exten- sive studies of the reproductive biology of red deer, attempts to rectify this omission by pro- viding both a review of the literature on paren- tal care patterns in a variety of taxa and a critical evaluation of the theory devoted to explaining those patterns. We used the book in a graduate seminar including members ranging from first- year master's and Ph.D. students to postdocs and faculty. The following represents a synthe- sis of opinions formed during the course. The book focuses on five questions about the evolution of parental care: (1) What are the principal benefits and costs of parental care? (2) Why does the extent of parental care vary so widely between species? (3) Why do only females care for eggs and young in some animals, only males in others, and both parents in a few? (4) To what extent is parental care adjusted to vari- ation in its benefits to offspring and its costs to parents? (5) How do parents divide their ex- penditure between their sons and daughters? The success with which these questions are an- swered varies, with the last two perhaps most successfully addressed. Ichthyologists and her- petologists may be disappointed in the dearth of examples using reptiles, amphibians, and fish, despite the prevalence of parental care in at least the latter two groups. A survey of the tax- onomic index reveals that, of the 456 species cited, only 52 (11.4%) were of fish, amphibians, or reptiles; this bias is probably understandable, given Clutton-Brock's extensive experience with mammals, but it is nonetheless a shortcoming. Chapters 1 and 2 define relevant terms and give a brief overview of the types of parental care given by various taxa. Parental investment is placed in the context of sexual selection the- ory, but sexual selection itself is not discussed, an omission which presages one of the difficul- ties several of the less advanced members of the seminar had with the book as a whole: crucial theoretical background is alluded to, but the reader is assumed to have this background, an assumption often unfounded with our not un- representative group of readers. For example, "ESS" is never spelled out as evolutionarily sta- ble strategy, and a model of brood reduction is</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 595 similarly discussed without having been de- fined. Because most functional arguments for the evolution of parental care assume that caring for offspring reduces the fitness of parents, eval- uating and measuring those costs is crucial. Chapter 3 examines the evidence for costs of breeding or costs of reproduction, categorizing this evidence as either phenotypic correlation, experimental manipulation, or genetic corre- lation. Clutton-Brock concludes that, although each method has limitations, each offers im- portant insights, thus disagreeing with those ad- vocating a reliance on genetic correlations. Chapter 4 discusses propagule size and devel- opmental time, including numerous examples from reptiles, amphibians, and fishes, but com- ing to the rather facile conclusion that theory outstrips data on virtually all points. A contin- ued theme throughout the book is the need for more detailed measurements of costs and ben- efits, as well as more investigation of physiolog- ical constraints on parameters such as egg size. Chapters 5 and 6 address viviparity, incuba- tion, gestation, and lactation. The first of these, on viviparity, is of most interest to Copeia read- ers, but some members of our group found it disappointing, with a catalog of examples lack- ing a theoretical framework, particularly for ec- totherms. These chapters use the division be- tween endotherms and ectotherms that is formalized in the next two chapters; Chapter 7 deals with patterns of parental care in ecto- therms (though invertebrates are given short shrift) and Chapter 8 with these patterns in birds and mammals. The discussion of male vs female parental care in fishes is excellent, causing some of us to wonder whether this group deserved its own chapter, with the endotherm/ecto- therm dichotomy being an artificial one. Per- haps a better distinction might have been that between internal and external fertilization. The section on amphibians is not as detailed as that on fish, despite a higher proportion of families with parental care (71% vs 21%). The brief sec- tion on reptiles has one important deficiency. Whereas parental care in squamates is mainly limited to viviparity, all crocodilians show some form of parental care, including egg guarding, carrying young, and releasing the hatchlings from the nest, a system similar to that of mega- pode birds. Given the close relationship be- tween birds, crocodilians, and the Archosauria (for which parental care has also been suggest- ed), a discussion of the evolutionary origin of parental care in vertebrates based on phyloge- netic relationships would have been extremely valuable. Chapter 8 describes the many different pa- rental care patterns in birds and mammals, do- ing an excellent job of synthesizing the litera- ture. The last half of the chapter, however, is oddly male biased, containing lengthy discus- sions of why males help, why they do not always do so, why they are sometimes the only care- giver, and why they "agree" to polyandry (quo- tation marks ours), with an implicit assumption that males make the decisions and females abide by them. The female members of the seminar particularly took exception to this viewpoint, and the language is occasionally unnecessarily anthropomorphic and sexist as well. Chapters 9 and 10, on parental care in rela- tion to benefits and costs, are a watershed in the book; for the first time, our discussions cen- tered on the material presented and not on the manner of presentation. Both sequentially build a better understanding of the complicated na- ture of the costs and benefits of care, and how it is expected to vary with brood size, parental age, resource availability, and other parame- ters. Theory is well integrated with empirical evidence, although again birds and mammals receive a disproportionate amount of attention. Chapters 11 and 12, on parent-offspring con- flict and differential investment in sons and daughters, are likewise good syntheses, but the tone is sometimes alarmingly pessimistic. For example, reliable estimates of parent-offspring conflict should, Clutton-Brock suggests, be based on measures of optimal levels of investment, but these measures seem all but unobtainable. Re- peated conclusions such as this one left newer evolutionary biologists skeptical about the probability of successful research in the field. The scarcity of reptile and fish examples is un- derstandable here, given the short duration of care in these groups, but is less so in Chapter 13, on sex ratio variation, which could have included more discussion of environmental sex determination and the role of parental manip- ulation. In the concluding chapter, Clutton-Brock re- turns to the questions posed at the outset, and suggests that, although the answers remain elu- sive, this is the result of insufficient data. Ques- tions about adjustment of parental care accord- ing to its benefits and costs, and about parental investment in sons and daughters, are answered more completely than the rest, but the chapter</page><page sequence="3">596 COPEIA, 1992, NO. 2 itself is well organized, and it summarizes the book very well. Taken as a whole, the volume provides an excellent introduction to the literature (and the references are impressively up to date), with suggestions for further research that seemed inspiring to those entering similar fields. Al- though the line drawings are beautifully exe- cuted (many by Dafila Scott), the figures in the book are often taken wholesale from the pub- lication in which they appeared, with subse- quent loss of clarity because of the lack of con- text. Arguments over the intended meaning of an equation or axis label were, therefore, often unresolved. Typographical errors are few, and the book is quite readable. For use in a graduate seminar (with suitable supplementation from more general sources), or as a resource on the shelf of most behavioral ecologists, the book is highly recommended.
