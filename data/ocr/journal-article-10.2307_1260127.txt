<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Queer Minstrel and the Beasts ANN M. TAYLOR T HE Queer Minstrel', a brief tale from the Grimm collection (no. 8), presents some critical difficulty.' It is the story of a lonely minstrel who attracts four companions-a wolf, a fox, a hare, and a woodcutter- with his fiddling. As each of the animals approaches, he feels an immediate antagonism which is intensified when they request music lessons from him. His reaction is violent; rather than teach them, he cruelly tricks them one by one into traps. In sharp contrast is his immediate welcome of the wood- cutter who listens in ecstasy to his playing. For him he fiddles happily, even as this listener drives away the liberated and outraged beasts who have come to take revenge. At the end of the tale, he plays a final song of thanksgiving for the woodcutter and resumes his journey. At first, this tale seems but a portion of a larger story in which the motivations for the minstrel's 'queer' behaviour would be more fully explained; Walter A. Berendsohn describes the tale as a fragment which lacks internal meaning and the Bolte-Polivka note suggests that the minstrel's cruel treatment of the animals needs accounting for.2 It seems to me, however, that the motivation is apparent in the tale-as the minstrel himself says, 'I was looking for a human being, not for wild animals' (p. 35).3 With this in mind, 'The Queer Minstrel' may be read as a dramatization of this preference, an intentional polarization of the minstrel and the woodcutter on the one hand, with the wolf, the fox, and the hare on the other, for the purpose of emphasizing the superiority of the men over the beasts. The tale calls attention, for example, to the superior self-control of both the minstrel and the woodcutter. Although lonely and actually seeking com- panionship, the minstrel is patient enough to wait for a 'good companion' (p. 33), not just company.4 He rejects the first three listeners who respond to his summons, even though their appearance is immediate and their comments flattering; each one says, '... how fine you fiddle!' (pp. 33, 34).5 He is an Orpheus who prefers not to play for beasts, no matter how desolate he may feel or how eager the audience. He summons one companion after another, waiting until the 'right' (p. 35) companion, in the person of the woodcutter, arrives at last.6 The woodcutter too is more controlled and patient than the beasts. He quietly listens to the music, having no desire to take over the fiddler's occupation, nor does he attempt to kill the animals when they come for revenge. He simply frightens them back into the woods. The animals, on the other hand, are portrayed as lacking in self-control. Even though they have acquired human speech, they retain their animal</page><page sequence="2">180 ANN M. TAYLOR drives: they take no time at all to listen to the music, but instead immediately demand lessons for themselves. When they regain their freedom, they rush to kill the fiddler, a desire they would fulfil if not for the woodcutter's pro- tection. The men are presented as admirably restrained, the animals as rudely aggressive.7 The men are also shown as more intelligent than the beasts; most of the tale is devoted to the fiddler's clever duping of the gullible animals. In three parallel scenes, he tricks the wolf into wedging his paw in the cleft of a tree, the fox into swinging high above the ground in a snare, and the hare into choking himself with a noose that tightens every time he tries to escape- all under the guise of fiddle lessons. The beasts are not wise enough for the wily minstrel. Obviously ignorant of the source for melody, they fall easily into the most primitive of traps.8 The men are also superior in their creation and manipulation of instruments; in this tale, only they are in- genious enough to manage such tools for their trades as the fiddle and the axe, resourceful enough to adapt their environment to their will-as the minstrel does when he devises makeshift traps for the animals and as the woodcutter does when he turns his chopping axe temporarily into a weapon against them. No tools used by the beasts are mentioned in the tale other than the wolf's teeth with which he gnaws himself, and the other animals, free. Unable to modify their environment as the men do, they are forced to flee when confronted with the woodcutter's superior weapon. Brutishness does not compete with human intelligence here. That brutishness also does not experience a truly aesthetic pleasure is another aspect of the inferiority of the animals emphasized in the tale. The fiddler's music is seductive to both the beasts and the woodcutter, but only the latter is sensitive enough to pause and listen appreciatively, '... the poor man stood as if in a trance, and his heart rejoiced' (p. 35).9 For the human beings in the tale, the artistic experience is mutually satisfying: the fiddler is cheered by his admiring listening audience and the woodcutter is re- freshed for his own continued labour in the forest. They understand the place of art in their lives. The animals, on the other hand, are not an inspired or inspiring audience; unlike the woodcutter, they do not show visible signs of appreciation beyond their brief compliment, nor do they request more music-only lessons for themselves. The minstrel apparently does not see their rush for instruction as true appreciation, but rather as emulation, a desire to acquire the human skills for which he does not believe them equipped, spiritually or physically. This is the lesson he forces upon them by treating them as beasts; he sets traps, because to him, they are simply 'wild animals' (p. 35), not even fit to hear, let alone study, his art.' Thus the tale emphasizes the polarization between the human and the bestial worlds and implies reasons for this separation. The men share a sym- pathy for one another that is not matched by the beasts either in their rela- tionship with the men or with one another-a fact which the minstrel anti- cipates even as his listeners approach him. The men are capable of binding together for enjoyment and protection, while the animals unite only for revenge. Their alliance is an inferior version of the more lofty sharing</page><page sequence="3">THE QUEER MINSTREL AND THE BEASTS 181 between the two men. No matter how anthropomorphic the beasts may be, the minstrel does not allow them to become 'schoolboys' (pp. 33, 34), for they are not yet worthy of the brotherhood of men."I Lacking the self-con- trol, intelligence, and aesthetic sensibility of the humans in the tale, they come to see man as a 'common enemy' (p. 34), and, as a result, recognize their own brotherhood, escaping to their natural habitat-the forest.'2 This is not the world of those fables where the distinctions between man and beast may easily disappear, for the men in the tale assume the dichotomy between the two and actively maintain it.'3 It may even be described as an 'anti-fable', for the narrator himself labels the arrival of the woodcutter as 'better luck' (p. 35) for the fiddler, an authorial alliance with the human beings in the tale and still another reminder of the point of view being pre- sented there.'4 By comparing this tale to others closely associated with it, the particular interests of 'The Queer Minstrel' become even more apparent. Although it shares many characteristics with its analogues-the clever trickster, the trapping of gullible animals (frequently by catching their paws in some form of vice), the vain pursuit by the freed beasts, and the final victory of the hero-it emphasizes the differences between man and beast while the other tales do not.'" There the relative value of human over animal companionship is not a matter of concern at all, because the heroes are neither lonely nor are they seeking companionship. They usually work alone, tricking the ani- mals not because they prefer to associate with human beings, but either because they merely enjoy the challenge or because they must remove an obstruction to a reward-money or a princess, for example. Often the hero is not primarily a musician at all, but may be a knifegrinder, a tailor, a soldier, or a merchant, so the artist's preference for a certain type of audience is absent. And even in the tales where the hero is a musician, the motive for playing is not to attract an appropriate listener, but to distract the animal, as Mercury did Argus. If the animals are frightened by weapons at the end of the tale, they are usually wielded by the hero himself, not by a loyal human ally. But 'The Queer Minstrel' combines elements in such a way as to call attention to the comparative worthiness or unworthiness of companions for the fiddler and to the reasons for his selection. It intentionally opposes the deficiencies of the beasts with the virtues of the men and highlights the alliances-man with man, beast with beast. Thematically, this tale shares little with its analogues, for the relationships among the characters are not the source of their meaning. 'The Queer Minstrel', however, derives its meaning from these relation- ships, its very sparseness setting the nuances of behaviour-human and ani- mal-into high relief. The fiddler's immediate rejection of the first three listeners who respond to his musical summons and his ready acceptance of the woodcutter may at first seem 'wunderliche' (queer, eccentric, odd), but, given the events of the tale, it does not appear so queer after all. The minstrel's seemingly capricious judgment proves to be a correct evaluation of the relative worth of the two audiences and, by the end of the tale, we too understand why he prefers one woodcutter to three beasts. Read in this</page><page sequence="4">182 ANN M. TAYLOR way, the tale does seem to have an internal logic which would allow us to see it as complete as it stands. NOTES 1.

If, as Bruno Bettelheim says of beasts in fairy tales, 'Both dangerous and helpful animals stand for our animal nature, our instinctual drives', the fiddler may also be seen as rejecting the beast within himself in favour of the higher faculties of patience and self- control which are signs of his own maturity. See Bruno Bettelheim, The Uses ofEnchantment (New York: Random House, 1975), p. 76. 8. That 'The Queer Minstrel' intentionally emphasizes the unworthiness of the beasts may be seen in contrast to another Grimm tale, 'The Two Brothers' (no. 60), where these same animals join the brothers as allies and help them to succeed. The animals of 'The Queer Minstrel' are also more foolish than the bear of Grimm no. 114, 'The Clever Little Tailor', for he has a better excuse for putting his paw into a vice; he has been told that this is the way to cut his fingernails for better fiddling. The wolf, the fox, and the hare do not require such a clever ruse. 9. '... daft der arme Mann wie bezaubert dastand und ihm das Herz vor Freude aufging', p. 42. 10. See footnote three for German reference. Animals frequently do play musical instru- ments in folk tales; see Stith Thompson, Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, rev. edition (Copenhagen: Rosenkilde and Bagger, 1955), Vol. I, 'Musical Animals', Type B297. In Grimm no. 144, for example, a donkey plays the lute and in no. 106, a feline orchestra entertains a miller's servant. The animals in 'The Queer Minstrel' are intentionally halted in their efforts to become more human through music. 11. 'Ich will dir gehorchen, wie ein Schuler seinem Meister', pp. 40-1. 12. '... und dann suchten alle zusammem ihren Feind auf', p. 42. 13. In this sense, 'The Queer Minstrel' may be placed with Thompson's motifJ512 under 'Prudence and Discretion' which teaches that an 'animal should not try to change his nature' and, on a larger scale, with those motifs which identify such characteristics of human culture as the use of metal (A 1432), the fashioning of weapons (A 1459.1), the establishment of social relationships (A1470), the distribution of work (A1440.2), the division of labour (A1472), the acquisition of music (A1461), the development of wisdom (A1481), and the domination of the beasts (A1421.1). 'The Queer Minstrel' indirectly calls attention to these character- istics as distinctly human. 14. '... und diesmal war er gluklicher gewesen', p. 42. 15.
