<plain_text><page sequence="1">INKA SACRIFICE AND THE MUMMY OF SALINAS GRANDES Thomas Besom In the last 25 years, materials from some human sacrifices that the Inkas carried out on high mountains (e.g., Aconcagua and Llullaillaco) have been thoroughly analyzed and adequately interpreted. Remains from immolations that took place in other contexts, however, which tend to be poorly preserved and incompletely studied, are not as well understood. In this article, I begin to remedy this imbalance in our knowledge by discussing the sacrifice from Salinas Grandes, which is a salt flat situated in northwestern Argentina. I describe the body of the victim?who was very likely a qhapaq hucha, a specially chosen child?and his clothing, accouterments, and hairstyle. I offer hypotheses on where he came from and on the reasons behind his ritual dispatch. I demonstrate how the different items that were buried with him all contributed to the meaning of his immolation. I also show how the lords ofCuzco may have employed the sacrifice to tie the region where the salt flat is located to the empire. En los ultimos veinticinco ahos diversos materiales procedentes de algunos sacrificios humanos que los incas llevaron a cabo en las altas montanas (por ejemplo, Aconcagua y Llullaillaco) han sido rigurosamente estudiados y adecuadamente inter pretados. Sin embargo, los restos de inmolaciones que tuvieron lugaren otros contextos, que tienden a estarpobremente preser vados y a haber sido estudiados de manera incompleta, no son tan bien comprendidos. En este artwulo comienzo a reparar este desequilibrio en nuestro conocimiento a troves de discutir el sacrificio de Salinas Grandes, un salar situado en el noroeste de Argentina. Para ello describo el cuerpo de la vktima?probablemente un qhapaq hucha, o niho elegido especialmente?y sus vestiduras, ajuar, y peinado. Propongo varias hipotesis acerca de su procedencia y acerca de las razones detrds de su sac rificio ritual. Demuestro como los diferentes elementos quefueron enterrados junto a el contribuyeron a dar sentido a su inmo lacion y tambien muestro como los sehores del Cuzco podrian haber empleado este sacrificio para vincular a su imperio la region en que se localiza el salar. Inka Sacrifice Over the past 25 years, archaeologists have made spectacular discoveries on peaks in the southern Andes (Figure 1). In 1995, Johan Reinhard recov ered the body of a 14-year-old female who had been sacrificed by the Inkas on Ampato Volcano in Peru. This body was nicknamed "Juanita" by the press (Ceruti 2003:38-39; Reinhard 2005:1-55; see also Reinhard 1996). Four years later, Reinhard and his archaeological team excavated the perfectly preserved remains of three victims?a boy, a girl, and a young woman?on Llullaillaco Volcano in Argentina (Ceruti 2003; Reinhard 1999, 2005:279-342; Reinhard and Ceruti 2000). His finds attracted worldwide attention: numerous books and articles were written about them; they were the subjects of museum exhibits, television documentaries, and even late-night talk show jokes. Some Andean scholars believe that the high altitude immolations were the norm in the Inka Empire (Fernandez 1997:157,161-162), which at the height of its power in the early sixteenth cen tury stretched down the spine of South America from Ecuador to central Chile (Rowe 1946:Map 4; Figure 1). They are wrong, however: most victims were not ritually dispatched by the Cuzquefios on lofty summits. Rather, they were put to death in other contexts, including in the vicinity of a salt flat called Salinas Grandes that is situated in north western Argentina (Figure 1). The victim at Sali nas Grandes was a boy, whose body and grave goods will be described in detail. I also will dis cuss the site and region where he was sacrificed and will consider the following questions: What type of immolation does he exemplify?

How might the Inkas have used his ritual dispatch to unify the polity's south eastern quarter? Ethnohistoric Data on Human Sacrifice According to ethnohistoric sources?Spanish and indigenous authors from the 1500s and 1600s?the Cuzquenos practiced at least five types of human sacrifice (Besom 2009a:44). They ritually slew runas, able-bodied adult males (Besom 2009a:44-49); they immolated captured warriors (Besom 2009a:49-55); they performed necropampa rites, which involved burying victims with a dead ruler (Besom 2009a:55-62); and they carried out "substitute" sacrifices, which entailed offering one person's life so that another individ ual who was dying might live (Besom 2009a:62-63). The final and perhaps most notable type of immolation in the state involved qhapaq huchas (more commonly written "capacochas" or "Capac Cochas" [Besom 2009a:25^3]).1 The qhapaq huchas were boys, girls, and young women who were specially selected by an imper ial official. Chosen for their good looks, they could have no freckles, warts, or other blemishes on their bodies, and had to be virgins (Cobo 1979:235-238 [1653], 1990:111-113 [1653]). They were taken to Cuzco (Figure 1), the capital, where a large festi val was held for them, after which they were dis tributed to the principal waqas, anything thought to be imbued with sacred power, for ritual dispatch. The waqas honored with human lives included not only high peaks (Figure 2) but hills, islands, rocks, rivers, springs, lakes, caves, and other features of the landscape (Besom 2009a:28-33). Some qhapaq huchas did not have to walk far to reach their destinations, as there were numerous shrines and sacred sites in and around Cuzco that received offerings of children. Other victims, how ever, had to journey thousands of kilometers, so it would have taken them months to get to their respective waqas. Upon their arrival, they were met by state bureaucrats called waqa kamayuqs, and they took part in festivals patterned after the one held in the capital. A number of methods were used for their actual sacrifices: suffocation; strangula tion, sometimes with a cord; blows to the head or neck; drowning; cutting out the heart; and slitting the throat. Many qhapaq huchas were buried alive. This form of immolation was carried out by exca vating a deep shaft with a flat surface at the bot tom. The victim was given chicha (corn beer) to drink and/or coca leaves to chew, was lowered into the hole, and was made to sit upright. Offerings were placed around him or her, and the shaft was filled with earth (Besom 2009a:33-35). The Spanish and native authors maintain that a variety of items were interred with the children and young women. They included gold and silver stat uettes in the form of people and camelids; fine cloth woven from wool and cotton; beer made from spe cially chosen ears of corn; brightly colored feath ers; bags of coca leaves; mullu, Spondylus shell; maize of different hues; and miniature clothing. Some goods that were buried with the qhapaq huchas were gender specific. Young women were entombed with tupus, pins of precious metals, and spoons. Also interred with them were vessels fash ioned from gold, silver, wood, and ceramics, often diminutive in size. Males (though not necessarily boys) were left with headbands, medallions, and q 'ipis, bundles used to carry things on the back like a pack (Besom 2009a:31-32). The ethnohistoric authors give many reasons for why the lords of Cuzco immolated qhapaq huchas. Among the explanations was to placate significant gods and major waqas in the empire. A number of sacred shrines served oracular functions, so whenever the Inkas asked for advice on impor tant matters, they dispatched children. Infants and young women were put to death during crucial periods in the king's life: when he ascended the throne, became ill, went to war, married, had a son by the queen, and died. Bernabe Cobo (1990:112 [1653]), a Jesuit priest, states that some sacrifices were carried out on a cyclical basis while others were associated with extraordinary events. Among the former were the numerous immolations that took place during the yearly festival of Qhapaq Raymi, while the latter included those that were car ried out in times of great need, such as when there was famine, pestilence, or war (Besom 2009a: 35-36). The institution of the qhapaq hucha was closely tied to the Inka economy. It was connected with the flow of water in a region, with fertility, and with good weather, all of which were vital for agricul ture. Likewise it was linked to success in special ized production and to the completion of significant state projects (Besom 2009a:36-38).</page><page sequence="4">402 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 4, 2010 Figure 2. The people of Kunti Suyu offering a child and guinea pig to Coropuna, a notable mountain waqa (Guaman Poma 1980:1:246 [1615]). The sacrifice of children and young women was related to the social structure and the political orga nization of the polity. It was concerned with terri torial boundaries, with sight lines, and with the establishment of a network of sacred shrines throughout the empire. Qhapaq hucha immolation also was concerned with power: it made explicit the asymmetrical relationship that existed between Cuzco, the center of political and religious author ity in the state, and the hinterlands (Besom 2009a:38^0). Material Correlates o/Qhapaq Hucha Sacrifice There are various features of qhapaq hucha immo lation as characterized by the ethnohistoric sources that would allow us to identify a victim's remains in the archaeological record. For instance, there is age. Boys would tend to be between four and 10. Then there is costume: given that males were brought together in Cuzco from throughout the realm and were redistributed to the provinces, they often ended up being dispatched in foreign lands. Since a victim would likely dress in his native gar</page><page sequence="5">Besom] INKA SACRIFICE AND THE MUMMY OF SALINAS GRANDES 403 merits, they would contrast with the clothes worn by the inhabitants of the region where his sacrifice took place (Besom 2009a:40-42). To prove that a corpse was affiliated with a qha paq hucha immolation, we would have to demon strate that the individual had been intentionally dispatched. Assuming that the body was well pre served, the cause of death could be determined by a medical examination of it. If a victim was stran gled by hand, then the hyoid bone or the thyroid cartilage might be fractured. Similarly, if he was killed with a ligature, he may have a broken hyoid or, more frequently, a fragmented thyroid; the use of a cord can leave a mark, which can vary from prominent to subtle. A boy who was sacrificed with a blow to the head could have a linear, a diastatic, a depressed, or a stellate fracture of the skull. It would be relatively simple to verify that a qhapaq hucha's throat was cut or that his heart was removed, and a victim who was buried alive would have no signs of trauma to his body (Besom 2009a:42). Are there additional material correlates of qha paq hucha immolation? Supposedly a child who was ritually slain could have no spots or other imperfections on his body. In the ethnohistoric lit erature it says that a boy who was to be sacrificed might be feasted in Cuzco and in a provincial cap ital, which often entailed drinking corn beer and/or chewing coca leaves. If the chicha and coca were consumed at least 10 days before the victim's death, we would find traces of cocaethylene, a cocaine/alcohol metabolite, or benzoylecgonine, a metabolic product of cocaine, in the hair (Besom 2009a:43). A male qhapaq hucha would be carefully entombed in a pit or at the bottom of a deep shaft. He would be seated, and around him would be placed (or he would wear) various offerings, which could include items of Spondylus, a llawfu (head band), a medallion, and a bracelet (Besom 2009a:42-43). Minimally a qhapaq hucha sacrifice in the archaeological record would consist of a child's remains (or those of a young woman) along with anthropomorphic and/or zoomorphic statuettes. According to the ethnohistoric documents, such statuettes?which were fashioned from gold, sil ver, copper, or Spondylus?made important offer ings for notable waqas (Besom 2009a:31, 95, 99-100, 102, 2009b:332). They are always found in ritual contexts, both with the bodies of victims and alone (Besom 2009b:225,332-333). As far as I can determine, they never have been discovered in ordinary graves and are thus a hallmark of Inka immolation (Besom 2009b:333). Gaither and her colleagues (2008:108, 113, 115-116) have identified an Andean mortuary prin ciple that they refer to as "like with like," which involved leaving objects in a burial that in some way mirrored, either literally or metaphorically, the deceased. When the lords of Cuzco interred anthro pomorphic or zoomorphic figurines with qhapaq huchas, they followed this principle: they deposited feminine statuettes with girls and young women (Ceruti 2003:76-77; Linares 1966:Figuras 10-12; Reinhard 1996:66, 73, 76-77, 81, 1999:44, 46; Reinhard and Ceruti 2000:60-61, 98-101) and masculine figurines with boys (Besom 2009b:333; see also Ceruti 2003:73; Reinhard 1996:74-75, 1997:42-43,1999:38-39,44; Reinhard and Ceruti 2000:58, 94; Schobinger 1995:Figura 9; Schob inger et al. 1985:175-186, 2001:Figuras 1, 8-9).2 Likewise they placed statuettes representing camelids exclusively with boys (Besom 2009b:266; see also Mostny 1957:46/m, Lamina 12/Foto b; Reinhard 1999:38-39, 44; Reinhard and Ceruti 2000:58, 94; Schobinger et al. 1985:186-189, 2001:Figuras 1,10-11), perhaps because in Andean society it is usually the males who herd and who are in charge of the llama caravans.3 When burying human figurines with qhapaq huchas, the Inkas followed Gaither's mortuary prin ciple in another way; both the female statuettes and female victims were usually dressed like aqlla kuna, "chosen women." These virgins served the imperial gods and state (Besom 2009b:339-341, 348-351). Similarly, the male figurines and male victims were clothed like high-status nobles?the type of people who filled the ranks of the imperial bureaucracy (Besom 2009b:341-351). I will return to this idea toward the end of the article. Relative Infrequency of Mountain Sacrifices Rodrigo Hernandez Principe was a Spanish extir pator who worked in the north-central sierra of Peru. In a document from 1622, he records that the Inkas compelled various groups in the region to send their children to hallowed spots throughout the polity for immolation. At least six children met</page><page sequence="6">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 4, 2010 their ends at lakes, mostly at Lake Titicaca (Hernan dez 1923:28, 41 [1622]; Figure 1). On the other hand, only one individual was offered up on a high peak (Hernandez 1923:62 [1622]). Polo de Ondegardo, a judicial/administrative official who served the Spanish Crown during the 1550s, provides a list of venerated sites, shrines, and objects around Cuzco. Of the subset of these waqas that received qhapaq huchas, around 40 per cent were mountains and hills. This figure may be inflated, though: many of the waqas near the cap ital consisted of sacred stones situated on summits; in such instances it is not clear whether the sum mits were revered along with the stones (Cobo 1990:51-84 [1653]; Polo 1917 [1571]). Regardless, the point is that most sacrifices were not connected with peaks. Archaeological Information on the Qhapaq Huchas In what contexts other than on mountaintops (Fig ure 1) have qhapaq hucha immolations been found? In 1892, the skeletons of a pair of females? together with six feminine statuettes, six tupus, 12 ceramic vessels, one gold bowl, and one ceremo nial ax made of basalt?were recovered from La Plata, an island off the Ecuadorian coast (Dorsey 1901). The skeletons were undoubtedly those of young women who were dispatched by the Inkas (Bray et al. 2005:90; McEwan and Silva 1989:177-183; McEwan and Van de Guchte 1992:362-363). During the 2004 field season, Gibaja, McEwan, and Andrushko carried out exca vations at the site of Chokepukio near Cuzco. They discovered the remains of seven children, who were between three and 11 years old and who had been interred as a group along with numerous artifacts. The individuals were tightly wrapped in textiles and bound with rope, and were likely qhapaq huchas (Andrushko 2007:68; Gibaja et al. 2005). Although the remains of numerous sacrificial victims have been found in Chile, they have not always been recognized as such. In 1994, the jum bled bones of no fewer than three victims, repre senting at least one male and one female, were disinterred on Guacolda, an islet near the country's central coast. With the osteological materials were an unknown number of anthropomorphic and llama figurines?made of copper, Spondylus, and gold? most of which were taken by looters. There also were a silver tupu, 25 malachite and turquoise beads, fine ceramics, and two gold head ornaments, one of them executed in miniature (Zambra 1994). East of Guacolda is the village of Freirina, where there was once a significant waqa (Medina 1952: 367, 369, 398-399,402) and where a man named Rafael Garrido dug up at least one set, and possi bly many more, of human remains (Medina 1952:392, 423/No. 70, 427/No. 160). Each set probably represented an immolation. Based on the principle of "like with like," we know that the one burial that Garrido definitely excavated belonged to a male: the victim was left with a masculine stat uette made of Spondylus (Medina 1952:392-393). Garrido unearthed additional items associated with male qhapaq huchas?a masculine figurine (of gold), camelid statuettes (of gold, silver, copper, and Spondylus), and more tentatively, a star-headed mace (of stone) and a pipe (also of stone [Medina 1952:401^03,423/No. 68,424/No. 86,425/Nos. 108-110,112,426/Nos. 137,141,Laminas68,86, 108-110, 112, 137, 141]), as well as objects usu ally left with female victims. The latter included feminine figurines (of gold and silver), a tiny pin, jewelry, a stone box containing pigment, and minia ture vessels, some made in a provincial Inka style and others in an imperial style (Medina 1952:360, 362-363, 367, 369-370, 398-401, 425/Nos. 103, 114, 116, 426/Nos. 134-136, 429/Nos. 177-178, 430/No. 210, Laminas 103, 114, 116, 134-136, 160,177-178,210). Northeast of the city of La Se rena is a coastal hill called Los Puntiudos. On the slope of this hill was a rectangular platform, around which were scattered as many as seven burials dat ing to the late Horizon. Much of the material recov ered from the tombs was affiliated with female qhapaq huchas: 36 discoidal beads of silver, two feminine statuettes made of silver and another pair carved from Spondylus, two gold tupus, and two silver ones. There were items connected with male victims too, including a pair of masculine figurines (one of gold, the other of shell) and three camelid statuettes (one of gold, the others of Spondylus [Iribarren 1962:65-70/Secci6n VII, Ilustraciones XVIII-XX]).4 Why the Apparent Prevalence of Mountain Immolations? If sacrifices on high peaks were less common than those from other contexts, then why have more of the former been found during the last quarter cen</page><page sequence="7">Besom] INKA SACRIFICE AND THE MUMMY OF SALINAS GRANDES 405 tury? Since 1985, the corpses of 19 victims have been discovered on summits in southern Peru and northwestern Argentina (Beorchia 1985; Ceruti 2003; Reinhard 2005; Schobinger 2001). During the same period, as far as I can determine, the remains of only a handful of qhapaq huchas have been recovered from nonmountain sites (Bray et al. 2005:87-88; see also Andrushko 2007; Gibaja et al. 2005; Olsen 1994:340; Zambra 1994). There are several explanations for this discrepancy, one of which relates to preservation. The conditions that often exist within high-altitude crypts? constant and low temperatures and a high relative humidity?are optimal for conserving organic materials (Reinhard 2005:87-88), including flesh, textiles, etc. The three bodies excavated at 6,700 m on Llullaillaco were so well preserved that they still had blood frozen in their veins (Reinhard 2005:320). On the other hand, the conditions at coastal sites in Ecuador and central Chile, where both temperatures and the relative humidity tend to be high, are perfect for promoting decay. The skeletons dug up on La Plata were deteriorated and fragmentary, and no part of them could be saved (Dorsey 1901:255); not a trace remained of any tex tiles. There is another reason why qhapaq hucha remains are now unearthed more frequently on peaks than in other contexts. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Spanish priests waged a brutal campaign to wipe out the "idolatrous" prac tices of Andean peoples, including the veneration of sacrificial victims. As part of this campaign, the priests systematically searched for and destroyed the tombs of qhapaq huchas (Reinhard 1985:302; see also Albornoz 1967 [1583?]; Hernandez 1923 [1622]). Since the low-altitude sites were more accessible to them than the high ones, they were able to wreck more of the former. Treasure hunters have taken their toll on the graves of victims too (Reinhard 1985:302-303). Modern looters, like the priests, have generally found that tombs situated on islands, in caves, or by lakes are easier to plunder than those on lofty summits; the site on Guacolda Island was badly pil fered (Zambra 1994). I do not mean to imply that mountain sites have escaped the ravages of treasure hunters. When Reinhard and his crew excavated the body of a young woman on a peak called Quehuar in 1999 (Figure 1), they discovered that the head and upper torso had been blown to pieces. Pillagers had used dynamite to extract the mummy (Ceruti 2003:42^13; Reinhard 2005:257-277). Although both high- and low-altitude sites have seen the effects of looters, a larger percentage of the latter have been destroyed. Salinas Grandes The Archaeological Site The mummy of Salinas Grandes was disinterred in 1903 from somewhere around the salt flat (Figures 3-4), which covers about 220 km2, has the shape of a crescent moon, is split between the Argentine provinces of Jujuy and Salta (Fernandez 1997:158-159), and is located at 3,350 m asl. The salt there is between 10 and 50 cm thick (Boman 1918:96). Near the crescent's southern horn are twin hills, which rise about 470 m above the salt flat and which together bear the name "Dead Child." Based on this toponymic evidence, Fer nandez (1997:159,162) hypothesizes that the qha paq hucha was buried on one of them. The site where the child was interred did not exist in isolation but was closely tied to the Inka infrastructure in the region (Figure 3). The Cuzquenos established a north-south road that may have split into two branches, one of which skirted the western margin of Salinas Grandes, while the other wound around the eastern edge. The grave was most likely situated just off the western artery. The two branches would have joined to the north of Salinas Grandes at a site called Rinconadillas, which was a tampu, a way station where imperial administrators who were traveling along the royal roads could stay. At a tampu, food and other mate rials that were considered vital to the state were often stored. Another Inka site, Puesto Calvario, also a tampu, was positioned on the hypothetical western artery about 50 km south of the boy's prob able burial spot. A third way station, El Moreno, was located along the eastern branch of the road, separated from the grave by the great expanse of salt (Acuto 1996-1998; Fernandez 1997:157, 162-163,Mapas l-2;Raffino 1981:229-232; Raf fino et al. 1978:101). It is likely that the child lodged at one of these tampus while making his way to the waqa for sacrifice.</page><page sequence="8">406 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 4, 2010 Figure 3. Satellite photograph of Salinas Grandes and the surrounding region, with the locations of modern towns and Inka sites: (1) Cobres; (2) Dead Child Hill; (3) Rinconadillas; (4) El Moreno; (5) Mount Chani; (6) San Antonio de los Cobres; and (7) Puesto Calvario (courtesy of Google Maps). There is yet another Inka site in the region that may be related to the one at Salinas Grandes. It con sists of over a dozen platforms and terraces that were constructed by the Cuzquenos near the 5,896 m-high summit of Chani (Figures 1, 3^-). When Reinhard and Ceruti carried out salvage excavations at this site in 2000, they found a dense scatter of materials across it, from which they concluded that large numbers of people had taken part in ritual activities there. The peak may have been the focus of a major pilgrimage (Beorchia 1985:67-70; Bray et al. 2005:88-89; Ceruti 2001,2003:32-33; Rein hard 2005:339-340). In 1905, Coronel E. Perez was excavating a plat form just below the summit when he discovered the body of a qhapaq hucha. The victim, a child of</page><page sequence="9">Besom] INKA SACRIFICE AND THE MUMMY OF SALINAS GRANDES 407 Figure 4. Photograph of Salinas Grandes with Mount Chani in the background (the snowcapped peak). about five, was buried with a tunic, two ponchos, a pair of textile bands, a cloth bag that was deco rated with feathers and full of coca leaves, two pairs of sandals, a pyro-engraved box made from a hol low reed, a ceramic disk, and a wooden comb (Beorchia 1985:70; Ceruti 2003:32-33; Millan 1966:2-3; Perez 1995). The archaeological materials from Chafii, like those from Salinas Grandes, ended up at the Museo Etnografico Juan B. Ambrosetti in Buenos Aires. Having received a grant from the National Science Foundation, I visited the museum in 1995 and again in 2005, where I examined the human remains from both sites. The set from Chani was so badly pre served that it was impossible to determine the indi vidual's sex. Therefore I obtained two samples from it?one of bone, the other of dry tissue?and sent them to the Lifecodes Corporation of Stanford, Connecticut. At Lifecodes, specialists processed the samples separately: they extracted a tiny amount of DNA, which was degraded; they amplified it using primers for the Amilogenin gene; and they looked for DNA fragments that are unique to the X or Y chromosome. Unfortunately they did not get any results (Ivan Balazs, personal communica tion 1996). Based on some of the artifacts that were left with the child, however?including the pyro engraved box and the wooden comb?I would say that the victim was female (see Ceruti 2003:33). The Mummy of Salinas Grandes The boy was sacrificed when he was about six (Boman 1918:97; Fernandez 1997:161). Accord ing to Eric Boman, who examined his corpse in 1917, it was well preserved. This was partly because it had lain in the ground for four centuries and had become impregnated with salt, which inhibits decay (Boman 1918:96-97). It also was conserved through saponification (Fernandez 1997:161), the process by which the fatty acids in a cadaver turn to a substance like soap, and through dehydration. Before his death, the individual had assumed a "loose" fetal position (Figure 5): he was partially sitting and partially on his back, knees bent and legs drawn up so that the left heel almost touched his buttocks.

Both arms were flexed, with the right hand</page><page sequence="10">408 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 4, 2010 Figure 5. Photograph of the sacrificial victim's body as it appeared in the early twentieth century (Boman 1918:Figura 1; courtesy of the Museo Etnografico, Buenos Aires). touching his head and the left one reaching for his throat (Boman 1918:96). While studying the remains in 1995 and 2005, I found that they were deteriorating badly (see Fer nandez 1997:161). Flesh was flaking off*the bones, completely exposing the skull and partly revealing the ribs. The arms and legs were falling to pieces (Figure 6). Prior to sacrificing the qhapaq hucha, the Cuzquenos had carefully fixed his long, black hair, plaiting it into numerous braids, each about 12 cm long and .5 cm thick (Boman 1918:99). In the draw ings of Guaman Poma de Ayala, an indigenous author/illustrator who worked in the early 1600s, Inka men are always portrayed with short hair (Fig ure 7). Among some of their subjects, though, it was common for males to have longer locks (Fig ures 8-9) that were plaited. One such group, the Lupaqa (Mostny 1957:33,55-56, 114/No. 4), had established a powerful polity to the west and south of Lake Titicaca but had been defeated militarily by the lords of Cuzco and had been incorporated into the empire. As I state earlier, the ethnohistoric sources men tion that before qhapaq huchas met their ends, they sometimes took part in festivals involving the mastication of coca leaves. To find out if the child from Salinas Grandes had ingested coca in antic ipation of his ritual dispatch, I cut a braid from his head and sent it to Larry Cartmell, director of the Department of Anatomical and Clinical Pathology at the Valley View Regional Hospital in Ada, Okla homa. Cartmell washed the hair sample. Then he divided it into 10 segments, each of which was just over a centimeter long and represented about a month's growth. Next he employed the radioim munoassay method to test the individual segments for traces of benzoylecgonine (BZE), thus estab lishing a month-by-month record of coca con sumption by the victim. Unfortunately the method could not be used to ascertain if the boy had chewed leaves right before his death (Larry Cart mell, personal communication April 11, 1994; Cartmell etal. 1991).</page><page sequence="11">Besom] INKA SACRIFICE AND THE MUMMY OF SALINAS GRANDES 409 Figure 6. Photograph of the corpse as it appeared in 1992 (Museo Etnografico, Buenos Aires; courtesy of Carlos Estanislao Martinez, photographer). Cartmell determined that the child may have been exposed to a small amount of cocaine approx imately three months prior to his immolation. The value obtained for the sample, however, was less than 3 ng of BZE per 10 mg of hair, which is the detection limit of the radioimmunoassay method and which means that the test result must be con sidered negative (Cartmell and Van Horn 1996a).5 As with the remains from Chani, I acquired a bone sample from the mummy of Salinas Grandes, which I sent to the Lifecodes Corporation. There lab technicians decalcified the sample, isolated DNA from it, amplified the genetic material, and searched it for DNA fragments that are found exclu sively with the X or Y chromosome. The results were a faint pattern indicating the presence of male genetic material. Hence the sex of the victim was confirmed (Balazs, personal communication 1996). Clothing and Accouterments When the corpse of the six-year-old first came to light, it was dressed in an unku, a sleeveless tunic worn by men (Figures 7-9). The garment was woven of camelid wool and was reddish purple in color. But it largely disintegrated, perhaps as the body was being removed from its tomb (Boman 1918:100; Figure 6). Boman (1918:101) says that the only other tex tile found with the child was wrapped around his throat, which probably indicates that he was stran gled. As I mention above, the Cuzquenos used this method to put victims to death. During my exam ination of the remains, I saw fragments of a brown cloth imbedded in the saponified flesh of the neck (see Fernandez 1997:161; Figure 6). The boy was interred with a variety of adorn ments. He had a bracelet called a chipana that con sisted of a rectangular sheet of copper that was 10 cm long, 5 cm wide, and about 2 mm thick?each of whose corners had been cut (Figure 10). It cir cled his right wrist (Boman 1918:100-101). In 1995,1 noticed fragments of oxidized copper with the corpse, which may have been from this bracelet (see Fernandez 1997:161; Figure 6). On each ring finger the qhapaq hucha wore a copper ring that had been fashioned from a rectangular lamina. Affixed to the front of one of them was a copper ornament with serpentine shapes executed in relief (Boman 1918:100; Figure 11). The rings either fell apart or were lost (Fernandez 1997:161).</page><page sequence="12">410 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 4, 2010 Figure 7. A "captain" from Cuzco; he wears his hair short and has a tunic, a mantle, a bracelet, anklets, a headband with feather panache, a bag, and sandals (Guaman Poma 1980:1:138 [1615]). The Diadem The six-year-old also had a piece that Boman (1918:99-100; Figure 12) refers to as a diadem, which was of thinly beaten gold and which mea sured 12 cm in length and 9 cm in height. It had a complex shape, consisting of a curving band that terminated at each end with an elliptical disk. Ris ing above the band were two forms that Boman believes to be stylized human figures; as an alter native interpretation, I propose that they could be schematic representations of feather panaches. In geometric terms, each consisted of an isosceles trapezoid, from the middle of whose wider base projected a truncated isosceles triangle. The ver tices of the forms were rounded. Whereas the base of the triangle was slightly convex, its sides were somewhat concave. Henceforth I will refer to these figures, for lack of a better term, as stylized forms. There were two holes punched into the curving band of the adornment, each one directly under a stylized form. Sometime during the past 75 years,</page><page sequence="13">Besom] INKA SACRIFICE AND THE MUMMY OF SALINAS GRANDES 411 mcA co Figure 8. A "captain" from Qulla Suyu; he has long hair and wears a tunic, a mantle, a bracelet, an H-shaped pendant, and moccasins (Guaman Poma 1980:1:148 [1615]). the diadem disappeared (Fernandez 1997:161). The diadem is closely related to other adorn ments and head ornaments in the Inka state. Such pieces served to indicate the wearer's regional ori gin, ethnic affiliation (Reinhard 2005:308), and/or social status. In the drawings of Guaman Poma, noble males from Qulla Suyu (more commonly written "Collasuyu"), the southeastern quarter of the polity, are always shown with H-shaped pen dants dangling under their chins (Figure 8). At least two examples of these adornments are known from the archaeological record (Bandelier 1910:Plate XXXII/No. 4; Mostny 1957:Lamina 10/a). Both are made of silver and were found in ritual contexts: one of them came from the Island of the Sun in Lake Titicaca, which was one of the most sacred places in the empire and which during the late Intermedi ate period was the site of an important Lupaqa shrine (Stanish and Bauer 2007:69-70,74-75); the other piece was discovered with the body of a boy who was sacrificed on Mount El Plomo in central Chile (Mostny 1957:56). They consist of two cres cent moons that are joined in the middle by a band; the horns of the crescents point upward. Minimally there are two holes punched into the upper-middle part of the superior crescent. Strings tied to these</page><page sequence="14">412 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 4, 2010 *&gt; EL3&gt;0 Z E CAPITAM ^^^^ C Apo.C Figure 9. A "captain" from Chinchay Suyu; he has moderately long hair and sports a tunic, a headband, a headdress/col lar that looks like a corolla, and sandals (Guaman Poma 1980:1:144 [1615]). holes were fastened to the opposite sides of a llawfu, a headband that circled the crown of the wearer. The pieces hung freely. Bandelier published a picture of another orna ment from the Island of the Sun. It was fashioned from sheet copper and consists of an H-shaped pen dant, to the top of which was added the stylized form; we know which end is up in the piece because the horns of the crescents always point skyward. In this example of the stylized form, the convex base of the isosceles triangle is decorated in repousse with two lines of dots (Bandelier 1910:Plate LXVI/No. 14). Unlike most H-shaped pendants, Bandelier's adornment could not be suspended under the chin, for if it had been, the stylized form would have jabbed the wearer in the throat. Rather, it was affixed to the front of a headband, for which purpose it has four holes in it (instead of the usual two). One pair of holes is situated in the lower middle (rather than the upper-middle) part of the superior crescent, while the other pair is located in the upper-middle part of the inferior crescent. It was thus securely sewn to a llawfu, with the stylized form rising above the forehead like a feather panache. That the proper position for the stylized form was the wearer's pate is confirmed by a discovery made on Llullaillaco Volcano in Argentina. The</page><page sequence="15">Besom] INKA SACRIFICE AND THE MUMMY OF SALINAS GRANDES 413 Figure 10. The copper chipana from Salinas Grandes (Boman 1918:Figura 3). body of a girl who had been sacrificed by the Inkas came to light there. On her forehead was a silver plaque shaped like the stylized form. The top of this piece, like the adornment described by Bandelier, has a line of dots executed in repousse (Reinhard 2005:Photo 19; Reinhard and Ceruti 2000:Foto 25). In conclusion, the gold diadem from Salinas Grandes would have been attached to a headband and worn with the stylized forms pointing upward. The piece could not have hung under the chin, as has been suggested by one reviewer, since the styl ized forms would have hit the wearer in the gullet. It is affiliated with the H-shaped pendants, which were themselves closely associated with the peo ple of Qulla Suyu and, more specifically, with the nobility from the Lake Titicaca area. Hence it may have served to indicate the six-year-old's high sta tus and regional origin. Miscellaneous Items When the corpse of the child was unearthed, sup posedly there were ceramic vessels with it; Boman never saw them, however. Their presence would have been unusual, as such pieces were usually reserved for female victims (Boman 1918:101), the only known exception being a boy who was sac rificed on Mount Ampato in Peru (Reinhard 1997:42-13). Figure 11. A copper ring worn by the sacrificial victim (Boman 1918:Figura 4). The Scepter An additional item that was left with the six-year old, and the only one I was able to examine first hand, is a scepter (Figure 13). It measures 26 cm in length and is made from two deer bones that have been cut and joined together. At the point of con tact between the bones, the piece is wrapped with a string composed of vegetable fibers. Sticking out of the topmost bone is a gray/white tuft of camelid wool (Boman 1918:101). Guaman Poma has a drawing titled "Entiero de Colla Svios" that shows the mummified corpse of a noble from Qulla Suyu (Figure 14). The mummy has long hair, wears a tunic and moccasins, sports an H-shaped pendant under the chin, and holds what I believe to be a scepter. As I see it, this scepter is just like the one from Salinas Grandes: it appears to be made from two pieces that have been joined, and seems to have a tuft of wool protruding from the top. A reviewer interprets the picture differ ently, saying that the figure may be grasping a weapon such as a lance. Having studied Guaman Poma's illustrations extensively, however, I have found that the arms he generally depicts?the kunka kuchuna, battle ax (Guaman Poma 1980:1:67 [1615]); the chanpi, star-headed mace (Guaman Poma 1980:1:76 [1615]); the chuki, lance (Guaman Poma 1980:1:51 [1615]); and the hardwood club (Guaman Poma 1980a: 128 [1615])?all have long handles. Therefore it is unlikely that the object in</page><page sequence="16">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 4, 2010 Figure 12. The gold diadem (Boman 1918:Figura 2). question is a weapon. Actually it is unique, appear ing in no other drawing done by the indigenous author/illustrator (Guaman Poma 1980:1 [1615], 1980:2 [1615], 1980:3 [1615]). Part of the text that accompanies the picture of the mummy is in Aymara, which is unusual for Guaman Poma (1980:1:269 [1615]), who generally wrote in Quechua and Spanish (Hamilton 2009:xxi-xxii). Aymara was spoken around Lake Titicaca (Moseley 1992:31), though. Its inclusion in the document may indicate that it was the dead noble's native tongue and that he came from the vicinity of the lake. The Boy as a Qhapaq Hucha The child from Salinas Grandes was almost cer tainly a qhapaq hucha (Boman 1918:101; Fernan dez 1997:157,161). At six, he was the right age for a male victim. He had the clothing, accouterments, and hairstyle of an individual from the Lake Titi caca area (which was a distant land): he originally sported an unku, a chipana, and the diadem with two stylized forms (which are related to the H shaped pendant); his long locks had been plaited into numerous braids like those worn by the Lupaqa; and he held what both I and Boman inter pret to be a scepter. About three months prior to his immolation, he may have been taken from his homeland to Cuzco, where he may have partici pated in a festival that involved chewing coca (there may be a trace of BZE in his hair). He probably Figure 13. Photograph of the possible scepter that was found with the sacrificial victim.</page><page sequence="17">Besom] INKA SACRIFICE AND THE MUMMY OF SALINAS GRANDES 415 Figure 14. The mummified body of a noble from Qulla Suyu; he has moderately long hair, wears a tunic and moccasins, sports an H-shaped pendant, and holds what may be a scepter (Guaman Poma 1980:1:268 [1615]). was designated as an offering for Salinas Grandes; after walking to this waqa, the Inkas very likely strangled him, placed him at the bottom of a hole in a semiseated position, and buried him. Possible Reasons for the Sacrifice Why was the six-year-old immolated at Salinas Grandes? According to various ethnohistoric authors, the lords of Cuzco dispatched qhapaq huchas to honor waqas?which were sometimes conceived of as deities?that were associated with vital resources. Hernandez Principe tells us about a group of mitmaq-kuna, settlers, whom the Inkas moved from their native land to Huailas province, where they produced ceramics. The settlers were given a pair of children by the state, which they offered to some pits along with sahu mama, good quality clay. They made these sacrifices to ensure that they did not run out of raw material (Hernan dez 1923:34 [1622]). The Cuzquefios may have immolated the boy, girl, and young woman on Llullaillaco because this volcano was responsible for the flow of water in the surrounding region, which is extremely dry.</page><page sequence="18">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 4, 2010 Water was critical for agriculture (Ceruti 2003:130-131,213; Reinhard and Ceruti 2000:86). They may have dispatched the pair of females on La Plata as the island was tied to the Spondylus trade (Marcos and Norton 1981:146,149,1984:14-15). Spondylus was esteemed throughout the Andes. And they may have sacrificed the seven or so vic tims on Puntiudos because the hill was closely iden tified with the extraction of copper (Castillo 1994; Iribarren 1962; Stehberg 1995:76). Salinas Grandes, too, may have been venerated because it supplied an important resource?salt. Without this basic commodity, life would be impossible in the highlands (Moseley 1992:43). Today large quanti ties of the mineral are removed from Salinas Grandes and shipped to the rest of Argentina, while in the prehispanic era the Cuzquenos may have extracted salt and transported it via llama caravan to other parts of the empire. It is possible that the immolation at Salinas Grandes, like those on Puntiudos, was connected with copper mining, since the area around the salt flat is rich in the metal. Near the double hill where the child was probably buried is the village of Cobres, which specializes in the extraction of cop per. The lords of Cuzco operated a mine there. The Inka site of El Moreno was also associated with the production of the mineral, and 65 km south of the likely interment spot is the town of San Antonio de los Cobres, where there used to be a major copper mine (Acuto 1996-1998:2; Fernandez 1997:162-163; Raffino et al. 1978:101; Figure 3). What was the conceptual link between the dis patch of a qhapaq hucha and the exploitation of a natural resource? In the Andean belief system, the sacrifice of the six-year-old would have established a reciprocal relationship between the Sapa Inka, the emperor, in whose name the immolation was car ried out, and the waqa. The former gave the latter a human life as a gift; following the rules of ayni, a simple and balanced form of exchange (Isbell 1980.T67/Section 7.1; Silverblatt 1987:227), the god of Salinas Grandes would have owed a debt to the emperor, which could have been repaid in the form of minerals (Duviols 1976:33-34/Secci6n 3). Since it was the Sapa Inka?as opposed to the inhabitants of the region?who made the offering, it was he who could claim the resource. Another interpretation of the sacrifice relates to sight lines. They were of great significance to the Inkas, who sometimes worshipped waqas from afar but from spots with clear visual lines toward them (Besom 2009a:39-40, 132-135). Fernandez (1997:159, 162) maintains that the twin summits of Dead Child Hill are in perfect alignment with the top of Chani. As I discuss earlier, Chafii was the site of a qhapaq hucha immolation. Citing the sight line between Dead Child and Chani, one reviewer says that the mummy from the former may have been intended as an oblation for the latter. As the reviewer points out, there is eth nohistoric evidence for the veneration of a high peak from low knolls. Hernandez Principe recounts the story of Tanta Carhua, a girl who was buried alive on a mountain in Aixa, after which the provin cial folk made minor offerings to her from the sur rounding hills. There was always a visual link between the shrines on the hills and her tomb (Hernandez 1923:62 [1622]). There also are archae ological data that suggest that the Inkas did not have to sacrifice a victim directly on the summit to which he or she was dedicated. Coropuna was greatly revered and almost certainly received immolations (Albornoz 1967:21,35 [1583?]; Cieza 1959:151-152 [1553], 1967:97-98 [1553]). But because its upper slopes are permanently covered with snow and are heavily glaciated, it is unlikely that the Cuzquenos could have climbed to its pin nacle to leave offerings. So they may have dis patched two people near its base and interred them with textiles and ceramics (Beorchia 1985:55-57). Be that as it may, I know of no case (mentioned in either the ethnohistoric or the archaeological literature) where a human sacrifice was carried out on a hill to honor a peak that also had an immo lation on its crest. Such a scenario makes little sense to me: given that Chani was likely the object of numerous pilgrimages, and that it was fre quently ascended, why would the lords of Cuzco have dispatched the boy on Dead Child? I doubt that the mummy of Salinas Grandes was intended as an oblation for the mountain; rather, I would suggest that both the salt flat (or the hill) and Chani were important waqas that were worthy of human lives. Just as there may be a visual link between Dead Child and the peak, so they may have been tied by sight lines to a larger network of waqas, all of which received qhapaq hucha immolations. Such a net work, spread over the landscape like a geopolitical</page><page sequence="19">Besom] INKA SACRIFICE AND THE MUMMY OF SALINAS GRANDES 417 map, could have metaphorically unified the terri tories that composed the southeast quarter and defined the limits of the empire (Besom 2009b:272). The sacrifice carried out at Salinas Grandes may have been associated with travel and trade (Besom 2009b:266-267). The Cuzquenos, along with the members of particular ethnic groups, transported large quantities of raw materials and finished goods around the state (D'Altroy 2002:199-201, 243; Rowe 1946:270-271). For this purpose they employed llama caravans. According to some Span ish authors, people who engaged in trade venerated peaks as an integral part of their travels. Ayala (1974-1976:282-283 [1614]) maintains that as the natives of Chinchaycocha journeyed through the Andes laden with goods, they invoked and made offerings to the mountains that they passed and entreated these waqas to grant them success, health, and a safe trip. If, as proposed by Fernandez, there was an Inka road that followed the western edge of Salinas Grandes, it was probably dominated by Dead Child. In fact, the hill, rising about 470 m above the salt, may have served as a landmark for the camelid trains making their way across this wasteland. So the lords of Cuzco may have immolated the six year-old on the pinnacle to protect traders from harm and to make sure that they reached their des tinations. Yet another explanation for the sacrifice relates to political authority within the polity. Murra (1980:122) maintains that the Cuzquenos often exercised control indirectly: rather than incorporate a conquered group directly into the empire, they would reinforce the power that a kuraka, a local ruler, exerted over his people and would tie him to the state (Patterson 1987:119). The nexus between the provincial noble and the polity took the form of a rite involving the dispatch of a qhapaq hucha (Hernandez 1923:61-63 [1622]; see also Silverblatt 1987:94-96). An immolation of this type, which could only take place with Inka consent (Ulloa 1885:45/Secci6n 14 [1586]), simultaneously enhanced the kuraka's regional authority and made him subservient to his conquerors. Thus the offer ing of the boy may have constituted the indirect but critical link between an indigenous group that lived near Salinas Grandes and the empire (Besom 2009b:291-292). Interpretation of Meaning Cummins says that when dealing with sets of rit ual objects from the lords of Cuzco, including mate rials associated with sacrifice, we should avoid interpreting the meaning of individual pieces in isolation. It is probable that the significance of one item would have been related to that of another item and that each of them would have contributed to a single, coherent message. Such a message (espe cially in the case of a human immolation) would have been connected with power (Cummins 2007). I believe that the child may have served as a sym bol of the state bureaucracy. Although no ethno historic documents specifically say that the victims represented imperial officials, they do assert that these people were richly dressed (in clothing and with adornments that only the elite could use) before being dispatched (Betanzos 1968:247, 284 [1557], 1987:51, 84,142 [1557], 1996:46, 77-78, 132 [1557]; Cieza 1959:150-151 [1553], 1967:95-96 [1553]; Hernandez 1923:62 [1622]). The boy had the garments, ornaments, and hair style of a provincial noble from the southeastern quarter. Guaman Poma's (1980:1:250,336 [1615]) manuscript features several pictures of state func tionaries from Qulla Suyu who are dressed like the victim. For instance, "El Catorze Capitan" shows a military "officer" with a tunic, a bracelet, an H shaped pendant (which is related to the six-year old's diadem with stylized forms), long locks, and moccasins (Figure 8). I have little doubt that when the child was entombed by the Cuzquenos, he too wore moccasins on his feet, which disintegrated.6 Some of the items that were left with the boy would have been considered inappropriate for use by a child. During his short life, the six-year-old almost certainly had not participated in warachiku. As part of this initiation rite, which normally took place when a youth was 14 or so, he would have received a warn (breechcloth) and a black llawt'u, which were symbolic of manhood (Cobo 1990:202, see also 126-127 [1653]). But the individual from Salinas Grandes was too young to have taken part in it and was not wearing a warn when he was dis interred; if he was too immature to have a breech cloth, then he should not have sported a headband either, or the diadem, which would have been affixed to the headband. The fact remains, however, that the child did</page><page sequence="20">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 4, 2010 have a llawt 'u, the diadem, the possible scepter, and the bracelet, which were the accouterments of an older person and emblems of authority in the Inka polity. So I propose that he represented an imper ial official from Qulla Suyu, and that on a more abstract level he symbolized, and his sacrifice cel ebrated, the political organization of the state. It was only through their "organizing genius" (Rowe 1946:329) that the lords of Cuzco were able to effi ciently administer and to unify their vast empire (Besom 2009b:294-296). The six-year-old from Salinas Grandes is not the only qhapaq hucha whose remains have been found in the archaeological record and who appears to be dressed like an elite bureaucrat. There also are the boys from Aconcagua and Llullaillaco (Figure 1). In the former case (Besom 2009b:296-297), the victim was a child of about seven, who was wrapped in layers of cloth to make a mummy bun dle like the ones from the Peruvian coast, and who was buried on a peak in west-central Argentina. The boy has moderately long hair and a necklace of Spondylus, lapis lazuli, and malachite beads. Among the textiles that shrouded him are tunics and mantles, of both cotton and wool, many of which are decorated with stylized birds and fish?designs that appear to be from littoral areas. A high-status item that was interred with him is a cotton unku that is covered with red and yellow feathers; they form a stepped pattern on the upper part of the gar ment and volutes on the lower part of it. This piece resembles some of the plumed tunics that have been recovered from the north coast of Peru, dating to the Chimu period. Another elaborate article from the bundle is a headdress. It has the form of a corolla and was fashioned from yellow and black feathers. Additionally there are a pair of ujufas (sandals), possibly made from maguey fibers, two braided cords that resemble llawt 'us, and three waras (Abal 2001; Schobinger 1995, 2001). Guaman Poma has numerous illustrations of nobles and state officials from Chinchay Suyu (more often written "Chinchasuyu"). In a picture titled "El Doce Capitan," he portrays a military leader from the northwestern quarter with medium length locks, a tunic, a braided headband, sandals, and a plumed headdress/collar that looks like a halo (Figure 9). The seven-year-old from Aconcagua has similar hair, clothing, and accouterments. Given that some of the items that were left with him are adult sized and/or are not suitable for a child, they must have had emblematic significance for the Inkas (Besom 2009b:297-299). The male from Llullaillaco also seems to con note a high-status functionary (Besom 2009b:299). He has hair down to the nape of his neck. He is dressed in an oversized unku of red and blue and in ayaqolla (mantle) of red and brown. On his right forearm is a silver bracelet, on his legs are white anklets, and circling his crown is a woolen sling that serves as a llawt'u. This sling holds a panache of white feathers in place over the boy's forehead. Although he wears moccasins on his feet, two pairs of ujut'as were interred with him, along with a ch'uspa (woven bag [Ceruti 2003:73, Figuras 16, 80,248/S-28 and S-29,256/S-43, Foto 19, Lamina 9/S-28 and S-29, Lamina 10/S-30, Lamina 12/S 43; Reinhard 1999:38-39, 2005:Photo 28, 325-326; Reinhard and Ceruti 2000:57-58, 94, 162/No. 34,163/Nos. 47-48, Fotos 34,47-48]). One of Guaman Poma's pictures, which is called "El Noveno Capitan," shows an elite Cuzquefio? the type of person who carried out the day-to-day operations of the empire. This individual has a tunic, a mantle, anklets, a bracelet on his right wrist, a bag that hangs from his left arm, a headband with feather panache, and sandals (Guaman Poma 1980:1:138 [1615]), just like the child. Some of the articles found with the boy, however, do not seem to have belonged to him but, rather, appear to have had spe cial significance connected with his immolation. They include the sandals that were placed along side him, the llawt'u and panache that he was prob ably too immature to use, and the unku that was too large for him. Hence I reject the inference that he was the actual son of an Inka noble; besides, his locks are too long (the lords of Cuzco kept their hair short), and he wears moccasins. Instead I contend that he was meant to embody the imperial bureau cracy par excellence (Besom 2009b:299-300). "Fixing " Reality Drurnmond says that culture is not the monolithic entity that we perceive it to be. Rather, it consists of a continuously changing mass of perspectives, some of which overlap, while others contradict each other (Drurnmond 1983; Hodder 1986:150). Since people find this ambiguous quality to be dis turbing, they attempt to compensate by creating a single version of reality. Their aim is to reassure</page><page sequence="21">Besom] INKA SACRIFICE AND THE MUMMY OF SALINAS GRANDES 419 themselves of their place in the world, of their role in society, and of the appropriateness of their behav ior in a given social context (Kertzer 1988:10; Moore 1975:234). The elite also try to control reality: to the extent that they can reify a particular image of their society?one in which their position of privilege and power is unquestioned?they can successfully legitimate their rule (Giddens 1979:195-196). But how is reality/meaning "fixed"? The process partly involves manipulating ritual; the members of the dominant class will regulate different variables in a rite?including time, space, movement, color, sound, smell, emotion, and most important, the use of symbols, especially material symbols. As sig nificance is contextual?it is based on the range of associations and dissociations, comparisons and contrasts in a ceremony?they can influence mean ing (Hodder 1986:151). Given that people's per ceptions of the world are framed by systems of meaning, the elite can mold their sense of reality (Kertzer 1988:4-5; Nieburg 1973:54). By carrying out the sacrifice near the salt fiat, and by burying the body of the victim dressed as a state official, the Cuzquenos may have been attempting to reify the notion that the region had been incorporated into their empire. Simultane ously they may have been trying to "fix" the idea that the polity, with its sophisticated administrative system, would effectively control the area. The six year-old, as a physical emblem, not only would have reflected Inka authority but would have helped to constitute it (Besom 2009b:301-302). Acknowledgments. I would like to thank Jose Perez Gollan, the former director of the Museo Etnografico in Buenos Aires, and Myriam Tarrago, the current director, who autho rized my research on the mummy of Salinas Grandes. I also would like to express my appreciation to Norma Perez, who was in charge of conservation at the museum, and to Ines Baffi, who was head of the bioanthropology section, for aid ing me in my study. Financial support for the project came from the National Science Foundation, which awarded me a Dissertation Improvement Grant in 1994. I am grateful to Constanza Ceruti for sharing information with me on the sacrifice, to Carlos Estanislao Martinez for providing photographs of the victim's body, and to Juan Leoni for translating the abstract. Sarah Walker scanned the illustrations for me, Justin Miller helped to prepare the map, Larry Cartmell carried out the segmental hair analysis, and the Lifecodes Corp. conducted the DNA study; I am indebted to them all. Furthermore I would like to acknowl edge the article's anonymous reviewers, who offered invalu able suggestions for improving the work.

In Boletin del Museo de Huasco No. 17:4-5, 7. Notes 1. Different authors use the term in different ways. Whereas Betanzos (1996:132 [1557]) defines qhapaq hucha as a particular kind of human sacrifice, to Cieza (1959:190, 192 [1553]) it denotes any offering that is left at an idol or shrine. Following Hernandez (1923:32, 41, 60-62 [1622]), I take the term to mean a specific type of victim. 2. In her book on the sacrifice from Mount El Plomo, Mostny states that the female statuette (of silver) was not found in direct association with the corpse of the boy. Rather, the figurine came from another part of the Enterratorio, the structure where the child was buried, or perhaps from its annex (Mostny 1957:46/n; see also Besom 2009b:208; Medina 1958:54). 3. Flannery et al. 1989:67, 98-99, 105-112, 114-116; Flores-Ochoa 1979:37-38, 61, 69, 95,102-109,119. In these books, the authors take it for granted that Andean herders and the drivers of llama trains?both today and in the prehispanic era?are/were always male. Also, the Inkas buried llama fig urines only with male statuettes (Ceruti 2003:118, 130; see also Reinhard 1999:38, 44). 4. Other authors who provide information on low-altitude qhapaq hucha sacrifices include Checura (1977), Checura et al. (1985), and Uhle (1903). 5. At the same time that I obtained a lock of hair from the mummy of Salinas Grandes, I got one from the Cham" corpse. It too was sent to Cartmell, who cut it into 11 segments, each of which was tested for BZE. The results were negative (Cartmell and Van Horn 1996b). 6. Similarly, the nine-year-old sacrificed on El Plomo was decked out like an imperial official from the southeastern quarter (Besom 2009b:294-295): He wore an unku, ayaqolla (mantle), a llawt'u, a chipana, an H-shaped pendant, and moccasins. His long hair had been braided into hundreds of tiny plaits (Mostny 1957). The girl immolated on Llullaillaco had not only the silver plaque shaped like the stylized form but moccasins (Ceruti 2003:81), which means that she too may have been from Qulla Suyu.
