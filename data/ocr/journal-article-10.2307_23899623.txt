What is St. John pointing to in the painting, St. John the Baptist by Philippe de Champaigne or St. Sebastian in the Crucifixion by Grünewald. What does it mean? What is the tradition behind St. Bartholomew's holding up his own peeled off skin in Michelangelo's Last Judgement? What were the complex motivations and historical elements during the French Revolution that led to caricatures such as a sans culottes wiping his ass with a Papal brief? These are only a few of the many mysterious and previously unprobed questions that Claude Gandelman explores, analyzes and answers in this comprehensive and informative study. Reading Pictures, Viewing Texts is first and foremost a work of intellectual history. Its ideas, references and illustrations often start in ancient times and are traced through to the présent day. Drawing on the disciplines of history, art history, psychology, semiotics and literature, Professor Gandelman carefully and clearly présents his ideas, théories and arguments, often destroying long held myths and heresies in the process. There are numerous supportive examples and illustrations, the latter obtained from muséums and private collections. The copious annotated footnotes are an éducation in themselves. In Chapter I, the author traces the complex connection between vision, touch and beliefs, drawing on examples from the Egyptian sun-sign for Re, and the mid east khamssa through Courbet, to Dali, Bunuel and Klee. The gesture of démonstration, a hand with the index finger pointing toward an object within the painting, omniprésent in art works between 1450 and 1500, its relationship to Christian theology (through Augustine's use of the „pointing finger" metaphor) and its re-emergence in the Brechtian theater - are amply discussed in Chapter Π. One chapter analyzes doors in paintings describing them as explicit rites of passage. Another investigates the expressionist phantasm of the anorexie body; still another „Toeing the Line" applies this linear image to the arena of aesthetics and politics. The transformation of text into an anthropomorphic map is followed in Chapter VI from ancient Egyptian cosmography through the Middle Ages when the body of Christ was projected over the world map and later in the anthropomorphic map, The Mediterranean as a Sea of Sin, finally culminating in a discussion of Joyce's Finnegan's Wake having the anatomy of a giant half buried in the Irish landscape. The powerful influence of the language of populär dérision and populär wrath is often underestimated in history. The author provides new and différent insights into the true „ideals" of the French Revolution. Scurrilous imagery on the open market during the French Revolution represent the King as a po werless or impotent male sex organ and also as a „defecator." Certain caricatures show sans culottes wiping their bottoms with officiai déclarations by king or clergy. During the Reformation period, we may see scenes such as a nun spanking a monk or the birth of an enemy through the rectum, a favorite insuit of Luther's. ZRGG 46, 2 (1994), © E.J. Brill, Leiden</page><page sequence="2">Buchbesprechungen 183 Two of the most original and insightful chapters in the book analyze the ancient Marsyas myth. (Marsyas was flayed alive against a tree on Apollo's Orders or by Apollo himself). The analysis concludes that the myth represents artistic création as a self-flaying process. „Such is the terrible enjoyment of the creative artist, who feels the tearing off of his own skin - even welcomes it - in the creative process." Again the author supports his argument with many examples from literature, art and religion, ranging from Michelangelo and the flayed Mexican god, Xipe-Totec, to Derrida and the deconstructionists. With the latter, it is the textual skin that is torn off. Then Professor Gandelman turns to concrète poetry which is utilized as a paradigm of the dialectic between order and disorder in art création. The last chapter focuses on oculocentrism orthe hegemony of the sense of sight overthe other senses. Citing our own postmodem society as oculocentrist, the author probes the unbearable character of true seeing, the trauma of sight, and portends the end of vision itself qua „sensual" (to be replaced, perhaps, by the simulacrum of computer-helmets and electronic vision).
