Or are we referring to something removed altogether from the world of cause and effect - a realm of being accessible to the subject alone? The concept of the mental is the focus of a deep philosophical question, and I shall assume an answer to that question. I shall assume that all phenomena described as mental are part of the physical world, just as much as the behaviour, bodies and brains of the subjects that possess them. If there were no such things as brains, bodies and behaviour, then neither would there be mental phenomena. But while this answers (dog matically) the second question from which I began, it does not answer the first. Moreover, the per sistence of the philosphical problem explains why the first question appears so difficult. Is mental illness characterised by cause, symptom or treat ment? And what justifies our answer? Imagine someone who suffers from lapses of memory, hallucinations, sudden depressions and nameless fears. These are all 'mental' symptoms, in the straightforward sense of involving states of mind. But are they therefore signs of a 'mental' illness? Suppose that they had been caused by a blow on the head, that they were episodic, that the patient himself was able to predict their recurrence, that a tablet was to hand which, taken in time, would avert them. Surely, it would be very odd to describe the condition of such a patient as one of 'mental' illness. By analogy we are reluctant to use that label now of epilepsy, even though its symptoms interrupt and disorder the mental life of its victim. What are the principal characteristics of epilepsy that lead us to classify it apart from 'mental' complaints? I do not think that the important factor lies in its cause. Certainly, epilepsy is caused by physical malfunctioning : a malfunctioning of the central nervous system. But presumably the same is true of schizophrenia, depression or obessional neurosis. (At least it would be a gross a priori prejudice to deny it.) But if none of these is a 'mental' disorder, then nothing is. Should we so easily abandon the distinction between mental and physical disease? I think not. Is it sufficient for an illness to be mental that the mental states of the victim should be obviously, affected? Examples certainly suggest that this is not the important fact. A cold can cause depression, tonsillitis may precipitate hallucinations, and every fever brings its stock of griefs and nightmares. So if we followed this suggestion, we should tend to move from the view that no illnesses are mental to the view that almost all are : hardly an advance. Does the distinction lie in the treatment? If you can treat it with medicines, some think, then it cannot be mental; that was the real distinction at work in the original examples. But not every disease is treatable. You cannot treat multiple sclerosis with medicines because you cannot treat it with anything. Would it be better to say that an illness is 'mental' if it can be treated without medicines: say by talking to an analyst, or beating up a wife ? But this too seems inadequate. Even most psycho analysts agree that there is no way to talk someone out of schizophrenia; yet it can be treated with drugs. Nor is there any reason why we should not in principle be able to talk a man out of a cold or a cancer (although there is truth in the suggestion that, when we discover that we can do that, we speak, not precisely of 'mental', but at least of 'psycho-somatic' illness.) All this begins to look less confusing if we turn to an ancient philosophical distinction, between the 'rational' and the 'non-rational' parts of the mind. This distinction was associated with the view that rationality distinguished men from animals. Perhaps we should be reluctant to accept that philosophy in its ancient form. But even now it would be an uncommonly anthropomorphic vet who distinguished the 'mental' from the 'physical' illnesses of animals. This ought to give us a clue. For consider what it is that animals cannot do : they cannot make judgements, have opinions, take counsel, form plans and intentions for the future. Roughly speaking, there are two areas of mentality that are closed to them: judgement and decision. And both of these are made and unmade through reasoning, changed and confirmed through dis cussion and dispute. (I can argue you out of a judgement or an intention: not out of a pain, a depression or a hallucinatory dream.) So perhaps the old idea of a 'rational' part of the mind is not so silly. Moreover, when an illness invades this portion of an agent's mind it has striking conse</page><page sequence="2">38 R Scruton quences. It tends to prevent the patient from forming relations with others. Without the capacity to reason, to decide, to give and receive advice and promises, the whole superstructure of human intercourse will disappear. So could we say that an illness is 'mental' if it affects the patient's capacity for judgement and decision? The answer is not so easy. For epilepsy too has this effect. But the effect is temporary; moreover, by treating himself, the patient may postpone the fit ad infinitum. A disease that can be kept at bay by the very rational capacities which it threatens seems not to deserve the label 'mental'. But this suggests a modified answer. Imagine a victim of a psychotic depression so immersed in his nightmare that the capacity to form intentions has all but disappeared. The victim has no answers to the question 'What shall I do?' but 'nothing', 'you tell me', or 'I don't know'. Suppose too, that his capacity for judgement is also impaired. (The two will go together, for it is clear that one's understanding of the world must diminish as one retracts one's decision to change it.) Such a patient may not be able even to consent to the treatment that is offered him. Now here too there is a physical cause and perhaps indeed a partially successful physical treatment. But the illness is decidedly 'mental'. For the only way of fully describing its horror is in terms of that loss of intention and judgement to which I referred. In extreme cases, their loss may amount to the disappearance of the 'self. It is a loss which makes it impossible to treat the patient as other than an object: his consent may be solicited, but there is never any guarantee that it is sincerely obtained. Even if a treatment exists, it is only in retrospect that he will understand the reason for undergoing it. Here then, we might well see a real distinction, when an illness so affects a patient that he himself can no longer 'take responsibility for' (since he cannot intend) his treatment. But the example is an extreme one. Surely not everything that we would consider mental illness is like that? How, then, do we work back from this obvious case of mental illness to the less obvious, or less obviously classifiable, cases? First, we must incorporate a little more of the concept of 'ration ality' into our definition. So far I have considered only an extreme case of interference with the workings of reason - the case where decision making is distorted or defunct. There is also the case where not intention but judgement is affected. A man may find himself suddenly possessed of convictions that fly in the face of evidence, of perceptions that bear no relation to his environment, of thoughts, reasonings and conclusions that lead away from the real world of rational discourse to another private world in which he resides as it were in solitary confinement. This case - the case of delusion (with or without hallucination) - is again a case of 'mental' illness. For it removes the patient from the public world where rational beings relate and influence one another, to another world where he is inaccessible. Anything done to him in the public world is done only with the vestige of consent, and he himself can make no serious plans to avert or forestall the symptoms of which he is a victim. The two cases are, however, extreme. They are both cases of a complete breakdown in rationality (of practical and of theoretical reason respectively). But they are useful to us. It is clear, first, that they are definite cases of illness, and secondly that they are cases which, if they do not deserve the label 'mental', do not deserve it only because nothing does. By extrapolating from such cases one can build up a broader and perhaps more useful classification. One can say that an illness is mental if its nature tends in the direction that we have specified. Moreover, if it has the tendency (however slight) to remove the patient from the public realm of rational intercourse, and if this is the principal symptom for which a remedy is sought, then an illness might be considered mental even though 'encapsulated' by the subject, regarded as an affliction that it is not part of 'himself. The fact that the unity of consciousness may be partial or circumscribed does not prevent its pathological disruption. It must be remembered that I have tried to locate the class of 'mental' illness through indis putable cases ; part of medical practice consists in an imaginative extrapolation towards the periphery.</page></plain_text>
