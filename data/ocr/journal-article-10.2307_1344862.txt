<plain_text><page sequence="1">Expressionism In The Rainbow JACK F. STEWART In his essay, "Lawrence as a Painter," Herbert Read observes: "Lawrence was an expressionist," and he goes on to compare him with Nolde or Soutine.1 Edward Lucie-Smith relates Lawrence's "advocacy of expressive form" to German ex- pressionist poetry, and his later paintings to the work of expressionists such as Kirchner.2 Canvases like "Red Willows" (1927) and "Dance Sketch" (1928) support this claim (although Lawrence's paintings tend to be transcriptions of "literary" ideas, lacking the subtle power of his verbal imagery). Most strikingly, Daniel Weiss illustrates the affinity between Lawrence's psychological vision in his novels and the expressionist art of Edvard Munch.3 Such literary and painterly affinities are appropriate to the movement, for as R. S. Furness notes, "developments in literature and painting ran parallel," with some artists, such as Barlach and Kokoschka, outstanding in both media.4 Let me therefore make clear at the outset that "expressionism" in the present study refers (directly and by analogy) to Lawrence's verbal emulation of the visual arts, rather than the distinct techniques of "literary expressionism" practised by such writers as Strindberg, Trakl, Kafka, and Joyce.5 According to the journal Der Sturm, expressionism "is not a fashion, it is an attitude to life, an attitude moreover of the senses, not of the mind." 6 Definitions of the movement are therefore notoriously difficult. To Kristian Sotriffer, "Its underlying characteristic . . . consists of an over-intensification of experience, a rejection of the classical canon, a distortion and exaggeration bordering on the hysterical, a shattering of traditional forms and the reordering of the fragments to make vehicles for changed thinking and sensation, and a new, more critical 1 In Paintings of D.

Furness, Expressionism (London: Methuen, 1973), p. 45. Furness (p. 94) identifies expressionist ele- ments in Women in Love, and notes Lawrence's "openness" to the milieu of German Expressionism. Max Wildi, "The Birth of Expressionism in the Work of D. H. Lawrence," English Studies, 19, 6 (December 1937), 241-59, compares Lawrence's writing with lyric and dramatic (rather than visual) forms of expressionism. 6 See Walter H.

STEWARTJLAWRENCE AS EXPRESSIONIST and empathic approach to the world." 7 There is often religious impetus in the expressionist desire to create a new spiritual order. "Thus the whole of space," says Kasimir Edschmid, "becomes vision for the Expressionist artist." 8 Even such a formally oriented painter as Lyonel Feininger saw his work as a struggle to express the emotional unconscious: "From deep within rises an almost painful urge for the realization of inner experiences, an overwhelming longing, an un- earthly nostalgia overcomes me at times, to bring them to light. .. ."9 This statement bears a striking resemblance to Lawrence's "Foreword" to Women in Love: "Man struggles with his unborn needs and fulfilment. New unfoldings struggle up in torment in him, as buds struggle forth from the midst of a plant. . . This struggle for verbal consciousness should not be left out in art. .. It is the passionate struggle into conscious being." 10 The leading painters of Die Briicke (1905-13) themselves rejected the "Expres- sionist" label. The program E. L. Kirchner engraved for them in 1906 was ideo- logical, and when he attempted a more specific Chronicle in 1913, the group split up. But expressionism, which was also the motive force behind Die Neue Kunstlervereinigung (1909-12) and Der Blaue Reiter (1911-14), had already made its impact. It would be futile to classify a genius such as Lawrence's, that can draw on sources as diverse as Renaissance art, English landscape painting, and Italian Futurism, transforming all into the stuff of his own consciousness. "Influence" is too crude a concept for Lawrence's response to the zeitgeist, and there is no evidence of his conscious use of expressionist techniques. Expressionist elements do abound, however, in the style of The Rainbow.ll As the focus of the novel shifts from representation of "reality" to expression of the unconscious, there is a corresponding intensification, distortion, and thickening of texture. This essay is concerned with equivalences between Lawrence's language and contemporary forms of expressionism in painting. Since this radically innovative language makes a strong appeal to combined visual and visionary senses, a com- parison with the visual arts may be legitimate and revealing. "If Lawrence is to remain a source of life for us," writes Martin Green, "he must be put in a new imaginative context." 12 That is what I have ventured to do in this essay, and the connections I make between The Rainbow and expressionist art are guided by my own sense of "imaginative relevance" (see Green, 369). Lawrence shared the spiritual drive of expressionism towards inner being and its Source: ". .. I am a passionately religious man, and my novels must be 7 Expressionism and Fauvism, trans.

Using Van Gogh as a mask for his own isolation and compulsion to create, he says that art should be self-creation, and the art-work "the final expression of the created animal or man" (L, 233).14 For Lawrence, "real works of art are made by the whole consciousness of man working together in unison and oneness: instinct, intuition, mind, intellect all fused into one com- plete consciousness, and grasping what we may call a complete truth, or a complete vision. . ." 15 Completeness does not mean detachment. Art is to be valued not as an end in itself, but as an expression of the artist's struggle to live more abundantly. One expressionist quality of Lawrence's writing is the excite- ment of the act of composition it retains in its rhythms. Similarly, as Maurice Tuchman notes, "The expressionist [brushstroke] . . . implies the gesture of the artist in the painting act-a gesture of body movement. . . . Thus Van Gogh's stroke seems to burn into the canvas with savage but deliberate forceful- ness." 16 If the art of Joyce and Woolf aims at a "luminous silent stasis," that of Lawrence is dynamic. He gives more of himself, does less to cover up his emo- tional traces, makes more insistent demands upon the reader. In his letter of self-discovery to Garnett (L, 197-99), Lawrence uses the futurist manifestoes of Marinetti as an aid in defining his own visionary style.l7 It is the fermentation of futurism-its creative energy as well as its destructiveness-that attracts Lawrence. But the futurists idealized war, despised woman, and wor- shipped the machine, thus reflecting, for Lawrence, the disintegration of society.18 He blames them for looking for scientific phenomena in life, instead of "the new human phenomenon." Lawrence wants to focus on being, rather than the easily rationalized surfaces of "character." This impulse to cut deep is akin to that of the expressionists, who revived the woodcut with its primitive discipline, polar- ized contrasts, and capacity to grasp "the irrational, the mystical, the tran- scendental." 19 "I don't so much care about what the woman feels," Lawrence writes. "I only care about what the woman is-what she is-inhumanly, physi- ologically, materially . . . what she is as a phenomenon (or as representing 13 The Letters of D. H. Lawrence, ed.

Edward D. McDonald (1936; rpt. New York: Viking, 1964), p. 527: "When Van Gogh paints sunflowers, he reveals, or achieves, the vivid relation between himself, as man, and the sunflower, as sunflower, at that quick moment of time." The resultant vision is neither an image of man nor of sunflower, but "a third thing," that exists in a "fourth dimen- sion." Here Lawrence comes close to defining expressionist art. 15 "Introduction to These Paintings," Phoenix, p. 574. 1 Maurice Tuchman, Introduction, Van Gogh and Expressionism (New York: Guggenheim Foundation, 1964), n.pag. 17 See Futurist Manifestos, ed. Umbro Apollonio (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1973). 18 Lawrence (L, p. 368) praises Mark Gertler for giving radical expression to social chaos in his painting "The Merry-Go-Round": "I do think that in this combination of blaze, and violent mechanized rotation and complete involution, and ghastly, utterly mindless human intensity of sensational extremity, you have made a real and ultimate revelation." Here Lawrence fuses essential features of futurism with the process of reduction he was currently describing in Women in Love. 19 See Lothar-Gunther Buchheim, The Graphic Art of German Expressionism (New York: Universe Books, 1960), p. 27. 298</page><page sequence="4">JACK F. STEWART LAWRENCE AS EXPRESSIONIST some greater inhuman will) . . ." (L, 198). The "old stable ego of the character" is exposed as a mere literary convention, comparable to illusionist realism in painting. "There is another ego," he proclaims, "according to whose action the individual is unrecognisable, and passes through . . . allotropic states ..." (L, 198; italics mine). The ritual and symbolic scenes in The Sisters are facets- like planes in painting-of a total conception. Lawrence called his method "ana- lytical" (L, 111), but Aldous Huxley points out (L, xxii-xxiii) that the analysis was intuitional, not scientific or intellectual-as it tended to be with the futurists. When Lawrence called The Rainbow "a bit futuristic-quite unconsciously so" (L, 197), he was writing from Italy, where he had been reading Marinetti, Buzzi, and Soffici "on cubism and futurism" (L, 195). But he had also travelled through Germany (1912-13) at a time when expressionism was burgeoning, and when marriage and contact with a foreign culture were shaping his own distinctive genius. Frieda not only introduced him to Freud's ideas, she was intimate with Otto Gross, whose sexual philosophy and struggle against his father had a pro- found impact on literary expressionism, and with the circle of Ludwig Klages and Alfred Schuler, whose ideas on blood and sun struck a responsive chord in Lawrence (Green, 353, 355-56). "Gross's theory of the necessary opposition between the ego and the non-ego" (Green, 71) influenced expressionism, and became a keystone of Lawrence's philosophy. The Rainbow is dedicated to Else von Richthofen, who had a child by Gross in 1907, whose husband Edgar Jaffe owned a painting by Franz Marc, and whose struggle for intellectual emancipa- tion is one side of Ursula's character, as Frieda's Lebensphilosophie is another. The first expressionist scenes in The Rainbow deal with Tom Brangwen's passion for an unknown Polish lady. These scenes symbolize Tom's courtship of the unknown, and Lawrence attempts to convey the unconscious process with a shift from realism to expressionism. The turbulence of Tom's soul is projected into the violence of the elements, and the image patterns create a sense of dis- cordance. Tom's preparations for courtship are realistically described; then the technique becomes oblique, as mood, atmosphere, and subjective feeling are expressed in a few verbal brushstrokes: "as grey twilight was falling, he went across the orchard to gather the daffodils. The wind was roaring in the apple trees, the yellow flowers swayed violently up and down, he heard even the fine whisper of their spears as he stooped to break the flattened, brittle stems. . ." (37). The reader is projected immediately into the character's world, and feels the tension that heightens his sensitivity to color, movement, sound, and touch. The rhythmic imagery is a key to Tom's agitated state, which contrasts ironically with his stiff, formal manner. The recurring image of the daffodils, combined with contrasts of darkness and light, outside and inside, has a non-logical, expressionist force that "make[s] the invisible visible." 20 The man stands outside a window in 20 Max Beckmann, quoted in Peter Selz, German Expressionist Painting (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974), p. 51. Cf. Fromentin, quoted in Leone Vivante, A Philosophy of Potentiality (London: Rout- ledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1955), p. 4: "Painting is but the art of expressing the invisible through the visible." Paul Klee, The Thinking Eye, ed. Jurg Spiller, trans. Ralph Manheim, 2nd rev. ed.

The child's hair gleamed like spun glass, her face was illuminated till it seemed like wax lit up from the inside. The wind boomed strongly" (37). The monumental simplicity of the scene has the starkness and emotional relief of an expressionist woodcut. Brangwen is immobilized, spellbound, listening with such acute sensitivity that he can hear "the slight crunch of the rockers" of the chair. The images that follow are discordant, abrupt, surreal, suggesting his disorientation. His gaze switches from the child's "black and dilated" eyes to "the clouds which packed in great, alarming haste across the dark sky" (38). The sense of psychological distance is suggested by images of sound, silence, and space, while the character's inner pulsation is projected on to the hurrying clouds. He stands still, yet emotionally he is rushing towards a confrontation with the unknown, and so his universe is changing around him. Strangeness, awkwardness, and compulsion characterize the scene: "She could only see the dark-clad man's figure standing there upon her, and the gripped fist of flowers. She could not see the face and the living eyes" (39). Lawrence controls the focus with a painter's eye, objectifying the emotion, which has no immediate outlet. The image of "the gripped fist of flowers" stands out with expressive force as a symbol of man and moment. "An 'Image,'" according to Ezra Pound, "is that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time." 21 In the novel, motifs form larger patterns, but the culminating image does allow Lawrence to pinpoint the moment against a moving background of time and change, just as Van Gogh poses his portraits against a background of space.22 The "gripped fist" is not a character- izing image, but an expression of an emotional undersurge that leads to growth and change-and this is Lawrence's true subject. The chapter closes with an expressionist rendering of the chaos of passion, fear, and desire in Tom's soul, as he opens himself to the unknown. Lawrence does verbally what Van Gogh does with paint in "The Starry Night": he imposes an image of man's soul upon the cosmos.23 This is not anthropomorphism, but an act of visionary transformation: He went out into the wind. Big holes were blown into the sky, the moonlight blew about. Sometimes a high moon, liquid-brilliant, scudded across a hollow 21 Quoted in The Imagist Poem, ed. William Pratt (New York: Dutton, 1963), p. 18. Michael Hamburger, Reason and Energy: Studies in German Literature (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1957), p. 214, points to a possible link between Imagism and Expressionism. 22 See Van Gogh's "Diary": The Artist's Life in His Own Words, ed. Jan Hulsker (New York: Morrow, 1971), p. 109: "Behind the head, instead of painting the ordinary wall of the mean room, I paint infinity, a plain background of the richest, intensest blue that I can contrive, and by this simple combination of the bright head against the rich blue background, I get a mysterious effect, like a star in the depths of an azure sky." Similarly, young Will Brangwen is seen as pure potentiality isolated in space, "with the stars in heaven whirling fiercely about the blackness of his head . . ." (Rainbow, p. 111). 23 See J.-B. de la Faille, The Works of Vincent Van Gogh: His Paintings and Drawings (New York: Reynal, 1970), p. 428, F612. 300</page><page sequence="6">JACK F. STEWART|LAWRENCE AS EXPRESSIONIST space and took cover under electric, brown-iridescent cloud-edges. Then there was a blot of cloud, and shadow. . . . And all the sky was teeming and tear- ing along, a vast disorder of flying shapes and darkness and ragged fumes of light and a great brown circling halo, then the terror of a moon running liquid-brilliant into the open for a moment, hurting the eyes before she plunged under cover of cloud again. (44) Here synaesthesia, movement, chiaroscuro create an atmosphere of turmoil projected into visual forms that have the hallucinatory strangeness of a dream. One notes the distortion and exaggeration of the objective scene, which is saturated with the character's emotion and moves to the rhythm of his being. Lawrence reaches through and beyond character to grasp the substance of emotion and project it spatially. Phenomenological imagery pervades The Rainbow, giving many passages a preternatural intensity. Thus Lydia's look and Tom's response are again described with bizarre force: "Her eyes, with a blackness of memory struggling with passion, primitive and electric away at the back of them, rejected him and absorbed him at once" (43). Here Lawrence dramatizes the shock and recoil of contrary impulses. The lovers' embrace, with its promise of renewed life, also carries a threat of annihilation, recalling Edvard Munch's graphic series, "The Kiss," in which the faces of two lovers are absorbed into one blank.24 The Law- rentian male must always struggle to preserve a core of integral being; he desires union with the unknown, yet fears absorption in woman: Then again, what was agony to him, with one hand lightly resting on his arm, she leaned forward a little, and with a strange, primeval suggestion of embrace, held him her mouth. It was ugly-beautiful, and he could not bear it. He put his mouth on hers, and slowly, slowly the response came, gathering force and passion, till it seemed to him she was thundering at him till he could bear no more. He drew away, white, unbreathing. Only, in his blue eyes, was some- thing of himself concentrated. And in her eyes was a little smile upon a black void. (43) It is the woman's prerogative to accept or reject the man who comes to her in fear and desire to seek fulfilment. Woman, in The Rainbow, is creator and destroyer, so that sex becomes apocalyptic. Munch seems to have shared Law- rence's ambivalence towards woman: in his "Madonna," a mythic image of woman is shown at the moment of conception.25 Her ecstasy brings the soul of man into being, giving birth to death as well as life. Munch underlined the theme by painting a trail of sperm around the red frame and a skeletal embryo in one 24 See Werner Timm, The Graphic Art of Edvard Munch, trans.

Lawrence's Madonna has "a little smile upon a black void"; Munch's has a blood-red halo. Unnatural intensity, chemical imagery, and incremental repetition give the kisses of Will and Anna (112, 120), and Anton and Ursula (320, 446-47, 479) an increasingly obsessional quality: "She took him in the kiss, hard her kiss seized upon him, hard and fierce and burning corrosive as the moonlight" (320). On the surface, this hardly seems like a confrontation between human beings. Lawrence's imagery of "corrosive salt" and "soft iron" keeps the focus on the allotropic interaction itself. There is a dialectical progression from the absorptive kiss of Tom and Lydia to this sadomasochistic embrace. Ursula offers herself to night and moon, identifying her being with theirs, so that her kiss burns Anton, who is alienated from these sources of natural energy. Nothing in himself, he tries to match his personal "spell" or "influence" (329) against the "magnificent godly moon" and "the blond, debonair presence of the night" (322), and his inevitable failure is a failure to be. In their final embrace, Ursula is metamor- phosed into Woman-as-harpy-or-sphinx: "Then there in the great flare of light, she clinched hold of him, hard, as if suddenly she had the strength of destruction, she fastened her arms round him and tightened him in her grip, whilst her mouth sought his in a hard, rending, ever-increasing kiss, till his body was powerless in her grip, his heart melted in fear from the fierce, beaked, harpy's kiss" (479). The sexual anxieties expressed in this scene find graphic illustration in Munch's "Vampire" (1895), which shows a woman crouched over a man's bent neck; in "Lovers in the Waves" (1896), in which a man is entangled in a woman's hair; or in the horrendous "Harpy" (1900).26 Certainly Lawrence's accent here is on sexual neurosis: "The fight, the struggle for consummation was terrible. It lasted till it was agony to his soul, till he succumbed, till he gave way as if dead, lay with his face buried, partly in her hair, partly in the sand, motionless . ." (479). This is followed by a tableau vivant as stark as any graphic image by Munch: Her face lay like an image in the moonlight, the eyes wide open, rigid. But out of the eyes, slowly, there rolled a tear, that glittered in the moonlight as it ran down her cheek. He felt as if the knife were being pushed into his already dead body. With head strained back, he watched, drawn tense, for some minutes, watched the unaltering, rigid face like metal in the moonlight, the fixed unseeing eye, in which slowly the water gathered, shook with glittering moonlight, then sur- charged, brimmed over and ran trickling, a tear with its burden of moonlight, into the darkness, to fall in the sand.

STEWARTILAWRENCE AS EXPRESSIONIST grotesque, although it is psychologically justified by Skrebensky's transfixed state of horror. In the three moon scenes, with their dialectical progression from equilibrium through disequilibrium to destruction, Lawrence's visual imagery and verbal rhythms are the expressive enactment of symbolic ritual. The first scene ritualizes the courtship of Will and Anna, relating their experience to age-old rhythms of sex and fertility, until they become those rhythms, losing personal identity. Expressionism prefers to deal with archetypes-suffering, sickness, death, pas- sion, puberty, jealousy, anxiety, ecstasy-rather than with individuals; for Lawrence, the hero of any great novel is "Not any of the characters, but some unnamed and nameless flame behind them all. ... If you are too personal, too human, the flicker fades out. ... . 27 Here was the problem for Munch as for Lawrence: how to develop a system of expression strong enough to penetrate the individual unconscious, and yet transcend the separate psyche. Nature is witness to actions that incorporate human life in cycles of seedtime and harvest,28 and the scene glows with a transcendent livingness, as does Munch's "White Night." 29 This space, with its division into moonlight and shadow, prostrate and erect, is set like a stage for the "coming and going" of the lovers-a "pulsing, frictional to-and-fro which works up to culmination" in their embrace, as it does in Lawrence's style.30 Animism takes on sacramental overtones: "Trees stood vaguely at their distance, as if waiting like heralds, for the signal to approach. In this space of vague crystal her heart seemed like a bell ringing" (117). Anna, initiate in the symbolic action, is responding to an "in- human will" that seeks expression through her. In offering herself to the Moon, she resembles a priestess of Diana or Astarte performing magical fertility rites. Will is a passive instrument of the life-force, who serves her "dutifully," until "a low, deep-sounding will in him" (118)-not his own-begins to "vibrate." As in primitive religious ritual, the rhythm of his being is transmuted into the impersonal rhythms of nature. He no longer draws on his own limited resources, but vibrates in unison with the source of all cosmic energy. These natural rhythms have a spellbinding effect, causing loss of self and potential liberation of being: "There was only the moving to and fro in the moonlight, engrossed, the swinging in the silence, that was marked only by the splash of sheaves, and silence, and a splash of sheaves" (119). Rhythm becomes meaning here, for the verbal rhythms are not so much the mimetic image of actions, as the direct expression of a fully charged state of being. The intensity and rapture of the scene-"How can you tell the dancer from the dance?"-derive not from surface impressionism, but from visionary expressionism that merges human and cosmic. The reenactment of these rites in language recalls the rhythmic brushwork of 27 "The Novel," Phoenix II, ed. Warren Roberts and Harry T. Moore (New York: Viking Compass, 1970), p. 419. 28 See A. M.

Van Gogh "longed for the night atmosphere, the stars, and the moonlight," says A. M. Hammacher, "for in this way his links with the primeval, nocturnal life forces gained symbolic expression." 31 Paintings like "Starry Night" and "Road with Cypresses" 32 are remarkable for their lunar and spiral symbolism.33 According to Hammacher (160), "the image of the stars at night and of the harvests . . . had gained a hold on [Van Gogh's] creativity." Similarly, Lawrence's creative impulses were galvanized almost to madness by the moon. Jessie Chambers recalls that "some dark power seemed to take posses- sion of Lawrence, and when the final beauty of the moonrise broke upon us, something seemed to explode inside him . . . his words were wild, and he appeared to be in great distress of mind, and possibly also of body." 34 On another occasion, he "created an atmosphere not of death . . . but of an utter negation of life, as though he had become dehumanized" (128). Jessie was aware of an inner conflict in Lawrence, parallel to the split in Ursula between Dionysian being and personal self. In Lawrence, as in Van Gogh, the systole and diastole of creativity seems to have involved "a struggle against destructive forces": in Van Gogh's last paintings, "space as such gives way to an almost demonic expressiveness" (Hammacher, 122, 159). Anna, who sees "the moonlight flash question on [Will's] face" (118), seems to respond to the moon rather than the man, just as he embraces an essence, a potentiality, rather than a woman: "All the moonlight upon her, all the darkness within her! All the night in his arms, darkness and shine, he possessed of it all! All the night for him now, to unfold, to venture within, all the mystery to be entered, all the discovery to be made" (119). This is more than eroticism: it is what Alois Riegl calls the "profound religious excitement" of expressionism.35 "He looked through her hair at the moon, which seemed to swim liquid-bright" (120; my italics). An analogy might be made here with Munch's "Man's Head in Woman's Hair," 36 but the immediate connection is with the earlier scene, in which Tom is struck by "the terror of a moon running liquid-brilliant into the open for a moment . . ." (44; my italics). Exposure to moonlight-a symbol of female anima-becomes more devastating in successive phases, culminating in Anton's destruction as a sexual being. It is space, rhythm, and the unknown, rather than personal psychology, that make the dynamics of such scenes. The second moonlight scene, between Anton and Ursula, is remarkable for its preternatural intensity, matching Van Gogh's tormented visions of nature: 31 A. M. Hammacher, Genius and Disaster: The Ten Creative Years of Vincent Van Gogh (New York: Abrams, n.d.), p. 83. 32 De la Faille, p. 427, F612; Hammacher, p. 135. 33 Hammacher says that "the spiral is a primeval symbol of movement, which does not belong to sun- worshiping but to the sphere of the moon. It is the eternal cycle, which reveals itself in the fertility of woman, in agrarian life, and in the four seasons" (p. 160). 34 E.T., D. H.

STEWARTILAWRENCE AS EXPRESSIONIST The darkness seemed to breathe like the sides of some great beast, the hay- stacks loomed half-revealed, a crowd of them, a dark, fecund lair just behind. Waves of delirious darkness ran through her soul. . . . She wanted to reach and be amongst the flashing stars. . . . She was mad to be gone. It was as if a hound was straining on the leash, ready to hurl itself after a nameless quarry into the dark. And she was the quarry, and she was also the hound. The darkness was passionate and breathing with immense, unperceived heaving. It was waiting to receive her in her flight. . . . She must leap from the known into the unknown. Her feet and hands beat like a madness, her breast strained as if in bonds. (315-16) Expressionism such as this involves transformation of reality, and the supremacy of imagination over nature-Coleridge's "esemplastic power." Thus Franz Marc, while affirming that expressionists "wrest [their forms] from nature," which "glows in [their] paintings," points out that "there is something which is not quite nature but rather the mastery and interpretation of nature: art. . . . The bridge across to the realm of the spirit, the necromancy of humanity." 37 At times the dislocation of natural perception may resemble hallucination or madness, a "dereglement de tous les sens." This almost schizophrenic intensity, bordering on dreams or nightmare, is characteristic of expressionism. Inward and outward rhythms-Ursula's excitement, the music and movement of the dance-merge in the image of waves, as separate identities submerge in "the deep underwater of the dance" (316). Once more depersonalization is the prelude to transpersonal experience, as the lovers become "one dual movement, dancing on the slippery grass. It would be endless, this movement. ... It was a glaucous, intertwining, delicious flux and contest in flux. They were both ab- sorbed into a profound silence, into a deep, fluid underwater energy . . ." (316). Despite insidious hints of absorption, the transition is chiefly from consciousness into a rapt state of being. Religious ritualists and expressionist painters were attracted to dance for similar reasons. "What Nolde looked for in dancing was above all a rapt, total surrender to bodily expression; in this most primitive aspect of the dance, man himself appeared to him as a primeval being." 38 Law- rence's supple expressionist prose conveys currents of unconscious being, that are felt but never rationalized. This is what Kirchner meant when he said: "religious sensuality in art is an instinct of nature . . . [that] can never be schematized." 39 Religious sensuality (of which Anna's naked dance before the Lord is a literal example) is a key to allotropic expressionism in The Rainbow. In "New Mexico," Lawrence describes his physical sense of religion in primitive dances: "For religion is . . . an uncontrollable sensual experience, even more so 37 Quoted in Wolf-Dieter Dube, Expressionism, trans.

Personal subjects disappear, absorbed in a groundswell of sensation: There was a wonderful rocking of the darkness, slowly, a great, slow swinging of the whole night, with the music playing lightly on the surface, making the strange, ecstatic, rippling on the surface of the dance, but underneath only one great flood heaving slowly backwards to the verge of oblivion, slowly forward to the other verge, the heart sweeping along each time, and tightening with anguish as the limit was reached, and the movement, at crises, turned and swept back. (316-17) Outside of the expressionist dance of Isadora Duncan and Mary Wignam41 (at whose studios Kirchner and Nolde made sketches), the closest analogy to such verbal rhythms would be the brushstrokes of Van Gogh, Munch, Kirchner, or Nolde. The Russian painter, K. Malewich, says of Van Gogh's kinetic form: "He saw that everything trembles as the result of a simple, universal movement. . . .[I]t was as if a current passed through every growth, and their form made contact with world-unity. . . . Van Gogh separated the textural waves from the object, the latter being for him only form, saturated with a maximum of dynamic power." 42 In expressing the rhythms of the dance as an oscillation of surface and depths, Lawrence abstracts a "universal movement" out of multiplicity. A high level of abstraction from phenomena of motion is characteristic of some forms of expressionism,43 as it is of futurism. The main distinction is that futur- ism tends to focus on mechanical phenomena (such as the speed of machines), while expressionism focuses on human emotive movement and gesture. The apocalyptic image of the flood (above) is linked with a rhythmic fluctuation of consciousness and the unconscious. Thus the motor sensation of the dance-at once religious, sexual, and emotional-becomes a metaphor of being. Out of this deep, trancelike rhythm, a new awareness develops in Ursula, which might be called "moon-consciousness." In this state of animism, she gives herself to a non-human source of energy: She turned, and saw a great white moon looking at her over the hill. And her breast opened to it, she was cleaved like a transparent jewel to its light. She stood filled with the full moon, offering herself. Her two breasts opened to 40 Phoenix, p. 144. 41 Mary Wignam was a student of Jacques-Dalcroze, whose eurhythmic dance movements are performed by Gudrun in a highly expressionist scene in Women in Love (pp. 157-58). 42 Quoted in A. M. Hammacher, "Van Gogh and the Words," in de la Faille, p. 23. 43 Kirchner, quoted in Dube, p. 38, writes: "I needed to invent a technique of grasping everything while it was in motion." 306</page><page sequence="12">JACK F. STEWART LAWRENCE AS EXPRESSIONIST make way for it, her body opened wide like a quivering anemone, a soft, dilated invitation touched by the moon. She wanted the moon to fill in to her, she wanted more, more communion with the moon, consummation. (317) The moon is the transcendent force of Eros that transforms sexual into spiritual energy, and offers fullness of being. Skrebensky, who cannot share in this pan- theistic communion, is a clog on Ursula's spirit. In her quest for "pure being," she becomes "a pillar of salt" to her lover, who cannot transcend the narrow bounds of ego. The struggle merely exacerbates the neurotic will that prevents his letting go. Lawrence here creates a visual world that is distorted-or "trans- figured"-by the intensity of emotion: "They went towards the stackyard. There he saw, with something like terror, the great new stacks of corn glistening and gleaming transfigured, silvery and present under the night-blue sky, throwing dark, substantial shadows, but themselves majestic and dimly present. She, like glimmering gossamer, seemed to burn among them, as they rose like cold fires to the silvery-bluish air" (319). In this moonlit arena, Skrebensky faces the fires of transfiguration, among which Ursula is a silvery flame. The symbolic scene is a painter's composition in blue and silver, but it is no Whistler "Nocturne." It looks beyond Monet's "Haystacks" 44 to the contorted burning world of Van Gogh's "Starry Night," or the serene but eerie glow of Munch's "Starlit Night" or "White Night." 4 There is an element of expressionist abstraction in such scenes, as man and woman merge into polarized forces of light and darkness: "She seemed a beam of gleaming power. ... He waited there beside her like a shadow which she wanted to dissipate, destroy as the moonlight destroys a darkness . . ." (319). The tension that oversensitizes Skrebensky, so that "The stack stung him keenly with a thousand cold, sharp flames," hardens Ursula into "salt, compact bril- liance" (319). The struggle that follows is expressed in a cluster of images-of salt corroding iron, dissolving, crystallizing, annihilating-that suggests the slow but violent interaction of chemical agents, one of which is bound to disintegrate the other. Here Lawrence adapts the futurist aesthetic to his own brand of spirit- ual expressionism-"Nature is never seen like this, but it may be experienced like this." 46 The stackyard scene is so non-natural that when Ursula comes back to "daylight consciousness" she thinks she has been "possessed." Lawrence's expressionism takes on apocalyptic overtones in the third and final moon scene (476-80). Once more Ursula undergoes a strange allotropic state; this time she casts off Skrebensky and destroys the incubus of personal self. Lawrence's rhetoric is hypnotic, with incremental repetition of phenomenological images-"electric fire," "salt burning," "incandescent," "metallic"-while the 44 Monet's "Haystacks in the Snow," at the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, is the painting I have in mind here. 46 Hodin, Munch, p. 69, PI. 49; p. 104, P1. 74.

She vibrated like a jet of electric, firm fluid in response" (477). The language here involves abstraction from physical sensuality to a chemico-erotic essence. The phenomena of sexuality may be universal, but Lawrence's expres- sionist rendering of "allotropic states" brings a new note of transpersonality into the novel. Such mysticism is a recurring aspect of expressionism:48 "Then a yearning for something unknown came over her. . . . The salt, bitter passion of the sea, its indifference to the earth, its swinging, definite motion, its strength, its attack, and its salt burning, seemed to provoke her to a pitch of madness, tantalizing her with vast suggestions of fulfilment" (477). Skrebensky is a feeble "personification" of Ursula's desires, for she is reaching for infinity. Lawrence forces the verbal medium to convey an experience that is irrational, ecstatic, and wordless. The power of the unconscious irradiates his style,49 and there is a primitive sense of live forces in nature challenging human lives: Suddenly . .. Ursula lifted her head, and shrank back, momentarily frightened. There was a great whiteness confronting her, the moon was incandescent as a round furnace door, out of which came the high blast of moonlight, over the seaward half of the world, a dazzling, terrifying glare of white light .... [Skrebensky] felt his chest laid bare, where the secret was heavily hidden. He felt himself fusing down to nothingness, like a bead that rapidly disappears in an incandescent flame. (478) The biblical symbol of the furnace harks back to "Anna Victrix" (193), where Anna offers up the infant Ursula as a living sacrifice to the fires of regeneration. Now Ursula "seem[s] to melt into the glare, towards the moon," while Skreben- sky is consumed and turned to ash.50 There is an utter disequilibrium between her moon-conscious being and his self-conscious ego. The spiritual intensity of moon-consciousness is balanced against the physical intensity of blood-consciousness. Anton returns from Africa inoculated with a dark sensuality. The word "darkness" (or "dark") recurs a total of sixty-four times in eight pages (445-52). The rhetorical patterns express rhythms and im- 47 Sokel finds "in Expressionism the Dionysian roots of vitalism . . ." (p. 87). 48 Cf. Myers, p. 98. 49 Paul Klee, in Thinking Eye, writes: "The chosen artists are those who dig down close to the secret source where the primal law feeds the forces of development. What artist would not like to live where the central organ of all space-time motion . . . activates all functions? In the womb of nature, in the primal ground of creation, where the secret key to all things lies hidden?" (p. 93). One such artist is Nolde, of whose work Haftmann says: "It is an art at the mercy of a dark stream of images, whose sources remain lost in an altogether unverifiable domain, deep underground. ... It is rooted in the depths of the unconscious mind, and is at home in regions where myth is born in the whisper of primeval memories" (p. 38). 60 See Munch, "Ashes II," in Timm, P1. 76. 308</page><page sequence="14">JACK F. STEWARTILAWRENCE AS EXPRESSIONIST pulses of blood-consciousness, culminating in the couple's first sexual union. In this context, the key terms-"darkness," "vibration," "fecund," "nucleus," "potent"-pulsate with combined associations of the unconscious. The motifs of animalization, vibration, and darkness strike an expressionist note. Franz Marc, for instance, sought to immerse himself in a religion of nature, whose medium would be the "'Animalization' of art." "I try to intensify my sensitivity," he wrote, "for the organic rhythm of all things; I seek pantheist empathy with the vibration and flow of the blood of nature-in the trees, in the animals, in the air."51 Lawrence also cultivated "pantheistic sensuality"; Ursula's image of hound-and-quarry (316, quoted above) reflects the mystical sensitivity to animate nature that Lawrence explores in "Pan in America." 52 The conscious primitivism of this essay is close to Gauguin's and Van Gogh's stress "upon the deep layer of the psyche in direct communion with nature and the sources of all myth"-a line of development that led to the Fauves ("Wild Beasts"), and to expressionists like Nolde, "who was by temperament inclined to a pantheistic, mythological view of nature. .. ."53 Like Lawrence and Marc, Nolde was a visionary pantheist: "'I had an infinite number of visions . . . for wherever I turned my eyes nature, the sky, the clouds were alive; in each stone and in the branches of every tree, everywhere, my figures stirred and lived their still or wildly animated life . . .'" (Haftmann, 19). Nolde was, in some ways, akin to Lawrence. "In his innermost being," writes Haftmann, "there was a savage need to embrace life passionately and a fervent desire to possess reality: he was extraordinarily sensitive to the Panic element in nature." There was even in Nolde a Lawrentian duality "between the demonic and the spiritual, the chthonic and the numinous, the earthly and the supernatural . ." (11-12)-a duality that lies behind the blood-conscious and moon-conscious scenes in The Rainbow. Animalism, primitivism, and universalism are key expressionist elements in the post-African courtship: He burned up, he caught fire and became splendid, royal, something like a tiger. She caught his brilliant, burnished glamour. Her heart and her soul were shut away fast down below, hidden. She was free of them. She was to have her satisfaction. She became proud and erect, like a flower. . . . She was no mere Ursula Brangwen. She was Woman, she was the whole of Woman in the human order. All-containing, universal, how should she be limited to individuality? (444) This expansion from individual to archetype is a hallmark of expressionism. The "profound darkness" is a sentient substratum of being, while the river is also an archetypal symbol of the unconscious: "Dark water flowing in silence through 51 Quoted in Selz, p. 201. 52 Phoenix, pp. 22-31. 63 Haftmann, Nolde, p. 10. 309</page><page sequence="15">NOVELISPRING 1980 the big, restless night made her feel wild" (445). This sensitivity to the uncon- scious is allied with the expressionists' empathy for the primitive.54 Thus, in Women in Love, Birkin copies a drawing of geese, in order to discover "what centres [the Chinese artists] live from-what they perceive and feel- . . . the curious bitter stinging heat of a goose's blood, entering their own blood like an inoculation of corruptive fire- . . . the lotus mystery" (81-82). Lawrence sought empathy with "the blood of nature," not only "in the trees, in the animals, in the air," but in the ebb and flow of human relationships.55 Skrebensky, then, draws strength from an influx of blood-consciousness. To Ursula, he is no longer a man, but "a voice out of the darkness" (446), and ultimately "a dark, powerful vibration that encompassed her" (451). His capacity for regression allows him to become a mere channel of the life-force: "Gradually he transferred to her the hot, fecund darkness that possessed his own blood" (446). Again the style modulates into pure expressionism, as darkness, vibration, and fecundity become the true subject: "A turgid, teeming night, heavy with fecundity in which every molecule of matter grew big with increase, secretly urgent with fecund desire, seemed to come to pass. . . . Her limbs were rich and tense, she felt they must be vibrating with a low, profound vibration. . . . The deep vibration of the darkness could only be felt, not heard" (446). Here Law- rence's style, with its rhythmic repetitions, becomes fully expressive of the ani- mated universe of desire and procreation. The sound and rhythm of the words, with their bewildering patterns overlapping, clustering, dissolving, ebbing and flowing, enhance the hypnotic, passional sense of touch: Darkness cleaving to darkness, she hung close to him, pressed herself into the soft flow of his kiss . .. , herself covered and enveloped in the warm, fecund flow of his kiss, that travelled over her, flowed over her, covered her, flowed over the last fibre of her, so they were one stream, one dark fecundity .... So they stood in the utter, dark kiss, that triumphed over them both, sub- jected them, knitted them into one fecund nucleus of the fluid darkness. (447) Movement within a still frame is created by wavelike series of verb phrases that give a sense of inner pulsation. Volatile restlessness is typical of expressionist and futurist art. But, in the words of a Taoist text: "Only when there is stillness in movement can the spiritual rhythm appear which pervades heaven and earth." 56 54 On the primitive, see Marc, quoted in Myers, p. 177; August Macke, in Selz, p. 220; and Nolde, ibid., p. 290. Wilhelm Worringer's Abstraction and Empathy (1908) encouraged those artists who distorted the natural to fit the subjective forms of their imagination. Lawrence relates to the empathic phase of expres- sionism, rather than to the abstractionist phase pioneered by Kandinsky. Yet he would have endorsed Kandinsky's "principle of internal necessity" (Concerning the Spiritual in Art [1912; rpt. New York: Wittenborn, Schultz, 1947], p. 47). 55 In "The Novel" (Phoenix II, p. 420), he says the quick of life "seems to consist in an odd sort of fluid, changing, grotesque or beautiful relatedness." 6" Quoted in Fritjof Capra, "The Tao of Physics: Reflections on the Cosmic Dance," Saturday Review, 10 December 1977, p. 23.

STEWARTILAWRENCE AS EXPRESSIONIST Lawrence's "to-and-fro" style works towards this mystic state of equilibrium. The analogy with painting is interesting: "From a point of stability in the estab- lished picture plane, [the expressionist] creates his plastic rhythm, backward and forward, with the materials of volume, plane, color, and texture. Usually there is a dominant path of movement varied with oscillations in smaller measure. . . ." 57 The analogies with biology and atomic physics are also interesting. Lawrence's "futuristic" emphasis on the molecular and nuclear is an adaptation of Marinetti's "intuitive physiology of matter" to human phenomena. The lovers are the sen- tient "nucleus" of a teeming world of matter; in a kind of reciprocal rapture, natural energy comes to consciousness in them, as they lapse out into a sea of energy. This is the sense of the term "nucleolating": the lovers become the quick of creative sexual energies that gather towards expression in them. The image of the nucleus is established a few pages earlier, as Ursula examines "some special stuff" in the laboratory. Reacting to the aptly named Dr. Frankstone's argument that life is only matter, Ursula studies the organism intently, sees "the gleam of its nucleus," and reflects on the "will" that "nodalised" its functions (441). Sud- denly, she has an epiphany: . . . the world gleamed strangely, with an intense light, like the nucleus of the creature under the microscope. . . . She could not understand what it all was. She only knew that it was not limited mechanical energy, not mere pur- pose of self-preservation and self-assertion. It was a consummation, a being infinite. Self was a oneness with the infinite. To be oneself was a supreme, gleaming triumph of infinity. (441) In a recent article on the "spiritual" quality of matter, Fritjof Capra describes the dance of electrons around a nucleus, and observes: "Modern physics thus pictures matter as being in a continuous dancing and vibrating motion. ... But this is also the way in which the Eastern mystics see the material world. They all emphasize that the universe has to be grasped dynamically as it moves, vibrates, and dances; that nature is not in a static equilibrium, but that it is in a dynamic one." 58 Skrebensky cannot share this vision of unlimited being because he has accepted a finite identity. In such hollow men, we see materialization of the spirit; in Lawrence and the expressionists, "spiritualization of matter." "Is everything material-or everything spiritual?" asks Kandinsky.59 Neither, Law- rence would reply, for the Rainbow symbolizes a fusion of physical and spiritual in a new form of being. 67 Sheldon Cheney, Expressionism in Art (1934; rpt.

To Ursula, who goes about in "sensual sub-consciousness," "her eyes dilated and shining like the eyes of a wild animal," being is "a dark, blind, eager wave urging blindly forward . . ." (448). Expressionism reveals undercurrents of "potential darkness" that lie be- hind the social facade. The intensity of Ursula's experience leads to grotesque distortions of the normal. She sees the animal behind the social mask,60 and trans- forms a respectable professor into "a lurking, blood-snuffing creature with eyes peering out of the jungle darkness, sniffing for [his] desires" (448). Skrebensky, sharing this reductive vitalism, sees "the stiff goat's legs" and "puppet-action" of the citizens around him. The "animalization" of the lovers themselves runs throughout this passage. Both are compared to leopards, but Ursula's freedom is potent and positive, while Skrebensky's is irresponsible and negative. His animal identity wavers from lion to tiger to leopard, while the image of the cage suggests that his freedom is a mere interlude (he is on leave from the army) and that the patriarchal world will claim him again (as it does when he marries his colonel's daughter). Thus expressionist "animalization" need not involve a total blurring of character distinctions.61 The motifs of vibration and darkness culminate in an expressionistic rendering of the sex act. It is the spiritualization of the physical that marks this passage as essentially Lawrence: "She was caught up, entangled in the powerful vibration of the night. The man, what was he?-a dark, powerful vibration that encompassed her. She passed away as on a dark wind, far, far away, into the pristine darkness of paradise, into the original immortality" (451). This spiritualization puts Ursula in touch with her "permanent self," whose language is mystical-expressionist. The invisible underworld of blood-consciousness contrasts with the visual upper world on which feelings can be directly projected. After the lovers have spent a night on the Downs, Lawrence describes dawn flooding up over the horizon: The rose hovered and quivered, burned, fused to flame, to a transient red, while the yellow urged out in great waves, thrown from the ever-increasing fountain, great waves of yellow flinging into the sky, scattering its spray over the darkness, which became bluer and bluer, paler, till soon it would itself be a radiance, which had been darkness. The sun was coming. There was a quivering, a powerful terrifying swim of molten light. Then the molten source itself surged forth, revealing itself. The sun was in the sky, too powerful to look at. (465) This is much more than surface impressionism. It is a symbolic transformation 60 Cf. the art of James Ensor and George Grosz, as well as Nolde's "Masks" (1911). 61 J. Middleton Murry, reviewing Women in Love, in D. H. Lawrence: A Critical Anthology, ed. H. Coombes (Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin, 1973), unjustly complains that "man and woman are indistinguish- able as octopods in an aquarium tank" (p. 140). 312</page><page sequence="18">JACK F. STEWARTILAWRENCE AS EXPRESSIONIST of darkness into light, expressionistically rendered through harmonic succession of colors, clusters of verb and participial phrases, and the whole modulated movement of the long sentence, from tension to expansion to diffusion, followed by short declarative units. The sun is a living presence, just as the "living dark- ness" is. It is the source of all light, life, and energy, animistically perceived as by a Druid or Mithraic sun-worshipper. The religious sense of non-human energy, as opposed to mechanical human activity, is prophetically expressed: "everything was newly washed into being, in a flood of new, golden creation" (465). Ursula, moved to tears, is transfigured "in the refulgent light." The dawn scene has its closest analogy in painting. Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo from Aries: "Those who don't believe in this sun are real infidels." 62 His own passionate belief was expressed in "The Sower" (1888) which shows the round disc of the rising sun flooding earth and sky with energy.63 According to Frank Elgar, Van Gogh, in Aries, "was undertaking a rite such as the ancient sun-worshippers performed in their communion with the principle of light .... In every source of light he saw the heavenly sphere of flame," and it became a symbol of his own "impetuous creative force." 64 Nolde, whose landscapes, flowers, waves, and clouds radiate an intense visionary quality, likewise affirmed: "I believe in the sun and the moon, for I feel their influence. I believe that there is a fire blazing in the bowels of the earth and that it influences us mortals" (in Haftmann, 12). Like Van Gogh and Nolde, Lawrence believed passionately in sun and moon as vital forces. In Fantasia he writes: "the sun's quick is polar- ized in dynamic relation with the quick of life in all living things. . . . Likewise, as the sun is the great fiery, vivifying pole of the inanimate universe, the moon is the other pole, cold and keen and vivifying. . ." (184).65 The novel ends with two great apocalyptic scenes: Ursula's confrontation with the horses, and her vision of the Rainbow. Lawrence draws on his own instinctive animism to project Ursula's fears, first on the forest and then on the horses. To her disordered sensibility, the trees take on a magical, phallic presence as if threatening to enclose her (486). (These living trees recall Kirchner's "inner forest" paintings, with their sweeping verticals.) A "small, living seed of fear" is in Ursula's heart, distorting the shapes around her. Unconscious claustrophobic fears rise towards crisis in her, and she must project them outward. The horses are the stimulus that draws forth the latent content of her unconscious; these menacing creatures present a fusion of psychological and natural, subjective and archetypal: 62 Quoted in The World of Van Gogh, 1853-1890 (New York: Time-Life Books, n.d.), p. 100. 63 Ibid., p. 101 (detail); de la Faille, p. 234, F422. 64 Frank Elgar, Van Gogh: A Study of His Life and Work, trans. James Cleugh (New York: Praeger, 1966), p. 121. 65 In Apocalypse (1931; rpt. New York: Viking Compass, 1966), Lawrence says that "the sun has a great blazing consciousness" microcosmically reflected in "[my] little blazing consciousness" (p. 43). 313</page><page sequence="19">NOVEL SPRING 1980 But the horses had burst before her. In a sort of lightning of knowledge their movement travelled through her, the quiver and strain and thrust of their powerful flanks, as they burst before her and drew on, beyond. . . . She was aware of their breasts gripped, clenched narrow in a hold that never relaxed, she was aware of their red nostrils flaming with long endurance, and of their haunches, so rounded, so massive, pressing, pressing, pressing to burst the grip upon their breasts, pressing for ever till they went mad, running against the walls of time, and never bursting free. Their great haunches were smoothed and darkened with rain. But the darkness and wetness of rain could not put out the hard, urgent, massive fire that was locked within these flanks, never, never. (487) So strong are the inner tension, fear, and passion projected on to the horses, that they seem figures of nightmare or hallucination.66 The barrier between natural vision and unconscious imagery has broken down. Vivid images and incantatory rhythms become the medium of an intense, disordered state of being: "She was aware of the great flash of hoofs, a bluish, incandescent flash surrounding a hollow of darkness" (487). This irrational state of awareness is immediate as a dream. Ursula does not have to look at the horses: they materialize in all their horror and splendor in her psyche. The vision is non-natural in focus, with enlarge- ment and illumination of the most terrifying detail (the hoofs). Ursula obviously fears destruction by the forces unleashed upon, or within, her. Since the expres- sionist style renders a subjective response, it is impossible to measure the degree, if any, of objective menace. The horses exist, but they are also a traumatic objecti- fication of all the social and sexual pressures on Ursula (now pregnant), and a vengeful reflex of her own apocalyptic yearnings. The expressionist style empha- sizes force, mass, weight, speed, and chiaroscuro to convey emotion that springs from the unconscious. There is a clash of concentrating and dissolving wills, and of the elements of fire and water. Only by a desperate effort does Ursula finally evade the horses that seem to have her trapped. But the shock is cathartic, and she reaches the ground of her being, beyond all change. The final apocalyptic vision of the Rainbow is a superb piece of rhetoric, but it carries the full onus of Lawrence's biblical, psychological, and social prophecy, and thus expressionism is subordinated to more explicit symbolism. Ursula's religious quest, however, can be related to the expressionist quest for dynamic spiritual experience: "In everything she saw she grasped and groped to find the creation of the living God, instead of the old, hard barren form of bygone living" (494). This, too, is Lawrence's quest in that "one bright book of life," the novel.67 66 Cf. Henry Fuseli's "The Nightmare" (c. 1782, and 1790-91) (an early example of symbolist art) and Franz Marc's "Tower of Blue Horses" (1913)-which shows a rainbow in the background. 67 "Why the Novel Matters," Phoenix, p. 535. 514</page><page sequence="20">JACK F.
