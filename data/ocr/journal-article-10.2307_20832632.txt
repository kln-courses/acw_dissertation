<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARDS A HISTORIOGRAPHY OF PRE-HIJRAH ISLAM1 ISMAIL R. AL-FARUQI The Islamic ummah is a universal brotherhood under the moral law. It is universal in that all men, whatever their origin, race or colour, are potential members and no man may be excluded from it a priori. It is equally, and by consequence of this, universal in that geography poses for it neither threat nor relevance. Every corner of space is a potential and, we always hope, will become an integral part of Dar al-Isl?m. This is all well-known and a platitude. The universalism of the ummah in the other dimension, viz. the dimension of time, is not so wellknown and understood. It is the object of this paper to put the spotlight on a period of time, the pre-Hijrah, extending from the dawn of history to the Hijrah of the Prophet, with a view to incepting a serious, hitherto unknown to-Muslims, study of "its" Islam. Islam is usually said to have begun with the Prophet Muhammad (may God's peace and blessings be upon him). It is considered that it was he who received the Holy Qur'?n, who proclaimed God's religion in the Divine ipsissima verba, who launched the ummah on a glorious march in space-time. The institution of the Islamic &gt; calendar and its establishment as starting on the day the Prophet had set out to found the first Islamic community in Madinah, is the expression of this consciousness. Never before, so runs the implication, has Islam been a reality of history. Never before has there been a community consciously committed to its pursuit and realization. Pre-Hijrah was, therefore, bound to be a period of "ig norance, " of immorality and generally, of evil of every sort?in short, a genuine, all-round J?hiliyyah. Pre-Hijrah was said to be a time when Islam was not : that is a cause sufficient to indict anything ! Accordingly, our forefathers?muhaddith?n, historians, literati or 'ulama?deliberately applied themselves to the indictment of pre-Hijrah. Meccan pre-Hijrah furnished them with an arsenal of arguments which they hurled, with no mean relish, at all human pre-Hijrah history. The history of the Prophets was reduced to the Prophets' own, personal biographies, while the J?hiliyyah of</page><page sequence="2">66 ISMAIL R. AL-FARUQI Mecca became a fact of universal history. The darker the J?hiliyyah was painted, the brighter the advent of Islam through the Prophet Muhammad was supposed to be. Polyth?ism, stone-wor ship, tribalism, war, licence, egoism, commercialism, vanity, illustrated in the notorious annals of a Basus War, the cynicism of an Imru' al-Qays, the irresponsibility of an 'Abd al-Mutfalib in front of Abrahah,2 etc.?-all these were projected on to the whole canvas of pre-Hijrah. How could there have been, in this case, any reason to study pre-Hijrah ? And yet, there was a reason, though not a very substantial one ; namely, the insight the study of pre-Hijrah poetry afforded into the linguistic, syntactical and stylistic character of the lang uage of the Holy Qur'an. This peculiar advantage, pre-Hijrah continued to hold until T?h? Husayn directed against its poetry his devastating attack.3 Making masterly use of the modern tools of literary criticism, Tf?h? Husayn was able to shake the founda tions of our complacent acceptance of that poetry as pre-Hijrah, and advanced the thesis that it is the concoction of the great masters of Arabic of the first two or three centuries of the Hijrah. However modernistic T?h? Husayn s thinking may have been, the net result of his attack was quite conservative in that it made questionable any recourse to that poetry as informative on pre Hijrah. The facts of pre-Hijrah have thus become more elusive than ever. Neither did our forefathers feel the need to study that aspect of pre-Hijrah which constitutes the religious history of Judaism and Christianity. In the Holy Qur'?n, they read what seemed to them to be a ready-made answer to the question of what both Judaism and Christianity were or will be. Since the Holy QurSn had given the news-events of those religions, the Muslims thought there was no need to investigate their history. They undersood, or rather misunderstood, the narratives of the Holy Book as reporta tive accounts of the news of the Jewish and Christian past which, as ghayb, stood for ever removed from anybody's knowledge but which God had elucidated in the 'clear Arabic Qur?n."4 But God did not mean the Qur'?n to be primarily a record of historical events. Where He spoke of past events, it was in order to elicit from them a meaning for the present and the future. That the narratives of the Holy Book are "history" is beside the point God had wished to make. The meanings these narratives convey, on</page><page sequence="3">Towards a historiography of pre-hijrah Islam 67 the other hand, are of the essence. The Qur'?n itself tells us that event-reporting is subsidiary to the conveyance of meaning : "And all, we shall tell thee, of the news of the Prophets, that you may thereby convince your heart. In these news, there were brought to you truth, good counsel, and a reminder to those who believe."5 Instead of being inspired to seek the basic facta of ancient history which the Holy Qur'?n had interpreted, the Muslims were content to add to its narratives a drawn-out embroidery of detail. For this purpose, they pressed into service folk-tales and apocryphal stories current among Near Eastern pagans, Christians, Jews and others.6 The golden age of Islamic learning has not added anything to Muslim knowledge in this field. Among the learned, it must have been felt that the news-events of the Prophets (anb?\ akkb?r) and ancient history as a whole, were not a field in which they could exercise independent judgment. Neither can the Qur'?nic anba be contended, nor could the addenda of the muhaddith?n be verified. This has remained the state of Muslim ancient history learning to the present day. The Qur'?n's invitation to study the ancient times, dramatically issued in the Divine assertion that the history of the Prophets was other than their own so-called followers had claimed it to be, the most attractive bait for scholarly research ever offered, viz., the Qur'an's insistence that the records in Jewish and Christian possession were falsifications of the original7?all this was by-passed by the Muslims without whetting their otherwise insatiable appetite for learning and research. At the root of it all, stood the misunderstanding of the Qur'?nic narrative as khabar or naba. It is bad enough that more than a whole millennium had to pass before the spirit of the Holy Qur'?n inspired men to do such research. But it is all the worse for us Muslims that this Qur'?nic spirit has so far inspired not Muslim but Christian scholars. II In the early formative years of Christianity, Hyppolytus, Marcion, Beryllus, Theodor of Mopsuestia, Paul of Samosata and a host of other early Church Fathers, have said that the "Old Testament" is a falsified scripture though it contains a great deal that is genuine revelation.8 They spoke of a "veil" which prevents the contending Christian from penetrating to the truly divine therein ; and they called for an "Old Testament Criticism" that would sift the genuine from the spurious.9 Their contemporaries were utterly deaf to their call. Moreover, Western Christianity</page><page sequence="4">68 ISMA'?L R. AL-F?RUQI excommunicated and branded them as heretics. A few hundred years later, God confirmed the insight of these early Christians and proclaimed in the Holy Qur'?n that the Torah and the Bible had been tampered with.10 The Muslims were content to believe it but hardly applied themselves to a historical criticism of the Bible or any other ancient Near Eastern scripture. The Christian Reformation of the Sixteenth Century brought to the world a renewed interest in the Biblical text. In order to liberate the Christians from the grip of a power and money-hungry papacy, the Reformation had to liberate Christianity from the authority of the Church. It was for this purpose that it sought to re-establish the authority of the Biblical text.11 A great spur to Biblical study resulted ; and with the awakening of Western Europe, a number of Biblical sciences began to develop. The authority of the Bible, however, was no sooner established than it began to be overthrown.12 Its authority was based upon its status as verbatim revelation. But to the growing rationalism in science and ethics, the Bible's assertions appeared unacceptable.13 Accordingly, a new consciousness began to dawn on the Christian mind. The need began to be felt for a new theory of revelation which would transfer the Bible's authority from its letter to its meaning, and thus enable the Christian to reject the literal?which he could not accept?in favour of a figurative meaning which he sought to construct.14 But how to shake off the authority of the literal Bible puzzled all the liberals until the advent of Kuehnen, von Graf and Wellhausen in the last century. These were all German scholars who studied the Bible no less well than they studied the Holy Qur'?n. Their works on Islam and on the Holy Qur'?n are well-known. Intellectually, they fell under the influence of the Holy Qur'?n ; emotionally, under that of the Bible. To the historical and ethical problems that the Bible presented, they applied their Quranic bent of mind. Their deep study of the Holy Qur'?n had furnished them with the insighc that the Bible as it stood is not the word of God ; that although it does contain here and there passages of inestimable religious and ethical value and, therefore, of genuine revelation, it also contains many other passages which must be the work of non-divine, human hands. Hence, they concluded, in a line of thinking that is most certainly Qur'?nic, that the Biblical revelation must have been "edited," i.e., changed, added to, or suppressed by scribes of varying interests</page><page sequence="5">TOWARDS A HISTORIOGRAPHY OF PR?-HIJRAH ISLAM 69 and, therefore, of different ages. All this came to crystallization in the work of Julius Wellhausen. Together with von Graf by whose work he was guided, Wellhausen is the author of the four-strata-theory of the composi tion of the Bible. According to him, the Old Testament consists of intercalated materials, "J," "E " "D," "P," produced respectively by the Jahwist, Elohist, Deuteronomist and Priestly, editors of an old record of Hebrew religious literature.15 Thus, the divine word was distinguished from the work of these human, all-too-human hands and party-advocates, as the so-called overall meaning of the whole is from the particular ideas, propositions and phrases that compose it.16 The Bible, now become a human product, was then freely subjected to the most rigorous and creative criticism. For several generations, scholars have attempted one theory after another to explain away the historical, ethical and religious short comings of the Old Testament, and to corroborate its narratives with the new scientific, historical and archaeological data. The same criticism was applied to the New Testament. But here, where the heart of Christianity stood closer to the devastating rational criticism, Christian rationalism was forced into alliance with the irrational view that revelation is not merely the teaching of Jesus, but equally, that of the ancient Christians.17 The identity of these early Christians, that they are, among others, Paul of Ephesus rather than Paul of Samosata, Tertullian rather than Valentinus, Irenaeus rather than Marcion, etc., has remained an arbitrary decision to this day, in placation of that tradition which succeeded in establishing itself in Western Christendom and had since called itself "the Orthodoxy." We should not allow this inconsequence to dim the brightness of the overall achievement ; for it was a truly great accomplishment achieved by the Biblical scholar after centuries of torture and hard work. True, the great insight that the Bible was not the word of God verbatim was commonplace to the most ordinary Muslim who read it every day in the Holy Book. To the Christian, how ever, this insight was most perturbing. To become presentable at all (it is still struggling to become acceptable to the rank and file of Christians everywhere !) it had to be founded upon a merciless, rational, scientific criticism issuing from linguistic, syntactical, archaeological and historical research. This discipline came to be called "Biblical Criticism." It spurred and was in turn fed by the</page><page sequence="6">?SMA'IL R. AL-FARUQ? now independent disciplines of Semitic studies, Near Eastern archaeology and ancient history. The credit for this great enrich ment of human knowledge goes to both the Muslim and the Christian, but from different standpoints. The Muslim's common place information and divinely-issued proclamation furnished the moving inspiration and guidance ; the Christian's dissatisfaction with the Biblical letter and a century of incessant and untiring hard work and research furnished the requisite scientific data. Without Christian scholarship in these fields, Muslim knowledge would remain complacent and poor. Without the Qur'?nic idea, Christian scholarship would have remained separate from the Bible and, rather than endeavour to support it as it does so to-day, it would have had to overthrow the Christian faith itself, or face another, this time Protestant, inquisition. We may, therefore, say that the disciplines to which Biblical criticism gave rise and all their scholarly productions during the last hundred years con stitute the best footnotes ever written on the relevant Quranic proclamations. Ill Though for the most part these sciences and disciplines have been the handmaids of Christian religious pursuits, they have grown beyond these primitive needs and have now come to assume a place of their own in human culture and world literature. Any reputable bookstore or library in the West now offers a variety of Akkadian, Sumerian, Amoritic, Syriac, Aramic grammar and reading books. The religious and wisdom literature of the ancient Near East of the first, second and third millennia B.C., are commonplace readings in Christian scholarly quarters. The whole history of the ancient Near East has been constructed and reconstructed, written and rewritten. The Christian Biblical scholar and Western semiticist not only know far more about the ancient Near East than any Muslim but stand equipped with that knowledge to reconstruct history in such wise as the Christian, Western spirit dictates. For no matter how independent these sciences may have become, they are still subject to the higher categories of Western thought which Christian dogma influences in a serious measure. And it is here that we cannot remain spectators in this greatest drama of all ; namely, the attempt of the Western spirit to*appropriate, Westernize, and Christianize a whole segment of human history, perhaps of one of the most important segments</page><page sequence="7">TOWARDS A HISTORIOGRAPHY OF PRE-HIJRAH ISLAM 71 of the history of civilization and culture on earth. Furthermore, the men and women whose life-histories the Western scholar has been reshaping, whose religion and ideologies he has been reconstructing, are the Muslims' spiritual ancestors. They were the peoples who, precisely by their religion and their ideology, had paved the way for the advent of Islam.18 Nay, these men and women were the people who, as God Himself has told us, were hunafa and Muslims long before the Prophet Muhammad.19 They were the recipients of revelation from the one and true God of Muhammad.20 The Qur'?n further tells us that they were the recipients of essentially the same message as Muhammad. 1 How did we fail to seek their history and their religion ? How can we fail to be interested in the Christian reconstruction of that history and religion ? How can we allow the Christian scholar's knife to cut into the body of the pre-Hijrah Islamic tradition ? There is confronting us to-day a challenge as great as that which confronted our forefathers when they stood at the gates of Greek philosophy and science ; but with the added gravity that this concerns us far more closely than Greek knowledge could have ever done. Greek knowledge was a foreign development which we came to face from the outside. Though we have succeeded in Islamizing, appropriating and then developing it as Islamic knowledge, the truth remains that in its Greek development Greek knowledge was Greek. Ancient Near Eastern history, on the other hand, is Islamic history, though it is pre-Hijrah. We cannot allow it to be con structed in any manner. We must be the guardians and defenders of its worthy ideas, of its truths, because these were all Islamic. Supposing, for instance, we allow the Christian scholars to reconstruct, as they certainly seek to do, the decay of Israel and the spectacular array of prophets that accompanied it as a move ment of growth in Hebrew religious consciousness. The Christian dogma that God was operating the nexus of history and causing the decay in order that Hebrew consciousness may develop a Messiah expectancy and thus accommodate the advent of a Messiah such as Western Christianity regards Christ to be, stands very much to gain by this reconstruction.22 The truth, however, stands very much to lose. For the decay of Israel was not a blessed growth, but a condemnation, a real decay. The Prophets did not welcome it as a requisite for Messianism, but joined their voices to God's in</page><page sequence="8">72 ISMAIL R. AL-FARUQI condemning their fellow countrymen, the Jews, for their idolatry and misdeeds. The true reconstruction of Hebrew history should then illustrate the Divine principle that blessedness and prosperity befall the virtuous and doom befalls the evil. Likewise, the rise of Assyria and Babylon are regarded by the editor-scribes of the Old Testament as evil because they brought about Israel's destruction. But these were racialist nationalist, true to type. The Christian scholars regard the rise of Assyria and Babylon as a necessary evil because, they think, Israel had to be destroyed if a Messianism was to develop in which the advent of Jesus, as they understand him, could fit. The truth, however, suppressed in either case, is that the rise to power of these peoples was on a par with the rise of the Jewish kingdom itself ; that is to say, in both cases, God conferred upon them al-mulk (i.e., power, sovereignty and prosperity) as the necessary consequence of virtue and self-exertion in His cause. The implications of these interpretations for the advent of Muhammad and the finality of his Prophethood are most serious. There can be no place in history for the Holy Prophet if Near Eastern history is what Christian scholars claim it to be and if this claim of theirs is scientific, critical, rational, and hence, necessary truth. Necessary truth cannot be contended with articles of faith. If, as the Christian Semiticist claims, God has operated the nexus of events constituting Near Eastern history, to the end that a Messiah may fulfil the salvation that was awaited, then obviously the advent of Muhammad was superfluous. The truths of the Qur'?nic narratives must, by the Muslims' own intellectual and scholarly efforts, become the conclusions of systems of ideas, data, observations and deductions of defined scientific disciplines, not their a priori presuppositions as in the Christian case. For the Quranic narratives are interpretative statements of world events, the investigation, establishment and reconstruction of which is not the work of theology but of rational, critical science. IV It may perhaps be contended that the ancient Near Eastern peoples were not Muslims, that they were by no means related to the advent of Muhammad and of Islam as he proposed and taught it ; that the ancients were, above all, polytheists and pagans. How then, it is argued, can there be any resemblance, not to speak of identity, with Islam which is the religion of tawh?d ?</page><page sequence="9">TOWARDS A HISTORIOGRAPHY OF PRE-HIJRAH ISLAM 73 To begin with, it must be remarked that neither the contention nor its answer may be dogmatic. Both must presuppose a thorough knowledge of the thought of the ancients?which the Muslims do not as yet have. We cannot anymore call the ancient Near Easterners polytheists and pagans outright ; and if we carefully study them, we should be at least more humble and cautious than to indict them beforehand. We could be more true to our Islam if we remembered in this connection that "there is no people but God had sent it a warner,"23 and that this divinely issued warning is the very stuff of which religious thought consists.24 If we may not call the Jews, for instance, polytheists and pagans, it is not because they did not worship other gods?we know for certain that they did?but because of the presence among them of Prophets (i.e., warners) who called them to God's religion. The sound element in the tradition of Jewish religious thought consists entirely of these "warnings" of the prophets. It is nothing but uninstructed dogmatism to claim that the ancient Near Easterners did not have prophets, or men of spiritual insight as great as those of the Jewish prophets. Once more, it was the Holy Qur'?n that announced : "... And as for some Prophets, We have so far narrated to you their events ; but of other Prophets We have brought you no knowledge ... "25 If, on the other hand, the Qur'anic claim is interpreted as meaning not that, universally, all peoples have had a Prophet, but only those peoples?the so-called "Semites"?who shared together a single common spiritual heritage, we should observe that the peoples of the ancient Near East were precisely the "Semites" in question ; that they constituted a single family endowed with one common heritage. Spiritually, as well as linguistically and ethnically, they form but one stream of being. Their so-called "languages" were "brothers and sisters," as it were, members of the same family, whose father and mother are recognisably the language of which the Arabic of the Holy Qur'?n is the first, least-changed and best preserved descendant.26 Ethnically, they all stemmed from the Arabian Peninsula in waves of which the expansion of the first century of the Hijrah is only one among many,27 other waves being the entry into the Fertile Crescent of the Horeb (North Western Arabia) confederation of tribes of which the Prophet Moses was the leader and architect, and the Aramean, the Amoritic, the Akkadian expansions. More important, archaeology has</page><page sequence="10">74 ISMA'IL R. AL-FARUQ? discovered that they all shared the same treasure of folk-wisdom, of myth and legend, of aesthetic experience.28 And there remains yet to be established their community in ideology by piecing together the many pieces of evidence which all the "Semitic" disciplines have so far produced. Secondly, there is an essence to Islam which must be common to the Islam of Muhammad as well as to the spirituality of these early warners or Prophets. Otherwise, God would not have told us in the Quran that He had charged all the Prophets with the same message.29 This Islamic essence cannot obviously be the legal system of a Malik or a Sh?fi'i, nor the theology of an Ash'ari or a Ghaz?li. Indeed we cannot legitimately expect such an essence to be either the Qur'?n as crystallized conceptualization or the Sunnah of Muhammad as concrete figurization.30 That essence must, however, be identical with that of which the Qur'?n and the Sunnah of Muhammad are the conceptualization and figurization. Ancient Near Eastern spirituality has also come down to us conceptualized and figurized ; but it is not impossible to uncover its essence. Only then will it be possible to establish the identity of that essence with al-Lawh al-Mahf?z (the Eternal Tablet), of which the Qur'?n is the historical conceptualization, and the Sunnah, the historical figurization. If, on the other hand, we seek that identity on the level of conceptualization, and figurization, we are bound to be disappointed though we may be attracted by their many apparent similarities. Every conceptualization and figurization is historical; it must fit into the historical situation in which it came and by reference to which it can be comprehended. A Qur'?n-con ceptualized or Muhammad-figurized Sunnah would have been utterly incomprehensible to the Assyrians of the first, the Amontes of the second, the Akkadians of the third, or the Sumerians of the fourth and fifth millennia B.C. The very Prophets and warners who were charged with the conveyance of such a message, would have not only not understood it, but would have sounded very silly even to themselves.. Such a view further implies that God Himself, in doing this, was working in vain. The Islamic essence must, there fore, have consisted not in the conceptualizations but solely in the deepest presuppositions of all Islamic theology and ethics, in that of which the Qur'?n is the supreme conceptualization, in that of which the Muhammadan Sunnah is the ideal figurization. It is this essence that Muhammad (May God's peace and blessing be upon</page><page sequence="11">Towards a historiography of pre-hijrah islam 15 him) shared with Jesus, with the well-known Hebrew prophets as well as the anonymous Prophets of all times. In so far as this Islamic essence can be discovered in the literature of the ancients as well as in that of post-Hijrah Islam, it seems to consist primarily of the consciousness of transcendence. The constituents of this consciousness are four : First, that there is a transcendent realm ; that is to say, a realm totally other than our realm of experience and nature. Second, that the transcendent realm is not unrelated to this, but stands to it as the ideal which the real ought to become. From the transcendent realm, there issues an ought or command for this realm. Third, that this realm is essentially good and desirable as well as impressionable or improv able and, therefore, malleable into the pattern which the tran scendent realm furnishes. Fourth, the consciousness of transcendence implies the commitment of one's efficacy in the realm of real existence and the application of one's energies to the task of bringing about in this realm the realization of the ought-content of the transcendent. The consciousness of transcendence is never complete unless it issues in action, in the refashioning of space-time into the transcendental pattern. Thus, to possess the Islamic essence is lastly, but most importantly, to empty oneself into man and nature, to the end of recreating them as the transcendent realm wants them to be. It is this aspect that distinguishes Near Eastern spirituality from the Indian and the Greek. Whereas the Indian transcendent realm is inimical to this realm and is one for the sake of which this realm is to be abandoned, the Greek transcendent realm is only an idealized extension of the realm of man and nature ?an apotheosis. Only Near Eastern transcendence combines both a genuine otherness of the transcendent realm and its essential relevance for this world consisting in furnishing it with the commanding pattern of the ought. It may not be argued that our outline of this Islamic essence is deficient because it does not include the Prophethood of Muhammad. The divine message which Muhammad conveyed and which derives its normativeness from the Islamic essence which it realizes in ideal manner, certainly stands above the person of Muhammad. Islamic essence is Islamic despite its being pre Muhammad. For Islamicity, both logically and in respect of being, is prior to the person of Muhammad. We honour, revere and love Muhammad because of his Prophethood, because of the divinity of</page><page sequence="12">76 ISMA'IL R. AL-FARUQl the message he has conveyed and the perfection and finality of the form in which that message was delivered.31 Nor may it be argued that our definition of the Islamic essence is deficient because it does not include the unity of God. For it includes, without doubt, the unity of the transcendent realm, and this is precisely the unity of truth and of value which the unity of God really means. A unity of God divorced from the unity of truth and value and associated with a pluralism of truth and value, is not only not Islamic, but utterly worthless. Per contra, a unity of the tran scendent realm as truth and value, does not become invalidated by association with a pluralism of ideal beings. That it is not com patible with such pluralism is granted to the extent that our religious and moral senses have been so impressed with the Qur'?nic unitarianism that we find?as we certainly ought to?such association offensive. But it is not necessarily incompatible, or contradictory. For it is quite possible that the ancients have regarded these ideal beings as aspects of the Godhead, as personi fications of God's powers, as concretizations of Divine attributes. It requires a very advanced stage of intellectual sophistication to grasp, and then to maintain in consciousness, the being and meaning content of the idea of a transcendent Godhead. In the absence of such level of development, we may well conceive of the possibility of an association of the unity of the transcendent realm as truth and value, with a pluralism of "divine" beings. This is not to admit the possibility of polytheism ; nor to advance the Hindu's argument for the justification of his idolatry. There may have been a time when humanity as a whole was insufficiently mature to grasp unitarianism and keep it in consciousness. But in the prophecy of Abraham and the Prophets after him, pre-eminently in Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, human consciousness has moved, as concerns the unity of God, to a point of no return. "The advent of truth and the confounding of untruth (ja al-haqq wa zahaq al-batil, Holy Qur'?n, XVII : 81) is the expression of this human maturity. No man is hence free to deny transcendental unitarianism. All men are obliged to honour the Divine unity at whatever level of worldly education and instruction they may personally stand ; for the growth in question is a human growth the universality of which is not the mathematical but the dynamic ought-to-be-universality. Nor is this to grant to the gods, as the Meccan pagans had done, the metaphysical status and power which belongs exclusively to</page><page sequence="13">TOWARDS A HISTORIOGRAPHY OF PRE-HIjRAH ISLAM 77 God, Shirk, or associationism, which Islam condemns so emphati cally, is not merely the granting of transcendent "Dasein" to a plurality of beings, but the recognition of such beings as efficacious in, as commanding for and as relevant to, life. It is their efficacy, especially as intermediaries between God and man, as the notorious fabrication, &gt;j?J? ?rf-^U? &lt;jt had affirmed,32 that is condemned, and rightly so. Rather, this is an attempt to see in the Ancient Near Eastern pantheons what the pious ancient Near Easterner himself might have seen. For unless we grant that the many gods had a meaning and occupied a status essentially different from the One God, we would be compelled to accuse the Ancient Near Easterner of outright self-contradiction, and to force upon the ancient texts a meaning that is certainly not there. This would surely be an easy way out ; but it is neither imaginative nor fair. To illustrate this point, let us consider the Akkadian pantheon-theology and Hammurabi's law-ethics. V The old Akkadian "creation" epic called Enuma Elish*3 makes the gods recognize a One God to whom they owe allegiance, obedience and service. The poem further tells us that "the norms had been fixed" and so were "all their portents" ;34 that what is necessary is that ". .. mankind . . . make humble obeisance at the mention of His name."35 Indeed, this God is the gods' God too, whose very name it is their sacred duty to hallow. "As for us, the poet makes the gods say, 'by however many names we pronounce, He is our God. Let us then proclaim His fifty names'."36 Obviously, if this God is God to the gods, if they owe him worship, surely they cannot be just a plurality of Gods. Indeed, they are either personified powers and attributes of the Godhead whose "worship" or "service" consists in their performing God's will, or human beings who stand on a socially higher level than their human peers, as was wont to be the case in old feudal societies. Enuma Elish is, therefore, the evidence that the ancient Akkadians and those to whom they gave their civilization, culture and religion viz., the Sumerian and old Babylonian Empires as well as all the other "Semitic" peoples who inherited their legacy, were Islamic inasmuch as they recognized a transcendent realm other than this realm and understood it as the unity of truth and value. That the transcendent realm is relevant to this world to the</page><page sequence="14">78 ?SMA'lL k. AL-FARUQ? extent of furnishing for it the pattern in the likeness of which this world ought to be fashioned and moulded is quite evident in the Akkadian epic. "May He, 'it tells us explicitly,' cause...a likeness on earth of what He has wrought in heaven."37 The urge to go out, the commitment to mission, the superabundance of energy and will which compels the loss of oneself in the process of remoulding the universe became the presuppositions of the repeated outpourings of Akkadian humanity into the farthest corners of the Near East. Enuma Elish symbolizes this Akkadian ethical universalism by its repeated reference to "the black-headed ones" as recipients of the bounties of Marduk which Akkad brings.38 The "black-headed ones" were the Africans ; and their far-away lands meant for the Akkadians the ends of the earth, very much like China meant the end of the world in the opposite direction, to the Arabs of more recent times. The Islamicity of Akkad, therefore, is established inasmuch as Enuma Elish is evidence of its ideology. Later on, the same Islamicity was to be reaffirmed by the Amorites, a subsequent wave of self-outpouring from the Arabian Peninsula, under the leader ship of Hammurabi. Hammurabi rose to the challenge of crystalliz ing the ethical relevance of the Transcendent Godhead. Under him, ancient Near Eastern Islamicity gathered sufficient new momentum to attempt a fresh implementation of its ethical universalist dream. The new statement of Islamicity was certainly a growth, a dev elopment of the Akkadian spirit, which we may as little expect to find in Akkad as the monotheistic and ethical sophistication of the Hebrew Prophets could be expected in Hammurabi's code, as Christ's interiorization of the ethical fulcrum could be found in the Old Testament, or Qur'?nic ummatism in the message of Jesus. That there is a growth and development in the prophetic tradition is indubitable. But it does not mean total novelty. The substratum that grows, we must remember, is the presupposition of growth. Every new prophetic message had to define its relation to the previous revelations and then to build over their foundations and thus to push forward man's religious and ethical insight, his preparation to receive the revelatory "plus." This substratum is the Islamic essence. It is the consciousness of transcendence. It is exemplified in Hammurabi's life and conceptualized in legal form in his code. Our knowledge of Hammurabi stems mainly from his code of</page><page sequence="15">TOWARDS A HISTORIOGRAPHY OF PRE-HIJRAH ISLAM 79 law which, engraved in cuneiform on the famous black stela of Hammurabi, was discovered by de Morgan in 1901-2 at Susa in Iraq, The stela has come to Paris where it now stands with majestic repose at the Louvre. Hammurabi, the sixth of eleven kings in the old Babylonian Amoritic Dynasty ruled the Empire from 1728 to 1687 B.C. He was a righteous prince and his reign is characterized by a great aggrandizement and development of the empire, by peace, security and prosperity throughout its cities and provinces. His most famous act was the promulgation of the law which the black stela has preserved and archaeology has unearthed and deciphered. Hammurabi was Godhead-bound. His great deeds were com mitted for the sake of the Godhead, in obedience to the Godhead's direct and specific commands. In the prologue, he himself tells us that the transcendent realm (in this case the God) had "named him to promote the welfare of the people, to cause justice to prevail in the land, to destroy the wicked and the evil that the strong might not oppress the weak, (and) to rise like the sun . . . and . . . light up the land.1'39 A little later, he explains that he "established law and justice in the land, thereby promoting the welfare of the people" only "when Marduk commanded (him) ... to guide the people."40 He acknowledges with gratitude, that his justice prevails in the land only "by the order of Shamash" and that his statutes are respected only "by (i.e., for the sake of) the word of Marduk/'41 This shows that Hammurabi believed in a transcendent realm that is ethically relevant for this world. We should not be misled by his calling the Godhead by unfamiliar names, nor into supposing that two names really signify two gods. The important thing is that he recognized, first, that the Godhead is ; that this Godhead is other than this world, wholly beyond experience and nature, wholly transcendent ; and second, that this Godhead is not indifferent to this world but commands the good for all. The many gods are really Divine attributes, particularly as they are the patrons of specialized faculties not unlike those which an anthropomorphic theology would certainly find in the Divine Person.42 It has also been contended that Hammurabi was another dictator, who, though benign, regarded himself as the source of sovereignty and power in matters ethical. He, it is alleged, is the author of the law that carries his name.43 If established, such an accusation would greatly vitiate Hammurabi's Islamicity. The</page><page sequence="16">80 ISMA'IL R. AL-FARUQI gravity of this criticism becomes apparent when we remember that the whole point of believing in God is not merely in order to recognize His metaphysical existence, but in order to bend our selves to His divine will, to execute His command, there being no point in a God who is only a logical and metaphysical presupposi tion.44 For it is incontrovertible that the Islamic God is not indifferent to the world ; that as far as this world is concerned, man is the object of the most persistent Divine care, providence and concern. This is so much the case that where Divine concern for the world and man becomes questionable or compromised, God's very being becomes questionable and, indeed, may lose its meaning altogether.45 First, let us consider the graphic evidence of the stela. It shows Hammurabi on his knees receiving the scrolls of the law from Shamash, the first god of the Amoritic pantheon. If the contention is correct, the figure would have represented Hammurabi in the act of writing, or that of giving to his vassals, rather than in that of submissively receiving (symbolized by kneeling). Secondly, there is the internal evidence of the law itself. Here five arguments are in order : In the first place, for a god to approve the promulgation of a law is to assume responsibility therefor, regardless of whether the relation of the god to the law is one of verbatim dictation, ievelation, inspiration, post-formulation approval or any other. In the second place, throughout his very generous praise of himself in both prologue and epilogue Hammurabi never mentioned himself as the creator of the law but as "the administrator," the "rescuer," the "shepherd," the "warrior," the "protector," the "refounder of settlements," the "provider," the "subduer," the "saviour," etc. etc., who has done so many good deeds of justice, of reconstruction, of conquest, etc., and hence always as implementer and executor, never as creator, of the law. In the third place, the evidence that might be adduced in support of such a thesis, namely, that Hammurabi has called the code "my law," "my words," "my statutes" is inadmissible be cause it rests on the assumption that for the law to be of divine origin, express evidence is required that Hammurabi must have accepted it as the ipsissima verba of the god?which is futile to expect to find in Hammurabi's days. Fourthly, there is clear evidence in the text to the contrary. It establishes that Hammurabi's r?le was not one of creation but of "enactment" and</page><page sequence="17">Towards a historiography of pre-hijrah ?slam 81 execution. He identifies himself as "the king of justice to whom Shamash committed law"^ and who "bestirred himself for the word of Marduk his lord," and, by promulgating and enforcing the law, had "secured the triumph of Marduk above and below."47 Hammurabi threatens with curses the transgressor who abolishes "the law which I enacted." He never says, 'the law which I created/ as he might have said had he thought of himself as the author of the law. In the fifth place stands the argument that the sanctions of the code as a whole are not the kind that may be meted out by Hammurabi. Here all Hammurabi could say was to express the wish, "May Shamash, the mighty judge of heaven and earth," bless or curse, raise or destroy, bring happiness or in flict suffering and misery, etc.48 It is the most eloquent proof that the law is not a man-made, factitive work of Hammurabi or any other human, but that of the Godhead who alone can and does furnish the sanctions for its observance as a whole. The various sanctions of the specific provisions of the law are understandably Hammurabi's to mete out, or his governors' and vassal princes' who do it in his name. But the sanction for flouting the law generally issues from a source beyond Hammurabi and all his peers. None can have any authority over the sanctions relative to the acceptance or rejection of the law as a whole. These must issue in heaven whence the law itself originated. The nature of these sanctions cannot be specific in the sense in which those relative to the provisions of the law are. It is of their essence to remain general. They consist of happiness, well-being, blessedness and dominion, as reward for devotion to the law ; and of unhappiness, suffering, destruction and subjection, as punishment for its rejec tion. Here lies the root-idea from which the "covenant" was later to emerge and to become the ideology of the Hebrews. It is unfortunate for the Jews, the Hebrews' descendants, that their racialism carried this very ethical and deeply religious idea to an immoral, irrational and undivine "Promise" by which God binds Himself eternally and unilaterally to proffer His favours on them regardless of their ethical standards, their "stiffneckedness." their "idolatry," their "injustice and evil deed. '49 In broad outline, the hypothesis which man conceived of God as offering ran as follows : If you, man, perceive My command and realize it, I will bless you and cause you to prosper and be happy ; if you do not, I shall confirm you in your ignorance of the command and this by itself</page><page sequence="18">82 ISMAIL R. AL-FARUQI is the necessary parent of all evils which will then be visited upon you.' The whole gift which the Godhead is proffering to man is something man's relation to which can only be, first, one of cogni tive apprehension, and then, of determining man to realize what is appiehended.50 Thus, with Hammurabi, the absolute, other-worldly provenance and ought-producing character of the transcendent realm is rather more articulate and takes the express form of law issuing from heaven. That the relation to virtue is one of knowledge of the law, which was to occupy the Greek philosophers several centuries later and constitute in the Socratic formula of virtue=knowledge= happiness ; the apogee of Greek thought, is here expressed simply and clearly. Knowledge of and obedience to the law are one and the same process. So is the necessary connection of virtue with happiness constituting the content of the covenant-ideology of later centuries. Commissioned by the trancendent realm to promulgate its divine law, to realize its divine will in the world, Hammurabi entered upon a great empire-building and empire reorganization career. His ends were clearly religious in the highest sense of the term (namely, the remoulding of the whole world) on the divine pattern the transcendent realm had furnished. For this purpose, as well as for that of stabilizing, unifying and normalizing human behaviour, he promulgated the God-given law. We have no illusions that the actual formulations of all the specific sections of the law were the work and creation of Hammurabi or his jurists, his %ulama and fuqaha. But that Hammurabi did in fact regard the law as God-given, and that in fact its ethical precepts and overall meaning and spirit are Divine, is indubitable.51 Hammurabi, therefore, has fulfilled the essential requirements of Islamicity. Indeed, he has done so to a pre-eminent degree. The evidence for pre-Hijrah Islam which his case, as well as that of the Akkadian creation epic, readily furnish should arrest our overhasty condemnation of pre-Hijrah. It is hoped it has succeed ed in arousing the Muslim historians' interest to investigate this richest part of the human legacy. Such investigation would save Near Eastern pre-Hijrah history from the fact-corroding influence of the Christian dogmatic interpretation. Its greater significance, however, will be that of re-establishing that history as an integral part of the historical development of God's contact with man.</page><page sequence="19">TOWARDS A HISTORIOGRAPHY OF PRE-HIJRAH ISLAM 83 NOTES 1. A gist of this paper was read at the annual session of the Pakistan History Conference in Dacca, East Pakistan, on February 2,1962. 2. 'Abd al-Muttalib, leader of Mecca, addressed the invading Abrahah at the gates of Mecca in these terms : have come to ask you to return to me my 200 camels which your men had forcibly taken away from my herds." Abrahah was disappointed and said : "I come with the express purpose of destroying the Ka'bah and you come to me pleading for your lost camels ?" Whereupon 'Abd al-Muttalib replied, "I am the lord of the camels and am responsible for them. As to the Ka'bah, it has its own Lord who will d?fendit. (Tabar?, Abu Ja'far b.

For example, in vol. i, p. 61, Tabar? saw fit, in telling the life story of Adam, to take an excursion into attempting an explanation of human baldness. He tells that Adam was tall ; 60 dhira' ox arm-lengths. This was so tall for Tabar? that he tells us Adam's head must have rubbed against the sky and this continual rubbing had produced baldness not only in Adam but in all his descendants as well. A little further, he tells us that when Adam descended from Paradise, he fell in Hind and one of the branches of Tib (a perfume-producing tree) that accidentally hung on his arms from his sudden parachuting from Paradise to Earth, fell and took root at the spot. This, according to Tabar?, explains why the T?b tree grows in India. (Ibid., p. 63). With such fanciful amusing stories Tabar? and the Muslim historians after him filled volumes. 7.

Consider for instance the concluding words of Albright, W.

"Many a Prophet have We sent to the ancients" (Qur'an XLIII : 6). "We have sent thee the Qur'an that you may show the people that which had been previously sent down to them, so that they may consider" (Holy Qur'?n, XVI : 44). Indeed, the Qur'an itself must have in some sense been revealed previously : "It (that is, the Qur'an) is in the books of the ancients. Is it not a sufficient proof for them (the unbelievers) that the wise ones among the children of Israel have known this Qur'an ?" (Qur'an, XXVI : 196). 19. Qur'an II : 132-133. 20. "And We have sent before thee no men but that We gave them a revelation from Us". (Qur'an XXI : 25). 21. "And We have sent to every people a Prophet with the message that men shall worship God and avoid injustice" (Qur'an, XVI: 36). "And We have sent before thee no prophet but that We have revealed to him that there is no God but Me and that all men should whorship Me" (Qur'?n. XXI: 25). 22. For a presentation of this view see, Albright, W. F., op. cit. chapter V, Charisma and Catharsis. Albright thinks that the conclusion of the author of Jub is profounder than that of the Babylonians. "Suffering," he writes, "is not necessarily a result of sin, but may be inflicted by the Almighty for the purpose of testing and tempering man." Like the majority of Christian scholars, Albright refuses to see in the text an editorial hand representing an ideology different from that of the original author which is "Babylonian." Then, passing beyond the text altogether, Albright achieves the jump required by Christian dogma. "In other words," he continues, "human</page><page sequence="21">TOWARDS A HISTORIOGRAPHY OF PRE-HIJRAH ISLAM 85 suffering may be part of God's purifying process...The combination of thes? two concepts, vicarious suffering and purification through suffering, lies behind Deutero-Isaiah's doctrine of salvation... The servant... is ... the pious individual who atones for the sins of the many by his uncomplaining agony; he is finally the coming Savior of Israel."... (op. cit., pp. 331-3). How does the suffering that purifies and tempers the subject that suffers become vicarious ? How does the Isaiahan requirement of a Jew to be ready to suffer in order to save nationalist-racialist Israel become universal ? How does this vicarious suffering become the principle of human-divine encounter ? How does it become a principle of God's being ? One wonders how Christian dogma often succeeds in suppressing the most meticulously scientific, rational, and critical of archaeological thinking, such as W. F. Albright evidences on so many occasions. 23. Qur'?n : XXXV : 24 ; XVI : 36. 24. Qur'?n, XVIII : 56. 25. Qur'?n, IV : 164. 26. Margoliouth, D.

"With the mighty weapon which Zabada and Inanna entrusted to me, With the insight that Enki allotted to me, With the ability that Marduk gave me, I rooted out the enemy above and below, I made an end of war ; I promoted the welfare of the land ; I made the peoples rest in friendly habitations ; I did not let them have anyone to terrorize them. The great gods called me. So I became the beneficent shepherd whose sceptre is righteous ; My benign shadow is spread over my city. In my bosom I carried the peoples of the land of Sumer and Akkad ; They prospered under my protection ; I have governed them in peace ; 1 have sheltered them in my strength." (Ibid., p. 178) 43. E.g., T. J. Meek, translator of the Code of Hammurabi in J. B. Pritchard's Ancient Near Eastern Texts, introduced his translation with a note in which he described the graphic representation of the stela as one of Hammurabi "in the act of receiving the commission to write the law-book from the god of justice." (Ibid., p. 163) 44. Such a God stands on a par with the validity or otherwise of a geometrical theorem. Incidentally, this was predominantly the criticism which our theologians directed against our philosophers. For a precise refutation of this standpoint of the philosophers, see al-Ghaz?li. Abu Hamid, ah?fut al-Fal?sifah, ed. Sulayman Dunia, Dar al-Ma'Srif, Cairo, 1955, Mas* ai ah III, pp. 120-124. Summing up, al-Ghaz?li wrote : "Our purpose is to show that this meaning (the philosophers' meaning of act as logically necessary) may not be called an act or a deed. For the essence of an act or deed is that what takes place does so as the object of a real will, whereas you (philosophers ?) have denied this essence to action. You must have then called it action merely to placate the Islamists. But religion does not stand by your attributing to God names which have been emptied of their true connotation..," etc. (ibid., p. 124). Another, yet mote vehement</page><page sequence="23">TOWARDS A HISTORIOGRAPHY OF PRE-HIjRAH ?SLAM 87 denunciation of the philosophers for this short-coming came from Ibn Taymiyyah in most of his treatises. See, e.g., Kit?b al-Nubuww?t, Cairo, 1346 A.H. 45. Great as this Providential concern is in Islam, it has never succeeded in misleading Islamic thought as it did Christian thought, to the supposition that God would Himself undertake the ethical burden of man, and do for him, as it were, that which he alone ought to, and must, do if he is to satisfy the morally imperative. God's concern for man remained confined to the limits defined by Divine nature of which justice is the highest principle. Accordingly, mercy in Islam is a contingent attribute of Divine action, whereas justice is a necessary attribute of Divine nature. 46. Pritchard, J. B., op. cit., p. 178. 47. Ibid. 48. Ibid. 49. Exodus, 32 : 9 ; 33 : 1, 5 ; 14 : 9 ; Deuteronomy, 9 : 6, 11 ; Ezekiel 2 : 4 ; etc. 50. This relation to the law is elaborated in the following verses : "If man has intelligence And is able to guide his land aright, Let him heed the words which I wrote on my stela, And may this stela show him the road and the way..." My words are choice, my deeds have no equal ; It is only to the fool that they are empty ; To the wise they Stand forth as an object of wonder (But) if that man did not heed my words which I wrote on my stela, ...May Shamash, the mighty judge of heaven and earth,... Deprive him of knowledge and understanding. And constantly lead him astray... May the blighting wotd of Shamash come upon him quickly." (Ibid., pp. 17 -9) 51. Consider the following statement of general purpose of the law : "In order that the strong might not oppress the weak. That justice might be dealt the orphan (and) the widow, I wrote my precious words on my stela, And in the presence of my statue as the king of justice, I set (it) up in order to administer the law of the land. To prescribe the ordinances of the land, To give justice to the oppressed," etc. etc. (Ibid.) It would be vain to argue that such a noble purpose is not Islamic.</page></plain_text>
