Like many indigenous converts, Maori quickly started to minister to themselves a combination of Christian ideas and their own pre-existing spirituality with conse quential changes to their architecture, as can be seen in the buildings of the Ringatu, lharaira and Ratana religious move ments. This paper will examine these developments and argue that interpretations, translations, and transliterations of the Godhead, from atua (or supernatural beings), to Old Testament prophets, to a New Testament leader, generated significant design changes in architecture as Maori people sought to literally accommodate God in their lives and buildings. Parts of the Old Testament were translated into Maori as early as 1827, a decade before the New Testament (Lineham 1992:156, 159). With its stories of powerful lineages of leaders, warrior soci eties and colonization, the Hebrew story found a receptive Maori audience who could see immediate parallels with their own social situation. That the early wave of missionaries told their congre gations they were descendants of Shem only reinforced the idea that the Bible was as much a predictive document as it was a spiritual and historical one (Sorrenson 1993:14-17). As a pre scription for living, the scriptures were used as the basis for new types of art and architecture. The first so-called 'mechanic' Church Missionary Society provided instruction and experience in carpentry on ministry building projects (Bawden 1992:38-9). The Ringatu Church was one of the earliest Maori religious movements to combine spiritual and architectural Christian ideas with those derived from Maori culture. As a young man in 1840s Turanga (later to be also known as Gisborne), the future founder of the Ringatu Church, Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki, attended the recently opened Whakato Anglican mission school. He trained as a Maori carver, almost certainly with his Rongowhakaata tribal kinsman, Raharuhi Rukupo (Binney 1983:115). In the early 1840s, Rukupo was responsible for super vising the local construction of Te Hau-ki-Turanga meeting house at Turanga (currently situated in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa), a building that sits on the aesthetic and technological cusp of the Maori customary and colonized worlds. Te Kooti probably worked with him on the Anglican mis sion's Manutuke Church project. These two influences, Christianity and customary practice, were to have a profound effect on the more than thirty Ringatu meeting houses built in the 1870s, 80s and early 90s across the eastern North Island. Also a factor was Te Kooti's personal leadership, which combined Old Testament prophetic traits with mahi tohunga, or priestly expert ise. Te Kooti is regarded as being responsible for expanding the size of the meeting house to that of the mission church, so that Ringatu buildings could be used for religious and political func tions, which were interdependent spheres of activity for Maori (Neich 1993:115). Following biblical customs, almost all of the Ringatu buildings underwent an opening ceremony, this emerging Maori practice becoming a custom with particular architectural significance in the following century. Most Ringatu buildings did not depart from the structural arrangement with which Te Kooti was most familiar, that of the Rongowhakaata single gable meeting house, with a front porch and single entry and window. In this style of house a whakapapa (geneaology) could be read depicted in wall carvings from recent ancestors to their forbears and shown as sequential patterns on kowhaiwhai scroll rafter paintings. Above the rafter paintings, the whakapapa continued to founding ancestors illustrated in wood or paint on the tahuhu ridgepole to the gable apex of the house. The vertical hierarchy of Maori architecture is thought to have wider Accommodating God: The Influence of Christianity on Maori Architecture Deidre Broum, University of Auckland</page><page sequence="2">NS vol. 6, 2007 25 Pacific origins as most buildings in the region are constructed from the top down, with the initial raising of the ridgepole. In this way the process is quite distinct from Western architecture (Austin 2004). A tua in the form of culture heroes, gods, and supernatural creatures were often added to this sequence. Christianity was also given a place in this architectural whakapa' pa by Ringatu artists. An inverted ngarara, or serpent, on Eripitana's central column, for example, terrified Te Kooti since the customary lizard omen had been likened by some missionaries to the serpent of Genesis (Binney 1995:327; Elsmore 1989:39). During Te Kooti's 1883 renovation of Te Tokanganui-a-Noho (seen in Figure 1, a somewhat deteriorated postcard from the time, Historic Places Trust file 8/17/4/72-0027), a carved wall panel illustrating the culture hero Maui restraining the sun with a noose may have symbolised Maori recognition of the Bible, Figure 1: Interior of Te Tokanganui-a-Noho meetinghouse, Te Kuiti. Photograph c. J885, private collection. since the sun motif was the Ringatu emblem for Christianity. Some Ringatu followers reinterpreted the whakapapa arrangement of meeting house embellishments so that they could communi cate beyond the atua, directly with God. For example, at Otoko marae, adherents claimed that their prayers and speeches were being transmitted up to God through the rafters, ridgepole, and gable posts of the Tauakira meeting house (Binney 1995:436). One of Christianity's most significant impacts on Maori cultural life was the redefinition of tapu and noa. Tapu is customarily defined as that which is restricted or prohibited and with Christian influence its meaning was extended to include the sacred. Noa is traditionally the quality of being free from tapu, its complementary meaning somewhat erroneously translated as the 'profane' by missionaries. It was Te Kooti who radically for malised meeting house protocol by demanding the absolute divi sion of the sacred and profane as stated in the Old Testament (Elsmore 1989:233). In at least six instances Te Kooti's negative kupu whakaari, or predictive words, concerning Ringatu meeting houses caused them to become tapu and only of use for church services (Brown 1997:85-6). Yet, old spiritual ideas also prevailed, and the meeting houses Te Nui-o-te-Pa and Rongopai were deemed tapu in the prohibited sense, the former burned and the latter largely abandoned up until recent times (Binney 1995:294; Orbell 1964:32-3). Other houses were deemed noa, and thus not used for religious purposes. For instance, Te Whai-a-te-Motu, became noa after Te Kooti told its community, "the only results you get from anything sacred or tapu is spiders!" (Boy Biddle in Binney 1995:471). Tapu and noa, as the sacred and profane, were also guiding prin ciples behind the entire design of Rua Kenana's Maungapohatu spiritual community, established for his eight hundred Iharaira (or Israelite) adherents in 1907 in the rugged central North Island Urewera region (Fig. 2). Rua believed that he had inherit Figure 2: Maungapohatu settlement.

One of the final sites of the New Zealand Wars (1860-1918), the settle ment's architectural history is also influenced by Rua's transition from an Old Testament style prophet to New Testament pacifist leader. Between 1908 and 1915 Maungapohatu was comprised of two distinct sections: the fenced-off sacred area, known as the 'wahi tapu', encompassing civic amenities and sleeping houses, and a surrounding noa region, where buildings associated with food and daily living were constructed. The separation was based i MAORI HOUSE TP KUITl Figure 1: Interior of Te Tokanganui-a-Noho meeting house, TeKuiti. Photograph c. 1885, private collection. Figure 2: Maungapohatu seulement.

Everything at Maungapohatu was done according to the Bible and a number of the buildings in the wahi tapu were local inter pretations of biblical architecture based on the scriptures and associated documentation. The design of Rua's double-gabled res idence, Hiruharama Hou, or the 'New Jerusalem', built in 1908, was based on the instructions that God gave David for the con struction of Solomon's house (Fig. 3). Rua believed he could Figure 3: Hiruharama Hou. Pholograph 1908 by George Bourne, Alexander Tumbull Library, F-75709-1/2 demonstrate that he was of the same lineage as David and Solomon by recreating biblical architecture (Binney 1990:46; 2 Chronicles 3:1; Revelation 22:16). Accordingly, there are similar ities between the dual spaces, pillars, golden color, and square plan of Rua's house and that of Solomon's as described in the Figure 4: Hiona, Maungapohatu. Photograph /908 by George Bourne, Alexander Tumbull Library, F2915-I/2. Books of Chronicles and Kings (see 2 Chronicles 3:4, 7, 15-17 &amp; 1 Kings 6:34). Rua's courthouse in the wahi tapu, Hiona [Zion], was also con structed in 1908 to his design (Fig. 4)- A major departure from contemporaneous North Island Maori architecture, it was not only circular in plan but also two storied and covered in painted symbols related to the lharaira movement. Hiona was almost cer tainly modelled on Solomon's Temple as described in the Book of Kings, being wooden and literally "round about," as well as hav ing two doors and "windows of narrow lights," a winding stair case, and a tripartite internal division (1 Kings 6:4,10,32). The building also had functional similarities to Solomon's House of the Forest of Lebanon, described in the same Book as being a courthouse and throne room (1 Kings 7:7). The yellow and blue mosaics and rotunda like form of Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock probably shaped Rua's idea for Hiona's aesthetic. His knowledge of the Dome is thought to have come from a litho graphic image taken from one of many nineteenth-century illus trated bibles, which sometimes mistakenly described the building as Solomon's Temple (Binney 1983:355; 1984:376; 1993 pers. comm.). Followers have interpreted Hiona's yellow diamond emblem as the Holy Ghost and one of the jewels of the Twelve —■- Tribes of Israel (Binney 1990:49). The blue club was Rua's personal symbol of divine Kingship, its trefoil shape regarded by earlier Maori spiri tual leaders as representing the Trinity (Binney 1983:355; 1990:49; Hanson 1990:164). Maungapohatu underwent a series of architectural changes that were triggered by some immediate, local problems and Figure 3: Himharama H ou.

The first occurred between 1914 and 1915 when Rua rebuilt Maunga pohatu by removing all tapu and dismantling the fence around the wahi tapu in response to a general relaxation of tapu obser vances (Binney 1983:354; Te Puhi Tatu in Binney 1983:355 &amp; 1990:77). Food could now be eaten inside formerly tapu build ings, such as the meeting house, Tane-nui-a-Rangi (Binney 1990:79; Gollner 1970). Binney believes the changes were a con scious imitation of Zerubbabel's actions at Jerusalem after the Exile. After spending three months in prison, Rua returned to Maungapohatu in August 1915 and once again reconstructed the settlement, probably following Jesus' alleged comment in Matthew, "1 am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three days" (Matthew 26:61). Over three September days, for three hours each day, Rua and one hundred followers rebuilt the community, desecrating Hiona by using it as a barn and wool shed ( Auckland Weekly News; Maungapohatu Ledger Book:39). As parables, the two reconstructions signalled Rua's shift from an Old Testament Solomon-style prophet to a New Testament Christ-like leader. Indeed it was around 1915 that Rua began to increasingly describe his leadership in terms of Christ's mission. In 1918, after being imprisoned following a police raid on Maungapohatu in which his son Toko was killed, Rua ritually cleansed the settlement by demolishing Hiruharama Hou and Figure 5: Temepara, Ratana Pa.

Nine years later, in 1927 he again altered, or resurrected, the community by telling the Iharaira to protect their houses with iron roofs in preparation for an Apocalypse (Te Puhi Tatu in Binney 1990:146, 156, 159). When confronted with confused vil lagers on the day that Armageddon was supposed to arrive, Rua blamed its postponement on their attempts to save themselves from the Day of Judgement ('F. K. B.' n.d.:n.p.). After the First World War and the 1918 influenza epidemic there was a new interest in spiritualism and its transcendental qualities. In New Zealand the orthodox churches, as well as the media, were quick to acknowledge this trend and gave their sup port to an emerging Maori faith healer, Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana, from Whanganui on the western side of the North Island. He founded his eponymous church in 1925 and three years later announced his entry into national politics at the opening on his property of the 1000-seat Temepara or Temple (Fig. 5). By 1935 about 40,000 Maori - one third of the Maori population - had become registered Ratana Church followers, most of them from northern, western and southern regions of Figure 7: Te Kao Ratana church.

The Temepara had solid Christian architectural precedents, despite what may initially appear to be an Islamic influence through the use of the crescent moon and star symbol and minaret-like structures. The building's overall design was said to courtesy of Bill McKay. Figure 6: Mangamulai Ratana church. Photograph c. 1990 by Bill McKay. Figure 7: Te Kao Ratana church.

Photograph c. 1990 by Bili McKay. be based on an idea that Ratana began to develop following a trip to Japan during his 1924 World Tour. The origin of the Temepara's most identifiable characteristic, the domed twin bell towers capped with religious symbols, is most likely to have been inspired by the Urakami Roman Catholic Cathedral in Nagasaki. This Japanese-acclaimed Romanesque church opened in 1925 after a thirty year construction period and was destroyed during the 1945 atomic bomb attack (Sedcole 1985:56, 70). If the bell towers, porch, and gable were the essential 'body' of the Temepara, then later branch churches built in its image were that body stripped bare, painted, dressed, resuited and baptised. In Northland (the region north of Auckland), each of the Ratana temples (Mangamuka in 1947, Te Kao in 1952, Te Hapua in 1954 and Ahipara in 1966; Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9) was essentially a sty listic descendant of the one previously built, with slight modifica tions to suit local conditions or better represent the proportions and form of the Temepara. What makes these branch temples so interesting is the process of simulacrum in which some elements were passed on while oth ers were discarded in order to attain the most meaningful, yet resourceful, representation of a parent building. All of these structures were made 'temples' by virtue of having twin bell tow ers on their front facades like the Temepara. But the Temepara's side wall buttressing, intended to enhance its ecclesiological appearance, was not repeated by the builders of the branch tem ples. The most likely explanation is that this level of replicated detail for the lesser faces of the branch temples was considered stylistically and financially unnecessary. Branch temple claddings were treated almost like vestments in the way they were progres sively changed from readily-available weatherboard to masonry to make them more closely resemble the parent building's concrete walls. These renovations took place as the means of the local congregation allowed and the architectural fashions of the time developed. The alterations also affirmed a recurring principle in post-colonial indigenous architecture that masonry is somehow more 'established', modern, and progressive than wood and other types of sheeting. As if to baptize the new temples, they were named over their porches in reference to local connections, such as Ratana's trip north in 1921 or a shared relationship to the sea. These names were added to those of 'Arepa' and 'Omeka', or 'Alpha' and 'Omega', the beginning and the end, seen on each bell tower of every Ratana temple including the Temepara. Architectural personification is a trait of Maori building. This process reinforces the anthropomorphic condition of the temples: the ceremony of adding a new name to those that have been passed down signalling that the temples have been bom, like a child, and their congregations born again, as converts. As Ratana had correctly predicted at the opening of the Temepara, modem Maori leadership would have a political rather than religious basis (Henderson 1972:73). By the end of the Second World War all four Maori parliamentary seats were occu pied by members of his political party (Henderson 1972:91). Yet, despite Ratana's pre-eminence as a spiritual and political leader, his architecture was not as successful. The Ratana temples were Figure 9: Ahipara Ratarui church.

Their innovation disallowed the possibility of perpetuating an emerging tradition, because established forms, materials and technologies were not being passed down between generations. Furthermore, the cen trality of Maori religion to everyday life had declined with the increasing secularisation of Maori political activity since the 1970s. This activity has favored the marae, focusing on the meet ing house, rather than the pulpit, as a forum for free speech. Ironically, it is the architecture developed in response to the Old Testament that has survived, redefined as a forum and in many instances 'traditionalised' to remove historicising characteristics. Little did the missionaries realise, when they wrote the Maori Bible, that their work would herald such a diversity of counter-colonial religio-political responses, the translations and transliterations on which they pondered becoming the formal language of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Maori architecture.
