Ganeshaiah* Department of Crop Physiology and * Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore 560 065, India In plants, as in animals, conflict occurs between par ents and offspring over a range of issues such as allo cation of maternal resources to seeds and number of seeds to be packed in a fruit. We have reviewed theo retical bases and empirical evidences for such con flict in plants and present the predictions, processes and evolutionary consequences of such conflict. We have shown that though 'plants can neither sing nor dance' they do indulge in sibling rivalry, fratricide and kin cooperation as intensely as animals do. For this, maternal parents and offspring have evolved strategies that are subtle, yet as effective as those in animals in upholding their respective interests. We argue that the evolution of a number of plant repro ductive features can be profitably viewed as strate gies and counter-strategies of the offspring and maternal parent towards ensuring their respective interests. For example, features such as polyembry ony, endosperm, multi-carpellary ovaries which had thus far remained poorly explained, appear to have evolved as maternal counter-strategies against off spring-driven sibling rivalry. Thus, these 'highly an thropomorphic, sociobiological hypotheses' which were suggested to be 'best not applied to plants', have indeed been helpful in providing a new frame work to view the evolution of plant reproductive strategies. In humans, the relationship between a mother and her offspring is probably one of the most endearing ones. Across cultures, people have paid obeisance to this sub lime relationship. However, in the early 1970s, this view was rudely shattered when Trivers1 advanced the con cept that, more as a rule than an exception, mothers and offspring can have conflicting interests. He argued that such conflict occurs even for the simplest of parental cares, such as suckling; a mother does not feed her off spring indiscriminately while the offspring persists in its demand for its mother's milk. The rationale behind such 'weaning' conflict is the differential fitness accrued to the mother by yielding parental resources, and to the offspring by demanding these resources. Trivers' argued that the maternal parent will be se lected to allocate a certain optimal amount of resources to each of her offspring, so as to maximize her inclusive fitness. On the other hand, the offspring will be selected to demand much more than that defined by the mother's optimum to increase its own fitness. Hence there ensues a conflict between parent and offspring over the extent of resource allocation1,2. Though Trivers' idea appeared heretical, it provoked widespread interest in the nature of the conflict between parent and offspring in animals. The most dramatic illus tration of the conflict is seen in a bird nest where the fledglings demand food from the mother by 'intense begging calls'3,4. The mother is coerced to submit to the calls because these intense vocalizations, if persistent, would attract predators risking the entire brood. In a way it may be argued that the fledglings blackmail their mothers to part with parental resources. The indiscriminate demand for maternal resources by an offspring may be manifested in the form of intense sibling rivalry1,2,5,6. In extreme situations, competition among siblings may take a violent form and dominant among the brood kills others to garner all the maternal re sources for itself. Brood reduction in boobies and raptors wherein the older chick, invariably kills the later hatched fledglings is one such extreme form of sibling rivalry7-13. That sibling rivalry and parent-offspring conflict might also occur in plants was proposed by Ganeshaiah and Uma Shaanker14 and Uma Shaanker et al.]5. They argued that seeds developing in close physical and tem poral proximity in a fruit, can be expected to interact as intensely among themselves as fledglings developing in the nest of a bird (Figure 1 a, b) and to conflict with the maternal parent over a range of issues. Three issues over which such conflicts can arise are (a) resource allocation to seed5,15, (b) brood size or seed number packed per fruit14,15 and (c) seed dormancy or timing of seed germi nation15,16. These conflicts can be explained within the general framework of the theory of parent-offspring conflict proposed by Trivers1. Thus whether boobies or brassicas, raptors or rapeseed, it appears that sibling rivalry and parent-offspring conflict may be a common feature of animals and plants alike. In this paper we of fer a brief overview of the work conducted at our labora tory on these issues and discuss the predictions, processes and the evolutionary consequences of the conflict between parent and offspring in plants. 932 CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL 72, NO. 12, 25 JUNE 1997</page><page sequence="2">SPECIAL SECTION: EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY Figure 1. a, Clutch of eggs in the nest of a bird and (b) clutch of seeds in the pod of the tree, Castanospermum australe.

The optimum seed weight was obtained by drawing a tan gent to the fitness curve. Parent-offspring conflict in plants Predictions and processes 7. Conflict over resource allocation to seeds Assuming that offspring fitness increases at a decreasing rate with resource investment, Smith and Fretwell17 ar gued that the maternal parent would be selected to fa vour an optimal allocation of resources (m*) to each of her offspring, such that the marginal returns to her are maximized (Figure 2). However, as Trivers1 argued, because the offspring by themselves do not invest any resources, they would be selected to demand the maxi mum amount of investment (o*) that they can possibly obtain from the maternal parent. This results in a con flict of interest between maternal parent and offspring over the extent of resource allocation to seeds. Evidence in support of conflict over the extent of re source allocation to seeds has been obtained in Thesp esia populnea (Malvaceae) at our laboratory (unpublished). In this species, the offspring fitness (as measured by seedling leaf area) increases nonlinearly with seed weight (Figure 3). The optimal level of re source at which the marginal returns to the mother is maximized is 165 mg. If the offspring conform to the maternal interest, then seed size in T. populnea should be normally distributed around this optimum.

Conflict over brood size In plants, several components of offspring fitness such as dispersal efficiency14'15, escape from prédation25 and post-dispersal seedling survival26,27 decrease with in crease in the number of seeds packed per fruit (brood size).

Thus, under conditions where offspring fitness is a decreasing function of the number of seeds packed in a fruit, Uma Shaanker et al.15 predicted that selection would favour fratricide or sibling rivalry-driven seed abortion compared to situations where offspring fitness ^ is unaffected by changes in brood size.

Work in our laboratory and elsewhere have shown that as much as animals, plants too exhibit sibling rivalry and parent-offspring conflict over issues ranging from the maternal resource allocation to seeds to seed packing in fruits. Apart from providing a strong theo retical framework to explain the conditions under which the maternal parent and offspring have conflicting inter ests, our studies have provided empirical evidence in support of sibling rivalry and parent-offspring conflict and have unravelled the underlying proximate mecha nisms through which the conflicting interests are mani fested. Though the interactions may not be as apparent and dramatic as that in animals, plants have evolved equally effective, but subtle mechanisms to uphold the respective interests of the maternal parent and offspring. One of the major implications of our studies is that they have provided a new framework to view the evolution of a number of plant reproductive features, such as polyembryony, endosperm and locules, which hitherto had largely remained unaddressed. 1.
