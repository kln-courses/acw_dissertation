<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONTENTS AND TERMINOLOGY OF THE MAWANGDUI TEXTS ON THE ARTS OF THE BEDCHAMBER LI LING and KEITH McMAHON* In ancient China the art of the bedchamber consisted of teachings and techniques for the purpose of assisting men in the art of attaining harmony in intercourse with women, enhancing health and longevity, and of generating descendants. In the Han, the art of the bedchamber belonged to the disciplines called "prescriptions and techniques" (Jangji fit). The "art of the bedchamber," or fangzhong shu Jfs 41 W, was also called "the way of conjoining yin" (jie yin zhi dao M), and "the art of riding women" (yufuren zhi shu MM "Prescriptions and techniques" included not only the medical arts (classed as "Canons of Medicine" [yi jing if H], and "Canonic Prescriptions" [jingfang ® Jj]), but also the art of the bedchamber and various arts of "nourishing life" (yangsheng it such as "nutrition" (fushi M or "eating methods"), and "internal conduction" (daoyin &lt;jl, or "physical cultivation"), as well as associated incantations and spells (classed under "immortality" [shenxian ff-ftlj]).1 Most research in China to date has been on the ancient medical arts only; the other parts of fangji, especially the art of the bedchamber, have been neglected both because of the paucity of materials and the taboo nature of the subject. This essay will investigate the Mawangdui texts with special emphasis on their terminology. The set of terms in these texts will at times be compared with that of later bedchamber works * First draft by Li Ling, November, 1989, Seattle; revised, June, 1990, Beijing.

As a set of teachings, the arts of the bedchamber are early in origin, probably dating to before the existence of writing and of books. Even after books began to exist, much of the transmission of these arts was oral. Thus, what we have now in written form gives only a glimpse of what was a dynamic tradition. Furthermore, of course, the dates of the texts we now have cannot be relied upon to indicate the period of the formation of their contents. As early as circa 100 B.C., the historian Sima Qian 1]S1 (145-86 B.C.) mentions texts on sexual intercourse, referring to them as "the prohib ited books on conjoining yin and yang," but he does not give titles.2 The earliest record of titles is in the "Yiwen zhi" ® ~$C ;£ section of the Hanshu MII, which lists eight works held in the state library.3 Six of these are about "the way of yin" (yindao HI J8), i.e., techniques of inter course; two are about "prescriptions" (fang Jj) for the purpose of nour ishing male sexual energy and seeking male descendants. "The way of yin" recalls both the term "the way of conjoining yin" (jie yin zhi dao) found in the Mawangdui bedchamber text Shiiuen + fnj and also Sima Qian's "conjoining yin and yang."4 All three terms are from periods not far apart. The titles of these eight works in the Hanshu take their names from ancient sex masters such as Rongcheng Wuchengzi %£$and Tianlao or from the masters' students, such as emperors Huangdi WW, Yao ^§, Shun Tang i§, Pan Geng MM, and the "Three Kings" (Sanwang Hi): i.e., Yu M of the Xia dynasty, Tang Wa of the Shang, and Kings Wen 3C and Wu of the Zhou. These figures can be also found in the Mawangdui text Shiwen. The format of these works was probably one of questions and answers, but unfortunately none is extant. Daoism flourished at the end of the Eastern Han, when the art of the bedchamber was already an important part of its canon. Ge Hong7s H ^ Baopuzi circa fourth century, mentions more than ten schools of the bedchamber arts,5 and lists five representative works that are included in the Daoist canon: the Rongcheng jing ^?£r!c$I, Sunti jing 2.

Other sources indicate that they existed in the Eastern Han and that two of them, the Rongcheng jing and the Sunujing, date from as early as the Western Han.8 For the Sui and Tang periods, five sources indicate the continued transmission of bedchamber works taking the names of Sunii, Xuannii, and Pengzu; several new titles appear as well.9 In addition, at that time a new work appeared that is of a different sort: the Yufang mijue 5 ifc (Secret formulas of the jade chamber). This consists of excerpts from numerous bedchamber texts organized according to topic. The appear ance of a miscellany of this sort tends to lead to the disappearance of the individually produced texts that make up its contents, while the miscel lany itself usually survives longer.

The influence of the ancient art of the bedchamber still exerted itself in Daoist sects, which concealed it under a mantle of se crecy, and in folk culture and vernacular literature, but the terminology is for the most part too different from the Mawangdui through Tang texts to be of comparative use here. Of the two main later sources that are of use for comparative research on the Mawangdui texts, the first is the Yi xinfang (Prescriptions for the heart of medicine), in particular, section 28, called Fangnei M F*9 (In the bedchamber), compiled by the Japanese doctor Tamba Yasuyori Sft ffl in 984.11 The other is the Sunti miaolun (The mar velous teachings of Sunu, the "Plain Woman"), a Ming work discovered in Japan and reproduced in van Gulik's Erotic Colour Prints of the Ming Period.12 The Fangnei contains four works with titles that were named above, the Sunti jing, Xuannti jing, Pengzu jing, and Zidu jing, and in addition the Tang work Dongxuanzi ^ 3C zf-, as well as miscellaneous material from Chinese medical sources. The bedchamber texts in the Fangnei are for the most part indicated as being excerpted from two works, the Yufangmijue and the Yufang zhiyao (The essentials of the jade chamber), which, as mentioned above, are bedchamber miscellanies peculiar to the period.13 In addition, two modern sources exist that have been relied upon for many years, but that contain problems needing clarification if we are to achieve greater accuracy in comparative research. The first is the late Qing scholar Ye Dehui's publication of the Sunti jing, Sunti fang, Yufang mijue (with the Yufang zhiyao appended), and the Dongxuanzi.u Except for the Sunti fang, which is based on the Qing scholar Sun Xingyan's M MftT edition, the others are taken from the Fangnei of Tamba Yasuyori. Ye's work constituted a rediscovery of an ancient tradition in China and was of great influence. However, scholars after him relied on his edi tions without checking the originals, from which he unfortunately made numerous errors in transcription and collation.15 11. See Yi xinfang 7? &lt;LN fj (Beijing: Renmin weisheng chubanshe, 1955). References to this text will be to the Fangnei section unless otherwise indicated. 12.

As Li Ling's forthcoming edition will show, the Fangnei consists of a total of thirty-eight excerpts from twenty-three works. 14. See his Shuangmei jing'an congshu, mentioned above, n. 7. 15. For example, he took the Sunii jing, Xuannii jing, and Pengzu jing as one work consisting of questions and answers between Huangdi and Sunii, Xuannii, and Cainii JR il. The Sunii jing is, in fact, a series of questions and answers between Huangdi and Sunii; the Xuannii jing between Huangdi and Xuannii; and the Pengzu jing between Pengzu and Cainii; the three are distinct works. In addition, he failed to see</page><page sequence="5">LI LING and KEITH McMAHON 149 The second modern source is Robert van Gulik's two works, Erotic Colour Prints of the Ming Period and Sexual Life in Ancient ChinaJ6 His work is especially valuable for its reproduction of the Suntt miaolun, which he rediscovered for modern scholars and which is of use in reconstructing the meaning of terms in the Fangnei and Mawangdui texts. He postulated that the Han dynasty bedchamber texts were very similar to those of the Fangnei, a point that the discovery of the Mawangdui sources has confirmed. However, two problems with his research should be noted. First, his discussions of sexual terminology are still preliminary and leave numerous doubts. Second, except for treating the Dongxuanzi as a separate work, he put the other texts into an amorphous whole without analyzing them into their proper entities. Ye Dehui's and van Gulik's misunderstanding of sources has led Li Ling to produce a new edition of the Fangnei sources for the purpose of comparison with the Sunti miaolun. This effort in turn has proven to be of great value in understanding the Mawangdui sources. The Basic Contents of the Mawangdui Bedchamber Texts In December 1973, a large number of silk manuscripts and a lesser number of bamboo manuscripts were excavated from Tomb Number Three of the Han Dynasty Mawangdui complex in Changsha, Hunan. Fourteen works concern medicine and nourishing life, and of these, seven are on or related to the art of the bedchamber: 1. Yangsheng fang ~h. "Prescriptions for nourishing life" 2. Zaliao fang "Prescriptions for miscellaneous cures" 3. Taichan shu Sn/llll, "Book of childbirth" 4. Shizven + "Ten questions" 5. He yinyang SI Wis, "Joining yin and yang" 6. Zajinfang "Prescriptions for miscellaneous spells" 7. Tianxia zhi dao tan "Talks on the loftiest ways under heaven" that the Yufang mijue was an independent compilation of separate works. Instead, he took all of the Sunti jing excerpts and all of the Pengzu jing excerpts concerning Cainii and put them into his version of the Sunii jing. In addition, his version of the Yufang mijue left out the one excerpt in the Fangnei from the Zidu jing. Finally, his editions drew on only five sources (for a total of 90 excerpts) of the 23 sources (138 excerpts) that are actually included in the Fangnei. In addition, his Xuannii jing and Yufang mijue left out portions that are excerpted in other parts of the Yi xin fang. He also made many errors of transcription. 16.

Brill, 1961).</page><page sequence="6">150 ARTS OF THE BEDCHAMBER Numbers 1 through 3, which are silk manuscripts of one juan each, were copied at a relatively early date, perhaps around the Qin-Han transition. Numbers 4 through 7, bamboo manuscripts of one section each, were copied later, perhaps at the time of Emperor Wen (no later than 168 B.C.). The composition of all these works was even earlier, estimates for some going as early as the Warring States period. Of these seven texts, only the seventh records the title in the manuscript, the other titles having been added by modern scholars on the basis of Sui and Tang bibliographic materials. Two modern editions of the Mawangdui bedchamber texts exist. The first is by Zhou Shirong M "ffi the scholar who presided over the excavation of the works; it contains only numbers 4 through 7, which at the time were thought to be one work, called Yangsheng fangP In addition to errors in the assemblage of texts and their classification, this edition is also flawed in its recognition of characters, in punctuation, and annotation.18 The second edition is the Mawangdui Hanmu boshu M 3E M IS ^ Ir, vol. 4, by the Committee for the Reconstruction of Ma wangdui Silk Manuscripts (the members of which included two paleog raphers, Tang Lan Jtf M and Li Xueqin $ H Wi, and two specialists in the history of medicine, Ma Jixing IS it H and the above mentioned Zhou Shirong); this edition includes all seven texts according to the titles given above.19 The Mawangdui Hanmu boshu exhibits a much higher degree of accuracy and exactitude than the previous edition. Although it still cannot be considered definitive, it is the main source for current research on the Mawangdui bedchamber texts, including those exam ined in this paper.20 In what follows we will describe the contents of each of the Mawangdui bedchamber texts. 17.

The work includes thirty-two medical prescriptions; however, because of damage to the text, only twenty-seven remain (the number thirty-two is ascertained from the table at the end of the text). The prescriptions can be divided into five categories.22 1. The first category of prescriptions consists of cures and strengthen ings for men, as follows: lao bucji a cure for "impotence in the aged man";23 buqi ^FS,a cure for general "impotence" (nos. 13-17); jia in, "increase," that is, ways of increasing the size of the penis (nos. 18-20);24 xi nan f[5 |§, "washing the male," that is, use of medicinal liquids on the penis to strengthen it (no. 43); yongshao ;P, "sparseness of semen," a cure for decline of sexual desire and thinness of sexual fluids (yong means to have inter course; shao refers to sparseness of semen; nos. 131-134);25 shiyin "foods and conduction," which pertains to consump tion of food and energy conduction for the penis (nos. 218-219). 2. The second category of prescriptions for women, which consist of: H, Hunan zhongyi xueyuan xuebao (1987), 42-44. See, also, the Research Group on Mawangdui Medical Texts of the Hunan Institute of Chinese Medicine, Mawangdui yishu kaozhu Mi 3i i# If II (Tianjin: Tianjin kexue jishu chubanshe, 1988); and Donald Harper, "The Sexual Arts of Ancient China as Described in a Manuscript of the Second Century B.C.," Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 47.2 (1987), 539-593, which is a discussion of the He yinyang. 21. See Mawangdui Hanmu boshu, 97-120. 22. The Mawangdui yishu kaozhu distinguishes seven sections and puts weili M SI into "Prescriptions for curing impotence," bian jin nei iM jfi P3 and X jin □ r(3 into "General prescriptions for strengthening yang," yongshao ffl Jp into "General prescrip tions for tonic supplement," X yu □ H and shiyin A 3 [ into "Prescriptions for tonic supplement in the bedchamber."

In Fangnei (46b), this prescription is found under "Prescriptions for increasing the size of the yin," which includes cures for "smallness of the jade stalk." 25. See Suntifang (Ye Dehui edition), 3a, which calls it jing shao Jfra</page><page sequence="8">152 ARTS OF THE BEDCHAMBER yue ^ (%H), "tightener," for shrinking the size of the vagina (no. 44) ;26 yi gan 4a U, "increasing pleasure" (nos. 51-58); cju mao S;33, "removing hair," that is, ridding xuemao "blood hair," the meaning of which is unclear; bing zui zhong ^ ft B, "swelling of the vagina" (no. 64; zui here refers to the vagina; however, see also below). 3. The third category of prescriptions is for use in intercourse and consists of three items: xi Sf, "play," used to determine whether a woman has had secret relations with others, xi referring to relations with other men (nos. 59-60);27 bianjin nei {M j£r "facilitating approaching the woman," (nos. 65 and 76);28 X jin rfl, "X cloth," concerning the use of a cloth dipped in medi cine to rub onto the genitals in order to excite desire (nos. 77-97).29 4. The fourth category of prescriptions is of general supplements for nourishing life and consists of eleven items: zveili f§8§, a kind of sweet wine (nos. 11-12); suan W, "bamboo chips" (nos. 21-27); weilaozhuo M W *3, a wine (nos. 28-29), all three of the above being food-cure methods; zhi 'in, "recuperation," which appears twice (nos. 30-34); mai luan JJP, "wheat and eggs," another food-cure method (nos. 35-42); 26. See Fangnei, 47a-b, which gives two prescriptions: "making the jade gate smaller" and "making the vagina tight, small, and hot," both of which are for curing "largeness of the jade gate." 27.

For this use of nei to refer to woman, also see Shiji, 105.2797, 2799, and 2801: "The illness is due to drinking alchohol and playing with women"; "The illness is due to playing with women"; "The illness is due to excess anger and conjoining with women." 29. "X" stands for a missing character(s) in the original text, a convention we will follow hereafter.</page><page sequence="9">LI LING and KEITH McMAHON 153 jing [or qing] shen yi li Jp St t), "lightening the body, in creasing strength" (nos. 98-101); laolizhong 4", a wine (nos. 154-168); zhejiao "break the horn," a strengthening method (no. 171); zou "running" (nos. 172-193); jixing ^ fr, "walking quickly," both strengthening methods (nos. 194-196). 5. The fifth category of so-called prescriptions is of excerpts from books on the bedchamber. One of these contains a dialogue between Tang and Chen X, the contents of which are similar to He yinyang and Tianxia zhi dao tan, except in this case they consist of a disorganized series of excerpts. The second selection is of a dialogue between Yu PI and Qun He p the contents of which concern the "way of joining qi" (he qi zhi dao nos. 197-217).30 In addition, at the end is appended a diagram of the female genitalia with a term for each part (see below). Zaliao fang, "Prescriptions for miscellaneous cures" Despite the title, this book also has much to do with the bed chamber.31 The first half mainly discusses two topics. The first of these concerns methods for applying medically dipped material to the penis, neijia Jfl, similar to that seen in the Yangsheng fang under "Increase." Here the method is called "opening in the body" (zhongshen rj3 Jj- or zhongshen kong ^ H" :=§ [?L]), and consists of putting medicine into the opening of the penis in order to make it "rise" (ju |S). The second topic has to do with similar methods (yue ft]) used on the vagina (cfian iff) in order to make it react (zhi ®). The effects of the two aphrodisiacs are, in the one case, to increase the size of the penis, and in the other, to shrink the size of the vagina.32 The second half of "Prescriptions for miscella 30.

The Tang work Guang Hongming ji Be ty] Hi quotes the Huang shu of the Tianshidao Eiifi iS cult of the late Eastern Han as containing the expression "join qi and absolve guilt" (he qi shi zui ■a P P), which originates from the art of the bechamber; see Guang Hongming ji (Sibu congkan ed.), 8.19b.

This work contains two diagrams on the right and left above the text (see illus tration, Mawangdui Hanmu boshu, 118). The one on the right is of two babies. At the top of their heads, then to the right and left of their heads, necks, shoulders, hands, and feet, and finally at their genitals, altogeth er twelve positions, are the names of the twelve earthly branches (one set starting from the right hand, the other from the right foot). These are used to predict fortune or misfortune according to the time of birth. The diagram is the same as the "Diagram of human birth," Renzi tu A5? H, appended to the "Almanac A" (Ri shu 0 H?) bamboo slips excavated from the Qin tomb at Shuihudi The diagram on the left is of a big square containing twelve small squares representing the twelve months. In the middle are four charac ters: nan fang Yu cang M B IS, "southern direction" (nanfang) indicat ing the orientation of the diagram, and "Yu's treasure" (yucang) being the title of the diagram. The same illustration is found in the section of the Zaliao fang on methods of burying the afterbirth. Each of the twelve small squares representing months is in turn divided into twelve posi tions, each of which represents ten degrees, one degree representing one-quarter of a day. Each position corresponding to the month is called a "small period" (xiaoshi /.h B#), while the four positions of east, south, west, and north are called "big periods" (dashi AH#)- The small and big period positions are all considered to be "dead positions" (sizvei fi), taboo times for burying the afterbirth. The other positions, the calcula tion of which recommences after each "dead" position, indicate bene powder into the vagina, some carve a penis out of an ivory tusk and use that, but both of these methods harm the life-span and cause the user to sicken and die before her time"; see Fangnei, 36a. Mawangdui yishu kaozhu correctly concludes that neijia is used with men, yue with women, but fails to see jia as a prescription for increasing the size of the penis and yue as a prescription for tightening the vagina. It also fails to give a correct interpretation of zhongshen, zhongshen kong, and qian; see 315 n. 1, 316 n. 8, 318 n. 3. 33.

In the text of this work, the first section consists of a dialogue between Yu and You Pin about methods of nourishing the embryo for each month of gestation. The rest of the text concerns the burial of the afterbirth and methods of effecting the birth of boys or girls. Shiwen, "Ten questions" This work is mainly about nourishing yang, but also discusses nutri tion methods, internal conduction, circulation of qi, massage, and other items.34 It includes the following sections. 1. The Yellow Emperor's questions to Tianshi 5^ fSfi, the "Celestial Master." This section discusses "consuming qi" (shi qi ^,), i.e., circulation of qi,35 which unblocks the arteries, causes women's "yin essences" to flow smoothly, makes erections strong and firm, and "gathers yin to supplement yang" (cai yin bu yang SIIS nos. 1-7). 2. The Yellow Emperor's questions to Dacheng f$l (identity un known). This section discusses a food-cure method for recovering good skin color. The prescription includes such things as cypress seeds, milk, sparrow eggs, and malt (nos. 8-14). 3. The Yellow Emperor's questions to Cao Ao f 1 (identity un known). This section discusses "jade closing" or "stoppage" (yubi 3£f?fl), a method of consolidating semen that mainly consists of the performance of the so-called "nine arrivals [i.e., lengthy inter course] without ejaculating" (jiuzhi wu xing fiMtylSL; nos. 15-22). 4. The Yellow Emperor's questions to Rongcheng. This section dis cusses "governing qi and uniting jing" (zhi qi tuanjing ). "Governing qi" has to do with ways of deepening and prolonging qi capacity and rejecting the old while imbibing the new.

Wang Ziqiao fu's EEEpJ-55^ questions to Pengzu (Wang Ziqiao fu can be identified with Wang Ziqiao EE ~P Sr). This section also concerns the nourishing of yang, in particular, the maintenance of zuiqi the inborn source of life energy (zui being the penis of a boy), and includes the essentials of internal conduction, mas sage, circulation of qi, nutrition, and prudence in intercourse. The text mentions Wu Chengzhao (also written 8j££Bh), who is said to have attained immortality because he lived in harmony with heaven, earth, yin, yang, and the four seasons (nos. 48-59). 7. Emperor Pan Geng's Si questions to Gou Lao H? ^ (the two characters of whose name mean long life, suggesting perhaps that this is a fictitious name). This section is also about "governing qi and uniting jing." The steps of the procedure are first to assume the posture of lowered shoulders, straightened spine, and lifted buttocks, then to spread the legs, raise the anus and perform internal genital conduction. In addition, one must concentrate one's thoughts, regulate breathing, and collect and gargle saliva, etc. (nos. 60-65). 8. Yu's questions to Shi Gui Rtfi ^ (identity unknown). This section is about Yu's impotence in sexual intercourse due to over-exertion from ten years of regulating the floods. He sought the advice of Shi Gui about restoring order to his house. Shi Gui advised him to follow a strict regimen of getting up early each day, performing internal genital conduction, and drinking cow's milk (nos. 66-73). 9. Wen Zhi ~SC #1 meets King Wei of Qi jgSc EE (Wen Zhi was a famous doctor of the state of Song killed by King Min of Qi WW EE). The main topic of this section is nourishing yang. However, Wen Zhi's prescription for nourishing yang is unique in that it mainly consists of two principles: one concerns a special method of lying down (sic); the other involves the consumption of purified wine (chunjiu W ffi) and a strong flavored wine made from the Chinese chive (dujiu #MM). Both of these wines are said to benefit digestion, the circulation of qi and blood, and the dispersal of medicinal energy (nos. 74-93). 10.

"Absorbing qi" refers to using the qi of heaven and earth; that is, the finest light of the sun and moon, as obtained, for example, when in the third month of summer on the day of the strongest yang one uses a bronze mir ror, called yangsui to make the fire for cooking. "Consuming</page><page sequence="13">LI LING and KEITH McMAHON 157 yin" refers to the man's absorption of the woman's qi during inter course to replenish his body (nos. 94-101). This work seems to be taken from a number of ancient books on the art of the bedchamber and is certainly closely related to similar books in the bibliography of the Han shu. However, its contents are limited to prescriptions for nourishing yang; in short, it is a book of extracts on one specialized subject. He yinyang, "Joining yin and yang" This is a work in eight sections mainly about sexual techniques.36 The first section is about the process of intercourse and is divided into two rubrics: "the way of playing" (xidao IS IB), i.e., showing tenderness in foreplay; and "conjoining the bodies" (jie xing intromission. The former includes caressing (caodun MM),37 kissing (xiangxu BfiJ),38 hug ging (xiangbao 10 JS), and the corresponding female reactions to these (wuyu zhi zheng see below). "Conjoining the bodies" includes shallow insertion (zhen ffi), deep insertion (shenna W P3), thrusting (jue S), rhythm (shidong + Stj), positions (shijie + fp), angle, depth, and frequency of thrusting (shixiu + iff), and the corresponding female reactions to these (badong J\ ilj, wuyin £ W, shiyi zhi zheng + E Si Hi; nos. 102-111; for all these, see below). The next seven sections are as follows. The second is about the "ten movements" (shidong -Hit)), each "movement" of which consists of ten thrusts of the penis (nos. 112-115). The third is about the "ten intervals" (shijie +fr5), i.e., ten positions for intercourse (nos. 116-117). The fourth section is about the "ten elaborations" (shixiu + f#), i.e., angle, depth, and frequency of thrusts (nos. 118-119). The fifth is about the "eight movements" (badong A Si), i.e., eight types of female reaction during sexual arousal (nos. 120-124). The sixth is about the "five sounds" (wu yin Ilia) that women make when sexually aroused (nos. 125-126). The seventh is about the benefits of intercourse (nos. 127-128). The eighth is about the "ten signs of completion" (shiyi zhi zheng + S ®), that is, the sensations that arise at the end of each of the ten movements (nos. 129-133; for further elucidation of these rubrics, see below). 36.

The ancient art of the bedchamber emphasizes inhaling the woman's breath and suck ing in her saliva, both of which were done through kissing.</page><page sequence="14">158 ARTS OF THE BEDCHAMBER Zajin fang, "Prescriptions for various spells" This is a short work mainly about magic spells, half of which concern affairs of the bedchamber (Mawangdui Hanmu boshu, 159 nos. 1-11). For example, it advises that if husband and wife are in discord, they should paint a five-foot square above the lintel of the door. If one wants to gain the favor of a lofty person, one should paint five-foot squares on both sides of the door. To gain someone's favor, one should take a drug made from the tails of two female birds. Another prescription for marital discord calls for four each of a male bird's talons and a young girl's left fingernails to make a drug to apply to the body or clothing; one may also take the hairs of the left eyebrow to make a drug to be administered internally; both methods will cause the spouse to respond. In ancient times, this type of magical art was used by women and was called "the art of charming" (meidao M M). The terms "lintel," menmei fJE! #8, and "left eyebow," zuomei tEM, seem to be intentional homonyms with the word mei M, "to charm," "to gain favor," while men H and hu p, "door," are perhaps symbolic of the female genitals.39 The meidao flourished in the Han, when it was often proscribed and was referred to in legal terms as an abominable transgression.40 Other references occur in the Shanhai jing and elsewhere.41 Tianxia zhi dao tan, "Talks on the loftiest way under heaven" This work is mainly about intercourse and is similar to He yinyang. It contains altogether twenty sections, the first two of which are without headings, while the other eighteen are headed by "Tianxia zhi dao tan":42 a series of questions and answers between the Yellow Emperor and Zuo Shen If about "why it is that humans are born with the genitals (yin yang !§), the nine apertures, and the twelve joints all intact but the genitals die first" (163 nos. 12-14).43 2. discusses the "three attainments" (sanyi H fit), which have to do 39.

The Terminology of the Mawangdui Arts of the Bedchamber The above seven works contain special terminology for the genitals, intercourse, its methods, the reactions it causes, and various parts of the body. The terminology is in some cases particular to the Mawangdui texts and in others consistent with later usage. Sometimes the meanings are highly debatable. In the following I attempt to sort these terms out, define them, and, in cases where there is doubt, elucidate their meaning by comparison with later bedchamber texts and the interpretations of other scholars. The categories under which I will organize the terms are: male and female genitals, the steps of foreplay up to intromission, the positions and methods of intercourse, the benefits and harms of inter course, techniques of ejaculation control, and female sexual reactions. The Male Genitals The usual term for the male genitals is yin or yang, but it must be noted that the word yin has general and restricted meanings: in general usage, yin suggests that the genitals always hide inside the clothes, as in Tianxia zhi dao tan 1 (163, no. 14): "They live in the dark and cannot get any sunlight" (SUBS*, In this case, yin refers to the geni tals of either man or woman. In the phrase, "Before and after sleeping, conduct the yin," in Shiwen 8 (150, no. 7), yin refers to the male genitals. What in later times is referred to as yangwei HjH, male impotence, was formerly called yinwei HI H. However, in restricted usage, the male genitals are referred to as yang and the female as yin, as in Tianxia zhi dao tan 20 (166, nos. 64-5): "The yang is the outer,. . . the yin is the inner." More specialized terms for the penis are as follows: yuce 3£ Hi, "jade whip." See the "X jin" section of Yangsheng fang, 107, no. 83; Shiwen 2, 145, no. 12; and He yinyang 6, 156, no. 125. One should bear in mind the metaphoric qualities of this term in the Mawangdui bedchamber texts. For example, the "X jin"</page><page sequence="17">LI LING and KEITH McMAHON 161 section of Yangshengfang mentions wiping medication on the "jade whip" "so that the horse will stampede."44 In this case the penis is symbolized as a horse's whip, ce Hi meaning whip in ancient times, and the woman is symbolized as a horse, which explains the term "riding the woman" (yu nil %tC)^ zhongshen cf3 H", "middle of the body." See Zaliaofang 3,123, no. 6; 7, 124, no. 11; 8, 124, no. 15, where it refers to the shaft of the penis.46 zhongshen kong &lt;$* M' ?§, "opening in the middle of the body." See Zaliaofang 6,123, no. 10, in which it refers to the urinary opening. Mazvangdui yishu kaozhu mistakenly takes this and the above term to refer to the lower belly and the navel.47 The Sunti jing has a pas sage describing five virtues of the jade stalk, part of which goes as follows: "To bestow generously is its [the jade stalk's] benevo lence; to have just intervals in opening and closing [lit., "in the middle to have openings"] is its righteousness; to be able to con trol hardness [lit., "in the top to have nodes"] when upright is its courtesy; to be able to rise when desirous and to be able to stop when desire ceases is its trustworthiness; to be able to lower itself and face upward according to circumstances is its wisdom" (Fang nei, 12a). Since it is difficult to imagine that reference to the navel would suddenly be made in the midst of a passage describing the virtues of the penis, the parallel evidence of this later text suggests that zhongshen kong refers to the opening of the penis. zui M, "male genitals." See the prescription called "swelling of the vagina" in the Yangsheng fang (105, no. 64, n. 1), where it refers to the male genitals. This zui is probably the zui J® of Wushier bing fang (Mazvangdui Hanmu boshu, 51, nos. 217-9). In Dongxuanzi there 44. Mawangdui Hanmu boshu, 107, no. 83; the words signifying "to wipe" are cao 8;, dun flf, and min jfi (J§). 45. Mawangdui yishu kaozhu takes ma If to be the same in meaning as the ma of the colloquial usage pao ma 6S M; i.e., "to ejaculate," ma here meaning penis (282, n. 14). The "Weizhi" Wi s chapter of the Baopuzi refers to a method of halting ejaculation, referred to as zou ma MM, used to supplement the brain; the expression comes from the Laozi; see Baopuzi, 129; and Laozi (Zhuzi jicheng edition), 28. However, there is no evidence that ma means penis. The second part of the "X jin" says: "Wipe the vagina with a [medically dipped] cloth and the horse will then be aroused"; here ma refers to vagina. 46. This term occurs in the "Jiudi" fl i{k section of the Sunzi M ~f", where it can mean either parts of the body between the head and feet, or the genitals; see Shiyijia zhu Sunzi M "f (Shanghai: Zhonghua shuju, 1962), 3.197. The term neishen # of Ming fiction also carries this meaning. 47. See 316, n. 8, and 318, n. 3.</page><page sequence="18">162 ARTS OF THE BEDCHAMBER is a prescription "to cure the woman whose vagina is wide and to make it tight, small, and stimulated by intercourse," which says: "When about to have intercourse, place a little of it [medicinal powder] inside the jade gate. It should not be applied in too great an amount, otherwise there is a danger that the zuikong [ft ?L] will become completely blocked" (Fangnei, 47ab). Here it seems that zui refers to the male genitals, and zuikong to the opening of the penis. chizi "the red child," i.e., the naked new-born. See Shiwen 6, 148, no. 51. In the Laozi this term connotes utmost virtue. In the context of the art of the bedchamber, it is a metaphorical term for the penis. gao H, "scrotum."48 See Tianxia zhi dao tan 4,164, no. 29. In ancient times the scrotum was called gao ljS, and the testicles were called gaowan Ip^,. jing fll, "semen." There are two major differences between the ancient term jing and the modern English term "semen." Jing refers both to the fluid emission and to what is stored in the body, that is, the essential components not yet formed into semen, especially the innate vital energy of the individual (called zuiqi ^ ^ in Shiwen 148, no. 48). But jing is used with respect to both women and men (see He yinyang 7,156, no. 127), and thus also refers to the fluids of the vagina. yuquan "jade spring," i.e., semen (see Shiwen 3,146, no. 18.)49 The Female Genitals The general term for the female genitals is yin, as in Tianxia zhi dao tan 20 (166, no. 65): "The yin is the inner." But in contrast to the male genitals, the female genitals can only be referred to by the term yin; yang is not used to refer to the female. Specialized terms are as follows: cjian fff, "front." See Zaliaofang 3, 9,11,12,15,16. Mawangdui yishu kaozhu points out correctly that qian refers to qianyin fff |^, i.e., genitals, male or female, as opposed to houyin "anus" (316, n. 8). But in the Mawangdui texts, qian is used in a way that is clearly opposite to zhongshen; thus, it would be more accurate to say that it refers to the female genitals. A passage from the prescription called 48. In Mawangdui Hanmu boshu, this graph is transcribed as jt. The transcription given here is that of Qiu Xigui, "Mawangdui yishu shi du suoyi," 44. 49.

See He yinyang 7,156, no. 127, where this term refers to the sensitive spot of the woman's genitals.

The term is obviously an abbreviation of the Laozi phrase. jiaojin 3? Wi, "joining vein," perhaps the same as qianmai. He yinyang 1 has: "Enter the dark gate and touch the joining vein. The joining vein is the same as the joining artery (mai] 05) inside the dark gate" (155, no. 104). Mawangdui yishu kaozhu says it is the cli toris (400, n. 12), but this is erroneous because jiaojin is clearly said to be "in the interior of the dark gate." yudou 5®, "jade orifice." See Shiwen 2,145, nos. 12-13. The Parts of the Vagina Since these texts are written for the sake of the man's understanding of the woman, the terminology for the female genitalia is more detailed than that for the male. Section "X" of the Yangsheng fang refers to five parts of the vagina: yunshi 55, guhu zhuogua $S#, fu X "££□, and X X □ □ (117, no. 202). The Yangsheng fang (67) also provides a drawing of the vagina, which contains nine terms, a significant number, as will be shown presently (see Fig. 1; only one of these nine terms over laps with the terms in Section "X": fu □). In Mawangdui Hanmu. boshu, this drawing appears only in the photo-reproduction of the original text, whereas the annotated text provides only the terms of the drawing, without clearly indicating their positions (the editors presumably cen sored any direct indication that an actual representation of the vagina can be found in the Mawangdui texts).

According to my research, clarification of the terms in the Mawangdui texts rests on the two later works, Fangnei and especially Sunti miaolun. Working backwards from the Sunti miaolun, I have reconstructed the meaning of the Fangnei terms, from which in turn I have reconstructed the meaning of the terms in the Mawangdui texts. Table I above is the result of these reconstructions. While they are of course conjectural, I hope they will clear up some of the problems of previous interpreta tions. Question marks indicate that, even though a literal translation is provided, the sense of that translation is unclear. From this comparison with Fangnei and Sunti miaolun, it is apparent that the nine terms of the diagram appended to Yangsheng fang corre spond exactly to the nine terms of the reconstruction from later texts. Of the nine, chizhu is the clitoris, qinxian is the labia minor, and fu X the labia major; all three are part of the external genitalia, while the other</page><page sequence="21">LI LING and KEITH McMAHON 165 it □ □ Fig. 1 Diagram of the vagina included in the Yangsheng fang six terms refer to parts of the interior of the vagina. The importance of the number nine can be gathered from several sources. The Sunti jing refers to the "nine areas of sensation," cungan jiubu if JlS A nft (9b); the Xuannti jing refers to the "woman's having nine palaces," nil you jiugong (4b). These must have to do with positions in the vagina, of which the Fangnei mentions quite a few, but which have so far been difficult for scholars to identify. The Sunti miaolun offers important clues to these mysteries in its explanation of the "eight valleys," bagu A of the vaginal canal.50 With the addition of the clitoris on the outside, these eight add up to nine, which is the number of positions found in the Mawangdui texts. According to the Sunti miaolun, from qinxian to yushu (or tuoxi) is con sidered shallow; from yingnti to gushi deep; and from choushu (or yuque) onward is considered too deep (perhaps yuque, "pass," refers to the passage from deep to too deep). According to the Yufang mijue, choushu is behind gushi and in front of kunshi (27b), thus supplying the interpre tation given here. Only the positions of yushu and yingnti are less clear; and other terms found in the Mawangdui texts are unidentifiable.51 Concerning the word for inch, cun \f", it can be explained according to 50. See Mishu shizhong, 125, in van Gulick, Erotic Colour Prints, vol. 2. 51. Of the other terms besides these nine, e.g., guhu (lanhu), zhuogua, fengji, fanqu, heyu, chilu, etc., all are unidentifiable except forfengji, which from a passage in Tianxia zhi dao tan 20,166, nos. 63-64, seems to refer to the labia. Mawangdui yishu kaozhu (438, n. 16) also takes fengji as labia.</page><page sequence="22">166 ARTS OF THE BEDCHAMBER two anciently employed standards. In the first, called fucun Jff \f", four finger-breadths equal a fu and one finger-breadth equals a am.52 The second standard for cun is from acupuncture, which takes as one cun the distance between the two acupoints yuji and guan ||.53 Generally speaking, the cun in ancient times is around two centimeters. The eight cun here divide the inside of the vagina into eight sections. The significance of these eight plus one terms becomes further appar ent when one considers the important concept "nine shallow and one deep," for which depth and shallowness are gauged by these eight inner positions. The interlinear notes to the "Dale fu" quote a passage original ly from the Sunii jing, but no longer found in the extant version: "One inch into the vagina is the qinxian, five is the gushi. To go past the gushi is death" (2b). In other words, to go past the gushi is considered too deep and thus harmful. The Yufang mijue indicates that harm to the woman starts at a shallower depth than for the man: "Harmony of yin and yang takes place between qinxian and maichi. The yang suffers harm if it goes past the kunshi; the yin suffers harm at the maichi. If thrusts are shallow, then cji accumulates; if thrusts are deep, then cji disperses" (Fangnei, 27b). Going past the gushi is also considered harmful to the five organs. In the Sunii miaolun, one to three inches is considered "shallow"; four to five is "deep"; six to eight is "too deep." "If thrusts are too shallow, then there is no pleasure; if too deep, then there is harm." To go past the gushi "harms the five organs."54 Two other terms that distinguish between the exterior and interior of the vagina in the Fangnei are, respectively, "jade gate," yumen 31H, and "red room," zhushi 7^ =£l.55 The former corresponds to the "jade stalk," yujing 3£ M., and is widely used. Shiwen 2 refers to the yumen as "jade orifice," yudou 3£ W, while the Sunii miaolun refers to it as the "red gate," hongmen &amp;Ef"J (Mishu shizhong, 122). In addition, though of less relevance to the Mawangdui texts, the Dongxuanzi contains a long list of terms, which I define as follows: "cinnabar cave," danxue (which, accord ing to the Sunii miaolun, is deep in the womb at a spot three inches behind the navel); "yang terrace," yangtai JE (deep in the danxue); "divine field," shentian f$ EH (the exterior of the vagina); "nether valley," yougu (the interior of the vagina); "dark garden," xuanpu ~S, Bfl (the 52.

Intercourse itself is apparently thought to be comprised of two stages, foreplay and intromission. The acts of foreplay are called xidao Wt, iS, which include caressing (icaodun MM), kissing (xiangxu fflfffij), and embracing (xiangbao see He yinyang 1, 155, nos. 105-6). Unfortunately, many terms referring to parts of the woman's body are difficult to define. My interpretations below are based on the idea that foreplay should follow a series of sequential steps along adjacent parts of the body. Thus, caressing starts from the woman's hands and finishes with the vagina, with altogether fourteen positions. In Table II, I compare my interpretations with those of Donald Harper and Mawangdui yishu kaozhu (see Fig. 2). All interpreters more or less agree upon 1-4, 6, 9, 12 and 13. Diver gences in interpretation are relatively great with respect to numbers 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 14. My conjecture is that zaogang IS, meaning "stove," may be a metaphor for the head, the mouth being like the opening of the stove. I take chengkuang it, "holding the basket," to mean the shoulders, because at this point it would be inconsistent if, as Harper 56. The major source for these terms is Fangnei; for danxue and yangtai, see 11a and 17a; for shentian and yougu, see 11a and 18b; for xuanpu and tianting, 18b; for biyong 11a; and for jin'gou, yuli and ruitai, 11a and 18b. 57. His Erotic Colour Prints of the Ming Period provides an appendix on the termi nology of the art of the bedchamber. He believed correctly that yumen is the vagina, biyong (which he translates as "Examination Hall") is the major labia, and yuli is the lower bridge between the minor labia, and was more or less correct in believing that maichi is the orifice of the vagina, yougu the womb, and danxue the vaginal passage. But he erred in stating that ruitai refers to the major labia and that jin'gou is the clitoris. He corrected these errors in his later Sexual Life in Ancient China after having consulted the Eisei-hiyosho, stating that ruitai is the clitoris and jin'gou the bridge between the upper part of the minor labia (see p. 127n). 58.

Positions and Methods of Intercourse Sexual positions are important in the art of the bedchamber through out the tradition. For example, of the ten positions found in various Mawangdui texts, half can be found in both the "Nine Methods" (jiu fa fl W:) of the Xuannu jing and the "Nine Positions" (jiu shi % f§) of the Sunii miaolun, both of which I will use to verify the earlier texts.</page><page sequence="26">170 ARTS OF THE BEDCHAMBER The ten positions of intercourse are translated as follows, with inter pretations given when possible:59 1. hu you M W, "the tigers play." This corresponds to the "tiger's stance," hu bu of the Xuannti jing (14a-15b) and Sunti miaolun (Mishu shizhong 121-122), which describe the woman on all fours, head down, buttocks raised, with the man kneeling and entering from behind, thus resembling tigers' intercourse. 2. chanfu (Pff), "attached cicada." This is also seen in the Xuannti jing (15a) and Sunti miaolun (122), which describe the man as lying on top of the woman lying on her stomach, the man entering her from the rear; the image is of a cicada (the man) perching. 3. chi huo (R) IS, "inchworm." For each move it makes, the worm arches its back. 4. junjiao S (ff) tH (M), two "deer locking" horns. Dongxuanzi (16b) has the term "unicorn's horn" (qilin jiao iM^), but this refers to external play prior to intromission. 5. huangzhe 41^, "locust spreading (its legs?)." 6. yuanju ft (St) 8, "the monkey latches on." This term perhaps cor responds to yuan bo H W-, "the monkey pounces," in Xuannti jing (15a) and Sunti miaolun (122), which define it as the woman lying on her back with the man upright, holding up her legs as he enters. The monkey stands for the man. 7. chart zhu Hf (jjt) ft, "toad." 8. tu wu % If, "the rabbit flees." This term corresponds to "the rabbit licking hair," tu shun hao in the Xuannti jing (15b), and tu shun in the Sunti miaolun (123), which define it as the man lying on his back with the woman sitting astride him facing his feet and having him enter from behind. The image is of a rabbit (i.e., the woman) escaping. 9. [jingling # (ff) ^ (&amp;&amp;) (qingting if Si), "dragonfly." 10. yu zuo fePU, "sucking fish." This corresponds to "the fish sucking scales," yu sha lin (^) P, in the Xuannti jing (15b-16a), which defines it as the man lying on his back, the woman straddling him facing his head. The image in the Mawangdui text is of a swim ming fish, i.e., the woman, sucking in food, i.e., the penis. In the Sunti miaolun (123-4), yu sha is completely different, referring to two women drawing their vaginas together for the man to enter. 59.

To begin with, both arts imitate animal behavior.60 In addition, both arts employ breathing methods and meditation. Tianxia zhi dao tan, for example, frequently adds notes after positions containing the words si wai §H (possibly referring to changing the direction of thoughts) or xi nei H F*-] (possibly referring to holding the breath). A passage in Sunti jing says: "If the jade stalk does not move, then it will shrink and die. Thus one ought to regard frequent intercourse as an exercise of internal conduction" (3b). This quote illustrates the overlap between intercourse and internal conduction. In all cases, once a position is assumed, attention must be given to specific angles of entry, depth, and frequency of thrusting.61 The angles consist of upward (shang zhi _h*L), downward (xia zhi T £), left (zuo zhi ~tsL and right (you zhi iL). Thrusting consists of fast (ji zhi ^ i_), slow (xu zhi #;i), with long intervals (xi zhi # [W\ iL), and with short intervals (shu zhi Mi *!)• Depth consists of shallow (qian zhi Si) and deep (shen zhi W^L)-62 In addition, a list of techniques called the "Ten Elaborations" (shixiu ~H#) is given in several texts as follows:63 1. zhi qi 3%Mi, "make the qi arrive." For example, He yinyang 1 says: "Strike upward, do not enter, and thereby make the woman's qi arrive to oneself" (155). In the Sunti jing the term appears as fol lows: "The man [has intercourse] in order to make the woman's qi arrive to himself, the woman in order to expel illness. They are thus happy and gain in strength" (9a). The Yufang mijue says: "Make the qi arrive and direct it downward as one pleases" (27b). 2. dingwei perhaps "to accumulate jing." Wei perhaps ought to be read as mo $5, "thick liquid," as in the zhi mo and he mo fO ^ of the "Eight Benefits" below, which refer to "accumulation of jing." 3. zhijie tnffi, perhaps "to control rhythm." 60. See the "Jingshen" iff I# chapter of the Huainanzi rp (Zhuzi jicheng ed.), 105; and the "Zaying" $t JSl chapter of the Baopuzi, which refers to numerous types of exercises for internal conduction, including yuanju W S8 and tujing M (jing is an error for wu H); Baopuzi, 274. 61.

The Xuannujing says: "Insert the jade stalk deeply and stimulate the baby girl (yingnii regulate the depth, and hit the target of her shi"-, also, "A long while of inter course will stimulate her shi and make her feel pleasure" (15a). The Pengzujing says: "Play in the cinnabar field and seek for her koushi □ H" (6b). Shi seems to refer to the spot(s) where the woman is most stimulated. 5. bi shi ££&gt; Bf, perhaps "to master timing." 6. tong cai (#), "joining cat (lit., "material)," perhaps a reference to commencing intromission. 7. weidong Wi )3i (®), "gently move." See Shiwen 3: "Wait for the joining of cji, then gently move the body. If one can do this until the stage of the five sounds and then take her jing into oneself, then one who is deficient in energy will be repaired, one who is strong can prolong his vigor, and one who is aged can achieve long life" (146, nos. 16-17). The term seems to refer to gentleness and slowness of thrusting. 8. dai ying f# (fvf) S, "await climax," ying meaning that all the required movements have been completed. Tianxia zhi dao tan 3 says: "Thrust gently and make a rule of waiting until repletion" (163, no. 21); that is, control emission until the climax of pleasure. 9. qi sheng "reach the extreme of life," perhaps to reach climax. 10. xi xing S M "stop the movements of the body." He yinyang 1 says: "Finish the conjoining of bodies" (jie xing yi mo S )¥&gt; 155, no. 110); Tianxia zhi dao tan 13 says: "End the conjoining of bodies" (jie xingyi hun ficfflj-lii.#, 165, no. 47). These terms are the same in meaning. The Benefits and Harms of Intercourse The Mawangdui bedchamber texts also discuss the benefits and harms of intercourse. In the case of the "Eight Benefits," the idea is to adopt certain positions or perform certain actions at certain times and thus derive healthful effects, which Tianxia zhi dao tan gives as follows:64 1. zhi qi tnSa,, "govern [i.e., circulate] cji"; upon rising in the morning, kneel, straighten the back, then extend the legs, lift the anus, and cause the qi to sink down (see also Shiwen 4). 64. See section 5, "Eight Benefits" (164, no. 31) and section 7, "Governing the Eight Benefits/' (164-165, nos. 33-36), from the latter of which the following explanations are derived.</page><page sequence="29">LI LING and KEITH McMAHON 173 2. zhi mo St W-, perhaps, "arrival [i.e., accumulation] of jing"; while eating, suspend the buttocks, straighten the back, lift the anus, and thus cause the qi to circulate freely.65 3. zhi shi (£D) B#, "mastery of timing"; before intromission, to en gage first in affectionate foreplay until both partners are filled with the urge to have intercourse. 4. xu qi "accumulation of qi"; during the course of love-making, relax the back, lift the anus, and cause the qi to sink down. 5. he mo fOi-fc, "the joining of genital secretions"; during intercourse, thrust slowly and gently and thereby attain the utmost harmony of joining secretions. 6. qie qi ia,, "stealing qi"; the man lies down and has the woman cause his penis to become erect, but has her stop just as the penis reaches its fullest state. Since this is sometimes referred to as ji qi fft "to accumulate qi," the method seems to be part of the process of building up qi in the man. 7. dai ying yf (#) £K, "await climax"; when sexual climax is about to occur, tense the back, be still, hold the qi in and make it sink, and in this way motionlessly "await climax." This seems comparable to dai ying above in the "ten elaborations." 8. ding qing &gt;j[ fcjl (M), "finally to ejaculate"; after the "ten move ments" are completed and the man has ejaculated, he withdraws while still erect. Compare this to the later Dongxuanzi passage: "The man must not return dead; he must come out alive. Other wise he will suffer great harm. He must exercise utmost prudence" (lib). Shiwen 3 has the same use of qing bjt, "to ejaculate": "Do not let the jade spring flow out," where "jade spring" refers to jing (146, no. 18). Sections 6 and 8 of Tianxia zhi dao tan also associate intercourse with seven types of harm or discomfort (sun fit; 164, no. 32, and 165, nos. 37-9): 1. neibi ffl, "inner blockage," of blood and qi, manifested by pain during intercourse. 2. waixie tfS, "outer leakage," of jingqi, symptoms of which are sweating during intercourse. 3. jie M (Si), "depletion," and drying up of qi and blood caused by lack of moderation. 65. These first two are similar to the first two of the "Eight Benefits" of the Sunti jing (19a-20a), which are otherwise quite different from the Mawangdui texts.</page><page sequence="30">174 ARTS OF THE BEDCHAMBER 4. zvu #J, "dysfunction," the failure to become erect when desiring to have sex. 5. fan 'M, "disturbance," i.e., being out of breath and confused during intercourse. 6. jue IS, "exhaustion," of the jingqi caused by forcing intercourse when not desiring it. 7. fei Jt, "wasting," of qi and blood, the symptoms of which are ill ness after each intercourse. In the Sunti jing, the "Seven Harms" of intercourse are generally the same as those in the Mawangdui texts. They are: 1) jue qi $SIR, "exhaus tion of qi," which corresponds to jue IS; 2) yi jing S "overflow of jing," which corresponds to wu ^?J; 3) za mai ft IE, "disorder of the arteries," which corresponds to fan 'M; 4) qixie H "leakage of qi," which corresponds to waixie 5) jiguan jue shang §S MIS, "injury to vital parts," which corresponds to fei Jt; 6) baibi H Rfl, "one-hundred stoppages," which corresponds to neibi |?9 7) xue jie US.

Sunti miaolun, however, describes "Symptoms of the Five Harms," wushang zhi hou 2 % M, which con cern harms to the woman.67 Ejaculation Control One of the most important techniques in the tradition of the bed chamber arts is ejaculation control. The various terms for ejaculation are: shi SEE, "release, let go" (see the section of the Yangsheng fang on "impotence," bucji j£S), which is also found in the Fangnei; c/ing kjt, "discharge, flow out" (see Shiwen 3,146, no. 18); xing JL, "disperse, scatter" (see Shiwen 3, no. 19); and jue $£, "breach, overflow" (see He yinyang 2,155, no. 112). In the Mawangdui texts, the technique for ejaculation control is called "jade closing," yubi 3E ffl. The highest goal is to ejaculate after the "ten movements" are completed or not to ejaculate at all. The benefit of not ejaculating improves with each "movement" and can eventually prolong life and cause one to "attain spiritual illumination."68 In later 66. See Vangnei, 20a-21b. 67. See Mishu shizhong, 128-9. 68. See the "Nine Movements" section of Shiwen 3, 146, nos. 19-22, the "Ten Movements" section of He yinyang 2, 155, nos. 112-115, and the "Ten Movements"</page><page sequence="31">LI LING and KEITH McMAHON 175 texts, Sunti jing describes the "Ten Movements without Ejaculation," shidong buxie + lift , which is generally the same as the technique of "jade closing" (Fangnei, 22a); but the Yufang zhiyao, quoting the Xianjing "fill S, refers to a method not found in the Mawangdui texts, that of pressing with the fingers between the scrotum and anus to halt ejacu lation (22b-23a). Two of the most crucial concepts of ejaculation control in later texts are the thrusting method of "nine shallow and one deep" (jiu qian yi shen —W) and the practice of "returning the jing to supplement the brain" (huan jing bu nao M ffi M IS), both of which scholars have often misinterpreted. Both find their origins in the Mawangdui texts, especial ly the concept of regulated thrusting. He yinyang 2 says: "The ten movements begin with ten, then go to twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, and up to one-hundred" (155, no. 112). It is clear from this that one "movement" is made up of ten thrusts and that ten movements therefore equal one hundred thrusts. But even this interpretation must be qualified since it is improbable that the ancients thought exactly one-hundred thrusts would make one "attain spiritual illumination." The number ten is often nothing more than a round number signifying fullness. The decimal system in ancient China took ten as "small fullness" (xiaoying /_hS) and one-hundred as "big fullness" (daying jz W). "Ten movements" should be taken as signifying fullness and repletion and not as a literal number. Likewise, Shiwen 3 (146, nos. 19-23) mentions only "Nine Arrivals" (jiuzhi tiM, "Arrival" being equivalent here to "Movement"). Yi xinfang frequently refers to the "number 9 X 9" (jiujiu shu 'JI j|$C) or "nine shallow, one deep, 9 X 9 = 81, the yang number is complete." In both cases the figures are intended as round numbers, with each "ten" con sisting of "nine shallow and one deep." The interpretation of the term "await climax" (dai ying) above under "Eight Benefits," as well as of the term used below, "Ten Completions" (shiyi), must comprehend this qual ification. Dysfunctions of the Penis Besides ejaculation control, the Mawangdui bedchamber texts also discuss dysfunctions of the penis, which Yangsheng fang describes as follows:69 If the penis is angry (nu M, i.e., aroused) but does not grow large, it section of Tianxia zhi dao tan 3, 163, nos. 22-24. See also below on the technique of "returning jing to supplement the brain." 69.

If it is large but not firm, it is because the jin S5 has not arrived. If it is firm but not hot, it is be cause the cji has not arrived. If the man attempts to have intercourse before the fu has arrived, then his penis will droop. If he attempts to have intercourse before the jin has arrived, his penis will shun. If he attempts to have intercourse before the cji has arrived, his penis will be laggard. (116, nos. 198-199) Fu possibly refers to the skin of the penis, jin to erectile tissue, and qi to the penis's dilation with blood. Female Sexual Reactions Female sexual reactions and states of arousal take up a great part of these texts, dividing into reactions prior to and after intromission. The ones prior are enumerated as "Five Desires," wuyu as found in He yinyang 1: First, the qi rises, the face heats up; slowly kiss. Second, the nipples stiffen, the nose moistens; slowly embrace. Third, the tongue becomes thin and slippery; slowly draw closer. Fourth, waters flow between the thighs; slowly caress. Fifth, the throat dries and she tries to swallow saliva; slowly rock her. (155, nos. 106-108)70 The reactions after intromission include "Eight Movements," badong A Sfr, which consist of signals the woman gives to direct the man's movements. The "Eight Movements" section of He yinyang 5 (156, nos. 120-121) explains them as follows: 1. The first movement is "joining the hands," jie shou by which the woman shows that she desires to bring the bodies close together. 2. The second is "extending the elbows," shen zhou fH (#) ^ (M), which indicates that she desires to have the upper part of the vagina stroked. 3. The third is "flexing the ankles," zhi zhong jE M; she feels entry is not deep enough. 4. The fourth is "hugging him from the sides with her legs," ce gou ffl ($U), which means that she desires to have the left and right sides of the vagina stroked. 70. See also Tianxia zhi duo tan 17, 166, nos. 54-55, under wuzheng and wuyu. Later equivalents of these five can be found in Sunti jing (12b) under wuzheng zhi hou E® "Indications of the Five Signs," and Sunti miaolun (127-8) under wuyu zhi hou H "Indications of the Five Desires."</page><page sequence="33">LI LING and KEITH McMAHON 177 5. The fifth is "hugging him from below with her legs," shang gou _h /&amp;J (#&amp;J); she desires to have the lower side of the vagina stroked. 6. The sixth movement is "pressing the thighs together," jiao gu JSKt, which indicates that she feels entry is too deep. 7. The seventh is "heaving upward," pingyong zp ft (SI); she desires that entry become shallower. 8. The eighth is "rocking left and right," zhen dong t§ fjj; she desires her partner to stay joined with her for a long time.71 In addition, there are "Five Sounds," wuyin 2 U" (if), associated with the woman's excitation. The five terms can be found in Tianxia zhi dao tan 15 (166, no. 50) and their explanations in Tianxia zhi dao tan 20 (166, nos. 63-4). 1. The first is the sound of "panting from the throat," houxi (H§|) S, showing that the vaginal fluids are copious. 2. The second is the sound of "panting from the chest," chuanxi #[ (Kffij) ||, showing that the qi and blood are surging upward and that the vagina is open wide. 3. The third is constantly "calling out," leiai M l§ (M); she sways her buttocks, her vagina opens and closes. 4. The fourth is "exhaling," he 0c (D^C); after the climax of excitement, the vagina feels hot and tingly. 5. The fifth is "biting the lower lip," nie (if); her body sways, showing that she wants her partner to continue intercourse for a long time.72 The Mawangdui bedchamber texts also contain a category called the "Ten Completions," shiyi + E, which describe the states of arousal at the end of each of the "Ten Movements." He yinyang 8, entitled "The Signs of the Ten Completions," gives them as follows: After one movement is completed (each movement consisting of ten thrusts), there will be a cool and refreshing feeling; after two movements have been completed, there will be an odor of burnt bones; after three movements, there will be a feeling of dryness; 71. See also Yangsheng fang, section X (117, no. 203), and Tianxia zhi dao tan 14 (165, no. 49) and 16 (166, nos. 51-53) under baiong and baguan.

This stage is called dazu great completion. (156, nos. 129-131)73 Sexual climax in the woman is described in several places (the main words for climax being mei H, yang M, and yan'gan II ~0"74) as in the fol lowing excerpts: After intercourse is finished, her cji will pass through the master gate (zongmen Ih f"!); then it is time to contemplate the Eight Movements, listen to the Five Sounds, and observe the Ten Signs of Completion. (He yinyang 1,155, nos. 110-111) Intercourse is finished. Her sweat has not dried, her cji passes through the blood gate (xuemen ifll H). She swallows saliva, sways her vagina; her blood flows freely through her arteries, and her tendons and bones feel light. Now observe the Eight Movements in order to understand how the cji circulates; attempt to understand the Five Sounds in order to know their sequence. (Tianxia zhi dao tan 13,165, nos. 47-48) The manifestations of the stage of great completion (dazu are: moist air comes from the nose, the lips turn white, the hands and feet move erratically, the buttocks rise off the mat. When inter course is finished, she hardly breathes (?), as if she were dead. At this time, the cji from the inner extreme (zhongji tf3 IS) billows forth, energy gathers within, and thus she attains spiritual clarity (shen ming jji$0f|).

All are found at least by the Han, while some aspects of all these concepts can be traced to the Ma wangdui texts. Fangnei contains many references to the method of "nine shallow and one deep." The Sunil jing coordinates it with the "Eight Benefits" and mentions the numbers "nine times two," "nine times three," etc., on up to "nine times nine." The Xuannti jing coordinates it with the "Nine Methods" and has "the number of five times nine" (wujiu zhi shu SJf), "six times nine," "three times eight," etc. But the clearest explanation of this concept is not found until the Sunii miaolun: "Make shallow thrusts nine times and a deep thrust once. Time each thrust with exhalation and holding of breath. This is called the method of nine shal low and one deep." The concept of "shallow and deep" and the taking of ten thrusts as a unit probably have their origins in the Mawangdui texts, which, however, provide no clear evidence of how the counting is coordinated.75 The concept of "riding many young women, but ejaculating rarely," is found mainly in four sources: the Pengzu jing (Fangnei, 3a-b, 6a), the Fangnei quotes of a book by Feng Junda M Wi 'Si (6b), the Yufang mijue (Fangnei, 6a-b), and the Yufang zhiyao (Fangnei, 22b). "To ride many young women" means to change sexual partners frequently and to choose young women who have not yet had children. The frequency of change can be as high as "changing the woman after each movement" (yi dongji yi nil — it) f® H ;£c, Yufang mijue), or "changing more than ten women in one night" (yi xi yi shi ren yishang — J| + A iik _h, Feng Junda); in these cases, the "ten movements" originally meant for one woman are spread out over ten or more. Besides age, the standards for a "young woman," i.e., virgin (shaonti 'Ptc.), are various and are directly related to the later Taoist concept of "selecting the cinnabar stove" (ze ding J?}fff).76 The frequency of ejaculation should vary according to the man's age and health.77 Similar contents are found in the Mawangdui 75. See Sunii jing in Fangnei, 19a-20a; Xuannti jing, in Fangnei, 14b-16a; and Sunti miaolun in Mishu shizhong, 138-139. 76. See Fangnei, "Haonu" and "Enii," 33a-35a. 77.

The earliest occurrence of the expression "returning jing to supple ment the brain" is in the Laozi xianger zhu &amp; of the late Eastern Han.78 For a detailed description one must look to the Qianjin yaofang =f ^ (see juan 27, "Fangzhong buyi") and the Xian jing f[Ij (quoted in the Fangnei, 22b). The essentials consist of methods of circulating qi and applying pressure to the ping yi Jf St acupuncture point in order to halt ejaculation and cause the jing to return to the brain. The practi tioner imagines a red qi in his "cinnabar field," yellow on the inside, white on the outside, and shaped like an egg. The size is three inches {cun). The image changes to sun and moon and enters the niyuan fta point in the brain behind the eyes. The two become one and assume the shape of the sun and moon overlapping each other. The method is also found in the Huang shu H; #, where it is called "the way of yellow and red, the method of blending qi."79 In later times it was also called "the Yellow River flowing backwards" (Huanghe niliu JIMM Stl). The tech niques involved bear strong resemblance to the methods of Tantrism.80 Important aspects of these techniques are found in the Mawangdui and other early texts; e.g., control of ejaculation and imbibing qi to re plenish the brain (see Shiwen 7: "Close off the qi in order to replenish the brain," 149, no. 63), although there is nothing as systematic as in later texts. As found in the Han bamboo manuscript Yinshu 5 | U, "Book of Conduction," the techniques of "benefiting (yi fit) yinqi" and "con ducting (yin 31) the yin" overlap considerably with the techniques of "benefiting qi" and "the way of governing yin" (zhi yin zhi dao tn^Slxtt) found in the Mawangdui texts, especially as concerns the key method of 78.

In general, male self-nurture is like the care given to the infant. One must feed and train one's genitals as one does the baby. The individual performs exercises after early rising, before bed, and at meals, in each case assuming the position of riding a horse, that is: with shoulders sloped and spine straight, tilting slightly forward from the waist, legs apart, buttocks slightly raised, and stomach protruding. Then flex the sphincter muscles and thereby flex the genitals, keeping the eyes closed and thoughts concentrated, breathing air to replenish the brain, gargling saliva, and thus breathing with and nourishing the penis. In another part of the exercises, one may also sniff the vapors from one's food before eating (Yinshu, p. 84). As seen in texts of the Wei, Jin, and later periods, in addition to pressing the ping yi acupuncture point, the flexing of the sphincter muscles in coordination with proper breathing is a key part of the exercise of huan jing bu nao.S2 In Baopuzi, Ge Hong says, "In recent times there have been more than one-hundred techniques for the art of the bedchamber. . . . The essence of these techniques lies in returning jing to nourish the brain. This technique is taught by special adepts through oral instruction and is not put into writing. . . . The books of Xuannii, Sunii, Zidou, Rongcheng Gong, and Pengzu transmit the general methods, but do not articulate the details" (pp. 149-150). Elsewhere he notes that such non-written formulas reach as many as "several thousand words" (p. 129). To Ge Hong they are far more important than what is found in the books on the art of the bedchamber. Conclusion: The Art of the Bedchamber and Ancient Chinese Culture The Mawangdui works are the earliest extant texts concerning the art of the bedchamber in the world. That such a complete system existed more than two-thousand years ago should be noted by all modern students of the history of sexuality. Given its potential attraction to modern sexologists and other scholars, it must be properly seen in the context of ancient China, especially in light of certain fixed concepts that 81.

The three following themes are central to the Mawangdui texts on the art of the bed chamber. The first is "to harmonize with the heavenly way" (he tiandao h"5cJ8), which has to do with the study of "calculations and technical arts" (shu shu SlM)r from which derive many sorts of sexual taboos.83 The second is "to nourish life," (yang xingming ft 14 np), which is the main goal for the inter-related branches of "prescriptions and techniques" (fangji fj); i.e., medicine, art of the bedchamber, circulation of qi, nutrition, and internal conduction. The third is "to unite husband and wife and to propagate descendants" (he he fufu, yanxu zisi 1=5" ^ W, MM-p if), which concerns family, marriage, seeking progeny, and eugenics.84 A thorough study of ancient Chinese sexual culture is beyond the scope of this examination of terminology in the early and later tradi tions. But keeping in mind the above three themes, we can discuss a few areas of ancient culture that influenced or were influenced by the art of the bedchamber. The early formation of Daoism, that is, the pre-Qin Daoism of Laozi and Zhuangzi, has always been an important topic of research in the history of Chinese thought. It is important to note the difference between this pre-Qin school of Daoism and the Yin-yang school, which deals with "the way of heaven" (tiandao %M); that is, heaven, earth, the four seasons, yin yang, and the Five Phases. Daoism deals instead with "the way of humans" (rendao A M); that is, nourishing life, longevity, and spiritual enlightenment (shenming ft B£j). Yin-yang is related to the study of "calculations and technical arts" (shushu), that is, astronomy, the calendar, mathematics, divination, and physiognomy; Daoism con cerns "prescriptions and techniques" (fangji), that is, medical science and nourishing life. The dao discussed in the Laozi is not that of heaven and earth as found in the Yin-yang school, but of the birth and transforma tion of things in the universe. The dao in the Laozi is something beyond things and human beings; it is a type of infinite source, a primitive creative force that "takes nothingness as the useful" (yi wu wei yong lil, M M ffl)- In order to explain this dao, the Laozi uses the metaphor of a huge, boundaryless, bottomless genital, the "mysterious female" (xuan pin ffc).85 Pin in other contexts can be translated as vagina; however, this would be too literal in this case. The concept in the Laozi is similar to 83. See Fangnei, "Jinji" S 35a-38b. 84. See the "Yiwen zhi" in the Hanshu, 30.1779 (the preface to the Fangzhong" J§ 41 section) and the "Qiuzi" T~ section of the Fangnei, 28a-33a. 85. See Wang Bi, Laozi zhu (Zhuzi jicheng ed.), 1 (ch. 1) and 4 (ch. 6).</page><page sequence="39">LI LING and KEITH McMAHON 183 that of an "earth womb." All existence is said to arise from this empti ness, which exemplifies a kind of myth of anthropomorphic origin. Based on this fundamental concept, Daoism has always emphasized that pin, the "female," is victorious over or superior to mu %t, the "male" (or that ci M. is superior to xiong We)- Also, emptiness prevails over fullness (or gu #, the "valley," is superior to ling M, the "mountain"), low prevails over high, tranquillity over motion, soft and weak over hard and strong. In addition, the Laozi takes the jing of the infant to create a metaphor explaining the dao; that is, the so-called "naked infant," chizi ifc-p, which is described as follows: "Its bones are weak, its tendons soft, but its grip is firm. Before it knows the union of male and female, its penis is aroused."86 Other uses of sexual metaphors include that the manner of a large state should be modelled after "the world fe male" (tianxia zhi pin 5c T ch. 61), and that "In the union of things in the world, the female constantly uses tranquillity to prevail over the male. Because she is tranquil, she must take the lower position."87 From Han onward, many ideas and terms of the art of the bed chamber come from the Laozi, most prominently xuanpin, "vagina," and chizi, "the infant's penis," the original yang. These terms, current at the end of the Eastern Han, can all be found in the Mawangdui texts as well. Another important part of the diversity of early Daoism is the move ment which spawned the peasant rebellions of the late Eastern Han. In the attempt to re-establish a supposedly older rural social order, the movement mainly employed two methods for uniting the peasants, one called "paying money and grain" for membership (lian qianmi ^ £1 yft), the other "joining the cji of yin and yang" in intercourse (nannti he cji h" is,). The first had to do with mutual economic support, the second with the art of the bedchamber, which peasant members were to prac tice with each other. The two leaders of the Tianshi dao ^ gtfi M, "the Way of the Heavenly Master," Zhang Ling 35 W and Zhang Lu 54 H, were the main transmitters of these teachings. Their text was the Laozi xianger zhu, which used the concepts of the art of the bedchamber to interpret the Laozi and taught that the art of the bedchamber would be stow longevity.88 Another text was the Huang shu, which transmitted the 86.

It is probably the case that it was formulated by Ling and propagated by Lu; at any rate, it represents one school of thought. In the Shenxian zhuan If -fill M, the biography of Zhang Daoling says: "In curing illnesses, he used methods taken from the books of Xuannii and Sunii but made slight changes; the essence was still the same"; (Siku quanshu ed.), 5.282. The Laozi xianger zhu says: "The true Way is to teach</page><page sequence="40">184 ARTS OF THE BEDCHAMBER "way of yellow and red, the method of blending qi" (see above),89 and through its numerous rules and rites exerted a strong influence on the Daoism of this peasant movement. As further witness that the art of the bedchamber was widely practiced in this period, the "Fangshu lie zhuan" W M chapter of the Hou Hanshu and the Bowu zhi W both indicate that the fangshi it (famous "necromancers" or "masters of prescriptions") of the late Han and the Wei-Jin periods frequently involved themselves in the arts of the bedchamber.90 Research must begin anew on the transmission of the art of the bedchamber in order to elucidate further its influence on the culture and society of this period. (It should be noted, for example, that the expression he qi is found in the Mawangdui texts.) In spite of Kou Qianzhi's xKMxL (365-448) reform of Taoism in 415, in which he eliminated the practices of "paying money and grain" and "joining the qi of yin and yang," the transmission of the art of the bedchamber continued uninterrupted. But since the Song, the art of the bedchamber became shrouded in secrecy. Many sects left no written texts and thus are hardly recorded in official historical sources; even the Daozang almost completely censors texts containing erotica. Of the secret sects, the ones transmitting the art of the bedchamber were influenced by Wei Boyang's St {0 Eastern Han Can tong qi # ["19k, and all use alchemical terminology; e.g., "caldron and stove" (dinglu M ffl), "lead and mercury" (qiangong 5^), etc. They have traditionally been categorized as works of inner alchemy, neidan P9 Although they are distantly related to the art of the bedchamber, they use quite different terms and concepts and in general tend to be more esoteric in nature. The emphasis tends to be on "harmonizing with the heavenly way" and "nourishing life," but not on "uniting husband and wife and propa gating descendants." Finally, references to sexual love are common in Chinese literature starting from the Shi jing and the Chu ci and stretching through the people how to transform jing into shen. The false Way that is popular in recent times is travesty and quackeiy. The propagators of this false Way purport to be teaching the works of Huangdi, Xuannii, Gongzi, and Rongcheng Gong. Although they attempt to withhold ejaculation during intercourse and to return the jing to supplement the brain, they are unable to concentrate their energy and completely fail to attain their goal"; see Rao Zongyi, Laozi xianger zhu jiao jian, 12, 38. From this it seems that, although Zhang Ling based himself on Rongcheng, Xuannii, and Sunu, he was considered to be separate from the other schools popular in his time. 89. The Huang shu is also by Zhang Ling. See Rao Zongyi, Laozi xianger zhu jiaojian, 104-5. 90. See Hou Hanshu, 72.2703-51, and Bowu zhi jiaozheng, 61-5.</page><page sequence="41">LI LING and KEITH McMAHON 185 poetry of the Han to the Tang. Works like the "Gaotang fu" ?35 IS K, "Meiren fu" HAW, "Tongsheng ge" |§I1|!$C, and "Dale fu" are prominent examples of early erotic poetry and are accompanied and followed by a whole line of works extending from Tang and Song classical tales (chuanqi fU nf) to Ming and Qing vernacular fiction. Late Ming-early Qing erotic fiction is especially notable in its explicit descrip tions of intercourse, but also in its counterpoint of sexual hedonism against the themes of the ephemerality of pleasure and karmic retribution. Pictorial art has also made its contributions, including illustrations for the art of the bedchamber and erotic picture books, both especially prominent in the late Ming and early Qing, when they were printed in exquisite editions with multicolor images. The wave of such works reveals the hedonistic aspirations of the urban literati of that period. Compared to the early erotic tradition, these later works leave far behind the scope of interest found in "harmonizing with the heavenly way," "nourishing life," and "uniting husband and wife and propagat ing descendants." These works are of interest to students of the social history of late imperial China. In his Sexual Life in Ancient China, van Gulik viewed the censoring policies of the Qing rulers as a sign of the end of a so-called healthy an cient sexual culture. But this cannot have been the case; Chinese sexual culture, healthy or not, did not suddenly close off after having all along been "open." On the contrary, a tension has always existed between laxness and prohibition, the interaction between which has taken many forms over space and time. It is necessary to continue investigating the history of sexuality up to the present, always keeping in mind the ancient art of the bedchamber, even when it may no longer seem to exert influence. The ancient art of the bedchamber is a topic that extends into many areas: health, "nourishing life," marriage and family, religion, art and literature. Ancient Chinese culture viewed from the perspective of the art of the bedchamber is a field of study that should no longer be ignored.</page></plain_text>
