<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mara, Buddhist Deity of Death and Desire by Patricia Eichenbaum Karetzky Buddhist doctrine does not deny the existence of the Vedic deities, maintain? ing that they are irrelevant to the pursuit of enlightenment since they themselves are subject to the laws of karma. The appearance of the compelling figure of Mara, God of Death and Desire, created as the prime adversary of the Buddha, is therefore both ironic and contradictory. Recent studies explore the character of the deity M?ra, examining the complexity and multiplicity of this Buddhist symbol of evil, but no reference has yet been made to the artistic monuments and their invaluable record of the evolution of Buddhist thought. These works of art provide evidence of the progressive development of M?ra, and the ongoing challenge for artists to picture his multifarious aspects. M?ra, called evil and identified with death is not responsible for the origin, cause or necessity of death (*). His long association with demons and terrifying aspects of dying is not symbolized by the depiction of M?ra as a gruesome and deformed image. Rather he is portrayed as the epitome of earthly beauty, exemp? lifying his other person, Lord of Desire, God of Love. A study of the multiple characters of M?ra is in actuality an analysis of the nature of evil. In the 4th-century A.D. Sravaka bhumi of the philosopher Asanga, a quadripartite personality was enumerated which became a subject of speculation until the present time (2). They are M?radevaputra (God), Marana m?ra (Death) Klesam?ra (Passion) and Skandham?ra (Aggregate condition of Life). These have variously been interpreted as the activities of M?ra (3), or aspects of mortality (the universal condition, internal causative-karma, external causative, and death itself (Boyd 1971: 63). But M?ra's plurality has also been under? stood in a less explicit way: since it is a given postulate that M?ra, like the Vedic gods, is subject to the laws of karma, it is more a station or office O O'Flaherty (1976: 221) discusses Yama, the Vedic deity of Death, and his lack 3f responsibility for death, the necessity of death, and the great suffering that results when yama ceases to kill ? the even greater evil of overpopulation. Nowhere in Buddhist litera? ture is the responsibility for death attributed to M?ra, nor is the reason for evil explained. (2) Boyd (1971: 63) is one of many authors to analyse Asanga's theory. (3) Wayman (1959: 114) gives this interpretation. 75</page><page sequence="2">visited by successive occupants than independent personality (4). M?ra's mul? tiplicity, expressed as early as the Buddhacarita, ascribed to the 2nd century A.D. (5), indicated a comprehensive understanding of the nature of evil, while the unity implied in the figure of M?ra (6) symbolized any and all opposition to the path of enlightenment (Ling 1962). M?ra as either god of death or lord of pleasure is an impediment to the conquest of the Wheel of Causation. This is best illustrated by the multiple attempts of M?ra to prevent Siddh?rtha, the Bodhisattva (7), from achieving total enlightenment as told in the numerous texts narrating His biography (Hsiu Using Pen Ch'i Ching: 183 ff.; T'ai Tzu Ts'ui Ying Pen Ch'i Ching: 470 ff.; Kuo Ch'? Hsien Tsai Yin Kuo Ching: 640 ff.; P'u Yao Ching: 510 ff.): M?ra appears at the time of the Great De? parture, not just on the eve of the Enlightenment, and is even active in the choice of time for the Great Decease (8); he is seen attempting to confuse and perplex the audiences of the preaching Buddha (9), and also as a pain in the stomach of the monk Moggall?na (10). The complexity and grandeur of M?ra's character increases. The maxim ? the greater the adversary the greater the victory ? explains M?ra's expanding stature. This is manifest in the Mah?vastu, a narrative s?tra ascribed to the first centuries of the Christian era, where "Kotis of M?ras" (Boyd 1971: 65) are enumerated as part of the cosmic universe. The foreign religions influential at this time, and the evolution of the Mahayanist school, may be detected here in the theory of trichiliocosm (Boyd 1971: 65), innumerable worlds, each independently ruled by a Buddha and naturally a M?ra as well. Before turning to the artistic evidence, a more in depth analysis of the multiple characters of M?ra is necessary. It will be shown that the Vedic (4) Eliot (1921: vol. I, 337); Boyd (1971: 69) takes exception to this theory, con? testing that the multiple M?ras do not exist simultaneously and are therefore part of another concept. (5) Boyd (1975: 100) notes this use of the plural in the Buddhacarita; this text is ascribed to the philosopher Asvaghosa, legendary advisor to king Kaniska. Their dates are the subject of a long controversy and may be generally ascribed to the lst-2nd century A.D. Beal (1894: vi) gives a good explanation of Asvaghosa and Kaniska. (6) Ling (1962: 46, 65) emphasizes the remarkable unity of the character of M?ra. (7) This is the term applied to the Buddha before His enlightenment; it designates the highest spiritual attainment as a man. (8) This is one of the themes of the Mah?parinibb?na suit a (III 55) where the Bud? dha relates how M?ra approached him and said: "Pass away now!" and Buddha accuses his disciple ?nanda of aiding M?ra by not begging him to remain in the world a little longer (Rhys Davids 1898: 7). (9) Boyd (1975: 87) cites the Samyutta Nik?ya and Mah?vastu for examples of M?ra's ability to confuse and perplex. (10) Ling (1962: 52) gives the account of the monk's stomach pain and its cause ? M?ra attempting to hinder the monk's progress. 76</page><page sequence="3">prototypes for the roles of M?ra, members of his army, and even daughters are present. The development of M?ra and his depictions in art are however, a uniquely Buddhist achievement I. Mar anam?r a} M?ra as Death As the name M?ra etymologically means death (12), this identification is foremost. The earliest mention of the name M?ra is in the Atharva Veda: he is introduced as Yama, Aryan King of the Dead, as Mrtyu, Death, and evil slayer Agha M?ra. He is variously called the "evil one who kills", or "the evil one ? P?piy?n" (La Vallee Poussin 1914: 407). Though the term P?piy?n indicates one who is morally bad, it is generally held that this is also misfortune, sorrow and pain, all of which are inextricably intertwined (13). P?pa in the Rg Veda is understood as the condition when ? People are evil minded, adultery is evil, incest is evil ? (14), but in the Atharva-Veda (15) (which is considered to be much later) sleep, exhaustion, misery, old age, baldness, greyness, theft, bad deeds and falsehood are all grouped together as evil. The Vedic king of Death, Yama, is also a complex figure with many ro? les. Acquiring his realm by being the first to die, he rules over a new ter? rain (Wayman 1959: 46). Secondly he is the first to perform the horse sacrifice for the benefit of the dead. Because of this act he was associated with horses and horse sacrifice in Vedic times (16) but in later Hindu mythology Yama's mount is the buffalo (17). M?ra is shown riding a horse or at the head of a cavalry assault in early Buddhist art (1S), but this is rarely seen. As king of the dead, Yama is ruler of a sub-solar universe. All bodies, with (n) Ling (1962: 30) strongly contends that M?ra is a Buddhist creation. (12) Boyd (1975: 73) states "M?ra is the Nomen actoris to the causative agent M? rayati. M?ra's army is called Maccusena rhosts of death5; M?ra himself is given the title Maccuraja ""king of death?. (13) OTlaherty (1976: 73) analysed the meaning of P?pa as "suffering, distress and misery". (14) Ibid. p. 7 cites the Rg Veda, 4, 4, and 10, 10. (15) Ibid, cites the Atharvaveda, 11, 8: 19-20. (16) Wayman (1959: 131) elucidates the solar personality of Yama and his relationship to the horse sacrifice. (17) Wayman (1959: 131); also Macdonell (1898: 150) who quotes the Rg Veda's 7, 77, linking of Yama and the Celestial Courser. (18) Marshall and Foucher (1940: vol. II, PI. LXI) has M?ra in the company of a cavalry on the western gateway in the Defeat of M?ra; and Sivaramamurti (1956: PI. XLIII, fig. 1) has a piece of coping ascribed to the 2nd century A.D. and another (PI. LXIII, fig. 4) from the 3rd century A.D. showing him on a horse. 77</page><page sequence="4">the exception of children and ascetics, were cremated in the belief that Agni, god of fire, would conduct their manas, or personal identity, to the highest realm of the sun where Yama would provide a final abode (19). That this is a solar abode is suggested by a number of myths of an antipodal hell, as in the Atharva Veda, in opposion to Yama's territory; it is called "Black Darkness" "Lowest, Blind Darkness", which is inhabited by ogresses and gob? lins (20). Yama, solar Cakravartin, is the possessor of the knowledge of im? mortality. The K?thaka Upants ad tells the story of a young brahmin sent to Yama's realm who unmoved by all promises of transient pleasures, demands instead the secret of immortal life (21). In this poem the themes of dualistic opposition, temptation, and achievement of immortality are all parallel to the Buddhist legend. This solar persona of Yama is never really forgotten, for in later Hindu myths he is described as one of the sons of S?rya, Sun-god, and in another as a Lokap?la of the South (Banerjea 1956: 437). In late Vedic literature the solar aspect of Yama is superseded by the fearful, death-dealing character (Wayman 1959: 131) who, as in the Atharva Veda, has the owl, pigeon and more commonly dogs as his messangers (22). Sleep emanates from Yama's realm (23) and finally it is Yama, as king of the dead, who judges the merits and demerits of the deceased, meting out their just rewards; in this respect, he is called Dharmar?ja (Rao 1941: 525; Wayman 1959: 62). The complex nature of Yama has been explained as the interaction of hete? rogeneous cultures, with an Iranian influence (Macdondl 1898: 173). What? ever the explanation for the extraordinary character of Yama the inherent com? plexities of the Vedic conception of death and its lord are transferred to the Buddhist deity. M?ra's primary identification, as his name implies, is with death and Yama's negative fearsome persona. Yama was never personally associated with the demons of popular mythology, but these beings were inevitably linked with darkness and death, and they become M?ra's hostile forces. Yaksas, Raksa ses, Pis?cas, Ar?tis and noxious animals fill the ranks of M?ra's troops on the eve of Enlightenment. Yaksas are, as Pali commentators explain, beings to whom sacrifices were (19) Maodonell (1898: p. 165) cites the Atharva Veda, 6, 120; 18, 3. (20) Ibid.: Atharva Veda, 2, 14; 5, 19. (21) La Vallee Poussin (1914: 405) includes this legend in his discussion of M?ra; the poem in its entirety is in Zaehner (1976: 169 ff.). (22) Macdonell (1898: 172) quotes the Atharva Veda: 5, 30; Rao (1941: vol. I, 525) further states that the most common of Yama's messengers are two dogs with four eyes. f3) Macdonell (1898: 171) quotes the Atharva Veda: 19, 5, 6. 78</page><page sequence="5">offered, as yaj- means to sacrifice (24). They are commonly believed to be terrible spirits who live on and below the earth (25). Raksases are terrestrial goblins mentioned in the Atharva Veda only in relation to a god invoked to destroy or praised for having destroyed them; in Vedic mythology Raksases have animal bodies which most often take the form of owls, vultures and dogs, the messen? gers of Yama (Macdonell 1898: 152). Or they are human in form but bearing some horrific deformities: three heads, two mouths, bear-necked, four-eyed, five footed, fingerless, feet turned backward, horns on their hands, or blue, green or yellow in colour (Macdonell 1898: 163). Raksases are mortal and disappear with the rising sun; their greatest strength occurs on the eve of the new moon (Ling 1962: 16). Pis?cas are specifically connected with the dead; they are frequently described as flesh-eaters, corpse devourers (Macdonell 1898: 164). Their name is that of a certain tribe of northwest India which is believed to have been cannibalistic (Ling 1962: 17). Ar?tis are a feminine type of goblin, personifying illiberality (Macdonell 1898: 164); they are the prototype for M?ra's daughters. These demons of popular mythology share in common the characte? ristics of being linked with disease, infertility, insanity, growing more powerful at night, and emitting loud noises (Ling 1962: 16). The relationship between these demons and M?ra's forces is explicitly and repeatedly found especially in the narratives of the battle with the Buddha-to-be on the eve of Enlightenment, for example in the Sanskrit s?tra, the Mah?vastu, written around the 2nd cen? tury A.D. (26): ?Terrible hordes of Rakshases with features of elephants, asses, horses and bulls, some big bellied snakes arose from the ground and cried: rStay him, seize him"*, a horrible cry of desperation. Others breathed snakes in their mouths, others fire, others venom. Hordes of pisacas carrying elephants rushed on foot to assault. Some carried mountain tops as they attacked the sage. Other hordes of pisacas rained down from the sky showers of hot embers. Others hovering in the air brandished wheels with blades on their rims. In the sky was the clash of weapons making frighten? ing, thunderous din ?. It is interesting to note that not only M?ra's army but M?ra himself is (24) Ling (1962: 19) makes this observation; he adds that the etymology is unsound, but indicates a connection between Yaksas and sacrifice that is common, noting specifi? cally that the ]?takas contain several references of sacrifices made to demons. (25) La Vallee Poussin (1911: vol. IV, 134) states that the different terraces of Meru have special kinds of Yaksas, such as Karotap?nis cBowl-in-hand'; M?l?dharas rGarland bearing ? and Sad?madas cAlways-drunk0. (26) Boyd (1975: 85) quotes this passage of the Mah?vastu. 79</page><page sequence="6">called: Great Yaksa, Mah?ntam Yaksam in the Samyutta Nik?ya, or Pisaca in the Mah?vastu (27). In the Buddhacarita (28): ? M?ra, Devaraja, enemy of religion, alone was grieved and rejoiced not. Lord of the Five Desires, skilled in the arts of warfare, the foe of those who seek deliverance, therefore, his name is given as Pisuna ?. M?ra is also called Namuci, the Vedic demon who withheld the rain, causing a great drought, until Indra smote him his thunderbolt (29). The assault by M?ra and his army is the climactic culmination of M?ra's role as God of Death. It is believed that the battle narrative is a late develop? ment; it is not present in the Pali canon (30). Its earliest mention is in the Padhana sutta of the Mah?vagga. There M?ra is addressed as the great Namuci (M?ller 1898: 70): ? Seeing M?ra mounted on his elephant, and surrounded by his army, I go forth to battle, nor will be moved from my place ?. But the battle is not described. The army composed of K?ma, Ar?ti and Tanh? is in its earliest stage of development as well: K?ma is the God of Desire, Ar?ti and Tanh? are two of M?ra's daughters. Later Kama becomes one of the M?ra's alteregos, and a sharp distinction is made between M?ra's daughters and army. In the earliest extant depiction of M?ra, on the Prasenajit Pillar of the railing of the st?pa at Bharhut, (c. 2nd century B.C.) a similar conception is portrayed; M?ra is only accompanied by his daughters (31). In the Dhammapada M?ra's army is described (M?ller 1898: 72): ? Lust, Discontent, Hunger and Thirst, Desire, Sloth, Drowsiness, Cowardice, Doubt, Hypocrisy and Stupor, Gain, Fame and Celebrity ?. This is the Vedic concept of evil expressed in the Atharva Veda where evil is (27) Ling (1962: 55) proposes this, citing references to the terminology in the Dlgba Nik?ya. (28) Heras (1952: 238) cites this and gives the reference to the Buddhacarita, but this is Beal's (1894: 369) translation. (29) Ling (1962: 148) explains that the drought demon Mara is even more hostile for he withholds the truth, not just the rain; he is Na-muci (Na-muncati, "non-saviour"') in the sense that he does not release his victims; additional references to Mara as Namu ci occur in the Mah?vastu. (30) Ling (1962: 146) quotes E. Thomas. (31) Barua (1936: vol. II, pis. 32-34) which show the outer face of the Prasenajit pillar. Coomaraswamy (1956: 44 ff.) discusses this identification of Mara at length. 80</page><page sequence="7">"Exhaustion, fame and power" and sleep derives from Yama's domain, while hunger is a demon (32). In the early accounts of the Pali canon the confrontation between Mara and the Buddha-to-be is fundamentally a temptation, not yet a battle between hostile forces. No differentation is made between the daughters and the army. The Sanskrit texts narrating the life of the Buddha not only include a battle description but the contest is organized into a three-pronged attack. First M?ra, in the role of Devaputra, tries to dissuade the Bodhisattva with "soft words"; then he sends his daughters to seduce him; enraged and desperate he calls in his demonic hordes. The battle takes place at night; and the forces of opposition are drawn between dark and light, evil and good. With the rising sun, victory is sure; the demons disperse. Parallel with the dualistic contest between light and dark in the Iranian religion of Zoroaster, Mainyu, M?ra's peer, also undergoes the transformation from demon to deity (Duchesne Guille min 1976: 116); but since Mainyu remains limited in power, knowledge and time the contest is not really between equals (Duchesne Guillemin 1976: 4), and Mainyu's destructive attacks continue until man's resurrection. Although simila? rities with Vedic battles have been noted (33), no true parallels exist. The Battle of the Devas and Asuras, for example, is not held between two differen? tiated forces because of the consanguinity of the contestants prior to the trial (34). The battles between Vedic heroes such as Indra and Namuci or Vrtra are clearly between evil and good, but the hero is in active pursuit of the demon. True to the pacific nature of the Buddhist philosophy, the Buddha does not agressively defend his position, but amazingly achieves victory through total passivity. This is clearly expressed in the battle scene throughout India and the Far East: the Buddha sits in Lotus position, a posture of total immobility, the hostile forces threaten from either side and above. From the half-dozen or so Sanskrit texts that narrate the battle, further developments can be sorted out. In the earlier scriptures, known through Chi? nese translations made as early as the 2nd century A.D., M?ra's troops transform themselves into creatures of monstrous deformities, armed with a variety of wea? pons (Hsiu Using Pen Ch'i Ching: 471; T'ai Tzu Ts'ui Ying Pen Ch'i Ching: 477). In the later texts, such as the Lalitavistara: 521; and S?tra of Cause and C32) O'Flaherty (1976: 30); Barua (1915: 195) quotes the Brhad Aranyaka Upanisad: 12: 1-3: ? In the beginning there was nothing (to be perceived) here whatever. By death indeed this was all concealed ? by hunger, for death is hunger ?. (33) O'Flaherty (1976: 213) notes the similarities between the contestants in the Battle of the Asuras and Devas. (34) Ibid. p. 58 discusses the consanguinity at length, as does Ling (1962: 22) and Heras (1952: 22) who adds that the consequence of the trial was that the Devas could only speak truth, the Asuras only falsehood. 81</page><page sequence="8">Effect (Kuo Ch'? Hsien Tsai Yin Kuo Ching), the battle scene is exhaustively related with dramatic tension. In the Kuo Ch'? Hsien Tsai Yin Kuo Ching: 640): ?All differed from one another in physical appearance. Some wielded scabbards or brandished swords. Others carried trees on their heads, or held golden batons in their hands. Kind after kind of weapon they carried. They changed themselves into horrible forms: boar-headed, fishheaded, donkeys, horses, dragons, bears, grizzly bears, tigers, rhinoceri, all sorts of animal heads. Some had multiple heads but one body; some had just one eye on a face; others had many eyes. Some had big bellies with elongated bodies; some were skinny with no belly at all. Some had large faces, with additional faces on the sides. Some were ashen colour and spewed fire. Some had elephant ears and carried mountains on their backs. Some had big legs and fat bodies, or long claws and sharp teeth. Some were covered with hair or naked, some had multiple faces some red, some white. A face might have a body wearing a tiger's skin, some were lions with snake's skin; or were snakes with their bodies all coiled; or had fire blazing from their heads. Some were squinting down their bows, or were sidling along leaping and hurling, or turning in the air, running and howling. These were so many different kinds of bodies that they defy description. They all surrounded the Bodhisattva. Some tried to rip open his body; others from all four directions arose spitting fire. They rushed through the air wrangling and screaming. The mountains and ravines thunderously shook. Wind, fire and ashes fell. There were invisible voices. The four great seas bubbled and flowed ?. In summation, Maranam?ra, God of Death, has subsumed the Vedic king of the dead, Yama, and this role is symbolically expressed by the martial assault of M?ra and his death-dealing army composed of the popular demons of mytho? logy. II. Klesam?ra, M?ra as K?ma Although the earliest stage in the evolution distinguishes between M?ra and K?ma, this is probably due to the extraordinary importance of the God of Desire. His subsequent integration therefore marks the climax of M?ra's devel? opment. Kama, God of Desire, is comprehended in two ways. The first reflects the tradition in the Vedas where Desire is the primordial, first cause (35): (35) Barua (1915: 195) relates the Rg Veda, Hymn X, 129 to the role of M?ra as Kama. 82</page><page sequence="9">? Darkness there was at first, concealed in darkness, this was indiscriminated chaos. All that existed then was void and formlessness: by the great power of warmth was born that unit. Thereafter arose Desire in the beginning, Desire ? Kama ? the primal germ of spirit. Sages who searched with their hearts' thought discovered the existent's kinship in the non-existent ?. Kama here is a manifestation of the early stage of religion which precedes the evolution and worship of anthropomorphic cults, as outlined by Banerjea (1956: 74). Kama is not closely related to the deity of later Hindu mythology be? cause here it is understood as ? ... no more than the inherent tendency of things to multiply and grow forth and create ? (Barua 1915: 196). Typical of Buddhist logic is the joining of Maranam?ra and Klesam?ra, for as La Vallee Poussin had so bluntly stated: "the Living are the food of Death" (La Vallee Poussin 1915: 406). Indeed Buddhist philosophy, as explicitly pre? sent in the Four Truths, holds that attachments and cravings are more of a hindrance in the pursuit of enlightenment than death, for they provide the energy for limitless rebirths (Thomas 1949: 87) (36). Eliot (1921: Vol. I, 337) points out that the connection between death and desire is clearly present in the Pitakas: ? The great evils and great characteristics of the world are that everything decays and dies and that existence depends upon desire ?. It is this role of Primordial Desire that Mara assumes which is most forbidding. The second aspect of Kama is that of the Hindu deity of desire who shoots his victims with his flower-tipped arrows. In the episode of K?m?ntakam?rti in the XJttara-k?mik?gama, Suprabhed?gama and P?rva-k?ran?gama, Kama is struck down by a mere glance of Siva's frontal eye in punishment for tempting the deity in his penitential meditation inspired by his wife's suicide (Rao 1941: II, 148). Surprisingly, mention is made of this in the Buddhacarita, where Mara boasts of his past success in light of his recent failure (37). ?He (Siddhartha) does not even notice that arrow by which the god Cambu (Siva) was pierced with love for the daughter of Mount (Parva ti) and shaken his cvow') ?. The synthesis of M?ra is complete. Furthermore, the attempt to aggrandize him at the expense of a rival deity, Siva, by overcoming the temptation to which the (36) The Four Truths are: (1) Birth, Sickness Old Age, Death, the Five Skandhas all are painful. (2) The cause of pain is attachment, that craving which leads ultimately to rebirth. (3) The cessation of pain is the cessation of craving and attachments. (4) The means to non-attachment and non-suffering is the Eight Fold Path. (37) Barua (1915: 198) presents this quote. 83</page><page sequence="10">latter had succumbed, was relished. Elsewhere in the scripture M?ra is called K?madeva, Kandarpa, God of Love armed with puspa-saras, flower arrows (38). The Dhammapada and Samyutta Nik?ya mention the love arrows of M?ra; the first tells how M?ra assaults with five kinds of musical instruments; and the se? cond that he attacks the five senses (sights, sound, smells, tastes and things to touch) (Barua 1915: 208). M?ra then is lord of the sensory world. In the early depictions of M?ra at the site of Bh?rhut (2nd century B.C.), this imagery is present: an orchestra provides musical accompaniment for M?ra's daughters' dancing, and at Sana (1st century B.C.) M?ra has a Yaksa army playing musical instruments and singing (39). M?ra's physical image is one of a lord of pleasure; he dominates the artistic monuments dressed as an idealized Indian prince in dhoti, scarfs, sandals, jewels, and jewelled turban. Other deities are shown in this attire, such as Indra and Brahm? who frequently are found in scenes of the Buddha's life, but Indra wears a crown. Almost all of the early depictions do not figure M?ra as carry? ing weapons. In the later bas-reliefs of Gandh?ra (lst-4th century A.D.) there are two traditions: M?ra holds a sword, or less frequently a bow and arrows. The scriptures most often include the bow and arrows, making the identification with Kama certain. But in later texts, such as the Lalitavistara and S?tra of Cause and Effect, both include episodes during the assault when M?ra in ex? treme frustration picks up a sword {Lalitavistara-. 525; Kuo Ch'? Hsien Tsai Yin Kuo Ching: 641). It is M?ra brandishing a sword that eventually dominates north India and the Far East, and the bow and arrows are found in southeastern India at the sites of Mathur? and Amar?vatI, and as far north as Sw?t (40). M?ra as Kama is conspicuously symbolized by his three daughters. Their names differ in the various texts, but they are most commonly called Rati (De? light) R?g? (Emotion) and Tanh? (Craving); in the J?taka Commentary (Barua 1915: 207) it is Tanh?, Ar?ti (Discontent) and R?g?. In the Buddhacarita ? Rati, Prlti and Trsn?. The Lalitavistara, which has a tendency to multiply by 500 whenever possible to express the divine and supernatural circumstances surrounding the life of the Buddha, additionally offers thousands of daughters of which only four are mentioned specifically by name (41). There can be no doubt that M?ra's daughters are beautiful goddesses (T'ai Tzu Ts'ui Ying Pen Ch'i Ching: 477): (38) Ibid. Buddhacarita, XIII. (39) See notes 31 and 18 respectively. (40) Vogel (1930: pi. LI) illustrates a Mathuran example; Sivaramamurti (1956: pi. LXIII) an example from Amar?vati; and Faccenna (1962: vol. II, pi. DXII) Sw?t. (41) Barua (1915. 207) states that there are three named in the Lalitavistara, but the Chinese version (301: p. 519) has four: Yu-fei (Conjugal-longing), Y?eh-pi (Able-to-give pleasure), K'uai-kuan (Visually-arousing) and Chien-ts'ung (Passively-yielding). 84</page><page sequence="11">? M?ra summoned three Jade Maidens. The first was named '"Desire', the second cPassion5 and the third rQuick-to-arouse-pleasure'\ The three daughters wore fine silk clothes, heavenly garments fragrant with oils, jewelled neck? laces and pearl fringes. Their conduct was lewd for their seductive sugges? tions, wanting thereby to confuse his thoughts ?. The more beautiful and appealing these women seem, the greater the victory of resisting them. The Vedic Apsarases are prototypes for these creatures, since Macdonell states that by the epic period they had become celestial courtesans; apsarases are incredibly beautiful water nymphs who sport with the gods and occasionally with men in Vedic literature (Macdonell 1898: 134 ff., note 6). However true to the laws of karma, they are mortal and subject to rebirth. Thus when they cannot tempt the Bodhisattva, they are immediately turned into old hags, recounted in the texts in most gruesome detail (Kuo Ch'ii Hsien Tsai Yin Kuo Ching: 641): ?The Bodisattva answered "You have planted small deeds which have won you these heavenly bodies, but you don't realize that they are not yours forever. When you behave in this seductive way, your bodies may be beautiful, but your hearts are corrupt. Lewdness is not a virtue, and when you die you will have to fall into the Three Evil Ways, and receive bodies of beasts or birds, from which you will find it hard to escape. You want to disturb me with your impurities. You may go! I have no need of you!". ?The three daughters became old hags with white hair and wrinkles. Their teeth fell out and they dribbled. Their flesh was emaciated, their bones protruding. Their stomachs grew as large as drums. With a cane they took enfeebled steps, unable to support themselves ?. This transformation suggests the swift passage of time, and the implication is that the Bodhisattva simultaneously conquers, or already conquered time itself. In the Buddhist literature as early as the P?li canon such statements are often made by the Buddha (42). Though this transformation of the daughters of M?ra was never attempted by Indian artist, the Chinese portrayed it frequently, and even told it in synoptic fashion, with the beautiful goddesses on the left and the old hags on the right of the seated meditating Buddha (43). In later Hindu myths Time becomes one of the attendants of Yama, a correlation may be inferred. Another Vedic source for M?ra's daughters is the Ar?tis, female goblins known for their illiberality; the similarity of names ? one of M?ra's daughters is called Ar?ti ? implies the relationship. (42) The Buddha says in the Ahguttara Nik?ya, IV 59-406 that he has "transcended the aeons", or Sutta Nip?ta 373-860: "There is neither past nor future" (Eliade 1961: 80). (43) Tun-huang Wen-wu Yen-chiu Cho-pien 1959: pi. 13 (Cave 245); pi. 16 (Cave 428). 85</page><page sequence="12">Thus M?ra as Kama is not only that Primordial Desire which began crea? tion, he is the world of attachments both sensual and sensory (44). This is ex? pressed in his demeanour and attributes, namely his daughters. III. M?ra as Devaputra M?ra is often called Devaputra, god; and in this way is called equal to Indra and K?ma (Levi 1934: 1). In the Dlgha Nik?ya it is clearly explained (Ling 1962: 96): ? Buddha is one who knows the universe, with its devas, men, with M?ra and Brahma, the whole creation, with its recluses and brahmins, the world of man and devas, by his supernatural insight he knows ?. The earliest use of the word Devaputra is in an inscription at Bh?rhut, but this is not in relation to M?ra. S. Levi (1934: 1) defines Devaputra as: ? Un etre celeste de type divin, mais qui ne possede pas integralement tous les caracteres de la divinite soit en degre, soit en qualite ?. Przyluski believes that whereas pre-canonical myth located M?ra somewhere between sky and earth, later canonical texts portray him as a deity superior to the gods of the Trayastrimsas Heavens, but still inferior to Brahm?; a growth which he attributes to Iranian influences (Przyluski 1927: 11). It is difficult, if not impossible, to map out the progressive growth of M?ra step by step. It is important to note at the outset that M?ra immediately acquired the status of a deity which Yama never attained, inspite of his role of solar Cakravartin. The stature of M?ra may be seen in the description of his dwellings; as his power increases he is not able to be contained in a single location. In earliest Buddhist cosmology for example, M?ra is thought to be ruling a special world, M?rabhava, with 60,000 assistants. In the Samyutta Nik?ya he is no longer constricted to a single abode, but ? roams everywhere "in the visible shape of murky smokiness", to catch the souls of the dying ? (La Vallee Poussin 1915: 407). In the Sanskrit biographies M?ra is portrayed meditating on his in? cumbent loss of power in a palace; but no description of it nor its location is given. M?ra as Devaputra had a realm not only of daughters, soldiers, and de? monic hordes, but also a son or sons, depending on the text. This son is a divine being who is distinguished by his good intentions. Most often he is (44) Banerjea (1956: 535) cites the Visnudharmottara where Kama is envisioned with his attendants, among whom is fierce Kala, Time the Destroyer. 86</page><page sequence="13">called Sumati, and prior to the battle he tries to dissuade his father from pur? suing a course of action which is impossible to bring to fruition and moreover self-destructive (45). In the Lalitavistara with its penchant for multiplication, attributed to M?ra are a thousand sons divided into two camps, one benevolent and the other malicious (46). In artistic monuments such as S?nci, it is a young prince who stands beside his father. In the Gandh?ran sculptures the standard image of Sumati is the young prince restraining his father from unsheathing his sword (Lyons and Ingholt 1957: figs. 63, 67; Rosenfield 1967: pi. 81). IV. M?ra as Skandham?ra M?ra as the aggregate condition of life is best described as Boyd points out in the passage from the Samyutta Nik?ya (Boyd 1971: 67): ? M?ra! M?ra! They say, Lord. Pray, lord, what is the nature of M?ra? Body, R?dha, is M?ra. Feelings, R?dha, is M?ra. Perception, the activities, consciousness, R?dha, is M?ra ?. In the last act by which M?ra hopes to prevent the Bodhisattva from becoming Buddha, he demands what right he has to achieve such a victory over the human condition. The Bodhisattva then points to the ground and says: "The earth is my witness to the extremes of compassion and self sacrifice I have displayed through innumerable incarnations during which I have spiritually progressed". In response the earth shakes and the earth spirit appears, pays obeisance and confirms the Buddha's right. In the bas-reliefs a gesture, Bhumisparsa - m?dra, which is composed of the Buddha's right hand reaching to touch the earth and call it to witness, signifies this moment. Sometimes the earth spirit is shown as a half-figure rising out of the earth with a vase of flowers with which to pay homage to the Buddha. It is perhaps this part of the legend which best explains the condition over which the Buddha triumphs. Artistic Evidence The figure of M?ra has been shown to be a synthesis of the various tra? ditions of the Vedas, popular demons of mythology, and Buddhist philosophy which combines the concepts of evil, death and desire, with the solar cult and (45) Rosenfield (1967: 25) states that M?ra's son is a caravaneer named S?rthav?ha, meaning merchant trader; or Sresthi, meaning banker; in the Lalitavistara (308: 517) he is called Po-shun; the T'ai Tzu Ts'ui Ying Pen Ch'i Ching (280: 277) calls him Su-to. (46) Barua (1915: 517) points this out {Lalitavistara: 517). 87</page><page sequence="14">dualism of the Mithraic religion. The battle scene marks the climax of the for? mation of the character of M?ra, for its three-pronged attack represents M?ra Devaputra, in appearance and by his sons; Maranam?ra by the martial demons; Klesam?ra armed with bow and arrows and daughters; and lastly Skandham?ra as overcome with the earth's testimony. The battle scene provided the artist with a simplified format with which he could express the complex nature of M?ra. The evolution of the character of M?ra as outlined in the Pali and Sanskrit texts is also upheld in a view of the artistic evidence. The earliest depiction already noted, occurs at Bh?rhut. There is no portrayal of Sumati, nor the army of demonic goblins. M?ra sits as a pensive prince in the lower left, his daughters dance and sing to the right. Due to proscriptions against depicting the Buddha, a tree represents the divine presence. The victory over M?ra in the upper panel has devas who throw flowers on the Bodhi tree which is housed in its palatial enclosure at Bodh Gay?. Further identification of the scene is pro? vided by the inscription on the front pillar "Bhagavato Sakamunino Boddho", the enlightenment of S?kyamuni (Coomaraswamy 1956: 44). At S?nci, believed to be at least a century later, the assault is told in continuous fashion along the lintel of the northern tor ana, a most important place (4T). M?ra appears in the temptation accompanied by his son, daughters, dwarf demons and soldiers. All of the elements of the story are now present, but due to the premature stage of narrative art, the story is confusingly told; the order of events disregarded. As in the Pali scriptures, M?ra's assault is not only martial but also sensual: the Yaksas sing and dance. M?ra leans his arm on his son, not yet attempting to draw his sword from its scabbard. The defeat of M?ra's army is separately shown on the architrave of the western torana. Here horses, elephants, soldiers, and screaming demons are in retreat, occasionally trampling one another in a most dramatic manner. It is in Gandh?ran art, formed during the first centuries of the Christian era, that parallels to the Sanskrit renditions are found. This is most appropriate since they were committed to writing, ending a five hundred year oral tradition, at about the same time. Here the story is similarly laid out in a logical pro? gression of three assaults, re-created with equal eloquence and in dramatic detail. The earliest bas-reliefs indicate that each event was told independently and in sequence; the later tendency to conflate and delimit is not yet apparent. This high classical art of Gandh?ra is a synthesis of indigenous artistic tra? ditions and those of the West, more particularly Rome. M?ra, his sons and daughters are treated as idealized lords and ladies of Indian society in regal at (47) Marshall and Foucher (1940: vol. II, pi. XXVIII) has the Temptation, pi. LXI, the Defeat. 88</page><page sequence="15">tire: dhoti, scarfs, turban and jewels (48). The daughters resemble the voluptuous Yaksl figures with their ample breasts, wearing sheer skirts, scarfs, necklaces, armlets, bracelets, and standing in the hip-swung posture with consummate grace. The demonic army of S?ncI with their dwarf-like proportions and grimacing miens are far more horrific in the art of Gandh?ra because the artists attempted to translate literally the verbal descriptions of the texts into physical reality, and succeeded in creating an array of deformities and aberrations. These attempts to illustrate the unattractive aspects are unquestionably the result of contact with Roman art, since such topics were illustrated since Hel? lenistic times. In fact the source for the convention of two slain, or overwhel? med members of M?ra's army lying before the Buddha's throne comes out of a long tradition of battle scenes in Roman art (49). Additionally the soldiers of M?ra's army, though sometimes dressed in In? dian fashion, are more commonly cast in the garments of the northern nomads: tunic, trousers, tall boots, scaled cuirasses, and peaked caps (50). It is perhaps the natural result of identifying one's adversaries with the Buddha's, nomadic invasions from the north being a continual threat. It is difficult to determine at what point the three scenes were conflated into one, and where this might have taken place. One might assume that it was a Gandh?ran achievement; but no examples have yet been found. The new format does occur at Mathur? and Amar?vatI, but here they are very small in scale, unimportant in their placement, and in combination with other scenes (Vo? gel 1971: pi. HI) (51). A full-scale and first-rate execution of the temptation is found in a 5th century A.D. cave, I, at Ajant? on the wall of the antechamber (Singh 1965: pis. 24, 28): Buddha, seated in the centre, largest of the figures, is in Bhumisparsa-m?dra; M?ra's daughters are on the left; M?ra, with brandished sword is also on the left, and the soldiers and demonic creatures fill the top half (48) Lyons and Ingholt (1957: figs. 61, 62) have a Temptation with M?ra and his three daughters; the assaults are more commonly represented with India, Indo-Scythian and demonic figures: one example is fig. 64; others in Rosenfield (1967: pis. 80, 81). (49) Richter (1959: 202 ff.) explains that portraying different psychological and physi? cal states of being in a realistic manner is a characteristic of Hellenistic art. The parallel of the dying soldiers is in Lyon (1957: fig. 66) or Rosenfield (1967: pi. 81); the Roman prototype of the Marcus Aurelius column is illustrated in Ackermann (1975: pi. E) b ut that author is more concerned with similarities in figural style than parallels in com? position. (50) Rosenfield (1967: 45) notes that some of the soldiers are dressed in Indo-Scy? thian garb, stating that they preferred customary clothes, though they were obviously un suited for the warmer clime. This does not explain why M?ra's soldiers are so dressed. (51) Vogel (1971: pi. H 1). This example measures a little over 2" high (pi. H 6, p. 158, p. 128) offers a second example. Sivaramamurti (1956: pis. LX, XIII) are two even smaller and less significant examples from Amar?vatl. 89</page><page sequence="16">and either side of the composition. The combined attack also appears on Guptan steles, 4th-7th centuries A.D. (Williams 1975: pis. 2, 4, 8, 9), where they are small scale, severely reduced in details and part of a cycle of four or eight of the most important events in the life of S?kyamuni. At Kizil, in Chinese Turkestan, two scenes of the temptation are found in the many cave chapels; both are murals (52). In neither of these is the three pronged assault conflated; in one the scene is in combination with the three other great events in the life of the Buddha (Birth, First Sermon and Death); a grouping that has been characterized as late and Mahayanist in usage (53). In China, at Tun Huang in Kansu Province, there are two caves with large-scale renditions (Akiyama 1968: pi. 9; Grey 1959: pi. 114b): one, cave 253, lacks Sumati restraining his father, but is complete in all other respects ? seduc? tion, transformation, attack, defeat and calling the earth to witness: it is ascribed to the late 5th century A.D. The second example, of the early 6th century A.D., is replete in all narrative details. At Y?n Kang, in Shansi, there are two caves from the late 5th century that have representations of the temptation promi? nently placed (Mizuno 1940: vol. VII, pi. 55; vol. Ill, pis. 105 ff.). Cave X, though not large in scale has all the elements of the story; Cave VI's covers the entire wall. The sole surviving illustrated s?tra narrating the life of the Buddha, the E-Inga Ky?, exists in sections in Japan (Nihon 1979: vol. XVI, 1 ff.) (54): the artist is forced to be as literal as his abilities allow since the pictures are placed on the top with the corresponding text written below. After the 6th cen? tury the temptation is increasingly unimportant, rarely reproduced and then sev? erely condensed due to the growing disinterest in S?kyamuni and his life. In conclusion, the Buddhist deity M?ra enjoyed his greatest stature when the importance of S?kyamuni Buddha was at its peak. The role of prime adver? sary reflects the needs of the religion at the time. Because at the start the means to Nirvana was self discipline and hard work, all inherent opposition to that goal was combined into a single entity. Thus the complex concept of evil was conveniently expressed in the person of M?ra. With the Mahayanist doctrine of innumerable divinities all of whom are devoted to the salvation of the uni? verse, the worship of a single historic Buddha suffered gradual eclipse, and along (52) Gr?nwedel (1912: 162) illustrates the M?y? Cave no. 19 which has the Four Events (Birth, Temptation, First Sermon and Death); and (p. 117) which is the Stepped Cave that was entirely devoted to scenes from the life of S?kyamuni. (53) Mochizuki (1960: vol. 5, 4215) offers a group of Hinayanist and Mahayanist listings of the Eight Great Events; it is not until the 6th century that the episode with M?ra is included in Chih Fs Treatise on the Four Religions. (54) Nihon (1979: vol. XVI, 1 ff.) these include a number of scrolls, the earliest of which is ascribed to the 8th century and is presumably based on a 7th century Chinese original. 90</page><page sequence="17">with it the outmoded concept of evil, manifest in the persona of M?ra. The loss of M?ra's power is dramatically set forth in such Mahayanist s?tras as the Vimalaklrti Nirdesa S?tra (Luk 1972: 41), where his temptation is a quick fai? lure and he goes unnamed.
