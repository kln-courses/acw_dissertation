<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANCIENT RELIGION CARL KERENYI: The Religion of the Greeks andRomans. Pp. 303; 124 plates. London: Thames and Hudson, 1962. Cloth, 42s. net. PROFESSOR KERENYI's new book on ancient religion consists of six essays, with an introduction and epilogue, interspersed with six collections of the visual material on which our knowledge of Greek and Roman religion is based. In the introduction he explains that his subject is not to be particular cults, but what is common to them all; and claims to have originated this point of view in La Religione Antica nelle sue Linee Fondamentali, from which the text of the present work is drawn. This common characteristic of all cults is something 'immediately apprehended and spiritually real', viz. religious Style, which can be sensed in the outlines of the cult places and the surviving examples of religious art-hence the 124 photographs, 'the very thing needed to complete a study of the subject of Style in ancient religion'. All the works of religion, myths and doctrines, rites and institutions, ways of life and com- munities, pictures and buildings, exhibit Style. The reason for a common Style is the particular 'Existence' in which these works arise. Kerinyi believes that Burckhardt and Jane Harrison were both aware of such a common</page><page sequence="2">80 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 'Existence'; but for the latter biology and sociology were the keys, not quality, artistic merit, and Style. (Here, momentarily, Style seems to mean good style.) Kerenyi asserts that not mere life (zoe) but characterized Existence (bios) is what is in question. Unlike Jane Harrison and Otto, Kerenyi is no follower of Bergson or Durkheim. The fundamental idea of his book is not 'the Philosophy of Life' but 'the human sense of a religious attitude', i.e. 'man's immediate confrontation of the absolute'. Man may confront the absolute, conceived as god, as 'the festal reality of the world', or as nothingness, with reverence, worship, or just vertigo. For the Greeks the attitude was the festal one. Since Kerenyi regards myth as concerned with Existence pure and simple, he begins with an essay on 'The Mythological Strain in Greek Religion'. His second is entitled 'The Feast'. The third compares the Greek and Roman Styles of religious experience. The fourth is about Theoria and Religio. The fifth deals with the Homeric and Hesiodic conceptions of Man and God, in sections en- titled 'The Greek Idea of Sacrifice' and 'The Laughter of the Gods'; while the sixth sees the Roman view of the relationship of Man and God typified in the life of the flamen dialis. The epilogue, 'The Religious Idea of Non-existence', seems hardly relevant to Kerenyi's argument, or, indeed, to ancient religion. Reduced to common language, Kerenyi's assertion seems to be as follows: the Greeks being Greek did things in a characteristically (good?) Greek way: there is a Greek attitude, and method of approach, to the divine, i.e. in festivals, to which archaeological and artistic remains provide a useful clue. The same is true of the Romans, except that it was not predominantly through festivals but through ritual that they approached their gods. To this assertion all readers will doubtless give their assent. The essays, which cannot be criticized in detail, exhibit the obscurity but not the brevity of Heraclitus. The basis, and often the relevance, of the asser- tions is seldom easy to discover. In contrast to the text, the collections of photographs offer a clear, direct, and powerful message. Those to whom Kerenyi is an established prophet will no doubt receive the word with gratitude if not with full understanding. Others, to whom his apparently intuitive utterances are often attractive, would be more grateful if they could see more clearly the reasons for them. Kerenyi begins by emphasizing the anthropomorphic nature of the Greek stories of the gods, their preference for the human form. He believes that their special version is to be discerned in the famous Mycenaean ivory of the two female figures holding a child, the touchingly human character of which he contrasts with the strict hieratic gestures of the snake goddesses of Crete. 'There is here a clear and general difference of Style. It distinguishes the Cretan religion from any which, like the Mycenaean ivory, expresses its meaning through a particular situation such as might occur among human beings.' In identifying the figures in the ivory as twin goddesses (or nurses) with a divine child, Kerenyi follows Picard, Palmer, and Mylonas who cites a terracotta with a similar subject found in a tomb at Mycenae (Ancient Mycenae, 65). But the identification remains highly speculative, and is not really strengthened by the reference to the Pylos tablets in the Fr series (i955), which may mention twin goddesses. Palmer (Mycenaean Greek Texts, p. 249) is confident that they do, but the difficulties, and possible alternatives, are given by M. Lejeune in R.E.A. lxiv. I3 f. As elsewhere Kerinyi's treatment of myth in this essay is based on the as-</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 81 sumption that the myth comes first (arising from Greek Existence) and cult and ritual afterwards: e.g. 'The more detailed the ceremony was, the more the original myth shone through it' (p. 181). The reviewer, like most students of Greek religion, would take the opposite view: that cult and ritual are usually social in origin, and themselves appear to generate or attract the stories that become attached to them. Another doctrinal position which emerges in the first essay and is often echoed later is that myth contains not ordinary but 'higher' truth. Using Platonic language he declares that the plane of myth is archetypal whereas the plane of bios is ectypal. Thus for him Prometheus is the archetype of human existence; and Apollo and Artemis serve as archetypes for young Greek men and women. In so far as Apollo and Artemis are connected with the seclusion of the young in the initiation rite, what Kerenyi says is incidentally true; but it cannot be exalted into a principle for the interpreta- tion of Greek religion; nor (chapter v, p. 177) can we agree with him when he talks about the gods as 'eternal Forms'. In the second essay Kerenyi develops his notion of 'the festal' or 'the festive', a quality, he says, which has been overlooked by everyone else. 'The festive quality which distinguishes certain demarcations of time attaches to all things within the compass of the feast and for those caught up within this compass and breathing this atmosphere-the festive persons themselves-is a wholly valid spiritual reality.' On p. I05 we hear of 'the festal manifestation of aspects of the world', and on p. 178 that 'time passes through regular peaks at which it is festal, that is, more present'; but the full statement comes later (on the same page) : 'It is the essence of a feast that it is, so to speak, a standstill in the world's course, a moment at which eternal Forms may show themselves and by showing themselves extend it to a motionless eternity'. Now the Greeks' religion is plainly secular, social, even political; it is an expression of their corporate life, and as such manifests every aspect of their genius in the varied succession of the festivals to which they were so much addicted. Kerenyi's idealist explanation seems a gross deformation of its character. The Greeks were fond of abstractions, but they never thought of 'the festal'. Need we do it for them ? Has a phrase like 'the inherently festive character of corn' (p. 182) any meaning at all? Chapter iii contains an interesting discussion of the difference between Greek and Roman religiosity, religio and deisidaimonia. When Kerenyi declares that the latter means a man's 'fear of that aspect of the divine in which it appears to him as his destiny', the reader should refer to the long note on deisidaimonia in Steinmetz's recent edition of Theophrastus, which reaches a different conclusion. Nor does he command our adherence, or even our respect, when he concludes: 'the presuppositions of Greek religion are neither eulabeia nor deisidaimonia, neither nomos nor nomizein, but Zeus and the gods. The pre-suppositions of the nomoi are above all the male deities, while the female for the most part form a chorus of defining prototypes around the great goddess Themis.' Chapter iv exhibits a curious use of ambiguity. Poetry is festal, presumably because it is recited at festivals. So we hear of 'the festal world of Homer' as 'a showplace for divine onlookers'; and Homeric, and thus Greek, religion can be characterized as 'a religion of show'. There is then a great deal of highly fanciful assertion about viewing, knowing, and seeing, in which Parmenides, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle have their exits and their entrances. In the early G</page><page sequence="4">82 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW classical period when the Greeks knew 'bodily and spiritual unity', 'the self- evident objects of the Greek Show are Forms'. Socrates and Plato erred by looking for these Ideal Forms in another world; but Aristotle, finding once more in this world 'the Hellenic Festal Show', restored for later ages an original unified world. It is magnificent but just not true. Aristophanes, rather than Parmenides, Plato, and Aristotle, provides the key to the understanding of Greek religion. Chapter v seems almost a parody of Kerenyi's method and manner. On p. i80 we have an unusual account of the origin of tragedy. On p. 189 we read the puzzling assertion: 'There were among the gods those who had the special character of being "the far god" or "the arriving god". What is characteristic of the Greek religion is not the place relationship of its gods with men but the fact that it could be entirely suspended, so as to make their meeting possible.' The laughter of the gods is regarded as a characteristic of Greek religion. Before Zeus, the laughing onlooker, the eternal human race played its eternal human comedy. We learn (p. 199), surprisingly, that it is Zeus's titanic heart which laughs. The Titanic joins the muster of Kerenyi's abstractions (as an original form of the Comic). In chapter vi Kerenyi wrestles, as others have done before, with the fact that Roman religion has no mythology. Some have seen it as 'demythologised'. He tells us that the mythology is there unnoticed. Theftlamen dialis by his life acted a cosmogonic myth. The argument is unconvincing. The answer to the question why there must be myth is for Kerenyi presumably that where there is Existence there must be myth. But we need not be bound by such ideological chains, and can be content to say that the Romans, being Romans, were happy with ritual alone. Kerenyi's original text was presumably in Italian, and it is possible that the obscurity is not entirely due to him. It is doubtful whether the English reader should be presented with such entities as Style, Existence, Forms, the Festal, the Titanic, etc.; and there are many places where care would have removed ambiguity (e.g. the loose use of 'this' on p. 69, 1. 17, and on p. 182, 1. 14), and there are a number of harsh phrases (e.g. p. 59 'Gods of all directions', and p. I 12 'in works which were written in Greek but had long ceased to be thought hellenically'). There are fairly frequent misprints, one of which, 'Athesteria' on p. 70, has been repeated in the index.
