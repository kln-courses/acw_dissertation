<plain_text><page sequence="1">FAHR AL-DIN AL-RAZI ON THE KNOWABILITY OF GOD'S ESSENCE AND ATTRIBUTES BY BINYAMIN ABRAHAMOV Bar-Ilan University W HAT human beings can know about God's essence and attributes is a question which has occupied the minds of both philosophers and theologians.' Since the beginning of the second/eighth century Muslim theologians have dealt with this question, generally coming to two opposing conclusions: a. God's essence cannot be known; and b. God's essence can be known. Similarly, opinions differed concerning His attributes. Actually, the Qur'an itself can serve as a source for dis- cussion of this issue. The Qur'anic verses "There is no thing like Him" (42.11) and "There is no one equal to Him" (112.4) prove, when taken literally, that God's essence and attributes cannot really be known, for God is unlike anything. However, Muslim speculative theologians have found Qur'anic verses, which do not differentiate between God's essence and attributes, wanting, and, therefore, sought to provide speculative answers to this question. Gahm ibn Safwan (d. 129/746), who seems to have been the first theologian to deal with this topic, stated that God is not a thing (s'ay')2 which may be understood as "God is not a I For Greek philosophers see, for example, H.A.

Like Plotinus, Gahm comes to the conclusion that God is not a being, because He is infinite and undefined. Consequently, God is other than creation and totally transcendent, which means that He is above all attributes.3 Another conclusion which one can draw from the denial of God's being is the impossibility to apply attributes, which are understood as entities existing in God, to God, for that which is not a being cannot be divided into parts and be composite like created things. Presenting corroboration neither Qur'anic nor speculative, Dirar ibn 'Amr (d. 200/815), HlJafs al-Fard (fl. at the beginning of the ninth cen- tury), and Sufyan ibn Sahban (or Sahtan)4 believed that God would create a sixth sense in the Resurrection whereby people would know God's essence. Thus God's essence can be known only by a divine act. Most of the speculative theologians, Mu'tazilites, Hjarigites, ST'ites, and Murgi'ites, rejected this view.5 The head of the Basran school of the Mu'tazila Abui al-Hudayl al- 'Allaf (d. 235/850) derives from God's incorporeality and simplicity that His attributes are identical to His essence. In other words, the attrib- utes belong to the divine essence but tell us nothing about it. Hence God is absolutely transcendent. One cannot perceive or define His essence by the intellect. Only through God's acts, which can be known through the signs He leaves in the universe, can we know about Him. However, Abui al-Hudayl holds that to see God in the world to come means to know Him. Like most of the Mu'tazilites, he does not state the object of this knowledge, and we can only assume that by knowing God he means knowing His essence. Two Mu'tazilites, Hisam al-Fuwati (d. before 218/833) and his disciple 'Abbad ibn Sulayman (d. 250/864) go further in asserting the impossibility of man's knowledge of God's essence, claiming that since God is incorporeal He can be perceived the 7Theology of al-Qagsim ibn IbrdhFm-Kitdb al-Mustarshid, Leiden 1996, pp. 72-83.

Unlike most of the Mu'tazilites, he refuses to ascribe any meaning to anthropomorphic expressions and also refuses to inter- pret them metaphorically. He agrees to utter these expressions only when reciting the Qur'an. 'Abbad also rejects expressions which imply mutual relations between God and man, the possibility of man's turn- ing to God, and the possibility of man's causing God to act.7 He even shuns employing the terms kd'in (being) and maw4iid (existent) as attrib- utes of God with the aim of not impugning God's transcendence. According to him, mawgad is a name which indicates nothing about God's essence. Apparently influenced by Plotinian sources, he seems to have held that God is "other than being". Therefore, terms applying to beings cannot be applied to Him. Since God is absolutely other, He cannot belong to a genus or have something which differentiates between Him and other beings. Hence, He cannot be defined.8 'Abbad's notion of God's absolute otherness dictates his relation to the divine attrib- utes. For him attributes are identified with names, and both are referred to as acts. As acts they do not refer to God's essence but merely to the traces He leaves in the universe.9 A contemporary of 'Abbad, the Zaydite Imam al-Qasim ibn Ibrahim (d. 246/860), who was influenced by Mu'tazilite teachings to a great extent,'O differs from the Mu'tazilite teaching on God's attributes when making God's absolute difference from creation His sole attribute." This notion coincides with al-Qasim's answer to the question of "what is God". "He is He" says al-Qasim expressing thereby the idea of the absolute transcendence of God about whose essence nothing can be known.'2 6 Abrahamov, "'Abbad ibn Sulayman on God's Transcendence, Some Notes," Der Islam 71(1994), p. 109f.

Therefore they have prohibited such an act stating, for example, the following tradition "Think of God's creation and not of His essence"."3 Some speculative theologians among them, however, have stressed the impos- sibility of knowing God's essence, but they have given no speculative arguments in favor of this view.'4 Contrary to the theologians' teachings above, which are reported in the primary sources in a fragmentary manner, al-Gazdl! discusses the topic in an extensive way mainly in his al-Iqtasad ft 'l-i'tiqdd'5 and al- Maqsad al-asnaift sarh ma'dnrz asmd' alldh al-husnd.'6 First, note that al- Gazali includes a discussion of God's existence in his views on God's essence. Possibly these echo Ibn Sina's thesis that states, unlike created beings, in God there is no difference between essence and existence.'7 Second, God's essence is described in both positive and negative ways. God exists in pre-eternity (qidam) as well as in post-eternity (baqd'), He is one and can be seen (mar'~yy). We shall soon refer to the last point. As for the negative side, God is neither a substance, nor a body, nor an accident, He cannot be found in a specific direction, and He does not station Himself on the Throne.'8 The important point al-Gazdl! makes in our context is the possibility of knowing God's essence in a logical way.'9 Even seeing God is possible, in al-Gazali's view, because God can potentially be seen (mar'fyy bi 'l-quwwa). If there is any obsta- cle to seeing Him, it is not God's essence but something outside His essence.20 However, by seeing God al-Gazali does not mean physical seeing but a kind of complementary intellectual perception.

Al-Gazall divides reflection on God's glory and greatness into two parts, the high- est of which is the reflection on His essence, attributes, and the mean- ings of his names. The prohibition mentioned in the famous tradition (see above) not to meditate on God's essence is explained by al-Gazll as deriving from the peril of perplexity involved in such an act. However, he points out that the righteous (al-sidd7qiin) may think about God's essence, but they cannot continue their thinking for a long time. A small part of the knowledge attained by this reflection is that God is neither in a place nor in any given direction, that He is neither inside the world nor outside it, and that He is not connected to the world nor separated from it. Because there is peril in meditating on God's essence, most people should refrain from it; rather they should think about God's majesty through His wonderful acts which are revealed in the universe.22 Contrary to God's relative transcendence which al-Gazali presents in the Ihya' and Iqtisad, in Mislkat al-anwdr23 and al-Maqsad al-asnd ft sarh ma'7ni- asma' allah al-husna he posits God's absolute transcendence. In the former work he states that God is the only real existence and that He is too great to be perceived by an entity whose existence in not real, namely, the human being. God alone knows His essence, for each object of knowledge is under the domination of the knower to a cer- tain extent, and due to God's greatness, it is inconceivable that He should be under the domination of anyone. Actually, al-Gazali's con- clusion in Miswkdt regarding God's transcendence and the impossibility to know His essence is based on his discussion in Maqsad. In this lat- ter work, he states that the real meaning of essence (ddt) is that through which a thing is what it is, or that which makes a thing this definite thing.24 To describe an essence means to answer the question of what 21 Ibid., p. 67f.

Metaphysics, 1029b, 15: "What, then, you are by your very nature is your</page><page sequence="6">KNOWABILITY OF GOD'S ESSENCE 209 a thing is (ma huwa).25 Now, according to al-Gazali, God's attributes and His names say nothing about His essence. Were we to point to a person and ask "what is it?", the phrases "he is tall" or "he is white" would not constitute answers to the question, which is about the per- son's essence.26 Al-GazalT undoubtedly refers to the components of definition, namely, genus and difference. Thus the definition of the human being's essence is not his being tall or white, but his being a rational animal. His being an animal refers to his genus, and his being rational differentiates him from other animals.27 Since knowledge of a thing means knowledge of its essence,28 it follows that God's essence cannot be known, for God does not belong to any genus, nor can He have a specific difference.29 Although the last conclusion does not appear explicitly in al-Gazdl!'s text, it is implied by the context. Even the phrase "necessarily existent" (wag'ib al-wuagd), says al-Gazal1, does not express the definition of God; it merely shows that no cause is neces- sary in order for Him to exist. And the statement "each thing derives its existence from God" means that we ascribe acts to Him. In fine, all we say about God are names, attributes and ascriptions; we are not referring to His essence.30 What is then the way to know God, asks al-Gazal1? To illustrate the answer, he gives the example of a child or an impotent person who wants to know what the pleasure of sexual intercourse is. There are two ways to convey this knowledge: a. To liken this pleasure to another pleasure which a child or an impotent person experiences; and b. To experience this pleasure. Neither of the two ways are applicable, for essence." Trans. W.D.

In al-Gazal!'s view, both ways apply to man's knowledge of God. The first is insufficient to provide us with true knowledge of God, since we describe Him through attributes and names taken from our life. When we say "God is living" (hayy), we liken God's life to our life, but we cannot know for a certainty what God's life really means, just as an impotent person cannot really know the pleasure of sexual intercourse even if it were depicted in terms of the sweetest pleasures which he does experience. We know God through the attributes taken from our experience, and this, of course, is not real knowledge of God. Therefore one must add to this knowl- edge the negative statement that God is not like other things. Thus there is no real correspondence between the attributes we ascribe to God and His attributes. In fact, for al-Gazalf the attributes are names which describe God in human terms. Only God knows the real mean- ings of His attributes. The second way, the way of experience is blocked, for man cannot attain divine attributes for then he would become God. Consequently, only God knows God. Asked what then is the object of man's knowledge of God, al-Gazali answers that the object of this knowledge is to know that man is unable to really know God.3' However, man can know the traces God leaves in the universe, namely His won- derful acts. In this kind of knowledge human beings vary, inasmuch as the more things a man knows about God's acts, the more his knowl- edge exceeds that of other people.32 In sum, we see in al-Gazali two basic approaches to the topic under discussion. On the one hand, he states that God's essence can be known, while on the other he denies this possibility. It seems that in his earlier works he advocates the first approach, and in his later works written under the influence of the teachings of the philosophers, he advocates the second approach. An examination of the chronology of the works cited above shows that Ihya' and Iqtisad were composed before Mishkdt and Maqsad.33 3' Cf. Maimonides, Dalalat al-hd'irin, ed. I.

He argues that we know of God's existence which is not separate from His essence, hence we necessar- ily know His essence. Otherwise God would be known and not known at the same time, which is an absurdity.35 However, in his later works, al-Matalib al-'aliya min al-'ilm al-ildh1d36 Mafdt ff al-gayb,37 and KIdb ma'dlim usiil al-dan,38 with the exception of an earlier work, namely Kitab al- mabdhit al-mas/riqfyyafi 'ilm al-ilIyhgydt wa 'l-tabafiyydt,39 he expresses a con- trary view. To this view we devote the remainder of our paper. In Ma'dlim al-Razi clearly states that human beings cannot know God's essence. He proves this by pointing out that man's knowledge of God is divided into four parts: a. Knowledge of His existence (wugd/d); b. knowledge of the modality (kayfiyya) of His existence, meaning pre- eternity (azaliyya), post-eternity (abad?ya), and necessity (wugub); c. neg- ative knowledge, namely that He is neither a body, nor an atom, nor an accident; and d. His relations (i.dfat) with the world, meaning His being knowing and having power. God's essence is described by these attributes, but is different from them.40 Though here our author does not elaborate on this difference, he will do so in Matalib.4' Like al- Gazali in his second phase, al-Raz! seems to hold that essence means what makes a thing that which it is, and that the attributes do not in al-Gazal!'s period of retirement.

An explanation of the difference between the attributes and the essence is given in Muhassal as the view of those who hold the unknowability of God's essence. First, they say that the essence is different from the negation of other things; that God is not a body says positively nothing about His essence.42 Second, concerning God's relation with the world which is described through His attribute of power (qudra), they state that even the essence of this attribute is unknown, for we only know that this power has an effect on the act. Likewise we do not know the essence of the attribute of knowledge; we only know that it is something which causes an act to be carried out in a perfect manner. Moreover, even if we know the essences of the attributes, this does not necessitate the knowledge of God's essence. It follows that we cannot know God's essence. The second proof is built on the basis of three kinds of perception: a. sensual perception; b. perception of what occurs in one's soul;43 and c. perception of the intellect. Knowledge can be attained by each of these three perception modes or by different combinations of them. The divine essence can- not be perceived by any of these perceptions,44 hence it is not known to us.45 Al-RazT gives no explanation for this conclusion. We can only assume that the holders of this view would say that God is totally tran- scendent, which means that we cannot describe Him in terms of human perception, whether material, emotional, or intellectual. It is worth noting that in Mabdhat, al-Razi grades possible objects of knowledge according to their power of existence. At the highest mag- nitude stands the necessary existent (wag-ib al-wugUfd) whose power of existence is absolute, because it needs nothing in order to exist. The grade of the separate intellects and the spiritual substances follows. The lowest magnitude of existence, almost bordering on non-existence, is composed of primordial matter (al-hayz7ld), time, and motion. At the middle magnitude, between the strongest and weakest, there are bod- ies, colors and all modalities and quantities. Human intellect is unable to perceive the highest magnitude of objects of knowledge because of 42 Cf. Maimonides, Daldlat, p. 92, 11. 3-4. Pines, "Limitations," p. 98. 43 Al-RazT seems to point to one kind of necessary knowledge, that knowledge which one derives from one's feelings and emotions, such as sadness, happiness, hunger, and so on. For necessary knowledge in Islamic theology see my "Necessary Knowledge in Islamic Theology", British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies 20,1(1993), pp. 20-32. 44 Literally: "The divine essence is outside these three kinds (of perception)" (al-mdhiyya al-ildhyya hdriga 'an hddihi al-aqsdm al-talata). 45 Muhassal, pp. 439-441.</page><page sequence="10">KNOWABILITY OF GOD'S ESSENCE 213 the brilliance of their power, just as the light of the sun dazzles the eyes of the bats. It also cannot perceive the lowest magnitude, not because of its weakness, but because of the objects' weakness, just as man's sight cannot perceive minute objects. Human intellect is capa- ble of perceiving only the intermediate range of objects.46 Here it is not God's transcendence or otherness which causes human inability to perceive Him, but rather His power of existence which differs from others' powers in its intensity, but not in its essence. In other words, when God is included in the hierarchy of existents, He resembles other existents at least with regard to existence, and differs from them by virtue of having the greatest power. The result, namely our inability to perceive Him, is the same, but the explanation differs. In Mabdhit al-Razf also introduces four proofs for the unknowabil- ity of God's essence. a. This proof is based on the principle that the knowledge of a cause necessitates the knowledge of its effect. Thus if we perceived the essence47 of the necessary existent, we would perceive the essences of all things with their necessary qualities (or concomitants lawdzim)48 without using proofs. The fact that we do not know the essences of all things proves that we do not know God's essence.49 This proof is reminiscent of al-Gazal! contention that to know God's essence means to be God.50 b. What man knows about God are universal attrib- utes (lit. universal things: umur kullya),51 namely that He is necessary existent, immaterial, knowing and having power. Because of this uni- versality, it is possible that others would share these attributes with God. However, His personal identity (or ipseity huwiyya ?a4h syya)52 prevents sharing attributes with Him. So what we know are universal attributes, 46 Mabahit, vol. I, p. 500f. 47 Here he uses the term haqzqa. 48 For the term lazim (pl. lawazim) see al-Gurgani, Ta'rfat, p. 199f. 49 Mabdhit, vol. II, p. 521f. 50 See p. 210 above. 51 Kullyy means that which is related to the whole, that which constitutes a part of the whole (al-mansab ild al-kull kullyy). Al-Gurgdni, Ta'rzfat, p. 195. Cf.

Al-Razil continues the course of his proof by presenting a disjunction: Either God's personal identity is different from His essence or a necessary part of it (lazima li-mdh'y- yatihi). The first possibility determines that just as God's personal iden- tity is not known to man, so too His essence. According to the second possibility, if the necessary part of the essence is unknown, the essence is necessarily unknown, for if the essence which is the cause of the nec- essary part were known, the necessary part, which is its effect, would also be known.53 c. There are two ways to know things. The first is the way of personal experience, such as the feelings of pain and pleasure, and the second is the way of likening, such as to teach an impotent person the pleasure of sexual intercourse by likening it to the sweet- ness of sugar. By this means one does not attain the essence of the pleasure sought for, but only a general aspect of it. Here al-RazT is undoubtedly influenced by al-Gazdli even in employing the example of tasting sugar.54 However, elsewhere he quotes Abiu al-Barakat who says that one can know the essence of a thing through the perception of the senses, for example, the perception of heat through touching a hot thing.55 Now, says al-Razi, God's essence is not present in our soul, meaning that we cannot experience it like we experience feelings, and His essence is likened to what one knows only through negative attrib- utes and relations. It follows that God's essence is not known to man.56 In the passage al-Razi quotes from Abtu al-Barakat it is stated that the human being cannot perceive God's essence like he perceives the heat of a thing. However, if such a perception were possible, one would ask if there is a special organ for this perception, or if no such an organ exists then only the substance of the rational faculty can operate but only when material impediments are removed. However, on the basis of the assumption that such a perception is possible by this organ, one should ask whether this organ is created or not.57 Abu al-Barakat regards all these means as possible, because there is no clear-cut proof through which one can negate or affirm them. However, at present, human beings are not capable of perceiving God's essence. This conclusion Mabdhit, vol.

Only when we know God's essence, will we be able to know His greatest name. Hence if God illuminates the heart of one of His servants with the light of the knowledge of His essence, possibly He will also give him this name.58 d. Intellection is achieved through the impression which the form of the object known leaves on the knower. This form must be equal to the essence of the object known. If we knew the Creator, the form impressed in our intel- lect would be equal to His essence and His essence would be transmitted to many persons, which is an absurdity.59 We shall see that al-Razi accepts Ab-u al-Barakat's notion that man can know God's essence only if God provides him with such knowledge.60 Matalib is one of al-Razl's last works. It can be characterized as a metaphysical work which combines As'arite theology with philosophy. Al-Razi regards metaphysics (al-'ilm al-ildha) as the loftiest science, for the rank of a science is measured according to its object. Since the object of this science is God's essence and attributes, and God is absolutely the loftiest existent, al-'ilm al-ildha is the loftiest science.6' That God is the loftiest existent is proved through several statements: a. He needs no one; b. He is absolutely simple, which means that He is not divided into parts which compose His essence; c. He is necessarily exis- tent by virtue of Himself, while everything outside Him is possible by virtue of itself and needs a cause, in order to exist; d. God is not only the cause of the things' existence, but also of their continuance and non-existence; and e. Existence is more exalted than non-existence. God, who is necessary existent by virtue of Himself, is not subject to non-existence. In contradistinction to God's nature, everything outside Himself is possible existent by virtue of itself. If we consider the pos- sible existent in itself, it is non-existent.62 Metaphysics is the most exalted science not only because it deals with the most exalted object, namely God, but also because practicing Al-Razi, Sarh, p. 103. 59 Ibid., p. 523f. 60 See below p. 221. 61 In his estimation of metaphysics, al-Razi was very probably influenced by Ibn Snia's introduction to al-Ilahyydt of al-Sf&amp;' (ed. G.C. Anawati and Sa'id Zayid, Cairo 1960, p. 15, henceforth Ibn Sina, Ildh'yydt) in which he states that metaphysics is the most excellent science on the most excellent object (or because of the most excellent object-afdal 'ilm bi-afdal ma'liim). 62 Matalib, vol. I, part 1, p. 37f.</page><page sequence="13">216 BINYAMIN ABRAHAMOV metaphysics causes man to attain the most exalted pleasure, that is the spiritual pleasure, or the spiritual felicity, which is sought by virtue of itself and not as a means to attain something else.63 There are several reasons to prefer spiritual to material pleasure: a. Man shares material pleasure with animals, but they surpass him in it. Whoever engages in material pleasures resembles animals;64 b. material pleasure does not last, while spiritual pleasure continues to exist;65 c. man's inborn disposi- tion (fitra) judges that material pleasure is contemptible, whereas dimin- ishing it is regarded as preferable;66 and d. spiritual happiness leads man to the holy worlds. In typical Razian manner, by which tradi- tional proofs come after philosophical ones,67 our author also states that prophetic pieces of evidence show that ignorance of this subject engen- ders eternal punishment, while knowledge of it brings eternal happiness.68 Another reason for preferring this science above all others is the deep satisfaction with his own essence which the perfect human being (al-insa-n al-kdmil)69 feels when dealing with it. According to al-Razi, even worldly affairs are not carried out prop- erly without knowledge of the origin of this world and its destination (al-mabda' wa 'I-ma'dd). By this knowledge he means metaphysics which includes man's knowledge of God, His angels, books, messengers, and the Day of Judgment. If the religious laws were absent, social order would disappear, and man would not be safe from injury. In sum, says al-Razil, the origin of goodness and happiness is this knowledge, and whoever perceives it stands in the highest human rank which equals the lowest angelic rank.70 63 Cf.

In placing whomever is well versed in metaphysics in the highest</page><page sequence="14">KNOWABILITY OF GOD'S ESSENCE 217 However, in al-Razi's view, one cannot attain certainty in dealing with some parts of metaphysics, and one must be satisfied with the most appropriate (al-awla) knowledge of some metaphysical matters which are attainable rather than absolute and certain knowledge.7' Several arguments are put forward to prove this contention. The foun- dation of the first argument is man's knowledge of his own essence which is the most manifest object of knowledge. However, man's intel- lect cannot fully attain this knowledge because of its hiddenness. Thus, if one cannot absolutely know one's own essence, the more so regard- ing God and His attributes. That man has some knowledge of his own essence is proved through the fact that whoever knows something, nec- essarily knows that he knows it. But the statement that man knows his own essence is not clear enough, for what do we mean, asks al-Razi, by saying "I". Does "I" mean the structure of my body, or my body, or an attribute of my structure, or a substance separated from my body? Intelligent people are perplexed concerning the answer to the question: what do we mean by saying "I"? Now, if concerning one's own essence there is no clear knowledge, the more so concerning God's essence. That is because God's essence absolutely differs from all the possible things.72 Moreover, one is perplexed also regarding the knowledge of the body, and the essence of time and place. Philosophers were divided on the definition of place. Whereas Plato, his followers, and the philoso- phers who preceded him held that place is an expression of extension of the space or void (al-bu'd al-mumtadd), Aristotle and his followers held that place is an expression of containing surface (al-sath al-muh4t), and they denied the existence of void.73 Perplexity prevails also in philo- sophical discussions about time. Surprisingly, here al-Razi does not human rank and the lowest angelic rank, al-Razi follows the epistles of the Brethren of Purity.

Sambursky, The Concept of Place in Late Neoplatonism, Jerusalem 1982.</page><page sequence="15">218 BINYAMIN ABRAHAMOV detail the various views on the topic.74 As for the essence of the body, scholars also have different opinions; some of them hold that the body is composed of atoms (al-ag'zd' allatf la tatagazza'u),75 while others regard the body as infinitely divided. Consequently, one must hold the most appropriate views which are possible concerning the subjects mentioned above, and if this is the case regarding the most manifest matters, the more so concerning God's essence, greatness, and attributes. Add to this, says al-Razi, the problems which confront those who deal with the strongest intellectual field, namely geometry, and you will reach the same conclusion.76 In his second argument, al-Razil makes a comparison between the faculty of sight and the intellect. Concerning their objects, both facul- ties have three equal states: a. The faculty of sight cannot perceive tiny objects such as a grain of dust; b. When a man looks at bright objects like the disk of the sun, he imagines darkness at the middle of the sun, which is not the real state of the sun. That is because the faculty of sight is blinded by the strong light of the sun such that it cannot per- ceive the sun as it really is; seeing becomes distorted;77 and c. The third category of objects lies at the middle between strength and weak- ness. Such are accidents subsisting in the bodies of this world which man can absolutely perceive. In principal, the same division exists with regard to the objects of the intellect: a. Human intellect cannot exactly perceive weak objects of knowledge such as the measures of tempera- ments (maratib al-amzzga), or changes which occur in the body, for these are weak states which disappear rapidly; b. Holy substances such as God's essence and His attributes and essences devoid of connection to materiality are so strong that the human intellect cannot perceive them. Here al-Razi uses an expression which resembles the second category of objects of the faculty of sight. This is "the illumination of His lofti- ness" (is'ra-q galdaihi).

Middle objects of knowledge, which are neither absolutely weak nor strong are perceived by the intellect.78 In the third argument al-Razil differentiates between two kinds of knowledge: a. perception (tasawwur); b. judgment (taydzq)?79 Elsewhere, he defines these two as follows: "If we perceive a certain thing, we can refer to it in two ways; either we consider it as it is, without judging it neither through affirmation nor negation, and this is tasawwur, or we judge it either through affirmation or negation, and this is tasdaq."80 In other words, tasawwur is to form a concept of a thing, while tasdhq is to judge this concept as true or false. According to al-Razil, there are four kinds of taawwur a. Perception of the sensibles; b. necessary percep- tion of feelings and emotions; c. perception by inborn disposition (fitra) of essences (mahiyydt) such as existence and absence, oneness and plu- rality, necessity, and possibility and impossibility;8' and d. When com- posed in different ways, the three preceding kinds of perception, which are self-evident, serve as foundations for other perceptions. The act of composition is carried out either by the imagination or by the intel- lect. For example, the faculty of imagination can perceive a sea made of quicksilver, for the faculty of sight perceives both sea and quicksil- ver. Likewise the intellect can join two objects of perception such as copartner and God to form another object, namely God's copartner. But as the intellect knows that God is absolutely one, it draws the con- clusion that the statement "God's copartner" is impossible.82 Al-Razi- concludes thus that pieces of knowledge or perceptions (tasawwurdt) attained by the intellect may only originate from these four sources. And because judgments (tasdi-qa-t) are conditioned by perceptions, the former are confined to the latter. 78 Ibid., pp. 46-49. 79 Cf. al-Tahanawl, Ka,ffdf istildhdt al-funuPn, ed. Lutfl 'Abd al-Badi', Cairo 1972, vol. II, part 4, p. 231. According to al-Gurgant (Ta'rfIat, p. 61), tasawwur means the exis- tence of the form of a thing in the intellect (husul surat al-4ay' ft '-'aql), and ta.sdaq is to regard by choice the fact informed as truthful (an tansuba bi-iht~ydrika al-sidq ild al-mubbar). On these terms in philosophy see H.A. Wolfson, "The Terms Tasawwur and Taydfq in Arabic Philosophy and Their Greek, Latin and Hebrew Equivalents, 7he Muslim World (1943), pp. 114-128. 80 Muha.ssal, p. 81. According to Ibn Sina, tasawwur is first knowledge which is at- tained by definition and the like, while ta.sdq is attained by analogy and the like. Al- Nqdgt, p. 43. 81 In Islamic theology the first three kinds are included in necessary knowledge ('ilm darirzl. See note 43 above. 82 Maldlib, vol. I, part 1, p. 49f.</page><page sequence="17">220 BINYAMIN ABRAHAMOV To this introduction al-Razi adds what he already proved, that is, God is totally different from all the sensibles known to us. If God shared with the sensibles in some aspects and differed from them in other aspects, the part in his essence which shares with the sensibles would be other than the part which differs83 from the sensibles. This would mean that His essence is composed of parts which is an absurdity. Hence God's essence is absolutely unperceivable by the human intel- lect.84 And since judgment is based on perception, there is also no way to judge, namely, to affirm or to negate His essence. According to al- Razi-, the only way open to man to know God is to examine perfec- tion and imperfection with regard to the human being, and from this knowledge to move to the knowledge of God. That is because one can perceive the absolute entity through the perception of the limited entity.85 Thus it is possible to perceive God's perfection through the perception of man's perfection without adding to God the attributes of man. Al- Razi admits that this is general knowledge about which one can say it is the most appropriate knowledge attainable by man.86 However, al- Razi- here runs a risk of expressing anthropomorphism, for the difference between God and human being turns out to be a difference of quan- tity and not of quality. The fourth argument looks at the subject matter from another angle. Passing from the known to the unknown is understood only in three ways: a. Inference of the effect from the cause (al-istidlal bi 'I-'illa 'ald al-ma'lul); b. inference of the equal (al-musdwf) from the equal; and c. inference of the cause from the effect. Concerning God, the first two ways are of no avail, because, I suggest,87 first, God, the object for which we thirst is the cause and the world is the effect, and second, there can be no analogy between two absolutely different entities. The only way which remains, says al-Razi, is to ascend from the impres- sion (atar) or effect to whomever makes it (mu'attir) or to the cause, namely God. Again basing himself on the hierarchy of existents which 83 Here the text has al-muhdlata (= to associate with) which should be replaced by al-mu4dlafa (= to differ from). 84 Cf. Pines, "Limitations," p. 92. 85 Very probably this is al-Razi's intention when he states that "the absolute is a part of the limited essence" (al-mutlaq guz' min mahyat al-muqayyad) meaning that some measure of the absolute exists in the limited essence. 86 Matdlib, vol. I, part 1, p. 50f. 87 Here al-Razi gives no explanation.</page><page sequence="18">KNOWABILITY OF GOD'S ESSENCE 221 occurs in Rasa'il I hwan al-SaId',88 al-Raz! states that man's rational soul stands at the lowest magnitude of the holy existents which are devoid of matter, namely the angels. The rational soul ascends from its knowl- edge of itself to the knowledge of its cause, and from the latter to another cause and so forth, till it reaches the presence of the neces- sary existent by virtue of itself. As a corroboration for the notion that God occupies the highest magnitude, he cites several Qur'an verses, for example, "and that the final end (al-muntahd) is unto thy Lord" (Qur'an 53.42).89 Since the rational soul is weak, most people do not succeed in escaping the world of senses, thus ascending to higher states. An extraordinary minority does ascend from the world of sensibles to the world of imaginations, and out of them a few people ascend from the world of imaginations to the world of intelligibles. However, in the world of intelligibles there are also many ranks of the holy spirits. Many excellent intellects pass away in the lights of holy spirits. Only those endowed by God with a divine soul reach the holy presence.90 In this context al-RazT mentions God's necessary existence; there is no refer- ence to His essence and attributes. He seeks to prove that metaphysics is a difficult field which only very few people can handle. The whole passage is a blend of the theory of emanation and Siifism. SiBfsm is further mentioned in the third chapter as the second way to reach God, the first path being reflection and analogy. In his first approach, al-Razi does not deal with God's essence, but only with the proof of His necessary existence through the examina- tion of the sensibles which are possible by virtue of themselves. By way of implication we can once again draw the conclusion that all we can know about God is His necessary existence and not His essence or attributes. The second way is called the way of the people of ascetic practice (ashdb al-rayd4a). Such people purify their hearts by mention- ing only God, thereby acquiring high lights and divine secrets. According to al-Razi, there are several ranks of human souls, the highest among which are the souls whose inborn dispositions turn them to love God and to know Him deeply. Other souls achieve some qualities of the former, but in a weak state. Still others, being immersed in the world of senses and imaginations, are devoid of any inclination toward spir- 88 See above p. 216. 89 A. J. Arberry, 7he Koran Interpreted, Oxford 1983. See also Qur'an 42.53, 57.3. 90 Matdlib, ibid., p. 51f.</page><page sequence="19">222 BINYAMIN ABRAHAMOV itual and divine matters. To illustrate this division, al-Raz! employs the parable of mountains and the minerals therein. Mountains and hills are divided into two kinds, those which contain minerals and those which do not. The second kind are more numerous than the first. Mountains which have minerals are divided in turn into those which contain base minerals such as sulfur and petroleum, and those which contain pre- cious minerals such as gold and silver. The former are more numerous than the latter. Moreover, the quantities of the base minerals are greater than the quantities of the precious minerals. Concerning the precious minerals, investigations show that in some mountains one has to work hard to find small amounts of gold, while in others a great quantity of gold is easily found. Between these two extremes, there are many different degrees. So on a spiritual yardstick, human souls are like the mountains, and the lights of man's knowledge of God are like the pre- cious minerals. Many souls are devoid of any inclination to the world of spirituality, while others differ in their degree of spirituality and in their ability to achieve spirituality. Just as it is conceivable that a moun- tain may conceal a cave full of gold, so it is also conceivable that per- sons separated by generations may be gifted with a cave of spirituality that is full of God's lights of majesty.9' Al-Raz- further details his conclusions from this parable. First he states that engaging in ascetic practice, even if it is done intensively, is no guarantee to attaining a state of spirituality. This notion appears in al-GazalI's treatment of the question concerning the truest way to per- ceive God. Al-Gazal! believes that although ascetic practice may bring one to perceive God, it is more likely to lead the ascetic astray by false imaginations, if he did not learn the sciences before practicing asceti- cism.92 Also another idea found in al-Gazali might be al-RazY's source: Not everybody who attains something of the divine matters, attains the objective, meaning full knowledge of God, for due to God's infinite greatness, it is impossible to reach this objective. Hence the hierarchy of happiness is infinite.93 Al-Raz! emphatically states in his teaching " This brings to mind Stoic tradition according to which the wise person is rare.

However, he does not deny that ascetic practice has some influence on the individual. Al-Razi ends this section with Aristotle's statement to the effect that "Whoever wants to begin seeking the divine knowledge should create in his soul another disposition," which means, according to al-Razil, that one should inten- sively sever his connections with the senses and imagination.94 In what he calls the second and the third maqams (ways, lit. stations) to reaching divine knowledge, al-Razi- does not deviate from the ideas stated above; to reach divine knowledge one should think only of God, for the core of one's soul, or its principal disposition fits God's presence. By this disposition al-Razi seems to regard the inner part of the human soul as divine. However, the soul's connection to the body prevents it from reaching its divine point. Anyhow, al-Razi recommends the way of reflection before engaging in ascetic practice to escape mistakes which derive from man's awareness sometimes that his highest mystical states are the highest objective which can be attained. This awareness may hinder the attaining of the true objective.95 In sum, for reaching the highest degrees possible for man of knowledge about God, al-Raz! places three conditions: a. Perfection of reflection; b. perfection of ascetic prac- tice; and c. fitness of man's soul with the divine. Also here, al-Razi does not state that man can truly know God's essence and attributes. Al-Raz! doubts not only man's knowledge of God's essence, but also man's knowledge of God's attributes. In his view, there is a direct con- nection between these two perceptions. The problem begins with God's essence. If we judged that God's essence equals the objects of our senses, soul, and intellect, God would be possible existent by virtue of Himself (mumkin li-ddtihi), for these objects are possible existents by virtue of themselves. Since God is necessary existent by virtue of Himself, it is inconceivable that He should be possible existent by virtue of Himself. On the other hand, to regard God as totally different from the objects that we perceive by our intellect will lead to perplexity and to inabil- ity to know something about God. To sum up, the two ways one which relies on the equality between the objects perceived by man and God's essence, and the second which denies any equality between God and these objects do not yield knowledge about God's essence. This conclusion severely affects the knowledge of God's attributes, for if one 94 Matdlib, vol. I, part 1, pp. 55-57. 95 Ibid., p. 58f.</page><page sequence="21">224 BINYAMIN ABRAHAMOV cannot know God's essence, how can one describe Him by attributes of greatness and holiness?96 The treatment of our knowledge of God's attributes is cardied out through stating two possibilities: either His attributes are different from His essence (mug'ayira 1i 'l-dat), or identical with His essence (al-ypfdt 'ayn al-ddt). The first possibility entails that God's essence is composed of many essences, and each composite thing is possible existent, while God is necessary existent by virtue of His essence.97 This argument cancels God's attributes as parts of His essence. As for the second possibility, one can know the essence of each attribute while overlooking God's essence. But if there is identity between the essence and the attributes, this knowledge is impossible. Furthermore, each attribute has an essence of its own which differs from other essences. Now, if the attributes were identical with one essence, the essence would be composed of many essences which is an absurdity.98 Another argument against man's knowledge of God's attributes takes as its point of departure man's experience. God's knowledge of the par- ticulars and the universals is necessarily infinite. Likewise, God's power affects all possible existents. However, that one attribute treats infinite objects in such a way that each treatment does not interfere with another is a phenomenon unknown to man from his experience. Consequently, it is difficult for the human intellect to perceive such a phenomenon.99 Here, as in the previous arguments, the difficulty to know God's attrib- utes derives from the inborn inability of man's intellect, while the difficulty mentioned above derives from the intellect's conclusion on the impossibility to define the relation between God's essences and attrib- utes. The undefinability of this relation hinders the possibility of man's knowledge of God's attributes. In the second part of Matdlib, al-Raz! continues his discussion on the knowledge of God's essence and attributes in a more detailed form. It is an elaboration of his discussion in Ma'dlim.'00 To recapitulate, what we know about God is four things: a. His existence; b. the modality of His existence (His being necessary existent by virtue of Himself and His being eternal); c. His relations with the world (His knowledge of 96 Ibid., p. 60. 97 Cf. Mafttzh, part 24, p. 128 (Commentary on Qur'an 26.23). 98 Ibid., p. 61. 99 Ibid. 00 See p. 211 above.</page><page sequence="22">KNOWABILITY OF GOD'S ESSENCE 225 all things); and d. negations concerning God (He is not in a place, He is not composed of parts). None of these four kinds of knowledge pro- vide knowledge about God's essence. Al-Razl reasons that what we know about God is not knowledge of His essence. As for God's exist- ence, it is an attribute existing in God's essence, not His essence. The same judgment applies to His being eternal, because if the knowledge of existence is not a knowledge of the essence, the knowledge of the modality of existence is more likely not to be a knowledge of the essence. Also God's essence is not an expression of what is negated from Him. Al-Raz! seems to state that when we say, for example, that God is not an accident, we actually say nothing about what He really is. Likewise, the knowledge of God's relations to the world does not provide us with knowledge of His essence.'01 The knowledge of these four things nei- ther necessitates the knowledge of His essence, for by this knowledge we only know He is a certain thing, nor what He is. Al-Raz! concludes this argument by saying that since we know only these four kinds of knowledge about God, and since we reason that they neither provide us with knowledge about God's essence nor necessitate such a knowl- edge, we cannot know God's essence.)02 The second argument, which was already discussed above, is based on the division of knowledge into perception (tasawwur) and judgment (tasdaq), the latter being a branch of the former. As mentioned above, perception or knowledge is divided in turn into four parts, perception of sensibles, of feelings and emotions, of intelligibles, and of the objects of both the intellect and imagination. Since God's essence is not an object which belongs to either of the four parts of perception, it remains unknown.'03 In the third argument al-Raz! brings forth the philoso- phers' statement that knowledge of the essence of a cause entails knowl- edge of its effects. Hence, if one knows God's essence, he necessarily knows all possible existents, which is an absurdity. Al-Raz! also put forth the philosophical idea, which is the foundation of the fourth argu- ment, to the effect that knowledge of a thing means the existence of the form of the object known in the knower. Consequently, man's sup- posed knowledge of God's essence means the existence of the form of God's essence in man, which is again an absurdity.'04 101 Cf. Mafdttk, part 24, p. 128f. (Commentary on Qur'an 26.23). 102 Matalib, vol. I, part 2, pp. 88-90. 103 Ibid., p. 90f. See p. 219f. above. 104 Ibid., p. 92.</page><page sequence="23">226 BINYAMIN ABRAHAMOV At the basis of the fifth argument lie three premises according to the first of which, if we limit a universal nature (tabt'a kullfyya)l'05 by a universal limit, the essence which is limited will be also universal. For example, a man, who is a part of a group or a species, may be qualified by a universal, such as knower, and the combination "a man who is knower" is a universal. In such a manner one can attach many uni- versal attributes to a universal entity, thus keeping the latter in its uni- versal state. In the second premise, al-Razil makes a distinction between a universal and a particular (al-sahsa, al-guz'i), the latter being a certain thing. Thus "man" is a universal, while Zayd is a particular. According to the third premise, God is a particular, not a universal. Now al-Razi argues that all which we ascribe to God are universals, which means that we make Him a universal, while God's essence is a particular.'06 Consequently, we cannot know His essence. This argument seems weak to me, because, for example, one of the universals mentioned by al- Razi is God's being a necessary existent by virtue of Himself which is God's specific quality that no one shares with Him, hence it is a par- ticular. Al-Razi is aware of this difficulty; he is asked about the attribute "one" which applies, according to the questioner, to God alone. Al- Razl's answer seems unconvincing; he asserts that the knowledge that God is one and that no one shares with Him His oneness is knowl- edge of a universal thing, explaining that "one" can be the first (aljf) or the second (ba-') in a series, and in each case it is one that no one shares with it its place.'07 It is possible to save this argument from its weakness only by referring to Ibn Sina's statement concerning this term. In his view, the term kulla, which attests to many, may apply either to many in existence, such as the word "man", or to many which can be imagined (ft gawaz al-wahm), such as the word "sun".l08 The sixth argument consists of the statements that God is infinite, while the human intellect is finite. By God's infinity, al-Razi means His eternity. That which is finite cannot perceive eternity, because eternity has no limit, whereas man's intellect perceives things in terms of limits.'09 105 See above p. 213. 106 Cf. Mafdtth, part 24, p. 129 (Commentary on Qur'an 26.23): "The knowledge that an entity has a certain concomitant (ldzim) does not provide knowledge on the indi- viduality of the entity's essence, because it is not inconceivable that different essences would share the same concomitants." 107 Matdlib, vol. I, part 2, pp. 92-94. 108 Al-Nagdt, p. 45. This example also appears in Abtu al-Barakat. Mu'tabar, p. 13. 09 Al-Sahrastan! (al-Milal wa 'I-nihal, ed. Sidql Gamil al-'Attar on the basis of 'Abd</page><page sequence="24">KNOWABILITY OF GOD'S ESSENCE 227 In the seventh argument our author states that "knowledge is a kind of overcoming the object known" (al-'ilm naw' istdld' 'ald al-ma'luim). Whoever does not know something feels inability with regard to the object of knowledge. If the intellect could know God's essence, it would overcome God in some respects. But overcoming belongs to God alone, and human beings must remain in a state of inability with regard to God."0 Like the sixth argument the eighth argument addresses to the weakness of the human intellect, but from another point of view. The intellect cannot deal with two objects of knowledge at the same time, the more so it cannot deal with the highest object of knowledge, namely God's essence. Al-Razi does not ignore the arguments of those who advocate man's knowledge of God's essence. He brings forward four arguments and the rejoinders to each of them. The first argument is based on the terms tasawwur and tasdaq mentioned above.'' Every judgment (tadi4q) must be preceded by the knowledge (tasawwur) of the subject (mawduq') and the predicate (mahmil)."2 In the proposition (qadjyya)"13 "'God's essence is unintelligible to the human being" (haqfqatuhu gayr macquda" 4 li'l-halq), the subject is "God's essence" and the predicate "unintelligi- ble.. ." Whoever ascribes this predicate to this subject has to know both the subject and the predicate. Thus it is proved that the verac- ity of the statement "His essence is unintelligible" is founded on the knowledge of His essence as the subject of this proposition. However, when we negate a subject through a predicate, we actually affirm the former's existence, which means that the negation is false; when we negate our knowledge of God's essence we affirm that we know it. Thus the proposition "God's essence is unintelligible . . ." is false, meaning al-'Aziz Muhammad Wakll's ed., Beirut 1997, p. 271) quotes a saying of Socrates to the same effect: "His knowledge, power, generosity, and wisdom are infinite. Reason cannot describe them, and if it described them, they would be finite." Cf. Judah Ha- Levi, Kitab al-Radd-wa 'l-dalalft 'l-dtn al-daltl (Kuzari), ed. D.H. Baneth (in Hebrew char- acters), Jerusalem 1977, V, ch. 21, p. 226, 11. 11-12: "If we perceived His essence, He would be imperfect" (law adrakna haqFqatahu lakdna d4lika naqsanfthi). Kaufmann, Attributenlehre, p. 326, a 190. 11 As we have seen this argument was also expressed by al-Gazali. See above p. 208. 1 See p. 219 above. 112 For these two terms see Ibn Sina, al-Nakdt, p. 51f. K. Gyeke, Arabic Logic, Ibn Tayyib's Commentary on Porphyg's Eisagoge, Albany 1979, p. 167f. 13 For this term see al-Gurgant, Ta'rfat, p. 184. 114 In the last part of the argument, which deals with attributes and states, al-Razt uses the word ma'liuma (known).</page><page sequence="25">228 BINYAMIN ABRAHAMOV that the essence is intelligible. The same argument applies to a subject such as "God's essence from the point of view of some of its attributes and states." In fine, a contradiction arises whenever we predicate in such a manner essence or attributes and states.'15 The second argument in favor of man's knowledge of God's essence begins in the same form of the first one, namely, every judgment is preceded by the knowledge of subject and predicate. Suppose we affirm the existence of attributes to God's essence, and we affirm these attrib- utes as predicates, what is the subject of these attributes? Al-Razi pro- poses two possibilities: a. The subject is the essence by virtue of itself (the way the essence is in itself); and b. the subject is the essence from the point of view of other attributes. I assume that al-Razi has thought about propositions such as "God's essence is identical to His attributes" (a) and God's essence as understood through some attributes is identi- cal to His attributes" (b). In the first case the essence, as a subject, must be known. In the second case, one should ask how the attributes are related to the essence. If they are related through other attributes, an infinite series will ensue, which is an absurdity. If, on the other hand, we finally come to affirm one attribute of the essence by virtue of itself, this essence, as a subject in a proposition, must be known."6 In principle, the two arguments state the same view, that is, in a proposition the subject must be known. Therefore, al-Raz1 replies to both of them, bringing forward the following proposition: "That which is not known is not subject to a judgment (lit. cannot be judged)," (ma ldyakunu mutasawwaran ld yumkinu al-hukm 'alayhi). Now, according to the argument of those who advocate man's knowledge of God's essence, a subject in a proposition must be known. It follows that the subject in al-Razli's proposition must be known, and this leads to a contradiction, namely, that which is not known is known. The third argument begins with the premise that we know some- thing about God. There are three possible kinds of knowledge: a. Knowledge of God's essence by virtue of itself; b. knowledge of His attributes by virtue of themselves, not by virtue of their relation to His essence, and c. knowledge of His attributes by virtue of their relation to His essence. The first possibility means that we know God's essence. The second possibility is false, because to know something by virtue of 115 Matdlib, vol. I, part 2, p. 95f. 116 Ibid., p. 96.</page><page sequence="26">KNOWABILITY OF GOD'S ESSENCE 229 itself is different from knowing it by virtue of its relation to another object. In other words, to perceive the characteristics of knowledge as it is in itself is different from perceiving knowledge as an attribute of God. According to the third possibility we know the attributes by virtue of their existence in God's essence, and this knowledge is knowledge of His essence. That is because the knowledge that a thing occurs in another is conditioned by the knowledge of these two things (the thing that occurs and the thing in which the former occurs), which means that we know this specific essence. The fourth argument begins with the statement that "there is no controversy concerning our knowledge that God is a substance (dat) which exists by virtue of itself (annahu dat qaima bi '1-nafs)."7 The object of this knowledge is either the perfection of this substance, or part of the essence of this substance (guz' min agzd' mdhiyyat tilka al-ddt), or something else outside the essence of this substance." The first possi- bility is what we are looking for, while the second possibility necessi- tates that this substance is composed of two parts or more, which means that the substance is a possible thing, for each composed thing is pos- sible. If God's essence is possible, this contradicts its existence by virtue of itself. The third possibility is more likely to be rejected, for His being a substance is an attribute outside the substance, which means that the substance is an expression of an attribute different from the substance, not an expression of the substance. It follows that the substance is not a substance which is self-contradictory."'8 Al-Raz! rejoins to both the third and the fourth arguments stating that if we know God's essence we mean by it its being existent by virtue of itself, not being in want of something else, and this is a neg- ative understanding. Negations are outside the scope of essences which means that they teach nothing about the essences."9 Concluding this section, al-Raz1 says that human beings cannot attain the knowledge of God's essence by their intellect. In sum, we have seen that, like al-Gazal!, al-Rlazi in his later works changed his mind concerning man's knowledge of God's essence and 117 Here the term dat should be translated as substance. 118 Ibid., p. 97. 119 Ibid., p. 98.

It seems that in his final approach, he was influenced by al-GazalV's later works and by Abiu al-Barakat al-BagdadL. The grow- ing influence of philosophy on theology undoubtedly caused both al- Gazali, and, to a greater extent, al-RazT to elaborate on the knowability of God's essence, a theme which had only been partially discussed in previous generations mainly by early Mu'tazilite theologians who were influenced by philosophy. Al-As"arl (d. 324/935) and early As'arites, such as al-BaqillanT (d. 404/1013), and al-Guwaynil (d. 478/1085), and the eponym of the Maturidite school of theology Abui Mans-ur al-Maturidl (d. 333/944) in his Kitdb al-tawhTd did not discuss this issue, although they sometimes pointed out man's inability to know God's essence with- out introducing arguments.'21 After al-Razi the speculative theologians have continued to examine this issue'22 but, to the best of my knowl- edge, no other thinker has dealt with it as extensively as al-Razi. 120 According to Ibn al-'Arabi's (d. 638/1240) famous disciple Sadr al-Din al-Qunawl (d. 673/1274), all the learned people agree that God's essence is unknown.
