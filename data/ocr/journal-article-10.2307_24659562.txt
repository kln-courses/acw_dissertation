Michael Naas DerauL University Abstract This essay traces (he history of Jacques Derridas engagement with the question or the animal and the methodology Derrida follows in his 2008 The Animal That Therefore I Am. As Derrida demonstrates, the history of philosophy is marked from its inception by an attempt to draw a single, indivisible line between humans and all other animals by attributing some capacity to humans (e.g., language, culture, mourning, a relationship to death) and denying it to animals. Derrida thus begins by questioning the supposed fact that animals do not have such and such a capacity or attribute but then quickly turns to questioning the principle by which philosophers have claimed that humans do. In all his work on the animal, therefore, Derrida questions the confidence with which humans attribute certain capacities to themselves while denying them to animals, all in the name of a pervasive and yet repressed violence against the animal world. Keywords Jacques Derrida, deconstruction, animals, logocentrism He had a certain flair, Jacques Derrida did, and for that he was often criti cized, sometimes even denounced, and especially by other philosophers. He had a certain flair in his person, to be sure, but most especially in his lan guage, in the way he did philosophy, in what we naively like to call his "style," and this is no doubt what drew the greatest fire from his detractors. He had a flair for language, true, but also for argument, and for the ways in which philosophical argument must always be tracked through the thickets of lan guage; and claims, no matter however universal or abstract, must always be followed, ferreted out, and picked apart through the idioms of particular lan guages, and in his case, for the most part, the French language. Thus Derrida demonstrated that even in philosophy the nets and snares we use to pursue our game, the signs we follow to pursue the objects of our chase, are always in some way complicit with, and are always in part determined by, what they © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2010 DOI: 10.1163/156916410X509931</page><page sequence="2">220 Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 seek. In other words, the hunter is always in part—though only in part— determined by the game he is pursuing and the game he is playing. That is why Derrida had no illusions about the possibility of the philoso pher simply surveying the objects of his or her pursuit from above, of observ ing objects from on high without having to put his or her nose to the ground in order to follow the traces. And he knew, of course, that when you are fol lowing a scent or reading a sign, rather than simply describing an object from above, the risk is always great of being thrown off the path or getting caught oneself along the way. That is why, for Derrida, the philosopher needs not only a capacity for clear and reasoned argument but also—and there is no better term here—a certain flair, that is, a particularly developed sense of olfaction, or let us just say it, a particularly keen sense of smell. While the French verb flairer means quite explicitly to sense, to sniff, to pick up a scent, or as we might say, to follow one's nose, the English word flair retains at least some of the flavor or scent of the French from which it is derived when it suggests a knack, talent, or bent for something, as when we speak of a partic ularly good student having a flair for philosophy, a "keenness" or "instinctive discernment," even a flair or developed sense for it. In this essay I would like to suggest that, in the last decade or so of his life, Derrida demonstrated a particularly keen sense for the animal, for the theme of the animal or of animals in philosophy, and that he followed this theme with an unparallel doggedness in the book that was published after his death, The Animal That Therefore I Am} Derrida demonstrates in this work an extraordinarily developed sense, an extraordinary flair, for following or track ing the ways in which philosophy has traditionally treated the animal, oppos ing the animal—the entire animal world, as we will see, and not just particular animals—to the human by denying the animal and granting the human a series of attributes ranging from language, reason, culture, and tech nology to mourning and a relationship to death, from the capacity to respond or to weep to the ability to lie or to promise, attributes that will then be at the center of the humans definition of himself and, as a result, at the center of his philosophy. I would thus like to follow Derrida here as he follows this argument regarding the animal in The Animal That Therefore 1 Am. I will try to retrace Derrida's footsteps as he reads the traces of the animal in a philosophical tra " L'animal que done je suis (Paris: Editions Galilee, 2006); hereafter abbreviated as AQD; trans lated by David Wills as The Animal That Therefore 1 Am.

Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 221 dition that runs from Plato and Aristotle to Heidegger, Levinas, and Lacan, a trail that Derrida himself could never have known he would end up taking when he set out, but that in retrospect, we can—and, I think, we are now obliged to—follow, both in the book The Animal That Therefore I Am and in the extraordinary corpus and still barely explored archive he has left us on this subject. If I have thus begun by recalling Derrida's relationship to lan guage, and the differences between languages, between the French flairer and the English flair, for example, it is in order to suggest, along with Derrida, that language is never transparent in philosophy and that one is always obliged to follow Derrida's tracks in both English and in French, even when the translation is as intelligent, lucid, rigorous, and inventive as David Wills' translation of The Animal That Therefore I Am. If Derrida follows what might appear to be a rather unorthodox theme for a philosopher, the question of the animal, and particularly of the animal in relation to human beings, it is because this theme is uncritically present, dog matically present, indeed almost omnipresent in philosophy from the very beginning. The thickets and brambles through which Derrida will track down the presence of the animal will thus not be extra-philosophical but, precisely, intra-philosophical, not only contemporaries such as Levinas and Lacan but Heidegger, Schmitt, Rousseau, Hobbes, Machiavelli, Descartes, Montaigne, Aristotle and, from the very beginning therefore, Plato. Derrida thus did not invent this theme or this trope for philosophy or go poaching animals out side philosophy in order to smuggle them in over its border. Though the ani mal appears oftentimes at the most uncritical moments of these philosophical texts, and often without theoretical justification, it—they—populate(s) phi losophy from its very inception. One need only recall, for example, the enor mous bestiary deployed by Plato to characterize Socrates alone, who is compared more or less explicitly in the dialogues not only to a midwife, shep herd, captain, doctor, or philosopher king, but to everything from a gadfly, stingray, bee, and snake to a goose, swan, stork, even a blood hound, as we see in the Parmenides, where Zeno says with obvious humor but also approval and admiration that Socrates follows the "argument with a scent as keen as a Laconian hound's" (Parmenides 128c), proof that Derrida was in good com pany in having a certain flair for philosophy. Or, again, one need only recall within the Republic the way in which the guardians are compared to watch dogs, the desiring part of the soul to a multi-headed beast, and the tyrant to a wolf—this latter example being at the center of Derrida's penultimate semi nar of 2001-2002, The Beast and the Sovereign. And then there would be Plato's pervasive use not only of the animal in his work but of the trope of</page><page sequence="4">222 Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 rhe hunt for the very work of philosophy or dialectic, not only, as we just saw, the necessity of having a certain flair for argument and dialectic but, in later dialogues such as Phaedrus, Statesman, and Sophist, the necessity prescribed by that method called diairesis or division of dividing concepts along their natural joints, as if the conceptual world or landscape were an enormous sac rificial beast that had to be divided or carved up along its natural articula tions.2 It thus does not take too much digging or sniffing around to come to see that Derrida may not be overstating his case when he argues in The Ani mal That Therefore I Am that philosophy's incorporation of the animal within itself, and the singular line it draws and redraws between the human and all other animals, is a "gesture" that seems "to constitute philosophy as such, the philosopheme itself" (ATT40). It is this dogmatic and for the most part uncritical and unjustified division between the human animal and all other animals that Derrida draws our attention to and takes aim at in The Animal That Therefore I Am. First pub lished in French in 2006 and then in English translation in 2008, this post humous work is the complete version of a long lecture Derrida delivered in July 1997 at a ten-day conference devoted to his work at Cerisy-la-Salle in Normandy, France.3 The general title for the Cerisy conference, chosen by See, for example, Sophist 218c and 287c, or Phaedrus 265d-e. Of course, for Derrida there are no such "natura] joints" between concepts, no place outside language and thought from which the conceptual "animal" might be surveyed from above and cut up by simply following the natural differences it offers to our sight. " The full publication history of this work is rather complex. Of Derrida's long ten-hour lec ture at Cerisy, two sections or chapters were published separately before being published together in The Animal That Therefore I Am. The first of these two chapters, "L'animal que done je suis," was first published in French in the conference proceedings of Cerisy, LAnimal autobi ographique: Autour de Jacques Derrida, ed. Marie-Louise Mallet (Paris: Editions Galilee, 1999), 251-301; these pages correspond to AQD 15-77. It was then published in English as "The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow)," trans. David Wills, Critical Inquiry 28, no. 2 (2002): 369-418; these pages correspond to ATT 1-51. The second of the two chapters was published first in English as "And Say the Animal Responded," trans. David Wills, in Zoontolo gies: the Question of the Animal, ed. Cary Wolfe (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2003), 121-146; this material corresponds to ATT 119-140, as well as to several pages in Der rida's The Beast and the Sovereign I, The Seminars of Jacques Derrida, trans. Geoffrey Bennington (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009); it was then published in French as "Et si l'animal repondait?', in Cahier de l'Herne, no. 83, Jacques Derrida, ed. Marie-Louise Mallet and Ginette Michaud (Paris: L'Herne, 2004), 117-129; this material corresponds to AQD 163-191, as well as to La bete et le souverain, Volume I (2001-2002) (Paris: Editions Galilee, 2008), 158-187; hereafter abbreviated as BeS. These two chapters were then published as part of the book The Animal That Therefore I Am, which includes all the other previously unpublished sections of</page><page sequence="5">Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 223 Derrida himself, was "The Autobiographical Animal," and as if to sign this conference with his own autobiographical flourish, the paper Derrida deliv ered as part of that conference was read on 15 July 1997, that is, on his sixty seventh birthday, and it lasted an almost inhuman ten-plus hours.41 recall all this as background for reading a work that was presented at a conference that was not just any conference for Derrida and on a theme that was not just any theme for him. Indeed in the four Cerisy conferences devoted to his work, Derrida took pains, it seems, to begin by reading himself on a theme that had been present, if not always explicitly emphasized, in his previous work, before then going on to draw these earlier references and attempts into a more explicit, systematic, and sustained account.5 Hence Derrida demonstrates in some of the earlier pages of The Animal That Therefore I Am that he had in effect been tracking the philosophical treatment of animals—as well as, I should add, the very notion or quasi concept of flair—from almost the very beginning of his work.6 One might be tempted to think in these early pages that the author doth protest and self-justify too much were the list of texts Derrida's 1997 Cerisy talk as well as a transcription of Derrida's improvised session on Heide gger from later in the conference. As for the title The Animal That Therefore I Am [L'animal que done je suis), it is to be heard as a deformation of Descartes' famous "I think therefore I am" [Je pense done je suis], where the first person singular form suis can be heard as 1) am (from etre), 2) follow or be after (from suivre), or 3) follow or come after (from suivre again). The phrase thus suggests at once the ani mal that therefore I am, the animal I therefore follow, the animal I come after and so follow (seeyirriO). 41 In addition to the formal talk on July 15, 1997, Derrida gave an improvised session later during the conference on Heidegger where he comments at some length on Heidegger's claim in his 1929-1930 seminar that the stone is worldless, the animal poor in world, and the human world-building. This discussion is taken up in much greater detail—as is promised at ATT 141—in Derrida's 2002-2003 seminar La bete et le souverain, Volume II (Paris: Editions Galilee, 2009). 51 Derrida appears to have used the four Cerisy conferences devoted to his work (in 1980, 1992, 1997, and 2002) as occasions to reread himself, to retrace his own steps, to pick up the scent of themes scattered here and there throughout his corpus in order to bring them together and lead them in new directions. Moreover, there appears to be, at least in retrospect, a certain trajectory to the themes of the conferences themselves, the question of the ends of man in 1980, the question of borders in 1992, of the animal in 1997, and the question of sovereignty and democracy, and particularly, the question of the relationship between the beast and the sov ereign in 2002. Derrida writes in 1997 of the first three: "I move from 'the ends of man,' that is, from the confines of man, to 'the crossing of borders' between man and animal. Passing across borders or the ends of man I come to surrender to the animal" (ATT 3). " Derrida writes: "I won't go back over the arguments of a theoretical or philosophical kind, or in what we call a deconstructive style, arguments that for a very long time, since I began writing,</page><page sequence="6">224 Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 treating the animal not so extensive, from earlier works such as "Plato's Phar macy," Signsponge, "White Mythology," Glas, and The Post Card up through "Circumfession," "Fourmis," "Heidegger's Hand," Politics of Friendship, Spec ters of Marx, "A Silkworm of One's Own," and so on and so forth {ATT 35-39). And we can now say in retrospect that Derrida's meditations on the animal and on the relationship between the human and the animal would not end in 1997 but would continue right up to his death in 2004. Indeed these themes became constants in his work, not only in relationship to what is proper to man but also, and especially, in relationship to the theme of sov ereignty, a theme that would become dominant in the final decade of his work. The final two seminars Derrida would give at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003, would thus both bear the title La bete et le souverain [The Beast and the Sovereign], and their upcoming publication in both French and English will demonstrate the in fact, I believe I have dedicated to the question of the living and of the living animal. For me that will always have been the most important and decisive question" (ATT34; my emphasis). As for this notion of flair, Derrida writes in The Animal That Therefore I Am of the way in which he has doubled back on this theme of the animal throughout his work, such that his tra jectory would "resemble the running of an animal that, finding its way on the basis of a scent [au flair] or a noise, goes back more than once over the same path to pick up the traces, either to sniff [flairer] the trace of another or to cover its own by adding to it, precisely as though it were that of another, picking up the scent [flairant], therefore, of whatever on this track dem onstrates to it that the trace is always that of another, demonstrating also that in following the consequence or direction of this double arrow (it is a matter of the scent [ily va du flair], and the scent one smells is always the trace of another), the animal becomes inevitable " (ATT 55). See also A TT 33, 78, 92. But Derrida had attempted from as early as Of Grammatology to rethink the very concept of the trace or the sign in relation not only to humans but animals by means of this trope or concept of flair. Hence Derrida wrote 1967 in Of Grammatology (Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1967), 162: We must begin wherever we are and the thought of the trace, which cannot not take the scent [flair] into account, has already taught us that it was impossible to justify a point of departure absolutely. Wherever we are·, in a text where we already believe ourselves to be. And then much later, in the recently published seminar of 2001-2002, La bete et le souverain, this theme of the flair returns with some frequency. For example: "If God is the model of sover eignty, saying God like the beast puts us again on the same track, sniffing out [flairer] every thing that might attract the one to the other" (5i581-82). Derrida had thus long been tracking this theme of the animal, and he had been doing so while tracking and using one of the tropes of the animal, namely, scent, flair, as opposed to, or in addition to, the sight of theoria—even though, as Derrida often reminds us, theoria means not only vision but procession (see ATT39).</page><page sequence="7">Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 225 extent to which this theme of the animal continued to exercise Derrida and animate his work. We will thus want to keep in mind that this work on the animal was hardly the first in Derridas corpus and that it would develop into a long meditation on the proximity between the beast and the sovereign, both of whom are either above or outside the law, who either see without being seen, with a sovereign gaze that makes the law insofar as it is above the law, or who see and are seen seeing from a place that is outside or before the law—from what might be called "a wholly other origin" if not another origin of the world (.ATT 13). It is thus surely no accident that The Animal That Therefore I Am opens with a scene of seeing or of gazing, the unexpected and somewhat uncanny scene of Derrida describing the experience of suddenly finding himself being looked at naked by his cat. For many, this would be one of those moments when Derrida might rightly be accused of making a show of his flair, begin ning a philosophical work with an autobiographical description of an experi ence that could not be more banal, the experience of coming out of the shower and being looked at naked by his household cat. But Derrida could not be more serious in this opening scene, this scene of a sort of alternative Genesis that will recount the genesis of his work on animals, as the gaze of the other, in this case the animal other, is thought in relationship to the gen esis of shame or modesty as well as the culture and technics of clothing. What happens, Derrida asks, when a philosopher lets himself be gazed at naked by a cat and then tries to think this experience philosophically? This scene of a human being first looked at, rather than looking, an object for the gaze of another, rather than a subject whose gaze seeks to see and to know the object before it, sets the stage for the rest of the book and accounts for many of its methodological reversals. In The Animal That Therefore I Am it is the animal that is first seen seeing and the human that is first seen seen—a simple rever sal that is enough, claims Derrida, to reorient an entire philosophical tradi tion of thinking the animal other. Hence Derrida treats the question of the animal and of the flair of the ani mal in philosophy, but he does so by rethinking philosophical argument and method in terms of that flair. By comparing his own way of proceeding in The Animal That Therefore I Am to that of an animal sniffing its way along, picking up a scent and following it wherever it leads, returning to its own tracks from time to time to pick up the trace or scent of an other, even when that other is oneself, Derrida puts the very question of flair and its relative exclusion from philosophical interest at the center of his own work: "To put it differently, one would have to ask oneself first of all what there is about</page><page sequence="8">226 Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 scent [flair] and smell in man's relation to the animot—and why this zone of sensibility is so neglected or reduced to a secondary position in philosophy and in the arts" (ATT 55). In the opening scene of The Animal That Therefore I Am, it is the cat who looks and gazes and Derrida who is seen, Derrida who scratches and sniffs—who uses his flair—to find his way through a philo sophical tradition that attempts to understand and speak of the difference between the human and the animal. The original French title of the book, L'animal que done je suis, thus means not only "the animal that therefore 1 am [suis]" but "the animal that therefore I follow [suis]," or, as in Genesis, "the animal that therefore 1, the human, come after [suis]," the animal 1 follow, therefore, but also the animal over which 1, as man, according to Genesis, have dominion and to which I, as man, will assign names. While we have all probably had some version of this experience of being seen naked by an animal, seen and exposed, genitals and all, and while we have all probably felt the confused embarrassment that accompanies such an experience, the task for Derrida the philosopher is to think the experience of this gaze philosophically—something he says in a rather bold claim has never really been done in the history of philosophy, since it would call into ques tion our very assurance of a singular and indivisible limit distinguishing the human from the animal. Listen to how Derrida couches this claim in the form of a challenge: At the risk of being mistaken and of having one day to make honorable amends (which I would willingly accept to do), I'll venture to say that never, on the part of any great phi losopher from Plato to Heidegger, or anyone at all who takes on, as a philosophical question in and of itself, the question called that of the animal and of the limit between the animal and the human, have I noticed a protestation based on principle, and especially not a protestation that amounts to anything, against the general singular that is the animal. (ATT 40)7 71 One might want to juxtapose and try to think together this rather large claim with another equally large one, similar in form, from just a few years later on a seemingly disconnected sub ject. In Rogues, trans. Pascale-Anne Brault and Michael Naas (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2005) [ Voyous (Paris: Editions Galilee, 2003)], a work written in 2002 and first published in 2003, Derrida writes, "we would do well to recall that there are in the end rather few philo sophical discourses, assuming there are any at all, in the long tradition that runs from Plato to Heidegger, that have without any reservations taken the side of democracy. In this sense democratism in philosophy is something rather rare and, in the end, very modern. And perhaps not even very philosophical'' (Rogues 41).</page><page sequence="9">Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 ΤΣ1 This is, to be sure, a rather strong claim and a sweeping challenge. Derrida seems to leave himself some wiggle room, however, by suggesting that while certain philosophers might well have called the singular limit between the animal and the human into question, they would not have done so as philoso phers but rather as poets, thinkers, or writers—anything but philosophers. This is not some historical contingency, therefore, but a necessity that stems from the very nature of philosophy itself. When it comes to the line or limit between the animal and the human, "all philosophers," Derrida writes and emphasizes, "have judged that limit to be single and indivisible"; it is, as we saw, a gesture that "constitutes philosophy as such" (ATT40). There would thus seem to be, according to Derrida, two types of thinkers about animals. First, there would be (and I put this in the conditional because, as we shall see, there has perhaps never been such a thinker) those who have never been seen or never saw themselves being seen, as Derrida was seen, by an animal gaze. Such thinkers would have thus never taken account of this gaze theoretically or philosophically, because they would have never experienced themselves being seen from what Derrida calls "a wholly other origin" (ATT 13). This phrase "a wholly other origin" at once anticipates the argument to come and recalls Derrida's early analyses in Speech and Phenome non and elsewhere of Husserlian intersubjectivity, and particularly of the fifth Cartesian Meditation in which the alter-ego is said by Husserl to be accessible to the subject only by analogical appresentation. The suggestion already seems to be that the gaze of the animal recalls this other origin as much as, if not more than, the gaze of the other human being—a wholly other who would not be so easily accessible or understood even as an alter-ego or else, shifting registers, as a brother or member of the same community. This "wholly other origin," this origin that is at least as other as any other, might thus be even more appropriate for rethinking a certain humanistic and frater nalistic thought of community, even more appropriate for thinking not only the animal other but the human one (see ATT 12). The second type of thinker of the animal consists of those "who admit to taking upon themselves the address that an animal addresses to them" but who do so as poets rather than as philosophers, since "thinking concerning the animal, if there is such a thing, derives from poetry" (ATT 14, 7). In other words, it is essentially in poetry or as poets that people have addressed animals and allowed themselves to be addressed by them. It is thus perhaps no coincidence that the texts of Derrida where the animal is most prominent are among his most poetic and that in the one text where Derrida tries to address the very essence of poetry—"Che cose la poesia?\ "What is poetry?"—an</page><page sequence="10">228 Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 animal, the hedgehog, stands at its center, or rather, is rolled up in a ball at its center {ATT7). It is also then surely no coincidence that, in both The Ani mal That Therefore I Am and The Beast and the Sovereign, poets and poetry are brought into the discussion more than they usually are in Derrida's work, from the fables of La Fontaine to the works of Paul Celan, D. H. Lawrence, and Lewis Carroll. Derrida thus approaches the question of the relationship between the human and the animal by using poetry and sometimes by being inventive like a poet, but he does this always by questioning and arguing as a philoso pher, since it is only as a philosopher that he will be able to put into question a whole series of philosophical claims or principles on the basis of which the singular limit between the human and the animal is typically drawn. In order, therefore, to intervene in the philosophical tradition and within its philoso phemes, and in order to mark the fact that no philosopher qua philosopher has ever protested "the general singular that is the animal" that is, that no philosopher has protested against grouping together everything from the worm to the chimpanzee, the lizard to the dog, the protozoon to the ele phant, under this general singular name animal, Derrida invents a word of his own—in French, the word animot. Marie-Louise Mallet, the editor of The Animal That Therefore I Am, writes in her preface to the book: As a response to that first violence Derrida invents the word animot, which, when spoken, has the plural animaux, heard within the singular, recalling the extreme diversity of ani mals that "the animal" erases, and which, when written, makes it plain that this word [mot] "the animal" is precisely only a word. (ATTx) It is thus in response to the violence with which philosophers have grouped all these different kinds of creatures or critters under this label "the animal" that Derrida invents a word that draws attention to the fact that "the animal" is not some natural category that has been simply picked out by human per ception and language but is, precisely, an age-old neologism and an invention of man. This neologism is thus not some play on words designed to display Derrida's linguistic inventivity and flair. The word animot is invented or cre ated to remind us that the French animal—and the same would hold for the English animal—is, precisely, as a word, not natural, not simply the result of following some natural articulation between humans and all the other, incredibly diverse creatures in the world. Derrida writes, "The animal is a word, it is an appellation that men have instituted, a name they have given themselves the right and the authority to give to the living other" (ATT 23).</page><page sequence="11">Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 229 Notice, then, that like that other invented word of the 1960s, differance, the difference between the two valences of the word can only be read but not heard, tracked through the written sign while effaced in the spoken one. And while the word differance is itself both the name of and the effect of differance, the word animot both names the plurality of animals and draws attention to the process of naming of which it is an effect. Hence the word animot is a name that describes and a word that performs what it describes, and unlike animal, it makes absolutely no pretension of being natural or being a unity. It wears its status as a hybrid right on its surface, on its letters. Fashioned out of two different words, the plural of animal and the word for word, mot, it is not unlike those composite animals found in mythology that philosophers are so fond of invoking or inventing in their meditations or thought experi ments. It is itself, then, like a centaur, satyr, or chimera of language—an invention of man with regard to the animal.8 But even before introducing this invented word and this thesis regarding the history of philosophy, Derrida begins The Animal That Therefore I Am, as I recalled earlier, with a sort of Edenic or primal scene, a scene of genesis, indeed a scene of the genesis of his thinking about the animal: the experience of being looked at naked by his cat, being looked at and feeling modesty or shame beneath the gaze of his cat, shame even for feeling shame.9 This very experience of being seen naked leads, Derrida suggests, to thinking itself and, as we will see, to philosophy. Derrida writes: "The animal looks at us, and we are naked before it. Thinking perhaps begins there" {ATT 29). The question will be, in the end, whether this gaze of the animal, this interrogation of the human by the animal, or rather, by this one absolutely unique animal other, is repressed or denied—a gesture that is co-extensive, Derrida seems to sug gest, with the entire history of philosophy—or whether it is what provokes a new thinking of the animal, of the animal in relationship to the human, and of a differential relationship between animals themselves. By broaching the question of the animal not by means of "the animal" in its generality, the ani mal as a concept, and not even by means of a particular species of animals but by means of a very real and individual animal—Derrida's household cat, *' On the word animot as a chimera, see ATT41, 47-48. " On the theme of being shamed or embarrassed before the animal gaze, see ATT 3-5, 11. Derrida writes of this absolute origin in the other: "It has its point of view regarding me. The point of view of the absolute other, and nothing will have ever given me more food for think ing through this absolute alterity of the neighbor or of the next(-door) than these moments when I see myself naked under the gaze of a cat" (ATT 11).</page><page sequence="12">230 Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 an absolutely singular, unique cat that will have one day surprised him naked with its gaze—Derrida quite literally reorients our philosophical gaze with regard to this question. By opening The Animal That Therefore I Am with this primal or Edenic scene, Derrida is able to begin to put into question a series of attributes that are typically thought to be proper to man. He writes, "It is thought that nudity is proper to man, an awareness of nudity, that which, in effect, trans forms an absence of clothes into a veritable nudity" (ATT4). Because animals are thought to be born naked but without being conscious of their naked ness, they are not really naked at all. The human would be the only animal born naked because the only one with an awareness of its nakedness, the only one who feels shame for its nudity, and thus the only one who invents the supplement of clothing in order to hide that nakedness. As Plato's Protagoras already speculated, both nakedness and clothing would be proper to man (see Protagoras 320c-328d). Nakedness, clothing, shame—this is just the beginning of a very long and open-ended list of attributes that are regularly granted to man and denied the animal, a list that includes everything from speech, reason, logos, history, laughter, imitation, lying, feigning to feign, a relation to death as such, mourning, tears, burying one's dead, gift giving, technology, promising, the trace, and so on. For Derrida this list of what is considered "proper to man" is not a mere aggregation of attributes or capacities but, precisely, a "configu ration." "For that very reason," he writes, "it can never be limited to a single trait and it is never closed" (ATT 5). We will thus need to think how, in a given discourse, the animal's supposed inability to respond is related, for example, to its inability to laugh or to cry, or how a technology of clothing that is attributed to man and man alone is related to shame, or how a sup posed relationship to death and the animal's lack thereof defines mans and the animal's respective relationships to the world. How, then, does Derrida approach this configuration in order to begin to interrogate and destabilize it? Let me begin by citing a rather lengthy passage from The Animal That Therefore I Am where Derrida lays out not only many of the themes of the book but, more importantly, the argumentative strategy he adopts in his analysis of them. Speaking here in the context of a reading of Lacan but expressing, it would seem, the approach he takes in the entire work, Derrida writes: It is not just a matter of asking whether one has the right to refuse the animal such and such a power (speech, reason, experience of death, mourning, culture, institutions, tech</page><page sequence="13">Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 231 nies, clothing, lying, pretense of pretense, covering of tracks, gift, laugher, crying, respect, etc.—the list is necessarily without limit, and the most powerful philosophical tradition in which we live has refused the "animal" all ofthat). It also means asking whether what calls itself human has the right rigorously to attribute to man, which means therefore to attri bute to himself, what he refuses the animal, and whether he can ever possess the pure, rig orous, indivisible concept, as such, of that attribution. (ATT 135) Derrida articulates quite clearly here his strategy and point of entry into the question of the relationship between humans and the animal or animals. He begins by looking at a philosophical discourse that grants man and denies the animal some attribute—language, technology, culture, mourning, a relation ship to death, and so on. His next move is then to contest, briefly and some times with reference to ethology, primatology, or zoology the supposed fact that the animal does not have such and such an ability or attribute. He argues that philosophers must begin to take seriously the progress that has been made in ethology or primatology with regard to these questions, since some of the most rigorous and thoughtful work in these areas would suggest that animals perhaps do respond and not just react, or do mourn, or have a cul ture, and so on (see ATT89). Moreover, because such work rarely claims that "the animal" as such has or does not have a particular attribute but that, for example, the elephant mourns or the pigeon can respond, taking such work seriously within philosophy would have the effect of breaking up and multi plying the differences within that monolithic category called "the animal." But because Derrida is a philosopher and not a primatologist or ethologist, he does not want to rely too much on this kind of evidence or get himself into a debate in a field where he is hardly an expert and where the standards of argument and evidence are obviously much different from those of philos ophy. Hence Derrida typically moves very quickly to the other side of the question in order to contest not the fact that animals do not have such and such a capacity or attribute but the principle by which philosophers have claimed that humans do. He does this first by questioning the confidence with which philosophers attribute some capacity to the human while denying it to the animal. As he puts it, invoking once again that notion of flair, he tries "to track, to sniff \flairer\, to trail, and to follow some of the reasons they [that is, philosophers] adduce for the so confident usage they make... of words such as, therefore, animal and Γ (ATT 33). Derrida thus contests less the fact that animals do not have some ability than the principle on the basis of which phi losophers claim that humans do, since it is typically on the basis of such a principle that philosophers at once attempt to distinguish in dogmatic fash ion animals from the human and systematically attempt to efface the animal</page><page sequence="14">232 Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219—242 in man. '"The critical or deconstructive reading" that Derrida calls for and tries to carry out would thus "seek less to restitute to the animal or to such an insect the powers that it is not certain to possess (even if that sometimes seems possible) than to wonder whether one could not claim as much rele vance for this type of analysis in the case of the human" {ATT 173 n9). Hence Derrida will question, for example, the fact that certain animals can not respond but only react, but he will quickly move on to question the prin ciple behind the philosophical claim that humans possess a language rather than a mere code, the claim that they are able to give a spontaneous and meaningful response as opposed to a mere mechanical reaction, that they are capable of erasing their own traces or that they have a relationship to death as such.]° It is this second move that allows Derrida then to question whether there is anything like a response as such, a response that would remain pure and uncontaminated by reaction, or whether the human has a relation to death in the full sense of the term. This double questioning of both fact and principle forms what Derrida calls the "logical matrix" of his argument, and it leads to unsettling the assur ance and confidence with which theorists draw the line between the human and the animal (ATT95). Derrida thus writes, questioning the concepts of purity, rigor, and indivisibility that he had questioned in innumerable other contexts, in relationship now to the line between humans and animals: My hesitation concerns only the purity, the rigor, and the indivisibility of the frontier that separates—already with respect to "us humans"—reaction from response and in conse quence, especially, the purity, rigor, and indivisibility of the concept of responsibility that is derived from it. (ATT 125) Derrida articulates and repeats this strategy throughout both The Animal That Therefore I Am and the two seminars of 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 that were given under the title The Beast and the SovereignIt tells us much, I think, "" When, for example, AJice in Alice in Wonderland seems to conclude that an animal cannot reply, that it might seem to reply but never really does, Derrida questions less this explicit claim regarding the animal than Alice's implicit assumption that we humans can respond and can determine what a human really means when he or she responds. "[Alice] seems, at this moment at least, to believe that one can in fact discern and decide between a human yes and no" (ATT9). But, Derrida asks, can one really decide in all rigor when a human is saying^« or no? See ATT 95 where Derrida particulates this strategy with regard to the capacity of the human to refer to itself by means of an autoaffection that would exclude all heteroaffection, or ATT 160 where this strategy is deployed with regard the human's access to the "as such." On this theme of autoaffection in both the animal and the human, see ATT 50, 65, 72, 83, 94-95.</page><page sequence="15">Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 233 about Derrida's approach to questions elsewhere and about some of the long held methodological motivations behind deconstruction. As Derrida puts it near the opening of The Animal That Therefore I Am, "I have thus never believed in some homogeneous continuity between what calls itself man and what he calls the animal. I am not about to begin to do so now. That would be worse than sleepwalking, it would simply be too asinine [bete]" (ATT30). Derrida's strategy thus consists not in effacing or erasing the limit between the animal and the human but, rather, in "problematizing the purity and indivis ibility of a line between [for example,] reaction and response" (/17T126), "in multiplying its figures, in complicating, thickening, delinearizing, folding, and dividing the line precisely by making it increase and multiply" (ATT29). Derrida's method is thus to multiply differences and distinctions between various animals, between animals and humans, and then within the human itself (see ATT 159). To break up the monolithic category "animal," one could ask, for example, not simply whether animals have language or culture or whether they can lie or erase their own traces but which animals couple, which dream or have a mirror stage, or indeed, which have a gaze before which I can feel myself to be naked and so feel shame (see ATT 62-63). Instead of simply asking whether the animal can respond and not just react, one can begin to distin guish different forms of reaction, different kinds of self-relation or autoaffec tion. When these kinds of distinctions are made, one can begin to see that the human animal shares certain qualities with some animals rather than oth ers, and shares them to a greater degree with some rather than others. Rather than a single line distinguishing the human from the animal, multiple lines are thus drawn and differences of degree take the place of opposition, differ ences between animals and the human but also differences among animals and among humans. Derrida can thus at once affirm that there is indeed "something like a discontinuity, rupture, or even abyss" between the human and the animal and yet also claim that when it comes to possessing language or having a relationship to death it is less a question of opposition than of difference (ATT30). Again, it is less the supposed fact of the animal not possessing some ability that Derrida contests but the confidence with which a line is drawn in prin ciple and often with little regard to the facts between the human and the ani mal. This confidence, as we will see in a moment, has its own hidden origins, but for the moment it is important to underscore the way in which Derrida's questions with regard to the principles by which philosophers have distin guished the animal from the human often end up putting into question the</page><page sequence="16">234 Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219—242 entire ontological, epistemological, or ethical program of those philosophers.12 For example, Levinas' apparent restriction of the category of the other to the human has repercussions for his entire ethical theory. By questioning Levi nas's "profound anthropocentrism and humanism" and by posing the possi bility of thinking the animal other or the animal as other, the possibility, in short, of thinking the animal with a face, or the animal as being able to respond and say "Here I am," Derrida challenges not only Levinas' views regarding the animal but the assumptions upon which his notions of alterity, exteriority, community, and fraternity rest. The philosophical stakes and consequences of such questions could thus not be larger. As Elisabeth de Fontenay puts it in her excellent analysis of The Animal That Therefore I Am in Sans offenser le genre humain, the animal is a kind of "Trojan horse" that Derrida introduces into the citadel of metaphys ics itself in order to question, if not overthrow, its philosophical oppositions." By questioning the purity and rigor of the line between reaction and response, by introducing "a nonoppositional and infinitely differentiated, qualitative, and intensive difference between reaction and response," one ends up having to rethink the very basis of ethics, decision, and responsibility {ATT 126). By no longer drawing a single line between human response, on the one hand, and animal reaction, on the other, one is forced to develop "another 'logic' of decision, of the response and of the event," a logic that would cause us to rethink the "historicity of ethical, juridical, or political responsibility, within another thinking of life" {ATT 126). Derrida's analysis of the way philosophers have granted or denied certain capacities to animals or to humans thus leads to an even more far-reaching thesis regarding the history of philosophy itself. He writes: This question of the animal is not just interesting and serious in its own right. It also pro vides us with an indispensable intertwining thread for reading philosophers and for gain ing access to a sort of secret "architectonics" in the construction—and therefore in the This is precisely the itinerary Derrida will follow in his seminar The Beast and the Sovereign, Volume II, where he questions Heidegger's claim and confidence that animals do not have access to the as such of beings. Once again Derrida begins by questioning Heidegger's too rapid dis missal of scientific discourses on the animal, even though Heidegger is, Derrida admits, much more sympathetic than most philosophers to such studies. But what Derrida is then most intent on questioning is, again, the "confidence" with which Heidegger is able to attribute this ability to man. 1,1 Elisabeth de Fontenay, Sans offenser le genre humain: Reflexions sur la cause animale (Paris: Editions Albin Michel, 2008), 19.</page><page sequence="17">Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 235 deconstruction—of a discursive apparatus, a coherence, if not a system. One understands a philosopher only by heeding closely what he means to demonstrate, and in reality fails to demonstrate, concerning the limit between human and animal. (ATT 106) A "secret architectonics... a discursive apparatus, a coherence, if not a sys tem": Derrida is suggesting that the question of the animal is not just an important, but ultimately contingent, aspect of this history of philosophy but a central and essential element of it. This leads to a new take or twist on an old theme: ever since the 1960s Derrida tracked what he called "logocen trism," that is, a privileging in Western philosophy of language or of logos, and depending on the context, of its relationship to phonocentrism, a privi leging of speech over writing, or else to Eurocentrism, phallocentrism, or even carnophallogocentrism, a neologism that begins to look a little less odd when we begin to think this privileging of logos in relationship to the con sumption and sacrifice of animals.14 What Derrida referred to as a secret architectonics or coherence is thus another aspect of this same logocentrism, that is, of the discursive apparatus that grants logos (speech, the symbolic, response versus reaction) to the human and not the animal. Derrida can thus argue that "logocentrism is first of all a thesis regarding the animal, the ani mal deprived of the logos, deprived of the can-have-the-logos: this is the thesis, position, or presupposition maintained from Aristotle to Heidegger, from Descartes to Kant, Levinas, and Lacan" {ATT 27).15 It is, in short, "an abso lutely structuring operation throughout philosophy" (ATT 156). The six figures listed above are those Derrida treats in detail in The Animal That Therefore I Am. They are the privileged figures in the corpus that Derrida carves out within the history of philosophy or, rather, within what might be called a dominant line or lineage within that history. For there is, Derrida points out, another less prominent or dominant tradition, what might be called a counter-tradition within philosophy, that also needs to be recalled and revived. Derrida will evoke, for example, Porphyry's "inexhaustible sur vey of the ethics of vegetarianism in Antiquity" (ATT 84-85) and, especially, Montaigne's "Apology for Raymond Sebond," "one of the greatest pre- or anti-Cartesian texts on the animal that exists" (ATT6). In this text Montaigne 141 "It was in order to name that sacrificial scene that I spoke elsewhere, as though of a single phenomenon and a single law, of carnopkallogoccntrism" (ATT 104). 1,1 Derrida writes elsewhere in ATT·. "All the philosophers we will investigate (from Aristotle to Lacan, and including Descartes, Kant, Heidegger, and Levinas), all of them say the same thing: the animal is deprived of language. Or, more precisely, of response, of a response that could be precisely and rigorously distinguished from a reaction" (ATT32).</page><page sequence="18">236 Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 questions what we earlier saw to be the focus of Derrick's critique, namely, the "naive assurance of man" on the subject of the animal (.ATT 6). In oppo sition to the dominant tradition before him and the even more dominant Cartesian tradition that would follow him, Montaigne grants the animal not only an ability to communicate but "a capacity to respond" (.ATT 163n8). Finally, Derrida credits Jeremy Bentham with radically transforming the terms of the debate surrounding the animal by asking not whether the ani mal has this or that capacity, this or that power or activity, but whether it has a certain affectivity or vulnerability, an exposure or a passion, that is, whether it—or they—can suffer. This question of Bentham's not only reorients or recalibrates a philosophical tradition bent on drawing a line between humans and animals on the basis of some capacity such as thought, language, or tech nology but allows us to rethink our relationship to the animal in terms of shared categories or experiences such as mortality, finitude, and suffering, and it leads, perhaps, to a new thinking and a new experience of "compassion" based on these shared experiences (see ATT28). Derrida evokes this counter-tradition throughout The Animal That There fore I Am, but he spends much more time with the dominant tradition—the one that runs, as we said, from Aristotle to Descartes, Kant, Levinas, Heide gger, and Lacan—because it is this tradition, Derrida believes, that is most widely reflected in our culture and its attitudes with regard to animals. It is here that Derrida at once widens and narrows the scope and stakes of his analysis in order to argue that what he takes to be a long-standing and quasi pervasive attitude with regard to animals has entered a crucial phase. He does this by overlaying three additional temporal frames, or three additional epochal configurations, onto the history of philosophy that has already been laid out, one frame that encompasses that history of philosophy from Aristo tle to Heidegger or Levinas and two that are situated within it. First, then, there is the much larger historical frame that encompasses much of the culture and thought of the West and Middle East, though no claims are made, it should be noted—for Derrida does draw limits even here—about the Far East. Because The Animal That Therefore I Am draws not only from the history of Western philosophy but also from Greek mythology and the Bible—Genesis in particular, as we have seen—Derrida speaks of a certain sacrificial logic that would be common to both the Greek and Biblical traditions.16 Though Derrida will tend to concentrate his analyses, as we will The theme of sacrifice runs throughout ATT, from its Greek and Biblical origins to Kant, for whom the animal can never be an end in itself but only a means to an end and so, lacking the dignity or Würde of an end in itself, can be sacrificed (ATT 100; see A TT 91-92).</page><page sequence="19">Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 237 see in a moment, on a certain Cartesian tradition with regard to the animal, this Cartesianism is at once a profound mutation within Western philosophy and religion and a continuation and confirmation of that tradition. Hence Derrida will claim that "Cartesianism belongs, beneath its mechanistic indif ference, to the Judeo-Christiano-Islamic tradition of a war against the animal, of a sacrificial war that is as old as Genesis" (ATT 101). The hyphens inserted between the three segments of this deca-syllabic adjective are there to dem onstrate that beyond the differences there is a common tradition with regard to the animal, indeed, as he puts it elsewhere, adding a new segment to the beast, a common "Greco-Judeo-Christiano-Islamic tradition" {ATT55) that would be "both Promethean and Adamic" (ATT21).17 In addition, therefore, to highlighting a philosophical tradition that privileges the human over the animal, Derrida links the story of man's dominion over animals in Genesis to God's preference for the offering of Abel, the herdsman, to that of Cain, the farmer, and to the Decalogue's silence on the question of the killing of ani mals. Hence Derrida speaks of an "anthropocentric prejudice that comes down from Descartes," but comes down—and this would be the longest and most hyperbolic iteration of the bunch—"along the whole Epipromethean Islamic-Judeo-Christian descendancy" (ATT 102). Surrounding and situating, then, the history of philosophy from Aristotle to Heidegger is this much larger historical and cultural frame. From the point of view of the human's relationship to and sacrifice of the animal, there is a common tradition that includes mythology, philosophy, and all three West ern monotheisms or Abrahamic religions. The second historical frame within the history of philosophy begins, as I suggested a moment ago, with Des cartes. Though he puts the word in quotation marks, Derrida will nonethe less speak of a certain "epoch" that runs "from Descartes to the present" (ATT 13). Diagnosing "a certain mutation between Montaigne and Descartes" (ATT 6), a transformation in the way we think of the animal or, indeed, of the "animal-machine," Derrida argues that this mutation is reflected in phi losophy from Kant right on up to Heidegger, Levinas, and Lacan. Hence even those discourses that developed an explicit critique of the Cartesian cog ito, discourses that might seem to be "the least Cartesian, the most heteroge neous vis-ä-vis the mechanicism of the animal-machine, nevertheless belong to the filiation of the Cartesian cogito" (ATT 54). Derrida demonstrates in what are some of the most detailed analyses of the book that all of these 171 Derrida writes again: "That would be the law of an imperturbable logic, both Promethean and Adamic, both Greek and Abrahamic (Judaic, Christian, and Islamic). Its invariance hasn't stopped being verified all the way to our modernity" (ATT2\).</page><page sequence="20">238 Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 figures share the belief, or what might be called the axiom, the prejudice, the presumption, or the presupposition that, for example, the animal can react but cannot respond (ATT 89). '"The Cartesian animal, like its descendants (once again I'll try to recognize there Kant, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas, which also means so many others), would remain incapable of responding to true questioning" (Λ7Τ84). In the chapter entitled "And Say the Animal Responded," Derrida follows Lacan's claims regarding the capacity for language in humans and animals, and he concludes that Lacan too follows in the "Cartesian tradition of the animal-machine without language and without response" (.ATT 119). Unable to pretend to pretend, unable to erase its traces, the animal cannot be a sub ject, that is, a "subject of the signifier," and so cannot have "access to the sym bolic, that is to say, to the law and to whatever is held to be proper to the human" (ATT 120). In conformity with this Cartesian tradition, in what Derrida calls "the most dogmatically traditional manner," the animal would be capable of reacting to stimuli but unable to respond to questions (ATT 122); it would be able to emit and follow the signs of a code but incapable of having language (ATT 123). The animal would thus have "neither uncon scious nor language, nor the other" (ATT\2\), says Derrida. But, again, the real bite of Derrida's analysis resides not in this contestation of Lacan's claim that the animal does not have these things but in his ques tioning of Lacan's confidence that humans do. For the very same "logic of the unconscious... founded on a logic of repetition," that is, on a logic of repeti tion that would seem to have much more in common with reaction than response, would seem to raise serious questions about whether the human really does have a language that can be rigorously distinguished from a code, or whether the human really can spontaneously respond in a way that excludes all reaction, or, indeed, whether the human really can be distin guished on the basis of language from either the animal or the machine (ATT 125). Other questions would then have to be raised regarding the limits of human freedom and the nature of decision and responsibility, questions that any psychoanalysis worthy of the name would have to confront before draw ing the line with such confidence between the human and the animal. What is said here about Lacan will be repeated, in essence, in Derrida's long analysis of Levinas. Despite Levinas' radical rethinking of Cartesian sub jectivity on the basis of an idea of infinity that precedes, constitutes, and calls that subjectivity into question, despite a notion of the face that in its naked ness would seem to disrupt all anthropomorphism, it appears that the animal does not have a face, and so cannot be thought in terms of this idea of infinity.</page><page sequence="21">Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 239 Despite Levinas' radical critique of the subject on the basis of alterity, "this subject of ethics, the face, remains first of all a fraternal and human face," while the animal is put "outside of the ethical circuit" (ATT 106). Derrida thus concludes, "in the tradition that we are tracking here, the animal, according to Levinas, seems deprived of all possibility, in fact, of all power of saying 'Here I am' and of responding, hence of all responsibility" (ATT 111). Thinkers as dissimilar as Descartes, Kant, Heidegger, Levinas, and Lacan thus all belong, argues Derrida, to a single configuration with regard to the ques tion of the animal, forming, as it were, "a single living body" or "a single dis cursive organization with several tentacles" (Λ7Τ91).18 In addition to the temporal frame that embraces the "Greco-Judeo-Chris tiano-Islamic tradition" (ATT 55) and the one within the history of Western philosophy that runs from Descartes to the present, Derrida also argues throughout The Animal That Therefore I Am that an even more dramatic shift or mutation has taken place since about the nineteenth century and that a new "epoch" with regard to the animal must be acknowledged and analyzed. Derrida's hypothesis is that for about two centuries, intensely and by means of an alarming rate of acceleration... we who call ourselves men or humans, we who recognize ourselves in that name, have been involved in an unprecedented transformation. This mutation affects the experience of what we continue to call imperturbably, as if there were nothing to it, the animal and/or animals. (ATT24) Hence Derrida at once points back to "the animal sacrifices of the Bible or of ancient Greece," to millennial traditions of hunting, domesticating, and exploiting animals, and claims that "in the course of the last two centuries these traditional forms of treatment of the animal have been turned upside down by the joint developments of zoological, ethological, biological, and genetic forms of knowledgeby means of everything from farming on a demographic scale that could not even be dreamed of in the past, to genetic experimentation and artificial insemination, to "the industrialization of what can be called the production for consumption of animal meat," and all of this, says Derrida, "in the service of a certain being and putative human "I) Derrida identifies other common traits among them. None of them, he writes, "evoke the possibility of being looked at by the animal that they, for their part, observe," none of them "evoke or take into account the problem of nakedness or modesty operating between animal and human," none of them "think to distinguish animals from one another," and so all of them "speak of the animal' as of a single set that can be opposed to 'us,' 'humans'" (ATT 90).</page><page sequence="22">240 Μ. Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219—242 well-being of man" (ATT25). Derrick thus wants to think together in a sin gle configuration mankinds unprecedented technological progress over the past couple of centuries and the violence with which he has treated animals during this same period.19 But then there is the claim that because such vio lence has become so extreme, because the human subjection of animals has reached such "unprecedented proportions" (ATT 25), it is today reaching a critical phase—so critical, in fact, that it is becoming more and more difficult to deny or repress it. If, as Derrida argues, the dominant tradition of philosophy consists of those who have not taken philosophical or theoretical account of the gaze of the animal, of being looked at by the animal, that is not—despite the appearances—because these philosophers have never experienced the gaze of an animal. All these philosophers, Derrida believes, will have in fact experi enced such a gaze, but none will have taken it "into account in the philo sophical or theoretical architecture of their discourse," that is, none will have taken it into account in principle (.ATT 14). While it may appear "as if the men representing this configuration had seen without being seen, seen the animal without being seen by it," Derrida argues that we must look for another cause and so develop another symptomology (Λ7Τ 14; my emphasis of as if). Even the philosophical tendency to group all kinds of animals from the protozoon to the elephant under the general singular name "the animal" has to be considered not just simply mistaken but "symptomatic" (ATT 41). What Derrida thus diagnoses here is not negligence, ignorance, or lack of experience but a systematic disavowal or denegation whose symptoms can and must be deciphered and analyzed. In other words, the effects of this animal gaze will have left traces in these traditional discourses such that "the symp tom of this disavowal remains to be deciphered" {ATT 14; see 113). For this human disavowal of the animal is not, we might imagine, "just one disavowal among others," insofar as it is the very one that "institutes what is proper to man, the relation to itself of a humanity that is above all anxious about, and jealous of, what is proper to it" (ATT 14). Derrida evokes in this regard the "I think that Cartesianism belongs, beneath its mechanistic indifference, to the judeo-Chris tiano-Islamic tradition of a war against the animal, of a sacrificial war that is as old as Genesis. And that war is not just one means of applying technoscience to the animal in the absence of another possible or foreseeable means; no, that violence or war has until now been constitutive of the project or of the very possibility of technoscientific knowledge within the process of humanization or of the appropriation of man by man, including its most highly developed eth ical or religious forms" (ATT 101).</page><page sequence="23">Μ.

It is the denial or disavowal of this trauma that thus appears to be reaching a critical phase along with the unprecedented violence against animals that this disavowal is supposed to conceal. The language of repression, denegation, or disavowal thus runs throughout The Animal That Therefore I Am, and it is juxtaposed throughout with a series of claims about what cannot be denied or can no longer be denied. Derrida argues, for example, that "no one can deny \nier\ the suffering, fear, or panic, the terror or fright that can seize certain animals and that we humans can witness... No doubt either, then, of there being within us the possibility of giving vent to a surge of compassion, even if it is then misunderstood, repressed, or denied [denie\, held at bay" {ATT28). The contradiction here is only apparent, or rather, it actually bears witness to a logic of denegation. Because we cannot deny the suffering of animals, because we cannot deny our compassion for that suffering, all we can do is deny or repress it. Adding denial upon denial, the contemporary scope and urgency of the situation makes the denial at once more and less obvious, at once easier and harder to hide from or to hide from oneself. No one can deny seriously any more, or for very long, that men do all they can in order to dissimulate this cruelty or to hide it from themselves; in order to organize on a global scale the forgetting or misunderstanding of this violence, which some would compare to the worst cases of genocide... One should neither abuse the figure of genocide nor too quickly consider it explained away. (ATT26) Along with this recognition of our long-standing denial and dissimulation of the suffering of animals might thus come, Derrida argues, a new surge in this "surge of compassion," this "fundamental compassion" that is probably behind what Derrida considers to be the admirable and yet "problematic" notion of animal rights. It is, in any case, what arouses protest within us and promises "to awaken us to our responsibilities and our obligations vis-ä-vis the living in general" and, on the basis of this, "to change even the very cor nerstone.. . of the philosophical problematic of the animal" {ATT 26-27).

Naas / Research in Phenomenology 40 (2010) 219-242 by a dangerous pathos with regard to the animal, pathos being, it seems, the negative counterpart of this new surge of compassion (see ATT 26). If Derri da's language is strident and emphatic throughout this work, it is not because he wants, or wants simply, to arouse our pathos but because he wants to motivate our passion, challenge our thinking, and transform our distinctions. Hence Derrida, weighing his words, speaks of a "veritable war of the species" (Λ7Τ31), a war that is "probably ageless" but that, he hypothesizes, is "pass ing through a critical phase" {ATT 29). The end or goal of this war would be, Derrida argues, to bring about "a world without animals," that is, a world "without any animal worthy of the name and living for something other than to become a means for man: livestock, tool, meat, body, or experimental life form" {ATT 102; see 79-80). This war against animals would thus aim for the transformation of the animal into a pure means bereft of any kind of value beyond its value for man, its life of any kind of dignity beyond its abil ity to sustain or prolong human life. The Animal That Therefore I Am is thus at once an argument and a plea, a claim and a call, an analysis of the phi losophical tradition with regard to the animal and an intervention in that tradition. As we have seen, Derridas analyses aim always to question both the human denial of certain capacities to the animal and the human attribution of these same capacities to man. His aim is always to rethink the line between the ani mal and the human, to take up the animal within the human, and to do so for the sake of both the animal and the human animal. Derrida's call to take up the question of the animal thus aims both to question man's confidence and assurance in himself, to analyze the traces of a certain denegation, denial, or repression that is perhaps at the origin of this confidence, and then—by working through or thinking through this trauma—to multiply and differen tiate the lines separating the human from the animal so as to intervene in this war between the species. That is the ethical motivation behind The Animal That Therefore I Am and the contemporary urgency that presses Derrida to speak here with such passion and, yes, with such flair.</page></plain_text>
