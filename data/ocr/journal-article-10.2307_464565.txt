Susan Sniader Lanser. THE NARRATIVE ACT: POINT OF VIEW IN PROSE FICTION. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981. "Fiction" is a somewhat problematical notion, more heavily used, it would seem, in the publishing trade and in public libraries than in literary criticism.* It suggests that for readers and editors the most important distinction, when con- fronted with a piece of writing, is whether it speaks of real situations and events or imagined ones. When you inquire for a title in a bookstore, the clerk is likely to ask you whether it is fiction or non-fiction, and bestseller lists have, for reasons that remain obscure to me, chosen "fiction" and "non-fiction" as the appropriate way of dividing the multifarious corpus of publications. But when you turn from the organizing principles of bookstores, libraries, and bestseller lists to the books themselves, it is not clear how important this distinction is. If you compare books on the fiction bestseller list with those on the non-fiction bestseller list, you are likely to find that many of the latter seem much more fan- tastically fictional than the former: Thin Thighs in Thirty Days -a seductive fic- tion; No Bad Dogs-obviously about a fictional world. Certainly, there are many weeks when the non-fiction bestseller list seems more resolutely fic- tional- more imaginatively devoted to fantasies designed to gratify the reading public-than the so-called fiction list. But, of course, the term "fiction" when used by publishers, booksellers, and most readers except some theoretically-inclined specialists, designates imagina- tive prose narratives (novels and short stories)- as opposed to poetry, on the one hand, which will not be found in the fiction section, nor on the fiction bestseller list, and to non-fiction on the other. Non-fiction seems to comprise works which either are not narratives, or, if they are narratives, claim to recount historical events of some sort. This terminological situation is somewhat strange: we speak of "fiction-writers," for example, and famous books bear titles such as The Craft of Fiction and The Rhetoric of Fiction. The most general problem of the theory of fiction might therefore be, what is the relationship of the notion of fiction to the qualities of the writings discussed under this heading? What is the role of the notion of fiction in the theory of fiction? Surprisingly, most of the advances in the theory of fiction of the past twenty-five years come from the study not of fiction as a mode, nor even of the novel as a genre, but of something else. For example, Rene Girard's pioneering Deceit, Desire and the Novel studied major European novels as dramas based on the mimetic mechanisms of desire, "triangular desire," in which the subject's desire is con- stituted as imitation of another desire. But mimetic desire turned out to be * This paper was written for the Georgetown University conference on the Theory of Fic- tion in June 1983.</page><page sequence="2">neither restricted to the novel nor able to define a distinctive generic structure but a phenomenon of pervasive importance, as Girard's later work has shown. His book might stand as an illustration of the way the most pertinent and productive investigations in our field seem to bear in the end not on the canon of masterpieces of fiction but on some dif- ferent and larger class of phenomena. Most advances in the theory of fiction, though, have focused on narrative and can be grouped under the heading of narratology: study of the structure of narrative and the func- tioning of its major constituents. First, recent criticism has enormously refined the Russian Formalists' distinction between fabula and sjuzhet, as in Gerard Genette's Narrative Discourse, which charts possible relations of frequency and order, and Meir Sternberg's Expositional Modes and Temporal Ordering in Fiction, which investigates the potential of a great many different relations between narrative presentation or narrative order and plot order or story time. Genette's account of frequency and his descriptions of the iterative mode and the pseudo-iterative seem to me particularly valuable-the pseudo-iterative emerges, in fact, as one of the distinctive features of Proustian narrative. But there is a sense in which these subtle and exhaustive studies of the relations between fabula and sjuzhet in fictional narratives do not go far enough; they miss the kind of insight afforded by studies which look at the relations between fabula and sjuzhet in non- literary cases. For example, Peter Brooks's articles "Freud's Masterplot" and especially "Fic- tions of the Wolfman" pursue the now widespread and productive enterprise of reading Freud's case histories as narratives, where relations between the fabula and sjuzhet prove quite complicated. The operation of deferred action (Nachtraglichkeit), for example, makes it difficult to establish a bedrock of events which then get reordered by narrative; for nar- rative ordering may be what constitutes key events as events. In the case of the Wolfman, whose neurosis is traced to a traumatic primal scene-the sight of his parents copulating at age one and a half- Freud notes that this decisive, originary moment might in fact be a fan- tasy, concocted from later observation of animals copulating and transferred to the parents: a fantasy operating as primal event through deferred action. The situating of the fantasy at age one and a half, which is what gives it primacy in the fabula of this narrative, would then be the product of narrative requirements. Freud writes, "The scene which was to be made up had to fulfill certain conditions, which, in consequence of the circumstances of the dreamer's life, could only be found in this early period; such, for instance, was the condition that he should be in bed in his parent's bedroom" [The Wolfman 223]. As Brooks observes in "Fictions of the Wolfman," here "A narrative explanation which surely foresaw that much of its celebrity would come from its recovery of so spectacular a moment of origin doubles back on itself... to suggest another kind of referentiality." With the constitution of events by fundamental fantasies, "tales may lead back not so much to events as to other tales, to man as a structure of the fictions he tells about himself" [78]. He concludes that "The case history of the Wolfman's story, itself embedded in modern history, suggests a paradigm of the status of modern explanation, which must on the one hand see itself as narrative, concerned with a set of histories and the mediations among them, and on the other hand recognizes that the traditional tenets and the very authority of narrative have been subverted, that the bases of explanation have been radically problematized" [74]. By pursuing a narratological problem into non-literary realms, we discover to what extent the case history-a non-fictional scien- tific genre concerning real people, their circumstances and their suffering, etc. - is ultimately allied to the fictional. This shows the scope and functioning of the fictional in ways relevant to literary study itself. It also indicates a problem in the theory of fiction: when you leave fic- tion you rediscover fictions. The second development has been reflection on the narrative audience, in all its guises: narratees, actual readers, ideal readers, intended readers, superreaders, authorial audiences, implied readers. I think the most useful scheme is offered by Peter Rabinowitz in his article 'Truth in Fiction: A Reexamination of Audiences," which distinguishes the actual audience, the authorial audience (which takes the work as a fictional communication from the author), the narrative audience (which takes the work as a communication from the narrator), and the ideal narrative audience (perhaps unfortunately named) which interprets the narrator's communication as the narrator appears to wish. The greater the refinements in the study of narratees, of various sorts of implied and real readers, though, the more apparent it becomes diacritics/ spring 1984 3</page><page sequence="3">that this is an exercise in fiction-making. This is relatively clear in the case of the implied reader, which in Wolfgang Iser's account, for example, functions to enable him to cast his interpretation in the form of a narrative, a story of what the implied reader grasps and doesn't grasp, where he encounters gaps and how he fills them in. The implied reader functions as a fictional character in a story of reading. In many cases, reference to the reader is an attempt to ground interpretations upon a supposed experience-the presence of certain textual structures would be demonstrated by their effects on readers. I've argued elsewhere that one can show the fictional character of this supposed experience-Stanley Fish's reader never learns anything from his reading, but repeatedly expects a line-ending to close a syntactic unit, and is repeatedly astonished or discomfited when the next line brings a change in the hypothesized construction. I have also argued that feminist criticism is best regarded, not as a record of the experience of women readers but, in Elaine Showalter's words, as exploration of "the way in which the hypothesis of a female reader changes our apprehension of a given text, awakening us to the significance of its sexual codes." A well-known article by Walter Ong is entitled 'The Writer's Audience is Always a Fiction," to which one might add that the reader's experience - at least in interpretations- is always a fiction: a narrative construction in a story of reading. Study of readers of various sorts has resulted in a wide range of stories of reading- narratives of what happens to the reader as he or she encounters the sequence of words. When students write papers about novels they frequently proceed by imagining a reader- what it would be like to be a reader- and cast their paper as a fictional narrative of what "the reader" feels, perceives, realizes. The fiction of a reader is absolutely central to the reading of fiction. What we discover when we try to explain fiction by reference to the reader is this central role of fictions of reading. There is a certain circularity here that seems to me central to the theory of fiction. The third development in the field of narratology has been the expansion of work on the discrimination of narrators and narrative perspectives-the tradition of James and Lub- bock. The notion of narrative point of view in fiction has itself been made more coherent by the concept of focalization proposed by Genette and clarified by Mieke Bal, which empha- sizes a distinction between who sees and who speaks, a distinction often elided by the association of point of view with narrative consciousness. The discrimination of narrators has reached a stage of immense sophistication. This whole aspect of the poetics of fiction is ably synthesized in Susan Lanser's The Narrative Act: Point of View in Prose Fiction, which com- prehensively identifies a great range of variables affecting narrative point of view, on a series of scales (rather than as features which are simply present or absent). In the course of this she raises one problem which previous theorists have neglected, the sex of narrators. "Sex dif- ferences permeate the uses of language and condition the reception of discourse," she argues; "along with other social identifiers marking the relationship of a textual personage to the dominant social class, sex is important to the encoding and decoding of narrative voice" [166]. This is a very interesting line of investigation, but instead of looking for discursive features that might identify a female narrative voice, Lanser suggests that the "presence of a female name on the title page signals a female narrative voice, in the absence of markings to the contrary" [167]. Later this is treated as a convention to appeal to: "By virtue of the con- ventions linking the author's social identity with that of the heterodiegetic [3rd person] narrative voice, the narrator is female" [in a particular case] [250]. The question is, first, whether this is really so. Do we construct narrators on this principle- invariably giving them a sex (the same sex as the author unless there are contrary indications)? Do readers in fact assume that it is a woman who says, "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife"? Lanser's argument that prior critics have neglected the question of the sex of narrators, and have treated narrators as male suggests that it hasn't worked quite this way. One might note that Mary Louise Pratt, whom Lanser generally admires, repeatedly refers to the fictional speaker of this opening sentence of Pride and Prejudice as "he." I think this question of the sex of narrative voices is a significant problem in the theory of fiction which focuses a number of important issues. First, there is the problem of what to appeal to in discussion of texts and reading. Lanser appeals here to convention, but if one is interested in changing our procedures of reading, as she seems to be, this won't suffice. If she 4</page><page sequence="4">wants us to recognize that aspects of the vision or discourse of narrators which we value belong to women, she must proceed differently. One can't avoid the reference to conven- tion, since narrators are constructed by conventional procedures of reading, but one must at some point appeal to the way in which following or not following a given convention will affect the significance of the works being read. This brings us to the second point, a question about the politics of reading. Doubtless we have assumed that the voice of authority is male, albeit a comprehensive male voice (in which sexual distinctiveness is neutralized). One might imagine that one was being scrupulous and scientific in speaking of the narrator of a Jane Austen or George Eliot novel as "he," which only confirms a link between patriarchy and systematic thought that we ought to be working to change. Yet what is the best way to change? To call the narrators of all novels by women "she" (unless instructed otherwise) begs a number of important questions about gender and genre- that a feminine voice is what women writers naturally produce. Trying to infer the sex of individual narrators from the character of their reflections and judgments, though, risks conferring authority on the most tendentious stereotypes, which would come to serve as standards: this observation sounds feminine, this one masculine .... Might it not be better to call all narrators of all novels "she," unless otherwise instructed? The question seems to me at the very least an open one. If Lanser is right that we do identify narrators of novels by women as female, then the question is whether there might be better strategies. Third, the issue of the sex of narrators illustrates the compulsion, endemic to the recent study of narrative, to explain textual details by relating them to qualities of persons. This has been our most powerful strategy of naturalization for dealing with refractory modern fictions: the most bizarre formulations and juxtapositions are recuperated as the discourse of an obsessional, neurotic, or otherwise deranged narrator. The more sophisticated we become in treating discursive details as reflections of the attitudes and assumptions of narrators, the more we encourage the notion that to interpret fiction is above all to identify in all detail the person who speaks it. The argument would be, though this is not how Lanser presents it, that since every person has a sex, and narrators are people, every narrator must have a sex, and to omit discussion of the sex of narrators is to miss important aspects of novels. This argu- ment is plausible only, it seems to me, because we have come to take for granted that we explain textual details by adducing narrators and explain narrators by adducing qualities of real people. Now fictions have their source in persons in that authors construct them, but this is a far cry from the notion that the meaning of elements is what they reveal about the personalities and attitudes of people who function as narrators. I think here lies a major problem for the theory of fiction today, when narrative analysis has become so resourceful and, in dubious collusion with speech act theory, is attempting to convince us that a narrative is an act of a person. The theory of fiction needs to be alert to the inadequacies of this orientation, which 5 diacritics/ spring 1984</page><page sequence="5">strives to convert everything in language to a mark of human personalities. There is, of course, a great deal of patterning in texts that is not a sign of personality. Much of literature is interesting and compelling precisely because it does something other than illustrate the per- sonality of a narrator. For the moment I want to suggest that this strategy of naturalization and anthropomorphism should be recognized not as an analytical perspective on fiction, but as part of the fiction-making process. That is to say, making narrators is not an analytical operation that lies outside the domain of fiction but very much a continuation of fiction- making: dealing with details by imagining a narrator; telling a story about a narrator and his/her response so as to make sense of them. Let me come back to the notion of fiction. The most common notion of fiction, as opposed to non-fiction, is that non-fiction treats real characters and events while fiction treats imaginary ones, makes assertions about characters who don't exist, events that never occurred, or in short, about fictional worlds. But a number of critics who have addressed the theory of fiction recently have argued that novels are not real assertions about fictional characters but fictional assertions-or rather, fictional imitations of assertions. Richard Ohmann proposed this some time ago in his article "Literature as Act." Recently it has been articulated in Barbara Herrnstein Smith's On the Margins of Discourse, which argues that literary artworks should be considered as depictions or imitations of natural discourse. "The various genres of literary art," she writes, ". .. can to some extent be distinguished according to what types of discourse ... they characteristically represent" [8]. A novel "is a depiction of-a fictive instance of-a kind of book" [31]. "Novels ... have typically been representa- tions of chronicles, journals, letters, memoirs, and biographies" [30]. For Smith, the essential contrast is between natural discourse and fictive discourse. Natural discourse is "the verbal acts of real persons on particular occasions in response to particular sets of circumstances" [15]. Fictive discourse imitates or represents real discourse. Of course, the characters, events and the narrator of a novel are fictional. "The essential fic- tiveness of novels, however," Smith writes, "is not to be discovered in the unreality of the characters, objects, and events alluded to, but in the unreality of the alluding themselves. In other words, in a novel or tale, it is the act of reporting events, the act of describing persons and referring to places that is fictive. The novel represents the verbal action of a man report- ing, describing, and referring" [29]. The writer of fiction, for example, is "pretending to be writing a biography while actually fabricating one" [30]. "Although a [literary work] is a representation of discourse, we can understand it, infer meanings from it, only through our prior experiences with the sort of things it does represent, namely natural utterances in historical contexts" [37]. To understand fictive discourse, then, is to treat it as if it were a representation of a real person performing a natural discursive act. The distinction comes to be one between utterances that are really said by speakers or writers and those that are not said but constructed, fabricated, and so on. Felix Martinez Bonati in Fictive Discourse and the Structures of Literature puts it slightly differently but more dramatically: a literary work consists of non-linguistic signs that imitate linguistic signs, pseudo sentences which "make present an authentic sentence from another communicative situation" (and to comprehend the sentence is to imagine its communicative situation) [79]. Again 'The author communicates to us not a particular situation by means of real linguistic signs, but, rather, imaginary linguistic signs by means of non-linguistic ones. In other words, the author himself does not communicate with us by means of language; instead he com- municates language to us" [81]. For both of these theorists fiction is an imitation of real historical utterance, and is understood by taking the real world utterances as a model for the relations between fictional utterance, fictional speaker, and fictional world. But when in order to elucidate the model we inquire about the structure and properties of the real-world, historical discourses of which literature is a fictional imitation, we come upon a fertile branch of narratology which in its recent investigations of narrative as a fundamental category of understanding or scheme of intelligibility, has come to assert the fictional character of this supposedly natural or real substratum. If a novel is a fictional imitation of real historical-interpretive discourse, what if history writing is a form of fiction making? I cite Hayden White, who urges in Tropics of Discourse that we overcome our "reluctance to consider historical narratives as what they 6</page><page sequence="6">most manifestly are, verbal fictions, the contents of which are as much invented as found and the forms of which have more in common with their counterparts in literature than they have with those in the sciences" [82]. Histories achieve explanatory effect by operations of "emplotment": "by emplotment I mean simply the encodation of facts contained in chronicle as components of specific kinds of plot structure, in precisely the way Frye has suggested is the case with 'fictions' in general" [83]. For White, "understanding historical narratives involves coming to realize that the story is of one kind rather than another, romance, tragedy, comedy, satire, epic" and so on [86]. In other words, intelligibility depends on their emplotment according to literary models, which they could be said to imitate. Nor is White's argument an isolated case. W. B. Gallie, the English author of Philosophy and Historical Understanding working out of a quite different tradition, explains real-world historical narrative on the model of the very sorts of stories which the theoreticians of fiction tell us are imitation histories. Taking literature as the model for describing historical intel- ligibility, Gallie argues that historical understanding is a special case of what is involved in following a story and appeals to "the familiar unquestionable facts of the experience of following a story. We follow a story through or across contingencies-accidents, coin- cidences, unpredictable events of all kinds; yet the story's general direction and continuous advance towards its final conclusion somehow succeed in rendering these contingencies acceptable" [30]. 'To make sense of their span," writes Frank Kermode in The Sense of an Ending, "men need fictive concords with origins and ends, such as give meaning to lives and to poems" [7]. The repetition of a clock's ticking is mastered, ordered, by the fiction which articulates identical sounds as tick, tock, with beginning and end-the model, Kermode writes, of what we call a plot [45]. When we consult this branch of narratology-the study of narrative as a fundamental system of intelligibility-we find once again that non-literary discourses prove to function according to principles and processes most dramatically and explicitly manifested in literature, so that literature serves as the model for what is involved in the intelligibility they confer. Moreover, this sort of analysis, which reverses the usual hierarchical relation of dependency between the literary and the non-literary, alters one's conception of these fic- tive structures, suggesting, as in Kermode's The Sense of an Ending, the possibility of taking literature as the point of departure for a general theory of fictions. "That there is a simple rela- tion between literary and other fictions seems, if one attends to it, more obvious than has appeared," Kermode writes, noting that literary fictions are models that enable us to make sense of the world [36]. In describing how theorists of fiction treat literary narratives as imita- tions of real-world historical accounts, and how analysts of historical narrative in turn present historical discourse as constructed according to literary models- White speaks of "the essen- tially literary nature of the historical classics" [89]-I am identifying a certain circularity into which these concepts seem to entrap us. But in fact this process of reversal is not fully cir- cular, because the fictions of the historian are not the same as the fictions of these literary theorists. The former are fictions that order and interpret-construct, shall we say-a vital and primary sense of fiction, one which is even more central to the functioning of literary fic- tions than other senses. ("What can be thought must certainly be a fiction," says Nietzsche [Kermode 34]). The theorists of fiction who are drawing upon speech act theory have placed the emphasis on a different sense of fiction -fiction as imitation speech act; and what this does, oddly enough, is to give a central role to the narrator-the perpetrator of this represented act-and to disguise the more fundamental fictionality of literary artifice or literary ordering by positing that the work fictively represents what must be interpreted as if it were a real person uttering the discourse of the work. In order to see what is at stake here, the problems that seem to me to arise in the rela- tions between the orientation of speech act theory, emphasis on narrators, and the concept of fiction as applied to the novel, let me turn to one of the most interesting books of recent years, Mary Louise Pratt's Towards a Speech Act Theory of Literary Discourse. Unlike Barbara Herrnstein Smith and Richard Ohmann, who from the outset treat literary works as fictional imitations of other sorts of non-fictional discourse, Pratt, once she gets past a misguided polemic that tries to oppose speech act theory and structuralism, is interested in showing that literary narratives are members of a large class of "narrative display texts"-stories "representing states of affairs and experiences which are held to be unusual or problematic in 7 diacritics/ spring 1984</page><page sequence="7">such a way that the addressee will respond affectively in the intended way, adopt the intended evaluation and interpretation, take pleasure in doing so, and generally find the whole undertaking worth it" [148]. Her favorite examples, designed to show that supposedly literary qualities are found in discourse not regarded as literature, are stories the socio- linguist William Labov collected in his work on speech patterns, and which he calls "natural narrative." After describing Labov's analyses Pratt argues that "literary and natural narrative are formally and functionally very much alike. Put another way, all the problems of coherence, chronology, causality, foregrounding, plausibility, selection of detail, tense, point of view, and emotional intensity exist for the natural narrator just as much as they do for the novelist, and they are confronted and solved by speakers of the language every day" [66]. She concludes, "Unless we are foolish enough to claim that people organize their oral anecdotes around patterns they learn from reading literature"- not quite so absurd an idea as she seems to think-"we are obliged to draw the obvious conclusion that the formal similarities between natural narrative and literary narrative derive from the fact that at some level of analysis they are utterances of the same type." Most of the features which poeticians have believed constituted the literariness of novels are not literary at all. 'They occur in novels not because they are novels but because they are members of some other more general category of speech acts": narrative display texts, i.e. utterances whose relevance is tellability [69]. The claim is that novels are not fictional imitations of real speech acts, such as writing an autobiography, but real instances of the speech act of articulating a narrative display text. For Pratt, what is distinctive about literary works within this genre is that they are published. They have undergone a process of selection (and may have become part of a for- mal canon), so that we can assume that they are deliberately constructed as they are (free of gross errors) and have been thought well constructed and "worth it" by other people [116]. Most important, the literary work is distinguished by what Pratt calls a "hyper-protected cooperative principle": we can assume that digressions, apparent irrelevancies, and obscu- rities have a communicative purpose, and instead of imagining that the speaker is being uncooperative, as we would with other discourses, we struggle to interpret the elements that flout principles of efficient communication, in the interests of some further communicative goal. This is, I think, a powerful and perspicacious discussion of fiction. Price uses H. L. Grice's account of conversational implicature to describe, explicitly, how a wide range of literary effects are made possible by the assumption of purposiveness (the hyper-protected cooperative principle). And, as I have mentioned, novels are treated not as non-serious or fictional speech acts, or as conglomerations of pseudo-sentences or non-linguistic signs, but as real instances of a broad class of discourses: narrative display texts. In the course of this analysis, Pratt maintains that fictionality is a relatively unimportant feature of narrative display texts. Countering Richard Ohmann's suggestion that literature is a series of quasi- speech-acts (fictional imitations of real world speech acts), she argues that fic- tionality is not centrally functional. A supposedly non-fictional narrative display text, such as Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, requires the same kind of interpretive moves as, say, Emma. "Pragmatically speaking, I have no more knowledge of the situations reported and the reporting circumstances in the former case than I do in the latter. Unless I am otherwise acquainted with Capote or his characters, the events and the speakers of In Cold Blood, like those of Emma, do not exist for me outside the text" [94]. Non-fictional narrative accounts, that is to say, are world-creating in the same sense as are works of literature. 'The only dif- ference for me between the two speech situations is my knowledge that Capote intends me to believe his story really happened, and the only effect this has on my reading experience is perhaps an intensification of certain perlocutionary effects-the same perlocutionary effects Conrad tries to capture by having Marlow tell us Lord Jim." Moreover, she notes that natural narratives do not become infelicitous when they concern people and places the audience never heard of (or perhaps even do not exist); Labov's natural narratives contain a good por- tion of hyperbole which might well be regarded as fictional. She argues that in many cases the line between fiction and non-fiction is extremely unclear, and that in many cases it is entirely appropriate for the issue to remain undecided. If a lecturer begins a talk with a joke about what happened on the way to the lecture room, the audience is not supposed to 8</page><page sequence="8">decide whether this incident really occurred or not. Fictionality, she claims, is not an impor- tant criterion for setting off a major class of narrative display texts. This looks like a very promising line of argument, but, alas, the notion of fictionality reappears, and the reasons why it does are quite instructive. It is reintroduced not because Pratt decides that it matters after all whether the events recounted in narrative display texts really occurred or whether the characters described actually exist. It reappears in connection with narrators, because of the need to make a distinction between the author of a narrative display text and fictional speaker or narrator. We have been regarding novels as real world narrative display texts: Labov's narrative display texts are presented by their authors to an audience, and so are novels. But in discussing Tristram Shandy Pratt must distinguish what Sterne, the author, does from what "Shandy, the fictional speaker," as she calls him, does [166]. Pratt recognizes that she is here doing something at odds with her previous position: "In distinguishing between the fictional speaker of a work of literature and its real-world speaker, the author, I have tacitly adopted the view that many literary works are, as Ohmann puts it, 'imitation speech acts.' Though I disagree with Ohmann on the consequences of that view, I think such an analysis is in itself correct and necessary if we are to describe the reader's role in the literary speech situation" [173]. In books with first person narrators, some move of this sort is clearly necessary. The author is producing a display text, in which a fictional speaker in a fictional speech situation addresses an audience of some sort. The fictional speakers may fail to fulfill numerous com- municative maxims. The author always (by virtue of the hyperprotected cooperative princi- ple) exploits these principles by flouting them. "Authors, in other words, can mimetically represent all kinds of nonfulfillment, for what counts as a lie, a clash, an opting out, or an unintentional failure on the part of the fictional speaker or writer counts as a flouting on the part of the real-world author and involves an implicature that the nonfulfillment is in accord with the purpose of the exchange in which the reader and the author are engaged" [174]. But once having treated novels as fictional speech acts, Pratt, following the precepts inculcated by narrative analysis, extends this principle to all novels. She writes of Pride and Prejudice, The Mayor of Casterbridge, and Pere Goriot for example-all of which by her earlier arguments might be regarded as real world narrative display texts, "We are intended to treat these novels as (imitation) written narrative display texts and to decode them according to generic norms alone ... We execute In Cold Blood in the same way we execute a novel, because we execute novels in the same way we execute In Cold Blood - as if they were real- world narrative display texts" [207]. Pratt reintroduces the notion of novels as fictional speech acts in order to account for cases where, as in first person narratives, readers need to treat the speaker as a character engaging in certain discursive actions: explaining his past, wondering about his future, failing to make sense of things, contradicting himself, and so on. But she then assumes, against her diacritics/ spring 1984 9</page><page sequence="9">own arguments, that all novels are fictional speech acts- doubtless because we have been trained to think that all novels have narrators. Perhaps one should have known that someone who accepts the term "natural narrative" for Labov's examples would end by finding a way to make novels unnatural. The consequence of this definition of novels as imitation speech acts is to focus atten- tion on narrators-who is the narrator? what act is he or she performing?- and to urge us to seek in all novels something that resembles a real act by a real person. This is a powerful recuperative move: a reader of Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie can make sense of this strange work by finding a real person performing some plausible discursive act. Pratt writes, "obsessive jealousy ... in the fictional speaker of Alain Robbe-Grillet's Jealousy brings about complete narrative and evaluative paralysis." A very peculiar, geometrical descriptive discourse is recuperated as the speech of a husband so obsessed with jealousy that he can- not talk straight and cannot make sense of things. There is real potential for banalization here, in the assumption fostered by the theory of fiction that the strangest textual patterns can be interpreted as signs of some familiar discur- sive act. There are, however, points at which this powerful strategy breaks down and reveals the dubiousness of the assumptions on which it is based. For example, in the case of novels with distinctive first person narrators-the case for which the theory is explicitly designed-one often finds not an imitation of a real world speech act but a quite fantastic speech situation and mode of utterance. Martinez-Bonati, who is critical of Pratt on this point, cites the beginning of Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which portrays a world we find quite realistic but through an impossible speech situation. The first person nar- rator is not telling his life story- the narrative, in the present tense, offers an ongoing account of what happens, or what is happening now. It is not interior monologue, in that much of the information is not what one would impart or represent to oneself; yet it is not speech spoken to any audience. As Martinez-Bonati notes, "It is precisely in modern realistic literature that we find the most unrealistic types of discourse and of speech-situations" [104]. They're out there. Black boys in white suits up before me to commit sex acts in the hall and get it mopped up before I can catch them. They're mopping when I come out of the dorm, all three of them sulky and hating everything, the time of day, the place they're at here, the people they got to work around ... I creep along the wall quiet as dust in my canvas shoes, but they got special sensitive equipment detects my fear and they all look up .... The effect of this kind of discourse is the vivid portrayal of a speaker-his world, his language, and his thought processes. The one thing we cannot say about it is that it is a fic- tional imitation of a real-world speech act. In short, the theory breaks down for some of the very cases for which it was designed: narrative discourses which are most vividly the language of a fictional speaker. A second difficulty bears on the distinction between real and imitation speech acts. Pratt's definition makes third person narratives such as Le Pere Goriot and Pride and Prej- udice imitation narrative display texts, while Labov's anecdotes are real narrative display texts. In the latter a real speaker tells a story; in the former a fictional speaker tells a story, and we can discuss the qualities of this implied speaker, as opposed to those of the author. But of course we can also identify just as readily the assumptions, the authority, and other qualities of the speakers in Labov's narratives. We have no knowledge of the real speakers but only of the narrative personae projected by the stories. The two do not necessarily correspond, and two different stories by the same speaker may project quite different narrators. If the possibility of identifying a narrator is what justifies treating third person novels as imitation speech acts, then natural narratives, which also have narrative personae, are also imitation speech acts-in which a projected or created speaker recounts a story. Indeed, there is a sense in which all speech acts are imitation speech acts. To perform a speech act is to imitate a model, to take on the role of someone performing this particular speech act. The self-consciousness with which introducers perform their introductions, or with which a 10</page><page sequence="10">chairperson says "I hereby call this meeting to order," testifies to the fact that to perform a speech act is to adopt a persona. The more formal the act, the more vivid our sense of this fundamental truth. Thus the definition of fiction as fictional speech acts is inexact: at once too broad and too narrow. Many literary narratives, especially first person narratives, are representations of speech acts by fictional speakers (but even here the idea that they are imitations of real world speech acts may be wrong); but to assimilate all novels to this model is misleading and banalizing. Moreover, the notion of fictional speech acts does not distinguish novels from anecdotes, for in the second, broader sense, all contain narrative personae, as do all speech acts. The theory I am contesting emerges from the convergence of point of view studies and speech act theory. It promotes the notion that a literary work is above all a narrative act and that to analyze a narrative act is above all to relate textual details to the attitude of a speaker, who acts like a real person. Susan Lanser writes, "Speech act theory reminds us that every speech act is produced by someone (or some group)" [81]. Certainly discourses are written by someone, but this is not what the proponents of these theories have in mind, for they want us to ask not what Henry James or Jane Austen is doing (the answer would be, articu- lating a narrative display text); they want us to investigate the speaker or narrator as, in Lanser's phrase, "an originating subject." This orientation in the theory of fiction carries an ideology that needs to be investigated. At the very least, it seems to be dedicated to eradicating the possibility that language might prove to be in some way inhuman. These remarks on the theory of fiction have focused on two problems. First, there is the question of the role of the notion of fiction in the theory of fiction. It seems as though attempts to explain fiction and fictions end up either constructing fictions-imagined readers, stories of reading, imagined speakers- or appealing to structures which themselves turn out to rely on fiction, as in the case of the fictional emplotting that organizes the real world discourses fiction is said to imitate. Second, there is the problem of the convergence of narrative studies and speech act theory, where the new emphasis on fictionality-the claim that literary works are fictional speech acts- paradoxically urges us to treat narrators as if they were real people, with all that that entails. There is a powerful humanistic ideology behind this claim. The theory of fiction needs to challenge this orientation and explore the possibility that literary narratives are, as in Pratt's first account, real world narrative display texts: not fictional speech acts but, if they must be acts at all, real acts of narration.
