Al- bany: State University of New York Press, 1995. Pp. xiv + 257. The multi-faceted oeuvre of Rabbi Levi ben Gershom (1288-1344) con- tinues to attract scholarly attention, and here, for the first time, is a mono- graph devoted to Gersonides' biblical commentaries, or more precisely, to his interpretation of the chosen-people concept contained therein. It may seem odd that it has taken this long for the commentaries to receive sus- tained scholarly treatment; the commentaries on the Early Prophets and on Job have never ceased to be reprinted in the standard Rabbinic Bibles, and in recent years, critical and semicritical editions of individual commentaries have started to appear. Even the late Amos Funkenstein, who considered the commentaries to be a "dry, schematic, repetitive, and dogmatic exercise," conceded that they flesh out in many cases the details of positions taken in Gersonides' philosophical treatise, the Wars of the Lord. In the present work, Robert Eisen goes further by demonstrating that certain classical Jewish concepts find their fullest treatment in the context of the commentaries. The author's strategy is first to present a brief philosophical analysis, drawn mainly from the Wars, of the three concepts employed by Gersonides to explicate the chosen-people doctrine: individual providence, miracles, and what is here termed "inherited providence" (Chapter 2). The rest of the book examines the application of these concepts in Jewish history from the cov- enant of Abraham to the messianic era, providing, in effect, a philosophy of Jewish history (Chapters 3-5, 7, 8). Along the way there is a consideration of Gersonides' view on Torah and esoteric discourse (Chapter 6) and the lan- guage of providence in the biblical commentaries (Chapter 9). Eisen focuses his attention on Gersonides' attempt to present the doctrine of the chosen people along Aristotelian lines, a task about as likely to suc- ceed as that of squaring the circle. Israel's special status is explained in light of his naturalistic theory of providence, which is more complex than pre- sented here. As in Maimonides, there is a distinction between general prov- idence, which is the preservation of sublunar species by the celestial bodies working in tandem with the supernal Agent Intellect, and individual provi- dence, which pertains only to rational creatures, and which is a function of the bond acquired between the human and Agent Intellect through the pro- cess of intellection: the stronger the bond, the greater the protection of the individual. General providence represents the "givens" in a person's life: physical makeup, intelligence, natural dispositions, etc. Individual providence is a function of intellectual/spiritual effort and achievement.</page><page sequence="2">EISEN, GERSONIDES ON PROVIDENCE-MANEKIN 333 But Gersonides differs from Maimonides in that he incorporates astrology within his theory of general providence and thus holds that people can be protected from harm because of astral-based predispositions. A person blessed with good luck may "providentially suffer" a lesser evil that causes him to avoid a greater one-e.g., when he injures his foot, thereby causing him to miss a boat that subsequently sinks-and this providence will be considered general because good luck is astrally-ordered. (Eisen appears to view all cases of providential suffering as pertaining to individual providence [56], but this cannot be correct in cases such as our example because intellectual achievement is not relevant here.) So although Gersonides appears to dis- tinguish between "general" and "individual" providence, the real distinction is between providence that is astral-based and that which is intellect-based, and both types cut across the individual/group distinction. Thus, the in- nate qualities, dispositions, and characteristics of Reuben belong to his "gen- eral" providence, whereas the intellectual/spiritual accomplishments of the Jewish people through observance of the Torah pertains to its "individual" providence. Given this twofold providential scheme, to which sort of providence does the special status of the Jewish people belong-to general, astral-based providence, or to individual, intellect-based providence? Gersonides wishes to view that status as a function of intellectual/spiritual achievement, be- cause he considers individual, intellect-based providence to be primary. But if the achievement is solely that of the Jewish people, then they lose their "chosenness" when they fail to accomplish anything spiritually. Gersonides cannot accept this conclusion since Scripture indicates that the Jewish peo- ple are protected even when they are undeserving. His way out is to make Israel's individual providence depend in part on the extraordinary level of in- dividual providence achieved by their ancestor Abraham. Abraham's provi- dential bond with the Agent Intellect was so great that it not only protected him and those around him during his lifetime, but also guaranteed the sur- vival of his descendants-for, argues Gersonides, his own preservation is lessened if his seed becomes extinct. Thus the unconditional aspect of Is- rael's chosenness-its survival throughout the ages when adverse conditions do not allow it to flourish spiritually-relates to the individual providence achieved by Abraham. As Eisen points out, this theory allows Gersonides to capture both the conditional and the unconditional aspects of covenant, as well as providing a naturalistic interpretation of the Rabbinic doctrine of zekhut abot, the merit of the Fathers. Eisen terms this notion "inherited individual providence," and rightly wonders how it can work in Gersonides' system, given the understanding of individual providence as intellect-based. How can an ignorant Hebrew slave in Egypt, or for that matter, present-day Jews, be protected by the intel- lectual bond fostered by a distant ancestor? Yet, as Eisen himself notes,</page><page sequence="3">334 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Gersonides does not use the description "inherited providence," and it seems to this reviewer to be inaccurate and unhelpful. The Israelites do not inherit Abraham's individual providence; rather it extends to them as part of his own intellect-based providence. (Eisen says that the providence is inherited, "only as an extension of Abraham's original providence" (175), but I think "inher- itance" means something quite different from "extension.") Now Gersonides is silent on how this works, but one can offer the following speculation: insofar as Abraham achieves a permanent bond with the Agent Intellect, he achieves the status of a species, i.e., incorruptible and immortal, something akin to the status of the celestial intellects. In a sense, this happens to all humans when they die (their acquired intellect being indestructible), but they have no guarantee that their "species" will extend to their descendants. In the case of Abraham (and, as Eisen points out, any one else who achieves this level), it extends to his progeny because the Abrahamic "species," as it were, is now indestructible, although in the messianic age, when the Jews will merit their own protection, this sort of providence will be otiose. Whether this interpretation is correct or not, the fact remains that the unconditional special status of the Jews is derived from the special status earned by Abraham and is not a permanent feature of the world from its inception. One may say that it is unconditional with respect to the Jews' own merit but conditional with respect to Abraham's. This alone is sufficient to distinguish it from, say, the sort of metaphysical conception of Israel as advanced by Judah Halevi, according to which Israel is something akin to a species because, like a species, it constitutes a distinctive class of creatures, but unlike varieties of natural species, its principle of organization is "Di- vine" (i.e., supernatural). For Halevi, the special status of Israel is ultimately unconditional and unmerited; for Gersonides, insofar as it relates to Abra- ham, it is neither. This is recognized by Eisen, who, nevertheless, argues that Halevi is a primary influence on Gersonides despite the very real doctrinal differences, and, I may add, despite the fact that Halevi's Kuzari is nowhere mentioned in the Gersonidean corpus, nor does it appear in the list of books belonging to Gersonides, nor does it seem to have had any influence in 13th- and early 14th-century philosophical circles in Provence. The only evidence he adduces, aside from his view that both have a theory of "inherited" prov- idence, is that given the relatively unimportant role played by Jewish par- ticularity in Maimonides' philosophical system "it would have made sense for Gersonides to look to Halevi's philosophy so that it would fit into his Aristotelian thought-system" (176). There is, I think, another reason why Eisen sees the influence of Halevi here, and it relates to how he understands Gersonides' philosophical project in general. According to Eisen, "the challenge which . .. characterizes much of Gersonides' philosophy is in interpreting the central doctrines of the Bible so that they conform to his conception of an impersonal God" (2). This is a fundamental claim of the book, and I am not sure what to make of it. While</page><page sequence="4">EISEN, GERSONIDES ON PROVIDENCE-MANEKIN 335 it is certainly true that Gersonides was willing "to adopt key elements of Aristotelian metaphysics that were in conflict with the thought-world of the Bible and its rabbinic interpretation," this willingness was shared by other medieval Jewish Aristotelians such as Jacob Anatoli, Samuel ibn Tibbon, Joseph ibn Caspi, Isaac Albalag, Isaac Polgar, and, in some cases, Mai- monides himself; like Gersonides, they argued that the conflict was more ap- parent than real. Gersonides' God is no less personal, or subject to change, or interactive with his creatures, than is theirs. The real difference between Gersonides and other Aristotelians is that he goes to greater lengths than they to offer a naturalistic account of Jewish particularism. His efforts indi- cate that he may be more religiously conservative a thinker than is tradition- ally thought. Yet because Eisen accepts the traditional view of Gersonides as a theo- logical radical, especially with respect to God's knowledge of particulars, he expects Gersonides to be challenged to interpret the doctrines of providence, miracles, and chosenness. When Gersonides offers a philosophical interpre- tation of Jewish particularism, Eisen sees that as evidence of Halevi's in- fluence, as if there were fundamentally two models available to Gersonides: Maimonidean (Aristotelian, universalistic, abstract) and Halevian (anti- Aristotelian, particularistic, concrete.) But Aristotelianism comes in many varieties in 13th- and 14th-century Provence, and the view of Gersonides as theologically radical is anachronistic, reflecting the concerns of a handful of prominent Spanish and Italian Jewish rabbis and theologians of a later pe- riod. Pace the author, it is not the case that Gersonides became a controver- sial figure "shortly after his death." In fact, he never seems to have become controversial in Provence, and his works were widely read and influential throughout the Middle Ages; the one attempt to have his commentary on the Torah banned in Italy ended in failure. Had the author judged him alongside other 13th- and 14th-century philosophical exegetes of scripture in Provence he would have found him often more moderate than them, both exegetically and religiously. (For example, in the 14th-century controversy over the pro- priety of treating historical passages in Scripture as allegories, Gersonides sides with the conservatives against the allegorists.) There is no need to appeal to Halevi to explain why Gersonides offers a philosophical explana- tion of Jewish particularism. His own conservative outlook leads him in that direction. Certainly Gersonides' self-perception as a philosopher and as an exegete was not that of a theological radical. Although he was aware that some Jews would have difficulties accepting philosophical interpretations of Scripture, he rarely adopted an esoteric mode of discourse, nor did he hesitate to men- tion explicitly the very doctrines that his opponents would later consider heretical. More importantly, he felt that the biblical text itself was, in Funken- stein's words, "as intelligible as nature itself; certainly in need of an expert guide, sometimes difficult and cunning, yet never a malicious trickster." All</page><page sequence="5">336 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW this is recognized by Eisen, who offers a perceptive and nuanced treatment of the question of esotericism for Gersonides. But he puzzles over Gerson- ides' persistent use of anthropomorphic language in reference to Divine prov- idence because it seems "out of character" with his philosophical principles, even finding an internal philosophical justification for the use of such lan- guage. This is in line with his tendency to view Gersonides as uniquely chal- lenged in his exegetical project because of his impersonal conception of God, as if this were not a issue faced by virtually all medieval philosophical, and many kabbalistic, exegetes. The real question is not how Gersonides can justify using anthropomorphic language when describing God, but rather why he, like other philosophical exegetes, appears not to care about the issue. Despite these and other objections, the present book is a sober and care- ful examination of an important issue in Jewish thought: the doctrine of the chosen people. It advances the field of Gersonides studies; it is the first in- depth treatment of Gersonides' biblical commentaries. Students of Jewish intellectual history who are accustomed to viewing medieval Jewish philos- ophy as either Maimonidean or Halevian will be pleasantly surprised to find a philosophical treatment of Jewish particularity that is neither one nor the other. Eisen's exhaustive and illuminating examination demonstrates that in Gersonides' biblical commentaries, substance overcomes style. University of Maryland CHARLES H. MANEKIN</page></plain_text>
