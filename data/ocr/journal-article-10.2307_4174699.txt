<plain_text><page sequence="1">Milton and the Theory of Accommodation by Neil D. Graves H OW can finite man understand an infinite God? How can an infinite God be communicated? These questions address one of the most fundamental problems in Christian theology, as well as one of the central ideas of the Renaissance. Throughout his- tory theologians have struggled to comprehend a deity who is a priori greater than human understanding, and artists and writers have been at a loss to depict him. The focus of their attention has inevitably been a close scrutiny of the scriptural account of God-a study which en- gages two seminal aspects of the Bible as textual document and de- pository of religious "truth." Yet the information concerning God in the Bible merely seems to complicate the problem. On the one hand the Scriptures describe an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent deity, a spirit, indeed a being who is all too often described via negativa in terms the opposite of which define humanity-immutable, impassible, immaterial, immortal. On the other hand, and simultaneously, the Bible depicts God as sitting on a throne, raising his right hand, and striking down his enemies; he feels anger and regret, love and pity and is known not only as divine creator, but also as father. The theory of accommodation is the traditional theological solution to these incongruities and is an attempt to explain the difference be- tween the nature of God and the textual images or mental conceptions of him. It functions by expressing the incomprehensibility of God in terms which "accommodate" God to human understanding. Accord- ingly, it presupposes that language cannot adequately describe God, while yet authorizing the attempt to depict him, conscious that the re- sulting image is not a true representation of the deity. Accommoda- tion is thus both a method of writing and an hermeneutic principle. The scriptural account of God wearing a crown is an example of accommo- 251 ? 2001 The University of North Carolina Press</page><page sequence="2">252 Milton and the Theory of Accommodation dated writing-an image that describes in comprehensible terms the divine majesty of God. The image is not designed, it would seem, to be taken literally, and it is necessary for the reader to exercise an accom- modatory hermeneutic; this implies that the image is not designed as a veridical representation, but should be understood as a substitute for what otherwise could not be understood. Yet, I would contend, this is not how Milton understood the images of God contained in the Bible. In Chapter II of De Doctrina Christiana, entitled "Of God," Milton explored the question of accommodation and drew far differing conclusions which isolated him from a lengthy theo- logical tradition. The fact that this chapter is conversational in tone rather than dialectical, and seemingly confused and contradictory, is perhaps the reason why Milton critics have failed to form a coherent interpretation and to comprehend that this is yet another theological subject expounded in De Doctrina which suggests that Milton is a sin- gularly original thinker.' I will argue that Milton envisages a synecdo- chic theory of scriptural accommodation which diverges from the tra- ditional theory in four essential principles. The orthodox metaphorical relationship between the subject God, and pictures of him, is rejected in favor of a synecdochic theory, which claims that the image embodies the truth-but not the whole truth-and nothing but the truth of God himself. As I shall show, Milton's radical point seems to be that the bib- lical language used to describe man means the same thing when it de- scribes God; the pictures of God which Milton discusses in his treatise seem at first merely to be symbols for what cannot be expressed, until one realises that Milton intended these images to be taken seriously. In short, the substitution of synecdoche for metaphor as an hermeneutic strategy changes the way in which Milton interpreted the truths of the Bible. The tradition from which Milton departed is surprisingly homoge- neous. From the early Church Fathers Origen and Augustine (despite 1 I do not intend to add to the current debate concerning the provenance of De Doctrina at this time. William B. Hunter's most recent publication, Visitation Unimplor'd: Milton and the Authorship of "De Doctrina Christiana" (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1998) merely suggests circumstantial evidence to refute the latest thoughtful submission by Gordon Campbell and Thomas Corns, et al., in Miltotn Quarterly 31.3 (1997): 67-117.

In Contra Celsum-probably the greatest of all early Christian apologies-Origen discusses the ques- tion of divine accommodation, arguing that "the language of Scripture regarding God is adopted to an anthropopathic point of view" and con- cludes that "the word of God appears to have dealt with the history, making the capacity of the hearers, and the benefit which they were to receive, the standard of the appropriateness of its announcements [re- garding him]."3 Origen characterizes such accommodation as "baby- talk"-a metaphor which was to become a favorite of Calvin's-and this analogy of condescension became the standard interpretation of God's inscription of himself in Scripture: ". . . as we ourselves, when talking with very young children, do not aim at exerting our own power of eloquence, but, adopt ourselves to the weakness of our charge."4 Au- gustine concurred with Origen that "the Divine Being is beyond words and cannot be spoken of in any way without recourse to expressions of time and place";5 and he similarly argues that although the Scrip- tures by necessity communicate through anthropo-morphic/-pathetic images, it is essential for the exegete to distinguish between the literal image and the meaning which that image denotes: "Now, in order to try, as far as we can with God's help, to grasp this truth with our intel- lect, we must first drive from our minds all anthropomorphic concepts that men might have."6 The conclusion which Augustine draws during his meticulous and painstaking interpretation of the "literal" meaning of Genesis is the basis for all subsequent interpretations of the biblical deity-that God is accommodated in language through metaphor: Now to think of God as forming man from the slime of the earth with bodily hands is childish. Indeed, if Scripture had said such a thing, we should be com- 2 See Erich Auerbach, "Figura," in Scenes from the Drama of European Literature, trans.

The depictions of God were a form of baby-talk of the Creator himself which thereby safeguarded the essential veracity of the biblical text, yet as anthropomorphic meta- phors they were imperfectly suggestive of the far greater reality which could not be codified within language. According to one modern critic, "in Calvin's theology the principle of accommodation is his most widely used exegetical tool."8 Certainly Calvin habitually stressed God's condescension of divine attributes and objects, and placed em- phasis upon his willingness to accommodate his transcendent truths, whereas Luther chose to dwell upon another aspect of accommoda- tion-the childlike faculties of man and his intellectual incapacity to comprehend the Almighty. To Luther, the accommodation of Scripture was essential for God's revelation of himself: "If he should speak to me in his majesty, I would run away-just as the Jews did. However, when he is clothed in the voice of a man and accommodates himself to our capacity to understand, I can approach him."9 Appropriately, it is in Calvin's chapter on the Trinity in the Institutes that the locus classicus of accommodation appears: For who, even of the meanest capacity, understands not, that God lisps, as it were, with us, just as nurses are accustomed to speak to infants? Where- fore, such forms of expression [i.e., anthropomorphisms] do not clearly explain the nature of God, but accommodate the knowledge of him to our narrow ca- pacity; to accomplish which, the Scripture must necessarily descend far below the height of his majesty.10 It was within this homogeneous tradition that Milton was situated by critics from the eighteenth century to today. Since the publication of Paradise Lost in 1667 it would be fair to say that the critical apprecia- tion of the depiction of God in the poem is directly commensurate with the reader's knowledge of the theory of accommodation. Historically this can be divided into three stages, although the first and second stub- 7 De Genesi, 1: 6.12.20. 8 H.

The majority of the critics who attack Milton's depiction of God-and these include critics as far apart as Dr. Johnson who seemed blissfully unaware of ac- commodation, and those New Critics such as John Peter and A. J. A. Waldock-do so because they do not understand what Milton was at- tempting to achieve with his portrayal.1' This is explained by a com- prehension of accommodation. The second stage is comprised of the vast majority of critics, who being aware of the theological problems of accommodation and their implications for a poet depicting scriptural material, attribute to Milton a traditional understanding and applica- tion of the theory. This has been the standard interpretation from Joseph Addison through to C. A. Patrides and still persists today.12 Finally, and headed by Hugh R. MacCallum's important study "Milton and Figura- tive Interpretation of the Bible" in 1961, critics have started to realize that Milton did not adhere to the traditional conception of the theory as developed by theologians, but that this was yet another subject about which Milton insisted upon developing his own idiosyncratic line of thought.'3 However, hitherto they have been unable to present any form 11 See, among others, Samuel Johnson, "The Life of Milton," in Lives of the English Poets, ed.

II The correct appraisal of the depiction of God in the Scriptures was deemed by Milton to be of literally vital significance: "Why does our imagination shy away from a notion of God which he himself does not hesitate to promulgate in unambiguous terms? For God in his good- ness has revealed to us in ample quantity those things which we need to understand about him for our salvation" (CPW6.136).'4 There is a refer- ence here to the popular Protestant belief- to which Milton subscribed -that any point of doctrine or article of faith which was essential for salvation was expressed clearly and unambiguously in the Scriptures. It became necessary to cling to this principle-at least for those Protes- tants who believed in the inerrancy and sanctified status of the Scrip- tures-for by the time of the Renaissance the biblical scholarship of Erasmus, Beza, and others had revealed that there were many textual corruptions and problems of translation, as well as hermeneutical diffi- culties in the Bible.'5 Even Milton, a fervent biblical fundamentalist, be- came aware that the biblical text was corrupt, especially the New Testa- ment.16 However, he also clung to the tenet that "when God wants us to Kathleen Swain, "The Mimesis of Accommodation in Book III of Paradise Lost," Philologi- cal Quarterly 63 (1984): 461-75; Robert L.

Yet no transla- tioni is authentical, but that which agreeth with the Original fountains of the Hebrew and Greek" (9). Milton agreed with Wollebius (CPW 6.589), but was also aware that even the original texts were not without errors, corruptions, and canonical questions. Cf.

Chapter II of De Doctrina represents Milton's most comprehensive discussion of accommodation found anywhere in his prose. In this chapter Milton is clear from the outset that the aim of the inquiry is to "form correct ideas about God," and that in this en- deavor one cannot be "guided by nature or reason alone, without the word or message of God" (132). At first sight the passage seems to ap- proach the question of the nature of accommodation in an identical fashion to that followed in mainstream Augustinian and Renaissance theories, although it is noteworthy that unlike most of his predeces- sors Milton at no point apologizes for the anthropomorphic pictures of God in the Old Testament. Milton begins by reiterating the perspective which was Luther's basic accommodatory premise-an emphasis upon man's childlike faculties: "When we talk about knowing God, it must be understood in terms of man's limited powers of comprehension. God as he really is, is far beyond man's imagination, let alone his understand- ing" (133). Milton then notes on the same page that God "has brought himself down to our level," thereby 'bringing himself within the limits of our understanding," which is a restatement of Calvin's axiomatic be- lief in God's condescension to man. However, after the reiteration of these accommodatory commonplaces, Milton's theory takes a number of startling and innovatory twists. This paper explores four enormously important differences in Milton's theory of scriptural accommodation. Milton's first idiosyncratic principle is that the accommodated image -the picture of God which the Scriptures present to the reader- should be the locus of our understanding. This is in fact collating two separate points: first, that the textual image, and not the transcendent subject, is the locus of our attention; and second, that this image is the literal configuration presented in the text of Scripture. The central premise of traditional accommodation proposed that as God could be textually represented only in a crude manner, this image was merely a condescending fiction, or suggestive metaphor, for the real apprehen- sion of God, which was not constrained within the medium of language. 17 A similar passage from Of Reformation (i641)-CPW 1.566 -proves that Milton held this tenet throughout his writing career.</page><page sequence="8">258 Milton and the Theory of Accommodation As such, the focus of attention was the concept of God behind the veil and not the accommodated image which was the vehicle of communi- cation. Thus in his commentary on Genesis Luther boldly states: "When God reveals himself to us, it is necessary for Him to do so through some such veil or wrapper and to say: 'Look! Under this wrapper you will be sure to take hold of Me.""8 However, in Milton's thinking, the accom- modated image itself is the locus of comprehension: It is safest for us to form an image of God in our minds which corresponds to his representation and description of himself in the sacred writings. Admittedly, God is always described or outlined not as he really is but in such a way as will make him conceivable to us. Nevertheless, we ought to form just such a mental image of him as he, in bringing himself within the limits of our understanding, wishes us to form. (CPW6.133) This is precisely the result which the traditional theory of accommo- dation was designed to refute: a concentration on the image instead of the reality. The history of the Israelites in the Pentateuch is one of the acceptance of idolatrous images instead of God himself-the tran- scendent Deity-and the punishment which followed the worship of an anthropomorphized image which was deemed to be literally true.'9 In a similar way traditional accommodation shifted the focus of compre- hension from the pictorial image to the insubstantial subject in order to avoid the error of failing to see the wood for the trees, which ultimately is that of idolatry -the worship of a corporealized image. Milton, how- ever, accepts the initial premise that the image of God is different from the reality of his being, but nevertheless maintains that it is the pic- ture of God which the Scriptures present that should be the locus of our understanding, in order "to prevent our being carried beyond the reach of human comprehension, and outside the written authority of Scripture, into vague subtleties of speculation" (133-34). Accordingly the hermeneutic subject is what Milton describes in the original Latin as "nos capere possumus" (Columbia 14.30)-that which is conceivable- which in turn is the picture of God imprinted on the mind by God's 18 Luther, Lectures on Genesis, in Luther's Works, vol. i: Lectures on Genesis, chap. 1-5, ed. Jaroslav Pelikan (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1958), 42.12. 19 Cf. Christopher Hill, The English Bible and the Seventeenth-Century Revolution (London: Allen Lane, 1993), 255: "It is impossible to over-emphasize the importance given in the Old Testament to rejection of idolatry. God's covenant with the Israelites insisted on an end to idol worship (Lev. 10: 1-3, Deut. 29). The Geneva Bible thus explained the flight of the Israelites from Egypt: 'Because Egypt was full of idolatry, God would appoint those places where they should serve him purely' (Exod. 3: 18)."</page><page sequence="9">Neil D. Graves 259 revelation of himself in the scriptural text. Milton's Latin conveys far more graphically God's inscription of himself in the text than does John Carey's English translation, which fails to render the idea that God speaks ("dicere") about himself and becomes accessible through lan- guage- "quo id auctore dicimus, quod Deus non dicit" (Columbia 14.36; literally, "by what authority do we say what God does not say"). This is translated by Carey in the more abstract lexis as "on what authority do we contradict God?" (CPW 6.136). An essential component of this principle was Milton's unshakable belief in the Scriptures as the text in which God authorizes his own presentation. The Protestant view of the Scriptures as divinely inspired is integral to Milton's trust of God's self-inscription and his inerrant record in the Bible. As such, "Milton's hermeneutics is a hermeneutics of intentionality."20 Milton's second major divergence lies in his consideration of the rela- tionship between the image of God and God himself. This is the funda- mental heart of Milton's idiosyncratic theory. Conventionally, the cor- porealized pictures of God were believed to bear little or no literal relation to the true subject itself, and any connection between the two was adjudged to be metaphorical, so that, for example, the arm of God represented his omnipotent power. Aquinas provides a typical example of this kind of accommodatory exegesis: "When Scripture speaks of the arm of God, the literal sense is not that he has a physical limb, but that he has what it signifies, namely the power of doing and making.""2 How- ever, Milton suggests-and the point is a difficult one to state categori- cally but seems to be asserted in a number of passages in this second chapter-that considering the locus of Milton's accommodation upon the textual image, this image is indeed a veridical presentation of the subject, although it does not contain the whole truth of the subject. The epistemological function of Milton's theory is to close, or at least to re- duce, the traditional chasm between sign and referent, and this is at- tempted by an acceptance of the scriptural depiction of God as a true although incomplete representation of the transcendent deity. This calls to mind the legal rubric which seeks to secure the communication of truth: Milton's accommodation proposes to tell the truth, but not the 20 Michael Lieb, "Reading God: Milton and the Anthropopathetic Tradition," Milton Studies 25 (1989): 213-43, quotation from 224.

In this way the primary aim of Milton's theory is to understand accommodation as a (partially) veridi- cal exercise in representation, rather than as an exercise in what has re- cently been called "metafiction": "The discourse of accommodation is thus, if you like, a kind of metafiction; although it signifies the transcen- dent being of whom it is a self-representation, its insistent subtext is the chasm which necessitates this bridging discourse, and which makes it fictive." 22 The chief characteristic of this second principle is that Milton does not perceive the biblical image to be a metaphor, but a synecdoche. This proposition demands a considerable degree of evidence. Indeed, recently one critic even suggested this idea as a possible solution to the problem of accommodation, although he doubted its formulation in Milton's thinking: "A solution might have been to suggest that the 'ac- commodated picture' is a part but not the whole of the truth, but Milton does not clearly adopt it." 23 This theory is in part an attempted solution to the epistemological dilemma faced by Calvin. Like Milton, Calvin believed that the scriptural presentation of God should be accepted as the picture of himself which God wished people to perceive, but un- like Milton he insistently maintained in accordance with all the tradi- tional thinking on accommodation that "there is no need for the reality to agree at all points with the symbol, if only it suit sufficiently for the purpose of symbolizing."24 Thus according to typical Renaissance ac- commodation, the picture of God is such that "he is shown to us not as he is in himself, but as he is toward us: so that this recognition of him consists more in living experience than in vain and high-flown specu- lation."25 Hence there was no veridical relationship between sign and referent; the function of the symbolic connection is merely to encour- age the individual to move successfully from the apprehension of the picture to an understanding of the real subject. This, after all, was the whole raison d'etre of accommodation in the first place. However, as is obvious, the problem of such a theory is the nature of this symbolic relationship between a fictional sign and a transcendental subject. Milton's theory of biblical accommodation seems to face up to this 22 Michael H. Keefer, "Accommodation and Synecdoche: Calvin's God in King Lear," Shakespeare Studies 20 (1987): 149. 23 A. D.

The picture is not merely a symbol for God, and hence subject to all the epistemological problems I have just considered, but it is truly a depiction of God, albeit one which is necessarily partial and incomplete. Thus in Chapter II of De Doctrina, and in between the passages already quoted with reference to Milton's Lutheran and Calvinist definitions of the man/God relation- ship, he states: God has revealed only so much of himself as our minds can conceive and the weakness of our nature can bear: Exod. Xxxiii. 20, 23: no one can see me and live: but you will see my back parts; Isa. vi. 1: I saw the Lord sitting on a throne which was raised high in the air, and the fringe of his garment spread over the whole of the temple; John I. 18: no man has ever seen God, and vi. 46: not that anyone has seen the Father, except him who is from God; he has seen the Father, and v. 37: nor have you heard his voice; I Cor. xiii. 12: in a mirror, in a riddle, partially. (CPW 6.133) This passage functions in a typically Miltonic way: an initial authorial statement is illustrated and reinforced by a number of underpinning scriptural quotations. In the first line Milton states what initially seems like the amalgam of the Lutheran/Calvinist position which I noted above-the childlike faculties of man and the condescension of God to it -but it suggests more than this. It states that God has actually revealed himself, although incompletely, and not that he has revealed merely a symbol for himself. Now while this interpretation seems to be valid, yet other interpretations offering a far more conventional accommodative perspective could also be drawn from this statement, but yet the former reading seems to be backed up by the appended scriptural excerpts. Importantly, these quotations essentially form the three parts of a pseudosyllogistic form of reasoning: Major Premise-No man can see God (Command); Minor Premise-Man has seen God (Experience); Conclusion-Man both does and does not see God, i.e., Man sees God either partially or merely parts of God. In these instances of Scripture the whole problem of theoretical accommodation is illustrated. It is an a priori fact that mortal man cannot perceive the immortal God, and yet it is an a posteriori fact that man has perceived God. Concomitantly, an image of God is not God, but yet it is the divinely sanctioned experience of God given to man by God, which still leaves one with the dilemma of the nature of the relationship between the image and the subject, be- tween seeing God and not seeing God. The quotations from Exodus and Isaiah offer the two possible conclusions when explicated by the exe- getical key provided in the first letter to the Corinthians, in a mirror, in</page><page sequence="12">262 Milton and the Theory of Accommodation a riddle, partially: only a part of God is seen in Exodus, and God is seen partially and reflectively in Isaiah. In this way the image of God is not totally differentiated from the reality of the subject, but the image partakes to a certain degree in the true appearance of God. In Chapter VII of De Doctrina the passage from Exodus which Milton quotes here-you will see my back parts-is dis- cussed in greater detail as Milton attempts to understand what such an unusual phrase can possibly mean: We cannot imagine light without some source of light, but we do not therefore think that a source of light is the same thing as light, or equal in excellence. Similarly, we do not consider that what are called the back parts of God in Exod. xxxiii, are, strictly speaking, God, yet we do not deny that they are eternal. (CPW 6.312) Once again, at a glance this explanation of the phrase from Exodus seems to suggest that the image of God viewed by Moses was not "strictly speaking, God," but it becomes clear that Moses is, indeed, to some extent at least perceiving God, for in Milton's theology God alone is eternal. The back parts themselves are not an accommodated image which bears no direct congruence to the personage of God, but instead are a partially perceived aspect of God's being itself and as an existent substance are thus accorded the predicate "eternal." It is in this way that the scriptural image tells the truth -although not the whole truth- and nothing but the truth. This becomes clearer when contrasted to other, and more typical, theological discussions of the accommodation of God's "back parts." In William Ames' The Marrow of Sacred Divinity (1642)-a systematic theological treatise which is an acknowledged in- fluence on Milton's De Doctrina26 -the same passage from Exodus con- cerning the back parts of God is quoted, coupled together with the same passage from Corinthians, yet Ames clearly explains that the reference is an anthropomorphic accommodation to man's limited understand- ing. Ames' consideration lacks any suggestion that the back parts them- selves are eternal, instead cosseting the reference within wholly ortho- dox accommodatory principles: 26 See Helen Darbishire, ed., The Early Lives of Milton (London: Constable and Co., 1932), 61, and Maurice Kelley's introduction in CPW 6.17-21; the De Doctrina Christiana cites Ames as "Amesius Noster" (II.vii), and discusses a passage from Ames' Marrow (Colum- bia 17.172; CPW 6.706); see also Maurice Kelley, "The Composition of Milton's De Doc- trina Christiana: First Phase," in Th'Upright Heart and Pure, ed.

Because also they are explained after our measure, to mans capacity, hence many things are spoken of God according to the way of our conceiving, rather then from his Nature.27 Milton's solution both to the exegetical question of reconciling seem- ingly contradictory texts and to the wider problem of the relationship between textual image and transcendent subject is not completely new. An interesting precedent occurs in the writing of the fifth-century theo- logian Epiphanius. That Milton had read Epiphanius' work against the Heretics, Adversus Haereses - a text included in his Panarion - is evident from a passage in Milton's Tetrachordon in which he holds Epiphanius' opinion in high regard?' In his Panarion Epiphanius considers the same biblical texts which troubled Milton, while considering the same ques- tions of theoretical accommodation, although his final conclusions on accommodation are very different from Milton's because he is orthodox in his placement of the locus of comprehension in the subject and not the image. Epiphanius attempts to explain how the Scriptures are non-contra- dictory in their claim that man cannot see God, and yet there are numer- ous Old Testament passages in which prophets have directly beheld the Creator.29 They are reconciled by creating a via media between the two statements, such that it is true that one both sees God in his person and does not see him in his person. This is possible because God accommo- dates his transcendent reality to a form that can be comprehended by man, and thus man does perceive God, but not in his incomprehensible fullness. Epiphanius explores this notion with two analogies: first, the man who perceives the ocean, but who, by only surveying a portion of it and failing to perceive it in its entirety, can thus be said to both see and not see the ocean; second, the man who sees the sky: 27 William Ames, The Marrow of Sacred Divinity, Drawne out of the Holy Scriptures, and the Interpreters thereof, and brought into Method (London, 1642), 10. 28 CPW 2.697. 29 Cf.

But if someone replies, "You haven't seen it," he isn't lying either. &lt;No&gt; human being can know its full breadth, its full length, its depth, where the innermost chambers of the deep are, and the fur- thest bounds of the deep. Now if our knowledge of created things is as limited as this, how much more so with the grace God has granted the prophets and apostles? They truly saw God, and yet did not see him. They saw as far as their natures could bear.... It is as though one saw the sky through a very small hole and said, "I see the sky." He would not be lying; he really sees the sky. But someone might wisely tell him, "You haven't seen the sky," and he would not be lying.... For the man didn't see its extent and breadth.30 The form of accommodated metaphor for God's being is therefore syn- ecdochic: the part is representative of the whole. Thus according to Epi- phanius these two scriptural assertions are reconciled by a double ac- commodation: first, God's incomprehensible reality is reduced so that he can be perceived by mortal man; and second, man's limited faculties are raised up so that he approaches nearer God's transcendent reality. In this way accommodation functions from both ends of the spectrum to facilitate a medial reconciliation: First and foremost, it is not possible for a human being to see God, and the visible cannot see the invisible. But the invisible God has accomplished the im- possible by his lovingkindness and power, and by his might has rendered some worthy of seeing the invisible. And the one who &lt;saw&gt; him saw the invisible and infinite, not as the infinite was, but as the nature of one who had no power to see him could bear when empowered to the fullest.31 This understanding of Milton's second principle demands that we take another look at a number of seemingly orthodox accommodatory statements in De Doctrina. In a passage from Chapter II quoted above, what initially appeared as a standard statement of accommodation is now invested with a more specific meaning: "God is always described or outlined not as he really is but in such a way as will make him con- ceivable to us" (133). Whereas this statement appears initially to sug- gest that there is no intrinsic relationship between image and subject, it seems to mean, in the light of the Epiphanius passage cited above, that while God is not described in his fullness-an impossibility -he is yet 30 Epiphanius, The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis, trans.

Graves 265 pictured partially so that man is able to conceptualize the image. Thus the relationship between image and subject is synecdochic rather than metaphorical: the part represents the whole, rather than one thing being described in terms of another thing,2 or what Karsten Harries has called an "improper naming."33 This hermeneutic connection between the theological principle of ac- commodation and the grammatical figure synecdoche is not without precedent either in the theology of Milton's near contemporaries or in modern critical textual analysis. John Calvin-and I quote him in the 1578 translation by Thomas Tymme which Milton most certainly would have read -similarly cites the use of synecdoche as an explanatory tool for the interpretation of the book of Genesis: Because the image of God is razed out in us by the fall of Adam: we may iudge what it was by the restoring of the same againe. Paule saith that, We are through the Gospell transfigured into the image of God. And according to his mean- ing, spirituall regeneration is nothing else, but a repairing of the same image. And whereas he placed the same in righteousnesse and true holinesse, it is by 32 In the Artis Logicae Milton discusses the different properties and behavior of synec- doche and metaphor-CPW 8. 337, 285-and interestingly he appends a reminder to the reader concerning the nature of the similarity of metaphor and analogy (284-85). I use synecdoche in this argument as a specific form of analogy, as distinct from a form of meta- phor. In this way I distinguish between what Michel Foucault in Les Mots and Les Choses (The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences [London: Tavistock Publications, 1970]) terms the "resemblance" character of analogy and the "difference and identity" character of metaphor. Cf. Sally McFague's debt to F. W. Dillistone's "distinction between analogical and metaphorical thinking [in Dillistone's Christianity and Symbolism (London: Collins, 1955)]. Of analogy he writes: 'In any organic system the single member is related to the whole according to some pattern of order and proportion; no figure of speech is more fitted to express this relation than analogy.' He notes that one can move from the known to the unknown because the part participates in the whole and is similar to it. Ana- logical thought is positive, comprehensive, and systematic. Analogy has links with the simile [and, I argue, even more so with synecdoche], metaphor with the contrast. Meta- phor focuses attention on variety and the openness of reality, and on dissimilarity rather than similarity." McFague, Metaphorical Theology: Models of God in Religious Language (Lon- don: S.C.M.P., 1983),17. 33 The study of religious language has long addressed the problems of the epistemol- ogy of metaphor. The nature of metaphor intrinsically raises questions concerning the veridical nature of discourse, and therefore of ontology (what exists, and what is only de- scription) and epistemology (how one differentiates between what is true and what is not): "Ever since Aristotle, metaphor has been placed in the context of a mimetic theory of language and of art. Metaphors are in some sense about reality. The poet uses meta- phor to help reveal what is. He, too, serves the truth, even if his service is essentially lack- ing in that 'metaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else.' (Poetics, Aristotle). Thus it is an improper naming." Karsten Harries, "Metaphor and Tran- scendence," in On Metaphor, ed. Sheldon Sacks (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1979), 72.</page><page sequence="16">266 Milton and the Theory of Accommodation a figure called Synecdoche, when parte is put for the whole. For although this be the principal part, yet notwithstanding it is not the whole.34 More recently, in "Accommodation and Synecdoche: Calvin's God in King Lear," Michael Keefer argues that Lear's dispensation of grace and favor is a synecdochic parody of Calvinist predestination and grace, fol- lowing Stephen Booth's suggestion that there is a "dimness of distinc- tion between Lear and God" at certain points of the play. Keefer argues that the Calvinist God is a persuasive presence in Shakespeare's play, that "by a species of synecdoche it is Lear himself who makes us aware of this presence, and that the play incorporates a sustained dramatic meditation upon what Calvin called 'accommodation,' the process by which a wholly unintelligible and incomprehensible deity represents himself, in human terms, to mankind."35 This second idiosyncratic principle is emphatically supported in the next paragraph of De Doctrina by Milton's consideration of instances of God's passibility in the Old Testament. Milton is adamant that "we ought not to imagine that God would have said anything or caused any- thing to be written about himself unless he intended that it should be a part of our conception of him" (134). Hence Milton faces head-on those many instances -particularly from the overtly anthropomorphic Pen- tateuch -of a passible Deity-' Traditionally these passages were rather embarrassing to theologians, who would attempt to explain them away along with the more blatant corporeal references to God as merely in- stances of divine condescension to the uneducated reader, or simply as 34 Calvin, A Commentarie of John Caluine, upon the first booke of Moses called Genesis: Trans- lated out of Latine into English, by Thomas Tymme (London, 1578), 44.

For more general perspectives upon the function of synecdoche and theology see Janet Martin, "Metaphor amongst Tropes," Religious Studies 17 (1981): 55-66. 36 There is considerable instability of textual occurrence of anthropomorphism in the Hebrew Pentateuch due to what appears to be a deliberate policy of exclusion by para- phrase in some of the manuscripts, although it is noteworthy that anthropomorphisms nevertheless appear in all five of the books. Similarly, in the translation of the Septuagint by Alexandrian scholars the "tendency to avoid the ascription of human form and feel- ing to God could not be consistently carried out."

Graves 267 linguistic shorthand for complex metaphysical theories of God's subsis- tence.37 However, to Milton with his firm beliefs in the literal suitability of such descriptions as appropriate to God, an explanation of God's bib- lical passibility was essential. Most famously, Aquinas had presented a theory in De Veritate, XXV-XXVI, Summa contra Gentiles, I 89-91, and Summa Theologica, Ia 75-82, IaIIae 22-48, that God cannot be passible, as passibility necessarily entails corporeality, and it was simply ludicrous to conceive of a corporealized Deity. By contrast, however, it seems that Milton entertained the idea of some form of divine materiality and cer- tainly vehemently defended the notion of divine passibility: If Jehovah repented that he had created man, Gen. vi. 6, and repented because of their groanings, Judges ii. 18, let us believe that he did repent. But let us not imagine that God's repentance arises from lack of foresight, as man's does, for he has warned us not to think about him in this way: Num. xxiii. 19: God is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent. The same point is made in I Sam. xv. 29. If he grieved in his heart Gen. vi. 6, and if, similarly, his soul was grieved, Judges x, i6, let us believe that he did feel grief. For those states of mind which are good in a good man, and count as virtues, are holy in God. If it is said that God, after working for six days, rested and was refreshed, Exod. xxxi. 17, and if he feared his enemy's displeasure, Deut. xxxii. 27, let us believe that it is not be- neath God to feel what grief he does feel, to be refreshed by what refreshes him, and to fear what he does fear. For however you may try to tone down these and similar texts about God by an elaborate show of interpretative glosses, it comes to the same thing in the end. (CPW 6.134-35) This passage makes clearer the import of the second principle, while also illustrating the third: the scriptural depiction of God is not an- thropopathetic, for anthropopatheia does not exist in the Scriptures. In the passage above, the biblical descriptions of God's passibility are not examples of anthropopatheia in the normal sense, for Milton is quite clear that "In my opinion, then, theologians do not need to employ an- thropopathy, or the ascription of human feelings to God" (134). These examples of God's passibility are not the attribution of human terms to describe God, and thus a traditional form of accommodation, but "that is the way in which he has offered himself to our contemplation" (ibid.), for such passible terms can be predicated of God by the Scrip- tures just as they are to man.' God is as passible, it seems, as man, albeit 37 See, for example, Luther, Lectures on Genesis, 62. io. The central problem with the con- ception of a passible God was that passibility entailed changeability, which was of course contradictory to God's supposed immutability. Cf. Ames, Marrow, 12, 16. 38 Cf. Calvin, A Commentarie upon Genesis, by Thomas Tymme, 176: "And he bringeth</page><page sequence="18">268 Milton and the Theory of Accommodation that his passibility is untinged by the negative-and therewith the post- lapsarian- which infuses these emotions when experienced by man.39 Milton is thus absolutely clear in his rejection of traditional accommo- dation in the question of the exegesis of Old Testament instances of passibility. On the other hand, he is explicit and articulate in defending the position that passibility is not an exclusively mortal experience, but one which is essentially identical while qualitatively dissimilar to that experienced by God. It is particularly instructive to compare Milton's rejection of anthro- popatheia with the treatment of this question in Ames' contemporane- ous The Marrow of Sacred Divinity. Ames gives a standard definition of anthropopatheia - "[a] figure that attributes those things to God which be proper to men, as in humane affections senses or members"-a defi- nition with which Milton concurs.' However, Ames argues that anthro- popatheia is the mode of God's description in the Scriptures and the result of the process of accommodation -something Milton expressly denies. The key difference between them concerns their opposing views upon the relationship between the image and the subject-the question to which Milton's second divergent principle refers. Ames is in agree- ment with Milton that when God does exhibit similar attributes to man, he does so in a perfected and purified manner.4" However, while agree- ing with Milton that such attributes belong primarily to God as he is the Creator, and secondarily to man as his creature, Ames asserts, un- like Milton, that the Scriptures actually attribute certain characteristics to God because of the similarity of those characteristics to the corre- sponding characteristics found in mankind. In this way Ames estab- lishes a contrast between ontology and epistemology: all things come from God and have their root cause and thus owe their being to the Cre- ator, despite the fact that we possess knowledge of these things empiri- in God speaking after the manner of men, by a figure called Anthropopatheia: because otherwise he could not expresse that which was necessarie to be knowen: namely, that God was not for any light cause, nor readily moved to destroy the worlde," with the mar- ginal note, "Anthropopatheia is a figure by whiche humane affections are attributed to God for our capacitie, at which time those thinges which belong to him are to us incom- prehensible." 3" This idea of an imperfect linguistic analogy between terms predicated of God and the same term predicated of man is not new to Milton, but has an interpretation dating back at least to Augustine's De Patientia. See Seventeen Short Treatises of S. Augustine, The Library of the Fathers 22 (Oxford, 1847), 543-44. See also John K. Mozley, 7he Impassibility of God: A Survey of Christian Thought (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1926). 40 Ames, Marrow, io. 41 Ames, MarroW, 12.</page><page sequence="19">Neil D. Graves 269 cally from our comprehension of them as human attributes and then predicate them analogously to God: "those attributes which are in a sort common to God with the Creatures, doe in their substance belong to God in the first place, to the Creatures secondarily: although the names are transferred from the Creatures to God, and so doe first agree to the Creatures."' However, as I noted above, in Milton's thinking on God the ontological and the epistemological are not opposed but comple- mentary; as such God is genuinely passible as is expressed throughout the Pentateuch in particular, and the attributes which are predicated of him in the Scriptures are not human terms which are analogously de- scribing God, but terms which just as precisely describe God himself. To return to the De Doctrina text quoted above, this passage is also en- lightening on two other counts. First, in the way in which it exegetically manipulates Scripture; and second, in its disapproval of the exegeti- cal manipulation of Scripture. After producing quotations from Gene- sis and Judges to support the view that God is passible and stressing to the reader that the words are used in their normal context (i.e., when such terms are predicated of man), Milton quotes from Numbers. He does so to give scriptural sanction to the statement he has just made that God's passibility is not subject to the same pollution by negative influences as man's is, for this would be to interpret Scripture anthro- popathetically.43 The quotation is from Numbers 23: 19, and states that "God is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent." As can be seen, in another context this line would seem to ex- plode Milton's concept of God's passibility or at least that God experi- enced emotions in any way similar to those of man. But Milton employs the quotation not to reject God's repentance, which he cannot do with- out damaging his belief in the non-contradictory status of Scripture, but to underline his point that God's passibility is not infused with nega- tive sensibility as man's is. Hence Milton has taken a potentially prob- lematic text, one which seems to refute the very passibility that he is 42Ibid. 43"This is a rhetorical device thought up by grammarians to explain the nonsense poets write about Jove. Sufficient care has been taken, without any doubt, to ensure that the holy scriptures contain nothing unfitting to God or unworthy of him. This applies equally to those passages in scripture where God speaks about his own nature" (CPW 6.134). See Stanley Fish, "Wanting a Supplement," in Politics, Poetics, and Hermeneutics in Milton's Prose, ed. David Loewenstein and James Grantham Turner (Cambridge: Cam- bridge University Press, 9ggo) for a brilliant post-structuralist critique of Milton's herme- neutical practice of "start[ingl with a conviction that his God is of a certain temper and inclination, and therefore he knows in advance of the appearance of any of his particular words what they must mean" (57).</page><page sequence="20">270 Milton and the Theory of Accommodation endorsing, and has incorporated it into his argument. However, Milton closes this discussion with the statement that the Scriptures should be interpreted literally (although this is highly complex and problematic in itself; Augustine alone made three exhaustive attempts at a literal in- terpretation of Genesis), and not with "an elaborate show of interpreta- tive glosses," leaving the suggestion that critics who employ traditional accommodation are missing the point and explaining away the truth." The unintended irony is, of course, that to some degree at least, Milton himself seems to have explained away the primary meaning of the text from Numbers immediately before this. The fourth divergent principle in Milton's theory of biblical accom- modation is the rejection of anthropomorphism. For reasons identical to those I have just considered in connection with anthropopatheia, Milton's axiomatic belief in God's unrestricted endorsement of his own depiction in the Scriptures precludes us from categorizing these images as anthropomorphic, for God created man and not vice versa.45 Anthro- pomorphism is described in the OED as the "Ascription of a human form and attributes to the Deity," and supplemented by the definition, "In language: The use of language applicable to men in speaking of God." Hence anthropomorphism, like anthropopatheia, is the stock metaphor of the traditional theory of accommodation, whereby the in- comprehensible is communicated by means of human empirical data.' Milton rejects such a perception of God, but there would appear to be a paradox here, for Milton endorses the belief in a passible God who is not anthropopathetic and ascribes some form of corporeality to God who is not anthropomorphic. As I have considered in the light of Milton's views on anthropopatheia, the paradox is only apparent and not real because of the first two divergent principles of accommodation which I outlined above. Milton vehemently defends the image of God depicted in the Scriptures as fully endorsed by God and asserts that this tex- tual image should be the locus of our comprehension, for it partially although imperfectly partakes in the true manifestation of the perfect 44 CPW 6.58i; cf. Augustine, De Genesi contra Manichaeos libri duo, c. 388 A.D.; De Genesi ad litteram imperfectus liber, c. 391 A.D.; De Genesi Ad Litteram libri duodecim, begun 401 A.D. 45 As can be seen from an attack in An Apology Against A Pamphlet (April, 1642; CPW 1.915) upon the crude materialistic depiction of heaven in Joseph Hall's Satires, Milton was consistent throughout his writing career in his contempt of the anthropomorphic de- piction of the divine. 46 For information on anthropomorphic artistic representations of God see Roland Mushat Frye, Milton's Imagery and the Visual Arts: Iconographic Tradition in the Epic Poems (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978).</page><page sequence="21">Neil D. Graves 271 reality, thereby communicating the truth, but not the whole truth, of God himself. Milton arrives at this position by considering the famous line from Genesis concerning the creation of man in God's image-a text which a large number of theologians had to struggle with. He makes his prin- cipal point, that of God's corporeality, by his hermeneutical method of close linguistic comparison (in this case of diction and syntax) of com- parative texts:47 After all, if God is said to have created man in his own image, after his own likeness, Gen. i. 26, and not only his mind but also his external appearance (unless the same words mean something different when they are used again in Gen. v. 3: Adam begot his son after his own likeness, in his own image), and if God attributes to himself again and again a human shape and form, why should we be afraid of assigning to him something he assigns to himself, provided we believe that what is imperfect and weak in us is, when ascribed to God, utterly perfect and utterly beautiful? (CPW 6.135-36) This passage argues unequivocally that God is to some degree corpo- real and possesses some form of body, "his external appearance," and that this is not an instance of metaphorical accommodation or anthro- pomorphism, but instead is an example of theomorphism. Theomorph- ism is defined in the OED as "The doctrine that man has the form and likeness of God,"' and this concept, supported additionally by Milton's belief in the literal revelatory truth of Scripture, asserts the primacy of God over created beings and thereby the relationship between God and man: man's corporeal form partakes of the "external appearance" of God. Thus Milton's theory of scriptural accommodation manifests four very important principles which vitally differentiate it from the tradi- tional, relatively homogeneous, Renaissance conception of accommo- dation. The first two principles are the bedrock of Milton's idiosyn- cratic formulation, and from them the rejection of anthropopatheia and anthropomorphism is necessarily entailed. At some points in Chapter II of De Doctrina Milton seems to contradict himself or at least to con- fuse the issues by failing to make a consistent stand in one theoretical "camp" or another. Hence, early in the chapter Milton states that "God is 47 Milton was very aware of the need for linguistic skills in biblical hermeneutics: "At- tention should be paid to all these points to prevent anyone from being led astray by lin- guistic ignorance" (CPW 6.236); see also CPW 6.582-83. 48 "Theomorphism" seems the correct term to describe Milton's belief in the depiction of God, although this word was not in circulation until the nineteenth century.</page><page sequence="22">272 Milton and the Theory of Accommodation always described or outlined not as he really is but in such a way as will make him conceivable to us" (133), while later stating that "God either is or is not really like he says he is. If he really is like this, why should we think otherwise? If he is not really like this, on what authority do we contradict God?" (136). Yet I think these seeming contradictions are, for the most part at least, the product of attempting to understand Milton's theory of accommodation primarily according to the tenets of tradi- tional theories of accommodation-something which as I have stated is still prevalent among Miltonists.49 By situating the locus of compre- hension in the scriptural image and not the original, and proposing a synecdochic relationship between image and subject, Milton does not deny that an accommodation has taken place, that God is described not as he is but in such a way that he is conceivable to us, for "God, by his very nature, transcends everything, including definition, [yet (and this is the point)] some definition of him may be gathered from his names and attributes" (137-38). The essential point is that the image of God is a partial truth-being the truth but not the whole truth-such that it is correct for Milton to say that the image of God both is and is not really like he says he is, in a way analogous to the ocean example quoted from Epiphanius. Hence Milton brings to a close the theoretical discussion in this chapter with the statement that "We do not imply by this argument that God, in all his parts and members, is of human form" (136), but that the image of God which is depicted in the Scriptures should be believed to be correct and true, for it is so, albeit only a partial truth for the whole truth is beyond the comprehension of man.-' Ultimately, perhaps the most interesting truth for comprehension is not that of Milton's radi- cal process of literal exegesis, but his understanding of the literary text itself. Despite reservations concerning textual corruption, mistransla- tion, and the like, Milton had a much greater faith in the literal wording of the scriptural text than did most of his contemporaries. University of Botswana 49 Shullenberger in "Linguistic and Poetic Theory in Milton's De Doctrina Christiana" is typical: "The doctrine of accommodation is the traditional hermeneutic way of account- ing for the truth value of Scripture without eroding the absolute inconceivability of the Deity, and Milton's articulation of the doctrine conforms in its broad outlines to exegetical tradition" (271). 50 Cf. "Some description is extant of this divine glory, in so far as mortals can compre- hend it" (CPW6.15i).</page></plain_text>
