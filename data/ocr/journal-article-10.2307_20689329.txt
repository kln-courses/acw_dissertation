Katz, Series Editors AFTER AUSCHWITZ History, Theology, and Contemporary Judaism second edition RICHARD L. HUBENSTEIN When first published, After Auschwitz made headlines and sparked controversy as Jewish "death-of-God" theology. But as the first work by a respected modern theologian to define the Holocaust in religious as well as demographic terms, its greater importance gradually emerged. Today it ranks as a seminal work of modern Jewish thought and culture. In this revised and expanded edition, Richard Rubenstein returns to old questions and addresses new issues with the same passion and spirit that characterized his original work. $14.95 paperback IMAGINING THE CHILD IN MODERN JEWISH FICTION NAOMI B. SOKOLOFF The exercise of imagination required to portray a child's inner life has figured prominently in twentieth-century Jewish fiction. Naomi Sokoloff draws on contemporary narrative theory?especially the work of M. M. Bakhtin?to establish a critical framework for reading a range of Hebrew, Yiddish, and English texts that focus on young protagonists and the workings of a child's imagination. She discusses works by Sholem Aleichem, H. N. Bialik, Henry Roth, Jerzy Kosinski, Ahron Appelfeld, and David Grossman. $29.95 hardcover THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY PRESS 701 West 40th Street, Suite 275, Baltimore, Maryland 21211 To order, call 1-800-537-5487.</page></plain_text>
