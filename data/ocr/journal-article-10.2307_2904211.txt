<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kenneth A. McClane. Take Five: Collected Poems, 1971-1986. New York: Greenwood, 1988. 296 pp. $35.00. There is evidence in the six books of poetry collected in Take Five, ranging from 1972 to 1983 and including ten new poems written since 1983, that Kenneth McClane realized from the onset of his career the direction his poetry needed to take. His early commitment in matters of style, form, content, and theme has resulted in the formulation over the years, via a radical immersion in nature, of a viable aesthetics and a notable artistic maturity, all the more impressive when we consider that McClane accomplished all of this between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-two. His poetic achievement is due in great part to a pervasive humanistic idealism, a respect for literary tradition and cultures that borders on the eclectic, and his ready acknowledgment-particularly intense in his more recent poems-of the burdensome socio-literary marginality that goes with being a Black writer in America. Decidedly post-modernist in sensitivity, McClane is neo-Romantic in the way he extends the nineteenth-century Romantic interest in nature as a rectifying force in human existence. His roots are in Blake and Wordsworth in that respect, but he is also in the lineage of Walt Whitman, as the prototypical Romantic voice in American poetry. He partakes also of the modernism of Yeats and the post- modernism of an A. R. Ammons, and is solidly situated in the folk- based African-American literary tradition. He ranges widely in his appropriation of literary precedent and in his adaptation of cultural material and natural phenomena in the development of his art. He regards all things as valuable in generating human intelligence in and about the world, be those things "a stone, a ghetto, / a leaf, a stump, / a wing, a child . . .. as he expresses it in "Presences," an early poem and a central one for comprehending the role of nature in his poetry. Nearly all of McClane's poems are set in nature. Some begin in nature, seascape or woods, and move toward the center of human Black American Literature Forum, Volume 23, Number 3 (Fall 1989) ? 1989 Alvin Aubert</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 609 habitation, "the city." The poet's primary natural elements are appropriately the sun, the wind (figurative of life in its various manifestations), streams, trees, animal life (fish and birds in particular), and encompassing all, perception mediating between right and wrong in the world, the human eye, the reconciling element belonging equally to nature and to the city of man. McClane's eye seeks the "logic in the universe" ("Presences"), in quest of which his persona is compelled "to speak of the thickest of things in the leanest of ways" ("Saturday Night"). The poet discovers in the process a voice and a style. The ultimate object is reconciliation, but he must first offset the myopic dualizing we tend to resort to in dealing with nature. Our world-the necessary habitation we create but too often to the neglect of the tutelary ordering forces of nature-McClane would have us posit as coterminous with the natural world, which in its tutelary function proffers an abounding source of rectifying perceptions. McClane's poems generate perceptions that are often epiphanic, affirming the essential relatedness of all things. This particular concern is reflected in his earliest work. In his first collection, the chapbook Running Before the Wind, we are given to understand that it is the often ambivalent forces of nature that nevertheless enable us to sharpen our perceptive powers, right perception being the key to the recognition of meaning in the world, meaning perceived primarily as order, with implications for hard-won positive human relationships. Again in his focal poem "Presences," McClane resorts to surrealistic devices for projecting a Blakean- Wordsworthian moment of truth. The speaker of the poem is assailed by a sudden wind, which at times functions figuratively for McClane as it does for poet Gwendolyn Brooks, whom he greatly admires and to whom he dedicates the poem "A Tree Beyond Telling." Here, however, the sudden wind has more of a Shelleyan function as it catches the persona: at the anemic-thin bridge, near Fish Eddy (my place of finding) and sent my face dizzily hitting the domes of gnats and pelting the gills of carp The speaker in this section of "Presences" is not only isolated and estranged, as the concluding stanza of the poem indicates, he is socially and spiritually depleted ("at the anemic-thin bridge") as well. Loveless and at his lowest ebb, he is thus receptive to the regeneration accessible to him through the ordering of his</page><page sequence="3">610 Reviews perceptive faculties. His imaginative powers revived, he now needs someone to "tell / this hour about." (An impulse, incidently, that is at the heart of all McClane's poems.) The need has personal as well as social ramifications; as such, it attempts to define the ontological perimeters of human life. Wordsworth-like, it seeks, as in the poem "Innocence," "the child's enlightenment / that makes him supple / to the world" and requires: a contact (contextual relationship) with the fringe where the center elbows with meaning Turning to McClane's city, we find it to be no studied abstraction, no mere hypothetical opposite to nature. The opening of part 2 of "Presences" gives the city a specific focus and invests it with incipient and appropriate anthropomorphic characteristics: "Sunlight chins over / the great corpus of Harlem." Part 3, subtitled "Peter Quince," thus gaining thematic resonance by intertextualizing Wallace Stevens' "Peter Quince at the Clavier," departs from McClane's characteristic nature opening and begins in the city. McClane's Peter Quince is the master jazz composer and performer, saxophonist John Coltrane. In style, including its typography, "Peter Quince" replicates Coltrane's radical innovativeness in music. Cast in two unnumbered but typographically contrastive parts, the first half of the poem is a Coltrane riff. Like Stevens' poem, McClane's is a discourse of affirmation, praise, and exhortation, and concerns itself with human survival, despite the initial perception that "the wind has no order ... / the street no logic" and despite the information that in Harlem an Afro- American man turning to drink in his frustration "will share only / the knifing within him." The initial perception is clarified when, in part 6 of "Presences," the speaker concludes that "there is a logic in the universe / (enough to keep you," and that "the city is not far away" from the woods, the source of rectification and healing. The poem raises the question "the city-how is it like the woods?" Again, as in part 2 of the poem, we are apprised of a center of meaning in the occlusion of city and woods: ". . . premises are all flowing to conclusions / an indian showed me how / in the shifting of a branch ....." The city is like the woods in that a tree hefts significance a pine grows outward from its stem a celebration from its core to its farthest tip of life</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 611 and a city is life vital from its spine: hollows, bricks, nuts, alleyways to its people sounds of the woods lead me to sounds of the city a warm beautiful city like one I've never seen an apocalypse: (I like that word have always wanted desperately to give it shape) cattails and girders wildrose and sidewalks listening to silence of woods of beautiful black children and their silence In a similar vein of topographical reconciliation, in the poem "Perspectives," the speaker declares: "I shall walk with the woods / amongst ghettos of pine / (ghettos need not be unnatural / a tree has preferences also)." This echoes the "Peter Quince" section of "Presences" in its incorporation of the West African humanistic figure of the tree. In the equation, tree is to forest as individual is to group, the human being standing or falling as a single tree in a collective forest, with corporate ramifications. Earlier we are informed that Coltrane fell the large (a hunk of tree) bass riff African-American references such as these combine with those from the European-American quarter to establish McClane, in his inclusiveness, as a quintessentially American poet, a topic I pursue in more detail in a review of McClane's To Hear the River in the February 1982 issue of The Small Press Review. Similar allusions occur elsewhere among the poems, underscoring McClane's diasporian concerns. His references are sometimes to African and Afro-American matters separately, sometimes combined, and these in conjunction with Western world literary and general cultural material, as in the references to classical Greek and Biblical figures and events in various poems, often with the subtlety of the allusion to augury that occurs in "The Farmer" ("Yesterday something bothered him. Out near / the wild pine a</page><page sequence="5">612 Reviews hawk caught a mouse and tore his ribs loose") with its topical, rhythmical, intonational, and syntactical allusions to the blues ("Something's been bothering me, / Something's been on my mind"), and possibly to soul food ("ribs"). At this stage in McClane's development as a poet, the multifaceted reconciliation he has sought is established, and in its insistence on right perception, the idea of reconciliation being in itself a metaphor for that insistence, the adjustment provides a clue to the syntactical complexity of McClane's poems. A case in point is the short piece "Then," in which the nature imagery conjoined with that of music, jazz in particular, provides almost instant insight into the poem's meaning: wild corn does a yellow dance for the crow flying to be there when the river lights, and the insects steady as jazz finger the swing vines down. We are equally prepared for what otherwise might prove to be an impenetrably obscure piece, the poem "Cruise." The poem inscribes the creative process, tracing as it does, quite appropriately in navigational terms, a corollary transcendent experience that in turn delineates a process of discovery in and by which the "body is free" but the mind "is rippling / with the / swerves of motion." A "progression" transports the creative explorer paradoxically "outward / to the center of things" (locating the center in the universe) to "search in scribbling across waves / and paper to somehow / free them." A vision ensues that allows the poem's persona/explorer to "see / its [the vision's] own point of blindness." In this, McClane evokes the familiar description of the creative act as a journey incorporating a process of discovery. "Ask me about John] Ashbery?" the persona questions us in McClane's most ambitiously long poem to date, "Ship," ironically subtitled "Perfunctory Note," which runs to twenty-one pages in Take Five. Also about the creative process, the poem raises issues and sets them to rest in an exciting way. The Ashbery question concerns the distinction between parts and the whole, between adequate and inadequate human responses to the world, between "chasing a prospect / of eternity when / eternity is everything," when</page><page sequence="6">Reviews 613 the whole must be confronted the whole nasty, captivating enslaving, damning "Ship" alludes to John Ashbery's poem "The Picture of Little J. A. in a Prospect of Flowers." On the whole, it appears to be a response to what McClane apparently views as the impenetrable, nihilistic aspects of Ashbery's work. It is a focal piece that goes a long way toward earning for McClane a place among the first rank of American poets writing today, in the technical mastery, social relevance, and sense of direction his work displays. In considering McClane's treatment of nature it is important also to note that, for Afro-American writers, relating to the natural world has been acutely problematic, for black male writers especially, "the woods" existing as a singularly hostile environment in the Afro- American collective psyche for its association with lynchings in the South. Perhaps McClane's engraftment in the landscape of the northeast exempts him from this peculiar encumbency that is projected so starkly in the works of Richard Wright, for example, where a sort of pastoral displacement occurs, revealing the woods as infernally jammed, as it were, in the elegiac mode. We get a more balanced nature in McClane, one manifesting its perils and benevolences alike. In the "city," as in the "woods," perils naturally abound, but the life that buckles under the threat is a life not worth the living. One ventures out, sharpening one's senses (the eyes preeminently for reasons indicated earlier) and heeding the imperative that "the whole / must be confronted." From Moons and Low Times on we sense that McClane's persona has steadily confronted "the whole," the poet having carefully assimilated the nature imagery he mines in the earlier work, bringing city and woods into dynamic equilibrium. His later work becomes less expansive stylistically, as though in relief from the arduous exploratory task of working things out in the earlier poems, in quest of a poetics. The later poems can now turn inward as they do, becoming singularly, pointedly meditative, intent on engaging the outwardly observed in a composition of place that in traditional meditative practices initiates the meditative process. In their meditative aspects several of the pieces allude to Yeats, some explicitly so, as in the two poems beginning "Once more the wind is howling" and "From such country as I have seen." From the first of McClane's poems to the last there is a remarkable stylistic and thematic cohesion. As the poems accumulate, an</page><page sequence="7">614 Reviews aesthetic field takes form. A poetics emerges as the reader progresses engagedly, if somewhat slowly at first, through the syntactically disjunctive "ambiguous purity" (to borrow a phrase from Jerry W. Ward) of McClane's early work, to arrive at a handsomely aesthetic reward in the end. Though the poems gradually intensify meditatively, they do so without settling into any common mold, for in voice they are as various as continuity of style permits, with in fact a beneficent tension between voice and style. McClane's work is strongly rooted in his erudition, in Euro- and Afro-American culture, and in his careful observation of the (for him) complementary landscapes of nature and society. His discourse comes to rest in a pleasant equilibrium of sentiment and thought. Alvin Aubert Wayne State University Reconstructing Literary Study (A Collection of Syllabi, Course Materials, and Comments) Paul Lauter (English Department, Trinity College, Hartford, CT 06106) is beginning to collect syllabi, course materials, and comments for a new volume, similar in format to, but broader and more up-to-date in content than, Reconstructing American Literature. In the eight years since he gathered materials for Reconstructing, both American and British literature courses have changed significantly in response to feminist and minority scholarship. Many current American literature courses are far more inclusive than even the best of them were in the early 1980s. And some British (as well as "colonial" and "foreign") literature courses have significantly responded to the new scholarship. It seems to be an appropriate time, therefore, to bring together a volume which may be useful to faculty interested in encouraging change in their own and others' literature courses, in all areas. If you have syllabi, reading lists, course descriptions, or brief comments on courses you would like to share with colleagues elsewhere, please direct them to Professor Lauter.</page></plain_text>
