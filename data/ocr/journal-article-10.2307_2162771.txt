<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEREK JARRETT. The Sleep of Reason: Fantasy and Reality from the Victorian Age to the First World War. New York: Harper and Row. 1989. Pp. 233. $22.50. This book is concerned with how English-speaking societies (primarily Great Britain, although nominally North America) regarded fantasy and reality during the eighty years from the accession of Queen Victoria to World War I, a period that Derek Jarrett considers "one of history's great turning points" (p. 3). The fantasies in question are mostly the anthropomorphic frameworks of nineteenth-century Anglican theology and popular preaching, although vampires and Sher- lock Holmes also are not forgotten. Methodological problems immediately arise from the question of how a historian studies what a society believes to be real, when, at least from that historian's point of view, it is fantasy. Jarrett rejects the methods of either religious history or the history of ideas and opts for a psycho- analytic approach. Dismissing Freud, he finds Jungian psychoanalysis more promising "with its notion of the collective unconscious and its emphasis on myths and universal archetypes. Jung's impact on literacy critics has certainly been greater than that of Freud. And since the psychoanalyst and the literary critic are both in the business of assessing fantasies the historian of fantasy should perhaps look to their disciplines" (pp. 3-4). As a purported historical study, this is both a con- fused and a confusing book. It attempts to deal with a society's fantasies over nearly a century without ever articulating basic questions that any historian of such a subject should have put to himself or herself and his or her readers, namely, what part of the society accepted the fantasies in question and what part did not and why and what criteria is the historian using to decide what is fantasy and what is not. Jarrett's stance is almost naively positivistic, presuming that all religious faith is fantasy, that all religious faith is the same, that the anthropo- morphisms in which faith is articulated are identical with the objects of that faith, and that there is no line between faith and superstition. Before one attempts to write a history of the expressions of a society's collective unconscious, one has to deal with the issues of how representative of the society as a whole these expres- sions are and with the historian's own stance vis-a-vis these matters. Jarrett fails this test. Moreover, his use of data is so highly selective that it requires some justifications. In spite of his claims to depend on Carl Jung, his method is more anecdotal than analytical, and, although many of the anecdotes are fascinating, it is often unclear why these are used while others are omitted or what many of them mean in terms of the book's intent. For instance, Jarrett does</page><page sequence="2">Modern Europe 1543 mention the Metaphysical Society, but he ignores both the Synthetic Society (1896-1910) and the London Society for the Study of Religion (1904- ), each of which in purpose and composition might have added a sig- nificant dimension to his theme. As a work of history, this book is problematic; as a work of one historian's imagination, it is interesting. LAWRENCE BARMANN St. Louis University</page></plain_text>
