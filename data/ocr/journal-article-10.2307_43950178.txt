Introduction The Indian Contract Act (Act IX of 1872) came into force on the first day of September, 1872.1 When Sir Fitz James Stephen moved the Indian Contract Bill, he admitted that it was not, and could not pretend to be, a complete code upon the branch of law to which it related.2 However, the Act which emerged out of the Bill is in effect a code of English law.3 And like all codes based on an existing authoritative doctrine, it assumes acertain knowledge of the principles and habits of thougnt which are embodied in that doctrine.4 Yet it could not be said to be purely a code of English common law. Beginning with the application in the seventeenth century to British subjects in small areas in certain factories, the common law of England, with its statutory modifications and the doctrines of English courts of equity, had deeply coloured and influenced the laws and the system of judicial administration of this subcontinent. Even so the law and juris- prudence of this vast community and its patterns of judicial administration were, and are, in many matters different from those of England . There- fore, one would see in it English law in the distinct perspective of a new atmosphere and a strange clime.5 As a matter of fact the English brought into India not only the mass of legal rules strictly known as the common law but also their own traditions, outlook and techniques in establishing, maintaining and developing the judicial system.6 The result is, therefore, that a distinct jurisprudence called Anglo-Indian or Indo-British evolved itself during the course of over three centuries of close relationship between the two countries.7 Perhaps our first judicial contacts with the English concepts of contract, as well as with the English people and their system of administration of justice, began with the formation of the East India Company in 1600 A.D. during the region of Queen Elizabeth I.

The Royal Charters of Elizabeth I and James I granted to the Company in the years 1600 and 1609 respectively gave the power to it to make, ordain and constitute such and so many reasonable laws, constitutions, orders and ordinances as to them shall seem necessary... so always that the said laws, orders, constitu- tions, ordinances, imprisonments, fines and amerciaments be reasonable and not contrary or repugnant to the laws, statutes, customs of this our realm.8 With the acquisition by the Company of the island of Bombay in 1688, over which the British sovereign Charles II had absolute rights, a case for laying down a system of administration of justice based upon the English common law and statutes and procedures was firmly established, at least in a specific territory. The Charter of Charles II transferring the island to the Company required them to enact laws "consonant to reason, and not repugnant or contrary to" and "as near as may be agree- able to" the English laws. The charter also directed that the courts and their procedures should be "like unto those that are established and used in this our realm of England."9 Thus were laid the foundations in the seventeenth century albeit in the small area of the town and island of Bombay of the application of English laws to Indians residing in the Presidency towns, and of the system of administering justice fostered by the common law of England.10 The position advanced further with the establishment in the early eighteenth century, under the letters patents issued by the Crown, of Courts of Justice in the three Presidency towns of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras.11 The charters and the letters patents creating the courts introduced into their jurisdictions the English common and statute law in force at the time so far as it was applicable to the Indian circumstances.12 The subsequent 8.

There were at first the Mayor's Courts, which in Calcutta were superseded by the Supreme Court in 1773, and finally by the High Court in 1862. The Mayor's Courts in Madras and Bombay were replaced in 1797, by the Recorders' Courts. The Recorders' Court in Madras was abolished in 1799, and that in Bombay in 1823, and a Supreme Court was established in its place which again was superseded by the High Courts in both the places in 1862. 12. This view of the introduction of the English law into índia is, however, a matter of controversy, e.g., see the celebrated lex loci Report of 31st October, 1840 of the Indian Law Commissioners. Anyhow it may now be taken as an accepted doctrine. (See Pollock and Mulla at 2 (8th ed.)

It is a record of experiments made by foreign rulers to govern alien races in a strange land, to adapt European institutions to Oriental habits of life, making definite laws supreme amongst peoples who had been accustomed to associate government with the exer- cise of arbitrary and uncontrolled authority. There is considerable vascil- ation of purpose exhibited in those experiments, influenced as they have been by conflicts of opinion and the rivalry of interests but on the whole there has been a steady advance towards higher conditions of progress.13 It appears that with the Charter of the Mayors' Courts in 1726 the Company had sent to each Presidency a book of instructions and various forms prescribing the method of proceedings in civil suits, criminal trials and probate and administration matters. Not only that, relying upon the supposed powers the various Acts had bestowed on the Governor General and Council, as a Court of Record supervising the functioning of the provincial courts, the executive began to pass numerous regulations, apparently for the proper and effective functioning of the provincial courts, but in effect affecting the rights, persons and property of the natives and others amenable to the provincial courts.14 Thus consistent efforts were Surnomoye Dossee , (1863) 9 M.I.A. 387] and the law as to maintenance and champerty [Ram Còomar v.

Herbert Cowell, History and Constitution of the Courts and Legislative Autho- rities in India 3 (6th ed.). The noble words of Governor Aungier on the occasion of the inauguration of a Court of Judicature in the island of Bombay for the first time under the British on August 8, 1672 might be recalled, for they enunciate the principles which in the course of years that followed really set the pattern for the administration of justice not only in the island but in other areas in the country which gradually fell under the sway of the British. The Governor said : The Inhabitants of this Island consist of severall nations and Religions to wit - English, Portuguess and other Christians, Moores, and Jentues [a term used by the British in those days to designate Hindus] but you, when you sit in this seat of Justice and Judgement, must looke upon them with one single eye as I doe, without distinction of Nation or Religion, for they are all His Majesties and the Honble. Company's subjects as the English are, and have all an equal title and right to Justice and you must doe them all Justice, even the meanest person of the Island, and in particulare the Poore, the Orphan, the Widdow and the stranger, in al matters oí controversy, of common right, and Meum and Tuum ; And this not only one against the other, but even against myself and those who are in office under me, nay against the Honble. Company themselves when Law, Reason and Equity shal require you soe to doe, for this is your Duty and therein will you be justified, and in soe doing God will be with you to strengthen, you, His Majestie and the Company will commend you and reward you, and I, in my place, shall be ready to assist, Counten- ance, honour and protect you to the utmost of the power and Authority entrusted to me ; and soe I pray God give his blessing to you.

As has been observed by Fawcett : It was in many respects unsuitable for the prompt and satisfac- tory disposal of civil and criminal cases in which the Native in- habitants of the settlements were concerned; and the difference between the conditions of England and those of India, and between the atmosphere of Westminster Hall and that of the courts in India, was apt to be overlooked.16 The haphazard fashion and the ill-coordinated way by which the judicial administration in India was thus allowed to progress resulted in a state of affairs whereby the law became a bit unintelligible even to the judges and the courts who had to administer them, both in relation to the Presidency towns and the mofussil. The attention of the British Parliament was in 1833 drawn to this, which in turn led to the enact- ment of the Charter Act of that year, inter alia , providing for the appoint- ment of the First Law Commission for India. An era of codification of the laws followed, thereby providing a set of uniform laws with coherence and precision, applicable to the whole of the British empire in India in respect of several branches of the law, gradually and slowly in the beginn- ing, but more urgently after the consolidation of the Indian empire under the Queen in 1858. 17 Speaking on the occasion in Parliament, Macaulay, who himself became later the chairman of the First Law Commission, said: I believe that no country ever stood so much in need of a code of law as India, and I believe also that there never was a coun- try in which the want might be so easily supplied. The princi- ple is simply this - Uniformity when you can have it; diversity when you must have it; but in all cases certainty.18 15. ibid. 16.

In this context the Judges of the Supreme Court at Calcutta themselves expressed thus : In this state of circumstances, no one can pronounce an opinion or form a judg- ment, however sound, upon any disputed right of persons, respecting with doubt and confusion may not be raised by those who may choose to call it in question, for very few of the public or persons in office at home, not even the law officers, can be expected to have so comprehensive and clear a view of the Indian system, as to know readily and familiarly the bearings of each part of it on the rest... - (See Hansard's XVIII Parliamentary Debates 729 (' fmv riwl in c iirtm nntf&gt; 1 ^ at 7/1 18.

The Commissions we have referred to and the codes compiled by them became powerful instruments which injected English common and statute law and equitable principles into the ex- panding structure of Indian jurisprudence.19 The Contract Code The Report of the Second Law Commission submitted in December, 1855, its second Report, dealt with the wants in India in respect of sub- stantive civil law and stated: We see no reason, however, why, on very many important sub- jects of Civil Law - we shall only name one, contracts, as an example- such law cannot be prepared and enacted as will be no less applicable to the transactions of Hindoos and Mahome- dans, by far the most numerous portions of the population, than to the rest of the inhabitants of India."19® And the Third Law Commission was ready with the draft of the law of contract in 1866. Sir Frederick Pollock, who had the occassion to study the original draft when he wrote his great commentary on the Indian Contract Act in 1 905, stated : In fact, the Contract Act passed through not less than three distinct stages. First, there was the draft prepared in England by the Indian Law Commission, uniform in style and possess- ing great merit as an elementary statement of the combined effect of common law and equity doctrine as understood about forty years ago. Next, this was revised and in parts elabo- rated by the Legislative Department in India. The borrow- ing from the New York draft Code [which according to him is the worst piece of codification ever produced] seems to belongs to this phase. Lastly, Sir James Stephen made or supervised the final revision, and added the introductory defi- nitions, which are in a wholly different style and not alto- gether in harmony with the body of the work. Evidently this process could not satisfy the conditions of a model code. It is much to the credit of the workmen that the result, after allow- ing for all drawbacks, was a generally sound and useful one.20 19. Supra note 5 at 30. 19a. Cited in supra note 5 at 73. 20. Pollock and Mulla at vii (Under Preface to the First edition, 1905).</page><page sequence="6">SPECIAL ISSUE : LAWS OF EVIDENCE AND CONTRACT 137 Equally appreciative was Sir Henry Maine, who introduced the Contract Bill in the Legislative Council in 1867. He said: Their draft will be found to consist of the English law of con- tract much simplified and altered in some particulars so as to accommodate it to the circumstances of this country.... It may be said of these proposed modifications of English law that while all, or nearly all, of them have commended themselves to the approval of enlightened lawyers, not a few are being gradually carried out in England without the aid of the legis- lature through the direction given of late years to the current of judicial decision."21 Thus notwithstanding some of its defects, the Contract Code has, like most of the Anglo-Indian codes, served its purpose usefully and well. The fact that the Act has stood for a century without any appreciable modifications, except that elaborate separate enactments bearing almost on the same original brief provisions in the Act have since been passed in the fields of 'Sale of Goods' and 'Partnerships', speaks for its credit as a piece of useful and purposeful legislation. Even the Law Commissions set up after the Independence have not found it necessary to suggest any vital structural modifications to it.22 However, in the above circumstances, it might be necessary to re- member a few salient points while discussing any topic- say, the doctrine of frustration-under the Indian Contract Act. In the first place it seems proper to have a pretty well understanding of those fundamental notions in the common law which are concisely dec- lared, with or without modification, by the text.23. How far they have in fact been modified, and whether by deliberate design or by accident in the execution, is a question of interpretation depending not on the text alone, but also on its relations to the English authorities which the framers of the code had before them, and to the subsequent development of English law.24 Secondly, the Contract Act does not profess to be a complete code dealing with the law relating to contracts. As appears from the pream- able, the Act purports to do not more than to define and amend certain parts of the law. No doubt, it treats particular contracts in separate chapters, but there is nothing to show that the legislature intended to deal exhaustively with any particular chapter or sub-division of the law relating to contracts.25 As a result, on all matters on which the Act is 21.

The Courts in the former Presidency towns by the terms of their respective letters patents, and the Courts outside the Presidency towns by Bengal Regulation III of 1793, Madras Regulation II of 1802 and Bombay Regula- tion IV of 1827 and by the diverse Civil Courts Acts were enjoined in cases where no specific rule existed to act according to "law or equity" in the case of chartered High Courts and elsewhere according to justice, equity and good conscience - which expressions have been consistently interpreted to mean the rules of English common law, so far as they are applicable to the Indian society and circumstances.27 It is also quite natural for the courts applying the general rules embodied in the Act to new situations to look for assistance to cases decided on similar situations in England. They could not do otherwise for not only the general rules contained in the Act but some of the illustra- tions given to clarify them were also based on English decisions.28 However, in the next place while thus adopting the English rules as laid down by precedents, one has to bear in mind the warning already given long back both by Sir Frederick Pollock and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The former observed a tendency in India to follow the English authorities too literally (through in any case they are not positively binding on Indian Courts), con- sidering only what the Courts actually decided in England, and not what they would have decided if their office had been to apply the principles of the Common Laws to the facts of Indian society. The best way to counteract such a tendency is not to neglect the letter of English judgments, which is not practi- cable and would not be useful, but to enter more fully into their spirit and distinguish their permanent from their local and accidental elements.29 26.

Pollock and Mulla at viii.</page><page sequence="8">SPECIAL ISSUE : LAWS OF EVIDENCE AND CONTRACT 139 According to the Judicial Committee : The Indian Contract Act recites the expediency of defining and amending certain parts of the law relating to contracts. It is therefore an amending as well as a consolidating Act, and beyond the reasonable interpretation of its provisions there is no means of determining whether any particular section is intended to consolidate or amend the previously existing law. Again, their Lordships did not see any improbability in the Indian Legislature having taken the lead in a legal reform. Such reform may have been long recognized as desirable with- out an opportunity occuring for its embodiment in a legislative enactment, and it may well be that the opportunity occurred sooner in India than in this country (England), where the calls for legislative action are so much more numerous.30 Bearing these in mind we can proceed to discuss the origin and development of the concept of 'frustration' in the Indian contract law. II. The meaning of 'frustration9 in contract law The doctrine of frustration is only a special case of the discharge of contract by an impossibility of performance arising after the contract was made.31 The modern practice is to use the term 'frustration' to cover cases of both classes.32 And according to the Supreme Court also : Although 'various theories have been propounded by the Judges and jurists in England regarding the juridical basis of the doctrine of frustration, yet the essential idea upon which the doctrine is based is that of impossibility of performance of the contract : in fact impossibility and frustration are often used as interchangeable expressions . The changed circustances, it is said, make the performance of the contract impossible and the parties are absolved from the further performance of it as they did not promise to perform an impossibility.33 In fact the impossibility of performance may appear on the face of the contract itself, or may exist unknown to the parties at the time of the making of the contract, or may arise after the contract is made. 30.

According to section 56(1) of the Act "an agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void". In English law, impossibility, either physical or legal, which exists at the time of the formation of the contract and is obvious upon the face of it, makes the consideration unreal. The impossi- bility must, of course, be so obvious and 'according to the state of know- ledge of the day so absurd'34 that the parties could not be supposed to have really intended to contract.*5 Thus a promise to pay money in consideration of a promise to discover treasure by magic,36 or to supply the promisor with a live pterodactyl37 would be void for the unreality in the consideration furnished. Harvey v. Gibbons 38 is an old English case which furnishes us with an instance of a legal impossibility. In that case a bailiff was promised £40 in consideration of a promise made by him that he would release a debt due to his master. The court held that the bailiff could not sue; that the consideration furnished by him was 'illegal', ob- viously meaning legally impossible, for the servant could not release "a debt due to his master. So far as the Indian law is concerned it is difficult to expect a case where so obvious a proposition as the one laid down in paragraph (1) of section 56 could be in dispute.39 The position, therefore, is the same both in the common law and under the Act, though in the former it had to be arrived at by resort either to a rule as regards consideration or to one relating to the 'intention' of the parties as explained above. If there was impossibility of performance existing, unknown to the parties, at the time of the agreement itself the result would generally be that the agreement is void. This is sometimes known as 'pre-contractual frustration'.40 Section 20 of the Act provides: 34. In earlier editions of Anson's book on Contract, a promise to go to Rome in a day is given as an example of an impossible promise ; in later editions the example is a promise to go round the world in a day ; but future editions may have to go further still. 35.

According to Pollock and Mulla (at p. 343) illustration (a) to section 56 raises a curious (hypothetical) question. If A. agrees with B. to discover by magic a treasure supposed to be buried within certain limits at a spot not exactly known, and, after performing magic rites, does by good fortune discover the treasure, and A. and B. both believe that the magic was effica- cious, can A. recover any reward from B., and if so, under the agreement by rejecting the specification of means to be employed as immaterial, or under s. 70 of the Act, or how otherwise ? The learned authors themselves have not ventured to give any answer to the question raised thus. 40. See e.g. Bamford (1955) 72 S.A.L.J. 166,282.</page><page sequence="10">SPECIAL ISSUE : LAWS OF EVIDENCE AND CONTRACT 141 Where both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agree- ment is void. The three illustrations given thereunder are cases where there was an impossibility existing at the time of the agreement due to the destruc- tion of the subject-matter of the agreement and this fact was unknown to both the parties. But it is clear from a rather recent decision of the Privy Council that the principle need not necessarily be restricted to cases of destruction of subject-matter only. The case was of Sheikh Brothers , Ltd. v. Ochsner ,41 a case from Kenya but decided under section 20 of the Indian Contract Act where the appellants contracted with the respondent to grant him a licence to cut, process and manufacture all sisal grown on a particular estate in Kenya of which they were the lessees. In return, the respondent deposited a certain sum of money, and undertook to deliver to the appellants 50 tons of sisal fibre, manufactured by him, each month. The estate was, in fact, not capable of producing such a quantity of sisal as would meet this requirement The Privy Council had no hesitation to hold the agreement to be void on the ground that both the parties were entertaining the same mis- take of fact essential to the agreement. In such cases the frustrating event is already there, making the performance impossible; the only thing is that the parties become aware of it at a later date.42 But it is provided by the Act that where one person has promised to do something, which he knew, or, with reasonable diligence, might have known, and which the promisee did not know, to be impossible or unlaw- ful, such promisor must make compensation to such promisee for any loss which promisee sustains through the non-performance of the promise.43 Evidently this is subject to the first part of section 56. If the act promised to be performed is patently and on the face of it impossible the promisee cannot plead that he did not know it to be so. Illustration (c) appended to the section, it is submitted, purports to make it clear.43® Of course one 41. (1957) A.C. 136. 42. Some judges and text-book writers in Australia as well as in England restrict ł the scope of the principle of this section and attempt even to deny its efficacy to render an agreement formed on such promises as void, explaining the cases as based upon an implied condition or a total failure of consideration. In this connection see McRae v. Commonwealth Disposals Commission , (1951) 84 C.L.R. 377, a case decided by the High Court of Australia which has given rise to much academic discussion on the subject. (See Cheshire and Fifoot, The Law of Contract, 173-174 (4th ed.).

But if she was not aware of the marriage of A with C at all, then it is clear enough. Apparently there is no judicial authority in England laying down such a rule, and, therefore, it is not possible to say what would happen in a case of this sort. If the promisor knew of the impossibility then certainly he can be sued in tort for fraud or deceit. But what would be the posi- tion if he acts honestly but negligently ? McRae v. Commonwealth Dis- posals Commission 44 would certainly provide a just solution for such a situation, and viewed from this standpoint it lays down a correct, or at least a sound, proposition of law. But, the decision is both favourably and adversely criticised by the jurists.46 In McRae' s case the High Court of Australia held the defendants liable to the plaintiff for his expenses in fitting out an expedition to salvage a vessel, which the defendants had sold to the plaintiff when actually it was found that such a vessel never existed ; because they ought to have known that such a thing did not exist. But would it be decided likewise in England if a case of the sort arises now ? It is merely a matter for speculation. Perhaps section 56, paragraph (3) is an instance of a forward lead taken by the Indian legislature, as it could, as was pointed out by the Privy Council.46 Now apart from the above, and as clearly distinct from them, there might arise cases where after the parties have made their agreement, un- foreseen contingencies occur which prevent the attainment of the purpose that they had in mind. The question is what would be the consequences in such an eventuality ? In other words what is the effect, on an agree- ment, of any supervening impossibility ? It is with this aspect of the law of contract that we are now concerned. Impossibility which arises subsequently to the formation of a con- tract would generally discharge the parties from further performance of their obligations. The contract is said to become void from the date when 44. (1951) 84 C.L.R. 377 ; Smith and Thomas, A Casebook on Contract 328 (2nd ed.). 45.

Bar Review, 164 et seq , where they are inclined to say that the decision is sound though under a slightly different approach to the problem, taking it to be a problem of 'common' mistake. But Cheshire and Fifoot on the other hand are obviously critical of the decision and state that it would not be acceptable under the common law vide The Law af Contract 192-193 (6th ed.). Pollock and Mulla write : The third paragraph of section 56 seems to provide a just solution for the situation in McRae v. Commonwealth Disposals Commission (at p. 359). See also Derry v. Peek , (1889) 14 A.C. 337, where the House of Lords held that a wrong statement honestly made would not give rise to liability in tort even if there was negligence in making it. 46. See Ramdas v. Amercltand &amp; Co supra note 30.</page><page sequence="12">SPECIAL ISSUE : LAWS OF EVIDENCE AND CONTRACT 143 it becomes impossible.47 It is then said to be frustrated.48 Indeed the concept of frustration of a contract may be said to bear a more extensive meaning than that of impossibility, for it is not strictly necessary that performance should have become completely impossible, provided that it cannot properly be demanded in the fundamentally different situation, which has unexpectedly occurred.49 Frustration, in fact, has been defined as the premature determination of an agreement between parties, lawfully entered into and in course of operation at the time of its premature deter- mination, owing to the occurence of an intervening event or the change of circumstances so fundamental as to be regarded by the law both as striking at the root of the agreement, and as entirely beyond what was contemplated by the parties when they entered into the agreement. If, therefore, the intervening circumstance is one which the law would not regard as so fundamental as to destroy the basis of the agreement, there is no frustration.60 Viscount Simon said in another case :51 [T]he explanation of supervening impossibitity is at once too broad and too narrow. Some kinds of impossibility may in some circumstances not discharge the contract at all. On the other hand, impossibility is too stiff a test in other cases- for example, in the coronation cases, such as Krell v. Henry?2 And this has also been the view held by the courts in India throughout. For example as early as in 1881 the Calcutta High Court held so in Inder Persad v. Campbell ,63 where A had agreed to cultivate indigo for B for a certain number of years in certain lands of which A was a sub- tenant and subsequently during the continuance of the contract A lost possession of the lands, as his immediate landlord failed to pay rent, and was in consequence ejected. The court held that the case fell within the provisions of the second paragraph of section 56 of the Act, and that the fact that A himself might have paid up the rent and thus could have saved the land and himself from ejectment did not make the event such a one as A could have prevented. Evidently it was not a case of absolute 47. S. 56 of the Act. 48. Supra note 32 at 426. 49. Ibid. See Scityabrata G hose v. Mugneeram &amp; Co (1954) S.C.R. 310, 317. This much is clear that the word 'impossible' has not been ussd here (i.e., in s. 56) in the sense of physical or literal impossibility. The performance of an act may not be impracticable and useless from the point of view of the object and purpose which the parties had in view. 50. Cricklewood Property and Investment Trust Ltd. v.

Then again the Nagpur High Court in Kesari Chand v. Governor General-in-Council5i considered and discussed the question of frustration and came to the same conclusion that the doctrine comes into play when a contract becomes impossible of performance, on account of circumstances beyond the control of the parties, and that the doctrine is a special case of impossibility, and as such comes under section 56 of the Act. And the Supreme Court has, after quoting the judgment, stated that it is in full agreement with this view.65 Causes of frustration Frustration may, and commonly does, arise through delay, attribut- able to the fault of neither party, of such a character that the fulfilment of the contract, in the way or ways contemplated and practicable, is so inordinately postponed that the fulfilment when the delay is over will not accomplish the object or objects which both the parties to the contract must have known that each of them had in view at the time they made the contract, and for the accomplishment of which object or objects the contract was made.56 A familiar example of frustration is to be found where impossibility of performance has arisen by virtue of an Act of Parliament or a govern- ment order under statutory provisions or through an 'act of state' of the same country or a foreign one, such as a declaration of war.57 It may, however, be noted in this context that the doctrine of frustra- tion is in all cases subject to the important limitation that the frustrating cir- cumstances must have arisen without the fault of either party. The defence of frustration can, therefore, be defeated by the proof of fault, though the burden of proving the fault lies upon the party alleging it. We would have to deal with this aspect of the problem a little more elaborately later. The doctrine applies in general to all types of contracts. It applies generally to contracts of employment, charter parties including time charters, contracts for the carriage of goods by sea and contracts for sale of goods and chattels. A contract for personal service which can be performed by the promisor himself will be construed as frustrated if he becomes physically incapable of performing the contract without any default on his part. When personal considerations are of the foundation of the contract, as in the cases of principal and agent, or master and servant, the death of either party puts an end to the relation, and the contract is discharged.58 54.

Worthington ,61 the defendant promised to pay two thousand dollars eithei in land or in money. Conveyance of land became impossible. It was held that if a party contracts to do either of the two things at his option and one of them becomes impossible, he must do the other. "It would be indeed startling to the good sense of an honest man if one who contracted to do one of two things need do neither if unable to do both."62 This in effect is the meaning of contractual frustration and is practi- cally the same both in the common law and under the Indian Contract Act. The time of frustration The exact time at which a contract is discharged by frustration is usually clear upon the facts of the case but in cases where it is not, such as in cases of idefinite delay, the general rule isthat the time of frustration is to be decided by reference to the time when the parties come to know of the cause.64 III. The position in English law prior to 1872 As has already been pointed out before, for a better understanding of an Anglo-Indian code like the Contract Act in relation to any of the provisions therein in respect of a particular concept, as for example, frus- tration, one ought to attempt to get a pretty full exposition of the funda- mental notions in relation to it in the English common law at the time of the enactment of the code which are concisely declared, with or without modification, by the text. How far they have, in fact, been modified, and whether by deliberate design or by accident in the execution, is a question of much importance because that will determine how far the English rul- ings are relevant while interpreting the provisions of the statute. And to find a satisfactory answer to the question it would be essential to go into the details and examine the English authorities themselves on the topic- and not generally - which would have been before the framers of the Act. 59.

However if a party promises a specified performance; with a provision for the payment of a sum of money as a penalty or liquidated damages in case of failure to perform, the contract is not an "alternative contract." The other party bargains for the performance, and not for the sum of money. Corbin , supra note 61 at 921. 63. Curt Line Ltd. v. Dant a nd Russell Incorporated, (1939) 3 All E,R, 314,</page><page sequence="15">146 JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN LAW INSTITUTE [1972] It would also be necessary to observe the trends already discernible through them as the same might have had also a bearing on the enact- ment. Our next attempt should, therefore, be to make out these and their relations to the Act as clear as possible. In the seventeenth century the English judges seems to have laid down the rule of 'absolute liability' in relation to the contractual obligations. This was based upon, and apparently to foster, the complete freedom of contract to which the British judges so steadfastly adhered to at one time. This insistence on the sanctity and freedom of contract has, as in some other instances, brought into existence this anomalous principle of abso- lute liability. When the law casts a duty upon a men which, through no fault of his, he is unable to perform, he is excused for non-performance ; but if he binds himself without reservations by contract to do a thing, he cannot escape liability for damages by proof that as events turned out performance is fuitle or even impossible.64 The alleged justifications for this - somewhat harsh - and at the present day rather curious - principle is that a party to a contract can always- and he ought to - guard against such contingencies by express stipulations and if he does not do so he can- not complain merely because events turn out to his disadvantage. The rule, therefore, was that generally speaking a man who makes an unquali- fied promise thereby not only declares his willingness but vouches for his ability to perform it. One of the earliest English decisions, Paradine v. Jane ,65 where the plaintiff brought an action of debt for rent due for lands let to the defen- dant. The plaintiff declared upon a lease rendering the rent quarterly. The defendant pleaded that a German Prine, Prince Rupert, an alien born, enemy to the King and kingdom, had invaded the realm with an army of men, and with the same force had entered upon the lands let by the plaintiff to the defendant and had expelled him therefrom, and held out of possession from July, 1642 to Lady Day, 1646, whereby he could not take the profits. To this plea the plaintiff demurred.65® This plea was resolved insufficient and the court stated : [I]t was resolved that the matter of the plea was insufficient, for although the whole army had been alien enemies, yet the dé- fendent ought to pay his rent. This defence was taken, that where the law creates a duty or charge, and the party is dis- 64 See Cheshire and Fifoot, supra note 42 at 458 ; see aiso supra note 56 at 182. 65.

Rep. 172 at 173»</page><page sequence="16">SPECIAL ISSUE : LAWS OF EVIDENCE AND CONTRACT 147 abled from performing it without any default in him, and hath no remedy over, there the law will excuse him. ..But when the party by his own contract creates a duty as a charge upon him- self he is bound to make it good, if he may, notwithstanding any accident by inevitable necessity because he might have provided against it by his contract.655 And it appears that the rule was being rigorously applied for a long time since then. For example in Hills v. Sughrue ,66 a case decided in 1846, nearly two hundred years after Paradine v. Jane , a ship-owner who had agreed to load his ship with guano at a certain place in West Africa was held liable for damages notwithstanding the fact that guano became unobtainable there. But in course of time the harshness and the unreasonableness of the rule, whereby a man was held liable strictly to his promise no more and no less, were felt and the judges found that it might operate harshly and unfairly in many instances.67 It was gradually felt that the lot of a person who for some good reason, found himself unabl e to secure all that he thought he had bargained for, or to discharge his contractual obligation as he had conceived it, might be a hard one. And as an escape from the rigorous rule the judges discovered the 'implied term doctrine' which proved a most useful instrument in their hands in developing measures of relief in cases of supervening impossibility of performance or the frustration of contracts.68 Thus starting with the case of Taylor v. Caldwell 69 in 1863, a substantive and particular doctrine has gradually been evolved by the courts providing that if further fulfilment of the contract is brought to an abrupt stop by some irresistible and extraneous cause for which neither party is responsible, the contract shall terminate forthwith and the parties be discharged. In Taylor v. Caldwell , the plaintiffs and defendants had, on May 27th 1861, entered into a contract by which the defendants agreed to let the plaintiffs to have the use of the Surrey Gardens and the music hall on four days viz., June 17th, July 15th, August 5th and August 19th, for the purpose of giving a series of four grand concerts, and day and night fetes, at the gardens and the hall on those days respectively; and the plaintiffs agreed to take the gardens and the hall on those days, and pay £100 for each day. The agreement then proceeded to set out various stipulations between the parties as to what each of them was to supply for these concerts and entertainments, and as to the manner in which they should be carried out. 65».

After making of the above agreement, and before the first day on which a concert was to be given, the hall was destroyed by fire without the fault of either party and the destruction was so complete that, in consequence, the concerts could not be given as intended. And the ques- tion before the court was whether, under those circumstances, the loss which the plaintiffs had sustained was to fall upon the defendants. The parties, according to Blackburn, J., when framing their agreement had not present to their minds the possibility of such a disaster , and, therefore, had made no express stipulation with reference to it. The answer to the question had, therefore, to be given on the basis of general rules of law applicable to such a contract. After stating the common law rule of absolute contracts His Lordship observed: But this rule is only applicable when the contract is positive and absolute and not subject to any condition either express or implied; and there are authorities which, as we think, establish the princi- ple that where, from the nature of the contract, it appears that the parties must from the beginning have known that it could not be fulfilled unless, when the time for the fulfilment of the contract arrived, some particular specified thing continued to exist, so that when entering into the contract they must have contemplated such continued existence as the foundation of what was to be done, there, in the absence of any expressed or implied warranty that the thing shall exist, the contract is not to be construed as a positive contract, but as subject to an implied condition that the parties shall be excused in case, before breach, performance becomes impossible from the perish- ing of the thing without default of the contractor.70 As a justification for implying such a term the court said : There seems little doubt that this implication tends to further the great object of making the legal construction such as to ful- fil the intention of those who enter into the contract, for, in the course of affairs, men, in making such contracts, in general, would, if it were brought to their minds, say that there should be such a condition.71 70.

The above case and the judgment rendered therein were supposed to have laid down the foundation forche modern, rule in the English law.72 Yet it would be seen that the judge was taking very cautious steps and that he found it necessary to walk with circumspection in order to reconcile reason and justice with the established rule as to the absolute liability. And he had had to resort to a fiction of law, viz, the doctrine of implied term to depart from the established practice and precedent. In the midst of all these one would not fail to discern the anxiety to over- come an inconvenient and rather harsh rule; otherwise it is very hard to find any distinction between the facts of this case and those of Paradine v. Jane?*' Obviously the continued existence of the music hall in Taylor v. Caldwell as a condition of the defendants' duty to deliver possession has been found by purely a process of "construction" but it is shown apparently to have been obtained by a process of "interpretation" of the terms of the agreement. The implied term theory played an in- dispensable part in the development of this branch of the law and it took years to have the principles put in the true perspective as will be seen later on hereunder. When once the way was thus cleared, the courts, obviously anxious to adjust the law to the social requirements of a society getting more and more complex, began to apply the implied term theory freely, but cautiously, to relieve parties of the consequences of supervening impossi- bility or frustration for no fault of theirs; in many other cases in similar circumstances though, as Sir Frederick Pollock has written, the English courts fomerly were averse to go beyond the strict letter of instruments, and would only in extreme cases imply the terms that were not expressed or at least imported by some generally understood custom.74 Thus in Boast v. Firth15 a master sued the father of his apprentice on his covenant in the apprenticeship deed that the apprentice should serve the plaintiff during all the term. The defence was that the apprentice was prevented from so doing by permanent illness arising after the making of the indenture. The court held : 72. See Cheshire and Fifoot, supra note 42 at 462. 73.

As we have already seen, 'act of God' was not formerly considered to be an excuse for non-per- formance of an undertaking by contract.77 Again in Robinson v. Davison.10 the defendant's wife, an eminent pianist was, engaged to play at a concert. When the time came she was disabled by illness. The giver of the enter- tainment sued for the loss he had incurred by putting off the concert, and had a verdict for a small sum under a direction to the effect that the performer's illness was an excuse, but she was bouud to give the plaintiff notice of it within a reasonable time. The sum recovered represented the excess of the plaintiff's expenses about giving notice of the postponement to the public and to persons who had taken tickets beyond what he would have had to pay if notice had been sent by telegraph instead of by letter. The Court of Exchequer upheld the direction on the main point. The reason was shortly put by Bramwell thus : This is a contract to perform a service which no deputy could perform, and which in case of death could not be performed by the executors of the deceased : and Ï am of opinion that by virtue of the terms of the original bargain incapacity either of body or mind of the performer, without default on his or her part, is an excuse for non-performance.79 The same judge also observed, in effect, that the contract becomes not voidable at the option of the party disabled from performance, but wholly void. Here the player could not have insisted "on performing the engagement, however ineffectually that might have been," when she was really unfit to perform it. The other party's right to treat the contract as annulled was also afterwards established by a direct decision.80 In fact the endeavours of the courts to find a fair solution to such cases by somewhat exaggerated use of the implied term is an interesting phase of English legal history. Indeed in ascertaining the implied inten- tion or will in these circumstances the courts often went far beyond "the regular process of judicial construction."81 It was also clear by the time the Indian Contract Bill came to be enacted that the above rule of dis- 76.

Supra note 74 at 224.</page><page sequence="20">SPECIAL ISSUE : LAWS OF EVIDENCE AND CONTRACT 151 charge of contract for supervening impossibility was not confined to cases of destruction of the subject-matter or personal disabilities but also to other cases of a similar nature. For example in Baily v. De Crespigny ,82 a lessor covenanted with the lessee that neither he nor his heirs nor his assigns would allow any building (with certain small exceptions) on a piece of land of the lessor's fronting the demised premises. Afterwards a railway company purchased this piece of land under the compulsory power under an Act of Parliament, and built a station upon it. The lessee sued the lessor upon the covenant ; but the court held that he was discharged by the subsequent Act of Parliament, which put it out of his power to perform it. And according to the court this was agreeable to the true intention, for the railway company coming under the compulsory powers, whom he (the covenantor) could not bind by any stipulation, as he could to an assignee of his own choice, was a new kind of assignee, such as was not in the con- templation of the parties when the contract was entered into. If a sub- sequent Act of Parliament making the performance of a contract impos- sible were a private Act obtained by the contracting party himself, he might perhaps remain bound by his contract as if he had made the per- formance impossible by his own act : but where the Act is a public one, its effect in discharging the contract cannot be altered by showing that it was passed at the instance of the party originally bound. The English law of frustration was at this stage when the Indian Contract Act came to be drafted and became law in India in 1872. IV. The evolution of the concept in the Indian law Having thus analysed the back-ground, namely, the position in English common law at the time of the drafting and passing into law of the Indian Contract Act, let us now turn to the provisions made in the Act and the evolution of the concept in the Indian law. We shall examine in the first instance how far the common law principles which were available before the framers of the code were incorporated in the enact- ment ; to what extent they have been departed from ; whether such depar- tures were by deliberate design or by mere accident in the execution ? How far the evolution in India has been influenced by the later English authorities ? The relations of the provisions in the Act to the then avail- able English authorities ; the trends discernible at the time and the sub- sequent developments in the English law will, perhaps, provide answers to these questions. Possibly taking the cue from the then prevailing English authorities on conditions in contracts' there came to be enacted a whole chapter, chapter III and sections 31 to 36, on 'contingent contracts' or more aptly 82.

Commenting upon this chapter the learned editors of the Act state :84 This short chapter of the Act appears to be the original work of the (Indian) Legislative Department. There were some clauses on the subject in the draft prepared in England, but their language was quite different. We do not know why the word "contingent" familiar to English lawyers only in the law of real property, was preferred to "conditional". A 'contingent contract' is defined by section 31 as "a contract to do or not to do something, if some event, collateral to such contract, does or does not happen". And section 36 provides : Contingent agreements to do or not to do anything, if an impo- ssible event happens, are void, whether the impossibility of the event is known or not to the parties to the agreement at the time when it is made. From these and the other sections in the chapter and the illustra- tions appended thereto it appears to be clear that, this part of the Act deals with conditional contracts in general and that it is not confined only to those contracts the performance of which is due only "on the condition" that something or some state of things continued to exist till the time of the performance. A promise is said to be absolute or conditional depending upon the circumstances. A promise is absolute or uncondi- tional when the promisor binds himself to the performance in any event,85 conditional when the performance is due only on the happening of some uncertain event in the future86 or if some state of facts not within the promi- sor's knowledge now exists.87 It is obvious that the doctrine of frustration and impossibility of performance is concerned with only the first type of conditional promise. And this type of conditional contracts, well known and well established in the common law by that time under the implied term doctrine, are dealt with in section 32 specifically. Section 32 reads : Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncer- tain future event happens cannot be enforced by law unless and until that has happened. If the event become impossible such contracts become void. Commenting upon this section it has been said88 that there are some 84. Pollock and Mulla at 266. 85. Cf. the dictum in Parodine v.

So too, a term of a contract can be either express or implied, with the result the entire field of the rule of frustration or the common law under the implied term theroy came within the provisions of section 32. Shelat, J. said in a Supreme Court decision*1: Since under the Contract Act a promise may be express or implied in cases where the court gathers as a matter of const- ruction that the contract itself contains impliedly or expressly a term according to which it would stand discharged on the happening of certain circumstances the dissolution of the contract would take place under the terms of the contract it- self and such cases would be outside the purview of Section 56. Although in English law such cases would be treated as cases of frustration, in India they would be dealt with under Section 32. But in a majority of cases at the present day, however, the doctrine of frustration is applied not on the ground that the parties themselves agreed to an implied term which operated to release them from the performance of the contract. The court can grant relief on the ground of subsequent impossibility when it finds that the whole purpose or the basis of the con- tract was frustrated by the intrusion or occurence of an unexpected event or change of circumstances which was not contemplated by the parties at the date of the contract. There would in such a case be no question of finding out an implied term agreed to by the parties embodying a provision for discharge because the parties did not think about the matter at all nor could possibly have any intention regarding it. When such an event or change of circumstances which is so fundamental as to be regarded by law as striking at the root of the contract as a whole occurs, it is the court which can pronounce the contract to be frustrated. This is really the positive rule enacted in section 5682 which reads as follows:93 An agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void. 89. Ibid. 90. See s. 9. 91. Naihati Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v.

It is here in section 56 that the Indian Contract Act, it is submitted, has taken a definite, and if one could say so, a well advised, step forward in the matter of legal reform, based upon the considerations of practical convenience and sound common sense. Commenting upon this section, the learned editors of the Act stated94: Nothing resembling this section has been found among the materials known to have been used by the framers of the Act. It varies the Common Law to a large extent, and moreover the Act lays down positive rules of law on questions which Eng- lish and American Courts have of late more and more tended to regard as matters of construction depending on the true intention of the parties.95 According to the well known jurist, Pollock, the Indian Contract Act attempted to generalize the doctrine, namely, where the fulfilment of a contract according to the parties' true meaning and intent demands not only their action in confirmity with the terms, but the occurrence of events in the normal order contemplated, or the existence or continuance of a so normal order contemplated, or the existence or continuance of a normal state of things at the due time of performance, and the mate- rial circumstances are so radically changed by unforeseen accident that the purpose of the contract as a whole is frustrat- ed, there a performance which has become impossible, or though literally possible would be futile, is excused, and both parties are discharged, as long ago as 187296. But specifically referring to paragraph (2) of sec- tion 56 he said: This is unsatisfactory both in excess and in defect. It purports to lay down a positive rule of law regardless of the parties' intention, and therefore is too wide; yet it fails in terms to in- clude the case of literal performance being possible but use- less, and in that respect too narrow.97 94.

But, it is respectfully submitted, that it could not have been so in 1872.98 As a matter of fact the English law passed through various stages of develop- ment since 1872 and even today it cannot be asserted that "the various decided authorities there are in any way uniform".99 True, of late the Supreme Court in India has been emphasising, now and then, that "so far as the Courts in this country are concerned, they must look primarily to the law as embodied in ss. 32 and 56 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872."100 The court has also recently, through several cases decided by it, expounded the full scope and extent of these sections; but it cannot also be denied that it has also extended the principles in our law in accordance with the changing social requirements of a society be- coming more and more complex. In Satybrata Ghose v. Mugneeram, for example, Mukherjea, J., (as he then was) stated as follows:101 The first argument advanced by the learned Attorney-General raises a somewhat debatable point regarding the true scope and effect of section 56 of the Indian Contract Act and to what extent, if any, it incorporates the English rule of frustra- tion of contracts. Section 56 occurs in Chapter IV of the Indian Contract Act which relates to performance of contracts and it purports to deal with one class of circumstances under which perfor- mance of a contract is excused or dispensed with on the ground of the contract being void. After quoting the provisions of that section he added: The first paragraph of the section lays down the law in the same, way as in England. It speaks of something which is impossible inherently or by its very nature, and no one can obviously be directed to perform such an act. The second paragraph enunciates the law relating to discharge of contract by reason of supervening impossibility or illegality of the act agreed to be done. The wording of this paragraph is quite 98. It also appears to be opposed to what has been stated in Pollock and M uli a at 343. 99. Per Mukherjea, J., in the case of Satyabrata Ghose , supra note 49 at 320. 100.

This much is clear that the word 6 impossible ' has not been used here in the sense of physical or literal impossibility. The performance of an act may not be literally impossible but it may be impracticable and useless from the point of view of the object and purpose which the parties had in view; and if an untoward event or change of circumstances totally upsets the very foundation upon which the parties rested their bargain, it can very well be said that the promisor finds it impossible to do the act which he promised to do. Although various theories have been propounded by the Judges and jurists in England regarding the juridical basis of the doc- trine of frustration, yet the essential idea upon which the doctrine is based is that of impossibility of performance of the contract; in fact impossibility and frustration are often used as interchangeable expressions . The changed circumstances, it is said, make the performance of the contract impossible and the parties are absolved from the further performance of it as they did not promise to perform an impossibility. Then after referring to some of the decisions in English law after passing of the Act and the dicta laid down therein,102 he conti- nued :103 We hold, therefore, that the doctrine of frustration is really an aspect or part of the law of discharge of contract by reason of supervening impossibility or illegality of the act agreed to be done and hence comes within the purview of section 56 of the Indian Contract Act. It would be incorrect to say that section 56 of the Contract Act applies only to cases of physical impossi- bility and that where this section is not applicable, recourse can be had to the principles of English law on the subject of frustration. It must be held also that, to the extent that the Indian Contract Act deals with a particular subject, it is exhaustive upon the same and it is not permissible to import the principles of the English law dehors these statutory provi- sions. The decisions of the English courts possess only a 102. Tamplin Steamship Co. Ltd. v. Anglo Mexican Petroleum Products Co.

Then his Lordship dealt with the relation between the two sections, namely, section 32 and section 56 also to explain the entire law of super- vening impossibility and frustration as covered by them. To the same effect are the elaborations made by his Lordship Shelat, J., in a decision already adverted to.104 The position in effect, therefore, is that in Indian law, because of the far-sighted provisions of the Act, it is not necessary to have any resort to any 'legal fiction' or 'theory' for the application of the doctrine of frustra- tion. Here they are given as positive rules of law, whether it be as envi- saged by the earlier 'implied term theory' or the later one of the 'doctrine of construction'. But it cannot be said that this position has been reached without any process of interpretation of the provisions of the Act in the light'of the subsequent rulings of the English courts. In spite of the 'unsatisfactory aspects' apparent in the provisions of the Act, complained of by Pollock,105 an examination of the judicial pro- cess in India ever since 1872 would show that the courts had understood the real purport of them and had been applying them correctly to actual factual situations arising before them for decision. The Privy Council, as early as in 1912 held, in Vissanji Sons &amp; Co . v. Shapurji 106 upholding the view of the Bombay High Court, that section 32 is of application not only for giving effect to 'express terms or condi- tions' but also for the purpose of construing 'implied terms or conditions' as well while deciding whether a contract is frustrated or not under the terms of the contract itself. In one of the early decisions under section 56, Inder Pershad Singh v. Campbell ,107 the Calcutta High Court interpreted the word 'impossible'. The plaintiff had agreed to purchase indigo from the defendant who undertook to cultivate it for a certain number of years in certain lands of which the defendant was a sub-tenant. Subsequently during the conti- nuance of the contract the defendant lost possession of the lands, as his immediate landlord failed to pay the rent, and was consequently ^ejected. On the filing of a suit for breach of contract, the court held that the case came within the provisions of the second paragraph of section 56 and that the parties stood discharged of their obligations from the date of loss 104.

In that case the fact that the court held, on a construction of the document, that no implied term could actually be inferred and that it was an unconditional undertaking would have no bearing on the dictum relating to 'implied terms.' 107. Supra note 53.</page><page sequence="27">158 JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN LA W INSTITUTE [1972J of possession of the lands by the defendant. The court said that the mere fact that the defendant might have paid up the rent on behalf of his immediate landlord and thus have saved the land and himself as its sub- tenant from ejectment did not make the event such a one as he could have prevented. Though the court does not seem to have expressed it in so many words, the decision could be justified on the ground of ťdis- appearence of the foundation' on which the contract was entered into by the parties. It had not become either absolutely impossible of perform- ance or useless in the changed circumstances. Viewed in that way the decision conforms to the later English doctrine of loss of foundation enunciated for the first time in Krell v. Henry.108 At the same time it would be seen that the courts in India showed a tendency to be rather too cautious in applying the doctrine of frustra- tion. In a suit for damages against a Hindu father for breach of a con- tract to give his minor daughter in marriage to the plaintiff, it was held by the Bombay High Court that the performance of the contract had not become impossible simply because the girl had declared her unwilling- ness to the marriage with the plaintiff, and the defendant had declared his inability to compel her to change her mind.109 In the course of the judgment the court said: The act is neither impossible in itself, nor impracticable in the ordinary sense of the term... Though physical force can- not for one moment be thought of, it is no doubt the duty of the defendant according to the terms of his contract to use to the utmost his persuasive powers and his position as parent in order to induce his daughter to be married to the plaintiff. Again as late as 1945 another case in point is that of Sachindra Nath Basu v. Gopal Chandra Ghose110 where the plaintiff letfpremises to the defendant for a restaurant at rather a high rent, the agreement to remain in force as long as British European troops remained in the town. The troops did remain, but the locality was declared out of bounds for them. In a suit for rent the defendant pleaded frustration but the court held that the agreement was not frustrated. It is submitted that here the founda- tion of the contract had disappeared, and the .agreement ought to have been held to be at an end.111 108. Supra note 52.

For example the Privy Council itself observed in Harnandrai Fulchand v. Pragdas Budhsen 112 that the court below "had not the benefit of the later decisions of the English Courts on frustration" while deciding the case thereby implying that they would be more or less binding here. And directly in Parshotam Das v. Baiala Municipal Committee 113 and again in Rama Nand v. Gokal Chand 114 the Punjab High Court seems to held the view that section 56 of the Act is not exhaustive. But beginning with Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram 115 the Supreme Court has repelled this suggestion, at the same time expressing its readiness to construe the word 'impossible' appearing in section 56 in its practical rather than in its literal sense. On the whole it could be said that the law in India on the doctrine of frustration as provided for in sections 32 and 56 of the Act has been on sound basis. It has also developed on correct lines by a process of in- terpretation, and the part played by our Supreme Court, of late, by placing the entire law on a clear foundation has been remarkable. The law has thus crystallized itself into a clear form, and whatever ambiguity there had been in the past has once for all disappeared in the matter of application of the doctrine. In that respect it may be said that the Indian law has definitely taken a lead over that in the England. V. Developments in English law subsequent to 1872 Though we have had occasion to refer to the subsequent develop- ments in English law now and then the entire picture of the same has not been obtained in a regular sequence. It is, therefore, hoped that it would be profitable to have at least a cursory glance at those developments ever since the passing of the Act in 1872, for a comparative study. True, the decisions of the English courts possess only a persuasive value but they may be helpful in showing how the courts in England have decided cases under circumstances similar to those which have come before our courts.116 As a matter of fact the English law passed through various stages of development since then and the principles enunciated in the various decided authorities cannot be said to be uniform.117 112.

Caldwell 118 was further extended to cases where without the destruction of any material object, a state of things contemp- lated by the parties as essential for performance, according to their true intent, failed to exist when the time for performance arrived, and this whether it was expressly mentioned in the terms of the contract or not. The principal group of such cases arose out of the postponement, by reason of King Edward VH's illness, of the coronation procession appo- inted to take place in July, 1902. In Krell v. Henry ,119 for instance : The defendant agreed to hire a flat from the plaintiff for June 26 and 27, 1902; the contract contained no reference to the coronation processions, but they were to take place on those days and to pass the flat. The processions were later cancelled. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff could not recover the rent although the contract had not become impossi- ble of performance in the strict sense. Vaugham Williams, L. J., held that it was not essential to the application of the principle of Taylor v. Caldwell that the direct subject of the contract should perish or fail to be in existence at the date of performance of the contract. It was suffi- cient if a state of things or condition expressed in the contract and essen- tial for its performance perishes or fails to be in existence at that time. Apparently, however, the judges were not quite sure of their ground while thus extending the principle of Taylor v. Caldwell to cases of this sort. That perhaps explains why the same judges who had decided Krell v. Henry had already refused to regard a somewhat similar contract in another case in the very same year as frustrated.120 In that case an agreement was made that the plaintiffs' ship should be "at the disposal of" the defendant on June 28, 1902 to take passengers from Herne Bay "for the purpose of viewing the naval review and for a day's cruise round the fleet." The review was cancelled, but the fleet remained at Spithead on the date. It was held that the contract was not discharged. The case is otherewise not easy to distinguish from Krell v. Herny,121 At the same time a contract for the delivery of cargo to be shipped at Alexandria in a named ship during certain month had been held to be discharged by an accident to the ship which stranded her in the Baltic before the time for performance; in other words the contract was held to be "conditional on that ship con- tinuing to exist as a cargo-carrying ship" available for the performance of the contract.122 The fact is that where the condition alleged to be of the essence of the contract is not the definite fact of a specific thing exist- ing or not existing, the application of the general principle becomes more and more difficult.123 118.

For, if the parties foresaw the circum- stances which existed at the date of performance they would have provided for them in the contract; if they did not, that means that they deliberately took the risk and, therefore, no question of an implied term could really arise.125 So the courts had of necessity to devise new theories, and the theory of "disappearence of the foundation of contract" gradually emerg- ed. It was more clearly and precisely stated by Atkin, L. J., in Russkoe v. Stirk 125 where he said : There are many positive rules of law imposed upon contract- ing parties which govern the whole creation, performance, and dissolution of a contract which are quite independent of the intention of the parties. For my part I see no reason why, in a certain set of circumstances which the Court finds must have been contemplated by both parties as being of the essence of the contract and the continuance of which must have been deemed to have been essential to the performance of the con- tract, the Court should not say that when that set of circum- stances ceases to exist, then the contract ceases to operate.126 It was adopted by Goddard, J., in Tatem Ltd. v. Gamboa}21 The learned judge observed that the cases "show in effect that, although the parties may have had or must be deemed to have had the matter in con- templation, the doctrine of frustration is not prevented from applying."128 He further stated : If the foundation of contract goes, either by the destruction of the subject-matter or by reason of such long interruption or delay that the performance is really in effect that of a differ- ent contract, and the parties have not provided what in that event is to happen, the performance of the contract is to be regarded as frustrated.129 But even in the above theory there is in effect an element of the intention of the parties, for the court could interfere only if the parties 124.

Id. at 139.</page><page sequence="31">162 JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN LAW INSTITUTE [1972] "have not provided what in that event is to happen." But a still more radical theory which came to be evolved is that the court exercises a qualifying power- a power to do what is just and reasonable in the new situation. And according to this theory it must be taken to be the law that the contract is frustrated by the occurrence of the frustrative event immediately and irrespective of the volition or the intention of the parties or their knowledge as to that particular event. Streatfield, J., said in Morgan v. Manser :180 Their own belief and their own knowledge and their own inten- tion is evidence, and evidence only, upon which the court can form its own view whether the changed circumstances were so fundamental as to strike at the root of the contract and not to have been contemplated by the parties. Perhaps the most careful analysis of this theory has been made by Lord Wright, according to whom the theory of the implied condition was not really consistent with the true theory of frustration. The doctrine of frustration was something invented by the court in its inherent jurisdiction in order to supplement the defects of the actual contract ; and that he would prefer to describe it as 'a substantive and particular rule' which the common law had evolved. He specifically said in his speech in a leading case :131 The event is something which happens in the world of fact, and has to be found as a fact by the judge. Its effect on the contract depends on the meaning of the contract, which is matter of law. Whether there is frustration or not in any case depends on the view taken of the event and of is relation to the express contract by "informed and experienced minds". In an extrajudicial utterance Lord Wright was more out-spoken :132 The truth is that the Court or jury as judge of fact decides the question in accordance with what seems to be just and reason- able in its eyes. The judge finds in himself 4he criterion of what is reasonable. The Court is in this sense making a contract for the parties, though it is almost blasphemy to say so. Perhaps the position is, as was observed by the learned Sir David Hughes Parry,133 the doctrine of the implied term had served a useful purpose ; it had enabled the courts, as it were by a legal fiction, to assume jurisdiction to modity or dissolve contractual obligations so as to dispense justice to the parties having regard to the fundamental changes in circum- 130.

When the doctrine of frustration came to be so well established it is no longer needed the fiction of an implied term to support it. So it came generally, but gradually, to be displaced by the theory that a change of circumstances that fundamentally strikes at the root of a contract justifies the imposition by the court of a solution that is just and reasonable in the new circumstances. Indeed, in British Movie- tonews Ltd. v. London &amp; District Cinemas Ltd.,13* Denning, L J , put it in a forthright fashion. He said :135 The day is gone when we can excuse an unforeseen injustice by saying to the sufferer "It is your own folly. You ought not to have passed that form of words. You ought to have put in a clause to protect yourself". We no longer credit a party with the foresight. of a prophet or his lawyer with the draftsmanship of a Chalmers. We realize that they have their limitations and make allowances accordingly. However this view of the learned judge was promptly repudiated on appeal by the House of Lords.18* Their Lordships reiterated the statement of Lord Loreburn that 'No Court has such an absolving power'. The irony of it is that some of the Law Lords, for example Lord Simon and Lord Simonds, still adhered to the old implied term theory. In the circumstances it cannot be said that the theory of 'equitable solution' still holds good. In more recent times the theory of a 'change in the obligation' has come to be more and more generally accepted.137 Lord Radcliffe, who appears to be the author of this theory, in Davis Contractors, Ltd. v. Fareham U.D. Council,1** formulated it in the following words: By this time it might seem that the parties themselves have become so far disembodied spirits that their actual persons should be allowed to rest in peace. In their place there rises the figure of the fair and reasonable man. And the spokes- man of the fair and reasonable man, who represents after all no more than the anthropomorphic conception of justice, is and must be the court itself. So perhaps it would be simp- ler to say at the outset that frustration occurs whenever the law recognizes that without default of either party a con- tractual obligation has become incapable of being performed because the circumstances in which performance is called for . 134.

Non haec in foedera veni . It was not this that I promised to do. It is perhaps fair to say that this is now the more generally accepted view which is, it is submitted, modern in effect but conservative in outlook, for it combines the age-old concept of the 'reasonable man and his standard' and the equitable power of the court exercised in the guise of that 'rea- sonable man of the law'. To attempt to guess the arrangements that the parties would have made at the time of the contract, had they contem- plated the event that has now unexpectedly happened, is to attempt the impossible. Instead, the courts refuse to apply the doctrine of frustra- tion unless they consider that to hold the parties to further performance would, in the light of the changed circumstances, alter the fundamental nature of the contract.139 Yet, can it be said that the English law has finally settled its princi- ples in the matter and that the courts will invariably adhere to the latest, or any one of the theories so far formulated at all? On the one hand the courts appear to be anxious to uphold the strict common law rule that a promisor ought either perform his contract or else pay damages for non- performance, while on the other they could not shut their eyes to the harshness of the rule in situations where performance becomes impossible by the causes which could not have been foreseen, and so provided against by the express terms, and which were beyond the control of the parties. The necessity of evolving one or the other of the theories as appearing to be more rational than the other is to absolve a party to a contract from his obligation in unexpected and fundamentally changed circumstances. Even according to Lord Wright himself no detailed absolute rules can be stated. A certain elasticity is essential.140 Such a difficulty has, however, not to be faced by the courts in India.141 VI. Limitations on the doctrine We may next note some of the limits inherent in the application of the doctrine of discharge of contract by supervening impossibility. In the first place the statute itself makes it clear that the frustrating event ought to be something which the 'promisor could not prevent'.142 139. Tsakiroglou &amp; Co., Ltd . v.

S. 56, paragraph (2) of the Act.</page><page sequence="34">SPECIAL ISSUE : LAWS OF EVIDENCE AND CONTRACT 165 In other words no party can rely upon a 'self-induced frustration'. This aspect has also been judicially stressed in our country as early as in 1907, as the Allahabad High Court said in Ganga Dei v. Asa Ram and Others :143 Section 56 evidently refer to a case in which performance of a contract becomes impossible otherwise than by reason of the default of the promisor. If the promisor himself did some- thing (which presumably includes also an omission as it actually happened in that case) which made it impossible for him to do the act agreed upon, the contract does not become void under section 56. That section does not apply to a case in which the performance of the contract has become impossible in consequence of an act of the promisor himself. This view, which is also quite clear in accordance with the rule of English law, has consistently been taken in subsequent decisions of our courts.144 This much also is clear : the onus of proving that a party was responsible for the frustrating event rests upon the other party,115 but it is not clear in what circumstances a party will be held responsible. It has been said in England that the phrase 'self-induced frustration' does not imply that every degree of fault will preclude a party from claiming to be discharged.146 It has been said :147 The possible varieties (of fault) are infinite, and can range from the criminality of the scuttler who opens the sea-cocks and sinks his ship, to the thoughtlessness of the prima-donna who sits in a draught and loses her voice. I wish to guard against the supposition that every destruction of corpus for which a contractor can be said, to some extent or in some sense, to be responsible, necessarily involves that the resultant frustration is self-induccd within the meaning of the phrase. In that case the appellants chartered to the respondents their steamship Kingswood to proceed to Australia and load a cargo there. Before this could be done, a violent explosion occured in the boilor of the ship which resulted in such a delay as would discharge the contract. The cause of the explosion was never ascertained, but the respondents alleged that the appellants had first to establish that it occured without their fault before 143.

But the House of Lords held that the burden of proving that the event which causes the frustra- tion is due to the act or default of a party lies on the party alleging it to be so. And since the respondents failed to satisfy the court on this point, the contract was held to be discharged. Hence the House Lords has not to decide whether mere negligence of the party would suffice. In a recent decision of the Calcutta High Court, however, the frus- trating event was enemy occupation of the place before certain goods which the defendant had agreed to re-ship from Rangoon to India could be shipped. But the court held that there was negligence on the part of the defendant by which the shipment was delayed and therefore he could not rely upon the supervening impossibility and plead discharge. The court held that if at all, it was a case of self-induced frustration.148 It appears, therefore, that although there have been frequent state- ments to the effect that the frustrating event must have occured without the fault of either party it is as yet not sufficiently clear what is the degree of fault oř the variety of fault to be proved. So also if a party has undertaken to do a thing positively, he cannot, as in England,149 plead subsequent impossibility even if it be due to no fault of his. So it has been held1"0 that the plaintiff-buyer was entitled to recover demages from the seller for non-delivery even if the ship carry- ing the goods to India had been sank and the goods are lost.151 ■ The Supreme Court has also pointed out182 that if the parties do contemplate the possibility of an intervening circumstance which might affect the performance of the contract but expressly state that the contract would stand despite such circumstances, there can be no case of frustra- tion, because the basis of the contract being to demand performance despite the happening of a particulai event, it cannot disappear when that event happens. And the court cited the dictum of Lord Atkinson in Matthey v. Curling .15s namely, that a person who expressly contracts abso- lutely to do a thing not ^naturally impossible is not excused for non- performance because of being prevented by the act of God or the King's enemies...or vis major. In Naihati Jute Mill's case184 the parties had provided that if the buyers failed to provide with an import licence to the seller by December, 1958, then the contract would be settled at the market price prevailing on January 2, 1959. The government refused to provide the requisite licence and when sued by the sellers the defendants 148. Gambhirmull Mahabirprasad v. Indian Bank Ltd., A.I.R. 1963 Cal. 163. 149.

The Supreme Court negativing the plea said:185 Where the contract makes a provision (that is full and com- plete provision, so intended) for a given contingency it is not for the Court to import into the contract some other different provision for the same contigency called by a different name. . There is nothing improper or illegal for a party to take upon himself an absolute obligation to obtain a permit or licence and in such a case if he took the risk he must be held bound to his stipulation. What would be the position if the parties have foreseen the possi- bility of the events which subsequently happen, and had not made any provision to deal with such circumstances? There appears to be some doubt as regards this matter in Indian law. In Surpat Singh v. Sheo Prashad ,1M for example the learned judges said: Before the doctrine of frustration can be invoked it must be shown that the event which has produced frustration was an event which the parties to the contract did not foresee and could not with a reasonable diligence, have foreseen. This dictum has also been quoted with approval and applied in Union of India v. Chanan Singh.167 There the learned judges referred to the decision in Scottish Navigation Co ., Ltd. v. Souter &amp; Co.m where Lawrence, J., said:159 No such condition shall be implied when it is possible to hold that reasonable man could have contemplated the circum- stances as they exist and yet have entered into the bargain expressed in the document. On the other hand the East Punjab High Court in Purshotam Das v. Botala Municipal Committee 160 seems to have held the view that there may be frustration even where the parties have foreseen the events as proba- ble, but have made no express provision with respect to them. The learned court cited the authority of Pollock on Contracts and the case of Tatem v. Gamboa.191 In the latter case it was held that the charter of a ship by the Republican Government of Spain, to evacuate civilians from 155. Id. at 1023. 156. A.I R. 1945 Pat 300 at 304. 157.

And Goddard J. (as he then was) expressly stated that the case "shows in effect that, although the parties may have had or must be deemed to have had the matter in contemplation, the doctrine of frustration is not prevented from applying."162 If the authority of Pollock could be relied upon, the position in England appears to be in accordance with the view held by the East Punjab High Court.163 There is yet another aspect of the problem. Suppose the parties have provided for a contingency whioh in fact occurs but assumes a more fundamental and serious form than perhaps they contemplated. What then would be the position? The answer is that it is a question of construction whether the express provision is intended to be a complete and exclusive solution of the matter in the sense that its object is to govern any form, fundamental or not, that the contingency may take. Unless it is intended to be of this all embracing character, it will not prevent the discharge of the obligation if in the result the effect of the contingency is to frustrate the essential object of the contract. Such at least is the position in the English law though there is no direct decision in India bearing on this aspect16.8® In the leading case of Jackson v. Union Marine Insurance Co., Ltd.1** a ship was chartered in November, 1871, to proceed with all possible despatch, dangers and accidents of navigation exception , from Liverpool to Newport and there to load a cargo of iron rails for carriage to San Fransisco. She sailed on January 2, but on the 3rd itself ran aground in Carnarvon Bay. She was got off by Feb- ruary 18th and taken to Liverpool where she was still under repair in August. On February 15th the charterers repudiated the contract. It was held that the adventure contemplated by the parties was frustrated though the express exception, 'dangers and accidents of naviga- tion,' read literally would have covered the actual accident which had taken place. The finding was that the parties thereby did not intend to cover an accident causing injury of so extensive in nature.166 And again in a more modern case, a contract was made in 1913 by which shipowners undertook to provide charterers with certain vessels in each of the years 1914 to 1918, and it was agreed that if war broke out shipments might at the option of either party be suspended until the end of the hostilities. But after the World War I broke out Rowlatt, J., held that 162. Id at 140. 163. Supra note 74 at 233. 163a. But see Gouri Shankar Agarwalla v. Moi tra, (1921-2) 26 C.W.N. 573.

The suspension clause was not intended to cover a war of such magnitude and effects.186 One thing is clear enough, both in our country and in England, the impossibility referred to under the present head does not in any case include what is called commercial impossibility. The fact that the per- formance has become more onerous or that a party could not make the same extent of gain which he anticipated would not cause discharge. A contract, therefore, to supply freight cannot be said to be frustrated within the meaning of section 56, clause (2) of the Act merely because the freight could not be procured except at an exorbitant price.167 So also it has been held that a contractor for bridge tolls has no legal claim for compensation against the District Board if a considerable part but not the whole of the traffic is prohibited by a government ordinance,168 or if floods make it impossible to use bridge for a substantial part of the contract period.169 In a recent ruling of the Supreme Court it has been said :170 A contract is not frustrated merely because the circumstances in which it was made are altered. The Courts have no general power to absolve a party from the performance of his part of the contract merely because its performance has become onerous on account of an unforeseen turn of events. When after a contract has been made a notification regulating retail prices is passed and that notification does not make the performance of the contract impossible or unlawful, the parties are not discharged from the contract.171 A similar question arose recently in England in Tsakiroglou &amp; Co. Ltd . v. Noblee and Thorl G.m.b.H.172 The appellants agreed to sell to the respondents three hundred tons of Sudan groundnuts at £ 50 per ton c.i.f. Hamburg.

But on the 2nd November, 1956 the canal was closed to traffic and it was not reopened until the following April. The appellants could of course have shipped via the Cape of Good Hope but that would have involved an increase in freight from £ 1' per ton to £ 15 per ton; the delay involved being of no consequence in this particular case. The House of Lords unanimously held that the contract was not frustrated.178 A controversial question so far as the English law is concerned is whether the doctrine of frustration can be applied to a lease of land. Con- siderable judicial conflict was evinced in Cricklewood Property and Investment Trust v. Leightons Investment Trust Ltd .,174 where the House of Lords unani- mously held that the doctrine of frustration, 'even if it were capable of application' to a lease, did not apply in the specific circumstances of the case. But Lord Russell and Lord Goddard, L.C.J. , took a contrary view to that of Lord Simon and Lord Wright, and expressed the opinion that the doctrine of frustration cannot apply to a demise of real property. Lord Porter expressed no opinion on the question. The view that has so far prevailed, at least in the lower court, is that leases are outside the purview of the doctrine of frustration. This is based on the fact that a lease created not merely a contract, but also an estate.175 Thus, in London and Northern Estates Co . v. Schlesinger 176 it was held that the lease of a flat was not terminated by the fact that the tenant had become an alien enemy and was therefore prohibited from residing on the premises. It has also been the view held in England even from the time of Paradine v. Jane (1647). Unless, therefore, until the House of Lords itself decides it otherwise the decisions of the lower courts stand, and the doctrine of frustration is excluded in the case of a lease.177 But it has also another unhappy aspect of it which would not happen in India, as we shall presently see. In Cricklewood' s case, for example, the two Lords who decided against the possibility of the application of the doctrine in a lease was because in such a case the legal estate has passed to the lessee before the occurrence of the frustrating event.178 So regarded as a conveyance of property, the lease creates in the lessee the manifold rights and powers of an owner of an estate in land. Should he also not carry the risks that normally accompany ownership? If supervening 173. In Société Franco Tunisienne ď Armement v. Sicłermar SPA., (1961) 2 Q.B. 278, Pearson, J., held that the route via Cape was so different in several respects from the usual route via the Suez and made the voyage fundamentally different from that contemplated by the contract.

Is it not reasonable that he should carry the risk of supervening events that may reduce or destroy the value of the use of the property? From this view point there is nothing apparently unjust in such a rule. But according to the principles of English law, as evolved by the Courts of Equity, when an agreement to lease, which could only be a contract at common law, is made the intended lessee becomes the owner of the leasehold interest in equity. Broadly speaking, the lessee is in such circumstances in the same position as if a lease had in fact been executed in his favour. Therefore, where the contract is still capable of performance, the lessee, though at the moment entitled only to an equit- able interest, cannot rely upon the doctrine of frustration, even if a frustrating event, short, perhaps, of the complete destruction of the sub- ject-matter before conveyance of the legal estate, happens. The same reasoning would seem to be equally applicable to a con- tract for the sale of land. The sole decision on it is Hiltingdon Estates Co . v. Stonefield Estates , Ltd .,179 where it was so held. On the other hand the law on these points have been clearly laid down by statutes which have been correctly interpreted and applied by the courts in India. So far as leases are concerned they involve a con- veyance and so the provisions of the Contract Act could not in terms apply to an executed conveyance. In Indian cases the doctrine of frustra- tion seems never to have been applied.180 But a mere agreement to lease is only a contract, and no interest in the property thereby passes, and therefore the doctrine is applicable.1800 In a rather recent case the Punjab High Court seems to have laid down the rules succinctly and quite clearly as follows :181 (1) Section 56, Contract Act embodies a positive rule of law relating to the doctrine of frustration and this section is appli- cable only to purely contractual obligations and not to a con- tract creating an estate in land which had already accrued in favour of a party; (2) a contract of lease may be avoided on the happening of an event as contemplated by the terms of the contract which may 179.

This does not amount to dis- charge of a contract by the application of the doctrine of frustration but really amounts to construction of the document and discharge of the same under the provisions of section 32 of the Contract Act; (3) a contract of lease may further be avoided at the option of the lessee on the happening of an event as contemplated under clause (e) of section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act (Act IV of 1882). The avoidance in this case, however, must be differentiated from discharge of a contract by frustration because in the latter case, volition of the parties is not at all material, while under clause (e) the option is that of the lessee. It is submitted that the rules are correct and are in accordance with the relevant statutes, but by 'contract of lease' in rules (2) and (3) above the court ought to have meant 'executed lease'. So also the Calcutta High Court said in Mahadeo Prasad v. Calcutta Dyeing and Cleaning Co.,182 that the doctrine of frustration as enacted in section 56 is subtantially incorporated in section 108 (e) of the Transfer of Property Act. The latter refers to 'destroyed wholly or rendered substantially and permanently unfit', but section 56 of the Contract Act refers to 'an act becoming unlawful or impossible'. Hence the Contract Act covers substantially a wider field than the Transfer of Property Act does. The performance of the duties of a lessor or a lessee may become impossible otherwise than by the destruction of the property; but section 108 (e) of the Transfer of Property Act does not cover those cases. The entire law of frustration is not codified under section 108 (e) of the Transfer of Property Act. The result is that under the Contract Act the contract stands discharged as this is a part of positive law; whereas under the Transfer of Property Act it depends on the option of the lessee. As the Transfer of Property Act is a special provision regarding leases, the general provisions as enacted in section 56 of the Contract Act would not apply to leases. The above said views of the various High Courts have also been fortified by two decisions of our Supreme Court, one in 1968183 and the other in 1971. 184 So it can be safely concluded that the law is well settled in our own country so far as this aspect of the doctrine of frustra- tion is concerned. 182 A.I.R. 1961 Cal. 70. 1 83.

Consequences of frustration It only remains to be seen what are the consequences when the per- formance of the contract has been frustrated. In the first place it has to be noted that the contract is not merely voidable at the option of one or other of the parties; it is brought to an end forthwith and automatically. This has also been clearly laid down by our statute, for section 56 paragraph (2) reads : "A contract to do an act which after the contract is made, becomes impossible, or by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unalwful."185 But the Supreme Court has held in Naihati Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. Khyaliram Jagannath 186 that in cases of frustration it is the performance of the contract which comes to an end but the contract would still be in existence for purposes such as the resolution of disputes arising under or in connection with it. The court said :187 The question as to whether the contract became impossible of performance and was discharged under the doctrine of frus- tration would still have to be decided under the arbitration clause which operates in respect of such purposes. [ Union of India v. Kishorilal , (1960) 1 S.C.R. 514]. This is also the rule established in common law, said Lord Wright:188 In my opinion, the contract is automatically terminated as to the future, because at that date its further performance be- comes impossible in fact in circumstances which involve no liability for damages for the failure on either party. The contract is terminated as to the future only and unlike one vitiated by mistake or minority it is not void ab initio . It starts life as a valid contract» but comes to an abrupt and automatic end the moment that the common adventure is frustrated.189 But it took years for the common law to provide for a just and reasonable adjustments of the rights 185. Quaere : kby reason of some event the promisor could not prevent' appear only before 'unlawful' and not before the word 'impossible'. Does it mean that the doctrine is applicable even if the 'impossibility' as contrasted to any 'illegality' is self- induced ? But as we have already seen self-imposed frustration is never excused. Some decisions have gone to the extent of saying that not only the 'impossibility' should be something which could not have been prevented but ought to be shown to have been not foreseeable at all. 186.

What in effect the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act has done is to modify the earlier common law rules laid down through prior decisions and to bring it almost in conformity with the already existing law in India under the provisions of section 65.191 In general it may be said that the Frustrated Contracts Act has made two fundamental changes iri the pre-existing law in England. First, it amplified the decision in the Fibrosa case192 by permitting the recovery of money prepaid, even though at the date of frustration there has been no total failure of consideration.193. Secondly it allows a party who has done something in performance of the contract prior to the frustrating event to claim compensation for any benefit thereby conferred upon the other. Though the Act goes a long way towards removing the injustice of the common law rules it cannot ¿be said that it has done complete and full justice.194 In India it has been held that the inequitable and harsh rule of Chandler v. Webster 195 would not apply in the face of the provisions of section 65, according to which each party is bound to return any payment and advantage received.196 But the learned authors, Pollock and Mulla197 had expressed the view that full justice could not be done to the parties even under the provisions of section 65 by allowing either party compensa- tion for anything reasonably done, irrespective of any question of any corresponding benefit to the opposite party, unless the courts were pre- pared to take the bold step of applying section 70 of the Contract Act to acts done under an express contract at the time subsisting.198 190. Certain classes of contracts are expressly excluded under it. 191. For detailed provisions of the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act, 1943, see 4 Halsbury9 s Statutes (2nd ed.). 192.

S. 65 does, however, seem to allow the defendant to set off any expenses he has legitimately incurred out of money advanced by the plaintiff, in furtherance of the</page><page sequence="44">SPECIAL ISSUE : LAWS OF EVIDENCE AND CONTRACT 175 In the United States of America more satisfactory rules seems to have been laid down by resort to " Institutionary Remedies". A con- tractor who is discharged from his duty by some form of supervening impossibility after he has already received a performance of value rendered by the other party is legally bound to pay the reasonable value of that performance.199 One who has paid in advance part or all of the price of goods to a seller whose duty to make delivery is discharged by destruction of the goods without his fault can get judgment for restitution of money. In like manner a defendant who has received an advance payment for a performance that now cannot be rendered by him because of the outbreak of war must make restitution. "The American courts had long enforce quasi-contractual duties, following earlier decisions by Lord Mansfield."200 Likewise a plaintiff who has rendered a part performance of value and is then discharged from his duty of completion by some form of impossibility can get judgment for the reasonable value of that part per- formance. Thus one who has contracted to make repairs on an existing building, but is prevented from completing it by the destruction of the building, can get judgment for the reasonable value of his labour and materials so far as they had been incorporated in the building before its destruction.201 The fact that the repairs have been destroyed with the building does not prevent recovery; before destruction they had increased the value of the defendant's property for purposes of both sale and insurance. Similar rules are applicable where a contractual duty has been discharged not by impossibility of rendering the promised performance but by frustration of the principal purpose for which the contract was made. VIII. Conclusion What then is the rationable behind the doctrine ? It ultimately seems to be a question of adjustment of risks inherent in 'human' transac- tions arising by way of contract. When a promisor is held to be discharg- ed from duty by supervening impossibility of his performance, due to the destruction of property or otherwise, although his risk under the contract is thereby lessened, the subdivision of risks is not unfair. He still bears agreement, before it has become void ; Rajendra Bahadur v. Roshan Singh , A.I.R. 1950 Ail. 592 - P deposited cash, ornaments, ind clothes with D for the marriage of P's daughter with D's son. The daughter died before the marriage could take place. P was held entitled to the return of the money and the articles subject to a deduction for legitimate expenses (P did not deny that D was entitled to make such deductions). 199. SeeCorbin, supra note 61. 200. Id. at 985. 201. See Carroll v. Bowersack , 100 Kan. 270; 164 P. 143(1917). It is doubtful whether the builder in such case could recover, follow from the wording in 1(3) of the Frustrated Contract Act, 1943 or s. 65 of the Contract Act. But it is of interest to note that our Law Commission has not suggested any modification to s. 65 vis-a-vis s. 56 (see supra note 22 at 81).</page><page sequence="45">176 JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN LAW INSTITUTE [1972] the risk of loss of property values and the risk of not getting the agreed exchange, namely the price and the expected profit thereof. The other party also bears a risk- the risk of not getting the profit that performance of the bargain would have brought him; on the other hand, he does not bear the risk of having to pay something for nothing; and if he has paid part or all of it in advance he has a right to its restitution. The subdivi- sion of risks is similar when a promisor is held to be discharged by super- vening death or illness, the act of law or government, or other events that frustrate the purposes for which the contract was made.*02 The law of contract is said to be the endeavour of public authority to establish a positive sanction for the realization of "reasonable" expecta- tions arising out of mutual dealings between men of "average rightminded- ness".203 If so, when thus the risks of loss and disappointment are divided between the parties, the subdivision does not give dissatisfaction in the community. The rule, therefore, is a workable one - and it ought to be there- based in part or in whole on existing mores; or, if of pure judicial origin, it is accepted into the developting mores by usage and consent.204 On the whole, therefore, the provisions in the Contract Act relating to the doctrine of frustration have been satisfactory. In spite of the unsatisfactory aspects apparent in the provisions as complained by the learned jurist, Pollock,205 an examination of the judicial process in India ever since 1872 clearly shows that the courts in India had, from the beginning, really understood the essential purport in them, and had been applying them correctly to actual factual situations arising before them for decision. Of course during the period of development of the concept starting from the provisions of the Act, the courts in India as well as the Privy Council itself had to consider at times that the said provisions, especially in section 56, were not exhaustive. True, of late, the Supreme Court has found it necessary to emphasise, time and again, that so far as the courts in this country are concerned, they must look primarily to the law as embodied in sections 52 and 56 of the Indian Contract Act. But has not the Supreme Court itself been influenced by the later rulings of the English and the American courts while readily giving a wider, and a more rational, interpretation to the word "impossibility" appearing in section 56 ? Even otherwise we might still have often refer to such rulings and absorb the spirit in them while dealing with questions in relation to the doctrine in its several ramifications. It is inevitable in any system of law, however perfect it might be. In England, the doctrine of frustration, as we have already seen, was 202. Supra note 61 at 918-9. 203.

Nevertheless it goes to the credit of the members of the commis- sion that they could discern the trends and the ultimate shape it was going to take, and make provisions in the Act accordingly. It had thus been at that stage a definite lead in the matter of legal reform. It is really a tribute to their sagacity and farsightedness that they could shape a concept so as to be in accord with the changing social requirements, and that they could take such a bold lead while in England it took about nearly another century to evolve so satisfactory a result through authorita- tive precedents and by legislation. Even then could the position obtain- ing there be said to be as satisfactory ? On the other hand even while reporting on the Act recently our Law Commission have observed : We are not aware of any occasion when in practice the application of the section (56), as it stands, has involved any inconvenience or difficulty of interpretation and, therefore, we are in favour of leaving the section intact.</page></plain_text>
