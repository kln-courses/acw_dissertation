LUKACS'S VIEWS ON ARTISTIC FREEDOM* Bela Kiralyfalvi** Since Plato banished the poet from his utopian republic, questions of art's autonomy, artistic freedom and the artist's role in society have been subjects of much philosophical and political debate in the western world. Today, when there is a sharp ideological split between the dominant socio-political systems of our world, the debate is particularly lively and certainly more than theoretical. Daily manifestations of peaceful competition, co-existence, cold war, call it what you will, bring constantly into our consciousness-whichever system we are a part of-the fact that there is a living alternative to our present situation. Some artists in democratic capitalism look with envy upon the lavish subsidization of the arts in the socialist countries, while some evidently outstanding artists of the socialist democracies go to prison or seek political asylum in the western democracies. In our increasingly global human community, questions of personal liberty, artistic freedom and economic necessity become convoluted in our minds. A recent cartoon by Mike Peters in the Dayton Daily News touches simply yet poignantly upon some of the fundamental issues. The drawing is of five or six ragged-looking men, women and children carrying tiny bundles on their backs as they climb to the shore of a river they have just crossed. They are Mexican 'wetbacks'. With smiles on their faces as big as any ever flashed by President Carter, they address a stern-faced and decidedly unfriendly looking U.S. border guard who faces them clutching his gun: 'Buenos dias. We are defectors from the Mexico City Ballet Company'. The cartoon is a splendid summary of the extreme complexity of the issues concerning human freedom today. Some of the questions raised by it are pertinent to our discussion here. How deep is the inter-relatedness of personal freedom and artistic freedom? How basic are economic conditions, economic necessities to the realization of any kind of human freedom? Is the freedom or autonomy of art an issue separable from the concept of the freedom of the artists? Faced with such vexing questions, but possessing a global view of the situation, we are tempted to rise above it all and declare that artists of all times and places are endowed with a set of universal and inalienable rights and freedoms. These rights and freedoms, we are likely to maintain, are not alterable and not determined by social and political circumstances. But, is such a position supportable by historical and empirical evidence? Gy6rgy Lukacs, an important Marxist philosopher of this century, believes that such thinking is the sterile fruit of a subjective idealistic world-view, in contradiction with historical reality. It is my intention here to explore Lukacs's ideas on the subject of artistic freedom, with emphasis upon his analysis of the conditions for artistic freedom in modern capitalistic democracies and in the socialist democracies. True to Marxist methodology in the investigation of any question, Lukacs holds the view that in order for us to know 'where we stand' and 'where we are going', we must have a clear historical perspective; we must know 'where we have come *Originally published in The British Journal of Aesthetics, 21, 151-158 (Spring 1981). **Professor of Theater and Drama, Department of Speech Communication, Wichita State University, Wichita, KS 67208, U.S.A. from', what road we have travelled. A prerequisite of any fruitful, direct comparison of the conditions of artistic freedom in the socialistic and capitalistic systems of today must be a brief look at the birth and development of artistic freedom, which in turn can only be seen through at least a sketchy review of the origin and development of art [1]. In the earliest primitive society, Lukaics believes, there are no separate modes of human reflection. What later separate into scientific, religious and artistic modes of reflection, distinctly different from one another, are, at this stage of development, indistinguishable. The primitive ritual contains scientific (utilitarian), religious (magical), as well as artistic (formal) elements. The creator is scientist, priest (magician) and artist all in one, doing what he does for the welfare of the community, for survival. Going from here, the first developmental stage of art consists of the separation of anthropomorphic reflection (art and religion), from disanthropomorphic (scientific) reflection. The second stage is a split within the category of anthropomorphic reflection, that is, the separation of art from religion. Although art had achieved complete autonomy from both science and religion and reached full formal development in ancient Greece-owing to later regressions and the demands made upon it by institutions, dogmas and social classes-to some extent it is still carrying on its 'freedom fight'. We need only be reminded of the demands of the mediaeval Church on the one hand and the scientific expectations of nineteenth- century naturalism on the other, to have unmistakably vivid impressions of serious past encroachments, both in theory and practice, on art's independence from other reflective modes. Briefly stated, the difference between art and science is that 'art creates the world of man, always and exclusively.... In every facet of reflection (contrary to scientific reflection) man is present as a determinant: in art the world outside of man only occurs as a mediating element of human concerns, actions and feelings' [2]. The essential difference between art and religion is that in art 'the reflected image of reality is conceived of as reflection, while magic and religion attribute the status of objective reality to their systems of reflection and require belief in them'. Art, as a fully developed, autonomous mode of reflection, in Lukacs's definition, is the anthropocentric and anthropomorphic reflection of the objective world. While science, as a mode of reflection, is mankind's awareness of the world, art is mankind's self-awareness, but in context of the world (especially the social world) around it. The two modes of reflection together team up in the human quest to conquer the world [3]. Clearly the issue of the freedom of the artist could not have arisen until art itself had reached a high level of autonomy. It is also quite evident in the history of the centuries between the fifth century B.C. and the Enlightenment, that art's autonomy was not always regarded as sacred either in theory or in practice. How did the existing social conditions during these centuries define individual and artistic freedom? In ancient Greece the concept of freedom was first, and most importantly, a social concept. Man was seen as a social animal; his freedom was defined in the context of his society. Secondly, his freedom had external and internal components. The internal component consisted in the individual having control over those of his 124</page><page sequence="2">Lukacs's Views on Artistic Freedom instincts which went against morally justified needs, and the external component was in seeking independence from the constraints of tyrannical society, recognizing that a person can be truly free only in a free society. Freedom here was the freedom of the citizen of a class society, slaves and women were not included: the notion of inherent human equality was not the foundation of this concept of freedom. Later, in feudalist society, freedom either in the classical or the modern sense was unknown. The individual's role was defined for him narrowly, not only as a member of a class (e.g. nobility, peasantry), but also as a member of an order or guild or similar sub-group which determined his restrictions, rights and responsibilities. Moral freedom tended to be limited to the choice between good and evil by standards of external dogma, made in the interest of achieving freedom for the soul in other-worldly salvation. How did these conditions in the past affect the freedom of the individual artist? Lukaics maintains that in all pre-modern societies the artist was more restricted by ties to his society or immediate community than is the modern artist, because art itself was a part of community life and artists functioned without hesitation, in full knowledge of the necessary consequence of this fact [4]. Artists appear to have had a tacit understanding of their social mission and art was almost never merely subjective self-expression. The foundation of the modern concept of freedom is the assumption of the inherent equality of all human beings. The major problem of individual freedom in modern capitalistic society is two-fold: one, the failure of society to eliminate the fundamental economic obstacles to actual equality, and, two, a distinct tendency of the system to alienate the individual human being from his social context. Bourgeois society, according to Lukaics, attempts in fact to define individual freedom completely outside of the social context, except to the extent that the social context is an obstacle, or a limitation, in the path towards individual freedom. In other words, the relationship between individual and society is essentially a negative one, hence, government and laws are often seen as nothing more than necessary evils. Twentieth-century existentialism goes to the extreme by defining individual freedom in complete alienation from society. This, in Lukaics's view, makes the concept of freedom empty: 'If freedom means only what an individual relegated merely to his own resources considers to be freedom in a given moment or situation, then this very abstract generalization destroys freedom: because if everything is free, there is no freedom' [5]. Although Kant, whose philosophy is in large measure the theoretical foundation of the modern concept of freedom, provided a safeguard against the aimlessness arising out of this situation by referring the individual to his conscience-the backbone of the categorical imperative-the concept of individual freedom in the twentieth century has become increasingly that of the moment, the mood and of the uncontrolled instincts. Lukaics cites Hitlerism as the most extreme manifestation of the unbridled expression of the basest human instincts. If the pre-modern artist was not free in the modern sense of the term, what is the nature of the freedom of the artist in modern capitalistic democracy? As we turn to examine the relationship between the modern artist and his society, we find, according to Lukacs, that in contrast with the pre-modern artist who was in direct and fertile contact with his audience, the modern artist, owing to the necessary evolution of the capitalistic economy, is in a substantially different position [6]. For him, the vital contact between artist and community has been severely loosened and sometimes completely eliminated. There is a new sense of freedom never before experienced by the artist, but it is directionless, aimless, without a sense of social mission. The laws of capitalistic economy, capitalistic marketplace, have an unavoidably negative (even dehumanizing) effect upon all individuals, including all artists, living within capitalistic society. Whereas the pre-modern artist knew his audience directly, the modern artist faces his audience very much as any creator of a commodity (merchandise) faces his consumers. His freedom is as unlimited as that of any producer of any product, but in reality he is ruled by the laws of the marketplace. Sometimes fully, other times to a small extent, sometimes the fact is obvious, other times it is hidden beneath deceptive surface factors, but the artist-even despite himself-is always engaged in merchandising. There is no need to belabour this point; the capitalistic, profit-making nature of the enterprises of publishing, film making, the music industry, the television industry, theatre, with their agents, publicity, marketing systems and surveys, are all well known. That amorphous entity, capital, has wedged its way between the artist and the audience to create a distancing and ultimately detrimental barrier. What is important is to see clearly how these conditions have affected the work of the artist. The answer in brief is: adversely. If these determinants characterize the nature of the modern artist's freedom, then that freedom may be more illusory than real. Recognizing the intolerable adversity of their circum- stances, artists in numerous capitalist countries at the turn of the century undertook a variety of efforts-not-for-profit experi- mental theatres, literary journals, literary presses, art exhibits, etc.-to create non-capitalist islands in the powerful sea of capitalism [7]. Soon, however, it became quite obvious that with the proper packaging, merchandising, indoctrination of consumers, every kind of art work-even the most radical in form and content-is capable of being sold, of fetching a good price in the marketplace. With this development not only junk- art, gush, trash, camp, sentimentalism, but also experimental art, the avant-garde, the masterpiece, the classic, all came under at least a strong influence of the laws of the marketplace. Given the help of appropriate capital, new trends and fashions in artistic products could be created in approximately the same manner as fashions in clothing, shoes or motor cars. Nevertheless, it would be an oversimplification to say that this situation has destroyed artistic individuality. In a sense the contrary appears to be true: originality, individual taste, idiosyncratic qualities, peculiarity, stylishness, inventiveness (especially once they are attached to names), have themselves become very marketable commodities. What has this situation done to the artist? For the marginal artist, whose main concern (like a businessman's) is to find a market for his product, this set of conditions dictates quite naturally that he should create what sells. There is literally no limit here from fads, fashions, novelties and idiosyncrasies to gimmicks and pornography. (Particular individuals, of course, often set their personal boundaries.) Entire industries of gigantic size, as we have noted earlier-the film industry, the television industry, the publishing industry, the music industry, etc.-have grown up around the various forms of art. But, more importantly, what has the situation done to the genuine artist? Lukacs believes that there has never been a social system in history to which the artist has related as poorly as to capitalism [8]. The only constant and clearly communicated expectation capitalist society has of the artist is the expectation to produce a saleable commodity that will satisfy an essentially escapist need in the consumer; that will give pleasure similar to that of alcohol or drugs. Lukacs asserts that it is not by accident that bourgeois aesthetics places the aesthetic effect in the realm of the human unconscious and compares it by analogy to the experiences of dream and even intoxication. As the genuine artist realizes that the kind of artistic portrayal of the world which intrudes significantly into the individual's self-consciousness and social consciousness is not expected of him, he becomes increasingly alienated from his society. Alienation, despair, turning inward lead more and more 125</page><page sequence="3">Bela Kiralyfalvi towards the portrayal of the almost purely subjective experience of the artist. It is in this direction, Lukacs believes, that the artist of modern capitalism has nearly unlimited freedom, but as a consequence of his preoccupation with this freedom, he becomes more and more separated from his objective, social environment. Paradoxically, then, even though he is freer from external constraints, laws, censorship than the pre-modern artist, the artist of the modern capitalist democracy is less free to reflect objective, social reality, the anthropocentric portrayal of which, according to Lukacs, is the chief mission of art. His freedom is the subjective freedom of the forlorn individual who alternately cries out in existentialist anguish, protesting at his having been condemned to live in freedom, or declares in manifestos that art is pure 'psychic automatism'; or attempts to return art to the fold of religion-perhaps instinctively recognizing the necessity for direct, communal contact-and turn the artist into a high priest once again. How is the situation of art different in the socialist countries? One would think that with the elimination of the uniquely capitalistic constraints and with at least the start of the creation of a classless society, the situation for art, for the relationship of the artist and the people, would be immediately ideal. Writing about it in the late 1940s and again in the 1960s, Lukacs believes that this is only potentially true [9]. For the present, there are many serious problems. First of all, there is no empirical evidence for him to analyse art in socialism. The existing socialist countries are in fact dictatorships of the proletariat, transitional stages between capitalism and socialism. Citizens and artists of these societies are making an adjustment (in many cases coerced adjustment), which may require several generations to complete, from life in capitalism (sometimes democratic, other times non-democratic, capitalism) to life in socialism. In the process, the individual loses some of his personal freedoms, such as the freedom of capitalistic enterprising, and the artist loses, in addition to his enterprising freedom, much of his purely subjective freedom of expression. The artist, instead of being responsible to the laws of the marketplace on the one hand and the guidance of his alienated subjectivity on the other, is now responsible to the guiding philosophy of the Party. The guiding philosophy of the Party in essence is to bring art and artists once again into direct contact with the people. There is no significant disagreement among Marxists on this basic premise of the guiding philosophy but, as the brief history of the socialist democracies amply demonstrates, there are some basic differences and serious problems when it comes to interpreta- tion and especially to implementation. Recognizing the negative effects of the extremes of Stalinism and similar (so-called 'vulgar Marxist') positions which perceive the role of the Party bureaucratically as the authority which should prescriptively guide artists to deal propagandistically with the immediate social problems of building socialism, turning artists into what Zhdanov called 'engineers of the soul', Lukacs warns against (in fact rejects) externally guided art achieved by means of dogmatic prescription and censorship. Lukacs postulates the basic problem of art in the socialist democracies in the form of a dialectical conflict between two dominant positions, both of which contain extreme demands as well as core elements capable of eventual dialectical synthesis. Narrowly interpreted, the 'art for the people' notion of the Party means that art should concern itself only with the immediate daily problems of the people and advocate solutions from the point of view of the present position of the Party's leadership. The positive, though sometimes unstated, core of this pogition is the desire to bring artists out of their subjective cocoons, off their ivory towers, and back into contact with the reality of the people which is both their subject and audience. The equally narrow-minded opposition to this position, states Lukacs, argues: Yes, bring art to the people, but art is what it is and artists are who they are; therefore, lift the people up to the level of art, so that the people can receive it as it is. If the people prove to be incapable of receiving it in this way, then we will have learned that art is not for the people and should leave the matter at that. The positive core of this position is the desire to preserve the characteristic and indispensable right of art to reflect social reality independently. The positive components of the two opposing positions, Lukacs believes optimistically, will ultimately merge in a union to create socialist art. Meanwhile, the responsibility of the Party, says Lukacs, lies in attempting to convince artists that it is equally to the benefit of art and artists to understand that a complete change in the social foundations (infrastructure) must necessarily be followed by change in the various components of the superstructure. During the transitional state, that is the present, it is up to the artist to work out what this means for art, what directions art may take fully to realize its mission in a new social context. In this fresh, fertile social environment, in this unploughed land, art's role then will be avant-gardist and the role of the artist will be determined not by external, bureaucratic Party guidance, but by self-guidance. At the same time art will be able to fulfil its universal mission: to reflect the objective world anthropo- centrically in every social context. It appears then that Lukacs finds neither the ideal kind nor an adequate amount of artistic freedom either in the capitalistic or the socialistic democracies. Capitalistic society provides the more freedom of the two systems, but the kind of freedom here is almost exclusively subjective and, consequently, art is predominantly self-expression. Modern capitalism, moreover, is seen by Lukacs as a dying socio-economic system, whose superstructure must also necessarily decay. If the situation of art in such contemporary societies is less than ideal now, it can only look forward to further deterioration. Socialist democracies, on the other hand, constitute the beginning stage of the socio- economic order of the future. There is not genuine artistic freedom in these societies today either, according to Lukacs, but the potential for it clearly exists. While presently the distinct tendency of socialist governments is to imprison art in a narrowly conceived utilitarian mould, to use it for the solution of immediate social problems, and the tendency of many artists is to prize their sense of subjective freedom higher than their contact with society, the direction of the future points towards an autonomous art with a self-imposed, deep sense of social mission. As to how soon this synthesis will actually occur is not easily predicted, for in Lukacs's view historical progress comes in the form of two steps forward and one step back. REFERENCES AND NOTES 1.
