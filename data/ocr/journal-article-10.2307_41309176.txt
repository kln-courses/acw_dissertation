<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARJORIE SUSAN VENIT A RECONSIDERATION OF THE "RELIEF OF THE GODS" FROM BRAURON To the memory of Lilly Kahil The sanctuary dedicated to Artemis and Iphigenia at Brauron has yielded remarkable votives, but few prove either so arresting or so provocative as the relief con- ventionally known as the "Relief of the Gods" (pi ii,i)1. An abbreviated version of this article was presented as a paper at the Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America in January 2001 (see the abstract, The "Relief of the Gods" from Brauron, AJA 105, 2001, 267-268). I should like to thank Giorgos Despinis for per- mission to study and write on the relief and the Deutsches Archao- logisches Institut in Athens for providing the photographs of the ob- jects from Brauron. Discussions with Robert A. Bridges, Jr., Evelyn B. Harrison, Caroline Houser, Catherine Keesling, Eran Lupu, Sheri Pak, Linda Roccos, and Eva Stehle have added considerably to this work, but I take full responsibility for the interpretation and conclu- sions presented here.

Travlos, Bildlexikon zur Topographie des antiken Attika (1988) The relief is normally dated about 400 B.C.2, yet even at that time, when votive reliefs had yet to assume the reg- ularity and interchangeability of those that proliferate in the later fourth century, the Relief of the Gods stands apart. Few early votive reliefs are of so high a quality; few approach its great size, which is close to a meter high and, even in its damaged state, over a meter in length3; and few, before the accretion of votive reliefs witnessed by the second half of the fourth century, show figures carved to so great a depth. In contrast to later fourth- century reliefs and many earlier ones, the Relief of the Gods almost certainly avoids depicting votaries; its focus is strictly on a supernatural realm. The size of the relief, its individuality, and the high quality of its execution de- mand for its narrative a specificity beyond the one its current unrevealing name implies, and a reconsideration of the identification of figures on the relief and the re- sulting narrative is the subject of this article. The four figures preserved on the relief were initially identified as Zeus, Leto, Apollo (or Orestes4), and Arte- mis5. More recently, set out in greatest detail in a con- vincingly argued contribution to the festschrift for Alexander Cambitoglou, Lilly Kahil linked a small head 1 Brauron, Arch. Mus. 11 80; see J. Papadimitriou, Prakt 1958, 35-36 and 33 fig. 35; Themelis 1 971, 59. It was found in the stoa between the stylobate and the toichobate opposite the sixth column from the east (see Kahil 1990, 113; for the plan of the stoa see Kondis 1967, 167 fig. 1; J.

Kahil 1990, 113 estimates that the missing section added approximately 65-70 cm, making its original length about 175 cm, but my reconstruction (fig. 1) shows it 1 5-20 cm shorter than her calculations. A major exception is the considerably larger Great Eleusinian Relief, Athens, Nat. Mus. 126 from Eleusis (N. Yalouris - A. Yalouri, EM.rjvixrj Te/vr). AQ/aia Humid [1994] 154 fig. 144; K.

(note 1)35 mentions Orestes as belonging on the relief but not as the figure normally considered Apollo. 5 Themelis 1971, 58; the identification is still the one most often en- countered; see, for example, Yalouris - Yalouri op.cit. (note 3) 159, caption to fig. 1 50 and 258 no. 1 50 which identifies the figures as Zeus and the Delian triad. 44</page><page sequence="2">of similar size and workmanship found near the relief (pi ii , 2)6 and associated it with a figure otherwise lost, whom she identified as Artemis driving a chariot pulled by the stags whose hoofs remain at the relief's broken right edge7. Her addition of a figure in a chariot rational- izes the unusually low placement of the standing figures on the relief ground, since a similarly-sized figure, raised up by its position in the chariot-box, would require the entire vertical space the relief provides. Kahil visualizes the figure originally recognized as Artemis as Iphigenia/Hekate running before the chariot because, by analogy with the reconstruction by Charles Edwards of the running figure from the Eleusis temple pediment, she sees her bearing torches8. In KahiPs inter- pretation, then, the figures would read as Zeus, Leto, Apollo, Iphigenia/Hekate, and Artemis. KahiPs identifi- cation of the running figure as Iphigenia/Hekate and her addition of Artemis in the chariot agrees with what we know about the function of the sanctuary in which both Artemis and Iphigenia played a leading role, but I think that the identification of the figures on the relief can be refined still further and its narrative consequently be- come more finely pointed. Although KahiPs identification of the running maiden as Iphigenia (Hekate) almost demands the youth become Orestes, I think she is correct in retaining him as Apollo. Despite the tangential role played by Orestes in the foundation myth of the sanctuary - it was he who set the wheels in motion with his rescue of Iphigenia from the Taurians - and despite the seeming currency of Euripi- des' "Iphigenia among the Taurians" (IT) probably per- formed for the first time about 413 B.C., the identification of Orestes as the youthful, himation-draped figure is dif- ficult to sustain. First, Orestes in his adventure among the Taurians is normally presented as a young traveler, nude or garbed in a chlamys and a petasos or pilos; sec- ond, and more important, his companion Pylades is an integral part both of the myth and of his Taurian iconog- raphy9; and third, and most important, Orestes has no ties to Brauron. On the contrary, while Iphigenia is sent to establish the cult at Brauron (IT 1463-1468), Euripides (IT 1451-1456) has Orestes install the competing cult and statue of Artemis Tauropolis at nearby Halai Ara- phenides. A himation is not the garment most expected for Apollo either (although it certainly is his occasional dress10), but Apollo normally does wear one when en- gaged in cult, as images from Brauron (pi 12 , 1) and oth- er sites attest11, and - although in the Relief of the Gods, 6 Brauron, Arch.

Apollo belongs with Artemis: they act together and as each other's companion. Apollo almost certainly accom- panies Artemis on fifth-century vases dedicated at Brau- ron. On a red-figured krater fragment from the "heroon of Iphigenia" a female, although unidentified by attrib- ute, is almost certainly Artemis. She holds an oinochoe in one hand and a phiale in the other as she proposes to pour a libation for Apollo, who, clad in a himation and wreathed with laurel, supports a laurel branch with his right hand12. A similar libation scene is preserved in the tondo of a red-figured cup excavated at the site13. Beyond his association with Artemis, Apollo was ap- parently worshiped independently of Artemis at Brauron. Inventories from the site indicate dedications offered specifically to Apollo, and Dina Peppas-Delmousou sug- gests that as protector of young boys he mirrored the func- tion of Artemis14. On a fragment of a red-figured krater, excavated north of the sanctuary15, Apollo sits in front of an altar, which a twig of laurel rests against. The altars site is identified as Brauron by the objects on its plinth - an overturned footed krateriskos, which in shape and deco- ration accords with actual krateriskoi excavated at the site16, and a swath of cloth that must represent one of the dedicated garments mentioned by Euripides (IT 1462- 1467). The fragmentary preservation of the vessel as pub- lished and as displayed in the museum renders the entire narrative unrecoverable: Artemis may have been present, but the himation that reveals the lower legs of the seated figure identifies him as male and the laurel twig confirms him as Apollo. If Artemis is indeed absent from the scene, the dedicatory garment placed before the altar furthers the interpretation by Peppas-Delmousou of Apollo as protec- tor of young boys by suggesting that he received the gar- ments from women who delivered healthy male infants. The standing woman on the Relief of the Gods should be Leto, and this is yet another reason to exclude Orestes from the scene. Her heavy body and veiled head are in- dicative of her age and her rich peplos with its deep over- fold emblematic of her status. The twin deities, with the addition of their mother, form a well-attested triad. As early as the seventh century B.C., the three almost cer- tainly constitute a group in the sanctuary at Dreros on Crete17 and they remain a triad on fifth- and fourth-cen- tury votive reliefs18 including at least one from Brauron 12 Brauron 425 (A 54), by a painter near the Barclay Painter, Kahil 1963, 25 no. 54 and pl. 14, 2; LIMC II (1984) s.v. Artemis 697 no. 1002 (L. Kahil); Kahil 1963, 25 is undecided between Leto, Artemis (be- cause the figure does not hold a bow), and a Muse. A small fragment of the rim and a slight part of the body of a second krater, Brauron A 55 (Kahil 1963, 25 no. 55 pl. 14, 1) shows the wreathed head of Apollo (inscribed) and appears to come from a second vase because of the differences in thickness of their walls (see Kahil 1963, 25). 13 Brauron 109, a fragmentary red-figured cup tondo by a painter near the Penthesilea Painter, LIMC II (1984) s.v.

Although the titular deity of the sanctuary at Brauron is Artemis, on the Brauron votive all three dei- ties equally accept the sacrificial offering. Nevertheless, despite the certainty of the identifica- tion of two standing deities on the Relief of the Gods as Apollo and Leto and even though the reasons for the original designation initially seem strong, the seated fig- ure cannot be retained as Zeus. The pose of the seated figure, with one hand upraised to hold a staff or scepter (here undoubtedly painted on the background) and the other resting on his knee, is found frequently for older male deities20, and three compositional elements might further seem to conspire to influence his identification as Zeus: first, the skillful compositional and aesthetically satisfying detail created by his himation that echoes and interlocks with the peplos of the standing Leto; second, the placement of her elbow that further links the two figures; and third, her back-turned hand that seemingly cups his face. These elements so intimately connect the two that it is not surprising that a close relationship has been accepted since the relief was excavated. Yet, even though the inclusion of Zeus would echo the sanctuary's family function documented by the votaries of men, women, and children that people Brauron's fourth- century votive reliefs21, the group of Artemis, Leto, and Apollo does not admit Zeus22. Like her daughter Arte- mis23, Leto inhabits a world that, Apollo aside, is nor- mally a realm innocent of males. Her world is a woman's world, and her primary identification is as mother: The- ocritos (XVIII 50-51), for example, terms her kouro- trophos. In rare depictions in which Leto is pictured in- dependent of Apollo and Artemis, she is set among oth- er female deities. She is twice paired by Sophilos24 with Chariclo processing to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, Sappho casts her as friend and companion to the weeping Niobe25, and in a painting on marble she is accompanied by her mother, Phoibe26. Leto's occasional assistance at Athena's birth that brings her face to face with her chil- dren's father, Zeus27, seems based solely on her kouro- trophos function28. Therefore, although Zeus is the bio- logical father of Leto's children, he is an absent father; he is never part of the familial group. He has no standing in a scheme that includes the other three deities, nor has he himself any autonomous connection with Brauron. Despite these intellectual reservations to his identity, in all but a single significant way, the seated figure on the Brauron relief certainly conforms to the iconography of Zeus. As a bearded male with a well-muscled but heavy torso, he looks like Zeus. On votive reliefs, Zeus is often depicted seated, occasionally enthroned but sometimes seated on a rocky outcrop or a blocklike seat as is the fig- ure on the Brauron relief; his himation is often draped across his lower body, and although he is rarely invested with specific attributes, like the figure on the Brauron re- 19 Brauron 11 52 (note 11). 20 In the initial mention of the relief (Papadimitriou 1958 op.cit. [note 1] 35), Papadimitriou adds Poseidon as a possible identification of the figure. 21 For example Brauron 11 51 (Kondis 1967, pl. 104 a; Travlos 1988, 72 fig. 77); Brauron 1 1 52 (pl. i2y 1; note 11). 22 A relief from the podium of a scaenae frons from Hierapolis in Phry- gia, dated to the early 3rd century A.D., follows the touching revision- ist version of the childhood of Artemis set down by Callimachos (Hymn 3: To Artemis, 1-39, esp. 4-5) in the first half of the 3rd cen- tury B.C., in which young Artemis, seated on her father's lap, beseeches him to permit her to remain a hunter and a virgin. See LIMC II (1984) s.v. Artemis 719 no. 1262 pl. 550 (L. Kahil). Other representations of Zeus interacting with the young Apollo and Artemis are, at best, un- certain (see LIMC II, 719 nos. 1264-5 55°)- 23 For Leto as mother of Artemis and Apollo see Hesiod, Theog. 918-920; Homeric Hymn to Apollo I 1- 1 39. 24 Athens, Nat.

The sig- nificant difference that sets the figure on the Brauron re- lief apart from representations of Zeus, however, is that the seated Zeus - like other seated deities - is always de- picted on a scale that exceeds that of other figures in the relief29. On late fifth- and fourth-century reliefs, which often reserve much of the slab for votaries, deities are depicted at a far greater scale than those who process to worship them, a disparity that Folkert van Straten interprets in later Hellenistic times as indicative of a physical separa- tion between gods and their worshipers30. Even on a rel- atively early votive relief from Brauron, dating probably to the mid-fifth century, for example, a standing Artemis is depicted significantly taller than her votaries31. Even when these deities are seated, their heads usually appear at a level higher than the heads of their standing mortal worshipers32, and in instances when the crown of the seated deity's head only slightly exceeds the height of the standing worshiper, the absolute height of the deity still greatly surpasses that of the votaries33. Were the deity to stand up, he or she would tower over the worshipers. More relevant to the Relief of the Gods, which ex- cludes worshipers from its scheme, is the same disparity of scale - albeit to some lesser extent - between a seated and a standing deity; the seated deity is normally carved to a scale significantly larger than the standing deities that accompany him or her (see for example/?/. ny /)34. The reason for this visual adjustment is elementary: it is to compensate for the seated position that is, by its very nature, diminishing both psychologically and visually and especially so within an aesthetic that had for cen- turies privileged isocephaly. Yet the seated figure on the Relief of the Gods does not assume this elevated scale normally accorded gods35; the top of his head does not 29 See for example Athens, Akropolis Mus. 2980+2431+2981, a decree relief of 4 1 7/ 1 6 B.C.

Mus. 1778; Svoronos, 632-633 no. 336 pl. CXXXI), in the figure identified as Zeus Meilichios by Svoronos. But the figure on the Athens relief lacks attributes; no name is inscribed, and his straggly hair and beard and the closed, cramped pose he as- sumes argue against his identification as Zeus. He sits on a seat from which the bearded protome of Acheloos protrudes, and I think it much more likely that the figure represents the personification of the Ilissos. H. P. Isler, Acheloos. Eine Monographic (1970) 128 no. 3 5 identifies the figure as Pluton, but in his entry in LIMC (LIMC I [1981] s.v. Ache- loos 24 no. 204) he notes the figure as of uncertain meaning. Demeter, seated on her cista, on a relief dedicated at the Athenian Asklepieion by six doctors (Athens, Nat. Mus. 1332; Svoronos, 247 no. 29 pl. XXXVI 2; LIMC II [1984] s.v. Asklepios 886 no. 313 pl. 660 [B. Holtzmann]) is a rare definite example of a deity that assumes a scale similar to the figure on the Brauron relief. She is, however, female and peripheral to the deities on the relief dedicated to Asklepios. 48</page><page sequence="6">even reach the breast of the standing Leto. His dimin- ished size relative to the other figures that populate the relief sets him apart from them. Therefore the identification for the seated figure on the Relief of the Gods as Zeus is not sustainable. First, Zeus has no place among the other characters depicted on the relief. Second, he lacks any independent status at Brauron that might place him there. Third, his dimin- ished size relative to the other figures in the relief mili- tates against his identification as a god. The seated figure must be a lesser figure than a god, and it is much more likely that he is a personification connected with the site. Topographical personifications were well established by the time that the Relief of the Gods was carved. Among the earliest is Eleusis, who localizes the scene on the skyphos, dated ca. 490-80 B.C. and attributed to Makron, that depicts the departure of Triptolemos36. Al- most as early are the first certain anthropomorphic de- pictions of rivers, in the form of Strymon and Okeanos, who flank the apple tree in the Garden of the Hesperides on a pointed amphora by the Copenhagen Painter (Syriskos)37. Rivers are the most common geographic systems that are early personified as male, but cities, too, although usually depicted as females - the gender of their name and their consequent personification pre- sumably following that of the noun Jtofag - could also be shown as male. Taras, although as son of Poseidon a river god38, is also the mythical and eponymous founder of Taranto, and the personified hero was in- cluded in a group dedicated in the early fifth century by the Tarentines at Delphi39. Also at Delphi, still in the first half of the fifth century, a great statue of Salamis depict- ed as a man holding a ship's prow was set up - by all the Greeks - to commemorate the victory over the Per- sians40. The eponymous hero of Marathon, a site geo- graphically closer to Brauron than Taranto or even Salamis, was depicted in the painting of the Battle of Marathon in the Stoa Poikile in the Athenian Agora41. And more cogently insofar as the sanctuary of Brauron is concerned, Mounichos, the eponymous hero and the founder of the cult of Artemis Mounichia in the Piraeus, a sister cult to that of Artemis at Brauron, is seen on a squat lekythos by Aison42. On the vase by Aison, Mounichos is depicted as a youthful Greek warrior, an image that bears only a sim- ilarity of gender to that of the seated figure on the Relief of the Gods. But two other male city personifications are much closer in conception to ours. One is on a doc- ument relief, which depicts the dexiosis of Athens and 36 London, Brit.

The eponymous hero Kios - accord- ing to Strabo (XII 4, 3) the companion of Herakles and the founder of the city that bears his name44 - is repre- sented as an older, fully draped, bearded male, although, as Carol Lawton observes, in the "somewhat smaller scale often used in document reliefs for heroes and per- sonifications"45. A male city personification visually even closer to that of the Brauron figure is Korinthos, repre- sented with his name inscribed on a fourth-century bronze mirror said to have been discovered at Corinth (pl. 12 , 2 J46. Korinthos was considered by the Corinthians the son of Zeus, whose kingly demeanor he assumes on the mirror but, Corinthian claims aside, Korinthos, like Eleusis, has no true mythical identity. The seated figure on the Brauron relief fits well into this category of male geographical personifications. Like most personified rivers and Korinthos, he is an older, bearded, half-draped male and, like Korinthos, he re- sembles Zeus, although he certainly lacks the Olympian deity's regal presence. Despite these resemblances, as Lawton has noticed for heroes and personifications on decree reliefs, the Brauron figure is depicted at a scale that is considerably smaller than that normally accorded _a deity. Geographical systems that are connected with the sanctuary at Brauron include the deme Philaidai in which the town and sanctuary were located and the Erasinos River that bounds the western edge of the site. But nei- ther of these geographical systems seems likely as an identification for the seated figure. Philaios, the epony- mous hero of Philaidai and variously the son of Aias or Mounichos, has a complex mythical identity47, but no textual source connects him with the sanctuary at Brau- ron. And although as a river the Erasinos might boast a strong lineage for personification, no evidence preserves its representation, and the iconography of the seated figure does not especially follow that of rivers: he wears neither the type of coiffure nor the horns that river per- sonifications often assume. The third possibility for the identification of the seated figure is the most obvious and therefore by far the most likely - that is, that he is the personification of the site itself. The sanctuary is that of Artemis Brauronia; Brauron is the only geographical name indication inscribed on materials from the site48; following the paradigm of Marathon49, Brauron should be a place name with a masculine gender; and, most telling, the name of the hero Brauron and his connection to the sanctuary are recorded by three late lexicogra- phers, all of whom observe that Artemis received the epi- thet Brauronia from the site where she was especially worshiped and that the site received its name from its toponymous hero, Brauron50.

The marked difference between the figure of Brauron on the Relief of the Gods and most other male topo- graphical personifications is that Brauron is used as an unmistakable designation of place. Marginalized at the edge of the scene, like Eleusis on the Makron skyphos, and disengaged from the vertical rhythm established by the other figures, he functions to denominate the spot as Brauron, unequivocally indicating the location of the ac- tion of the relief. The identification of the seated male as Brauron also helps justify his physically close connec- tion with Leto. By means of both the placement of her hand and elbow and the treatment of her garment - which reiterates the form and interlocks with his - that visually bind the two figures, the sculptor uses the figure of Leto to link all the figures - themselves composition- ally tightly bound together - to the land, to the sanctu- ary, and to the topos of Brauron. The identification of the seated figure on the Relief of the Gods as the sanctuary's eponymous hero heightens the singularity of the relief, imbuing it with an addition- al layer of meaning. By providing the relief with an im- mediacy of locale and anchoring the action of the scene at Brauron, the figure of Brauron rescues the cognitive content of the image from a generalized assembly of deities reflected in its modern name, Relief of the Gods, and reveals it as a moment specific to the history of the sanctuary. A reconsideration of the missing attachment in the hand of Apollo, but especially those missing from the hands of Iphigenia, adds further specificity and an even greater depth of meaning to the relief, which its dis- tinction as an exceptional votive demands. In her reconstruction, Kahil termed the running maiden Iphigenia/Hekate, since she imagined that she bore a torch in each hand51. But the figure should revert to Iphigenia, because in reality, a torch in either hand of the running figure is difficult to restore. First, even a short torch held in her left hand, which is raised to her eye level, would almost certainly extend beyond the top edge of the relief, which, though plausible, is not an en- tirely satisfactory solution. Still less persuasive is imag- ining a torch carried in a hand raised well above shoul- der height; in this position all its not inconsiderable weight is borne by the muscles of the upper arm, a pose Greek artists also normally thought too difficult to sus- tain. Last, and least subjective of my objections, are the cuttings in the stone. The hole drilled through the fig- ure's left hand is only 0.7 cm at its greatest diameter, which is at the bottom, and it is considerably smaller at the top. Both diameters obviate the insertion of a torch of any normal width, as does their relative size, which is antithetical to torches that generally taper toward the bottom. Iphigenia's lowered right hand falls into a position more likely to hold a torch, although normally the el- bow is held closer to the waist to support the torch's weight, rather than semi-extended as it is here. But the drillhole here too presents problems. First, the hole is drilled at a slightly upward angle, but it is still nearly perpendicular to the ground of the relief. A torch placed in that hole would project slightly upward but much more sharply outward toward the viewer, creating a dramatic but idiosyncratic attachment that would ex- tend its entire length beyond the front plane of the relief and into the ambulatory of the stoa at Brauron in which the relief was set. Second, and more telling, is again the size of the attachment hole. Drilled at a consistent 1 cm in diameter, this hole is larger than the first. But though slender torches may occasionally be seen on vases, and terracotta plaques from Brauron show Artemis holding what appears to be a slender stick52, votive re- liefs that bracket ours in date show torches whose diam- eter would not permit their insertion in so narrow a fjgcuog ovtoj xaXovjusvov ... - There is no evidence for the cult of Brauron at the site, but other Attic heroes also exist with no known cult (see Kearns op.cit. passim , in which a number of Attic heroes are noted as having no known cult). 51 On the basis of the reconstruction of a Hekate by Edwards op.cit.

Furthermore, Iphigenia's both hands are fisted, and torches shown in sculpture, because of their normal ample thickness, virtually always force an opened hand. The hole drilled completely through his lowered left hand indicates that Apollo also once held an attachment. The drillhole is similar to the one in Iphigenia's left hand; it is wider at the bottom than the top so, if Apollo did in- deed hold something, it was an object that broadens as it leaves his hand. Although a recurved bow would fit the criteria governed by the hole (with the other half of the bow imagined as extending toward the background), and although it is correctly Apollo's left hand that holds the object, I think a bow is out of the question given Apollo's cultic garb. There is no reason for a bow, no real room for one, no quiver for one, and no arrows for one. I can imag- ine, however, that he might clasp a few twigs of laurel, much like the one painted against the altar at which he sits on the red-figured fragment from Brauron54. Unlike the other two attachment holes, the hole in Iphigenia's right hand is not drilled completely through the stone55; instead, it forms a shallow cylinder with a flat bottom that looks ready to accept a rather narrow cylin- drical object. I can imagine two objects that would fit the constraints the hole presents, but reconstructing either one requires that Artemis relinquish her role as chario- teer with which Kahil invests her. Nevertheless, I think Iphigenia's raised left hand also demands the same con- clusion and solidifies the view that Artemis herself does not drive the stag chariot. First, I think it beyond question that Iphigenia holds the chariot's reins in her upraised left hand (fig. i). Four metal reins would fit through the narrow hole near her thumb and their splaying out - as I have reconstructed them - would necessitate (and thereby rationalize) the widening underside of the hole. The proximity of Iphi- genia to the stags' forehoofs - and of her left hand to the spot where their heads must be - indicates that she holds the reins fairly close to the halters of the stags, as would be necessary in order to control the feral team; thus, she would have the remainder of the chariot reins to contend with, and their ends could be fitted into a plug set into the hole in her left hand. The reins would then swing across her body reiterating the rhythm set by the draping of Apollo's himation and strengthen the composition by tying together its two otherwise disparate parts. An alternate suggestion would place a goad56, formed of a short cylindrical handle and a thin bronze strip or strips, in Iphigenia's lowered right hand. Conceptually this idea has merit. A goad fits the drill hole without the necessity of postulating a plug, and the whip's ends would respond to the form of the laurel twigs held by Apollo. Iphigenia's right hand is certainly the correct one for a goad and, in this case, the reins would simply hang straight down from her upraised hand. Compositionally, though, I much prefer the great curve that the reins would describe were the ends held in Iphigenia's lowered hand, and that is the way I have restored them. Choosing either of these substitutions for the torches, however, requires a change of narrative. In either case, Iphigenia controls the chariot and Artemis becomes its passenger. Therefore, I propose that the identification of the figure in the chariot recognized by Kahil as Artemis be extended to incorporate the statue of Artemis. Since the head associated with the relief (pi n , 2 ) indicates that the statue is not depicted as an archaizing one, it cannot be the "old wooden statue" of Artemis that is borne in the chariot. Instead, the stag chariot would be under- stood as conveying the statue of Artemis in the form of the deity Artemis. Indicated as a statue only by her pas- sive position in the chariot, Artemis at Brauron would be seen both as a statue and as the deity participating in the 53 Compare for example the relief from the second quarter of the 5th century with Artemis and votaries (Papadimitriou 1961 op.cit.

In that way, she is similar to a representation of Artemis on an Apulian red-figured volute krater in Naples57. The Artemis on the krater, which is defined as a statue by her placement on a base, nevertheless shades her eyes with her hand to better sight the encroaching Furies that beleaguer Orestes seeking refuge at the altar; the image on the vase is at once a statue and the deity her- self. In the Relief of the Gods, Iphigenia would be trans- porting this syncretic form of statue and deity, also rep- resented in a single figure, to an installation at the site. This revision that reconstructs Iphigenia conveying the deity Artemis in the form of the statue of Artemis to Brauron necessitates that the scene depicted on the relief portray the foundation of the sanctuary. The version is not that set out by Euripides in "Iphigenia in Tauris" in which Orestes brings the Taurian statue to Halai, but an alternate Attic tradition preserved in Pausanias (1 33, i) in which Iphigenia brings the statue to Brauron (a tradition he later doubts [III 16, 8], privileging instead the sanctu- ary of Artemis Orthia in Sparta). Like the red-figured vases that depict Eleusis58, the pointed amphora showing distant rivers59, and the mirror found at Corinth portraying Korinthos (pi 12 , 2J60, the Relief of the Gods is a private artifact that serves a pub- lic function. Unlike these other objects, however, the Re- lief of the Gods was on public view. It was set up in a prominent area of the sanctuary near the stoa61 which, when the relief was erected, was of relatively recent con- struction, and - even if the gymnasium and the palaistra known from a third-century B.C. inscription from the site62 were contemporaneous - was one of the largest buildings on the site. The prominent position of the re- lief, its size and high quality, and the specificity of its nar- rative imply that its subject had a special meaning.

Artemis 729 no. 1377 and fig. on 729). Torches are a normal attribute of Artemis (see, e.g., LIMC II, 654-660, "Artemis dadophore"); at Brauron Artemis carries torches, e.g., on Brauron 1 1 52 (see note 11) and Brauron 1182 (LIMC II, s.v. Artemis 658 no. 463 pl. 483). The spear provides a vertical element that neatly finishes off the composition and responds to the staff that the figure of Brau- ron must have held in his upraised hand. 58 London, Brit.

From the intrigues of the exiled Alcibiades that ended the Peace of Nikias in 412 B.C. through the cessation of the Corinthian War in 387/6, Athens was at odds with Sparta. Its defeat by Sparta in 404 after the protracted Peloponnesian War blighted Athenian pride and ended Athenian dreams of empire, and the subsequent reign of the Thirty Tyrants supported by a Spartan garrison insti- tuted an oligarchy writing its decrees in blood. After the overturn of the Thirty, Athenians continued military en- gagement with Sparta: the Athenian Konon, who had been in Persian service since 405, was commissioned in 397 to command a newly formed Persian fleet augment- ed by Athenian sailors, and his victory over Spartan forces at Knidos in 394 buoyed the hopes of Athens and its allies, which declared a war against Sparta that lasted until 387/6. In the waning decade of the fifth century and the opening of the fourth, everyone in Athens must have had relatives and friends martyred for Athenian democ- racy or dead at Spartan hands. The account preserved by Pausanias implying competition between Athens and Sparta for the statue of the Taurian Artemis reiterates the conflict between the city-states, and any hint of Spartan usurpation of the statue central to the cult would have further provoked a patriotic Athenian. Much as the pri- vate Makron skyphos implies Attic dominion over the Eleusinian sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone, the Relief of the Gods validates an Athenian claim to the Taurian statue of Artemis. If the account preserved by Pausanias had currency in late fifth-century Athens, it would have provided the strongest motivation for the dedication of a votive relief with so specific a subject as that seen on the Relief of the Gods.

LIST OF FIGURES Fig. 1 Proposed reconstruction of the Relief of the Gods. Draw- ing by author. 54</page><page sequence="12">ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Figuren, die auf dem «Relief der Gotter» aus Brauron erhalten sind (Taf. //, j), wurden urspriinglich als Zeus, Leto, Apollon und Artemis angesehen. Spater konnte Lilly Kahil noch einen Kopf beiziehen, der in der Nahe des Reliefs gefunden worden war ( Taf n , 2 ). Er ge- hort zu einer Figur, die von der abgebrochenen rechten Seite der Reliefplatte stammen muss. Kahil identifizierte sie als Artemis, die einen von Hirschen gezogenen Wa- gen lenkt (Hufe der Hirsche sind am rechten Bruchrand des Reliefs noch erhalten); die ehemalige Artemis be- nannte sie in Iphigeneia/Hekate um. In diesem Aufsatz wird gezeigt, dass die sitzende Ge- stalt links nicht Zeus sein kann; es muss sich um Brauron handeln, den eponymen Heros des Ortes. Iphigeneia/ Hekate ist als einfache Iphigeneia anzusehen, denn die Fackeln, die Kahil in ihren Handen rekonstruierte, sind nicht iiberzeugend nachzuweisen. Iphigeneia halt viel- mehr die Ziigel des Wagens. Damit kann freilich Artemis nicht die Lenkerin sein. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen, dass in der Figur im Wagen die Gottin Artemis als Statue gesehen werden soil (vgl. Abb. 1 im Text). Zusammen le- gen diese Umdeutungen nahe, dass das Relief die Griin- dung des Heiligtums von Brauron darstellen sollte, und dass es angesichts seiner Entstehungszeit um 400 v. Chr. spartafeindliche Stromungen verkorpert. (Ubersetzung Redaktion) RfiSUMfi Les personnages representes sur le relief fragmentaire de Brauron appele «Relief des dieux» (pi 11, 1) avaient, dans un premier temps, ete identifies a Zeus, Leto, Apol- lon et Artemis, avant que Lilly Kahil ne rapproche et n'integre a la scene, dans sa partie droite manquante, une tete isolee qui avait ete mise au jour non loin du fragment principal (pl. 11 &gt; 2). Lilly Kahil vit dans ce personnage une Artemis conduisant un char tire par des cerfs; en ef- fet, des restes de sabots sont visibles pres de la cassure. En consequence, elle reinterpreta la figure prealablement identifiee a Artemis comme Iphigenie/Hecate. L'etude publiee ici propose une nouvelle identification des personnages. La figure assise dans la partie gauche du relief ne peut etre Zeus: il doit s'agir de Brauron, heros eponyme du site. Quant au personnage d'Iphigenie/ Hecate, il doit etre considere comme une simple Iphige- nie. En effet, les torches attributes par Lilly Kahil a ce personnage sont quasi impossibles a integrer dans la composition. C'est pourquoi on avancera Phypothese qu'Iphigenie tenait plutot les renes des cerfs de Pattelage et que, par consequent, Artemis n'etait pas la conduc- trice du char mais qu'elle etait vehiculee sur ce meme char sous la forme d'une statue (voir fig. 1 dans le texte). Compte tenu de ces elements, il est possible d'interpreter la scene tout entiere comme une representation evoquant la fondation du sanctuaire de Brauron, un theme qui, etant donne la date de Pexecution vers 400 avant J.-C., ne devait pas etre denue de sentiment anti-spartiate.
