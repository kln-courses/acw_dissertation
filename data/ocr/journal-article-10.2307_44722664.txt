Melvin and Kathleen Weber University of Michigan College of Engineering ABSTRACT A sensor is described that can continuously monitor intrusion and associated pressure in the abdominal area of a child dummy. A prototype device was installed in a Part 572 3-year-old dummy and used in a series of dynamic tests with a variety of child restraint systems. The sensor was able to discriminate among different restraint configurations over a range of 0 to 55 psi. The performance differences observed, in terms of peak pressures and pressure-time -waveforms, were further evaluated in relation to dummy kinematics and restraint system construction. IN PREVIOUS WORK, we have referred to various gaps in FMVSS 213, Child Restraint Systems, that may result in innovative designs that inadvertently place a child at some risk of injury not before seen with traditional restraint configurations [1,2]. 1 One of these gaps is the lack of a measuring tool to assess abdominal injury potential from excess loading and/or penetration. The biomechanical response and injury tolerance of the abdomen have recently been extensively reviewed [3], and the findings have been used to develop specifications and design concepts for a future adult anthropomorphic dummy [4]. The general mechanism of blunt abdominal trauma appears to involve deformation or intrusion into the soft abdominal region along with significant force or pressure being generated within the deformed organs. Recent studies have shown that the rate of deformation is also important in abdominal trauma [5]. A fluid-filled system that would deform under impact loading and continuously measure the pressure generated within the system could be used to indicate injury potential in this region of a dummy. In the study reported here, a simple version of such a sensor was developed, installed in the abdominal area of a Part 572 3-year-old child dummy, and used in dynamic impact tests to compare the performance of various child restraint configurations currently on the market. No attempt was made to establish an injury threshold using this prototype device, but some analyses of dummy 1 Numbers in brackets indicate references at the end of the paper. kinematics and restraint construction were performed to investigate the validity of the discriminations made by the sensor. SENSOR DESIGN Design goals for the abdominal intrusion sensor were as follows: (1) indicate if abdominal intrusion occurred; (2) allow continuous measurement of abdominal intrusion and the severity of the resulting loads; (3) indicate the volume extent of abdominal intrusion; (4) interfere only minimally with the basic design features or dynamic response of the Part 572 3-year-old dummy; and (5) provide a repeatable and easily measured output. Previous techniques to assess abdominal intrusion involved the use of permanently deformable materials, such as crushable plastic foams, modeling clay [6,7], or bubble film [8], placed in the dummy abdomen. These methods indicated the occurrence of intrusion and its maximum extent. Recently, a dummy abdomen design suitable for injury assessment in lateral impacts was developed by Maltha and Stalnaker [9]. The design consisted of a rigid core covered by a composite elastic foam material giving stiffness characteristics similar to the adult cadaver abdomen in lateral impact. The rigid core provided a penetration limit at a previously determined critical tolerance level. Coded contact switches, located between the foam and the rigid core, were activated by springs when a specified load was exceeded. This design is suitable for side impacts where the dummy torso strikes planar door structures with little or no lateral torso bending. In frontal impacts, however, where torso bending is common, the rigid support structure would interfere with the response of the dummy torso as it flexed over the restraint system. Thus, the design concept would not meet the goals of the present application. The sensor developed for this study, to be used for child restraint system evaluation, consists of a continuous length of fiber-reinforced rubber tubing (0.40-in inside diameter with a 0.14-in wall thickness), which is wound in six overlapping loops around the dummy lumbar spine, as shown in Figure 1. The loop design is intended not to 2.732 0096-736X/87/9502-0732$02.50 Copyright 1987 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">860370 Air Filler ' ' Tube ' I f Cylinder ' ' &gt;?,-£] "TV Reinforced Eja T" Tut"na Figure 1. Abdominal intrusion sensor. interfere with the bending stiffness of the lumbar spine itself. These loops are held in a fixed relative position with nylon lacing and are wound such that the two ends of the tube lie at the lower rear of the lumbar spine. The ends are connected to a 0.5-in copper tubing Y-manifold that leads to a vertically oriented piston/cylinder along the back of the dummy. The bore of the cylinder is 0.634 in, and the piston, which is cup-shaped, has a maximum available stroke of 1.50 in. The volume beneath the piston, consisting of the cylinder, manifold, and tubing, is filled with water. The upper end of the cylinder is capped with a port for pre- pressurizing the volume above the piston with air and another port for continuously measuring the air pressure with an Endevco 8510-B-100 piezoresistive transducer. The cup shape of the piston provides a residual volume of 0.1135 in3 in the piston in order to keep excessive air pressures from being produced if the piston reaches the upper end of the cylinder bore. The overall length of the cylinder and manifold is 7.5 in. The principle of operation of the transducer relies upon the general inextensibility of the fiber-reinforced rubber tubing. As the tubing is trapped between the lumbar spine and the intruding surface, the fluid in the tubing is forced to flow into the cylinder and move the piston against the air-pressure chamber. The mechanical response of the transducer system to an impact load applied to the abdomen is determined by (1) the bending stiffness of the tubing wall, (2) the volume extensibility of the tubing, (3) the flow resistance through the tubing and plumbing into the cylinder, (4) the threshold pressure level acting on the sensor piston, and (5) the mechanical characteristics of the dummy abdominal foam overlayģ The standard dummy torso foam was used without modification. This, in combination with the added tubing, resulted in an increase in abdominal depth from 5 to 6 inches, which is consistent with the 6-inch average abdominal depth measured in actual seated children age 2.25 to 3.75 years [10]. Early development tests led to a concern that the piston and its underlying fluid column could be moved by the high acceleration environment of a restraint system test. Accordingly, initial static pressure of 4 psi was introduced into the upper end of the cylinder to prevent it from moving, in the absence of actual abdominal intrusion, unless a chest I-S acceleration of 40 G were exceeded. A baseline sled test was also performed with the dummy sitting backward against a rigid support to ensure that there were no other fluid inertial loading sensitivities. Finally, rubber tubing with a flexible but inextensible wall was chosen to provide maximum load transmission to the fluid, and the plumbing into the cylinder offered very little restriction to fluid flow. Following the developmental testing of the transducer system, a standard procedure for using the sensor was established. Before each test, the system was overpressured to ensure that the piston was all the way to the bottom of its bore. Then a static pressure of 4 psi was carefully provided for inertial loading stabilization. The static pressure was also checked following each test and always found to be very close to the pretest level. The pressure data recorded during the test and reported here considered the 4-psi pretest pressure as the zero level. The pressure measurement made by the transducer is indicative of the degree of intrusion of the abdomen, because the pressure in the cylinder is a function of the movement of the piston as it compresses the air above the piston. This information is also indicative of the force of penetration, because the peak pressure measured by the transducer is essentially the average pressure acting on the tubing walls at maximum intrusion. Although this intrusion sensor seems to mimic the effect that a loading surface might have with an abdominal region, the dynamic response of the system has not been evaluated for its biomechanical realism. It is intended at this stage in its development to only indicate relative levels of intrusion among different restraining configurations. TEST METHODOLOGY A series of thirty sled tests was conducted to gain information about the interaction of the 3-year-old dummy with a wide range of restraint configurations, with particular emphasis on the abdominal area. In addition to the abdominal sensor described above, the dummy was equipped with a triaxial accelerometer in the chest. No head accelerometers were used, but head excursions were measured from high-speed films of the tests. The test severity was nominally 30 mph (range 29.2 to 30.9) and 20 G (range 20.3 to 20.9), and the test environment was that of FMVSS 213. 2.733</page><page sequence="3">The restraint configurations, preceded by the coding used in this report and followed by the quantity of each type tested, are as follows: LC Lap belt only, correct placement (2) 5P Five- point harness' convertible child t restraint (3) BB Booster with lap/shoulder belt (1) BH Booster with tethered harness (1) HS Harness/shield convertible child restraint (7) FS Full shield booster (1) PS Partial shield2 booster or convertible child restraint (13) LM Lap belt only, misplaced around waist (2) The lap belt and five-point harness tests were used as baseline indicators of known satisfactory (LC, 5P) or unsatisfactory (LM) restraint performance. We know from field experience, for instance, that a properly placed lap belt or properly adjusted five-point harness will restrain a child without abdominal injury. We also know that a misplaced lap belt can induce serious injury to the internal organs in this area. Thus we have two ends of a spectrum within which to evaluate other restraining systems for which there is less field experience. At the same time, we wish to emphasize that we have not received any reports of actual crashes that would indicate abdominal injury problems with any of the boosters or convertible child restraints tested. RESULTS Test results given in order of peak abdominal pressure within each restraint group are presented in Table 1. Figure 2 shows both the average peak pressure for each group (bars) as well as the distribution of peaks for all individual tests (diamonds). In some cases, two samples of the same PS model were tested. To calculate the overall PS average, results from these pairs were first averaged and that result averaged with the single-sample test results. Also included in Table 1 are the chest resultant accelerations and the head excursions. Because the dummy kinematics have been altered somewhat with the installation of the abdominal sensor, these last two measures may not be the same as would result from a test with an unmodified Part 572 3-year-old dummy. The values do, however, provide additional means of comparing and evaluating the relative performance of the restraint systems. Figures 3 and 4 plot abdominal pressure versus chest acceleration and head excursion, respectively. With the exception of two partial shields, which were higher and vertically stiffer than the other models, the PS and LM tests were all over 20 psi, while all other restraints measured under 12 psi. Figure 3 also indicates that, as a group, the PS/LM tests gave lower chest accelerations than the others, but the latter were still under the 60-G limit. Head excursions (Fig. 4) did not seem to be related to restraint configuration or, therefore, abdominal pressure, except that the two tests using the original (no shield) 2Partial shield is defined in this paper as a fixed or movable surface intended to restrain the 3-year-old dummy in a frontal crash test, but which does not provide direct forward restraint for the shoulders and head.

The dummy kinematics were also analyzed for these runs as well as for a five-point harness test (8542) and a harness/shield test (8538), the abdominal pressures of which were too low to show up on the plot. This group of runs was selected for its range of abdominal pressures and the similarity among the head excursions of five of the eight tests. Figures 6 and 7 show the position of the dummy at maximum head excursion for the five-point harness (29.5 in) and the harness/shield (30.0 in) tests.

Figures 8 and 9 show the dummy positions at three instants during tests of partial- shield boosters that generated moderate and high abdominal pressures. The first position in each case corresponds to the initial peak for each test shown in Figure 5. The second position in Figure 8 corresponds to the second peak, and the second position in Figure 9 corresponds to the end of the drop-off and beginning of the low plateau. The final positions show the maximum torso bending around the shields experienced by the dummy. Maximum head excursions for these two tests were identical (30.0 in), and overall kinematics were very similar, but the abdominal pressure of one was significantly more severe than the other. This difference can be explained by differences in shield construction, as will be discussed below. Figure 10 shows the maximum torso bending around the full shield, which resulted in a significantly lower abdominal pressure than nearly all the partial shields. A partial shield that registered a lower pressure is displayed at maximum bending in Figure 11. Careful examination of the films indicated that the dummy pivoted about the chest, and the abdomen swung back and away from the shield during impact. Finally, Figure 12 shows the maximum torso bending of a partial shield test with high abdomimal pressure but a lower head excursion (26.4 in). Shield construction is also a factor here. 2.735</page><page sequence="5">Figure 6. Dummy position at maximum excursion in five-point harness restraint (8542). Figure 7.

DISCUSSION The abdominal intrusion sensor developed in this study appears to be able to discriminate between two general groups of restraint configurations. The group yielding low pressure measurements includes correct lap belts, five-point harnesses, boosters with belts or harnesses, harness/shield combinations, and the full-shield booster. With the exception of the lap belt, which is strictly a pelvic restraint, all the other configurations have in common some type of upper torso restraint. This is in the form of shoulder straps, or, for the full shield, a broad deformable surface that extends beyond the dummy's head. Such upper torso restraint restricts the dummy's bending motion as well as the inertial load transmitted through the lower torso restraint and thereby does not allow any significant load or penetration to occur in the abdominal area. This is the case despite the fact that some of the HS designs have quite narrow shields positioned in front of the dummy abdomen, and the fact that the post-test position of the lap belt used with the tethered-harness booster (BH) appeared to indicate some submarining (Figure 13). The abdominal sensor, however, showed that no significant intrusion occurred. Nearly all the low or partial shields which do not provide much if any upper torso restraint, comprise the group yielding moderate to high abdominal pressure measurements. Not only did the dummy double tightly over these shields, but the initial loading interaction was with the area above the dummy's "pelvic bone." Note that the inertial forces associated with extreme body bending do not alone result in restraint-system intrusion into the abdomen, as the correctly placed lap belt generated less than 10 psi in these and other preliminary tests. On the other hand, torso flexion occurred with the misplaced lap belt, but the position of the belt generated a very high abdominal pressure. The approaches to take, therefore, to avoid abdominal intrusion with this test device are to keep the upper body from flexing Figure 13. Post-test lap belt position for booster/harness restraint (8557)ģ 2.737</page><page sequence="7">over the lower torso restraint and/or to place that lower restraint very low on the pelvis. These approaches are, of course, basic to good restraint system design. Among the partial shields, there was also a range of results, and this range seems to be explained by differences in shield height, flexibility, and continuity. As noted earlier, the partial-shields that yielded low pressure readings (8549, 8554) initially contacted the dummy at least an inch higher on its torso than did any of the other models and had little if any deformation during the test. This height and rigidity did not keep the dummy from rotating around the shield (Fig. 11), but it did raise the pivot location and thus the shield avoided the abdominal sensor. In some ways, this restraint interacted with the child dummy as an energy absorbing steering assembly does with an unrestrained adult dummy. The problem with this approach, however, is in achieving the optimal vertical position of the shield with respect to a range of child sitting heights. We also do not know how much concentrated load a child can withstand in the chest region. The partial shields that yielded pressure measurements in the 20-psi range were softer and more deformable than the others. Speculation is that these shields flattened out somewhat during impact, presenting a broader and more yielding surface to the dummy than did shields of more rigid construction. Among the more rigid shields, differences seemed to be related to radius of curvature. Those with pressure readings in the low 30-psi range had a relatively large radius of curvature. The shields with the highest peak pressure results were all quite rigid at the point of contact with the dummy and had either a comparatively small radius of curvature or a discontinuity in the structure's flexibility. That is, there was a hard "edge" at the point where the rigid structure stopped and a more yielding surface began. The higher, more rigid shields that moved forward less during dummy loading also resulted in lower head excursions. The information obtained from the abdominal intrusion sensor includes the degree of intrusion, the rate of intrusion, and the maximum level of pressure generated by the intruding surface. The pressure-time traces shown in Figure 5 indicate significant differences among the various restraint configurations. The rapid rise in pressure in the first three examples, and to a lesser extent the fourth, corresponds to a high rate of intrusion. This rapid loading is most likely explained by the fact that a lack of restraint on dummy body regions other than the abdomen allowed the inertial forces of the entire dummy to be concentrated in this soft area that abruptly became stiff as it approached its deflection limit against the spine. The concentrated-loading condition was also responsible for the large intrusions and associated high pressures. The plateau displayed in the fourth trace, which was most likely related to a flattening out of the shield face, indicated that the load was being distributed over a broader area during the restraining sequence. The shape of the full- shield trace also shows the effect of load distribution. In addition, the low peak pressure and loading rate resulted from the fact that the motions of the dummy's upper torso and head were also being retarded by the shield surface. In the case of the correctly-placed lap belt, the peak pressure occurs late in the impact sequence and is probably not related to intrusion of the belt itself but rather to the compression of the abdomen against the legs of the dummy. Although lap belts and partial shields exhibit similar dummy kinematics and head excursions, it is clear from the above analyses that they do not interact with the 3-year-old dummy in the same manner. While the lap belt loaded the pelvic structure, the partial shields loaded the abdomen. The lack of upper torso restraint concentrated the restraint load in both systems. The partial shields, however, directed this load to an area of the body not well suited to this function. The simple solution to reducing the lower torso loads, and at the same time improving head excursion, would be to add a diagonal shoulder belt. (This solution, of course, depends on lap/shoulder belts being available in automobiles, in both the front and rear seats.) The fit of the lap/shoulder belt can be significantly improved for children with the use of the original booster design that has guides for routing the belts forward and lower on the child's body. It is unfortunate, however, that the geometry of the partial shields has the effect of raising the shoulder belt on the dummy's chest and potentially placing it across the neck of a shorter child. Instructions for five of seven partial-shield boosters surveyed advised users to place the shoulder belt behind the child, while two said it could be used with "the taller child." (An eighth PS booster routes the lap/shoulder belt through slots in the booster itself, which are behind and under the child.) CONCLUSIONS A prototype sensor has been developed to continuously monitor intrusion and associated pressure in the abdominal region of a child dummy. It is able to discriminate among a variety of restraint configurations with results distributed over a range of 0 to 55 psi. The pressure-time histories, which are indicative of intrusion- time histories and load concentrations, show significantly different waveforms among the various restraint configurations. These performance differences appear to be valid based on examinations of dummy kinematics and restraint system construction. While there was no attempt to make this abdominal system respond to impact loading in a biomechanically realistic manner, its design features would allow its response to be adjusted to child biomechanical data when available. Even in its present form, however, this intrusion sensor could provide valuable information to the designers of future child restraint systems.
