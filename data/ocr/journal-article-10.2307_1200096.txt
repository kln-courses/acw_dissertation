The development of Indian political life, particularly up to the beginning of the Muslim period, has been the subject of confused and sometimes acrimonious debate ever since seri- ous attention was brought to bear on the subject in the last century. In large measure the serious flaw in attempting to study Indian political and social institutions results from the lack of reliable historical documentation in spite of a relatively large body of literature, of one sort or another, and archeological traces, that lead into remote antiquity. The religious literature that remains is more con- cerned with the nature of man in the context of the cosmos than with the recording of his- torical personages or events. The names that are remembered best belonged to semidivine heroes, who came to be regarded as avatars, or to semidivine philosophers or to poets or to dramatists. Political figures left very few monuments, and the people did not choose to memorialize them. Certain emperors and empires made an indelible impression, but in general the succession of their kings and dy- nasties is hazy. Even with the extensive re- ligious and philosophical literature that re- mains we are often at a loss to relate such materials to the social context because of these and other problems. Indeed, social history is harder to decipher than political history. It is not surprising, then, that a serious study such as Professor Drekmeier presents can at best hope only for an approximation in its attempt at describing the nature of king- ship and community in ancient India. More- over, it will seem to some specialists in Indian studies that one or another aspect of religion, literature, or culture has not been clearly perceived, due to the exigencies of social an- alysis. Nevertheless, Kingship and Community in Early India deserves careful consideration because of the novelty of certain of the theses set forth and because of the helpfulness of many of Drekmeier's interpretations as they have bearing upon the work of other special- ized fields. However, it is at a crucial point in the au- thor's method that questions might be raised as to the way in which historico-religious data have been employed to substantiate the de- scription of early India's social institutions. The author says: In this study I have enlisted the aid of psychol- ogy and the social sciences in an attempt to in- dicate something about the nonrational and sym- bolic experience of a civilization emerging from a tribal culture and experimenting with several forms of social coordination" [p. viii]. Indian religion is an exceedingly complex subject, but one that cannot be avoided in a work of this</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REVIEWS 165 sort. I know that there are readers who will take issue with certain characterizations (particularly in this area) that may seem casual or misleading, or perhaps not sufficiently abreast of current scholarship.... Here I ask only that it be kept in mind that my intention has been to provide no more than am backdrop for the more strictly social commentary and that the terms I have used must sometimes be understood in accordance with this purpose" [p. ix]. The clue to understanding the author's diffi- culty in interpreting certain aspects of India's religious history lies in his understanding of religion as a "backdrop" for "social commen- tary," a backdrop onto which various exciting but often misleading intellectual pictures may be projected which have the effect of cover- ing up the content of Indian man's religious experience. This situation becomes evident in chapter vi, in which the author discusses "The Response to Orthodoxy." Here social evolution is called upon to account for the development of Buddhism, particularly, out of the Aryan- Vedic past. A conflict exists between the ex- ploited and the exploiting classes; the food supply is no longer sufficient in a pastoral so- ciety; an agrarian economy is introduced; Kshatriyas and Brahmans are at loggerheads. In this situation the Buddhist reform-a Kshatriyan movement-"challenged the tra- ditional polytheism of the aristocratic culture of the tribes and poleis, questioning the myths and values on which that culture rested" (p. 95). But Buddhism came to have an impor- tant role in giving a new spiritual foundation to the rising urban classes that were concerned with suppressing the violence of the warriors (Kshatriyas) who tended to deflect the peace- ful dynamic of the emerging urban-agrarian economy. This aspect of the Buddhist contri- bution to Indian life was not destined to pre- vail: "It was perhaps too austere a religion for a people accustomed to an elaborate cere- monial" (p. 97). Certainly there is a good deal of mystery still surrounding the rise and fall of Buddhism in India, but the problem of interpretation is not furthered by considering the develop- ment of Buddhist ideals apart from the larger development of Indian religion during the same period. Thus Ananda Coomeraswamy has shown the integral relation that exists be- tween the symbolic content of Buddhist my- thology, recorded either in texts or icons, and the corresponding forms in Vedic mythology. The origins of Buddhism cannot entirely be separated from the gradual emergence of per- sonalism or anthropomorphism in the various phases of the transition from the religion of the Vedas to that of the Hindu period. In this process the later Buddhism of the north seemed to come under the influence of Hindu forms. Hindu forms, in turn, may have been shaped by new ideals coming from Buddhism, although it must be remembered that folk- heroes, such as Rdma, were gathering about them cycles of ballads and legends that were later to enter into the mainstream of Indian scriptural writings at approximately the time that the Buddhist texts were first transcribed. (On the question of ceremonialism alone, later Buddhism and Hinduism do not differ appre- ciably.) An interpretation of Buddhist-Hindu religion that seeks only for the corresponding social development and disregards the essen- tial religious problem revealed in the particu- lar social form impedes our understanding of Buddhism in the Indian context. Drekmeier is not adverse to seeking for ways to understand the mentality that gave rise to Buddhism. He interprets the Buddhist mind in Freudian terms and discovers that Buddhism represents the internalizing of repressive authority, the sys- tematic endeavor to subordinate the expression of the instinctual to what Freud has termed the reality principle. . . . It sought to do more than provide the happiness stressed in those religions more familiar to us, the happiness that comes with inhibiting the aim of love from the particular ob- ject that affords genital gratification. It sought to transform erotic love into friendship and brother- hood. . . . I shall take the view that Buddhism is essentially a means of coping with demands of the instinctual life in a time when the direct expression of these needs was increasingly inhibited by the needs of social organization. The solution lay in the ability to surmount the separation between the unconscious and conscious regions of the mind. He describes enlightenment in this way: Energy is liberated from the repressive process and the individual comes alive in the sense that the ego functions are freed from anxiety. This tran- scendence of the intrapsychic conflict of the disso- ciated personality makes possible the ultimate de- velopment of the self [pp. 100-103]. We will grant that such transformations, inhibitions, and subsequent gratifications may take place in the modern, Western personality.

But we</page><page sequence="3">166 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION wonder whether the imposition of this Freud- ian nomenclature upon the content of early Buddhist experience is helpful for an under- standing of the religious significance of Bud- dhism. Although the author is careful to in- clude references to the "sacred" and the "pro- fane" aspects of experience in his discussion of sacrifice (p. 56 ff.), he is not able to see the relationship that exists between the so- phisticated psychology of certain types of Buddhism and genuine encounter with the sacred. From chapter viii onward, the author shows his knowledge of the material of the law of the ancient Hindus in ,the works of Manu and Kautalya. Drekmeier's contribution to the understanding of Dharma and Artha Shastra is of outstanding importance in an area where significant interpretations in English are rare. CHARLES S. J.
