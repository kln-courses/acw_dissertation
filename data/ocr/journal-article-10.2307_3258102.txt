<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARCHAIC SMILE: A COMMENTARY ON THE ARTS IN TIMES OF CRISIS BY FRANCIS HENRY TAYLOR Director Fifty years ago archaic sculpture was known only as a curious phenomenon. It was assumed that all primitive peoples made statues in much the same spirit in which children make mud pies. No one but archaeologists-antiquarians and numismatists they were called then-both- ered to look at these barbaric efforts in stone and clay. It was soon CON' discovered, however, Apri that savages worked in bronze.

Civil NIMRUD AND ASSI servants with gaping BY CHARI mouths and pith hel- mets learned that their preferment depended upon the number of curi- osities they forwarded to the British Museum. The boulevardier who seldom left Paris and never under any circumstances went beyond Marseilles was the first to be attracted by archa- ic beauty. Arrested by their sophistication and their gallantry, he pointed out that these strange creations of remote antiquity were not only very fine to look upon but that in some way they were intimately connected with the artist's private life. And primitive art moved into the drawing room. Archaic sculpture is an art which belongs to that period of man's religious development when the idea is as big and important as the forms which symbolize it. Moral values and concepts had not yet become established, and a confusion existed between objects of reality and the world of the spirit. The rational and irrational were merged together and responded to physical and mental stimuli. Strange and occult powers were ascribed to rocks and trees, to events and natural phenomena. There was no part of material existence that was not bounded by taboo and superstition. Chance was completely un- known as was the con- ENTS cept of nature as a thing apart; reality was felt as mysticism and every ac- E: A COM- tion determined by par- ARTS ticipation rather than by natural law.

WILKINSON 233 They were at most transfer mechanisms through the means of which the portrait, for example, partook of the identity of its subject and the subject in turn acquired the characteristics of the portrait. "There was a child went forth every day And the first object he looked upon and re- ceived with wonder, pity, love, or dread, that object he became, And that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part of the day, or for many years, or stretching cycles of years...." The image in which the sculptor was living over again his own passions and experience was architectonic. Like a newborn baby, however awkward it might be, it was nevertheless a fully created thing with definite relations between its parts; and like the average baby, remarkably self-contained, 217 T] 1, ILI E i IS IS LC fR L,ES</page><page sequence="2">A smile appears on the faces of most archaic figures. It is not an accident of the sculptor's clumsiness, nor is it a conscious effort of his skill to create in his figures a happiness of ex- pression seeming to transcend that of human beings. To understand the smile one must turn to archaic sculpture itself. The almond shaping of the eyes, widespread upon the forehead, thick ribbon lids, and shelving brows give an imper- sonal dignity to their regard. The eyes are superb and proud, not vacant. There is a com- plete indifference to portraiture; a tranquility and resignation which one may sometimes observe on the faces of dead persons. Not only in the treatment of the eyes are these elimina- tions apparent but in the nostrils as well; placed above coarse cubic lips, they bring the flattened surfaces of the cheeks together between definite nose and chin. The jawbone continues the boundaries of a compact head set upon massive shoulders, which are gradually welded into an organic trunk, immobile and majestic. The fig- ure is built up step by step from the base on which it stands and of which it is a part. Certainly the Greek of the sixth century B.C. did not observe such heroic individuals in his daily life. Nor can one dismiss these images as the product of inferior execution. The fact that he did not attempt the actual portraiture of those about him must be laid to a sense of con- secration within himself, rather than to tech- nical deficiency. His figures are conceived in immortality, and, since he had not inquired too closely into the character of his gods, he cre- ated ideal representations of them, generaliza- tions of supermen, bearing none of the arrest- ing peculiarities of actual persons. This was, of course, not destined to continue in the later and more classical periods of Hel- lenism. By the time of Thales of Miletus, the father of physical science, the dawn of formal- ized religion had risen and conscious disassocia- tion of the material from the spiritual had already taken place. The power of inanimate things had been transferred to a pantheistic association of human or semihuman gods and goddesses who shared all the mortal vices but seldom tempered their divine authority with any virtue other than confusion. The Olympus of the Homeric poems had indeed become so complicated that a priesthood was essential to regulate the powers and influences of the sev- eral deities, to separate the sacred from the profane, the human from the semihuman, and to establish the personalities of heroes, gods, and mortals. Often a dualism of function and purpose was admitted; the sun and heavenly bodies were both human and divine. Even in those remote days we see emerge that omnis- cient anthropomorphism which was to be the basis of an ultimate union between the rational and the ethical. Plato and Aristotle were to hand this concept on as the theological founda- tion of the medieval church. That this progress from the general to the specific was shared by the artist may be deduced by comparing the archaic Tenean Apollo of Munich, so typical of the tense, flat-sided heroes of Boeotia, with the later and still more famous Hermes at Olympia. In the former one observes the archetype of mankind, not necessarily Apol- lo (for the cult was in its infancy) but certainly a god. The enigma of man's relation to the Infinite is on his face. Hermes, on the other hand, is sweet and precious. He is a particular Hermes, the son of Maia and guardian of the infant Dionysius. He is Hermes with all the emblems of individuality which Praxiteles, an- other individual, put upon him and therefore lacks the universal quality of the anonymous Apollo. Every civilization has had its great period of archaic sculpture. In Egypt under the Mem- phite kings the Sphinx, whose smile is perhaps the greatest riddle of antiquity, was carved. Never has a people produced an art more in- stinct with dignity and reverence. A statue of the pharaoh epitomizes not only the absolutism of his rank but the strangeness of his origin. The Nile which bore him alone might explain the mystery of his smile, a transfixed but scarce- ly humorous expression of his deity. In the early periods of Egyptian art his identity was revealed in nearly every instance by an insig- nificant cartouche; yet the solemnity of the convention is rarely disturbed by the desire for portraiture. This convention asserts itself more- over in every art that derived its inspiration 218</page><page sequence="3">,,~~~~~~~- 4 ,Ji 3~~~~~~ ' 4P' / ? .... -: y^~~~~~~~~~- .-&gt;* .--'.. * '^ ? .. -T^' . m &lt;, ? , \ .

In Assyria and Babylonia, in Chaldea and Cyprus, even in Crete and the Aegean islands, the religious purposefulness of archaic art is combined with a stillness of the spirit which denies the very existence of the individual who brought this conception into being. In Italy a parallel procession took place in Etruscan art. No visitor to the Villa Giulia in Rome will resist the suavity of the early figures or the happiness in the faces of the effigies, half- raised upon one arm, on their terracotta tombs. Borrowing their gods from the Greeks they gave them a new and terrible authority. All that is somber in the Latin temperament seems steeped in the uncompromising attitudes re- flected in the tomb paintings at Corneto and Cervetri. Yet Roman sculpture, on the other hand, reflected another point of view. It was immediate and finite, never knowing an archaic period, for the Latin mind was too filled with actuality. Roman gods were as regularly codi- fied as Roman law, and the citizens of both the Republic and the Empire were inspired by little else than the acquisition of property and the steps necessary to retain it. Every religious statue dedicated by a citizen was a direct finan- cial settlement with a divinity for a specific amount of grace or service rendered to the donor. Rome was the Chicago of antiquity and Roman law was based on the principle that it is better to buy off a god than to flatter him with prayer. That the Romans excelled in por- traiture is therefore not surprising for they were masters of the commonplace and the portrait bust invariably spoke only in the terms of the limitations of the sitter, not of his potenti- alities. Romanesque art, on the other hand, is once again Romanesque religion. The sense of con- tract between man and his creator had been lacking in the earlier centuries of the church where at best the pagan tradition of the court was crudely imitated.

Man had little time to speculate upon his relation to his divine author. Even the cleric, the most en- lightened man of his day, was too busy carrying on the daily life of the church to burden his mind with metaphysic. The year iooo brought about a change in his point of view. Modern scholarship to the contrary, it seemed a con- venient date at which the world might end, for medieval man, too, preferred round numbers. The Christian peoples prepared themselves for Judgment. But, strangely enough, the world kept on and the spirit of inquiry which this ex- citement had provoked was directed into the pathway of monastic reform. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries a wave of reli- gious emotion swept over Europe. The Cluniac reform inspired by Saint Bernard of Clairvaux brought about an intimacy between the monk and his Christ, the monk and the Blessed Vir- gin, not seen since the religions of primitive times. Sheltered from the world, and a sorry place it was if we believe the chronicles, the monk gave up his life to the contemplation of his God. Although to medieval man the details of Jesus' life were almost a commonplace, the individuality of Christ was not that of a mytho- logical hero. For the generality of His position as Saviour of Mankind was uppermost; He was not only Jesus of Nazareth but the ideal of re- demption as well, just as His Mother was the Mother of All Living in her dual role of wife to Joseph and Mother of the Son of God. It was just this bigness of conception which was needed to produce Romanesque sculpture and why in it we find those qualities, even to the smile itself, which abound in the archaic art of every civilization. Gloria was the word associated with these decorated portals, and it was the Glory of the Court of Heaven. The skeleton plan for these arrangements was laid out in the cloister and passed on by means of manuscript illumination to the stonecutters. But nothing was lost in the transmission of the idea; for, sharing to some degree the fervor of his monastic brother, the artist thought in the large and carried out his program without in- jecting into it his own personality. This ano- nymity may account for the consciousness in medieval art which enabled the craftsman to rise above the limits of an established iconog- raphy and to communicate in terms of univer- sal human experience. Elie Faure has properly contended that whenever voluntary sacrifice of the artist to his work is found, then that art may be considered truly medieval or archaic. The most notable parallels which he cites are the Gupta sculpture of India and the pre-Columbian art of Mexico and Peru. It matters little, however, what this art is or where or when it is made, for in the final analysis it represents merely the current artistic expression of a genuine religious period through which at some time or other every peo- ple pass. So many parallels have been observed be- tween Buddhism and Christianity that it is not surprising to find a similar relation between the monastic art of China and that produced by religious communities in the West. The famous rock-hewn caves at Yiin Kang approach in spirit the ideals set forth at Avallon or Vezelay and the great west front of Chartres. No less filled with anecdote and philosophy than that of Christ, the life of Buddha lent itself to asceti- cism and contemplation. It has even been suggested that the parable of the lotus flower pushing its way up through the mire may be considered analogous to the mystery of the Virgin Birth. Certainly the most vigorous plas- tic expression that we know of in China took place during the Six Dynasties, the moment when the legend of the life of Buddha was in- troduced from India. Not yet was the Buddhist hierarchy irrevocably defined, and the sculptor or fresco painter put into his figures much of his personal experience. Yet, since this experi- ence was religious and emotional, the sculpture and painting could not fail to take on that impalpable quality which we have seen inher- ent in all archaic art. To enumerate the other places and periods where this circumstance occurs would be to pre- pare a catalogue for some ethnographical mu- seum. In all of the primitive cultures of the Americas and of the Oceanic world we find 225</page><page sequence="10">similar developments. African Negro sculpture, so popular because of its abstractions, offers a splendid field for study since it is possibly the most recently executed primitive art that we know. Abstract it may be and perfect in its con- ception and design, but none the less it remains essentially anthropomorphic. The Negro sculp- tor feels his living God as God, and the smile which we see upon his face is a translation into stone or wood of his reconciliation with the Infinite. The elaboration of this theme must seem the vilest platitude to anyone who has so much as cast a tourist's glance at an archaic statue. But there is a significance to the archaic concept which is too often overlooked simply because archaic art has always appeared to be a product of the past. Yet the fact that its simple qualities are so appealing to the rugged individualists of the twentieth century is worthy of considera- tion. It suggests perhaps that in the present day we are starved for universals-for ideas and ideals that transcend our all too finite lives and habits of thought. In contemporary art the emlphasis is nearly always placed upon the par- ticular rather than the general; the great com- munity of belief in which all men shared and shared alike has fallen prey to the privy experi- ence and the momentary incident. The problem today, then, is not so much that of a lack of a single conviction but the nmul- tiplicity of convictions with which the creative artist is confronted. For two thousand years Western civilization has been concerned pri- marily with a monotheism in which the various levels of the hierarchy have been not only estab- lished but accepted by people in all walks of life. The iconology of the Judaeo-Christian world has thus been for many centuries clear to both the artist and the spectator; and it was taken by each of them as a matter of course. So too it was with the classical heritage of the Greco-Roman pantheism. Bacchus was as iden- tifiable as Saint John, and Moses could be set apart from Hercules by the most lowly member of society. In the rapidly expanding, secularized world in which we live, where neither the Bible nor Bullfinch's Age of Fable any longer play their traditional role and where one person's gods are as good as the next person's, it becomes imper- ative that there should be a return, if not to the gods of our fathers themselves, to some unify- ing principle in which the twentieth-century man of many faiths may find the comfort of authority. For the artist has ever required au- thority as a framework-a point of departure- for his own experience. The most telling lesson of the history of art, indeed, is that there is noth- ing new under the sun; a new movement at most is a return to a simpler expression of an already accepted fact. Why, some of you will ask, if this be true, have I titled this address "The Arts in Times of Crisis"? What can this have to do with the placid calm of an antique and worn-out formu- la? Has the archaic smile become in our time the leer of a derision starting from within, which has warped and discolored the visual world in which we live? These are valid questions more currently upon the lips of everyone than the snobbery of art circles is ready to admit. The contemporary aesthetic gives us pause; we find in it the nightmares and the ghosts which in the political and economic areas we sweep out of sight, under the rug, and forget that they exist. The chaos and fury of a painting or sculpture, or the dissonances of a new concerto, aggravate us because we have inherited a wholly unjusti- fied belief that the art of the past presented a stability of thought that was impervious to the political and spiritual agitation of the age of which it was a part. Nothing could, of course, be more untrue. For every art, every new style or tendency, has been born in a time of crisis. Yet, long after the historical issues have been forgotten and re- solved, the work of art remains an absolute, something which neither time nor tide can alter. In the words of E. M. Forster, "works of art are the only objects in the material universe to possess internal order." Our error lies in judging works of art not by their own internal order but by previous standards bred from other crises than our own. From the ashes of the present-day conflict be- tween Man and Science has been unleashed bit- 226</page><page sequence="11">'. r I 'v&gt;* .** c 4 I0 4, Head from a wooden crucifix (the lower portion of the beard restored).

Aesthetic is- sues have become inextricably confused with social ethics and whereas the average citizen is now obsessed with the necessity of "reasserting his responsibility to other individuals," the ar- tist has taken refuge in a symbolic language whose very symbolism applies only to his own confined and limited experience. We are living in an age of experiment where in the laboratory and the studio personal invention rather than the traditional universals of philosophy has established the basis of individual conviction. A recent broadcast by a British scientist, Alex Comfort, (reported in The Listener, Nov. 19, 1951) has sought to explain this preoccupation of the artist and the scientist with ethical pur- pose. "Man has so far developed," he said, "only two effective techniques for widening his grasp on external realities: the technique of com- municating total perception which we call art, and the technique of investigating objective ex- perience which we call science, and these are complementary techniques. In the past, artists have been content to discuss their responsibility in aesthetic terms, and scientists have taken, and still do take, the kind of view which rejects any direct concern with the application of their results-the usual argument has been, I think, that the scientist has only the ordinary respon- sibilities of a citizen, and that he has no right to make special claims on the ordering of soci- ety. Those attitudes, I admit, have broken down. They have broken down in the face of the experience we have had with Nazism, in the face of the atom bomb, and the advent of policy- determination by mass hysteria; most of all they have broken down, for the scientist, in the fact of the realization that the policies now applied over large parts of the earth are the result not of purposive planning, or even of purposive malice, but of entirely irrelevant factors spring- ing from personality-disorder, neurotic and ag- gressive compulsions, and even of mental disease." Another English voice has paralleled the scientist's dilemma of today by citing the ar- tist's "intense awareness, heightened by the in- ,tellect, of the tragedy within our time-of the religious struggle which is carried on to the last drop of blood-between the spiritual ideal of liberty and the tyrannous brutality of matter and its inexorable determinism." "One can perceive," continues Cyril Con- nolly in his valedictory editorial in Horizon (vol. xx, nos. 120-121, December 1949-January 1950), "the inner trend of the Forties as main- taining this desperate struggle of the modern movement, between man, betrayed by science, bereft of religion, deserted by the pleasant imaginings of humanism against the blind fate of which he is now so expertly conscious that if we were to close this last Comment with the suggestion that everyone who is now reading it may in ten years' time, or even five, look back to this moment as the happiest in their lives, there would be few who would gainsay us. 'Nothing dreadful is ever done with, no bad thing gets any better; you can't be too serious!' This is the message of the Forties from which, alas, there seems no escape, for it is closing time in the gardens of the West and from now on an artist will be judged only by the resonance of his solitude or the quality of his despair." Clearly the artist and the scientist are agreed on the limitations of our present world. And, since our society cannot escape from politics, political coloration enters in. Quite recently, in fact, much too much has been said about the political overtones of contemporary art. A con- certed movement is on foot to spread the witch hunt that has harassed our universities to the creative artists themselves. Academicians no longer able to sell their pedantries and their pedestals are unwilling to concede that new formulae are needed with which to project and protest the artist's anxiety for our daily exist- ence. Not only has the atom been split in our time but man's conscience has been rent asun- der. Every artist, every writer, every teacher is profoundly shocked with the material irrespon- sibility he sees on every side and is offering for better or worse, for richer for poorer, his indi- vidual solution. That the form or expression which these individual protests take are sympa- thetic or antagonistic to our traditionally tuned eyes or ears is merely an accident of history-a 228</page><page sequence="13">, / t\ ?i"- ,\ . %- I 4I Stone Virgin of the Annunciation. French, xiv century. Gift of J. Pierpont Morgan, I9i7 229</page><page sequence="14">reflection of the particular time of crisis in which these works are created. It is the indi- vidual's right in a free society to express his intellectual and emotional conviction in his own terms and not to be accused in so doing of being a propagandist for other people's ideolo- gies. Rugged individualism, which is the corner- stone of the capitalistic system, cuts both ways, and free enterprise which is no longer free is the one thing which in the arts as in business we most fear. Academies and societies which veer to the Left or to the Right, far from being the guardians of an immortal tradition, are merely the tools of pressure groups whose greatest fear is fear itself. There are those who may wonder where indi- vidualism will end and authority begin. The authority I believe will inevitably lie in the work of art itself, in its "internal order," for the work of art, to quote E. M. Forster once more, "stands up by itself, and nothing else does. It achieves something which has often been prom- ised by society but always delusively. Ancient Athens made a mess-but the Antigone stands Iup. Renaissance Rome made a mess-but the ceiling of the Sistine got painted; Louis XIV made a lmess-but there was Phedre. Louis XV continued it, but Voltaire got his letters written. Art for Art's sake? I should just think so, and more so than ever at the present time. It is the one orderly product which our muddling race has produced. It is the cry of a thousand sen- tinels, the echo from a thousand labyrinths, it is the lighthouse which cannot be hidden; 'c'est le meilleur temoignage que nous puissions donner de notre dignit.' " Just what the nature of this internal author- ity should be is a question that has occupied the waking hours of all thoughtful artists and con- noisseurs. Wilenski, the English critic, has put the problem very well: "To be an original en- largement of an artist's experience a work of art must be called forth by the service of religion or some consciously held idea of art." What then is this consciously held idea? "To regain a creative consciousness both in the artist and the spectator." He accepts religious art without comment as votive and therefore originally con- ceived; it is the product of a common emotional experience. Non-religious art, however, must be dominated by a principle-a knowledge held jointly by the creator and the spectator. Call it architecture, composition, what you will. It is the fundamental discipline underlying the cre- ative process-a process which is instinctive and universal, something shared with the biological world in its innate order, balance, symmetry. It is the thing which Aldous Huxley defined at a recent symposium on modern art: "I have always imagined that the reason why we are appealed to by a beautifully composed picture is that in some curious way these things tell us about the nature of the world, and that the same, I think, passes up from the purely physiological into the intellectual and spiritual world, and that actually, not the subject matter but the whole unification and harmonization of different elements which the artist does, in- cluding subject matter, actually form values, and so on, and is in a sense a kind of apocalypse or revelation of the nature of the universe." Many people are inclined to ask how it is pos- sible to recognize these spiritual qualities in a new and sometimes strange creative work. "I wish," they say, "that I could see what you see in that picture." Without attempting to define art (for its utter defiance to definition is prob- ably its greatest charm), one might reply that you learn to know and estimate art in the same way that you learn to appreciate your friends. There are those among your acquaintance whom you love and others whom you cordially despise; some will convey a special sympathy, while others appeal only to the rational proc- esses of your mind. Since works of art are the creation of human beings, they must be looked upon as extensions into stone or canvas of the artist's inner personality. And your insight into their characters is based upon the same human experiences of constant association that you gain by living with your fellow men. Perhaps the artist's unique gift is to see be- yond the narrow reality of the moment into the breadth of eternity. This is superbly expressed in the words attributed to the Chinese philos- opher, Li Po, who wrote and painted at the court of the Emperor Ming Huang in the eighth century: 230</page><page sequence="15">p Orpheus, by Carl Milles (I875- ).

I would not play a tune upon the sheng or lute, Something that did not sing meanings that else were mute. That art is best which to the soul's range gives no bound, Something besides the form, something be- yond the sound. These lines were brought to the attention of Miss Helen Keller by a distinguished artist who was painting her portrait. Talking with her as she sat to him, he became amazed at her under- standing of the artist's point of view. He sent this poem to her on a Christmas card, to which she made a very beautiful reply. "Li Po's amaz- ingly modern lines on art, which I have now in Braille, seem to me to describe the sincerity which I perceive emerging from the present ordeal like gold tried in the furnace. Eagerness for life's realities and not 'mere semblances of things' breathes through what I read not only about art but also spiritual experience, litera- ture and the demands for a freer, juster, friend- lier world. Although it is true that another civilization has gone bankrupt, I am not dis- mayed. God never leaves us without visions of the future and discoveries of greater possibili- ties in human nature that shall keep us enthu- siastic. We are being made aware of a coming social order larger, nobler than our own, and the crusade of goodness and intelligence against ignorance and wicked passions must needs end in unfeigned good-will radiating through all earth's systems." This revelation of the universe is not to be had for the asking. It requires humility and faith; faith in man and some acceptance of a divine order more considerable than the petty emotional experiences of man himself. He will find this faith in the art and in the writings of the great men of the past-in Van Gogh's letters and in Delacroix's Journal, in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Cezanne's confessions to Zola. To create a man must give himself; and if he gives himself, he must believe. Then and only then, will his work shine with the content- ment of the archaic smile. This address was given recently at Rollins Col- lege, Florida, based upon an article published by the author in Parnassus (April I932) under the title "The Archaic Smile." It has been en- tirely rewritten and enlarged. The author is also obliged to the Editor of The New York Times Sunday Magazine for allowing him to reuse cer- tain portions of his contributions and ideas which have appeared there in recent years. Many useful observations regarding primitive art and anthropomorphism may be found in Jean Pelseneer, L'l'volution de la notion de phenomene physique des primitifs a Bohr et Louis de Broglie (Brussels, I947), where the pas- sage quoted from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass was cited, and in L.
