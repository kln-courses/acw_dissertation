<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Dick-and-Jane prose ("This brings us to . . . one of my favorite passages"), its clumsy il- lustrations, and its meager bibliographical references if it can encourage beginners to study In- dian religions seriously. But can the book accomplish that task when it consists of a patchwork of paraphrases from divergent sources, some of which contradict others without Gill's providing a connecting thread? When defunct and intact ceremonial practices are discussed together without adequate regard for historicity? When alternative modes (particularly art historical research) of appre- ciating Indian religious artifacts are disparaged? When the religious studies scholar neglects to interpret the Ghost Dance and Peyote religions in terms of their religious content, instead repeating old functionalist remarks regarding their social roles? Certainly students can learn from Gill's book, but they might learn better and more from the already available introductory texts on American Indian religions. Ruth Underhill's Red Man's Religion (which Gill has denigrated in his writings) is better organized and documented. Peggy Beck and Anna Walters's The Sacred (published by Navajo Community College) pro- vides an exceptionally delineated and spirited portrayal of Indian spirituality, past and present. Ake Hultkrantz's two books, The Religions of the American Indians and Belief and Worship in Native North America, are complex masterworks of phenomenology. Hundreds of monographs describe Indian religions in detail, and edited volumes offer diverse approaches to their subject. Gill's work grants little that is new in terms of data, theory, or synthesis, and its method- ological flaws weaken its effectiveness as a textbook. Colgate University CHRISTOPHER VECSEY Hamilton, New York "In Vain I Tried to Tell You": Essays in Native American Ethnopoetics. By Dell Hymes. (Phila- delphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1981. University of Pennsylvania Publications in Conduct and Communication. Pp. 402, introduction, ethnological note, orthographic note, epilogue, bibliography, indices. $37.50 cloth; $12.95 paper) Dell Hymes, perhaps the most well-known and widely respected scholar of American In- dians in the world today, is both the father and the son of a "meta-language" that serves not only to explicate but also to reinvent ways of reading Native American oral narrative. He is the son because his own efforts have been greatly inspired by the work of other pioneer linguists such as Edward Sapir, and he is the father because he has cultivated and proselytized this meta- language among so many younger scholars at Penn and elsewhere, co-founding not just the new subdisciplines of sociolinguistics and the ethnography of speaking but the whole school of performance studies as well. Like no other scholar of our time and like none since Franz Boas, Hymes's vision has profoundly guided the larger disciplines of folklore and linguistic an- thropology, an achievement which would never have been possible had he not taken on the editorship of Language and Society and published more than a score of major papers widely read and reprinted over the past 15 years. At last, ten of these major papers have been collected, updated, and bound together into one handsome volume edited by Hymes himself, and we may now recycle our bulging file folders of stapled photocopies. That does not mean, however, that "In Vain" is a book we can sit down with and read instructively from cover to cover. It is scarcely a folklore textbook, even for graduate students. Neither is it a reference work to have handy on the shelf. Rather, it is a book to dip into very selectively, on those occasions when we are wrestling and playing with texts in our own collections. Hymes helps us solve the inevitable puzzles posed by these texts 481</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS as we watch him home in on the smallest elements of phonology and morphology-the little particles and prefixes that so often go astray in translation. Indeed, my own inquiry has been strongly shaped by this perspective. Though most concerned about Native American oral tradition, Hymes works quite self- consciously within the tradition of careful German and Jewish scholarship, and this is his cultural legacy. His achievements and his limitations must accordingly be measured not just in terms of what they do for establishing the authenticity and legitimacy of Native American ver- bal art but also for what they accomplish or fail to accomplish in terms of European philo- logical tradition, which has as its first goal not the interpretation but the restoration and reconstruction of texts. The present collection of Hymes's essays is subdivided into three major parts: the first (two chapters) dealing with linguistic and stylistic patterning, the second (four chapters) having to do with performance, and the third (four chapters) exploring genre and meaning. Though one of the papers ("How to Talk Like a Bear in Takelma") has undergone substantial revi- sion, most are presented in their original published form with only minor changes. One of his finest essays, "The Wife Who 'Goes Out' Like a Man" (from which he draws the book's metaphorical title) is thankfully included here, as is "Breakthrough Into Performance," a gem that should be fundamental required reading for every aspiring and practicing folklorist. "Breakthrough Into Performance Revisited" is the only truly new piece, but everyone in- terested in ethnopoetics will surely want to read part 5 of chapter 9, "Discovering Oral Perfor- mance and Measured Verse in American Indian Narrative," which contains Hymes's long- awaited and stimulating response to Dennis Tedlock's paralinguistic "pause" or "breath unit" approach to the structure of oral narratives. While focused exclusively on the Pacific Northwest materials collected by Boas, Sapir, Melville Jacobs, and Hymes himself, "In Vain" offers a paradigm and a syntax for studying ethnopoetics everywhere. What I like most about Hymes, perhaps, is not his meticulous handling of texts and his carefully controlled comparison of performances, which all too fre- quently (as in "Louis Simpson's 'The Deserted Boy' ") become ingrown and tedious, but rather his passionate advocacy of Indian rhetorical art and his ability to address larger issues of method and structure by "seeking systematic covariation of form and meaning" (p. 10). We come to see, however, that Hymes, after considering all the particles and affixes and after rereading a text for the umpteenth time, only occasionally has a genuine breakthrough in- to ethnopoetics. Such breakthroughs are exhilarating, to be sure, yet all too often his observa- tions are just observations. They are not insightful or significant observations so much as homemade exercises in rhetoric. His insistent reworking of a triadic narrative action he iden- tifies as "onset, ongoing, outcome" (pp. 191, 215, 321), for example, seems as arbitrary and pedestrian as Brooks and Warren's "exposition, complication, denouement," the model he borrows for analysis in "Breakthrough into Performance Revisited." At such a high level of abstraction, almost any text from any language will suit. Another problem with the book at large is its persistent and damaging use of "myth" to describe certain kinds of American Indian narratives. Borrowed from classical tradition, "myth" is a decidedly alien generic label that merely perpetuates the journalistic and popular distortion of Native American expressive materials as permeated by fantasy and error. If we are ever to persuade the readers and critics of literature that Native American (or African or Asian) storytellers are indeed "authors of world reputation" (p. 144), then we must first of all aban- don our notions of them as "mythmakers." True, many scholars hold an enlightened view of myth as a sacred story concerned with telling us about the beginnings of things and operating ritualistically to control future events, but with few exceptions Native American stories are not formally or substantively shaped, like those of ancient Greece or Rome or Scandinavia, 482</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS around the manipulations of anthropomorphic gods. "Myth" is consequently an obsolete and ethnocentric translation for a whole panoply of culture-specific forms. "Myth" is quite simply "descriptively inadequate" to any deep understanding of American Indian traditional texts and deserves to be purged from our American scholarly lexicon. Finally, if Hymes would in the future annotate his prodigious linguistic analyses with avail- able ethnographic and ethnohistoric data on Northwest Coast peoples, his work would be con- siderably more powerful and speak to a much wider scholarly audience. As it is, there is so much effort expended on texts for their own sake that we are seldom invited to make connec- tions between these texts and their performances on the one hand, and (borrowing a phrase from Foxfire) "the further affairs of plain living" from which they sprouted, on the other. An- ticipating such criticism, Hymes defends himself in the "Introduction" for not attempting to be all things to all people, but we might ask that in the future he try to speak as often to fellow folklorists and ethnographers as he does to his own lost tribe of Lower Chinook philologists. We still have much to learn about ethnopoetics, and Hymes is one of the few who can truly teach us, but it's doubtful that we will become much wiser or more sensitive to the coding of texts until he starts grounding them in the real world. In his own words, "the material re- quires some understanding of a way of life" (p. 5). The "Ethnological Note" that prefaces the book, while terribly brief, is at least a gesture in that direction.

Pp. xx + 248, foreword, preface, introduction, maps, figures, tables, appendix, notes, bibliography, index. $30.00) Ethnoastronomy focuses on the astronomical understandings and techniques of traditional cultures in both the past and the present. It is concerned, on the one hand, with people's con- ceptions of the cosmos and with the many ways in which they integrate these conceptions into facets of their lives and, on the other hand, with the various means they develop to record, predict, and thus, in a sense, control these important phenomena. Both of the above-listed books may be described as breakthroughs in ethnoastronomical and even ethnographical studies, for their authors view astronomical knowledge and practices as in- tegral parts of the way in which traditional peoples conceptually organize the world around them. In both groups, astronomical events provide the template for ordering the universe- binding together the mythology, folklore, and material culture. The authors look, therefore, for clues to the shape of this astronomical knowledge both in oral tradition and in its interrela- tionship with information embedded in items of material culture. A striking similarity of both books is their delineation of the way in which these divergent peoples incorporate principles of astronomy and cosmology into every aspect of their lives, for both the Skidi Pawnee and the Quechua-speaking occupants of Misminay perceive the celestial and terrestrial spheres to be patterned after one another. The arrangement of Pawnee villages mirrors the groupings of important stars in the sky, while the intersecting footpaths and 483</page></plain_text>
