For the descendants of the sheikh, known as al-Hajajiyya and his Sufi devotees, the land scape is imbued with cultural memory1: the material artefacts and living symbols of clan identity, genealogical history, and conversion narratives. Using the tools of ethnographic description, oral narrative, and performance as well as iconographic representation, visual archive, and text, I examine the synchronous frames of oral and "archaeological memory " and conclude that many of the leitmotifs of Egyptian festival tradition are still celebrated, even though changes in the perceptions of religious and cultural appropriateness have resulted in transformations and, in some cases, reversals of some of the most ancient per ceptions of the sacred and the profane. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Jamal Zaki al-Din al-Hajaji, member of al Hajajiyya clan, folklorist, and friend with whom I explored the mulid of Sidi Abu 7 Hajjaj and who died in August 2009. Introduction The mulid or festival of the mediaeval Islamic sheikh, Sidi Abu'l Hajjaj, is celebrated annually in his shrine above Luxor temple. In many of the rituals and events performed by devotees, the festival bears striking resemblance to its ancient Egyptian precursor, the "Beautiful Feast of Opet," graphi cally documented on the walls of the Luxor Temple Colonnade from the 18th Dynasty (ca. 1300 bc). While this subject has been addressed by Egyptologists resident in Luxor as early as 1917,2 the recent fire which destroyed the structure of the shrine of Abu'l Hajjaj has exposed the degree to which the Luxor temple is a palimpsest of succeeding epochs of architectural, religious, and cultural expression and prompts a more profound examination of the phenomenology of ritual, leitmotifs, and performance in Egyptian celebratory tradition. As recently as 1925, the main concourse for Luxor residents into the shrine was the entrance flanked by the two statues of Rameses, and only in 1948 were the descendants of the sheikh (known 1 A term coined by Jan Assmann, Religion and Cultural Memory (Stanford, 2006), and one, in my view, which most aptly characterizes this harmonious state in which ancient beliefs and practices become integrated and transformed within contem porary tradition. 2 Georges Legrain, Louxor Sans les Pharaons (Brussels, 1914). 403</page><page sequence="2">404 JARCE 45 (2009) Fig. 1.

For them and those who survive them, the landscape remains embedded with cultural memory: architectural artefacts and forms, living symbols of clan identity and genealogical history, embodied in faith narratives. A new wave of archaeologists has termed the phenomenon of deriving and interpreting ancient belief systems from material evidence as the pursuit of "archaeological memory"; anthropologists and scholars of comparative religion term the concurrence and intersection of ancient and modern beliefs in religious tradition "syncretism." This paper aims to explore both approaches: the lamina tions of history and belief via the "archaeological frame" of cultural memory, its materiality, and its various phenomenological manifestations via the tools of ethnographic description, oral narrative, and performance archives as well as iconographic and hieroglyphic representation. By examining the multiplicity of historico-religious influences from the pre-Dynastic, Dynastic, Coptic, Fatimid, and Ayyubid periods to the contemporary on festival ritual in Luxor, it is argued that since the beginning of the twentieth century, changing perceptions of religious and cultural appropriateness have resulted in a relegation of rituals, those once sacred to the ancient Egyptians as well as those derived from the Shiite veneration of saints, to the margins of celebration, and a re-sanctification and incorporation of others into the more orthodox Islamic frame.</page><page sequence="3">WICKETT 405 Fig. 2. The mosque of Abu 7 Hajjaj within the Luxor temple complex. The Mulid and Its Patron Sheikh, Sidi Abu'l Hajjaj The patron sheikh of Luxor is known as Sidi Abu'l Hajjaj, "Our Lord, Father of Pilgrims," by exten sion, "Greatest of all Pilgrims," an eponymous title he acquired, according to Legrain, because of a miracle attributed to him in the late twelfth or thirteenth century. His actual name was Yusuf Ibn cAbdelrehim bin Ghazi al-Qureishi and he reputedly died in 642 Hejira of the Islamic calendar (1243 ad) according to the mediaeval historian, al-Udfuwy.3 The miracle occurred in the deserts of al-Hejaz (that is, Western Saudi Arabia) where he was stranded with his fellow pilgrims (al-hajjaj) without water. Suddenly, at the moment they might other wise have collapsed and died of thirst, their empty flagon brimmed with water and overflowed after his supplications.4 Another version of the name legend, popular in the 1930s, tells of how the sheikh, who came originally from Iraq, rescued the ship of a group of pilgrims from Mecca through divine in tervention, and suggests that the sacred boat is paraded in his festival in commemoration of that criti cal event.5 3 al-Udfuwy, Al-TalHa al-SaHd (Cairo, n.d.). 4 Georges Legrain, Louxor Sans les Pharaons. 5 James Hornell, "Boat Processions in Egypt," Man 38 (1938), 145.</page><page sequence="4">406 JARCE 45 (2009) In 1286, forty years after his death, a zawiyya was built for the sheikh by his son, which was later visited by Ibn Battuta on his travels. The current shrine sits above the first pylon of Luxor temple next to the mud-brick minaret of the Fatimid6 mosque, the earliest Islamic monument on the site and the adjoining mosque. According to descendants of the sheikh or al-Hajajiyya, the shrine was built on "a church of gold," but since it has never been razed to the ground, this description remains fanciful. Copious variants of the legend of the sheikh's arrival in Luxor, and his "conquest" of the Roman/ Coptic town, reveal a fusion of historical fact and folktale. In one version, Sidi Abu'l Hajjaj asks Towzah/Tarzah, the Roman queen of Luxor (or as other variants would have it, the Coptic rahba or abbess) for a camel hide (jild al-jamal) to sleep on. From this skin, he weaves a thread which he winds around her precinct, so deposing her as queen and effectively conquering the precinct of Luxor. This same conquest motif appears in the tale of Sayyid al-Badawi in Tanta and Fatima (Fatna) Bint al-Birri and so is an Egyptian topos, not one peculiar to Luxor. (Amm al-Dessouqi al-Hajaji, a descendant of the sheikh and a member of the marakabiyya or boat men clan, recounts the tale as a triumph of wiles over naivete. In his version, the event transpired in the ancient Egyptian enclave of Tiba or "Thebes": Our grandfather, Abu'l Hajjaj came from Baghdad There was a queen whose name was Tereza And her priests refused to allow him in. He said to them, "Only give me a camel hide to sleep on And when morning breaks, I shall be gone." (Our town was called Thebes . . .) He said to her, "Only give me a camel hide to sleep on And when morning breaks, I shall be gone." She said to him, "Fine. Let him have it this time." Well ... he came at night, and snipped the camel hide Snipped, snipped, snipped And from it, wove a string, And wound it round the whole town. Wound it how? Wound it to the left! And so, he stayed there and ruled the town from that time onwards . . . She became a Muslim and remained there She's buried in that room over there.7 Another version, in which Abu'l Hajjaj encourages Tarzah, the Coptic matriarch, to convert to Islam, was performed in traditional saj( or rhymed, poetic prose by a dervish called al-Denderawi from the town of Quft, near Qus, in 1985: 6 Recently architectural historians have surmised that this "archaic" mudbrick structure may have been Abbasid rather than Fatimid. Nevertheless, celebrants of the mulid festival perceive strong links to Qus, center of the Fatimid occupation for over four hundred years, and attest to what are perceived to be "Fatimid" accretions or additions to the contemporary mulid tradition. 7 Recorded and translated by the author, with transcription by Jamal Zaki al-Din al-Hajaji, Luxor, 1985.</page><page sequence="5">WICKETT 407 The hero, Abu'l Hajjaj, who united the lands with his wiles, said, "I am he who will reveal true contentment to those who follow me." In the inundated earth of Luxor, whose foundations were made of stone He could perceive the smallest maggots and see the Omniscient One. In front of Tarzah they all stood, in their broken sandals and old shoes And he swore, "By my right hand, I swear . . . Those who have come with me from our town I shall strike you with this pair of sandals If you do not honour Sitt Tarzah." Tarzah says, Tarzah says . . . "When Abu'l Hajjaj looked at me, The enlightenment of a year's journey he gave to me." He said to her, "If you speak the prayer, Pronounce the belief in one God and speak it aloud, By the grace of God, I, Abu'l Hajjaj, Shall bring forth from the highest heavens, The word of my Lord God Who speaks from the highest heavens . . . May you invoke the Almighty!"8 Al-Denderawy's conversion tale ends there but, in some versions, Tarzah immediately asks Abu'l Hajjaj to marry her, while in others, he asks her to marry him. Some believe that he refuses her over tures, though the two would seem to agree on a harmonious arrangement since they are buried together in the shrine. In Upper Egyptian tradition, this would suggest that they were "married,"9 an issue which was still being hotly debated in the 1980s. Local people would still smirk at the thought of Abu'l Hajjaj and Tarzah residing together there in a kind of nuptial harmony, while others argued that she was an abbess and thus, a virgin, and that she remained a virgin after death as she was buried "standing to the waist." Others believed that she was resurrected to life after conversion, while still others, that Abu'l Hajjaj was already married and thus, would not have married another woman.10 Her tomb, as the tomb keepers will attest, still survives, accessed from a different passage way and divided by a wall, but nevertheless, in close proximity to that of Abu'l Hajjaj. It is normally kept locked and open only to women pilgrims at the time of his mulid. What is interesting from the scholar's perspective is that the focus of public debate and speculation remains the perceived "marriage" of Tarzah and Abu'l Hajjaj and its relation to the mystical consum mation of the ithyphallic Amun-Rec, impersonated by the king and the "God's wife," his queen, in the Birth Room of Luxor Temple during the New Kingdom Opet Feast.

The aim of the festival was to renew the life-force through this mystical union of king and consort in the Southern harim or "Opet" of Luxor temple: "the place, indeed of Truth in which he (the king) was made young,"11 and then return back, rejuvenated, to Karnak temple. In one epoch, the procession of barques was carried on land along the Avenue of Sphinxes. It may have sailed down the Nile at the peak of the inundation and may also have been pulled along an artificial waterway to Luxor. Some .Egyptolo gists believe that this was originally a navigable channel which would fill with water at the annual inundation, thus allowing the barques of the gods to sail from Karnak temple to the Southern Harim or "Opet," that is, Luxor temple. When the height of the inundation no longer coincided with its designated date in the imperfect Egyptian calen dar (and the boats could not sail on it), it was filled in and a causeway built on top. Over a mil lennium later, in the 30th Dynasty, (ca. third cen tury bc), Nectanabo re-established the ram-headed Avenue of Sphinxes along this 2.5 km concourse.12 In the Opet Feast procession, the barques of the gods, preceded by censers, drummers, clappers, and acrobats, would stop at way-stations on route. According to the songs inscribed on the walls, it is clear that this festival of Amun was celebrated for the veneration of the god as well as the king's long reign and edification: The phyle ("guild" or work crew) of "sailors" and the vanguard of the army who are following this august god . . .

"Hail Amun, primeval god of the Two Lands in Karnak in your manifestation inside your barques on your beautiful feast of Opet. May you be at ease in it!"13 Reliefs which document the rites of the Opet feast and its songs, dating from the reign of Tutankha mun, stretch along the entire length of both East and West walls of the Colonnade of Luxor temple: 11 William Murnane, "The Opet Feast and the Temple of Luxor" (unpublished mss., 1981), 4. 12 Kent R.

Ritual scenes include depictions of the barque shrines borne on poles on the shoulders of priests, men beating various types of drums or waving sticks with the accompanying text: "musicians who are making music in advance of this august god, Amun ..." as well as a man with his hand shielding his mouth (possibly ululating or "cackling" like a sacred goose), Nubian acrobats bent double, a military escort, horse-drawn chariots, fattened oxen passing through the gates into the temple, offerings of incense and food, and a potpourri of hands and feet hurled in the air in the frenzy of the celebrations. In reference to "a drinking place" en route, a stopping point or way-station where the phyle or work crew of sailors would quaff down some beverage, the accompanying hieroglyphic text cites the lyrics of an "archaic-sounding" drinking song,14to be sung by the honorary "sailors": "For the party that is sailing, For those who sail the ways, A drinking place is hewn: The sky is outstretched to the south A drinking place is hewn: The sky is outstretched to the north The sailors quaff a drink to_NN Beloved of Amun Re Kamutef, praised by the gods ToNeith!"15 The clerical and administrative hierarchy of priests in ancient Egyptian temples, termed phyles or work crews, was based on clan groupings and may have been derived from a pre-Dynastic kin-based system of service involving men who supported the king.16 The phyles may have inherited their hon orific titles from boat crews, since, in the First Dynasty (ca. 2890), in Saqqara, for example, a noble priest called Merka was called "Captain of the Boat of the King of Upper Egypt."17 Such appellation would not be dissimilar to the title and position accorded to Luxor's al-Hajj (Abdulla as elder of the ritual "boatmen" or marakabiyya of his divine patron, the sheikh. The contemporary social organiza tion of the marakabiyya who were a family of civil servants, not sailors, suggests that the members of this clan were given the highly esteemed and sacred task of building the boats, painting, and decorat ing them as an honor accorded only to a few. Sacred timings In the Middle Ages, the timing of a mulid, a word which means, literally, "birth feast" was linked symbolically to the anniversary of death of the saint or sheikh, and thus, his symbolic "rebirth" into life after death.18 Coptic mulids retain the notion of celebrating the rebirth into life of their saints. Muslims, on the other hand, tend to perceive these festivals as celebrations of sheikhs' "birthdays." Despite this difference of perception and distinctly different event calendars (mulids for Coptic saints 14 William Murnane, "The Opet Feast and the Temple of Luxor." 15 Translation of the hieroglyphs by William Murnane, "The Opet Feast and the Temple of Luxor," 3. 16 Ann Roth, Egyptian Phyles in the Old Kingdom: the Evolution of a System of Social Organization (Chicago, 1991) cited in Donald Redford, Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt (Oxford, 2000), 318. 17 Michael Rice, Who's Who in Ancient Egypt (London, 1999). 18 al-Udfuwy, Al-TalHa al-SaHd.</page><page sequence="8">410 JARCE 45 (2009) are oriented to the Coptic calendar and thus, the seasons of the agricultural year, while mulids of Muslim sheikhs follow the Islamic lunar calendar); mulids in Upper Egypt are usually observed by Muslims and Copts as ecumenical feasts which embrace all, a sign of the essentially inclusive nature of the tradition. The current mulid of Sidi Abu'l Hajjaj is aligned to the lunar Islamic calendar and its timing de signed to coincide with critical phases of the moon. It starts with the first appearance of the moon on the first of al-Sacban and concludes with its apogee on the eve of the 14th day, Nuss al-Sa(ban, the last full moon before the fasting month of Ramadan, with the final procession taking place the morning after. The Nuss is popularly believed to be the most sacred night in Islam, the night on which the fate of all human beings is to be decided, and perhaps for this reason, many mulids in Upper Egypt are celebrated on this night, including all mulids in Nubia.19 In the Babylonian tradition, the full moon would be celebrated as the momentous day when the moon would "crown" and the earth would be bathed in constant illumination from both divine orbs: the sun, which was constant, and the moon, always in flux. In the case of Abu'l Hajjaj, however, according to the mediaeval historian, al-Udfuwy, the dating of his mulid was reinforced by the fact that in the Middle Ages, this was believed to be the night on which Abu'l Hajjaj ascended into heaven.20 The temporal alignment of ancient Egyptian festivals varied, but the ancient Heliopolitan "Festi vals of Heaven," for example, were aligned to the lunar calendar, and celebrations were held at the crescent moon, on the 6th day, the full moon, and at the start of the last quarter.21 In the local Theban calendar, as well, feasts of the New Moon and the 6th Day of the monthly "Feasts of the Sky" were also deemed particularly significant "from the quantities of offerings that were recorded."22 Two other significant ancient Egyptian feasts were also determined according to the lunar calendar, the feasts of the pre-dynastic god Min and that of Osiris. The "Feast of the Going Forth of Min," which was marked by the erection of a wooden mast pole in the Old Kingdom, was celebrated at the rise of the new moon, as was the commemorative festival of Osiris, god of death and rebirth (in ancient Egyptian, Wsir). In the case of Osiris, this was emblematic of the conception of divine rebirth associ ated with the reconstitution of the moon from "death," of light from darkness, and the apogee of the perpetual lunar cycle of waxing and waning. Osiris was also believed to be present in the erection of the so-called Djed pillar, often depicted as an anthropomorphic statue with feathers and eyes, to show the living divinity within, in effect, a fusion of the act of "raising up" with the notion of resur rection, and belief in the immanence of the divine spirit of "life after death," which Osiris repre sented, in the physical housing of the pillar. The Opet feast in Thebes had no lunar connections, however, and was only aligned under King Tut ankhamun in the New Kingdom to coincide with the peak of the Nile's inundation. The sole linkage which exists between Luxor and the Opet Feast in the written record is, nevertheless, one of timing. The Triadon, a fourteenth century poem written in Coptic with Arabic translation, alludes to Luxor as the "town of Pape,"' that is, "that of Opet." Translated into English, the text reads: "Come with me to the town of Pape [al-'uqsori) and know now this is the 13th day of Paophe." 19 Nawal al-Messiri, "The Sheikh Cult in Dahmit," in John Kennedy, ed., Nubian Ceremonial Life: Studies in Islamic Syncretism and Change (Cairo, 1978). 20 Al-Udfuwy, Al-TalHa al-SaHd. 21 Hermann Kees, Ancient Egypt: A Cultural Topography (Chicago, 1961), 155. 22 Harold Nelson, "Medinat Habu Calendar," in Harold Nelson and Uwo Holscher, eds., Work in Western Thebes 1931-33 (Chicago, 1934), 57. 23 Oscar von Lemm, Das Triadon: ein Seihidisches Gedich mit Arabisher Ubersetzung (St. Petersburg, 1903), 1. 311.</page><page sequence="9">WICKETT 411 The poet creates an alliterative cadence by invoking Pape, literally, "that of Opet" and Paophe, the name of the second Coptic month of the season of inundation (akhet), roughly mid-October, itself de rived from the re-orientation of the timing of the Opet feast to the annual flood. In the poem, Luxor is written in Arabic as al-'uqsori: "the castles" (as it was commonly known in the Middle Ages) while the conjunction of the two descriptions points to the fact that Luxor was still a mainly Coptic enclave, renowned as the place of celebration of the Feast of Opet, even after the death of Abu'l Hajjaj. There are no direct connections between the ancient Egyptian Feast of Opet and the Osirian ritu als apart from their linkage to the inundation. However, another possible point of linguistic conver gence could be mooted between the mulid and these ancient festivals via the word, w-sir, the name Osiris in ancient Egyptian. According to McPherson, in the 1940s, the word, sir was the name of the divine spirit venerated in a mast pole erected at certain sheikh's festivals around Egypt.24 In de scribing the mediaeval door which is built into the wall of the sheikh's shrine, the titular head of the boatmen of the sheikh, al-Hajj cAbdulla, uses the term, bob al-sirr: "secret door" or "door of the sir9,99 that is, divine spirit. According to him, through this carved wooden door, the celestial saints (al-aqtab) and his divine counterparts would enter the tomb of the sheikh. No human would pass through it. The spiritual function of this door is known only to initiates and thus, it may be construed as a "secret" door. However, this portal also performs the role of a "soul door," an ingress reserved for the arch-saints in Islam, coming in visitation to the sheikh. In that way, it is analogous to the false door in ancient Egyptian tombs through which the peregrinatory spirit could move in and out to feast on food offerings left in the tomb. The Mulid of Abu91 Hajjaj: Sequences of Events and Their Historical Counterparts The precisely timed schedule of events at the mulid of Abu'l Hajjaj illustrates the elaborate social organization and collaboration of different diverse groups of devotees culminating in the festival of the patron sheikh of Luxor. As al-Hajj cAbdulla told us, on the 25th of Rajab, the Islamic month preceding the month of al Sa'ban, a boat would be sent traditionally from the nearby religious center of al-musayih at Matcana carrying offerings to the sheikh: "a cow, 100 pigeons, wheat, okra, onions, rush matting and wood for the erection of the Sufi pavilions."25 On the 1st of al-Sa(ban, a decision would be made as to whether there will be a mulid. In the past, if there were to be one, the eldest of the marakabiyya or "boatmen," al-Hajj cAbdulla, would shinny up the sari (or mast pole) erected in the place called the saha, to place the beraq or pennant on the top. When they begin the mulid celebrations, there is a sign: they set up the sari, fly a pennant from the top and chant the prayer known as al-da9im\ "God is Everlasting; God is Everlasting, O God! God is Everlasting; O God! O God! God is Great!" This is a sign that the mulid will take place.26 Now, once an envoy has informed the town that the mulid will be celebrated, at the same time on the same day, thirty miles away in the town of Qus, "the guardian of the ancient snare drum of the sheikh will ascend a hill and signal with his drum a message that the saint's festival will begin."27 24 J.

According to the scholar Blanchard, writing in 1917, caricatures of other popular figures such as the "judge" (al-qadi), as well as the sheikh's water vessel and nuptial bed, were on sale during the festival. Manufacture of the bed was subsequently banned, possibly because it was a symbol of the reputed "consummation" of marriage of the sheikh with Sitt Tarzah. The contemporary carusa resembles a staid, full skirted matron, but in 1917, Blanchard states that the word (arusa also denoted "a rudely cruciform figure with a female face engraved on the obverse with the pudendum muliere on the back." In Blanchard's view, the mulid doll or (arusa "bride" resem bled the parturition dolls or terra cotta fertility dolls which acted as ex-votos and were found in Egypt as early as the Pre-Dynastic period. He concluded that it "could be assumed that on the anniversaries of a saint's birth (i.e., mulids) baraka or fertility would be abroad and . . . [might] be absorbed by eat ing the emblematic Wwsa."28 28 R. H.

As al-Hajj cAbdulla declaimed in 1985: "These boats are made for Sheikh Abu'l Hajjaj. They never go into the water. You'll find them under the stairs. They never go into the water. They're dedicated to Sidi Abu'l Hajjaj and never come out except for the procession. These boats take years to build. Our grandfathers made these." In the 1925 archive footage shot by Harry Burton for the Metropolitan Museum in New York,29 in his mission to record "native life," the boats of the sheikh appear as highly decorated, galleon-like ships with multiple flowing sails, and, unlike now, were propelled down the Corniche by men and a pha lanx of women, garbed in black. As with funerary processions today in Luxor, the participation of women in al-dora has since been proscribed. The much more modest felucca-like boats now are repainted red, yellow, and white at the houses of the marakabiyya where they remain until the morning of the procession. They are then festooned with multi-colored sails, pennants, and palm fronds and hoisted onto wheeled carts to be pulled along by the clan members, and those accorded the honor of pulling the boats. The Day of Slaughtering (al-dabh) On the second last day of the mulid, at dawn, the ritual slaughter (al-dabh) of the buffalo belonging to al-Hajajiyya, would take place. At the turn of the century, a designated family would have been given the honor of fattening up the buffalo and caring for it until the moment of offering, as is the normal practice with the sheep ritually slaughtered at the cEid al-Kabir or "Great Feast" of the Islamic calendar.30 Now, the buffalo, formerly provided by the Ministry of Endowments to the descendants of the sheikh, is supplied by a local butcher. In front of the steps of the modern shrine entrance, the buffalo's throat is cut after the recitation of special prayers. As al-Hajj (Abdulla explained, once this was done, "the right thigh of the animal would be severed first and then the heart, liver, and innards divided up between the four clans of the sheikh's descendants. The remaining flesh would be cut into thousands of minute cubes, one to be consumed by each member of al-Hajajiyya family." This act was traditionally performed at the culmination of the procession,31 but by the 1980s, the ritual had been moved forward to coincide with the general slaughtering of animals as ex votos (nidur) to the sheikh in a room designated for that purpose beside the shrine. On that day, the corridor in the shrine between the mosque proper and the slaughtering room would run with rivulets of blood. Fresh handprints of pilgrims would be pressed onto the protruding columns of the Luxor temple after having been dipped in the sacrificial lamb or goat's blood, while in an adjoining room, effec tively, a make-shift kitchen, women would squat beside fires and vats of boiling water, waiting to boil up the flesh of their offering immediately after slaughter. At some point after 1985, an Islamic library was established in this room, but since the fire, the walls have been dismantled and the columns 29 This 35 mm film archive, property of the Metropolitan Museum of New York, is the sole visual record of the mulid festival from 1925. 30 Legrain, Louxor Sans les Pharaons. 31 Oral comm., al-Hajj (Abdulla.</page><page sequence="12">414 JARCE 45 (2009) Fig. 5.

This space once formed part of the inner sanctum of Luxor temple. The Great Night or al-lela al-kabira The crush of the crowd grows until the Great Night when the grassy space in front of the shrine complex is crammed with riotous youths, people camping out and thousands of devotees who called themselves muhibbln al al-bet or "Devotees of the House of the Prophet." In the past, these devotees would come every year as a sacred duty to perform rituals in honor of the sheikh as well as zikr (which literally means "memory"), the ecstatic whirling in remembrance of God. In Upper Egypt, the word Sufi was not widely used, but the garb and behavior of these adepts have triggered many evocative descriptions such as this by the Dutch traveler, Vansleb, in the seven teenth century: "all cloathed in a very strange manner with Garbs made up of divers pieces of many colours patched together, they caused themselves to be wondered at by their howling and grimaces, for</page><page sequence="13">WICKETT 415 they wagg'd their Heads, their Eyes and their Mouths. Others pronounced the word, 'Hu' [lit. "He") namely God] and there was none without armor, a Club or a Halberd or a wood sword."32 These men, often those who refer to themselves the designated censers of the saint or mubaharatl al al-bet still wear the same "coat of many colors," a patchwork gown known as al-dilq. The weapons Vansleb describes are seldom carried now except occasionally in the "Going Round" or al-dora (see below) and in the ritual known as al-dosa. In this ritual, members of the Sufi tariqa known as al-RifaHyya, famous for their affinity to snakes and their ability to charm them, leap from blade to blade of the swords clenched in the teeth of brotherhood adepts, as a sign of their faith and the power of the sheikh's baraka. As the Sufi devotees are deep in trance, no blood flows. Devotees strive to achieve a transcendent state of consciousness as they whirl incessantly to the meshing rhythms and melodies of flute and drums. Occasionally, they may foam at the mouth or fall prostrate to the floor, an ecstatic experience attributed to the presence of the sheikh and his baraka, perceived to be most powerful during the season of his mulid. The mantra-like Hu, identified by Vansleb as a cry of the muhibbin, is a word also found in the ancient Egyptian lexicon. In that context, it denotes a particular type of "creative and regenerative force," possibly akin to the energy needed to re-invoke the life-force. The thunderers or al-mizamzamin In the afternoon of this Great Night, just before dusk, a group of men known as al-mizamzamin would traditionally arrive in Luxor from the town of Qus, accompanying a lone drummer. On this "ancient drum of the sheikh" ("Only the skin has been replaced; the frame is original," he attests) the main mizamzam beats out his encoded message: "titiQadum . . . titiQadum: It is coming closer ... It is coming closer . . . and when he arrives at the shrine in Luxor several hours later, the master drummer thumps out, ahna JEEna . . . ahna JEEna: we have come ... we have come." As the mizamzam says, This trek we do for Sidi Abu'l Hajjaj . . . for his annual mulid. We come to see him . . . We pass through all the towns?in each spending about ten minutes?just like the sheikh did. We follow in his footsteps today and those followers of his who came with him. We walk in their footsteps."33 The mizamzamin set out to retrace the ancient "path" taken by the sheikh from Qus to Luxor in the thirteenth century, stopping at pre-determined way-stations along the way to eat and drink. As such, this constitutes another historic and remarkably literal re-enactment, harking back, reputedly, to the thirteenth century. The re-tracing of previously significant paths of holy men or women as a way of imbibing grace constitutes the second major leitmotif of Egyptian festival tradition, though in this case, the procession follows a slightly different north-to-south route by the Nile. The use of drums to communicate with the divine using symbolic language is an element that recurs several times in the mulid, but has no explicit ancient Egyptian or Islamic counterpart. 32 Johann Michael Vansleb, The Present State of Egypt or a New Relation of a Late Voyage into that Kingdom performed in the years 1672 and 1673 (London, 1678) quoted in Murnane, "The Opet Feast and the Temple of Luxor," 4. 33 Oral comm., Qus drummer, 1985.</page><page sequence="14">416 JARCE 45 (2009) The ritual jousting or al-mirmah Another event integral to the mulid is al-mirmah,^ the mock jousting and equestrian games held after the afternoon prayer (bacd al-(asr) on the last three climactic days of the mulid festival. Accompanied by zummara flutes, individual riders wielding staves and seated astride jewel- encrusted silver saddles, gallop as fast as possible down the concourse. The challenge for the riders is to display their prowess in jousting, and then to race, stopping abruptly and dramatically, at the very end of the strip. According to Luxor residents, this sport "derives from the Fatimids" whose conquest and occupation of Upper Egypt from Qus in the early Middle Ages until the twelfth century, is well documented."35 Al-mirmah is explicitly not a race; rather, it is deemed to be a re-enactment of the by gone days of al-firusiyya or "chivalry" when men's jousting skills were highly esteemed. Re-enactments of symbolic acts, in this case, rites identified with mediaeval jousting games and chivalry, constitute another leitmotif of Egyptian tradition and the contemporary mulid. As is visible in the 1925 Harry Burton archive, the older mirmah would traditionally take place by the sari, the ritual mast pole implanted in front of the temple of Luxor. Moreover, it was played out along the Avenue of Sphinxes, the north-south thoroughfare which formed the processional path of "the Beautiful Feast of Opet," linking the Temple of Karnak and the Temple of Mut to the Luxor Temple, another example of "retracing." A few decades ago, the games were transferred to a narrow stretch of desert outside the new mosque steps, but still were played along the original North/South axis. When a City Council law was passed permitting the erection of tourist kiosks in that very place, however, the concourse of the mirmah shrank to a tiny strip, and by 1985 the mirmah had been forced to move to a broad grassy expanse of field on the outskirts of Luxor towards Karnak. Al-mirmah was still to be performed along a North/South axis, however. Stick dancing or al-tahtib Another traditional game performed at the mulid is "stick-dancing" or sparring with sticks, known in Arabic as al-tahtib, or in SaHdi as is-so. In this spontaneously organized spectacle, two men swirl their long quarter staves into the air, each leaping and encircling his opponent in an attempt to crush the other with a deft numbing blow. This is a contest of skill based on balance, agility and muscle con trol rather than brute strength, and the contestants attract a large crowd. As one man admits defeat, another spectator rises and challenges the victor. The consummate skill in al-tahtib is to adopt a strat egy of feints and dodges, rather than force, and the elegance and poise of its players are the qualities most admired. Stick-dancing does not appear as part of the Opet Feast celebrations but an ancient counterpart can be found in the stick-fighting rituals depicted in the New Kingdom tomb of Kheruef on the West Bank of Luxor (al-(Asasiif) performed as part of the king's renewal festival or Heb Sed celebrations, and at the raising of the Djed pillar. In these scenes, men wielding lotus wands (in other words, sym bolic weapons), as well as staves, similarly engage each other in ritual contests which have no winner. The ritual reciters or al-jamca A singular, noted spectacle of the mulid in recent history was al-jamca, a group of Sufi adepts who would arrange themselves in opposing ranks by the sari, and thus, in front of the shrine, for a riddling duel. Based on their knowledge of Sufi parables and epithets, they would toss phrases back and forth 34 From ramaha: "to pierce with a lance" or "to gallop." 35 Jean Garcin, Qus, un centre musulman de la Haute-Egypte mediaevale (Cairo, 1976).</page><page sequence="15">WICKETT 417 Fig. 6. Men on the steps of shrine. and while these cryptic metaphysical allusions would appear obscure to the uninitiated, the wit and dexterity of these poets would generate great admiration and occasionally laughter. In 1958, this group was photographed by the san,36 but by the late 1980s, that generation of devotees had died out and left no heirs to spar after them. Just as in the other ritual contests, the performances by the jam (a involved ritual sparring for the sake of pleasure at the encounter rather than the desire to win. The evening feast or al-casa Particular ritual foods would become imbued with the grace of the sheikh on the eve of his Great Night. Households of Luxor would open their doors to any guests and feed them the ritual meal of kibab, intended to emulate the ancient food of the sheikh and to embody his divine grace. Formed from the recipe more commonly known as kubaiba in Egypt, this minced meat concoction pounded with grain and onions resembles its Iraqi counterpart, and so directly commemorates the food of their Iraqi sheikh. To fulfil the obligation to the sheikh to offer hospitality, most women devote the night before to the preparation of huge quantities of kibab and to the kneading of dough for the hundreds of loaves of sun-leavened bread to be baked in traditional mud brick ovens. 36 Photograph in Rudolf Kriss and Hubert Kriss-Heinrich, Volksglaube im bereich des Islam (Wiesbaden 1960).</page><page sequence="16">418 JARCE 45 (2009) In former times, devotees of the sheikh would also gather by the mast pole on the Great Night to partake of ful nabit, sprouting fava beans given freely to any pilgrim so that he or she might imbibe directly the baraka or grace of Abu'l Hajjaj. The feasting tradition still continues to the present day, but within the "profane" confines of the Sufi tents, rather than the open but once "sacred" space by the sari. Council of the sheikh or al-majlis From the perspective of al-Hajajiyya, the other very significant event that would take place in former times, on al-lela al-kabira by the sari, was the majlis, the chanting of litanies for Sidi Abu'l Hajjaj by a cantor from the nearby village of Matcana. The liturgy would be followed by a zikr to be performed by al-Hajajiyya in honor of the sheikh, an indication that the tradition of veneration involved zikr by his descendants as well as by members of Sufi orders, visiting the mulid. Since the removal of the sari, however, this holy observance has also been shifted into the modern mosque. As descendants of al-Hajajiyya told me in the 1980s, their zikr would be performed with greater restraint and decorum than the more ecstatic and effusive zikr performed for Sheikh al-Tayyib, and therefore, in their view, more properly conducted in the sacred space of the mosque rather than in the secular open space by the sari. At the conclusion of the chanting but as part of the ritual, al-Hajajiyya would then partake of a communal feast: small funerary cakes known as manun, and an infusion called sahlab. The consump tion of these ritual cakes and drinks, along with the kibab, the ful and the candy (arusa and caris, offer ings by the faithful to the sheikh, would permit the imbibing of divine grace or baraka. As is evident from the multifaceted nature of these offerings, the notion of "ingesting grace" constitutes another an important facet of Egyptian mulid tradition. The day of the procession: al-dora or "The Going Round" On the morning of the procession, camels would be brought from Karnak to the sari in front of Luxor temple, just like the ancient barques of the gods were once brought in the Opet Feast. There, the canopies from various houses of al-Hajajiyya would be brought together and freshly picked half grass would be woven into rope to bind the rectangular wooden frames known as tabut (pi. tawabit), literally, "tombs" or "sarcophagi," onto the camels' backs. These structures bear physical and seman tic resemblance to the naoi or sarcophagus-like boxes in which the statuary of the gods would have been concealed for the ancient Egyptian Opet Feast procession. Now, incense is wafted over the ropes while the litters are affixed, and at a critical point, more manun, the sacred cakes traditionally offered at funerals to the bereaved, are processed down the steps by Sufi devotees from the town of Quft (ancient Koptos near Qus). As Jamal al-Hajaji recounted, in the 1980s, crashing his cymbals (has) together in rhythmic accompaniment, their leader, al-Denderawy, would lead by chanting this poetic eulogy to the sheikh: "Pray unto him," the cultivator cried, "Pray unto him!" Across his face fell the light, For he is the Prophet and His peace reigns long For you are the Prophet that heals the sick</page><page sequence="17">WICKETT 419 Like Him is the moon that gleams from afar While the moon gleams?the cultivator's delight While the moon gleams and the cultivators speak out: "Pray unto Him," the cultivator cried, "For He is the Prophet and His light is agleam For you are the Prophet," and the cultivator speaks out "For you are the Knowing God," and the cultivator cried out, "Pray unto Him," and the cultivator cried, "He hurled pearls onto the seabed and thus the sea was filled. For He is the Beloved who bore fruit and came into being. For He is the Beloved who bore fruit and came into being. For He is the Prophet, Pray unto Him."37 Subsequently, a group of male dancers with a tar (a broad, shallow frame drum) would strike up a clappers' chorus while one man danced around in a circle. This was known as the sagfa or clapping dance, and while their instruments differ slightly from those depicted in the Opet Feast represen tations, the putative function of the clappers: to act as an advance party to the procession, would appear to have remained the same. "The Going Round" or al-dora The procession to mark the culmination of the mulid encircles the core of modern Luxor and is locally known as al-dora or "Going Round." As a prelude, the appliqued canopies (known as tobltiyab: literally "garments"), are placed on the camel litters and paraded around individual houses to convey the sheikh's blessing before the procession starts. These perform the same function as the ancient textiles draped over the naoi in the Opet Feast and are believed to absorb and retain the baraka or grace of the sheikh for the coming year. At the same time, the sails of the three boats are rigged and attached by ropes to the rifas or ferryboat, the largest of the three. After their festooning with streamers and palms, the boats are loaded up with children who pay a token sum to sit in the divine vehicle of the sheikh. They, in turn, are given silver pennies (millim) to hurl at passersby during the procession, coins which are said to "embody the baraka of the sheikh." Surrounded by a clamor of youths, the parade of boats, litters and floats thronged with chanting figures pulling on the ropes, the procession snakes its way around the environs of Luxor in the sear ing heat, "to the left, just as the sheikh wound his thread." While the members of the marakabiyya clan sing and clap, the drums throb and a male belly dancer swirls his hips suggestively between the ropes, apparently reveling in the fecundity of this holy space. Behind the sacred canopies and boats are the carriages of musicians and dancers plus the floats of the hiraf or trade guilds of Luxor. The descendant of the sheikh is enthroned in his horse-drawn carriage in an arc of palm branches while each float is festooned with the artefacts of the trade: the plumber's guild members clutch their wrenches, while the enthusiastic painters flaunt their brushes. Some jubilant bystanders wave palms ripped from trees, or throw peanuts on the floats as they pass Recorded by the author and transcribed by Jamal Zaki al-Din al-Hajaji.</page><page sequence="18">420 JARCE 45 (2009) Fig. 7. Sufi adepts swirl swords during the "Going Round. " by, and many rush to touch the ropes pulling the boats as they are believed to bestow particular grace on those who pull them. The "close-up" of hands pulling the boats in the Opet Feast reliefs would seem to suggest that a similar importance was assigned to the act of touching and pulling the ropes in ancient times. The tabut or tabernacle of Sitt Tarzah The nuptials of Abu'l Hajjaj and Sitt Tarzah are no longer officially celebrated, but in 1925, the shrouded tabut of Sitt Tarzah was one of the many canopied litters brought out in the long pro cession. Her mock tomb was easily recognizable, people say, as it was "slung backwards in a supine position," as if reclining in response to the sheikh's amorous advances. Her tabut is no longer pa raded; instead, a satirical pantomime of a mock king and his transvestite "queen" is acted out by the naqqasin or painters' guild in what might be seen a carnivalesque inversion of the mystical consum mation by "god and god's wife" in the Opet Feast. The scene varies from year to year: in one year, two burly figures, locked in a pseudo-embrace, cavorted comically at the front of the painters' float, the king, wearing a paper crown and his buxom "queen" swirling his hips suggestively, while in another year, the plumber "king," wielding a wrench in one hand and a paint brush in the other, grinned as he swabbed down his hairy but busty "queen" with Schweppes soda, making her "sweet" for her wedding night. The pantomime of the "queen" and her ardent "king" constitutes the climatic finale to the proces sion. The boats are propelled back to the starting point of the procession, the shrine steps where the sari once stood, and dispatched with a prayer "for the return": "Abu'l Hajjaj, May you return!" This same chant was once uttered for Sitt Dimiana, a Coptic saint revered in Upper Egypt and in the</page><page sequence="19">WICKETT 421 Fig. 8. Children in the boats of Abu 7 Hajjaj. Delta,38 and therefore, once a message that traversed confessional boundaries and may have been invoked at all mulids. Ancient Symbols Revisited The mast pole or sari The excavation of Luxor Temple and the replacement of the sari by the circular configuration of electricity poles which cannot either be removed or "put up" has obscured the historical importance of this symbolic mast pole. Belief in the immanence of the divine and the act of "raising it up" has been a leitmotif of Egyptian theological tradition for millennia. The wooden pole which used to be left to lie on the floor in the lee of the shrine and was "raised up" as a symbol of the mulid of the sheikh, was once the seminal focus of the core mulid rituals, namely, al-mirmah, al-tahtib, al-(asa, al majlis, and al-dora, rituals visible in the 1925 Harry Burton film archive. The "rising up" of the camels, for example, flanked by an inspired performance of al-dosa (or "treading" on the blades of swords) would also take place by the sari. The graphic depictions of ritual acts by kings and gods bear witness to ancient enactments and rit uals in ancient Egypt from which interesting comparisons and juxtapositions may be drawn. Recon structions of the pre-Dynastic shrine of the fertility god Min in Koptos, now Quft (ca. 3300 bc), for example, show a primitive hut flanked by an erect pole ending in two prongs, as if to represent a 38 "For the return, O Dimiana, Dimiana lives in the desert wasteland and they come to her by the hundreds and thousands, all for the love of Dimiana. For the return, O Dimiana," as quoted by Murnane, "The Opet Feast and the Temple of Luxor," 3.</page><page sequence="20">422 JARCE 45 (2009) Fig. 9. Men climbing poles around mast pole, Tomb of Pepy II, Saqqara (after Jequier, Fouilles a Saqqara, pi. 12). tree.39 A millennium later, in the Old Kingdom tomb of Pepy II at Saqqara, ca. 2278-2184 bc, the following text was inscribed on the tomb walls: "His Majesty has ordered the setting up of a mast of foreign wood in this new town."40 Flinders Petrie suggested that the erection of what might have been a Syrian fir-tree, like the maypole in Europe, could have been the focus of popular worship in the same way that the insignia of the goddess Neith, crossed arrows on a stan dard, stood in the midst of her courtyard in the First Dynasty. In the accompanying relief, men wearing os trich plumes and variegated striped garments are depicted climbing up four poles, secured by guy ropes and affixed to the main mast pole, in front of the king.41 He is portrayed as life-size while the climbing scene is reduced in scale. Jequier, who excavated King Pepy IPs tomb in 1936, suggested that this ritual which may have had some significance in performance of the king's Heb Sed festival, was later interpolated into another festival, the "Feast of the Going Forth of Min." Approximately eight hundred years later, two representations of a similar scene with men climbing ropes rather than poles were inscribed in the Hypostyle Hall and on a Western wall of the temple of Luxor, during the reign of Amenhotep III.42 In these last two representations, the ritual act of climbing is inserted as a miniaturised scene between the king in his ritual regalia and the ithyphal lic god Min at the celebration of the Min feast, as if critical to the king's well being. The inscription in Luxor temple reads: 'To erect the shn.t (mast pole) for his father so that he may bestow life like Re forever,"43 a text which suggests that at that time, the erection of the mast pole was conceived of as an act of commemoration of patrimony and regeneration of the life-force, in some way, linked to conceptions of the god Min. Interestingly, portrayals of the same climbing ritual also can be found in the Ptolemaic temples of Karnak, Edfu, and Dendera, an indicator of the spread and perpetuation of this custom across this region of Upper Egypt.44 In addition, the image of a "wrapped mast," that is, a mast pole bound in cloth, was the symbol of the divine in ancient Egypt. Its hieroglyph denoting "god" was a triangular flag on a short pole (netjer). In the contemporary Sufi tradition, flags are always flown to symbolise the presence of the spirit though there is no inherent connection between the two. Yet from the fact that the erection of the pole in Luxor was always accompanied by the prayer sung to al-da'im, "the Eternal Lord," we may conclude that the raising of the pennant marked the start of the celebration for the revivification of 39 http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/3d/coptos/coptosl.html, University College, 2002. 40 W.

Men climbing ropes at the "Going Forth of Min," Luxor Temple (after Gayet, Le Temple de Louxor, pi. 10). the eternal spirit of Abu'l Hajjaj at his mulid. in ways not dissimilar to celebrations for the god Min at his renewal feast. The platform on which the climbing pole was raised during the Old Kingdom festival and later at the "Going Forth of Min" feast, was called in ancient Egyptian, shn-t or shn, or, with vowels added, sahanlsahana. According to al-Hajj (Abdulla, the site on which the sari would be raised was the saha, in front of the shrine steps. Because of the physical correspondence between what appears to be the ancient architectural form of the shn.t platform and its twentieth century counterpart, the depiction of Amenhotep engaged in a ritual derived from the Feast of Min and finally, the importance ascribed to the sari and the saha in mulid ritual, there is some evidence to suggest that the word and its root concept may constitute a form of linguistic and symbolic derivation and transformation from ancient Egyptian to Coptic to SaHdi. Another interpolation of rites from the Min feast occurs in the Opet feast itself: the "father" god of the Theban triad, Amun Re, becomes fused with Min into what is described as the "ithyphallic form of Amun" or "Amun-Re-Kamutef," meaning "Amun, the bull of his mother." According to the mythology, this manifestly virile form of the divinity would consummate his mystical marriage with the "god's wife" in the harim or Birth Room of the Luxor temple during the Opet Feast, in the person of the Pharaoh and his queen, for the renewal of life and well being of the deities. The north-south orientation of the procession Three pieces of evidence suggest that the orientation of the processional way known as the Avenue of Sphinxes, be it earthen or water-borne, was not only significant in ancient times but remains important to devotees in the modern context. The original alignment of the Opet Feast procession to a north/south orientation may have been derived from the orientation of Karnak temple to particular astronomical parameters, but the invocation by the phyles for the "outstretching of the sky to south</page><page sequence="22">424 JARCE 45 (2009) and north" during the ritual sailing of the barques at the Opet Feast suggests that they may have been singing a prayer for cosmic stability. The "stretching of the cord" in ancient Egypt, used to establish the north/south axis of a new sacred structure and aligned to the stars, was a ritual in which the poles of north and south were symbolically "extended." Although there appears to be no specific evidence that the ancient Egyptians were aware of the precession of the equinoxes which takes place because of the earth's non-spherical shape (as a result of which, the axis of rotation of the earth changes direction, causing a shift in its ce lestial poles), it is not inconceivable that this astronomical shift was observed. These celestial poles did shift in the course of Egyptian history. Moreover, the continuing alignment of the mirmah ritual to the same direction, millennia later, would seem to stress the importance, even now, of perpetuat ing the tradition of retracing the north/south axis. Another example may illuminate the significance of this north-south retracing. In the Zinacantecan festival of San Laurence and San Sebastian in the Oaxaca region of Mexico, a similar horse "race" takes place, believed once to have been performed to honor the Pre-Hispanic "race" of the sun's solstice. It was called "the Fleet Path of Huitzilopochtli." The ritual consisted of what originally was "the rapid running of a circle in a counter-clockwise direction," and has since been transposed into a race from East to West and back again to the same point, effectively, the tracing and re-tracing of a ritual concourse.45 Anthropologist Eva Hunt, in her attempt to disentangle the meaning of a cryptic mythical poem which included an allusion to this race, has hypothesized that this may have been a ritual designed to retrace that ancient equinoctial path. What was noteworthy in that ritual race, as with the mirmah, is that there was no winner; the significance of the re-enactment lay in the re-tread ing of the north-south axis along the racecourse. The earlier temples of Amun Re at Karnak appear to have been aligned to the summer and winter solstice, and therefore, the commemorative practice of retracing the N/S axis of the Avenue of Sphinxes in the mirmah, coupled with the ancient sailor's song to the "outstretching of the sky to north and south," may be seen to allude to a now obscure, but implicit, notion of retracing the equi noctial path. Other cosmological underpinnings of the sailors or phyles song may also be important to explore. The ancient Egyptians conceived of the firmament as a bounded space supported by four supports or poles. Al-Hajj cAbdulla in the 1980s suggested that the celestial sphere was supported by the four arch saints or aqtab (including Sayyidna al-Hidr and other celebrated holy men) who would come to visit Abu'l Hajjaj during the celebration of his mulid. In the ancient Egyptian sky religion, the celestial pole of heaven was the axis around which the circumpolar stars would revolve, and the phyle's song, therefore, might have represented a prayer for the stability of the two axes, the north and south celestial poles. During the mulid, al-Hajj cAbdulla insisted that the four arch-saints or aqtab represented the four pillars of stability in the cosmos just as the entombed Abu'l Hajjaj, bestowed with divine grace by God, was the symbol and guarantor of Luxor's eternal stability. In that sense, the mulid is much more than a simple festival of rebirth: to its devotees, its celebration still is crucial to the stability and dura bility of the known universe.46 The funerary boats The processing of the boats of Abu'l Hajjaj in the "Going Round" would seem to be a tradition de rived from the greatest antiquity. Boats intended to convey the soul through the heavens for eternity 45 Eva Hunt, Transformations of the Hummingbird: cultural roots of a Zinacantecan mythical poem (Ithaca, 1977), 224. 46 Excerpted from For Those Who Sail to Heaven, 48', an anthropological documentary produced and directed by the author (Cairo/London, 1990).</page><page sequence="23">WICKETT 425 have been placed next to graves in Egypt for a period exceeding seven millennia. 7 In Pre-Dynastic times, miniature pottery boats were placed in tombs and on one, a terracotta figure was actually placed under a woven reed awning in his funerary barque, as if the deceased were sailing off.48 In the Old Kingdom, more than four millennia ago, full-size funerary boats, rather like the feluccas cur rently designed for Abu'l Hajjaj's annual procession, were also buried next to kings' pyramids in pits. Moreover, the burial of miniature model boats like those found in the southeast corner of the pyra mid of Queen Neith, consort of Pepy II, also in the Old Kingdom, gives credence to the idea that the deceased required an actual or, at least, a symbolic boat in the afterlife to be able to sail on the celes tial waters of heaven for eternity. One event illustrates how the boats of Abu'l Hajjaj were perceived to act as "funerary boats" con veying the soul of the sheikh and his ancestral spirit after death. In 1917, on the death of the halifa, the sheikh's living descendant, the boat of the sheikh was brought and paraded around Luxor, as if to convey him to eternal repose. Moreover, even after the devastating fire had destroyed the maqsura or tomb enclosure of Abu'l Hajjaj, in March 2009, two miniature paper barques given as ex-votos to the sheikh were currently in situ, placed strategically on either side of the entrance door. The boats of Abu'l Hajjaj (which would typically be placed by the wooden litters outside the shrine), had at that time been removed to protect them during the reconstruction process. According to the tomb keep ers, they would be restored to their rightful position after the tomb had been restored. The procession of boats during mulid processions was not unique to Abu'l Hajjaj, either. The boat in which the revered sheikh, Sidi Abdelrahim al-Qenawy, would have been symbolically processed at his annual dora, once hung from the tree next to his zawiyya in Qena, and a felucca rigged with sail and placed on a painted cart was seen to have been pulled along in the gala procession of the mulid of Sidi Ibrahim al-Dessouqi in the Delta in the 1980s.49 Both examples suggest that the circumambulation of the sheikh in his boat may have been believed to propel the regeneration of his latent spiritual power in order that his blessing and powers of intercession could be invoked and conferred on the faithful. Conclusion Celebratory tradition, as represented in the contemporary mulid of Abu'l Hajjaj, is a fusion of ritual re-enactments and belief in the interrelationship of the divine and the human in the cosmic order, transposed and transformed in the contemporary context into a new assemblage of ideologies and religious precepts. Abu'l Hajjaj's conquest of Tarzah and her subsequent conversion is still com memorated and celebrated in the fact that the mulid procession now "turns left. . .just as the sheikh wound his thread" but the sacred consummation is not. The "marriage" of Abu'l Hajjaj and Sitt Tarzah which had been celebrated prior to 1917 in the fabrication of the famous "nuptial bed" as one of the complement of sugar dolls and objects to be consumed, and at least until 1925, in the "Going Round," is no longer the focal point. The modern mulid reveals no outward and visible signs of this core legend and yet it lingers on in the folk consciousness. In fact, ironically, the tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the mock king and his transvestite queen suggests a flagrant reversal of the original. It celebrates the erotic union of a peasant "king" and his busty consort, a pseudo-woman. The Opet Feast rituals were to have been celebrated by a "flesh and blood" king and his queen, not as physical beings, but as personifications of the deities. Now, the characters have changed: the king in whom 47 The earliest model boats, made of clay in imitation of papyrus bundle skiffs, were discovered in the Neolithic site of Mer imda Bani Salama. At the Pyramid of Queen Neith, sixteen model boats were found, as well as boat pits, some of which would have enclosed life-size funerary boats such as were found by the Pyramid of Khufu; other funerary boat enclosures found in Saqqara indicate that some boats would have been placed above ground (notably like those of Sidi Abu'l Hajjaj). 48 W. M. Flinders Petrie, Prehistoric Egypt (London, 1920), 17. 49 Oral comm., Nicholas Biegman.</page><page sequence="24">426 JARCE 45 (2009) divine power was invested and his consort, personification of the goddess Mut, have been replaced by hoi polloi in a travesty of a divine wedding. Other rituals have similarly been symbolically reversed. Popular rituals once deemed integral to the mulid, sacred and performed pro fanum (literally "in front of the temple" but in this context, not profane) have been, in a sense, relegated to the marginalized groups of Sufi devotees and "the folk"; activities now deemed to be sacred to the sheikh have been transferred to his shrine and before the disastrous fire, his adjacent mosque. We may conclude, therefore, that an inversion of ideals and religious conceptions has taken place in the contemporary sensibility. The contemporary Luxor festival tradition seems, at different points in its history, to have absorbed an impressive array of ancient Egyptian celebratory rituals (some known from Pre-Dynastic times such as the "Going Forth of Min" and others from the Opet Feast) as well as various leitmotifs, specif ically, the "raising up" of the divine, the retracing of sacred ways, the re-enactment of symbolic con flicts, rituals designed to celebrate vitality and reawaken the divine life-force for eternity. At the same time, the mulid has assimilated practices normally associated with the Fatimid Shiite cult of the visita tion of sheikhs and Sufi tradition. Though many of these, both ancient and more contemporary have been expunged, adherence by the sheikh's descendants to the ritual of processing the funerary boats of Abu'l Hajjaj stands out as the paramount feature of the celebration. Other important organizational synchronicities of ancient and modern are also striking. Like the ancient phyles, the marakabiyya families perform their role as honorary boatmen to the sheikh as a consequence of hereditary sanction and privilege, and infuse the celebration with understanding of the cosmic significance of the sheikh's power and influence. Despite the distillation over time of ideas and gradual shifts in rituals, the "Going Round" is still celebrated as a procession of the sheikh's liv ing soul and his "conquest" of Luxor and immortalized in the encirclement of the temple precinct which "proceeds to the left." The political and religious significance of the event in modern Luxor history is, therefore, still paramount: the defeat of matriarchy and the "old" religion resulting in the privileged ascent to power by the Muslim sheikh and his descendants. From the popular perspective, moreover, the observance of the mulid is in the consummate public interest. The annual festival continues to inspire and excite al-Hajajiyya as well as the sheikh's devo tees from all over Egypt, many of whom are itinerant and amongst the poorest and most marginal ized groups. These men and women who regard themselves as members of the Silsila?that is, of the lineage of the Prophet Mohammed and his "House of the Prophet"?are the prime movers in many of the core performances of the mulid, and thus, perpetrators of many of the oral traditions. Therefore, the power of the mulid and its significance extends far beyond the inhabitants of Luxor town. As the sheikh is propelled in his boats on the "Going Round," the baraka of the sheikh is dispersed to the faithful for the coming year. The locals say, "Abu'l Hajjaj is the one who makes us feel renewed." In this place where the ancient Pharaoh "was made young," the annual feast of renewal is no longer per formed merely for the king, but for the benefit of all the inhabitants of Luxor and those who honor him. Mulid festivals for saints and sheikhs are not anachronistic or archaic celebrations, therefore. They embody the tradition of millennia in an ancient space. Via the continuing impact of historical transformations and re-enactments perceived as Fatimid, Abbasid or contemporary Islamic, as this mulid so vividly shows, popular celebrations can adapt to change and absorb new influences without threat to the participants' core belief systems. The contemporary festival, significantly transformed in the last century, still captures the interest and fervour of the public, a clear endorsement of the popularity of Egyptian celebratory traditions and an affirmation of public faith in the belief in the capacity of their sheikh, Sidi Abu'l Hajjaj, divine intercessor between God and man, to grant life and well-being for the benefit of all, for eternity.
