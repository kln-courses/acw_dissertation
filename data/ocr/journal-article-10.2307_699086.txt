<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME DIFFICULTIES IN OVID, FAS'I III. (a) 283-4: atque aliquis, modo trux, uisa iam uertitur ara uinaque dat tepidis farraque salsa focis. Mr. Bailey notes: 'uertitur, " is changed," almost "converted."' No doubt the word can have this meaning; but as the next line men- tions the offering made by the repentant trux, is it not likelier that it means 'turns' in the literal sense ? For the ritual turn in prayer, see among other passages Livy V. 21, 16; Lucr. V. I198 ff. (b) 715-16 : nec referam Semelen, ad quam nisi fulmina secum Iuppiter adferret, partus inermis eras. I do not enter into the grammatical difficulties of this passage; through the mist of doubtful readings and interpretations this seems to emerge clearly, that if Iuppiter had not appeared to Semele with his lightnings, her child Bakchos would have been inermis-i.e., presumably, an ordinary babe, without the horns which, as bull or serpent, he regularly wore; a roundabout way of saying that he would not have been divine. For the idea that to be struck by light- ning confers divinity (instead of merely making the victim sacer) see Diod. Sic. V. 52, 2. (c) In his note on 851 ff., Mr. Bailey says: 'No doubt in primitive thought Phrixus was himself the ram.' I would deprecate the as- sumption (I) that the theriomorphic form of a deity or hero must be the older, (2) that close association with a beast proves former identity with it. For (I) though theriomorphism is a very old belief, perhaps resulting from the same frame of mind which produces totemism (it is not identical with the latter, as some belated Continental writers seem to imagine), neverthe- less for any given area it is not necessarily prior to anthropomorphism, and for Greece in particu- lar we have Achaian and pre-Achaian evidence for anthropomorphic deities, while Kekrops and other such monstrosities are so far as we know later, Dionysos and Zeus-Ammon foreign. (2) We should remember such facts as the association of both Mithras and Hermes with the cock, of whom the former shows no trace of a beast form, the latter is much older in Greece than the HleporsI&amp;b i'pVtr. What does result from our material is a singularly close association between Phrixos and the fleece of the rain. In Pindar (Pyth. IV. 159) he appears in a dream !and dX'2Xrat E v r#xhv KOPlaL.a p. . . Dipa rE Kpiov IaOv"1aXXov a'yEtv ; but when the Fleece is won no one seems to doubt that the whole errand is accom- plished. It would seem to follow that the two are identical-i.e., that Phrixos is of the numer- ous kin of the Giant with no heart in his body, and the Fleece was his 'external soul.' H. J.
