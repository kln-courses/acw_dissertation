<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SYMBOLISM OF THE 'UD by Theodore Grame The 'tid (Arabic: wood) is the instrument par excellence of Arab classical music; for a thousand years poets have chanted its praises throughout the length and breadth of Islam. In both name and substance al-'fid has migrated far and wide, to Europe, Africa, and Western Asia; its pear-shaped back is a familiar object if only because painters took delight in delineating it in oriental miniatures and European paintings. The pear-shaped lute belongs to an extremely widespread family that includes among many other representatives the Chinese p'ip'a and the biwa of Japan. Morphologically, the p'ip'a is very like the 'rid: Both instruments possess rounded back, lateral pegs, a swept-back peg box, and wooden bellies. An origin in the area of Persial has been postulated for the instrument, but the earliest clear delineation of a pear-shaped lute is found in the Gandhara frescoes of India (c. 100 A. D. )2, though this instrument possesses what Sachs calls a "barb"-- -actually a sort of waist. This aspect, in the opinion of the present writer, likens the instrument more to the Persian tar than to the 'id. We have pointed out above that the 'rid and its relatives have wooden bellies as a distinguishing characteristic; it is possible in this way to rather clearly distinguish the members of this family from the equally common skin-bellied lutes. It is probable that the name, al-'fid, refers to the wooden belly specifically since "it was when the wooden-bellied lute was adopted that the instrument was named the '*id. "3 While it is a musicological commonplace that the name means specifically "wood, "4 it is only fair to indicate that there are scholars who dissent from the commonly held view. Sachs, for instance, holds that the term refers, not to wood, but to "flexible stick. "5 Thus, he would connect the instrument to the Sumerian lute, with its sometimes curved handle, and, ultimately to the musical bow. Whatever may have been Sach's reason for this assertion, the lexicographical evidence does not seem to support such an interpretation of the Arabic word, except, perhaps, in the sense that a flexible rod may well be made of wood. Another opinion at variance with the usual one is given by d'Erlanger (who must be taken very seriously as an authority); he believes that the word 'iid used in its musical sense had the meaning of chelys (Greek: tortoise).6 He admits that the primary significance of 'iid is "wood, " but says that the two early Arabic lexicons, the Qamfis and Jawheri, give the sense of "tortoise. " This is extremely interesting, for not only venerable Greek tradition (Apollo, according to legend, fashioned the first lyre from a tortoise shell and its sinews) but actual manufacture of lutes utilizes the tortoise shell. Whatever the legendary and lexicographical significance of the word may be, there is no doubt, we shall see, that the principal significance of 'id, as the word applies to a musical instrument, is "wood. " On the simplest level, the instrument that is known by this name always possesses a wooden belly, but beyond this, a substantial body of legendary- poetic tradition stresses the primacy of the tree as the true progenitor of the 'gid, as we shall see presently. 25</page><page sequence="2">We have implied that there is a rather large number of legendary or fanciful notions regarding the origin of the lute, and each of them seems to somehow help to round out something of the total picture that in sum gives us the Semitic view of the instrument. According to Villoteau, 7 a number of Arab and Persian authors attributed the invention of the lute to such Greeks as Pythagoras, or Plato. Those who were in the Platonic camp describe him as a brilliant performer who was able, by playing appropriate music, to affect his auditors so strongly that he could first calm them, then put them to sleep, and finally to awaken them. They tell us further that Aristotle, who attempted to emulate Plato in this respect, was able to send his listeners to sleep, but unable to awaken them! For this reason, according to the tale, he became the disciple of Plato. Sautin, on the other hand, quotes Abd al-Qadir as saying that the 'fid was invented by Lamech -- son of Cain, that the drum was invented by Sala -- daughter of Lamech, that the tunbfir was invented by the people of Lot, and that the n, rather than the lute, was invented by Plato. 8 There is much that is of interest in these statements. In the first place, these derivations are symbolic of the dual heritage of Islamic music and culture, which drew its strength both from the Greeks and the Semites. It is appropriate, too, that the accursed children of Cain and Lot should be described in Arabic sources as the inventors of musical instruments. (The Hebrews them- selves said that Jubal, another of the sons of Lamech, was "the father of all such as handle the harp [kinnor, actually a lyre] and the organ ['ugab]"). 9 In other words, music, no matter what heights it may reach in the playing of a David, descends from, and is the prerogative of, the sin-ridden children of Cain and Lot. Anyone who has worked in North Africa can testify that even at the present time music remains a low-caste occupation that is closely identified in the eyes of respectable Muslims with depravity and sexual excess. 10 Moreover, like many other attitudes of Islam, this point of view is paralleled in popular attitudes towards the Griots of West Africa. 11 Further, a well-educated Tunisian once told the present writer that all musicians in his native land were prostitutes. We shall refer later to other aspects of this problem. There is one final bit of information to be wrung out of Abd al-Qadir's story: the invention of the lute was attributed to a son of Cain, and the drum to a grand- daughter. In this case too modern practice conforms to tradition, for the drum, in North Africa as in many other places, is a woman's instrument, while the lute is a man's. Indeed, in Mauritania, women are specifically excluded from playing the indigenous lute, the tidinitl2 The ninth-century savant Ibn Salama presents a story about the origin of the 'ud in his Kitab al-Malahr (Book of Musical Instruments) 3 that with its anthropo- morphic point of view is typical of a good deal of Arabic writing about musical instruments; its relative inaccessibility makes it worthwhile to include it in its entirety. Hisham ibn al-Kalbi [d. c. 819] mentioned that the the first who made the lute and played on it was a man of the sons of Qabil [Abel; the account is contrary to the one in Genesis] some say Qgbfn, the son of Adam, called Lamk [Lamech]. He had a long life, and as he had no children he married 26</page><page sequence="3">fifty wives and took two hundred concubines. Then two girls, one of whom was called Sila' and the other Yamk, were born to him. Afterwards a boy was born to him ten years before he died, and he was extremely pleased. But the boy died when he was five years old, and [Lamk] grieved sorely for him. So he took him and hung him on a tree and said: "His form will not depart from my eyes until he falls in pieces, or I die. Then his flesh began to fall from his bones till [only] the thigh remained, with the leg, foot, and toes. So he took a piece of wood, split it, made it thin, and began to arrange one piece on another. Then he made a chest to represent the thigh, a neck to represent the leg, a peg-box (ibzrm) the same size as the foot, and pegs (malnwf) like the toes; and to it strings like sinews. Then he began to play on it and weep and lament, until he became blind: and he was the first who sang a lament. What was made was called an 'ud (lute) because it was made from a piece of wood ('ud). To this account we might add a later, but related one, from the fifteenth century Kit&amp;b Kashf al-Humum (The Book of Important Discoveries).14 The first who made the ten-stringed lute was al- Farabt [not the famous philosopher of the same name] and the reason was this. A man died in the city in which he was living, and as he was one of the leading men... al-Farabr went to the funeral ..... While in the cemetery he passed a tomb which was uncovered where he saw a corpse.. . showing the legs and the veins. He counted the veins in the legs and found ten. It was this which prompted him to make a lute of ten strings. The interpretation of these two tales is difficult, and some would say that it was not worthwhile. We must remember, however, that this legendary material is as much a part of the history of, and the attitude towards, the instrument as its corporeal nature is; these stories, which must have been well known, were part and parcel of the Arab attitude towards the instrument. Moreover, the question of the anthropomorphism and zo5morphism is of first importance to the student of organology, and indeed it may well have revolutionary implications regarding the very nature of musical instruments; it would, however, be out of place to consider the matter further in the present work except insofar as it relates to the examples already quoted (and those to be considered presently). In the two tales that we have here re-told, the lute is first made, not because it is expected to sound only--or even primarily--but as a kind of composite aural- visual representation--a sounding, and hence superior statue, if you will, that in a way resurrects the dead. In other words, the instrument is not to be thought 27</page><page sequence="4">of only as a technological device for the production of sound, but rather as an organically unified corporeal object that exists, like the creatures after which it is patterned, visually, tactually, and aurally. To these anthropomorphic discussions we might add an example representative of another sort of common literary treatment of the instrument; in this genre, which was much in favor with poets, it is common to dwell on the implications that can be drawn from the origin of the instrument as part of a tree. In the Thousand and One Nights the poet sings:15 A tree while ere I was, the bulbul's home, To whom for love I bowed my grass-green head; They moaned on me, and I their moaning learnt And in that moan my secret all men read: The woodman felled me without offense, And slender lute of me (as view me) made; But, when the fingers smite my strings, they tell How man despite my patience did me dead. 15a Here, then, much is made of the transmission of music from the "moaning" of the bulbul to the tree, which then, slain by men, was able for ever to render the songs that it had learned from the birds. (In this connection it is not without interest to note that in a way this happens actually as well as figuratively, for the plectrum of the 'ud is made, in fact, from the plume or claw of a bird.) Thus the bird in one sense does sing on the strings of the lute in reality as well as in fancy. Such beliefs, we might add, are by no means confined to the Arab world. Armstrong16 quotes a medieval Irish poem about the famous harp of O'Brien in which the instrument is referred to as follows: Bring unto me the harp of my king Until upon it I forget my grief A man's grief is soon banished By the notes of the sweet-sounding tree He to whom this music-tree belonged He was a noble youth of sweet performance Many an inspired song he sweetly sang To that elegant, sweet voiced instrument. Again, in the great Finnish epic the Kalevala, the hero Wainamoinen, having lost his kantele made of fish-bone, wanders disconsolately through a forest. He hears the wailing of a birch-tree and says: I will turn thy grief to joyance Make thee laugh and sing with gladness Then the ancient Wainamoinen Made the harp [kantele] from sacred birch-wood.17 Later in the poem, Wainamoinen constructs tuning-pegs for the instrument from the gold and silver tones of the cuckoo; he fashions the strings from a maiden's tresses. 28</page><page sequence="5">Other instances of this way of thinking about instruments might easily be added; but as a generalization we might say that most exemplify one or more of the themes that we have given here: the instrument is made from the body of the beloved, from the corpse of a (totem) animal, or from a tree. We are not attempting to imply that there is a direct, casual relationship between the Celtic and Finno- Ugric worlds and the Semitic one--though we are not attempting to deny it either; the parallels, however, are too strong to ignore. Still another type of writing abounds in Islam about musical instruments; in the copious theoretical writings on music of such great Arabic-speaking philoso- phers as al Farabr, al-Kindf, and Avicenna(Ibn-Sina) there are many references to the lute that might be referred to as scientific, or scholarly. In these, instru- ments are treated mainly as aids that help to clarify the acoustical and physical nature of sound. For al-Farabr the lute is useful chiefly as a kind of laboratory instrument comparable to the monochord of medieval Europe. Farabf devotes many pages of his important Kitabu-l-Musigi al-Kabir (The Great Book on Music)18 to a discussion of the nature of pitch-relationships, referring oft n to the tuning and string division of the 'rid in order to demonstrate his points.1 Moreover, there was a feeling among TFese medieval savants that instrumental music was somehow inferior to song, a point of view that is familiar to students of European music. Far&amp;bt, for instance, believed that "notes engendered on all instruments are of a quality inferior to those of the voice. "20 Indeed, al-Farabr goes so far as to say that musical ability is of two kinds: the first is the perfect execution of "perfect" intervals by the voice, and the other consists of the playing of musical instruments. As far as the function of instrumental music is concerned, it furnishes preludes, responses, and interludes; further--and more practically-- it permits the singer to rest. This attitude towards the relationship between the instrumental and vocal components of a performance exists amongst the Berbers of Sidi Ifni, indeed, it is of extremely wide occurrence generally. It seems odd that F&amp;rabr' should express these views concerning the inferiority of instrumental music, for unlike most other philosophers who wrote about music, he was apparently a player of legendary skill. For example, there is an oft-quoted story concerning an incognito visit to the Caliph Sayf al-Dulat; while there, he was asked to play. When he did so, he at first made the audience burst into uncontrollable laughter; then he played another piece that made it weep; finally he put them all to sleep. 21 This story, undoubtedly apocryphal, is reminiscent of those that were told about his illustrious predecessors Plato and Aristotle; beyond this, however, it fur- nished a hint of the Arab attitude towards music itself. According to this, various modes had--and in the Maghrib, at least, still have--appropriate times of day for performance. Further, it is allied to the all pervasive doctrine of the ethos, which was dear to the hearts of these medieval writers on music. Avicenna, in his Kitsbu-l-Shifa' (Book of Mathematics)22 devotes most of the space that he allots to musical instruments to a discussion of problems of tuning and the physics of sound. He does inform us, however, that the 'ud is the best known of musical instruments and the one most in public favor. 23 Moreover, he amplifies the information concerning the number of strings on the lute that we gained from one of the above-mentioned anthropomorphic legends: he tells us that the lute sometimes has five courses, but more often four.24 The instrument, 29</page><page sequence="6">he says, was generally tuned in fourths, whether it had four or five pairs of strings. 25 It is possible in this early literature to find rather specific information regarding the desired physical qualities of the lute, though often this is combined by the authors into a general treatment of numerology and the doctrine of the ethos. We are provided with detailed instructions regarding the proper method of constituting lute strings, for example, in the Fourteenth-century Persian source, the Kanz al- Tuhaf. This manuscript says that the strings, if made of silk, should be "white, smooth, of equal gauge and well finished. These are boiled in water and ashes, and are then washed two or three times in pure water and dried in the shade. "26 After this is done, a paste is to be made of? the essence of saffron mixed with gum; this must be rubbed into the strings with a piece of linen, after which they are dried and ready for use. Next the source provides a description of the correct manner of producing strings of various gauges, and here we enter into the realm of numerology and the doctrine of ethos, which esoterica was of first importance to such philosophers as al-Kindi,27 a FFrabf, and Sa'adyah Goan.28 "The strings are... twisted into the following gauges. The bamm string is made of 64 threads, the mathlath of 48, the mathna of 32,the zir string of 24, and the had string of 16. 29 This series of numbers is chosen, not pragmatically, but because of its close relationship to the series of mathematical proportion (2 : 4 8 : 16 : 32 : 64). Echoes of this system are still able to be found today. This choice of numbers was by no means the only possible; the Ikhwan al-Safa', for instance, tell us that the proper number of strands for the four-stringed lute is 64, 48, 36, and 27. 30 The only number common to the two system, then, is 64. The Ikhwan explain that reason for their selection of proportions in the following manner: the primary element fire is a third greater in essence than air; air is a third greater than water; water is a third greater than earth. 31 Thus, each of the strings of the instrument is linked with one of the elements.32 Farmer33 has assembled from various sources a table that shows the ways in which these phenomena and substances relate to each other and to the four strings of the lute. The lowest string, bamm (A), is equated with old age, with water, with winter, and with night; the upper one, zir (C) is coupled with courage, fire, attractiveness, pride, and so on. The lower tones, then, symbolize resig- nation and quiescence, while the upper ones characterize activity and movement. Similar doctrines were widely propounded in the ancient world and in medieval Europe. The famous musician Ziryab, who played on occasion at the brilliant court of Harfin al-Rashfd, where his teacher performed, worked mainly in Andalusia, and while there he is said to have added a fifth course to the lute. 34 (We have already seen that another Andalusian, Avicenna, mentions the existence of a fifth string on the 'ud. ) Ziryab must have been a remarkable musician, for his emoluments are said to have amounted to 40, 000 pieces of gold each year. His inventiveness extended beyond the mere addition of a fifth string to his instrument, for his lute was much lighter35 than the usual one, and his strings, according to Ribera, 36 were constituted differently from those of other players, in that the lowest and 30</page><page sequence="7">third ones were made of lion-gut. The fourth string was black, the symbol of melancholy; the thircdwhite,for phlegm, the second,redfor blood; and the highest, yellow, for bile. He added a second red string in the middle, and it symbolized the soul. 37 The Ikhwan al-Safa' attempted to delineate the relationship between the strings of the lute and medical practices. The mathlath string, for example, gave "perfect health to those who are tormented with maladies that are ordinary to youth."38 The instrument, then, is integrated into nearly every aspect of Arab life. 39. Numerous old sources treat of the ideal proportions of the 'ud; it is rare indeed that actual measurements are given, but rather, the relationships of various parts to one another are explained. A common--though by no means invariable-- formula is as follows. 40 length of body = half again as much as width depth = half of width length of neck = one quarter of the length of body. As far as the actual size of the instrument is concerned, it is difficult to come to any one definitive conclusion, simply because so many sizes of lute existed. As a general rule, however, we might assign to the sound-chamber of the typical lute a width of about 15 inches and a length of about 20. An 'ud of approximately this size is delineated in a Thirteenth-century miniature from Spain or Morocco;41 it shows Bayad playing the instrument to his lady-love. If the hand of the player is about four inches in width the lute must more or less conform to the dimensions that we have given above. We are not confined to iconographical evidence in our investigations, however, for the Kanz al-Fuhaf confirms that the width was about what we have suggested, and that the depth was half of this. 42 Much larger lutes existed as well, however. In a miniature painted in the sixteenth century by the Persian miniaturist Mir Sayyid Alilthere is a delineation of a seated 'ud-player whose instrument is so large that he can barely reach his arm around the body in order to pluck the strings. 43 It must have been a lute of this size that a "very erudite oriental" described to Villoteau in the following words: The "true [veritable] 'ud was of a dimension much greater than the instru- ment that bears the name today; but, as its size [volume] rendered it extremely cumbersome, they have substituted for it the one that we know, and have dis- tinguished it by the name 'ud kuitra, which signifies small guitar-lute.. "44 A lute of this size is described in a fourteenth century source, the Hawi al-funfin wa salwat al-mahzan, by Ibn al-Tahhan al-Mfisfqf, according to whom the instru- ment is about three feet in width. 45 Authors differ markedly in their opinions as to the most satisfactory materials for construction of the 'lid: Ibn al-Tahhan prefers larch-wood. 46 Other writers prefer beech, elm, or walnut, but all agree that the wood should be light, thin, and well-seasoned. Moreover, it is essential that the wood be of even thickness both on the belly and the back. 31</page><page sequence="8">As to whether the medieval tud was fretted, there has been much controversy. Most scholars, who have relied on iconographical evidence, have concluded that the lute was not fretted, for there is no known delineation of a fretted 'ud, though many illustrations are extant. Farmer, however, adamantly maintained that the instrument was fretted. 47 He relied for this conclusion on the frequent use in the sources of the Persian word dasatin (hands; frets); further, it seems unrea- sonable to suppose that the lute when used for acoustical experiments would have been unfretted. Whatever may be the truth of his thesis--and it is possible to suppose that the 'ud, like the viola L aamba, was played both with and without frets--the evidence is quite incontrovertible that the present-day traditional 'ud is not fretted. Perhaps, as we have suggested, frets were used for investigations into the physics of sound, but were abandoned when virtuoso musicians performed. NOTES I. C.
