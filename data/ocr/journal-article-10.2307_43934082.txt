<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Homeric Gods : The Spiritual Sig- nificance of Greek Religion. By WALTER F. OTTO. Trans. Moses Hadas. New York: Thames and Hud- son, 1979. Pp. viii and 310. Paper. $7.95. Since th√© first edition of Otto's work appeared in 1929, and since it has been available in English since 1954, this paperback reprint will not take the schol- arly world by surprise. It is, however, worth calling to the public's attention, for it will make a thought-provoking addition to school and private libraries. The great merit of Otto's approach is his determination to take Homeric reli- gion seriously on its own terms. He does not treat it condescendingly as the quaint fantasy of a primitive people, or a poor substitute for scientific rationalism, or an early faltering step in man's long spiritual journey. Rather, he finds in Homer's vision of the divine a world-view which is rational and natural, and he undertakes to explain it as a theologian, or even (considering the fervor with which he often writes) as an apologist. For Otto, the achievement of Olym- pian religion was to see nature as gov- erned by "lofty," noble, beautiful beings with whom man could feel a close spiritual affinity. The world was no longer to be feared, for the unbending, inhumane order represented by the older gods (like the Titans and Furies) had re- ceded into the background. Nor was the world to be despised, for the Olympians were immanent in the order of nature, inclined to show their power by working through it and not (like the God of Chris- tianity) by transcending it or disrupting it. Instead, it could be enjoyed and lived in to the full, for the character of the anthropomorphic gods provided some point of contact with every aspect of human life. Such, in brief, are some of Otto's most important points. They are often uncon- vincing. Otto's picture of the gods is highly idealized, and often fails to take account of the violence with which they intervene in mortal affairs, of their capri- ciousness and cruelty, of the low comedy they often provide. These and other qualities which no doubt helped Homeric man explain the rough vicissitudes of life are too often passed over, played down, or subjected to tortuous rationalizations in Otto's book. However, Otto is right on a number of points, and his knowledge of the text commands respect. He can raise important questions and bring issues into focus even when he is wrong. The reader who is willing to wrestle with this book should improve his knowledge of the Homeric gods. - Philip Holt University of Georgia</page></plain_text>
