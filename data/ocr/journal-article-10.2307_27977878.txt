<plain_text><page sequence="1">1 THE SITE OF CHIBCHA BOGOTA Sylvia M. Broadbent The Sabana de Bogota is the southernmost and largest of a chain of high-level, flat bottomed valleys formed by Pleistocene lake beds in the Eastern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes. It is approximately 60 km. long and about 40 km. wide at its widest point; its floor lies at an altitude of a little under 2,600 m., and it is rimmed by mountains rising in some cases another 1,000 m., but generally less. This great valley is drained by the,R?o Bogot? or Funza and its tributaries, which trace meandering routes across its nearly level surface until the Bogota enters a narrow gorge leading to the spectacular Tequendama Falls, where it begins a steep descent down the western slope of the Cordillera to join the R?o Magdalena. In the central Sabana a noteworthy feature is the pantanos or ci?nagas, which are not exactly the marshes or swamps that their names suggest but long, narrow, almost stagnant bodies of water resembling river lagoons which drain, albeit slowly, into the rivers, especially the Bogota itself. The pantanos support a dense growth of reeds, and their fauna includes fish, water fowl, and guinea pigs. There is some historical basis for believing that these and other bodies of water were formerly more numerous, but many still exist. From the air and in aerial photographs one can often see traces of dried-up pantanos and ox-bow lakes, and also signs of what appear to be old drain age ditches that were made, perhaps in the historic period, to drain marshy areas. These ditch lines are especially numerous at certain points on both banks of the Rio Bogota, suggesting that these zones were formerly marshy. The Bogota is now contained by levees; flooding of low-lying areas is common during period of heavy rain but seems to be due to slow run-off from the extremely flat terrain more often than to overflow from the river? In fact, these floods may be more persistent now than in former times; levees keep floodwaters from draining into the river as well as keeping the river from overflowing, and the water may have drained off faster via the vanished marshes. At the time of the Spanish conquest the Sabana formed a major portion of the territory of the Chibcha. When the Spaniards first arrived they named this valley "el valle de los Alc?zares," because the many Indian towns they saw there, with their palisades, masts, and banners, made them think of castles or fortresses. It was particularly the number of towns in this area that impressed the Spaniards, not their great size; Spanish writers speak of the towns as being "a league or less apart."1 One of these towns was called Bogota and was the capital of the southern Chibcha kingdom, a capital from which the Zipa ruled a loosely organized domain stretching from Chocont? to Fusagasug?o^ In spite of the historical indications of a reasonably dense Indian population in the Sabana, few archaeological sites are known there. In view of the scarcity of known sites and the marshiness and flooding to which much of it is subject, it has been denied that the Chibcha made much use of the valley floor.3 Therefore, when landowners</page><page sequence="2">2 in the region of Funza, in the very heart of the Sabana, reported archae ological finds on their property, I decided to investigateci Pottery, burials, stone spindle whorls, and a few gold objects had been found in various locations over an area approximately two kilometers long, and local inhabitants say that potsherds appear wherever one digs in this area? Visual inspection of plowed fields, ditches, and other portions not obscured by vegetation showed that potsherds were continuously present over a width of nearly a kilometer at right angles to the ex tension suggested by local reports o Most of the artifacts seen in private collections and obtained by surface collection fit well into the types usually identified as "classic Chibcha:" Guatavita Sherd tempered pottery, 5 incised stone spindle whorls, and the highly characteristic metal "tunjos" or anthropomorphic figures a The site (see figo 1) lies alongside a body of water known locally as "El Pantano del Guali," although maps published by the Instituto Geogr?fico de Colombia ascribe this name to a connecting pantano lying somewhat to the north o The area where remains have been found appears to extend over almost the whole of at least three modern haciendas, known as "Los Henares," "San Carlos," and "La Ramada," which are now devoted primarily to dairy cattle; documentary sources suggest that pasturing livestock has been the principal economic use of the area throughout the historic periodo Some portions of the site have not been plowed in living memoryo The present vegetation consists of pasture grasses (mainly of introduced species); crops, such as potatoes and maize; gardens; and a few introduced trees, chiefly eucalyptus? The site is virtually level but is perceptibly higher than the surround ing lando Although the difference is no more than a meter or two, it is evidently enough to protect the area from flooding from the pantano or from the river, which passes within 500 m0 of the site; fields nearby are said to be flooded on occasion, but an 18th century house on the site shows no sign of ever having been reached by flood waters? Other wise there is little to say about the present physical appearance of the site; there are no visible ruins, no distinctive vegetation, no markings visible in aerial photographso It looks like nothing but cattle pasture o In view of the size of the site, its location, and the presence there of characteristic Chibcha materials, I decided to conduct excavations there0 In March and April, 1965, approximately HO two by two meter pits were dug on the property of the Hacienda La Ramadao A cultural deposit consisting of dark brown earth containing abundant potsherds and other artifacts was found to vary between HO cm0 and 1*50 m0 in thickness, averaging a little less than a meter0 Under it there was a layer of compact sticky clay, yellow ocher in color, in the surface of which were found numerous post holes and occasional large, irregular holes filled with cultural deposit; some of the latter went below the level of the water table, about lo80 m0 below the present surface. The yellow clay faded into a putty colored clay of much finer texture about 50 cm* below the bottom of the cultural deposit; it is possible that the large holes were dug to get at this finer clay, which would be more suitable for pottery manufacture than the yellow clay0 Cultural materials were absent from both types of clay matrix0 Objects found in the cultural deposit included, besides potsherds, many crudely</page><page sequence="3">3 chipped stone implements, such as scrapers and choppers; fragments of rather large pillow-shaped manos; pieces of milling stones of approxi mately ovoid outline; a few fragments of polished stone axes; portions of three or four disk-shaped incised spindle whorls, also of stone; rare badly eroded scraps of animal bone; and one burial, flexed on its back in a simple, ovoid pit grave dug into the yellow clay and without associated artifacts. These materials are currently under study and will form the basis of an extensive report. The present paper is concerned with the identification of this site with a portion of Chibcha Bogota0 It has always been perfectly clear from the published chronicles that the present city of Bogota was not founded on the site of the Chibcha capitalo Modern Bogota has been called that only since 1819; before that date it was known by the name under which it was founded in 1538, Santa Fe de Bogota, or more often simply Santa Fe or Santafe0 The "Santaf?" portion of the full name was eliminated, in an access of anti-hispanicism, by the Congress of Angostura. 6 However, santafere?o, no* bogotano, is still used with reference to customs considered tra ditionally typical of the capital; e.g0, chocolate santaferefio, hot chocolate served with cheese. The site of colonial Santaf?, according to the chroniclers, was chosen by reconnoitering parties sent out from the Spanish camp at Indian Bogota. ? Piedrahita has the Spaniards camped at Bosa at this time but nonetheless cannot be interpreted as suggesting that the site chosen was anywhere near Indian Bogota. 8 The accounts of the foundation show that the location of Santaf? was that of modern central Bogot?, at the foot of the two mountains Guadalupe and Monserrate and between the rivers San Francisco and San Cristobal. As late as 1668 Piedrahita specified that Santaf? was still located where it had first been founded. 9 it has certainly not been moved since; most of the churches described by Piedrahita still exist. Santaf? was founded at or near a village the name of which has been published as Tensac? (Aguado), Teusaquillo (Simon), and Thybzaquillo (Piedrahita)? 10 These must all be variant spellings of the same name and refer to the same placeo Tensac? is probably a misreading of Teusac?, and Piedrahita1s b would be equivalent to Simon's u, since b, , and u were interchangeable in 17th century Spanish orthography0 The longer (and later) versions of the name obviously end in the Spanish diminutive suffix -ilio, probably used to distinguish this village from a town called Teusac? located somewhere between Usaqu?n and Guasca, presumably in the valley of the present R?o Teusac?. 11 There is now a barrio of Bogota called Teusaquillo, but it is of fairly recent develop ment, since it is not included in barrio lists as late as 1928. 12 It may simply have been named in honor of the Indian village rather than representing its actual site* At all events, Teusaquillo seems to have had no direct connection with Indian Bogot?. It is true that late writers have described it as a pleasure resort of the Zipa, but this story seems to have been started by Juan Rodr?guez Freir? (1636) whose writings are entertaining but notoriously unreliable0 13 None of the earlier chroniclers mentions ito In the published versions of the earlier chronicles Teusaquillo is said to have been subject to Tunja (Aguado) or Funza (Simon). ^ The form "Funza" in the published text of Simon is a misreading of what appears in the manuscript from which the publication was made0 The manuscript has "Tuna," not "Funza0" 15 It</page><page sequence="4">seems likely that the form "Tunja" which appears in the published text of Aguado is also a mistake for "Tuna." Tuna was a Chibcha town closely as sociated with, and presumably close to, Suba; the two are often mentioned together,, 16 A rural district of the municipality of Suba is now named Tuna. As will be seen later, the error in the published text of Sim?n is of some significance, since it provides the only known appearance of "Funza" as a town name in the colonial literature. Chibcha Bogota was therefore not the place where Santaf? was founded but must have been located elsewhere. As Friede has noted, an encomienda of Bogota and an Indian town of the same name persisted for some time after the conquest. 1? Friede believed that Indian Bogot? disappeared soon after 1626, but Piedrahita says that it still existed in 1668, Oviedo refers to it in the mid 18th century, and in 1781, during the Comunero uprising, there was still a cacicazgo of Bogota for Ambrosio Pisco to claim. 18 Friede was unable to establish the precise location of Indian Bogota; a 16th century map shows Bogota on the opposite side of the river from Santaf? but is too sketchy to indicate its exact position." The information given by the chroniclers as to the location of the Zipafs capital is rather vauge: in the middle of the Sabana; close to the R?o Bogot? but on the other side of it from Suba; nearly surrounded by pantanos ; five leagues from Santaf?. 20 After first visiting the site under discussion here it occurred to me that its position coincided approximately to this description, since it lies only a few hundred meters from the river and is on the appropriate bank, while a pantano runs all the way along one side of it. Moreover, aerial photographs suggest that there was once another smaller pantano just south of the site also, and this, with the surviving one, would indeed leave the site nearly surrounded by water? However, there are many similar locations on both sides of the river. The highway on the south side of the site probably lies close to, if not actually on, the route of the Camino Real of Colonial times that formed the normal route of travel from Honda on the Magdalena de Bogot?; it still passes through towns mentioned by 19th century travel lers. 21 This was the first macadamized road in Colombia** 22 Aerial photographs show no traces of any other road, except for one minor deviation where the route has been changed in very recent years o Archive documents indicate that Indian Bogota was close to the Camino Reale 23 The site, it will be remembered, lies in the municipality of Funza. A location of the Zipa's capital in the vicinity of this town has considerable traditional support. Funza has been identified (without documentation) with Indian and colonial Bogota by many historians and geographers. 2H ?n exception is Vergara y Velasco, who regarded Fontibon as a more likely site0 25 p?rez de Barradas accepts this Interpreta tion? 26 ^he reasons given for it are, however, easily refuted,. A supposed lack of archaeological finds in Funza (always a risky argument) is now contradicted by the discovery there of one of the largest sites known in Chibcha territoryo Vergara y Velasco's claim that the chroniclers "afirman perentoriamente" that the Zipa's capital was on the left bank of the river could not be further from the truth, since in fact</page><page sequence="5">5 the chroniclers say that the Spaniards had to cross the river to get there from Suba. The ease with which the crossing was made, at the height of the rainy season and in the face of Indian opposition, refutes the suggestions that the river was unfordable and would have been an obstacle to trade with Guatavita, Chocont? and Tunja if Bogota were on the Funza side, and a defense against the Panche were it on the other. Moreover, Fontib?n was itself an important Chibcha town, and after the conquest it formed a separate encomienda, distinct from that of Bogot?. 27 The fact that during the Colonial Period Funza was called Bogot? has now been conclusively proved by an examination of the parish archives in Funza. Except for the first book of the baptisms, all the colonial records there, which start in 1652, refer to "este pueblo de Bogot?." The exception involves the complicating factor that other towns in the vicinity have had their names changed since Independence; Cuatro-esquinas became Mosquera, while what is now Madrid was formerly called Serrezuela* 2^ The first book of baptisms in Funza is titled "Bautismos de este Pueblo de la Serrezuela" and therefore belongs prop erly to Madrid; possibly it was lent at some time to the doctrinero of Bogota and was never returned, so that it later got bound in with the Bogot? books. That Serrezuela was not an earlier name for Bogot? but a separate contemporary town is shown by entries referring to both towns and naming different doctrineros for them. Apart from this book, all references to "este pueblo" are to Bogot?, not Funza, until February 13, 1825, when a baptismal entry was made by a priest named Benedicto Salgar "en esta Villa de Funsa." 29 Salgar had previously signed entries referring to "esta villa de Bogot?," and he continued to sign thereafter, varying between "esta villa de Funsa" and "esta villa (or "esta parroquia") de Bogot?." Not infrequently one finds some entries refer ring to Bogot? and others to Funza on the same page; it would be difficult to find clearer proof that they were one and the same town0 The last dated mention of Bogot? in these documents is a title page dated August 28, 1832, "??obauptismos de Yndios de este pueblo de Bogot?...," although all entries following this title mention Funzao 30 Evidently, after Santaf? became Bogot? in 1819 it proved inconvenient to have a small town nearby with the same name, so the town was renamed.: The name chosen is one that has long been applied to the Rio Bogota, as for example by Piedrahitao 31 In fact, there are still areas, such as Chocont?, where the river is normally called the Rio Funza0 As noted earlier, the only known occurrence of Funza as a town name in the colo nial literature is an erroneous reading of a manuscript. It is, then, perfectly clear that the "pueblo de indios" called Bogot? did not die out in the early 17th century, as Friede has suggested. Like other such Colonial Period settlements in the area, such as Facatativ?, Zipaquir?, and Guatavita, it has remained in existence to the present day; it is only unusual in that its name has been changed? It is curious that this fact should have been so quickly forgotten that only seventy years later Vergara y Velasco could suggest that Fontib?n, not Funza, was the location of Indian Bogot?. Other changes of town names in Cundinamarca are amply documented, for example Madrid, Mosquera, and Villapinzon. 32 No source examined so far, however, says when or why Bogot? became Funza? Perhaps the fact that</page><page sequence="6">6 the new name of Indian origin rather than Spanish led people to forget that Funza was ever called anything else. There is little reason to believe that the modern town is on the exact site of the Zipa's palace. In Chibcha territory, towns bearing Indian names are usually Colonial Period foundations, new towns founded by the Spanish authorities near but not in the same place as the Indian towns for which they were named. The site chosen and the layout of the new town were in accordance with Spanish ideas of town planning, and the objective was to concentrate the Indians from a number of scattered aboriginal settlements into one center where they could be more easily controlled and indoctrinated in the Christian faith. The success of this program, which continued throughout the Colonial Period, was usually rather limited. 33 Modern Funza, with its square blocks arranged around a central plaza, is typical of such new towns, and in fact documents exist that refer to the establishment of a "reduction" of this type for Bogot? and efforts to persuade the Indians to settle there. 3A* It is therefore reasonable to expect that the site of Indian Bogot? would lie a few kilometers from the present town of Funza. The site under dis cussion here is only 3 knu from Funza and within its present juris diction. These facts, together with the large size of the site, led me to suppose that it probably represented the Indian town from which the colonial foundation took its name. There is some additional evidence from documentary sources which strengthens and somewhat modifies this interpretation0 Bogot?, like other Chibcha towns, was divided into matrilineal social units which did not obligatorily involve either exogamy or endogamy and which I have chosen to call "parts." 3^ pr0m the parish records Bogota appears to have had 13 such units, named as follows: del Cacique, Say, Canro, Chinsa, Tauta, Catama, Neuque, Busia, Sosatama, Gacha Grande, Gacha Chiquito, Tibaque and Chicaque. A document in the National Archives clearly identifies one of these parts with the very hacienda where my excavations were carried out. 36 "La Ramada" or "La Ramada de Antonio Olalla" is mentioned fre quently in the document, which concerns claims for damages by the Indians of Bogot? against the Spanish owners of cattle that had broken into the Indians5 cultivated fields in 1609. At one point the location of La Ramada is described so clearly that if one followed the instructions today one would arrive at that hacienda and nowhere else. 37 Elsewhere in the same document a witness speaks of "el sitio que llaman la rramada que los y[ndi]os dizen aquel sitio catama." 3** La Ramada is thus identified with Catama, one of the thirteen divisions of Indian Bogot?. This document, in combination with other evidence, leads me to think that the parts were territorial as well as social divisions, and that each part had its own more or less nucleated settlement? A Chibcha town would thus consist, not of one single aggregation of houses, but rather of a constellation of separate villages which may have been scat tered over quite a large area0 If La Ramada was the site of Catama, it would thus represent only one out of probably thirteen separate settle ments that together formed Chibcha Bogot?. In view of the size of the site, this conclusion is somewhat surprising. If a site 2 km. long and 1 km. wide is only one of 13 parts of Indian Bogot?, Piedrahita*s statement that it had 20,000 houses or families ceases to sound</page><page sequence="7">7 unreasonable. At all events, it is evident that the Chibcha capital was an entity of considerable size. Somewhere in the vicinity of Funza there may be as many as twelve more sites comparable to the one discussed here. One at least may prove easy to locate, that of the part called Say. Documents sometimes mention Tfel rinc?n de Say*" In the municipal^ ity of Mosquera, maps show a place-called-HSai" located in a very marked loop of the R?o Bogot? that encloses what could very well be described as a "rinc?n." 39 The La Ramada site is important for other reasons, apart from its identification with at least one section of Chibcha Bogot?o Its exist ence establishes the fact that the Chibcha not only used the valley floor but actually lived there, in spite of the excess of water. Many bodies of water still exist but do not prevent intensive agriculture and livestock raising. If there was more water on the Sabana at the time of the conquest it did not prevent the pasturing of thousands of head of cattle, sheep, horses and pigs in the vicinity of Indian Bogot? in the early Colonial Period, as is proved by the above mentioned documento In fact, it seems likely that the vicinity of pantanos was a preferred place to live, and that we can expect to find more sites in such areas o The rural district of Tuna, mentioned above, borders one of these features, and documentary evidence suggests that fishing, perhaps even fish farming, in the pantanos was an important food source. 1+0 The La Ramada site is the first that can be securely identified by documentary evidence with any Chibcha settlement mentioned in historical sources and known to have been occupied by Indians at the time of the conquest? Moreover, this settlement was part of the very capital of the larger and more centralized of the two Chibcha kingdoms. Its excavation and study will enable us to define archaeological materials pertaining to the historic Chibcha with much greater assur ance than heretoforeo We can hope to distinguish historic Chibcha materials from those of different age and thus start to build up the sort of chronological sequence which is at present the greatest need of Chibcha archaeology0 NOTES ? Aguado [1581], 1956-57, vol. 1, p. 271; Piedrahita [1668], 1942, vol. 1, pp. 193, 243. 2 A curious tradition has developed to the effect that the Chibcha capital was properly called Bacata? This form, however, has not been found in the literature before the 19th century. The 16th century chronicles and all early documents examined to date use only the form Bogot? (with such spelling variants as Vogot? and Uogot?K Divergent forms do appear in the 17th century, but not Bacat?* Castellanos says that the original form was Bocat?, and that it meant "end of the fields " (Castellanos [1601], 1955, vol. IV, p. 142). Sim?n says that Bogota was</page><page sequence="8">8 a corruption of Bog?te, and that this word was part of the Zipafs title (Sim?n [1626], 1882-92, vol. II, pp. 114-115; ms., pp0 166-167)? He adds that the capital was called either Bog?te or Muequet? by the Indians, but he implies that Muequet? (which he translates as "field of flat land") was the commoner form which the Indians continued to use to his own day? The earliest use of Bacat? I have discovered to date is in a translation of a work by Humboldt (Humboldt, 1876, ? 578)? It has not yet been possible to check the German original, Ansichten der Natur, 1808? Acosta follows Sim?n and calls the Chibcha capital Muequet? (Acosta, 1848, ? 188, 201)? Uricoechea, in a very confused statement, seems to imply that Muequet? and Bogot? were different places? He etymologizes the former as muyquy ta, "cultivated field or plain of the field, literally 'field-field'" and the latter as fac-a-ta, "end of cultivated land, literally 'outside his field"' (Uricoechea, 1871, pp. LVI-LVII). With Restrepo the form Bacata appears again (Restrepo, 1895, ? 2, 45, 89, 195)? Since Restrepo re peats Uricoechea's strained etymology, one is tempted to suspect that he has somehow fused Castellanos' Bocat? and Uricoechea's Facat?. How ever, in view of the occurrence in Humboldt it is also possible to sus pect the confusing influence of Jose Domingo Duquesne (the inventor of a "Chibcha calendar") somewhere along the line. After Restrepo Bacat? is almost standard (Triana, 1922, pp0 66, 67; P?rez de Barradas, 1950, volp I, ? 405)? Of the early versions, Simon's story sounds the most authoritative and the most likely. If the Chibcha really said anything like Bocat? or Bacat? it is hard to understand why the earliest sources so consistently give Bogot?, a form which is perfectly easy for a Spanish speaker to distinguish from the other two and no easier to pronounce? 3 Haury and Cubillos, 1953, ? 83, 92?

VII, pp. 102-103)0 When the New Laws forbade such practices, the encomenderos petitioned to have Lugofs encomiendas returned to those from whom he had appropriated them instead of reverting, to the Crowno They specified that if the Crown were to take over any of them it should be Fontib?n, since this encomienda had no legal claimant (Friede, 1955-63, volo VIII, pp0 243-244)0 In fact, Fontib?n appears in later documents as a Crown encomienda (Archivo Nacional de Colombia, Caciques e Indios, tomo 55, f0 717v).

Simon's "Muequet?" may simply have been the Indian name of the place where the colonial foundation was made, this settlement being in existence by Sim?n1s time. It would thus be the name, not of the whole capital, but of a particular piece of land, presumably within the territory of Indian Bogot?. Since one of the parts of Bogot? was called Neuque, it is tempting to suggest the possibility that the form was Neuquet?, "fields of Neuque," and that Simon has garbled it into something he could more easily etymologize.
