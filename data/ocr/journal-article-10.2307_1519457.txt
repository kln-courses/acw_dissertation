<plain_text><page sequence="1">142 BOOK LIST O.T. and an N.T. aspect of a given topic within the general theme of the people of God. Attention is here limited to those on O.T. topics. E.-J. Waschke sketches a doctrine of election; M. K6ckert studies the theme of Yahweh, Israel and the land with particular attention to the books of Amos and Hosea; J. Conrad discusses the differing attitudes to kingship and the state, under the topic of wor- ship; H. Seidel traces the theme of praise in heaven and on earth from the O.T. through to the intertestamental and Qumran literature; and H.H. Schmid reflects in more homiletical style on the limits of human responsibility as presented in J's primeval history. Individual essays at the end of the volume include an outline of the theology ofJeremiah by S. Herrmann, a study of the people of God in Malachi by A. Meinhold, and an examination of the same theme in the "historical" psalms (lxxviii, cv, cvi, cxxxv, cxxxvi) by D. Mathias. [H.G.M. WILLIAMSON] C.H.J. VAN DER MERWE, The Old Testament particle gam. A syntactic-semantic Description of gam in Gn-2Kg. Arbeiten zu Text und Sprache im Alten Testament 34. xi + 228 pp. Eos Verlag, St Ottilien, 1990. DM 45. Although this book is a revision of the author's dissertation (1988) at Stellenbosch, much of the research was undertaken at Munich, and it follows closely the methods and form of presen- tation pioneered by W. Richter. Van der Merwe is aware that many other scholars find this to be "user-unfriendly" (p. 23), but he believes that it alone provides the necessary theoretical framework for a linguistically scientific description of Old Hebrew. After briefly pointing out the inadequacies of previous treatment of gam, introducing some theoretical considerations and discussing "emphasis" and "focus" in general, van der Merwe works through every occurrence of gam in Genesis, first descriptively and then in terms of its connections with other words and word groups. Finally, the different functional classes of gam in Genesis to 2 Kings are described. It is reassuring to find that, among his conclusions, he is able to state "Gam almost always has an additive, inclusive or at least a connective con- notation" (p. 198). [H.G.M. WILLIAMSON] J. MILGROM, Leviticus 1-16: A New Translation with Introduction and Commen- tary. Anchor Bible 3. Doubleday, New York, etc., 1991. $42. Milgrom's acknowledged expertise in Israelite ceremonial laws makes him an especially suitable commentator on Leviticus, and the length of this volume (only the first of two on Leviticus) gives him full scope to expound his understanding of this O.T. book. The introduction (pp. 1-67) considers the name, scope and text of the book and describes Milgrom's method, which "belongs, in the main, to the school of redaction criticism. It is characterized by synchronic rather than diachronic analysis" (p. 2). The historical aspect of study is not, however, ignored. Arguments are advanced for a pre-exilic date of the Priestly writer, and it is also maintained that "the school of H is later than P; indeed, H is P's redactor" (p. 13). H, in turn, is dated "at the end of the eighth century" (p. 28), apart from later additions, which are not later than the end of the exile (p. 27). There follow discussions of the vocabulary, style and structure; the Priestly theology; the priest; anthropomorphism and revelation; the composition of Lev. i-xvi; and commen- tators. There is a bibliography of sixty pages. The commentary that follows offers a detailed discussion of the text, including such questions-to mention but a few-as the leaning of the hand on the head of a sacrificial victim (by "process of elimination, ownership is the only theory remaining", p. 152); the purpose of sacrifice (the theory that it is "a gift to the deity to induce his aid" is "the only one that manifests validity in all sacrificial systems", p. 441); why it is forbidden to boil a kid in its mother's milk ("A substance that maintains the life of a creature ... should not be fused or confused with a process associated with death", p. 741); and the meaning of sdraCat ("the identification ... is uncertain" but "these diseases ... share one feature in common: they produce scales. Hence ... saraCat has been</page><page sequence="2">BOOK LIST 143 rendered 'scale disease"', p. 817). The comments include a few by Susan Rattray and D.P. Wright, former pupils of Milgrom. The volume contains a number of photographs and diagrams, and it ends with indexes of subjects, terms in Semitic and other languages, authors, and sources (both biblical and extra-biblical). It is impossible to do justice in a short review to the riches in this commentary, and the information provided on so many subjects. The reader learns, for example, that scientific studies suggest that "The Israelites were unacquainted with fish not because they had no contact with the sea but ... the sea with which they had con- tact was virtually devoid of fish" (p. 661). The importance of this massive com- mentary for the O.T. scholar can scarcely be exaggerated. [J.A.E.] J. MILGROM, The JPS Torah Commentary: Numbers. The Traditional Hebrew Text with the New JPS Translation. lxii + 520 pp. The Jewish Publication Society, Philadelphia and New York, 1990. $47.50. "This commentary aims to be critical, unapologetic, and objective. At the same time it offers reliable support to those who believe that this book and the Torah at large were divinely inspired" (p. xiii). After briefly noting different methods, the introduction considers "Inner Cohe- sion and links with Other Texts in the Hexateuch", "The Sources", "The Structure of the Units", "Special Features", "Theology" and Anthropology" and "The Commentators" (understandably in this series, Jewish commentators receive most attention). There follow a glossary, a list of abbreviations and five maps. Pp. 3-331 cointain the Hebrew text, the newJPS translation and the com- mentary, followed by endnotes. Finally, there are 77 excursuses (pp. 335-52) which contain some of the most important parts of this work for the biblical scholar. Although Milgrom pays special attention to traditional Jewish commen- tators, he also refers, where it is appropriate, to modern scholars and to such evidence as Ugaritic, the Deir CAlla references to Balaam, and the Ketef Hinnom amulet. The claim that this commentary is not apologetic is also illustrated. For example, Milgrom recognizes the historical difficulty raised by the mention of 600,000 men in the wilderness, which "presupposes a population of over two million supporting itself for forty years in the Sinai Peninsula ... it also clashes with other demographic statistics concerning ancient Israel" (pp. 338-9). He rejects attempts to explain away the figures, and maintains that the number "was meant to be understood literally ... the tendency of ancient epics to inflate numbers is well attested" (p. 339). The calculations of Bishop J.W. Colenso have not been in vain. Scholars will find this an informative and useful commentary. J.A.E.] Y. MINOKAMI, Die Revolution desJehu. G6ttinger Theologische Arbeiten 38. 190 pp. Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, G6ttingen, 1989. DM 38. As Minokami observes in his closing paragraph, Jehu's revolution was one of a series of upheavals that punctuated the history of the Northern Kingdom, but his was the only one to produce a narrative. Minokami works back from the present form of the tradition to what he regards as its original shape. The outer circles of investiga- tion are the Deuteronomistic History and Chronicles ("Was hat die Chronik aus Jehu gemacht!" [p. 21], says he in conscious echo ofJ. Wellhausen). Numerous additions to the original narrative are identified, as is a Judean revision of the story which predates its incorporation into the Deuteronomistic History. Ch. 10 sets out in translation, with supporting notes and follow-up discussion, the original narrative as he envisages it. This is without doubt a confident application of literary-critical methods to a section which has already enjoyed enthusiastic treat- ment of this kind. Significant use is made of the LXX, though devotees of Jehu will regret the absence of interaction with J.C. Trebolle-Barrera, Jehiu y Jods (Valencia, 1984). [R.P.
