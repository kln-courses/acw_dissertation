<plain_text><page sequence="1">SMITH: THE PROPHETIC TARGUM AS GUIDE AND DEFENCE ETC. 121 THE PROPHETIC TAR GUM AS GUIDE AND DEFENCE FOR THE HIGHER CRITIC LOUISE P. SMITH WELLESLEY COLLEGE T HERE are two essentially different methods of approach in the study of the content of the Old Testament prophetic books. According to the first, the existing book is regarded as substan- tially the work of the prophet whose name it bears; the task of the modern scholar is then merely the correction of scribal blun- ders and the elimination of a few explanatory glosses and addi- tions. On the other hand we may assume that the book contains a few genuine oracles which have been so worked over, added to, and commented upon, that the original words if attainable would form a relatively small proportion of the whole. The latter has been on the whole the method of German scholars (e. g. Budde, Duhm, Marti); but it is now somewhat out of favor (Sellin, Ludwig Kbhler), especially among English speaking schol- ars, because of the impossibility of attaining by the methods of literary criticism absolute results. However, a dislike of uncer- tainty is not an argument against the validity of a point of view; and the specific difficulties of vocabulary, grammar, and literary and logical consistency which were the bases of the older detailed analyses, are still uneliminated. A favorite phrase of the late Pro- fessor Arnold's, applied to the Old Testament Prophetic Canon in its present form was "an edition for the use of the laity". This edition was apparently made by the Jerusalem priests and scribes of the third century B.C. shortly before the Septuagint trans- lation, possibly with a view to this translation. The purpose of</page><page sequence="2">122 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE the edition was to present the teaching of the prophets in a form which would be understandable and edifying for the common people. So far as possible therefore ambiguities were made clear, contradictions explained or removed, and teachings made appli- cable to the contemporary situation. Now this is exactly what the Aramaic paraphrase of the Prophetic Targum attempts to do, a few centuries later, with the Hebrew text. Thus the problem of reconstructing the words of an eighth century prophet from the text of a prophetic book may well be viewed as analogous to an at- tempt to determine the Massoretic text, supposing that that had been lost, from the Targum of Jonathan. If this view is correct, a comparison of the Targum with the Hebrew original should be worth making, since it reveals the kind of modifications which were actually made in order to serve specific ends, and a classifi- cation of these changes affords an objective standard for compari- son with passages in the prophetic books which, in vocabulary or grammar, suggest the presence of a later hand. As concrete illustration of the applicability of such a com- parison I have used sections of the book of Hosea in which, as the first of the "Book of the Twelve", there is the probability of especial editorial activity. The modifications of the Targum may be tabulated as follows: - I. Some verses are translated almost word for word, e. g. 2 1o (8), 13 (11) and often statements are left unmodified which must have run counter to the translator's prejudices. Targum does not for instance ordinarily alter the passages which include Judah with Samaria in the coming punishment. e. g. 5 5, 12. II. Some differences are apparently due to misunderstanding: 7 4V3. . 1, 3l, .9 is read as if from I~ and the phrase is translated "They shall go captive from their cities". Targum can of course see a reference to captivity with much less excuse than this, e. g. 1 8; 2 1; 3 3. Compare also 711 where the last half of the original reference to the diplomatic relations with Egypt and Assyria is translated "To Assyria they went captive." In 2 5 the figure "make her like a dry land" 7'1 2r'I. 7I._V) be- comes "make the land a desert." In 7 11 is used in the ordinary Hebrew meaning of "in- telligence"; but the Targum, perhaps under the influence of the</page><page sequence="3">SMITH: THE PROPHETIC TARGUM AS GUIDE AND DEFENCE ETC. 123 Greek use of Kap&amp;'a understands it in the less usual sense of "courage". III. Changes and additions are made intentionally for a definite purpose. (1) (a) For clearness in difficult passages. 81 '10W .05'.S "unto your mouth a trumpet" becomes in Targum "Prophet, shout with your mouth as with a trumpet." (b) Very often a literal interpretation is added to a metaphor. To "her lovers" in 2 9 (7) Targum adds X ?_rY "peoples." So also 2 14 (12). In 81 i1' 1 5 '"y Itz "like a vulture above the house of Yahweh" is explained by an insertion so that we read "like a vul- ture, a king will go up and will camp against the house of Yahweh." (2) For emphasis-repetition or amplification. (a) Often quite unnecessary. (1) In 21 (T 1 io) "they shall be increased" is added to the promise that the number of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea. (2) In 2 9 (7) "Henceforth I will not serve idols" follows the resolution to return to Yahweh. (3) "She left her husband" is prefixed in 2 15 (13) to "followed her lovers." (b) Sometimes a concrete detail is added. 6 lo to r'inif is added. "They turned to wander after the calves in Bethel." More often a longer phrase is substituted for a single concrete word. In 1 5 the bow (flt i) of Israel to be broken in Jezreel becomes "the strength of the makers of war in Israel." (c) A simile or metaphor is expanded. To 7 11 where Ephraim is called a "silly dove", Targum adds "whose young were taken." 3 i has a really delightful figure, suggested by the P3 of the original, worth quoting to remind us that even a late editor might have flashes of inspiration. According to Targum, Israel will return to Yahweh "and shall be like a man who had made a mis- take and he said a word to his friend." (3) Expression of emotion or prejudice. 1 4 the emphasis on the calf worship of North Israel (entirely out of place since the verse applies to Ahab and Jezebel).</page><page sequence="4">124 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE 3 4 Israel shall remain many days without sacrifice 1i= and without 71M becomes kU1 I MJ51 0t51 N41r1 ='10 I ,145 "Without acceptable sacrifice in Jerusalem and without pillar in Samaria." 11 9 the Hebrew text "I will not return to the city" which in the context is meaningless, is rendered "I will not exchange Jeru- salem for any other place." (4) Didactic and edifying modifications are frequent. (a) Reference to the past. Exodus. For example in 7 4 Targum adds (probably the word "dough" provided the association) "because they did not remem- ber the miracles and mighty deeds which were done for them in the day when they came up from Egypt. "More obvious is the change in 2 16 (14) where "I will allure her 1 _1Dn and bring her to the desert" becomes "I will do miracles (from ,F 1I) and wonders as I did for her in the desert." Exile. 1 2 the land is defined as (1I7..1 r 1~y. In 18 sFra '=n1 M b bW1n becomes "and their inhabitants who were taken captive to the sons of the nations." (b) Some corrections were made necessary because of the changed historical situation, such as the substitution of Israel (the whole people including Judah and in post-exilic times used syno- nymously with Judah) for Ephraim, the specifically Northern tribe, where the context describes God's protecting care. 11 3 I taught Ephraim to walk; 11 9 I will not destroy Ephraim. Compare also 3 5 where "David, their king," becomes "Messiah, Son of David." (c) Some changes are purely religious in purpose. Avoidance of anthropomorphism. The substitution of "fear of God" or "word of God" for Yahweh or God is too well known to need illustration. (cf. 2 22 (18) 4 12). Ch. 2 21, 22 the substitution of I1j establish for tr1M betrothed. Emphasis on idolatry, 1 4 etc. Honor for the prophets is especially prominent. e. g in 97 517 '1 1117 . ~P4R .

Compare also the next verse where in Targum the people snare the prophet instead of vice versa. The Targum consistently substitutes "prophecy" for Gomer and the unnamed woman of chapter 3 e. g. 1 2 "prophesy a pro- phecy against the inhabitants of an idolatrous state." (d) Some changes are motivated by ethical concepts. The changed judgment on the slaying of Jehu. 1 4 Hebrew Text "I will visit the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu." Targum: 'The blood of the worshippers of idols which Jehu shed in Jezreel, who killed them because they worshipped Baal. ... Therefore I will count the blood clean upon the house of Jehu." As illustration of similar modifications in our present Hebrew text, consider Hosea 7 1-13, which, with its .U15. and the refer- ence to Egypt and Assyria in v. 11, justifies the assumption that there is here a genuine "word" of Hosea. Suspicious as signs of later addition are syntactual difficulties, especially the confusion in tense sequence so characteristic of later Hebrew, post-exilic words and phrases, or clauses which seem to be due to misunderstanding or which undulyinterrupt the sequence of thought. (cf. Targum II.) If these are due to editorial activity the content should show tendencies parallel to those of the Targum. Naturally the religious and ethical presuppositions of the editor would be those of the third century B.C.-for example, horror of idolatry; emphasis on truth-telling (cf. Proverbs, Ben Sirach); hatred of Samaria. A detailed discussion of the especial character- istics of the editor was given at the meeting of the Oriental Society last year by Prof. Moses Bailey of Hartford Theological Seminary. v. Ib.

In 4a JMN seems to be an addition giving a literal (and in the context incorrect) interpretation of the heat of the princes in vv. 5, 7 (II); while the latter half with the "sour dough" goes with the cake metaphor in v. 8; similarly the sleepy baker in v. 6 with V1~. to balance 771. Some of this expansion may have been due to an early marginal note which the editor has incorporated in the text.1 v. 7 a. Perfect followed by the participle with 14M awkward. The verse contains a reference to past history (III 4a) and characteristic religious emphasis (III 4c). v. 8b. The "unturned cake" one would like to keep, but how explain the perfect 7717? Also .g_ in the early period generally means "turn into something", cf. Amos 5 7,s; 6 12; 8 10. The only parallel sto n.- with a participle are II Sam. 1 21 (where the text is doubtful) and Ps. 19 4. If the text of David's lament can give sanction for the syntax, perhaps only the repetition of C~~13 and the troublesome rI71 need be considered editorial (III 2a and for 114M III 4b). v. 9 ab. The 1t L N t411 repeated is obviously suspicious (III ib and 2a). On the other hand in 9b 77?1 properly "sprinkled" of dust, or of the blood of sacrifice, seems impossible in connection with gray hair or old age--and exactly for that reason cannot be dismissed as editorial since one characteristic of editorial additions is that when recognized as such they are quite intelligible. v. to.

The clause parallels the first half of the verse, but carries a more definite and in the post-exilic period conventional condemnation. It is tempting to see it as editorial (III s) and to take as original the following D ~~T Z.I as a circumstantial concessive clause (G-K 141c); but the decision here depends not on one's opinion of the editor's method, but on whether or not redemption is believed to be an integral part of Ho- sea's message. The remaining clauses fit with very little emendation into a coherent whole, with consistent use of perfect and imperfect (imperfect denoting continuous state, in v. 1 future; and perfect completed action), with the classical Hebrew use of waw-conver- sive, and with a vocabulary for which pre-exilic parallels are numerous. v. 1. 85'l 5 1013': belongs with the preceding verse, so LXX. v. 2. 10D ocf.
