Historicizing Modernism Series. Continuum. 2011. £60. ISBN 9 7814 41 11 1302 Surveying the number of recent publications with 'Katherine Mansfield' in their titles, it seems that Mansfield studies is currently under- going the same explosion of critical attention and activity that has already happened to other female modernist writers: Virginia Woolf in the 1970s, Rebecca West in the 1980s, and H.D. in the late 1980s and early 1990s, to name but a few. Mansfield is clearly not an author being discovered for the first time - there is already an established critical canon by scholars in- cluding Vincent O'Sullivan and Margaret Scott, Sydney Janet Kaplan, Angela Smith, and others, as well as a number of biographies to date -</page><page sequence="2">THE EXPLOSION OF MANSFIELD STUDIES 389 but what Mansfield studies can perhaps claim as its own is the intense energy and speed with which the critical discipline is currently expanding, led by a group of committed enthusiasts focused under the auspices of the recently formed Katherine Mansfield Society. As the editors of Katherine Mansfield and literary Modernism point out, the 'resurgence of interest in Mansfield' and 'renewed scholarly activity' (pp. iii -ix) include four confer- ences and colloquia focused solely on Mansfield (London 2008, Menton 2009, Melbourne 2010, and Cambridge 2011, with a further conference planned in Slovakia for 2012); a new dedicated author-based scholarly journal, Katherine Mansfield Studies , published by Edinburgh University Press; and the inauguration of various regular events, including an annual essay prize and birthday lecture. The much-anticipated final volume of Mansfield's letters, edited by O'Sullivan and Scott, arrived in 2008, and more recent critical texts have included Jenny McDonnell's study of the material conditions of Mansfield's stòrytelling in Katherine Mansfield and the Modernist Marketplace: At the Mercy of the Public , Faith Binckes's book-length study of Mansfield in the magazines, Modernism, Magazines , and the British Avant-Garde: Reading * Rhythm ' 1910-1914 , and Sydney Janet Kaplan's study of influence in Circulating Genius: John Middleton Murry, Katherine Mansfield and D. H. Lawrence (all 20 10).1 The year 2010 also saw the UK publication of Kathleen Jones's new biography, Katherine Mansfield : The Story-Tiller. The present volume is one of two collections of essays published in 2011, the other being Celebrating Katherine Mansfield: A Centenary Volume of Essays , also edited by Gerri Kimber and Janet Wilson. Within the landscape of ever- decreasing and impact-assessed funding for the humanities, this dramatic increase in Mansfield's 'stage time' in the higher education performance arena through high-level research activity and regular colloquia is an ad- mirable drawing together of collective scholarly energy. This is precisely what is needed for the more definitive inclusion of Mansfield within the modernist canon. Elizabeth Bowen famously re- ferred to her as 'our missing contemporary' in her 1957 introduction to Mansfield's stories, but her inscription still remains contested. (The 2010 Cambridge Companion to Modernist Women Writers, for example, makes scant reference to Mansfield.) Establishing Mansfield within modernism is evi- dendy part of the editors' purpose, as they suggest that 'the new 1 There have also been a number of recent chapters or parts of studies dedicated to Mansfield: see, for example, sections on Mansfield in Anna Jackson, Diary Pbeúcs: Form and Style in Writers' Diaries , 1915-1962 (2010), and Claire Drewery, Modernist Short Fiction by Women: The Liminal in Katherine Mansfield, Dorothy Richardson, Map Sinclair and Virginia Woolf (20 1 1).</page><page sequence="3">390 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY interpretations of Mansfield's work offered in this volume will expand understanding of her place in modernism for scholars, students and the general reader alike' (p. iii). The series editors' preface similarly aims to emphasise 'the centrality of supposedly "minor" or occluded figures, not least in helping to establish broader intellectual genealogies of Modernist writing'. These essays are a collective means of exploring the rich and varied modes Mansfield used to develop her modernist technique. The sixteen papers collected in this volume are from the first confer- ence focused solely on Mansfield, held at Birkbeck College, London, in 2008. With all conference proceedings there is a danger of contributions being too disparate, reading as embryonic conference papers rather than developed arguments. Thankfully, this is not the case here. This series of engaging and original essays provides new and interesting ways of reading Mansfield, including a number of articles focusing on previously neglected (or undiscovered) sources, including Mansfield's periodical publications, journals, and literary and visual influences. This accords with the volume's publication in the Historicizing Modernism series, which, the series editors argue, 'stresses empirical accuracy and the value of primary sources (such as letters, diaries, notes, drafts, marginalia or other archival deposits)'. The essays are grouped into four sections each of four essays, with an introduction by J. Lawrence Mitchell. The first section, 'Mansfield and Modernism I: Philosophy and Fiction', opens with a thorough and schol- arly essay by Gerri Kimber which, through a chronological discussion of the issues of Rhythm , traces Mansfield's influence on the magazine and examines the significance of its many international contributors in terms of its 'emphasis on radical experimentation in art' (p. 13). Kimber also convincingly suggests a Stanislaw Wyspianski-designed stained-glass window in a Cracow church as the visual influence for a little-known Mansfield poem, 'To God the Father' (p. 24). In an original combination of theory and close reading, Eiko Nakano's discussion of the influence of Henri Bergson's philosophy in Mansfield's early work, particularly 'The Woman at the Store' and 'How Pearl Button Was Kidnapped', argues that 'the inseparable relation between spatial and temporal aspects (or between intellect and intuition) is central to her early work as well as to her later stories' (p. 40). The next chapter discusses Mansfield's later stories: Jenny McDonnell's excellent and highly interesting chapter on Mansfield's periodical publications negates the perceived tension between the literary and the commercial in Mansfield's work, arguing that 'Mansfield's consolidation of a modernist aesthetic in her fiction actually coincided with her desire to engage with a commercial publishing realm' (p. 45). She provides a close reading of 'Mr. and Mrs. Dove', published in</page><page sequence="4">THE EXPLOSION OF MANSFIELD STUDIES 391 the Sphere in 1921, as an examination of Mansfield's development of a 'commercially viable modernist aesthetic' (p. 50). The final chapter of the first section is Mirosława Kubasiewicz's examination of the concept of au- thentic existence in a range of Mansfield's characters informed by an ex- istentialist framework from Heidegger and Sartre. Arguing that the majority of the characters do not act to change their inauthentic lives at the point of narrative crisis, it is not the strongest essay in the volume but provides some interesting readings. The second section is entitled 'Mansfield and Modernism II: Self, Voice and Other', and begins with an essay by Joanna Kokot entitled 'The Elusiveness of Reality: The Limits of Cognition in Katherine Mansfield's Short Stories'. Despite Kokot's rather tired reference to Woolf 's 'Modern Fiction' in her introduction, her chapter provides new, sophisticated analysis of Mansfield's use of perspective, which is bold in its provocations: 'Indeed, there is no development of the characters in Mansfield's worlds' (p. 75). The next essay opens with the same Woolf essay, albeit a different section. Nancy Gray's chapter adds something new to the debate in her discussion of the experience of reading and teaching Mansfield, with particular focus on Mansfield's depiction of selfhood in what she terms her 'unstable narrative spaces' (p. 81). Theoretically informed, if somewhat casually conflating Derridean philosophy with that of Judith Butler, the chapter suggests that Mansfield's skill lies in her pro- duction of 'remarkably porous textual spaces of open-ended possibility' (p. 81). Her feminist argument concerning the multiplicity of selves is less compelling than her very interesting readings of Mansfield's 'The Garden Party', 'Bliss', and 'This Flower', as she suggests that 'we have a far richer sense of unscripted possibilities if we suspend our need to know in favour of simply entering Mansfield's narrative spaces, remaining open to the dynamic tension they put in place between expectation and experience' (p. 83). Anne Besnault-Levita's phenomenological discussion of voice and affect in Mansfield's stories is informed by the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Jean-Luc Nancy, and discusses how 'the epiphanic moment involves the perception of a voice - human, physical, sometimes beyond words - always concretizing an effect of individuation while drawing the reader into a process of revelation' (p. 90). Through complex analysis of 'this dramaturgy of voice', she discusses the concepts of indi- viduation and division, concluding by discussing the participatory role of the listener (p. 92). Next, Delphine Soulhat examines Mansfield's 'talent in rendering chil- dren's inner lives', including the depiction of sensory and aural experi- ences to express the hypersensitivity of children (p. 101). She notes Mansfield's 'most prominent devices' as 'the topoi of the labyrinth and of</page><page sequence="5">392 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY liminality' (p. 104), and examines the traditional move from innocence to experience in terms of her representation of maturation and corruption. We are perhaps confusingly told that Mansfield 'establishes an environ- ment which enhances the imaginative understanding of a world populated by the distinctive features of fairy tales', but simultaneously that 'Mansfield's New Zealand stories do not depend upon archetypal fairy tale structures' (pp. 102, 104). Similarly, the structuring metaphor of 'won- derland' in the essay's title - 'Kezia in Wonderland' - is a slighdy unjusti- fied analogy. The intertextual connections Soulhat makes seem relatively minor: for example, that codes can be arbitrary in both Carroll's and Mansfield's wonderlands, or that both authors utilise anthropomorphism and zoomorphism (pp. 104, 106). The chapter does, however, very useful- ly focus on one of Mansfield's particular skills as a writer - the depiction of children's perspectives - that is not the object of discussion elsewhere in the volume. The third section, entitled 'Mansfield: Class and Gender', is largely new historicist in focus. The thrust of Bruce Harding's opening essay is to emphasise the radicalism of 'The Aloe', the precursor to 'Prelude', sug- gesting that '"Prelude" represents a diminishment of the raw energy and challenging vision of "The Aloe'" (p. 116). In the revised and redded version, 'much insightful misogynisdc critique against patriarchy was eliminated in favour of a highly perfumed, "soft" feminism which did litde to unsetde prevailing androcentric assumptions' (p. 116). It is notable that what Harding terms 'Mansfield's gynocritique' does not ne- cessarily point towards a separatist politics, instead positing the possibility for 'the construction of a mature, androgynous (sexually protean) self' (pp. 122, 125). Harding makes the bold claim that "'The Aloe-Prelude" is best read as a composite text', which 'is one of the truly great prophetic documents of human liberation and self-transformation in the canon of modernist literature' (pp. 124, 126). Ana Belén López Perez's essay exam- ines class and gender in the city space, focusing on the female protagonists in London, in 'The Tiredness of Rosabel' and 'A Cup of Tea'. Although the author is well versed in the field, the overall argument - that 'contrary to male writers' depiction of this place as one that is dangerous and threa- tening, women were much more positive than has traditionally been con- sidered, seeing many possibilities for making it the space of their imagination and their fiction' - is not particularly original in the light of ' many feminist texts on women and the city in recent years (p. 136). Similarly, despite agreeing with the sentiment, the opening sentence is queasily vague in its assumptions: 'In a traditionally patriarchal space such as ours', it begins (p. 128). However, the close readings of the two stories are thorough, with interesting points made about geographical</page><page sequence="6">THE EXPLOSION OF MANSFIELD STUDIES 393 locators and including readings of the visual adverts mentioned in the texts. (A very minor point is that one critic's name is misspelt twice in the references (pp. 137-8), which stands out in a volume otherwise seemingly devoid of textual errors.) The next essay, by Gerardo Rodríguez Salas and Isabel María Andrés Cuevas, concerns Mansfield and Woolf 's shared 'use of the grotesque, par- ticularly in connection with ideas of femininity and maternity' (p. 140). This essay adds something new to existing criticism of the two writers in its suggestion of their separate creation of a 'carnivalesque microcosm' (p. 140). Using a critical framework based on Bakhtin and Kristeva and examining depictions of maternity and the materiality of the pregnant female body, the authors argue that 'through strikingly similar images and allusions, the two writers dramatically subvert the conventionally sacred vision of maternity', moving towards 'articulating an extreme of subversive distortion and the grotesque' as a reaction against the 'patriarchal tyranny' of their time (p. 146). Some of the readings are questionable - can we really call the animal skull on the wall at the beginning of To the Lighthouse a 'surrogate pig-child' (p. 141)? - but the overall argument is valuable. Susan Reid's closing essay moves the focus onto the 'intertextual sparring' between Mansfield and D. H. Lawrence (p. 149). Reid suggests, contrary to the arguments of other critics, that 'there are remarkable similarities in their perception and presentation of gender issues' (p. 150). The larger crit- ical discussion of gender and sexual difference, as represented by de Beauvoir and Irigaray, is brought to bear in comparisons of complemen- tary pairs of stories, such as Lawrence's 'Daughters of the Vicar' and Mansfield's 'The Daughters of the Late Colonel'. Reid concludes that 'both writers demonstrate the need to recognize the separate world of the other as the basis of relationship', and therefore 'anticipate Irigaray's ethics of sexual difference' (p. 159). The final point, that perhaps it was Murry who caused the difficulties between Mansfield and Lawrence, is tantalising- ly not developed. The final section of the volume focuses on 'Mansfield: Biography/ Autobiography'. The opening chapter, on 'The Mansfield Legacy' by Kathleen Jones, presents a sympathetic biographical reading of Murray, arguing that 'The Murrys' relationship has been looked at, for far too long, only from Mansfield's point of view' (p. 165). Drawing on his papers at the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington, New Zealand, the justifi- cations for this reassessment are sometimes contradictory: Jones tells us a re-evaluation is 'of critical importance, because Murry was an emotional and intuitive critic', but on the same page that he 'could best be described as emotionally illiterate' (p. 166). Assessing Murry's actions after Mansfield's death and her ambiguous posthumous directions for her work</page><page sequence="7">394 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY to 'leave all fair', Jones compares his actions to those of other literary executors and includes a detailed summary of the creation of volumes such as The Scrapbook of Katherine Mansfield and the first biography with Ruth Mantz. The descriptions of Murry's subsequent three marriages make for fascinating reading, but are perhaps extraneous to this volume on Mansfield and modernism. Valérie Baisnée's reassessment of Mansfield's Journal in the next chapter is also dedicated to re-evaluating the problem of the cult of Mansfield after her death. Baisnée sets out to 'examine the particularities of Mansfield's diary practice, and analyze her response and resistance to new discourses about the self that came about with the renewed interest in self-writing at the turn of the century' (p. 179). This scholarly and thoughtful analysis positions its 'reassessment of Mansfield's Journal within the tradition of diary-writing' (p. 178), debat- ing the characteristics of the developing genre using the work of Derrida and Philippe Lejeune. Although there are some disputable points, such as Mansfield's handwriting suggesting 'the presence of strongly repressed desires' (p. 180), Baisnée convincingly argues that 'Mansfield's diary is fundamentally an "open" work: acting as a draft for her short stories, poems, reviews and letters' (p. 186). Next, Janka Kaščáková examines the leitmotif of coldness, linking it to the 'soul coldness' Mansfield complained of during her unhappy stay in Bavaria in 1909, and suggesting that 'the themes that physical coldness represents - loneliness, abandonment, hostility or alienation - are central to Mansfield's writing' (p. 188). Although the majority of references to the cold denote something negative, Kaščáková provides some contradictory examples, noting 'how skilfully and variously she deploys the cold for dif- ferent purposes' (p. 199). Predominantly a series of thorough close read- ings of the stories, the essay helpfully illuminates some details that might otherwise pass readers by, such as Kascáková's explication of the connota- tions of Harry's description of Pearl as 'liver frozen' in 'Bliss' (pp. 197-8). The final essay in the volume, 'Katherine Mansfield's Menagerie' by Melinda Harvey, focuses on Mansfield's representations of animals - what Harvey terms Mansfield's 'zoopoetics' - arguing that her writings contribute to 'the critique of anthropocentrism and the pursuit of an animal-centred discourse' (pp. 202-3). Harvey suggests that 'Mansfield's concern for the animal might be seen as an extension of her oft-noted interest in alterity', where her own assumption of 'animal monikers' func- tioned as 'a corollary of her identification with the underdog' (pp. 203- 5). The key purpose of 'the prevalence of animal images and lives', however, is Mansfield's creative 'investigation of "life"' which, Harvey argues, 'is clearly anti-anthropocentric, and not only includes fauna but nature as a whole - and, even more mystically, objects' (pp. 205-6).</page><page sequence="8">THE EXPLOSION OF MANSFIELD STUDIES 395 Although this is an original argument, it can feel as though Mansfield is being co-opted for ecocritical purposes, as animal references apparently 'purport nothing more - or, rather, nothing less - than that the world is a biosphere, in which humans and animals live full and parallel lives' (p. 206). Harvey's suggestion of Mansfield's ecologically conservative stance means that her stories 'refuse to partition the animal off from the human world' and even act 'as a safehouse for endangered species human and animal' (p. 209). This volume presents us with a number of excellent and scholarly new readings of Mansfield's work, succeeding in its aims to investigate a number of previously neglected or unavailable sources. The essays to- gether examine new sites of Mansfield's writing, including Rhythm and a number of other periodicals and little magazines (perhaps part of the current vogue for little magazines), and her personal writings, including her letters and diaries. They also explore the development and revision of texts, such as 'The Aloe' into 'Prelude'. There are a number of new read- ings of stories already extensively examined, most prominently (and unsur- prisingly) 'Prelude', 'The Daughters of the Late Colonel', 'Bliss', and 'The Garden Party', as well a s several referring to less frequently discussed stories, including 'This Flower'. This varied approach also applies to the critical methodologies utilised in the volume - there is a healthy mix of new historicist, materialist, psychoanalytical, and philosophical approaches, with, perhaps surprisingly, only a smattering of explicitly fem- inist readings - and to the range of subjects covered, making the volume of interest to both the generalist and the specialist. Although the essays will be accessible to undergraduate readers, the more nuanced and advanced of the essays require some prior knowledge of Mansfield's life and work. The venturing into more theoretical readings of Mansfield, here with varying degrees of success, perhaps points towards the current direction the field is taking. One minor criticism would be of the designa- tion of sections and the sometimes seemingly arbitrary nature of this selec- tion. Although it doesn't really affect our reading experience, some of these selections seem a bit misplaced, such as Kaščakova's essay "'Blue with Cold": Coldness in the Works of Katherine Mansfield', placed in the final section, 'Mansfield: Biography /Autobiography'. (The section desig- nations of this volume are also strikingly similar to those in Celebrating Katherine Mansfield: the volumes seem to provide mirror-images of each other.) Similarly, some of the essays, despite providing very interesting new readings, fail to engage with the aim implied by the title of the collection: to address the notion of Mansfield and modernism or to interrogate this most contested of terms. It would have been helpful in this respect to have had an editorial conclusion drawing together the threads of the disparate</page><page sequence="9">396 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY essays, but this was most likely a problem of space, given the sixteen essays already included. This collection succeeds particularly in reminding us of the richness of Mansfield's work. The range and depth of scholarship demonstrates that her writings can provoke, and sustain, this type of critical attention. These short essays provide separate but complementary readings which, in their individual emphases, demonstrate the complexity of Mansfield's writing, for example her noted skill in depicting the child's perception of the world, or previously undeveloped areas such as her representation of voice, sensory experience, and animals, and the varied influences of her context. The essays combine to remind us why Mansfield is a key figure within modernism, noted for her innovations in form, but one who should also be read for her experiments in narrative, characterisation, and tone. They also remind us of the pleasure of reading Mansfield, of the skill of her economy with language and the subtlety of her allusions. This collec- tion will prompt its reader to return to her well-known stories, such as 'Prelude' and 'Bliss', with a fresh eye, and to read her less well-known writ- ings - her journals and letters, and her stories in their original periodical publications - with more attention. The volume, then, is a series of cohe- sive and scholarly essays, bringing a refreshing new international range of voices to the sphere of Mansfield criticism and including a comprehensive index. Avery welcome addition to this rapidly developing field. doi: 10. 1093/camqdy/bfr03 1</page></plain_text>
