<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHASES OF MODERN PHILOSOPHY. [The following passages from a letter written by Mr. Clay of Detroit will recall some of the points discussed in the first two numbers of the Journal.?Editor.] ***** ^s regards the work in a pecuniary point of view to yourself, I am somewhat afraid; yet as a medium for for eign thought to the thinking minds of this country, its failure would be a serious loss, for it is just such a work as has been needed for many years. That we have native talent among us, is sufficiently proven by the mas terly Review of Spencer as given in the first number of this Journal. The three-fold phase of modern culture is well drawn, as taking its points of depart ure from the enthymeme of Descartes; im perfectly understood by Hobbes, Locke, Condillac, and others of the same school, producing merely a psychological fact which needs must end in Sensism. From u Cogito, ergo sww," their reasoning is that nothing can be in the conclusion which is not affirmed in the premise. Hence they reason that we cannot conclude from the cogito to the esse of God or the universe, but merely to the esse of ourselves. Descartes himself did not fully understand this cogito; for his system as drawn from it is sophistical, since it rests entirely on thought regarded as a purely psychological fact. Now if the esse of the conclusion is not af firmed in the premise cogito?or, what is the same, that we may think without a some thing to think of, without an object, without a truth objectively considered?as a logical inference, then truth is only a subjective imaginary creature, or only an objective un cogitable spectre. Yet, if rigbtly defined, this principle ? cogito ? would lead neither to sensism nor to sentimentalism, neither to idealism nor to pantheism, but would lead to an absurd pretension to demonstrate God, his Uni verse and Logos. Cogito, or reasoning, consists in deducing conclusions from given premises. It can neither operate without premises nor fur nish its own premises, and therefore it does and must always proceed from premises fur nished or given to the mind prior to all rea soning or logical process. Cogito, ergo sum! Why not? Dormio, ergo sum, is the same. Cogito-can I think without an object? No. Can this object be a non-entity, or what is called a self-delu sion? No;* every thought is produced by and occupied about a reality, unless we ven ture to assert that the nothing is imagina ble. Then what is the object of my cogito, without which it cannot be conceived? Do 1 think myself? No; it is consciously ob jective; it is a law to my mind. But what is its object? the universe as phenomena? No; the phenomenon is incomprehensible in itself, unless subsumed by abstraction under a noumenon, i. e. a subjective-objective principle. And this principle, which is itself subjectively given as an object and which connects all phenomena into a unity, is God, and God is truth?my truth. fVom this principle we have Cogito Deum! ?not only my own existence, but God and the Universe are deducible. Cogito Deum, ergo Dens, ego and mundus est.</page><page sequence="2">248 Correspondence?Phases of Modern Philosophy. The philosopher may start either from the subject or the object. If he starts from the subject, he may either take realities existing outside-of our mind, or the representations in our mind. Reason determines the reali ties, and consciousness or intimate sense de termines the images. The object of Reason is the intelligible, while the proper object of consciousness is the sensible contained in the internal modification of the mind. The one is Ontological, the other Psychological. Many of our errors have their root in a psychological confusion of the sensuous im agination with the non-sensuous reason, hence the necessity of keeping the two things apart. Two imaginative conceptions may be compared, or two abstract proposi tions ^ but to oppose an imaginative concep tion to an abstract proposition, is to create confusion that will be prolific of absurdities both in philosophy and theology. Ontology is the basis of primitive specula tive thought. We find it the foundation of the Oriental philosophy, from which it passed into the schools of Pythagoras, the Eleatics, and of Plato among the Greeks. Ontologism was. taught in the schools at Alexandria by the Christian Fathers, and by the Realists of the middle ages. It was opposed by the ^Nominalists and the Con ceptualists, and especially by Descartes (the real father of Psychologism), by placing the internal sensible as an object of reason to the exclusion of the objective intelligible. The Psychologists assume that it is Ihe subject that at once affirms the object and itself. It affirms itself, and then affirms what it sees as not itself. But only Being can af firm itself: only God can say.in and of him self I AM. The Ontologist starts from thought, in deed, but from thought in the sense "that it is objective as well as subjective, in which it reveals and affirms the subject. \ret if we assert an exclusive Ontology, as taught by Plato and the Gentile schools, we evidently fall into Pantheism, for we assert Being to the exclusion of Existence; while, on the other hand, by adopting a purely Psycholo gical method we fall into Materialism, for no one who adopts this method, and strictly follows it, can do otherwise than make all begin and end with the soul. No doubt the point of departure for phi losophy is thought; but thought is never a purely subjective fact, and it is only by treating simultaneously the logical, psycho logical and the ontological parts that we can arrive at the true science of things. In every thought there is object as well as subject, and it is the object that affirms the subject, not the subject that affirms the object. We are greatly indebted to the Scholastics for many of our definitions, yet I cannot but think that between Nominalism and Realism there is an impassable gulf; for the nomin alists contend that abstract ideas are pure words, or nothing; the realists, that they are realities: between the two contradic tions there is no medium; one must be true, the other false. Which is true? If nomin alists are right, materialism is unavoidable, because matter, with them, is the only real ity. Why take so much pains to make phi losc phical abstractions if we have nothing but mere names by them? Moreover if I can make unreal abstrac tions, it would seem as if I could think the nothing. I am always in favor of reality. I hate the nothing, for it is the battle-field of error. I think that the Essence of the Phe nomenon is living ideas?ideas not created by my brains, but thought by God, and, as divine ideas, of course, necessary and eternal, and really living objects of my intuition ante rior to all actual existences or phenomena, and hence I utterly -reject the possibility of God in Creation. Alt reality is in God. In Him there is no possibility. All in Him is real, actual; and hence the Schoolmen say, He is Actus purus. The world has been created from eternit3r, for prior to its creation there was no time, and this prior is only in the logical (not the chronological) order; neither is there space between the power to create and the actual creation, for the creative act is eternal and exerts its force in eternity, and time at taches only to the effect. I admit a psycho logical or logical possibility (if the Logos of our own minds, or of the world, is hereby understood), but never an ontological or theological possibility. I may think anew formation of a formless or formed reality, but never a new reality. I do not admit, that possibility, as conceived by the human mind, though an abstraction, is in itself nothing, else all ideas of the mind would'be nothing. And what is abstraction but the process of setting the idea free from the form? .With respect to God himself, it is nonsense to talk of possibility, or of an abil ity anterior to creation, for with Him there is no anterior. It is anthropomorphism. It conceives God as subject to time, as if He was once thinking what He was to do at another time, or as thinking what is not be cause not yet, hence as having thoughts which are void and vain; as possessing a dead power, which is inactive, and hence, during this inactivity, really powerless. For us there is, of course, a wide distance from the first day of creation up to this moment, from the resolution or idea to the power and effect. But it is not so with God. The past and the future, are one present and eternal now before-Him. His thoughts are the cre tion; what He thinks is essentially, by this very thinking of Him. To create, therefore, as far as God is concerned, is not to reduce potentiality to actuality, except it be under stood in that sense which St. Paul seems to have had present to his mind when he wrote (Heb.'xi. 3): u By faith we learn that the worlds were framed by the wrord of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear." This evidently implies, that the visibility is only the accidental form of an invisible essence"; that things may cease to be. in time and space without losing their ease, because the word of God, His eternal Idea, is their con stitutive element.</page></plain_text>
