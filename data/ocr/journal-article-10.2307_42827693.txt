<plain_text><page sequence="1">"THE LINES AND LIGHTS OF THE HUMAN COUNTENANCE": PHYSIOGNOMY IN GEORGE ELIOT'S FICTION by GRAEME TYTLER Oxford George Eliot is one of several nineteenth-century literary figures who in recent years have been noted for their uses of physiognomy in fiction.1 She has also been given critical attention for her references to phrenology, though the term "phrenology" (the science of interpreting the human skull) appears to have been used now and again in the sense of "physiognomy" (the science of interpreting the human facial and bodily features), a misno- mer owing probably to the fact that both sciences had by the mid-nineteenth century become so closely associated as to be often thought to mean the same thing.2 Eliot's treatment of personal description has also been dis- cussed without regard to physiognomy, the influence of Charlotte Brontë, Hawthorne and Ruskin in particular being taken into account, and stress being laid on the thematic function of her references to well-known painters and paintings.3 But though Eliot's fiction has been rightly compared in some measure with Lavater's physiognomic ideas, and even with Charles Bell's, such comparisons are useful only so long as her literary portraiture is also considered from a diachronic perspective, that is to say, as an expres- sion of Lavater's influence on the development of physical character de- scription in European fiction from the late eighteenth until the early twenti- eth century.4 This development has now been shown by a number of schol- ars to have begun almost immediately after the publication of his Physiog - nomische Fragmente (1775-1778), and to have been fostered in subsequent decades by the continual appearance of sundry editions and translations of this work and by numerous writings on physiognomy and phrenology.5 Whatever uses might have been found for Lavater's Essays on Physiog- nomy , which first appeared in Britain in 1789, there is no question that, with his geometrical analyses of skulls and foreheads, his categorical equating of virtue and vice respectively with beauty and ugliness, his detailed com- ments on the facial and bodily features, his concern with first impressions, attraction and repulsion, moral and external influences on the appearance, the four temperaments, family, national and animal physiognomies, paint- ing and sculpture, the art of physiognomy and the nature of the physiog- nomist, Lavater had produced a kind of handbook that seemed tailor-made for the novelist as it was for the painter and the sculptor.6 It is true that physical character description had already been prominent enough, and even perceptibly physiognomic, in the novels of Richardson, Fielding, 29</page><page sequence="2">Smollett, Marivaux and Diderot, as it had been in the seventeenth-century French romance and in the fiction of several (mainly women) practitioners of the genre.7 By the early nineteenth century, however, English novelists were not only using a broader range of physiognomic ideas than their eight- eenth-century predecessors had done, but were increasingly presenting their descriptions from the viewpoint of fictional characters other than first-person narrators. The earliest such changes may be seen especially in the novels of Ann Radcliffe, 'Monk' Lewis, Jane Austen and Sir Walter Scott, not to mention a host of long-forgotten minor works in which Lavater is actually mentioned by name, and his physiognomic theories respectfully quoted.8 Although other reasons might be adduced for the continuous ex- pansion of physical character description thereafter, sometimes to the point of sheer excess, as, for example, in the fiction of Bulwer Lytton and his fol- lowers, it is, nevertheless, noteworthy how much physiognomy pervades the fiction of the period, especially from the 1820s onwards. Indeed, by the time George Eliot was writing her earliest fiction in the 1850s, the main European literatures had become so conspicuously physiognomic in both outlook and style as to be nowadays declared expressive of what may be usefully designated as the Lavaterian physiognomic era.9 Notwithstanding the widespread and persistent enthusiasm for a sci- ence which, in the last decades of the nineteenth century, was still almost exclusively associated in the literary world with the name Lavater, it was not enough to overcome a certain time-honored skepticism toward physiog- nomy, aggravated as it was in some way by the optimistic new physiog- nomic climate.10 Such skepticism is, to be sure, a kind of tradition in imagi- native literature, and one as noticeable in the plays of Shakespeare as it is in the novels of Henry Fielding and Jane Austen.11 That George Eliot should have maintained this tradition to some extent in her own fiction need not surprise us if we take into account a letter of hers to a friend (February, 1848) in which she tells of having tried in vain to "refresh [herself] by turn- ing over Lavater s queer sketches of physiognomies and still queerer judgements on them," or another to Dante Gabriel Rossetti twenty-two years later, where she speaks frankly of the obstacles of prejudice, subjectiv- ity and inexperience that get in the way of her efforts to interpret "types of head and face," "forms of eyebrow," "facial expression," and so on.12 Yet hard-headed as she seems to have been about physiognomy in her personal life, Eliot qua novelist could scarcely escape the age in which she lived; and this we can see easily enough through her treatment of physiognomy in her fiction, which in its very abundance and diversity bears much the same hallmarks to be found in the works of her European contemporaries and immediate predecessors. The question may, then, arise: What significance do Eliot's seemingly wary remarks on physiognomy have in relation to her 30</page><page sequence="3">particular uses of it in her fiction? This essay shall be concerned in part to answer that question, but in the main to show some of the ways in which her treatment of physiognomy may be considered a touchstone for her art as a novelist.13 I. A quest for physiognomy in fiction might well begin with a considera- tion of physical character description, a long-established literary device that Eliot uses so often, even in the presentation of very minor figures, as to suggest a pronounced interest on her part in the human appearance for its own sake; and whatever the length of her numerous portraits, whether of individuals or groups of people, they usually serve some physiognomic function. As in much nineteenth-century fiction, Eliot's character portraits include overtly physiognomic references - "bright good-natured face" (FH:219), "hard-lined face" (MF:66), "the good-natured lines about his mouth" (SCL:79f), "sincere hazel eyes" (R:170), "delicate but rather petulant profile, with the defiant curves of lip and chin" (M:398), and so on. Such references may be found in conjunction with descriptions of other features - hair, complexions, foreheads, eyebrows, noses, nostrils, teeth, laughter, smiles, figures, gait, handwriting, etc., some of which the author uses re- petitively as "labels," as if to enhance their physiognomic function.14 It is, however, in her references to the voice and the hands that Eliot is perhaps at her most physiognomic. The importance of the voice in love relationships is underlined, for example, when Tessa and Romola separately hint at the charm of Tito Melema's voice for them, as it is when Will Ladislaw asks the painter Naumann how he would depict Dorothea's voice, asserting as he does that it is "much diviner than anything [Naumann has] seen of her" (M:222). That observation has an aesthetic rather than a moral interest, not unlike the following description of Lydgate: "One of Ly d gate's gifts was a voice habitually deep and sonorous, yet capable of becoming very low and gentle at the right moment" (M:152). But when speaking of Grandcourťs "two remarkably different voices" (DD: 162), or analyzing his peculiar drawl, Eliot may be said to have followed Lavater's advice to study some- one's intonation as a means of determining their character.15 Just as the voice may suggest moral imperfection, so, too, does many a reference to a white, fat, dimpled or clumsy hand; though, among several descriptions of hands, some signify the sensitivity and intelligence of their owners - Romola, Lydgate, Dorothea Brooke and Adam Bede, which last possesses a "long supple hand, with [...] broad finger-tips" that "looked ready for works of skill" (AB:50). Daniel Deronda 's hands, too, are physi- ognomically interesting enough for the narrator to draw our attention to them: "Look at his hands: they are not small and dimpled, with tapering fingers that seem to have only a deprecating touch: they are long, flexible, 31</page><page sequence="4">firmly-grasping hands, such as Titian has painted in a picture where he wanted to show the combination of refinement with force" (DD:226).16 The enthusiasm of this description is reminiscent of that with which Lavater analyzes some of the engravings of hands in the Essays on Physiognomy.17 Mention might also be made here of what Lavater designates as "pathog- nomy" (the study of facial expressions, complexions, gestures, postures, etc.), since it concerns a descriptive device which, noticeable enough in eighteenth-century fiction, is often used by Eliot, occasionally in remarkable physiological detail, to convey someone's state of mind or moral nature.18 Similarly, Lavater 's acknowledgment that the human appearance may im- prove or deteriorate by dint of moral, psychological or extraneous influ- ences is reflected in Eliot's characterization, sometimes with dramatic inten- sity, as in the case of her tragic figures, sometimes with gentle lyricism, as in accounts of the effects of the passage of time on the faces of sympathetic men and women portrayed in Scenes of Clerical Life.19 Although it would be a good deal easier to argue that the methods of physical character description discussed hitherto are very traditional aspects of the novel, if not part and parcel of the intrinsic development of the genre after 1800, than it would be to attribute their existence offhand to the Lavaterian climate, it is none the less reasonable to ascribe the presence of certain physiognomic ideas in nineteenth-century fiction, which in earlier fiction had been seldom or only perfunctorily treated, to the new emphasis they are given in the Essays on Physiognomy. For example, Lavater 's com- ments on the clarification and beautification of facial features in or just be- fore death, which were practically unprecedented in physiognomic theory, seem to have been realized in one way or another in The Mill on the Floss , Daniel Deronda and Middlemarch, as they are most elaborately in Wuthering Heights.20 Again, the fact that novelists such as Scott and Balzac make fre- quent use of animal images in their character descriptions may not be un- connected with the engravings of animal faces, sometimes in juxtaposition with human faces, in Lavater 's Essays. The notion of resemblances between human beings and animals, which had already been advanced by the physiognomists of classical antiquity, and reasserted by Giambattista della Porta in the sixteenth century, was acknowledged by Lavater primarily as an aesthetic phenomenon, in accordance with his theological concept of human nature. Yet, supplemented as it was by engravings of animals, in- cluding Porta 's, together with anthropomorphic interpretations of them, this notion must have held no little appeal for secular minds concerned with literary portraiture.21 George Eliot herself occasionally resorts to animal comparisons, most of these being of purely visual interest, such as the "frog face" label used in respect of Joshua Rigg in Middlemarch , though in refer- ences to Hetty Sorrel's cat-like physicality or to the canine characteristics of 32</page><page sequence="5">Tom and Maggie Tulliver as children we may discern the influence of Dar- winian thought. Much more important, however, is Eliot's treatment of two aspects of physiognomy to which Lavater gives special attention: the national and the family physiognomy. Although the concept of the national physiognomy had already been recognized by Aristotle and other classical physiogno- mists, its conspicuous presence in travel books as well as fiction published from the 1790s onward was almost certainly the consequence of its having been discussed (and illustrated) in the Essays on Physiognomy.22 Among ref- erences to national physiognomies in Eliot's fiction, some of which seem perfunctory, such as Madame Laure's "Greek profile" (M:180) or Mr. Hor- rocks's "Mongolian eyes" (M:269) in Middlemarch, several are expressive of central themes. Thus Adam Bede's presentation as a man of great physical and moral strength and as a highly-gifted craftsman is reinforced symboli- cally by the idea that his appearance reminds the narrator of the early an- cestors of the English people: "In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon, and justified his name; but the jet-black hair [...] and the keen glance of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly marked, prominent, and mobile eyebrows indicated a mixture of Celtic blood" (AB:50). By contrast, there seems to be nothing traditional about the appearance of Adam's feck- less rival, the aristocratic Arthur Donnithorne, representing as he does the fashionable gentleman of his day, that is, "some tawny-whiskered, brown-locked, clear-complexioned young Englishman" whom the reader is assumed to have met with "in a foreign town" and been "proud of as a fel- low-countryman - well-washed, high-bred, white-handed, yet looking as if he could deliver well from the left shoulder, and floor his man. . ." (AB:105). The satire underlining that description is similar to that found in a passage of Daniel Deronda , where the narrator, despite admitting that the English are "a miscellaneous people," and that "any chance fifty of [them] will present many varieties of animal architecture or facial ornament," still finds the English physiognomy of the period at its most typical in the "easy style of [...] figure and clothing" of the English gentleman as well as in the latter 's objection to "looking inspired"; namely, a type of "well-bred Englishman" (DD:135f) who, while contemplatively observing the entrance of the eccen- trically-attired Jew Klesmer, described as embodying "a felicitous combina- tion of the German, the Sclave, and the Semite" (DD:77), betrays a xenopho- bia which, as Eliot suggests elsewhere, goes hand in hand with a deep-seated fear (and ignorance) of foreign physiognomies.23 Nevertheless, it is in the self-same novel that the author points the way to a conciliatory attitude toward alien peoples by showing how, in his search for his own hereditary roots, one high-bred Englishman not only develops an apprecia- tion of the Jewish physiognomy through his love for Mir ah Cohen, but 33</page><page sequence="6">proves to possess in ideal form the very physiognomy Mordecai has been ascribing to the man he would appoint as leader of those working for the Jewish cause.24 Lavater's assertion that "family physiognomy is as undeniable as na- tionality" was very probably a self-evident truth for George Eliot, given the prominence of these two ideas in her fiction; and though scholars have been cognizant rather of her treatment of family resemblances, few may know that Lavater claimed to be the first physiognomist ever to draw attention to this aspect of physiognomy.25 Seldom present in English fiction before the 1790s, the family physiognomy, which is at first used mainly for plot con- struction, as, for example, in Ann Radcliffe's and Sir Walter Scott's fiction, is treated elaborately in Eliot's novels.26 In Adam Bede, for example, descrip- tions of the hero, his brother Seth and their mother Lisbeth, of Mrs. Poyser and her relations, of Mrs. Irwine and her son, contain prominent references to family resemblances, with differences in appearance suggesting differ- ences in character and temperament. But whereas an awareness of a family likeness can be a disconcerting experience, especially when recognition of one's own physicality in one's parents means knowing that one has inher- ited their weaknesses as well, it can also be a poetic one, as we see in Mrs. Poyser 's observations of, and comments on, resemblances between members of her family - Dinah Morris, the latter 's aunt Judith, Hetty Sorrel, and her own daughter Totty. Moreover, through Mrs. Poyser 's physiognomic eye we sense the strength of family unity no less than its clannishness, just as we do in Daniel Deronda, through references to the mutual resemblance of the Meyricks, even with respect to their handwriting, and to that of the Gascoignes. Such clannishness is humorously illustrated when, after living in dread of a contrary outcome, Rosamond Vincy's mother is glad to know that her grandsons have turned out "real Vincys" and "'did not feature the Garths'" (M:891); and more humorously still in The Mill on the Floss through the pride or contempt with which the Tullivers and Dodsons compare one another's family characteristics, especially as visible in the youngest genera- tion. Thematically significant, too, are the different ways in which Eliot il- lustrates the notion of the sadness of "family likeness" (AB:83) spoken of by the narrator of Adam Bede. For example, the reference to a resemblance be- tween Amos Barton's daughter Patty and his late wife as she stands by the latter 's graveside with her father has a gentle poignancy typical of so many physical descriptions in Scenes of Clerical Life. In Romola , on the other hand, family resemblances have tragic implications appropriate to the presenta- tion of the heroine. Thus whereas the physical similarity between Romola and her father is consistent with their similarity in outlook, the reference to her resemblance to her brother seems but an ironic foreshadowing of the 34</page><page sequence="7">fact that her life will take on something of the asceticism which she has found so repellent in respect of his monastic vocation. It is, moreover, dur- ing the rootless existence she is forced to lead in the wake of her broken marriage that Romola learns of Tito's deception of her in a most disturbing form, that is, by recognizing certain aspects of his appearance in the children he has had by Tessa. And just as Tito is doubtless reminded of his guilt every time he looks at those children, so Godfrey Cass seems reminded of his when he remarks that the daughter he will fail to claim back from Silas Marner has inherited his own eyes, and, later, when his wife Nancy tells him of being struck as never before by the likeness of Eppi's hair and eyes to his. Much the same pathos underlies Gwendolen Harleth's recognizing in the illegitimate children of Lydia Glasher the physical characteristics of Grandcourt, all the more as they intensify her unease about her marriage to him. George Eliot also uses family physiognomies for plots concerning the heredity of children, especially those adulterously conceived or born out of wedlock. For example, the explanation of Harold Transóme 's being physi- cally quite unlike his putative father is ironically foreshadowed at the time he meets up with his mother's former lover Jermyn, when, just after Harold has recalled his uncle's dislike of the latter 's "white, fat, but beauti- fully-shaped hands, which he was in the habit of rubbing gently on his en- trance into a room," the narrator adds: " - but as his own were soft and dimpled, and as he too was given to the innocent practice of rubbing those members, his suspicions were not yet deepened" (FH:113). Contrasted with this is the gradual revelation of Esther Lyon's upper-class heredity, which, adumbrated already in Felix Holt's surprise at her not resembling her sup- posed father, is completed once Christian has told Mr. Lyon that she is "the image of Bycliffe whom [he] knew well - an uncommonly fine woman - steps like a queen" (FH:453). Family resemblances also play their part in the revelation of Will Ladislaw's heredity, whereby the fact that there was "not even a family likeness" (M:101) between his grandmother, Casaubon's aunt Julia, and his own mother, and that there is no physical resemblance be- tween himself and his cousin Casaubon, points forward to Will's later re- mark about "rebellious blood on both sides" (M:402). And though Raffles, who once worked for Ladislaw's parents, uses the "uncommon likeness" he can see the latter bearing to his father as to "mouth - nose - eyes - hair turned off [his] brow [...] a little in the foreign style" (M:658) partly in order to convince the young man, and not without scurrilous innuendoes, that he alone knows the reason why his mother ran away from home, Will is none the less confident that even the Chettams "would fjnd out that the blood in his veins was as free from the taint of meanness as theirs" (M:659).27 35</page><page sequence="8">The importance of possessing the "right" heredity, as suggested above, is perhaps most symbolically manifest in portrait paintings showing mem- bers of one particular family down the centuries. This idea is ironically borne out in Daniel Deronda when, having spoken of the constant embel- lishment of succeeding generations of Mallinger faces, and mentioned the hereditary nose as a "slight lengthening" in Sir Hugo, as "the appropriate nose of the family" in his younger brother, and "to be seen in all its refined regularity in his nephew Mallinger Grandcourt," the narrator adds: "But in the nephew Daniel Deronda the family faces of various types, seen on the walls of the gallery, found no reflex" (DD:204f).28 This disclosure, which' is later corroborated by Gwendolen's realization that "hardly any face could be less like Deronda 's than that represented as Sir Hugo's in a crayon por- trait at Diplow" (DD:378f), intrigues the reader quite as much as the physi- ognomic similarities and differences used by Ann Radcliffe and Sir Walter Scott to construct plots concerning the mystery surrounding their characters' parentage. The fact that Daniel himself learns to his dismay that he is, physically speaking, "like his mother and not like his father" (DD:210) pre- figures that moment when he will come face to face with the former at a meeting that has been arranged partly at the instigation of a stranger he met in a Frankfurt synagogue, whose irritating question about his parentage he dismissed at the time as "dictated probably by some fancy of likeness such as often occurs without real significance" (DD:418), and yet who turns out to be his late grandfather's friend Joseph Kalonymos. Daniel's reunion with his mother is remarkable not least for their intense scrutiny of one another's faces, during which the hero learns about his physical (and spiritual) resem- blance to his father and grandfather, and recognizes something of himself in his mother's face. The similarity between mother and son is again shown when, immediately after Daniel has put his hand in his mother's, the nar- rator assumes the reader to have recognized that it was "her own, very much smaller, [and] was of the same type," a resemblance presently con- firmed when, feeling "the smaller hand holding his," the hero sees nearer to him "the face that held the likeness of his own, aged not by time but by in- tensity" (DD:697). Reminding us as they do of other fiction in which Eliot makes lyrical use of family resemblances, all such details prove, however, to be but an ironic prelude, not to any desire on the mother's part to re-establish their relationship, as the young man has been ready to concede to, but merely to her concern, now that she is fatally ill, to fulfill her duty to her father by telling his grandson the truth about his Jewish heredity. Dan- iel's joy at discovering that truth, however, derives less from filial love than from the fact that he has already begun to live out his grandfather's dictum, namely, that "every Jew should rear his family as if he hoped that a Deliv- erer might spring from it" (DD:726); indeed, not unlike Will Ladislaw per- 36</page><page sequence="9">haps at the time of his marriage to Dorothea Brooke, Daniel is shown at the end of his second interview with the Princess to have overcome "all his boyish yearnings and anxieties about his mother" (DD:731) and with it, no doubt, those images he has cherished about their physical resemblance to each other.29 II. When Daniel Deronda s mother, confident that she has at last satisfied her deceased father's wishes, says to her son, "your face will come instead of his - your young loving face" (DD:704) and, later, inferred from "the dif- ficult language" of that face that he is "in love with a Jewess" (DD:724f), she displays thereby, together with mothers similarly sensitive to the faces of their children in Adam Bede, Romola , and Middlemarch, something of that physiognomic awareness which we so often find in Eliot's fictional charac- ters. And though physiognomic awareness in Eliot's novels will be later shown to differ in quality from one character to another and to serve a vari- ety of functions, it is in her treatment of love, no less than in the foregoing, that it may be seen on its most poetic plane, as we note especially at signifi- cant stages of the relationships between Gilfil and Caterina Wybrow, Lydgate and Rosamond Vincy, Daniel Deronda and Mirah Cohen, Adam Bede and Hetty Sorrel or Dinah Morris, Philip Wakem and Maggie Tulliver, Will Ladislaw and Dorothea Brooke, Tito Melema and Romola, Felix Holt and Esther Lyon. At the same time, as the author knows only too well, it is often faithful but unlucky lovers such as Adam Bede or Philip Wakem that are the most alert to every detail of, and every change in, the beloved's face, thereby illustrating the idea that "every man under such circumstances is conscious of being a good physiognomist" (AB: 197). Indeed, such is Philip Wakem's familiarity with Maggie Tulliver 's face that he is able to draw a speaking likeness of it even while he is abroad. That the quality of one's observations of people is in itself a fingerpost to one's feelings for them is corroborated by Eliot in her accounts of ill-assorted couples. One striking example of this may be seen when, just after Gwendolen Harleth has been introduced to Grandcourt, the author cleverly suggests their fundamental incompatibility by describing their manner of viewing each other at their first meeting: "Grandcourt looked at Gwendolen persistently with a slightly exploring gaze, but without change of expression, while she only occasion- ally looked at him with a flash of observation a little softened by coquetry" (DD:146). The interest of that reference derives not a little from its pointing up the quite original way in which Eliot uses someone's manner of observation as a means of apprehending their moral essence. Certainly, for all that might be learnt about Grandcourt from his various physical characteristics, his predatory attitude toward Gwendolen throughout his courtship of her al- 37</page><page sequence="10">ready tells us a good deal about his relentless will to dominate others. This idiosyncrasy is made transparent when, having remarked that Grandcourt had "a delusive mode of observing whatever had an interest for him, which could be surpassed by no sleepy-eyed animal on the watch for prey," the narrator presently adds: "If Grandcourt cared to keep any one under his power, he saw them out of the corners of his long narrow eyes, and if they went behind him, he had a constructive process by which he knew what they were doing there" (DD:465). It is interesting to compare those details with the author's earlier description of Daniel Deronda's rather different way of observing people, inasmuch as the comparison implicitly affirms the stark contrast between the cousins as to moral disposition. Daniel is a typi- cal nineteenth-century fictional hero in his exceptional sensitivity to faces and, through his conversations with Hans Meyrick, something of a connois- seur of the fine arts, his heroic stature being further confirmed by reference to his fine physical appearance. Yet it is by his "usual directness of gaze - a large-eyed gravity, innocent of any intent," as we read in the context of a conversation the hero is having with Gwendolen Harleth, that Eliot not only best evokes his essential purity and integrity, but may also be hinting at a certain flaw in this otherwise seemingly perfect man. Thus, still in the same context, the narrator continues: "His eyes had a peculiarity which has drawn many men into trouble: they were of a dark yet mild intensity, which seemed to express a special interest in every one on whom he fixed them, and might easily help to bring on him those claims which ardently sympa- thetic people are often creating in the minds of those who need help" (DD:3 77). Indeed, we may come to wonder later, and not without that pas- sage in mind, whether Deronda's constant scrutinizing of Gwendolen Har- leth in the combined mode of reproving brother and detached lover, often to her discomfiture and embarrassment, as well as his distaste for vulgar faces, does not stamp him in the end as someone who, despite all his moral de- cency and racial idealism, never quite overcomes the priggish English gen- tleman in himself. Similarly, just as Eliot provides us here with a clue to understanding Daniel Deronda's character, so she succeeds in unveiling Tito Melema's essential deviousness in much the same fashion. For virtuous as Tito appears to most people through his extraordinary physical beauty, and sensitive physiognomist as he is toward Romola 's looks while he re- mains in love with her, his inveterate hedonism and opportunism are strongly hinted at when, in the context of his encounter with Savonarola, he is designated by the narrator as someone "whose glance never seemed ob- servant, but rarely let anything escape it" (R:615), words reminding us that the hero has earlier been attributed with "the power of seeing everything without seeming to see it" (R:458). 38</page><page sequence="11">III. The narrator's perspicuous hints here as to Tito's true character may be seen as an ironic comment on the fact that it proves in the end to have re- mained hidden from all but those not dazzled by his engaging looks. No- where does Eliot more admirably articulate her private doubts about physi- ognomy than by developing to a veritable maximum in Romola the time-honored literary theme of the deception of appearances.30 The theme is first introduced in the novel when Piero di Cosimo, having carefully ob- served Tito Melema in Nello 's barber shop, invites him to sit for a painting of Sinon "deceiving old Priam" (R:87). Although Nello strenuously defends Tito's handsome appearance by claiming it to be more suitable for St. Sebas- tian or Phoebus Apollo, Piero regards that defense simply as a validation of the reason for his request, saying: "A perfect traitor should have a face which vice can write no marks on - lips that will lie with a dimpled smile - eyes of such agate-like brightness and depth that no infamy can dull them - cheeks that will rise from a murder and not look haggard" (R:87).31 Piero 's emphatic denial that he considers Tito an actual traitor, and his readiness to allow that he might even have "the heart of a hero" (R:87), may be thought in retrospect to have been physiognomically inadequate. Yet when, in ref- erence to his painting of Tito as Bacchus, Piero later remarks not only that the young man's face "expresses fear well, because it's naturally a bright one" (R:246), but that he is "beginning to look like" (R:247) the painted fig- ure, we have a physiognomic reading that is as portentous of subsequent events as Fra Luca 's warning to Romola against Tito through a vision he has had of a man "whose face [he] could not see," and whom he witnessed be- ing married to her at Santa Croce by a priest wearing "the face of death" (R:215). As well as adumbrating his betrayal of Romola and hinting at a past he has sedulously concealed, physiognomy will in some sense also force Tito to confront the truth of that past each time he recognizes the face of one or other of the two men he has long been anxious to avoid: Fra Luca and Baldassare, the former, ironically enough, through his "likeness to Bardo and Romola" (R:179).32 Yet physiognomy also enables Tito to enjoy prolonged success in sev- eral spheres of Florentine life, partly because he knows how to use his face as a mask, but mainly because he impresses most people with the beauty of a "bright face" (R:146) that some of them associate with goodness. Thus when Romola 's godfather taunts her with being too ready to believe in "the first pair of bright eyes" to have come within her reach, she defends her love for Tito on the ground that he is "so good," adding, "and if he is handsome, too, why should I not love him the better for that? It seems to me beauty is part of the finished language by which goodness speaks" (R:251). If, not- withstanding this virtually Lavaterian assessment of Tito, Romola in time 39</page><page sequence="12">comes to find that beauty "loathsome" (R:356), not so the simple-hearted Tessa, who almost always feels safe with Tito because, as she tells him, he is "so beautiful - like the people going into Paradise: they are all good" (R:158); an idea she will repeat several years later to Romola just as the latter is about to remark on the resemblance she has detected between Tessa's son and his father in respect to eyes and eyebrows.33 It is, therefore, ironic that Tessa's worldly-wise mother Monna Ghita, with her "half-sad, half-ludicrous maternal resemblance to the tender baby-face of the little maiden" (R:70) should appear to have judged Tito at first sight far better than any other character in the novel when, declining to be taken in by his "bright young smile," she addresses him thus: "Yes, yes, you can grin as well as other monkeys in cap and jerkin. You're a minstrel or a mounte- bank, I'll be sworn; you look for all the world as silly as a tumbler when he's been upside down and got on his heels again" (R:70) - a judgment which, however perceptive it may seem in hindsight, must needs be gauged to some extent in the light of two rhetorical questions later put to the reader as follows: "Was it that Tito's face attracted or repelled according to the mental attitude of the observer? Was it a cypher with more than one key?" (R:153).34 The interest of Tito Melema's presentation derives in no small measure from its exemplifying the author's abiding concern with people's responses and attitudes to human beauty. The favorable reactions of different charac- ters on different occasions to Tito's beauty, like those to Gwendolen Har- leth's or Hetty Sorrel's, may be understood partly as the effect of sensations determined by an instinctive acceptance of particular codes and conventions as to the outward person. That beauty is often a matter of sex appeal is im- plicit in Eliot's delineation of the love relationships between Lydgate and Rosamond Vincy, Sir James Chettam and Celia Brooke, Tito Melema and Romola. Hence, perhaps, the high esteem in which beauty is held in up- per-class English society, as we see when, for example, Celia Brooke insists on "blood and beauty" (M:594) as the two main things required in a hus- band, or when, with Rosamond Vincy in mind, Mr. Chichely champions women that are "blond with a certain gait and a swan neck" (M:115), or Mrs. Irwine deplores Hetty Sorrel's beauty for being "thrown away among the farmers" (AB:319), such attitudes being occasionally buttressed by forth- right condemnations of ugliness or plainness as made, for instance, by Mrs. Irwine, Celia Brooke or Lydgate. There are, to be sure, defenses of the plain such as Rector Cadwallader's of Casaubon and Mrs. Farebrother's of Mary Garth; but few such defenses seem to be made with unshakeable conviction. Even Maggie Tulliver, for all her idealism on behalf of the unprepossessing, is compelled to pay tribute to beauty in the end; for though she develops "rather a tenderness for deformed things" such as "wry-necked lambs" (MF:252) and defies her brother in his disapproval of her relationship with 40</page><page sequence="13">the hump-backed Philip Wakem by saying, "the deformity you insult would make me [...] care for him the more" (MF:450f), she will, in spite of herself, succumb to the handsome Stephen Guest. Indeed, such references take on an ironic resonance when, still mindful of Maggie's fascination with, and coveting of, Lucy Deane's blond beauty, we watch her almost stoic loyalty to Philip Wakem crumbling in the latter 's presence at the moment when "something strangely powerful" in the light of Stephen's "long gaze" causes her face to "turn towards it and look upward at it - slowly, like a flower at the ascending brightness" (MF:560). Even the worthy Mrs. Poyser, who typifies the feminine eye that best detects the moral deficiencies under the "'dear deceit'" (AB:200) of beauty and who "professed to despise all per- sonal attractions," nevertheless "continually gazed at Hetty's charms by the sly, fascinated in spite of herself," often confessing to her husband that she "firmly believed, 'the naughtier the little huzzy behaved, the prettier she looked'" (AB:128). Mrs. Poyser 's ambiguous attitude to female beauty seems to be gener- ally shared by Eliot's narrators, some of whom are given to extensive dis- courses on the subject in contexts of character description. Noteworthy is the capacity of these narrators to distinguish between qualities of beauty and to appreciate or categorize them in the manner of the aesthete, whether it be the beauty of a woman's arm, the beauty of an elderly woman's face, or the "springtide beauty" (AB:128) of Hetty Sorrel.35 Something of their aes- thetic sensibility seems also to underlie the appreciation that Eliot's female characters show for one another's beauty, as we see, for example, in Dorothea Brooke's admiration for her sister Celia, or Maggie Tulliver's envy of Lucy Deane, or Mary Garth's unease in the presence of Rosamond Vincy. That beauty does not necessarily have any moral or spiritual meaning is suggested when, in a long description of Hetty Sorrel, the narrator says: "the beauty of a lovely woman is like music: what can one say more? Beauty has an expression beyond and far above the one woman's soul that it clothes" (AB:400). Hence it is, as the same narrator presently remarks in ironic allusion to Adam Bede's infatuation with Hetty, that "the noblest nature is often the most blinded to the character of the one woman's soul that the beauty clothes" (AB:400). It would, however, be a mistake to as- sume that Eliot categorically rejects Lavater's correlation between beauty and virtue; on the contrary, the well-favored facial features of, say, Adam Bede, Dinah Morris, Daniel Deronda, Dorothea Brooke, Mirah Cohen and Romola signify the essential goodness of these characters. No doubt, the narrator of Adam Bede is in a much stronger position to evaluate Hetty Sor- rel's beauty objectively than, say, "the sallow-faced" (AB:143) Mary Bürge, who, while watching the hero's eyes fixed on the latter at a luncheon, thinks that "so sensible a man as Adam must be reflecting on the small value of 4Ī</page><page sequence="14">beauty in a woman whose temper was bad" (AB:308). Yet prompted as it is by jealousy, that judgment has a physiognomic validity not unrelated to the one which Mrs. Arrowpoint, in contradistinction to general opinion, makes of Gwendolen Harleth as follows: "She is not really so handsome if you come to examine her features. ... It is a certain style she has, which pro- duces a grand effect at first, but afterwards she is less agreeable" (DD:73f). If Mrs. Arrowpoint 7s physiognomic reading is not altogether devoid of re- sentment, it, nevertheless, serves as a foreshadowing of the heroine's short- comings, at the same time as it is thematically linked not only with Eliot's portraits of other handsome, though feckless, men and women, but also with her revaluation of the plain and the ugly. A paramount example of this revaluation is the presentation of Mrs. Arrowpoinťs intelligent and musically gifted daughter Catherine, a sensitive analysis of whose incon- spicuous looks, as given in context with Klesmer's "passionate attachment" to her, is prefaced by the narrator's claim that "the most powerful of all beauty is that which reveals itself after sympathy and not before it," and supplemented by the contention that "the most obvious beauty" eventually becomes "tiresome by iteration" (DD:281). The thematic importance of these details is reinforced by other fictional contexts whereby, just as one narrator speaks for all of Eliot's narrators in acknowledging "all honour and rever- ence to the divine beauty of form" (AB:224), so her narrators in general plead for a better understanding of the plain and the ugly, partly because they are in the majority, at least in Britain, and partly because some of them are the most lovable or knowledgeable of people. If Eliot's questioning of popular attitudes toward beauty and ugliness sometimes gives an impression of special pleading, her unequivocal concern to be as objective as possible thereby, as, for example, when in The Mill on the Floss she questions the theory that "unusual virtues spring by a direct consequence out of personal disadvantages" (MF:430), may in part explain why she makes her narrators set so much store by meticulous observation. This attitude is already implicit in their injunctions to their readers to accept people for what they are physically and to recognize Nature as the creator of man, no matter how unpredictable her laws of heredity or how contra- dictory the relationship between appearance and character or aptitude; in- deed, with their knowledge of physiology and anatomy, as well as their tendency to comment on various types of faces, facial features, facial expres- sions, coloring, gestures and postures, or to go into descant upon an impres- sive appearance or an unforgettable pathognomic moment, Eliot's narrators come across collectively as observers accomplished enough to approximate even Lavater's ideal physiognomist.36 Significant in this connection, too, is their awareness of the fine arts, as manifest especially in their references to Correggio, Moroni, Reynolds, Rembrandt, and several other masters in de- 42</page><page sequence="15">scriptive contexts, all of which may remind us how closely Lavater linked painting with physiognomy.37 Mention might also be made of the narrators' physiognomic language, especially their varied use of the terms "physiog- nomy" and "phiz," their noting of correspondences or contradictions be- tween certain physical features, their recourse to physiognomic metaphor, simile and personification, their synechdochic uses of "faces" or "eyes," and so on.38 Added to this is the way in which they enhance the physiognomic interest of their descriptions with a convention used by Scott, Balzac and Stendhal, namely, that of presenting them from the viewpoint of a wide range of imaginary observers - "the initiated eye" (R:174), "an experienced eye" (AB:240), "a close observer" (DD:800), "a superficial glance" (SCL:46), "indifferent observers" (M:633), "a mere physiognomist" (MF:233) - ,the least able of whom are brought in to exemplify various kinds of physiog- nomic incompetence or, at best, to corroborate the obviousness of a particu- lar appearance, and the most gifted to alert the reader to a physical feature or facial expression overlooked or underrated, to mark a subtle change, or to share an exquisite moment seldom otherwise experienced. Furthermore, with references to "you" or "we," the narrators treat their readers as fellow observers, presumptuously imputing to us a similar sensibility, similar re- sponses to particular appearances and even a similar weakness for beauty, yet also wondering whether we have "a keen eye for physiognomy" (SCL:50), warning us against hasty or superficial judgments, apprising us of the difficulty of reading "the lines and lights of the human countenance [...] without a key" (MF:334), telling us what to notice about someone's appear- ance, or urging us to look hard at a character about to be described; in other words, advising us how we may become better physiognomists.39 The didacticism of Eliot's narrators surely accounts for their tendency to illustrate parabolically, as it were, some of the reasons or consequences of erroneous physiognomic judgments. That wrong-headed attitudes to ap- pearances are often determined by general opinion and fostered by super- stition is suggested by the alacrity with which Eliot's provincial inhabitants disapprove of those with an unconventional appearance. Hence, for exam- ple, the almost universal distaste for Felix Holt's looks, or the hostile reac- tions to Maggie Tulliver for "her direct gaze" and her "coarse" style of beauty, which places her "in the opinion of all feminine judges far below her cousin Miss Deane" (MF:548), and for her "very physique," which, we are later told, "the world's wife" had always found something that "a refined instinct felt to be prophetic of harm" (MF:621). Sometimes a narrator will even intervene in order to question a dubious physiognomic judgment, such as one made by a stranger of Dinah Morris's appearance; or, alluding to Harold Transóme 's misinterpretation of a sudden change in Esther Lyon's facial expression as evidence of her love for him, in order to remark: "But 43</page><page sequence="16">we interpret signs of emotion as we interpret other signs - often quite erro- neously, unless we have the right key to what they signify" (FH:590). Again, when Mrs. Tulliver visits Mr. Wakem in an effort to persuade him not to buy her husband s mill, the narrator is prompted to speculate, with the reader, whether Wakem is really the "hook-nosed glib fellow" (MF:229) Mr. Tulliver has represented him as being in his "eidolon or portrait" (MF:334) of him, and then goes on to discourse on the dangers of physiog- nomy. A similar intervention occurs in the context of young Maggie Tul- liver 's illogically unfavorable reading of Bob Jakin's appearance, which is one of several prejudiced physiognomic judgments pronounced from time to time in The Mill on the Floss, including those that are intended to under- mine Maggie's relationship with Philip Wakem, and that are ironically left without comment. The same sort of tendentiousness appertains in dis- agreements over someone's physical appearance, whether between two imaginary observers, between an imaginary observer and a character, be- tween imaginary observers and a group of local inhabitants, or between two groups of actual onlookers, as it does when two minor characters dispute over someone's looks or, more importantly, when someone's sensitively affirmative judgment of a character's appearance is utterly at variance with majority opinion, insofar as the "deeper" physiognomic readings are in each instance usually authenticated either by narratorial irony or by the outcome of events. IV. Eliot's tendency to use her narrators and imaginary observers in order to correct or criticize wrong-headed physiognomists may be understood as an aspect of her concern to suggest that one's capacity for observation is more or less proportionate to one's moral and mental make-up. It is, of course, undeniable that, among a wide variety of physiognomic comments to be found in Eliot's fiction, some will tell us a good deal about the ob- served, but little about the observer; for, like many other nineteenth-century novelists, Eliot makes use of individual or collective judgments of particular human appearances to enhance the physical presentation of her main char- acters, or to make palpable for the reader certain moral or psychological changes they have undergone, or even to thicken a plot. These judgments often form part of the gossip heard among the lower orders - for example, Mr. Macey's comments on Silas Marner, Squire Cass and Godfrey Cass, those of women servants on Gwendolen Harleth, Dorothea Brooke, Esther Lyon and Mrs. Transóme, and those of several minor figures on Hetty Sorrel just before and during her trial in court. Yet at the same time as such physi- ognomic readings at best betoken the native perspicacity of domestics, tradespeople and rustics, some seem intended as little more than an ironic homage to the Lavaterian climate, a typical instance being given in Adam 44</page><page sequence="17">Bede when Betty Cranage, having listened to Dinah Morris preaching, but failed to discover the pleasures of wearing "a cap like Dinah's" instead of "earrings and fine gowns," takes to "studying Dinah's nose, eyes, mouth and hair," while "wondering whether it was better to have such a sort of pale face as that, or fat red cheeks and round black eyes like her own" (AB:73). It is in her portrayal of the gentry and the middle classes that Eliot is rather more inclined to suggest moral essence through references to physi- ognomic attitudes or judgments. We have a splendid example in Mrs. Ir- wine at the very moment she avers that she could never like a man whose looks she disapproved of; an asseveration that places her at once in the cate- gory of those provincial people satirized by Eliot for their narrow minded- ness. And just as Mrs. Irwine is an archetype of those whose physiognomic disposition seems incapable of development, so Eliot's good-natured char- acters such as Mary Garth, Mirah Cohen, Esther Lyon, and Dr. Kenn dis- play, especially through the benevolence with which they respond to faces commonly misjudged, a physiognomic maturity beyond which develop- ment is scarcely necessary. On that head, both types of observer have a thematic rather than a dramatic interest for the reader, however closely the sympathetic figures may correspond to the author's implicit image of the worthy physiognomist. The same is hardly less true of characters such as Tito Melema and Grandcourt, whose predatory or cunning way of observ- ing people, as shown above, enables Eliot to underline once and for all the peculiar villainy of both men. Moreover, though Tito during his courtship of Romola exhibits the same high degree of physiognomic sensitivity as almost any other lover in Eliot's fiction, such sensitivity is inevitably marked by a certain egotism and, even at its most poetic level, may be colored by that aestheticism which, as Eliot suggests through the presentation of some of her upper-class characters, is largely born of, and conditioned by, social privilege and cultural refinement. The idea that there is even something sterile about extreme physiognomic sensitivity is hinted at in Daniel Deronda 's characterization, and perhaps much more so in that of his mother, who for all her responsiveness to her son's facial features, remains none the less imprisoned within her ingrained lovelessness. More interesting from a humanistic as well as a dramatic standpoint are those characters in whom moral development is indicated to some extent by certain transformations in their physiognomic awareness. Indeed, not un- like the protagonists of the Bildungsroman , some of Eliot's main characters are put through a kind of education in life, part of which seems to consist in learning some of the physiognomic lessons taught by their narrators. It is interesting, first of all, to note the extent to which Dorothea's moral devel- opment may be estimated by consideration of her physiognomic judgments 45</page><page sequence="18">and responses. Having grown up in a fairly comfortable social environ- ment, where she has evidently had leisure enough to cultivate her refined sensibility, Dorothea reminds us a little of Daniel Deronda through the sharpness with which, in the early chapters of Middlemarch, she is given to observing people living in her midst. At the same time, her very exemption from the cares of the outside world would appear to have nurtured in her a certain misanthropy, which we detect, for example, in her pernickety reac- tions to Sir James Chettam's looks or to the way people grimace and ges- ticulate at social gatherings - reactions that may account for her oddly sym- pathetic attitude to Casaubon 's unprepossessing appearance. The fact that Dorothea should have decided to marry Casaubon, not despite, but, appar- ently, because of his resemblance to "the portrait of Locke" (M:38) and his having "the spare form and pale complexion which become a student" (M:43), and then upheld her decision by fallaciously taxing her sister Celia with looking at men "as if they were merely animals with a toilette" and for never seeing "the great soul in a man's face" (M:43), is remarkable for being symptomatic of the heroine's sexual immaturity. For though her defence of Casaubon as "one of the most distinguished-looking men" (M:42) she has ever known may sound as right-thinking as any made of other characters in Eliot's fiction that are physiognomically misread, time will prove Celia, in her persistent condemnation of Casaubon 's physicality, to have been by far the better physiognomist of the two sisters. Fortunately, Dorothea is by nature sensible enough eventually to emerge from her self-deception, as she first seems to do in that moment when, by now aware of her error in having married Casaubon, she finds "a new companionship" (M:308) with a miniature painting she has once before seen of Will Ladislaw's grand- mother, who had herself known "some difficulty about marriage" (M:308), and whose depicted face now "beamed on her with that full gaze which tells her on whom it falls that she is too interesting for the slightest movement of her eyelid to pass unnoticed and uninterpreted" (M:308). Representative as that detail is of the physiognomic sensitivity Dorothea has recently dis- played in her sympathy for Casaubon's sufferings, and will later display in respect of Lydgate during his financial troubles, it seems to mark a signifi- cant early stage in her growth to maturity and to prefigure her ultimate ful- filment as a woman through her marriage to Will Ladislaw. As regards first love, Romola 's fate is in some ways quite similar to the one endured by Dorothea Brooke. Living as she does, too, in a sheltered environment when first introduced to the reader, and restricted in her rela- tions with the world outside through having to look after her blind father, Romola has evidently learned to ignore, even repress, her emotional needs firmly enough to imagine, as she later confesses to Tito Melema, that (not unlike Dorothea) she would marry "some scholar with deep lines in his face 46</page><page sequence="19">[...] and with rather grey hair, who would agree with [her] father in taking the side of the Aristotelians, and be willing to live with him" (R:239). That Romola has been encouraged by her narrow, bookish way of life to cultivate a certain aestheticism is evident not only from the eagerness with which she will submit to the handsome Tito's charms, but also from her nostalgia for her happy childhood when, for her, "there was only one masculine face, at once youthful and beautiful, the image of which remained deeply impressed on her mind: [...] a fair face, with sunny hair, like her own" (R:105); namely, an image of her brother Dino, who, by becoming Fra Luca, has broken the family unity and been disowned by his father, described as "one of the few frank pagans of his time" (R:209). Notwithstanding "an unconquerable re- pulsion for her in [her brother's] monkish aspect" (R:209) when visiting him on his deathbed, Romola is yet sustained enough by her childhood memory of him to believe that his message to her will be of "affectionate penitence to her father" and that "at the last, there would be understanding and forgive- ness" (R:210). Instead, distressed by his uncompromising attitude to his father and then angered by the account of his vision about Tito referred to above, Romola finds the interview so unpleasant that, despite witnessing Fra Luca 's untimely death, she yearns at the end of it to "be again with her father - and with Tito" (R:218), at the same time as the horrific account of the "vision" makes her "yearn all the more for the beloved faces and voices that would assure her of her waking life" (R:218). Although Romola long relies heavily on Tito's charm, his smiling face, his pleasant voice and his seeming goodness, she will, nevertheless, come to wonder, shortly after her fateful visit to San Marco, how she may reconcile his "satisfied strength and beauty" with "that worn anguish in her brother's face - that straining after something invisible" so as to "make it intelligible that they belonged to the same world" (R:238); a sentiment somehow linked with that moment shortly afterwards when, in reply to Tito's fantasy about a sybaritic life of "lying among the flowers," she is conscious that there would always be "sad faces among the flowers, and eyes that look in vain" (R:240). Such words might have been thought quite untypical of Romola, had it not been for a chance meeting with Savonarola at her brother's death- bed, whereby her fascination with the former's physical presence, especially his "very beautiful" hands with their "marked physiognomy" (R:214) and his commanding voice, represent the first of several occasions when she will become signally aware of his preeminent spirituality and rigorous self-discipline, especially through his face, described as "not beautiful" but "strong-featured" (R:429). Indeed, her decision to renounce her cozy secu- larism for an austere life of Christian devotion and service is almost cer- tainly prompted in that moment when, just after she has defied Savonarola's injunction to return to the husband she has run away from, she finds herself 47</page><page sequence="20">somehow subdued by his particular way of looking at her: "The source of the impression his glance produced on Romola was the sense it conveyed to her of interest in her and care for her apart from any personal feeling. It was the first time she had encountered a gaze in which simple human fel- lowship expressed itself as a strongly-felt bond. Such a glance is half the vocation of the priest or spiritual guide of men, and Romola felt it impossi- ble again to question his authority to speak to her" (R:429). Savonarola's influence over Romola is perhaps never stronger than at the time he has decreed that personal ornaments of all kinds, condemned by him as the Anathema, be handed in and burnt on a sacramental bonfire. Having run into her elderly cousin Monna Brigida in the streets of Florence, just after the latter has been at length persuaded, in a comical episode, to give up her jewelry and to remove her false hair and her make-up, Romola, though "smitten with pity" for her cousin's present embarrassment, is de- scribed as "yet hardly able to help smiling at the sudden apparition of her kinswoman in a genuine, natural guise, strangely contrasted with all memo- ries of her" (R:518f). Romola's reaction to her cousin's "natural guise," as we shall see presently, bespeaks a physiognomic awareness which has by now been tempered not a little by her "living habitually amidst scenes of suffer- ing" (R:502). One of the earliest of such experiences for Romola is suggested when, while listening to Savonarola preaching in the Duomo, she is dis- tracted by Baldassare's arresting physical appearance, largely because "the stamp of some unwonted suffering in the face stirred in her those sensibili- ties towards the sorrows of age, which her nóble life had tended to" (R:289f) - sensibilities that will be no less keen at her last meeting with him before his death: "He looked like nothing higher than a common-bred, ne- glected old man, but she was used now to being near such people, and to think a great deal about their troubles" (R:531). It is, moreover, this heeding of human suffering which explains why, not long before encountering her cousin, Romola should have politely repudiated Piero di Cosimo's blan- dishments to her about her paintable beauty as well as his impassioned apology of art for art's sake. Nevertheless, in spite of her "sombre view of pleasure" (R:502) at this time, her rejection of the painter's aestheticism is anything but the mark of priggish Philistinism; on the contrary, her respect- ful reference to Piero while she is complimenting Monna Brigida on her unadorned face, shows that she still possesses the refined aesthetic eye of her girlhood; and yet an eye which, sharpened by the devotional life and, perhaps, by a painful schooling in the deceptiveness of appearances, now represents a pleasing maturity and humanism, as we gather from the physi- ognomic language with which she surely eases her eccentric relative's tran- sition to religious conversion: 48</page><page sequence="21">Dear cousin, [...] you don't know how much better you look than you ever did before. I see now how good-natured your face is, like yourself. That red and finery seemed to thrust themselves forward and hide expression. Ask our Piero or any other painter if he would not rather paint your portrait now than before. I think all lines of the human face have something either touching or grand, unless they seem to come from low passions. How fine old men are, like my godfather! Why should not old women look grand and simple? (R:519f) It is interesting to note the extent to which George Eliot uses physiog- nomy both to suggest Romola's inherent virtue and to mark out her inner development. Indeed, just as the heroine's exemplary behavior and comeli- ness seem to substantiate Lavater's principle of the correlation between beauty and virtue, so references to her facial features and facial expressions seem to bear out his comments on the power of the spiritual life to improve, and even to transfigure, the outward person. There is a critical juncture in Romola's presentation when she is described catching sight of her reflection in a mirror. The mirror in Eliot's fiction is often the medium by which her weak characters either narcissistically indulge their vanity or lament a de- cline in their beauty; but it is also the medium by which one may experience a useful, albeit painful, moment of self-awareness, as we see when Romola, after disguising herself as a Pinzochera nun in order to escape from Flor- ence, finds, ironically enough, that she "looked strangely like her brother Dino: the full oval of the cheek had only to be wasted; the eyes, already sad, had only to be a little sunken" (R:390). That mirror image also enables the heroine now to understand "how men could be prompted to rush away for ever from earthly delights, how they could be prompted to dwell on images of sorrow rather than of beauty and joy" (R:390). And though Romola is again reminded in the same context of her fateful last meeting with her brother, and is even alarmed at the prospect that she might become like him a "seer of visions" (R:395), she is none the less "conscious of something deeper than that coincidence of words which made the parting contact with her dying brother live anew in her mind, and gave a new sisterhood to his wasted face" (R:396). This reference to a fleeting family likeness, together with Piero di Cosimo's later designation of her as "fit to be a model for a wise Saint Catherine of Egypt" (R:501) and the image of her cherished by some villagers she looked after during the Plague as "the sweet and sainted lady with her fair face, her golden hair, and her brown eyes that had a blessing in them" (R:649), forms part of a portrait ingeniously composed in large measure of sundry physiognomic responses to the heroine's singular beauty. The portrait is then appropriately completed in the Epilogue, where, shown in the company of Tessa, her mother and her children by Tito, 49</page><page sequence="22">to the eldest of whom she is about to speak of her gratitude to Savonarola, Romola achieves a kind of apotheosis through this moving description of her outward appearance: An eager life had left its mark upon her: the finely moulded cheek had sunk a little, the golden crown was less massive; but there was a placidity in Romola's face that had never belonged to it in youth. It is but once that we can know our worst sorrows, and Romola had known them while life was new. (R:673) V. A passage as conspicuously physiognomic as the foregoing might be adjudged somewhat anomalous in a novel so much taken up with the deceptiveness of the human face, and perhaps out of keeping with the author's satirical thrusts at physiognomists, or even with the comments of her narrators and characters on the limits and limitations of personal de- scription, portrait paintings and statuary.40 Such inconsistencies are, how- ever, only apparent, and should be seen in the first place as a manifestation of Eliot's remarkably comprehensive treatment of physiognomy in her fic- tion, in which, by giving full play to conflicting and sometimes irreconcil- able attitudes to physiognomy, she shows how well she understood the dramatic possibilities inherent in so controversial a science. This breadth of treatment we have become aware of more easily than might otherwise have been possible both by knowing about Lavater's role in European literary culture and by examining Eliot's physiognomic references in the light of his Essays on Physiognomy. In that respect Eliot's fiction may be said to be of considerable interest to the historian of ideas.41 For the student of literature, on the other hand, Eliot's physiognomic references would be only of slight account unless, as we saw above, they served specifically aesthetic or struc- tural functions. Furthermore, it is through her skillful handling of physiog- nomy for purposes of plot and characterization that we realize how integral it is to her central themes. And though it might have been tempting to de- duce from certain contexts intended as means of exposing provincialism, bigotry and self-deception that Eliot was a sort of anti-Lavaterian, our dis- cussion has shown that there is much in her fiction that is utterly affirmative of physiognomy; indeed, that it is within the confines of her novels, rather than in isolated remarks in her secondary writings, that we may best discern her essential thinking about physiognomy. But while Eliot implicitly ac- knowledges, through her different narrators, the importance of rigorously objective observation, it is evident that, conscious as she is no less than Lavater himself, of the impossibility of acquiring perfect skill in physiog- nomy and of human proneness to physiognomic error, she seems interested in the physiognomic viewpoint first and foremost for what it tells us about the person behind it. That is why one may go so far as to assert that even 50</page><page sequence="23">her dismissiveness of wrong-headed physiognomists is but an expression of a fundamentally constructive and optimistic attitude toward physiognomy; an attitude that seems embodied in her compound image of the exemplary human being as someone whose capacity to see clearly is interchangeable with their capacity to think dearly. For Eliot, the ideal physiognomist, it would appear, is not so much someone capable of correct physiognomic judgments or possessed of an aesthete's eye, as someone who, guided by intuition, open-mindedness and self-awareness, and unaffected by popular opinion or fashionable taste, is given to a continually sensitive observation of others, often for its own sake; in a word, someone whose observational powers are proof of the very highest humanity. Such attributes may be dis- cerned in Eliot's narrators and glimpsed in her good-natured characters; but they are realized perhaps most delectably in the presentation of Romola, whose understanding and compassionate eye for all manner of human ap- pearances illustrates one important way in which, despite her disappoint- ment with the Essays in Physiognomy , Eliot's fiction seems close in spirit to Lavater's conception of physiognomy as the art of learning to know and to love one's fellow creatures.42 We who live in a curiously unphysiognomic era, in which physiog- nomy has for the most part become marginalized from everyday life as a subject suitable for scientific or sociological research, may come to wonder whether Eliot has not brought too many physiognomists into her fiction or whether her fervently lyrical descriptions of the human face and heartfelt meditations on observation have not dated somehwat by virtue of the quaintly genteel tone permeating the language in which they are couched. Luckily for us, Eliot's treatment of physiognomy is broad enough in scope to include a good many references that still have an unmistakable timelessness about them, as may be seen, for example, at the beginning of Daniel Deronda , when to the histrionically ambitious, but essentially untalented, Gwendolen Harleth's lament that, instead of giving her a "perfectly straight nose" such as a saint might have, her mother gave her a turned-up "happy nose," which would "not do so well for tragedy," Mrs. Davilow "with a deep, weary sigh" gives the following reply: "Oh, my dear, any nose will do to be miserable with in this world" (DD:57); or, again, when, having described the disturbing effect that Herr Klesmer's exotic physical appearance has on a gathering of stuffy Englishmen, the narrator of the same novel declares: "One sees why it is better for greatness to be dead, and to have got rid of the outward man" (DD: 136). 5Ī</page><page sequence="24">NOTES *See especially William Baker, George Eliot and Judaism (Salzburg: Insti- tut für Anglistik und Amerikanistik, Universität Salzburg, 1975): 122, 221; Felicia Bonaparte, Will and Destiny: Morality and Tragedy in George Eliot's Novels (New York: New York UP, 1975): 71-72; John Graham, "The Devel- opment of the Use of Physiognomy in the Novel" (Diss.

For discussions on family physiognomies in nineteenth-century European fiction, see Tytler, Physiognomy in the European Novel : 238-47. In this connection, Lavater writes: This is a truth, that features and forms are visibly transmitted from generation to generation; and moral dis- position follows in the same manner" ( Essays , tr. Moore: 1, 137). 28Lavater speaks of family physiognomies being "kept from one gen- eration to another, and always reproduced so distinct, that you may distin- guish the outward features through all the family portraits" ( Essays , tr. Moore: 1. 135ni. 29For a discussion on this physiognomic encounter between Daniel Deronda and his mother, see Baker, George Eliot : 21 6f. ^or discussions on this theme in Eliot's fiction, see Simon-Baumann, Die Darstellung der Charaktere : 87; Witemeyer, George Eliot: 45-57.

(Essays, tr. Holcroft: I, 65). 32In this connection, see Lavater's discussion "On Dissimulation, False- hood and Sincerity" in Essays, tr. Holcroft: I, 152-65. Especially apposite here is Lavater's following statement: "The art of dissimulation itself, which is adduced as so unsuperable an objection to the truth of physiognomy, is founded upon physiognomy" (Essays, tr. Holcroft: 1, 29). Lavater's concept of beauty as an expression of virtue is central to his physiognomic thinking. See Essays, tr. Holcroft: I, 175-208. In this connec- tion, it is interesting to note that Chapter 20 of Daniel Deronda is headed by 56</page><page sequence="29">Alexander Knox's following words: "It will hardly be denied that even in this frail and corrupted world, we sometimes meet persons who, in their very mien and aspect, as well as in the whole habit of life, manifest such a signature and stamp of virtue, as to make our judgment of them a matter of intuition rather than the result of continued examination" (DD:248). 34These non-omniscient rhetorical questions are similar in spirit to the one asked about Gwendolen Harleth at the beginning of Daniel Deronda : "Was she beautiful or not beautiful?" (DD:35). 35For discussions on the treatment of beauty in Eliot's fiction, see espe- cially Jeanne Fahnestock, "The Heroine of Irregular Features: Physiognomy and Conventions of Heroine Description," Victorian Studies 24 (1981): 325-350; John P.
