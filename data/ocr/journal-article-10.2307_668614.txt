Herausgegeben von CHRISTEL MATTHIAS SCHR6DER.) Stuttgart: W. Kohlhammer Verlag, 1962. xi, 425 pp., chapter bibliographies, index, 2 maps. DM 39. Reviewed by JOSEF HAEKEL, University of Vienna This book offers an excellent and well-balanced survey of the traditional beliefs and rituals of the circumpolar populations. Its rich contents are drawn from many sources, old and recent (including those in Russian). The data are carefully and critically checked against one another; interpretations and hypotheses in general appear to be cautiously formulated. The authors are well-known specialists in their field of study. I. Paulson's contributions in two chapters concern the religions of the Siberian and Finnish peoples. Considering the ethnic diversity in this vast region he has under- taken a comparative treatment of the manifold material with the intention of working out the common traits in the sense of a cross-cultural approach. He does not, however, ignore the local differences and emphases. Two further chapters dealing with the religion of the Lapps and the Eskimo have been written by A. Hultkrantz more in the mono- graphic manner. Both scholars have arranged their material under topics such as world-view, high gods, beliefs and cults of the hunters, nature and its beings, domestic and group rituals, shamanism, soul-concepts, and the hereafter. K. Jettmar gives an informative area-wise outline of the complicated archeological situation in northern Eurasia, taking into consideration also the most recent results of Russian prehistoric research. He attempts to use the relevant findings as clues in the reconstruction of the religious history of the region in question. In some instances he has been able to unfold interesting connections with the ethnographic present and with historic happenings.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 1167 Paulson concedes to the economic types some importance in the moulding and orien- tation of religions. Since in Siberia hunting and fishing form the essential economic basis, the game-animals play an important role in the world-view, cult, and beliefs of this area. One finds here a differentiated soul-ideology in which the so-called free soul or shadow acquires special prominence. The same is essentially true of course for the Eskimo. The Siberian hunter's ideology is characterized by a peculiar hierarchy of con- cepts: 1. Free or guardian soul of the single animal. 2. Individual guardian spirit for every animal (only partly present). 3. Spiritual masters of the species. 4. All these beings are subordinated to some major hunting deities or to the spiritual owner of the location, forests, mountains, tundra, rivers, and lakes. 5. The supreme being as lord of all the other beings; he is also thought of as the dispenser of hunting luck and food. Among the religions of the Northern Eurasian peoples belief in the supreme god of the heavens and the universe takes a central position. Paulson stresses the difference between the religious and mythological aspects of the high god. On the religious side the supreme being is conceived in the main in a vague and indeterminate fashion; but in spite of this he is considered as the great ruler of the world order and as protector and helper. He sometimes appears rather otiose and is not always worshipped in cults. In the myths the sky god has anthropomorphic features and is more distinct. Paulson points out further that the concept of this being could have been reinforced here and there through influences emanating from pastoral nomads of the southern steppes, Christianity, and Islam. He emphasizes, however, that the idea of the supreme being can be regarded as an original trait of the ancient hunting cultures of Eurasia; but he questions the validity of the view held by some authors that some hunting deities should be conceived as hypostatizations of the supreme god (for instance, among the Jurak Samoyed: the reindeer-god Ilibeambeartje as an off-shoot of the high god Num). The same standpoint is taken by Hultkrantz in regard to the relationship between the uni- versal deity Sila and the reindeer-god Pinga of the Caribou Eskimo. But with respect to the Ugrians of Western Siberia Paulson thinks that a splitting of their high god conception has in fact taken place and ascribes this to Turkish influences. As to Paulson's hypothesis that the idea of the supreme being as well as that of the spiritual owners of nature are the results of the personification of the sky or the ani- mated world, I have certain difficulties. This would imply the presence of a primary impersonal conception of the cosmic and natural forces among the ancient peoples of Northern Asia. I see no plausible reasons for the assumption of a gradual process of personification from an impersonal perception. After all, in characterizing deities and spirits it is more appropriate to use the term "personal" instead of the somewhat evolutionistic "personified." In dealing with the house, family, and sib spirits of the Ugrian it would have been desirable to point out at least as a suggestion that these beings were regarded in various ways, viz. as spirits of the village and clan founders, former heroes and shamans. Such hints would have done more justice to the actual variety of the beliefs in regard to this important category of beings among the Ugrians. Moreover, Paulson does not take into account the totemic-like associations of these group-spirits and the religious and mythological aspects of Ugrian moieties. Paulson's hints that the religions of the Northern Eurasian tribes were subject to southern influences have been emphasized and given a historical basis through some of the results of archeological research as shown by K. Jettmar. This author presents interesting interpretations of prehistoric findings through ethnographic data. An in- stance in point concerns the dead masks and indications of complicated funeral rituals in graves in the Minussinsk basin of the 1st century B.C. These traits have been brought</page><page sequence="3">1168 A merican A nthropologist [65, 1963] into connection with the dolls of the deceased and conceptions about the soul and the hereafter among the Ostyak of the 18th and 19th centuries. Jettmar rightly criticizes a hypothesis of the Soviet scholar Okladnikov who presumed that in the Siberian religions an "anthropomorphic phase" followed a primary "animalistic" one. He stresses the fact that the ancient mythology of the peoples in question admittedly might have been governed by ideas concerning the animal realm, but that there could have existed at the same time deities thought of in human-like terms. From the archeological standpoint Jettmar comes to the following tentative con- clusions in regard to the religions of Northern Eurasia: Originally no cultural and religious uniformity existed in the area. In the later prehistoric times the relatively pronounced unity can be explained by the levelling effects of long inter-ethnic contacts and trade relations in connection with the specific geographical preconditions. In every sense no unitary religious basis can be assumed. In the same way shamanism can be interpreted as the result of assimilative processes. Concepts of southern derivation pro- duced no fundamental change in the autochthonous religions, but only additions and elaborations. Ideologies of differing origins exist in part incompatibly side by side. Continental Eastern Siberia demonstrates a greater compactness in its cultural develop- ment than the western areas; and the maritime part of Northern Asia belongs to the circum-pacific region. The latter was in addition open to influences from the culturally differentiated parts of Eastern Asia on the one hand and from the Eskimo on the other. Hultkrantz stresses the discrepancy among the Eskimo between the character of their religion and the psychological attitude of the people. Specialists on North American Indian religions will find many suggestions and chal- lenges to comparative studies in this attractive book.</page></plain_text>
