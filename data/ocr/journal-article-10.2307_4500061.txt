<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marcel Duchamp's Tonsure: Towards an alternate masculinity Giovanna Zapperi In 1919 or 1921, the exact date remains uncertain, Marcel Duchamp had a five-point star shaved on his head. At the bottom of the photograph, he wrote 'Tonsure 1919 - Paris/Marcel Duchamp', which seems to suggest that the photograph was taken during his visit to Paris that same year (Fig. 1). If one accepts the proposed 1919 dating, as the indication provided by Duchamp implies, his trip to Paris that year represents his first visit to the city after spending four years in New York and nine months in Argentina. In August 1918, he left New York, where he had been living since 1915, for Buenos Aires in the company of Yvonne Crotti, recently separated from her husband, the artist Jean Crotti.2 Duchamp's decision to return to France followed both the death of his brother Raymond Duchamp-Villon from a war wound, and the end of the war itself. In an interview with Pierre Cabanne, Duchamp remarked that his departure for Buenos Aires was prompted by the United States' entry into the First World War in April 1917.3 Duchamp, who had already left France at the outbreak of the war, preferred to be resident in neutral countries. Although not an American citizen, he was required to request special permission before leaving the United States since even as a foreign resident he was eligible for the draft. Duchamp embarked for Argentina on 14 August 1918, with permission to remain abroad for six months. The armistice, signed shortly thereafter, allowed him to stop in Paris before returning to New York. This visit lasted only five months (from late July to early August 1920). Two years later, his second trip to Paris would be a little longer (from June 1921 to late January 1922). In the meantime, the city had again become the capital of the avant-garde after the interruption of the war. Given that the photograph was taken in either 1919 or 1921, it is situated in an historical context marked by the trauma of war. This is the period and this is the context in which Duchamp had this photograph of himself made, sporting the shaved five-pointed star and tail. This essay is an interrogation of this enigmatic photograph: enigmatic in terms of its photographer, enigmatic in terms of specific dating, and more significantly, enigmatic in terms of meaning. In the instance of this particular photograph, I am concerned to unpack certain meanings that have not been addressed, but which open up to larger questions about masculinity, artistic identity and cultural production in the post World War I period. With respect to the figure of Duchamp himself, I am concerned to re-examine the ways in which he has been situated having deconstructed traditional gendered positions vis-a-vis artistic production and artistic agency. The study of masculine identity in Dada, and more specifically in the case of Marcel Duchamp, has become an important subject in recent scholarship. Scholars such as Amelia Jones and David Hopkins have focussed on Duchamp's strategy with respect to his position as an author, underscoring that his ambivalence - or Duchamp's 'politics of equivocation' as Hopkins puts it4 - is 1. The date of this photograph, part of a larger series, is highly controversial. Anne d'Harnoncourt and Kynaston McShine set it as late as 1921, otherwise attributing the hair-cut to the Mexican Georges de Zayas. Anne d'Harnoncourt and Kynaston McShine (eds), Marcel Duchamp (Philadelphia and New York, 1989), p. 18.? Jacques Caumont and Jennifer Gough-Cooper specify that the photograph was taken on 1.

Paul Franklin takes up this hypothesis and bases this claim on another photograph showing Duchamp seated on a bench and leaning forward towards the camera, revealing the same comet shaved on the top of his head. This photograph is signed 'Voici/rrose Sdlavy/1921'; Duchamp must have given it to Pierre de Massot before returning to New York in January 1922.

Jones in particular has explored the notion of the author and its instability in the ambivalence - textual and visual - of Rrose Sdilavy, thereby demonstrating that Duchamp enacts a divided subject that destabilises the notion of a unique and universal author.5 For his part, Hopkins has proposed contextualising Duchamp's masculinity in relation to the construction of a specific form of 'male separatist mythology', focussing in particular on Duchamp's exchanges with his friends Man Ray and Francis Picabia. In this essay, I reconsider Duchamp's decision to abandon painting and the consequences that this entails for his way of thinking masculine subjectivity. More specifically, I explore the question of how masculinity is articulated in relation to Duchamp's identity as an artist. By analysing the implications of Tonsure, I propose to broaden the field of investigation around Duchamp's masculinity by situating this unusual self-representation with respect to his strategy of masculinity after the end of painting. In fact I maintain that Duchamp's refusal of the privileged position of artist/ 4.

If the virility of the painter who inscribes his (metaphorically sexual) mark on the canvas is not possible for Duchamp, his renunciation nevertheless opens onto other sexual strategies. In this context, what is at stake for Duchamp is the possibility of rethinking the authority of the artist in tandem with his gendered inscription through a process of the destruction and then the reconstruction of masculinity. The chronological proximity of Tonsure to the ambivalent Rrose Selavy equally suggests that Duchamp was searching for another way of representing himself as an artist. What in fact interests me in this particular instance is that a nominal renunciation of an artistic identity conventionally associated with mastery and virility is, in the case of Duchamp, far more complicated. As I shall argue in the case of the photograph Tonsure, the repudiation of a conventionally 'masculine' artistic (or sexual) identity is not necessarily identical to the abdication of masculine authority. On the contrary, my reading of Tonsure is intended to suggest that Duchamp's complicated negotiation of roles that are both vocational ('artist') and gendered (Rrose Selavy as alter ego) do not necessarily involve a repudiation of the power and authority traditionally vested in masculinity. Since the 1970s, Tonsure has been considered as a kind of mythic point of 'origin' for various contemporary artistic practices, such as body art, but no study has examined this picture in the specific context in which it was made.7 In this respect, an adequate reading of the image requires us to reconsider its significance not only in its contextual, temporal and historical setting, but in relation to those issues that are embedded in Duchamp's work during this same period: his decision to abandon painting, and notably his engagement with what I might call a problematic of masculinity. In all these respects, this period is a crucial one in the consideration of Tonsure. For what the image stages, through its allusion to the putatively desexualised masculinity of the priest, is precisely those questions that arise regarding the masculine role of the artist in a period when traditional gender roles were beginning to be subject to radical interrogation. In her memoirs, Gabrielle Buffet, Picabia's first wife, recounts a dramatic change in New York's cultural climate following the United States' military entry into the war. If, upon her arrival in 1915, 'the massacres in France seemed like a colossal advertising stunt for the benefit of some giant corporation', towards 1917, with the increasing likelihood of United States military involvement, the reality of the conflict became increasingly more perceptible: 'The recruiting offices for volunteers, which looked like French fair-booths, were stationed in the busiest parts of the city, and did not seem to be very popular, despite the fact that pretty, alluring girls, flanked by a few non-commissioned officers in brand new uniforms, were used as decoys' Duchamp, a stranger to war-time patriotism, as we know, preferred to seek refuge in a country far removed from military conflict. In this and in other ways, the First World War can be seen as having exercised a considerable influence on Marcel Duchamp's movements between 1915 and 1919. Duchamp's military status, moreover, could have caused him some difficulty in France. Having been judged by the medical authorities as unfit to serve, Duchamp made no effort to secure either non-combatant military service or work in the medical corps, in such 7. Since the 1970s, Tonsure has often been interpreted as a prefiguration of Body art, insofar as it photographically documents an action or activity of a body. See, for example, L.

Among the motivations that pushed a generation of young European men to enlist voluntarily was the need to affirm their masculinity. The war provided, in effect, an invitation to establish one's virility. Military rhetoric constantly invoked the image of a young, manly and healthy combatant in opposition to a society represented as decadent and effeminate.12 The men who were not engaged in combat thus stood the risk of seeing themselves so identified. In all these respects, I would like to suggest that Duchamp's refusal to identify with this dominant masculine stereotype played an important role in his artistic production of these years and particularly in his Tonsure. The Desexualised Masculinity of the Priest Arturo Schwarz, Duchamp's biographer, has connected this particular photograph to another, that he argues was made somewhat earlier, while Duchamp was still in Buenos Aires, showing Duchamp with a completely shaved head (Fig. 2). Schwarz relates this photograph to a letter that Duchamp sent to his sister Suzanne in Paris, a letter in which he explained that he had lost his hair, but that thanks to a special treatment concocted by Yvonne, it was growing back.13 The link between the latter photograph and the one displaying the star-shaped tonsure is, in any case, evident insofar as both were pasted into Picabia's L'oeil cacodylate (1921). In this incarnation, both pictures appear above the phrase 'Pi qu'habilla Rrose', and this is where the name of Rrose Selavy, spelled with the double 'r' appears for the first time. This coincidence suggests that the staging of Tonsure echoes his self-transformation into the transvestite Rrose Selavy.14 The co-presence of these two images of himself in Picabia's painting, along with the written phrase, likely suggested to Duchamp the possibility for a new persona. In the photograph Tonsure, Duchamp's head reclines against the back of an armchair, and because the image is cropped at the bottom, it gives the impression that the space of the image has extended into the space of the spectator while simultaneously signalling the separation of the two.is The shaved star at the back of Duchamp's head extends across the skull and down to the forehead by means of a narrow shaved strip, making the form resemble something like the tail of a comet. Whether or not Duchamp intended himself to be clearly recognizable in the photograph is somewhat ambiguous. On the one hand, his face is scarcely visible due both to his position and to the elevated angle of the camera, but on the other hand, his trademark pipe (itself a totem of masculinity) and his distinctively shaped skull would probably be recognizable by his friends. The shadowy quality of the image and the ambiguity of the subject's identity, however, suggest something like a disguise or effacement, an identity obscured or hidden under the star so conspicuously shaved on his head. Be that as it may, the dramatic transformation effected by Duchamp's coiffure was obviously fabricated for the benefit of the camera, in much the same spirit as his performance as Rrose Selavy, staged for the camera of his friend Man Ray. 10. Duchamp's two older brothers, by contrast, had been mobilized as early as 1914: Raymond Duchamp-Villon worked as an assistant medical officer in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, while Jacques Villon enlisted in the army corps. In a letter written to Walter Pach on 19 January 1915, Duchamp admits that he is not at all displeased to have been discharged from military service: 'I went through the medical board and am doomed to remain a civilian for the entire duration of the war. They said I was too sick to be a soldier. I am not too unhappy about this decision, as you'll well imagine'.

At this point we should consider the meaning of the tonsure itself, which in its traditional function, marks one of the bodily signs that accompany the novice's entrance into the Catholic priesthood. At the beginning of the twentieth century, canonical ritual required the cutting of five locks of hair as well as the shaving of the tonsure itself, a detail possibly alluded to in the five points of Duchamp's star. The tonsure symbolically represents the rite of passage whereby the novice, who aspires to the higher levels of the church hierarchy, makes an offering of his hair as a sign of his ritual devotion. Nuns, too, sacrifice their hair at the moment they take their final vows, but this involves no distinctive marking of the head or hair. According to the Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique, the tonsure is an exclusively masculine prerogative: 'the tonsure can only be, conferred upon OXFORD ART JOURNAL 30.2 2007 295</page><page sequence="6">Giovanna Zapperi a subject wishing to become a priest and who has been already deemed worthy of the priesthood'.16 Needless to say, Christianity explicitly forbids women to accede to the status of the priesthood, exclusively reserved for men. The tonsure represents the first step of the young candidate as he receives a mark that publicly signals the idea of a sacrificial offering in the service of his vocation. Nevertheless, access to the rank of future priest includes a series of privileges that compensate for its numerous renunciations (e.g., vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, etc.). Among the traditional benefits of joining holy orders in Catholic France was the exemption from military service. All of this provides ample reason to consider Duchamp's Tonsure in relation to his avoidance of both military service and flight from countries involved in military conflict. Equally suggestive is Duchamp's antipathy to all forms of nationalist triumphalism, patriotism and aggressive and macho virility. Considered from this broader perspective, Tonsure may be read as the missing link in Duchamp's series of successive feminine transformations. The religious tonsure can be said effectively to represent a rite of passage that marks, among other things, the renunciation of a young cleric's sexuality in order to accede to the spiritual authority and sacred power vested in the priesthood. Access to the ecclesiastical hierarchy signifies, as the Dictionnaire de thdologie catholique emphasises, 'a renunciation, a stripping, which is already a form of consecration'. 18 In submitting to the tonsure, the young man declares his death to the world and his birth into a new life. Thomas Aquinas in fact further specified that the cutting of the hair is intended to remind the young cleric that he must not be distracted by earthly concerns and must consecrate himself to the quest for spiritual perfection.19 The spiritual perfection of the young cleric expresses itself precisely in his repudiation of sexuality, an important aspect of the anti-sexual politics of Christianity. Acts of renunciation in early Christianity occasionally took the extreme form of self-castration, based on a literal reading of the early Church fathers, thus suggesting that the tonsure itself represents a symbolic castration.20 Such practices of self-castration were perhaps inspired by a passage in the Gospel according to Saint Mathew in which Jesus declares: 'For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it let him receive it'.21 If the imposition of a regime of absolute chastity can be said to represent a major sacrifice, the church compensates for this obligatory renunciation of earthly pleasures by offering power. The tonsure thus represents a somewhat paradoxical renunciation of virility, insofar as it also re-establishes another form of masculine power, namely that which is conferred by the power of the priesthood. As God's representative on earth, the priest or the monk is thus invested with a specific type of masculine authority, although this masculinity is difficult to define and is, as we have seen, nominally desexualised. In the few years preceding Duchamp's Tonsure, Freud had already begun developing his theories on the role of symbolic castration as they are experienced phantasmatically in the psycho-sexual development of human (i.e., male) sexuality and socialisation. For the child, wrote Freud, castration anxiety results from the male child's recognition of both gender 16.

Even though in certain cases priests were conscripted, their conditions were privileged in relation to other draftees.

Such practices must have been widespread during the first centuries of Christianity if, at the Nicean Council of 325, the first canon is devoted precisely to this question: all those who incite followers to self-castration are to be excluded from the priesthood.

Accordingly, his perception of the absence of this organ on the female body produces considerable anxiety. In Freud's formulation, when the little boy discovers the mother's 'lack' of a penis, his first reaction consists of a denial, followed by an equally phantasmatic belief that the woman has been castrated. Such a possibility implies that he too could be deprived of this organ, one that is already a source of pleasure and narcissistic investment. It goes without saying that Freud privileges masculinity in his model of psychosexual subject formation, assuming the equivalence between the absence of the penis and femininity: At the stage of the pre-genital, sadistic-anal organization, there is as yet no question of male and female; the antithesis between active and passive is the dominant one. At the following stage of infantile genital organization, which we now know about, maleness exists, but not femaleness. The antithesis here is between having a male genital and being castrated. It is not until the development has reached its completion at puberty that the sexual polarity coincides with male and female. Maleness combines [the factors] of subject, activity and possession of the penis; femaleness takes over [those of] object and passivity.24 Considered in the light of this Freudian perspective, the renunciation of virility, in the case of the priest's disavowal of sexuality, raises the question of what masculinity would look like outside of phallic desire, with the attendant risk of feminisation. The Freudian model, given its theoretical emphasis on castration, has the merit of making evident the fact that femininity has long been historically associated with the absence of the penis. As we have seen, castration has played an implicitly central role in the unconscious of Christianity, especially in terms of how it 'thinks' and marginalises femininity. In his analysis of the Christian concept of the Trinity, Ernest Jones has noticed a surprising absence of female elements: there is a father and a son, but the mother has been replaced by the Holy Ghost. Accordingly, in this exclusively masculine construction - Christianity itself - it is the priests who bear the traces of a femininity that is otherwise denied: 'Then the effeminate costume of the priests, their compulsory celibacy, shaven head, and so on, plainly signify deprivation of masculine attributes, being thus equivalent to a symbolic self-castration'.25 The feminine traces that re-emerge in the figure of the priest remind us of what Jones designates as an 'androgynic compromise', a notable consequence of the vow of chastity.26 This feminisation is, for Jones, the price that Christianity pays for the exclusively masculine power of the Trinity. By abandoning several key aspects of 'normative masculinity', the Church secures not only the definitive exclusion of women but also the masculine appropriation of procreation. The exclusion of women from the priesthood is therefore the most visible aspect of the symbolic construction in which the male priest renounces his virility through the acceptance of (certain) feminine attributes. For example, from the point of view of ecclesiastical clothing, clerics appear to transgress the boundaries between feminine and masculine dress. Although it is difficult to generalise about religious attire and accessories, each order adhering to its own formally codified rules, what is significant is that they escape the normative categories of masculine and feminine clothing. Depending on rank and order, priestly vestments may include jewellery, sumptuous fabrics, and long robes.27 These are, accordingly, the 22.

'There is an interesting contrast between the behaviour of the two sexes. In the analogous situation, when a little boy first catches sight of a girl's genital region, he begins by showing irresolution and lack of interest; he sees nothing or disavows what he has seen, he softens it down or looks about for expedients for bringing it into line with his expectations. It is not until later, when some threat of castration has obtained a hold upon him, the observation becomes important to him: if he them recollects or repeats it, it arouses a terrible storm of emotion in him and forces him to believe in the reality of the threat which he has hitherto laughed at'.

In Tonsure, Duchamp makes a clear allusion to this 'other' masculinity, which although nominally asexual or nonsexual, remains, like the priesthood itself, a masculine prerogative. Tonsure is in fact an ambivalent representation of the artist's masculinity, for if on the one hand his virility is tied to symbolic castration, on the other hand this 'renunciation' elevates the artist to the position of spiritual guide and intellectual and artistic authority. The comet image, with its elongated tail, can also be considered in this light. In The complete works of Marcel Duchamp, Arturo Schwarz has connected Tonsure to a note written by Duchamp in 1912 during a trip he took to the Jura Mountains in the company of Guillaume Apollinaire, Francis Picabia and Gabrielle Buffet. In this note, the metaphor of the 'enfant-phare', identified with the image of a comet, illuminates the route from the Jura to Paris: This headlight child could, graphically, be a comet, which would have its tail in front, this tail being an appendage of the headlight child appendage which absorbs by crushing (gold dust, graphically) this Jura-Paris road.28 The 'headlight child' that illuminates the road and evokes the lights of cars in the countryside lends new significance to Tonsure. The religious connotation of the title suggests Duchamp's metamorphosis into a kind of cult-object, this comet which, in the Biblical narrative, guides the three kings down the path towards Christ's birthplace. The image of the comet whose 'tail' is 'in front' clearly functions, in the original text, as a sexual pun ('queue' in French signifying both 'tail' and 'penis'), thereby bringing the cosmic image of the 'headlight child' back to Duchamp's central problematic of eroticism. Insofar as Duchamp always maintained a certain distance from the religion in which he was raised, his use of such a Christian image must be understood as part of his general artistic project and as a response to certain questions that were occupying him at the time. The Virility of the Painter The religious dimension evoked by Tonsure needs also to be considered in connection with those artistic transformations introduced by Duchamp in the process of constructing his identity as an artist. With the introduction of the readymades in 1913, he had in effect renounced painting, turning instead to objects fabricated according to industrial modes of production. In the wake of this abandonment, Duchamp sought an alternativee model for the role of the artist. Having deprived himself of the traditional object of artistic creation - the painted canvas - he appears to have rejected the painter's virile masculinity in order to take on an alternate masculine role - that of desexualised spiritual guide. In abandoning painting, Duchamp thus rejected the traditional role of the artist and equally repudiated the topos of the artist as demiurge, a topos that has dominated the Western tradition for four centuries. In his interviews with Pierre Cabanne, he declares his contempt for this mythic construction of the artist: But I shy away from the word 'creation'. In the ordinary, social meaning of the word - well, it's very nice but, fundamentally, I don't believe in the creative function of the artist. He's a man like any other.29 28.

His major work of this period, the Large Glass, begun in 1915 and left unfinished in 1923, is in this respect emblematic: it is a work obsessed by the impossible sexual encounter between the bachelors and the bride. Duchamp's goal, however, would not have been to stage an encounter with sexual difference, since he had already implicitly renounced this symbolic opposition by his abandonment of painting. However, if the priest renounces sexuality in favour of a vocation, for what does Duchamp renounce painting? In turning his back on the phallic role of artist, master or demigod, Duchamp found himself necessarily confronted with the question of what other available subject-position he might adopt. Seven years earlier, Duchamp had become interested in erotic themes, and it was then that he produced Virgin, Bride and The Passage from virgin to bride. These three works can be also said to describe Duchamp's passage through painting while dealing with the difficulties of artistic creation in the age of industrial production, difficulties that would remain at the heart of his unfinished Large Glass.30 In his study devoted to Duchamp's relationship with painting, Thierry De Duve has argued that the erotic relationship of the artist with his canvas lies at the heart of Duchamp's interrogations of this period. 'The practice of painting has something to do with sublimation', writes De Duve, 'what it invests in can be named, for the male heterosexual painter, a desire for the woman; somewhere in the painter's economy of desire there is a woman to paint or a woman who has been painted'.31 Duchamp's renunciation of painting clearly indicates that for him the equation of woman and painting had reached a point of crisis. This crisis was as much broadly cultural as it was individual. Significantly, painterly production, no less than statements and written commentary by individual painters during this period, often reveal an aggressive attitude towards 'woman'. It must of course be emphasised that the notion of 'woman' refers here not to actual women but to an abstract concept, as in Griselda Pollock's important distinction between 'images of women' and woman as image'.32 The aggressive tone of these artistic statements further illuminates the phallic nature of the painterly act, allied as it is to notions of conquest, possession and mastery. The idea of painting as an erotic relationship between a dominating male presence and a feminised canvas is exemplified by Wassily Kandinsky's remarks in Riickblick, published in 1913. In this excerpt he forcefully affirms the necessity of the artist's erotic struggle with the canvas, here rendered equivalent to the body of the woman that must be possessed: I learned to struggle with the canvas, to recognize it as an entity opposed to my wishes (=dreams), and to force it to submit to these wishes. At first, it stands there like a pure, chaste maiden, with clear gaze and heavenly joy - this pure canvas that is itself as beautiful as a picture. And then comes the imperious brush, conquering it gradually, first here, then there, employing all its native energy, like a European colonist who with axe, spade, hammer, saw penetrates the virgin jungle where no human foot has trod, bending it to conform to his will.33 In this passage, characterised by attitudes inflected equally by misogyny and colonialism, Kandinsky describes the function of femininity in pictorial creation with an aggressiveness that signals his desire to liberate painting from the encumbering presence of the female body. In a certain respect, 30. See David Joselit, Infinite Regress: Marcel Duchamp 1910-1941 (Cambridge, MA, 1998), pp. 111-56. 31. Thierry De Duve, Pictorial Nominalism.

By refusing to paint, Duchamp establishes a new formulation of the artist's masculinity based on the renunciation of the erotic confrontation so explicitly described by Kandinsky. Duchamp is, in effect, the first of his generation to have taken up work after the loss of this traditional object of creation, that is to say, the act of painting itself. The passage from painting to readymade therefore marks the disappearance not only of the implicit equation of painting and femininity, but also the idea of the male artist for whom the canvas is a site, even an arena of desire. Accordingly, in Duchamp's artistic trajectory in the period 1913 to 1920, the manufactured object, untouched by the artist's hand, replaces painting. The sexual division of labour thematised in the painterly act signifies at this historical moment the problem of the relationship between the artist and the object of his creation, just as the relationship between the subject of the gaze to its object is figured metaphorically as one of erotic domination.34 The crisis of the (metaphorically female) pictorial object represents, reciprocally, a crisis of the artist's (metaphorically masculine) creativity. According to this conceptualisation, woman is symbolic of an entire aesthetic problematic: she represents both the object of creation and also incarnates the image as such. In Search of Another Masculinity If the tonsure can be read as a kind of symbolic castration, it therefore manifests certain parallels with the renunciation of the painterly act, an act which, as we have seen, is analogous to phallic mastery and domination. In the case of the young artist Duchamp, the adoption of the tonsure at the precise moment in which he repudiated this position of artistic mastery functions as a kind of emblem of this renunciative act. Tonsure thus stages a possible position for the artist who has renounced the body of the woman in painting. However, as David Joselit has observed, abandoning painting by no means signifies a lack of interest in the body. On the contrary, the readymades make frequent allusion to the body not only in the choice of objects but also in the titles given to them.35 With the introduction of the readymades, Duchamp displaces his interest in the bodily from the material or sensual qualities of his painting to a more intellectual or conceptual approach. In advance of the broken arm, a snow shovel purchased in New York in 1915, signals this passage. The title refers to the impossibility of doing something with one's own hand; in other words, the impossibility of painting itself, underlining the physical aspect of the painterly act. This readymade announces the imminent abandonment of painting but opens up a field of possibilities for the artist deprived of his creative arm. If Duchamp's strategy in face of this crisis in painting retrospectively appears to have been the most radical of his generation, it is because he was able to incorporate into his artistic practice the very objects that rendered painting obsolete. The chronological proximity between the series of paintings that mark the end of his activity as a painter and the introduction of the first readymade is, from this point of view, revelatory. Parallel to the readymades, it would seem that Duchamp was also attempting to conceive of another role for the artist after the end of 34. These questions are amply developed in Silvia Eiblmayr's study, where the status of the image of woman in painting is discussed throughout the course of the twentieth century. Silvia Eiblmayr, Die Frau als Bild (Berlin, 1993). 35. 'Duchamp did not abandon the body - and particularly the feminine body - when he abandoned the nude in painting.... Indeed Duchamp's readymades of this period, from In advance of the broken arm and Fountain to Pull at 4 Pins and Traveller's Folding Item, are haunted by a vestigial anthropomorphism, a metaphorical and often literal dispersal or dismemberment of the body'.

Duchamp's photographs of himself in drag as Rrose Silavy testify to this search for a new role for the artist and make clear - if ever such a demonstration were necessary - that erotic themes did not disappear from Duchamp's activity following his abandonment of painting. Already in Tonsure, Duchamp alludes to another form of masculinity that is not sexual but nevertheless decisively gendered. This desexualised masculinity recalls his renunciation of painting, which, as we have seen, was also a renunciation of the erotic relationship between the painter and the canvas. Tonsure is thus an ambivalent representation of the artist's masculinity, for if, on the one hand, the latter is defined by symbolic castration and a loss of virility, on the other hand, it succeeds in elevating the artist to the authoritative position of spiritual guide. The allusion to Christ contained in the image of the comet suggests that the artist is the one who must be followed, who leads (the avant-gardist) or who reveals the true path. Nevertheless, the (rather tempting) possibility of reading the image of the star as a verbal pun on the artist's celebrity permits us to consider the ritual allusion in light of a more contemporary form of cult. The comet inscribed on the artist's skull suggests a hidden play on words that alludes to the ostensible appropriation of the 'star' image in the persona of Rrose Selavy.36 Duchamp's idea of presenting himself as a cult object is probably linked to his flirtation with the role of celebrity during his stay in New York, where he was received as a veritable art star. His Nude Descending a Staircase had made him the most visible artist among recent emigres.3 Through the course of his years spent in the United States, his renown only increased, a testament to the exceptional charisma with which he was invested. According to Henri-Pierre Roche, Duchamp's long-time companion, he was something of a cult figure in New York cafe society and other sophisticated milieus: When I met Marcel Duchamp in New York in 1916, at the age of 29, he appeared to me as if surrounded by a halo - which he has always kept for me. Of what was it made? Of limpidity, facility, rapidity, lack of self-interest, openness to all that was potentially new, spontaneity, and audaciousness. His presence was a kind of grace, a gift, a fact of which he was unaware even though surrounded by a growing crowd of disciples. He was there, young, alert, inspired. ... He was becoming a legend, like a young prophet who writes hardly anything but whose words are repeated in every mouth. And the anecdotes of his life become miracles ... many hour-long meetings won him followers for life.38 Roche's reminiscences of Duchamp's New York reception illustrate how a displaced form of religiosity is inextricable from a bourgeoning mass culture. The image of Duchamp 'surrounded by a crowd of disciples' evokes the authority of the 'special' and obviously charismatic individual before an audience, and recalls that of the prophet before his followers. The comet shaved on his head in Tonsure, with its allusion to the role of spiritual guide, evokes, in a certain manner, the aura that Duchamp evidently emanated amidst New York's high society. At the same time, Rochb's account points to the desire that Duchamp aroused in his contemporaries. This attraction was based on Duchamp's characteristically detached, insouciant and indifferent manner, which generated a certain mystery and seductiveness.39 In this respect, Duchamp's self-exhibition in the photographic image might also draw its inspiration from the nineteenth-century tradition of dandyism: by reproducing, in his own person, the attitude of the dandy, he staged his own subjectivity as an artificial - aesthetic - construction. This strategy has the effect of privileging exteriority, thereby maintaining an aura of mystery 36. This photograph is not the only instance where Duchamp used the star shape to play with conventional meaning. Although not related to questions of gender performance specifically, Duchamp used the star in his 'The' (November 1915) as part of a language game in which referential meaning is made opaque through the substitution of the definite article 'the' by a star shape.

His charm was thus in separable from his characteristic indifference, as well as his staging of his own personality before an audience, which, as Gabrielle Buffet recalls in her memoirs, was constituted not only by would-be artists, but also by young women: We had found Marcel Duchamp perfectly adapted to the violent rhythm of New York. He was the hero of the artists and intellectuals, and of the young ladies who frequented these circles. Leaving his almost monastic isolation, he flung himself into orgies of drunkenness and every other excess. But in a life of licence as of asceticism, he preserved his consciousness of purpose: extravagant as his gestures sometimes seemed, they were perfectly adequate to his experimental study of a personality disengaged from the normal contingencies of human life.41 This account makes evident the characteristic coexistence, in Duchamp's persona, of a penchant for asceticism with a highly seductive personality. This persona, further marked by what Gabrielle Buffet calls 'his contempt for all values',42 further inspired a great deal of curiosity among his acolytes. The intersection of an apparent asceticism (incarnated in the photograph of the tonsure), in tandem with the magnetic attraction he emanated, parallels the thematic relationship between Tonsure and Duchamp's successive self-refashioning as Rrose Sdlavy. In this sense, the tension between self-effacement and celebrity parallels the ambivalence between the desexualised masculinity of the priest and a feminised position that is both eroticised and desirable. In recognising these mechanisms of 'stardom' and in the context of his own ambivalence about traditional masculine roles, Duchamp could invent for himself an alternative identity. Rrose Selavy, as alter ego, is thus partly parodic, but also critical, permitting Duchamp to situate himself 'outside' normative concepts of the phallic, mastering male artist, but equally cognizant of femininity as fantasy, spectacle and commodity. The multiple meanings of Tonsure thus alternate between gender ambivalence (i.e. the priest is not a sexual man but is nonetheless a man of power and authority) and social position (the artist as star) and the artist as prophet or spiritual guide (e.g. he incarnates the phare - the comet which one follows). This complex process of self-representation demonstrates how even in the act of dismantling a conventional and patriarchal concept of the artist (a concept with a legacy as long as Western civilisation) even in the embrace of an other gendered identity, the power and privilege of the male artist can be reconstructed, however ambivalently. The Secular Cult of the Artist Significantly, the conception of the artist as spiritual guide that emerges in this Tonsure reappears, although in a different form, in Duchamp's pronouncements in the decade from 1950 to 1960. During this period, Duchamp returned to the link between art and religion, only this time in a much less ambivalent manner. In The Creative Act, he affirms that the artist's role is that of the medium: 'To all appearances, the artist acts like a mediumistic being who, from the labyrinth beyond time and space, seeks his way out to a clearing' 43 'If we give the attributes of a medium to the 40.

Duchamp here clearly suggests that the work of art surpasses the artist's most conscious intentions and that, moreover, its true conceptual value is expressed entirely in relation to the spectator's act of reception. The act of viewing completes the creative act. This consideration stands opposed to the idea of art as a form of exteriorisation of the artist's intentions; the work of art is defined, instead, as a dynamic relationship between spectator and work in which the artist plays the role of mediator. The cultural climate of the post-war period probably led Duchamp to support vigorously the idea that artistic creation is essentially a 'spiritual' act, a term Duchamp considered more in its intellectual, rather than strictly spiritual or religious, aspects. He emphasised that this conception of the artist's function was, in large part, a response to a specific historical situation, the post-war period, which he considered to be dominated by 'a brutal materialism where everything is valued only with respect to material well being; where religion, after having lost much of its ground, is no longer the great source of spiritual values'. 45 This once religious function, now appropriated by art, and the role of the artist accordingly transformed into that of the of the secular priest: 'The life of an artist is like the life of a monk, a lewd monk if you like, very Rabelaisian. It is an ordination' .46 The allusion to Christianity contained in Tonsure consequently allies the photograph to this late reflection on the spiritual nature of art and the attendant role of the artist. If at that time Duchamp appears to have been searching for a way to continue being an artist after the end of painting, in 1960 he seems to have found a solution in the para-religious metaphor of the artist as mediator. This evolution in the Duchampian conception of the artist makes apparent the importance that he accorded to artmaking and to the role of the artist in society. Far from being simply the transgressive or iconoclastic artist that has so often been described in the literature, Duchamp never stopped reflecting on the artist's obligation within a society profoundly transformed by industrial capitalism and mass consumption. In seeking to manufacture 'another' redeemed masculinity, we can observe the complex process by which his artistic identity was variously cast and recast through strategies of destruction and reconstruction. Tonsure is thus a palimpsest upon which the traces of these successive (and sometimes simultaneous) identities, both artistic and gendered, are variously inscribed.
