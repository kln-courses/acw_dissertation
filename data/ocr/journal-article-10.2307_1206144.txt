<plain_text><page sequence="1">ADLER, RACHEL. Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1998. xxviii+269 pp. $34.95 (cloth). There is no question Rachel Adler has produced a "watershed book," as Elliot Dorff espouses on the dust jacket of Engendering Judaism. This book is a seminal piece of Jewish feminist theological writing in part because Adler maintains from the outset that feminist issues are not merely women's issues. She calls for Jews of both sexes to reshape and "engender" a Judaism that reflects our period in his- tory-a period marked by equality for women. Further, Adler focuses her work in a uniquely Jewish way, addressing the various pieces of the Jewish framework and rereading them through a feminist theological hermeneutic. Her book is divided into chapters on story, halakhah, liturgy, and sexuality and relationship within Judaism. She then concludes by weaving her vision of these elements into the construction of a new marriage ceremony and partnership contract. Adler begins her task by reviewing in her introduction the historical context of Jewish feminist theology. She cites and explains the salient points of each writer in turn, including her own early writings. Provocatively titled "Prelude: The Female Rapist and Other Inversions," the first chapter concerns Jewish story and the "de/ facing" of women. Adler forthrightly assumes the role of reinterpreter of some of 685</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion Judaism's most outrageously antifemale stories from rabbinic tradition. By intro- ducing modern psychological language into her interpretation, Adler seeks to find the "hidden springs of laughter that well up once we are willing to relinquish the suffocating security of the dominator or the smoldering grudge of the victim" (p. 19). In essence, she wants to reframe these stories as "holy comedy." Unfortu- nately, while her reinterpretations are insightful and some even ingenious, she leaves off her practice of re-storytelling and abruptly switches to halakhah-never quite explaining what she intends for us to do with this information. In her section on halakhah, Adler asserts, "the progressive branches ofJudaism have hardly begun to reflect and to address the questions, understandings, and obligations" (p. 24) of Jewish men and women. Because classical halakhah cannot be "fixed" by liberal halakhists and in order to create true "communal praxis," Adler cites the need for a new halakhah. Some of her argument seems unproven, and many of her citations reflect only Reform or Orthodox positions without any mention of the Conservative movement. Like others, she appropriately turns to Robert Cover and his discussions on nomos to integrate the "stories, dreams and revelations of Jewish women and men" (p. 35). Early in her discussion of liturgy, Adler claims that early Reform Judaism con- sidered women as "honorary men" (pp. 62-63). By reiterating this point through- out the book, Adler highlights her less-than-scrupulous attention to history and her own outlook on the Reform movement. However, she recognizes the necessity for Jews to know Hebrew to access their historical and lyrical roots while acknowl- edging that Hebrew, as a gendered language, cannot provide us with neutral God images. She both admires Marcia Falk for creating new prayers and rejects Falk's desire to rid God of anthropomorphic qualities. She also rejects Tikva Frymer- Kensky's "morphing" image of God as she does not believe it will "prevent the incursion of totalizing metaphors that reinforce particular theologies and exclude others" (p. 88). Is not the point of constructive theology to reinforce particular theologies and exclude others? It would seem necessary for feminism to exclude any theology that subjugated women. After rejecting the current appellations for God, Adler requests new words for liturgy but fails to supply them. The chapter on marriage and divorce sets forth Adler's answer for ridding Judaism of the concept of kinyan (acquisition of the bride by the groom). She suggests bride and groom create a new ceremony in which they place prized pos- sessions in a bag and hold it up together as was done in ancient partnership agreements and rituals. Her goal is to expunge from Jewish law and practice the ritual of men acquiring women. In this instance, as with the b'rit ahuvim (lovers' covenant) that will supplant the ketubbah (marriage contract), Adler reinterprets halakhah and ritual practice to create a wedding and marriage in which women are partners. She attains this goal but fails, I think, in her attempt to rid Judaism of another vestige of patriarchy: the get (halakhic divorce). Adler's claim, that we should abolish the get because many Jews do not obtain one or that without kid- dushin (sanctification) no get is necessary, is merely an opinion with which most Orthodox and many liberal Jews do not agree. Although some of her goals are unattained and some ideas are misdirected, this book is refreshing. Many of Adler's points are new and courageous. She is adept at Talmud and steeped in Jewish lore. Her passion for equality for women in Judaism, the light of her message, continues to shine. Many of us will find ideas with which we do not agree, but that does not detract from the importance of this work. DEBORAH GREEN, Chicago, Illinois. 686</page></plain_text>
