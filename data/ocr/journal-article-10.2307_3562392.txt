(See the Special Supplement, "Animals, Science, and Ethics," Hastings Cen- terReport, May-June 1990.) It is the first major research report under the Center's new Ethics and En- vironment Program, which aims to explore ways of systematically articulating and coordinating ethical responsibilities and obliga- tions to humans, animals, and na- ture. This task is increasingly be- coming an urgent theoretical and practical issue for applied ethics and thus for The Hastings Center. An examination of recent devel- opments in animal biotechnology raises fundamental philosophic and ethical problems that we will need to confront in this wider task. This Special Supplement is a first concerted effort at addressing these problems. By necessity the animal biotech- nology project was speculative in character. We were forced on oc- casion to traverse relatively un- known philosophic and ethical territory. The results of more than two years of deliberation remain exploratory and open-ended, and the project's core participants have variously contributed in ways not easy to acknowledge. The project members themselves want to thank individuals invited to specific project meetings: Kath- leen Courrier, Rebecca Dresser, Dieter Hessel, Sheldon Krimsky, Marc Lappe,Jamie MacLeod, and Barbara Noske. This supplement is also greatly indebted to the European participants of a spe- cial meeting held in Amsterdam in March of 1992, entitled "Phi- losophies of Nature and Animal Biotechnology." The participants were Wouter Achterberg, Tjard de Cock Buning, Alan Holland, Soemini Kasanmentalib, Petran Kockelkoren, Mary Midgley, Zdenek Neubauer, Michael Rist, Frans Soontiens, Douwe Tiemer- sma, Jiri Vacha, and Henk Ver- hoog. Finally, The Hastings Cen- ter and project participants want to express their deep apprecia- tion to the Marilyn J. Simpson Charitable Trust, the 1983 Gay- lord Donnelley Trust, and an anonymous donor for their sup- port, moral and financial, of this project and the Center's new ven- ture in applied ethics. S2</page><page sequence="3">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 Exploring Ethical Landscapes Oncomouse, BST cows, Beltsville pigs, and transgenic fish, among other bioengineered "exotics," have recently appeared on the horizon of practical ethics, with more to come. Biotechnology and transgenic ani- mals in particular, which involve the introduction of foreign genetic mate- rial (usually from another species) into more standard reproductive processes, offer a challenging oppor- tunity for reconsidering crucial and perplexing ethical issues that sur- round our human uses of animal life and our relation to wider animate na- ture. When ethically grappling with most practical issues, we inveterately ignore the natural settings and ecosystems of which we are integrally a part and in which our human exist- ence is inextricably embedded. And despite the efforts of philosophically minded animal rightists, when seri- ously considering our ethical duties to animals we usually consider only individual animal welfare or ex- periential well-being, particularly pain and suffering, and not the broader significance of animal and animate life per se. But the new ani- mal biotechnologies do not so easily let us off the hook. Their practical implications go decidedly beyond the more familiar ethical issues of in- dividual welfare and well-being. Cer- tain new biotechniques delve deeply into and manipulate the very charac- ter of animal and animate being. These new technologies have the potential to alter nature radically. Are these manipulations and alterations ethically legitimate? Do we have the moral right to undertake such inter- ventions? If so, in what contexts, under what conditions, and within what limits? These are not only or primarily wel- fare issues. The ethical challenges of animal biotechnology more elusively point to living nature and 'organic being' as such and the meaning that life, including human life, holds for us. The practices raise questions about ultimate values. The ethical is- sues touch upon respect (not only compassion), goodness (not only happiness), and violation (not only subjectively experienced harm). Moreover, biotechnological manipu- lations threaten to reach into the fun- damental character of animal species that have arisen in historically deep evolutionary and ecological contexts. Nature and the various values that evolutionary and ecological contexts have for us are implicated. Does ani- mal biotechnology in general or in its specific instances constitute an ethi- cally appropriate human relation to nature? Are these the ways we ought to fit into the animate world? These pressing questions naturally and legitimately surface with the ad- vent of recent biotechnological developments. But they are not easily or straightforwardly settled. Animal biotechnology exists within the be- wilderingly complex fabric of human communities and as part of the wider cultural and historical theme of human interventions into nature and animal life. Arguably the full range of humans' interactions with nature constitutes the most appropriate con- text for raising final ethical concerns: What should be the ethically self-im- posed limits, if any, to our interven- tions into nature, for what reasons, in service of what moral values? From this perspective, does biotechnology, animal and other, have specific fea- tures that mark it out for special ethi- cal attention? Does the scope, scale, and depth of the new interventions into life processes constitute a signifi- cant ethical novum? Moreover, and equally important, when ethically considering biotechnological prac- tices, should we be guided by a single moral reason and ultimate value, or are we rather obligated to respond to a plurality of reasons and ultimate values, underived from one another and not easily coordinated? This fundamental theme of mon- ism and pluralism is crucial to under- standing the force and limits of the various arguments that are charac- teristically brought to bear on bio- technology's practices, for and against.' In our everyday experience of the world, we characteristically en- counter many, perhaps innumerable spheres of human activity, all com- prehended within wider human com- munities. Each sphere is centrally animated by its own specific human We need to attend to particular contexts of animal biotechnological intervention and satisfy plural moral concerns, some more pressing than others. purposes and motivations, its own overarching perspectives on the world, and its own dominant ethical values and aspirations. The various forms of animal biotechnology are implicated in these several areas of activity in different ways, sometimes integral to their practical purposes and mores, sometimes a challenge to their animating vision and dominant values. This varied implication of bio- technology in different contexts un- dergirds the passions of its boosters and critics alike. Moreover, since we all participate directly in several spheres of human activity, differing moral attitudes can conflict within us individually. With varying emphases we can be both for and against animal biotechnology, for different moral reasons and according to different world visions. This is the ethical and practical public policy terrain through which we must make our way. The particular philosophic and ethical challenges that this plural, complex, and internally conflicted ethical landscape poses are the ex- plicit focus of Section 2. But we can here gain a brief overview of the thrust and scope of the overall prob- lem. Consider the characteristically human spheres of economic activity, public political life, health care and medicine, scientific and biomedical research, domestic and family life, recreation and play, cultural and re- ligious practices and traditions, and more. Consider the various values an- imating these several domains of ac- tivity: compassionate response to human (and animal) welfare and creaturely needs; ongoing commit- ments to opportunities for individual and community life; fundamental ob- S3</page><page sequence="4">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 ligations to respect individual per- sons; respect for social justice; deep allegiances to aesthetic, religious, and ethical values and norms of cultural traditions and natural landscapes; pressing concern for the world's human community and the global biosphere, now and into the indefi- nite future. Here are familiar, every- day multiple values and ethical ob- ligations. We encounter an undenia- ble plurality of moral goods. Now consider traditional human uses of animals and their new bio- technological extensions. Since time immemorial we have domesticated and selectively bred animals for food, clothing, animal companions, and sport. Now we have growth-hormone- boosted, super milk-producing cows; the leaner, faster-growing, but ar- thritis-ridden Beltsville pig, also charged with added growth hor- mones; and the possibility of fish en- gineered to grow faster, fight harder, or resist cold and pollution better. Since the advent of modern science and biomedicine, animals have been used in research, education, toxicity testing, and the production of ther- apeutic pharmaceutical agents. Now we have Oncomouse, Cystic Fibrosis mouse, and Memory mouse fash- ioned to chart basic biological pro- cesses or the course of significant human diseases, to aid in the dis- covery of practical medical thera- pies, and to test for suspected car- cinogens. We have mice, goats, and sheep bioengineered to produce human insulin or other biologically active products in their milk. Is there a morally significant difference be- tween the new and the old practices? Which practices, new or old, are ethi- cally legitimate? To grapple effectively with these questions requires paying close atten- tion to the various spheres of human activity, the many values and obliga- tions involved, and the differing in- terventions into animal life. We need to attend to particular contexts of an- imal biotechnological intervention and satisfy plural moral concerns, some more pressing than others. Within these contexts we require a moral coordination of disparate and perhaps conflicting obligations. This involves attending to contextual plu- ral obligations settled by judgments involving a decisionmaking art of "moral ecology" that weighs the various moral claims vis-it-vis one another. In short, there invariably are moral claims of welfare, respect,justice, and the human and natural good at play in particular situations of animal bio- technological practice, but the fabric or constellation of these claims may significantly shift from context to context. What might be ethically per- missible in the biomedical laboratory might be prohibited on farms, in the market place, or in the wild. But in each context all things morally rele- vant need explicitly to be considered and given their due. Because the various spheres of human activity are not hermetically sealed off from one another, either in human communi- ties or within the lives of individuals, there is always the temptation to poach from outside the context at hand and to establish the hegemony of one ultimate ethical value over the plural others, whether the value be human or animal welfare, respect, justice, environmental protection, or the cultural or natural good. Animal biotechnological practices, as with all interventions into animal life, involve moral concerns for humans and ani- mals, if not also wider nature, and for various aspects of welfare, respect, justice, and the good. It must be an overall aim of moral thinking and ac- tion to keep this plural richness of values and ethical concerns alive, well, and judiciously coordinated. This Special Supplement is divided into three sections, according to three different perspectives on ani- mal and wider biotechnology: the scientific, the philosophical, and the regulatory. Each perspective throws its own particular light on the ethical issues raised by biotechnology and how these issues ought to be dealt with theoretically and practically. Each section in its own way empha- sizes the multiplicity of biotech- nological practices, the many human values and ethical obligations in- volved, and the careful systematic and contextually determined manner with which we must come to grips with new biotechnological powers. Biotechnology, animal and other, promises a great human good, realiz- able only if it is held in check within ethically determined limits. To deter- mine these limits is the new challenge for theoretical and practical ethics. -Strachan Donnelley 1. Transgenic Organisms, Science, and Society The definition of animal biotech- nology and its new biological prod- ucts is a complex and still controver- sial issue. A transgenic organism is one that carries and expresses genetic in- formation not normally found in that species of organism. This defini- tion is somewhat literal and thus re- strictive. Perhaps the term should be broadened to include the purposeful amplification, spread, or dissemina- tion of a gene within a species at a rate much faster than would have oc- curred in the absence of artificial in- terventions. This broadened defini- tion implies organisms that have been intentionally manipulated using modern biotechnological tech- niques to "design" both plants and animals with a desired set of novel ge- netic properties that in turn express novel phenotypes. Although organisms with bizarre and unusual phenotypes have been created for millennia through do- mestication and selective breeding, these traditional methods can only manipulate genetic capabilities al- ready present within the gene pool of an individual species. Modern bio- technological innovations allow crea- tion of organisms with genetic capa- bilities not normally found in that particular species. The novel genetic information may or may not cause in- jury to the recipient organisms. For example, strains of mice modified to produce human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and secrete it in their milk apparently are unaffected by this genetic alteration.2 On the other hand, early attempts to increase the meat yield of pigs by introducing ge- netic information for bovine growth hormone caused severe problems for the resulting animals.3 Transgenic organisms have great potential utility for humankind. S4</page><page sequence="5">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 These organisms can provide society with novel ways of generating new products and services of practical value. Transgenic plants and animals can be used either to produce, or are themselves, new commercial prod- ucts that are often unavailable, or less available, by other means. More im- portantly, the technological innova- tions used to develop transgenic or- ganisms allow researchers to design laboratory organisms that mimic or duplicate many human diseases such as cystic fibrosis, diabetes, AIDS, cancer, or sickle-cell anemia. Such an- imals become valuable models to fol- low the sequelae and treatment possi- bilities for these diseases. Thus trans- genic organisms provide exciting models to understand and perhaps to intervene in human disease pro- cesses. Ultimately this technology has potential for direct application to human beings. On the one hand, it holds out the promise of correcting debilitating genetic diseases. On the other hand, as our understanding of the interaction of genetics and human personality increases, the technology also has the potential radically to alter human nature. Despite the wondrous utility of transgenic organisms, from a biolo- gist's perspective their creation raises potentially troubling ethical ques- tions. One concern involves bridging "species barriers" and centers on the question, Are species real biological entities so inherent in the fabric of nature that we become morally culpable in breaking the barrier be- tween them? A second issue relates to the potential pain or suffering that we might cause to an animal under- going such manipulations. Are we morally permitted intentionally to create an organism that will ulti- mately suffer severe debilitation or experience great pain? A third ethi- cal concern involves the possible eco- logical damage or loss of species di- versity arising from intentional or unintentional release of transgenic organisms. How do we assure that these novel organisms do not unduly disrupt natural habitats and cause se- rious environmental damage? Fi- nally, the fact that this technology might fundamentally alter human nature raises significant ethical con- cerns. Can this knowledge be used wisely? Or will Chargaff's devil's doc- trine of "what can be done must be done" dominate the technology and inevitably lead to profound moral abuse?4 I cannot adequately respond to all of these issues here. Rather, I have a more restricted set of objectives. First, I will review some of the scien- tific dimensions and technical aspects of transgenic organisms. My goal is to demonstrate how the technology can work and why it is important. My focus will be on fairly narrow notions of molecular biology and biotech- nology. Second, I will address the question of what it means to be a member of a species, drawing on some of Ernst Mayr's ideas about the various meanings of the term. Third, I will ask whether there is anything really different about transgenic or- ganisms in comparison to organisms that have been highly modified by extensive selective breeding. Finally, I will review some of the ethical con- cerns, outlined above, that I see flow- ing from these various issues. In ex- ploring the latter topics, my intent is to supplement issues raised elsewhere in this volume and to establish one perspective that is central to address- ing a plurality of ethical obligations in different contexts of biotechno- logical practices. Technical Considerations and Applications Basic Technique. Weissman recently noted that for millennia viruses have naturally carried foreign DNA across species boundaries in a stable fash- ion.5 However, the notion of inten- tionally creating a transgenic or- ganism in a laboratory has its origin in the controversial recombinant DNA work of the 1960s. For example, Paul Berg's colleagues created one of the first transgenic organisms when in 1971 they used restriction enzymes and plasmid vectors to insert genetic elements from Simian Virus 40 into Escherichia coli.6 These early tech- niques were unidirectional, that is, they allowed the introduction of ge- netic material from any foreign source into bacterial (procaryotic) systems. Recent innovations in tech- nique now allow the manipulation of genetic information between vir- tually any plant or animal. An illustrative experimental proto- col is the creation of a mouse with a defective cystic fibrosis transmem- brane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene shown in schematic form in Fig- ure 1.7 This particular experiment, often referred to as a "knockout ex- periment," differs somewhat from more conventional transgenic ex- ELECTROPORATE .RECOMBINANT ISOLATE MUTATE GENE INTO CFTR GENE EMBRYONIC MOUSE INCORPORATE EMBRYONIC INTO VECTOR SGROW CELLS OUT IN TISSUE CULTURE po u eIMANT CELLS IMPLANT BLASTOCYST IMLNTOCUSE INTO MOUSSEITO YS CHIMERIC OFFSPRING RESULTANT MICE STRAINS BREED STRONG 6/9 (/) m+/+ Figure 1. Creation of a mouse with cystic fibrosis using typical transgenic techniques. S5</page><page sequence="6">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 periments. In a "knockout experi- ment," the genetic information manipulated is from the same spe- cies. Thus the resulting strain of mice, which exhibits many attributes simi- lar to human patients with cystic fi- brosis, is not truly transgenic in the narrow sense of that term. The murine (mouse) genetic information is rendered nonfunctional and then reintroduced back into mice. Despite this technical difference, the experi- ment clearly illustrates some of the fundamental methods used to create a true transgenic organism. (Simply envision substituting a nonmurine gene for the CFTR gene used in this illustration.) At this point, some background in- formation may be helpful. Cystic fi- brosis is a recessive, autosomal dis- order (that is, individuals must possess two copies of a defective gene for gene expression), which is carried on non-sex-linked chromosomes. The disease is inherited in classical Mendelian fashion and originates from abnormal function of epithelial cells in the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive tracts. The abnormal function of these cells arises from a defective chloride ion channel pro- tein called the cystic fibrosis trans- membrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The defective function of the chloride channel causes various secretory tissues (such as lung, pan- creas, intestine) in the body to accu- mulate a thick mucus. Pathological manifestations of CF arise from mucus accumulation in affected organ systems, such as lung infections and inadequate intestinal function. The specific causal relationship be- tween a defective CFTR gene and CF pathology has not been demon- strated. The human gene for CFTR has been identified and characterized. Although a number of mutations in this gene have been shown to be re- sponsible for CF symptoms, defects in a very small region of the gene are responsible for 70 percent of re- ported cases. Previous work has also demonstrated that mice contain a gene equivalent to the human CFTR gene. Thus creation of a strain of mice with defective CFTR genes seems to present a reasonable model to study CF in humans. Like the recombinant DNA technology that preceded them, transgenic organisms are probably unbounded in potential application. In this particular experiment, the CFTR gene in murine embryonic stem cells is inactivated by insertion of an antibiotic resistance gene. The inactivated gene is inserted into a plasmid vector and reintroduced into murine embryonic stem cells. Cell lines that take up and express the al- tered gene are injected into mouse blastocysts, which in turn are im- planted into pseudopregnant mice. Those offspring that are chimeric for the mutant CFTR gene (they can be identified by coat color) are inter- bred, thereby creating three distinct lines of mice. One line is homozygous to express the normal CFTR gene (+/+), and one line is homozygous to express the mutant CFTR gene (-/-). A third line is heterozygous (+/-) and expresses 50 percent of the normal gene and 50 percent of the mutant form.9 This experiment is significant be- cause the mice that are homozygous for the mutant CFTR gene exhibit many cystic fibrosis symptoms found in humans. These symptoms include a general failure to thrive, glandular alterations, and obstructions of glan- dular secretion ability. The CFTR (-/-) mice generally die from intestinal obstruction at a young age (before 40 days). The inescapable conclusion of the experiment is that CFTR (-/-) mice are an excellent model system to mimic cystic fibrosis in humans. In this brief sketch, I have ignored many potential technical complica- tions. Also, although there are other technical approaches to creating transgenic organisms, this experi- ment serves to illustrate the basic technological concepts. Fundamen- tally, however, the techniques are relatively easy to perform, and new innovations are constantly appear- ing.? Given the relative technical ease, what can this technology be used for? Like the recombinant DNA technology that preceded them, transgenic organisms are probably unbounded in potential application. Their importance mainly falls into three broad types of application: im- proving human health, developing commercial uses, and furthering ba- sic biological scientific knowledge. Applications for Improved Human Health. As illustrated above, trans- genic organisms can serve as valuable model systems of complex human diseases and thereby lead to allevia- tion of human suffering. The range of potential applications is wide and is illustrated by a few examples. Transgenic animals can provide models for the development and progression of many specific human diseases. Cystic fibrosis is a classical example of such a disease. Although the biological basis of the disease has been clear for some time, this under- standing did not clarify the pathologi- cal basis or progression mechanism of the disease. Consequently, it has been difficult to develop rational and effective therapies for the underlying disease. If the CF mouse truly mimics human CF, as is apparently the case, then it will be an important model for clarifying the disease etiology and facilitating rational therapies. We can follow, in a very immediate fashion, the sequelae of the disease process in ways that are impossible, or ethically unconscionable, in humans. Further- more, such model systems allow us to develop and explore potential treat- ment modalities that would also be impossible in humans. The list of ge- netic diseases that can be studied by this technology is considerable and accounts for a significant aspect of human suffering. The discovery of genetic elements responsible for colorectal cancer is a clear illustration that cancer is often caused by aberrant gene expression. Insertion into mice of genetic ele- ments believed to be responsible for oncogenesis provides a system to study expression of these genes in S6</page><page sequence="7">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 different tissues. Such studies would provide answers to questions about why oncogenes lead to tumor pro- duction in some tissues but not in others.'2 Ultimately, this technology prom- ises direct intervention into human genetic diseases by replacement of dysfunctional genes. Friedmann, for example, notes that several genet- ic diseases arising from bone marrow defects seem most amenable to gene therapy intervention. Bone marrow cells are readily susceptible to infec- tion by retroviruses, which as Varmus has noted are common ways of intro- ducing foreign genetic material into mammalian cells.14 Moreover, bone marrow cells can readily be removed from a patient, then altered and manipulated in vitro. The altered cells can be reintroduced into the patientwhere they will-it is hoped- proliferate and produce the cor- rected gene product. This attribute has great therapeutic value, for it re- duces the amount of foreign genetic material introduced into a patient, thus diminishing possible rejection by a recipient's immune system. Friedmann further suggests that some diseases resulting from hor- monal or other diffusible protein deficiencies (such as insulin or blood clotting factor deficiencies) may also be amenable to treatment by genetic methods. This therapeutic approach utilizes skin cells that can be readily transformed by a variety of methods and then reintroduced into the patient. Since the process involves a tissue autograft, immune rejection is again more unlikely. The technique has theoretical therapeutic implica- tions for many diseases, such as hemophilia and insulin-deficient forms of diabetes. Initial studies with the technique have been tried in ani- mal systems. Commercial Applications. There are many utilitarian applications of trans- genic organisms to provide humans with a variety of new capabilities not readily available by other means. The following are some examples of such applications. Procaryotic organisms, the recom- binant bacteria first intentionally en- gineered for specific applications, have been designed to carry out numerous industrial and agricultural processes. These include (but are not limited to) frost control on plants, in- creased efficiency of nitrogen fixa- tion in soil bacteria, biodegradation and waste treatment, and mineral processing.15 Growth hormone genes have been used to create transgenic farm ani- mals with a variety of potential com- mercial applications. For example, pigs with long-term expression of bovine growth hormone had signifi- cant daily weight gain, increased effi- ciency of food utilization, and a decrease in subcutaneous fat. Al- though these animals experienced health complications that precluded their immediate commercial utility, it seems clear that further work in this area will lead to healthier and more productive farm animals.'6 Transgenic plants have been en- gineered to enhance crops in a variety of ways. Herbicide tolerance has been introduced in crop plants to improve weed control. A major strategy of this work has been to en- hance the specificity of herbicide re- sistance with a goal of reducing over- all herbicide use. Tomato and other crop plants have been made more disease resistant by genetically intro- ducing viral resistance factors into their genomes. Insect resistance of plants has been enhanced by geneti- cally introducing insect control agents such as Bacillus thuringiensis toxins in transgenic plants."7 Transgenic animals have been created to produce pharmaceutical products that are difficult to produce by other means. Many proteins from eucaryotic organisms cannot be syn- thesized in bacteria (such as E. coli) using traditional recombinant DNA techniques, because procaryotes lack the machinery necessary to synthe- size biologically active proteins.s8 Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is such a protein and is an important therapeutic agent for a variety of human clotting disorders. Thus sheep and a variety of other animals have been genetically modified to produce biologically active t-PA. This technological approach to phar- maceutical production is not without potential health hazard for the ani- mal. Most of the hazards are recog- nizable, however, and appropriate de- sign considerations can be developed to avoid the problems. Transgenic Organisms and Basic Science. Modern transgenic organ- isms are a radical new tool for fun- damental research in agriculture, bi- ology, and medicine. They are power- ful new instruments that will poten- tially open new windows to under- stand the natural world. The magni- tude of this technology's impact on research inquiry is vividly illustrated by citation analysis of Medline refer- ences to transgenic organisms. In 1987 there were 163 references to re- search using transgenic organisms. Since 1987 the number of references has increased in an almost exponen- tial fashion: in 1992 there were over 1,000 citations in which the word transgenic appeared either in the title or as a key-word. The type of organisms referred to in the Medline references is reveal- ing. Because there are over 2,200 cita- tions in the data pool, rigorous analy- sis is difficult. Nevertheless, casual ex- amination illustrates several impor- tant features of this new research ac- tivity. First, organisms utilized in transgenic studies span a wide evolu- tionary range, such as Bombyx monr (silkworms), Caenorhabditis elegans (a nematode used extensively in devel- opmental biology studies), fruit flies, zebrafish, and various agricultural animals including goats, pigs, sheep, and cows. Second, a significant num- ~-- 1841 S7</page><page sequence="8">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 ber of citations refer to transgenic studies involving mice or rats. This fact is not unexpected, given the ubiquity of these animals in labora- tory research. Third, in addition to a wide variety of animals, a significant number of plants are modified by transgenic methods. This observa- tion is particularly relevant to the potential ecological impact of trans- genic organisms (see below). Finally, citation analysis supports the earlier point that transgenic organisms are utilized in a variety of research inquir- ies with vastly different objectives. These projects vary from those with immediately pragmatic goals (such as commercial attempts to increase agricultural product yields), to pro- jects seeking solutions to human health concerns (animal models for sickle cell disease or prostate cancer), to basic inquiries about the behavior of biological systems (such as gene expression in Drosophila or develop- mental processes in zebrafish). The present development of trans- genic organisms has parallels with the development and controversies of re- combinant DNA debate in the early 1970s.19 During that time, many re- searchers were excited by potential commercial applications of recombi- nant DNA. Beyond this significant utilitarian value, however, these same scientists saw the technology as a powerful tool to explore nature. The technique provided a means to iso- late individual genes (or gene clusters) and their products from a complex organism and to transfer them into a much simpler procary- otic organism. It was believed that such isolation would lead to a clearer understanding of gene function, reg- ulation, and interaction. And indeed, the history of recent molecular bi- ology has confirmed the validity of that belief. Our understanding of such diverse phenomena as gene ac- tion, immunology, ecological pro- cesses, and neurobiology has grown immensely during the past fifteen or more years as a direct result ofrecom- binant DNA techniques.2 The dis- covery of the CF gene and genes in- volved in colorectal cancer are simply two examples of fundamental dis- coveries made using many basic tech- niques of recombinant DNA tech- nology. There is another important point of comparison between transgenic and early recombinant DNA re- search. For many scientists in the early 1970s, it would have been dif- ficult to create a list of new things they expected to discover via recom- binant DNA. They could talk, in vary- ing degrees of specificity, about new understandings of gene function and similar phenomena. What most scientists recognized, however, was the technique's tremendous investi- gatory power. The technique could be used to open new vistas of biologi- cal knowledge. It was this epistemo- logical or methodological dimension of the research that animated many scientists' interest in recombinant DNA technology. Similarly, it is difficult to create a tidy list of problems that transgenic techniques can be used to solve. This difficulty stems, in part, from the na- ture of scientific inquiry itself. Al- though scientific discovery allows us to predict behavior in the natural world, the method of science is such that we cannot make predictions about the specific nature or direction of scien- tific inquiry. Scientific inquiry, fun- damentally, is more than an accumu- lation of facts. It is rather a method to understand the natural world. Wil- liam Harvey, the seventeenth century anatomist and physiologist, ex- pressed this conception of science well: "I profess both to learn and to teach anatomy, not from books but from dissections; not from the posi- tions of philosophers but from the fabric of nature."'2 Harvey's epistemology involves a central methodological point: scien- tific knowledge must always be tested against the empirical world. Of neces- sity, the test is almost always inductive. In consequence, it cannot encompass all possible circumstances, and the knowledge derived is thus always ten- tative. This underscores a fundamen- tal tenet ofscience's method, namely, that scientific knowledge is never closed. The metaphor of science as a textbook collection of facts is inade- quate. A better metaphor would be a loose-leaf notebook in which pages can be added and removed at will. Transgenic organisms themselves are now a part of that loose-leaf note- book of science. Furthermore, they are important tools for gaining a greater understanding of nature. Like the transgenic procaryotes that preceded them in the repertoire of scientific investigative tools, trans- genic eucaryotes will ultimately pro- vide humankind with fundamental and valuable knowledge of the natu- ral world. A Scientific Perspective on the Significance and Understanding of Species Transgenic organisms are artificial creations intentionally designed for specific purposes of the human intel- lect. Of equal importance, they are also living beings and thus are part of the evolutionary linked web of nature that gives rise to all species of or- ganisms. This apparently paradoxical situation raises the question, Is there anything significant about being a member of a species? To answer this question requires an understanding of what the term species means and how it came to play such an impor- tant role in modern thinking. Such answers are essential if we are fully to comprehend the particular signifi- cance of biotechnological interven- tions in the natural world. Ernst Mayr notes there are at least three different understandings of the term species.22 The essentialist species concept is ultimately Platonic and holds that "each species is charac- terized by its unchanging essence and separated from all others by a sharp discontinuity" (p. 260). The nominal- istic species concept rejects notions of "essential character" and conceives of species as groups of organisms with common attributes and that share a common descriptive name. Finally, Mayr points to a modern notion of species, which he defines as "a repro- ductive community of populations (reproductively isolated from each other) that occupies a specific niche in nature" (p. 273). While some might argue with this definition, it is sufficiently acceptable that it is re- garded as a paradigm (in the Kuhn- ian sense) by most biologists. This definition involves, implicitly at least, a significant evolutionary aspect. Modern biology generally as- sumes that populations of organisms in ecological niches are evolution- S8</page><page sequence="9">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 From a strictly scientific perspective, there seems to be nothing radically novel about transgenic organisms. arily derived and selectively adapted to occupy "a specific niche in nature." This evolutionary aspect of the spe- cies concept is important. It helps us to understand how species can exist as real entities within the fabric of na- ture. Mayr notes that species are the basic units of evolution or, as Hull has stated, s3pecies "are the things that evolve." It is also important to remember that the notion of species is relatively new in human thought Mayr com- ments that the "ancients did not rec- ognize the biological integrity of each species" (p. 254). Hull observes that for Aristotle, and those thinkers in- fluenced by Aristotelian views, "all species are as eternal and immutable as are the physical elements." While this essentialistic view of species domi- nated Western thinking well into the nineteenth century, it is not unrea- sonable to consider that many of the ancient myths that fired the human imagination involved what we might today call transgenic organisms. The satyr, Minotaur, and many of the clas- sical and pre-Renaissance mythic bes- tiaries easily mixed genetic attributes of organisms across modern tax- onomic divisions.24 These mythic, monstrous or- ganisms suggest that the existence of transgenic organisms in nature might have even been expected in a pre- Linnaean world view. The French molecular biologist Francois Jacob has observed that the sixteenth-cen- tury world view was filled with "mon- sters." They were monsters in that they were creatures which combined attributes of organisms from wildly disparate species. Yet such monstrous creatures always reflected what al- ready existed in nature: "None re- sembles nothing at all. None differs from what can be seen at every turn." Creation of such monsters was not due to faults of nature, for (according to Jacob) nature was not capable of making mistakes. Such monsters ex- isted because of human error or, more commonly, human sin. Thus while nature was not responsible for creating monsters, monsters were nevertheless seen to exist within the natural world. Such a mind-set changed in the mid-1700s when Linnaeus intro- duced a taxonomic scheme to organ- ize nature. The initial Linnaean hier- archy ranked organisms into species, genus, order, class, and kingdom, based on the extent of shared charac- teristics within each taxonomic level. When this taxonomic scheme for or- ganizing the natural world was con- flated with a world view shaped by Old Testament ideas of divine crea- tion, an essentialist idea developed that species were originally created within the fabric of nature. On this view, organisms we encounter in daily existence are expressions of an essen- tial form that exists within created na- ture itself.25 Repeated encounters with nature's reality led many people to question this well-entrenched essentialist con- cept. No encounter with nature, how- ever, was more decisive than Darwin's visit to the Galapagos Islands. Within that small geographical region Dar- win saw such a diversity of life forms that his world view was radically changed. Even a cursory reading of Origin of Species shows that for Darwin the term species was fluid and contex- tually defined. He says, for example: I look at the term species, as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individu- als closely resembling each other, and that it does not differ from the term variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms.26 Darwin began to shift the scientific notion of species away from essential- ist concepts to more nominalistic views. In fact, Mayr notes that "Dar- win had what was very close to the modern biological species concept" (p. 266). For post-Darwinian biologists, who reject essentialist notions of species, there is nothing unique about being a member of a species. While a spe- cies is considered real in modern bi- ology, it is not conceived to be an essentialist reality. Species are not im- mutable "type-forms" woven into the fabric of nature. They are a popu- lationally defined reality that is con- textually and spatiotemporally bounded. For Hull, species can "be treated as historical entities."27 Moreover, as a scientific heuristic de- vice the species concept provides a way to organize and simplify the complex diversity of living organisms by pro- viding convenient labels with which we can distinguish one organism from another. Species, as a spatiotem- porally defined entity, provide what Mayr refers to as a taxon, that is, an entity in nature with taxonomic sig- nificance. In sum, species as taxa are now con- sidered to be real, but they do not carry the same theological or philo- sophic significance as they did under essentialist conceptions. Are Transgenic Organisms a Scientific Novelty? From a strictly scientific perspec- tive, there seems to be nothing radi- cally novel about transgenic or- ganisms. Several lines of argument lead to this conclusion. The first line relates to the modern notion of spe- cies, for this definition implies that all living organisms are in an evolution- ary sense transgenic to the extent that they share common genes. The process of evolution is one in which genetic information is shared among all organisms, thereby providing potentially new phenotypic traits upon which selection (either natu- rally or humanly directed) operates. My dog and I share common genetic information, and we both carry pro- caryotic organisms, which line our in- testines, with genetic sequences simi- lar to our own cells. Indeed, it is a virtual postulate of modern evolu- tionary theory that at the level of DNA all organisms are interrelated. Merely consider that the DNA in S9</page><page sequence="10">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 each of our cells is the product of multiple replications over millions of years. For example, some million or more generations ago, a DNA mol- ecule in an organism began a series of replications until it was passed on to me. It is not inconceivable that rem- nants of that same primordial DNA molecule now reside in the cells of a chimpanzee in Africa. A second line of argument sup- ports the contention that transgenic organisms are not radically novel creations: human beings have been either using or creating highly mod- ified organisms, through domestica- tion, for much of our evolutionary history. Jacob Bronowski notes that human discovery of wheat led pre- viously wandering tribes into a village agricultural life-style.28 He claims that a nomadic life-style would never cre- ate a civilization, whereas with an agrarian life-style, civilization is inevi- table. From this view, domestication (and modification) of natural or- ganisms and civilization seem to be inextricably interwoven. Domestication of living organisms, with a concomitant and often radical alteration in their form and function, has always been a part of cultural human existence. For example, human relations with dogs can be documented to have existed 12,000 years ago among the Natufian settlers in the area of what is now recognized as Israel.29 The interactions between humans and dogs were possibly driven by both utilitarian as well as nonpragmatic motives. Henry claims that "the driving forces behind their domestication were their use in hunt- ing and perhaps a general affection for the animal."" Furthermore, this evidence suggests that canine domes- tication was sufficient to have led to morphological changes in the ani- mals themselves."3 There is also evi- dence to indicate that domestication of dogs preceded that of plants. The Natufian people appear to have been a hunter/foraging culture rather than agriculturally based society.32 Domestication is so extensive in human activity and has so radically altered the physical appearance of living organisms that it was no acci- dent for Darwin to open Origin of Spe- cies with a chapter on domesticated animals. The chapter serves two vital functions. First, it addresses an issue all of his readers would understand and relate to from personal ex- perience. Second, he focuses atten- tion on a central problem in biology: the tremendous diversity of living beings. Darwin notes that human domestication has produced a diver- sity of life forms that exceeds that found in nature. This point was once illustrated to me by a student's re- sponse to a question about Darwin's views of domestic and natural diver- sity. The student replied: "He seems to be dealing with the question 'A wolf is a wolf, but what is a dog?'" Briefly consider, what is a dog? In a sense, a dog is a wolf, or similar wild canine, that readily accepts human domination and has suppressed or in- hibited many instinctive behaviors. These behavioral changes have been brought about by close human asso- ciation that has produced a tre- mendous diversity of animals, all of which are referred to as Canus domes- ticus. Yet note the vast differences be- tween a chihuahua, St. Bernard, pekingese, or greyhound. Any natu- ralist encountering these animals in the wild might initially classify them (based on morphological appear- ance) at the genus or higher tax- onomic level. Darwin made a similar observation about pigeons in Origin of Species: Altogether at least a score of [domestic] pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to an or- nithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would cer- tainly ... be ranked by him as well-defined species (p. 22). The diversity of form and function of domesticated organisms is so great that morphologically they appear to span species, genera, and other tax- onomic distinctions. Darwin further observed that this diversity was brought about by conscious human ef- fort. Consequently, domesticated or- ganisms, created through human selection, might fairly be viewed as the precursors of transgenic or- ganisms created via modern techno- logical manipulation. If this perspec- tive is allowed, then in many respects humans have been more or less radi- cally modifiying organisms, trans- genically or otherwise, for millennia. From procaryotes to humans, we are all only somebody's next meal. The major difference introduced into this process is that modern tech- nological methods allow novel genet- ic elements to be combined in unique ways that are impossible via selection methods. Furthermore, the pace of creating these organisms is vastly accelerated. Although humans have benefited greatly by domestication of animals, it is important to remember that this practice also has had its decidedly problematic aspects. Consider the damaging effects of intensive inter- breeding on dogs and cats that has led to congenital hip dysplasia and heart defects in dogs, congenital cranofacial anomalies (resulting in problems such as cleft palate) in Burmese cats, and bleeding dis- orders, such as various hemophilias, in both dogs and cats. Diseases such as epilepsy or diabetes are also com- mon among many of our domestic pet animals. Since the discovery of restriction endonucleases and small genetic ele- ments, such as plasmids, we are now able to manipulate genetic informa- tion almost at will from one organism to another. Modern technology al- lows us to accelerate the process of genetic diversification, as well as to cross much broader evolutionary boundaries than was presumably possible with either domestic or natu- ral selection. It is not readily ap- parent, however, that these innova- tions allow us to achieve goals that are radically different in kind from those we achieved using more con- ventional methods of selective breeding. By the same token, it is also difficult to imagine that we can create greater or unprecedented harms to animals via these innova- tions than we have already brought about through domestic breeding. However, given the acceleration of change by biotechnological inter- SIO</page><page sequence="11">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 ventions, potential injuries may ap- pear at a faster rate. Some Ethical Reflections from a Biologist's Perspective "The introduction of genes into the germline of mammals is one of the major recent technological ad- vances of modern biology.'"s The potential insights into human biology and disease processes offered by transgenic technology are profound. The implications of transgenic or- ganisms for commercial utility and innovation are equally extraordinary, as are the new windows opened into the natural world by these novel or- ganisms. However, like all new scien- tific and technological frontiers, ani- mal biotechnology raises serious ethi- cal considerations. From a biologist's perspective, these considerations seem to fall into the following general categories. Respect for Species Distinctions. As previously noted, do we have a moral obligation ethically to respect biologi- cal species as such? Alternatively, should mice be allowed to be mice without carrying burdens of non- mouse genes, some of which are not intended to benefit the mice? Several responses to this question come to mind. First, it should be ap- parent from the previous discussion that from a modern biological per- spective, there is nothing unique or special about being a member of a species per se. All living organisms are part of an interwoven net of living beings formed by evolution. All liv- ing organisms use and are used by other organisms. From procaryotes to humans, we are all only some- body's next meal. To believe other- wise is to reject a fundamental prem- ise of modern biology. As far as we know, human beings are the only species explicitly aware of this web of nature. With this knowledge comes an obligation to recognize the significance of the web and to treat it with respect and care. Arguably, however, this obliga- tion is grounded more in our own enlightened self-interest than in any presently articulated moral theory or scientific rationale. From a purely scientific perspective, human con- cerns seem irrelevant in the natural world. Evolution proceeded just as well in the absence of human exist- ence as it has in our presence. Furthermore, unless we somehow manage to sterilize the entire surface of the planet (which seems unlikely), evolution will continue when our bones and cultures become another layer in the fossil record. Second, through human interven- tion in nature, we have always altered the biological world around us. It is not unreasonable to conclude that our "tinkering with nature" is an es- sential aspect of our human charac- ter and is largely responsible for the development of our cultures and civi- lizations. Moreover, our alteration of other organisms for our own benefit has not always been detrimental to individual organisms or even species. Daniel Koshland illustrates this point very well in an imaginary conversa- tion between a wolf and a dog: An original wolf might say to a dog, "You have lost your freedom. Your obsequiousness is humili- ating to the family Canidae." The dog could reply, "I am much less warlike, far more altruistic, and besides, it's a wonderful standard of living."34 Beyond possibly being charged with uncritical anthropomorphism, Kosh- land's mythic conversation nicely il- lustrates the point that domesticated species have often benefited by their associations with humans. Finally, one might claim that we have a moral obligation to violate spe- cies barriers and to create transgenic organisms. Arguably knowledge itself is an inherent human value and its pursuit an ethical responsibility. Transgenic organisms are a valuable research tool for pursuing knowl- edge. They are not mythic creatures, like Minotaur or the satyr, created in the dark imagination of the human psyche. Rather they are an actual part of the web of our natural and cultural worlds. Biology, like all science, is a pursuit of knowledge by an open- ended encounter with those worlds. It has no boundaries, except the morally reprehensible. Absent the transgression of these morally repre- hensible boundaries, transgenic or- ganisms are like any other part of the natural world, and therefore must be open to scientific inquiry, especially when that inquiry holds a promise of human benefit. The thesis of this argument is that we are under no intrinsic moral ob- ligation to respect species barriers. There is, however, an important caveat to this conclusion. The argu- ment's weight is applicable primarily to species used in laboratory environ- ments. In the natural world (the world outside of the laboratory win- dow) populations as taxonomic enti- ties and species barriers may have greater moral significance. While it is true that only individual organisms exist in nature, those individuals exist in restricted populations we refer to as species that have arisen within an ecosystemic historical mil- ieu. Furthermore, as E. O. Wilson has noted, these populations interact with each other in ways that are often very poorly understood.35 Species (as "reproductive communities") inter- act with other species in systemic ways that often transcend the action of any individual species. Conse- quently, from a scientific perspective, though notions of species integrity in a laboratory setting may not be morally significant or compelling, we would be morally culpable if we al- lowed a transgenic organism to dis- rupt a subtle natural systemic balance by disregarding what may be natu- rally defined species boundaries. Potential for Pain and Suffering. A second moral consideration as- S11</page><page sequence="12">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 sociated particularly with laboratory research is potentially more serious and is the reason I chose creation of the CF mouse as a model transgenic experiment. The concern involves possible harm or suffering an in- dividual transgenic animal might ex- perience. As previously noted, the CFTR (-/-) strain of mice develops many symptoms common to human CF, including premature death. Do we have a moral right intentionally to create such a mouse (or other crea- ture capable of experiencing pain) that we know will develop such a de- bilitating and painful disease? If one accepts the claim that trans- genic animals are not, in principle, different from other animals, then questions about pain and suffering are similar to questions regarding an- imal use in general. Development and use of sentient transgenic ani- mals must be governed by established regulatory policy and reviewed by in- stitutional animal care and use com- mittees. (See Section 3.) Furthermore, like other questions involving research use of animals, the moral parameters for using trans- genic organisms must be contextually defined. (See Section 2.) Potential animal suffering must be weighed against potential human suffering al- leviated through knowledge gained by animal use. After due consid- eration, we might conclude that creating a strain of mice as models of CF is morally justified because it may ultimately alleviate the acute suffer- ing of a significant number of human children. On the other hand, using similar techniques to create a strain of dogs with some serious physical ab- normality (such as severely shortened legs) to serve as pets would arguably be morally reprehensible. Ecological Impact of Transgenic Or- ganisms. The potential environmental role and impact of transgenic or- ganisms has been poorly studied, al- though questions regarding their in- fluence on the environment are probably quite significant. We are only in the early stages of intention- ally releasing and testing genetically altered procaryotic organisms. The release process is governed by guide- lines established for the original re- combinant DNA experiments: that is, we should begin with simple systems that seem to be well understood and can cause little potential damage. Lindow's creation of the ice mutant of Pseudomonas syringaefor prevention of frost damage on plants is a good ex- ample of this principle."6 The ice phenotype is one found naturally in wild-type populations of Pseudomonas syringae. Consequently, intentional re- lease of a mutant created in the laboratory was a mimic of organisms found in the natural population. Intentional release of genetically al- tered eucaryotic organisms into wild populations should be governed by two broad sets of principles. One set would be grounded in principles similar to those governing release of procaryotes. A second set of prin- ciples is more difficult to define but is grounded in a notion of avoiding hubris and the pitfalls of our own ig- norance. As suggested previously, the natural world is a complex inter- woven net that often, if not charac- teristically, behaves in a systemic rather than individualistic fashion. All living beings, from E. coli to Homo sapiens, are parts of an all-encompass- ing animate web formed by evolu- tion. Under evolutionary pressure to survive, organisms characteristically use any attribute that-provides an advantage over other creatures in the web. We believe that human beings are the only organism aware of this fabric of nature. Nevertheless, our aware- ness often is imperfect and leads to hubristic misunderstanding and con- sequent abuse of other natural or- ganisms. We often confuse awareness with wisdom. Wilson has emphasized how poorly we know and understand the complexity of species interre- latedness and interdependence: "We know some species fit together in twos and threes, but not how the whole community fits together."37 The tools of modern biotechnology allow us to intervene in nature in ways that are at least quantitatively, if not qualitatively different from our pre- vious capabilities. It is vitally impor- tant that we attend to these problems of scale and avoid the overweening pride of some of our previous inter- ventions. In practice, both transgenically al- tered animals and plants are subject to intentional release. The potential ecological impact of each is different. Indeed, because of their more imme- diate commercial utility, intentional release of transgenic plants may pose more pressing policy issues. In this country, proposed release of any transgenic organism should be sub- ject to serious review by the National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, and any intentional release would presumably be blocked until the potential eco- logical impact of the altered or- ganism was understood. The focus of this paper has been heavily zoological, yet transgenic technologies have equal or perhaps greater utilitarian applicability for plants. As noted above, a significant number of Medline references to transgenic research involve plant al- terations. Furthermore, most plants that are genetically modified (wheth- er through selective breeding or laboratory manipulation) are in- tended for use outside of the labora- tory, barn, or hot-house. Transgenic plants will become a part of our sur- rounding environment. Before this occurs, however, it is essential that we better understand the systemic eco- logical interactions of the environ- ment into which we intend to release these modified plants. In so doing, we must bear in mind Wilson's admoni- tion that "ecology is far a more com- plex subject than physics" (p. 181). It is important that we become fully aware of how these altered organisms can potentially interact with resident members of that environment. One only need consider a kudzu-covered forest along a southern U.S. highway or a hyacinth-choked bayou in Louisi- \ \ 7k .~ ~~ I '), o.,t Si~rr :; ?,J -- S12</page><page sequence="13">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 The tools of modern biotechnology allow us to intervene in nature in ways that are at least quantitatively, if not qualitatively different from our previous capabilities. ana to understand the potential en- vironmental havoc that a well- adapted plant can cause when it finds a new ecological niche. In contrast to plants, reasons for in- tentional environmental release of a transgenic animal seem limited. Mariculture might be one such rea- son. For example, fisheries in Iceland process "ocean raised" salmon. In this process, salmon ova are artifi- cially fertilized, and the resulting fry are maintained in hatcheries. When the fry are of sufficient size, they are introduced into streams that are dammed off from major oceanic fjords. After the fish have attained sufficient size and strength to survive in the ocean, they are released into the fjord. They swim into the ocean where, for a period of years, they fully develop and mature. Ultimately, under internal biological pressure, they return to the fjord to spawn. At that time, they are "harvested" and sold for food. Salmon presently used in this process are natural, wild-type fish. However, the pressure to create "bet- ter" fish using transgenic techniques is very real. Such a fish might have an increased capacity for weight gain or a shorter maturation time. Indeed one can let the biological engineer- ing imagination run wild to conceive of commercially advantageous traits. Using such a modified fish in the process described above would have to be carefully weighed, however, be- cause the ecological consequences could be severe, including the im- poverishment of wild genetic stocks. As an aside, I should note that modern biotechnology provides us with tools to understand the com- plexity of environmental and ecologi- cal interactions in ways that were pre- viously impossible. Techniques of gene cloning, amplification, and sequencing provide new and exciting approaches to understand the ways individuals relate to communities and communities relate to ecosys- tems. Furthermore, molecular and cellu- lar biology may also allow us to save some of nature's biodiversity, at least at a genetic level. In a provocative paper entitled "Saving the 'Library of Life,"' Gregory Benford has pro- posed a major international effort to collect and cryogenically preserve species in threatened ecospheres.38 Benford acknowledges that the economic, social, and cultural forces causing widespread species extinc- tion will be difficult to slow. He likens our situation to that of being in the library at Alexandria as the fire raged. We do not have the time to discern an Aristotelian manuscript from "Alex- ander the Great's laundry list." We must simply grab what we can and flee. In a similar fashion, he claims we lack the time properly to catalog the biodiversity of the world. We must simply collect and preserve the genet- ic information of as many species as possible and leave it to future genera- tions to sort out the significance of that information. Human Applications. A further ethi- cal concern of this research involves application of biotechnology to humans, toward which much re- search seems directed.39 Arguably we would be morally culpable if we have the ability to alleviate the suffering of an individual with a profound genetic defect, such as CF, Tay-Sachs, or sickle cell anemia, and we fail to use that ability. Yet this conclusion threatens to lead us onto the moral philosopher's slippery slope. Distinc- tions between profound genetic de- fects, with their associated suffering, and merely attractive traits that in- dividuals might like their children to possess (such as large body mass so that a son could become a highly paid NFL linebacker) may be clear. Cases between these two extremes, however, are often more subtle, un- clear, and ethically problematic. The moral considerations become even more profound and difficult when we ask about our obligations to future offspring of individuals suffer- ing from a treatable genetic disease. We may be morally obligated to treat somatic cell deficiencies in an af- flicted individual, but do we have an obligation to treat such deficiencies at the germ-cell level? Do we have a moral obligation to insure that in- dividuals suffering from a genetic dis- ease can produce children who lack the genetic defect? While an obliga- tion to alleviate immediate suffering, if we can do so, seems reasonably clear, does that obligation extend to some future individual not yet con- ceived? Such moral obligations intui- tively seem problematic, and answers to these difficult questions are not readily obvious. Is Transgenic Technology Inherently Dangerous Knowledge?A final concern about using transgenic technology on humans is intimately tied to an issue articulated by the famous bio- chemist Edwin Chargaff.40 In 1973 Chargaff sensed a growing public dis- enchantment with science. From his perspective there were many forces leading to what he perceived as a growing isolation of science and scientists from the rest of society. He observed that it is often only a short span of time from theoretical concep- tion to technological implementa- tion, and the span seems to grow shorter as history progresses. He eloquently concluded his essay with the question: the great concepts that for many thousands of years spoke to the mind and even more to the heart of humanity-reconciliation and charity, redemption and salva- tion-have they all been pushed aside and annihilated by science? (p. 502) Chargaff's concern about the scale and rapidity of technological im- plementation is potent and well taken. It is especially compelling for technologies as powerful as the ability to move genetic elements from one creature to another. However, else- where in his 1973 essay Chargaff com- ments that "society has the science it S13</page><page sequence="14">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 deserves" (p. 500). The inference is that society has the capacity to control science. Control of "the devil's doc- trine" lies in society's hands, if society chooses to exercise that control. Thus we need not share Chargaff's pessi- mism as long as mechanisms exist within modern culture to prevent drastic abuse of technology. Multidis- ciplinary discourse and inquiry about the potential harms of biotechnology is only one such mechanism. Biotechnology's Power and Peril As is often the case with technolog- ical innovations, development of transgenic organisms is a metaphori- cal two-edged sword. The technology is potent with new vistas of general welfare and health for both humans and other animals. Like all revolu- tionary technological innovations, creation of transgenic plants and ani- mals has the potential to alter science itself by providing new tools for scien- tific inquiry. The technology allows us to ask and to formulate answers to questions about nature that were im- possible in the technology's absence. Yet the technology's power also creates profound possibilities for moral abuse and environmental chaos. The technology has the power seriously to corrupt our most deeply felt human sense of values. Such tech- nological abuse could potentially lead to profound distortions of fun- damental and essential aspects of both human and animate nature. Nevertheless, transgenic organisms are now a technological reality with which we humans must deal. Like the creatures of Pandora's box, they are no longer contained behind some mythic veil. As with many moral is- sues, the fashioning of transgenic or- ganisms presents us with treacherous slippery slopes and moral ambigui- ties. Such organisms pose questions about our moral obligations to both our fellow humans as well as the other living beings with whom we share this planet. As is frequently the case, while science may help to inform and sharpen the moral engagement of these questions, it does not provide us with tools to derive adequate ethical answers. This difficulty is inherent in the limitations of scientific inquiry. As observed in Section 2, the responses to these questions "are as many as there are different cultural, religious, and philosophic perspectives." Scien- tific inquiry is ill-prepared to deal with pluralistic perspectives that are not subject to empirical boundaries or testable propositions. Thus finding answers to these questions is a part of our broader human condition. As human beings, we naturally wrestle for anchors on the slippery slopes of our moral landscape. This fun- damental problem is made even more complex as we attempt to dis- cover our moral obligations to other members of the biological web within which all living beings are inter- twined. -Rivers Singleton, Jr in collaboration with Gary B. Ellis and Gordon M. Burghardt 2. Philosophic and Ethical Challenges of Animal Biotecbnology Animal biotechnology and the fashioning of transgenic animals, along with biotechnology in general, are potent new tools in the arsenal of modern, post-industrial societies. They promise to transform scientific and biomedical research, medical therapies and health care, economic markets and agribusiness, if not the rest of our lives. They augur a new era of human existence and well-being. Yet animal bioengineering in partic- ular confronts a curious cultural stumbling block. It faces a cacophony of ethically ardent boosters and pas- sionate detractors alike, animated by equal moral zeal.41 At the heart of the contention are the new and deeper human interven- tions into animate life and the explic- it resurrection of an old theme: the incorporation of animals and ani- mate nature in human communities and the corresponding involvement of humans in the wider natural world. In short, humans and nature are and have always been mutually im- manent, each in the other. For both boosters and detractors the terms of this mutual involvement seem to be significantly changing. For the boosters, the further incorporation of nature into human communal life (the human "artificing" of nature) is potentially a great boon. For the detractors, we are threatened with ex- tensive harm to natural systems and with losing a humanly significant rela- tion to nature. We are in danger of eclipsing important moral, cultural, and religious values and orienta- tions.42 Interestingly, the boosters and detractors are not always different. The contention often rages within in- dividuals and communally allied groups themselves. The new inter- ventions into nature seem inherently fraught with moral conflict and am- biguity. How do we explain these ethi- cal tensions, both within and among human individuals? The answer no doubt must be that individually and collectively we do not live in a single morally harmo- nious world, undergirded by some one or coherently few ethical values that neatly organize our moral life and coordinate our practical activi- ties. Rather, the opposite seems to hold. We confront an ineradicable moral plurality: a bewildering variety of values and ethical obligations, each claiming attention and not readily coordinated with the others.43 How can we make philosophic sense of this moral disjointedness? And how ethi- cally and practically do we deal with Technology's power also creates profound possibilities for moral abuse and environmental chaos. S14</page><page sequence="15">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 this plurality with respect to animal biotechnology? Plural moral values seem funda- mentally rooted in the complexity of our human nature and our individual status as personal, social, and natural beings. Within the everyday life of human communities, there are several "spheres," "realms," or "do- mains" of human activity only loosely coordinated and integrated. Each has its perspective on the world; each is animated by dominant values (ethi- cal and other); each involves an over- riding notion of how life ought to be lived in the world. These spheres, realms, or domains-for our pur- poses, the terms are interchangea- ble-are loosely defined by the fun- damental human activities to which they refer. The values, perspectives, and moral world views themselves dominantly evolve out of and in turn inform these particular and abiding modes of activity. Each domain has its complex cultural history, dynamically intertwined with the others; each its own structures of meaning and signif- icance by which humans orient them- selves in their several practical and cultural activities. Tensions among these plural realms spawn the ethical contention and am- bivalence surrounding the various modes of animal biotechnology. This situation is certainly not unique to animal biotechnology. Moral conten- tion and the tension among plural ultimate values and opposing ethical allegiances seem the warp and woof of modern human existence. Historically and logically there seem two basic strategies to deal with the pull of opposing values or obliga- tions. One is to subsume the moral many under some one grand monis- tic scheme: to establish a hierarchy of values and obligations under the hegemony of one ultimate value. The other possible strategy is to face the plural values and obligations squarely and somehow attempt to give each its proper due in conjunction with the others. The monistic strategy may serve the peace of the soul by reducing in- ternal moral conflict. Perhaps it is possible in relatively small and homo- geneous communities. In any case, it invariably is bought at the price of the variety and richness of human ex- perience and significant cultural ac- tivity. In this sense it impoverishes the human soul. The monistic strategy is not a viable option in our modern world. Plural traditions and modes of human activ- ity are too well entrenched practically to be subdued. Moreover, the very variety of humanly significant values and activities harbors a richness that is good in itself-if the several plural goods can be adequately coordinated and despite the inner tensions of moral and spiritual life. This might strike some of us as making a virtue out of ethical necessity. Yet the strategy of coordinating plural moral obligations seems our only practical alternative. That there are several relatively au- tonomous yet mutually interacting spheres of human activity means that there are always specific or "provin- cial" contexts of human activity. Thus the coordination of obligations must always be contextual. Moreover, given that the many spheres of human ac- tivity can and do importantly in- fluence one another, there must be a coordination of values both within and amongparticular spheres of activ- ity.44 Contextually coordinating our plural obligations requires a deci- sionmaking art of moral ecology, ju- dicious mutual weighting of the several obligations in the various contexts at hand, be they narrower or wider. In considering the philosophic and ethical challenges of animal biotech- nology, we will follow the demands of contextual plural obligations and moral ecology. The first task is briefly to sketch the most salient spheres of human activity and their world views, dominant values, and perspectives on animal biotechnology (pro, con, or both). This includes recognizing the ethical agreements and tensions among the various spheres with re- spect to animal biotechnologies. Next we will critically examine animal biotechnological interventions in different contexts of human activity and explore how the coordination of plural obligations might play out in different settings: for example, in the wild, in scientific and biomedical laboratories, in marketplaces, and on farms. Finally, we will discuss the un- finished theoretical business of moral ecology and how to face plural obliga- tions in particular contexts: specifi- cally, how overall priorities or coordi- nations of the plural values and ob- ligations should be effected; what value, goodness, and moral weight should be accorded to animals and nature; and who should decide all this. Animal Biotechnology and Spheres of Human Activity Science and Biomedical Research. The original context of animal bio- technology is of course modern science, including biomedicine, and the animating world view of the natu- ral sciences is crucial to under- standing the boosters of animal bio- technology and their moral impera- tives. Contemporary natural science has its roots in the philosophic and scientific revolutions of sixteenth and seventeenth century Europe, in which nature was conceived to be fundamentally materialistic and mechanistic in character. According to dominant Galilean, Cartesian, and Newtonian modes of thought, na- ture, including animate and animal life, was considered to be mere mat- ter or energy in motion, operating under universal, deterministic causal laws (statistical or no) discoverable through experimental manipulations or rationally disciplined and "objec- tive" observations. This account no doubt constitutes an over-simplification of the activities and world picture of contemporary natural sciences, but arguably it has yet to be significantly modified or superseded, particularly with re- spect to its value implications. A rig- orous classical materialist or mecha- nist, whether for methodological or ultimate metaphysical reasons, con- siders nature valueless and purpose- less. Nature is accorded no particular goodness (intrinsic significance or in- herent value) of its own, though it is deemed to have important instru- mental value for us humans and other living beings. It serves our human purposes well, as means to our ends." Nature is considered a great, primary resource providing for human creaturely needs and our peculiarly human thirst for knowl- edge about the natural universe. S15</page><page sequence="16">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 This is a world view in which scien- tific knowing and its technological applications march hand in hand to satisfy the welfare needs of humans and perhaps other animals. Human technological control over natural processes in service of human well- being, particularly the relief of suffer- ing or other human deprivations, is deemed an ultimate value and moral imperative. The controlled manipu- lation of nature, the experimental production of "natural effects," has even been considered by some to constitute the very essence of scien- tific knowledge. From such a perspective there seems no inherent ethical check to biotechnological interventions, save practical threats to humans' own moral character and welfare, animal welfare (if animals' experiential na- ture is given due recognition), and ecosystemic processes (via the intro- duction or escape of destructive or- ganisms into the environment). There is no serious ethical concern for animal species or ecosystems as such, since they are typically con- ceived to carry no significance or ethical weight of their own. We humans are and should be ruled by enlightened self-interest and only pragmatic concern when it comes to wider animate nature. This is the dominant ethical landscape of mod- ern laboratory science and biomedi- cal research, if not medicine itself. Interestingly this world view and ethical perspective begin to shift when we move from the more experi- mentally manipulative laboratory sciences of physics, chemistry, and molecular biology to evolutionary bi- ology, systematics, and ecology.48 With the latter sciences, biological and animal species, as the historically engendered outcome of evolutionary and ecological processes, and the evolutionary ecosystems themselves are accorded a significant (though perhaps amoral) reality of their own, independent of their instrumental usefulness to humans--a reality that ought to be protected from the sys- temic negative consequences of human interventions, whether ani- mal biotechnological or other.49 This scientifically informed perspective in- cludes, but goes beyond enlightened self-interest. There is an explicit, ar- There is a common conviction that both natural and economic systems run to their own, amoral rhythms, which for pragmatic reasons should not be significantly checked or undermined. ticulate, if difficult-to-explain respect for animate nature and its autopoetic or self-creative processes. This shift in world view and valua- tion is carried further when we move beyond the conceptually self-disci- plined sciences of nature to more speculative philosophies of nature, in which the values and 'natural good- ness' of animate and animal life and evolutionary and ecological pro- cesses are explicitly and critically con- sidered.50 Here a full-blown respect for nature and its own inherent good- ness or fundamental significance in human experience and cultural life emerge. This is the ethical landscape of "natural preservationists" of vari- ous stripes. As we move along the continuum from the more reductionist, atomis- tic, and analytic laboratory sciences through the more systemic sciences of evolutionary biology and ecology to the more full-throated philos- ophies of nature, there is an ever more critical scrutiny of animal bio- technological practices. Will the bio- technological effects be truly benign with respect to humans, the animals themselves, and nature? Can we ade- quately predict individual animal, population, or ecosystemic con- sequences of biotechnological inter- ventions? Can we really control them? Do we at least in certain contexts (for example, in the wild) illicitly interfere with a morally significant intactness or integrity of individual or species life and evolutionary/ecosystemic processes? Concerns of respect over- take and subsume welfare obliga- tions. Economic Markets and Agribusiness. Modern economic activity, including new agricultural and farming prac- tices, share much in common with the outlook of modern natural science. There is a common instru- mental perspective on nature and an- imal life as a vast, if not inexhaustible resource for humans to draw upon. There is a common push to a "cor- porate" coordination of human activ- ity and control over natural processes and products. There is a dominant moral commitment to human wel- fare and well-being, though here the accent might be more on providing opportunities for practical human ac- tivity (including the accumulation of wealth) than compassionately con- fronting human suffering, morbidity, and mortality. There is a common conviction, at least in capitalistic countries, that both natural and economic systems run to their own, amoral rhythms, which for pragmatic reasons should not be significantly checked or un- dermined. Moreover, biotechnology, including animal biotechnology, promises to be good business and to promote the overall economic good. Modern science, its biotech- nologies, and business are natural allies and mutually reinforce each other in unimpeded service to the various dimensions of human wel- fare-as long as other important values and ethical obligations do not intrude. Public Political Life. The use of ani- mals and animal biotechnology gains its first ethically critical check from the public domain of political life. For here the dominant ethical values are not solely or primarily shaped by the welfare needs or economic op- portunities of individual human beings. Rather, especially in modern political democracies, moral atten- tion focuses on the allied ethical values of respect for individuals, political or civic equality, social jus- tice, and due political and legal process. Historically it is from within this domain of human political activity that the more dominant modern ethical theories-deontological or rights-based and consequential- S16</page><page sequence="17">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 ist/utilitarian with welfare concerns for the effects or consequences of actions-have primarily emerged. These theories base themselves on fundamental principles of equality, justice, and universal or atemporal ra- tionality. Each morally relevant entity (for example, an individual human being) is to count as one and only one and is to be given equal ethical consideration, if not equal specific treatment. This holds whether moral interest is focused upon the rights and respect owed to relevant in- dividuals or their individual welfare. These politically inspired ethical theories become relevant to the use of animals and animal biotechnology when moral consideration is ex- tended to animals themselves. This consideration is either in virtue of their being sentient creatures with their own experiential welfare or in- dividual "subjects of a life" who ethi- cally command respect and a recog- nition of their inherent rights, for ex- ample, to life, liberty of action, and freedom from intentionally inflicted suffering. Whichever the basis of the moral status, the animals are brought within the relevant universe of ethical discourse and concern and are accorded serious and just moral attention. This is the political ethics that un- dergirds the moral arguments of con- temporary animal rightists and ani- mal liberationists, with their univer- salist critiques (based on justice and respect or welfare) of our human use of animals, including new biotech- nological interventions.51 These ra- tionally universal arguments have in- volved a more or less radical condem- nation of the human use of animals and animal biotechnology. Yet these same generic forms of political ethics are alternatively used to justify animal use and biotechnology.5 The argu- ments seem to turn on where one draws the line of moral consid- erability: be this the kind of individu- ality or capacities to be (variously) re- spected, or sentient beings' varying levels of experiential and existential welfare. Domestic Life, Homes, and Recreation. If universality or universalism charac- terize the fundamental rationality and world views of the natural sciences and biomedicine, economic theory (if not economic practice), and political ethics, then particularity dominates the world of our homes and private lives. Here we also find lively attention to welfare, respect, human flourishing, and fairness, but these concerns characteristically are directed toward particular individu- als involved in intimate and long- standing relationships. Here we dwell within a world of familiar subjects, rather than directing ethical atten- tion to unknown others. Ethical con- siderations and responses are less for- mal, rationalistic, and objective, and more personal, aesthetic, and all- encompassing or holistic. There is ongoing concern for particular in- dividuals who have multiple needs and dimensions to their lives, and who are more or less wrapped up with one another. The mutual adjust- ments required by concern for such interdependent individuals defy the more universalist and objective anal- yses of a politically oriented ethics. This sphere of private and domes- tic activity adds a crucial dimension to a mature and nuanced ethics of ani- mal use, including animal biotech- nology, though again we should not expect things to be simple. The pri- vate realm is where many of us inti- mately get to know animals, for ex- ample, as companions or pets. The animals enter into our private lives and our webs of intimate personal re- lations. We know our dogs, cats, and horses (among animal others) to have individual characters and specif- ic welfare needs and to enjoy highly particular and reciprocally meaning- ful relations with us. Here is a characteristic origin of a natural and wholly legitimate empa- thetic concern for individual animal welfare, if not also a fundamental philosophical curiosity about animal and animate life.53 To take animals ethically into account, we do not need to be rationally convinced by the objective justice arguments of the political ethicists. Yet we also know that our "home" animals exist within the wider web of our intimate rela- tions and that our ethical concerns and obligations to intimate human others often and legitimately take precedence over concerns for our an- imals. We rescue our children and human others before our animals in the face of imminent danger. We humanely "put down" our aging or incurably sick pets, but not ourselves. Less dramatically, when away from home, we send our children to grand- parents, friends, or summer camps. Our dogs and cats go to kennels. In this private realm we vividly glimpse our complex and morally ambivalent attitude toward animals. Animals may genuinely become a part of the ethical fabric of personal lives lived together. But they must fit within this fabric, and this means a primary and overriding, though not exclusive moral concern for the human others. Thus many of us who are keenly interested in animals and their individual welfare ethically tolerate the extermination of animal pests, an ethically appropriate use of animals in scientific and biomedical research and education, the use of animals for food, clothing, and enter- tainment, and even ethically nuanced and respectful hunting and fishing. This no doubt is morally ambigu- ous and slippery territory, with ever present potential for animal abuse. Pet owners may ignore or be ob- livious to the genuine welfare needs of their animals. Animal breeders may selectively indulge their own id- iosyncratic tastes, at the expense of the breeds themselves. In enjoying meals together, we may neglect the condition of farm animals. Hunters and those who fish may make their prey mere objects of their skills, mutual competitiveness, or economic aspirations. Researchers pursuing scientific or therapeutic knowledge may overlook the suffering, potential or actual, of their animal subjects. This is undeniably true, and it is here that political ethics, with universalist critiques and reason-based appeals to ,n , , ! l ! nei i 11..l l'11 'l|| lo t ?I???, Il i' ii :i jjji; i / j ;??~:;i i~:r~l ~iil j i t /:IIiiiiiiI\ i. `, ,ii II : '' I'I;j "' ii ''' I 1 r iilli 'ri ii ii; "','j /Ji/Ij; ' ' i:i -_ff --11-~---~--1- _~___ S17</page><page sequence="18">SPECALL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 justice and fairness, performs its most valuable service. Nevertheless its strength is perhaps its weakness. Its rationally dispassionate, objective glance characteristically misses the irreducible particularity and com- plexity of life human and animal. It misses life's multivalued and intricate interwovenness, in which humans both intimately and ethically relate to and use animals. Political ethics use- fully prods us to clean up our act with respect to animal abuse, but it argua- bly should not tamper with the more fundamental fabric and habits and abidingly significant, value-laden ac- tivities of human communal life. We need a richer and more nuanced ethics to oversee these complexly tex- tured matters. In fact, it is precisely the decided ethical significance of the particular that public ethics, with its relative em- phasis on sameness and equality over uniqueness and diversity, is most in danger of overlooking. We noted the importance of the particular in the at- tention given to the individual char- acter and specific welfare of animals involved in personal or family webs of lives. But the moral strengths of par- ticularity and a concerned attention to individual animals do not stop in homes. They centrally inform animal research ethics, where a critically an- thropomorphic concern for individ- ual and species being ought to hold sway.54 They help (beyond the call of political ethics) to turn the attention of animal breeders away from humanly "fashionable animals" to individual animals' own particular well-being. They could per- haps add strength to checking the more egregious abuses of factory farming. Particularity focuses the concernful attention of those who hunt, fish, or otherwise pursue ani- mals in the wild on the lives of in- dividual animals, the well-being of specific animal populations or spe- cies, and the ongoing viability of the particular habitats and ecosystems of which they are a part. All this is cen- tral to good animal ethics and (as we shall see) to ethical analyses of partic- ular animal biotechnological prac- tices. The Cultural Community Life. The in- terplay of particularity and universal- ity (as well as plurality and monism, to which it is related) in ethical response to animal use and biotechnology is taken to a new level in cultural activi- ties and traditions, including religion, art, and philosophy. For it is in these spheres of human activity that ques- tions of ultimate meaning or signifi- cance regarding humans, animals, and nature are explicitly addressed and systematically explored, if not conclu- sively answered. Moreover, the values involved are not exclusively or nar- rowly ethical, but are also religious, aesthetic, philosophical (ontologi- cal), and other. It is from broadly religious, aes- thetic, and philosophic-ethical per- spectives that animal biotechnology is most searchingly questioned, again with a full range of ethical responses, pro and con.55 From religious perspec- tives, whether theistic or atheistic, is there a goodness to natural crea- tion-to the very being and dynamic interplay of human, animal, and ecosystemic life-that is violated or threatened by certain uses of animals and biotechnological interventions? Does the evolving natural world har- bor its own value-laden originality and cosmically dramatic story? Is there a certain religiously significant integrity or oneness to human in- dividuals and communities, to animal life (individuals, social groups, and species), and to habitats, ecosystems, and evolutionary processes that bears protection from certain biotechno- logical practices?56" The answers are as many as there are different cultural, religious, and philosophic perspectives-each char- acteristically aiming at a compre- hensive world vision and interpreta- tion, each expressing its own particu- larities and valuational emphases. Each perspective dwells within the world of human experience in a different way. Some argue for a signif- icant human discontinuity with the rest of nature. They claim nature's amorality, valuelessness, and pur- poselessness, including that of bio- logical and animal life, and assert humans' rightful and pragmatic do- minion over nature and animals. Everything is permitted if it does not practically undermine nature or morally diminish human significance. Other perspectives find decidedly less distance between humans and the rest of nature. They encounter a na- ture that harbors its own specific goodness, values, and purposive agents, animals in particular. They propose a human relation to nature that involves caring stewardship, if not outright recognition of radical moral and religious equality among all creaturely beings." In these latter perspectives, many animal uses and biotechnological interventions ethi- cally are ruled out and not only be- cause they diminish human moral significance. They are claimed to mar or violate natural creation itself.58 What are we to make of this plural- ity of religious and philosophic per- spectives and visions that stand in ten- sion, if not direct conflict with one another? First, these are the fun- damental cultural, religious, and moral orientations by which human individuals and communities live. They are not to be lightly dismissed in ethically weighing the appropriate- ness of animal biotechnological prac- tices. As we shall recurrently note, what might be ethically legitimate in one cultural community might be ethically illegitimate for another com- munity, beyond all questions of ani- mal welfare. Moreover, though the "ultimate" answers are many and by necessity speculative and tentative, the under- lying questions are legitimate and in- creasingly urgent.

What is our own human significance in the natural scheme of things, our own limitations moral and otherwise, and our proper relation to the wider ani- mate realm within which we find our- selves? Ethically and religiously, how ought we to fit in? Nature. Nature in a very real sense is a domain of human activity, though it is most adequately understood as a domain within which various human activities take place and toward which activities are often directed. The domain itself, at least aboriginally, is not human. Moreover, the human ac- tivities undertaken are those of the spheres just described, with their characteristic perspectives, valua- tions, world views, and moral aspira- tions. Consider scientific and bio- medical researchers, economic entre- preneurs, hikers, climbers, hunt- ers/fishermen, ecotourists, philos- ophers, theologians, poets, artists, and others. Each goes into the natu- ral world animated by different mo- tives, expectations, and reasons. Each discovers there a goodness that is in- trinsic to the human-nature interac- tion or instrumental to some other human good.59 The multiple significance of nature for humans (which no doubt is in- fluenced by cultural traditions) defies reduction to any single domain of human activity. In a crucial sense na- ture is the all-inclusive domain of domains, the context of contexts. All specific human activities take place within, if they do not directly respond to the natural world. Nature as the environing reality or setting of human activity has a special signifi- cance for contextual moral ecology and thus the scrutiny of animal bio- technologies. Nature, amidst ulti- mate things human, is what finally must be protected.6? technology and its own dominant ethical perspectives and practical val- uations, pro or con. Yet none exists in human or cultural isolation, alone by itself, sovereign lord over its own domain. Rather, each sphere has a moral stake in the others, which is more or less weighty. With particular animal biotechnological practices, whatever the specific context, all ethi- cally relevant things need to be con- sidered. This consideration may de- cidedly encompass the concerns of other spheres of human activity, if not also the full fabric of the environ- ing human community and natural world.61 In short, we must conjoin wide- ranging or systemic concerns for humans and nature with ineradicably plural moral and cultural values. This is why we must develop a nuanced art of ethical analysis and decision- making that incorporates notions of contextual plural obligations and moral ecology.62 In any one context of animal biotechnological use, all the relevant domains of activity, values, and ethical obligations need to be heard. Yet no one constituency, value, or obligation can a priori be allowed to dominate the others. No one "ethical interest group" ought to hold hostage the legitimate ethical in- terests (welfare, respect, or other) of the plural others. Each practical pro- vincial context, with its own domi- nant, pressing, and legitimate ethical claims, whether pertaining to humans, animals, or wider nature, helps to de- termine the relative weighting, bal- ance, or coordination of the many and perhaps rival ethical values and obligations. This is the final moral judgment that recognizes the ethi- cally legitimate claims of a plurality of culturally embedded spheres of human activity. It aims at the strong moral harmony of a Heraclitus, born of ethical elements interlocked, in tension with one another. The practical art of contextual analysis and moral ecology, the actual process of ethical decisionmaking, faces several outstanding philosophic or theoretical c-zllenges. These in- clude what guides the overall contex- tual coordination, the relative ethical significance or weight of animals and nature, and who decides these issues. These still unsettled questions will be discussed presently. Here we briefly look at animal biotechnological in- terventions in different contexts and spheres of human activity to see how contextually determined plural ob- ligations might play themselves out in practice. Transgenic Animals and "Wild Na- ture." From the early days of biotech- nology and the fashioning of trans- genic organisms, a major ethical concern has been the purposeful in- troduction or unintended escape of bioengineered organisms into natu- ral, humanly uncontrolled habitats and ecosystems.63 Will the novel or- ganisms wreak ecological havoc, un- dermine the dynamic stability of hab- itats, and set off destructive chain-re- actions throughout resident popula- tions of animals and other or- ganisms? The fear is of negative sys- temic effects that would practically undermine the well-being of both humans and the natural world. The immediately relevant critical ques- tions are: Do we know the effects of such introductions? Can we predict them? Can we control them? Rea- sonable doubts on any of these ques- tions counsel practical and ethical caution. Only the most weighty ob- ligations to humans would justify countering this caution, if the risks are truly considerable and systemic. The Achilles heel of the ethical deci- sionmaking is our endemic ignor- ance of causes and effects when it comes to the flourishing of natural ecosystems. Yet in this context the ethical weight decidedly should be with concerns for nature and the multiple significance of nature for humans, rather than more parochial and forgoable human interests. Take the case of experimentally de- signing transgenic fish, for example, carp, trout, and salmon.64 The mo- tives for such interventions might be complex: economic, recreational, or preservationist. The practice might serve fish farming (faster-growing fish, with a better and more standard quality of meat). Beyond economi- cally entrepreneurial aspirations, the Contextual Obligations and Moral Ecology Each sphere of human activity has its own particular stake in animal bio- S19</page><page sequence="20">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 technology might answer the press- ing nutritional requirements of local human communities or the protec- tion of rapidly dwindling, if not en- dangered wild fish stocks. (This is a worldwide crisis already upon us.) Or the transgenesis might produce fish better adapted to polluted or re- gional aquatic habitats than their wild counterparts and with qualities at- tractive to sport fishermen (gulli- bility, size, or fighting ability). Here long-range, morally ecologi- cal thinking is crucial. We may easily dismiss the putative "needs" of sport fishermen and economic entre- preneurs. It is less easy to counter genuine nutritional requirements of human populations and the protec- tion of wild fish stocks and aquatic food chains. Yet issues of escapement and exotic species introduction im- portantly haunt the moral ecology. The genetic or behavioral qualities of transgenic fish introduced or escaped into the wild might under- mine the very wild stocks and habitats that they were meant to preserve, to the long-term detriment or im- poverishment of both humans and nature.65 (This is not to mention the problems of environmental pollution engendered by fish farming.) But this is not all. There is the more elusive, less urgently practical, but fundamental cultural issue for which we need the ethical reservations of natural preservationists, philoso- phers, and theologians. By practicing transgenesis in the wild, do we or do we not break into natural processes that are good in themselves and that hold an ultimate significance (cultur- ally, religiously, ethically) for many, if not most of us? This is nature en- gendering its own, more or less well- adapted biological creations-in- dividuals, species, and ecosystems-- the animate and animal issue of evo- lutionary and ecological processes. How important is it for us humanly, culturally, and ethically to protect, within the overall mandates of plural moral obligations, "original nature" and its still originating or creative dy- namism?66 All these pragmatic and moral fac- tors, human and natural, must be relatively weighted in ethically decid- ing the role that animal biotech- nology ought to play in the wild. TransgenicAnimals, Biomedicine, and Scientific Research. The plural values and obligations relating to humans, animals, and nature that arise in ethi- cally considering animal biotech- nology in the wild also surface in scientific and biomedical laboratory settings. But in shifting the scene of scrutiny, the constellation and rela- tive weightings of the values and ob- ligations may change significantly as well. Typically, practical ethical con- cerns for nature-for wild animal populations, habitats, and ecosys- tems-fade into the moral back- ground. We may still be seriously con- cerned with the genetic (genomic), bodily, and behavioral intactness of individual animals, but these con- cerns are now dominantly conjoined with issues of animals' experiential welfare and the possible benefits of the biotechnological interventions for basic science and fundamental human welfare, particularly the alle- viation of suffering. All things consid- ered, we might allow biotech- nological interventions in "con- trolled" laboratory settings that we would deny in the wild. This shift, be- yond pragmatically determined con- siderations, is importantly due to the dominant values and moral impera- tives of scientific and biomedical ac- tivity: human (and animal) welfare, the relief of suffering and physiologi- cal distress, and the pursuit of basic knowledge about ourselves and the natural world. Thus we might ethi- cally condone the transgenic produc- tion of Oncomouse, Cystic Fibrosis mouse, and Memory mouse (under- taken to facilitate the study of fun- damental memory and learning pro- cesses). The decision would depend on the importance of the scientific project's purpose, amidst all other things that need to be considered. The further considerations in- volve the legitimate stakes of the other realms of human activity, with their own ethical mandates, in bio- medical and scientific research. From our participation in private life and webs of intimate personal relations involving both humans and animals comes an insistence on attention to the welfare of individual animals, with a minimization of suffering in research protocols and care settings as is appropriate to legitimate scien- tific goals. From public political ethics comes the ethical demand that there be a '"just and fair" proportion between the overall benefits to be gained and the harms (especially suffering) to be inflicted, with a max- imization of the former relative to a minimization of the latter. From the cultural and natural preservationists and others responsible for protecting ultimate values (finally all of us) comes a serious questioning of the admissibility of the intervention and research: whether it is ethically out-of- bounds with regard to violating the animal's individual or species integri- ty or inflicting significant suffering, no matter what the benefits envi- sioned.67 These are the characteristic de- mands that are placed on animal care and use committees in their review of research and educational protocols. The scrutiny is only exacerbated by animal biotechnological innovations. The chief "novel" issues concern ani- mal welfare and animal integrity. How can researchers, laboratory technicians, and animal caretakers know their animals and promote their well-being or welfare if a new strain or species of animal has been created with altered and perhaps un- precedented behavioral habits? And how is animal integrity-that which might be inadmissibly violated-to be understood? Is it the intactness of the animals' genetic or genomic struc- ture and functionings, or bodily structure or functionings, or be- havioral, social, and "worldly" habits? Or are these all dimensions of animal integrity, however difficult to define adequately? These particular hazards of animal research ethics and protocol review are only highlighted by animal bio- technology and transgenic innova- tions. They do not change the fun- damental nature of an ethical deci- sionmaking that must be contextual. In particular, no ethical value or ob- ligation can have an absolute or final precedence over the others. Given the plurality of ultimate and fun- damental values, there can be no principled "trumping" of one value over the others. Rather, there must be a contextually defined and propor- tionate coordination of obligations. For example, religious objections to S20</page><page sequence="21">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 How important is it for us to protect, within the overall mandates of plural moral obligations, "original nature" and its still originating or creative dynamism? tampering with natural creation can- not by themselves block the creation of Oncomouse or CF mouse, with the anticipated benefits to human wel- fare and scientific knowledge. On the other hand, given deeply ingrained cultural or religious habits (which themselves may change over time), what might be ethically tolerable or even mandated in one local human community with respect to science and biomedicine may be inadmis- sible in another.68 Presumably one would not transgenically manipulate a sacred animal or plant of an in- digenous culture, for example, cows in the more traditionally Hindu re- gions of India. This only underscores the cultural and social embedded- ness of all scientific research and medicine and the fact that human welfare concerns and a thirst for knowledge do not always take prece- dence over other humanly or natu- rally important values. Animal Biotechnology, Economic Markets, and Agribusiness. The do- mains of scientific and biotechno- logical research, biomedicine, and economic activity increasingly over- lap and shade off into one another. The creation of mice, goats, and other animals that produce easily re- trievable pharmaceutical products such as human insulin or t-PA at once serve significant human welfare needs and economic, entrepreneur- ial goals. We move away from such immediate health care concerns and attendant ethical obligations when we come to potentially lucrative bovine somatotropin (BST) boosted cows, growth hormone primed pigs, and the aquatic factory farming of transgenic fish.69 As we traverse this spectrum, pressing human welfare obligations often recede, and the morally ecological analyses of the an- imal biotechnological practices sig- nificantly and complexly change. An- imal welfare and human social/cul- tural factors come more to the fore. The Beltsville pig, genetically fash- ioned for cost-efficient growth rates and feed consumption and for the leaner quality of its meat, proved to be severely compromised by arthritis and multiple other diseases. All par- ties, including the scientific animal production community, consider this an unfortunate ethical misadventure. There remains, however, the biotech- nologists' expectant hope that the an- imal welfare issues can be overcome and that a new generation of en- gineered "food animals" will be more ethically acceptable. (But what ethi- cal price would have to be paid, in terms of renewed biotechnological interventions, to overcome the ethi- cal harm?) Similarly there are animal welfare concerns for the BST cows, though immediate animal suffering or harm seems much less acute, and ethical attention is more on the ef- fects of intensifying factory-farming practices. Beyond heightened concern for animal welfare and unjustifiable suf- fering, the economic boosters of ani- mal biotechnology, whether from agribusiness or pharmaceutical in- dustries, meet an interesting and com- plex social and cultural resistance. Small dairy farmers complain that the "big business" of BST-boosted cows will hasten the demise of family farms and local rural traditions. Others ob- ject to the "pollution" of milk with the bovine growth hormone. Still others challenge the patenting and econom- ic commodification of animals: the conceptual reduction of their status as genuine living beings, aboriginally the creation of nature and unowned by humans, to mere configurations of living matter instrumentally at the disposal of humans for their own self- interested purposes, economic or other.70 Whatever the actual saliency of these ethical charges and critiques, obviously fundamental social, cul- tural, and religious values are at stake, arising out of broad cultural tradi- tions and interests. Animal biotech- nology, coupled to the engines of cor- porate economics, is felt to threaten fundamental and traditional moral, religious, and cultural orientations. Again this poses an important chal- lenge to a morally ecological analysis of animal biotechnologies, in the context of economic activity and else- where. There may be certain human communities or cultures in which an- imal biotechnological practices, even for the best human welfare reasons, are considered morally inadmissable. This raises important social or cul- tural justice issues on an interna- tional scale as biotechnology's prov- ince becomes increasingly global. Ar- guably, local cultural communities ought to decide whether they wish to participate in the enterprise and benefits of animal and wider biotech- nology, irrespective of the insistent pressures of global economic markets and more narrowly defined inter- national issues of economic justice.71 (For example, who should economi- cally benefit from the genetic re- sources, natural or "artificed," that are swept up into international bio- technological-economic activity?) On the other hand, what should the moral ecology be when cultural or religious objections come from a minority within a wider and culturally diverse community, such as the United States and many other coun- tries? Granted, social, cultural, and community considerations ought to receive serious attention, especially in relation to optional or forgoable economic practices. But again, with a plurality of moral obligations, no sphere of human activity and no ethical interest group can be al- lowed to override the legitimate ethical interests of the plural others. What then should be done? How do we reach an ethically adequate ac- commodation between rival values and ethical obligations and their human advocates? This question re- mains at the core of moral ecology's unfinished business. S21</page><page sequence="22">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 Moral Ecology's Landscape: The Outstanding Issues We have been arguing that the ethi- cal consideration of animal biotech- nologies defies any easy solution or subsumption under a "mono-valued" ethical system. There are too many different interventions in too many different contexts involving too many different motives, values, and ethical obligations.7 Yet the call for a contex- tual consideration of plural obliga- tions and moral ecology decidedly implies a coordination of disparate and perhaps conflicting values and obligations within and between specific contexts. We require system- atic ethical responses that genuinely recognize the plural value and ethical dimensions of our worldly existence. How do we square this circle, which is demanded by our overall responsi- bilities to humans, animals, and na- ture? How should such practical deci- sions be substantively guided? This is an outstanding and unsettled issue. Yet we may begin to see our way. The first clues come from the sheer plurality of practices, contexts, values, and obligations themselves. This con- stitutes concrete and experientially incontestable evidence of the plural and complex goodness of human ex- istence. Moreover, the goodness of both humans and nature is vulnera- ble to change and various harms. We must become ethically committed, as an overarching and fundamental moral duty, to this plurality itself: to upholding and promoting the vari- ous abiding and culturally significant spheres of human activity amidst the ecosystemic life and animate world in which they are embedded.73 Herein is the second set of clues: the spheres or domains of human ac- tivity interpenetrate one another, and there are contexts within wider con- texts within still wider contexts of ac- tivity and moral significance. Ethical atomism or provincialism is practi- cally impossible and ethically ir- responsible. Rather we must concur- rently pursue the human, animal, and natural good. First and foremost we must prevent the significant under- mining of any one domain or sphere of activity, human or natural, for the sake of others. This involves a mutual commitment, sensitivity, and con- cern among different human actors with various contextually defined al- legiances. Such coordination re- quires a mutual accommodation without forgoing fundamental value and ethical commitments. We must fashion an ethically and publicly re- sponsible life that is broadly "cosmo- politan. " Such a cosmopolitan and contex- tual ethics cannot be rationalist or universalist in a traditional sense, that is, involve principled logical argu- ments from first moral premises. Rather its "reasonable connections" must be more ethical-aesthetic. Its modes of thought must be more in keeping with the informal reasoning and moral art of the private realm of intimate relations, which must take in whole webs of life and multiple moral considerations at once. In short, moral ecology deals with complex wholes. The identification of what morally needs to be taken into ac- count is only a first step. The coordi- nation of the obligations is the sec- ond and more difficult step. Yet the two steps are intimately and substan- tively conjoined. The first sets up the initial moral landscape: the moral goods and obligations that need to be upheld and protected, whether they pertain to humans, animals, or na- ture. The consequent moral coordi- nation is protectionist or conser- vationist in character. It accepts the obligations as given and asks which are most seriously threatened and most in need of protection or promo- tion in the particular context at hand. For example, in the context of the wild, long-term concerns for nature take precedence over human aspira- tions, unless significant human needs or values are at stake with ecologically acceptable costs to natural systems. In the laboratory, serious threats to ethical obligations to human welfare and the pursuit of knowledge take precedence, unless other overriding threats supervene, for example, the possible escape of environmentally damaging organisms, dispropor- tionate and inadmissible animal suffering, or the undermining of cen- tral cultural or religious values of the surrounding human community. In short, moral ecology, exercised in particular contexts, is rationally ruled by an unwavering response to the most serious threats to well-estab- lished moral allegiances and by a long-term ethical commitment to the plural good of humans and nature in their intimate interconnections. But even if we could adequately see our way through these methodologi- cal and epistemological problems of establishing priorities of ethical con- cern and obligation, we face another problem. Is this commitment to the coordination of plural activities, values, and obligations practically re- alistic or an impossible dream, given the aggressive disharmony inherently spawned by ethical and political plu- ralism itself and the dynamic nature of humans' worldly life? History, re- cent or past, is sobering. Yet the world's dynamic becoming, which will not be rationally, technologically, politically, or ethically subdued, pre- sents a way out of political, ethical, and cultural impasses. Different cul- tures and different domains of human activity can over time grow to- gether, at least in understanding if not also in practice. This requires both mutual appreciation and mutual criticism as a way of moving toward a more adequate and ethical flourishing within and between par- ticular spheres of activity and human cultures. On the one hand, this attempt would directly address issues of so- cial and cultural justice and the question of who should decide the ethical admissibility or inadmissibility of animal biotechnologies in differ- ent geopolitical contexts. In our com- mitment to the plural good, fun- damental cultural and moral orienta- tions should prevail over forgoable human welfare and global economic concerns. In short, particular cul- tures should be mutually appreciated and honored.74 Yet these same cul- tural and value perspectives ought ongoingly to inform and mutually criticize one another about what is of abiding worth and truly enlists our ethical responsibility given present world conditions: that is, those human and natural individuals, com- munities, and activities that most cen- trally command our ethical attention. This is the dynamic growth-philo- sophic, ethical, religious, cultural, and political-made possible by the interconnected becoming of the S22</page><page sequence="23">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 Nature is no realm of essentialist perfection. world. In the end, it is the dynami- cally systemic or interactive character of worldly reality that allows for the practical coordinations of plural values and obligations-coordina- tions that will perhaps always be more imperfectly existential than perfectly rational.75 The Goodness and Significance of Na- ture and Animal Life. Given humans' newly emerging and insistent re- sponsibilities for biological life, ecosystems, and the environment, nowhere is "mutual appreciation and criticism" more globally and region- ally needed than in trying to ferret out the meaning, significance, and goodness of animate life and evolu- tionary and ecological processes.76 (As we have seen, this is crucial to the various contextual ethical analyses of animal biotechnologies.) For such an understanding we need to bring together thinkers from various spheres of scientific and cultural ac- tivity: evolutionary biologists, animal researchers, anthropologists, philos- ophers, theologians, and others with a central stake in the multileveled sig- nificance of nature. A serious mutual confrontation of these plural areas of disciplined thought and activity pro- mises philosophical and ethical ad- vances. For example, more traditional phi- losophers or theologians, committed to long-dominant modes of essential- ist thinking, might see the signifi- cance of nature and animal species as arising from (or grounded in) atem- poral and unchanging Platonic "ideas" (for example, the archetypal form 'horse'). Or they might might appeal to Aristotlean "substantial forms" (the 'formal plan' of develop- ment into an adult horse, perhaps an unintended adumbration of 'genom- ic information') or a once-and-for-all creation ex nihilo by a transcendent deity. This is how traditional modes of thinking typically account for the de- finite character, integrity, and good- ness of nature's animate beings. Such traditional perspectives might (or might not) ethically counsel against modern forms of genetic tinkering, transgenesis, and the confounding of the eternal order of creation. But contemporary molecular and evolutionary biologists would unite in contending that an essentialist ex- planation and interpretation of the animal and animate world is funda- mentally flawed." Biological species arise and pass in dynamic evolution- ary and ecological process. Thanks to random genetic variation (via genetic mutation and sexual reproduction) and natural selection, species diver- sify and evolve out of their biological predecessors, sharing and recon- figuring genetic information. More- over, nature is no realm of essentialist perfection. Rather, our biosphere is an extraordinary, historically particu- lar, and "chaotically orderly" realm of dynamic and systematically related "imperfections": individual organ- isms more or less well-adapted to worldly life; populational species of such individuals more or less well- adapted to ever-changing ecological niches; and ecosystems themselves more or less internally robust and dy- namically viable, while changing in evolutionary/ecological time. This by now well-founded and in- contestible general evolutionary and ecological perspective does not annihilate the questions of natural goodness and integrity posed by traditional philosophers and theolo- gians. It only defeats and renders ob- solete essentialist modes of naturalis- tic thinking and philosophic inter- pretation. The natural goodness and integrity of biological individuals and species, as well as ecosystems, only need a new and more philosophically nuanced interpretation. Individual organisms still present themselves as having a lively integrity, intactness, or "oneness" that encompasses bodily, subjective, behavioral, and outwardly social functionings that are more or less flexibly adapted to an active, if vulnerable life in the world. Species as populations of biological indi- viduals exhibit a spatiotemporally bounded and flexible integrity rela- tive to some ecological niche, also changing. Moreover, species evolve in a creative, though orderly fashion, ac- cording to relatively few generic or- ganic or bodily Bauplne.78 Finally, the habitats and ecosystems themselves evidence a flexible and dynamic in- tactness with respect to internal sta- bility and species diversification, more or less vulnerable to outside, wider ecosystemic processes or forces.7 No doubt these several senses of 'integrity'-individual, species, and ecosystemic-require further and careful conceptual and philosophic articulation and systematic coordina- tion. Moreover, we will need further collaborative efforts in appreciating the full significance and goodness of the individuals, species, and ecosys- tems of the animate realm. But such an enterprise should only ethically and practically serve us well. It would further and more clearly reveal the complex meanings of "nature natu- ral" for us humans. It would help us discern what the limits of our bio- technological and other human in- terventions in the wild ought to be and what needs to be ethically pro- tected in scientific and biomedical re- search and economic activity. For ex- ample, a more adequate under- standing of animal integrity might shift attention away from putative species-specific genes to the systemic effects of genetic manipulations on the phenotypical or somatic expres- sions of genomes and the functional, behavioral, and experiential well- being of individual animals. With re- spect to the animal's overall organic integrity, certain manipulations may appear inconsequential, others not. This is what should significantly in- form particular ethical deliberations of IACUCs and others. Moreover we would better under- stand ourselves and our embedded existence in an animate nature that is ultimately significant, yet imperfectly good: that we and animate nature are not to be perfected, but that the world's evolving complex and finite S23</page><page sequence="24">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 goodness-the various dimensions of activity and value realized by humans and other organisms-is to be un- equivocally affirmed and ethically protected. In short, a speculative, disciplined advance in our understanding and assessment of the multileveled worth of nature would help us in the ethical coordinations required by our con- textual plural obligations. Though in themselves such an understanding and assessment do not uniquely de- termine the outcome (positive or negative) of moral deliberations in different contexts, they would better inform us when it is ethically appro- priate to move biotechnologically for- ward and when to take ethically pro- tective stands. We would better know how to integrate our humanly cul- tural, technological, and natural selves and how practically to fit our human communities within the wider natural and animate world. --StrachanDonnelley, with the collaboration ofLilly-Marlene Russow, John Kleinig and Roger Balk 3. Developing Policies and Regulations for Animal Biotechnology and the Protection of the Environment A cynical joke perennially circu- lates among government regulators. One regulator says to another, "Your new regulations have pleased no one. All interested parties are complaining bitterly. Congratulations! You must have gotten it right." A similar but less cynical view of the role of the regula- tor is expressed in the metaphor that likens a regulator to a ship's captain who finds himself in dense fog while navigating a narrow channel. The captain says, "The fog prevents us from seeing either side of the chan- nel; nevertheless, when the noise of the surf crashing on the starboard shoals equals the noise of the surf crashing on the leeward shoals, we as- sume that we are safely in mid-chan- nel." These stories illustrate the difficulty associated with the development of public policy or regulations in a democratic context. Policymakers and regulators must function in the context of a political "fog"; they are nearly always called upon to establish restrictive interventions pertaining to controversial public issues before they have sufficient information to defend the policy against all rea- sonable objections. Although they are obliged to take into account the best available data, they know that, in most cases, to wait until sufficient evi- dence is collected to support one course of regulatory action over another beyond a reasonable doubt is tantamount to waiting until a poten- tially harmful outcome is irreversible. Policymakers can take some comfort in the fact that as the knowledge base on which the policy or regulation rests expands, and as experience in administering the policy accumu- lates, the potential for improving the policy is enhanced. Policymakers and regulators also know that policies and regulations which prohibit or constrain any sig- nificant human activity inevitably pro- duce controversy. Beyond the fact that policies and regulations ought to be based on the best, albeit in- complete, information available, successful policies must be supported or at least tolerated by all affected seg- ments of the regulated population. Furthermore, positive endorsement by a critical mass of the regulated public is also essential. If broad ac- ceptance and some positive endorse- ment are lacking, a policy or regula- tion will often be opposed, ignored or circumvented. Enforcement will be difficult or impossible. Successful policies and regulations nearly always reflect a compromise position that partially satisfies all affected parties but seldom fully satisfies any of them. Ignorant, maladroit, or unenforce- able policies and regulations, as well as those that are subject to ridicule or evasion, are positively harmful be- cause they undermine the structures of the society that promulgated them. Bad environmental policies and regu- lations not only undermine the moral fiber of society, they contribute to, or at least do not prevent, the deteriora- tion of the planet itself as well. In practice, policymakers and regu- lators are asked to satisfy two goals that are seldom fully compatible and indeed often conflict with each other: (1) to promote the commonweal on the basis of the best available data; and (2) to satisfy, at least partially, two or more divergent (and often oppos- ing) views of what the policy ought to be. Policymakers and regulators usu- ally try to satisfy both of these goals by proceeding in serial manner to enable the policy to approach, in asymptotic fashion, an ideal outcome. In the first stage the policy or regula- tion is proposed. The initial proposal is based on the best available data and the regulator's best judgment as to what the policy or regulation ought to be. Evidence in support of the pro- posal must be clearly presented. In this first stage, little effort is made to accommodate views of opposing fac- tions. Rather, the policymaker or reg- ulator strives to come as close to an ideal policy as possible. Reaction to the proposal is aggres- sively sought from all interested par- ties, and thoughtful criticism is en- couraged.s Major policies and regu- lations are often accompanied by public hearings and development of a written record. It is important that affected parties be allowed to provide additional data, if any, that may sup- port changes in the proposed policy. It is even more important that af- fected parties feel they have partici- pated in a fair process and be given an opportunity to "own" or endorse the final policy. If public comment is skillfully elic- ited, opposing views and political cur- rents will be brought to attention. Hidden agendas will be subjected to the scrutiny of opposing arguments. If any relevant data were not consid- ered or were improperly weighted in the original proposal, critics can be counted on to call this to the atten- tion of the policymakers. In the second stage, the draft regu- lations are revised to accommodate, so far as possible, the widest spectrum of views concerning the proposed policy. Accommodation requires S24</page><page sequence="25">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 Effective policies and regulations must be designed to respect competing systems of ethics and competing interpretations of the facts. compromise, and compromise fre- quently means a departure from an ideal. Depending on the degree of compromise, the policy or regulation can then be: (a) withdrawn; (b) mod- ified and reproposed; or (c) modified and promulgated in final form. If the policy is withdrawn, the effort to develop a sound policy or regulation must be started de novo. If it is re- proposed, the public comment process must be repeated. Even if the policy is promulgated in final form, it should be reviewed from time to time, and when appropriate, the process should begin all over again. Norms for Successful Policymaking Effective policies and regulations must be based on the collection of all available relevant data. One impor- tant facet of successful policymaking is to build into the policy or the regu- lation the requirement for a data col- lection program that will make it possible to evaluate and improve the policy or regulation at a future time. Evaluation data must be collected in a way that will be both illuminating and minimally burdensome. An im- portant step in producing a workable regulation is bringing opposing par- ties to agreement on (a) what data ought to be collected and (b) in what form and at what intervals it is to be reported. Effective policies must be broad enough to cover all of the involved parties. For example, with respect to animal biotechnology, it would make little sense to restrict American in- dustrialists and scientists from intro- ducing genetically altered species of fish into the Pacific Ocean if Canadian industrialists were not sub- ject to the same restrictions. Con- sequently the policy or regulation must emanate from a high enough level of government or from several governments cooperating so as to ac- complish the purposes of the policy. International policies and regula- tions must seek cooperation from all affected national, regional, and local authorities. Effective policies and regulations must be designed to respect compet- ing systems of ethics and competing interpretations of the facts. Failure to acknowledge and to accommodate values held by all sides is to invite widespread opposition to the policy or regulation and to set the stage for its defeat or to invite noncompliance on the part of those who are opposed. Effective policies and regulations pertaining to the protection of ani- mals in natural environments must take into account the best available data concerning the well-being of the animals. Equally important, policies must take into account differing cul- tural attitudes and ethical positions toward animals and toward the en- vironment. If opposing attitudes are not acknowledged, opposition to the policy or regulation will quickly crys- talize. Expected cultural and economic impacts of the policy must be square- ly faced. If life-styles must be mod- ified for the policy to be enforced, this fact should be bluntly stated. Hardships and losses that will result from the policy must, so far as pos- sible, be anticipated and balanced against benefits. Great care must be taken to state expected positive and negative effects of the policy accu- rately. If some effects are not known, the absence of critical knowledge should be publicly declared. To pre- dict the future with great confi- dence unsupported by clear data and to overstate expected benefits or understate harms may under- mine an otherwise acceptable ini- tial policy or regulation. Policies and regulations pertaining to animals in the natural environment must be systemic. That is to say, they should not only take into account what seems to be best for the animals and their environment, but must also address or accommodate ethical values, cultural attitudes, economic concerns, and social consequences. Narrowly conceived environmental policies are almost certainly destined to fail because the short-term harms they cause will be perceived to out- weigh the (longer-term) benefits. Environmental policies and regula- tions must address provisions to off- set harms or hardships caused by the policy. If life-styles, jobs, food, homes, or industries are threatened by the policy or regulation, then efforts must be made to replace what is lost or to compensate for the harms. Al- though the common good sought by the policy or regulation may justify the harms caused by it, any regula- tory process will fail if it is not per- ceived to be fairly conducted and if harms are not frankly acknowledged and mitigated or compensated. Sound education programs must accompany policies and regulations, particularly those pertaining to ani- mals and to the environment."8 All af- fected parties must be helped to un- derstand, not only that their cultural and ethical values will be, at least par- tially, supported by the final policy, but that the policymakers had to make provision for different or op- posing cultures and values as well. All parties must understand that the policy is an impartial compromise that fully satisfies no single faction. Failure to carry out the educational dimension of policymaking is to risk charges of bias and favoritism that generate mistrust. Successful policy- making can rarely be accomplished in the face of widespread public mis- trust; education is the best antidote. Regulations should be issued at levels of government that have suffi- cient jurisdiction to accomplish the desired regulatory purposes. The regulations should be issued with the greatest simplicity consistent with the matters to be regulated. Policies and Regulation Governing Transgenic Animals At the present time the number of laboratories, worldwide, producing transgenic animals is probably a little more than 100. This number is steadily increasing-a skilled staff S25</page><page sequence="26">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 using approximately $50,000 worth of equipment can accomplish gene modification or gene transfer from one species of animal to another. The process is tedious, costly, and labor intensive. Nevertheless it is often pre- ferred over selective breeding be- cause it can be accomplished (1) faster than selective breeding; (2) without the transfer of unwanted ge- netic materials; (3) at less overall cost than selective breeding; (4) with greater precision than selective breeding; and (5) between widely divergent species that cannot be com- bined by selective breeding.82 At the present time gene transfer from one species to another appears to be limited to single genes. Gene transfer often involves transfer of a human gene-perhaps defective-to animals in order to create an animal model for the study of human dis- ease. Sometimes the term 'trans- genic' is used to mean the "knock- out" technique described above in which an animal's own gene is ren- dered inoperative in order to mimic a human genetic disease or disorder.83 Assuming that techniques for gene transfer are confined to single genes, it follows that such transfers-even if they should involve insertion of up to twenty such genes--would constitute only a tiny proportion of the 50 to 100 thousand genes found in mammals. Thus transgenic manipulation does not-in the near future at least-- raise the specter of creating animals that are human-like. Presently in the United States, ani- mal biotechnology, including trans- genic animals, is regulated under a variety of federal guidelines, policies, and statutes that pertain to uses of animals in general.84 However, there are gaps in oversight due in part to whether the particular methods are publicly or privately funded.85 Animal biotechnology in scientific laborato- ries comes under National Institutes of Health guidelines for recombinant DNA research and United States De- partment of Agriculture and Public Health Service supervision of animal welfare.86 The USDA and the Food and Drug Administration monitor genetically altered livestock, food animals, and other foodstuffs, as well as pharmaceutical products en- gendered by bioengineering. This Transfer to humans of animal genes in such a way that human germ cells might be altered should be strictly prohibited. complex patchwork of regulatory oversight, with its gaps, focuses mainly on issues of human, animal, and environmental welfare rather than other cultural values and ethical obligations. Regulation of Transgenic Research Animals Regulation of the care and use of transgenic research animals can best be accomplished at the national level. Because of the high cost of producing these animals and the sophistication of laboratories that produce them, international regu- lation of transgenic animals appears to be unrealistic at the present time. Developed nations in which the capability for creating transgenic animals exists would be certain to resist international regulation of their domestic laboratories. Nevertheless, a "lead nation" inter- national approach seems to be feasible. This would require one na- tion, such as the United States, Australia, or the Netherlands, to issue a set of regulations governing the use of transgenic animals. The "lead nation" would then be in a position to encourage and pressure other devel- oped nations to impose identical or similar regulations in laboratories in their countries. For the most part, the regulation of transgenic animals ought to be simi- lar to the regulations that pertain to the humane care and use of other laboratory animals. However, several additional protections should be con- sidered. First, since the animals may develop traits that are uncharacteris- tic of other individuals of the species, the animals must be carefully ob- served for signs of pain, distress, or suffering. If such symptoms are dis- covered, every effort must be made to find ways to minimize or alleviate them. The practice of sound animal husbandry to promote healthy, con- tented animals (including transgenic animals) for all research purposes is required by policy or regulation in most developed nations. Sound ani- mal care may be more difficult to pro- vide for transgenic animals because their natural history is not well estab- lished. Consequently more observa- tion and, if need be, additional proce- dures to insure the comfort of trans- genic animals may be required. Transgenic animals may require more intense care than that provided for other animals, but it need not be different in kind.87 Second, if animals are produced that are chronically distressed or in pain, then, absent a strong case to the contrary, regulations should require that the animals be humanely killed and not produced again.88 Third, although there is little possi- bility that such animals could survive outside the laboratory, regulations must insure that precautions will be taken against inadvertently releasing genetically altered animals into the environment.89 Fourth, the transfer of animal genes to humans should not be per- mitted unless the specific research protocol has received careful public scrutiny from a responsible public board or commission that has con- sidered the matter in depth. At the present time it is not clear whether it is unethical to engage in such prac- tices. Transfer of animal tissue to humans has been widely considered to be ethically acceptable for more than a generation, though some members of society are adamantly op- posed to such tissue transfer. Greater public uneasiness seems to be as- sociated with transfer of animal genes to human beings. Concerns cluster around the ethics of "altering human nature." Until this ethical issue is clarified on a case by case basis, such practice should not be allowed. A for- tiori, transfer to humans of animal S26</page><page sequence="27">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 genes in such a way that human germ cells might be altered should be strictly prohibited. Regulation of Transgenic Agricultural Animals As is the case for laboratory ani- mals, the regulation of transgenic an- imals raised to produce food and fiber can best be accomplished at a national level. Such animals ought to meet essentially the same standards as those already required for farm an- imals. That is to say, transgenic agri- cultural animals should not be pro- duced if they are chronically dis- tressed or if they cannot be main- tained at a level of comfort similar to that of other well cared for animals of their species. The lead nation concept, discussed above, appears to be as appropriate for regulation of transgenic agricul- tural animals as it is for laboratory an- imals. Because agricultural animals are involved extensively in trade, a lead nation can bring considerable pressure to bear on its trading part- ners to impose appropriate national standards on their transgenic agricul- tural animals. If transgenic animals are to be used for food or to provide eggs, cheese, hides, or milk, careful testing and evaluation should be routine before such products are ap- proved for human consumption or use. Regulations for Protecting Animals in the Wild Among the most refractory issues calling for development of enforcea- ble public policy is the broad set of issues known as "environmental." Vir- tually all members of the world com- munity agree that protection of ani- mals in their natural environment is a desirable goal. All agree that such protection usually requires action pnrior to the emergence of broad pub- lic consensus as to the proper or best course of action. To wait for a broad consensus to develop is to risk irre- versible deterioration of the environ- ment, making it unsuitable for ani- mals and other creatures. There is little agreement, however, even among persons who place a high value on environmental protec- tion, concerning what weight to give available data, when constraints on ac- tivities that affect animals in the wild should be imposed, and how policies and regulations should be enforced. As has been noted previously, ethical perspectives pertaining to animals and the environment are pluralistic and controversial. Thus the en- vironmental policymaker must seek common ground among persons or factions who not only interpret data in different ways, but who are not even guided by commonly held ethi- cal values. A case in point concerns the preservation of nonhuman pri- mates and illustrates the difficulty of developing sound policies and regu- lations concerning protecting ani- mals in the wild. Animal activists have, for many years, criticized the biomedical re- search community for causing the de- cline in nonhuman primate popula- tions. Activists have sought to limit or prohibit the export of primates from countries of origin (nearly all under- developed countries) to developed nations, particularly the United States, which supports (in the public sector) and regulates (in the private sector) the largest biomedical re- search effort in the world. The research community rejects activist charges by claiming that there are no data to support the contention that capture and exportation of pri- mates for research purposes has caused measurable decline in wild primate populations. Researchers argue, on the contrary, that the pri- mary cause of decline in primate populations is the clearing of the vir- gin forests which are the natural hab- itats for these animals. Secondary causes of primate decline include the hunting of primates for food, the kill- ing of primates as agricultural pests, poisoning of primates by pesticides used in farming, capture and sale of primates for use as pets or for exhibi- tion, and the commercial sale of pri- mate pelts. The International Com- mittee on Laboratory Animals, now known as the International Council for Laboratory Animal Science (ICLAS), was formed in 1972 and continues to negotiate policies for the preservation, capture, breeding, shipment, and management of ani- mals taken from the wild. The research community argues that relatively small numbers of pri- mates are wild-caught for transporta- tion to developed countries for re- search purposes. Developed nations have long recognized that reliance solely on imported animals places the research community in the position of relying on dwindling supplies of animals and on unstable political sit- uations. Consequently, breeding pro- grams have been established to meet, at least in part, the research demands for nonhuman primates. The lack of a knowledge base and broad genetic resources prevents the creation of more captive breeding colonies that would remove all necessity for impor- tation of nonhuman primates. Researchers further argue that the high economic value research at- taches to the purchase of relatively few animals serves as an incentive to the developing nations to protect habitats and to prohibit the use of pri- mates for food, pelts, or exhibition. Several countries (such as Peru and Indonesia) have initiated efforts towards establishing self-sustaining captive populations mainly sup- ported by funding derived from American scientists. American re- search dollars support training of local scientists and establishment of facilities to enable better manage- ment of captive populations as well as better management of habitat for wild animals.90 This case is typical of many en- vironmental situations. First, it illus- trates a controversy based on much rhetoric and relatively little informa- tion. Second, it can be managed only S27</page><page sequence="28">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 in part by domestic regulations. Third, there is an obvious difference between developed and developing nations concerning the value of non- human primates and the priority that should be given to their preservation. Fourth, to take no action is likely to cause the extinction of many species that are phenotypically and geneti- cally closely related to humans, valua- ble research models, aesthetically pleasing, and the best source of scien- tific clues to human origins and human societal characteristics. Failure to act will almost certainly cre- ate an irreversible situation in which no effort will be sufficient to salvage either the animals or the e nviron- ment needed to sustain them. How can this situation and others like it be regulated? If regulators are to make progress in dealing with complex cases such as the preservation of nonhuman pri- mates, then a number of steps must be taken. The first is to mandate a census of animals in breeding colo- nies. Figures obtained from the cen- sus ought to be compared with the estimated numbers of animals in the wild and with the estimated future demands for research animals. Ideally a census should be cospon- sored by all or many of the developed nations. Nations where these animals are indigenous must be involved and helped to understand that the ani- mals constitute a valuable resource for the entire world. Disagreement between animal ac- tivists and the research community can be diminished by the collection of better data. Based on improved data, government subsidy of research resources can then be extended to as- sure preservation of habitats of threatened nonhuman primates and, where possible, to establish breeding colonies for research animals. Har- mony between the research commu- nity and animal activists may be too much to expect, but regulators ought to be successful in getting support from both sides to collect data and to increase the population of en- dangered species. Support for such efforts should be elicited from the World Health Organization, the Pan American Health Organization, the United Nations, and other inter- national bodies. Responsibility of the Developed Nations A second illustrative case concerns the clearing of the rain forest in northwestern Belize.91 The region- including forest, swamp, and savanna-constitutes the most exten- sive rain forest in Central America. The rain forest is being cleared by bulldozing and burning to increase land for farming. No one knows how much of the rain forest can be de- stroyed before major changes in temperature and rainfall perma- nently alter the climate. If this habitat is destroyed, replacement of some species of animals, particularly birds and snakes, will be impossible since they can be found in no other en- vironment. The cleared land in Belize has only a thin layer of topsoil that requires heavy use of fertilizers to make it perennially suitable for productive farming. Insects, inimical to farming but important for the bird popula- tions, are controlled by pesticides. The principal farmers of the cleared land are peace-loving Men- nonites who migrated to Belize a generation ago seeking land they could cultivate. Mennonite doctrine and tradition closely relate humans with land. Land is deeply and sincerely revered by the members of the Mennonite community who can- not, by any stretch of the imagina- tion, be said to be unconcerned about the environment. Careful stewardship of the land is central to their religious convictions. (Oil com- panies know well that Mennonites delayed construction of the Alaskan pipeline for years because of their concern for the environment. They successfully brought suit to force the oil companies to redesign the Alaskan pipeline to allow for migra- tion of caribou and other animals.) Nevertheless, the Mennonites in Be- lize tenaciously defend a different set of values from those of the en- vironmentalists who oppose destruc- tion of the rain forest. Why are Mennonites involved in burning, bulldozing, and replacing the rain forest with farmland? Pri- marily because the population of Be- lize has grown dramatically in recent times. Domestic farms will allow the country to feed the fast-growing population, to improve the local economy, to prevent disease and im- prove human health. Wild animals are being replaced by domestic ani- mals that provide food, fiber, and in- dustry. The Mennonites believe that by clearing the forest they can simul- taneously continue the endangered traditional life-style of the Mennonite community and improve the quality of life of the indigenous human population. Managers of the Rio Bravo Conser- vation and Management Area are seeking money to buy as much of the rain forest as possible. Their first ob- jective is to preserve wildlife corridors by preventing the total separation of two huge blocks of forest. Preserva- tion of many animal species appears to depend on preservation of much of the remaining forest and perhaps even a reconstitution of the forest in cleared areas. The case of the rain forest in Belize offers further evidence that a sys- temic approach must be taken. It is regular practice between developed and developing nations to negotiate bilateral agreements concerning trade, education, military bases, emi- gration, shipping, fishing, landing rights, and a host of other matters. Environmental sensitivity suggests that bilateral agreements between developed and developing nations should also routinely include and stress the importance of preserving natural habitats and protecting wild animals. At the present time, such is- sues are seldom included in bilateral agreements. Only if a process of preservation of species is pursued, in concert with efforts to strengthen the health, edu- cation, and the economy of the developing nations, is there a good chance of environmental success. Pursuit of animal and environmental issues in isolation from other con- cerns stands little chance of bringing about compromise and change. A systemic approach can be costly not only in terms of dollars but also in terms of trade-offs. The developing nations are likely to demand that the United States and other developed nations assist them in crafting alter- native strategies to meet their domes- tic needs with food sources and in- S28</page><page sequence="29">SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT Hastings Center Report, January-February 1994 dustry to offset the economic costs of preserving habitats and not extend- ing farmlands. They are also likely to demand that the developed nations reduce the exploitation of fossil fuels and decrease pollution of air and water. Developed nations must recog- nize that preservation of the environ- ment is costly in money and in life- style; but failure to address envi- ronmental issues in cases like that of the Belize rain forest will ultimately be even more costly and will inevi- tably produce a situation that is irre- versible. A Small Piece of the Environmental Puzzle In the face of the enormous en- vironmental problems facing the world, the introduction of genetically altered animals into the environment must be considered as a relatively minor problem. The small size of the problem is due in part to the fact that the technology is new. Rather than wait until the problem becomes unmanageable, developed nations that possess the technology for developing transgenic animals for release into the environment need to act promptly, even though the evi- dence that such release is harmful to the environment is not supported by hard data. Clearly, whatever policies or regula- tions are developed to cover release of genetically altered animals must be international in scope. It is not too late for developed nations to ne- gotiate, bilaterally and through the United Nations, agreements to withhold such release until adequate controlled environmental impact studies have been conducted. Such procedures are already established for introduction of genetically al- tered plants into the environment. Such agreements should be ex- tended to animals. The protection of animals in the wild, including protection from the release of destructive transgenic or- ganisms, is a small but important piece of the environmental protec- tion puzzle. It is small in comparison with issues of water pollution, air pol- lution, waste disposal, and overpopu- lation. Controversial though it may be, it seems more amenable to reso- lution than many other aspects of environmental protection where data are harder to accumulate and correc- tive steps appear to be nearly hope- less. Animal issues provide a useful fulcrum for environmentalists to begin to develop constraints on ex- ploitation and abuse of the environ- ment. - Charles R McCarthy in collaboration with Gary B.
