<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS Obituaries With deep regret we record the deaths of these scholars in archae- ology and ancient studies, who were well known in their respective fields: Roger Hinks, distinguished art his- torian, among whose many fields of competence were Greek and Ro- man portrait sculpture and Roman mosaics, died June 10, 1963 at the age of 59; Alfred V. Kidder, dean of South- western archaeologists, long associ- ated with the Carnegie Institution of Washington, whose first explor- ations in Colorado and New Mex- ico, in 1907, were made for the Archaeological Institute of America, died June 11, 1963 at the age of 77; Father J. M. A. Janssen, noted Egyptologist, editor of the Annual Egyptological Bibliography, died August 29, 1963 at the age of 55; Winifred Lamb, outstanding Clas- sical archaeologist, author of Greek and Roman Bronzes, numerous ex- cavation reports and two fascicles of the Corpus Vas or um, died Sep- tember 17, 1963. Explorations at Cenchreae Investigations were conducted by the University of Chicago and In- diana University during July and August, 1963, at Cenchreae, the port of Corinth on the Saronic Gulf just south of Isthmia. The work was exploratory and definitive re- sults have not been achieved, but much significant information was acquired and the site holds con- siderable promise for further study. Among other points of signifi- cance, it was determined that the land now lies about six feet lower than in the time of Augustus. Hence the excavations, most of which were close to the shore line, struck water at Roman levels, and it was impossible to penetrate into Greek levels without special equip- ment. It is hoped to continue with Annual Meeting of the ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA The sixty-fifth General Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America will take place in con- junction with the Annual Meeting of the American Philological Asso- ciation at the Penn-Sheraton Hotel, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on De- cember 28, 29 and 30, 1963. The Council of the Institute will hold its annual meeting at 9:00 A.M., Sun- day, December 28. Sessions for the reading of papers will be Saturday afternoon, Sunday and Monday. Most members have probably al- ready made arrangements for at- tending, but a reminder at this time may not be amiss. Requests for room reservations should be sent directly to the hotel. such equipment in future cam- paigns. There is, however, reason to believe that Hellenic remains exist on high ground around the har- bor, and random discoveries of pot- tery of all periods back to Geo- metric were made in fill of Roman and post-Roman times. The remains of several expanses of pavement along the water front were revealed; of these the earliest may have been Hellenistic and the latest seems to have been exposed into the sixth century a.D. At one point this pavement extended some forty meters inland from the pres- ent shore line, suggesting an open square close to the water front, near the middle of the harbor. Behind this square lay a long narrow build- ing with two rows of rooms; else- where, closer to the harbor, were crowded ranks of solidly con- structed buildings containing six or eight rooms, situated between streets parallel to and at right angles to the harbor. What seem to be re- mains of the edge of the quays may be seen here and there in the water, close to the shore. Among the most important fea- tures examined were the piers and moles that enclosed the harbor at each end; on each of these appear the remains of ancient buildings, now under water. Those on the southwest pier were surveyed in some detail. They seem to repre- sent three blocks of buildings: one, facing the harbor, on the north side of the pier, consists of a series of structures, each containing four rows of rooms; another, on the south side, is an elaborate complex of rooms of various shapes, some apsidal; a third, at the end of the pier, could not be examined closely because of the depth of the water and the overlay of debris. The first, at least, would appear to have been a part of the harbor installation of warehouses or comparable build- ings. A major aim in a future cam- paign would be to study these with submarine equipment. At the northeast end of the har- bor, on the side toward the open sea, there once existed a large Ro- man building of which the greater part now lies in the sea. The por- tion which is on dry land was ex- plored by trenches which showed that the building was finely con- structed of brick, with good mosaic floors, of which extensive areas are preserved. It dates probably from the second or third century after Christ. Among the notable related discoveries was a length of lead pipe composed of several sections welded together. Around this build- ing were found remains of other structures; some were earlier, per- haps Hellenistic, and one may rep- resent a Roman temple, possibly the temple of Aphrodite mentioned by Pausanias. At the southwest end of the har- bor, above the landward end of the pier, was discovered a small but 286</page><page sequence="2">Left: View of the southwest end of the harbor at Cenchreae, showing the church and, beyond, buildings on the pier, now largely under water. Right: Narthex of the church, with mosaic pavement. complex church dating, according to present indications, from about the fourth century. It originally had a fine mosaic floor, and many well preserved remains of the mosaic and marble floors of the auxiliary rooms were uncovered. In one of these were found numerous fresco remains, including a well preserved section on a large ashlar block. This fragment shows clearly the head and outstretched arms of a man apparently falling or being held head downward; beside him are traces of the lower edge of a skirt-like garment and the legs of the man wearing it. The whole question of the relation of the church, the mosaics and the fresco to earlier structures on the site (in- cluding the warehouse and, pos- sibly, the sanctuary of Isis men- tioned by Pausanias as being at one end of the harbor) is at the mo- ment completely baffling, but it represents one of the important problems for future study. A noteworthy piece of informa- tion was the discovery that Cench- reae was inhabited - possibly flour- ishing - into the sixth century: an Avar buckle found in the church may hint at how that epoch ended. In some parts, at least, the city continued to flourish into the By- zantine period. The season was fruitful in the discovery of considerable amounts of glass, lamps, coins and Roman pottery. There were almost no in- scriptions or marble sculptures, and few figurines. An important find was made by members of the staff about half a mile north of the site, along the coast: an apparently well preserved foundation of a temple of perhaps the fourth century B.c., with large quantities of broken marble archi- tectural fragments of good quality in the fields around. This may well be the temple dedicated to Artemis which Pausanias locates on the road from Isthmia to Cenchreae. Robert Scranton University of Chicago Edwin S. Ramage Indiana University Search for Sybaris Since 1961 a team of American and Italian archaeologists has been searching for the site of the sixth century b.c. Greek city of Sybaris in Calabria, southern Italy. With the aid of new electronic instru- ments, especially the protonmag- netometer, which detects and re- cords the presence of buried walls and similar remains, two ancient cities have been found - each large enough and old enough to be Syb- aris, known as the wealthiest and most luxurious city of the ancient Greek world. The two sites are about eleven miles apart, one where the ancient shoreline is believed to have been, and the other on the top of a small plateau twelve and one-half miles inland. At the shore site, near the mouth of the Crati in northern Calabria, three levels of occupation have been found; they date to the Roman pe- riod of about the time of Christ, the fourth century b.c. and the sixth century b.c. Foundations of build- ings and a mile-long wall have been detected by the protonmag- netometer and by drilling. The plateau site, located at the summit of Torre Mardillo, was par- tially excavated after the proton- magnetometer disclosed the exist- ence of large structures at a depth of three feet. On the basis of ce- ramic remains found, the site is ten- tatively dated to the period 600- 300 B.c. Various suggestions have been made for the identification of the two cities. It is possible that the shore site was the harbor for the main city on the plateau. Or per- haps the inland site was a native Italian city, built under Greek in- fluence, which traded in Greek ob- jects. Another possibility is that one of the two sites may be ancient Thurii, which was founded by the Sybarites after the people of the neighboring city of Croton had de- stroyed their city in 510 b.c., and which after several hundred years evolved into the Roman town of Thurii-Copia. The expedition is sponsored by the University Museum of the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania, the Lerici Foundation of Rome and the Super - intendency of Antiquities for Cala- bria. Ometepe 1962-63 The following account of explo- ration in Nicaragua is owed to the kindness of Dr. Wolfgang Hab- erland, whose work is already known to readers of Archaeology: The field work of the 7 th Ar- chaeological Expedition from Ham- burg to Central America was con- ducted exclusively on Ometepe Is- 287</page><page sequence="3">Pictographs from Boulder 4, Corozal Viejo, Ometepe Island. The naturalistically drawn deer, four of which cover the surface, belong to a larger group of animals not uncommon on the southern part of Ometepe Island. land, in the Lake of Nicaragua (see Archaeology 14 [1961] 154- 160). Dr. Wolfgang Haberland and his assistant, Mr. Peter J. Schmidt, both of the Hamburg Museum of Ethnology and Prehistory, arrived on the island October 25, 1962. The first few days were spent exploring sites in the fertile lowlands around Moyogalpa, where headquarters were set up. At the first site, San Roque, al- ready explored in 1958, two test pits (2 X 3 m.) were dug. They re- vealed a deep layer of refuse, down to 3.10 m., consisting of Early Polychrome material only, with a slight mixture of Luna Polychrome (Late Polychrome period) in the uppermost layers. Besides exten- sive sherd material, enough bone material was recovered to give some clues to the dietary habits of the time. While land animals were obviously only sparingly used, tur- tles and fish played a major rôle in the diet. All indications, however, point to the fact that the main sub- sistence was derived from agricul- ture. Among the non-ceramic ma- terial the absence of stone arrow points was peculiar, in spite of the presence of a number of flint and obsidian chips, mostly of very small size, in all layers. Neither of these raw materials is indigenous to the island. Arrowheads could have been made out of bone. Some broken bone points were found, which may, however, be parts of netting-needles. The next two sites, Noche Buena and Los Hornos, yielded some se- quences of the Early and Middle Polychrome periods, but were gen- erally less satisfying. Their value will be mainly as controls for other excavations. The fourth site, La Paloma, contained a sequence from the Zoned Bichrome to at least the Middle Polychrome period. In one of the two test pits, the material did not seem much disturbed. December 13, 1962 saw the be- ginning of prolonged excavation at Los Angeles. The first two pits be- gan with some polychrome ceram- ics, most probably of the first phase of the Middle Polychrome period and continuing through Early Poly- chrome into Zoned Bichrome. Un- derlying Avilés-like material, the earliest phase of Zoned Bichrome found by Albert H. Norweb on the Isthmus of Rivas (Nicaragua), was a layer of grooved and incised sherds, lacking the typical ceramic varieties of Avilés, like Rosales Zoned Engraved, Schattel Incised and Popoyuapa Ridged. This prob- able pre-Avilés and pre-Zoned Bi- chrome (i.e., Formative) phase was tentatively called Angeles phase. Beneath the sandy soil containing Angeles phase material followed 50-60 cm. of sterile soil, consisting of layers of brownish sand, black volcanic sand or ash, and a lam- inated consolidated gray sand, which capped a brown humus layer, again containing sherds. This layer measured 30-40 cm. Sherds here seem to be more primitive than those of the Angeles phase. Groov- ing was absent, painting used only for the rims, and the only mechani- cal decoration was the so-called drag-and-jab. All these facts seem to indicate that this Dinarte phase pottery could be of considerable age, but here again more study is necessary. Since the material of both An- geles and Dinarte phases was not plentiful, further test pits were dug. Unfortunately, these struck an old graveyard, which had destroyed all stratigraphy. Therefore, this area was useless for establishing a valid sequence on Ometepe Island. On the other hand, the first graves encoun- tered showed inhumation burials and it was important to investigate them, since with a few exceptions all burials known on Ometepe Is- land have been secondary urn buri- als. Because only a few graves con- tained any pottery at all, and most of that recovered could not be fixed into the sequence, a large area had to be excavated, finally comprising about 70 sq. m. and containing fifty-four burials, most of them with extended skeletons buried face down. Two of the skeletons were flexed and a few, mostly of small children, were lying extended on their backs. The pottery vessels re- covered from the graves, now in the Museo Nacional of Managua, Nicaragua, indicate that the grave- yard was used during the beginning of the Middle Polychrome phase, but it may contain some late Early Polychrome burials as well. I hope to report on this cemetery more ex- tensively in Archaeology at a later time. Because this excavation, which took seven weeks, did not yield the information sought, especially on the pre-Avilés material, four more test pits were sunk in Los Angeles. While one ran into the outskirts of the very extensive graveyard (thus bringing the total of burials up to 59), two others fortunately pro- duced certainly pre-Avilés ceramics. By this time it was the middle of February, 1963, and there was still a large group of sites to be ex- plored. Therefore Mr. Schmidt and I separated in order to cover a larger area during the remaining 288</page><page sequence="4">Small anthropomorphic vessel from pottery pile beside Burial 14, Los Angeles, Ometepe Island. This so far unique piece belongs stylistically in the first phase of Middle Polychrome. time. The writer excavated three test pits at Tierra Blanca, producing a sequence of different Middle Polychrome phases and going into the last phase of the Early Poly- chrome period. Of the three test pits at San Antonio del Norte, two gave a sequence from Late Poly- chrome to the last phase of Middle Polychrome, while one pit ran into a number of secondary urn burials, belonging in the last phase of the Late Polychrome period. The final three test pits, excavated at San Lázaro, revealed a one-phase site, the last phase of Middle Poly- chrome. On the basis of the exten- sive sherd material from this site, it is questionable whether it could be called El Rosario, as on the Isthmus of Rivas, since certain dif- ferences seem to be present. Fishing with nets obviously played a major role, as shown by numerous net sinkers made from sherds and rims of broken pottery vessels. The bur- ial custom at this time was already a secondary burial. Again stone ar- row points were lacking, as at most other sites, but maños and metates were present, as well as various broken bone implements. Mr. Schmidt, in the meanwhile, excavated two test pits at Chilaite, where a stone statue - the head missing - and some urn burials of the last phase of Late Polychrome were found. The ceramic material from this site covered only the Late Polychrome period. This excavation could not be finished owing to dif- ferences with the landowners, and Mr. Schmidt continued his work with two test pits at Providencia. The sequence here began with Late Polychrome and showed Early Poly- chrome in the lower layers. Whether Middle Polychrome material is pres- ent is still doubtful but possible. Mr. Schmidt's final two test pits were sunk in the vast site of La Paloma to get additional material from this stratified site. Our excavation on Ometepe Is- land came to an end on April 1st. During the following weeks a site survey was conducted on horseback. One week was spent on the south- ern half of the island, around the extinct volcano Maderas. While set- tlement here was obviously not as dense as in the fertile lowlands of the Moyogalpa plain, a number of sites were found and surface sam- ples, supplemented by finds from small test pits, collected. An inter- esting and important feature in this part of Ometepe is the presence of numerous petroglyphs, missing in the other half. Among them are the most beautiful pictographs the writer has ever seen in Central America. After investigating the area around Alta Gracia, the site count for Ometepe now stands at fifty-two sites visited personally and sampled. About a dozen more sites are known but have not been visited for various reasons. This in- cludes the Cruz site, tested previ- ously by Albert H. Norweb. The material recovered from the various sites will permit the estab- lishment of a stratigraphie sequence for this part of Nicaragua, which will run unbroken from the An- geles phase to the time of the Con- quest. There are enough overlaps and cross checks in the various se- quences encountered to base this quite firmly. Whether the Dinarte phase immediately precedes Angeles phase is doubtful. The sherd ma- terial has to be examined more thoroughly, since all the facts men- tioned above are based on field ob- servations only. The final reports, we hope, will be published in due time, but they are more likely to pose new questions than solve old ones.

Craw- ford, of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The British School of Archae- ology in Iraq completed its thir- teenth season at Nimrud, a campaign which began in mid- February and ended in late May of 1963. The excavations were under the direction of Mr. Jeffery Or- chard. The season had two main objectives: first, to complete the excavation of the rooms so far dis- covered in Fort Shalmaneser which contained carved ivories; second, to explore the ruins buried under some hills or mounds called Tulul al- Azar, which stand at the junction of the west wall of Fort Shalman- eser with the outer wall of the city of Nimrud. (Fort Shalmaneser, located at the southeast corner of the greater Nimrud enclosure, was a place where Assyrian armies were mustered and sent out.) Since the latter part of the 1957 season Fort Shalmaneser has been the focal point of the Nimrud excavations. Not only has the plan of the fort now been largely recovered but also a number of fine artifacts in stone and a multitude of carved ivories belonging principally to the ninth and eighth centuries B.c. More than 150 pieces have been registered in the catalogue. Thousands of frag- ments of ivories from this and other seasons remain to be cleaned, re- paired and joined, wherever pos- sible, by skilled restorers of the School in the Iraq Museum. As for the second objective, the Tulul al- Azar yielded a very fine doorway on the south side, at street level. An inscription carved on either side of the door just above the pavement attributes the con- struction to Esarhaddon (680-669 B.c.), who made extensive repairs to Fort Shalmaneser. The doorway, which is more than a meter wide, gives access to a small room which has a second stone doorway open- ing into a larger room. At the right of this room, a ramp ascends for about thirty meters through a series of long narrow rooms joined at in- tervals by archways made of sun- dried bricks. Then the passage turns to the left and continues for another thirty meters to the rooms at the top of the mound. The whole outer face of the structure, the walls and floor of the first room, and the wall of the second room which contains the second door are made of dressed and fitted stone blocks. The two doors were originally sur- mounted by pointed arches which have been robbed of their upper- most stones. The other walls of the second room as well as the walls of the rooms along the ramp were made of unburned bricks covered by mud plaster and then white- washed. The left wall of the upper section of the ramp (the right wall was destroyed by a wad'i) was dec- orated with paintings the scenes of which can no longer be recognized. Mr. Orchard will give a full re- port in a forthcoming issue of Iraq, The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, with the as- sistance of members of the Bagh- dad School of the American Schools of Oriental Research, conducted a sounding of seven weeks' duration at Tell Abu Salabikh, about twelve miles northwest of Nippur. The work was under the direction of Dr. Donald P. Hansen. Tell Abu Salabikh is situated on both banks of an ancient course of the Euphra- tes; the mound is approximately 1500 meters long but of less width. Stratification pits dug on each side revealed six meters of occupational deposit and a meter of clean soil before the present water table was reached. The remains on the west side are predominantly of the Uruk period and those on the east side Early Dynastic. On the Early Dy- nastic side the ruins of a burned palace or temple dependency were partially excavated. A fine building plan and about 100 pieces of Early Dynastic cuneiform tablets of the Fara "school tablet" type were re- covered. In addition to the building remains there were found four Early Dynastic II burials, all made at the same time, containing vessels both in terracotta and stone, one large copper mirror and other ob- jects. The last occupation at the site was about 2500 B.c. or perhaps even earlier. The Iraq Department of Antiqui- ties is now happily occupying a part of its superb new group of buildings in Baghdad. Set in spa- cious, landscaped grounds on the west side of the Tigris, not far from the airport and railway station, the new buildings comprise most im- pressive facilities for the adminis- trative offices of the Department and for the new Iraq Museum. There are separate buildings for offices, exhibition space, library, cafeteria, storage and garage. Most of these buildings are air-condi- tioned, both for the preservation of the antiquities and for the comfort of visitors and staff. While the of- fices and library have already been occupied, it will be some time be- fore all the antiquities are trans- ferred from the old museum. Cur- rently only the great winged beasts from Khorsabad (which used to stand in the reconstructed Assyrian gate on the present grounds) and a series of Khorsabad reliefs have been put in place in one of the large halls. Both the size of the hall and the over-life size of the sculp- tures give the impression of Assyr- ian might and power which Sargon must have intended at Khorsabad itself. At the far end of the same hall, the magnificent Shalmaneser throne base found at Nimrud dur- ing the 1962 season has been in- stalled. The Iraq Government and the Department of Antiquities are to be congratulated most heartily for providing such excellent facil- ities for the administration and for the exhibition of antiquities and the study of Iraq's illustrious past. At Guran Tepe, south of Ker- manshah in Luristan, Iran, a Dan- ish expedition led by Dr. Jorgen Meldegaard has undertaken the ex- cavation of a small Neolithic mound which has eight meters of deposit. In a trench cut into the side of the mound, a series of floors of crushed limestone set in a kind of cement - a type of floor which was used both for rooms and for ovens - wa s the most interesting feature. The pottery types occurred in the following order: burnished red ware near the top, painted Sarab ware, Jarmo ware, painted Guran ware (chevrons in reserve and crude daubs of paint at its earliest) and finally a dark gray ware before the aceramic cultural phase is reached. Most of the pot- tery has an estimated date between 7000 and 6000 B.c. It is interesting to note that some intrusive Luristan graves were found in parts of the mound. While no fine or unusual bronzes were recovered from this 290</page><page sequence="6">The newly reinstalled Cubiculum from Boscoreale as it now appears.

However, a series of tombs containing fine Lur- istan bronzes has been recovered by the expedition at another nearby site. We have, therefore, what may be the first Luristan tombs exca- vated by an accredited expedition. We look forward to Dr. Melde- gaard's report. The British Institute of Persian Studies directed by Mr. David Stronach will continue its excava- tions at Pasargadae in the autumn of 1963. As the name of the Insti- tute implies, however, its interest is far wider than that of archae- ology alone. It encourages studies in ancient and modern Persian lan- guage, history, religion and other related subjects. The Institute pub- lishes a new journal called Iran , which merits the attention of all who are interested in Persian studies. Boscoreale Frescoes Reinstalled at Metropolitan Museum In November 1963 The Metropol- itan Museum of Art in New York opened its new installation of the Cubiculum from Boscoreale, whose wall frescoes (acquired by the Mu- seum in 1903) rank among the masterpieces of ancient art. The Cubiculum, or bedroom, is the only room to have survived intact from a villa of the late Republican pe- riod, 40-30 B.c., which was exca- vated in 1900 on the slopes of Ve- suvius near Boscoreale, about a mile from Pompeii. Excellently pre- served, its wall frescoes are of in- estimable value in any study of the history of ancient painting. The new site for the Cubiculum is on the main floor of the Museum, adjacent to the first Roman Gallery, where other frescoes from Bosco- reale are displayed. Improved light- ing and a recessed railing permit better viewing of the paintings. The installation incorporates a number of changes which help re- store the room as closely as pos- sible to its ancient scheme. A barrel vault now covers only the alcove; over the rest of the Cubiculum the ceiling remains flat. New molding against the rear wall of the barrel vault reproduces the ancient stucco molding that is visible in old photo- graphs showing the frescoes still in situ. The modern baseboard and wooden boards that covered the joints between adjacent sections of the wall have been removed. The joints have been plastered and painted in, following the ancient design of a smooth, unbroken wall surface. An ancient mosaic floor has been installed; it is not from Boscoreale but was found in the Via Flaminia near Prima Porta. 291</page></plain_text>
