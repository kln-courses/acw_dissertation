<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Selby Whittingham: Marjorie Munsterberg insists that the Clore Gallery's Turner display fulfills the terms of Turner's will "to keep and preserve my Pic- tures as a collection of my works" (AJ, Summer 1991, p. 96). But that is just not so. What the opera- tive codicil said is that the fin- ished pictures were given to the National Gallery "provided that a Room or Rooms are added to the present National Gallery to be when erected called 'Turner's Gallery' in which such Pictures are to be constantly kept deposited and preserved" [my italics]. In- stead of this the National Gallery has disposed of the pictures which it does not want, mainly to the Tate Gallery, and has kept part of the cream (worth at least $50-100 million) for itself and excluded from the supposed "Turner's Gallery." Dinah Birch has recently summed this up: "England could freely possess his works, if En- gland would undertake to exhibit them as a single entity. The na- tion's long betrayal of respon- sibility to this bargain would have been to Turner, as it was to Ruskin, deeply symptomatic of its failure of vision" (Ruskin on Turner, 1990, p. 15). To pretend that there is no such betrayal still continuing is disreputable, but that is what many Turner scholars are doing. This raises the question not merely of fidelity to donors' wishes or how Turner's bequest should be seen, but also of scholarly integ- rity among art historians, which is why I chose to raise the matter in your columns. In view of the misleading pro- paganda put out in 1987 and since, it is understandable if Ms. Munsterberg is like many others confused about the facts. Less ex- cusable has been the behavior of others, including Michael Kitson, who first raised the question of scholarly integrity. Of A. J. Fin- berg (to whose account Munster- berg refers) Kitson said that he "did not scruple to falsify the evi- dence of the Will" (Turner Society News, February 1987, 12), wrongly adding that that is what I too claimed. In fact Finberg, even if he muddled things up, quoted accu- rately the relevant clause of the operative codicil on an earlier page (422), hardly the action of a deliberate falsifier. Whereas Kit- son and many of his fellow Turner scholars have misstated the terms of the will, and then refused to publish any answer in the jour- nals they control, Turner Society News and Turner Studies, hardly the mark of those confident of their case or interested above all else in the truth. They have gone on to suppress the Turner Society's own The Case for a Turner Gallery (1979), which publishes the will, and is cer- tainly no more imperfect than their own accounts. They have also failed even to mention the publication by us nearly three years ago of An Historical Account of the Will ofJ.M.W. Turner, R A., which for the first time publishes all the relevant documents of the last century and allows the reader to come to an informed opinion of his or her own. -The writer is co- editor of the journal J.M.W. Turner, R.A. From Michael Rabe: South Asianists owe a profound debt of appreciation to Susan L. Huntington whose reinterpreta- tion of the supposed aniconic character of early Buddhist art provides wonderful grist for class- room debate (AJ, Winter 1990, pp. 401-8). At dispute is the question of whether non-anthropomorphic symbols were ever substituted for the Buddha's human appearance in the narrative reliefs on stupa gateways and revetment panels, most notably at Bharhut, Sanchi, and Amaravati. Huntington seeks to overturn the conventional wis- dom with respect to such motifs (including trees with altars or meditation seats beneath them, royal parasols, and carved foot- prints) by reinterpreting the nar- rative panels in which they occur as portrayals, not of events in the Buddha's life, but of subsequent scenes of veneration at places made sacred by his former presence. In certain cases her reading may be valid, yet it begs the ques- tion of aniconism, it seems to me, for what are early pilgrims being shown as doing, if not venerating non-anthropomorphic objects? In numerous other scenes, moreover, aniconic references to events in the Buddha's life are irrefutable. In the single example that Hunt- ington published both in her arti- cle (p. 404, fig. 6) and in her book The Art of Ancient India (p. 73), they consist of a pair of footprints, split between the top and bottom rungs of the Sankasya ladder. Together they constitute a purely pictorial device employed by the Bharhut sculptor to signify the Buddha's descent from heaven. Even if one were to con- cede the almost absurd alterna- tive, namely that single footprints were later carved or painted on such widely separated rungs, the fact remains that together they would have served, like the more common pairs conjoined (e.g., p. 402, fig. 3), as aniconic pre- cursors of the figural image that [Continued on p. 127] ART JOURNAL 125</page><page sequence="2">pi/47 FIG. 1 The Buddha's Descent at Sankasya, from the north gateway at Sanchi, ca. 50 B.c. [Continued from p. 125] Xuangzang reported seeing on the ladder in the 7th century. Even more pronounced is the aniconic character of the same episode as depicted at Sanchi (fig. 1), where two sacred trees appear to hover, one in midair above the ladder, the other at its base. Together in continuous nar- ration, they can only be construed as denoting the Buddha himself in sequential stages, descending amid adoring gods to the diminu- tive human worshipers below. With the benefit of hindsight it is possible to recognize the Bud- dha's invisible presence in the earlier Bharhut panel as well, where worshipers on the left half of the composition are more accu- rately described as gathered around him (as if seated upon the flower-strewn altar beneath the tree and garlanded parasol), rather than circumambulating an actual tree beside the ladder, as Huntington would have it. Whatever one thinks about the more perplexing question of why the Buddha's human appearance was sometimes displaced by an- iconic symbols, the art-historical fact that it often was remains as unassailable today as when it first drew scholarly comment in the early 20th century. Huntington is to be credited for challenging us to examine early Buddhist reliefs more closely, but not yet for changing our fundamental under- standing of them. -The writer is associate professor of art history at Saint Xavier College, Chicago. Susan L. Huntington replies: Michael Rabe agrees with me, but doesn't know it. He writes: "In certain cases her reading may be valid, yet it begs the question of aniconism ... for what are early pilgrims being shown as doing, if not venerating non-anthropo- morphic objects?" Indeed, this is precisely my point-the pilgrims are venerating objects such as trees, stupas, thrones, and wheels. Where I differ from Rabe and all previous scholars is that I do not believe that these objects are substitutes for anthro- pomorphic depictions of a Bud- dha, but that they were important emblems in their own right. Fur- ther, as suggested in my article, I strongly object to the use of terms like "aniconic" and "non-anthro- pomorphic" when referring to these sacred objects. Such termi- nology reflects a binary system of thinking in which a category is identified and everything not be- longing to that category is defined as "other" or "non." Does the hu- man race consist of only men and non-men? (How, then, do we un- derstand women?) Should hu- mans be grouped as Caucasians and non-Caucasians? (How, then, can we understand the vast major- ity of peoples that comprise hu- manity?) I encourage Rabe and other scholars concerned with early Buddhist art to look at the sculptures for what they depict- not for what they do not depict- and to dispense with terminology that undermines our ability to un- derstand these "others" in their own right rather than according to what they are not. To disprove my ideas, Rabe publishes a relief from Sanchi that he believes does not fit my interpretation. This "exception to the rule" genre of argumentation reflects the most common type of criticism my theories elicit. In most cases, scholars perceive these exceptions because they are still thinking within the aniconic theoretical framework. Rabe, for example, insists that the two trees in the Sanchi composition can have no function other than that of "denoting the Buddha himself." I urge him and others who are ex- amining my ideas to abandon the former framework, or at least hold it in abeyance. When looking at such a relief, let these individuals ask: "What if the trees were not intended as substitutes for the Buddha's person? How then can we understand the composition?" I hope that in my final published work on this topic, my explana- tion of many of the reliefs that have been suggested to be excep- tions to my theories will satisfy readers. Let me also remind Dr. Rabe that I have never claimed that there are no exceptions-- indeed there may be some. But the existence of even a few excep- tions does not alter the evidence that the vast majority of the carv- ings do not show Buddha life events and that my analysis de- mands a restructuring of the way in which we view the early Bud- dhist art of India. While I welcome constructive criticism of my work, I hope that Rabe and other scholars will await the publication of my full, book- length study on early Buddhist art before dismissing my work. -The writer is University Pro- fessor at Ohio State University, Columbus.
