<plain_text><page sequence="1">RESCUE EXCAVATIONS AT SERVIA 1971-1973: A PRELIMINARY REPORT PLATES 26-8 UNTIL 1974, the site known to archaeologists as Servia, and discovered by A. J. B. Wace in 1go9, about 6 km. north of the town of the same name, was to be found on the right bank of the Haliakmon, immediately downstream from the bridge carrying the main road from Larissa to Kozani (PLATE 26a).' The bridge shown in the frontispiece to 'Prehistoric Macedonia' was blown up by the retreating British Army in the last war; the Bailey bridge which replaced it and the site itself now lie over 30 m. below the surface of a great artificial lake, Limni Polyphytou, which fills the valley of the Middle Haliakmon, PLATE 26b. The new bridge is the largest in Greece, and its impressive length emphasizes the importance of the crossing. Over it passes the highway, once the only practicable route connecting Thessaly, and ultimately central Greece, with Macedonia, while the bridges, past and present, marked the only convenient fording-place. The site itself, unlike the typical Thessalian magoula and many Macedonian toumbas,2 was a low spreading mound on a river terrace about 17 m. above the Haliakmon River. Its key position and favourable surroundings account for its early settlement but also, perhaps, for its repeated abandonment. Later occupation, transitory or permanent, by Romans, Byzantine Greeks and the armies, native and foreign, of two major wars, have left their traces, and by all of these intruders it was, to some extent, disturbed. Between the wars it was first excavated by W. A. Heurtley, then Assistant Director of the British School at Athens, in 1931 during his campaign of research into Macedonian prehistory. He dug there for only one season, a short time for tackling such a difficult site, particularly with the meagre resources at his disposal and his small, though distinguished, band of helpers. The excavation brought to light not only the earliest Neolithic but indeed the only stratified Neolithic site known in Macedonia for many years to come until the excavation of Nea Nikome- deia in 1966.3 Servia thus produced results of great importance and remained a type site for forty years. Precisely because of this importance it had long been clear that it called for further investi- gation, particularly in the light of the new discoveries from Thessaly made by the late Demetrios Theokharis and the late Vladimir Milojaid, to whom students of the prehistory of Northern Greece owe so much. When it was heard that the site was immediately threatened by flooding for hydro-electric works and irrigation the matter became urgent. The responsibility for the rescue excavation was assumed jointly by the Greek Archaeological Service, and by the British School at Athens.* Miss Katerina Rhomiopoulou, then Curator of Antiquities for Western I Reported by A.

A. WARDLE Macedonia, who had taken an interest in the project from the start, joined the team as co- Director. THE EXCAVATION In the first season of excavation (1971),5 after a short time spent on trials, our main complex of four trenches, each of 4 x 4 m., divided by I m. baulks, was laid out about 15 m. south of the supposed position of Heurtley's main trench F, in the hope of relating the stratigraphy of the two excavations. By the end of the season the removal of baulks united the original trenches, including as well a later extension to the north-west (trenches A and B, FIG. 6). These, covering an area of 90 m.2, were excavated to a depth of between 2 m. and 2-5 m. Despite our precautions, the middle of this area proved to contain no less than seven large Byzantine pits, as well as two E.B.A. ditches which were fully recognized only after the removal of the baulks at the end of the season. The north-west and south-east areas were fortunately free from disturbance and gave us encouragement to continue. The positive results were E.B.A. floors, a burned L.N. building, and a well marked M.N. destruction level, unmistakable even in the mutilated centre, also found by Heurtley. We had also learned, at considerable expense, that one property of the local soil, a concretion horizon, made it impossible to distinguish dug or disturbed earth in the top 0-75 m. In the second season (1972),6 work was continued in the main trenches A and B. B was extended to the south, and the natural surface was reached in the western trench (A) and in the north part of the eastern trench B. The natural silt was tested to a depth of over I m. and found sterile. A superficial area to the east was excavated to explore the E.B.A. floors and yard areas, and, further east, a large trench (C) was mechanically stripped to expose the earlier M.N. levels, since these had been so mutilated in trenches A and B by later intrusions. In the third season (1973),7 excavation of the main trench B was completed to natural and a large area to the south was mechanically excavated to the L.N. levels to examine these in greater detail (E). A small trial trench to the west of the main area (D) fell upon a rich M.N. destruction level and in the last days of this final season this trial was hastily extended and dug to a depth of 2 m. so that half of a large burned basement room could be more thoroughly investigated. Simultaneously, the E.N. levels at the Servia V site, about 500 m. downstream, which were discovered and tested the previous year, were thoroughly excavated and, although no structures were found, a large quantity of pottery and other finds was recovered. The chief aims of the excavation were not hard to define, although the circumstances inherent in a rescue dig, above all the impossibility of obtaining any notion of the time at our disposal, made the effective planning and carrying out of any programme very difficult. Heurtley had recovered an adequate sample of E.B.A. material, but from poor contexts, since he had failed to distinguish the corresponding levels which were largely destroyed. It was clearly desirable to find E.B.A. levels and features if these survived. An attempt should be made to establish whether the chronological periods M.N., L.M. and E.B.A. were linked by transitional phases or divided by gaps in occupation. Finally, how early did this occupation begin? It was important to reach virgin soil over an area large enough to give a reasonable chance of any earlier remains coming to light. These are, fundamentally, stratigraphic problems, to be attacked by the appropriate methods. But by the use of techniques now at the disposal of archaeologists new light could be thrown on the economic life of a prehistoric community, its resources and natural surroundings. We collected samples for 14 C and other physical methods of dating and analysis and water-sieved 5 Athens Annals of Archaeology (hereafter AAA) v (1972) 27. 6 AAA vi (1973) 419. 7 AAA vii (1974) 351.</page><page sequence="5">RESCUE EXCAVATIONS AT SERVIA 1971-1973 189 a sample column from surface to virgin soil, as well as any individual deposit likely to prove rewarding, for the recovery of seeds, bones, and other small or fragile remains. The results, as of comparable programmes at Sitagroi-Photolivos and Nea Nikomedeia, have proved as fruitful as the traditional earth shifting on the site itself.8 STRATIGRAPHY FIG. 2 Apart from the Early Neolithic site, Servia V, on the one hand, and later Byzantine activity on the other, we identified ten stratigraphic divisions of the various levels and building horizons In this and future accounts these divisions will be described as Servia phases i-io and then related to the appropriate stage of the Neolithic or Bronze Age. Naturally, many more building levels were distinguished. But these ten phases correspond to major groups of levels and relate to recognizable stages of pottery development. Early Neolithic levels were discovered 500 m. downstream-Servia V-but only a few scattered E.N. sherds were found in the lower levels of the main site. Two phases (i and 2) of timber buildings, immediately above the natural silt, represent an early stage of Middle Neolithic. Above these are two building phases employing basement rooms (3 and 4) which can be assigned to the full M.N. stage. A later M.N. phase (5) was discovered above the major destruction level of phase 4. Both pottery and stratigraphy suggest a gradual transition to the Late Neolithic levels (6 and 7) with a continuing tradition of timber building. A series of deep cylindrical pits of the latter phase cut deeply into the earlier deposits. The site then ceased to be occupied for a long period until the arrival of Early Bronze Age settlers who cut deep ditches all over the site; but, unfortunately, no trace of their houses survives (phase 8). This activity was followed, perhaps after a brief interval, by further E.B.A. settlement, represented by the shallow pits of phase 9 and the house floors and yard levels of phase 10. The settlement was then deserted and although stray Late Bronze Age sherds (including Mycenaean), Hellenistic, and Roman pottery have been found, it remained unoccupied until the Byzantine period when, in the twelfth century, deep pits of unknown purpose were dug in many parts of the site; superficial walls and floors discovered in the first year's trials could be Roman or Byzantine, but cannot be dated with certainty on the available evidence. Except for twentieth-century military emplacements and shallow ploughing, the site then remained undisturbed until our excavation and the eventual inundation. THE EARLY NEOLITHIC: SERVIA V During the 1972 season Miss Rhomiopoulou noticed a patch of black soil and a dense scatter of sherds and other finds in a ploughed field about I km. downstream and to the east of the main site. When labour, including site supervisors, became available for short periods, we took the opportunity to dig three soundings, together amounting to an area of about 15 m.2. The deposits were shallow, consisting of 20-30 cm. of ploughed soil (the field had been deep- ploughed, for the first time, by a tractor) below which appeared either the sterile soil, a yellow silt much like that found upstream, but harder, and often marked by distinct grooves cut by the plough shares, or a very dark but mixed archaeological layer, which rested on the silt. At one point, which we took to be a pit, the deposit reached a depth of I m. There were no traces 8 See Appendices with preliminary account of specialist studies. Sitagroi: A. C.

The finds, consisting of animal bones, stone tools, figurines, and quantities of sherds, were unquestionably Early Neolithic, and were comparable to material from Nea Nikomedeia, as well as from several sites in Thessaly. In 1973, excavation on a larger scale was started at this site. Like the main site, it stands on the lowest river terrace, within a few hundred yards of a good spring, but here the Haliakmon was flowing close to its left bank, and the shingle banks and flats between the present river bed and the steep right bank were cultivated as vegetable gardens. Besides a northern and a southern slit trench running E-W, the area we planned to excavate was laid out as a chess-board of 2 X 2 m. squares, divided by metre baulks, and dug alternately. If the results warranted it, the quarters were united into a 5 x 5 m. trench which was dug as one unit. In all, some 190 m.2 were excavated to sterile, made up of five of the larger trenches and a number of the smaller soundings lying on the periphery. Other 2 x 2 m. trenches proved sterile. The deposits, with two exceptions, were like those found in I972, ranging in depth from 20 to 50 cm. Although the finds of all descriptions were abundant, the results were disappointing. No remains of buildings were found apart from a couple of post-holes on the extreme southern edge of the ploughed field, and it seems probable that the settlement lay in that direction. Unfortunately, the next field was under crops, and no extension of the excavation was possible. Most of the area exposed consisted of a cobbled yard, its earliest layer a pebble floor resting on the silt, and covered by two remakes. It sloped down on the west to a hollow with gently sloping sides, probably a fossil stream bed, and running north-south. The middle, where the deposits were deeper than elsewhere, had been partly dug in 1972, as the pit of Trial I. But although the sides had been artificially scarped in places, neither its size, nor its profile, really suggested a pit: it was too large, too vague in outline, and the contents seemed like material washed down rather than refuse thrown in. Two genuine pits, an earlier and a later, but both preceding the courtyard, were also found, but little obvious change in the pottery is noticeable. Except for the ploughsoil, in which some tiles and a few Late Neolithic sherds turned up, the levels were remarkably free from any intrusion. POTTERY AND FINDS (FIG. 3) The enormous amount of sherd material from this site, greater in proportion to the earth dug than that from any period at the main site, has yielded very few complete pots or profiles, and these from small or even miniature vases. The Servia V pottery is remarkable for its uniformity, not to say monotony, and this is exacerbated by the scrappy and weathered condi- tion of the sherds. We are indebted to Mies Wijnen of Leyden University for the following account9 of the E.N. pottery. Technique The clay body, which is always micaceous, contains a wide variety of inclusions: quartz and quartzite fragments, grits of all colours, limestone chips, etc. This suggests that natural inclusions were allowed to remain in the incompletely levigated clay, rather than special materials being added. This practice seems to have been habitual in the whole of E.N. Greece. 9 It must be emphasized that this is a preliminary report only. Mies Wijnen had time to study only a limited, though representative, sample of the pottery.</page><page sequence="8">192 CRESSIDA RIDLEY AND K. A. WARDLE 1 2 FIG 3 SER VIA V EARLY NEO L I THIC PU I ItH Y typologically E.N. from main site</page><page sequence="9">RESCUE EXCAVATIONS AT SERVIA 1971-1973 193 Manufacture The evidence indicates that at Servia V, as at Sesklo, pots were moulded from a lump of clay rather than coil built. Parts such as collars and bases would have been shaped separately, and added where necessary. Additional information about the manufacturing processes is provided by the mat impressions surviving on four flat bases. This may indicate that the base was shaped and dried while standing on a straw mat. The pottery in general is well-fired, dark cores being uncommon, and well made. All pots are well finished and smoothed, and some are of very high quality, including thin-walled vases. The weathering to which most of the pottery has been exposed has usually destroyed the surface, but the sherds on which it has survived are mostly well to highly burnished: this is especially true of the mottled ware. Much of the fine pottery is red slipped over a buff body. This slip is very prone to scale, and in many cases has vanished completely, but a few sherds, especially from the pit, show a very high burnish. Shapes The repertory consists of globular to hemispherical bowls, jars with low necks, and some open plate-like vessels. Apart from these plates, the same shapes are found in coarse ware. Rims are usually plain, with a few good examples of ledge rims, while plain blunt, slightly offset and rolled lips occur with almost equal frequency, with a slight advantage to the first type, especially in coarse ware. Bases show great variety: plain flat, thin ring bases and plain low ring-feet, conical or cylindrical as well as taller, more widely flaring examples, including a few trumpet bases or pedestal feet. In one or two cases oval ring bases were found 5. These are not known from Sesklo, so far as I am aware, but I have seen these bases at Nea Nikomedeia. Pierced lugs are rare; most of them are medium or large in size, and they seem almost always to belong to coarse pots. Decoration (PLATE 28a) Very few decorated sherds were found at Servia V. The painted sherds: red-on-red 2, red- on-buff, are typical of the early painted ware of Thessaly, with rectilinear patterns and solid triangles. One painted sherd from the ploughsoil gives a polychrome effect, with Indian red and dark brown on warm cream, produced by a variation in the thickness of the paint. The parallel it calls to mind is with material from Nemea. The paucity of the painted pottery suggests that it should be imported, but since with the possible exception of Nea Nikomedeia, E.N. painted pottery is everywhere very scarce, it may be local. Some applied decoration, mostly of oblong or rounded knobs or ribs I, is also found. There are a very few sherds bearing nail impressions, and these really may be imported. No cardial decoration is known from Servia. The mottled pottery, produced by firing variations, on the other hand, is quite common, and the effect surely seems deliberate. This ware has a good surface finish, is thin and highly burnished, and the only decorated ware that can be called common. It is in no way different from the Thessalian mottled or 'Buntpoliert'.Io Colour Reds, though present in variety, including crimson and pink, are rarer than at Sesklo, and buffs and browns are commoner. Generally, dark colours seem to prevail, although dark greys and blacks are few and white 'China' sherds are extremely rare. Io V.

WARDLE Conclusions: Dating The E.N. pottery sequence will be based on the finds and stratigraphy at Sesklo, where the period can be divided into three phases: E.N. I also known as Friihkeramikum E.N. II Early Painted Ware E.N. III full Proto-Sesklo E.N. I at Sesklo consists of monochrome vessels, usually globular and hemispherical bowls. Shallow bowls and the practice of burnishing make their appearance towards the end of the phase. E.N. II is marked by the first appearance of painted pottery, but always in very small quantities. Technically, this stage shows a great advance, with well-smoothed and burnished, thin-walled pots and the first use of slipping, usually red but sometimes whitish in the case of the painted pottery. The red slip is inclined to scale. Some fine white and black-burnished pottery is also present, although rarely. Shapes, although globular jars and hemispherical bowls still compose the major element, are more varied and developed ledge-rims, rolled rims, ring bases and open shallow bowls become more common. Patterns on the painted pottery, applied to the pot's surface or to a white slip are either linear, (zigzags and broad bands) or solid (usually triangles which may be pendent). The E.N. III phase at Sesklo sees the disappearance of painted pottery for the time being and the typical wares are the beautiful monochrome and two new varieties, the mottled or 'Buntpoliert', with contrasting patches, dark red or yellow-grey, produced by variations in oxidization during firing, and applied decoration. At other Thessalian sites, e.g. Achilleion, the painted ware never disappears, although accompanied by the new techniques. This phase shows an enormous increase in the amount of pottery recovered as well as continued technical improvement. A new shape is the low-necked jar, and open shapes, both bowls and plates, outweigh closed ones for the first time. Pierced lugs are not as common as before. The painted pottery which returns at the end of the phase differs chiefly from what went before in its improved quality. The phase called Pre-Sesklo or Vorsesklo at Otzaki, where impressed decoration replaces painted, is present neither at Sesklo and sites such as Haghia Anna (Elasson) in Thessaly, nor at Nea Nikomedeia and Servia in Macedonia, where any impressed sherds present are found in the same context as the painted pottery." All things considered it seems to me that the E.N. material at Servia compares with either a transitional E.N. II/III or with the early part of the E.N. III phase at Sesklo. On the one hand we have the presence of Early Painted material, present from the very lowest levels to the surface; on the other we have the repertory of shapes (necked jars, many offset and rolled rims), the applied decoration and the mottled ware, as well as the very highly burnished red monochrome. MIES WIJNEN Other finds include fifteen fragments, mostly legs, from polypod vases or bowls, none, un- fortunately, complete enough for restoration, and a sherd from a red-slipped anthropomorphic pot. Among the ground stone tools were found one light celt, three heavy celts, three pounders, and two stone bowls or mortars. The chipped stone is a typical quartz flake industry, but some chert was also used. A well made obsidian arrow head found on the surface is likely to be L.N. A few bone tools comprised awls, points, and a gouge, but no spatulae, although we found one x V. Miloj id, 'Hauptergebnisse der deutschen Ausgrabungen in Thessalien 1953-58', JRGZM vi (1959) io. G.

There were no loom-weights and only one bi-conical spindle whorl, but some if not all of the many sherd discs probably fulfilled the same function. A few such, with several holes, suggest spacer beads. Other ornaments included one bone as well as several terracotta beads. By far the commonest small finds, and also the most baffling, are so-called spools or bobbins made of unbaked clay, varying around 6 cm. in height, and 50 g. in weight when complete, which they rarely are. They are slightly waisted and the rather bulbous ends may have convex surfaces. It is most unlikely that thread was wound on these objects, since they are only moder- ately smooth and the waist is not sufficiently distinct. A few sites, from periods as far removed as the Late Bronze Age, and as remote as Euboia, produce them in quantities, usually though not always unfired, and no-one has yet been able to suggest a convincing use.'2 The most interesting finds are perhaps the figurines, although they were never of the highest quality. The half dozen examples, of which all but one are fragmentary, include an animal, two torsos, probably female, one of which has incised slashes on the front and back, and two pear-shaped figurines. The most accomplished is the obese torso (PLATE 26e). Parallels to all these figurines are found in Thessaly, particularly at Prodromos.'3 MIDDLE NEOLITHIC In the main trenches at least nine successive building levels were identified in the -50o m. deposit from the sterile silt to the widespread destruction level which was thought by Heurtley to terminate Middle Neolithic occupation on this site. The basic construction of these buildings is similar, although the arrangements, plans, and orientation are varied. The outer walls and partitions were formed of rows of closely set stakes or small posts placed in a narrow bedding trench, although this was not always identified. These stakes were presumably linked with horizontal branches or reeds and the whole frame then filled in and covered with a thick packing of clay mixed with straw and chaff. Dug from the underlying natural silt, this clay was probably laid in courses, though not as separate bricks, and left to dry before the next course was added. No doorways were found. The roof, and possibly an upper storey, was sup- ported by massive central posts placed in large post pits reaching well over a metre into the ground. These imply a pitched roof construction such as indeed is used today in this area. The presumed interiors were exceptionally clean and floors were difficult to distinguish unless defined by a thin spread of ash or other material. Traces of planks were found in the lowest level, and if this kind of floor is typical of the Middle Neolithic buildings, then the apparent absence of floors for any structure until the Late Neolithic can be better explained. Substantial hearths, or perhaps ovens, built of river pebbles set in clay, are characteristic of the Neolithic levels at Servia and seem to occur in yard areas. PHASE I The earliest house plan we were able to recover is shown in FIG. 4. An approximately square room was found in the north-west part of the main trenches. The area enclosed is around 30 m.2, and in the southern part of the room traces of a decayed floor of prepared planks were found. To the south, the line of the eastern wall is continued by a series of posts set in a narrow bedding trench. The western wall is continued by a line dividing different deposits. No post holes were recognized here at the time of excavation but later experience shows that they could easily have been overlooked. Post-pits and post sockets which probably indicate the 12 M. R.

Unfortunately, one Late Neolithic and three Byzantine pits penetrated to this level in addition to the large southern E.B.A. ditch destroying the crucial central area. It therefore remains uncertain whether the room in the north-west is part of a long-house which would have been over 17 m. long, or whether it is an isolated building in a row of similarly aligned structures. In any case it is of great interest that the same alignment is con- tinued over such a distance. A short length of bedding trench and a number of post-holes on the same alignment as the bedding trench indicate even earlier structures in the same area (marked b, b' in FIG. 4). In the south-eastern corner the main bedding trench was partly obliterated by a subsequent wall in almost the same position (marked c, c'). It seems likely that the row of large post-pits (d), in the centre of trench B are the central roof supports for this later building. The short lengths of wall and patches of floor in the north-east corner of the same trench must belong to one of these three phases but it is not possible to decide which. The same is true of the subsidiary features noted at this level, for example the remains of a typical circular pebble hearth in the north-east or the portion of a similar one running under the west section. The area of pebbles within the north-western room may represent a mend to the floor, or a feature built on it, although it does not appear to have been a hearth. There is only a thin deposit which can be connected with these structures. The ash line, which could be seen in the section, marked the floor level but was hardly noticeable during excavation. Above this is a band of rather clean yellow clay which presumably represents the levelling of the collapsed walls and roof before the later houses were built. The natural silt, and all deposits deriving from it, are relatively soft, and consequently the boundaries of the different deposits are easily blurred, whether in antiquity or during excavation. Compared with later building phases, these levels were poor in pottery or other finds. PHASE 2 In the following phase there was a slight shift in the positioning of the structures. Traces of walls were observed above those of the north-western room, and in the north-east. In the south- east, on the other hand, shallow pits were dug into sterile, perhaps to obtain clean building clay, and partly cut away the earlier buildings (e). Subsequently, a thick deposit of soft brown- black earth accumulated in the southern half of trench B. This was rich in charcoal, pottery and bone and seemed to be a typical 'yard' deposit. This distinction between exterior areas where refuse was allowed to accumulate rapidly, and interiors (or semi-interiors), which were kept scrupulously clean, was most marked in the Late Neolithic deposits where a much larger area was exposed, but seems to hold good for all periods on this site, and has, indeed, been noted elsewhere.'4 The yard level in question here is presumed to have accumulated during the occupation of the structures whose scanty remains were noted to the north-west. At the same level were discovered two collapsed unfired clay bins, and a partly destroyed pebble hearth. Evidence for the continuation of this phase is limited because later activity, (phase 3) cut away large areas leaving isolated islands, principally in the centre of trench A and towards the south of trench B. In the latter area the yard levels continued to accumulate while in the former two hearths were constructed in succession over the earlier one. These pebble hearths or ovens, a feature typical of the Neolithic levels, are the best preserved 14 J. D. Evans, 'Excavations in the Neolithic Settlement of Knossos, 1957-60. Part I', BSA lix (1964) 176.</page><page sequence="14">198 CRESSIDA RIDLEY AND K. A. WARDLE examples. A clay base was prepared with roughly circular or horse-shoe shaped walls: within this was laid a bed of graded river pebbles which were covered with a clay floor: the clay sides were raised slightly above this level leaving an entrance facing east. No higher structure was indicated by the remains found, except for a possible spit arrangement suggested by two or three post holes. Similar hearths were found both in obvious yard areas and in clean areas but there is no proof that hearths were placed inside any roofed building, though they may have been placed in sheltered spaces between buildings, which were kept swept and clean. These hearths were often repaired and are associated with several remakes of the surrounding floors. Apart from giving the structure of the hearth more permanence, the pebble bed will have served to retain heat. Cooking could have been effected by preheating the base with charcoal or wood, and then cooking on it after removing the embers. PHASE 3 An unexpected architectural feature was encountered in these levels: three of the rooms which can be seen in FIG. 5 were cut down by their builders to a depth of between 40 and 70 cm. into the earlier strata. Although none of these rooms lay completely within the excavated area, the nature of their remains and of the strata into which they are cut rules out the possibility of terracing to level pre-existing slopes. The strata at Servia are remarkably level at all periods, and there is certainly no indication of any slope in this area at this period. No obvious reason can be deduced for sinking the floor level of a room to this extent, although there is some evi- dence for two storeys in the Middle Neolithic destruction level, where this type of construction continued to be employed. In that case the lower room probably served as a storeroom. Part of one of these basements, as we shall call them, lay across the north end of trench A, and a pebble hearth was found to the south of this. The larger part of another semi-basement must have been situated in the southern end of this trench, as demonstrated by its south-east corner in the central part of trench B. However, the large southern ditch and no less than five Byzantine pits have mutilated the greater part of this area and the hypothetical limits of this room are reconstructed from indications in the relevant sections. Its dimensions were perhaps 6 m. X 6-5 m. The north-west corner of a similar room was found across the south end of trench B. The orientation of each of these rooms is different, and in the eastern trench contemporary walls were found to the east of these rooms, which must have risen above the ground surface then existing. The basement walls were constructed in more or less the same manner as the free-standing walls, and the features were seen in section but shown most clearly in the burnt basements of phase 4. At the foot of the cut in the ground was dug a narrow bedding trench and small posts or stakes, which continued above ground level, were set in this to revet the earth face. It is likely, though not demonstrated for every wall, that a second row of stakes was then placed some o-I5-20 m. back from the first row, on top of the cut. Clay was then rammed between and around these stakes to form a weatherproof wall. In the south wall of the central room small stones had been placed between the two rows of stakes, probably to secure a better footing for the wall. The free-standing walls vary slightly: the north-south wall linking the central and southern rooms appeared to have been rebuilt and in the later stage was probably constructed of a double row of stakes with clay in between. The wall running eastwards from the south-east corner of the central room had only a single row of stakes set in a bedding trench, and clay was presumably plastered round there. Two rows of stones in the northern part of trench B are probably contemporary: these had post-holes beneath them. (PLATE 27a.)

A. WARDLE of the clean yellow clay which filled them upon collapse of the walls, but apparently no laid floor existed. In the area of the central room a number of large post-pits, descending more than I"50 m., were dug from the floor level and must have held the main timber uprights supporting the roof or upper structure. Pebbles and stones had collected against the outer face of the east wall of the central room, and outside the southern wall of the northern room. A series of thin deposits and ash spreads with pebbles occurred in these areas suggesting that they fall into the category of open 'yard' areas. This would imply that the hearth discovered between the northern and central rooms was in the open air. It seems clear that the main buildings at this period were the basement rooms, or the upper storeys of these. They seem to have been built in a haphazard fashion: the spaces between them were divided and may have been roofed in part according to need. PHASE 4 Above this level the later intrusions have destroyed the deposits to such an extent that a coherent picture can only be obtained in the southern part of the eastern trench B, but the strata which survive in the remainder seem to be connected with buildings rather than with yard deposits. Almost immediately above the debris which filled the basement rooms was constructed a rectangular building, whose long walls were formed of a single row of posts, but whose end walls were represented by three rows of small posts. These probably indicate recon- struction rather than simultaneous use. The long axis was oriented north-south and the dimen- sions were approximately 3 m. X 7 m. Two transverse rows of posts near the southern end, suggested internal partitions but there was no indication of any main roof supports. No features could be connected with these walls and the picture is confused by post-holes discovered at the same level which might belong to earlier or later structures. No deposit can be connected with the use or collapse of this structure and the later buildings and floors are immediately over it. It is possible that a different technique was used for this building with a minimum of clay plastering the walls, but rather a more solid structure of timber and matting or wattling than previously. It is, of course, not certain whether this building served the same function as the earlier ones, or whether it was a storeroom rather than living quarters. In any case the architecture of the buildings which precede and which succeed this structure is the same. In the following phase basements were again constructed, but in this case were well preserved by the fierce conflagration which seems to have destroyed the whole settlement. This was identi- fied by Heurtley in the areas he excavated, and he found, as we did, some of his finest pottery in the destruction debris. We found traces of this catastrophe in every area where we excavated deep enough, and the destruction level could be seen clearly in the whole length of the section cut through the western part of the site by a new road. This level also provided some of the clearest evidence for construction methods, since the fire had baked large portions of the walls and floors before the timber framing burnt through and collapsed. Also preserved in the basement rooms under the 0o5 m. thick layer of rubble, were complete vessels, intact or shattered where they had fallen and a large number of small objects which are rarely recovered from Neolithic excavations. Approximately half of one of these rooms was cleared in the time avail- able to us and parts of three others were identified. The construction of these rooms was very similar to those found in the earlier M.N. levels but the positioning of the main supporting timbers was clearer. The length of one of these rooms is well over 7 m. while another is well over 5 m. long. Their width is not established: in the most completely excavated example a row of large posts was found 2 m. from the long</page><page sequence="17">RESCUE EXCAVATIONS AT SERVIA 1971-1973 201 0o FIG. 6 SERVIA 1971 - 73 Excavated areas and features of phases 4, 7 and 8 0 D E A 1128' '1111 1111111 1 XIl Not excavated below phase 8 1 B 799 280 50 0 C 11IIIIII 278 991 278 48 Middle Neolithic basement in destruction level, phase 4 Late Neolithic interior floors, Late Neolithic yard floors, phase 7 Early Bronze Age ditches, phase 8 Reconstruction 0 5 10 15 --i Metres</page><page sequence="18">202 CRESSIDA RIDLEY AND K. A. WARDLE wall (FIG. 6, Trench D, PLATE 27b). If, as was assumed at first, this is the central row, then a width of c. 4 m. must be assumed: on the other hand, in the earlier phase, it seems that one of these rooms was more or less square and therefore, this may be only one of two rows of posts giving a total width of about 6 m. Several storage jars and a number of pounders were found on the hard baked floor. Around these were heaps of einkorn, lentils, and Lathyrus sativus which had been carbonized by the fire.'s Above the floor in the debris were found a number of clay whorls, bracelets of stone and shell, pendants, and some fine vases (PLATE 26C). In one corner of the room was discovered a large slab of clay, fallen intact on to the floor, but the impressions of the timbers in this slab did not match those of the adjacent walls. Taken in conjunction with the finds in the debris and the size of the central posts it may be conjectured that this slab was a part of the upper floor which collapsed into the basement. The position of the post-holes in the floor suggested two partitions but there was no clay struc- ture to confirm these in the basement. They may well have represented the partitions in an upper storey, while the lower floor was left as a large, open storage area, perhaps with flimsy wooden partitions to separate different foodstuffs-whose remains seem too extensive to have been contained by the storage jars found. In the southern end of the main trench B where the corner of a similar room was found, the destruction fire had baked a large area of floor adjacent to it, but there was no indication of post-holes or any superstructure, although it seems likely that there was some wooden construc- tion here since the floor could not have been burnt in the open. Built on this floor was a pebble hearth of the usual kind clearly raised above the floor surface. Northwards, beyond the limits of the floor, could be seen the charcoal remains of small stakes or reeds set closely together, perhaps to form a pen for small animals. There were remarkable quantities of carbonized cereals and other foodstuffs in every area where this destruction level was encountered. PHASE 5 Although the fire which destroyed the phase 4 Middle Neolithic settlement at Servia is one of the clearest features'of the site, it is certain that it did not end occupation there as Heurtley assumed, an assumption which seemed to be confirmed by the first two seasons of excavation. Whether the cause was accidental or intentional, evidence from trench B showed that the settlement was in fact soon rebuilt, and the pottery from the houses immediately above the destruction level is hardly to be distinguished from that found in it. Some structural changes can, however, be seen. No basement rooms were found on this level, and, judging by the rapid super-imposition of successive structures and the absence of major uprights and of post-pits, the buildings may have been less durable. It is also possible that the plan of the settlement altered after the fire, and that the area of occupation decreased. In FIG. 7 (PLATES 27c and d) can be seen the complexity of the post-destruction level in the southern part of the east trench. Bedding trenches of three different buildings on different alignments cut into the destruction floor, in addition to the Late Neolithic bedding trench which was cut from a higher level. If the depth to which these trenches are cut is any guide, then the building whose complete plan can be seen is the earliest. It is about 7-5 m. long by 3'5 m. wide, with its long axis north-south. Two large post-pits were found near the presumed south-eastern corner, but we could not be sure that they belonged to this building. Of the other two buildings, one seems to have been situated towards the south-east with its north-west Is See Appendix 2.</page><page sequence="19">RESCUE EXCAVATIONS AT SERVIA 1971-1973 203 FIG. 7 SERVIA 1971 - 73 Phases 5 and 6 Middle and Late Neolithic A Middle Neolithic wall line Late Neolithic bedding trench Late Neolithic pits Early Bronze Age ditches Byzantine pits Post sockets B</page><page sequence="20">204 CRESSIDA RIDLEY AND K. A. WARDLE corner within the excavated area, while the other lies across the south-west part of the trench with its long axis north-west/south-east and seems to have an internal partition. No other features could be assigned to these buildings. The relationship of these M.N. structures to the L.N. structures which follow them strati- graphically, suggests a continuity of occupation. There is neither a stratigraphic break nor is there any change in the construction technique. Only a minute number of black-burnished sherds in the bedding trench of the first L.N. building shows that it is in fact L.N., while most of the sherds recovered are M.N. types. The evidence for the presence or absence of breaks in the stratigraphic sequence is notoriously unreliable, but it seems that the sequence of pottery at Servia does not correspond with that which has been suggested for Thessaly. There is no evidence for a break in occupation of several hundred years, which is implied by the Thessalian sequence at sites such as Otzaki.'6 POTTERY AND OTHER FINDS FROM MIDDLE NEOLITHIC LEVELS PHASES 1-5: FIGS. 8--I I, PLATE 28b-d So far as the pottery is concerned, the character of the Middle Neolithic period is even more markedly Thessalian than its predecessor, and Servia must be reckoned a northerly outlier of the long-lived and widespread Sesklo culture. The accepted chronology, based on the painted pottery (A3P in the Tsountas-Wace terminology),'7 defines an early stage characterized by solid designs carried out in red on a cream slip or light pot surface, followed by a middle phase of more diversified patterns, especially toothed and fringed zigzag bands. In the mature Sesklo style, the bordering triangles become elongated, spiky and asymmetrical, to culminate in shapes like flames or breaking waves. Final Sesklo brings an increase in monochrome pottery, and the clearly defined red-on-cream decoration tends to be replaced by a linear style (A3e) which avoids strong contrast by techniques described as blurring and wiping. It was always admitted that local differences existed and with this proviso the scheme still holds good to a limited extent. But it needs modification, since the results from Servia and other recent excava- tions (such as Argissa and Sesklo) indicate a more complicated state of affairs. A great variety of colours, styles, and techniques are found at Servia from the beginning, and many traits, including patterns, survive unchanged for a long time, while some developed features make an early appearance. The linear (A3E) style is present from first to last. The difference between one phase and the next is mainly a matter of proportions. Only a large pottery assemblage from a valid stratigraphic unit can be assigned with confidence to its place in the sequence. Clearly the sequence for Servia can be extended only with caution to contemporary sites elsewhere, although mutual pottery exchange within the Sesklo province is fortunately common, and should help to relate local pottery traditions. Some generalizations, however, are likely to prove widely applicable. Fine monochrome pottery is commonest in the early stage; painted pottery dominates the middle, and the late stage shows an increase, both in the quantity of plain pottery and in the size of the vessels, mostly storage jars, which comprise it. True coarse ware, by which is meant rough surfaced pottery, is rare throughout the Middle Neolithic, particularly in the early phase. There is a long-lived variety, decorated with furrows, usually horizontal, apparently made by dragging the fingers across the wet pot surface. The medium ware used for the large jars, usually necked or collared, has a well-smoothed surface inside and out, is not infrequently slipped, and occasionally lightly burnished.

This decoration, like the relief technique, is carefully carried out. Lastly, the incised and less common nail-impressed sherds fall into this category. They come from deep rounded bowls or necked jars of medium size. The surface, brown or buff as a rule, fairly smooth but very seldom burnished, is incised in several different ways, the commonest being a random scatter of fine, shallow dashes. This class is remarkably conservative, and continues to crop up, without any apparent change, in all but the latest M.N. levels. The fine monochrome pottery 39, 41, 42 has a wide range of colours, with various reds, in- cluding maroon, pink or crimson, predominant, but the true solid bright red of Thessaly (AI) is almost unknown, and except for the rare black and cream varieties, this class often gives a broken, almost marbled effect.</page><page sequence="24">208 CRESSIDA RIDLEY AND K.

The first and commoner by far is the Thessalian linear (A3a) style, described above. Wherever it originated, at Servia it is certainly locally produced and for the sake of clarity it will be referred to here as the Servia style. A wide variety of technical devices, of which wiping may have been the principal one, was employed to create the characteristic, free hand, blurred impression at times achieving what could be described as a moird effect, but the 'scraped' (A33) technique is not found at Servia. The simple designs, consisting of opposed groups of parallel or slightly diverging lines, cover the whole pot and are carried out in a great range of colours: red-on-light, red-on-paler red, red-on-grey, and light- on-dark, less usually red or ochre on near black. The second class, here called Thessalian and presumed to be imported, at all events in the earlier stages, consists of true red, or occasionally brown, on a cream slip or light body, and has a much larger and more elaborate repertory of patterns at its disposal, including dots, chess- board squares, trellis designs and lozenges. The design is carefully executed in solid paint on a strongly contrasted background, and although all surfaces are decorated, including the interiors of open bowls and even the underside of flat bases, its carefully planned disposition respects the shape of the vase. More than one tradition can be distinguished among these imports, with most obvious resemblances to pottery from Tsangli and Arapi. Eventually a hybrid style develops, in which techniques such as blurring are applied to Thessalian flame patterns. More rarely, Servia linear designs are meticulously executed in good red-on-cream. Two other styles of decoration, the painted white-on-red (A3a) and the combination of paint with the so-called cardial pricking, turn up more rarely. The former is typical of the earliest painted ware of the Balkan Starievo culture, and one of our sherds (PLATE 28b upper right) bears a striking resemblance to one from Porodin (Bitola Museum). But there is a similar sherd from Tsangli and this style is indeed well-known from Thessaly, including Sesklo, though always rarer than the reverse red-on-white decoration. Cardial decoration appears late in the Thessalian E.N. and is combined with paint in the M.N. At Servia, where it is absent from the E.N. site and rare in the M.N., it is always found with red-on-cream decoration; the open bowl illustrated 13, though jabbed rather than pricked, shows the same combination of techniques. Shapes of all classes of fine ware comprise open bowls with straight and concave sides, nearly upright or flaring, and S-profile bowls 13-2x; the closed shapes consist of closing bowls and necked and collared jars with ovoid or globular bodies 38, 39. The characteristic funnel- necked jars are usually painted. In addition, the following shapes are confined to the painted classes: large basins with everted or out-turned rims; pedestal bowls 22-5, 37, mug-shaped vases with ribbon handles 29, 30, and S-profiled bowls. Open rounded bowls are of rare occur- rence except on pedestals. Rims are usually plain, except for the everted ones already mentioned, and the thickened out-turned rim 32, which, with its narrow throat, seems to belong to some flask orjuglet. The only known handles are the slim iibbon handles, many of which are flanged, but bases appear in great variety: flat, raised, splayed, and ring. The most typical of the period, though not the commonest, are the pedestal foot and a variety with a slightly raised, usually concave base, separated by a groove from the belly of the pot. Technically the pottery shows a high standard of shaping, firing and finishing, although the Servia style decoration is sometimes slap-dash, rather than deliberately carefree. The sparse inclusions in the fine pottery, usually small sand-grains or quartz fragments are probably ingredients of the raw clay, rather than additions, and the use of filler in the heavier pots is restrained compared with E.B.A. practice. The potters were capable of making really capacious storage vessels and large, thin walled fine vases, which rarely sag or bulge. Some unintentional</page><page sequence="26">210 CRESSIDA RIDLEY AND K. A. WARDLE variegation of the surface occurs but under-firing is very rare. All pots except the exterior of coarse jars were smoothed wherever the hand could reach, and fine pottery is usually slipped or self-slipped, except, perhaps, the cream bodied ware. Monochrome pottery, especially the maroon or dark varieties may be burnished to glossiness, while painted pottery, especially of the Thessalian class, is usually more lightly burnished since the shine would not have enhanced the decorative effect on the cream grounds preferred by this tradition. POTTERY STAGES Earliest Early Middle Late Final STRATIGRAPHIC PHASES I 2 3 4 5 (and 6) EARLIEST This phase may be present, but could not be distinguished everywhere; perhaps it was short-lived as well as limited in extent. No Thessalian imports were found in this small sample but the Servia painted style is represented in a range of colours and technique. No true coarse is found but incised and nail-impressed decoration appears among the medium pottery. The fine monochrome which constitutes the largest class is not of high quality. Open shapes outnumber closing and necked jars. Some E.N. survivals are undoubtedly present and the only complete pot (FIG. 3, II) could well be described as Proto-Sesklo. EARLY (PLATE 28b) A general improvement in quality is noticeable, especially in the thinness of the walls of some fine vases, and in the finish of the monochrome which includes cream-slipped sherds. At least two groups can be distinguished among the first Thessalian imports, one of which is character- ized by a fugitive chalky-white slip. This category is heavily outnumbered by the Servia painted, but the painted class as a whole approaches the monochrome in quantity. Ribbon handles, pedestal bowls and collared jars appear in the repertory of shapes. Another new feature is cardial decoration, combined with paint. Pottery from the upper deposits of this long phase should be considered as transitional to the following phase. MIDDLE This marks perhaps the peak of excellence, so far as the painted pottery is concerned, which now exceeds the monochrome in quantity. A large repertory of designs is in use, and Thessalian patterns are borrowed by the local potters, resulting in blurred flames, although the class is still dominated by the Servia style. A variant of the Thessalian category is decorated in brown, rather than red-on-cream. The fine monochrome, in a wide range of colours, including cream and yellow-buff produces the first really fine black burnished pottery, as well as a heavier type. True coarse, some of it deliberately roughened or furrowed, is present in small amounts. The medium ware still includes incised and is often maroon in colour. Coarse and medium together continue to be outnumbered by the fine. Large vases, including pedestal bowls, are found among the fine pottery. LATE (PLATE 28C) In spite of greater potting skill, shown in the greater size of the vases, the firing and decoration tend to become more careless. The increase in the proportion of painted to monochrome</page><page sequence="27">RESCUE EXCAVATIONS AT SERVIA 1971-1973 211 continues but the medium and coarse category is no longer so greatly outnumbered. The coarse includes some very thick-walled pots and the medium borrows shapes before found only in the fine class, and there is a group of heavy burnished vases which could be considered as belonging to the fine monochrome category. The latter becomes more difficult to define since some of the Servia painted sherds with blurred stripes meandering like rivers and paint smeared liberally over the background, are hard to distinguish, especially when small, from the broken surfaces of the poor monochrome. In the Thessalian category, elaborations of the flame motif are accompanied by old-fashioned toothed bands. Brown paint is found as well as bright red, but misfiring may be responsible for designs carried out in black-on-grey. Two trends are noticeable: the Servia painted tends to be more highly burnished than before, while some pots in the Thessalian style, whether local or imported, are decorated in a thin dry paint with no percep- tible burnish. But the most noteworthy new arrivals are some very fine thin-walled sherds decorated in dull ochre on cream. From fabric, shape and the colour of their silvery-grey interiors, they are clearly precursors of the later grey-on-grey class. Most of the other shapes are familiar, but the ribbon handles are seldom flanged and the rare grooved bases survive only in vestigial form. An S-profile mug or jug with the handle springing from the shoulder is new. FINAL (PLATE 28d) A small sample only could be studied, since this phase has been much mutilated by pits and trenches. The former trends continue, with medium wares increasing and fine monochrome decreasing. Heurtley's conclusion that M.N. pottery continued to be made during the L.N. period is borne out by the present finds, since the condition and size of the M.N. sherds in no way differs from the L.N. pottery with which it is associated in Phase 6. Indeed, the decline can be seen to continue. Coarse pottery contains a new bright flower-pot red, and finger- streaked decoration still occurs among the medium. Fine monochrome, with its broken or streaky surface sometimes due to erratic burnishing, merges into the marbled effect typical of the latest Servia painted style. There are perhaps no longer any Thessalian imports among the fine painted pottery, although clear linear patterns in solid red-on-cream are undoubtedly present. Thin dragged paint in brown-on-white is used for designs of contrasting bands and lines which foreshadow L.N. painted styles. The rare ribbon handles are scarcely flanged at all, and grooved bases, out-turned and everted rims have disappeared. The medium jars are larger, and there is a new type of pedestal foot. To sum up, perfunctory decoration, decline both in quality and variety of shape and pattern and the dissolution of the Servia linear style are typical of this phase. Several features look forward to the next period with which indeed it overlaps in part. SMALL FINDS Although not so rich as some Thessalian sites, Servia produced very many and various small finds during this period. Fragments of square 'altars' or tables, usually painted, were found but none were complete. By far the commonest artefacts were the so-called waisted weights, of which there were over forty. These are flattish river pebbles notched on each side for attach- ment, but otherwise unworked. They could certainly serve as loom-weights, or as net-sinkers which would account for the occasional batter-marks. Ground stone comprised querns, grinders, palettes, and pivot stones; polished stone was remarkable for the splendid axes and chisels, often serpentine. The chipped stone made use of varied raw materials, including flint and produced one or two superb long blades and an arrow-head. Use was made of a local white marble, but the artefacts produced are hard to classify-perhaps they were ornaments</page><page sequence="28">212 CRESSIDA RIDLEY AND K. A. WARDLE (a rod, a heart-shaped plaque, a tusk-shaped object). Beside the usual bone tools there is an antler haft and a presumed belt-hook; the tools are often polished and several seem to have been intentionally toasted or smoked. Several different types of spindle whorls but no loom- weights were found, some terracotta discs may perhaps have been used as lids, and there were some spoons or ladles. Among the most attractive finds were the ornaments, particularly the bracelets in marble and Spondylus shell, PLATE 26C but bone, clay, and stone were also used for tiny disc and tubular beads. The figurines were fragmentary, and disappointing on the whole. One bird-headed figurine is painted in red-on-cream, and the incisions on the back of one torso may represent hair. The most interesting is that illustrated in (PLATE 26d), which belongs to a category best known from southern Greece, although examples have been found elsewhere. Many will have gone unrecognized, since what usually survives is one leg. In the case of the Servia specimen, the figurine seems to have been neatly cut in half and holes bored in each inner side when leather-dry. After firing, the halves could be joined together by small pegs inserted in the holes. The missing leg of the figurine illustrated was found some distance away from its fellow, and a much smaller leg and buttock, red slipped and burnished, remains solitary. Unfortunately, although the shoulder and arm have survived in the case of the first figurine not enough remains to throw light on the question of the head. Was it, too, pegged into a socket? It seems likely. LATE NEOLITHIC PHASE 6 The bedding trench mentioned above is the earliest trace of Late Neolithic activity. Only one corner was located, (see FIG. 7), but the amount which survives shows that the building was large, perhaps about 8 m. x 4 m., like the M.N. buildings which preceded it. This structure had a thin spread of clean clay for its floor level, but it is not certain that this was laid inten- tionally. A large number of post-holes were located in this floor, some of which could belong to internal features, or roof supports, but many others must belong to subsequent buildings which are no longer identifiable. This floor only extended a short way south of the bedding trench, and beyond that there was a yard deposit like that more fully explored in the next phase. After this building had gone out of use, two deep pits were cut through it, and two other pits discovered in the western trench A could well belong to the same period. Three of these pits had a distinctive bottle shape, while the other, which penetrated to the natural clay, was much larger. The function of these bottle-shaped pits is not clear: one similar pit found in another area was lined with clay, and it is possible that they were not originally for storage. Layers of ash and burnt clay in the large pit may indicate cooking activities. Later these pits were filled with debris, and have incidentally preserved good samples of fish bones and car- bonized seeds. The relationship of these pits to any structures cannot be determined, but they lie within an area which was built over before and afterwards, and it is possible that they were dug within the building complex, if not within the actual buildings. PHASE 7 A subsequent Late Neolithic building is constructed in a distinctive manner with double rows of stakes for the walls, single rows for internal partitions, and a number of large posts along the central axis, presumably supporting the roof. The west end of this building was located giving the width of around 4 m., whilst the walls continued more than 5 m. eastwards before being cut off by later features. A clay and pebble hearth was found I.5 m. westwards of this</page><page sequence="29">RESCUE EXCAVATIONS AT SERVIA 1971-1973 213 house. Traces of this type of structure were found in several areas at the same level and particu- larly in the area E (FIG. 6); the clay spreads which make up the floor level can be traced over a wide area north- and westwards. The extensive area investigated at this level gives some idea of the overall plan of the Late Neolithic settlement. In the southern half of area E can be seen a wide expanse of yard area. From the tests made through it to the Middle Neolithic destruction floors below, it is clear that this replaced the M.N. buildings in this area and continued as open space throughout the Late Neolithic occupation. A similar area of yard was observed in the eastern trial C, while remains of houses were found in the eastern part of this trench, and the western trial D. Even from the small portion of the settlement thus investigated a system of blocks of buildings, surrounded by wide yard areas, is apparent. All over the site well-laid floors of clay seem to belong to the last period of L.N. occupation. In two areas burning was noted at this level, and in one of these areas careful excavation of the large area of clay floor exposed revealed that the clay was laid on a substructure of parallel logs whose impressions were preserved beneath the baked floor. The logs, and presumably the house whose floor they formed, lay north-north-west-south-south-east and covered an area roughly 3 m. wide and 7 m. long. Unfortunately the floor was cut away on every side by later disturbance and no trace of walls was discovered. A horse-shoe shaped hearth of clay built directly on the floor surface in the south-east corner of the room may be contemporary, or may be a construction of the Early Bronze Age, since there seems to have been some subsequent terracing, or at least clearance, and Early Bronze Age remains were found immediately over the floor. It seems unlikely that the floor was intentionally fired in order to preserve a durable surface. More probably the firing was accidental, the result of a major catastrophe. Although this destruction was not widespread it marks the end of occupation on the site for perhaps I,500 years. LATE NEOLITHIC POTTERY AND FINDS FIGS. 12-13, PLATE 28e andf During the two phases covered by this period the proportion of fine L.N. pottery steadily increases, and, on the whole, it is only the fine ware which is diagnostic. By phase 7 it may be that M.N. pottery is no longer being manufactured, since many of the M.N. sherds are very worn. But although phase 6 is transitional, it does not seem that the new types developed at Servia. On the contrary, even those which can most convincingly be derived from the M.N. tradition, such as the 'grey-on-grey' painted, apparently appear fully developed. This is even more striking in the black burnished pottery. Although not common, black burnished pottery is present throughout the M.N. period, but it can never be confused with even the heavier L.N. examples. The new pottery falls into two groups. The first, however unrelated to that of the previous period, must be considered local from the frequency of its occurrence. The preponderant class, characteristic of the L.N. at Servia, is the fine black burnished ware and its varieties. The typical shapes are gently profiled or sub-carinated shallow bowls 44, 49, 51; more sharply carinated shapes are also present 47 but are commoner in the less highly burnished heavier vases, often grey or buff rather than black. Other shapes include flaring bowls 48 and small handled cups 45, 46. The bases are flat or flattened, and handles of any description are rare, though waisted lugs can be seen. The commonest style of decoration consists of opposed groups of narrow, parallel ripples, usually oblique, and often combined with a row of beading, with a</page><page sequence="30">214 CRESSIDA RIDLEY AND K.

Closely related is the white-on-black painted class, with open, concave- sided, S-profile or carinated bowls decorated in watery white paint inclined to be fugitive. The simple rectilinear designs resemble the rippled decoration but are not restricted to the shoulder and include a slightly wider range of motifs 53-7. Presumably the rare grey-on-grey ware was also locally manufactured, although Servia examples are indistinguishable from sherds of the same class from Thessalian sites (PLATE 28e). It exists in two varieties, one of which is heavier and typologically more primitive 58; they seem, however, to be contemporary. Shapes include splaying bowls and M.N.-type mugs 6i. Occa- sional orange-on-buff examples, accidentally oxidized, are not unusual. The third class in Heurtley's 'Early Incised', which is admittedly different from any of the local monochrome. The usual shape is a shallow, round-based open bowl or lid, with fairly thick walls 63. The slipped and highly burnished surface, usually dark, but occasionally bright red or tan, is decorated by the impressions of stiff grass stems or straws, later filled with white paste. This pottery has a curious discontinuous distribution, being found at the site of Cakran, in Albania~9 which also produced some of Heurtley's 'Later Incised' pottery and at Stavroupolis, near Thessaloniki, as well as at Servia. The arcaded decoration found on large vases where a burnished area contrasts with vertical furrows ending in an arch of clay pushed in front of the fingers or tool used for scoring, seems native to Servia, although furrowed decoration is not uncommon in the Balkans. Neatly notched or milled rims, not only on coarser wares, are also new. The group of imports is bewildering, in variety, and must be treated with caution. The few examples of true pattern burnish, one or two of which could be described as scraped, and a couple with a sort of stroke-burnished decoration (streifige Politur) could well be of local fabric, but the type is much commoner in Thessaly, (Tsangli and Arapi phases at Arapi Magoula) .20 A whole group of painted sherds, mostly rather small and often poorly stratified, black-on- red 64, brown-on-buff, brown-on-cream (PLATE 28f), and related polychrome pottery-red-on- light sometimes with secondary black, dark-on-red with secondary white and true bichrome decoration-are almost certainly Thessalian. Fruit stands and footed bowls are among the shapes identified in this category. Of unknown origin is the class to which the large open bowl 65 belongs. The slip is a pale crimson; where the paint survives it is brown or very occasionally black, but it has usually vanished, leaving the pattern, very hesitantly executed, visible in higher burnish on the burnished surface. Presumably the paint is manganese, but unless the pot was double-fired it is hard to understand why the paint failed to remove the burnish. This is not the only example of this class. Some small, fine bowls in black-topped buff are probably local, but a group of sherds from very large carinated bowls, the shiny black above the carination cleanly divided from the red below it, immediately recall the vases from Paradimi, in Thrace,2z although similar but smaller pots have been found in the Rhodokhori cave on the west slope of Mount Vermion.22 Some of the black-on-red sherds look Chalcidic (Olynthos, Kritsana) rather than Thessalian, and the 18s Rippled decoration, including curvilinear and spiral motifs, is well represented in fine burnished pottery, grey as well as black, from the Drama plain, (Photolivos- Sitagroi and surface collections). Stray rippled sherds occur at Vardina and at Nea Nikomedeia in L.N. levels. In Thessaly it is best known from the Larissa region while it is rare in the black burnished pottery of central and southern Greece. '9 Studia Albanica ix (1972) fig. 8 and F.

Apart from the straw-impressed ware ('Early Incised'), and one grooved sherd, concentric circles, spirals or spiraloids are otherwise completely unknown in the L.N. of Servia. In conclusion, the L.N. pottery seems to combine two traditions: one, based on the very accomplished black monochrome, shows no connection, in shape, fabric or decoration, with the preceding period. The second, chiefly the varied painted pottery styles, appears to be a development of M.N. traditions, not only in Thessaly, but also in S. Greece (Neolithic Matt- Painted). Some native traits evolve (arcaded) and some elements, such as the straw-impressed and black-topped, techniques are Balkan rather than Greek. The L.N. small finds are much like those of the M.N. except that since there is so much less material they are not only fewer in number but much less varied in type. There is no change in the ground or polished stone, but the chipped stone industry now contains obsidian, although it remains rarer than other silicates. The bone artefacts include a decorated and perforated head of a skewer(?) or pin, and the conical loom-weight is the earliest securely stratified speci- men from Servia. Relatively few ornaments were recovered; the shell and terracotta bracelets and the beads in bone, shell, and terracotta are identical with M.N. examples, but one mala- chite pendant is unique. Only two figurines were found. The head illustrated (PLATE 26f) looks Balkan rather than Greek. Presumably the marble figurines from Heurtley's excavation fall in this period. THE EARLY BRONZE AGE PHASE 8: DITCHES (FIG. 6) Occupation was resumed on the site after a long interval, during the Early Bronze Age. This phase is represented by the fill of a series of large V-shaped ditches up to 3-5 m. deep, and 3 m. wide, which cut through all preceding levels, and penetrated the sterile silt. No strata containing this pottery were found outside the ditches. It must therefore be assumed that terracing during the next period of occupation removed all occupation levels belonging to this phase in the areas excavated by us. It is possible that Heurtley did encounter strata of this phase, to judge by the whole vases published by him (FIG. 14, 77-9), but it is not clear from his reports whether these were distinguished separately. At first it was thought that the ditches might form a double concentric defensive system, but it is now clear that there are too many ditches, with too many different alignments for a single system. In one place, a much slighter ditch was cut by one of the large ditches, showing two phases of ditch digging, but the contents were similar. The one ditch whose path has been traced for any distance seems distinctly serpentine, casting doubt even on the hypothesis that small enclosures bounded separate groups of houses or single farmsteads. We found no trace of associated banks. The cause of the infilling of the ditches is as uncertain as the original cause of construction. This fill is uniform from top to bottom, apart from two areas where a distinct surface was discovered about two-thirds of the way up. Occupation debris and large bones were found on this surface. The pottery characteristic of the whole of this fill is the fine thickly slipped ware described below, mixed throughout with Neolithic sherds: there was a higher proportion of Middle Neolithic pottery near the bottom. Similar ditches were easily observed in the Bridge Works section, 50 m. to the south-west, showing that the complex of ditches extended over a large part of the site. 8569078 P</page><page sequence="34">218 CRESSIDA RIDLEY AND K. A. WARDLE POTTERY FROM THE DITCHES (FIG. I4) The fill of the ditches contained a distinctive type of pottery which can readily be distin- guished from the black burnished Neolithic wares or the coated fabric of the later Early Bronze Age levels. Heurtley recognized this ware, which he called 'Varnished Ware', but assigned it to the Late Neolithic phase. The ware is thick and fairly heavy, breaking into small chunky fragments to reveal a dark fabric with a vegetable filler. Both surfaces have a thick glossy slip, probably applied with a brush, which has crazed during or after firing. Normally both brush marks and crazing can be seen. The predominant colour is dull black, although orange, red, and brown are also found. Several of the larger pieces show variegation, probably indicating irregular firing. Only a few shapes occur. The commonest is a wide open bowl about 30 cm. in diameter, with a slightly incurving rim 67, 68, 77. Occasionally this is decorated with knobs or vertically pierced lugs 73, but no handles were recognized. Large bowls with a short carinated upper body are frequent, 69, 79: these have a similar rim diameter and sometimes have a small vertical handle placed between rim and carination. The ribbed decoration of the example illustrated is unusual. Rarer shapes are conical bowls with flattened out-turned rims 70 (diameter c. 32 cm.) and small cups or bowls with pinched rims 71-2, 78 (diameter. c. 12 cm.). No closed vessels were identified in this fabric. Bases were simple: either flat or slightly rounded. Incised or stamped decoration is rare, but plastic additions are more common: the majority of these are knobs or lugs, often pierced, but few are large enough to be functional 74. This fine ware is widespread in Thessaly and occurs further south. Its presence on excavated sites has only been reported in the case of Argissa where it was also found in a ditch.23 It is the most abundant surface material at the site of Tatar Magoula north-west of Larissa and has been designated 'Tatar' ware by French in his classification of the prehistoric pottery from Thessaly and Macedonia in the collection of the British School at Athens. It is clear that this ware must have been accompanied by vessels with coarser fabric but the mixture with earlier pottery in the ditches prevented us from identifying much of the contem- porary coarse ware with certainty. Some coarse sherds were thinly coated with a dull red slip not unlike that on the fine ware, while another group, not found in any context other than the ditches, combined a sand-roughened exterior surface with a dull red slip on the interior and also on the smooth parts of the exterior. The sherds seem to be from large open jars 75. A few sherds of wart-covered ware come from these ditches but could be of Neolithic date since a similar fragment was clearly stratified in the lowest levels, cf. FIG. 3, 12. As with the coarse ware, it is difficult to decide which of the various small objects from the ditches are contemporary with the fine ware described above. Apart from a single incised spindle whorl no object occurs exclusively in the ditches and perhaps the most important observation, in contrast to the later Early Bronze Age levels, is the absence of clay anchors. PHASE 9 After the ditches had gone out of use and had been almost completely filled, probably inten- tionally, the site continued to be occupied, but the pottery found in these upper levels is new, and there must be either a break in occupation, or a stratigraphic discontinuity caused by the levelling which removed all traces of the occupation corresponding to the ditches. Two phases can be distinguished from the stratigraphy, 9 and io, separated by the series of house floors found in almost every area. No structures could be identified below these floors 23 E.

A. WARDLE but a large number of shallow irregular pits which antedate the floors are filled with hard clay debris which, although unburnt, bears the impressions of timbers and branches. Pre- sumably the earliest buildings were levelled into the pits before construction of the buildings whose floors are preserved. One of these pits, which was comparatively large, contained a large amount of pottery, including several almost complete vessels, and quantities of loose ash. PHASE IO Three successive spreads of white clay over much of the area of the main trenches indicate the floor levels of buildings which must have existed in this area. It is not certain whether these represent laid floors or whether they are simply spreads of wall-plastering material which covered successive trodden floor surfaces. The traces of buildings were not clear, partly because these levels are just below the modern surface. Pebbled yards, however, bound the white floors on the south and east and a small number of slight post-holes were found along this boundary. A parallel row of post-holes suggests a width of around 3 m. while the white floors could be traced about 8 m. northwards before they were ploughed away. Two or three surfaces strewn with large sherds and bones were noted in the yard areas indicating some duration of occupation. A small fragment of hearth found in the area occupied by the floors seemed to have been constructed solely of clay, without the pebble core used in the Middle and Late Neolithic hearths. A large coarse storage jar was set into the clay floor in the southern part of the area. POTTERY AND OTHER FINDS FROM THE PITS, FLOOR AND YARD SURFACES PHASES 9 AND 10 FIGS. 15, 16, AND 17 Four types of context can be distinguished in the E.B.A. levels: (a) deposits under the floors with a large proportion of earlier material; (b) pits under the floors containing building debris and large quantities of broken pottery, including many restorable vases which have provided the basic information about shapes in use; (c) levels over the clay floors, presumed to represent house interiors, which contained small sherds but also a few complete vases; (d) yard surfaces strewn with pebbles, bone, sherd and other debris. As far as the pottery is concerned, however, there is no obvious distinction between the different contexts. Some shapes are perhaps more common above the floors, but numerical analysis of the pottery, which may disclose the varia- tions, will be reserved for the final report. The majority of the E.B.A. pottery is of local manufacture but a small number of imports allow correlation with the Early Bronze Age of southern Greece. These include fragments of 'yellow mottled ware', of which one is a sauceboat spout, and examples of plates in red-slipped ware 8o, both assignable to the E.H. II period.24 Dark-coated 'smear ware' as known in E.H. III contexts was also identified together with shapes in local fabric proper to the same period in southern Greece, for example two-handled mugs and elegant jugs, as well as the clay anchors typical of this horizon throughout the Aegean area. It is of interest that determinations of firing temperatures have revealed that both the yellow mottled and smear ware fragments are fired at considerably higher temperatures than the local wares (Appendix 5). The local pottery includes a variety of fabrics: fine black 'coated and burnished' ware; coated unburnished ware of similar quality in red or, more rarely, black; uncoated medium to fine ware, often decorated with scoring; baking plates in similar but coarser fabric; coarse ware often roughly burnished or with the surface intentionally roughened. 24 J.

The fabric is usually light buff in colour and thin though slightly gritty. The exterior surface is thinly coated with a slip which normally fires to a lustrous black which may show marks of a fine burnishing tool; red or brown occur rarely. The interior surface is wiped or scored, perhaps with a handful of grasses, but left uncoated. The most frequent shape in this ware is the wide open bowl with inturned rim 81, 89, or less commonly, a sharply inverted 83 or a T-rim 84, 86. These flat-based bowls normally have two 112 0 5 loms 113 FIG 17 SERVIA EARLY BRONZE AGE or four ledge-lugs placed below the rim 81, but these are sometimes combined with tubular lugs or with horizontal handles 82, 83, 87, 88. Other shapes include tall necked jugs with small ring base and strap handle from neck to belly go, 91, jars with collar necks and tubular or pierced lug handles 93, 94. Mugs with two handles are rare and usually made in the roughly burnished coarse ware described below. The unburnished coated ware is very rare but seems to exhibit the same range of shapes. The uncoated wares, usually buff in colour, have the same basic fabric and repertoire of forms. Open or incurving bowls are common 95, though some fragments may be from lids such as the complete example 96. Decoration, effected by scoring the outer surface in different ways, perhaps using twigs or grasses, is often found on these bowls. Small conical scoops with pointed or rounded bases and high-swung handles are only made in this fabric 98-0oo. A heavier ware, firing red-brown as well as buff, is used for medium-sized storage jars, probably with ovoid bodies and deep necks. The transition from neck to shoulder is frequently marked by a finger-impressed plastic cordon, often with a neat rope-like appearance 1I2. Scored decoration</page><page sequence="40">224 CRESSIDA RIDLEY AND K. A. WARDLE is normal below the cordon and may even run over the large tubular lug handles found on this shape. Baking plates with a diameter of over 60o cm. are made in a similar, but grittier fabric I 13. Their splaying walls may be equipped with a 'spout' and with holes pierced regularly around the rim. Notched rims and scored decoration may also be found. Occasionally fragments have an internal ledge lug. The base is always slightly rounded and is smooth on the interior but roughened on the exterior where it has been bedded in sand or earth for support during and perhaps after manufacture, drying and firing. The function of these vessels is not understood despite their frequent occurrence in Aegean E.B.A. contexts. Coarse ware, with a high grit content, rough surface, either porous or roughly burnished, and firing in a range of colours from red to black is used for some small vessels. Among these are small open bowls, often with notched rims and ledge lugs 1o4--8, and one- or two-handled mugs 103. Larger storage jars of simple shape also occur IIo-II. Plastic decoration, apart from cordons and notched rims, and incised decoration are both rare. Small objects include many examples of terracotta 'anchors', conical and bi-conical spindle whorls and pyramidal loom-weights. Polished stone axes and waisted stone weights are rare and the examples present may have been thrown up from earlier levels where they are far commoner. A single bored axe, however, probably does belong to this level. Chipped stone tools include sickle insets and a single arrowhead of chert, while obsidian is more common than in the Late Neolithic. Two metal objects, a long needle and a shapeless lump, were found in these strata and have been analysed by X-ray fluorescence (Appendix 6). Their composition is principally copper with small quantities of arsenic and iron. CONCLUSIONS The facts related and the objects described in the previous pages suggest the following pro- visional reconstruction of the history of the site and of its chronological relationship to other areas. An Early Neolithic community, perhaps setting off from near Elasson, about 50 km. to the south, crossed the watershed separating the Peneios from the Haliakmon Valley and founded a settlement on the right bank of that river. They brought with them their domestic animals and crops and their knowledge of weaving and stone working. They remained in touch with their original home and perhaps with other villages, probably importing some pottery as well as the contents of the pots. Miss Wijnen's study of the pottery suggests that these events occurred about halfway through the Early Neolithic period as known at Sesklo. We cannot know what caused the abandonment of the Servia V site, particularly as the settlement itself has not been found or excavated, but the simplest hypothesis is to suppose that the inhabitants moved a few hundred yards upstream and refounded their village. No E.N. levels have been found at the main site but both Heurtley's and the recent excavation have produced undeniable E.N. pottery. We may surmise that the original community was joined by fresh arrivals, perhaps from Tsangli or its neighbourhood. It seems certain that some new impulse or impetus from Thessaly, however transmitted, initiated a new period, with finer pottery and a more discriminating choice of raw material for the chipped stone industry, as well as the necessary tools and techniques for building solid houses with large, deep-set timber uprights, and in some cases plank floors. They, too, imported pottery, but from a rather wider area than their predecessors: not only from Tsangli and other Thessalian sites, but also</page><page sequence="41">RESCUE EXCAVATIONS AT SERVIA 1971-1973 225 from Porodin or a similar settlement in the Bitola region. Besides pottery, spondylus and other sea shells were imported for making ornaments. The polished axes and chisels were made of a variety of minerals. Obsidian, however, did not reach Servia at this period. They ignored or rejected mud-brick as a building material although suitable clay is available in the neighbour- hood and stones for footings lay close at hand in the river bed. Their ovens were well constructed. Occasional fires, of which traces were found in early levels, damaged the settlement, but none of these were so destructive or so widespread as the catastrophic fire which started in the west, was carried by the prevailing wind, and destroyed the whole village. This disaster did not lead to the desertion of the site, but the rebuilt village seems to have been smaller than its predecessor and the houses less solidly built. The pottery from this long period of occupation demonstrates gradual changes and the sequence and imports indicate that the Middle Neolithic occupation of Servia was comparable to that at sites such as Sesklo, Argissa and Tsangli, although it may not have begun so early. There is no evidence for the arrival of new people during the relatively short Late Neolithic period that follows. The houses, the economy and the artefacts apart from the pottery remain unchanged, though the habit of digging deep storage pits is new as also the use of logs for the substructure of floors. The inhabitants were now able to obtain obsidian and the imported pottery shows contact with places as far away as Albania, East Macedonia, and perhaps the Peloponnese. Yet the L.N. pottery assemblage at Servia is no longer Thessalian: it is peculiar to the site. The Late Neolithic pottery from Servia, representing only a short period of occupation, seems to correspond to the Tsangli and perhaps to the Arapi phases in Thessaly, on the basis of the painted imports, but it is not identical with the early L.N. of any Thessalian site so far published. Black burnished pottery much like that from Servia, has been known in Thessaly for many years but it was without context and was first classified by Grundmann on a typological basis as Larissa ware.25 In the recent excavations at Arapi and Otzaki the stratigraphic position of this pottery was hard to determine, chiefly because it appeared only in pits, usually accom- panied by grey-on-grey ware, and on one occasion it seemed to overlie the Dimini levels. The late Professor Miloj6i6, after weighing the evidence carefully, decided with reservations that this pottery followed the Dimini and preceded the Rakhmani phases. It may well be that a phase in which black burnished pottery is dominant is present in the Final Neolithic of Thes- saly, as in southern Greece, and the cremation urns from the Souphli Magoula cemetery may belong to it.26 Most of the published Larissa shapes from Arapi and Otzaki look contemporary with the Servia L.N., which undoubtedly precedes any Dimini phase. In a more general way the Servia L.N. can be equated with the Forum West material from Corinth,27 with the earliest pottery from central Macedonian sites like Vardina and with early Photolivos-Sitagroi in eastern Macedonia. In Balkan terms it runs parallel with Vinia A sensu lato at sites such as Veluika Toumba and Anza IV.28 The destruction which ends the L.N. does not seem a very widespread one, since it was visible in only a few places but it led to the total abandonment of the site for about fifteen centuries. A flat-topped hill called Vasiliara, standing back from the river about 5 km. down- stream, seems from the evidence of the surface sherds to have been occupied during the 25 Kimon Grundmann, Ath.

WARDLE subsequent phases of the Late Neolithic through to the E.B.A. It seems likely that the inhabitants of Servia moved to this more defensible, though less convenient position. From there they returned perhaps, to occupy the original site many generations later. In the Early Bronze Age, the Servia site was again occupied but we know very little of the nature of the settlement, since the remains are so near the surface. The deposit does not, how- ever, indicate any great length of occupation nor is there sufficient variety of material to correspond with all the E.B.A. phases known in Thessaly, for example. The first phase of occupation took place probably in the E.B.2. period as indicated by the pottery with its strong Thessalian connections. All we know of this stage is the series of large ditches, like those reported for a similar period at Argissa. Their defensive function is not clear. In the second phase the pottery shows connection with central Macedonia as well as with Thessaly and there are a few imports to suggest that this phase is contemporary with the latter part of E.H. II and with early E.H. III. No further trace of regular occupation was discovered by excavation at Servia. CRESSIDA RIDLEY K. A.

The dates for the earliest Middle Neolithic and for the Early Bronze Age both appear to be too late: the former because it is out of sequence and the latter in comparison with other Aegean E.B.A. dates. No explanation for these discrepancies can be given. The sequence of dates from Early Neolithic to Late Neolithic is consistent but compresses many building phases and changes in pottery style into a time span of no more than 300 years. As a group the Middle Neolithic dates are comparable with others for this period in mainland Greece.29 APPENDIX 2: ANCIENT AGRICULTURE AND ECOLOGY AT SERVIA The Middle Neolithic and later archaeological samples from Servia are to be reported upon by Dr. Renfrew; and it would thus be inappropriate to make anything other than generalized comments based on the impressions received during the extraction of this material. The crops being cultivated were much the same as those in use all over the Balkan peninsula in earlier prehistoric times-einkorn and emmer, the naked and hulled subspecies of six-row barley, lentils, and peas. When excavating the burnt out basement room in trench D it was interesting to encounter clean stored crops of lentils, Lathyrus sativus, and a variety of einkorn in which the majority of the florets were two seeded. The Middle Neolithic agriculture seemed to bear 29 D.

Grape pips were noticed first in Late Neolithic contexts. An interesting aspect of prehistoric agriculture may have been clarified during the Servia excavations. It has been mentioned that the remains of a clean crop of Lathyrus sativus were found in the Middle Neolithic destroyed basement room. Lathyrus sativus and Vicia ervilia were both widely cultivated at different periods in the Balkans in prehistoric times. Both pulses, however, are notorious for causing lathyrism, an unpleasant and occasionally fatal paralytic condition affecting the lower limbs in particular, and attributed (in Lathyrus sativus and its ancestor L. cicera at least), to the presence of the water soluble (P-N-oxalyl)ap-diaminopropionic acid in the seed coat.32 The Lathyrus found in the basement room was associated with a 20 1. Sesklo collar-necked jar-which also yielded an impression of a Sitophilus weevil. Although the jar itself was about one-third full of carbonized Lathyrus seeds, the spread of seeds around the crushed fragments of the jar was rather even, and did not particularly suggest the scattering of the dry contents of a falling or overturned pot. We suspect that the Lathyrus seeds had been soaking in water to rid them of their poisonous component when the building caught fire, and that the seeds have been washed out of the pot by the escaping water when the vessel overturned and was crushed. Initial investigation of the Early Neolithic agriculture shows that it was in qualitative terms very similar to that of the Middle Neolithic period. Flax was already being cultivated. The stones of fruits such as cherries and Cornus mas were conspicuously more common than in the later periods. An extremely interesting difference lay in the cultivation of two-row hulled barley. A rubber cast of the articulated lower half-dozen florets of an ear of Hordeum distichon was recovered from a lump of Early Neolithic daub. With the exception of the medieval period and of certain finds of the Roman era, the only reliable identification of Hordeum distichon (i.e. ones based on internodes or more than 2-3 grains) from prehistoric European archaeologi- cal sites are those by Dr. Renfrew from the Early Neolithic sites of Thessaly.33 We thus appear to have a botanical analogue to the affinities shown by the E.N. pottery of Servia. In this context it is interesting to note that at Nea Nikomedeia, the only barley cultivated was the naked six-row kind.34 ECOLOGY With none of the pollen samples yet prepared or analysed, only a few molluscan assemblies examined, and studies of the charcoal from Servia hardly much further advanced, only tenta- tive paleoecological reconstruction can be attempted: none the less, certain patterns are recog- nizable. Until the construction of the Polyphytou dam and the consequent flooding, the bottom of the Haliakmon valley was under cultivation and was entirely deforested. The only trees were cultivated, and sub-spontaneous poplars interspersed with spiny thickets of Paliurus spina- christi. The ground rising to the north-west towards Kozani is equally open, but with a regular scattering of the small wild pear Pyrus amygdaliformis and further tangles of Paliurus. The ridge of limestone hills that overlooked the site from across the Haliakmon to the north-east is 30 M. Hopf, 'Fruhe Kulturpflanzen aus Bulgarien', JRGZM xx (1973) I. 31 J. M. Renfrew in A. C.

WARDLE covered with a non-mediterranean Greek pseudo-maquis of evergreen Q uercus coccifera and Juniperus oxycedrus scrub. Ecological common sense, and inspection of Bottema's admirable palynological investiga- tions in northern Greece,35 suggest that at the time of the prehistoric settlement, the valley bottom would have been covered with a dense mixed oak forest, in which Quercus cerris would be expected to be predominant. The charcoal analyses that have been completed so far record maple, plum-type, ash, and poplar, with pine and deciduous oak dominating. Evergreen oak-type charcoal has not yet been found. The recovery of a piece of daub bearing leaf impressions from a Middle Neolithic post-pit confirmed the presence of Quercus cerris. Terrestrial snail shells were reasonably abundant at Servia. Why this was so is not clear, for at the Yugoslav Late Neolithic site of Selevac molluscan remains were almost entirely absent, although the site seems comparable in many respects to Servia. In the Early Neolithic samples, snails of shaded environments are about as common as ones characteristic of dry, open condi- tions. The latter group appears to increase in samples of later date, and Chondrula tridens is so common in some samples that it must have been living on the spot. The persistence of 'wood- land' species in what must have been an essentially open space could be explained by the snails' use of the thatched wattle-and-daub houses as surrogate woodland, or by their importation on the wood being used for building. Equally, the daub used in building could have contained snail shells. A Clausiliid observed firmly embedded in a piece of burnt daub, and the occasional impressions of snail shells in pottery illustrate the possible dangers of an over-simplified approach to the interpretation of molluscan evidence from such contexts. R. N. L. HUBBARD APPENDIX 3: FAUNAL REMAINS Preliminary identifications of a part of the mammal bone recovered in 1972 have been made. From an examination of the extra material recovered by sieving both at Servia and elsewhere, it has been possible to judge the size of the sample bias against smaller animals and propose tentative correction factors. When the correction factors are applied, the following estimates of the importance of the various artiodactyl species emerge. In the Early Neolithic, sheep and goat are overwhelmingly predominant, at about 60o per cent of the bone remains. Pig and cattle are next in importance at about 15 per cent each. Red deer and roe deer make up the remaining I o per cent. In the Middle Neolithic, there is a large increase in pig, to about 40 per cent of the remains. Sheep and goat decline to about 40 per cent. Roe deer, cattle, and red deer make up the remain- ing 20 per cent. In the Late Neolithic, sheep and goat predominate in a very small sample. Pig, cattle, red deer, and roe deer are present. The Early Bronze Age resembles the Middle Neolithic, except that roe deer are not recorded. Sheep and goat account for 50 per cent of the remains, and pig 35 per cent. Cattle are about 10 per cent and red deer make up the remainder. Other species represented are bear and a small canid in the Early Neolithic, hare and large and small canids in the Middle Neolithic, hedgehog and a large canid in the Late Neolithic, and a large canid and an equid in the Early Bronze Age. When sample bias is allowed for, sheep and goats are seen to be commoner than would have been imagined at first sight. This implies that a good deal of grazing land must have been 35 S.

However, the high proportion of pig in the Middle Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, and the presence of deer suggest that there was still plenty of woodland left in the valley. It is tempting to speculate that the predominance of sheep, goats, and cattle in the Early Neolithic, rather than corresponding to a more open countryside, may be an indication that the occupants of Varytimidhes were immigrants from an area more suited to those species, the subsequent increase of pig and deer in the Middle Neolithic representing an adjustment towards an economy more appropriate to western Macedonia. The single equid bone found in the Early Bronze Age would seem to be a horse from its size. The level in question should be free from intrusions, but it would be rash to jump to conclusions from a single bone, although the presence of horse in the Early Bronze Age would not be a great surprise. J. P. N. WATSON APPENDIX 4: POTTERY TECHNOLOGY Thirty pottery samples, chosen to cover as completely as possible the range of wares repre- sented in the three Neolithic and the two Early Bronze Age periods, were examined by Dr. M. S. Tite and Dr. Y. Maniatis, then of Essex University, using the scanning electron micro- scope (SEM). The interesting results show that during all periods, except the E.N. (for which only six sherds were examined), at least two different sources of clay, calcareous and non- calcareous, were exploited. The firing temperatures for all periods, falling in the range 750- 850 oC. are compatible with simple bonfire methods. Exceptions are a single E.N. 'china' sherd and two clear E.B.A. imports: a sauceboat fragment in 'yellow mottled ware' and a fragment of 'smear ware'. The sauceboat sherd was certainly fired between 850-1050 oC., which implies the use of a kiln.36 APPENDIX 5: OBSIDIAN Twelve samples of obsidian from the main site, nine from L.N., and three from E.B.A. contexts, as well as one surface find from the E.N. site were submitted to Dr. Arnold Aspinall and Dr. Stanley Warren of the Postgraduate School of Physics, University of Bradford, for analysis by neutron activation. In appearance, all were similar, and resembled Melian obsidian. Ten samples proved to have come from Melos: five each from the Adhamas and the Dhemene- gaki sites. The two remaining samples are of unknown origin. In addition, three pieces of a transparent, smoky-grey mineral, one from a M.N. and two from E.B.A. contexts, proved to be flint. These might easily be confused with obsidian, though not with the Melian variety. Since no obsidian occurs in any but L.N. and E.B.A. levels, the surface find at Servia V where L.N. pottery also occurred, can be confidently assumed to be L.N. in date. APPENDIX 6: Two METAL OBJECTS FROM SERVIA Two metal objects from Servia were analysed by X-ray fluorescence using the Isoprobe.37 The surface condition of the objects was poor; the three positions of analysis on the heavy metal object (sample I) were on a cuprous oxide layer, and the two positions on the needle (sample 2) were on a layer consisting of cuprous oxide with some malachite corrosion products. Both samples were free of soil contamination. The analyses gave the following approximate 36 A fuller account can be found in Nature cclvii, 122-3. 37 E. T. Hall, F. Schweitzer and P. A.

The notable feature of the compositions is the presence of iron in the copper, a phenomenon which has been investigated by Cooke and Aschenbrenner in connection with its discovery in copper samples at Nichoria in Messenia.38 Mention should be made of the analyses by Davies, despite the questioning of their validity by Craddock,39 of four metal objects from the Toumba and Tables of Vardaroftsa in Macedonia.40 Two of these, a fragment of a pin (Period A, E.B.A.) and a fragment of a blade (Period C, M.B.A.-L.B.A.) had high iron contents (3.18 and 24'5 per cent respectively).
