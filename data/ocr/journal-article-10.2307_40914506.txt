Richardson III On a daybook, or account book, kept by Matthew May hew between 1 780-1 785, is a thunderbird (bird figure) covering most of the back of the daybook cover. The thunderbird is 12 V2 inches from wing tip to wing tip and 9 inches from head to tip of the tail feathers. The thunderbird plays an important role in Algonquian cosmologies. This is the earliest and most elaborate ethnographic example of a thunderbird from New England. INTRODUCTION The recent inventory and proper storage of 165 eighteenth and nineteenth century daybooks (store account ledgers) in the Martha's Vineyard Museum, funded by an National Endowment for the Humanities Preservation and Access Grant #PA-24305-02 in 2002/3, revealed an extraordinary volume. Impressed on the cover of daybook no. 65 (accession MVM/AB65) is the "Michelangelo" of thunderbird motifs (Figure 1). Although museum staff and scholars have handled the Mayhew daybook, no one recognized the cover design until Jill Bouck turned it in a raking light and saw the outline of what appeared to be a leaf on the front cover. On turning the daybook to the back cover she identified the thunderbird for the first time. THE MATTHEW MAYHEW DAYBOOK The daybook was kept by Matthew Mayhew, a boat builder, between 1780-1785 and consists of 1 0 paper sheets 15.5 inches in width and 12.75 inches tall. There were 1 1 sheets, but at some point one-half of a sheet was torn out of the daybook. The sheets are folded to make 20 pages with account entries on both sides. They are hand sewn into the hide cover. There are sporadic single accounts beginning in 1766 with four more entries in the 1770s, which are believed to be carryovers from an earlier Mayhew daybook. All 10 sheets have a distinctive watermark. In the center of one side of the sheet is a Britannia figure in an oval 3.75 inches wide x 5.5 tall with the letters TB at the oval's base (Figure 2). On the reverse side is a crown (1.5 inches wide and 1.75 tall) with GR (Georges Rex) under it (Figure 3). According to Foreign Watermarks ... 1 700-1835, TB is the initials of Thomas Budgen, a paper maker in Kent, England. Budgen was in business at least by 1778 to 1802 (Gravell and Miller 1983, 2002). Matthew Mayhew was the great, great, great grandson of Thomas Mayhew Sr. (1592-1682), who obtained settlement rights to Martha's Vineyard in October of 1 64 1 from the Earl of Stirling. He and his lineal male descendants through William (1784-1849) were all known as the Lord of the Manor. In 1643, his son Thomas Mayhew Jr. ( 1 620/2 1 - 1 657) was sent to settle in Edgartown and in 1 646 his father also moved to the Vineyard's first European town. Thomas Mayhew Jr. became the first missionary of a long line of Mayhew's who brought Christianity to the Vineyard Wampanoag. He was lost at sea on a trip to England. His father and Thomas Mayhew Jr's son, Matthew Mayhew (1674-1720), carried on the mission work. Matthew's son Micajah Mayhew (1697-1760), a farmer, was the father of Matthew Mayhew (1723-1799) who kept the daybook and ran the family business on the waterfront in Edgartown. Matthew Mayhew took over his Father's store and tavern in 1760 on South Water Street in Edgartown (Figure 4). The store sold liquor, general merchandise and lumber, both through purchase and barter (Banks 1911, vol. 2:180). The account Archaeology of Eastern North America (2007) 35:1 1-19</page><page sequence="2">1 2 Archaeology of Eastern North America Figure 1. Matthew Mayhew daybook back cover (MVM/AB 65). book consists of two sections, the first of 18 double-sided pages listing 73 English surname accounts and six Wampanoag accounts. The second section has accounts written upside- down in relation to the first section, and consists of four Wampanoag accounts on two double-sided pages. The listing of Wampanoag entries upside-down in relation to English customers is found in a number of the Vineyard daybooks. THE WAMPANOAG AND CHRISTIANITY From the English viewpoint the Indian Christian missions of eastern and southeastern Massachusetts were most successful on Martha's Vine- yard. By 1674, only one family of 300 or so Wampanoag families were not practicing the Christian religion and the 1 ,500 Christian Wampanoags on the Vineyard surpassed the num- ber of converts on the mainland (Silverman 2003:267, 2005: 73). As Silverman (2005:73-77) relates, this was due to close interaction between the English and Wampanoag on the island, the respect the Mayhew 's had for Wampanoag land rights, knowl- edge of their traditional culture, their fluency in Wampanoag, and the train- ing and use of Wampanoag mission- aries. Due to the English view of the unchristian nature of their traditional clothing, by 1700 the Wampanoag began to depend upon store bought goods and cloths. It was also after 1700, due to English land purchases from the Wampanoag and introduced European agriculture and herding, that the Wampanoag changed their traditional subsistence practices, not only adopting English ones, but serving as laborers, much of this as debt servitude (Ibid: 191-193). They also entered the cash economy and bought ever increasing amounts of foods from the Vineyard English stores (Ibid: 192- 193, Table 2). The Wampanoag population fluctuated from an estimate of 3,000 in 1642 to 800 in 1720 and up through 1861, 400 or so, including 1786, a year after the daybook fell out of use (Ibid: 285, Appendix A). By 1823 only six Wampanoag could speak their language and in 1821 Zachariah Howwoswee (1736-1821), the last preacher using Wampanoag in his sermons, died. He was also the last Wampanoag who could read publications written in Wampanoag (Ibid: 221, 236). The English missionaries also targeted traditional religious beliefs, and by 1 700 many aspects of the Wampanoag belief system were replaced by Christian religion or went "underground" (Ibid, chapter 2).</page><page sequence="3">A Wampanoag Thunderbird on an Eighteenth-century English Manuscript 1 3 Figure 3. Crown watermark. Figure 2 (left). Britannia watermark. THE WAMPANOAG IN THE MAYHEW DAYBOOK Only 10 of the Wampanoag transactions are listed by name in the Mayhew daybook, all from Chappaquidick. For example, John Joel Jr. (Segel and Pierce 2003: #311) purchased corn, beans, molasses, pork, a great coat and handkerchief from the store in 1781 and 1782 and set- tled his account with a pig, a bar- rel of whale oil and two-thirds share of his wages from a whaling voyage. John Joel Jr. died some- time before August 5, 1783. Another Wampanoag entry, Figure 4. Mayhew house c. 1890 Edgartown, MA. (MVM Coffin collection) Israel Cagnahew (Ibid: #313), lived near John Joel Jr. on Chappaquidick and appears in documents from 1773-1784 and in the daybook in 1783. Items purchased by Cagnahew or his wife include: candles, sugar, flour, tea, tobacco, shoes, a silk handerchief and cloth for an apron. The accounts were settled by Captain James Whipple, John Pease and William Roche and Son, possibly related to Cagnahew 's employment on whaleships. Israel Cagnahew was the only surviving male heir (grandson) to Jacob Seiknout (Ibid: #119), an Indian sachem of Chappaquidick. His mother was Hepzibah (Seiknout) Cagnahew (Ibid: #461), "Queen Sachim of Chapoquidick and Mosskeekett and right heir unto Jacob Secknout" (Ibid: #461). His father was Samuel Cagnahew Jr. (Cackenehue) (Ibid: #315) who was paid as a minister in 1764 (Ibid: #315). He died sometime in late 1 784.</page><page sequence="4">H Archaeology of Eastern North America figure 5. Composite thunderbird on daybook covers. THE MAYHEW THUNDERBIRD The Mayhew thunderbird is a portrayal of a bird figure, covering most of the back of the daybook cover. The thunderbird is 12 Vi inches from wing tip to wing tip and 9 inches from head to tip of the tail feathers (Figure 5). The head is turned left with a recog- nizable beak (Figure 6), and the wings and body are of stylized feathers. There are 2 talons (Figure 7) projecting at the juncture of the body and tail feathers. The daybook cover is of stiff animal hide. Its raw interior still shows signs (Figure 8) of blood stains from its preparation. Note the pressure ridges from the impressed wing design on the cover. After the thunderbird was im- pressed, a tool, with multiple cutting Figure 6. Head of daybook thunderbird. "teeth" was used to make parallel in- cised marks over the thunderbird (see Figures 6 and 7). The cover may have been cut down from a larger hide and great care was taken to ensure that the thunderbird remained intact. Most of the thunderbird impression is on the back cover which is the only way, after the folding of the hide, that the design would appear on the daybook. THUNDERBIRD TIME DEPTH The thunderbird plays an important role in Algonquian cosmologies. The thunderbird Figure 7. Talons of daybook thunderbird. holds sway over the upper world while the underwater panther or serpent rules the under- world (Bradley 1995:33; Bragdon 1996:188). The thun- derbird causes thunder by flapping its wings and throwing lightening bolts at the underwater creatures (Cleland et al. 1984:238). There is great time depth to the portrayal of the thunderbird and underwater panther or serpent in both rock art and artifacts (Diaz-Granados and Duncan 2004; Keyser and Klassen 2002; Lenik 2002; Weeks 2002). The depictions of the thunderbirds range from headless triangular figures, to recognizable birds or anthropomorphized birds reflecting shamanistic practices.</page><page sequence="5">A Wampanoag Thunderbird on an Eighteenth-century English Manuscript 1 5 The underwater serpents are usually portrayed as recognizable snakes. The one pictured here (Figure 9) is from feature 179 at the Titicut site in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. The feature is covered in red ochre suggesting a Late Archaic date (Lenik 2002:134-135; Robbins 1967: 48, figure 6, no. 8 and 49). In form, the thunderbirds have an X- shaped appearance, which ranges from recog- nizable birds to simply an incised X. Hedden (1991: 46), following Mallery (1883) and Hoffman (1891), indicates that the X figures represent the intersection between the upper and lower worlds. Among the Ojibwa, thunderbirds are an essential part of the Mide -Wi-Win Society (Cleland 1984; Hoffman 1891; Landes 1968; Weeks 2002:53-55). In Michigan at the Hampsher site, dating to between A.D. 1250-1400, the Mide-wi-win discs have X-shaped thunderbirds with and without heads (Cleland 1984: 240, figure 2C; 1985:132, figure 5 A). The Hampsher headless thunderbird is very similar to the undated one from Pond Island, Blue Hill Bay, Maine (Hedden 1991). One of the earliest known examples of the depiction of the X figure dates to the Adena time period. At Cresup Mound, West Virginia there is the gorget with the X Figure 8. Interior of daybook front hide cover showing blood staining and thunderbird wing. figure identified by Jim Petersen dating to circa 2000 B.P. (Figure 10)(Dragoo 1963: 41, 42 plate 17; Richardson and Swauger 1996:46). Also a recently discovered petroglyph site in Ohio is replete with thunderbirds (Murphy et al. 2006). There is also a thunderbird figure on an Adena blocked end tubular pipe from a grave in Swanton, Vermont with three undecipher- able marks below the figure (Lenik 2002: 112, figure 87; Willoughby 1935: 93-95, Figure 50a and b). In Massachusetts there is the famous Hopewell pipe from Revere Beach that has anthropomorph figures, possibly rep- resenting shamen, with similarities to those at Machias Bay, Maine (Hedden 1989:36, figurel8; Willoughby 1935:89, figure 49e).

Hammerstone with X figures from Vineyard Haven, MA (MVM/1995.048)</page><page sequence="7">A Wampanoag Thunderbird on an Eighteenth-century English Manuscript 1 7 Massachusetts, there are two pebbles with incised thunderbird motifs. One is from site 6, which is dated to 4300 B.P. (Fowler 1966: 44, figure 7; Lenik 2002: 125, figure 98; Robbins 1980: 112). The other was found in 1955 by Guy Mellgren at Wapanucket (site not indi- cated) (Lenik 2002:125, Figure 98). On Martha's Vineyard the X figure ap- pears on a gorget fragment from West Tisbury and a hammerstone from Vineyard Haven. The hammerstone has two complete X figures on side A, and on side B a partial figure (Figure 11). In a survey and excavations by Guernsey (1916: 90) in 1912 and 1913, on the east shore of Menemsha Pond, the trench in site 2 pro- duced (Figure 12 A/B) a pottery shard with a headless V-shaped thunderbird or anthropo- morph figure with arms, that Jim Petersen dated to between AD 800- 1 300 (Hedden 1991:- 44). Hedden (Ibid:45) interprets the oval circle and lines to the right of the headless image as part of another figure. A shard from the Sebonac Creek site, Long Island (Figure 13) was excavated by Harrington (1924:270, figure 32e) in 1902. This design is interpreted by Harrington (Ibid: 273) as a thun- derbird, although it is similar to those on the Hopewell pipe from Revere Beach interpreted as an anthropomorph as noted above. A copper thunderbird from the Smyth site, located on the east side of the Merrimack River overlooking Amoskeag Falls, Manchester, New Hampshire, dates to circa A.D. 1700 (Figure 14) (Lenik 2002:106; van Dongen 1995:149, back cover and p.231, catalogue no. 88; Willoughby 1935:234, 242, figure 130). There is also another small copper thunderbird from the same site, excavated in the 1960s (Bunker 1994:23, plate 2; Lenik 2002:106). It is clear from the above discussion that the thunderbird, which is a critical part of Wampanoag religion, has considerable time depth dating to the Late Archaic or earlier. Figure 13.

Matthew Mayhew (1723-1799) was the direct descendant of Thomas Mayhew Sr. (1592-1682) and Thomas Mayhew Jr. (1620/1-1657), who began the English colony on the Island and were responsible for Christianizing the Vineyard Wampanoag. Many of their relations were also missionaries to the island Wampanoag, including Thomas Jr's son Matthew Mayhew ( 1 648- 1710). It is tempting to suggest that the thunderbird on the daybook is much earlier, possibly an early possession of either Thomas Sr. or Jr. and that Matthew Mayhew found it in the ancestral home. There is also another possibility. Matthew married Phoebe Manning of Nantucket and lived on that island as a boat builder for 16 years, producing six children. He and his family only returned to Edgartown on the death of his father in 1760 to take over the homestead and family business, where he continued his profession as a boat builder.. Thus the daybook cover may have come from the Wampanoag of Nantucket. As far as we know this is the earliest and most elaborate ethnographic example of a Thunderbird from New England. This is another case of a sensational artifact lying undiscovered, but preserved for decades in a museum collection. One wonders what other discoveries will be made at the Martha's Vineyard Museum as the collections are further inventoried and cataloged in anticipation of a new museum in West Tisbury. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS After the discovery of the Mayhew thunderbird, Richardson contacted Jim Petersen, asking him to be a part of the research team to analyze the daybook cover. Of course, he leapt at the chance not only to aid in this project, but to get back to Martha's Vineyard where he spent 2 field seasons co-directing with me, the excavations at Hornblower II and the Mayhew house site. Sadly this did not come to pass. The authors wish to thank Jim Bradley, Richard Boisvert, Victoria Bunker, Jeffrey Quilter and Arthur Spiess for their help on this article.
