FIELDS** RESUME L'article est une analyse critique de la notion de "lMgitimitd" de Max Weber et des concepts marxistes apparentes, idWologie, higemonie et fausse conscience, qui servent a expliquer le maintien d'un ordre politique. L'auteur attire l'attention sur la place qu'y tiennent lesfacteurs culturels et surtout les routines de pensee et d'action. Appliquee aux attitudes face a la magie et a la sorcellerie, I'etude montre que la colonisation britannique, tout en etant consciente de sa "6mission civilisatrice"1, fut contrainte de s'appuyer sur les systemes politiques locaux et de se rapprocher des cultures autochtones. Double, double, toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble. - "Macbeth" - Why men do not rebel is a perennial question in Marxist sociology of the state although, as it arises on this intellectual terrain, it typically looms behind other questions. If one asks, for example, how given arrangements realize distinct class interests, one is also asking how it happens that groups not so favored are led to comply with authority. But these two questions are neither asked together routinely nor answered with equal subtlety. Marxist theory is not, after all, a vision of order. Within its optic, the question why men do not rebel indeed looms, but without consistent urgency, much as the snows of Kilimanjaro loom behind the tropical mist below, only visible intermittently. For many intents and purposes, one can carry on as if neither was there. But study of the colonial state permits no intermittent neglect of a large question: the rulers themselves continually pose it in the most practical terms. By restoring the problem of order to permanent visibility, study of the colonial state can set us on the way toward more coherent theory. This way opens, provided we avoid a common obstacle. We must not assume that, because * For careful reading and helpful criticism, I wish to thank Roderick Aya, Egon Bittner, Barbara Fields, Eugene Genovese, Ralph Miliband, Wellington Nyangoni, and George Ross. ** Department of Sociology, Brandeis University. 567</page><page sequence="2">568 Canadian Journal of African Studies preindustrial peoples could not ultimately resist the superior firepower and coordination of the oncoming imperialists, the imperialists' ability to command "grew out of the barrel of a gun." For although force and sometimes hideous violence had their place, colonial strategists did not conceive their task solely in such terms. By the time the pioneers had consolidated Britain's empire in Africa, they could see that large-scale policing cost too much. As Martin Kilson put it, rule in Africa required "colonialism-on-the-cheap.''" Almost im- mediately following conquest, therefore, the architects of order sought to capture and redeploy African institutions possessing their own independent raison d'etre. Force of arms had permitted the mere annexation of territory. The next step was to annex political power. Taking this step, officials conceived a practical respect for African culture as a useful ally, along with the leaders who presided within it. The preservation of indigenous culture thus became the paradoxical condition of achieving the opposite, a "civilizing mission." Outstanding among the officials who took this step was Frederick John Dealtry Lugard, born in India and famous for exploits in Uganda and Nigeria. In his immensely popular treatise The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa, Lugard denounced "slavish imitation" of European culture, thereby aligning himself with Africa's early cultural nationalists.2 The point of this essay is to see why Lugard so aligned himself and what the logic of his view can add to our conception of state power. Our ordinary conception presumes one or both of two circumstances. Rulers rule by means of naked force, or they rule by exercising some species of legitimate authority; but the colonial state did neither. It lacked legitimacy, while its meagre apparatus could not compel obedience by continuous coercion, or even threaten coercion as a routine possibility. How then did it rule? The answer proposed here is that British officials had no choice but to press into service the culture they found, however uncomfortably this expedient fit their notion of "civilizing": in East and Central African colonies, as we will see, such men even came to terms with witchdoctors and their craft. These particular answers belong to a more general conception. When raising the question why men do not rebel, writers in the Marxist tradition often find the concept "legitimacy" indispensable, despite the fact that it flourishes on the alien terrain of "'bourgeois" theory, where the problem of order enjoys pride of place. But, to understand how colonial regimes ruled in Africa, I contend that we can go further without it. By observing how colonial 1. Martin L.

I will propose, in the concluding section, that what we thus begin to see in colonial settings should prod us to look again at the functions Marxists and non-Marxists alike attribute to "legitimacy" else- where. Organizing the British Peace Wherever possible, the British strove to maintain such African authorities in power as were inclined to collaborate. Furthermore, they interested themselves in the details of religion and mythology, kinship organization and marriage rules, witchcraft and magic. Knowledge was power. And knowledge of custom quickly revealed itself inseparable from the power of indigenous rulers. Following this logic to practical conclusions, local officials might find themselves presiding with customary hierarchs over the moral niceties of classificatory kinship and marriage customs.3 The matter of tribute labor followed the same logic. Although the British at first branded it as a form of slavery, which the "civilized" had learned by the 1880s to regard as unmitigated evil, they presently saw its uses.4 "Slavery" was rebaptized "customary labor service, " or even with its African name; in northern Zambia the term mulasa rolled trippingly off the tongues of whites who knew few words in the vernacular. Witchcraft also underwent rebaptism. I have chosen to highlight witchcraft because it imposes a useful intellectual discipline. First, because it refers to a people's abstract conceptualizations of cosmic and human order, witchcraft has no misleading point-for-point refer- ence to the "real. '5 This being so, focussing upon it helps us resist over-simple deductions from its functionality. For while the concepts that witchcraft practices embody may work in a conservative fashion, they may equally be deployed in the opposite way. They are what we may call "moral artifacts." They are present and real, as an arrow or a pistol is; they are useful in hunting or in assassination, aesthetically pleasing in the decor of an occasion, fascinating 3. National Archives of Zambia (hereafter NAZ), Sec/Nat 312, Vol 5, "Minutes, Meeting of Kasempa Chiefs, August 1937," for example, shows a D.O. eliciting information about alleged incest by Watchtower sectaries and asking chiefs to list for him the degrees of kinship within which marriage was permitted. 4. According to Nawa Lifanu, of the former Barotse Province (Zambia), people had scarcely digested the idea that chiefs' demands for tribute labor were unjust when they were ordered to work unpaid at road maintenance and other public works, under chiefs' direction.

The uses of witchcraft are no more built-in and automatic than are those of physical artifacts. As moral artifacts of a culture, the uses of witchcraft remain clearly demarcated from actual power arrangements, even though they may come to work in tandem with a given regime. Second, by studying witchcraft in relation to the establishment of colonial power, I can begin with that most invaluable of informants in any examination of ideology: the principled skeptic, in this case, the principled British skeptic at work in His Majesty's African Empire. However useful it may be to take account of prevailing belief, we cannot fully describe a power relationship in terms of this belief. Since our principled British skeptic cannot be thought of as believing in witchcraft or as sharing its conceptualizations of order, his presence opens a way around vexing issues about how to conceive of ideology in structural rather than intellectual or psychological terms.6 By observing him, we can think about effective ideology without hinging it to subjective belief. The presence of the unbelieving Briton also allows us to take a further step away from simplified notions of utility. Unlike the unpaid labor of villagers, for instance, whose utility is obvious, or the constabulary function of collaborating indigenous authorities, witchcraft would seem to have had no further use, once the pax Britannica reigned. If our principled skeptic comes to see its utility, then that is an event of some interest. The following remarks, by John Nottingham, a District Officer (D.O.) in Kenya, show that Britons embraced witchdoctors for political reasons, but that the embrace could not be consummated without intellectual contortion: "Please help us get rid of witchcraft" must be one of the hardiest annuals on the agenda of the Chiefs' meetings all over Africa, and it is too often politely passed over by administrative officers who feel it is too thorny a subject to dabble in. But at this particular juncture [1959], as clear indications came in that Kikuyu and Kamba Mau Mau were using and adapting Kamba "witchcraft" in their campaign of subversion, the District Commissioner of Machakos felt that the opportunity which a properly controlled inquiry might give to learn something of its techniques and their alleged effects should not be missed ... The point was to understand this unfamiliar world, in order to act within it. With understanding, officials could go to great lengths: It was decided early on that it would be wrong to import a reputedly all-powerful wizard from say the Giriama at Kilifi, to overawe the local demons.

Furthermore, it would foster the impression the Government disapproved only of Kamba witchcraft... It was on this reef that some previous official efforts had foundered, such as the wholesale "kithitu," and "kabisu" cleansing ceremonies conducted under Government auspices shortly before the war, which did little except line the pockets of the witchdoctor concerned ... Inevitably, any such plan to neutralize one of the African weapons of revolt, by learning enough to engage it in a conservative direction, implied the procure- ment of technical assistance. " ... [T] he weapons of bluff and propaganda," Nottingham insisted, "must be replaced as soon as possible by the esoteric knowledge of the persons involved, which any co-operative witchdoctor might have." The D.O. had begun to move as Macbeth did. Fair was foul and foul was fair. Still in all, witchcraft no doubt appears a roundabout way to the initial question of why men do not rebel. And the subject requires intricate discussion if it is to mean anything real to people no longer inhabiting the intellectual world of Macbeth - or of Mbowoka, ruler among the Lala people of central Zambia. Admittedly, there is a loss in approaching our main problem by this route. But there is also a gain. The gain is the possibility of observing the functions of an ideology that is at once alien to the state and part of it. In this way, I can advance toward a solution of the complex problem with which I began. There are two ways to approach complex phenomena. One is to devise simplifying concepts. The other is to view the phenomenon in question in simpler form. Emile Durkheim proposed the second strategy in his seminal work The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. There he set out to study religion in general by taking the "simple" aboriginal religion of central Australia as his point of departure. Uncluttered in comparison to larger-scale religions elsewhere, he thought, this one allowed "an essential and permanent aspect of humanity" to reveal itself.8 I propose a similar approach to state power, on the reasoning that "simple" political systems carry near the surface relationships between culture and the state that lie out of sight in more complex ones. Colonial systems are simple. They are simple, above all, in that order cannot be taken for granted, but presents itself to the participants, quite explicitly, as the problem of keeping order. As seen by rulers and ruled alike, order lacks the 7. John C. Nottingham, "Sorcery among the Akamba in Kenya," Journal of African Ad- ministration 11, no. 1 (1959): 3-4. 8.

Instead, a distinct group of rulers consciously impose their own law and order against the interests and heard objection of a subject population, lately sovereign. In the world of colonial Africa, pax Britannica was exactly what it is grammatically: pax with a qualifier. It signified an end to armed hostilities but not peace tout court. When, for example, J.E. Stephenson explained the principles of colonial taxation to a princess of the Lala people, she exclaimed, "Why, this is just like war!"'9 Upon hearing a similar speech, the Lundas to the northwest are said to have rioted.'0 Since, like the Lalas and the Lundas, many Africans failed to welcome the encumbrances of the colonial state, ruling meant not only imposing new constraints but also organizing systematically against resistance to them. To paraphrase von Clausewitz, the pax Britannica was the continuation of war by other means. In more complex systems, by contrast, the problem of state power can present itself as the problem of "legitimate authority," a condition in which, according to Max Weber, two subjective attitudes work together: a conscious- ness on the part of the rulers that it is their right and duty to command (and that the privilege of doing so is merited); and a consciousness on the part of the ruled that it is right and one's duty to obey."' It takes time for domination through conquest to acquire this two-fold psychological support, if it ever does so at all. Whether this support exists in a given situation is an important factual question; whether its existence accounts for the political orderliness observed is another. Both empirical questions contain theoretical intricacies that go beyond the scope of this paper. Suffice it to say that where this social psychological support exists, it multiplies the difficulties of analyzing state power. Since in their African colonies the British stabilized only the first outlook - a consciousness of right to command - some of these difficulties fall away. The Marxist concepts of "false consciousness," "ideology," "hegemony,"''2 and their derivatives aim at a kindred problem: the absence for significant periods of rebellious violence by the oppressed and the relative scarcity of physical coercion by their social "betters," when one would expect both to grow out of opposed interests. In short, they address the question why men do not rebel with the strategy of the simplifying concept. Like Weber's concept of "legitimate 9. J.E.

It is therefore not so remark- able as might seem at first glance that Marxists freely borrow Weber's concept. '3 But although designed to clarify immensely complex phenomena, none of these concepts fosters clarity alone. All share two disadvantages." They work at the level of consciousness, of all entities in the social world the most notoriously difficult to observe phenomenally or grasp mentally. Still more troublesome, they proceed by assuming precisely what is problematic: the existence and potency of moral community between rulers and ruled. The difficulties and obscurities of what we seek to understand thus tend to migrate undecomposed into the simplifying concepts. How could historical antagonists come to share ideas and ideals heartening to one side but not the other?'" Given the human tolerance for contradiction between ideals and action, and for forgetfulness between successive actions, how could something carried in the mind undergird social peace? I am not always sure what we add by speaking of "ideology" that we did not notice at the outset. As answers, Weberian "legitimation" and its Marxist kin fall into tautology; as questions, they are exceedingly complex. Hence, my proposal of an alternate strategy: the sim- plified case. British colonial regimes allow us to remove "experimentally" the obscuring element of legitimate authority and all that resembles it. For in relations between rulers and ruled, these systems are cluttered by no shared culture or shared contingent of intellectuals, no common view of man's fate, no similar historical experience or traditions, and no one God presiding over a sanctified injustice. The kind of cultural matiriel that is useful elsewhere in a state's war by other means was not available to Britain in its colonies. To say, however, that the colonial state could not gain what other kinds of state may by appeal to its own legitimacy is not to say that British regimes in Africa lacked legitimizing ideology. Lord Lugard claimed that Britons had a moral duty both to profit and to "civilize": a nation that did not do both lacked the moral right to profit. 6 But the mere propagation of such ideas does not account for Britons' ability to obtain obedience without constant use or threat of force. What establishes legitimacy as an aid to domination is not that the predators satisfy themselves that their ascendency is right - this is not notably 13. Therborn, Ruling Class, p. 171, declares this borrowing inappropriate. 14. However, I believe the disadvantages of "hegemony" are avoided in Genovese's Roll Jordan, Roll, pp. 25-49, whose great contribution is to have derived a "hegemonic function of the law" from the routine practicalities of the common life slaves and their owners shared. 15.

They must also cause some paralyzing echo of their own satisfaction to ring in the awareness of the prey. This would seem to depend upon the prior establishment of community between rulers and ruled, but the renowned idea of Europe's "civilizing mission" expressed no such thing. As ideology, the "civilizing mission" was the very antithesis of moral community between rulers and ruled. As practice, it did not build on institutions by which rulers and ruled ordered a common life. There were none. And its declared purpose was the dissolution of ordered society, as Africans understood it. Christian missionaries shared this destructive purpose. One might think that, because they pursued this aim by putting into the minds of Africans their own God, they brought into existence a moral community on which to build the political regime. But even passionately conservative missionary efforts did not have uniformly conservative results. Although the missions unquestionably produced African advocates of the Empire, they also produced opponents of it. Revolutionary millenarism stalked many missions.'7 And mission-educated Africans figured prominently in the very earliest anti-colonial agitation. For example, in the 1920s the Kirk Session of the Scottish Free Church mission in Zambia was virtually the fledgling nationalist movement at prayer.'8 Kwame Nkrumah's rhetorical style vividly illustrates this aspect of missionary enterprise. Before cheering crowds, he paraphrased Jesus Christ: "Seek ye first the political kingdom, and all else shall be added unto you." In one such meeting, a woman party worker leapt to the rostrum and broke into the hymn "Lead Kindly Light," which became thenceforth a theme song of the Conven- tion People's Party."9 Christianity testified more than one way. But merely asking whether Christian testimony brought men to rebellion or bade them sit silently misses the point. The real question is not whether the missions converted the Africans they touched to the ideals of the rulers, but whether such conversions can account for the regime's ability to command. A more general question, easily overlooked, is whether the ideological decor of a political status quo actually does the work of preserving it.20 In this case we must answer no to both questions. The problem of keeping order required an immediate solution, and colonial strategists quickly saw that missions could not 17.

The missions could not because their efforts set the converted outside of moral community with the masses of villagers. By so doing, they courted the inherent danger of all "civilizing": a success that must necessarily undermine the initial distinctions. Through his experience establishing regimes in Uganda and Nigeria (and perhaps before that as the son of missionaries in India), Lord Lugard acquired a sure grasp of this reality. To him the existence of an acculturated elite spelled danger, not security.21 Anyone sharing Lugard's vantage point could not take comfort from the appearance of Africans sharing his language or his God. Some eight years after the Dual Mandate appeared, a D.O. in Zambia translated its logic exactly in a memorandum about a troublesome African. The "trouble" consisted in the man's behavior upon returning to his village after long residence in town. Full of European ideas about dress, language, marriage, and so forth, he asked to be "detribalised" and permitted to live outside the customary order. This em- bodiment of the regime's legitimizing ideology unnerved the D.O., who busied himself with a systematic inquiry into the man's background and activities. At last he concluded that the man was "evidently not bolshevistic. He is simply and purely pro-white.'"22 Under the circumstances, no gain for "civilization" could have been more subversive. But this changed man would have impressed the D.O.'s missionary compatriot otherwise. The missionary deliberately cultivated the principled non-conformity of the sincere convert out of "heathenism." Like Lugard, however, many officers of the regime had only qualified enthusiasm for the "civilizing mission" as carried out by their brethren of the cloth. The D.O. for whom evidence of cultural conversion bore the subversive aroma of "bolshevism" saw that the men and women who had been captivated by Britons' God were not the rock on which to build a regime. The virtuous "heathen" seemed a better bet. Men who saw matters this way could and did learn to appreciate the virtue of some witchcraft medicines. When, in the early 1930s, there arose a wholesale demand in Zambia and neighboring territories for the mucapi witch-cleansing medicine, an official had it analyzed, tasted it and, declaring that it was "harmless ... and... might do some good,," acquiesced in a plan to permit its wide distribution.23 Thus, the road to acculturation conveyed people in more than one direction. It would lead white administrators up to the doorsteps of weird collaborators and closer to moral community with the ruled than anyone unfamiliar with colonial practicality could readily have imagined. All was fair in war by other means. 21. Lugard, Dual Mandate, pp. 78, 589ff. 22. NAZ, ZA 7/1/13/1, "Annual Report on Native Affairs, Awemba Province," 1929-1930. 23. NAZ, ZA 1/15/M/2, D.C. to P.C.

In practice at first, and always in principle, there was no compromise with witchcraft. To cope with it legally, the regimes in East and Central African colonies adopted major witchcraft laws, whose spirit echoed Lugard's exultant claim, "We have put an end to the slave trade and intertribal warfare, to human sacrifice and the ordeals of the witchdoctor.''24 The line officers of the regime came to revise this primitive formulation only when they tried to implement it. The very effort to apply the Witchcraft Ordinance made officials see differently the thing the Ordinance was designed to abolish. To watch this peculiarly emblematic law bob above and below the surface of events is to witness a particular kind of state in formation. Enacted for similar reasons throughout Africa, the Witchcraft Ordinance aimed to stop both the accusation of witches and their trial. To do this, they removed the offense of witchcraft, as Africans saw it, from the purview of the law. Whereas murder and theft were crimes before and after the advent of the pax Britannica, witchcraft was demoted from the status of a crime to that of a superstitious belief, which might only motivate recognized crimes. The Ordinance also aimed to undermine the whole complex of witch belief and its allied healing professions. The Zambian Ordinance (1914) stated: "Whoever holds himself out as a witchdoctor or witchfinder or pretends to exercise or use any kind of supernatural power, witchcraft, sorcery, or enchantment shall be guilty of an offense." It prohibited even the comment that an illness had come about by "non-natural" means. A person who said, for example, that adultery had caused someone's sickness could be sentenced to three years' imprison- ment, a ?50 fine, and twenty lashes.25 The logs of administrators contain periodic reports of arresting persons found to have inflicted the boiling water ordeal upon themselves publicly, in order to quiet malicious or suspicious gossip. Administrators in Uganda treated an ordinary person found in posses- sion of charms to have intended them, ipsofacto, for a use punishable under the Ordinance; the onus was on the possessor to prove the contrary.26 Both by its thoroughness and by the rigor of the penalties, the regime made clear that in the matter of witchcraft it meant business. The regime meant business not solely because witchcraft practices were repugnant to it, but also because they reopened the issue of sovereignty. Since 24. Lugard, Dual Mandate, p. 617. 25.

Thus, the same policy which stripped African rulers of their sovereignty transformed African judges and executioners responsible for these proceedings into murderers and murderers' accomplices. J.E. Stephenson, the pioneer ad- ministrator mentioned previously, recalls in his autobiography the patrols he led early in his career to arrest Headman Lwimbaula and later Chief Mbowoka for trying and punishing witches. He comments in passing on the unattractive choice confronting Mbowoka in particular, whose royal relative had been bewitched. Either he failed to do his duty as an African ruler, or he failed to do his duty as a British subject.27 From Stephenson's standpoint, the latter was "justice." But it was not only the Lwimbaulas and the Mbowokas who saw things otherwise. From the standpoint of ordinary villagers, too, the Ordinance perverted justice. No longer protected by the customary authorities, they might still hope to resort to private means; but the Ordinance foreclosed even that. A house- holder attempting to forearm himself by obtaining a charm, much as an American householder might obtain a pistol, was a criminal. So was his supplier. And so too were witnesses to an attempt on his life by means of witchcraft or motivated by it. The D.O. Frank H. Melland revealed that many "actual murders" went unreported. Villagers feared entrapment by the sense- less legalities of the Ordinance, for their way of talking about aggression and general wrongdoing might unpredictably turn them into accused. They there- fore lied when he came to collect the census: "died of pneumonia, killed by a lion, and so on."'28 From their standpoint, the law appeared to protect and encourage witches; hence yet another assault by whites on the welfare of Africans. This is why the D.O. quoted above called the request for help in controlling witchcraft a "hardy annual" on the agenda of chiefs' meetings, where chiefs conveyed to administrators a popular demand for service. The villagers' insistence on this went far toward altering the application of the law and toward gathering white officials closer to the African viewpoint. Curiously enough, however, the law itself occasioned movement in this direction. For despite formulas like "pretends" and "holds himself out," the Ordinance could not avoid acknowledging witchcraft as a reality. At one level this reality consisted only in a sophisticated recognition that African subjects behaved "as if" it were possible, with real consequences of moment to the regime. But the practical demands of enforcement did not leave the issue here. It is problematic to prosecute a crime for whose commission there is no 27. Stephenson, Chirupula's Tale, pp. 141, 156. 28.

By their nature, method and fact occupied a dusky terrain. To pin down fleeting elements such as motive, intent, and circumstances, divorced from method and fact, courts had to examine extra- ordinary evidence: horns, bones, unusual-looking rocks, bundles of leaves; the testimony which known practitioners of the forbidden knowledge could supply (presumably in violation of the Ordinance, strictly construed); and finally, that most ambiguous kind of evidence in witchcraft trials the world over, the confession.30 To examine physical evidence cogently, one had to have a grasp of the fleeting elements. For how could one even recognize a tool of the crime for what it was without understanding its purpose? To prove crime under the Witchcraft Ordinance, then, British officials had no choice but to reason like the African judges they superseded and the villagers these judges served. The intellectual somersaults thus occasioned must have been a recurring torment to Britons in their shorts and pith helments, sitting in outdoor courts before tables filled with spectral exhibits, hearing translations of what was being said, and studying faces in order to fathom who could be telling the truth. It matters little that the British drew opposite conclusions from those of their African subjects, insisting that the real victims in customary witchcraft proceedings were persons accused of an impossible crime. Even if inverted, the structure of reasoning was the same. In short, colonial rule taught the men close to its daily exercise the logic of witchcraft. Not surprisingly, therefore, men familiar with the milieu soon noticed flaws in the Ordinance, and assertions of the superstitious were amplified by the sophisticated. The anthropologist E.E. Evans-Pritchard offered the intel- ligentsia a scientific demonstration that witch beliefs form part of a coherent logical system.3' Among other things, Evans-Pritchard recodified for Britons the distinction between "black" and "white" magic, "white" magic being intended for protection only - the householder's pistol - "black" magic 29.

The legal specialist Geoffrey St. J. Orde Brown declared that the Ordinance non- sensically lumped together witch and witchdoctor, since any reasonable person differentiates between killer and healer.33 John Nottingham, quoted above, echoed this wisdom when he spoke about witchcraft "of whatever colour." An archdeacon of the Anglican Church, a Mr. Glossop, blasted the Ordinance as something "from a pigeonhole in Whitehall," written without regard to what he had come to know in "forty years on Lake Nyasa." Underlining his point, he continued, "Witchcraft is the biggest thing in the minds and lives of most Africans. That a gathering of Natives assembling to say what is in their hearts should be told that there is no such thing seems to me like telling a Londoner that there is no such thing as Communism."3" Instead of marvelling at Africans' servitude to an incomprehensible fear, the archdeacon found its equivalent in his own heart. Thus did one Briton's idea about witchcraft evolve beyond the cruder formulas of the "civilizing mission." When disparate human beings move toward consensus about the nature of evil, they are on their way toward new moral community. Some advanced beyond Glossop. The farthest-reaching criticism of the Ordinance came from the D.O. Frank H. Melland, who bluntly declared it to be "divorced from reason"; moreover, it was "unethical and politically foolish" to maintain the Ordinance's position about witchcraft. African rulers could not ignore the popular demand for control of witches and hope to succeed as leaders. To protect the dignity of all trials, these men must be permitted to try witches openly, rather than in the sub rosa proceedings which Melland was sure took place. Indeed, the regime might be well-advised to make common cause with some of the witchdoctors, because in many cases, he claimed, they were one and the same as the rulers the regime recognized. By this reasoning he concluded: Everyone who has intimate knowledge of such matters knows that the word of the witchdoctor has infinitely more weight with the majority of Africans than that of an official or a missionary. Is it not common sense that we should make an alliance with him, get the use of his power and of his services?35 32. Evans-Pritchard also emphasized the distinction between "witchcraft" and "sorcery," but anthropologists have debated whether this distinction is cogent. Since the present work does not require a position on this question, I have used throughout the commoner term "witchcraft" for both. 33. Orde Brown, "Witchcraft", pp. 484 ff. 34.

Such co-optation was indispensable to indirect rule, which made African leaders and colonial officials jointly responsible for order. In terms of relative numbers, the stereotype of many a feature film about the British Empire is not false in portraying a lone officer, assisted by two or three trusties, enforcing the Crown's Writ. For example, in 1950 Kenya had a grand total of 149 provincial and district officers.36 The imperial historian D.A. Low tells of witnessing this state of affairs during a visit in 1956 with Richard Cashmore, then D.O. at Chuka, Kenya. He sat one evening in the D.O.'s bungalow and listened to plans for a patrol to the forests of Mt. Kenya against Mau Mau insurgents, an operation to be carried out by Cashmore himself and two armed policemen. What is false about the imperial romances is that they fail to portray fully the problem of ruling in these conditions. In the course of the evening, Cashmore pulled his copy of War and Peace off the shelf and gave Low the following passage to read: In quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the chief reward of his labour and efforts. While the sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark, holding on with a boat-hook to the ship of the people, and himself moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding on to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer possible. The ship moves independently with its own enormous motion, the boat-hook no longer reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant, useless, feeble man.37 However, from this vivid portrait of a predicament, Low does not draw the obvious conclusion that, even during "untroubled times," white men actually ruled Kenya only in a very limited sense. Therefore, nothing in his otherwise sparkling essay on imperial authority so much as intimates the extraordinary forms of cooperation men in Cashmore's position had no choice but to enter into. 36.

But they could not possibly cover the many villages and settlements of a huge rural district, where villagers might see a white person no more than once yearly, if that. Day-to-day ruling had to be the business of black leaders - chiefs, village headmen, lineage officials, and local notables. Through them, and only through them, the regime acquired the ability to exact obedience from a far-flung population. This fact of life dictated a reversal in the regime's original attitude toward indigenous rulers. Imperial propaganda first called them tyrannical, blood-thirsty "heathens" and slave- traders, men unworthy to govern. But indirect rule set these same men (and occasionally, women) to work at even those esoteric tasks the white administra- tion defined as "ruling." Thus, chiefs acquired the right to retain for local use part of the taxes they collected on the Empire's behalf. And they were urged to continue trying cases of the categories not taken over by the regime. Along this judicial route the more startling aspects of cooperation could come into view. In the Northern Province of Zambia, the vast majority of such cases con- cerned marriage with all its wide ramifications, material and spiritual, private and public, violent and peaceful."38 It must have troubled administrators to see how often matters touching on witchcraft arose in marriage cases, as well as in cases involving crime. Frank H. Melland, working in Zambia's Central Province, complained that three chiefs serving as court assessors approached with disinterest a murder case he was trying, because the court would not go to the heart of the matter: witchcraft. "I believe," he commented, "that our attitude to the whole of witchcraft is acting as a drag on much good and fruitful work which we are attempting in diverse directions."39 Because witchcraft arose in countless ways in the course of everyday life, the demand for its control was permanent. Or, to put the point differently, witchcraft provided a per- manent vocabulary for the ups and downs of routine collective life. This being the case, the prohibitions of the Witchcraft Ordinance could not but hobble men of influence.40 Melland joined the issue head-on, in the plain terms of seeking to get the use of the witchdoctors' "power." By this logic, he came to share the witch- doctors' intellectual terrain: he could not mean what he did by their "power" without meaning at the same time what they did by it. Small wonder then that he 38. NAZ, "Tour Reports" and "Annual Reports of Provincial Commissioners." 39. Melland, "Ethical and Political Aspects of African Witchcraft," 497. 40.

What "ruling" meant broadened. Routine as a Political Resource The issue was not only one of hierarchies but also one of the culture that supported them. On a simple view, the exercise of legitimate authority could yet explain colonial order, if one thought of customary rulers' own legitimacy rather than that of British officials. In this case, the British would simply have turned the legitimacy of others to new purposes."42 But this reasoning is insufficient on two counts. First, it leaves aside the principle that all legitimate systems of authority contain a set of presumptions about who may rule and about the limits to what both rulers and ruled may do.43 A chief's assignments under indirect rule could take him beyond these limits. Even a legitimate ruler cannot expect compliance with any command he pleases to make. Consider for instance the ruler who may no longer wage war on his own behalf against traditional enemies, but who must recruit fighting men to kill on behalf of the Empire. The second difficulty turns likewise on the meaning of legitimate authority in a real setting. In order to redeploy the legitimacy of African rulers, the regime found that it had to concern itself no less with Africans' relationships to one another than with their common relationship to itself. As Lugard said repeated- ly, African rulers must be allowed to enforce "native law and custom," so long as it did not conflict with "natural justice." What he did not say is that the enforcement of British law and order had no other foot to stand on. But his "dual mandate" meant nothing less. It joined together what the "civilizing mission" had put asunder - witch-cleansing and tax payment, avoidance of clan incest and road maintenance, ritual obeisance and the provision of laborers, veneration of ancestors and loyalty to the Crown. Black rulers' ability to command "sat," so to speak, on a "cushion" of culture, that is, upon routine ways of behaving and thinking that give to social life the relative predictability that members of any society count upon for the conduct of their day-to-day lives. When the technicians of indirect rule saw that reckless pursuit of the "civilizing mission" would puncture this cushion, and 41. Frank H.

They were not alert only to the possibility of rebellion. Even if there were no open fight against the Crown, the masses of people might escape the net which kept them in order, and thus within reach of the regime's commands. As Sir Percy Girouard, a governor of Nigeria, put it: If we allow tribal authority to be ignored or broken, it will mean that we, who numerically form a small minority in the country, shall be obliged to deal with a rabble, with thousands of persons in a savage or semi-savage state, all acting on their own impulses, and making themselves a danger to society generally.44 Sir Percy's was not the triumphal Hobbesian vision that the state rightly tames an uncivil society: it was the quite un-Hobbesian nightmare that the colonial state might be forced to try. Like regimes the world over, this one fed upon a generalized orderliness, independent of that provided by the state, to assure that hierarchies useful to it remained stable. This meant that the colonial state had an objective interest in maintaining patterns of obedience and customs of deference that had nothing to do with the state per se. In other words, the regime's best interest decreed that Africans must remain "civilized" as they, rather than their colonizers, under- stood it. Such incidents as the one in which a Bemba refused to perform labor to which custom bound him, on the grounds, "I am a Christian. I don't do things for nothing,'"45 could reverberate in a thousand unforeseeable directions. The interest which this sort of regime had in culturally-prescribed routine does not distinguish it from others. What designates it as special is only the clarity with which its agents could make this objective interest their conscious purpose. Structures of command can maintain a relative stability if people's ability to perceive or act has been channelled by supporting structures of routine activity and expectation. Barrington Moore suggested the importance of routine in forestalling rebellion, when he argued that the Hindu caste system planted the seeds of political stability by minutely determining even the most banal aspects of each individual's everyday existence.46 It seems to me that caste is only an extreme instance of the routine which pervades human life wherever we observe it. Routine makes possible the rational conduct of life by rendering it predictable - or enabling actors to behave as if it were predictable and thereby helping to make it so. To this extent, Max Weber erred in locating "habitual action" outside the categories of "rational action. "47 44. Quoted in Lugard, Dual Mandate, p. 216. 45.

If my suspicion is correct, then the often-repeated tautology which holds revolution to occur "as a consequence of profound social change" may conceal a fundamental insight: change undermines the ability of familiar routines to order everyday life and, in so doing, deprives the state of a valuable resource. The same may be said of war. The notion that defeated rulers lose legitimacy, thereby opening the way for rebellion, is a commonplace of historical writing. But if my suspicion is correct, it is not so much rulers' loss of legitimacy as war's blasting apart of routine that can weaken regimes, sometimes fatally. For this reason, not only the societies of the vanquished but also those of the victors commonly experience upheaval in the aftermath of war.48 Human beings do not tolerate for long the absence of routine. They will do everything possible to reinsert themselves quickly into known ways of living. It is the despair of zealous revolutionaries that people roused to the militant pursuit of radical goals tend to stop fighting at the first opportunity, even if the price is a return to some of the former opperessions.49 And from the opposite valuation of order, the disappearance of routine is the conservative's nightmare looming behing Durkheim's concept of anomie and behind Sir Percy's vision of what it took for colonial regimes to rule. Let us now consider witchcraft as a feature of routine. The possibility of using a witchdoctor's power at all rested upon the currency of the witchcraft idiom in everyday life. Power augmented by magic depended upon the ability of witch beliefs to define deviants as witches or as bewitched, upon their manner of prescribing collective action in the face of misfortune, upon their ability to direct men and women to act in such a way as to avoid the accusation of witchcraft, and upon their logic for understanding events. In short, witches' and witchdoctors' power inhabited the quotidian and the humdrum. Led by their interest in command, British officials came repeatedly to the edge of this political terra incognita; seeking to annex political power, they repeatedly crossed over into it. In the mid-1930s, when medicine men 48. Although no participant in World War I enjoyed a more uncomplicated victorhood than did the United States, it did not escape political upheaval. See Charles W. Ferguson's essay "Ku Kluxism," in his book The Modern Babel (New York: W. Heineman, Ltd., 1929), which is still worth reading. 49. Compare Genovese, Roll, Jordan, Roll, p. 115. Although in his recent study Injustice, Barrington Moore at times comes close to treating attachment to routine as a lamentable failing of some individuals (p. 68), at others he points to its fundamental character. In his inspired treatment of asceticism (pp. 50ff), routine emerges as an integral part of the human attachment to life.</page><page sequence="19">Political Contingencies of Witchcraft 585 (called Bamucapi) launched a huge campaign of witch-cleansing, administra- tors in Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia hesitated for a moment and then crossed over.50 At first the obvious course was to arrest and prosecute the medicine men. In organizing the surrender of magical objects, inducing witches to confess, distributing their medicine (mucapi) to all, while promising instant death to repeat offenders and permanent immunity to the innocent, the Bamucapi committed manifold violations of the Witchcraft Ordinance. Moreover, officials trembled for legality in general, if these men were allowed to breach the Ordinance with impunity. And they began to fear that those who had been delivered from evil might be emboldened to ignore the tax law. The Rev. Dr. James Chisholm reported rumors in the Isoka District of Zambia that the medicine rendered people invulnerable to bullets, and that it enabled a man to escape from any prison. Worst of all, perhaps, the old Watchtower myth that a supernatural American army would liberate the people circulated again. These rumors prompted Chisholm to write to an administrator, "I suppose there is no law against any native selling 'medicine' ... but there is something more to this movement. There is talk of the English leaving this country soon and Americans coming to take their place, when there will be no more taxes or trouble of any kind." On several grounds, then, repression seemed called for. But the Bamucapi were not repressed. When officials of the three territories discussed the menace in mid-1934, they adopted a policy of "watchful tolerance." Determining this for reasons of state, they crossed over onto the unfamiliar territory of witches and witchdoctors, and of the crises of daily living in the villages. Heard from this other side, reason of state droned along in the humdrum. Villagers describ- ed ceremonies of hymn-singing, prayers, and confessions. The sermons de- nounced witchcraft and adultery, along with the interpersonal wrongs of jealousy, arguing, backbiting, and egotism. One villager quoted a Mucapi as having preached, "You must live in peace and not kill another [by witchcraft], but accept death from God (alone)." There would be no more deaths from other than natural causes or divine action. Here it is necessary to open a set of parentheses. Although the villager's claims impress us as extraordinary, it is important to see that they refer to the daily round of life. To do so, we must be able to understand such claims as referring to something real: not as reflecting mere beliefs about the world but as representing "obvious" features of the world taken for granted as natural givens; not as "bastard science" (pace Frazier and 50. All information on the Mucapi Movement is drawn from NAZ, ZA 1/15/M/2. See also Audrey I. Richards, "A Modem Movement of Witchfinders," Africa 8, no. 1 (1935).</page><page sequence="20">586 Revue canadienne des etudes africaines Malinowski) but as a construction of the real no more or less intellectual than its analogues in our own society - "race," the "value" of gold, the "self" and its cognates. Were this not so, witchcraft practices could never have done their work in the African milieu; and, if they had not, British administrators would never have been driven to their new understandings. What Durkheim said of religion can be said of them: "A human institution cannot rest upon an error and a lie, without which it could not exist. If it were not founded in the nature of things, it would have encountered in the facts a resistance over which it could never have triumphed.5""1 Witchcraft practices are what I call "moral artifacts," products of moral community. They are neither errors nor lies, because they are not mere matters of belief. While converting ourselves from viewing witch beliefs as mere beliefs, to a perception of them as seemingly "natural" givens, we must see these givens as so enmeshed in routine social life that their reality is created and recreated by people acting in light of them: witchcraft inhabits the world the way it "is." As Evans-Pritchard wrote in his pioneering study on Zande witchcraft: All their beliefs hang together .... In this web of belief every strand depends upon every other strand, and a Zande cannot get out of its meshes because it is the only world he knows. The web is not an external structure in which he is enclosed. It is the texture of his thought and he cannot think that his thought is wrong.52 The villager's reaction to the witch-cleansing services brings out that witchcraft belonged not only to a texture of thought but also to a texture of life. To think about witchcraft was to think about adultery, jealousy, selfishness, discord, sickness, and death. Witchcraft was, as Archdeacon Glossop said, a "thing in their minds and lives." We can begin to understand witchcraft as a texture of life and thought, and as a "natural" feature of the ordinary, by comparing it to conscience. An early Free Church missionary in Malawi pledged to replace "magical and com- munistic restraints" with his own preference, the bonds of "Christian law and conscience."" Although invisible, like "magical restraints," "conscience" is real to us, as it was to the missionary, while "magical restraints" are not. Yet each belongs to an idiom of thought about the motives and consequences of human action. Neither exists merely as an idea (or error), because each in its own context is made real in the routine of everyday life. We may the more 51. Durkheim, Elementary Forms, p. 14. 52.

The missionaries certainly resisted this idea. They perennially complained that African converts were subject to lapses of conscience. The trouble was not so much wrongdoing - which conscience might have prevented - as the fact that converts did not always understand conduct in the missionaries' indivi- dualistic terms. For these converts, spirits or witches arriving spontaneously or generated by magic manipulation, could as well account for what a person did as something within his inner self.54 An action could originate outside him. This is to do more than propose causation by forces beyond a person's reach. The comparison must be made with "Macbeth" or "Oedipus Rex," which take for granted a world where it is normal for non-human but intelligent forces to direct men's actions at will. Our social life makes the self-actuating individual appear rooted in nature, but this conception is as alien to the societies which produced classical tragedy as it is to the African villages which missionaries sought to transform. We need not assume that we, or the missionaries, are necessarily more sophisticated than the villagers about the invisible forces animating human behavior. We are oriented to our own invisible forces, which have evolved with us in our own society. "Conscience" and related ideas such as "ego" and "psyche" present themselves to us routinely as "natural" givens. Since they are moral artifacts of our collective life, we cannot doubt their reality. But if we feel they have a physical basis, this is not because any of them has yet been discovered beyond all doubt in brain chemistry. We began to look in the brain for what we had long since discovered in social life. It is the vision of their disappearance, and with them our individuality, that lends novels such as Eugene Zamiatin's We and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World their capacity to terrify. I now close the parentheses. The witchcraft that the Bamucapi set out to eradicate manifested itself at once morally and in ways villagers took to be physical manifestations rooted in nature itself. In the old days of witchcraft executions, it was not uncommon for an autopsy to follow the death of a convict and for the traditional pathologist to remove a telltale object from the corpse. According to expectation, this kind of 54. For a glimpse at what some psychoanalysts have made of this, see Marie-Cecile and Edmon Ortigues, Oedipe Africain (Paris: Union generale d'editions, 1973). It is inevitable that the Oedipus story, a classic portrayal of action originating outside the actor, should have become in the hands of Freud and his followers a paradigm of inner development. With what Max Weber called the "disenchantment of the world," the invisible forces animating human behaviour settled down inside the acting subject.</page><page sequence="22">588 Canadian Journal of African Studies criminal had a different physical make-up than a law-abiding person."5 It seems that most societies are grounded in the proposition that nature confirms their moral order; human intellect has an inherent tendency to reify the moral artifacts of collective life. When the Great Depression struck, masses of unemployed returned to their villages. With economic hardship, witchcraft increased and manifested itself physically. People who saw their neighbors give up charms and promise to renounce witchcraft (or who did so themselves and thereby silenced gossip) could feel reassured. Once the campaign had achieved momentum, it was difficult, even dangerous, for an individual doubter to stand back from at least the semblance of belief in the medicine men's ability to heal. To do so could threaten his standing in the community, his regular modes of intercourse and cooperation, and possibly his life. Chiefs who failed to support the campaign could easily appear to favor witchcraft. On Likoma Island (Malawi), initially unenthusiastic chiefs maneuvered to seem to take the lead in a revival that was immensely popular among their people.56 As the Bamucapi did their work, huge piles of the mystical weapons they confiscated appeared on the outskirts of the cleansed villages. One official reported that the inhabitants of the as yet uncleansed villages "eagerly awaited" the medicine men's arrival. Officials viewed the physical manifestations in quite another spirit. They found that they lacked the means systematically to capture and prosecute the Bamucapi. Managing only a few arrests exposed the regime's weakness to all without achieving worthwhile results. The fact that the villages were full of unemployed young men under pressure to pay taxes further raised the stakes of interfering with a popular movement. Worst of all, it became clear that, so long as recognized rulers could not themselves eradicate witchcraft, the cleansing worked against the regime's own establishment. But the officials who had seen that witchcraft might circuit from the deep texture of social life to power subversive politics now saw that they could try to short-circuit it and then induce a new, conservative current. Accordingly, the new policy of "watchful tolerance" set down that the Bamucapi must be invited by the recognized chiefs of the localities they cleansed, and that chiefs must accept responsibility for any crimes resulting from the procedure. In short, officials rendered indirect rule its due. Thereafter, they nodded at the Witchcraft Ordinance, by instructing African district messengers to "keep a sharp eye on developments" and to miss no opportunity to ridicule and discredit the medicine men - without, however, much hope of 55.

As one D.O. said, "The native has little sense of humour where witchcraft is concerned." But then neither had the colonizer, who had seen the abyss opening. The majority who decided the policy of "watchful tolerance" ignored the opinion of the official who objected, "If the Bamucapi are allowed to carry on unmolested, we almost admit that witchcraft exists." So they did. They approached this admission not in a movement of intellect but as a consequence of their implication in a definite structure of social intercourse. We need not think of them as differing in this respect from their subjects. Surely there were skeptics in the villages - first and foremost, those falsely accused of witchcraft must have been, who well knew what they had or had not done. And there must also have been, here and there, a disinterested skeptic, spiritually akin to intellectuals everywhere, like the Kwakiutl villager described in Levi-Strauss' remarkable essay "Le Sorcier et sa magie."57 But even if he had managed to do what Evans-Pritchard thought impossible, to "think that his thought was wrong," it would not have been enough. He would still have had to escape a texture of life which sustained the idiom of witchcraft. Otherwise, he would have had no alternative to acting "as if" he believed it all. We can think of Marx analogously, as a "villager" who managed to free his mind of the obscurity surrounding the moral artifacts of capitalist society (as he aptly says, its "fetishes"). He then preached with inspiration to the still credulous "villagers" around him; but not for all that could he disengage his life as he had his thought. As Marx saw, emancipation of body and mind would demand nothing less than rupturing the texture of life into which the moral artifacts of capitalist society were interwoven. Managing to think that a mode of thought was wrong did not suffice to hold colonial administrators immune from the practical logic of witchcraft. They found themselves in the predicament of behaving "as if' they believed it all. Thus, as they enmeshed themselves in a texture of life where witchcraft was real and ever-present, officials revised their thinking and, thereafter, they compromised. The compromises I have been talking about reveal how remark- able British colonial regimes were. In them, "heathen" kinglets became respectable upholders of the King of England's power; men like Nottingham and Melland learned to tell the difference between a "better-class witchdoctor" and a quack and to respect the power of the former. The experience of Lugard and his successors may be read as an extended reply to Lenin's rhetorical question, "A standing army and police are the chief instruments of state power. But how can it be otherwise?""58 57. Claude Levi-Strauss, Anthropologie structurale (Paris: Plon, 1969). 58.

Processes one would find in any other political system existed in this one - exhortation, dignified and responsible leading, graft, log-rolling, factional maneuvering, intimidation, and direct coercion. Since, in addition, indirect rule gave the recognized authorities substantial latitude to apply economic regulations selectively, economic levers were also available for political use. Indeed, a complete answer to how the colonial regime ruled would have to take systematic account of the colonial economy, a task which I cannot assume here.59 My present emphasis upon culture and the idiom of witchcraft is not meant to imply that order in the customary system was in any sense an automatic outcome of shared culture. Nor have I argued that Britons in any sense controlled the culture they sought to exploit. If they had had sufficient power to mold African culture to their taste, they would have had the power to ignore it as a tool. Making themselves consumers of power generated in the villages was certainly a detour; Britons would have made the way straight for His Majesty's law and order if they could have done so. Had it been possible, they would have instituted the kind of bureaucratic state organization that was evolving in their own society. In the given circumstances, however, the colonial state could not and did not conform to anyone's model of modem state organization. Instead, it took an odd, composite shape, dictated by its rootedness in local particularity. Far from "modernizing" political structure and method, as some scholars of developing societies would have it, "colonialism-on-the-cheap" built an archaic and eclectic structure resembling the cheaper governmental systems of Europe's past. Finally, I am not forgetting that the culture British rulers exploited had its own raison d'etre: to provide everyday social relations with the relative predictability which gives the rational conduct of human life the only context it can have. If culture had not had this raison d' tre, it would not have been useful to the regime; people would have found it easy to reject what was solely a tool for their domination. Witchcraft belonged to this context, as one of many points where moral behavior, physical well-being, mundane technique, and specula- tion about the cosmos, human and non-human, converged and then ramified again into the banalities and crises of living. It is culture in this sense that provided colonial regimes with foundations on which to build. Our ordinary 59. Excellent work along these lines is that of John Lonsdale and Bruce Berman, "Coping with the Contradictions: The Development of the Colonial State in Kenya, 1895-1914," Journal of African History 20 (1979); Idem, "Crises of Accumulation: The Development of Labor Control Systems in Kenya, 1919-1929," Canadian Journal of African Studies 14, no. 1 (1980).</page><page sequence="25">Political Contingencies of Witchcraft 591 presumption that regimes which do without constant coercion depend upon legitimacy leads us to underestimate the contribution of culture. The particularity of the colonial state, born illegitimate and forced to scrimp all its life, reminds us of this contribution. Observing the particularity of colonial state power, I restated the initial query. Why men do not rebel became the question of how a given kind of regime ruled. Setting the problem this way, I attempted a structural account of African colonial regimes' ability to rule without continuous use or threat of force. The concepts "legitimacy," "ideology," "false consciousness," and "hegemony" are hard to separate from a social psychological idiom of thought, which is not always equal to the analytical work it is called upon to do.60 Since it takes for granted the potency of shared beliefs, this idiom would serve us only if we could assume that rulers and ruled inhabited a common moral community. However, the facts of the case at hand do not support this assumption, and they suggest that the mechanisms of political order which derive from it were not at work here. Britons' peculiar claim to legitimacy added nothing to their capacity to rule, while the existence of shared beliefs could and did raise a positive threat of subversion; on the other hand, the witchcraft ideology which did add something need not be understood in the social psychological terms of shared belief; and official turnabouts regarding it cannot be. This structural account attempts, therefore, to move away from the inadequate idiom of attitudes and perceptions, motives and interests, beliefs and values, to which "legitimacy" and related concepts usually lead. They lead in this direction if the answer to the question why men do not rebel sends us "inward, " so to speak, to a "consciousness" conceived of in anthropomorphic terms; if "ideology" is imagined to exist "inside people's heads"; if "false consciousness" is thought of as a wrong movement of intellect; and if "shared belief" is pictured as "mere" belief, rather than as reality created in social life. My term "moral artifact" is intended to denote this reality. I deliberately chose to highlight witchcraft as an adjunct to colonial power because it throws into relief the way moral artifacts exist "inside" and "outside" people's heads. It is the human predicament to be "captured" physically by ordinary ways of doing what we ordinarily do, and mentally by a corresponding idiom of thought. We at once create and are captive of a real world whose order is delimited by the moral artifacts of quotidian activity. Witchcraft managed to "capture" the British skeptic when, in the attempt to secure His Majesty's law and order, he became enmeshed in the day-to-day 60. In States and Social Revolutions, pp. 15ff, Theda Skocpol argues this point in her critique of such overtly psychological theories of revolution as that of Ted Gurr, Why Men Rebel (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1970), from which I drew my opening formulation.</page><page sequence="26">592 Canadian Journal of African Studies order of a society where witchcraft was real. The internal processes of indirect rule teach us that the order delimited by the moral artifacts of quotidian activity must interest anyone trying to grasp the dynamics of state power. A second lesson follows from this one. The functionalist tradition has been justly criticized for (among other things) its one-sided preoccupation with the order secured by culture, to the exclusion of that secured by the exercise of political power. But whatever the vices of the functionalist tradition, its virtue is to have envisaged the creation of a structural, rather than a psychological, vocabulary for the discussion of order. This applies above all to Durkheim, patriarch of the tradition. For all its difficulties, his sometimes maddening vocabulary of "collective consciousness," social "fact," and "moral com- munity" can orient us in potentially fruitful directions. I have borrowed the concept of "moral community" from The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life and derived my own concept of "moral artifact" from it. Possibly, the bizarre sound of his language is the mark of battle - his and ours - to escape in imagination our own texture of thought and life, which unceasingly tempts us to apply psychological concepts to collective phenomena. In sum, there is more, and more serious, gleaning to do from Durkheim's method than most writers in the Marxist tradition have imagined.61 By "order" I do not mean the opposite of revolution, which refers too exclusively to state power. States provide only the thinnest top crust of control exercised throughout society; they have never guaranteed order in this broad sense. I mean that civil order whose opposite is collapse in the fundamental structure of day-to-day existence. When Mao Tse-tung unleashed the Cultural Revolution, he aimed not only at the state's apparatus of law and agents of enforcement but also at a much more pervasive set of relations and expectations which, taken together, sustained a political order he saw as retrograde. (Mao's opponents now engage in an equally pervasive restoration: from the rehabilita- tion of men and ideas discredited in the recent past to that of the long-dead Confucius; from allowing the performance of Beethoven's Fifth in Peking to authorizing new modes of dress - that we may now see Levis on the streets of Shanghai is a fact having recognized political import.) While typically separate from the state, at least to begin with, the structure formed by these relationships and expectations can align itself, or be aligned, to work in tandem with the state. 61. Jiirgen Habermas has gleaned therefrom, but reorients Durkheim's collective concepts in an individualist direction. See his Legitimation Crisis (Boston: Beacon, 1975), pp. 95, 117-20.</page><page sequence="27">Political Contingencies of Witchcraft 593 A great deal of evidence suggesting the importance of such interconnections remains unsystematized and poorly understood. One example is provided by the antinomian "excesses" that surface in revolutionary times, often within disciplined groups of activists. Another is the sexual puritanism which has characterized some successful revolutions. Yet another is the altered treatment of physical artifacts. I have long found it remarkable that revolutionary French crowds took the time to "guillotine" stone personages decorating ancient cathedrals; and equally remarkable the political meaning middle-class American activists of the 1960s gave to vandalism: "trashing." After the fact, such forms of rebellion point to "seen but unnoticed'"62 cultural features of the antecedent political order. In America during the 1960s, how one dressed or did one's hair and whether one washed were not distinct from rebellion and acquiescence. Having one's sexuality molded to standards set in the routine of one's group was not separate from values of patriotism: who did not hear the politico-cultural shorthand "Commie-fag!"? In America we witnessed such interconnections being made a decade ago. In today's America we can discern their mirror images in right-wing attempts to restore "tradition" as a cure for political disarray. It will be worthwhile to map the political vector of such aspirations to "re-civilize." The findings may well interest us quite as much as any which have sprung from the discovery that rulers and political systems lose legitimacy. How cultural patterns are articulated to systems of political domination is a question as important to pose as it is elusive to answer systematically. But we can say for certain that, in times of upheaval, those who move into action grasp its importance immediately, whatever side they are on. There is no genuine revolution which is not at the same time cultural revolution. And there is no serious political repression which does not invade the realm of culture. 62. I borrow this phrase from Harold Garfinkel, Studies in Ethnomethodology (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1967), p. 36.</page></plain_text>
