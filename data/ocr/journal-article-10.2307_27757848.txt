<plain_text><page sequence="1">GIULIO MALTESE* The late entrance of relativity into Italian scientific community (1906-1930) RECENT STUDIES HAVE demonstrated that, except for Germany, the response to Einstein's theory of relativity was cold or even suspicious and hostile.1 Opposition has been motivated by theoretical commitment to the ether or by defense of the more familiar theory of the electrons; elsewhere relativity was deemed trustworthy inasmuch as its postulates could be proven by experiment.2 For many years after 1905, Einstein's special relativity (SR) was often confused with Lorentz' theory,3 since both of them gave the same formula for the electromagnetic mass of the electron. Looking at the issue in terms of scientific communities, it has been suggested that where theoretical physics was poorly developed as an authonomous discipline, the penetration of relativity was slow owing to the lack of physicists *Group for the History of Physics of the Department of Physics, University "La Sapienza," Rome.

This claim applies to France and, to some extent it can be applied to the Italian case too.4 The response to relativity in Italy has recently been the subject of several stud ies.5 While pursuing different goals with different degrees of detail, their authors often proceed by isolating the opinions on relativity that scientists usually expressed in the introductions or conclusions of their scientific papers or in popularizations. These studies, though often insightful, afford only an overall picture, and miss important distinctions. For example, it has been remarked that in Italy, mathemati cal physicists played the role of theoretical physicists and guided experimental physicists in their study of mathematically complex theories like relativity.6 This situation applied, for example, to Augusto Righi, and Tullio Levi-Civita. How ever, it did not apply generally to mathematical physicists, since many of them were hostile or distrustful or indifferent to relativity. For example, Carlo Somigliana was typical of Italian mathematical physicists in seeking a medium with elastic properties capable of carrying electromagnetic waves. Somigliana depreciated the theory of electrons and opposed relativity. The need to dig beneath broad theses is especially clear in the case of Augusto Righi, the most important Italian physicist in the first two decades of the 20th century. In the years 1906-1907 he took part briefly in the debate over the electro magnetic mass of the electron. After that, he did not say a word about relativity until to 1918, when he started to investigate theoretically the Michelson-Morley experiment. Because of his enormous prestige, his silence had a significant impact on the penetration of relativity in Italy. The question of why Righi did not even comment on relativity for so long cannot be answered by broad-stroke history. In what follows, I investigate how and when, if at all, relativity intersected a scientist's professional life, and how much his response related to the role that 4.

Total silence can be as significant as a direct statement. Furthermore, a favorable response may turn out to be superficial praise. This was the case of the mathematician Guido Castelnuovo. Finally, my approach makes possible a test of the thesis that mathematicians showed a more favorable attitude towards relativity than physicists. In fact, the mathematicians went their own various ways. Once again the need to reconstruct individual contexts is ap parent. In order to explain the diversity of responses, I estimate the awareness of, and clarify the attitudes of Italian scientists toward Hertz' and Lorentz' theories, other electron theories, the "electromagnetic worldview," the electrodynamics of mov ing bodies, and so on. I will organize my account according to typical entry ways, for example, de bates over the electromagnetic mass, Minkowski's four-dimensional formulation, the empiricist approach towards the postulates of SR, and the attitude of mathema ticians towards the new theory. Consequently, I deepen the analysis of the experi mental and theoretical research that some Italian physicists, especially Michele La Rosa and Quirino Majorana's investigations of the second postulate of SR, Majorana's experiments on the absorption of gravity, and Righi's research on the theory underlying the Michelson-Morley experiment. Here cultural influences, com ing from Italy and elsewhere played an important part. I take into account a broader community than the one usually considered, by including astronomers as well as physicists and mathematicians. Italian astrono mers had to take a position on general relativity (GR) after the publication of the 1919 eclipse. This episode offers an opportunity of putting Italian affairs in the framework of international science, particularily the short-lived Commission on Relativity of the International Astronomical Union. 1. FAILED ENTRIES, 1906-1915 In the decades 1880-1900, many European physicists labored to penetrate Maxwell's Treatise and to interpret the equations describing the propagation of electromagnetic waves according to a mechanical model. A dynamic Lagrangian approach prevailed in Great Britain and Germany making a specification of the energetic properties of the ether necessary.7 This opened the way to dematerializ ing the ether and inverting the relationship between mechanics and electromagne tism to make an electromagnetic worldview. In Italy and France, however, the prevailing approach was to establish a correspondence between the equations of the electromagnetism and the equations of elasticity. In the field of elastic media Italian mathematical physics had a strong tradition dating from the 1870s, when Enrico Betti showed how to treat problems of elastostatics with methods analo gous to Gauss' and Green's potential theory. Following Betti's approach, almost 7.

For example, Eugenio Beltrami demonstrated that it is impossible to reproduce the pressure field defined by Maxwell's equations through the field of deformation of an isotropic medium. Betti and Beltrami strongly influenced the attitude of Italian scientists towards electrodynamics. Carlo Somigliana, who was to become one of the actors of the debate on relativity was one of their followers. Electromagnetic mass Before 1905, the papers on theoretical electrodynamics published in Italy con cerned solely Hertz' theory, expounded in his famous papers of 1890, also pub lished in Italian in Nuovo cimento.8 Tullio Levi-Civita devoted one of his earliest papers to bringing Helmholtz' equations into Hertzian form. Vito Volterra, one of the most important Italian mathematicians, published two papers on Hertz' elec trodynamics.9 In the first one he showed how Hertz' hypothesis concerning the total drag of ether by moving bodies could be employed to describe the electrody namics of resting or moving bodies through a unique set of equations. Volterra employed curvilinear coordinates, which in his formalism played the role of Lagrangian generalized coordinates. In his paper of 1897, Levi-Civita limited his analysis to the electrodynamics of bodies at rest since the extension to moving bodies could be easily obtained using Volterra's approach. Levi-Civita did not comment on the hypothesis of total drag of the ether or mention Lorentz' alterna tive approach to the electrodynamics of moving bodies, which had already ap peared in print in 1892 and 1895. In 1902 Levi-Civita came back to the subject by studying induction phenomena on Hertz' theory.10 In his second paper Volterra demonstrated that the equations of the electrodynamics for bodies at rest could be derived in infinite ways from variational principles. This typical aspect of Volterra's reductionistic program recurs in his sporadic contributions to the debate on rela tivity. Beltrami, too, devoted a paper to the use of variational principles in electro dynamics.11 Before 1906, Lorentz' theory did not receive any attention in Italy. No more did Abraham's or Poincare's theories of the electrons. More generally, the debate concerning the electromagnetic worldview that emerged in 1900 was met with 8.

This happened although Lorentz' papers were not totally un known to Italian scientists: Righi published a paper in the volume dedicated to Lorentz' jubilee in 1900 and in 1904 Levi-Civita wrote complaining to Lorentz that he had omitted quoting Levi-Civita's work on Helmholtz' equations in a re view paper.12 Lorentz' theory received indirect attention in connection with the Zeeman effect; but physicists like Antonio Garbasso, Orso Mario Corbino, and Righi who followed up the effect left aside the underlying theoretical edifice. To be sure, Garbasso and Corbino did not like Lorentz' explanation.13 The neglect of Lorentz' approach no doubt should be sought in the continuist view of physics displayed by Italian mathematical physicists used to working with the partial differential equations describing continuous media or fields. Lorentz' synthesis of ethereal and corpuscular hypotheses was foreign to this research pro gram and to the work of most Italian physicists who, in the decade 1895-1905, dedicated themselves to experimental investigations of the new radiations.14 The Italian scientific community thus missed the opportunity to follow the implication of Lorentz' approach?the need for questioning the validity of the laws of me chanics if the transformation laws of dynamical quantities such as forces and ac celerations were to be retained. Lorentz made clear this implication as early as 1899.15 As for the physicists, we can understand their silence over the electrody namics of moving bodies in light of the essentially experimental nature of their investigations. In the end, the Italian scientific community missed the debate over the foundations of mechanics and electromagnetism that the electron theories brought with them and that presented per se a natural entry for relativity. The debate on the electromagnetic mass of the electron and on the nature of electric radiations took place in Italy between 1906 and 1909. Augusto Righi, then the most important Italian physicist, was the first to enter the field. He referred to Einstein's paper of 1905, mentioned in a footnote among those "notable math ematical researches" concerning the electromagnetic mass of the electron.16 Righi criticized all the electron theories for their assumptions about the distribution of electricity in the electron. In Righi's view, since electron theorists took the elec tron to be a fundamental concept, they should not give it a distribution of electric ity, which could only be a distribution of electrons. To escape what he saw as a vicious circle, Righi assumed that the apparent mass of the electron derives from a 12.

Since Righi considered only rectilinear and uniform motions, his theory could not be tested experimentally by the techniques employed by Walter Kaufmann and Alfred Bucherer. Righi probably asked Levi-Civita for theoretical clarifica tions, since in a letter to Righi of March 1906, Levi-Civita expounded the existing approaches to define the electromagnetic mass of the electron and the reasons why Righi's results differed from them.17 The following year Orso Mario Corbino, the most brilliant experimental physi cist in Italy after Righi, published a paper in which he illustrated Abraham's and Lorentz' theories of the electron. Corbino quoted Einstein apropos of Lorentz' theory: "Lorentz' premises and conclusions are reciprocal: in fact, Einstein could demonstrate that if one sets out to build the electrodynamics of moving bodies starting from the principle of relativity...then the Lorentz deformation has to occur and the same relationship between electron mass and velocity emerges.... Almost simultaneously Poincare came to the same conclusion."18 Therefore Corbino real ized, first in Italy, then by Einstein's revolutionary approach with respect to Lorentz'. However, he maintained that Lorentz' theory could not be based solely on pure electromagnetic grounds and he concluded by criticizing it for lack of agreement with experience: "It is advisable to give up to every metaphysical preconception and to judge the value of postulates according to their agreement with facts; I cannot share Planck's preference for the principle of relativity since Kaufmann's results...cannot be reconciled with Lorentz' theory and, therefore, with the prin ciple of relativity, in so far as we suppose the existence of an ether at absolute rest."19 Thus Corbino, too, supported the conception of an absolute ether that "be cause of its simplicity, remains...the only conceivable ground for a concretely de veloped electromagnetic theory." Finally, Corbino quoted Righi's research on the electron published the year before and he put it at the same level as Lorentz' and Bucherer's theories of a deformable electron, arguing in favor of Righi's approach that it was more natural to attribute the properties of the electron to ether modifica tions. That Levi-Civita was accepted as the leading expert on electron theories ap pears from Volterra's asking him to give "a speech...on the recent issues treated by Poincare and Lorentz on absolute motion [or] on new ideas on the concept of mass" to the Italian Physical Society (SIF).20 Instead, Levi-Civita presented the requested review paper to the Societa Italiana per il Progresso delle Scienze (SIPS). He summarized the current status of the electron theories, remarking that experi 17. Levi-Civita to Righi, 9 Mar 1906, RA. 18.

In this connection Levi Civita referred to the "interesting synthetical remarks on this principle made by Mr. Einstein," evidently seeing Einstein's remarks as an appendix to Lorentz' theory. Levi-Civita made clear his aversion to electron theories. All of the various "kine matic hypotheses" about the nature of the electron were, in his view, "somewhat arbitrary;" "therefore it is not advisable to proceed as if the electron, subject to kinematic constraints, describes physical reality."21 He questioned the concept it self of electromagnetic mass since it implied that mass would no longer be addi tive. Levi-Civita recognized a viable alternative to the electron theories in the so called "asymptotic theory" of electric radiations that he considered as an "addi tion" or a consequence of his previous paper.22 His theory, published in 1909,23 suppressed all "kinematic hypotheses" concerning the nature of the electron. He grounded it on the Maxwell-Hertz equations, the Lorentz force, the second law of dynamics, and the "concept of the continuum." He considered radiation not as a flux of particles ("the ballistic regime"), but as a number of "flux tubes." The self field of the radiation could be taken into account by considering asymptotically (i.e., in the limit of vanishing sections of the tubes) the mechanical force W acting on the elementary section, ds. If F is the force due to the external electromagnetic field, the second law of motion makes the vector equation W + F = 0 (which holds for an elementary cross section of a flux tube), since by hypothesis the radiation flux is massless. According to Levi-Civita, his equation described asymptotically "a pure electromagnetic field, assimilable to a filiform and stationary flux of elec tricity." He added that his equation fulfilled the "Lorentzian" principle of relativ ity since both W and F are forces of electromagnetic origin.24 In this framework ("the hydraulic regime") the deviation that the radiation undergoes in an electro magnetic field depends on the intensity of the flux, which is not the case in the ballistic regime. Therefore Levi-Civita had an experimentum crucis to prove the validity of his theory. His continuist approach to new radiations was criticized by Orso Mario Corbino and Max Abraham at the Padua meeting of SIF in September 1909, where Levi-Civita presented the second of his two papers on electric radia tions.25 Except for sporadic mentions of Einstein's 1905 paper, the debate that took place in Italy on the electromagnetic mass of the electron did not result in perma 21.

Righi had little interest in the matter: since in 1908 he started his studies of "magnetic rays," which he regarded as a new kind of radiation. He devoted most of his time to them until 1918, when he resumed his investigations on topics related to SR.26 In order to develop the theoretical foundations of his research, Righi had to describe the mo tion of charged particles revolving around one another, in what he called "plan etary doublets"?neutral systems of electrons bound weakly to a positive ion, which he took as the ingredients of his magnetic rays. For his purpose Righi employed the methods of classical mechanics; he often employed terms and concepts di rectly borrowed from celestial mechanics. He concluded a paper of 1909 with these words: "the new knowledge we acquired about the structure of matter and the more satisfying hypotheses about the structure of atoms make the known anal ogy between the constitution of planetary systems and that of atomic systems all the more plausible. Once my explanation for magnetic rays is proven, we will have one more analogy, better demonstrated and defined than the others."27 In short, for his theory on magnetic rays Righi did not need?or thought he did not need?the theory of electrons or the new-born SR. Together with a prevailing pref erence for experimental research, this classical modeling may well explain his indifference toward relativity. At the conference of SIPS in 1911, he reviewed all the leading fields of theoretical and experimental research in physics without men tioning Lorentz' theory and relativity. But he strongly endorsed the ether, "whose existence has been proved necessary in order to explain a great number of facts."28 Minkowski's spacetime, 1908-1911 Minkowski's four-dimensional formulation of SR usually provoked debate.29 His relevant paper was published in Italian in the Nuovo cimento, translated and edited by the physicist Giuseppe Gianfranceschi, who also wrote a foreword, and by the mathematician Guido Castelnuovo.30 Gianfranceschi, who had cultivated a personal relationship with Minkowski, gave two talks on the subject at two meet ings of SIF (June 6 and October 22, 1908). The second talk was followed by the expected debate, in which Righi, Corbino, and Levi-Civita took part. However, the report of the debate that Gianfranceschi announced never appeared in print in Nuovo cimento. A similar scenario played out in 1909. On January 23, the Polish born mathematical physicist, Ludwik Silberstein, gave a talk to the SIF entitled "A 26.

Eventually, on April 17, the debate at last took place, Silberstein and Corbino participating but no report appeared in print. Castelnuovo then began to dwell on SR. He gave his first "articulated commu nication" on "Minkowski's ideas" on June 16, 1909, and on November 20 he re commended the second postulate of SR with respect to the emissive theories of light.31 Between his two talks, Castelnuovo published the first paper in Italy con cerning the foundations of SR or, more precisely, of Minkowski's formulation of it. There Castelnuovo extolled Lorentz' theory as "mathematically perfect." He did not mention the difficulties related to the definition of the forces that hold the electron together. However, Castelnuovo went on, Lorentz' theory could not be considered "fully satisfactory" since the ether still played a dominant role in it, analogous to "a scaffolding while building a house." Castelnuovo praised Einstein for "removing the scaffolding, since in his beautiful papers the absolute vanishes and relativity triumphs." Castelnuovo did not obscure the "sacrifices" implied by SR and the skepticism of many scientists over Einstein's novel ideas of space and time.32 Castelnuovo concluded: "the principle of relativity in its vague form is not denied by any fact and corresponds to a need of our spirit. It is...one of those truths...that will survive the catastrophes that gradually overwhelm even the most concrete scientific theories;" "Einstein's views introduce even into the most basic concepts complications that are considered so serious by many important physi cists that they distrust the new theory. Distrust could be fertile [however], since the progress of science requires that no complication can be accepted without a proof of its necessity."33 In his general address at the SIPS Conference in 1911, Castelnuovo praised Einstein's theory for demolishing "anthropomorphic idols" like the "absolute clock."34 Minkowski's formulation was Castelnuovo's target; he treated Lorentz' theory and SR ("we will not follow Einstein in his construction of the new kine matics") superficially, thereby demonstrating that he had no real interest in the foundations of SR or its electrodynamic roots. It was only to be expected that Castelnuovo, then probably the most important Italian expert on algebraic geom etry, would be captivated by the geometrical structure of Minkowski's spacetime.

Burgatti defined Castelnuovo's paper as "half-baked knowledge, stolen here and there from popularizing journals and books, which now even dogs know (at least in that form)."35 Minkowski's formulation of four-dimensional spacetime made possible among other things refinement of the concept of rigidity. In 1909, Max Born gave the definition of rigidity in SR. Levi-Civita attacked it for subverting familiar proper ties of space such as homogeneity and symmetry.36 Among Levi-Civita's corre spondents, only the young mathematical physicist Giovanni Giorgi, later to be come professor of rational mechanics at the University of Cagliari over Enrico Fermi, commented on the principle of relativity. He discussed the implications of Levi-Civita's criticism of the concept of rigidity and was the first in Italy to hy pothesize an extension of the principle of relativity to include gravitation: "can the postulate of relativity of Lorentz and Minkowski be extended [to cover] gravity, light, and electromagnetism and even nonuniform motion? Who knows?...Do think about this point: perhaps there is something fundamental to find."37 In 1911 Levi-Civita remained cautious and hesitant about SR: "There is in mechanics a revolutionary trend. So to orthodox disciples of Newton and Lagrange appears the tendency that, in the name of the principle of relativity of Lorentz Einstein...would make necessary...a reconstruction ab imis of the philosophy of nature. Let us wait before judging. "Levi-Civita also recognized the importance of "[Einstein's] principle of relativity, intrinsically untouchable, however much it overturns our habitual intuitions."38 Neither here nor in his paper of 1907, how ever, did Levi-Civita recognize the difference between Einstein's and Lorentz' theories. But Giorgi, who had discussed absolute motion with Levi-Civita as early as 1904, advanced a reformulation of Newtonian mechanics covariant with re spect to any motion of the coordinate system. To be sure, Giorgi moved in a totally classical context. Levi-Civita, who had instead called Einstein's theory "revolu tionary," greeted Giorgi's as "reforming."

Somigliana's continuing research in electro magnetism sought a suitable elastic model for the ether.40 He deemed it necessary to state that recent advances in electrodynamics had not made his research otiose: "The modern development of the electron theories did not diminish the interest of the classic conception of Faraday and Maxwell on action-at-a-distance....It is there fore not without interest to return to those ideas, which had such importance...in the recent history of electromagnetism."41 Electron theories (and, a fortiori, SR) did not lie on Somigliana's research path. Also the mathematical physicist Umberto Cisotti, Levi-Civita's assistant at Padua between 1907 and 1913, engaged in this research topic, and tried to make it work by giving up the homogeneity of the elastic medium.42 Another typical non-reaction to SR was displayed by the so-called "vec torialists," mathematicians who proposed to reformulate tensorial calculus and differential geometry without using coordinates. When GR came in, the vectorialists would oppose those who argued for absolute differential calculus. Whereas vectorialists approached relativistic issues using absolute quantities, invariant un der a change of reference frame, Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita, who founded absolute differential calculus, grounded in variance on co variant or contravariant transformation laws.43 The most important Italian vectorialists were the mathematician Cesare Burali-Forti; Tommaso Boggio, mathematician of Turin Polytechnic; Pietro Burgatti, Professor of Rational Mechanics at Bologna; and Roberto Marcolongo, Professor of Rational Mechanics at the University of Naples. Marcolongo's papers published just after SR give the flavor.44 In 1906 Marcolongo demonstrated the existence of scalar and vector poten tials and defined Lorentz' transformation as the one that left Maxwell's equations unaltered, and in 1913 he studied the transformation laws of various quantities occurring in SR. Lorentz, Minkowski, and Poincare were the authors he cited most frequently; Einstein's name never appeared.

Marcolongo's main purpose was therefore to demonstrate the power of his mathematical methods. He reported his advances in vectorial formalism to Levi-Civita, who used them in his papers on the asymptotic theory of electric radiations.45 Levi-Civita eventually brought Marcolongo to employ the absolute differential calculus and to become a keen supporter of GR, whose cause benefitted from Marcolongo's skill as a popularizer. In his address to the first meeting of SIPS (1907) Vito Volterra spoke of the "crisis" created by questioning the need for the mechanistic explanations that made up the physics of the previous generation. The electromagnetic worldview had overturned this paradigm: "modern views on the electric nature of matter...have made a profound revolution in our concepts of mass and inertia...and the relativity principle...many scientists may think that the principles in vogue only fifty years ago may not survive the storm that seems to sweep them aw ay... if we also consider that...emission theories seem to be reviving...our sense of surprise becomes even greater...as we see...old concepts coming back to life as ghosts rising from graves we considered forever closed."46 Volterra again treated subjects related to SR in a talk he gave at the Sociedad Cientifica Argentina, which appeared in print in 1910, and in a series of lectures he gave at Clark University in 1909 which were pub lished in 1912.47 Volterra discussed Lorentz' and Poincare's views before passing over Einstein's approach to reach "Minkowski's more recent considerations."48 Volterra failed to recognize the difference between SR and the electron theories. His attitude may have originated in his understanding of research in mathematical physics. Volterra's creed was reductionism; but the mechanistic reductionism that Volterra mournfully mentioned in 1907 could not capture the new development of physical science. Volterra so pinned his hopes on the calculus of variations, which he had already employed in electrodynamics. In the fact, which Poincare had first observed, that action?and therefore the variational principle of least action?is Lorentz-invariant, Volterra saw salvation: "the principle of least action accounts for the success of [Lorentz'] transformation."49 Hence Volterra's lack of interest in Einstein's theory. Also, Volterra highly esteemed Poincare. Volterra prepared an obituary of Poincare, which Corbino criticized as overly partial: "As to relativity...it seems to me an overstatement to say that Poincare's fundamental concepts had joue un si grand role in all later work.

He adver tised "the solemn and threatening problem of the nature and structure of the ether and of its relationship with force and matter;" he spoke of a "crisis" of physics, "which is actually a crisis of mechanics," of a physics that "cannot get rid of the painful concept of the ether;" "if [physics] could dispense with the concept of ether then a return [to Newton's emission theory] would be greeted as a libera tion."51 In 1910 Corbino argued from the equivalence between mass and energy that another "crisis," one involving the fundamental laws of mechanics, impended. The second law of motion seemed to hold only "approximately" since the con stancy of mass "seems to be seriously contradicted by the experiments on the de viation of cathodic rays and beta rays, and is absolutely rejected by Lorentzian and relativistic mechanics." The third law of motion might also be affected, "since it is certainly not valid for electromagnetic interactions among many different bod ies;" but its validity might be restored via the idea that radiation possesses mass, first suggested in 1904 by Hasenhorl and later derived "in the simplest way" by Einstein.52 By 1912 Corbino believed in the correctness of SR. However, his line of work, almost exclusively experimental (electrotechnology, spectroscopy, spe cific heats), did not require him to work in depth on relativity. The second postulate of special relativity The reception of relativity in Italy was conspicuously influenced by the activ ity of Max Abraham, a young and brilliant theoretical physicist, professor of me chanics at the Polytechnic of Milan from 1909 to 1915. Starting in December 1911, Abraham published various papers on relativity in response to Einstein's attempts at generalizing SR.53 A bitter controversy ensued that culminated in 1912. This controversy and one that raged in 1914 concerning GR, have been studied by other historians.54 Here it is important only to emphasize Abraham's criticism 50.

Abraham harshly criticized Einstein's decision to abandon the constancy of the speed of light in his scalar theory of the gravitational field that, he said, dealt a "deadly blow" to rela tivity.55 In October 1912 he concluded his address at the SIPS Congress of 1912 with a series of rhetorical questions: "Will a new, more general principle of rela tivity arise like a phoenix from the ashes [of SR]? Or will we return to absolute space? And will we bring back the much disdained ether so that it can take on not only the electromagnetic field, but also the gravitational field?"56 Abraham's arguments aroused great interest. The young Giuseppe Armellini, who was to become one of the most influential Italian theoretical astronomers, expressed an interest in Einstein's theory derived from reading Abraham's papers on gravitation. Also in 1912, in the report recommending Abraham's promotion to Professore Ordinario at the Milan Polytechnic, Levi-Civita remarked that "Abraham's brilliant work did not come to a halt" after his call to Milan. He praised Abraham's new theory of gravitation, in which "plausible hypotheses, directly connected to the usual concepts of classical mechanics, replace the more artificial relativistic suggestions."57 Italian physicists saw in Abraham an eminent scientist prepared to give strong support to their position against SR and for the ether. To his mathematician colleagues Abraham was a brilliant theoretical physicist com petent on their own terrain. Abraham's criticism of Einstein's attempts to general ize SR stimulated some physicists to suggest and even to perform experiments to test the validity of SR's postulates. The first such research dates back to 1912. It was motivated by three factors: Castelnuovo's paper praising Minkowskian spacetime and touching on the experi mental confimation of the postulates of SR, Abraham's engagement against SR, and a debate arising from Ritz' suggestion in 1909 that the light velocity is not a constant, but adds vectorially to the speed of its source.58 American physicists played a prominent role in this debate. The acceptance of SR in the U.S. relied upon the conviction that its postulates themselves had been proven experimen tally. The initial investigations carried out by Italian physicists, whose lines of work were traditionally experimental, arose in the framework of the empiricist response to SR coming especially from the American physicists Richard Tolman and O.M. Stewart. Michele La Rosa started working on SR in 1911.59 In a popular paper, he as serted that SR had "thrown into confusion the ideas that have led and sustained us 55.

I hope that your book succeeds in restoring its reputation."61 La Rosa then entered the debate over the postulates of SR. He compared Lorentz' and Einstein's theories, remark ing that whereas the former contained the concept of a fixed ether?and, therefore, of absolute motion, SR rejected it, hence in Lorentz' theory changes in time, length, and mass "are to be considered real...they become merely imaginary?even psy chological as Lewis and Tolman put it?in Einstein's theory." Because of their "the momentous implications," investigating their "theoretical and experimental foundations" required the utmost care. La Rosa accepted the first postulate of SR, which he considered "experimentally proven," but not the second postulate. He endorsed Stewart's hypothesis, according to which the constancy of c follows from the fundamental hypothesis concerning the existence of an ether pervading the whole space. "And it is quite puzzling," La Rosa went on, that "the theory of relativity, which from the very beginning denies the existence of ether, is grounded on...a fundamental concept of the ether itself."62 Here lies the true motivation of La Rosa's work: to build a theory capable of discriminating experimentally be tween the hypothesis of the constancy of the speed of light and that of the compo sition of velocities. La Rosa proposed to carry out the Michelson-Morley experiment employing an extra-terrestrial light source. In contrast to the theory of relativity, the emission theory would demand a shift of the interference fringes on rotation of the appara tus corresponding to the following difference in times for light paths: (1) t- 6 = -2lv2/c3 Here t and 9 are the travel times of light parallel and normal to the Earth's motion through the ether, respectively; / is the length of the arms of the interferometer and v the earth's speed relative to the ether. To get equation (1) La Rosa employed the Stewart-Thomson hypothesis that the velocity of light reflected by a moving mir at the University of Palermo in 1914 and full professor in 1918. By 1911, he had worked on electric discharges. Antonio Sellerio, "In memoria di Michele La Rosa," NC, 10 (1933), 317-328. 60.

However, Tolman soon demonstrated that this hypothesis led to unacceptable consequences. In a subse quent paper, therefore, La Rosa employed Ritz' hypothesis, that the velocity of reflected light remains c with respect to the original source. He arrived at a result differing from equation (1) only in sign. Whatever the sign, the point was the same, to show, following Abraham, that Einstein himself, while striving to gener alize the theory of relativity, had been forced to abandon the constancy of speed of light. "One may well say that the creator killed his creature [SR] in his last effort to ensure it control of the Universe."63 His suggestion, however, was coldly received by the Italian scientific community: Abraham pointed out to him that "The ballis tic theory of light disagrees with certain Doppler effects and therefore has to be rejected."64 Corbino observed sharply that "the shift of spectral lines of moving sources said the last word in favor of Einstein's second postulate;" "for those who, like me...consider the second postulate better confirmed than the first, your new experiment could not say anything more to the point even if it were...performed."65 Nonetheless Corbino appreciated La Rosa's book on the ether ("Garbasso is half way through reading; also Levi-Civita mentioned it to me."66) and asked him, also in the name of Castelnuovo, to give a talk at the SIPS meeting in 1914 about "the second postulate of SR and the speed of light." By then La Rosa had already suspended his research on the subject. A reason for the suspension was Willem De Sitter's demonstration in 1913 that "the motion of 'double stars'...proved in a compelling... way that the speed of light was inde pendent of the motion of the emitting source."67 De Sitter stated that the ballistic hypothesis implied that the motion of double stars that could be observed only spectroscopically would appear confused and, what was more important, would not appear Keplerian, in conflict with observations. Furthermore, from astronomi cal data De Sitter proved that if a law like c' =c+kv held for the composition of velocities, then k could not exceed 0.002. He concluded that this result was in agreement with Lorentz' theory.68 Additional reasons that induced La Rosa to stop his research were the smallness of the effect to be investigated and the uncertainty over the correct hypothesis about the velocity of light reflected by a moving mir 63.

During the decade 1913-1923 he worked on electric discharges, electric properties of metals, and the Hall effect. In the latter case he undertook an empirical investigation without invoking the elec tronic theory of metals, which was still obscure and incomplete.70 The debates over electron theories, the electromagnetic worldview, Minkowski's formulation of SR, and emission theories did not succeed in inducing any impor tant Italian scientist to take up SR systematically. Even mathematicians who pur sued investigations related to SR did not become involved with it. Also among the most important scientists the prevailing attitudes were indifference (Volterra) and caution (positive, as in Levi-Civita), or negative (as in Righi and La Rosa). A real debate on SR did not take place in Italy. Until the end of World War I, SR and GR were almost totally ignored.71 2. MAJORANA AND RIGHI ON FOUNDATIONS, 1916-1921 For many years, beginning in 1916, Italian physicists tried to disprove relativ ity. The most important of them were Quirino Majorana, Professor of Physics at the University of Turin and later president of the SIF, and Augusto Righi, profes sor in Bologna until his death in 1920, several times a candidate to the Nobel Prize. Following Stewart and La Rosa, Majorana pointed out that the second postu late of SR stemmed from "the theory of the vibrations of the ether" and, conse quently, raised a contradiction for "supporters of relativistic theories, who do not deem it necessary that the ether exists to justify the constancy of c."72 He referred to the American mathematician Robert D. Carmichael's analysis of the logical structure of SR. Carmichael took "the extraordinary element" of SR to stem from the postulate regarding the light velocity.73 Majorana understood Carmichael's statement as an indication of a weakness of the second postulate. Elsewhere Majorana's criticism was sharper: "The postulate [of the constancy of c] does fol low necessarily and rigorously from observed experiments; it is rather a bold hy pothesis that, in turn, explains the facts. In other words, another theory, instead of relativity, might well prove able to interpret the phenomena...surely, if this hap 69.

He felt that even those who supported relativity wanted to find compelling experimental evi dence for or against it; "and such a wish is related to the crisis which [SR] has suffered recently."75 The "crisis" Majorana referred to was Einstein's difficult path toward GR: like La Rosa, Majorana had a distorted idea of the genesis of GR. They both depicted it as a "crisis"?since SR had initially given up the validity of its second postulate?from which the theory came back like a patient recovering from an illness. Even if Majorana knew that the "crisis" ended successfully in the creation of GR, he went on testing the second postulate of SR experimentally without mentioning that it did not hold in the new and more general theory. Being dissatisfied with the evidence adduced by Tolman against emission theo ries,76 Majorana studied the Doppler effect of light reflected by a moving mirror. In his view, the "relativistic hypothesis" rested on the assumption of a fixed ether. In this case, the wavenumber n and the wavelength X of light undergo the follow ing transformation after reflection from a mirror moving toward the observer with a speed v: (2) n' = n(l+j8) A'=A(l-j8), where (3=v/c. According to the ballistic theory: (3) n' = n(Up) X' = X Equations (2) and (3) are valid to first order in (3. Majorana employed an interferometrical technique to discriminate between the two cases. However, he did not detect any variation in the wavelength of the reflected light originating from the motion of the light source. He decided to carry out another experiment with the source now in motion with respect to the observer. Majorana was the first to propose and perform this experiment, which had the challenge of impressing an adequately high speed on the light source. Again, the outcome favored SR. In the following years Majorana's anti-relativism grew stronger. In 1921 he observed that "even if relativistic theories are largely preferred...by mathematical physicists, by mathematicians, and by some astronomers, the majority of experi mental physicists still refuse to accept them."77 He refused to give up the concept 74.

He rejected the concept of an empty space, since actions could not propagate in a vacuum; interference or polarization could be explained only by resorting to ether. He could understand the curvature of space required by GR only as the flexing of a substance that loses its isotropy in the presence of ponderable matter. Majorana identified this substance with ether. "Therefore it seems that rela tivistic theories discard the classic ether in accounting for the propagation of light while bringing it back for gravitation, albeit with a different role. Looked at from the principle of avoiding unnecessary hypotheses...those theories did not advance science very much." Although formulated in 1921, his criticisms reflected his po sition in 1916: "even if I admire [relativistic] theories as a logical structure, I never really trusted them, and I will change my mind only when experiment or observa tion demonstrates that they are absolutely necessary."78 Ironically Majorana's ex periments were often mentioned as evidence of the validity of the second postu late.79 Although he could not find any evidence against relativity, Majorana's skepti cism prompted him to investigate the causes that might have influenced his ex periments. Among them he included the action of the earth's gravitational field on the propagation of light. Thus Majorana decided to investigate the existence of "gravitational absorption," i.e., to determine whether the force of gravitation could be weakened by the intervening matter. He also hoped to throw light on the origin of stellar heat, perhaps as a spontaneous response of matter in the presence of other matter. Majorana modified Newton's gravitational law to account for the attenuation resulting from the intervening matter: (4) F - -Gmxm2e'hpvr I r2, where h is the coefficient of gravitational extinction; pvthe true density between the two mass-points mx and m2; and r, the distance between the mass-points. Be tween 1918 and 1924 Majorana carried on four experiments to test this equation, first at the Polytechnic of Turin and later at the Institute of Physics of Bologna University. He tried to determine the variation of weight of a mass weighed with or without a shield with mass much greater than the one to be weighed.

To obtain an equation when m cannot be considered a point mass, Majorana had the help of his colleague Guido Fubini, a mathematician at the Turin Polytechnic.80 The experiments presented almost insurmountable difficulties. Especially in the second experiment, where he used a shielding mass of approximately 10,000 kg, Majorana had to eliminate many sources of error.81 He obtained a value for h of the order of 10~12 cm2/g, close to the maximum sensitivity of his apparatus. Majorana's experiments aroused the interest of authoritative members of the Ital ian scientific community, as is testified by Majorana's correspondence with Levi Civita and by the support he received from Senator Volterra and Prof. Paolo Boselli, a deputy in the Italian Parliament (and Prime Minister in 1916-1917) and the presi dent of Turin Polytechnic.82 The notions of gravity that Majorana developed during the experiments caused him to conjecture on the nature of gravity; this in turn was likely to affect the concept of ether. In a paper of 1921 he speculated that gravity was caused by "the emission of energetic particles by matter."83 He rejected the hypothesis that grav ity acted through elastic strains in an ethereal medium because its effect on matter would have been much like electric or magnetic permeability, whereas he sought an effect of absorption of the gravitational force. His rejection of the ether did not bring him closer to relativity: "If we follow some bold modern ideas, the ether...might not exist at all. I am not referring to the theory of relativity, which has the fault of not being a real physical theory. If, in fact, we ask a relativist about the need of admitting the existence of the ether, his answer cannot be satisfactory."84 However, in 1922 Majorana credited relativity for dethroning the ether: "we may well question the need of such a theory [relativity], which is far from being widely accepted, especially among experimental physicists. I am not myself a relativist, but I draw from this theory...arguments to establish this postulate: the ether does not exist."85 80.

In July 1921 Albert A. Michelson asked him for permission to repeat his experiment: "I have been very much interested in your very important work on gravitational shielding and it seems to me you have neglected no essential factor. I have been requested by Dr. George Ellery Hale to undertake a repetition of your research at his laboratory in Pasadena Cal. But, before giving my consent, I am writing to know if you would have any objection?and I trust you will not hesitate to express yourself on the subject with entire freedom?and I can assure you that I should not think of intruding in a field which you have made your own unless I have your approval."86 The permission was given but Michelson never performed the experiment.87 Again in 1921 Henry Norris Russell and Arthur Stanley Eddington commented expensively on Majorana's work on gravitational absorp tion.88 While they questioned the validity of his results, they tried to justify a quali tative effect of gravitational absorption from relativistic theory. Majorana promptly rejected their explanations. "Einstein's conception cannot be grasped by most experimental physicists. The reason for this is not to be sought in their lack of mathematical knowledge...but in the different mentality of an ex perimental...physicist as opposed to a mathematical physicist. The former cannot accept some of the postulates or premises on which Einstein's theories are based, since they are too far from the reality of the phenomena he is used to seeing; the latter, probably considering those postulates as necessary to explain some experi ments (like Michelson's)...and [being] ultimately attracted by admirable analyti cal constructions, attributes reality to their results, even if they are not always compatible with what is usually observed. This is why I think the pure physicist cannot be a relativist, [at least] in the Einsteinian sense."89 Besides these revealing words, another evidence of the distance between Majorana and his critics comes from the argument he adduced to disprove the famous problem of the rotating disk. The fact that it is impossible to build a gravitational field equivalent to the centrifugal force acting on an observer located on the edge of a rotating disk helped guide Einstein on his path towards GR. Einstein realized that in a rotating disk Euclidean geometry did not hold.90 In Majorana's view, such a gravitational field can be constructed, provided that his hypothesis of gravitational absorption holds and that the disk is immersed in a material "of adequate density."

Since then all attempts to reveal an effect of gravitational absorption have failed.92 In the end, Majorana's experimen tal results were rejected by the international scientific community not through con clusive experimental refutation, but rather through neglect. They conflicted with the more powerful framework provided by GR. The state of affairs had changed quite radically since 1910, when gravitational absorption had been taken into ac count by the German astronomer Kurt Bottlinger and by De Sitter in order to ex plain some anomalies in the moon's motion. Majorana's hypothesis on gravitation did not lie in the mainstream of physics in the 1920s. Between 1918 and 1920, following his research on magnetic rays, Righi en tered the field against SR by trying to show how the negative result of the Michelson Morley experiment could be by classical optics. In his last paper, he proposed an experimentum crucis which death prevented him from doing.93 In Righi's view, most experimentalists preferred the contraction hypothesis for explaining the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment to everything in SR; "those who are accustomed to the experimental method consider suspiciously everything close...to metaphysics that threatens to break contact with the real world."94 Righi grounded his analysis on Huygens' principle, according to which the reflection of light on a mirror in motion with respect to ether happens as if the mirror is at rest but rotated at an aberration angle (|), given to second order in p=v/c by (6) &lt;/&gt; = /3+/32/2 . Michelson and Morley had employed (|)=p, neglecting the second term in the right hand side of equation (6). Using the fuller equation, Righi concluded that no fringe 91.

"Evidently, if this result had been known before 1887, perhaps Michelson's experiment would not have been conceived, and it would not have led to relativity and contraction."95 However, if the position ing of the reflecting bodies differed from the ideal one, a fringe shift would occur on a 90? rotation of the apparatus. Righi demonstrated that, if one of the mirrors made an angle |Lt with respect to its ideal position, the shift would be (7) ^W+p-e) , where / is the length of the arms of the interferometer, X the wavelength of the incoming light, and ? the difference between the length of the arms. Comparing the classical expression (2l/32/X) with equation (7), we see that the latter strongly depends on the initial positioning of the reflecting bodies. Since a shift would occur in the case of a deviation however small, Righi as serted that SR had some experimental basis. "Hopefully, [however] sooner or later we will be able to explain all of the most important results given by Einstein's theory in different ways....I sincerely hope that an explanation of the considerable deviation of light beams in proximity to a great mass like the sun can be found without the necessity of new metaphysical concepts, because the scientific progress of humanity would certainly be improved if the foundations of natural philosophy were not limited to the few people who can easily handle the most complicated mathematical instruments."96 In March 1920, Lorentz wrote Righi: "As to Michelson's experiment, I think I can defend the thesis that it contradicts what is to be expected from Fresnel's theory of a stationary ether."97 Fubini criticized Righi's use of Huygens' principle and the assumption of plane waves.98 Levi-Civita, whom Righi asked to check his calcula tions, showed some initial interest: "what you write on the influence of |a on the final result highly interested me."99 A few days later, after reviewing Righi's pa pers, Levi-Civita admitted that his own "lack of competence as to experiments" prevented him from playing the role of devil's advocate that Righi had wanted him to perform. He did suggest that Righi take into account the effect of a difference ? in the length of the arms of the interferometer.100 Righi accepted this advice, as appears from equation (7). In a subsequent letter, Levi-Civita reported missing some minor faults in Righi's calculations because he had not followed strictly Righi's criterion of "referring everything to the ether [reference frame]": "I main tain perplexed since, as I remember I mentioned to you last year, I find it painful to represent phenomena in absolute space.

Righi interpreted Levi-Civita's la conic reply as a way of freeing himself from uncongenial work. Righi therefore wrote that he would not bother Levi-Civita again?though hoping that if the math ematician "saw me on the point of falling into a blunder you would halt me on the brink."102 Righi also involved Ludwik Silberstein, whom he had met when Silberstein was a Privatdozent in Bologna in the years 1899 to 1903, in his project. Silberstein had become a consultant at Hilger, a London firm of optical instruments; Righi now asked him to build an apparatus to test Righi's theory of the Michelson-Morley experiment.103 Righi found in Silberstein a knowledgeable interlocutor, who did not like the theory of relativity: "I have to say that the silence of your colleagues (which you complain about) about your criticism seems to me very strange, since scientists should have no prejudices. But perhaps it is a sort of intellectual lazi ness. I have to add that I am not a blind admirer of Einstein's theory, least of all of GR, and I have fought against it several times. I like its mathematical structure, but I do not think it very promising...as a physical theory. I'll be glad to correspond with you on this topic from Rochester [where Silberstein was to assume a position at Eastman Kodak Research Center], where I plan to make further attacks against this modern idol both on experimental and theoretical grounds."104 Righi's version of the Michelson-Morley experiment ran into difficulty. The Jesuit astronomer Stein, who had spent some years at the Vatican Observatory, at first supported it.105 Then articles in the Comptes rendus questioned it. After Righi's death, Giorgio Valle re-examined his theory in detail, corrected a few errors, and concluded that the result obtained by Michelson and Morley was to be expected.106 101.

Corbino recalled Righi's making a special trip to Rome to communicate to him and Levi-Civita "the results of his research and to confess his puzzlement...at the unexpected re sult."107 And, as Valle's paper showed, Righi had been right to be puzzled.108 Levi-Civita gently refused to write the introduction to a reprinting of Righi's papers on the Michelson experiment. Righi's research, he said, provided "every thing needed to interpret correctly the classical Michelson experiment;" by ques tioning the validity of the Michelson-Morley experiment Righi had provided "a magnificent confirmation of the standard interpretation at first too hastily ac cepted."109 That leaves Majorana. His commemoration of Righi contained a manifesto of attitude of Italian anti-relativism: "Righi's attitude rejected the feeling of the ma jority of Italian experimental physicists, who like to form a mental representation of phenomena corresponding to something real and often even material...[E]ven if for the experimental physicist, space and time do not have to be absolute, they cannot be replaced in his mind by Einstein's relativistic criteria. He [the experi mental physicist]...needs to investigate the outer world on the basis of true knowl edge corresponding to his nature and his senses. This is the reason that he cannot accept Einstenian theories, despite the received astronomical confirmations. Such was Righi's attitude...he was confident that the confirmations could be interpreted without resorting to new metaphysical concepts, i.e., without the theory of relativ ity. I feel that this attitude...which coincides with mine, cannot be faulted." Ac cording to Majorana, the focus of Righi's program was "the fundamental issue for the acceptance of Einstein's theory, i.e., the existence of classic ether."110 3.

Levi Civita became an enthusiastic supporter of Einsteinian theories, producing fifteen papers on GR between 1917 and 1920. These papers dealt with GR's analytical principles, field equations and their exact solutions, and comparisons between GR and classical mechanics.112 In 1917 he gave the correct definition of the conserva tion of the gravitational stress-energy tensor through the contracted Bianchi iden tities.113 This paper was the first presentation in Italy of the final form of GR. In other papers of 1917 Levi-Civita introduced the fundamental concept of parallel displacement and studied problems of static gravitation.114 His contributions were as important as those of Weyl and Eddington. Additional original contributions to GR came from Levi-Civita's disciples Carlotta Longo, Elisa Furlanetto, Armando De Zuani, Antonio Signorini, Umberto Cisotti, and Attilio Palatini.115 The most important of these was Attilio Palatini, mathematician and theoretical astronomer, who gave a variational formulation of gravitational field equations.116 Even Majorana hoped to grasp relativity through Levi-Civita's work, "which I will study attentively, though I am afraid I cannot penetrate them."117 The same can be said for Guido Castelnuovo: "I have just read with great pleasure your paper on parallelism...the simplicity of [your] results proves that it is a natural concept of differential geometry and it is puzzling that it has escaped so far those who culti vate that field of mathematics."118 The theoretical astronomer Giuseppe Armellini wrote: "I just received your beautiful papers on Einstein's gravitational fields, a...fundamental topic that you control so perfectly."119 Finally among converts must be mentioned Roberto Marcolongo, who mas tered absolute differential calculus and went on to study and popularize the theory of relativity.120 A series of seminars given in 1919 at the Seminar for Mathematics of Science Faculty of the University of Rome, organized by Volterra and Castelnuovo, fo cussed attention on relativity and the absolute differential calculus of which math 112.

Replying to Levi-Civita's request to lecture, Marcolongo proposed a historical survey, "because in Rome nobody knows about [absolute] calculus." Castelnuovo wanted two lectures; "on the old and new relativity," and he warned Marcolongo, which was scarcely necessary, that "al most all of us know nothing about absolute differential calculus." They preferred to have it explained by an outsider rather than Levi-Civita, "since what is hard for the laymen is too easy for the author."121 Levi-Civita, then recently appointed at the University of Rome, opened the seminar on March 8 with the most influential of the lectures. It was a masterpiece of argument, opportunism, and caution.122 In politics few people like to be considered only...conservatives, since often con servative means reactionary...But many scientists...have to be conservatives be cause they must watch over a consolidated intellectual wealth and evaluate criti cally everything that threatens to change or diminish it. From this point of view I am proud to speak to an audience of conservatives, and I will be appropriate in trying to draw your thoughts toward the new mechanics, without awakening sus picions by reckless demolition. I plan to demonstrate, with a couple of simple, concise, classical formulas, how a legitimate wish for a formal generalization, on the one hand, and for a conceptual synthesis on the other, make some modifica tions of general laws plausible. These modifications, quantitatively very slight, but conceptually grandiose, were recently put forward by Einstein in a structured framework, that gives an exhaustive account of many facts, and especially of a famous optical experiment and of an astronomical phenomenon (the advance of Mercury's perihelion) that have so far eluded even the most vigorous efforts grounded on old theories. Levi-Civita thus sought to minimize the differences between the old and new me chanics and to answer the objection that the new was too "mathematical," too "formal." Levi-Civita countered that relativity deserved trust "not merely because of a sort of mathematical ideology...but because of experience" and gave Majorana's confirmation of the constancy of the speed of light as an example. As for minimiz ing difference, Levi-Civita established a correspondence between GR and Newtonian mechanics: "just as universal gravitation in Newtonian mechanics in troduced an interdependence in the motion of all ponderable bodies...the new me chanics links all natural phenomena together into a comprehensive framework through the equations of individual physical theories, slightly modified, and the equations of the gravitational field."123 The lecture, especially in its published form, at last awakened mathematicians who opposed relativity.

Carlo Somigliana, Professor of Mathematical Physics at Turin, wrote Levi-Civita: "I am reading with great interest, as a hardened conservative, your beautiful lecture on relativity...I saw that you tend toward the sort of popular ization...that you used to oppose;" Cesare Burali-Forti intended to study the theory "which now seems to me...rather obscure;" Mauro Picone hoped to fulfill his cher ished wish to devote time to relativity; Pietro Burgatti still "doubt[ed] that the theory is a good physical theory," but conceded its attractiveness; Gian Antonio Maggi declared that he wrote he would like to teach it, "but I first want to under stand it in detail." Vincenzo Cerulli, President of the Italian Astronomical Society, praised Levi-Civita's lecture, and asked for more. "You are the master of this ab struse relativity, and I will take advantage of your mastery and patience in asking for further explanations....I feel that the new mechanics will bring substantial clari fications to astronomy?not regarding the advance of perihelia, which Newton had already suggested, but mainly for the change in the Doppler principle....We may assume that with this approach the mass or energy of the whole solar system can be investigated."124 Marcolongo's three lectures concerned SR, GR, and the anomalous advance of Mercury's perihelion.125 The debate on relativity now entered its climax, fueled by Levi-Civita, Marcolongo, and measurements of the eclipse of May 23, 1919. 4. THE DEBATE, 1919-1927 On November 6, 1919, Frank Watson Dyson, Astronomer Royal of England, announced that the results of the eclipse expeditions confirmed Einstein's predic tion. Einstein suddenly became an international celebrity.126 In fact, the measure ment fell between the Newtonian and the Einsteinian value.127 Dyson and Eddington played a major role in determining that the eclipse results confirmed GR. Silberstein correctly pointed out that the eclipse results could not confirm Einstein's theory in the face of the negative evidence from red-shift measurements. But Silberstein's opinion did not receive much attention; and within a year, reputable scientists "saw" 124.

Astronomers and the 1919 eclipse: The Commission on Relativity Not so in Italy. In August 1920 Vincenzo Cerulli, a leading Italian astronomer, concluded from his analysis of the data that "the deflections closely follow Einstein's law, but another source for the phenomenon cannot be excluded."129 A colleague of Cerulli's at the Collurania Observatory, Giovanni Zappa, published a similar analysis and conclusion.130 "Additional data are needed to demonstrate that Einstein's effect exists beyond any doubt." He repeated a proposal he had ad vanced in 1917 to measure the deflection of starlight passing by Jupiter, "a mea surement that does not seem as unfeasible as Eddington and his fellows think."131 Einstein came to Italy in October 1921 at the invitation of the mathematician Federigo Enriques on behalf of the Committee for the Popularization of New Sci entific Theories. He gave three lectures at the University of Bologna and one at the University of Padua. The visit gave rise to newspaper articles and rekindled po lemics between supporters and detractors of relativity. Giovanni Boccardi, Profes sor of Astronomy at the University of Turin and Director of the Observatory of Pino Torinese, fought with the mathematician Guido Fubini in the pages of La stampa. Boccardi explained the success of Einstein's theory as an "international plot:" "From the tenacity...with which some people support the new theory one must deduce that stronger ties than simply scientific ones link Einstein to his par tisans. In this way the cancan deafening today the entire world can be explained." Boccardi added that the experimental evidence for GR was not secure; the eclipse data "could be attributed to a hundred different causes;" "the displacement of spec tral lines are absolutely contrary to Einstein's predictions;" Mercury's perihelion motion, explicable in several ways, was "the least of our worries." Boccardi men tioned Von Seeliger's hypothesis of 1906, which De Sitter had rejected as "super fluous" in 1916.132 Boccardi concluded his article by expressing his "personal feeling" that "within fifty years Einstein's hypotheses will be referred to much like Clairaut's 1754 at tempt... while Newton's law will still reign undisputed, continuing to be the basis 128.

"It must be left to the future to decide if Einstein's magnificent edifice will hold.134 Boccardi replied questioning the validity of the Michelson-Morley experiment: "my esteemed colleague prof. Majorana well knows how hard and difficult it is to exclude every undesired effect from his most subtle experiments on the change of gravitational force due to intervening matter!" Boccardi was among those who ascribed the existence of the theory of relativity to the need to explain the negative result of the Michelson-Morley experiment. He rejected relativity as the imperti nent weapon of physicists "willing to give bodies to ghosts." In his frustration, Boccardi brought together the theory of relativity and the difficulties of Italian society during the 1920s: "I have to express the impression the tendency to subversion I see in science makes on me: it seems that the disorder, the plague we deplore in society, is being transferred into science."135 The contro versy between Boccardi and Fubini became a turf war. Fubini exhorted observa tional astronomers "to leave to theorists the task of making, modifying, creating, and destroying theories." Boccardi replied that "those who are used only to ma nipulate formulas may find it easy to add one or two or many variables...those who live in the real world do not find it so easy and cannot justify it by the very first difficulty the theory encounters."136 One of the victims of World War I was the International Association of Acad emies, whose purpose had been to coordinate the international scientific activities and whose center was the Berlin Academy. In October 1918 it was replaced by the International Research Council (IRC), whose statutes excluded citizens from the former Central Powers from its administration, scientific meetings, and research projects.137 At its Constitutive Assembly in Brussels in July 1919, it brought into being the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The first of the Union's thirty two Commissions was devoted to relativity. Chaired by Eddington, it had Giuseppe Armellini, Marcel Brillouin, Heber Doust Curtis, Theophile de Donder, Jun 133. Ibid.

Jeans, Tullio Levi-Civita, Emile Picard, and Paul Langevin as members. Its program, as set out in a letter from Eddington to Levi-Civita:138 My impression is that there is not much scope at present for organised interna tional work on this subject; and that for the present the Committee should be content to adopt a watching attitude, deputing to its individual members the duty of promoting research in their respective countries....I assume that our committee is concerned chiefly with the astronomical aspects of the subjects; and...it is not intended that it should deal with the more purely mathematical and physical de velopments. Eddington suggested that the commission should concern itself primarily with pro moting the search for further evidence of the astronomical predictions made by GR: deflection of light, red-shift and anomalies in planetary motions. Especially the experimental confirmation of the red-shift "should be explored in as many ways as possible."139 The first meeting of the Commission on Relativity took place in Rome, within the first general assembly of IAU, in May 1922. Eddington could not attend; Levi Civita declined his proposal to act as chairman of the commission in Eddington's place, on the ground that an astronomer should serve; and Eddington settled on De Sitter.140 In his inaugural address to the commission, Vito Volterra, chairman of the or ganizing committee, cautiously defended the theory of relativity. He pointed to GR's explanation of the motion of Mercury's perihelion as the most important piece of evidence, "more positive than all the several and often vain discussions about the theory." "From a mathematical point of view...the theory of relativity is as perfect as the ordinary Newtonian theory;" its physical validity, however, was still open to discussion among scientists.141 Now, if relativity agrees with some facts opposed to Newtonian theory and if more such agreements will occur...then the theory of relativity will be better able to explain the phenomena of astronomy...and therefore may well be preferred....When in 1919 at the Brussels meeting it was proposed to devote a session of the Rome Assembly to the astronomical implications of GR, the ad vances made in this field in the last three years, stemming from the 1919 solar eclipse, were hardly predictable. It is not the first time, in the history of science, that astronomical observations have controlled and confirmed theories. Without astronomy the speed of propagation of light would not have been discovered....If the new theory of relativity is gaining credit, this is mainly due to the old astro 138.

Volterra's cautious words prompted an uncautious attack by Vincenzo Cerulli.142 The relativistic commission...is also anti-relativistic [Cerulli thundered]: together with the followers of Einstein pure Newtonians also sit there, like Angelitti, who refuse in principle any interpretation of actio in distans given via ultra-sensible and unrepresentable concepts, and who consider the introduction of the ultra sensible in science as a degenerative crisis....These positivists of astronomy see in the mobile perihelia...only the necessity of perfecting Newton's law in one of the ways suggested by Newton himself....[A]s regards the undeniable deflection of stellar rays near of the sun disk, they expect precise information about the status and the properties of matter surrounding the great luminary. Cerulli referred to a controversy between the observative astronomer Francesco Angelitti and the mathematical physicist Attilio Palatini, who had published a long paper on the motion of Mercury's perihelion according to GR.143 In 1922 Angelitti proposed to explain the anomalous advance of Mercury's perihelion through the following law for the acceleration/:144 (8) f=^r + A The parameter b has to be determined from observations and may vary from one planet to another. GR can produce equation (8) for Euclidean space. However, it also fixed b in terms of constants like solar mass. In GR, equation (8) is self-consistent. Angelitti regarded this feature as a weakness:145 The supporters of GR boast that it could explain the advance of Mercury's perihe lion "without forcing any constants into it;" but probably the main defect that will eventually undermine the whole theory (besides its foundations, which are be yond the reach of intuition, and the complexity if not the intricacy of its analytical procedures) is the rigidity, the lack of elasticity, of those adaptable parameters, that any theory supposed to explain natural phenomena must contain?not too many, rather as few as possible, but some....The theory of relativity...starting from a unique analytical principle established without any hypothesis about the mecha nisms underlying natural phenomena, aims at...explaining all physical 142.

Angelitti blamed GR for being unable to account for the advance of the perihelion of Mars for want of adjustable parameters. Angelitti continued: "The theory of relativity...is founded on the equivalence of all motions that take place in a four-dimensional space, a concept obscure and difficult to grasp...it also makes use of causes no less disgusting to the human intellect, like the curving of space by masses."146 Angelitti's extolled explanations based on Newtonian mechanics with undetermined constants for not pretending "to uncover causes" and for following procedures "the mind is familiar with."147 Palatini replied that a Newtonian law of gravitation corrected to account for the anomalous advance of Mercury's perihelion could not also explain the deflection of starlight: "if the [latter] phenomenon exists...and light has mass, it follows that light obeys a law of attraction different from the one valid for common masses...Thus, Einstein's marvelous synthesis of mechanical and electromagnetic phenomena would fail. Once again scientists would have to seek a unifying theory, i.e., the problem that gave rise to all the beautiful researches...carried on during the last century that culminated in the creation of the theory of relativity."148 Angelitti's note, communicated by Cerulli during the meeting of the commis sion, naturally aroused the commissioners. Dyson argued that the addition of a small term to Newton's law of gravitation would introduce anomalies in the plan etary system, and particularly in the motion of the moon's apse, that had not been observed. Armellini considered that measuring the deflection of starlight passing close to Jupiter's disk would be too difficult; he suggested instead an observation of the perijove of the fifth satellite of Jupiter. Dyson, Emile Borel, and Emilio Bianchi sharply criticized this proposal for its difficulty. The commission did not make much progress. Its first and last report ended as follows: "The discussion concluded without any definite resolution that the Astronomical Union should take any combined action in this matter, but with the hope that researches and observa tions would be continued, which would elucidate the interesting point raised by Prof. Armellini." At the closing session of the General Assembly, Dyson reported that in Commission 1, "No resolutions were proposed."149 Soon after the meeting, Levi-Civita replaced Eddington as president of the Commission on Relativity. In his letter to Alfred Fowler, the secretary of the IAU, accepting his appointment, Levi-Civita proposed a bibliography on relativity.150 146. Ibid., 131. 147. Ibid., 132. 148.

Fowler reminded Levi-Civita that the proposal had to come as a recommendation of the entire commission, in order to gain the approval of IAU's Executive Committee.152 Most members of the com mission supported Levi-Civita's proposal;153 but Eddington and De Sitter, its two most influential members, did not. De Sitter declined to participate in the work.154 Eddington objected that the bibliography "must necessarily include a great deal that is trivial and foolish, which by increasing the bulk renders the bibliography less serviceable. I realize that this is inevitable as the Commission cannot take the responsibility of deciding against including these contributions." As a partial solu tion he suggested indexing the papers under the name of the authors (with a limit to the number of papers per author) and classifying them by subject matter: "ob servational tests of the theory, mathematical development, expository articles, philo sophical, historical, special theory only, controversy, etc."155 Eddington declined to work on the project beyond giving general advice.156 Roberto Marcolongo took charge of the sub-committee appointed to oversee the bibliography.157 The project soon ran into trouble. On July 26, 1923, Pasquier informed Levi Civita that a certain Maurice Lecat was about to publish a bibliography of his own on relativity including some 7,000 titles (Levi-Civita had estimated 1,800 titles).158 Levi-Civita and Marcolongo hesitated between suspending the project and invit ing Lecat into it. Pasquier was the first member of the sub-committee to withdraw his support.159 The project then floundered, and the Commission on Relativity lost its pur pose. At IAU's General Assembly in July 1925, the project of a bibliography was postponed, since Lecat's work had already been published.160 The report of the 151.

De Sitter played a virtual role as chairman since the commission never met and the assembly agreed to suppress it.162 The commission probably would not have been established if the rapid progress made immediately after its establishment had been foreseen. The announcement of the eclipse results in November 1919 canonized Einstein and his theory. Eddington and De Sitter declared the commission to be useless. They believed that little remained to be discovered or confirmed in relativity, except for red-shift evidence. Levi-Civita's bibliography, the only project that had a chance of suc cess, was made otiose by Lecat's bibliography; he was a young man in his thirties, "whose only remunerated work is to give...private lessons in mathematics."163 The story of the commission shows the antithesis between the standpoint of the leading international relativists, who considered GR as an accepted and demonstrated theory, and the prevailing attitude in Italian scientific circles, where opponents to relativ ity still had a majority, especially among astronomers. Popularizations Einstein's visit to Italy in 1921 inspired the publication of some popular books on relativity. Zanichelli published an Italian translation of Einstein's liber die spezielle und die allgemeine Relativitdtstheorie (1917) with a laudatory introduc tion by Levi-Civita.164 In the same year Marcolongo published a book on relativity that received favorable reviews . The mathematician Giuseppe Peano, professor at Turin University, wrote: "I am looking forward to receiving your book; I superfi cially read books by Einstein and Weyl, but I could not understand them very well. I hope to get a clearer picture from your book."165 Gian Antonio Maggi and Giuseppe Armellini resorted to metaphors. Maggi: "You break the bread, which is quite hard in itself, so gracefully and masterfully that if the reader cannot assimilate it prop erly he can only blame his inadequate stomach." Armellini: "I received...your book on relativity and I threw myself into it like a thirsty man who finally finds a spring of pure and fresh water....My first impression was...truly excellent."166 Aug 1923; Lecat to Pasquier, 31 Jul 1923, LCA. 161.

He had expressed strong enthusiasm for Marcolongo's lectures on relativity ("your account makes the theory appear a gran diose synthesis"167). Yet Castelnuovo had "doubts that Levi-Civita unsuccessfully tried to clarify." Castelnuovo's doubts concerned the physical content of the equa tions of GR: "until the research is completed uncertainty will remain whether the equations Einstein gave, almost a priori, do or do not describe the structure of the gravitational field."168 Castelnuovo soon grew sunnier. In his popularization, Spazio e tempo secondo le vedute diA. Einstein, he spoke of the "magnificent edifice" of relativity, which however he thought "would have to be amended in the future." He reported that scientists still disputed the experimental tests of relativistic ef fects: some spoke of "outstanding achievements," others were "skeptical;" for him self, he did not "exaggerate the importance of experimental tests, both positive and negative ones." He recommended caution until "adequate evidence is avail able."169 In two lectures he gave to the Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana in April 1922 Castelnuovo again expressed his doubts about the experimental tests of rela tivistic effects: "these most subtle effects are not completely confirmed and, at first glance, do not sustain the immense edifice of relativity...the new scientific criticism forces us to be more prudent. The same effect might well follow from many different causes."170 In 1923 the publisher Ulrico Hoepli printed an Italian translation of Grundzuge der Einstenschen Relativitdtstheorie by Augusto Kopff. Hoepli asked Italian sci entists who had worked on the theory for short contributions. Levi-Civita supplied a list including Castelnuovo, Fubini, La Rosa, Maggi, Marcolongo, Palatini, Volterra, Burgatti, Francesco Paolo Cantelli, Cisotti, Occhialini, and Cerulli. Of these, only Fubini, La Rosa, Burgatti, and Cerulli contributed to the book although several others submitted manuscripts. The mathematicians Pietro Burgatti and Guido Fubini gave cautious opinions, the physicists Giuseppe Gianfranceschi, Michele La Rosa, Quirino Majorana, and Eugenio Rignano, the Director of Scientia, harsh criticisms.171 In his contribution, Enrico Fermi, reluctant to engage himself in a debate about the metaphysical foundations of relativity, supported it pragmati cally. His remarks on the relationship between mass and energy are interesting: "It does not seem possible that in the near future scientists will find a way to release such a dreadful amount of energy, and we should be happy with this, since the explosion of so immense an energy would have as its first consequence the annihi 167.

Philosophers blamed me...but werfregiert sich darum [dog-German for "who cares"], I do not fear them as long as they do not touch me."173 Augusto Raffaele Occhialini (father of the better-known physicist Beppo Occhialini), associate professor of experimental physics at Cagliari, was included in the list Levi-Civita sent to Hoepli because of his book containing three popular lectures on relativity he had given at the University of Sassari in March 1922. Occhialini openly favored the work of Einstein, "who had restarted the game with new rules" with respect to Lorentz by showing how Lorentz' hypothesis of con traction ("an obvious patch") was in reality "a consequence of a wider construc tion." On the production of energy from mass, Occhialini was more enthusiastic than Fermi: "when this is achieved, the Sarre [Saar] and Ruhr basins will loose their importance in international negotiations, and Italy, despite its beautiful blue sky, will be as rich as England, with all its smoke."174 There remain the astronomers. Sharp hostility or diffuse skepticism character ize the comments by Emilio Bianchi, Giovanni Boccardi, Pio Emanuelli, and Vincenzo Cerulli in the appendix to Kopff's book, partly counterbalanced by the introduction by Giuseppe Armellini, a theoretical astrophysicist suggested for the purpose by Levi-Civita.175 Emilio Bianchi, Director of the Observatory of Brera, Milan, stressed that at the Rome Conference the commissioners agreed that de spite the value of the relativistic explanation of the precession of Mercury's peri helion, "before coming to a definite conclusion it was advisable to wait for a more thorough discussion of all previous observations made on Mercury, in order to make a definitive orbital theory of the planet." Furthermore, according to Bianchi, "the last word has not been said" on the red shift; "the evidence is still far from reaching the degree of certainty without which only induction, but not science, can be done."176 Giovanni Boccardi advanced much sharper criticisms:177 Relativity should be left among other innumerable geometrical imaginings or at least it should be explained to the public that it is of an unjustified a priori cosmo logical theory....Some people have taken for granted what is simply a fantasy...added that [relativity] completed and improved the old theories.178 In defence of relativity?Boccardi continued?proofs have been advanced that do 172.

Vincenzo Cerulli repeated the criticism he had expressed at the Rome Conference in May 1922: "Contrary to the present fashion, I remain faithful to Newton and reject in principle every explanation of action in distance given through the ultra sensible and the unrepresentable....In moving perihelia sound experimental as tronomy has merely to see the need to perfect Newton's gravitational law....As far as starlight deflection is concerned...the shift of stellar positions in the eclipse of 1919 confirmed Einstein's law only approximately."179 Pietro Burgatti also ques tioned the validity of astronomical proofs: "the bending of light rays in the prox imity of the sun and the shift of spectral lines are still moot among experts. Only a small prejudice is needed to infer whatever one likes from the subtlest observa tions. It will be very hard to free these phenomena from all other influences." Burgatti had in mind that the sun cannot be considered a rigid and homogeneous body; its mass is not in equilibrium and its gravitational field is not symmetrical, which "must certainly produce a motion of the perihelion of the nearest planet." No more could the orbital motion of the sun and a possible effect of matter inter posed between the sun and Mercury be ignored. "One should not be blinded by the apparent beauty and grandiosity of a theory....The theory of relativity deserves the greatest attention; it is the work of a genius, and as such it will leave deep traces; but it is not confirmed."180 Pio Emanuelli, astronomer at the University of Rome and at the Vatican Observatory, generously augured that "a final and unquestion able confirmation [of GR] might be achieved in a few decades." Father Giuseppe Gianfranceschi, president of the Pontifical Academy of Science, saw in relativity "a useful guide to research, not a model of the real world."181 Armellini tried to disarm this criticism. He praised relativity for giving rise to a new mechanics, "where an absolute frame of reference is not needed and dynam ics and electrodynamics are joined together;" "this is the great logical significance of this disco very... and it is much more important than the explanation of the slight anomaly in Mercury's motion or of some other astronomical facts about which some astronomers?including myself?still have some doubts." Armellini admit ted that Mercury's motion could be accounted for in many ways, including the one based on the intra-Mercurial matter that had attracted many astronomers before him. Armellini's words sometimes closely resemble the comforting style of his mentor Levi-Civita. He remarked that Newton's and Einstein's theories differed, in their predictions, by "negligible quantities:" rather than dethroning Newton's brilliant work, Einstein's relativity "puts the seal" on it.182 179.

La Rosa came to think that he could explain most of the phenomena of variable stars by assuming that they were double and that the emissive theory of light held. The fundamental postulate of his theory is that the arrival time T of light emitted at time t by a star rotating with period t and tangential velocity v follows the law, to first order in p=v/c: (9) T=t + t(K + Kf5cos&gt;Q)t) where K=d/xc and d is the distance between the star and the observer. If K$ is negligible with respect to 1, the superposition of light rays coming from the star does not affect observations. When K$ is greater than 10, we can no longer dis criminate between a star's successive positions by telescope-based observations nor detect variations of brightness. In this case De Sitter's objections hold. But if ^(3 lies between 0.1 and 10, the moving star must show periodic variations in brightness and magnitude: it appears as a variable star. It was the latter implication that persuaded La Rosa that he could explain all the phenomena of variable stars on two hypothesis: the speed of light adds vectorially to the velocity of the light source; all variable stars are double or more complex. La Rosa said that he conceived his theory without knowing about the vast array of phenomena that it could account for.183 The predictive power of his theory strengthened his criticism against relativity, both special and general. Ear lier in 1912/3, he had limited himself to stating his doubts. By 1923, he thought he had won with his ballistic postulate, designed "to keep untouched the whole edi fice of classical mechanics, since this is the simplest and most advanced part of our science, and to rebuild the conceptual basis of electromagnetism and optics, which are much more recent, complex, and obscure."184 La Rosa's theory pre dicted "a vast amount of facts... totally agreeing with astronomical observations;" hence "Einstein's second postulate is not only groundless but also contrary to natural facts; therefore the 'theory of relativity' has to be rejected, since without the second postulate the whole edifice falls to pieces."185 La Rosa put forward the same arguments again and again.186 183.

Einstein had missed his audience. "The physicist, the philosopher, and the simple layman of common sense cannot be satisfied by the sparkling formulae....They suffer from vertigo from the fright ening destructions that the theory has visited on the most general concepts and from the horrible and breathless void that it leaves." All the experimental proofs in support of GR could be better explained, according to La Rosa, by simpler hypoth eses: the precession of Mercury's perihelion by "a very slight modification of Newton's law," the bending of the light by "the Stokes hypothesis of the ether drag."187 La Rosa reckoned the "vast amount of phenomena" explained by his own theory as "much more important than the three small facts, absolutely insignifi cant and uncertain, that the new theory accomplished in twenty years of effort by invoking new hypotheses repugnant to common sense."188 La Rosa expounded his theory of variable stars in many papers, most of which appeared in 1924.189 His work was unanimously appreciated by Italian astrono mers including Luigi Camera, professor at Trieste and director of the observatory there; Luigi Volta, professor of astronomy at Torino and later director of the Brera Observatory; Emilio Bianchi, and Vincenzo Cerulli, who in 1927, when La Rosa's theory had been destroyed by criticisms both inside and outside Italy, wrote to him:190 I would be so happy if this immense bluff could be unmasked in Italy, where unfortunately there is little originality of thought, whence Einstein's parrots flour ish.

I was serious when I said that you should devote yourself to astronomy. There are very few astrophysicists knowledgeable about physics. Giovanni Giorgi came to La Rosa's support. "I think there are many prejudices against the ballistic theory, and an intentional attitude to ignore it. But in the end it will have to be discussed and investigated seriously."191 Majorana too declared for the ballistic theory "both because I have long felt uncomfortable about the concept of ether, and because your beautiful papers reinforce my uneasiness." Majorana knew about the criticism that the young theoretical physicist of Turin, Gleb Wataghin, had leveled against the ballistic theory. He therefore asked La Rosa if he had discovered "something essentially wrong" in it, since, should that be the case, "my enthusiasm for the project [an experiment relating to the second postu late] would decrease very much."192 Apparently, Majorana did not lose heart since he published a paper in 1927 on light drag by moving matter inspired by "a pos sible ballistic nature of the light."193 Michele Cantone, Professor of Experimental Physics at Naples, author of an important experimental work on elasticity, brought further, if unspecific, comfort: "there are arguments in favor [of the ballistic theory]."194 It was not enough. Wataghin showed that La Rosa's theory had major faults;195 Corbino and Levi-Civita demonstrated that it implied a Doppler effect for the ac celeration that had never been observed. Their prestige and their argument in flicted a serious blow only partially counterbalanced by Giorgi's assertion that the suppositious acceleration could not be considered as evidence for or against the theory.196 Wataghin then renewed his attacks.197 But Luigi Bianchi, director of the 191.

Edwin B. Frost, an as tronomer at the Yerkes Observatory at Chicago, harshly rejected a paper La Rosa submitted to the Astrophysical journal. The astronomer Hermann Kobold and the mathematician Cornelius Lanczos pointed out difficulties in letters to La Rosa. Lanczos observed that Bucherer, an anti-relativist, had refused to review La Rosa's papers "since he deems that the ballistic hypothesis has been disproved beyond any doubt, [and is] totally untenable."202 At the Congress of Physicists held in 1927 in Como, only La Rosa and Giorgi presented papers on subjects related to relativity (on variable stars and Ritz' theory, respectively). The venerable Lorentz criticized both papers.203 La Rosa persisted in his views, though with decreasing vehemence, until 1932, a year before his death. The International Conference on Philosophy, 1924 Michele Cantone made common cause with Majorana, La Rosa, and Righi. In a talk given in 1924 on "The present foundations of physics" he spoke for quantum physics and against relativity, both special and general. To him SR was "[just] a convenient system of formulas" and GR flimsy and unconfirmed."204 Giovanni Giorgi, who had spent the years from 1914 and 1923 as an engineer, interpreted GR as a form of ether theory: since in every infinitesimal spatial domain a privi leged frame of reference can be defined for which the matrix associated with ds2 is diagonal, he proposed to interpret the privileged systems as "physical space, or ether, or ether-space." That suited him perfectly. "It was not a happy choice to 198. Bianchi to La Rosa, 14 Feb 1924, in Nastasi (ref. 61), 42-43. 199. Pincherle to La Rosa, 20 Feb 1924, in Nastasi (ref. 61), 174. 200.

On the contrary, the sec ond relativity theory [GR] revived the concept of ether...eliminated by the first [SR]."205 Giuseppe Gianfranceschi, S.J., who published an Italian translation of Minkowski's paper, devoted most of his scientific life between 1908 and the early 1920s to geophysics and acoustics. Returning then to relativity questions, he ap proved the concept of ether; as late as 1928 he maintained that the ether vortex was the best model of the electron.206 He treated GR in much the same way that the old order of Jesuits had treated Copernican doctrine: "Einstein's theory cannot reveal anything about the real nature of phenomena;" "when the theory says that the path of light is a curved geodetic...we are not allowed to conclude that the space is really curved, but only that there is a state of affairs equivalent to a curvature of space."207 Gianfranceschi rated relativity a "useful mathematical tool." If a new theory made it superfluous he would not have cared: "Generally speaking [he said in an address in 1923] we may safely state that confidence in this theory...declined [during the last year]....This seems to me progress [since]...GR is [just] an ideal construction."208 And still more criticism came. The mathematical physicist Somigliana pub lished a paper in 1922 to show that Lorentz transformations, which he identified as "the cornerstone of the whole theory of relativity," could be obtained in a classical context by considering transformations that leave the wave equation unaltered in a luminiferous ether with certain elastic properties. Voigt had derived Lorentz trans formations in this way as early as in 1887. Somigliana put forward his paper as "a contribution to the current criticism against relativity;" he supposed it to be a dem onstration that "all properties of relativity deriving from Lorentz transformations can be...understood...in a Newtonian framework."209 Contrary to Somigliana's expectations, his classicist approach did not carry conviction even among non relativists. Maggi underlined its physical untenability although he himself pre ferred Newton's theory, as "more suitable to the needs of our intuition."210 The mathematicians Burali-Forti and Boggio joined the fray in 1924 with Espaces courbes?Critique de la relativite. Their main target was Ricci's and Levi Civita's absolute differential calculus.211 They gave no scientific arguments but 205. Giorgi, "I moti vari e l'etere," APA, 78 (1925), 170-181, on 175. 206.

On his interpretation of the Lorentz transformation, both the classical and the Einsteinian approaches to relativity were physically justifiable, and no experiment could dis criminate between them.213 Straneo ascribed the attacks on relativity to lack of knowledge of the physical content of the theory. In his later memoirs, he strove to elucidate the physical content of both SR and GR.214 He criticized Boggio and Burali-Forti for being "too far from the framework needed...to be able to discuss relativity in depth."215 On the occasion of the seventh centennial anniversary of the University, an international conference on philosophy took place in Naples. An entire session was devoted to relativity with Marcolongo as chairman. February 1924, three months before the congress, he wrote to Levi-Civita:216 Einstein agreed to attend the Conference and to give a lecture on recent advances of his theory; we think that his lecture will be followed by a thorough and high minded discussion to which I will invite all the Italian and foreign scientists (in cluding German ones, needless to say)...Einstein [asked me] to ask you to partici pate in the Conference and the debate! You are the leading expert on relativity in Italy and one of the fathers of the absolute differential calculus; since we feel that such celebrations should also be an opportunity to make Italian science known.... I hope you will accept our invitation. In the event, neither Einstein nor Levi-Civita took part. Marcolongo opened his session with an address entitled "Between relativists and antirelativists." Five years after the 1919 eclipse, and nineteen years after the publication of SR, the battle between supporters and opponents of relativity still raged in Italy.

Gianfranceschi repeated that relativity had to be considered a "working hypoth esis;" Giorgi allowed even-handedly that "relativity has not been disproved by any positive fact...but has not been confirmed either." Francesco Severi, the partisan of La Rosa, also again voiced his opposition. The reviewer of the conference for Nature remarked that it made "a gratifying spectacle to see metaphysicians, logi cians, mathematicians, physicists, and biologists sitting together in the great halls of the University of Naples."217 The debate on relativity in Italy started fading only in the late 1920s. Interest declined because, on the one hand, some of the participants left the stage and, on the other hand, the general interest of physicists moved towards atomic physics. Righi died in 1920 and La Rosa in 1933. Majorana, more and more isolated, per sisted in his deep and lonely anti-relativism up to his death in 1957. By 1927 Corbino could consider relativity a secure part of the edifice of physics, "a comple tion, rather than a revolution, of the basis of classical physics." The truly revolu tionary physics, according to Corbino, was the then new quantum mechanics.218 That did not of course prevent the old opponents from repeating their arguments.219 The generation of young theorists that came of age around 1925 included rela tivity in their work from the beginning of their careers. The more prominent of them were Enrico Fermi and Enrico Persico. Fermi was close to Castelnuovo and Levi-Civita. He took his first steps in theoretical physics in GR, not in quantum physics, via Weyl's Raum, Zeit, Materie (1921). Between 1921 and 1923 he worked out a series of papers concerning theoretical issues in both SR and GR.220 After 1923 and a study trip to Gottingen and Ley den, he devoted himself to atomic and nuclear physics. Enrico Persico started his academic career as an assistant of Levi Civita. He published some papers on relativity in 1922 and 1923 and later aban doned the field.221 Probably Levi-Civita (and Levi-Civita's disciple Giuseppe 217. Nature, 114,12 Jul 1924, 66.

CONCLUDING REMARKS The key to a correct understanding why relativity entered Italy so late is the indifference, or, more precisely, the non-interest that surrounded relativity during the decade 1906-1915. Apart from Levi-Civita's and Righi's discussion of elec tron theories and the electromagnetic worldview between 1906 and 1908, the de bate over what Darrigol called "the electrodynamic roots" of SR simply did not take place in Italy. 223 The essentially experimental character of physics, and the prevailing continuist attitude of mathematical physicists, did not encourage an in terest in the great Lorentzian synthesis between electrodynamics and molecular physics. Minkowski's formulation of SR, a second potential portal for relativity in Italy, gave rise to some debate. However, this promising start did not prompt a continu ing interest. On the contrary, as Israel remarked, the mathematicians did not seem to have realized that SR implied drastic changes in the accepted framework; to include SR into the edifice of science it was enough, according to them "to con ceive [SR] as a derivation of a particular geometry."224 Volterra, who on the con trary did recognize the implication, worked on theories related to the principle of relativity in Poincare's formulation. This made sense: Poincare developed Lorentz' theory and Volterra wanted to include relativity into the mathematical framework of variational calculus. A third potential entry way for relativity is the interest of mathematicians. Castelnuovo, Volterra, Levi-Civita, Somigliana, and Marcolongo did, in their vari ous ways, flirt with relativity, but they did not make it their speciality and did not care to investigate its physical content. The fourth entry, experimental proof of the postulates of SR, did indeed pass serious traffic. Abraham's presence in Italy was a strong stimulus, especially through his challenges to Einstein. The empiricist influence of American physicists like Tolman and Stewart also was significant.

Only theories whose premises could be shown to be true were considered acceptable.225 This view im plied the need to choose between SR and emission theories; the second postulate of SR thus became a focus of interest. The first in Italy to take up the challenge was La Rosa. Except for La Rosa's short and half-hearted effort, nobody worked on SR in Italy before 1915. SR did not intersect ongoing work. Opinions were cautious, generally non-committal, or even skeptical. Physicists did not need SR to carry out their research. Righi's work on magnetic rays is a good example. SR could not help the mathematicians, who studied electromagnetism as elastic properties of an ether or were concerned with absolute differential calculus, like Levi-Civita, or algebraic geometry, like Castelnuovo. There were also scientists who were skeptical on SR or even criticized it only to pursue objectives almost entirely unrelated to it. This is the case of the vectorialists and also of Somigliana, who cultivated electrodynamics as part of his research on the elastic properties of ether. A breakthrough occurred in 1915 with Levi-Civita's engagement with GR. He soon became the spokesman of GR in Italy. In 1919, one year after being called to the University of Rome, he started an active high-level popularization of relativity together with Marcolongo, who in the meantime had taken up the mathematical methods of GR. Levi-Civita's change between SR and GR may easily be explained. A co-founder of the absolute differential calculus, Levi-Civita easily appreciated GR whereas nothing in his previous work drew him to SR. He understood GR as the ultimate step of a logical development of expressing the principles of physics in terms of variational principles.226 The eclipse expeditions of 1919 brought relativity to center stage in Italy as elsewhere. Levi-Civita and Marcolongo began their propaganda campaign. One of the main goals of their lectures was to spread the methods of absolute differential calculus. The astronomers were initially cautious; by 1921 they had become openly hostile. Almost all of them preferred "classical" arguments to explain the bending of light rays or the anomalous advance of Mercury's perihelion. Until the early 1920s Italian astronomers refused to accept the astronomical proofs of GR as deci sive. According to the terminology introduced by Thomas Kuhn, they did not con sider these results as anomalies incompatible with classical physics. On the con trary, they regarded them as puzzles to be solved within the Newtonian paradigm. They proposed modifications to Newton's law or ad hoc distributions of matter to indicate that Einstein's theories could be wrong or at least unnecessary.227 The short tale of the Commission on Relativity of the IAU illustrates the per sistence of the response of Italian astronomers to relativity and its opposition to 225. Goldberg (ref. 2). 226. Brigaglia et al. (ref. 43), 464. 227. Roseveare (ref. 132), chap. 3, 4.</page><page sequence="48">172 MALTESE international opinion. De Sitter and Eddington regarded the experimental confir mations of GR as settled. In Italy almost nobody did. The opposition between these two extremes killed the Commission. Since before 1919 there had been no debate on SR in Italy, the Italian scientific community suddenly had to face com pelling evidence for a theory, GR, that revolutionized classical physics. Because of the immense coverage of the eclipse affair in newspapers, GR became fashion able. Consequently discussion was not profound. Majorana and Righi, who earlier had done theoretical and experimental research on the foundations of SR, inter wove comments on GR with assessments of SR. This did not contribute to clarity. People entirely unfamiliar with the theory of relativity or even science also en tered the debate. Here the harm done by not having the debate on SR ten years earlier became obvious. Having to deal with the triumph of GR, scientists did not have time to clarify and analyze the foundations and motivations of SR. The thesis that, in absence of theoretical physics, mathematicians had to play the role of theoretical physicists, does not explain the history of relativity in Italy. If it did, we could expect physicists to be hostile and mathematicians to be favor able towards relativity. This, however, was not the case. The major factor?it needs repetition?was the absence in Italy of the international debate on the theoretical foundations of electrodynamics. Mathematicians, who wanted to bring electro magnetism back to mechanical models, missed that momentous revolution in phys ics at the beginning of 20th century encapsulated in the "electromagnetic world view." Italian physicists felt comfortable only insofar as they could rely upon ether, Euclidean space, and coordinates bearing an immediate physical meaning. Math ematicians rejected relativity since they favored vectorial formalism in opposition to absolute differential calculus. Around 1900, Italian physics was well behind international physics. This situ ation hampered its response to new discoveries and theories. La Rosa's work on ballistic theory may have been timely in 1912, since the international community then was still debating on Ritz' hypothesis and the existence of the ether had not been settled.228 The same research was far out of date in the period 1923-1927. The hypothesis of gravitational absorption had been seriously investigated before 1912. It had been dropped, however, when Majorana started his investigations. In every country but Germany, relativity theory met a tough and persistent resistence. In Britain, Minkowski's formulation and research on theoretical elec trodynamics played leading parts in blunting opposition.229 In Italy, after initial curiosity, Minkowski's spacetime did not figure further. Also, Italians did not pur sue research on electrodynamics. There was no one like George Augustus Schott, who worked at an electrodynamic theory of atomic phenomena able to account for non-classical phenomena.230 Instead, as we have seen, in Italy, Righi engaged him 228.

A leading scientist eventually took the field for relativity in Italy (Levi-Civita), France (Langevin), and Great Britain (Eddington). Their efforts had different re sults. Eddington proved much more effective than Levi-Civita. However, the de velopment in Italy had much in common with that in France. Lack of a school of theoretical physics, mechanistic tradition, and a leading scientist agitating for rela tivity are among the similarities. Except for Levi-Civita and his school, the generation of scientists including Righi, Volterra, Majorana, La Rosa, and Castelnuovo, never accepted relativity. The next generation found it natural, and even interesting, to investigate relativity in their everyday work. Fermi and Persico, who worked initially under Levi-Civita's guidance and patronage, are the exemplars. A similar effect followed when knowl edge of relativity became necessary to make progress in fields that for a long time had been independent of relativity; for example, Sommerfeld's development of Bohr's theory. The young physicist Antonio Carrelli was one of the first to pick up on this development.231 Eventually relativity became a part of the knowledge of Italian scientists. The process completed itself according to the adage of Max Planck: "A new scientific truth triumphs not because its opponents become convinced and finally see the light, [but] rather, because they eventually die and a new generation is born which is familiar with the new concepts."232 231.
