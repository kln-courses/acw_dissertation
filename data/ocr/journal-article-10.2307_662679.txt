(XII+380 pages, 122 figures in the text. Stuttgart: Ferdinand Enke, 1932.) Weinert's Menschen der Vorzeit (see American Anthropologist, 1931, XXXIII (3), 443-444) has been followed in the current year by a more elaborate and more consummate volume from the same author's pen whose title appears at the head of this review. While the former book is a critical review of the palaeolithic human fossils with perspectives into the ancestral and, on the other hand, more recent phases of Stone Age man, the present volume goes back broadly into the compara- tive anatomical and physico-anthropological fields, ending with chapters on Homo sapiens, fossil and recent. The volume is dedicated to the memory of Ernst Haeckel, whose personality still looms large in the domain of evolutional history. A more appropriate homage could hardly have been paid a savant of Haeckel's stature than by this book, which as a summary of all the material data and those on phenomena in connection with the organic history of mankind, and above all as a critical representation of its chosen subject must be allotted a superior place in the by no means meager output of specific literature of the day. The discussion of the anthropoid system with the inclusion of the fossils as the great phyletic complex from which to draw conclusions, fills the first extensive chapters. The close relationship of man and his anthropomorphic associates is pro- claimed anew, an important and logical assertion in the face of a number of modern heretic views to the contrary. The detachment of Hylobates and Orang-utan from the more concentrated gorilla-chimpanzee-man group of primate association is shown by a number of morphologic evidences. The close relationship of man to the two African forms as seen in the existence there of the frontal sinuses which the Asiatic forms lack, an observation of the author's dating back to 1925, is only one of the many morphological proofs discussed. Other such proofs are recognized in the conditions of the interorbital breadth, os centrale, muscles, aortic arch, the lobes of the lungs, while the physiological serum diagnosis yields rather uniform results within the entire anthropomorphic group (pp. 178, 318, 323). The differentiations which occur in the gorilla-chimpanzee-man group culminating there in the well- known somatic and skeletal primate types in spite of their close relationship, are exhaustively treated in the fifth chapter. The critical review of the various stages of human emergence including the Sinanthropus recovery in its up-to-date entirety, the Eoanthropus problem and the Neandertal and Homo sapiens fossilis phases, leads to the discussion of the final splitting-up of mankind into the present racial array of types and to the renewed assertion of the unity of Homo sapiens stage. The possibility of a genetic relationship between the two representative morphological types of pleistocene man is not directly refuted (p. 261, et seq.; 284) while on the 701</page><page sequence="2">702 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 34, 1932 other hand the development of chimpanzoid into Neandertaloid forms is stressed as an outstanding probability. Of particular interest and value is the last chapter in which human emergence, its locality, time, causes, phylogeny, receive a conclusive summing-up. America as to both of its continents, is to be eliminated with regard to human emergence (p. 333); man is the first catarrhine treading on American soil (p. 331). The discussion of Asia and Africa as human cradle lands brings on another concept, namely the mid- and eastern European possibility, if judged by the chimpanzoid fossils with their closer affinity to man as against the Asiatic ones with their closer relationship with the orang-utan. This morphological conjecture is again stressed on p. 360, when in a final statement the author asserts: There is today still one animal species which through the community of hereditary features connects with no other animal as it does with man. That is the African chimpanzee. Chimpanzee and gorilla as they emerge from the anthropoid groups are indeed recognized as a stem group with a direct human trend of development, so that the author proposes for them, with the inclusion of man, the term "Euanthropoids" or "Summoprimates" (pp. 125, 199, 360). Clearly conceived are also the inter- dependent human functions after the acquisition of the upright gait as they reveal themselves in such sequences as: brain-hand-mouth, and fire-hearth-speech, which although well-known logicalities, receive new and enlightening interpretation. A brief review naturally can give only a general presentation of the gist of a book. The profession will doubtless agree with the reviewer that we here have a work of the first order which will bring authentic information and uniformly sound critical interpretation. It contains a well-prepared table of contents as well as a satisfactory index, and is profusely illustrated. BRUNO OETTEKING</page></plain_text>
