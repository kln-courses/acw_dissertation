<plain_text><page sequence="1">BY HAROLD KAPLAN A he early American republic in its creed was originally blessed by the support of nature, affirmed by both rationalists and idealists, the school of Jefferson as well as that of Emer- son. It is possible to argue that the ethics of intellectual democracy would have had no weight without the En- lightenment's reasoning of natural rights and the inspiration added by Romantic thought, both here and in Europe. Cer- tainly the writers of the American Romantic generation dramatized the reassurance required from nature, and doing so, whether in the serene confidence of Emerson or the Job- like questioning of Melville, they forecast a threat to the democratic faith offered by naturalistic disillusionment in the later years of the nineteenth century. The issue was rather starkly that of freedom itself, in the face of the possibility that in nature's terms, in nature's superior force, human freedom was meaningless. Basically, democracy required the function of idealization to support choice, even to assure the possibility of choice. There- fore the work of Emerson, as Santayana once suggested, was an effort to replace static institutional ideals with the process of idealization itself. The new democracy could not shelter itself under traditional forms or appeal to habit and obedience as the support for ideals. Idealization became naked and ex- posed, the value-making consciousness assumed the central Henry Adams: The Metapolitics of Power . and Order /</page><page sequence="2">528 SOCIAL RESEARCH function in thought. So far as Emerson was concerned, the imagination was always the faculty of freedom, and reality itself was challenged if it seemed to oppose the intuitions of spirit. Nature was a part of spirit and came clothed in the garments of spirit: "The world is a temple whose walls are covered with emblems, pictures, and commandments of the Deity." Emerson could not conceive a reality which did not carry meaning: "We are symbols and we inhabit symbols." And if the world was for some still dark and brutish, that was due to a defect of consciousness: "Since everything in nature answers to a moral power, if any phenomenon remains brute and dark it is because the corresponding faculty in the observer is not active." A power determines events, but it acts through con- sciousness and choice, and can be defined only through con- sciousness and choice. In this way idealization is supreme and the human agents of idealization must understand, like poets, that in this world "the ideal shall be real to thee." They are then properly free and members of a free community. The Break with Idealism This was of course a radical idealism and invited radical contradiction. If it should be decided that everything in nature answered to an amoral power, and that beyond human idealizations nature exhibited "the colorless all-color of atheism," in Melville's phrase, the effect would demonstrate how insecure and even desperate the Emersonian faith was. Such a shift in awareness was treated on the tragic scale by Melville, and remains the source of the great appeal of his work to modern readers. In simplest effect, Captain Ahab expressed a reversal of the Emersonian consciousness. He had come to know nature as violent force, either man-making or man-breaking, and, retaining a romantic sensibility, he had</page><page sequence="3">HENRY ADAMS 529 decided that "its right worship is defiance." The indignity of a life in nature was what afflicted him most, much more than its physical terror, for terror could answer terror and violence meet violence: "I'd strike the sun if it insulted me." Pride seemed to be the only value left in a world of endless war, and for Ahab it became concentrated in a suicidal gesture of de- fiance and courage. Indeed, the power in nature was a bar- baric god who left a strictly limited choice between heroic and ignoble destruction. But that was a warranty or guide for all behavior. If power was the language between man and nature, then Captain Ahab forecast a modern political naturalism in making it the language between men. "He would be democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below," Starbuck observes bitterly. In appreciating the power in the whale, Ahab had come to accept and aggrandize the power within himself. He had created himself in nature's image, reversing what Melville would say of Emerson, that he created nature in the image of a quiet corner of New England. It is the contrast provided by the benign prophet of Con- cord that establishes a special interest not only in the towering symbolic figure of Melville's text but also in modern literary and political naturalism. In the tradition which makes the most striking break with Emersonian idealism, the obsession with nature's power and naturalist process still dominates the imagination. Henry Adams liked to say in his ironic appre- ciations that coal was a divine power, so was electricity, and so, even more significantly, were sex and race. The question he held forth, the one that fixes our attention, is whether we must worship those powers. How many ages it took for ethical spirits and aesthetic graces to preside over the naturalist crises of human experience we don't know, but we can observe a sort of atavism in modern naturalist thought which brings the rawer daimons back, "rough beasts," "slouching toward Bethlehem to be born." Ina view of the American background Henry Adams is the transitional figure, paradigmatic because of his strong mem-</page><page sequence="4">530 SOCIAL RESEARCH ory of being taught by both his sober ancestor, John Adams, and the Emersonian strain of the democratic ideology. But reason and goodwill aside, Adams's great-grandfather prided himself on his realism and even based his constitutional theory of the democratic state on the rivalries of power, as the other American founders did also, indebted as they were to Montes- quieu. The words of John Adams could not be more blunt and even brutal: Power must be opposed to power, force to force, strength to strength, interest to interest, as well as reason to reason, elo- quence to eloquence, and passion to passion. Strangely enough, Henry Adams's concept of power was less tough-minded though more cynical. Representing a man of his time, he wrote like one disillusioned by the facts of power and as if the men of the past (despite the contradiction here quoted from his ancestor) had placed all their confidence in what he, Henry Adams, called "a priori ethical judgements," a confidence now betrayed by the discovered truths of physics, biology, and economics. In the vision of power dominated by late nineteenth-century pessimism, power was ubiquitous, it inhabited many agencies, and it was indifferent to human value judgments, entirely at home with reductive human "interests." Surrounded by the evidence from nature, as for instance the horrible death of his sister from lockjaw, and by the corrupt war of appetency in business and politics of the Grant era, Adams felt himself stripped of an effective moral will and, so he thought, of a relationship with the democratic ethos of his ancestors. In this way Adams was in the best position to express the typical shock effect of naturalist writing, where, as Saul Bel- low's Henderson later expressed it, "truth comes in blows." However, as if he would escape all blows, Adams made an obvious point of avoiding action, whether in politics, business, or even the academy, and thus he assumed his lifetime persona - passive, spectatorial, ironic, and subtly, comprehen-</page><page sequence="5">HENRY ADAMS 531 sively despairing. The manner includes petulance, for, as an Adams, he was trained to participate in power and was deeply attracted to it, as evidenced by his life in Washington and his inability to avoid the social circles of power. Such a man could not remain indifferent to the new world of power realities, no matter his own failure, and he became a fascinated observer at the rites of power, both in natural science and politics. In this he often made the characteristic response of a modern "wounded consciousness," expressing the impact of naturalist truth in terms of an impotent and isolated sensibility, to which he added the punishing bitterness which is so strong a covert motif in naturalist and postnaturalist writing. Adams was also the classic literary naturalist in moving from wounded feelings and nostalgic lament to the virile compen- sations of stoicism, and from that to the oracular teaching of naturalist truths. He seemed to illustrate what Santayana once suggested, that it was impossible for the human mind to con- front "the energy which things embody" without giving it a daimonic or divine existence. He expressed this directly when he said he felt a strong urge to go down on his knees to the Dynamo. Despite ironic hyperbole he meant this, in part, for he indicated the same awe and respect for power when he wrote about his friend John Hay's success in the nationalist and imperialist maneuvers of his time. He made of himself a notorious example of the failure to adapt to the law of conflict and power relationships, but in doing so he only emphasized an ulterior respect for success and a real attraction to the arena of conflict. But Adams had a deeper and more interesting strategy in the naturalist conversion of values. He discovered the Virgin of Chartres, in the first instance as a somewhat sentimental moral contrast with his own age of the Dynamo. But the moral and religious contrast was deceptive; the Virgin's real power was also in nature. She had her origin in a line of sex god- desses and mother divinities, deities of earth and blood, that is to say, life deities, in contrast to the divinity expressed by a</page><page sequence="6">532 SOCIAL RESEARCH mechanical energy. The Virgin, as Adams wished to see her, was the generating force of a large and beautiful civilization. Her energy translated itself directly into ethical and aesthetic values. Chartres, its spires and windows, the rule of love, the chivalry of behavior, the code of religion, all had their support in the purely sexual meaning of the Virgin. Thus what Adams revealed is perhaps the major theme of naturalist culture, the rivalry between mechanist and vitalist power, and the need to seize vitalist power and its symbols as the only alternative to the rule of merely physical energy. Vitalist power, for some of Adams's contemporaries, centered in the creative evolutionary process. Such post-Darwinian affirmations were foreign to Adams's temperament, but still he yearned for a more positive view of history than the laws of thermodynamics could provide. The past had been ruled successfully by the Virgin, even if the future, the ultimate fate of the earth planet itself, was dominated by the bleak concept of entropy. The story told by Adams throughout his life describes the emergence of power-process doctrine in conflict with the tra- ditional ethic of idealizations. But further it reveals the effort to sublimate power realities or convert them to the signs of value. In these respects Adams is a most important figure for cultural study, for his writing illustrates the convergence of a literary and mythmaking temperament with an effort to understand science, and the meeting of both in the explicit or covert creeds of modern politics. The Myth of Power The largest paradox associated with Adams is the fact that an intellect contemplating and subordinating itself to the ac- tion of historic and natural forces became itself a force con- tributing to the most important ideological myth of our time and his. We could call it a popular metaphysics based on presumed scientific revelations, and like all such metaphysical</page><page sequence="7">HENRY ADAMS 533 expressions it suggested a guide for human behavior. But politics and history, drawn from Adams's own experience, were as much the source of his thinking as science, and it is an open question whether they did not influence his view of science even more than Lord Kelvin and the Second Law of Thermodynamics influenced Adams's instruction to the teachers of history. In any case, the multiple interests of Adams's intellectual life - which must include art, architecture, and literature as well as politics, history, and science - were subjected to his profound instinct for intellectual order. The result was that he wrote a legend of history and a legend of science; perhaps it was a gospel, if so steadfast an ironist, a man who almost made disillusionment a basis for action, could be called a gospelmaker. But even disappointment and defeat are services of worship, if the object of worship is power and naturalist fate. To understand what Adams wanted to communicate in his yearning for unity in the midst of multiplicity, one must re- turn to his premises, or theorems, which he loved to recite. His first is this: "Man is a force; so is the sun; so is a math- ematical point, though without dimensions or known exist- ence."1 This has an attractive simplicity appropriate to any myth. If there was a story to tell for the human past and predictions to be made for the future, its theme could be reduced to the movement of a force through space and time. One understood events by using that abstract blend of physics and economics which Adams called his "dynamic theory of history": "A dynamic theory . . . begins by begging the ques- tion; it defines Progress as the development and economy of Forces. Further, it defines force as anything that does, or helps to do work."2 If this is history, then politics, and for that matter ethics, become similarly reductive. The metaphors of physics, which 1 Henry Adams, The Education of Henry Adams, edited by Ernest Samuels (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1973), p. 474. 1 Ibid.</page><page sequence="8">3 Ibid. 534 SOCIAL RESEARCH now condition all of Adams's observations of the human scene, are applied as the metaphors of engineering. The measures of energy and efficiency begin to stand for the measures of value. But Adams, as a nineteenth-century determinist, had no illusion that force, and its measures of energy and efficiency, were things that human agents controlled: Man commonly begs the question again by taking it for granted that he captures the forces. A dynamic theory, assigning attrac- tive forces to opposing bodies in proportion to the law of mass, takes for granted that the forces of nature capture man.3 Force is mass, force is collective, force is historical. The individual is drowned in the species, and the species itself is only a fraction of the sum of forces in nature. There is actually only one way that "the feeble atom or molecule called man" can assert a form of control and that is by identifying with the whole of which he is a part, or by discovering "the movement of the forces [that] control the progress of his mind." What Adams, in a word, implicitly teaches is submission to force, in order to gain the residual power that comes from identifying with a larger collective force. In this he was like other nineteenth-century moralizing naturalists, some of whom chose the force of the nation or the race, believing that the historic movement was in their favor. Others, like the Marx- ists, could identify with a social class and the revolutionary apocalypse, and these were of course the most faithful of all believers in the ultimacy of power and the fatalism of the historic process. The Education has great resonance today because of Adams's prophetic sensitivity to the politics of race, nation, class, and empire and to the apocalyptic motifs of revolution and dec- adence. These are the themes of Adams's naturalistic myth, but beyond them is one more significant than the others. Sub- mission to nature's power takes its most congenial form in</page><page sequence="9">HENRY ADAMS 535 vitalism, which is the sentimental creed of naturalism. Vi- talism, one might say, is the appeal from nature's hostility to its protection, and that, in Adams's mind, led almost inevitably toward nature's goddess, in whatever incarnation, from Venus to Virgin. But such incarnations could perhaps move in the opposite direction, reversing the process of sublimations and seeking the roots of power in the racial force, or the simple conflict of species expressed in national and class conflict. These were the daimons of both biology and history, and the question in Adams's mind, as he said several times, was whether the modern god in the machine, the Dynamo, could do as much to satisfy human emotion and all physical and civilized needs. The Virgin was after all a memory, while power always remained as the essence of what was once called divinity. Therefore in a sense it was an act of worship to strip sentiment from the hard truths of nature in order to re-experience their force. Acts of creation, acts of destruction, are major man- ifestations of power as the god. Adams pretended to delight in his visions of the apocalypse, just as he dwelled on the signs of decay and impotence in himself, his generation, and his civili- zation. For him power always had a positive meaning, with whose brutal specifics he could sometimes identify, as when in passages of his letters he urged the continental empire of the United States during the war with Spain, or preached the "Atlantic system" which would join Western Europe and America. Of all his political friendships, he was proudest of his close relationship with John Hay, the Secretary of State of McKinley and Roosevelt at the time of the most aggressive American ventures in seeking world power. He had his visions of hegemony, though often it was a nightmare with world rule going to the Russians or the Asians. Adams's record of his own mind enforces the well-understood correlation between the historic zenith of imperialism and the dominance of neo- Darwinian naturalist thought throughout the Western world. But Adams at times could identify himself with a bomb-</page><page sequence="10">536 SOCIAL RESEARCH throwing anarchist of the same period, one more sign of his avant-garde naturalism as well as his impulse to shock his establishment friends. It was a mocking expression of his am- bivalence, as well as his real dislike of his contemporary civili- zation, that he called himself repeatedly "a Christian Conser- vative Anarchist." Doing so he says he wants mischief, he will urge destruction. But it is apparent that destruction on a grand scale was not mischief, it was power acting in history; it was not doom but natural process; and although Adams couldn't imagine the long-term results, it was possibly creative. In this view Adams was a political voice of his time, and it remains rather a mystery that he was not more attracted to Marxism than he says, since he seemed to recognize that the future belonged to socialism. But a naturalist who was a reac- tionary in the real meaning of the word, because he could not accept the world of the present nor the future, could express himself in opposition to contemporary trends and still believe that he shared in the historic process and was a part of the actual power in events. In a letter, he urged his English friend, Charles M. Gaskell, to go back to Westminster to serve in the opposition as an alternative to holding power himself: ... at our age it is so easy to oppose. Even here [Washington] I can never resist showing the opposition how to play its hand; but oppositions are always more cowardly, more venal, and more stupid than ministries. . . . Yet what a chance! Not for power, naturally; because power must now rest on a great mass of energy which is stored as so-called property or capital, and which must rule as it can; but for savage, effective attack Tve never seen a time more promising. . . . But all this is of our own time in the fifties. Our society has no longer the energy to oppose. Only socialists can now oppose with effect, and socialism is a strange world to us.4 It is a curiously ambivalent statement but very characteristic. The savagery of attack is in this passage, but it exists without 4 Henry Adams, The Letters of Henry Adams, edited by Worthington C. Ford, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1938), 2: 378.</page><page sequence="11">HENRY ADAMS 537 hope of constructive result. In a sense he has given himself license to be irresponsible in opposition. The language is strong because the enemy is more powerful, and not even human, but a "great mass of energy." And that enemy's enemy is something equally abstract called socialism or the working class. What remains for Adams, living in a strange world and conscious of relative impotence, is to express indignation and enjoy attack, and, doing so, to be free to add whatever venom or embitterment he feels to the process of conflict. Something else, a mass of energy of some kind, will do the actual fighting and conquering. The passage tells us a great deal about symptomatic politics in the age of naturalism. It can be extremist and irresponsible in one mode of expression, passive and defeatist in another, optimistically predestinarían in a third. The tact and consid- eration of those who feel their words can control or qualify political action may be missing in all three variations of the political temperament. The mood of irresponsible opposition here indulged in by Adams can be compared with another kind of verbal violence, the extremism of political evangelists who feel their ideas have historic support, that they are arousing historic energies. These energies sanction them, power will confirm them, and what is said or done on their behalf will be justified not by morality, or logic, or even factual truth, but by future events. The Dream of Order Adams had a vocabulary to illustrate his obsessions; power was one stressed term, education was another, order a third. These were out of the dictionary of naturalist thought, as were success and failure. Adams was led to judge finally that an education was less than nothing if it did not lead to power and shape the expression of energy in life. In effect education was a Darwinian term; it meant adaptation or maladaptation to</page><page sequence="12">538 SOCIAL RESEARCH whatever the actual forces of the world declared themselves to be. So in a lifelong ruefulness he considered the failure of his education, as in this passage: Not a Polish Jew fresh from Warsaw or Cracow - not a furtive Yacoob or Ysaac still reeking of the Ghetto, snarling a weird Yiddish to the officers of the customs - but has a keener instinct, an intenser energy, and a freer hand than he - American of Americans, with Heaven knew how many Puritans and Patriots behind him, and an education that had cost a civil war.5 Adams speaks here as the representative of a vanishing species, as he contemplates the advent of the cruder races which will supplant him. Everything that had trained that son of "Puritans and Patriots," including a bloody civil war, seemed to handicap rather than help him in the competition with a struggling "Ysaac." This was not only an expression of bitterness, though the language is fierce, but a declaration of priorities. Culture must defer to nature, established values bend to new energies in this judgment of the stage reached by his civilization. The real contrast in his mind was with the actual non- Yiddish rulers of the world at that time. An heir of the Adamses marked himself for failure when made to see President Grant come to power. He called Grant an "animal force," which was advantaged by sheer stupidity and the cor- ruption of morals in its push to the top. It is a mistake to overstress the personal grievance in Adams's memoir of fail- ure. The failure was general and a philosophic consideration; it was a failure associated with a dominant class and culture as they were outdistanced by "keener instincts," "intenser en- ergies." Politics was Adams's inheritance and politics was his best teacher, or at least it rivaled science in that respect when he formulated his power theory. Before he could consent to the dominance of the power conflict in history, he had to deal with his original political education, which had taught him a 5 Adams, The Education of Henry Adams, p. 238.</page><page sequence="13">HENRY ADAMS 539 value theory. 'Tor numberless generations," he said, "his pre- decessors had viewed the world chiefly as a thing to be re- formed." As he found in his own life, however, and as he spent the first half of The Education demonstrating, the moral law in politics did not do much more than conceal or ration- alize the actual "forces" which generated events. It was in this sense that he could say that his education had cost him a "civil war," for it was Civil War politics at home and in London that had taught him this bitter lesson, his chief teachers being Palmerston, Gladstone, and Russell while he served as aide to his father in the American embassy. Adams gave seven chapters of The Education to this five-year period of his life, and significantly they precede the chapter in which he discusses the impact of Darwinism on his mind. Maybe it was Darwin and not Gladstone who taught him most, but Gladstone was telling moral lies, and that was what in- terested him most at the time. The gentlemen who ruled England were deviously siding with the Confederacy, and it was a miracle how much their real motives were concealed from themselves and how much they were in fact ethically honorable men: As political education, this lesson was to be crucial; it would decide the law of life. All these gentlemen were superlatively honorable; if one could not believe them, Truth in politics might be ignored as a delusion.6 Adams was able, many years after the event, to read the memoirs of both Gladstone and Russell and see them confess confusion, ineptitude, and self-ignorance. But while Gladstone at the time could hold the sincere delusion that intervention would be an act of friendliness for Americans of both sides, Adams could observe how relentlessly the pressure of British interests pulled them to the side of the Confederacy and how determined were the maneuvers to end the war by splitting 6 Ibid., p. 159.</page><page sequence="14">540 SOCIAL RESEARCH the Union. Only one thing put them to an end, and that was the turn of force in favor of the Union on the battlefield. As a result and in spite of his own conviction that only one side in that war was right, Adams was forced to conclude that "the actual drama [of history] is a pointless puzzle, without even an intrigue."7 However, it was a pointless puzzle only if one made ethical reasoning the basis of one's analysis and prediction. The story was quite simple when described as a power conflict, which was the way Adams came to see it. The more serious conclusion, in its consequences for a man in- terested in politics and a believer in democracy, was put in the form of a question: "Could one afford to trust human nature in politics?" The answer to this was short: "History said not."8 Adams's tormenting of these questions reveals his readiness to be disillusioned, his will to force politics to declare either its moral purity or corruption. It was a search that would not leave the realm of power, nor would it desert the realm of ethics. It was inevitable that he would press hard on terms that made a bridge between power and value, terms like order and unity, which became the attributes of successful civilizations, like that of the thirteenth century. At the very beginning of The Education he pronounced that all education was moral in the primary sense that it was a search for order. Though "Chaos was the law of Nature; Order was the dream of man." And this was finally the way he had to see the problem of ethical value in human behavior, as a dream of order. Order was a term that accommodated itself to power, or finally it was power, translated and transformed by usefulness and mean- ing: From the cradle to grave this problem of running order through chaos, direction through space, discipline through freedom, unity through multiplicity had always been and must always be the task of education, as it is the moral of religion, philosophy, science, art, politics and economy.9 "Ibid., p. 157. »Ibid., p. 150. »Ibid., p. 12.</page><page sequence="15">HENRY ADAMS 541 It is instructive to observe this parallel of freedom with chaos, and the extraction of terms like unity and discipline as "the task of education" as well as the "moral of religion, philosophy," etc. A confirmed naturalist with strong ethical and aesthetic needs had thus come to consider all values under the simple threat of chaos, and in the attention given to power, as well as the straying, conflicting forces which make chaos, had turned to order as the value subordinating all others. The reader of Adams's work understands the force of this inquisition of chaos and order, power and value, in the larger context of nineteenth-century political naturalism. When he states in The Education that he was a Darwinian "for fun," the spectatorial entertainment seems to match his ironic wonder at the antics of the British cabinet during the Civil War. Perhaps he thought that Darwin's principle of natural selection was a kind of dispensation which relieved men like himself from ethical responsibility. If nature was amoral why should men be otherwise? But we know that his amusement in observing Palmerston, Russell, and Gladstone was superficial, or rather a mask over his obviously desperate concern for the Union cause in the bad early days of the war. Similarly, Darwinism and what went with it was anything but "fun" for him. His book becomes much more than a series of intellectual postures of that sort when he is forced to confront the lessons of nature directly with the death of his sister in Italy in the spring of 1870. "The last lesson - the sum and term of education - began then," he wrote in The Education. It was a lesson administered when he was 32, and he must have meant it was the last because it had death's finality and led to the answer to all his questions. "He had never seen Nature - only her surface - the sugar-coating that she shows to youth."10 The passage in which he describes his sister's death is one of the most finely 10 Ibid., p. 287.</page><page sequence="16">542 SOCIAL RESEARCH edged in all his writing. He uses the background of the rich and sensuous Italian spring to add the bitterness of natural paradox to a judgment of life. Of his sister's death he says: "Nature enjoyed it, played with it, the horror added to her charm, she liked the torture, and smothered her victim with caresses." Authentic as Adams's sense of horror surely was, the melodramatic quality of this description of Nature at her work is part of the protest. "Her attitude towards life," he said, "took form then as a phantasm, a nightmare, an insanity of force." For the first time, the stage-scenery of the senses collapsed; the human mind felt itself stripped naked, vibrating in a void of shapeless energies, with resistless mass, colliding, crushing, wasting, and destroying what those same energies had created and labored from eternity to perfect.11 With this we can appreciate Adams's obsession with order. If blind force can have such effect, controlled and well-applied power in human hands could seem godlike, and if education was a paramount matter to pursue through one's life, it was because it held the possibility of wrestling both power and order from nature's "insanity of force." As if his sister's death were to be his sign now, Adams turned from nature to history, and used almost the same language in viewing the public affairs of Europe in that same year of 1870: "Society became fantastic, a vision of pantomime with a mechanical motion; and its so-called thought merged in the mere sense of life. . . ."12 Human affairs could not be given a moral interpretation, not while his sister's death was so violent. The analogy was founded on an older metaphysics, now turned sour and hopeless. We read ourselves in nature, and what it reveals to the mind it teaches to the will. Thus Adams, after his two great educational experiences, the war diplomacy in London and his sister's death in the Italian 11 Ibid., p. 288. 12 Ibid., p. 289.</page><page sequence="17">HENRY ADAMS 543 spring, became himself a teacher as he entered on his career as assistant professor of medieval history at Harvard. What he had learned he would have to teach: "In essence incoherent and immoral, history had either to be taught as such - or falsified." These were bleak alternatives, and as a professional pessimist Adams seemed to gratify himself with them. But his continuing thought and the later development of his own "dynamic theory" tell us rather what deep intellectual taskmasters those extremes of falsehood and incoherence were. Whatever his style of gloom, Adams really expected that determinist history would reveal its secret, just as he waited in science for the endless arrival of newly discovered laws of nature. In this too Adams was a man of his time, ready to offer all his intellectual respect to the oracle of history and accept its governance. The Goddess of Power and Order In stating the goal of an education, Henry Adams said this: "The young man himself, the subject of education, is a certain form of energy; the object to be gained is economy of his force."13 One doubts that young men were intended to recog- nize themselves in that description, and yet the language is more than metaphor or allegory. He was serious in that premise, at least as serious as he was in dealing with the Virgin, herself a divine expression of energy. In the world Adams envisioned, effectiveness was measured by energy and there seemed to be no way to describe or evaluate mental energy. Adams grew up on familiar terms with great men and was not in awe of them, but he was in awe of power. That was what powerful men took from nature, not intelligence or in- spiration. The leaders who were successful, in obvious contrast 13 Ibid., "Preface."</page><page sequence="18">544 SOCIAL RESEARCH with himself, men like Grant and Garibaldi, were "forces of nature, energies of the prime, like the Pteraspls. ..." The fact that they existed "crushed argument and intellect at once."14 This is the ground on which to understand Adams's nostal- gic journey to Chartres, the Middle Ages, and the shrines of the Virgin. She was a force innate in nature, a manifestation of the ageless sex goddess and maternal power which had been recognized by the highest Christian divinity. And so she ruled imperially, the greatest of queens, whose power was supreme because she was able to arouse a faith in proportion to her vitalist force and truth. That the Virgin was a goddess of nature Adams makes unmistakably clear, but that was only the basis. He dealt frankly with sublimations, and "love is law," he said, by which he meant that it led to the ordering of life. The religious inspiration itself seemed finally to him an in- strument of high politics. It wasn't a personal union with God that he longed for, but the harmony of a civilization that matched the Romans or the medieval Normans. For the latter the love that was power, Venus in her most artful disguise as Virgin and mother, became law. Nature herself dismissed chaos for order. Explicitly Adams wanted to say that the Virgin was the greatest political force that had ever appeared on earth. She did not exist only as a supplementary source of tenderness, or mercy, alongside the omnipotence of the Son and Father. She ruled and did not just counsel rule, and she exacted prompt and willing obedience from king and bishop. She protected her friends and punished her enemies, proving her authority real and not simply the force of the internal religious con- science. She was indeed Roman and carried no aura of the manger or the worship of shepherds on the Judaean hills. Adams was impressed by the fact that her authority arose from her recognition by the Empress Helene, the mother of Constantine, as the result of her pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 14 Ibid., p. 265.</page><page sequence="19">HENRY ADAMS 545 326. In other words, the Virgin's monarchal descent was clear, she was genuinely of the Roman Empire and expressed the principle of empire: She was not a Western, feudal queen, nor was her Son a feudal king; she typified an authority which the people wanted, and the fiefs feared; the Pax Romana; the omnipotence of God in government. In all Europe, at that time, there was no power able to enforce justice or to maintain order, and no symbol of such a power except Christ and his Mother and the Imperial Crown.15 In all this play of the anthropomorphic imagination one must remember that the Virgin's actual rival in Adams's mind was not of course Grant or Gladstone or Garibaldi but the future god, the Dynamo. What could shape a rival "thought of infinite energy" better than Mary's cathedrals? Felt as infinite energy, the god in the coalpit had as much legitimacy as the goddess in the statuary and rose windows of Chartres. But the Virgin had many more ways to mirror life and express energy. Her rule was seated in life, something the scientific mind still faced as a secret: The scientific mind is atrophied, and suffers under inherited cerebral weakness, when it comes in contact with the eternal woman - Astarte, Isis, Demeter, Aphrodite, and the last and greatest deity of all, the Virgin. . . . The study of Our Lady, as shown by the art of Chartres, leads directly back to Eve, and lays bare the whole subject of sex.16 This then was the great discovery by which Adams could leave science behind, as if its own discoveries were too slow for him, and declare how nature was perhaps not the scene of present chaos or future entropie death (both visions he en- tertained vividly in his mind) but possibly the source of order and rule, not superimposed but innate, as natural as the force 15 Henry Adams, Mont St. Michel and Chartres (New York: Doubleday 1959) pp 79-80. ^Ibid., p. 79.</page><page sequence="20">546 SOCIAL RESEARCH of the woman and Queen. Whatever Adams had to say about medieval moral harmony, or the beauty of the rose windows and the cathedrals, or the mercy by which the Queen ruled, in the end he returned to an image of her unlimited power. He describes the Virgin as seen in the outer panel of glass in the sanctuary at Chartres: .... [In] the act of seating herself, we should see her pause a moment to look down with love and sympathy on us - her people - who pack the enormous hall, and throng far out be- yond the open portals; while, an instant later, she glances up to see that her great lords, spiritual and temporal, the advisers of her judgement, the supports of her authority, the agents of her will, shall be in place; robed, mitred, armed; bearing the sym- bols of her authority and their office; on horseback, lance in hand; all of them ready at a sign to carry out a sentence of judgement or an errand of mercy; to touch with the sceptre or to strike with the sword; and never err.17 This perfection of authority was ultimately what Adams wanted from imaginative belief, "everything in its place and the agents of her will." And he wanted it to be made legitimate by the authority of nature, to be accepted as part of naturalist truth. The vision is a reconciliation of value and power, with the words love, sympathy, and mercy fused with sentence, strike, and authority. It was a need to make power sympathetic in the image of the Divine Mother, but an equally strong need to believe she could "never err." Even the spirit of unreason, even the transgressor acknowledged her power, he said. How much wider could omnipotence be stretched? And since Adams was never in the least a mystic, nor even religious in basic belief, it suggests his deep need to conciliate the power in nature and submit to it. Power and Value On this level the fear of chaos which impressed Adams's mind had metaphysical implications, but the dominant preoc- 17 Ibid., p. 198.</page><page sequence="21">HENRY ADAMS 547 cupation was political, just as he himself arose from a culture whose dominant theme was political. It seems to have been the fate of the Adamses to act as the questioners of the democratic faith, to be most alert to its intellectual and historic vulnerabil- ity, even to the point of the defeatism expressed by Henry and Brooks Adams, the last of their line. Far from being the eccentric and tired progeny of a rich tradition, as it was once thought, it seems clearer today that their minds express the nineteenth-century battleground for the survival of the liberal philosophy, and that Adams's thinking in particular describes a turning point in the cultural and intellectual history of democracy. Post-Darwinian biology and modern physics taught him the abstractions of power and species. In that vein he was forced to think of the "animal," "not a concept," which ruled history, whether in the form of sex, or race, or nation, or class, or party. Biology and physics also taught conflict, raised to a determinant principle of the life process, and entropy, which dissolved every process into deathlike stasis. These terms threatened anarchy in life and politics, and so Adams was bent on forcing science to yield abstractions for energy that supported unity and not multiplicity, order and not chaos. The trouble with democracy, for instance, was that it was like an unfinished scientific experiment in a field of energy. It revealed power, all right, but where was its unity, its system of law? In the state, there were aggregations of energy called party, class, group, or simply individuals of great force, like Roosevelt, an example better than Grant of what he called the animal force of leaders. But these quanta of energy could not make their own law or will their unity into being. Perhaps in the time of his ancestors, by a fiction of the a priori moral imagination they could, but now these units were fragments of energy, drifting and colliding, and desperately in need of an ordering principle of energy, like gravity or radiation, by which they could cohere. The democracy which Adams studied all his life with ambiv- alent reactions was precisely what he called multiplistic, and</page><page sequence="22">548 SOCIAL RESEARCH this term carne to mean decadence and the entropie loss of cultural energy to him. If the effort of science and religion was to bridge multiplicity, then the effort of democratic poli- tics was wrong and moved in the opposite direction, or so it would seem to Adams, who had little temperamental sym- pathy for compromise or the crude forms of conciliation in democratic politics. It was also true that Adams had little of the actual temperament of the scientist. Thus Adams would describe a despair that most scientists don't feel when he saw them report a world of phenomena that seemed to disappear into chaos, without a unifying law or coherent relationship. Science gave no assurance, but science had raised the threat to the liberal philosophy which Adams's life and work so clearly illustrate. The monolithic and reductive language of power had led to a moral crisis. It was evident that Adams could not bring together or synthesize power and value, power and justice, power and liberty. Neither did he know a way that they could exist apart. The inevitable tendency of what I have called naturalist politics (and Adams was one of the first to expound that form of a metapolitics) was to make power generate its own order, to prove it in an arrangement of forces, or in the historic direction of their conflict even if those forces were not so congenial as the maternal and sexual at- traction of the Virgin. The racial politics and the economic class politics of his time and ours were keenly understood by Adams, and indeed prophesied with ominous clarity. The naturalist bias in political thought must be understood in this context. Power was the name for what happened in history, for the often mysterious effective causes of events. Value was the name for the language men used to mask their power, or it was the name for their disappointments, or at best the name for their dreams. That melancholy conclusion dominates the pages of The Education and Adams's letters. But more significantly, as he said himself, there was comfort in deserting a priori idealizations for stoic posteriori affirmations. That is to say, it was futile to try to run ahead of history, but</page><page sequence="23">HENRY ADAMS 549 one might catch up from behind. In effect one comes to terms with real causes, real power. Empire and world order, an implicit doctrine of race, a vitalist metaphysics of sex, these finally were Adams's beliefs, graced by historic illustration in the sovereignty of the Virgin, who inspired religion and art, law and the state, war and peace. The alternatives to her rule, or the rule of such as she, were entropie decadence, disorder, the apocalypse, chaos. His ancestor, John Adams, could believe in a contest of powers, absolute authority given to none, but the faculty of conscience and judgment applied to all. If this was the demo- cratic ideology to John Adams, to Henry's view it had its base in the natural conflict of rival forces, and pointed only to destruction, dissolution, or the triumph of the strongest force. A very dark prospect, but it figured the dilemma of naturalist thinking in a democratic culture. But as the social sensibility remained alive in Adams, it turned from freedom to an idealization of unity and the miraculous instance where power and value were at one with each other. He could imagine such a totalitarian fusion in the thirteenth century because the power of the Virgin, maternal and sexual, was one that man- ifested its legitimacy of both force and right. Or else he could kneel to the Dynamo in the twentieth century, where power looked raw and savage behind its merely technological appa- ratus of control. Without the Virgin and her secret of sex, it was impossible for a naturalist to know where values came from. Therefore he faced the Virgin and the Dynamo and in effect said, "One of you must rule us." His preference was obvious, and in making it he symbolizes, for several intellectual generations, a legacy of choices among the cults of vitalist power which have deeply affected the art and literature, the revisionist religions, and the naturalist politics of the twentieth century.</page></plain_text>
