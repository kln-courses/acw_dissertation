When he died in 1980, Marcel Breuer left a remarkable legacy as one of the foremost designers of the twentieth century. The iconic Club Armchair - the first tubular-steel chair - invented by Breuer at the Bauhaus in 1925 revolution- ized furniture design and was one of his many prodigious achievements. The first comprehensive study of Breuer's career as a designer was Christopher Wilk's Marcel Breuer: Furniture and Interiors, which appeared in conjunction with the Breuer retrospective organized by the Museum of Modern Art in 1980. Wilk provided a historical account of Breuer's career, situating his furniture and interiors in relation to Modernist discourse. He also established a thorough chronology of Breuer's designs and clarified production information. Wilk did not provide a comparative analysis of Breuer's designs for furnishings and interiors with the work of his contemporaries; therefore the reader was unable to comprehend fully Breuer's contribution within a broader context. The greatest limitation of Wilk's book was its restriction to black-and-white photographs, which perpetuated the myth that Breuer's furniture, particularly his tubular-steel designs, was cold, antiseptic, and devoid of color. A significant attempt at rectifying this misconception has been made with the publication of Marcel Breuer Design, here under review, the catalogue that accompanied the exhibition of the same name at the Bauhaus Archiv in the spring of 1992. The exhibition "Marcel Breuer Design" was organized by Magdalena Droste, of the Bauhaus Archiv, and Manfred Ludewig, a collector in Berlin, to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Breuer's birth. A selection of fifty-eight works spanning the decade 1920 to 1950 was assembled for the show from public and private collections in Europe and the United States, revealing the thirty most prolific and influential years of Breuer's career. As with many exhibitions from the Bauhaus Archiv, this important show regrettably did not travel. The catalogue is accessible to a broad audience, however, and it is particularly valuable for non-German-speaking readers because the text is provided in both English and French translations. It is to be hoped that in the future all major Bauhaus Archiv publications will be multilingual. Marcel Breuer Design is a joint publication of the Bauhaus Archiv and Benedikt Taschen Verlag in Berlin. This volume features an essay by Magdalena Droste on Breuer's furniture and includes a chronology of Breuer's career, a bibliography, and an exhibition checklist with brief descrip- tions of the production of certain pieces. The primary contribu- tion of this catalogue, however, lies in its three sections of incomparable illustrations. Like other Benedikt Taschen publi- cations, Marcel Breuer Design gives the initial impression of being a picture book. But this photographic compendium offers the reader far more than an assemblage of attractive illustra- tions. The book provides an unprecedented opportunity to study and compare an outstanding selection of Breuer's works. The numerous color plates afford both the scholar and the amateur a better understanding of Breuer's designs, particularly through the striking new color photographs of the fifty-eight objects in the exhibition, which capture the essence of Breuer's palette and reveal the subtle structural details that characterize his oeuvre. Moreover, different production models of the same design are juxtaposed in many cases, allowing comparisons to be made between period pieces and contemporary examples. The three illustration sections - "Years at the Bauhaus 1920-1928," "Berlin, Switzerland 1928-1934," and "England, USA 1935-1950" - present both celebrated and lesser-known works. Among the surprises in the first section is the diversity of Breuer's case pieces - exhibition vitrines, bookcases, and cabinets - revealing his adept manipulation of a limited design vocabulary based on geometric forms, primary colors, and three constituent materials: wood, glass, and metal. Private and public commissions for furnishings that Breuer received during his tenure at the Bauhaus are also represented. Among them are designs for the apartment of the Hamburg art collector Thost, the Vogeler apartment in Berlin, and the Erwin Piscator apartment, Breuer's most important private commission of the Bauhaus years. Four pages of illustrations devoted to the Piscator apartment combine period images by the theater photographer Sasha Stone with new photographs of individual furniture designs. One evocative image by Stone from 1927 shows Hildegard Piscator seated before her Breuer-designed dressing table, and on the opposite page an example of the same dressing table produced in 1925-1926 is illustrated. Breuer's mastery at designing tubular metal furniture is conveyed through seventeen color plates contained in the second section, covering the period 1928 to 1934. This was a time of tremendous innovation for Breuer. When he moved to Switzerland in 1933, he began to experiment with aluminum, eventually introducing the Plia Aluminum line, which was manufactured by Embru and distributed by the Wohnbedarf home-furnishings stores of Zurich, a company founded by Studies in the Decorative Arts/Fall 1993 127</page><page sequence="2">128 Studies in the Decorative Arts /Fall 1993 Siegfried Giedion in 1933. Dramatic views of the Wohnbedarf interiors illustrate the earliest commercial presentation of Breuer's furniture, displayed beside designs by Alvar Aalto and Le Corbusier, Charlotte Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret. Breuer's plywood furniture designed for Isokon is featured in the final section, spanning the years 1935 to 1950. The Isokon line, which he introduced in 1935, was composed of a Lounge Chair, an Armchair, and Nesting Tables, all of which are illustrated in the catalogue in frontal and profile views, accentuating the elegant contours that Breuer achieved with laminated plywood. The highlight of the last section is a four-page layout devoted to the Model House that Breuer designed in 1949 for the Museum of Modern Art in New York and furnished in collaboration with Eero Saarinen. The illustrations also yield a contextual reading of Breu- er's furniture through the abundant use of auxiliary photo- graphs, including many previously unpublished views of Breuer interiors and advertisements of his designs. An unfortunate deficiency of this presentation is its exclusive concentration on Breuer's furniture and interiors, and like the study by Chris- topher Wilk there are few comparisons made between Breuer's work and contemporary manifestations of Modern design. A more in-depth cross-cultural visual analysis would have re- vealed the different approaches to design among the leading exponents of the Modern Movement. Without the explanatory text, the photographic sections are at times confusing and it can be difficult to find the proper caption for the different images laid out on each page. Nevertheless, the reader should not be deterred by this inconvenience, for it does not detract substantially from the catalogue's strength as a visual resource. Magdalena Droste's essay "Marcel Breuer's Furniture" is a more inclusive investigation than its title implies. Droste is in the forefront of Bauhaus scholarship, and her revisionist history of the Bauhaus (Bauhaus 1919-1933, Berlin, 1984), and catalogues on the work of Hannes Meyer (Hannes Meyer 18894954 Architekt, Berlin, 1989), director of the Bauhaus from 1928 to 1930, and Gunta Stöltzl (Gunta Stöltzl Weberei am Bauhaus und aus eigener Werkstatt, Berlin, 1984), a student at the Bauhaus from 1919 to 1925 and then head of the Bauhaus weaving workshop from 1927 to 1931, were illuminat- ing studies. "Marcel Breuer's Furniture" both expands on a number of historical issues introduced by Christopher Wilk and pursues new areas of investigation. Decorative-arts histori- ans will be interested in Droste's examination of the reception of Breuer's furniture and contemporary criticism leveled against the art /function polarity felt to be inherent in many of his designs. Droste also relates Breuer's career to the changing political and economic climate in Germany between the World Wars and to the Nazis' perception of Modern design as having contributed to the cultural degeneration of their nation. Unfortunately Droste's text is too short and important ideas are introduced that are not fully examined. Droste's essay begins by addressing the attacks against Breuer's furniture designs of the 1920s for being too formalist and uncomfortable. In the 1925 article "Die Kunst ist in Gefahr" (Art Is in Danger), the artist and social critic George Grosz criticized Breuer's 1923 Wood-slat Chair for being uncomfortable and presenting itself as a work of art. Grosz proclaims that "one would rather sit on a chair manufactured by anonymous joiners because it is more comfortable than one produced by a Bauhaus designer wallowing in technical romanticism" (Droste, p. 6). His comments imply that social and technological imperatives were diluted by unwarranted formal concerns. Another contemporary observer cited by Droste also lamented the fact that artistic intentions informed the design of Breuer's Wood-slat Chair. The critic complained that Breuer's chair "is also an artistic creation, and the point is absolutely not because it can't look any different for technical reasons. It looks as it does because that's how the artist wants it to look, and because the artist's stylistic vision is one of inconsiderate functionality and the strictest simplicity" (Droste, p. 7). As Droste explains, the Bauhaus countered by promoting the notion of functionalism, a widely misinterpreted term, originally intended to articulate the economic and comfort derivations of design. In an advertising slogan for the Wood- slat chair, it was described as "the easy chair, designed entirely in terms of its functions, its purpose. It could take no other form" (Droste, p. 6). László Moholy-Nagy, who came to teach at the Bauhaus in 1923, emphasized the chair's economy, "this chair is much cheaper and lighter than the English club armchair, but performs equally well in practice" (Droste, p. 7). Criticism of Breuer's furniture design was but one example of the many attacks by different members of the progressive artistic community in Germany upon Bauhaus formalism, and, increasingly, the relationship between design and technology was more rigorously encouraged in the Bauhaus curriculum. Nevertheless within the functionalist mandate a schism exists between theory and practice. Breuer's fledgling years were spent immersed in the Bauhaus curriculum, which combined theoretical courses offered by leading exponents of modern art, including Moholy- Nagy and Wassily Kandinsky, with technical training in craft production. By the time Breuer earned his journeyman's license in 1924, the Bauhaus had altered its philosophical posture, diminishing the importance of craft in favor of design for industry. Droste explains that Breuer, unlike other Bauhaus- lers, rarely took a theoretical stand with regard to the school's orientation and tried to distance himself from the ideological polemics that prevailed at the Bauhaus during the Weimar years. Breuer's reluctance to become involved in theoretical</page><page sequence="3">discourse likely inspired his departure for Paris in the fall of 1924, where he remained through March 1925. Relatively little is known about his stay in Paris, and Droste attempts to shed light on his tenure there by citing excerpts from Breuer's letters to Erich Dieckmann. Breuer described himself as a "silent observer" who despised the frivolity of Parisian life. Although revelatory of his disdainful attitude toward Parisian culture, Breuer's comments contribute little to our understanding of how his Parisian experience advanced his development as a designer. It would be useful to know whom Breuer might have met there and if he had contact with leading members of the Parisian avant-garde, particularly Le Corbusier, whose position as a major exponent of the Modern Movement was by that time undisputed. In 1925, at the request of Walter Gropius, Breuer returned to the Bauhaus, by this time at its second location in Dessau, to head the furniture workshop. From 1925 until its closing under pressure from the Nazis in 1933, the Bauhaus was devoted to fostering industrial design. Breuer's tubular steel Club Armchair was the embodiment of this pursuit and the primary signifier of Bauhaus Modernism. One of the more insightful aspects of Droste's discussion of Breuer's work in tubular metal is made with respect to the differences between the three principal German and Swiss designers of metal furniture during the 1920s: Breuer, Mart Stam, and Mies van der Rohe. Droste considers each of their contributions to metal furniture design and the social and economic values that distinguished their work: Marcel Breuer may nevertheless be seen as the inventor of the modern tubular-steel chair which took the domestic interior by storm. Mart Stam takes the credit for designing the first cantilever chair, while Mies van der Rohe was the first to exploit the pliant properties of Mannesmann steel tubing in his "Weissenhof ' chair. The same three names simultaneously denote the three main camps in the field of tubular-steel furniture design. Stam's chair, in its frugal simplicity, belongs to the sphere of the working-class apartment. The more expensive chair designed by Mies van der Rohe is destined for the spacious homes of wealthy aesthetes. Breuer's chairs, on the other hand, marry utility and beauty with equal success regardless of their environ- ment (p. 18). Unfortunately Droste confines her analysis to designers of Saxon origin, for a cross-cultural comparison between the German and French inventions in tubular metal furniture exemplified by the highly influential work of Le Corbusier, Charlotte Perriand, and Pierre Jeanneret would have been useful in articulating the schism that existed between Modern- ist dogma and the economic realities of furniture production. Book Reviews 129 In 1928 Breuer left the Bauhaus to pursue a career as an independent architect in Berlin. During this vital period he introduced a diverse vocabulary of metal furnishings that redefined the notion of modern furniture design. Yet Breuer's interests ultimately extended beyond furniture to the creation of a Modernist gesamtkunstwerk in which furniture design was integral to a broader conception of interior design and architec- ture. Droste examines the public and private commissions Breuer received during the late 1920s and early 1930s, and she explains that with the decaying political and economic situa- tion in Germany and the eventual rise of Nazism, Breuer experienced considerable difficulty maintaining an architec- tural office. In 193 1 he closed his office in Berlin and embarked on a car trip through southern Europe and North Africa. The author investigates this period of Breuer's career in light of the hostility toward modern design promulgated by the National Socialists, explaining that Breuer's Hungarian-Jewish origins made him "unacceptable to the new regime." Breuer's personal reaction toward the political climate is revealed in his letters to Ise Gropius. "There is a fog over everything," Breuer noted, "the next war, the ruling idiocy, the internal poisoning caused by ideas stifled before their time" (p. 26). Breuer expressed further concern about the political climate in Germany when he wrote to Ise Gropius, "My business with chairs is stagnating, no commissions for a long time now, all very worrying, and I thought things were going to carry on the same way" (p. 26). In 1935 Gustav Hassenflug, Breuer's former colleague, attacked his metal furniture as an example of "the decline of the home culture." (As is well known, this position was taken to an extreme by the Nazis when they portrayed Modernism as a "Jewish world conspiracy.") The worsening political climate had already forced Breuer to seek commissions outside Germany, and in 1933 he had accepted Siegfried Giedion's invitation to collaborate on the Doldertal houses, an experimental apartment block in Zurich. Breuer's success in Switzerland derived from his affiliation with the Swiss Modern Movement, but even in the neutral country progressive design was also increasingly under attack, and as the artistic atmosphere became more conservative, Breuer began to consider alternative situations. In 1935 he joined his former colleague Walter Gropius in England. The most fruitful aspect of Breuer's tenure there was his creation of a line of plywood furniture for the Isokon company. Droste examines this line with respect to designs by Breuer's contemporary, the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, who introduced the first resil- ient plywood armchair in 1933, and to the subsequent exploita- tion of plywood by the American designer Charles Eames. The author identifies the Isokon Chaise-longue as a precursor of the anthropomorphic lines and organic forms evident in the furniture that Charles Eames produced in the 1940s.</page><page sequence="4">130 Studies in the Decorative Arts /Fall 1 993 As was the case for many of his former Bauhaus associates, the impending World War in Europe eventually forced Breuer to leave Europe, and in 1938 he followed Gropius to the United States and accepted a position at Harvard University. Despite the fame that Breuer received as an independent architect after the Second World War, his name remained inextricably linked to the Bauhaus and to his tubular steel designs of the late 1920s. Droste argues that Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen, who represented the next generation of furniture designers, pursued the course introduced by Breuer in their exploration of new materials to achieve innovative furniture designs. Droste's discussion concludes with an analysis of the reception of Breuer's furniture from the postwar years through the 1970s, but this investigation is also too limited. Following the Second World War Breuer's tubular steel furniture was both revered and admonished. In Droste's essay an illustration of Alessandro Mendini's chair of 1978 titled "Redesign Marcel Breuer" introduces this idea, but no discussion of this issue is offered in the text. Mendini's "Redesign Marcel Breuer" grafts an irregularly shaped, multicolored swatch of color onto the tubular-steel frame of Breuer's Club Armchair, thereby assert- ing the legitimacy of rich surface embellishment while condon- ing the restrictive form language that underscores Modern furniture design. As a Post-Modern parody Mendini challenges Modernism orthodoxy with its pejorative interpretation of decoration. The embrace of multifarious approaches to design and the legitimization of diverse paths of iniquity in solving design problems are among the substantial contributions of Post-Modern criticism. It should be asked what happens to Modern objects when they are devoid of their original content. Is the term "classic" to describe Breuer's furniture a misnomer? During the 1960s Breuer's tubular steel furniture experienced an unprecedented level of popularization and numerous repro- ductions were made, most of which differed from Breuer's original design and production specifications. Regrettably, Droste provides only a superficial reading of the postwar marketing implications of Breuer's furniture, and she makes no attempt to situate his work within Post-Modern discourse. Since the introduction of Breuer's tubular steel furniture, relatively few consumers have been interested in the relation- ship between furniture, interiors, and architecture so crucial to the leading exponents of Modernism, and the increasing commercialization of Breuer's furniture has separated his designs from their original intention as part of a Modernist gesamtkunstwerL· Marcel Breuer Design is a welcome addition to Breuer scholarship, but it is by no means the final word on one of the preeminent designers of the twentieth century. A more exten- sive examination of Breuer's work as it relates both to the international field of Modern design and to consumer culture is still needed.
