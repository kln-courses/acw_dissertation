<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Postclassic, extends from A.D. 770 to 1200, an un- manageably long time, and it is never stated how the beginning and ending dates were determined. Miller assigns a painted diving jaguar" (Plates 44, 45) in Xelha Structure A to this early catch-all period (p. 51), while the latest painting in the sequence, also from Structure A, is described as early Colonial (Plates 46, 47). The latter is, according to Miller, on stucco layer no. 26 (out of 27), whereas the diving jaguar is on another wall on layer no. 7 (p. 56). Although he describes Struc- ture A architecturally as "typical Late Postclassic," the inner room with the paintings may actually represent an earlier phase of construction (p. 43, footnote 18). The painting that exemplifies the earliest period is in Structure 12 at Tancah (Plates 6, 7). This large al- legorical scene features four blue anthropomorphic beings, of which three wield axes and have long-nose heads; these figures converge on a seated personifica- tion of corn. Several ceramic vessels depicted in this scene correspond to types found in the fill of Structure 44-1st (p. 110) which, on the basis of its mural, Miller would date at A.D. 1350 (p. 54) and Ball as eleventh century (p. 110). Miller and Fettweiss both note some stylistic simi- larities between the painting in Tancah Structure 12 and those in the earlier part of Structure 1 at Tulum. On this basis Miller assigns Tulum Structure 1-sub to his earliest period, before A.D. 1200. However, Sand- ers's extensive testpitting established Tulum as a sin- gle-component site, occupied for approximately two centuries before the Conquest (1960, p. 188). While Structure 1-sub might date from the thirteenth century it is unlikely to be earlier. Next in the sequence are the paintings in Structure 44 at Tancah that closely resem- ble two in the Codex Madrid, dated A.D. 1350, in the Middle Postclassic. The final style, after A.D. 1400, found in Structures 5 and 16 at Tulum, was brought by an outside group that Miller identifies as "Putun- Nahua" (p. 74) who carried Mixtec style and ico- nography. Chapter IV postulates a series of entradas on the coast, and the continuous possibility of piratical raids, symbolized by the axe-wielding Chacs in the Structure 12 painting, who may be understood as the warrior- merchants whose presence and absence characterized the episodic history of the region. This chapter closes with a valuable ethnohistoric summary of the Colonial period, partly written by Nancy M. Farris. The final chapter returns to the murals and to what Miller calls the iconology of Tancah-Tulum; by this he means their "intrinsic meaning" or their "cultural im- plications," as opposed to their iconography, which would refer to an analysis of the apparent symbolic program. While numerous references are made to the iconography, the visible content of the paintings is nev- er systematically described, so it is not always possible to understand how Miller perceives them, and to follow his argument. At the end he expands on the themes of rebirth, as symbolized by Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan, Ve- nus, and Sun imagery. These are convincingly present in the Cenote at Tancah where Ahau and Lamat glyphs are carved in the rockface (Figures 118-20). The Ixchel (female goddess) birth symbolism of Cozumel is also related to what Miller interprets as umbilical cord im- agery in the murals. This book presents a wealth of information and hy- potheses to consider. Even when one does not accept all of the author's arguments it is possible to reconsider the evidence available in the appendices, and in the numerous fine illustrations which include copies of the murals by Kees Grootenboer and Felipe Davalos. Air Photo Interpretation for Archaeologists. D. R. WIL- SON. St. Martin's Press, New York, 1982. 212 pp., illus., biblio., glossary, index. $29.95 (cloth). Reviewed by James I. Ebert, University of New Mexico. At first glance, American archaeologists examining D. R. Wilson's book may be tempted to dismiss it as irrelevant, and feel that it might more aptly have been titled "Air Photo Interpretation for the English Ar- chaeologist." Skimming through its pages, one is con- fronted with a bewildering array of spectacular pho- tographs of henges, causewayed enclosures, long, round and square barrows, Roman military fortlets and villas, and cursuses. While obviously oriented toward the En- glish archaeologist, the book, however, deserves more than cursory attention here in the United States as well. First, on a superficial level, it contains more than one hundred superb aerial photographs of the sorts of ar- chaeological remains that must be seen from the air to be appreciated: the graceful, curving walls of Iron-Age hillforts, complex palimpsest patterns of Medieval field furrows and boundaries, and huge Bronze Age round- barrow cemeteries. More importantly, though, the vol- ume has a number of lessons to teach American ar- chaeologists-not all of which were probably envi- sioned by the author. David R. Wilson is Chief Curator of the University of Cambridge's Committee for Aerial Photography, an organization responsible for much of the impetus be- hind the meticulous and systematic work that char- acterizes British "aerial archaeology." As such, he is in an ideal position to bring years of practical experi- ence to bear on an exhaustive discussion of some of the ways that aerial photographs can aid the archae- ologist in discovering, interpreting, and conserving pre- historic and historic sites. Particularly useful is the fact that Wilson devotes nearly as much space to enumer- ating and illustrating natural and recent cultural phe- nomena that might be mistaken for archaeological re- mains as he does on the interpretation of actual sites. His discussion of the agencies responsible for the vis- ibility of archaeological remains from the air-shadow, crop and soil marks for the most part-is the most complete available in the literature of aerial archae- ology, and each assertion he makes is illustrated with appropriate as well as intriguing aerial photographs. Unlike many British and European aerial archaeolo- gists, Wilson emphasizes that conclusions made on the basis of aerial photointerpretation must be field-checked on the ground, and that the questions of what one sees in an aerial photograph and what it means should be explicitly separated in the archaeologist's mind. While compellingly illustrating that aerial photographs and 208 [Vol. 49, No. 1, 1984]</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND BOOK ABSTRACTS the data they contain have the potential of being valu- able adjuncts to archaeological illustration, research, excavation, fieldwork, and conservation, Wilson also incorporates practical instructions for "doing it one- self." The use of magnification and stereoscopy for interpretation, finding existing aerial photographs in government archives, determining optimum film emulsions and flying times, making maps from oblique aerial photographs, drafting, and filing systems for pho- tographs are all covered adequately and concisely. There is an extensive glossary dealing not only with photoin- terpretation terms but also all of those strange site types and names, and the bibliography is excellent although difficult to read since it is set in microscopic print. All of these lessons were intended by the author, and all are well taught. Perhaps even more importantly, however, this book carries another less intentional message across the At- lantic, and that is that British (and European) aerial applications to archaeology, and archaeology in gen- eral, are much different from those in the United States. A common conception among many archaeologists is that the use of aerial photographs was invented and developed by the English and Europeans, and that these methods simply have been transplanted to the United States in recent years and renamed "remote sensing." In actual fact, archaeologists on both sides of the At- lantic began using aerial photographs at about the same time, and the subdisciplines of "aerial archaeology" there and "cultural resources remote sensing" here have evolved more or less separately since. As is graphically suggested by the subjects of the photographs in Air Photo Interpretation for Archaeologists, this is partly due to the very different sorts of cultural resources in the New versus the Old World; most archaeological sites in North America simply cannot be seen on any aerial photograph, and some are difficult to see even from the ground. Even more responsible for our dif- ferences, however, is the fact that many of the goals of British and American archaeology are at great variance. The archaeology that has given birth to British aerial archaeology is directed toward the recognition and con- servation of monuments as the products of different "cultures," an ethnically-centered approach typical of European archaeology in general. American archae- ology, on the other hand, is far more concerned with the interaction between past peoples and their envi- ronment, an orientation encouraged by our implicit diffusionist, culture-area paradigm. Aerial photographs and other remote sensor data sources provide an ex- cellent means of measuring natural resource distribu- tions and other characteristics of the landscape, and this is the direction that much cultural resources re- mote sensing is going in the United States today. Wil- son discusses this difference briefly in his book, ac- knowledging that the use of aerial photos for "terrain analysis" might be valuable in some "remote, little- known, or poorly mapped regions," [the United States?] and even going so far as to suggest that in such places ". . . it may be possible to define areas that are void of visible remains and thereby save much time-consum- ing exploration simply to prove a negative" (p. 19). This sounds just a bit too much like what some of our own "land managing" government offices would like to have us believe, and would be recommended against by most of those involved in American cultural re- sources remote sensing. One specific point brought up in this book deserves mention because it seems to be a persistent and bela- bored topic in British and European aerial archaeology, which make almost exclusive use of oblique photo- graphs rather than vertical-axis photos as usually em- ployed in the United States. If there is anything tra- ditional about British aerial archaeology, it is the stalwart contention that there are things that can be seen on oblique photos that cannot be seen on vertical ones: "oblique photographs . . . may record details that cannot be sufficiently well discerned on an equivalent vertical view" (p. 23). After more than ten years of photographing archaeological sites from the air, analyzing such photos, and contemplating the prin- ciples and possibilities of aerial photographs, I still cannot buy this argument. It may spring from the fact that British aerial archaeologists have always used oblique photography and that most vertical aerial pho- tographs are not taken with archaeological purposes in mind. It would behoove American archaeologists to experiment with optimum sun angles and other con- ditions under which to expose vertical aerial photo- graphs of our own cultural resources in order to dispel this myth, for oblique photographs are extremely dif- ficult to use for mapping purposes. Wilson provides insights on such optimal conditions for photography. pointing the way toward such experiments. If for no other reason than this, Air Photo Interpretation for Ar- chaeologists belongs on the shelves of American as well as English archaeologists. A Late Formative Irrigation Settlement below Monte Alban: Survey and Excavation on the Xoxocotlan Piedmont, Oaxaca, Mexico. MICHAEL J. O'BRIEN, ROGER D. MASON, DENNIS E. LEWARCH, and JAMES A. NEELY. Institute of Latin American Studies, The University of Texas at Austin, 1982. xiv + 221 pp., illus., biblio. $25.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Deborah Nichols, Southern Illinois Uni- versity at Carbondale. The volume reports results of investigations in 1973 of a small late Formative (early Monte Alban I, 550 to 400 B.C. and late Monte Alban I, 400 to 150 B.C.) settlement and irrigation system on a piedmont spur below and east of the main complex of Monte Alban in the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico. Compared with the volume of writings on the sociopolitical and economic significance of prehispanic hydraulic agriculture, the number of archaeological excavations of water-control systems is small, although more work has been done in Oaxaca than in many regions. Thus archaeologists who undertake excavations of irrigation features should find descriptions of the Xoxocotlan remains useful for comparative purposes. The results of a limited study such as this, moreover, can contribute information on regional cultural developments because of the inte- grated program of research of the Valley of Oaxaca Human Ecology Project, directed by Kent V.
