Merquior, The Veil and the Mask: Essays on Culture and Ideology, London, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979, ^6.95, xii+161 pp. Professor Merquior is a Brazilian who has embarked on a grand tour of European centres of social theory. He is searching for a general theory of culture and, after five years with Lévi-Strauss, he has done three with Ernest Gellner. This collection of a few brief essays is his first attempt in English to show us the direction his search is taking him. I get the impression that one result of his intellectual and physical journey is that he has become intrigued by the general wackiness or irrationality of cultures and yet at the same time he is impressed by their in- tegrity and staying power. So, his essays stress, reasonably enough, that a culture can dominate a whole society yet by operating through relationships of power can express the interests of ruling classes or élites; that cultures, as ideologies, appear as veils to their perpetrators and as masks to their victims; that cultures are 'superorganic' yet exist as problems in the minds of individuals; that cultures as entities seen as susceptible of analysis only emerged with the rise of romanticism and the decline of classicism. In short, cultures raise perpetually problems of their own legitimacy. What Professor Mer- quior does in these essays is to review the literature on culture and ideology from California to Prussia and from the 18th century to the present day, selecting plus and minus points with a truly astonishing eclecticism. The range of his acquaintance is so large that there is an inevitable tendency to glibness, yet he never lacks for the telling phrase or the bon mot. On the occasions when he flashes past an author I know well, I found myself irritated by the superficiality, but when he dealt with the unfamiliar I was always intrigued. He reminds me, in the scope of both his interests and his reading, of George Steiner but there the resemblance ends. Merquior is familiar with the cultures he studies; Steiner has mastery of them. This is not just a matter of who is the greater polymath: it is a difference of approach and perspective which tells against Merquior. My cruder colleagues would call Mer- quior a positivist. That is, although doubtful as to exact nature of scientific method, he holds it to be universal. He sees as central to any analysis the problem of validity - of the correspondence between ideas and facts - and his conception of theory is that it must be nomological and deductive. Although sensi- tive and sympathetic to hermeneutics he sees this tradition as essentially unanalytical and 4 anthropomorphic ' (sic) . Yet if there is one</page><page sequence="2">SHORTER NOTICES 667 characteristic of the hermeneutic tradition it is that the analyst is firmly and irrevocably part of his own subject matter. Merquior's rejection of understanding as an end in itself explains his reduction of questions of the content of explanations to questions of method. His particularly empiricist uni- versalism also explains his hatred of other universalisms and thus explains his polemics against Althusser and Habermas. When his theory of culture finally emerges it will not only be universal, but it will belong to that classical view of culture as civilization against which romanticism rebelled and cultural anthropology arose. This is sharply demonstrated by the way in which he adds English to the languages in which he writes. For him, English is merely one derivation amongst many from Latin and Greek and thus no more difficult to handle than French or Portuguese, or whatever one's first language happens to be. Thus his book is arid: the words he loves have none of the resonances we expect in good writing. Each page is studded with archaisms ('cecity', 'cynegetization', 'orectic'), with explicit neologisms ('coenogonic', 'socioplastic') and accidental neologisms ('immediatize', Acceptation', 'repristination'). To draw comparison with Steiner again, when Steiner springs an archaism on the reader, the tendency is to rush to the dictionary: when Merquior does it, one rushes to the red pencil. The style of his writing shows again how a disregard for the importance of analysis of cultures 'from within' leads to an absence of mastery and an excess of familiarity. It is not hard to in- terpret this as contempt. University of Aberdeen DAVID OLDMAN</page></plain_text>
