Jgdrej The masks and associated traditions of the people of the central Guinea coast2 of West Africa are among the most obvious and well-known features of the con- temporary cultural landscape of the region. For some time social anthropologists have described the functions of the masks as social control mechanisms (Horton, 1976). Recently anthropologists have been elucidating these cultural items in terms of symbolic or structural analyses (Fischer and Himmelheber, 1976; Jsdrej, 1976; MacCormack, 1980; Phillips, 1978). So far the studies concerned with symbolism, where they have not been explicitly general and theoretical (JSdrej, 1980; Tonkin, 1979), have confined themselves to a particular culture or a particular mask or subset of masks. Correspondingly there has been a lack of investigation of the relationships between apparently similar phenomena from different localities despite the promis- ing possibilities of useful comparative study within the diversity of this historical region. 3 This approach is especially attractive because, despite some initial suc- cess in revealing the symbolism of the masks, investigators have so far encountered only a rudimentary indigenous exegesis of the masks and their components, certainly nothing comparable to the elaborate exegetical knowledge which exists to the north, such as Dieterlen and Ciss6 describe for the Bambara Komo socie- ty mask (1972: 48-51) or Griaule discovered among the Dogon (1963). This state of affairs has been variously attributed to the effectiveness of the secret societies in defending esoteric knowledge, and to simple forgetfulness (e.g. Eberl-Elber, 1937: 40; Phillips, 1980: 113). In this article a comparative and structural analysis of Mende and Dan mask traditions, using some very general terms, is presented as a practical contribution to a possible way forward. Information on the Dan comes primarily from the researches of the Him- melhebers (1959, 1964a and b, 1975) and Fischer (1967, 1976, 1978) as well as the earlier work of Harley (1950), Schwab (1947) and Vandenhoute (1948). Dan masks are probably known around the world and regarded as the archetypal African mask. They are carved from wood into images of the human face in a style which Vandenhoute has called 'idealised realism' or 'classicism', but they range from portrait-like representations to the grotesque where zoomorphic features are included (Vandenhoute, 1948: 7-8). They are usually worn with a special costume and headdress which together entirely conceal the wearer. There are, according to Fischer, two general kinds of masks: those with gentle oval faces and narrow eyes which behave in a mild-mannered way and those with angular features and protruding eyes which behave vigorously and often aggressively. There are also differences in the headdress and other accoutrements. Masks are accompanied by particular songs, music and dance. By varying the appearance of the mask, its costume and characteristic behaviour, the songs and the dance, innumerable unique masks are produced each with its own identity and personality. The most common type of mask is called deangle (literally, 'smiling mask-spirit') or sometimes bonagle ('circumcision mask-spirit') (Fig. 1). The masks often have</page><page sequence="2">DAN AND MENDE MASKS poetical names such as 'Come-and-look-at-me (for I am beautiful)' and they leave the circumcision camp to go to the village to collect food from the women for the boys and men in the camp. The masks and the women joke with each other in a mild, unaggressive manner. Another kind of mask, like deangle in appearance but rather more elaborate, called tankagle, is not only seen at initiations; individuals are invited to festivals and public events where they entertain with dancing, panto- mime and song (Fig. 2). They have individual names such as 'The-one-who-makes- me-happy'. As a mask ages over several generations of owners, so it may acquire prestige, and its behaviour will be modified accordingly. A mask can be promoted by the elders, and as a glewa ('big mask-spirit') it represents the settlement or quarter of the settlement and acts as judge and peacemaker (Fig. 3). In keeping with its new status, modifications will be made to the mask, such as adding a moustache or changing the headdress. Such masks control ceremonial activities and judge cases which are 'beyond the scope of modern laws and regulations' (Fischer, 1978: 23; Fischer and Himmelheber, 1976). Numerically these masks are very uncom- mon. Moreover, the 'big masks' do not conceal or mask the locus of political authority within a chiefdom, as is sometimes argued by social control theorists (e.g. Horton, 1976: 97),4 but, on the contrary, serve to identify precisely those with authority. In the four cases detailed by Harley it is obvious that ownership of the old, rare 'big masks' reinforced and validated the authority of particular chiefs. In three of the four cases the masks were not even worn by the chiefs when exercising their authority, but were laid beside them. The power of the chiefs rested in part on their possession of the masks while their subordinates were subordinate precisely because they had no such masks (Harley, 1950: 13-17). Besides these adjudicators there are masks which are debt collectors; others are messengers and town criers, military specialists and agricultural experts, while others work in the field of health and illness; many, probably most, are dancers, acrobats, mimics and general entertainers. Some masks behave in a manner which would in other circumstances be considered deviant, for example, extorting payments from people by threatening to beat their children. Masks can also be beggars, and some suffer ill health as they cough and wheeze about. Others are carved with faces distorted by disease. There are stutterers and flirtatious masks, jocular masks and fierce masks. Masks not only embody particular roles but also personality types. 'Le nombre excessif de masques n'est qu'une consequence directe et d'ailleurs tres logique du role exceptionnel qui est reserve au masque du bois tant dans les aspects religieux et magiques, que politiques et sociaux de la vie' (Vandenhoute, 1948: 3). When Mende masks are reviewed in comparison with the Dan masks a number of striking differences are at once apparent. Instead of a large number of virtu- ally unique individual masks which may be grouped rather arbitrarily into a dozen or so types, there are among the Mende about the same number of quite distinct named types or species of masks, in which each individual representative of a type is a replica of all other individuals of that type. There are, of course, dif- ferences at the level of fine detail, but the scope for artistic creaivity is far less than among the Dan. There is not among Mende the elaboration of roles, personalities and behaviour which is so characteristic of the Dan masks. The Mende masks with two or three exceptions are neither anthropomorphic nor zoomorphic. For example, jobai, a common Mende mask type, has a body 72</page><page sequence="3">FIG. 1. 'Deangle' Dan.

Mende masks do not mimic human characteristics and personality traits. The only mask which does so, kongoli, is identifiable and considered very funny by onlookers, in part because it is the only one to do so. There is, as among Dan, a stratification of masks, but the upward social mobility which is a feature of Dan masks does not occur among the Mende masks. Because rank accrues to type of mask and because an individual mask cannot change its type or be promoted, a low-ranking mask can never acquire high rank. But a prestigious mask in one district can have individual examples elsewhere which are of low rank. Nafali is a high-ranking type in the Jawe area of eastern Mendeland, and yomayomei enjoys similar standing in the northeastern area bordering on Kissi country, but when the masks occur elsewhere they have lost their prestige, having only the vestige which accrues to them by virtue of their status in the regions where Mende say they originated. However, the two awesome and feared masks, known as gbini and goboi, occur generally throughout Mendeland. Besides appearing at Poro society initiations they are also closely associated with the promulgation of new rulings and orders by paramount chiefs.5 The relationship between such masks and rulers is at least as close as their tie- up with the Poro society: they also appear at the mortuary rites of chiefs, the descendants of the first settlers of the locality, but not at the rites of commoners who are often clients and generally regarded as subsequent immigrants. Of these two great masks, which are almost identical in appearance, the more powerful, gbini, is distinguished by the leopard skin, as opposed to the antelope of goboi, in its costume. According to Mende custom, any leopard killed in a chiefdom must be given to the chief, who is also sometimes referred to as 'the leopard' (Abraham, 1976: 23). Only one gbini is allowed in a chiefdom and Mende will say in conversation that the gbini belongs to the paramount chief, referring to it as 'his gbini' (Fig. 4). In other words, as among the Dan, the power and authority of chiefs are closely linked with the awesomeness of certain rare masks.6 More numerous than gbini or goboi are masked figures such as yavi and jobai (Figs. 5-6). They are operated by small groups of young men and women and even by villages, sometimes under the patronage of a chief, but always as a com- mercial enterprise. They appear on request and for a fee at public festivals, initiation ceremonies and the mortuary rites of ordinary people. Their costumes are finely made and the helmet masks intricate and brilliantly colourful. They are judged to be 'beautiful' and 'attractive' by the people and are certainly not terrifying. They do not make judgements, nor do they have anything to do with new laws (cf. Siegman and Perani, 1976). Both Mende and Dan account for the masks by describing them as spirits of the forest. They are not ancestral spirits. Ancestral spirits do not dwell in the forest but underground, in an 'underworld'. However, from this point the accounts begin to diverge in a systematic way. According to Dan traditions there is a large number of disembodied spirits (zu) inhabiting the forest who nevertheless have names, personalities and specific characteristics. One of these spirits may appear in a dream to a man or woman. In the dream the spirit identifies itself, its distinguishing features, and enters into a relationship with the dreamer whereby the latter, usually with some reluctance, will produce a materialisation of the spirit which it can then inhabit. If the materialisation is to be a mask (sometimes 73</page><page sequence="8">DAN AND MENDE MASKS it may be put together from various ingredients which are then wrapped up in a bundle or sealed in a decorated shell or horn), then the spirit will choose a man and the dream will be dreamed while he is in the initiation camp in the forest. Dan masks, even more than fetishes (medicines), are regarded as a source of magical power. This quality can be directly related to the circumstances in which the masks are created and from which they emerge into society. These cir- cumstances may be described as the triple conjunction of opposed modes of space, time and being, as these are appropriated by Dan culture. The Dan say 'the cir- cumcision camp is the home of the masks' (Himmelheber, 1964a: 251). In the circumcision bush the men discuss masks. In dreams spirits are encountered and as a result new masks are carved. In other words, the outcome of communica- tion between spirit (zu) and human during the transitional or liminal phase of the initiation rites which take place in the sacred forest on the boundary of the settlement is the appearance of highly ambiguous objects called gle based on the form of the mask, itself an ambivalent embodiment of the relationship between the visible and the invisible, the revealed and the concealed. Gle, obviously a difficult word, also refers to, among other things, abnormal children, corpses and 'strangely powerful musicians' (Fischer, 1978: 19). Outside the circumcision bush a man who wears a mask never speaks about it. Masks are hidden from women, often in the rafters of the blacksmith's forge. Very powerful old masks have to be covered with a white cloth even when they are beside their owners at politco-jural meetings of senior men and chiefs (Harley, 1950: 11). The spirit of a mask may be addressed by name and is the object of prayer and sacrifice. An old mask is usually caked with black dried blood and stained around the mouth with the remains of the kola nuts which have been spat into its mouth. Dan say masks can be heard gnashing their teeth (Fischer, 1978: 18). The applications of the magical power of masks are extensive and varied. Harley describes a mask called Zei who could impregnate infertile women. To do this the mask spewed some water on the ground, made a paste of mud and rubbed it on the belly of the childless woman (Harley, 1950: 36). There is a mask in the circumcision camp which is never worn and is easily recognised by the cuts and notches all over it. The circumciser draws the blade of his knife across the mask after operating on each boy to 'clean the knife of evil spells' (Himmelheber, 1964a: 247). Dan masks evidently operate on two symbolic levels simultaneously. At one level the masks provide instances of ritual reversal: manifestations of normally invisible forest-dwelling spirits appear in the village, the world of humans, while people disappear into the forest to undergo changes in their being. At another level the masks by virtue of their magical power, which derives from the ritual context of their origin, can be deployed in other contexts: to make barren women fertile, cure illness, ensure success in hunting, warfare, agriculture, validate the authority and judgements of chiefs, and so on. The Dan masks are found all over the country because men have dreamed of them, created them, and they have been inherited from one generation to the next while all the time new masks are coming into existence. Although there is some trade in these masks it seems to be limited to possibly illicit dealings with non-Dan (Himmelheber, 1964a: 251; 1975; Fischer, 1978: 19). Among the Mende, on the other hand, most masks have been acquired by trade. There are only two or three mask types which are not traded but which, according to Mende, 74</page><page sequence="9">DAN AND MENDE MASKS are 'found'. This distinction between autochthonous masks and masks acquired by trade is also the distinction between high-ranking masks and low-ranking masks, which in turn is a function of the distinction between land-owning chiefly lineages and the kin groups of commoners, clients and subsequent immigrants. The trade in masks is straightforward. For example, in 1976 the villagers of Mongewo in Koya chiefdom, agreed to the suggestion of one of their number that they acquire a mask of a type called mayugbe, which had been seen in Levuma, a Mende town about 120 miles to the east. The owners of the mask at Levuma sent someone to Mongewo to show the villagers of Mongewo how to make the mask and costume and perform the music and dance. It cost the villagers Le00O in cash (about ?50 sterling), half a bushel of clean rice and a goat. At the same time they secured from the paramount chief of Koya sole rights to mayugbe and its performance in the chiefdom. Such trading probably accounts for the diffu- sion of other types of masks, for example, jobai, another low-ranking type which spread westwards, appearing in middle Mende country in the 1930s and now popular everywhere. Not all masks are replicated and traded to become established as another type of mask. Migeod reported that in 1919 in Luawa chiefdom an original mask called polo-mia-ngundu was created by some 'young men' (konga), that is, commoners, in order to make money, but there is no evidence of it appearing subsequently anywhere else or even whether it still exists in Luawa (Migeod, 1926: 256). The high-ranking masks gbini and goboi and the women's mask sande yafe (also called sowii) are not traded.7 Where a village or town has a goboi, or a chiefdom a gbini, the official history is that it was found long ago in the forest under the water of a pool or river where it was seen by one of the first settlers, who then captured it and pulled it out, always after a great struggle which may have lasted several days. Sometimes it is added that not all goboi and gbini are, nowadays, the originals but are 'copies' of them. Each time a mask from the forest appears in town Mende say that it is 'pulled' (kpua) into town. A Mende spirit becomes visible not so much as a result of being provided with a material embodiment by somebody, but rather, it is as if it had been pulled out of concealment into view in its pristine state, eventually to disappear again into the forest. In this respect several ethnographic details become significant. A notorious and feared Mende forest spirit is known as ndogboi josui, a phrase which might be translated as 'forest trickster'. Typically ndogboi josui, who is said to be large, hairy and terribly ugly, tricks people into losing their way in the forest and so people who have disappeared, and perhaps are never seen again, are said to have encountered ndogboi josui. 8 Ndogboi josui can also bring about remarkable changes in a person's being. He is said to confer wealth and fame on women but sometimes make men mad. In 1967 a stranger was carried into Gbap town from the forest suffering what seemed to be an epileptic seizure. People said that he had been tormented by ndogboi josui. In contrast to the frightful doings of ndogboi josui is the entertainment pro- vided by performers called josui loliibla (literally, 'trickster dancing men', i.e. conjurors). Migeod gives an eyewitness account of a performance by one of these traditional entertainers. The conjuror's tricks involved making various objects disappear and reappear and transforming one object into another; this included his own head (Migeod, 1926: 250-52). Now gbini and goboi are ndolii yafanga (dancing spirits, i.e. masks); not only are they large and hairy but they also wear 75</page><page sequence="10">DAN AND MENDE MASKS the distinctive decorated leather-work collar known as kololewengoi which is typical of the josui loliimoi, the conjuror or trickster. Changing heads is also a feature of some types of masks, for example, mayugbe mentioned previously. In their performances the Mende masks are surrounded by attendants who lead them about like captured beasts. Although the great masks are viewed with respect and sometimes apprehension by onlookers, they nevertheless seem to be not powerful but impotent. Gbini, according to a paramount chief, is accompanied by chiefs who catch him and hold him up when he stumbles and falls. Alldridge wrote of the gbini he saw that 'when he intends to move he makes feigned attempts, staggering as if intoxicated, and the gives a short sudden plunge forward when he apparently becomes exhausted and sinks to the ground' (Alldridge, 1910: 197). It is as if the ngafanga (spirits), although enormously powerful in their normal mode and able to interfere, usually disastrously, in the affairs of humans, lose their potency when they are removed from the forest and become visible in towns and villages. Mende masks and masked figures have none of the life-promoting powers which are attributed by the Dan to their masks. The Mende equivalent in this respect is hale ('medicine'), a concept which is quite distinct from that of the masks (ngafanga). At this point systematic cosmological differences between Dan and Mende are becoming evident. While Dan forest spirits (zu) actively seek out sympathetic humans, who are coaxed into producing a particular materialisation or transfor- mation (gle) which allows the spirit to participate in human affairs, among the Mende it is the spirits (ngafanga) who, it is said, have to be coaxed, bullied and pulled into town from the watery depths of the forest by humans. These spirits move, untransformed, between their invisible mode and the locale of humans, the settlement. At the same time people become spirits as a result of the transfor- mations of death. Thus a mask (ngafa, 'spirit') commonly appears in town at the mortuary rites which take place when, it is said, the spirit (ngafa) of the deceased is going 'beyond the water' to the land of the dead. The ceremony is called tewenjamei, 'crossing the water place'. A report by Tahmen, himself a Dan, reveals that Dan ancestors are also said to dwell beyond a pool or river and that it seems to be not unusual for rumours to circulate among Dan of people going unchanged to the under- world of the ancestors and then returning to the world of the living (Tahmen, 1974: 179-80). By 'contrast Mende refer to such journeys only in the context of their folktales (domeisia), which recount what Mende regard as the outrageously incredible and which they describe simply as 'lies' (Cosentino, 1982; Kilson, 1975). The remarkable symmetry of this configuration also accommodates the different appearance of the Dan and Mende masks. As regards the latter, the spirits appear directly and immediately as reluctant spirits among humans, and so the mask is constructed in such a manner that its appearance distances it from human beings. Of course, there is no reason why some spirits should not seem to resemble humans in some respects, and this is the case as regards the heads of the sande mask and the kongoli mask. In the case of the Dan, eager spirits are transformed from a detached mode in the spiritual domain to a mode which allows them to operate effectively among humans and their affairs. It follows that the spirit will not only embody potency but that its materialisation will be human in appearance, although occasionally it may resemble in part an animal or bird since these creatures also impinge upon human interests and activities. 76</page><page sequence="11">DAN AND MENDE MASKS The structural possibilities inherent in the latent ambivalence of the mask as a duality rather than an entity are exploited by Dan and Mende in different ways. Mende resolve the ambivalence of the mask into the binary opposition of mask and mask wearer. Mende stress the importance of the costume concealing the individual wearing the mask, who must be completely out of sight. The only exception is the jester mask, kongoli, already mentioned, and for this reason, among others, it is considered rather peculiar by Mende. As a consequence of the lack of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism (again but for kongoli and the women's mask sowii) in the design of Mende masks, they are almost portable screens to conceal the wearer. The opposition between the visible spirit (mask) and the invisible person (the wearer of the mask and costume) represents a reversal of the normal mode in which the opposition visible:invisible is related analogically to impotent mortals and powerful spirits. The impotence of the visible spirits, mere masks, is also the potency of the invisible spirits which are not masks. Furthermore, these configurations are, according to structural theorising, objec- tifications of changes in time and so occur as the boundaries between one kind of time and another (Leach, 1961: Rigby, 1968). In this respect it is important to remember that all this relates to a situation in which time is experienced as it has been appropriated by particular historical institutions which are not grounded in Western astrophysics. So masks appear between the time somebody was alone in this world and the time he is among the immortal spirits of the other world; in the time in which children are no longer infants but are not yet adults, that is, while in the initiation camps in the forest. It is this that accounts for the association between the appearance of the high-ranking masks and the promulgation of a new ruling or law by the paramount chief: the appearance of the chiefly mask (spirit) is the end of the time when the old law prevailed and the beginning of the time when the new law applies. In other words, the masks contribute concretely to the discrimination of categories in the Mende social universe. The system of Dan masks, on the other hand, does not resolve the potential ambivalence of the mask, but realises it and intensifies it. Thus the deangle, the basic and common masked figures which appear among the people in the village while novices and initiates are hidden in the initiation camp, are superficially comparable to the Mende masked figures. In both cases great care is taken to conceal the wearer of the mask and the costume. But Dan masks then develop ontologically and typologically in a direction which makes them less mask-like and more magically potent, so that the most powerful masks are seldom worn, seldom used as masks at all, but, as taboo objects and therefore highly ambivalent, have themselves to be concealed. The association of such powerful masks with judicial functions and social control has little to do with 'times' or 'occasions' but is, rather, a concrete expression of the power of the chiefs whose possession of these antique masks legitimates their authority. Beginning as potent spirits usually seen under water in the depths of the forest, Mende masks end up as no more and no less than complex masked figures, or as Mende themselves say, copies of the originals, the spirits. Dan gle begin as simple masks fashioned in the liminal zone of the initiation camp but, when inhabited by otherwise impotent spirits, become highly potent objects, a source of magical power. As such they have spread into all spheres of the everyday life of the Dan. The Mende masks came from outside society, either in the sense 77</page><page sequence="12">DAN AND MENDE MASKS of a legendary extraction from the forest by an individual or as the historical result of a commercial transaction with some distant community, and are then located in the central institutions of initiation and death. The difference between Dan and Mende mask institutions is considerable, but the comparative analysis in structural terms has indicated extensive and systematic relationships. In conclusion, can the structural account of the differences be reformulated as a historical divergence from a common origin? This question cannot be fully answered here but the possibility is worth considering. Historians and ethnologists agree that the Mende are a relatively recent product of the com- bination of some southern Mande people, such as the present day Gbande and Toma at the headwaters of the Lofa and Moa rivers, with some northern Mande people. It seems that about 450 years ago a particularly martial detachment of the latter, moving south and west, led the former in a vigorous invasion farther into the forest zone then inhabited by the Sape, speakers of a Mel language like present-day Temne or Bullom in Sierra Leone (Person, 1971: Rodney, 1970). Meanwhile other southern Mande such as the Dan around the headwaters of the Cavally and Cess rivers, about 150 miles to the south and east, were in 'une zone dont l'histoire s'est deroule dans un isolement exceptionnel, a une rythme tres lent et dans un cadre morcele' (Person, 1964: 335). The evidence from comparative ethnography seems to be quite consistent with such historical events. Three points in particular are worth mentioning. First, the Mende myth that the high-ranking masks were originally found by the invaders in various localities in Mendeland is consistent with the historical invasion by southern Mande people subordinate to northern Mande chiefs, since such legen- dary events provide a charter for their occupation of the territory. Note also that gbini and goboi are distinguished among Mende masks by having prominently on their backs a number of wooden slates (walesia) which are used by Muslims when writing in Arabic spells and verses from the Koran. Secondly, the radical distinction among Mende between the chiefly masks (gbini and goboi) and the common masks (yavi, jobai etc.) set against involuted complexity but coherence of the Dan system of masks, recalls the making of Mende society and the rela- tively stationary nature of Dan society respectively. Finally, it could be argued that in very general terms Mende masks have evolved in the sense of having become more rationalised compared with Dan masks. Thus they represent spirits rather than embody them; they can be traded in market relationships; the rela- tionship between the mask and the mask wearer is instrumental, and so on. Such an evolution could perhaps be linked to the general development of Mende society in the history of their migrations and conquests of the last 450 years. NOTES I should like to acknowledge a grant from the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland which made possible recent fieldwork in Sierra Leone. Unless an authority is cited, information relating to Mende culture derives from my own field research. Dr Elizabeth Tonkin and Dr Frederick Lamp kindly commented on an earlier draft and it has also benefited from remarks made in the Social Anthro- pology Discussion Group at Aberdeen University. : The central Guinea coast region is roughly demarcated by the Atlantic coast and lines drawn from the Nimba mountains to Cape Sierra Leone and Cape Palmas (cf. d'Azevedo, 1962). Siegman (1980) has refined the social control argument in order to relate the different mask institutions to local differences in social organisation. 78</page><page sequence="13">DAN AND MENDE MASKS 79 4 Horton believes he has support for this theory from the actors' point of view, but the remarks made by the Dan elders which he cites about the 'power' of masks being used 'to enforce obedience' are rather ambiguous. It cannot be assumed that the elders are referring to the supposed advantages of concealing the identity of executives in the interests of effective administration (1976: 97). Alldridge's (1910: 195-7) description of such an event is that of an eyewitness. 6 The relationship between goboi and gbini is an intriguing one. Goboi is not allowed to appear at the same time as gbini. Of the two goboi known to me, both were owned by villages represented by the village chief, and in both cases the settlements claimed an independent historical origin from that of the chiefdom in which they are located. It is tempting to suggest that the two masks may express political relationships in the constitution of a chiefdom. 7 Some sandeyafe have been acquired from parent groups of Sande women and they are distinguished by a small brass bell (bamande) in the costume. Sande yafe that have been pulled out of the forest pools have no such bell. 8 Arthur Abraham, the Mende historian, recalls that his mother told him how her 'uncle's' disap- pearance into the forest for three days was attributed to ndogboi josui (Abraham, 1972: 55).

Resume Les masques Dan et Mende: une comparaison structurelle Les masques et les mascarades repr6sentent une caract6ristique frappante et permanente de la culture traditionelle c6tiere de la Guin6e centrale. Des theories sociologiques sur la nature et la fonction des masques furent econcees selon des termes de mecanismes de contr6le social allant des 'masques d'epouvante' purs et simples contr6les par les groupes dominants aux raisons plus subtiles telles que le besoin d'anonymit6 dans l'execution de fonctions administratives. Malheureusement, rien de cela ne convient veritablement a la diversite des faits et, recemment, les anthropologues sociaux tenterent d'aborder ces institutions en utilisant des id6es provenant de l'analyse du symbolisme. La difficulte, dans ce cas, est les ex6geses indigenes peu developp6es et cet article offre donc au moyen d'exemples une avancee possible. L'idee fondamentale est relativement simple et selon laquelle un masque ne constitue pas une entit6 mais une relation ambivalente entre les deux composants, a savoir la masque lui-meme et ce qu'il dissimule. L'evaluation et l'elaboration concrete des termes de cette relation, les masques eux-memes, varieront selon le systeme cosmologique general dans lequel ils se trouvent et leur fonction au sein de ce systeme. La m6thode est celle de l'analyse transformationnelle qui rend intelligibles de telles structures a l'aide d'une comparaison qui retient les differences entre elles. 80</page></plain_text>
