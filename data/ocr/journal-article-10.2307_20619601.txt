<plain_text><page sequence="1">Imperial Frontiers: Building Sacred Space in Sixteenth-Century South India Crispin Branfoot Studies of sixteenth-century South Asian art are dominated by the achievements of the Mughal Empire in north India. Later Hindu architecture, that is, after the twelfth century, has been neglected until comparatively recently, under the assumption that the finest productions of Hindu artists were earlier and that later work was simply repetitive, debased, or degenerate. The sheer number of temples to study and the fact that they remain in use have also proved problematic. In south India the temple architecture of the Vijayanagara Em pire is now better known, but many consider the fall of the capital in 1565 to have resulted in the end of major temple construction. Close examination of one Hindu temple built in the 1560s highlights a number of issues of wider signifi cance for our understanding of south Indian architecture and the meaning of Hindu temples more generally. Ever since the pioneering studies by Ananda Coomraswamy and Stella Kramrisch in the first half of the twentieth century, the meaning and symbolism of the Hindu temples built across India from the fifth century onward have been taken as manifestations of cosmic form and the process of cosmic creation. Instead of more attempts to explicate the general pan-Indian meaning of the Hindu temple across fifteen hun dred years as a supposedly unitary and unchanging phenom enon, more attention needs to be paid to the multilayered meanings of particular temples in specific contexts. Through his study of sacred architecture in another area, medieval Europe, Richard Krautheimer established the importance of the content or iconography of architec ture.1 As Paul Crossley has noted, Krautheimer's theory of the architectural copyjoined the notion of symbolism both to the intentions of the patron and to the response of the medieval onlooker. He noted that certain ancient and venerable structures were frequently copied in early medieval architecture, not accurately in order to produce an exact reproduction, but approximately and vaguely, with just enough of the essen tial features of the prototype to evoke its meaning, to allow the viewer to experience, at second hand so to speak, the essential qualities of the original. The associative power of architectural forms could thus be used by patrons to pro mote devotion, evoke holy sites, or . . . make political propaganda.2 These interrelated layers of meaning?religion, sacred geog raphy, and politics?can be explored in the sixteenth-century temple at Krishnapuram. The "frontiers" of the title are geographic, political, and cultural: this Hindu temple was built at the southernmost extremity of the Vijayanagara Empire, about five hundred miles from the imperial center; it was built around the deci sive defeat of Vijayanagara in 1565, which directly led to the empire's disintegration; and it was built under the patronage of the Madurai Nayakas, a dynasty of kings and former Vija yanagara governors who defined a distinctive era of cultural and artistic vitality from the mid-sixteenth through the early eighteenth centuries. Approaching Krishnapuram Along the river Tamraparni at the southern tip of the state of Tamil Nadu are a number of Hindu temples clustered along the fertile green riverbanks in an otherwise arid landscape. Some of these temples are in large towns, while others stand almost isolated in small villages. About 5M&gt; miles (9 kilome ters) from the city of Tirunelveli is the village of Krishna puram, dominated by the temple to Vehkit?calapati (Visnu), its high walls painted with vertical red and white stripes that stand out against the surrounding landscape (Fig. I).3 Ded icated to a form of Visnu, who, together with Siva, is one of the two main deities to whom Hindu temples in southern India have been consecrated from the seventh century on, this temple was a new foundation, built in the 1560s on a site that was not previously sacred. The outer of two concentric enclosures (prakaras), both neatly proportioned in a ratio of 2:1, is entered via a pyramidal gateway (gopura), characteristic of the south Indian temple, at the center of the east side (Fig. 2). Within the enclosure is an open colonnade adjoining a columned festival hall or mandapa (D); much of the remain der of the outer enclosure is empty but for two almost iden tical goddess shrines in the southwest and northwest corners (B and Q. The remote location and modest scale of this temple with outer walls measuring about 262 by 525 feet (80 by 160 meters) belie the arresting entrance to the main shrine to Vehkit?calapati, for here can be found some of the most striking sculptures in southern India. Huge images of sinu ous, energetic warriors with swords and shields and rearing mythical lion-headed animals stand alongside Rati, the ele gant goddess of love looking in a mirror while seated on her divine bird-mount, and her male counterpart, Manmatha, who holds the sugarcane bow with which he fires feathery arrows of love. These architectural sculptures about 6V2 feet (2 meters) high seem to burst from the composite columns that line the most prominent aisles in the temple (Figs. 3-5). If the temple was all built at one time, the 1560s, then the unprecedented number of large, high-quality composite col umn sculptures in the festival hall and the inner corridor make this building highly significant. The form and subject matter are rooted in earlier developments in the Tamil coun try, and indeed at Vijayanagara farther north in the previous fifty years, but these examples mark a departure in architec tural sculpture that became a defining feature of south In dian temples in the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The columns demonstrate important sculptural innova</page><page sequence="2">172 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 1 Venkitacalapati temple, Krish-napuram (photograph by the author) tions. The vast majority of Indian stone sculpture is integral, having no separate pieces joined on, and the south Indian composite column is no exception, being sculpted from a single block, even when a small column or a large deity projects from one side. The composite column is distin guished from the simple columns that developed beginning in the seventh century in the Tamil region by the incorpora tion of a smaller column on one side, making the whole rectangular, not square, in section. All elements are sculpted from a monolith up to 16 to 20 feet (5 or 6 meters) high (Fig. 6). This scheme allows for substantial variation, for the com posite columns that developed beginning in the thirteenth century may have several columns or colonnettes, sometimes carved fully in the round on one or more sides of the core column. The adoption of the Tamil tradition of architecture at Vijayanagara, the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, in the fifteenth century led to the use of composite columns in the Deccan, the upland region of the modern states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh (Fig. 7). The new form of column with figural sculpture that developed there subsequently spread throughout southern India. Many of the later temples at the capital have composite columns, some with rearing yalis, a mythical combination of a lion and elephant, though col umns with sculptures of deities are unusual there. The most elaborate composite columns at Vijayanagara are those in the open attached hall of the Vitthala temple built in 1554 and the similarly dated cruciform hall next to it. Some of these composite columns have twelve colonnettes and two rearing yalis spreading around the four sides of the core column.4 This hall has some of the earliest examples of figural com posite columns, though at only about one yard (less than one meter) in height, these images are much smaller than the sculpture in Tamil Nadu created a decade or two later. These individual composite columns gave rise to a change in temple design. The wider top of this new column meant that the bases were farther apart, resulting in wider aisles and a greater sense of spaciousness at floor level. This new col umn coincided with the use of much longer beams that spanned greater distances in higher, wider, and more open corridors and halls. Earlier halls, by contrast, featured dense rows of shorter columns, which left narrower aisles between them. As the use of the simple composite column spread in temples in Tamil Nadu from the mid-sixteenth century, so, too, did the composite columns with figural sculptures. Tremendous sculptural skill was required to produce these elaborate columns. The rock used in Tamil Nadu for sculp ture in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is usually described simply as granite, an igneous rock, whose key characteristic is its extreme hardness. Granite and related brittle rocks are not cut but smashed and shattered by striking the stone with the tool held perpendicular to the surface.5 As Nicholas Penny remarks, undercutting, projec tion, and perforation are generally avoided when sculpting granite, for the composition of the stone makes these techniques difficult and risky. Writes Penny, "Hammering at a small area to achieve, say, the space between arm and chest, could have caused a statue to shatter and would certainly have weakened it."6 The hardness of the material used for much south Indian sculpture is reflected in the rough, unfinished appearance of some surfaces and in the preference for carving figures attached to a stela or back plate. Nonetheless, the sculpture at Krishnapuram is evi dence that sculptors in sixteenth-century Tamil Nadu had a great sense of three-dimensional volume. This is seen both in the way that the large figures avoid the rigid frontality of much earlier sculpture, adopting energetic, sinuous postures, and in the way the figures are freed from the orthogonal block of stone (Fig. 8). The rectilinear shape of the original monolith has disappeared, leaving the sculpture, not the stone block, as the primary form. Furthermore, unlike much south Indian sculpture, sixteenth-century sculpture has a very</page><page sequence="3">BUILDING SACRED SPACE IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY SOUTH INDIA 173 fine polish, demonstrating further patient labor with oil and abrasives on the part of the sculptors. The degree of under cutting, the fine detail, and the smooth finish all suggest that the enormous technical problems associated with working in very hard rock had been largely overcome. In addition, these composite columns share the dynamic qualities of emergence and expansion conveyed by Indian temple architecture more widely, especially the figural exam ples. A common theme in South Asian art is the column of power, whether sacred or secular. In sculpture this is clearly represented by the linga, the principal aniconic image of Siva in Saiva temples, which houses the sacred power of the god. The power in these columns is not always static, for the former is often seen to emerge from the latter, a phenome non Heinrich Zimmer describes as "expanding form."7 Sculp tures depicting the myths of Siva as Lirigodbhava or of Visnu as the man-lion Narasirhha illustrate this concept.8 The con cept of expanding form is evident in individual Tamil figural composite columns as well as in the development of this column form over the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The deities on figural composite columns spread forward and sideways, becoming larger and more active until they hardly appear to be attached to their support at all. Krishnapuram boasts forty composite columns with large figures sculpted from a monolith, each one a complex work of sculpture. In the inner enclosure can be found two door guardians, eight yalis, and six columns with deities; the festi val hall in the outer enclosure has six columns with deities across the front and two rows of nine with yalis inside. How ever modest in scale this temple is compared with the great urban temples such as the MIn?ksI-Sundaresvara in Madurai or the Rarigan?tha at Srirangam, this was a costly, high-status commission. To understand the artistic innovation of these columns, we need to consider the wider cultural landscape and the role that temples played in the changing political conditions of southern India in this period. Temples, Politics, and the Foundation of Krishnapuram Founded in the 1340s, the Vijayanagara Empire had domi nated the whole of southern India for two centuries. In 1377 the Vijayanagara general Kumara Kampana defeated the forces of the Madura sultanate near Madurai, ending a fifty year period of rule by Muslims in the heart of southern India. Temple worship was restored in the few places where it had been disrupted, and Kannada- and Telugu-speaking outsiders from the Deccan established their authority over the Tamil country. The far south was always a distant concern for the Vijayanagara emperors, who throughout the fifteenth cen tury were occupied with the geopolitics of the northern fron tier between the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers with their Deccan sultanate rivals, at Bijapur and Golconda. Only in the early sixteenth century did they take any great interest in the affairs of the Tamil country, visiting the great temple centers and, at the height of the empire's power, in the 1520s and 1530s, establishing stronger regional rulers, the Nayakas, as local governors. Then, on January 23, 1565, at the battle of Talikota, a confederation of the Deccan sultanates defeated the forces of the Vijayanagara Empire and sacked the capital, leading to the gradual disintegration of the last great imperial power in 0 10 20m. 2 Plan of the Vehkit?calapati temple, Krishnapuram: A) Vehkit?calapati, B) Alarmelu Mahkai tayar, C) Padmavati tayar, D) festival hall (mandapa), Ba balipitha, Dh dhvajastambha, Ga Garuda, Dv dvarapala (door guardian), Y yali. 1.

Following the disastrous battle, the imperial capital moved south and east, first to Penukonda and then, from 1592, Chandragiri. From the mid-sixteenth century, south India was dominated by the increasing power and influence of the Nayakas, as they challenged the declining rule of the final Aravidu dynasty of Vijayanagara kings (rayas), leading to a major civil war between 1614 and 1629. In the Tamil country, three Nayakas dominated the region from their respective centers at Gingee, in the north, and the older seats of power at Tanjavur, the Chola imperial capital, and Madurai, the capital of the Chola's imperial rivals, the Pan dyas. The Madurai Nayakas took power about 1529, toward the end of the reign of Krishnadeva, the Vijayanagar em</page><page sequence="5">BUILDING SACRED SPACE IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY SOUTH INDIA 175 5 Composite column of VTrabhadra holding sword and shield on south side of inner corridor, Vehkit?calapati temple (photograph by the author) ^^^^^^^^^^ Puspapotika (side) ^J^^^ beam Puspapotika ||J ?iT IBM ^^ "^^ "^ Plan at A-B 6 Tamil Dr?vida composite column (adapted from Journal of Indian Art and Industry, 1899) peror, and maintained rule within the family. The longest lasting of the Tamil Nayakas, at their height of power they controlled much of southern Tamil Nadu. The dynasty came to an end only in 1736, defeated by the Nawab of Arcot. The Nayaka dynasties of the Tamil country were outsiders to the region, for they were largely from the Telugu-speaking parts of the Deccan. Their legitimacy?political, religious, cultural? was based on two factors: first, their relation with the Vijaya nagara emperor and the imperial center, and, second, their association with the cultural traditions of their adopted ter ritory in the Tamil country. For the Madurai Nayakas this meant specifically the Pandyas, who ruled the far south from Madurai from at least the eighth century, and probably ear lier, until the early fourteenth century. Like their imperial forebears, the Nayakas supported the Hindu tradition, its cult centers, and its institutions, founding new temples and making major additions to existing sacred sites across the Tamil country in the sixteenth and seven teenth centuries.9 Temples are central to any understanding of authority in south India from the fourteenth to eighteenth centuries, for a defining feature of premodern south Indian political communities is that kings, both imperial and local, and the deities installed in temples share sovereignty.10 The king must protect the temple and uphold dharma, religious authority. His relationship with the deity of the temple both sustains and displays his rule. Conceived as regents of the deity, south Indian kings were often crowned in a temple before the god. Harihara and Bukka, the cofounders of the Vijayanagara Empire, dedicated their kingdom to the deity Vir?p?ksa, a form of Siva, whose most important temple was at their capital. They ruled on Vir?p?ksa's behalf, a practice their successors continued up to the late sixteenth century; Vijayanagara inscriptions usually end with "Sri Vir?p?ksa" instead of the king's signature.11 The Nayakas of Madurai similarly ruled as regents of the warrior goddess MTn?ksT. As Arjun Appadurai notes, in the period from 1300 to 1700 "temples were ritually essential to the maintenance of king ship."12 The relation of kings and other political authorities with</page><page sequence="6">176 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 7 Map of south India (drawn by the author) ! P 8 Door guardian (dvarapala), Vehkitacalapati temple (photograph by the author) temples is expressed through inscriptions on walls or on copperplates stored in the temples. These record donations of land or villages, whose produce supported the rituals and ceremonies that honored the resident deity. The date of the grant and the presiding ruler are usually mentioned; occa sionally they may record the foundation of the temple itself. The Verikit?calapati temple at Krishnapuram is well supplied with epigraphic sources: two inscriptions on the temple walls and a set of copperplates. The inscriptions, in Tamil, are on the outside walls of the outer enclosed hall (mahamandapa), on either side of the entrance to the main shrine.13 The one on the left dates to the reign of the Vijayanagara ruler Sadashiva (1542-70) in the year 1485 of the Saka era (ca. 1563/64).14 It records the gift of six villages and some land to the temple of Tiruvehkatan?thadeva by Krishnappa Nayaka (r. 1564-72) for the spiritual merit of his father, Vishvanatha Nayaka. The right-hand inscription dates to the Safozyear 1499 (ca. 1577/78) in the reign of Sriranga I (1572-86). Though much damaged, it records a gift by Virappa Nayaka (r. 1572-95) for the merit of his father, Krishnappa Nayaka, to the temple of Tiruvehkatan?thadeva at Krishnapuram on the bank of the Tamraparni river. The five copperplates are bound by a ring and inscribed on both sides in Sanskrit verse.15 At the top of the first plate is the Vijayanagara dynastic symbol?the boar, downward pointing sword, sun, and moon?and the symbol of the Teh kalai sect of Srivaisnavism, the dominant form of Visnu de votion in Tamil Nadu, flanked by the conch and discus of Visnu. Following a detailed genealogy of Sadashiva, the plate records the foundation of a temple to Tiruvehkatan?tha by Krishnappa Nayaka, son of Vishvanatha and grandson of Nagama Nayaka. Dated in the Saka year 1489 (ca. 1567/68), the inscription describes the temple, which was encircled by a wall with a high gopura and featured a large, beautiful columned hall (rangamandapa). Broad streets were laid out for the annual chariot festival, when the deity was dragged around the sacred site on a mobile wooden temple (ratha or ter). Sadashiva donated villages at the request of Krishnappa for the daily pujas, or offerings, of light, incense, and flower garlands, and for the annual festivals, including both the chariot festival and a float festival, when the deity was pulled around a water-filled tank on a floating temple.16 These inscriptions provide a wealth of detail about the context in which this temple was built. Their secure dates of</page><page sequence="7">BUILDING SACRED SPACE IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY SOUTH INDIA 177 1563/64, 1567/68, and 1577/78 indicate the temple's foun dation date, about 1567/68. Reliably dated temples are un usual in the Tamil country after the fourteenth century, especially as the numbers of inscriptions decline in the six teenth and seventeenth centuries. The inscriptions also fur nish firm evidence of patronage by the Madurai Nayakas. Patronage of temple construction in Madurai itself by the Madurai Nayakas is clearly established from the mid-sixteenth through the seventeenth centuries, to be seen at the huge Min?ksT-Sundaresvara temple complex at the center of the city. Outside Madurai, however, where the broad patterns of temple construction in the regions ruled by the Madurai Nayakas suggest they were actively involved in building pro grams, the detailed evidence is much more fragmentary. A study of Madurai Nayaka patronage of architecture in the period of their rule in southern India from about 1529 to 1736 would result in only a partial understanding of the many temples in the geographic area of their rule, from the Kon gunadu region in northwestern Tamil Nadu to Ramesvaram and Kanyakumari in the south. The temple foundation at Krishnapuram in the 1560s is thus one of the earliest clear examples of Madurai Nayaka architectural patronage. Through the later sixteenth century, the Madurai Nayakas repositioned themselves in relation to both their nominal Vijayanagara overlords and the Tamil communities over which they now ruled. One element in this negotiation was the choice of deity to whom the temple is dedicated. The inscriptions at Krishnapuram name the temple's deity as Vehkatesvara, the name of Visnu at Tirupati (also known as Tiruverikatan?tha, both meaning "lord of sacred Venkata [hill]"). This is one of the most important Vaisnava temples in south India in what is now southern Andhra Pradesh. Tiruvenkatam (or Tirupati) looms large in the devotional poetry of the twelve Alv?rs ("those who are immersed" in love of Visnu), the poet-saints of Srivaisnavism, the dominant sect of south Indian Vaisnavism, who lived between the sixth and ninth centuries. Srlvaisnavas regard their poetry as revealed scripture, and the gathering of the ?lv?rs' poetry into a systemized canon, the "four thousand sacred verses" (N?l?yiradivyaprabandam), from the tenth century and its rec itation in temple worship ensured the Alv?rs a key place in later Tamil Vaisnavism. The twelfth to fourteenth centuries were significant across southern India for the rise in impor tance of Vaisnavism. Srivaisnavism was Tamil in origin, based on the teachings of R?m?nuja (traditionally 1017-1137), with major centers at Srirangam, Kancipuram, and Tirupati. Beginning in the period of the Alv?rs, deities acquired names reflecting the site myths and local characteristics of the deity and temple. Then, around the fourteenth or fif teenth century, "copies" were made of the greatest pilgrim age sites. Often this replication was in name alone, rather than in the physical layout and form of the temple or whole pilgrimage site.17 The most widespread was the reproduction of the great northern holy city of Kasi (Benares, Varanasi) on the river Ganges; all across southern India are temples iden tified as a "southern Kasi." Next in importance in this process is the temple to Visnu as Vehkatesvara at Tirupati, among the most revered Tamil Srivaisnava pilgrimage sites. Krishnappa Nayaka's choice of dedication at Krishnapuram is thus signif icant, for it shows he wanted to evoke the illustrious sacred past of the ?lv?rs as much as the specific religious associations of Tirupati.18 The Tirupati temple would have had great resonance for Krishnappa. The temple gained the preeminence it main tains to this day under the patronage of the Vijayanagara rulers, especially the great early-sixteenth-century Tuluva kings Krishnadeva and Achutyadeva, both great devotees of Tamil Srlvaisnavism.19 Both visited the temple on nu merous occasions, and Achutyadeva was crowned there before the deity in 1529. Vehkatesvara grew increasingly popular at Vijayanagara from the mid-fifteenth century on. Eight temples are identified as dedicated to the deity, most commonly known in the capital as Tiruvehgalan?tha. The most notable of these is the large north-facing temple founded in 1534 by Achutyadeva's brother-in-law Hiriya Tirumalaraja.20 The Telugu-speaking Nayakas are often considered outsiders to the Tamil region to the south. Though the Madurai Nayakas may have come from the Kancipuram region of northern Tamil Nadu, judging from their inscriptions, that adjoins the Telugu-speaking area in modern Andhra Pradesh where Tirupati is located, they are still outsiders to the far south of the Tamil region.21 By dedicating the temple to Visnu as Vehkatesvara, Krishnappa Nayaka was supporting a Tamil religious community. In ad dition, and importantly, he was aligning himself with and emulating his Vijayanagara imperial overlords in their sectar ian preferences, and it was precisely these two rulers, Krish nadeva and Achutyadeva, who about 1529 had established the Madurai Nayakas as regional governors. However, the relationship of the Madurai Nayakas with the Vijayanagara Empire was not simply one of subordination or emulation, as the content of the inscriptions at Krishna puram demonstrates. The earlier inscription and the copper plates name the Vijayanagara king Sadashiva, the last ruler of the Tuluva dynasty. Yet, in reality, power throughout his reign (1542-70) was in the hands of Ramaraya and Tirumala, sons in-law of Krishnadeva (r. 1505-29). After Ramaraya's death in 1565, Tirumala controlled the empire as Sadashiva's regent. Only after Sadashiva's death in 1570 did Tirumala crown himself raya and founder of the final Aravidu dynasty of Vijayanagara kings, and it was his son Sriranga I (r. 1572-86) who is named in the later inscription of about 1577/78. The inscriptions at Krishnapuram thus straddle not only the de feat of Vijayanagara in 1565 but also the shift in the capital southeast to Penukonda and the establishment of a new dynasty. The Madurai Nayakas' inscriptions before 1565 in variably praise the Vijayanagara king and give the Nakayas' position as agent of the king.22 The Krishnapuram copper plates mark a shift in rhetoric, for they note that grants are made by the sovereign not of his own volition but at the request of the Madurai Nayaka.28 In earlier inscriptions, as noted, the initial eulogy (prasasti) was devoted to the king alone. In the Krishnapuram copperplate dated to 1567/68, by contrast, praise is given not only to Sadashiva but also to the Nayaka in his own right. Among a long list of virtues, Krishnappa Nayaka is said to know the truth about duty and is described as "the establisher of the Pandya dynasty" (Pandyakulasth?panach?rya). Some early scholars have viewed the statement that Krish nappa knew the truth about duty as clear evidence of the</page><page sequence="8">1 78 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 Nayakas' loyalty to the Vijayanagara king.24 Such an interpre tation is questionable, though, given that the inscription marks a key moment in the Madurai Nayakas' shift toward greater independence, however subtle this move was at such an early date. As Nicholas Dirks remarks, "These lesser kings have moved from being passive reflections of the great and undisputed overlordship of the Vijayanagara kings to acting in more innovative ways."25 The epithet "the establisher of the Pandya dynasty" is also of uncertain meaning but appears to indicate the Madurai Nayakas' growing awareness of their regional dynastic heritage. With these words they were pre senting themselves as the rightful heirs to Pandyan rule from the age-old capital at Madurai, or even as Pandyans them selves. This, despite the presence of a later Pandyan dynasty at Tenkasi (southern Kasi), that was building temples in the far southwest corner of the Tamil country in the fifteenth century and issuing inscriptions into the seventeenth cen tury.26 Later sources attempted to represent the Madurai Nayakas as the rightful rulers of Madurai. In the early-eigh teenth-century Telugu text Tanj?v?ri-?ndhra r?jula caritra, the goddess Mln?ksl tells the general Nagama that his son Vish vanatha is the proper man to rule the kingdom in her pres ence.27 A similarly close relationship between goddess and Nayakas is shown in a ceiling painting in the Mln?ksT Sundaresvara temple in Madurai dating to about 1690-1700. There the queen regent Mangammal receives the scepter of authority (cenkol) directly from the Pandyan warrior goddess MIn?ksT herself. The inscriptions at this new temple at Krishnapuram should therefore be seen not just as reflections of historical processes and political relationships but as the means by which these were enacted.28 The act of temple foundation and the naming of the new sacred site as Krishnapuram may also be interpreted in like manner. For Krishnapuram is not only the city of Krishna, the deity, but the city of Krishnappa, the Nayaka; he named the new town after himself. In doing so he followed the precedent of Krishnadevaraya, who in 1513, after his successful conquest of the Gajapatis of Orissa in eastern India, founded the Vijayanagara suburb of Krish napura and a new Krsna temple there. The Madurai Nayakas based their political legitimacy on Vijayanagara's golden past of the early sixteenth century. The Telugu R?yav?cakamu (Tidings of the King), an account of the reign of Krishnade varaya written later in Nayaka-period Madurai, about 1595 1600, can be read as an ideological justification for the power wielded by the Madurai Nayaka regime.29 In it, the loss of the city of Vijayanagara in 1565 is seen as crucial to the Aravidu emperors' legitimacy, for they no longer possessed the ritual authority sought by dependent kings such as the Nayakas to augment their own authority. The R?yav?cakamu intimates that the throne of Madurai derives its legitimacy not from the faded contemporary Vijayanagara of the Aravidu monarch Venkatapati II (r. 1586-1614) but directly from the glorious Vijayanagara of Krishnadevaraya some eighty years earlier. As Phillip Wagoner has observed in his discussion of the R?yav?cakamu, Given the ideological basis for Nayaka legitimacy, the po litical situation in the latter half of the sixteenth century clearly must have generated a deeply problematic contra diction for the Nayaks of Madurai. Nayaka power was real, but ideologically dependent, while Vijayanagara's power, even though remaining ideologically absolute, had all but vanished in any real sense. With the legitimacy of their legitimising overlord now itself in question, Madurai's rulers were confronted with a serious dilemma that could be resolved only by means of a thorough transformation of the ideological system on which all political relations were based.30 This process was clearly under way in the years immediately following 1565, as the inscriptions at Krishnapuram suggest. The Tamil Temple Tradition The temple at Krishnapuram is built in the Tamil Dr?vida tradition of temple architecture, with roots one thousand years old. Indian temple architecture is broadly divided into two traditions or languages of architecture: the N?gara, roughly corresponding with the north, and the Dr?vida in the south. The Dr?vida tradition is subdivided into Karnata Dr?vida and Tamil Dr?vida, broadly associated with the modern states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, respectively. An artistic tradition that stresses continuity, it accommodated gradual innovation in details and elaboration in planning. All Hindu temples, whether village shrines or the vast temple cities of the south, have at their core a small chamber for the presiding, resident deity. This main shrine, often with a pyramidal tower above, is called the vimana in southern India. Attached to this is a series of halls (mandapas) that allows priests to enter the main shrine and that allows devotees, who are prohibited from entering the shrine itself, to see and be seen by the deity from a short distance away, a ritual act called darsana. Around the main shrine a series of rectangular, often concentric enclo sures (pr?k?ras) may be built to enlarge the sacred area with subsidiary shrines for other deities, especially one or more consorts. Further detached columned halls may be included for the celebration of festivals, long corridors for processions, water-filled tanks for ritual bathing by deities and devotees, and, on one or more sides, the monumental pyramidal gate ways (gopuras) that are a defining feature of both the Tamil Dr?vida tradition of sacred architecture and indeed the land scape of southern India to this day. Two interrelated design principles characterize Tamil Dr?vida architecture. First, all building types in Tamil tem ples have the same elevation: a basement of distinct mold ings; columns, or a wall with pilasters or engaged columns; a curved eave with high-relief horseshoe arches (Sanskrit n?si, gav?ksa; Tamil k?tu) along its length; and above that, one or more rows of miniature pavilions (Fig. 9). The second prin ciple, first observed by James Fergusson in the 1870s and demonstrated more recently in detail by Adam Hardy, is that most Indian temple architecture is composed of multiple small shrines or aedicules: "in its developed forms, this archi tecture depends for its visual structure, its expression and meaning, on the combination and interrelation of images and shrines."31 Aedicules are not merely surface decoration but are conceived as embedded within the larger structure and to be seen as gradually emerging from it. They are distinguished across the facade by their roofs: square-roofed k?tas at the corners; rectangular, barrel-vaulted s?l?s in the</page><page sequence="9">9 Elevation of a Tamil Dravida temple.

The elements of the elevation (basement, wall, superstruc ture) are not distinct entities but are connected vertically through the structure and organized horizontally (Fig. 10). From the earliest surviving examples in stone to the seven teenth century, temple design could vary in several key re spects: overall aedicular composition, particularly the increas ing density of aedicules, one emerging from within another; the form of the pilasters or engaged columns; the composi tion of the basement and its details; the type of eave kapota, a molding at the top of a basement or wall (Fig. 10), and the size, form, and ornamentation of the high-relief horseshoe arches; the location and type of figural sculpture; and, finally, the overall scale and proportion. With this brief introduction to the language and tradition of Tamil Dr?vida architecture in mind, the particular significance of the Vehkit?calapati temple at Krishnapuram can be understood. The main temple dedicated to Vehkit?calapati consists of the usual vimana with a smaller, inner attached hall (ardha mandapa), 2l larger, outer one (mahamandapa), and a porch. The vimana has straight walls with pilasters supporting a central barrel-vaulted sola with square-roofed k?tas to either side in the superstructure above the wall (Fig. 11). At the center of each side is a split pilaster supporting a lintel with a mythical monster arch in relief (makaratorana). This niche is quite shallow and, rather than containing a figure of a deity, as is usual in most Tamil temples, simply has a foliate strip in relief; small images of deities appear within the makaratorana instead. The whole temple is raised on a base ment (adhisth?na) alone, though a subbasement (upapitha) may be buried under later renovations. The basement is very plain with continuous, regular moldings all around. In fact, little about this shrine indicates a Nayaka-period date in the sixteenth century. Its formal elements?straight walls with no aedicular articulation; no bold ornamented projections and recesses; shallow pilasters rather than round, angular, or fluted engaged columns; plain basement with no variation in moldings or even decoration?all suggest an early date, a low-budget commission, or deliberate, purposeful archaism. Even the bracket capitals are of the bevel-edged tenon type commonly encountered on monuments of the tenth and eleventh centuries. The adjoining halls are similarly plain. One of the few concessions to the general elaboration of Nayaka-period style is the monkey on the south eave of the outer hall; the introduction of high-relief sculpture of mon keys, cats, lizards, and birds is a lively and distinctive feature of Tamil temple sculpture at this time. The plainness of the vimana contrasts with the elaborate porch with its two large door guardians (dv?rap?las), the large figural composite columns that line the inner aisle, and those in the outer enclosure's festival mandapa (Fig. 2). Lin ing the inner aisle are two rows of seven very deep composite columns with six large-scale figural groups alternating with y?lis, all slightly different from one another. Large seated lions (simha) and flower-bud bracket capitals (puspapotika), both characteristic of the sixteenth century and later, support a high, raised roof. A small open area on the north side of the inner enclosure</page><page sequence="10">180 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 Stupi ^ Sikhara Vyalamala Eave kapota Kapota Kantha Kumuda Jagati Vyalamala ? ?? fV^^'V^^ Kapota n m ^} Kantha Padma Upana Adhisthana Upapitha 10 Elevation of a Nayaka-period Tamil Dravida ?wta-aedicule (drawing by the author) may have been used for storing either a set of portable bronze festival images (utsavam?rtis) or a complete set of bronze images of the twelve ?lv?rs. The festival images are now safely located in the ardhamandapa before the main shrine. The kitchen for cooking the food offerings for the resident deities and distributed as prasada to devotees is in the canonically correct southeast corner. A small, plain gate way in the north wall is the "heaven's gate" (Tamil corkkavacal or paramapatavacal), an exit used by deities in procession, found only in Vaisnava temples, always located on the north side and used on one day once a year. The temple complex is entered through the single large pyramidal gateway (gopura) on the east side. Gopuras are formally composed like a main shrine but split in two, with a series of embedded aedicules arranged in an ascending series of stories (t?las) to a barrel-vaulted roof topped with a row of kumbhas (water pots). The brick-and-plaster superstructure rises from a stone basement. The gopura at Krishnapuram is of modest size compared with many built in the sixteenth century but nonetheless displays the elaborate ornamenta tion typical of the Nayaka period. Beyond the gateway an open corridor houses the three elements that mark out for the devotee the main ritual axis of the south Indian temple: the flagpole {dhvajastambha), the sacrificial altar (balipitha), and the animal vehicle (v?hana) of the temple's presiding deity (Fig. 12). The v?hana, as the deity's main devotee, faces it and thereby prominently indi cates the dedication of the temple: here the v?hana is the hawk man, Garuda, kneeling with his hands in prayer, facing Visnu. The flagpole rises through the flat roof, which ob scures the top; a flag is hoisted to mark the beginning and end of temple festivals. In earlier periods temporary flagpoles were probably erected at the start of a festival, but certainly by the Nayaka period, with the proliferation of festivals, perma nent stone dhvajastambha^, often gilded, were erected in tem ples. The dhvajastambha and balipitha are placed just before the entrance to the inner zones of the temple, which polluted Hindus and non-Hindus were prohibited from crossing, and thus indicate not only the primary axis of worship but also divide outer from inner, a major division of sacred space. Between the gopura and the vim?na in the outer enclosure is a large south-facing festival hall with bold figural columns. Tamil temples from the twelfth century onward often feature detached halls for use in annual and more frequent festivals. Small examples are occasionally present alongside the earli est temples, but by the sixteenth century they are often very large, numerous, visually impressive, and the location of some of the finest stone sculpture in the temple.

These structures are for the deity both to rest in and for receiving worshipers, and their form reflects this purpose. They are usually rectangular, with an exterior elevation sim ilar to the other temple structures. The interior is based around a single processional aisle leading to a throne plat form for the deity to rest on. Even very large mandapas with dense rows of columns will have a wider central aisle with a higher ceiling leading to a platform, so though there may be space to move around between the columns, the focus is on the approach to the deity. These festival halls may be under stood as galleries: they are both a space to move through and a space for display, in this case of a deity or deities. As a temporary shrine, festival mandapas share many features with the permanent shrines. With the introduction of larger sup porting composite columns that enabled greater distances to be spanned, both grander processional paths toward the enthroned deity could be created and more devotees were able to assemble in rows down each side as a modest congre gation. Krishnapuram's festival hall, currendy called the Virappa Mandapa, has a wide central aisle lined with huge, very deep y?li columns (Fig. 13). Even more striking than these, how ever, are the six composite columns with figural sculpture across the front, discussed below. The Krishnapuram copper plates mention that Krishnappa constructed a mobile temple 13 Interior of festival hall of Vehkit?calapati temple with y?li composite columns leading to throne platform (photograph by the author) 14 Southern goddess (tayar) shrine to Alarmelu Mahkai, Vehkit?calapati temple (photograph by the author) or chariot (ratha, ter) for a chariot festival (rathotsava), for which broad roads were built around the temple, and also gave sufficient land for a tank and a float festival (teppotsava) to be instituted, underlining the importance of festival ritual to even such a small temple and its initial patron. No sign of a festival tank exists today. The two remaining structures in the outer enclosure, in the northwest and southwest corners, are shrines dedicated to Alarmelu Mahkai (south) (Fig. 14) and Patm?vati (north), Visnu as Vehkatesvara's local goddess consorts (t?y?r) at Tiru pati. Goddesses have played a role in Tamil Hinduism at least from the early centuries CE, both as powerful, independent deities and as peaceful consorts of the gods. Visnu has two eternal consorts, Bh? and Sri, together with one or two local ones (t?y?r). When a deity was accorded a second, local, bride, as is very common throughout southern India, Tamil temples beginning in the late twelfth century frequently in cluded a separate shrine for one or more such local consorts. ?nt?l, the sole female Vaisnava poet-saint (?lv?r), may also be enshrined in a Visnu temple. In small temples, such as that at</page><page sequence="12">182 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 15 Vimana of K?tal Alakar temple, Madurai (photograph by the author) Krishnapuram, the goddess shrine is usually placed just be hind and to one side of the god's shrine within the first or second enclosure. In temples to Visnu, stone images of his eternal consorts Sri and Bh? are placed alongside the pri mary image within the main shrine. In larger temples the goddess's shrine may be so important that it may become a significant temple in its own right, either with its own enclo sures within the principal deity's concentric pr?k?ras or as a separate temple entirely, adjoining the principal one or even at some distance. The temple for the local consort of Verikatesvara, Alarmelu Mahkai, for example, is located not within the main temple at Tirupati but several miles away in another village at Tiruchanur (Alamelmangapuram). The two goddess shrines at Krishnapuram are very similar in design, consisting of the same plan of attached hall and porch with a long columned aisle in front. Exhibiting the distinctly ornamental character of the Nayaka period, the subsidiary structures of this temple are all clearly sixteenth century. Building a Sacred Past How can the variation in architecture within one temple be explained? Is it the result of different periods of construction, as is the case with many south Indian temples that have expanded gradually around an early central foundation? Though only the main shrine may be securely dated by inscriptions, there is no reason to believe that the whole temple complex cannot be dated to the same single period of construction in the 1560s. The name of the festival hall, the Virappa Mandapa, may refer to Krishnappa's son and succes sor, Virappa, who donated land for the merit of his father. If the gift of land coincided with the construction of the festival hall, it would mean that the festival hall was built only a decade or so later than the main shrine. Then, too, the different form of the goddess shrines does not argue for their being later additions, for any new temple built in the Nayaka period would have included them as part of the original construction. The deliberate archaism of the main shrine at Krishna puram suggests that the design reflects the ritual importance of the deity and of the site on which the temple was built. A number of Nayaka-period monuments exhibit a correlation between the supposed age and sanctity of a site and the design of the vim?na. In short, many shrines on old, estab 16 Vim?na of ?din?tha temple, Alvar Tirunagari (photograph by the author)</page><page sequence="13">BUILDING SACRED SPACE IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY SOUTH INDIA lg3 by the ii^l^^BHHHHHiHH^^^^^^^^H^HH^^I^^^^H^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H lished sacred sites incorporate elaborate designs, whereas newly established temples often feature plain designs. Architectural elaboration in the Nayaka period can be seen in aedicules projecting from the main wall surface with dif ferent shaft forms for each one, in different molding on the basement, and in the projection of full secondary aedicules from within the primary one. Such an elaboration of the formal structure coincides with a greater stress on decorative details, such as finer, crisper moldings for the basement or the addition of monkeys and parrots in high relief to enliven the wall surfaces. Characteristic Nayaka-period decorative emphasis can be seen, for example, at the K?tal Alakar temple in Madurai (Fig. 15), the Gop?lakrsna temple on Srirangam Island, and the ?din?tha temple at Alvar Tirunagari (Fig. 16). By stark contrast are the main shrines of the Krsna temple at Srivilliputtur (Fig. 17) and the Kulasekharan?tha temple at Tenkasi. As is the case with the Verikit?calapati temple at Krishnapuram, inscriptions of about 1570 securely date these two temples as new foundations. Yet they are not elaborately designed like the temples similarly dated mentioned above. Formal complexity, then, is clearly not directly correlated to the period of construction, and the tendency toward ever more elaborate designs did not consistently unfold across the Tamil country. Other factors come into play. Lack of money cannot explain why these three shrines were built in a plain style, for all of them have examples of major figural compos ite columns placed away from the sacred core: two figural composite columns and two rows of y?lis in the festival hall of the Kulasekharan?tha temple at Tenkasi, and eight figural composite columns in the outer enclosure of the Krsna tem ple at Srivilliputtur. The Verikit?calapati temple at Krishna puram, of course, boasts forty figural composite columns. Composite columns are complicated, elaborate sculptures, not the work of second-rate craftsmen. These plain shrines do not represent a regional style either; within a few miles of each is an example of an elaborate Nayaka-period vim?na. That no single design can be related to a period or an area is a highly significant conclusion. The linear stylistic develop ment of the Tamil Dr?vida tradition over its thousand years of transformation, from the earliest Pallava-period monuments of the seventh century through the later Chola- and Pandyan and so on to Vijayanagara- and Nayaka-period structures, was not consistendy practiced by passive, anonymous architects within a deeply conservative artistic tradition. Proposed here is one factor that may have influenced the decision to build shrines in the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries in a plain or an elaborate style, and thus to determine the meaning that building evoked. The determining factor was the nature of the site on which the temple was built, whether it was an old and specifically a sacred site or not. The Tamil country has a rich sacred geography, and myths often grew up around the temples in towns and villages to explain their existence in that location. Temples are grouped by sectarian affiliation and mythological association. For ex ample, there are five sites where Siva as Nataraja danced, the five locations of elemental lingas (earth, air, fire, water, and ether), the six places sacred to Murukan, and all the sites made sacred by association with the lives of the Tamil poet saints. In many ways the sixty-three Saiva N?yanm?r (the Saiva equivalent of ?lv?rs) and the twelve Vaisnava ?lv?rs estab lished Tamil sacred geography between the sixth and ninth centuries, singing the love of Siva or Visnu in specific places. Tamil Srivaisnavism highlights the ?lv?rs in its theology and worship and established 108 sacred places (divyadesas), the majority of which are in southern India. Of the elaborate shrines cited above, all are Vaisnava temples on old sacred sites where there had been or is an older temple: the K?tal Alakar is in Madurai, one of south India's oldest sacred sites, now better known for the Saiva MIn?ksI-Sundaresvara temple; the Gop?lakrsna temple is within the great Vaisnava temple of Rahgan?tha on Srirangam Island, the second most im portant Tamil Vaisnava sacred site after Vaikuntha, Visnu's heaven; and the ?din?tha temple at Alvar Tirunagari is the location of many events in the early life of the poet-saint Namm?lv?r.</page><page sequence="14">184 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 18 Mucchukundesvara temple, Kodumbalur, 10th century (photograph by the author) A distinction is sometimes made between those Tamil tem ples built on "sacred" and those built on "royal" sites. "Sa cred" temples grow by accretion over centuries and have no particular association with rulers, whereas "royal" temples are built in one phase, are associated with a particular king, and, if not abandoned, were at least added to. The R?jar?jesvara temple at Tanjavur and the Rajendrac?lTsvara temple at Gan gaikondacolapuram in central Tamil Nadu, both from the eleventh century, are cited most often as examples of the "royal" temple. This, however, is a simplification, for "royal" temples are of course sacred, and new structures may also be added to them. These great Chola temples are still in active worship and, significantly, were completed not in the Chola period but long after, in the sixteenth and seventeenth cen turies under the local rule of the Tanjavur Nayakas. Within the enclosure of the R?jar?jesvara temple a new, very elabo rate Subramanya temple was built in the seventeenth century. New construction was possible because the site had been sanctified by antiquity. Nevertheless, the three plain vim?nas at Srivilliputtur, Ten kasi, and Krishnapuram may be considered royal sites be cause their inscriptions explicitly refer to royal patrons and the temples' foundation dates. An archaic design was chosen for the vim?ncLy the sacred and ritual heart of the temple, to make it appear to be older than it actually was. Although a direct equation between plain and old, or indeed late and elaborate, is not the case today any more than it was in the sixteenth century, the basic characteristics of these plain shrines are associated with the older Tamil temples. Comparing these deliberately archaic sixteenth-century temples with a tenth-cen tury example, such as the Mucchukundesvara temple at Kodum balur on the periphery of the area ruled by the Madurai Nayakas just south of Srirangam, makes this clear (Fig. 18). Why, though, put inscriptions on a temple if the point was to convince the viewer that it is an old structure? In any event, inscriptions are not a major visual feature of Hindu art, and labels identifying deities are very rare.32 Temple inscriptions primarily serve to record details of donations and not to convey meanings about the building's design or iconography. In a richly oral culture, the temple makes its statement through its visual impact, not through a small inscription, often inaccessible or unreadable to many sixteenth-century (not to mention, modern) visitors. At Krishnapuram the Tamil inscriptions were carved on either side of the entrance to the main shrine, where they might have been read by visitors or perhaps read for them by an accompanying priest. Often inscriptions on Tamil temples are placed on the lower moldings of the base or on other less prominent locations. But the two inscriptions at Krishnapuram do not describe the foundation of the temple, just donations to the presiding deity. It is the Sanskrit copperplates in the elite literary language that outiine the temple's foundation, and these were stored out of sight in the temple. The audience for these was at the court, where they were composed and engraved, and for the temple authorities who took possession of the plates as legal documents. Because age confers status and sanctity, the most important temples are often those of great antiquity. Visitors to many Tamil temples, for example, are often told by the priests that the temple is five thousand years old. Writing about the MTn?ksT-Sundaresvara temple at Madurai in the 1780s, Adam Blackader noted that "the age and founder of these buildings is not to be ascertained, as the brahmins conceal the dates, from an idea that their great antiquity increases the venera tion of the people."33 Pointing out to a priest that the entire temple was actually built about three hundred years ago is missing the point; it is the site, not the architectural fabric, that is sacred. This is clear from the examples of temples on old sacred sites that were wholly replaced in the Nayaka period in the highly elaborate form described above. Build ing in an archaic style would thus confer enhanced sacred status on a new structure. A vim?na in an archaic style such as that at Krishnapuram would be entirely appropriate for an old and venerable deity like Vehkatesvara. Contemporary literature is also witness to the growing awareness of the impact of individual sacred sites. The Nayaka period was marked by political instability and temple construc tion, in both numbers and size. An element of this expansion was the composition of site-related mythological literature, the sthalapur?nas. David Shulman has noted that Saiva sthalapumnas typically attempt to elevate the particular site to great antiquity and mythological importance.34 Though undoubtedly pre ceded by oral literature and now-lost texts, the bulk of the</page><page sequence="15">BUILDING SACRED SPACE IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY SOUTH INDIA 1g5 sthalapur?nas known today were written down exactly when many temples were being expanded or founded, in the six teenth and seventeenth centuries.35 The relief sculpture at Krishnapuram also illustrates the growing weight attached to sacred landscape, the site-specific character of deities and their representation, in temple de sign. Vertical panels beneath the flat roof of the first enclo sure's entrance corridor and the interior of the festival hall depict many forms of Visnu. His iconography in these panels varies?standing with Bh? and Sri, lying on the serpent Sesa with various hand gestures, or seated on Sesa?each one in the specific form related to a particular site, such as Rarigan?tha at Srirangam or Padman?bha at Trivandrum. The sacred Vaisnava landscape is therefore an aspect of temple ornamentation as much as it is an influence on architectural design. If the intention of the patron and architect of this temple was to evoke the past through design and for later viewers to see this, then it may further be asked, what past? Among the many Vaisnava temples across the Tamil country the most revered are those included in the auspicious Srivaisnava sa cred places (divyadesas), the locations of the 108 manifesta tions of Visnu sung about by the twelve Alv?rs. The first of these is Vaikuntha, Visnu's heaven; many Tamil temples are described as "Heaven on Earth," and their layout is similar to literary descriptions of Vaikuntha. The majority of the divya desas, however, are located in the Tamil country and became the sites of important temples. By founding a temple in the sixteenth century that aimed to evoke the past, the patrons of Krishnapuram were specifically commemorating the era of the Alv?rs, the founding figures of Tamil Vaisnavism.36 A further layer of meaning may be attributed to this temple's sacred status, for the temple is dedicated to one of the 108 manifestations of Visnu: Visnu as Verikatesvara at Tirupati. As noted above, the temple at Krishnapuram is an architectural "copy" of the more famous religious site at Tirupati. That the temple at Krishnapuram does not materially replicate the form of the earlier, ninth-century foundation at Tirupati is not essential to its identification with the other site. The names of the presiding deity and his two consorts sufficed to arouse associations with the prototype. The Madurai Nayakas may have been attempting a two pronged approach to establish the supposed age of Krishna puram's vim?na. They wanted the archaism of the main shrine to imply that the temple dated from the era of the Alv?rs and was a "copy" of a more famous pilgrimage site. Moreover, they wanted the temple to be thought a small Pandyan foundation that they had gloriously expanded and ornamented. In claiming to be the successors of the earlier dynastic Pandyan rulers or even Pandyans themselves, Krish nappa and the other Madurai Nayakas were following histor ical precedents of using deliberate archaism in design for political propaganda. A notable north Indian example is the imperial Gupta use in the fourth and fifth century CE of third-century BCE Mauryan artistic forms to plant an associ ation with the greatness of the earlier rulers.37 In the fif teenth century the Vijayanagara appropriation of Tamil ar chitecture for the creation of an imperial temple style may similarly be seen as a desire to visually emulate the stature of the earlier Chola Empire.38 George Michell has also proposed that the temples built by the Tanjavur Nayakas at Kumbakonam from the early seventeenth century are deliberately archaic, a form he calls "Neo-Chola" to suggest the continuity of the Tanjavur Nayakas with their more powerful and illustrious predecessors in the same region.39 To some degree, the Tanjavur Nayakas' sense of continuity with the Cholas was expressed not in terms of style but in their choice of which temples to expand. They transformed the R?jagop?la temple at Mannarkuti into their dynastic shrine and made significant additions to both the R?jarajesvara temple at Tanjavur and the Ty?gar?ja temple at Tiruvarur, all important foundations of the Chola period even if not all clearly royal. Temple traditions are understood primarily regionally rather than dynastically, but this does not in any way preclude patrons' use of architectural language to convey meanings about the present and indeed the past. The archaism of Krishna puram's vim?na may be a deliberate effort to make the temple look like an earlier foundation, perhaps one from the Pandyan period like those at nearby Srivaikuntam or Tirunelveli, itself a Pandyan capital. Many temples in the southernmost Pandyan region dating to the eighth to twelfth century are striking for their relative simplicity of design when compared with the contemporary foundations in the central Chola region. Epics, Folk Drama, and Nayaka-Period Sculpture The sculpture at Krishnapuram, like the architecture, illus trates the attempts of the Madurai Nayakas to negotiate their role as heirs not only to the recent imperial past of Vijayana gara but also, to a lesser extent, to the longer, imperial, and religious past of Pandyan southern Tamil Nadu. The visually arresting composite column figures as well as the reliefs on the columns' surfaces demonstrate both continuity with the past and significant innovation. Figural composite columns are generally placed in two main locations in Tamil temple complexes: along corridors that lead into and surround the main shrine; and in detached festival halls. They are invariably placed symmetrically, like opposite like. Thus, an aisle may be lined with a variety of composite columns, some with y?lis, others with deities, and others plain, but each of these types will face a similar one. In addition, a sculpture of a deity is often paired with that of a related deity, either on a neighboring column or on the one opposite. All these distribution patterns are seen at Krishnapuram. The figural composite columns of Nayaka-period Tamil Nadu present a broad range of subjects. The most common is the y?li and the related cavalryman on a rearing horse. Also portrayed are deities, both those known across the whole of India and local gods and goddesses, figures from folk litera ture, guardian figures, and portraits of donors or kings. The examples at Krishnapuram illustrate a great number of these. The local nature and unprecedented depiction of many of these subjects make their identification difficult at this early stage in the study of later south Indian art.40 The inner enclosure at Krishnapuram houses two pairs of deities unusual before the sixteenth century but very com mon in the Nayaka period: Siva as Virabhadra, here embod ied in two forms (Figs. 5, 19), and Manmatha (or Kama) together with his consort Rati. These three deities appear as large-scale figural composite columns in Nayaka-period tem ples all across the Tamil country. Virabhadra is a fierce form</page><page sequence="16">185 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 19 Composite column of VTrabhadra holding sword and kombu (horn), on north side of inner corridor, Verikit?calapati tem ple (photograph by the author) 20 Manmatha (Kama) composite column, south side, inner corridor, Verikit?calapati temple (photograph by the author) of Siva, created in anger after he had been insulted by Daksa and the latter's daughter SatI, Siva's consort, had killed her self. VTrabhadra destroyed Daksa's sacrifice in a frenzy. After VTrabhadra killed Daksa and severed his head, Daksa was reborn with a goat's head. VTrabhadra is manifested as a menacing, energetic figure, usually two- but sometimes eight or ten-armed, with a sword in one hand. In another hand he holds either a small shield or musical instrument, perhaps the crescent-shaped horn (kombu).41 In Nayaka-period tem ples columns with two versions of VTrabhadra, named Agni and Aghora VTrabhadra, sometimes described as brothers, are often placed either opposite or next to each other. On the south side at Krishnapuram the mustached VTrabhadra raises a shield above his left shoulder and points a sword held in his right hand down to the ground; a garland of small heads is draped across his thigh (Fig. 5). On the north side this figure holds the musical instrument in his raised left hand and a sword in his right, both now broken (Fig. 19) .42 The royal figure alongside him holds a wn? (a stringed instrument) in his right hand. VTrabhadra, although rarely depicted in the sculpture of earlier periods in Tamil Nadu, was commonly worshiped in the Deccan.43 When Telugu speakers from the eastern Dec can migrated south in large numbers beginning in the fif teenth century, they most likely brought with them their worship of Virabhadra. Settling in Tamil Nadu as far south as the Tirunelveli region,44 they came as both agriculturalists, settling in previously marginal areas, and as warriors, eventu ally exerting considerable power as the later Nayaka dynasties of the seventeenth century. Virabhadra's cult attained con siderable popularity at Vijayanagara about this time; many shrines to the deity were established there, and a major Virabhadra temple was built at Lepakshi farther south be tween 1530 and 1542.45 Virabhadra composite columns are found in temples across the southern districts of Tamil Nadu?at Krishnapuram, Madurai, Tattikompu, Srivilliputtur, Tenkasi, Tirunelveli, Srivaikuntam, Tirukkurunkudi, Tiruvattar, Avadaiyarkoyil, and Ramesvaram.46 Even though there are few temples dedicated to Virabhadra, the distribution of columns of this deity suggests a link with this Telugu migra tion. The move from north to south resulted in a change in iconography: the passive stance of Deccani sculptures of Virabhadra is replaced by the energetic postures of the much larger Tamil Nayaka-period figural columns. Manmatha and Rati, the god and goddess of erotic love,</page><page sequence="17">BUILDING SACRED SPACE IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY SOUTH INDIA \gj 21 Rati composite column, north side, inner corridor, Venkit?calapati temple (photograph by the author) are the second-most common figural composite columns in Nayaka-period Tamil Nadu, after those of the yali and horse man. They are usually placed together, either facing across an aisle, as at Krishnapuram, or next to each other at the entrance to a mandapa. Manmatha is generally depicted in a fashion similar to the many active warriors, standing with a bow in one hand. In this instance, however, the bow is made of sugarcane (Fig. 20). In two examples in Rancipuram in northern Tamil Nadu, Manmatha rides a large parakeet, but in the more widespread sculptures in southern Tamil Nadu he is shown stepping forward holding a sugarcane bow in one hand and a flower arrow in the other, often riding in a four-columned chariot (ratha). Although at Krishnapuram he does not ride in a ratha, he is attended by two women, one of whom holds a parasol. His consort Rati is almost uniformly shown riding on a mythical bird (hamsa), holding a mirror in one hand and a flower in the other. Sculptors often paid great attention to the detail in the feathers of Rati's mount or her jewelry: a small hole in Rati's nose in the fine example at Krishnapuram is apparently for the addition of a separate ornament (Fig. 21). Whereas sculptures of these two deities featured occasionally in earlier Tamil art, their prevalence in the Nayaka period is striking. Manmatha is also associated with Vasanta, Spring, personified as an attendant. The cele bration of Vasanta festivals appears to have become more common in this period in southern India, and specific struc tures for their celebration began to be built.47 One also sees in Nayaka-period composite columns an increased emphasis on figures from the epics the R?m?yana and the Mah?bh?rata and on figures drawn from local Tamil folk myths and literature. All the remaining figures at Krish napuram fit into this broad category. Figural composite col umns in southern Tamil Nadu are distinguished by the great numbers of figures that are locally identified as based on the Mah?bh?rata. This immense epic poem, compiled in its present form between the fourth century BCE and the fourth century CE, recounts the rivalry between two families, the Kauravas and the P?ndavas, for control of northern India. The Sanskrit versions of the epic are complemented by a host of regional tellings, all of which have been, and continue to be, a source of inspiration in the arts and literature. The Mah?bh?rata was not new to sixteenth-century Tamil Nadu. References to the epic can be found in several earlier sources: Tamil texts of the fourth to sixth centuries; the Cahkam 22 Kama, festival hall in outer enclosure of Venkit?calapati temple (photograph by the author)</page><page sequence="18">183 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 23 Arjuna, festival hall in outer enclosure of Vehkit?calapati temple (photograph by the author) literature (the earliest body of literature in Tamil) and the Cilappatik?ram; a mid-ninth-century Tamil version composed by Peruntevanar, only a portion of which survives; an inscrip tion of 1210 from the Vat?ranyesvara temple at Tiruvalankatu that refers to the donor, possibly an officer of Kulottunka III, who was said to have translated "the Paratam into sweet Tamil"; and the finest of all Tamil versions, the Villip?ratam, composed by a Vaisnava Brahmin, Villiputturar (or Villiput tur Alvar) about 1400.48 Like the regional versions of the R?m?yana, these texts incorporate folk themes and thus ex press a distinct Tamil understanding of the Mah?bh?rata. While the Mah?bh?rata itself may not have been new to Nayaka-period Tamil Nadu, depicting the main figures from it in major sculpture certainly was. Among the figures from the Mah?bh?rata at Krishnapuram are Arjuna and Kama, famed archers, whose combat occu pies a central place in the Karnaparvan, the eighth book of the epic. They appear next to each other in the entrance to the festival hall, Kama, on the west side, with a broken bow in his left hand and a snake held up high in his right hand (Fig. 22), and Arjuna, on the east, with a bow and arrow (Fig. 23). The snake in Kama's hand is the miraculous and most deadly weapon the n?g?stra (snake arrow), which he fired at the height of the battle. Arjuna was saved by his divine charioteer Krsna, who lowered their chariot so that the arrow hit only Arjuna's headdress.49 Also drawn from the Mahabh?rata is Arjuna's brother BhTma, who is identified by his club. Architectural sculpture of southern Tamil Nadu often features the battle between BhTma and a lion-legged figure also armed with a club, called Purusamrga (Sanskrit, "man-beast"; in Tamil, Purusamirukam), occasion ally portrayed with another warrior with a club. This fight is shown either on facing columns or in several examples as figures encircling a single column, as at Krishnapuram (Fig. 24). The myth is not in Sanskrit versions of the Mahabh?rata and is a local Tamil folk theme.50 Though the Purusamrga alone?a composite half man-half animal?is represented in earlier relief sculpture, the fight between him and BhTma appears in Tamil sculpture only in the sixteenth century, often on a large scale as at Krishnapuram and restricted to the southern districts of the Tamil country. Other good examples can be seen at nearby Madurai, Tirunelveli, and in a cluster just south of Tirunelveli at Kalakkad, Tirukku runkudi, and Nanguneri. The third figure on the column with BhTma and Puru samrga is Yudhisthira. To fulfill an important ritual, Yudhis thira needed the milk of Purusamrga, a devotee of Siva, who 24 Fight between Bhima and Purusamrga, south side, inner corridor, Vehkit?calapati temple (photograph by the author)</page><page sequence="19">BUILDING SACRED SPACE IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY SOUTH INDIA IgO, 25 MTnaksi/Rambha, festival hall, Vehkitacalapati temple (photograph by the author) lived in the forest. Yudhisthira's younger brother Bhlma ob tained the milk while Purusamrga was performing a deep penance, or meditation; when the latter realized the offense, he gave angry chase. The P?ndava prince was captured and could not escape Purusamrga's powerful grip, and so called on Yudhisthira to adjudicate the dispute. At Krishnapuram Bhlma and Purusamrga spread around two sides of the monolithic composite column, waving their clubs; Yudhisthira stands on the other side passing judgment with one finger held upright. Three images of women at Krishnapuram may be related to these epic figures: one opposite the BhTma-Purusamrga col umn in the inner enclosure and the women at either end of the porch of the festival hall. The former stands in a relaxed dance posture (catura) with one hand on her hip and her right hand raised with the index finger pointing up (s?dmitdr?); 2l grotesque knock-kneed clown with a toothy grin, holding a club and a bird, appears to her right. The two women in the mandapa are difficult to identify but may relate to the central scene, the conflict between Arjuna and Kama. At first glance, both look like dancers, but the presence of objects in their hands and similar figures in nearby temples indicate that they can be identified more specifically. The figure at the east end, who holds a par tially broken flower garland in her hands, may be Draupadi offering a garland to her favored husband, Arjuna, after his defeat of Karna; a similar group of figures at nearby Tirukkurunkudi is identified as these characters from the Mahabh?rata. Whereas Draupadi is well known in pan Indian, Sanskrit literature as the wife of the five P?ndavas, she became a significant folk deity in northern Tamil Nadu from the fourteenth century. The rise of regionally based, folk cults in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries may explain the appearance of such a goddess in the period's sculpture.51 The woman at the west end holds small objects in each hand, perhaps a small flower in her right and a fruit in her raised left (Fig. 25). If the "fruit" is identified as a small breast with the nipple pointing up, this figure may be MTn?ksT, a warrior goddess born with three breasts who lost the third when she met her future husband Sundaresvara, a form of Siva. The myth of MTn?ksT was central to the Madurai Nayakas, who ruled as regents of this powerful goddess. They celebrated the myth in festi vals, as do their successors to this day. Installing two powerful goddesses, Draupadi and MTn?ksT, 26 Kuravan kidnapping a princess, festival hall, Venkit?calapati temple (photograph by the author)</page><page sequence="20">190 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 27 Kuratti kidnapping a prince, festival hall, Vehkitacalapati temple (photograph by the author) at either end of the mandapa makes sense in the broad context of Madurai Nayaka patronage in southern Tamil Nadu. An alternative identification, however, suggested by modern worshipers at the site, links the woman at the western end more closely with the iconographic themes of the mandapa as a whole. This figure could be Rambh?, one of the most beautiful of the apsar?s, the celestial beauties and dancers of the gods dwelling in Indra's heavenly paradise, Svarga. When Arjuna lived in Svarga as the goddess Indra's guest during his twelve-year exile in the forest, Rambh? danced in honor of Arjuna on the occasion of his birthday.52 If she is Rambh?, then the identification and meaning of the objects in her hands remain unclear. The emphasis on local, folk sources is continued by the final pair of sculptures at the front of the festival hall. These depict, in the center of the west side, a well-dressed man with a mustache, holding a sword and bow, abducting a smaller woman, who pulls a cape over her head (Fig. 26). The paired figure in the center of the east side shows the reverse: a larger woman holding a small bird in her right hand running off with a smaller man on her shoulders who is clutching a sword (Fig. 27). These figures are locally identified as a Kuravan kidnapping a princess and a Kuratti running off with a prince. The Kuravanci dance-drama featuring these characters was a productive genre of Tamil literature written between about 1680 and 1800, originally performed in temples during festi vals.53 The drama centers on two love affairs, linked by the Kuravanci or Kuratti, a woman from the Kuravar caste, who are sometimes described as gypsies, itinerant bird catchers, and fortune-tellers. In one part of the drama, the Kuratti tells the fortune of a high-caste woman who has fallen in love with a passing prince, while another episode centers on the Ku ratti's love for a man from her own group. Examples of the main protagonists feature in temple sculptures from the 1560s, thus reversing the expected relationship between text and image, notably in the thousand-column mandapa at Ma durai, at Tirunelveli, and at Tirukkurunkudi, where the Kura van and Kuratti are presented as individual sculptures. The incidence of these sculptures in temples of the sixteenth century again reflects the migration of new social groups through southern India and the increasing representation of previously marginal groups in the public sphere. Although these kidnapping themes do not feature in the later literary portraits of these groups in the Kuravanci dance-drama, the accuracy of the local identification is demonstrated by other sculptural details. A central narrative in the Kuravanci drama involves a Kuratti reading the palm of another woman: this event is sculpted on the back of one of the columns at Krishnapuram (Fig. 28) .54 ^^^^V HSM 28 Kuratti reading the palm of another woman on rear of Kuratti composite column, Venkit?calapati temple (photo graph by the author)</page><page sequence="21">BUILDING SACRED SPACE IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY SOUTH INDIA ICjl 29 Virabhadra with sword and kombu (horn), festival hall in third enclosure of Kallapir?n temple, Srivaikuntam (photo graph by the author) How was the iconographic program at Krishnapuram as a whole viewed by an audience of both pilgrims and deities in procession? Devotees entering the temple through the gate way are struck first by the huge figures bursting from the festival hall's front columns. Going through the interior en closure toward the main shrine, worshipers are flanked by the columns paired across the aisle. These sculptures are also seen by the deities in procession, who emerge from the main shrine during festivals and enter the festival hall for a short period of hours or days. The sculptures illustrate two related emphases: the importance of regional Tamil traditions of art and myth and the large number of characters drawn from the Mah?bh?rata. Although no two Hindu temples are the same, the architectural design and the style and subjects of the architectural sculpture may be shared with nearby temples. For example, at Alvar Tirunagari composite columns of Ar juna and the dancing woman are very like those at Krishna puram; at Srivaikuntam there is a similar pair of VTrabhadras across the front of the larger festival hall (Fig. 29); at Tiruk kurunkudi Karna and Arjuna (Fig. 30) appear alongside the figures identified at Krishnapuram as Draupadi and Mln?ksl/ Rambh?. The similarity of subject matter, scale, and style suggests that these architectural sculptures, and indeed the mandapas they are part of, all date to about the same period in the late sixteenth century and were perhaps created by the same group of sculptors. Even if the 6V2-foot-(2-meter-) high figures sculpted on the composite columns are clearly the boldest, most striking sculptures in the temple at Krishnapuram, they do not con stitute its sole ornamentation. The majority of the surfaces of the flat columns bear a relief of a human or divine figure, an animal, or a pattern; as each shaft has three cubical blocks, there are twelve surfaces for reliefs per column. The great variety of subjects is entirely consistent with similar temples built at Vijayanagara, yet the reliefs at Krishnapuram are in deeper relief and the figures correspondingly more rounded. A detail of these reliefs confirms a date in the 1560s for the entire temple at Krishnapuram. All the small royal figures depicted in the temple?in the gopura's gateway, the festival hall, the corridor before the main shrine (Fig. 5), and those before the goddess shrines?wear the tall, conical cloth cap with a rounded top called a kul?yi This form of cap, which is derived from a Persian form of headwear, the cloth kul?h, was worn by south Indian kings only from the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century.55 In the early seventeenth century royal figures began to wear a tighter-fitting cloth cap. This detail argues against dating the composite columns much 30 Draupadi composite column, cruciform entrance hall in third enclosure of Alakiya Nampir?yar Perum?l temple, Tirukkurunkudi (photograph by the author)</page><page sequence="22">292 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 later than the plainer main shrine. Even if construction spread over a decade or more, the temple at Krishnapuram was entirely built in the 1560s and 1570s. The artists at Krishnapuram can be seen to have taken sculptural genres known at the capital of the empire, the reliefs on columns and the innovative composite columns, and adapted them to a new geographic and political context?one that is Tamil, located in the deep south, and set after the disastrous defeat of Vijayanagara in 1565 that led to the rise in power of the Nayakas. Commemoration and Innovation in Nayaka South India The construction of the Hindu Venkit?calapati temple at Krishnapuram in the 1560s created a new sacred site on the frontier of the rapidly disintegrating Vijayanagara Empire, a frontier far distant from the capital and on the cusp of a new political and cultural era in southern India. This temple is noteworthy for the clearly dated inscriptions outlining its foundation and the patronage by the regional rulers, the Madurai Nayakas. In the three dated inscriptions from the site and in the architectural and sculptural design of this new temple, its artists and patrons demonstrate their engagement with both the immediate Vijayanagara imperial past and with the older, local Tamil past. The deliberately multilayered meanings of this temple, drawn from the material evidence of the building itself rather than from Sanskrit texts, cannot be stripped down to simply stating that the Hindu temple serves as an image of cosmic form. The conscious archaism of the main shrine, built in an architectural tradition one thousand years old, overtly expresses a connection with the past and commemorates it. This is a primordial past, evoking the structure of the universe and Visnu's heavenly abode, but is specifically the sacred past of the founding figures of Tamil devotionalism, the Alv?rs of the sixth to ninth centuries. The temple at Krishnapuram, as a "copy" of a more famous tem ple, the Verikatesvara at Tirupati further north, aimed to arouse the religious associations, charisma, and power ema nating from the latter. The Madurai Nayaka patrons of this temple were also aware of the political dimension of temple patronage, an association expressed not only in the written word of inscrip tions but also visually in the choice and deployment of archi tectural and iconographic motifs. The temple at Krishna puram, like its patrons, connects with both the Pandyan imperial past of southern Tamil Nadu and the more recent past of the fragmenting Vijayanagara Empire. Various con notations are present in an Indian temple such as Krishna puram that "vibrate," to paraphrase Krautheimer, in the mind of the sensitive observer. Such layering of meaning recalls the Indian literary concept of Slesa, or double enten dre. Both the architects and patrons of south Indian temples must be considered as active agents in making their contri bution with regard to the location and design of their tem ples, in a wider sacred, political, and artistic landscape. The widely acknowledged increasing ornamental nature of south Indian temple design is not a passive linear process from earlier to later periods. Architects and patrons make choices, even in a deeply conservative tradition such as Hindu temple architecture. The commemoration of the past?primordial, Tamil Vaisnava, Pandyan, and Vijayanagara?accompanied significant artistic innovation, as is most clearly demonstrated in the architec tural sculpture of this temple. But this innovation was re served for the outermost sections of the temple, those at a distance from the sacred core of the main shrine. A tendency among some scholars of Indian temple architecture to dis cuss the main shrine in detail and then dismiss the surround ing structures as later additions or of lesser interest belies the scale, innovation, ritual, and artistic interest taken in the additional shrines, corridors, halls, and gateways of the de veloped south Indian temple. The temple at Krishnapuram is important evidence for the cultural dynamism of the late sixteenth century in the Tamil country, despite the apparent political and military weaknesses of the Nayaka rulers them selves. For the temple has dated examples of an innovative new form of architectural sculpture, the monolithic compos ite columns with six- to nine-foot-high figures of deities and other figures attached. The subjects depicted, especially the emphasis on figures from the epic Mah?hh?rata and local folk literature, illustrate the temple builders' concern with both long-established cultural forms and new artistic currents in this period of south India's history. Far from being an era of stagnant late medieval culture at the tail end of the Vijaya nagara Empire, whose cultural vitality is now acknowledged, the Nayaka period in the Tamil country, with its great expan sion of temple construction and its new artistic forms, can claim to be a dynamic cultural period in its own right.

The myth of Lirigodbhava concerns the emergence of Siva from within a great column or linga of fire to quell the pride of Brahma and Visnu. In sculpture, Siva in anthropomorphic form steps out of an oval frame ringed by flames from within a cylindrical column; small images of Brahma and Visnu are sometimes placed above and below, fruitlessly seeking the limits of this aWesome divine power. Visnu in his man-lion form as Narasirhha saves the pious devotee Prahl?da from his antigod father, Hiranyakasipu, who had usurped the authority of the gods. Hiranyakasipu challenged jPrahl?da's faith in Visnu by saying that if he was supreme and all-pervading then he must even be in a column of the palace. When Hiranyakasipu kicked the nearest one, the column split open to reveal Visnu i n his terrifying form as Narasirhha, who promptly tore Hiranyakasipu apart. The myth is usually depicted with Hiranyakasipu lying across Narasirhha's lap, sometimes with the split halves of the column behind them. 9. The existing scholarly literature on the architecture and sculpture of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Tamil temple is still limited. Many major sites have scarcely been described, let alone critically stud ied.

Further information about Krishnappa's activities in southern Tamil Nadu is recorded in a Tamil text published by William Taylor in the 1830s. It states that Krishnappa built a town called after himself, Krish napuram, and there "he built a Saiva temple, a Vaisnava temple, and agraras [agrah?ras, Brahmin settlements]; had a terpacolam [teppakulam, water-filled tank for the float festival] dug; and furnished the town with every other customary appurtenance." Only the Vaisnava temple survives, the subject of this article. The text also records that he built a similar town west of Tirunelveli, though no trace remains of this. Krishnappa's founda tion of Krishnapuram was clearly significant to the Tamil author, for little else is mentioned from his eight-year reign. See Taylor, Oriental Historical Manuscripts in the Tamil Language (Madras: Charles Josiah Taylor, 1835), vol. 2, 23. An inscription recording a gift of land to the Nellaiyappar tem ple in Saka 1483 (1561/62) at Tirunelveli records Krishnappa's patronage of temples in this region earlier than his foundation of Krishnapuram, and before the death of his father in 1564; see Annual Report on Epigraphy/ Archaeological Survey of Madras, no. 121 (1894). 17. The practice of architectural copies is well known in medieval Europe, as Krautheimer, "Introduction," emphasized with the key example of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The first major Islamic monument, the Dome of the Rock, also in Jerusalem (built 691-92), has also been copied across the Muslim world: see Grabar, "The Iconography of Is lamic Architecture"; and Ebba Koch, The Complete Taj Mahal and the Riverfront Gardens of Agra (London: Thames and Hudson, 2006), 125. The Mahabodhi temple marking the site of the Buddha's enlighten ment at Bodhgaya in eastern India has also been reproduced, both as full-scale buildings in Nepal, Burma, and Thailand and as miniature pilgrimage souvenirs, physically embodying the sacred charisma of the site across Buddhist Asia; Janice Leoshko, ed., Bodhgaya: The Site of En lightenment (Bombay: Marg Publications, 1988). Hinduism does not have such an established, hierarchical sacred geography as Christianity, Buddhism, or indeed Islam, and so the choice of architectural copy, like the nature of the Hindu sacred, is more diffuse. 18. But why did Krishnappa choose Krishnapuram as the location for a new temple? One likely explanation is that Krishnapuram is on a trade and pilgrimage route along the Tamraparni River. A major group of nine Vaisnava temples, collectively known as the Navatirupati (Nine Tirupatis) and including the Kallapir?n at Srivaikuntam and the ?din?tha at Alvar Tirunagari, is situated on either side of the river to the east, halfway between Tirunelveli and the great Murukan (or Subramanya) temple by the sea at Tiruchendur. 19. Vehkit?calapati at Krishnapuram is the modern Tamil spelling of the same deity.

For example, Krishnappa's father, Vishvanatha, is described as the agent of Ramaraya, in two inscriptions from Mannarkoyil and Melach chewal dated respectively Saka 1480 (1558/59) and Saka 1472 (1550/ 51); see Annual Report on Epigraphy, nos. 385, 599 (1916). 23.

There is no need to invoke "Western influence" for the supposed in creased naturalism of these sixteenth-century and later architectural sculptures, as A. V. Jeyechandrun has suggested, particularly of new subjects such as the royal portraits and "gypsies" (kuratti) discussed be low. See Jeyechandrun, The Madurai Temple Complex (with Special Refer ence to Literature and Legends) (Madurai: Madurai Kamaraj University, 1985), 296. A clear example of Western influence on this genre of south Indian sculpture may be observed at the Sharada temple at Sringeri in southwest Karnataka. This temple, built about 1906 by In dian artists trained in the British-established Madras School of Art who had just finished working with the architect Henry Irwin on the new palace at Mysore, includes four approximately six-foot-high Hindu god desses sculpted in the manner of images of Britannia or Queen Victo ria. 41.
