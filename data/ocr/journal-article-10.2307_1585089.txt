<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHO WEEPS IN JEREMIAH VIII 23 (IX 1)?' IDENTIFYING DRAMATIC SPEAKERS IN THE POETRY OF JEREMIAH by JOSEPH M. HENDERSON Indianapolis Introduction Jeremiah is often called the weeping prophet, and although this characterization is primarily based on the well-known laments in chap- ters xi-xx, it finds its most dramatic expression in Jer. viii 23: "O that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears so that I might weep day and night for the slain of my Daughter People!" This verse and others like it have traditionally been held to express the anguish of the prophet. However, at least since the work of A. Heschel, these verses have also been said to express the pathos of God.2 This situation raises the question: "Who does weep in Jer. viii 23: Jeremiah or Yahweh?" Some, including Heschel, are content to have it both ways: both Jeremiah and Yahweh weep. Thus W. Brueggemann can write that in Jer. viii 23, "Yahweh/Jeremiah dissolves in tears of love and anger."3 The idea is that the prophet and God are so completely identified that their speeches in the poetry are indistinguishable. As W. Rudolph depicts it, the "I" of the prophet and the "I" of God run together like paints in a watercolor.4 This understanding is closely related to the i Jer. viii 23 in the MT is ix 1 in the Vulgate and several English translations (e.g., KJV, NRSV, REB, and NIV). 2 A.

HENDERSON old form-critical conception of the poetry as a collection of oracles in which the prophet is a mere messenger or mouthpiece of God. If the prophet is not an independent speaker, there is no reason to distin- guish his speech from God's. Distinguishing speakers is more pressing for readings that recognize the dramatic quality of the poetry. These readings challenge the older messenger-speech conception as inadequate to explain numerous poetic passages in which there is a clear distinction between speeches of Jeremiah and Yahweh. For example, several of the well-known laments present Jeremiah complaining to Yahweh and Yahweh answering in rebuke (xii 1-6, xiv 7-10, xiv 19-xv 4, xv 15-21). Passages like these raise the possibility of reading the poetry as dramatic dialogue in which Jeremiah and Yahweh are independent speakers with independent points of view and independent speeches. W. Holladay, a pioneer in this new dramatic reading, identifies the various speakers in the mar- gins of his translation like the characters in the margins of a drama- tic text. Among the proponents of a dramatic reading, there is disagreement concerning the identity of the weeping speaker in Jer. vii 23. Holladay supports the traditional portrait of the weeping prophet and designates Jeremiah as the weeping speaker.5 M. Biddle, on the other hand, argues that the speaker is not Jeremiah but Yahweh.6 By assigning this pas- sage and others like it to God, Biddle extends Heschel's characteriza- tion of God as full of sympathy. At the same time, by taking these passages away from the prophet, he intentionally diminishes the tra- ditional characterization of the prophet. Resolving this disagreement about the weeping speaker is critical for a dramatic reading. The poetry cannot be read as drama without consistent characterization and objec- tive criteria for identifying speakers. 5 Holladay, Jeremiah I, p. 288. 6 M.

It will contend that the concerns and diction of this speech (and several others that Biddle assigns to Yahweh) are not consistent with the character of Yahweh portrayed in Jer. ii-xx. The intent is not merely to refute Biddle's claim (which has won little support), but to challenge the com- mon assumption that the speech of Yahweh and the speech ofJeremiah cannot be distinguished. The attempt to clarify the characterization of Jeremiah and Yahweh and to provide objective literary criteria for identifying their speeches is meant to lend support to reading Jeremiah ii-xx as dramatic poetry. Biddle's identification of speakers in viii 18-ix 2 To identify the speaker in Jer. viii 23, its place in Jer. viii 18-ix 2 must be considered. The whole passage is characterized by unmarked shifts in speaker, which suggest dramatic dialogue. Biddle identifies the speakers as follows: THWH (viii 18-19a): My joy is gone, grief is upon me, my heart is sick. Hark, the cry of my poor people from far and wide in the land: People (viii 19b): "Is the Lord not in Zion? Is her King not in her?" YHWH (viii 19c): Why then have they provoked me to anger with their images, with their foreign idols? People (viii 20): "The harvest is past, the summer is ended and we are not saved." YHWH (viii 21): For the hurt of my poor people, I am hurt, I mourn and dismay has taken hold of me. People (viii 22a): "Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there?" YHWH (viii 22b): Why then has the health of my poor people not been restored? (viii 23) O that my head were a spring of water, and my eyes a fountain of tears, 193</page><page sequence="4">JOSEPH M. HENDERSON so that I might weep day and night for the slain of my poor people. (ix 1) 0 that I had in the desert a traveler's lodging place, that I might leave my people and go away from them!7 The novelty of Biddle's reading is that Jeremiah does not speak. Biddle reassigns all the speeches traditionally thought to be spoken by Jeremiah to either Yahweh or the people. He contends that the Masoretic text "offers little reason to assign any of the passage ... to the prophet."8 Distinguishing bat-'ammi from 'ammi In Biddle's central arguments for excluding the prophet's voice from Jer. viii 12-ix 2, he points out that the diction is reminiscent of other speeches in Jeremiah that he believes are spoken by Yahweh.9 Biddle notes, first, that the term "my people" ('ammi), which occurs five times in the passage, often occurs outside the passage in God's speech, and second, that viii 23 closely parallels xiv 17-18, which he says is clearly spoken by God.'? The evidence he offers for this connection is com- mon diction: "eyes run down day and night," "virgin daughter of my people," and "wound." In these observations Biddle is on solid foot- ing: this diction and its recurrence in similar passages are crucial for identifying the speakers. Biddle's misstep comes in his treatment of the term 'ammi, "my peo- ple." He fails to distinguish between the term 'ammi, which occurs by 7 Biddle, Polyphony, p. 30. Biddle does not include viii 23b-ix 2 in his identification, but it is clear that he believes it to be spoken by Yahweh. The translation is that of the VRSV, which will be used as the base translation for other Biblical citations. "Poor people" will be consistently emended to "Daughter People" and "the Lord" to "Yahweh." 8 Biddle, Polyphony, p. 29. 9 Biddle's efforts to exclude Jeremiah by limiting the number of possible speakers is unconvincing. He first argues that Jeremiah cannot speak because the passage can only have one speaker ("MT explicitly identifies God and God only as the speaker" [Polyphony, p. 29]). Then, on the very next page, he argues that Jeremiah cannot speak because the passage can only have two speakers (it "resembles the dialogue inJeremiah 4 exhibiting... only two participants [i.e., God and the people]" [ibid., p. 30]). Biddle's argument for only two speakers is not only inconsistent with his first argument but also with his earlier treatment of Jeremiah iv, in which he argues that Jeremiah can- not speak because the passage can only have three speakers (it is a "dialogue between God, the people, and Jerusalem" [ibid., p. 22]). '0 Biddle, Polyphony, p. 30. 194</page><page sequence="5">WHO WEEPS IN JEREMIAH VIII 23 itself only once in the passage (in ix 1), and the distinct term bat-'ammi, which occurs four times in the passage (viii 19, 21, 22, and 23). Although both terms refer to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, 'ammi pictures them as group of individuals (regularly treated as a masculine plural noun), but bat-'ammz personifies them as an individual woman (the subject of feminine singular verbs in vi 26 and xiv 17). Bat-'ammi, which translated literally is "my Daughter People," appears to be a term of endearment or pet name."1 In the NRSV (used above), the translation "my poor people" accentuates the term's connotation of sympathy but obscures its evocation of a female character. The literal translation "my Daughter People" will be used below to distinguish bat-'ammi from 'ammi. The significance of the distinction becomes clear when one notes that in Jeremiah bat-'ammi almost always occurs in speeches which express sympathy for the people (e.g., xiv 18, "Let my eyes run down with tears... for the virgin, my Daughter People, is smitten with a great wound;" also vi 26, and viii 11). The term 'ammz, on the other hand, often occurs in speeches which harshly criticize the people (e.g., iv 22 "my people are foolish, they know me not"; also ii 11, 13, 31, 32, v 31, viii 7, xv 7, xviii 15). Now if the 29 occurrences of 'ammi in Jeremiah are considered apart from the occurrences of bat-'ammi, it can be seen that for every occurrence there is a good case for iden- tifying God as the speaker.'2 In the present passage, this means that God can quite confidently be identified as the speaker of ix 1: "O... that I might leave my people." However, the speaker of the four speeches employing bat-'ammi (viii 19, 21, 22, and 23) cannot be judged by lumping them together with the 'ammi passage as Biddle does. The term bat-'ammi, which occurs four times in the present passage, occurs only fifteen times in the whole Hebrew Bible (Isa. xxii 4; Jer. iv 11, vi 14, 26, viii 11, 19, 21, 22, 23, xiv 17; Lam. ii 11, iii 48, iv 3, 6, 10).13 Significantly, in almost all of the ten passages in which the " W. Stinespring, "No Daughter of Zion: A Study of the Appositional Genitive in Hebrew Grammar," Encounter 26 (1965), pp. 133-141. 12 The occurrence of 'ammi in the MT vi 14 is better read as bat-'ammi in accor- dance with the doublet of the passage in viii 11, many Hebrew manuscripts, and sev- eral versions including the Hexapla, Syriac, Targum, Vulgate, and Symmachus. See note 20. 13 The occurrence of bat-'ammi in the MT of Jer. ix 6 (English ix 7) is not included because it seems to be the result of a textual corruption. On the basis of the LXX and Targum, Rudolph aptly proposes it be read as ra'atam, "their evil." On the other 195</page><page sequence="6">JOSEPH M. HENDERSON term occurs, it is accompanied by themes and diction similar or iden- tical to those Biddle identified as connecting viii 18-ix 2 and xiv 17- 18. All of the passages refer to a great destruction or wound (often seber [7x] or sod [2x]) that has been, or will be, inflicted on Daughter People. Four of the passages grieve over the extent of the destruction with references to the slain (hdldlim), and four lament that the wound cannot be healed (rdpa' [3x]) or has no healer (rpe' [lx]). All but three use the language of weeping with the recurring terms "sackcloth" (saq [2x]), "tears" (dim'a [3x]), and the speaker's "eye" that pours "water" ('ayin and mayim [2x]). Finally, most of these passages blame the prophets and priest (kohen [4x] and nabz' [5x]) for their failure to help. The fol- lowing chart illustrates these recurrences.14 Bat-'ammi Verses "Wound"/"Destruction" "Tears" Priests and Prophets "Slain" "Eye" "Water" Blamed "Heal"/"Physician" "Sackcloth" "Weep" Isa. xxii 4 sod (4) haladlm (2) bdka (4) Jer. iv 11 Implicit (10) vi 14 seber (14) rapa' (14) kohen nabF' (13) vi 26 6sd'5 (26) iaq (26) viii 11 seber (11) rapa' (11) kohen nabz' (10) viii 19, 21, 22, 23 seber (21) haladlm (23) dim'a (23) baka (23) Implicit (22) rape' (22) 'ayin mayim (23) xiv 17 seber (17) hadldlm (18) dim'd (17) kjhen ndbi' (18) Lam. ii 11 seber (11) rapd' (13) dim'a (11) saq (10) nabF' (14) iii 48 seber (48) 'ayin mayim (48) iv 3, 6, 10 seber (10) hala/lm (9) kohen nabf' (13) The evidence gathered here demonstrates graphically what any reader who compared these passages would notice: a striking similarity in dic- tion, content, and tone. This similarity should provide a broader base for considering the question of speaker. Although it cannot be assumed that these passages have the same speaker, it does seem likely that their common diction and themes indicate speakers with similar per- spectives and concerns. hand, Jer. vi 14 is included because although the MT has only 'ammz its doublet in Jer. viii 11 and many manuscripts have bat-'ammi. See previous note. 14 The verses where the terms occur are indicated in parentheses. 15 Sod (destruction) is the reading suggested by the LXX. The MT has soded (destroyer). 196</page><page sequence="7">WHO WEEPS IN JEREMIAH VIII 23 The bat-'ammi passages in Lamentations The identity of the speaker in all six of the bat-'ammf passages in Jeremiah is under dispute: Biddle, in opposition to the traditional inter- pretations, claims that all of them are spoken by Yahweh. It seems reasonable, then, to turn to the three bat-'ammi passages in Lamentations to help settle the debate. Against Biddle's position, the evidence in Lamentations all weighs against reading God as the speaker. First, none of the bat-'ammi passages in Lamentations has God as its speaker. God does not speak at all in Lamentations but instead is routinely spoken about or spoken to. Second, regarding the wound or destruc- tion (seber) that recurs in almost all of the bat-'ammi passages, Lamenta- tions strongly suggests that it has been inflicted by God. For example, the first part of Lam. ii, which climaxes in the first bat-'ammi passage (ii 11), recalls how Yahweh has "destroyed without mercy" (ii 2); he has "bent his bow like an enemy," "slain all the pride of our eyes," "poured out his fury like fire" (ii 4), and "determined to lay in ruins the walls of Daughter Zion" (ii 8). Third, regarding the weeping and sackcloth in the bat-'ammi passages, Lamentations indicates that their purpose is to awaken God's sympathy and cause him to relent from his destruction. Immediately after the second bat-'ammi passage (iii 48), the speaker continues, "My eyes will flow without ceasing, without respite, until Yahweh from heaven looks down and sees." In another place, the speaker uses the same language as Jer. viii 23 and xiv 17 in urging Daughter Zion to pray: "Cry aloud to Yahweh, O Daughter Zion, let your eyes stream down like a torrent day and night, give yourself no rest, your eyes no respite" (ii 18). What the three bat-'ammf passages in Lamentations suggest is that the vocabulary, diction, tone, and concerns of these passages are not characteristic of Yahweh's speech, but rather the speech of one who positions himself against Yahweh in complaint. In contrast to the wrath- ful God who destroys without mercy (ii 2), the speaker weeps over the destruction of his Daughter People (ii 11). The speaker must cry with- out resting (iii 49) because God appears blind to the people's suffering (iii 50) and deaf to their prayers (iii 44). The character of Yahweh in Jeremiah ii-xx Now the question can be asked: is it likely that in Jeremiah God is the speaker of the kind of speeches that in Lamentations were aimed 197</page><page sequence="8">EYAL REGEV at winning the sympathy of a wrathful God? If the Yahweh of Lamentations inflicts the people's wound (seber), is it likely that the Yahweh of Jeremiah mourns over the wound of his Daughter People? A cursory review ofJer. ii-xx will reveal that the portrayal of God in Jeremiah differs little from the portrayal in Lamentations. In Jer. iv God says, "I am bringing evil from the north and great destruction (seber)." In chapters v and vi he summons destroyers to come and destroy his vineyard, to besiege Jerusalem, and he tells the prophet to pour out wrath on the children in the street. In chapters vii and xiv he tells Jeremiah not to pray for the people because, as he says in chapter xv, even Moses and Samuel could not turn his ear toward the people. In chapter viii he says he will send serpents to bite them, and in ix that he will give them wormwood and poisonous water to drink. In x he promises to bring distress on the people so that they will feel it, and in xi that though they cry to him he will not hear it. In xii he says that because his beloved has lifted up her voice against him he now hates her. In xiii he resolves not to pity, spare, or have compassion on the people. In xiv he declares that though the people fast and cry out he will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. In xv he will make them serve foreign enemies because in his anger a fire is kindled that will burn forever. In xvi he will hurl them from the land and show them no favor. In xviii he will turn his back to them in the day of calamity, and in xix he will break (s'abar) them as one breaks a potter's vessel. Throughout these chap- ters Yahweh is consistently portrayed as the wrathful deity who is bent on destroying his people and refuses to be moved to compassion by their cries.'6 The bat-'ammi passages in Jeremiah Biddle's attempt to read Yahweh as the speaker of the bat-'ammi passages in Jeremiah in opposition to the way similar passages func- 16 Admittedly there are a handful of passages that indicate that sometime in the future God will once again be merciful (iii 15-18, xii 14-17, xvi 14-18). Biddle also argues that five laments spoken by Yahweh in ii-xx show his sympathy (ix 10, ix 17- 19, xii 7-11, xiii 16-17, xv 5-9). However, only two of these are clearly spoken by Yahweh (xii 7-11 and xv 5-9), and both of them are remarkable not for their sym- pathy but for their bitter anger. In the first, God says of Jerusalem, "I hate her" (xii 8), and in the second, he says of her children, "I will give them to the sword before their enemies" (xv 9). 198</page><page sequence="9">PRIESTLY AND DEUTERONOMIC HOLINESS tion in Lamentations and the primary way Yahweh is portrayed in Jer. ii-xx requires that he produces strong counter-evidence in order to be convincing. The need for obvious evidence is especially sharp in passages of unmarked poetic dialogue in which readers must depend on consistent characterization to identify the speakers. Since the pri- mary reason Biddle gives for Yahweh speaking in viii 18-ix 2 is that he is the speaker of the parallel bat-'ammi passages in Jeremiah, these five passages must be examined to see if they can support his claim. The first bat-'ammi passage in iv 11-12 is unique because, unlike the other bat-'ammi passages, it is not a lament in poetry but a prophecy in prose. This explains why it does not exhibit the other characteris- tic terms. To identify the speaker, the passage must be examined in its context, iv 9-12. 9 On that day, [Yahweh's word, na'umyhwh], courage shall fail the king and the officials; the priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded. 10 Then I said, "Ah, Yahweh God, how utterly you have deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, "It shall be well with you,' even while the sword is at the throat!" 11 At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem: "A hot wind [comes] out of the bare heights in the desert, my Daughter People (bat-'ammi), not to winnow or cleanse-12 a wind too strong for that comes for me. 17 Now it is I who speak in judgment against them." The introduction to verses 11-12 is linked to verses 9-10 by the similar temporal phrases "In that day" (v. 9) and "At that time" (v. 11) and the unusual reference to "this people and Jerusalem" (w. 10, 11). The link is important because verse 10, which begins "Then I said," is one of the verses that most clearly introduces the independent voice of the prophet. In verse 10, the prophet complains to Yahweh about how he has treated the people (a common function of the bat-'ammi passages). The complaint seems to be that Yahweh has allowed the religious leadership to mislead the people, a complaint that fits well with the critique of priests and prophets in the bat-'ammi passages. In verses 11-12, the bat-'ammi passage, the identity of the speaker is only gradually revealed. The form of the passage, in which a tempo- ral phrase introduces a short prose prediction, is a common one in Jeremiah, occurring twenty-six times. However, while all the other 17 The NRSV gives the odd translation "from me" for If and rearranges the content of iv 11-12 apparently in an effort to make it possible for Yahweh to be the speaker. 199</page><page sequence="10">JOSEPH M. HENDERSON twenty-five occurrences use the formula "Yahweh's word" (na'um-yhwh) to indicate the speaker, this passage omits the formula and seems to intentionally leave the identity of the speaker ambiguous with the use of the agentless passive ("it shall be said"). The possibility that the prophecy is not spoken by Yahweh is strengthened when the speaker uses the sympathetic term bat-'ammi, which would be strange in the mouth of the wrathful God portrayed in the preceding verses. The identity of the speaker is fully revealed when he says that the judg- ment he is proclaiming "comes for me (l')." Who but the prophet both prophesies against the people and shares with the people in the judgment he prophesies? He concludes the passage, "Now even I ('atta gam-'dni) speak judgment against them." The force of the passage depends on the reader being shocked at the gradual realization that the prophet, who usually argues for the people (as in v. 10), has now joined in speaking judgment against them (v. 12). The second bat-'ammi passage in Jeremiah can be assigned to the prophet for a similar reason. Jer. vi 26 reads, O my Daughter People (bat-'ammf), put on sackcloth, and roll in ashes; make mourning as for an only child, most bitter lamentation: for (ki) suddenly [destruction, sod] will come upon us. In light of the discussion of Lamentations, the likely purpose of the weeping and sackcloth is to cause God to relent from destruction. This tells against identifying God as the speaker, but what is more significant is that, like the speaker of iv 12, the speaker of vi 26 includes him- self among those who will face the destroyer. This unique position of standing apart from the people in admonition and with the people in suffering fits the role of the prophet. In order to avoid this conclusion, Biddle translates the ki in the last line as a recitative so that the line becomes a quotation.'8 However, the so-called ki recitativum, which Biddle relies on, has been largely dis- credited. Based on four earlier studies of the particle ki, S. Meier coun- sels, "Because of its rarity one should consider other well-established uses before turning to its putative role in introducing D[irect] D[iscourse]." Furthermore, he concludes, "In every case where one follows this proce- dure, an equally if not more satisfying interpretation of the text is pos- 18 Biddle, Polyphony, p. 19. Biddle uses this same translation in iv 9 and vii 29 to allow Yahweh to be the speaker of speeches which would otherwise seem to indicate that the speaker is Jeremiah (ibid., p. 24). 200</page><page sequence="11">WHO WEEPS IN JEREMIAH VIII 23 sible."'9 In Jer. vi 26, the most common translation of ki (causative) works well. What makes the better-established use of ki unsatisfying to Biddle is that it points to Jeremiah as the speaker. The next two bat-'ammz passages in Jeremiah, vi 13-14 and its dou- blet in viii 1Ob-11,20 echo the diction and concerns of the other bat- 'ammi passages: an individual blames the priests and prophets for not healing the wound (seber) of his Daughter People. Surely (ki)21 from the least to the greatest everyone is greedy for unjust gain; from prophet to priest everyone deals falsely. They have treated the wound of my Daughter People (bat-'ammi) carelessly, saying, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace. Although a careful reader might recognize the diction and concerns of the speaker as those of the prophet, it is easier to miss his voice in this passage because Yahweh is clearly the speaker in vi 12 and 15 (and in viii 1Oa and 12), and there are no clear indications of a new speaker. However, the text of Jeremiah up to this point has prepared the competent reader to hear the prophet's reports on the people inter- rupting God's judgment speeches. The first two of these interruptions 19 S. Meier, Speaking of Speaking: Marking Direct Discourse in the Hebrew Bible (SVT 46; Leiden, New York, 1992), p. 20. The four studies Meier cites which argue against ki recitativum are F. Zorrell, "Gibt es im Hebraischen ein ki recitativum?", Biblica 14 (1933), pp. 465-69; S. Esh, "On Introductory Words Before Direct Discourse in Hebrew", Leshonenu 22 (1957), pp. 48-53 (Hebrew); A. Schoors, "The Particle ki", OtSt 21 (1981), pp. 246-76; and B. Bandstra, The Syntax of the Particle KY in Biblical Hebrew and Ugaritic. Ph.D. Dissertation, (Yale University, 1982). Schoors writes, "The ki recitativum as a specific syntactic category should be deleted from grammars and dictionaries" ("The Particle ki," pp. 258-59). 20 N. Lee suggests that while the speaker of viii 10b-11 is Jeremiah the speaker of vi 13-14 is Yahweh. She points out that the two passages are not exact doublets and proposes that the oral composer of viii 10b-11 adapted the Yahweh speech of vi 13- 14 to be Jeremiah speech (N. Lee, The Singers of Lamentations: Cities Under Siege, From Ur to Jerusalem to Sarajevo [unpublished dissertation for Union Theological Seminary, 2000]). Although Lee's proposal is possible, the fact that vi 13-14 shares the common diction (rapa' and seber) and concerns (kohen and ndbf) of the bat-ammz passages makes it improb- able that Yahweh is the speaker and suggests that the missing word in the MT (bat-) is best explained as a textual omission. 21 The asseverative usage of ki is well-established. It stands at the beginning of other speeches in ii 20, iv 22, v 26, viii 17, and x 21. 201</page><page sequence="12">JOSEPH M. HENDERSON are clearly marked ("then I said," iv 10, v 4), and five other similar interruptions occur in iv-vi (v 12-13, 23-24, vi 10-1 la, 28-30).22 The last bat-'ammi passage in Jer. xiv 17-18 is most similar to viii 23 in diction, and Biddle considers it the best evidence that Yahweh is the speaker of the bat-'amma passages. The passage follows a prose prophecy in xiv 14-16, the last part of which is cited below. 16 And the people... shall be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword.... For I will pour out their wickedness upon them. 17 (And) you shall say to them this word. Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease, for the virgin daughter-my people (bat-'ammi) is struck down with a crushing blow, with a very grievous wound. 18 If I go out into the field, look-those killed by the sword! And if I enter the city, look-those sick with famine! For both prophet and priest ply their trade throughout the land, and have no knowledge. Biddle is convinced that this sympathetic speech in xiv 17-18 is spo- ken by Yahweh because it is introduced with the phrase "And you (m.s.) shall say to them this word," which indicates Yahweh's speech. Although many previous scholars have felt this is an inappropriate introduction to the following lament, Biddle asks, "How does the text indicate, explicitly or implicitly, that Jeremiah speaks?"23 The answer from Lamentations and the other bat-'ammz passages is that the lan- guage of this passage (eyes running down day and night for my Daughter People [bat-'ammi] smitten with a great wound [seber]) is most appro- priate in the mouth of a human speaker who is complaining to God. Furthermore, the sympathy it expresses does not fit well with the pic- ture of God elsewhere in Jer. ii-xx (for example, in the preceding verse, God says he will "pour out their wickedness upon them"). Finally, since it has been shown that bat-'ammi passages often function as appeals for God's mercy, it would seem strange for God to instruct the prophet 22 Arguments for the identification of speakers in Jer. iv 5-vi 30 can be found in J.

Given the difficulty of hearing Yahweh as the speaker, what is the reader to make of the first phrase ("And you shall say to them this word")? Holladay offers a plausible solution: the phrase does not refer to the lament following it in verses 17-18 but to the prophecy pre- ceding it in 14-16.24 The prophecy not only provides a fitting antecedent for "this word" since it is patently spoken by Yahweh but also for "to them" since the prophecy is directed to the false prophets and those who listen to them. Other evidence for reading the phrase with the previous speech is the vav-consecutive it begins with and a similar case in xii 12a in which "this word" (haddabdr hazzeh) refers to the preced- ing speech.25 This reading makes good sense of the existing text and does not require Yahweh to be the speaker of a speech that does not fit well with his character as it is developed in Jer. ii-xx. This review of the five bat-'ammi passages outside of viii 18-ix 2 has shown that there is no compelling reason to read any of them as Yahweh's speech. Instead it has found good reason to read them like the bat-'ammi passages in Lamentations as having a speaker who com- plains to Yahweh concerning the destruction of his Daughter People. The occurrences of bat-'ammi in a prophecy (iv 11), a call to lament (vi 26), a criticism of religious leaders (viii 10-11), and a prayer for forgiveness and mercy (xiv 17-22) all fit well with the general role of a prophet and with the specific character of Jeremiah developed else- where in the book. A fresh reading of Jeremiah viii 18-ix 2 Based on the clearer understanding of the bat-'amma passages, the speakers of viii 18-ix 2 can be more confidently identified. To begin, Biddle's identification of Yahweh as the speaker of viii 19b and ix 1-2 can be accepted. Only Yahweh could say, "Why have they pro- voked me to anger with their images?" (viii 19b). That he is also the speaker who says "O that I had in the desert a travelers lodging place so that I could leave my people" is confirmed by the divine speech marker "Yahweh's word" (na'um-yhwh) in ix 2 and the use of the term "my people" ('ammi) in ix 1. 24 Holladay, Jeremiah I, pp. 436-7. 25 This is Holladay's observation. Jeremiah I, pp. 436-7. 203</page><page sequence="14">JOSEPH M. HENDERSON Once these two speeches are assigned, it is easy to see what is per- haps the most prominent feature of the passage: the marked contrast between the anger toward the people expressed in these two speeches of Yahweh and the sympathy expressed for them in the remainder of the passage. In viii 19, the speaker hears the cry of his Daughter People; in viii 21 the speaker's heart is wounded for her wound; in viii 22 the speaker complains that her health has not been restored; and in viii 23 the speaker wishes to weep day and night for her slain. This sharp contrast alone should suggest that there are two distinct speakers in the passage with two distinct attitudes toward the people. This distinction becomes even clearer when it is noted that the divi- sion between the sympathetic and angry speeches coincides exactly with the division between bat-'ammi and 'ammzi speeches. In fact, it is likely that the reason that passage uses the term bat-'ammz four times is to be certain that the reader can distinguish the sympathetic speeches. In the face of this evidence, it seems difficult to persist in blurring the distinction in viii 18-ix 2 by naming Yahweh as the speaker of both the angry and the sympathetic speeches. Here as elsewhere in the poetry of Jeremiah, the sympathetic speaker who refers to his people as bat-'ammi is Jeremiah. This conclusion makes sense of the most obvious structural features of the passage: two sets of parallel speeches. In the first set, both speeches use an unusual sequence of three questions, the first begin- ning with ha, the second with 'im, and the third with maddua' (viii 19b and 22).26 Each sequence functions as a unified rhetorical device in which the speaker first gets the hearers to assent to two obvious asser- tions and then asks them to explain a situation that seems to contra- dict the assertions: "Isn't it true that...? And isn't it true that...? Then why is it that...?" Because the three questions work together to produce a single rhetorical effect, they should not be split up between two speakers (as Biddle and Holladay suggest). When the two paral- lel sequences are compared, it can be seen that Yahweh's angry ques- tion sequence, which concludes, "Why have they provoked me to anger with their images?" (viii 19b), is answered by Jeremiah's sympathetic question sequence, which concludes, "Why has the wound of my Daughter People not been healed?" (viii 22). 26 This sequence occurs six times in Jeremiah and nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible. For a discussion, see W. Brueggemann, "Jeremiah's Use of Rhetorical Questions," JBL 92 (1973), pp. 358-74. 204</page><page sequence="15">WHO WEEPS IN JEREMIAH VIII 23 In a similar way, the second set of parallel speeches also highlights a difference in perspective and thus a difference in speakers. When Jeremiah wishes, "O that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears so that I might weep day and night for the slain of my Daughter People!" (viii 23), Yahweh responds in kind with an angry wish: "O that I had in the desert a traveler's lodging place, that I might leave my people and go away from them!" (ix 1).27 These observations allow a fresh reading of Jer. viii 18-ix 2: Daughter People (bat-'ammi) laments (viii 18): My joy is gone, grief is upon me, my heart is sick.28 Jeremiah responds (viii 19a): Hark, the cry of my Daughter People (bat-'ammi) from far and wide in the land. Yahweh lays the blame (viii 19b): (ha) Is Yahweh not in Zion? ('im) Is her King not in her? (maddzua') Why [then] have they provoked me to anger with their images, with their foreign idols? Daughter People laments (viii 20): The harvest is past, the summer is ended and we are not saved. Jeremiah responds (viii 21): For the hurt of my Daughter People (bat-'ammi) I am hurt, I mourn and dismay has taken hold of me. Jeremiah lays the blame (viii 22): (ha) Is there no balm in Gilead? ('im) Is there no physician there? (maddu2a') Why then has the health of my Daughter People (bat-'ammf) not been restored? Jeremiah's wish (viii 23): O that my head were a spring of water, and my eyes a fountain of tears, so that I might weep day and night for the slain of my Daughter People (bat-'ammf)! 27 If it seems an unusual anthropomorphism for ix 1 to portray Yahweh as longing for a wayfarers' ('rahzim) lodge in the wilderness, it should be observed that in xiv 8, Yahweh is accused of being a wayfarer ('reah) who turns aside for the night. 28 This difficult verse is textually corrupt. It is here assigned to Daughter People on the assumption that this is the cry mentioned in the following verse. However, the speaker could possibly be Jeremiah whose sick heart is also mentioned in verse 21. If verse 20 were also spoken by Jeremiah, on behalf of the people, it would simplify this exchange to two speakers. 205</page><page sequence="16">JOSEPH M. HENDERSON Yahweh's wish (ix 1): O that I had in the desert a travelers lodging place, that I might leave my people ('ammt) and go away from them! For they are all adulterers a band of traitors. Implications The conclusion that Jeremiah can be clearly distinguished from Yahweh in Jer. viii 23 and elsewhere in Jer. ii-xx has two important implications. First, the distinction between speakers undermines the conception of ii-xx as a collection of poetic oracles in which the prophet is merely God's messenger. Hearing Jeremiah and Yahweh as inde- pendent speakers lays the foundation for a new conception of ii-xx as a work of dramatic poetry. Second, the characterization of Yahweh as resolutely angry raises questions about the purpose of this portrayal. The evidence found when examining the bat-'ammi' passages suggests that answers may be found in the book of Lamentations. In Lamentations, the portrayal of God is darker, but the purpose is clearer. There the poems begin with portrayals of God's wrath and conclude with direct appeals for his mercy. Perhaps Jeremiah's portrayal of an angry God is intended to elicit God's mercy like the prayer at the conclusion of Jer. ii-x: "Correct me, O Yahweh, but in just measure; not in your anger, or you will bring me to nothing." Abstract Since the work of A. Heschel, who described the pathos of God in Jeremiah, it has become common to identify the weeping speaker of Jeremiah viii 23 as Yahweh. Many hold that the speech of God and the speech of the prophet are indistinguishable, but a few, including M. Biddle, maintain that Yahweh alone is the speaker. This paper contends that the speaker of Jeremiah viii 23 (and several other passages that express sympathy for the people) is not Yahweh, but Jeremiah. It argues that the sympathetic term bat-'ammi found in these passages and similar passages in Lamentations is typical of a speaker who cries out to God in complaint. Distinguishing Jeremiah's diction and concerns from Yahweh's allows the poetry of Jeremiah ii-xx to be read as dramatic dialogue. 206</page></plain_text>
