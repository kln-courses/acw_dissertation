<plain_text><page sequence="1">review KATHLEEN RAINE COLLECTED Kathleen Raine, Collected Poems. Random House. What immediately impresses one up- on reading the Collected Poems of Kathleen Raine, one of the finest Eng- lish poets writing today, is her single- ness of purpose and the constancy of her vision. Indeed, even if Miss Raine had consented to retain most of the poems in her earlier volumes, she would not in any essential way have modified the over-all effect. Yet her at- tempt to purify her volumes, to discard any poems which in her judgment did not "reawaken an imaginative experi- ence," has resulted in one of the most significant prefaces to appear in a long time. It will be rewarding, I think, to con- sider Miss Raine's poetry in the light of her preface. Essentially, she believes that a poem is a captured glimpse of the eternal mind. She argues that when a poet begins to write a poem "there is no poem, in the sense of a construc- tion of words; and the concentration of the mind is upon something else, that precedes words, and by which the words, as they are written, must con- stantly be checked and rectified." The "something else" is the platonic idea. The poet's method by which she hopes to capture the timeless order is based upon what can be called an exclusion principle. She calls for a "pure" poetry, that is, poetry that excludes human his- tory from its subject matter. "War, re- ligion, and love all present themselves as serious and important matters, but no poet is to be forgiven who allows himself to be duped. Love is important only in Plato's sense, in so far as it gives wings to the imagination - what- ever in love is personal and not imagi- native, matters not at all." And then, even more explicitly, the poet writes that she wished to omit from her collec- tion "nearly all poems that include any trace of ecclesiastical symbolism or sen- timent .... now I can see that when my vision has been most pure the ec- clesiastical symbols have never come to my mind." This declared willingness on the part of a poet effectively to neglect for poetic purposes human emotions is a new twist to the contemporary belief in the uniqueness of the aesthetic ex- perience and a return in a new and, un- fortunately, sterile way to the prophetic methods of William Blake, Miss Raine's master. Blake, who also believed in a transcendental reality and in the power of the imagination to realize that eter- nal order, unlike his later disciple, did not limit but extend the range of hu- man emotions fit for poetry. The very richness of his symbolism and his quick kaleidoscopic visions encompassing not only forces such as time and space, law, freedom, love and reason, but contemp- orary persons and events, London in its joy and scum, give the reader the feel- ing that it is to this world, the here and 289</page><page sequence="2">PRAIRIE SCHOONER now, that he is bringing his vision of eternal perfections. One line from Miss Raine's poem the "Crystal Skull," illustrates how characteristically she turns her vision away from the human present. She writes, "the perfection of light is the destruction of the world." The suggestion of despair, of hostility to man underlying the verse, would be antithetical, I should hazard, to Blake (and to his time, I may add). The vi- sion is joyless, too suggestive of disgust for man (so typical of the writers of our own anxious times) even to ap- proximate the Blakean joy in the union of the human and divine. It is this kind of orphie statement, a sterile prophecy, that I find so unsatisfactory in the poems of Miss Raine. Her symbolism is often, perhaps as a result of her essential joylessness (her concern with death and endings) fuzzy, not confused or over- rich as in Blake, but meaningless. She uses frequently without new illumina- tion, the traditional mystic signs: the wind, rose, day, star, rocks, angels, bird, sun. What is lacking is not only Blake's turbulent and abundant imagery but his profound belief in contrarieties. But Blake lived in another time, a time of revolution and hope. Mallarm√©, who is closer in time and mood to Kath- leen Raine, though not a transcendent- alist in Miss Raine's sense, is interesting as a point in comparison because he too was a purist in his attempts to do away with subject matter. Yet he must be judged less severely than the English poet for limiting the scope of the poet's materials. The French poet desired what Joseph Chiari has recently termed the "neantisation," the negation of sub- ject matter, and as a result he worked hard on the perfection of form. Miss Raine, on the other hand, is rather cas- ual about form; and her purism, in her weakest poems, consists largely in at- tempting to evoke an isolated vision of eternal love and beauty with too few poetic means. She allows neither the varied materials which the use of mun- dane experiences (the personal suffer- ing and place and event) offers nor the richness of metaphor, direct in analogy and diverse in possible interpretation. Blake once asked: "What is the price of Experience? Do men buy it for a song? /Or wisdom for a dance in the street?" It is true that all Platonists have to re- gard in some way as inconsequential or contingent human events and feelings. But if human experience must be trans- cendent before it matters for poetry, that is, must already be purified of the personal and defiled, then poetic art would have no function. The art trans- mutes through the imagination the shadow into the real, if you will. Any experience should have the possibility, therefore, of reawakening the imagina- tion, of recollecting to a slumbering mass the perfections of eternity. It is up to the poet to make his words (based not on arbitrarily chosen or pure ex- periences, but on all possibles) become the instruments of Platonic music. Miss Raine's beautiful "Love Poem" bears witness to the falsity and conceit of advocating the impossible, a virginal art, that is, an art reflecting the tran- scendent without the mirror of the mundane. I quote the following lines from it: Here, where I trace your body with my hand, 290</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW eternal in a way which makes even transcendent reality bend to the ego- centricity of spirit. ... I can close The eternal mind to all it knows, Deny The love that moves in me When the spirit blows. Of course, the imagination worked the miracle that is the artifact, the poem, in the above instances, but it was not a chaste imagination. Humanity, impure, was the agent. The poet was not duped. Certainly, the visionary poet must al- ways work with the paradoxes of the pure and impure experiences (of inno- cence and experience, in Blake's terms), of reality and its shadows. He is always in exile - whether it be from the "lost garden," as Miss Raine puts it, or from lost innocence. To the mystic, conse- quently, man's productions are trivial and obstructionist, and he looks to a dream, to childhood, to the collective unconscious, even to the supposed pure, innocent life of birds and animals, who, through some uncanny, and, ironically enough, anthropomorphic fashion, seem imbued with the "eternal mind." But Miss Raine indeed often becomes quite maudlin as she contemplates the "sweet- eyed, unregarding beasts" who "waking and sleeping wear the natural grace." I must say that the mystical notion that animals can contain such unambiguous innocence and eternal love (wisdom) is rather hard to take today. Marianne Moore's natural world, for example, has the obliqueness and complexity per- ceived by an ironic observer more in keeping with the contemporary situa- tion. The mute beauty of the bird may suggest to trapped man, in pain because Love's presence has no end; For these, your arms that hold me, are the world's. In us, the continents, clouds and oceans meet Our arbitrary selves, extensive with the night, Lost, in the heart's worship, and the body's sleep. When the poet begins the poem with "Yours is the face that the earth turns to me," the reader knows that human love has mattered for poetry, and that the poet's art has transmuted it into some kind of intimation of immortality. Another example of a memorable poem indicating concern with natural fact or human experience also stands as a contradiction to Miss Raine's professed theory of poetry. With what pathos the poet is able in a single stroke to describe the full but trapped human heart, which feels beyond its limitations: In the poem "The Moment," she writes: "And I have only two hands and a heart to hold the desert and the sea." Again, in the simple and powerful ballad effect of "The End of Love," there is more than the impersonal imagination in the la- ment over the dead lover. It is universal enough but it is nonsense to say that whatever was personal was removed from the imaginative experience behind the poem: Now he is gone Why should I mourn My true love more Than mud or stone? And in "The Tutelary Spirit," whose theme is explicitly the eternal mind, Miss Raine with Donnean irony and wit juxtaposes the personal against the 291</page><page sequence="4">PRAIRIE SCHOONER of his very consciousness, an illusion of innocence and dream as it has done for centuries, but unless a modern poet can handle the theme without seeming to write a misplaced bestiary the result is likely to sound maudlin. There is noth- ing maudlin, however, when the Eng- lish poet, identifying herself with na- ture, handles the pantheistic theme. With great urgency of feeling, she writes poem after poem in which her transcendent vision captures for the reader that "something else," through a close association with an immediate object, with Existenz. For example, take the last lines of "The Transit of the Gods": And I who have been Virgin and Aphrodite, The mourning Isis and the queen of corn Wait for the last mummer, dread Persephone To dance my dust at last into the tomb. or those powerful lines from "The Py- thoness" : "I am that serpent-haunted cave/Whose navel breeds the fates of men." In brief, the success of her finest poems (in addition to those already cited one ought to mention "The Vic- tims," "The Company," or "Isis Wan- derer") suggests that the writer of the preface as a practicing poet transcended her own wit. Miss Raine herself in a kind of afterthought seems to have modified her original simplistic (or un- fortunately expressed) view of the rela- tion of the most primitive human emo- tions to art. In a letter to the Times Literary Supplement replying to an editorial examining her belief in the purity of poetry, she has granted that the human event is meaningful for the poet as a necessary springboard of cre- ation or at most as primary symbolism and language, even as she pitches it within the eternal and impales it in a twice-removed metaphor. Stating that poetry is "an expression of a timeless metaphysical order that has been vari- ously named - Plato's intelligible world, the world of the logos, the Cabbalistic Eden, Blake's 'Jesus or Imagination,' " she continues: Of this eternal world the natural world is a copy- a moving image, as Plato says; but to copy the copy (na- ture) is to copy at second hand. The poet should copy the original, using whatever image nature or human events provides (sic), as a language in this way. An image, or a human episode, used in this way, is no longer used for its own sake, or naturalisti- cally. Events and figures as expression of these timeless imaginative forms can no longer be called the subject of the poem; a human person or poet then becomes itself a metaphor. Eternity seems cheaply bought if it can forego all sin and suffering, all hu- man history. In another letter to the Times (still in her own defense), the poet comments that "inspiration is one thing, personal memory quite another; and as Blake never tired of pointing out, memory is not a Muse." Milton too thought the memory no Muse but he still wrote his sonnets - and what hu- man history did he neglect when he wrote his major poems taken from the body of man and his demons? Miss Raine, who admits somewhere that per- sonal suffering made her a poet, has 292</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW been too chaste in her conception of poetry.
