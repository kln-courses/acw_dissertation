<plain_text><page sequence="1">387 ANCIENT CORRECTIONS IN THE TEXT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT (Tikkun Sopherim). The student of the Old Testament .is so much accustomed to the story of the scrupulous care with which the Scribes guarded the Sacred Text, counting even its letters, that it comes as a shock to him to be told that, according to Jewish tradition, he has before him in eighteen places of his Hebrew Bible not the original text, but a text altered by the Scribes! In these eighteen passages, if we may believe a statement which has been frequently made, and perhaps never fully disproved, the original reading was altogether displaced from the MSS, as being un becoming (or, indeed, in some cases, almost blasphemous), and a Scribes' emendation took its place, the memory of the original reading being preserved in tradition only. The fullest account of the matter in English is to be found in Dr. Ginsburg's Introduction to the Hebrew Bible1 ; and Mr. T. H. Weir devotes some pages to it in his Short History of the Hebrew Text of the Old Testament. Dr. Buhl (Kanon utid Text des Α. Τ1891) deals with the subject (pp. 103-105), and to some extent1 accepts the theory (pp. 251 if.). The ' Scribes' corrections,' in short, still attract considerable attention, and some of them are accepted by serious scholars. Yet the evidence alleged for the theory is very thin. The early evidence is ambiguous, while what is unambiguous is too late to be of any real value. A Midrashic fancy ; an ambiguous phrase ; a misinterpretation ; such seems to be the history of the growth of the doctrine of Scribes' emendation. In the present paper I propose to examine the evidence with 1 In which the theory of emendation is fully accepted. ' As far as regards the following passages:—Num. xi 15; I Sam. iii 13 (in part); Ezek. viii 17 ; Hab. i 12 ; Zech. ii 8 [13] ; Job vii 20 ; Lam. iii 20. C C 2</page><page sequence="2">388 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES regard to the eighteen passages, in order to discover whether it is sufficient to prove that our present text is indeed an altered text, and that the original readings are really preserved in our ' traditional ' sources. The evidence which is to be the subject of this inquiry is derived from authorities which may be divided into three classes, viz. the Midrashic, the Masoretic, and the Exegetical (com mentators). (A.) MiDRASHIM. (These may be roughly described as homiletic commentaries on books of the Old Testament. They are broadly distinguished from later exegetical works, such as those of Rashi, Aben Ezra, and Kimhi, by their lack of literal and grammatical exegesis and of purely critical matter.) Those useful for the present inquiry are :— (i) Siphri (ed. Friedmann, Vienna, 1864, p. 22 b), a very early work, revised in the second century of the Christian era, and again in the third '. (ii) Mechilta (ed. Friedmann, Vienna, 1870, p. 39 a), composed in the second century, and revised perhaps towards the close of the same century \ (iii) Midrash Tanhuma (Mantua, anno 323=1563 a. d., p. 32 b, col. 2), a late work in which Mechilta and an earlier Midrash Tanhuma were used. The earlier Tanhuma2 (ed. S. Buber, Wilna, 1885) belongs to the fifth or sixth century. To these some writers would add :— (iv) Yalkut Shimeoni (ed. B. Lorje, Zolkiew, 1859), a compilation by R. Simon of Frankfort (1200-1250 a. d.) from the Midrashim. [Its evidence has not been cited in the important Table VI (below) owing to its secondary character.] (B.) Masoretic Works. (These deal with the text of the Old Testament, but rather as a fixed thing to be guarded in its integrity, than as subject to correction and improvement.) The chief of these are :— (i) The printed Masorah found in Rabbinic Bibles (Bomberg's and Buxtorf's). (See the passage at the head of the book of Numbers, repeated in the margin of Ps. cvi 20.) Cited below as 'Masorah (printed).' 1 According to Schiller-Szinessy {Encl. Brit, mishnah) neither Siphrê nor Mechilta was written down before the sixth century a. d. • According to Eppstein Buber's is the later recension. It does not contain the list of tikkun passages.</page><page sequence="3">ANCIENT CORRECTIONS IN TEXT OF OLD TESTAMENT 389 (ii) The Ochlah ul ochlah (ed. Frensdorff, Hannover, 1864). There are two MSS of this work, one at Paris, from which Frensdorff printed his edition, containing four hundred articles, and one at Halle1, con taining over a thousand. This second MS, however, does not contain the list of tikkun sopherim passages, so that there is grave doubt whether the list belongs to the original form of the book Ochlah. The book in one form or another is older than Kimhi (1155-1235 a.d.) who quotes it by name. (iii) The Masorah found in Yemen MSS (Β. M. Orient. 1379 of the fifteenth or sixteenth century, and 2349 of the year 1469 a.d., in the margin of Num. xii 12 (cf. Ginsburg, Introduction to the Hebrew Bible, p. 350). (iv) The Masorah given at the foot of the page containing Zech. ii 12 [8] in the Codex Petropolitanus Babylonicus of the year 916 a. d., reproduced in facsimile by Herm. Strack, 1876. (v) The list published from the Baer MS by S. Baer and H. Strack as an Appendix ('Anhang') to their edition of Ben Asher's Masoretic work Dikdukë ha-teamim. The editors seem to think (p. 44, note) that the list may be the work of Ben Asher himself, who flourished in the first half of the tenth century. It is cited in this paper as Ben Asher. To the Masoretic lists may be added the isolated marginal notes attached to particular passages in Biblical MSS, asserting in each case that the particular passage is ' tikkun sopherim,' or 'one of the eighteen tikkun sopherim.' From the mass of MSS I have singled out a few. Each contains Masorah, and is representative of an important or seemingly important class of MSS. (a) Camb. Univ. Add. 465. Sephardic of the twelfth or thirteenth century. Contains the whole Bible. Valuable for its Masorah ; cf. Schiller-Szinessy, Catalogue of Hebrew MSS in Camb. Univ. Library, pp. 18, 19. (b) Brit Mus. Orient. 2349. Yemenite of a. d. 1469. Contains the Pentateuch. Sometimes supposed to be valuable on account of its South Arabian origin. (c) Brit. Mus. Orient. 1379 of the fifteenth or sixteenth century. Contains the Pentateuch. Probably also Yemenite. (d) Codex Babylonicus Petropolitanus (quoted from Strack's facsimile edition of 1876). Finished in the year 916 a.d. Contains the 'Later Prophets' (i.e. Isaiah to Malachi). Valuable as being pointed" on the ' Described by H. Hupfeld in ZDMG xxi 301-220. ' Three or four columns are left unpointed ; see Zech. xiv 5 ; Mal. i 5.</page><page sequence="4">390 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES supralinear system and therefore as being probably different in provenance from the bulk of Biblical MSS. (The supposition, however, implied in the title ' Babylonicus ' that it has any connexion with Babylon, or with some other place situated equally far towards the East, lacks sufficient support to be probable.) (e) Camb. Univ. Taylor-Schechter Collection, Job a. A quarto frag ment (centim. 37-5 χ 38) of six leaves containing the beginning of Job. North African ; 'very old' (Dr. Schechter). From the Genizah at Cairo. (/) Camb. Univ. Taylor-Schechter Collection, Job b. A quarto (or folio) fragment consisting of the lower part of two leaves (centim. ?X3i). Contains some later verses of Job. Also from the Cairo Genizah1. (C.) Commentators. (i) Rashi (obiit 1105 a.d.) of Troyes. I have compared the printed text of the Pentateuch as given in the Vienna Pentateuch (5 vols. 4to, 1859) with Camb. Univ. Add. 626, an important MS (fourteenth century) not used by Berliner for his edition (Berlin, 1866); see Schiller-Szinessy, Catalogue, p. 50. For the Prophets (Earlier and Later) I have compared the text printed in Bomberg's Bible (Venice, ed. 2) with Brit. Mus. Harley 150 of a.d. 1257, a MS which contains some important variations from the common text. (ii) Aben Ezra (1090-1168 a.d.) of Toledo. I have compared the printed text in Job and Psalms with Brit. Mus. Add. 24896 (fifteenth century), and in Genesis and Numbers with Brit. Mus. Add. 26880 (a.d. 1401). (iii) R. David Kimhi (1155-1235 a. d.) of Narbonne. Before tabulating and summarizing the evidence of the authorities specified above, I give two of the passages (one Midrashic from Mechilta, and one Masoretic from Cod. Babyl. Petropol.) in full, in order to illustrate the nature of this evidence. (a) Mechilta (ed. Friedmann, 1870, p. 39 a) :— 'And in the greatness of thine excellency thou overtkrowest them that rise up against thee [Ex. xv 7] that is " thou hast greatly magnified thyself against him who rose up against thee." And who are they who rose up against thee ? They who rose up against thy sons. " Thou overthrowest them that rise up against us" is not written here, but "Thou over throwest them that rise up against thee I' It sheweth that every one 1 Dr. Schechter most kindly called my attention to (e), and I am indebted to him iind to the Master of St. John's College for permission to examine (/).</page><page sequence="5">ANCIENT CORRECTIONS IN TEXT OF OLD TESTAMENT 391 who riseth up against Israel is as if he rose up against the Holy One (Blessed be He!) ... And similarly it saith (וכה״א), And he that toucheth them them (בהם) is as he that toucheth the apple of his eye [Zech. ii 8, not M.T.]. Rabbi Jehudah1 saith, " The apple of an eye" it saith not, but "" The apple of his eye " is written; it concerns (if such a thing may be said) the Exalted One, but the Scripture has employed euphemism (אלא שכינה הכתוב). Of the same class (ביוצא בו) is [the passage], Ye say say also, Behold what a weariness is it I and ye have snuffed at it [Mai. i 13], but the Scripture has employed euphemism. Of the same class is, For the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon upon themselves*, &amp;c. [1 Sam. iii 13], but the Scripture has employed euphemism. Of the same class is, Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee,thee, so that I am a burden to myself [Job vii 20] : the Scripture has employed euphemism. Of the same class is, Art not thou my king from everlasting,everlasting, Ο Lord God, that we die rtots (ולא נמות) [Hab. i 12, not M.T.]: the Scripture has employed euphemism. Of the same class is, Hath Hath Hath a nation changed their gods which yet are no gods 1 but my people have have changed their glory [Jer. ii 11]: the Scripture has employed euphemism. Of the same class is, Thus they changed their glory for the likeness likeness of an ox [Ps. cvi 20] : the Scripture has employed euphemism. *And*And*And let me not see my wretchedness [Num. xi 15]: the Scripture has employed euphemism. Of the same class is, We have no portion in David David . .. every man to his tents, Ο Israel [2 Sam. xx 1] : the Scripture has employed euphemism. And, 10, they put the branch to their nose [Ezek. viii 17]: the Scripture has employed euphemism. When he comethcometh out of his mother's womb [Num. xii 12] : {from our mother's womb one should have said:) the Scripture has employed euphemism. Also here thou sayest, He that toucheth him (בו) is as he that toucheth the apple apple of his eye. The Scripture speaketh (if such a thing may be said) concerning the Exalted One, but the Scripture has employed euphemism.' (The passage from Siphre reckoned above among the authorities for this paper is closely parallel, but offers a shorter text.) It may be remarked on the passage from Mechilta: (1) that the Tikkun list seems to be ascribed to R. Jehudah 1 R. Jehudah ben liai (first half of second century a. d.). 1 Quoted from the R.V., which is used as far as possible for the quotations given in this paper. ' Siphri (in the parallel place) reads, that I dit not (mOH tin), though otherwise it agrees with M.T. * The usual formula seems to have fallen out.</page><page sequence="6">392 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES ben liai, the pupil of R. Akiva and of R. Tarphon. (Notice the return to Zech. ii. 8 [12] at the close.) (2) that the isolated emendation given, viz. that on Num. xii 12 is not free from suspicion of interpolation. It is indeed found in Siphrè·, but here it reads like an addition to the original text. The text of most Midrashim seems to have been in a ' fluid ' state during the early centuries. (b) Cod. Babyloniens Petropolitanus (in a footnote referring to Zech. ii 8 [12]) :— ' Eighteen words are tikkun sopherim : But Abraham [Gen. xviii 22] : My wretchedness [Num. xi 15J : Out of his mother's womb [Num. xii 12] : Did bring a curse [1 Sam. iii 13] : The branch [Ezek. viii 17] : We shall not die [Hab. i 12] : Have changed their glory [Jer. ii 11] : Each man 1 to your tents, Ο Israel [1 Kings xii χ6], twice in the verse; and the parallel passage of Chronicles, twice in the verse : And yet had condemned [Job xxxii 3] : So that I am [Jobvii 20] : Profane2 [Mal.i 12] : And ye have snuffed [Mal. i 13] : Thus they changed [Ps. cvi 20] : Rob [Mai. iii 8, 9] : The apple of his eye [Zech. ii 8]. This is the oldest Masoretic reference which we can date to tikkun sopherim. It may be remarked :— (1) No kind of hint is given as to the nature of the process called tikkun sopherim. (2) The list of passages differs from other lists of eighteen. (3) No alternative reading is given in any passage. Thus it can be seen that the ancient evidence of Mechilta and the Codex Babyloniens goes very little way indeed towards supporting the common theory of Scribes' emendation. We have two lists of Biblical passages, one of eleven, which speaks of the employment of euphemism in Scripture, the other of sixteen, which speaks of tikkun sopherim without giving any explanation of the phrase. The two lists between them suggest at the most one possible various reading. Not a promising beginning for those who wish to establish the common theory ! Most of the evidence which remains exists in a form similar to one or other of the two forms already given. For presenting this remainder tabular statements are most convenient, and 1 The word œ'n, 'each man,' belongs rightly to 2 Sam. xx I. 3 A verb.</page><page sequence="7">ANCIENT CORRECTIONS IN TEXT OF OLD TESTAMENT 393 accordingly six tables are given here, viz.

D d</page><page sequence="16">4Q2 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES From a study of the contents of the foregoing tables we may draw several deductions :— (1) The tikkun tradition lacks definiteness as to (i) the number of passages affected, (ii) the identity of the passages, (iii) the nature of the change made or supposed to be made in the text. (2) The tradition (in one form or another) is a favourite element in the Midrashim, including the earliest known. (3) The tradition has not an undisputed position in the Masorak, as the following facts show:— (a) It is doubtful if it had a place in Ben Asher's Dikdukê. (à) It is not found in the Halle MS of Ochlah. (c) It is only casually noted in Biblical MSS which are provided with Masorak. (d) The authority of the printed Masorak (in which the tikkun list is found) is doubtful, for it is not known whether it rests on direct authority of MSS or not. (4) The two earliest commentators of greatest name either fail to support the tradition in its fullness (Rashi), or treat it as a thing which may be set aside (Aben Ezra). From the first three of these deductions we may, I think, tentatively draw a fresh conclusion, viz. The tikkun tradi tion belongs rather to Midrash than to Masorah, i.e. its true bearing is on exegesis, not on textual criticism ; the tikkunê sopherim are interpretations not readings. This conclusion can, I believe, be verified (i) by an examination of the terms used in the oldest authorities in rendering the tradition, (ii) by a detailed examination of the evidence alleged for each case of tikkun. (i) The terms used in our authorities with regard to these passages are many ; tikkun sopherim is only one form out of a dozen. Yet a careful scrutiny leaves us with two formulas only which are ancient, from which all the rest appear to be derived; these two formulas are 3W3n Π3Ό ('the Scripture has employed euphemism')1 and ffHDlD pp'n ('scribes' correction')2. Now the first thing to be noted is that the latter formula is ambiguous, while the former bears an unmistakable meaning. 1 Siphri·, Mechiltâ·, OchlaJt ; BenAsher; [Yemen Masorah; Tanhuma]. 1 Breshith Rabba ; Masorah of Cod. Bab. Pet. [and of Yemen] ; printed Masorah ; [Tanhuma].</page><page sequence="17">ANCIENT CORRECTIONS IN TEXT OF OLD TESTAMENT 403 The phrase ' the Scripture1 has employed euphemism י is irre concilable with the theory that the text of Scripture has been altered by transcribers. It means not that a euphemism has been introduced into Scripture, but that it was already found there and noted. The second phrase 'ת' ס ' scribes' correction' stands on different ground. It is ambiguous, and two views of its meaning seem to have been taken by the Jews themselves. According to one view tikkun sopherim was a viva voce correction (or modification) of Scriptural language authorized for homiletic purposes by the Scribes. This seems to be the meaning of the phrase adopted in the printed Masorah and in Ben Asher. The printed Masorah heads its list with the title ׳ ,י״ח מלין בקריאה תקון סופרים the eighteen expressions [which] in reading [are] tikkun sopherim' Similarly Ben Asher intro duces his list with the remark that They are not written according according to their tikkun, but the wise men of Israel read them with with tikkun sopherim (אותם בתי סי p^2). The scribes interpret a supposed euphemism, and their interpretation is called tikkun Sopherim.sopherim. The other sense given to the phrase tikkun sopherim seems to be that of a 'change' (mental, not written) made by the original writers or redactors of Scripture. ' Our Rabboth' writes Rashi3 ' turned back in writing thus' (on Gen. xviii 22), i. e. they recoiled from putting into writing a thought which some of their readers might expect them to express. A number of phrases in which the tikkun is connected with Ezra and the Great Synagogue arise, it seems, from this view. Such phrases are:— (1) 'Tikkun of Ezra' (margin of Yemenite Masorah). (2) 'Tikkun of Ezra and the scribes' (Cod. Taylor-Schechter, Job b). (3) 'Tikkun of Ezra and Nehemiah and Zechariah and Haggai and Baruch' (Cod. Taylor-Schechter, Job »). (4) 'Tikkun of the scribes, even of the men of the Great Synagogue' (Tanhuma).(Tanhuma). (5) Tikkun of the scribes, or as some say Tikkun of Ezra' ( Yemen Masorah). 1 The Heb. הכתוב corresponds with the Greek ri ytypajtfiiror or ri ypafUy. י Surely not' call them tiikun fopJierim.' * Or the editor of Rashi's Commentary, see below, p. 405. Dd2</page><page sequence="18">404 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES To these may be added:— (6) ' Ezra made a tikkun תקן עזרא) י; Ochlah in its heading to the passages). (7) ' The scribes made a tikkun' (Rashi on Job xxxii 3) *. Probably the tikkun tradition is connected with the tradition which ascribes the redaction of several books of Scripture to the Great Synagogue. According to 4 Esdras xiv 19 ff., Ezra, with five companions, re-wrote under inspiration the Law (the whole Old Testament apparently; omne quod, factum, est in saeculo ab initio,initio, quae erant in lege tua inscripta) which had been burnt, pre sumably by the Chaldeans. This tradition was a favourite one with the Fathers, from Irenaeus downwards (Bensly-James, Fourth Fourth Book of Ezra, Texts and Studies, vol. iii, no. 3, p. xxxvii), but in origin it is almost certainly Jewish. Certainly those scholars who disbelieve in the existence of the Great Synagogue ought to feel their belief in the ordinary doctrine of tifykun sopherimsopherim shaken. (ii) It now remains to examine each instance of tikkun sopherim by itself, in order to decide by a consideration of external evi dence, and of internal probability, whether it is likely that our present text is an altered form, and that the original form is preserved in the tikkun tradition. The first passage to be examined is Gen. xviii 33. It is not marked as tikkun in the earliest Midrashim, Siphre and Mechilta, but the Breshith Rabba (sixth century) xlix 7, has the remark, י' R. Simon said, This is tikkun sopherim, for the Shechinah was tarrying for Abraham.' The fuller form of the same comment is preserved in the Midrash Shemoth (not earlier than the tenth century?) xli 4,' R. Simon said, Come and see what is written, And And the men rose up from thence and looked toward Sodom (Gen. xviii 16), &amp;c. It was due [for the Scripture] to say (לא היה צריך לומר אלא), And the Lord stood yet before Abraham, but it is tikkun sopherim.' The tradition quoted in the name 1 The terms in which tifckun (or kinnui, as the writer prefers to call it) is described in Ben Asher are at first sight mutually contradictory. The list itself begins thus:—'And Abraham stood yet. "And the Lord stood yet" it was, but the Scripture has employed euphemism.' The phrase 'it was' (היה) is, however, probably an abbreviation of the phrase used in Ochlah, 'One should have said' (וזצ״ל). [Cf. the היה לו יומי of Mechilta (on Num. xii 12).] The preface to the list denies that the fopherim ' blotted out and wrote afresh.'</page><page sequence="19">ANCIENT CORRECTIONS IN TEXT OF OLD TESTAMENT 405 of R. Simon is to the effect that the author of the text quoted wrote one thing, when it was to be expected that he would have written quite another. He employed euphemism. There is nothing here of a transcriber emending the text which lay before him. The comment of Rashi on this place is based upon R. Simon's tradition, but it is somewhat fuller in wording. Its conclusion runs thus, ' This is tikkun sopherim; [for our Rabboth made a change ("turned back") in writing thus (p 1שהפכו רבות לכתוב)].' The bracketed words (the genuineness of which is doubtful), though at first sight they seem to favour the common theory of tikkun sopherim, will nevertheless bear an explanation which yields no support to the theory. ' Our Rabboth' may be identi fied with the sopherim just mentioned, and by the sopherim we may understand, as has been said above, the original writers or redactors of books of Scripture. The statement that these writers or redactors ,made a change' or ,turned back' in writing ver. 22 b is easy of explanation. After writing that ' the [three] men' went towards Sodom, the natural continuation was to write, But the Lord stood yet by (צעל) Abraham. But something checked the pen before it could write the bold words; there was a change, and the Scripture ran, But Abraham stood yet yet before the Lord. Thus since the meaning of the clause is ambiguous and its genuineness doubtful, this comment does not justify us in counting Rashi as a witness for the common theory of tikkun sopherim. It may be added that the versions (Targum, Peshitta, LXX3, Vulgate) give no hint of the supposed ,original reading.' Α' Σ׳ Θ' in Field's Hexapla are silent. Kautzsch and Socin in their German edition of Genesis (1888), in which the ' Quellenschriften י are distinguished typographically, take the ,original reading' into the text. Delitzsch, however, who had more Rabbinical learning than Kautzsch and Socin, rejects it. The next instance is Num. xi 15. Here Siphre (ed. Friedmann, p. 25a) gives the paraphrase, ,Let me not look upon the retribution which is to come upon them.' Rashi accordingly writes in loco,' Their wretchedness (or " their evil" ברעתם) one should have written, but the Scripture has employed 1 Quoted from C. U.

The same writer, however (on Job xxxii 3), has a different remark on the text of Num. xi 15. He writes: ' Thy wretchedness (or " Thy evil"evil" ברעתך) one should have written, but the Scripture has employed euphemism.' Thus we have two ' original readings ' offered us by one authority in the place of the present Masoretic reading, My wretchedness. The inference can hardly be avoided that Siphre and Rashi are not stating facts, but offering sugges tions ; they are as it were playing with the text in order to point out that Moses' evil was the people's evil, and that a people's evil was their God's evil. This is plainly the view of Aben Ezra (in(in(in(in loco) who points out that the reading My wretchedness gives good sense, and then adds 'and there is no need for tikkun tikkun sopherim.'sopherim.' This is not the way in which one would speak of a real variant. Again the versions (Targum, Peshitta2, Vul gate 3) give no support to the ' original reading.' LXX Β has την την την κάκωιτιν sine add., a reading which may be significant, but cod A and Lucian have μον, and the Lyons Pentateuch (O. L.) meant,meant, ϊή agreement with the M.T. Α' Σ' Θ' in Field are silent. The common interpretation of the tikkun tradition breaks down hopelessly in this instance. The evidence for classing Num. xi 15 among the tikkun (or kinnui) passages is very early (Siphre(Siphre and Mechilta), but early evidence fails to prove that a genuine various reading of this verse has been preserved by tradition. Num. xii 12. On this passage Siphre (ed. Friedmann, p. 28 a) comments as follows:— י■ From י■ From the womb of his mother. [It should be,] "From the womb of our our mother," but the Scripture has employed euphemism in respect to this phrase. And half of his flesh is consumed. " Half of our flesh " ought to have been said (היה צריך לומר) in the sense in which that expression is used in the passage, For he is our brother׳, our flesh.' Rashi (in loco) has a similar comment, based no doubt on Siphre.Siphre. But it is important to note that there is no assertion either in Rashi or in the Siphre of an alteration of the text by early transcribers. The Siphre simply points out that a certain 1 I omit the word בתורה, ' in the Law,' with C. U. Add. 626. י' Verified. Lee^B.M. Add. 14425 (a. d. 464); Cod. Ambrosianus; edition of Urmi.

Such remarks on the text are not uncommon in Midrashim and in the Talmud1. That the tikkun tra dition has here preserved a true various reading is a statement wholly devoid of support. No version preserves the supposed ' original reading.' The wtta nehwe, with which the Peshitta1 renders אל תהי, comes probably from the μη γίνηται of the LXX (which often influences the present text of the Peshitta), and should not be rendered (as in Walton's Polyglot) by et nonnon stmus.stmus. The L· μήτρα? μητρόs sine add. and the σαρκών avrfjs of the LXX and the paraphrase of the Targum (' Pray now for the dead flesh which is in her') in no way suggest the בשרנו of the tikkun, though they show that the אטו and בשת of the M.T. gave trouble to translators. ι Sam. iii 13. Here neither the Meckilta nor Rashi asserts that the scribes made an alteration in the text. The latter writes, in loco :— י■ Because י■ Because י■ Because his sons were cursing them (להם). Cursing me (לי) one ought to have said (היה לו לומר), but the Scripture has employed an euphemism.' [The comment is absent from Β. M. Harley 150.] In this instance the versions offer readings which need some consideration. The Peshitta s, either paraphrasing להם or reading לעם, gives were reviling the people. The Greek (Codd. AB and Lucian), however, is more suggestive ; it reads κακολογονιη■(! 0tdv [01] viol αντοΰ. Similarly Lucifer of Cagliari (a valuable authority for the Old Latin), as cited by Sabatier, gives Quoniam contemnentescontemnentes Dominum mala locuti sunt filii eitts. Thus we have Rashi, the LXX, and Lucifer agreeing that the object of the verb were reviling is not להם. On the other hand the difference between Rashi and the LXX, and again between the LXX and Lucifer, as to the actual word to be supplied, shows us 1 י Playing' with the Text.—Bab. Talm.

We can read neither לי with Rashi, nor θίόν with the LXX ; evidence such as this does not carry us behind the reading מקללים להם. 2 Sam. xvi 12. Rashi's comment on this passage is simply, ' The Lord will look upon my eye, i. e. upon the tears of my eye' (so Targum). Clearly the commentator did not include this passage in his list of tikkun sop her im. Neither do the versions testify to the supposed original reading of the passage. LXX (codd. A Β [Lucian]) gives ev τf! ταττΐΐνωσΐΐ μου (i. e. 1בעניי for בעיני). Field gives no variants from LXX. The Masorah itself, as represented by the Kri and C'thib, reads for the former upon my eye, and for the latter upon my iniquity (or upon upon my punishment), and altogether ignores such a reading as with his eye. Peshitta2 and Vulgate agree with LXX. On 1 Sam. xx 1 Rashi has no note at all. The Peshitta3, Targum, LXX, and Vulgate, agree with the M.T. No varia tion from the ordinary text is cited in Field. In 1 Kings xii 16, and in the passage parallel with it, a Chron. χ 16, the Peshitta3, Targum, LXX, and Vulgate, give no hint of any reading ' gods' for ' tents.' Field cites no variant from the later Greek versions. Rashi is silent on 1 Kings xii 16 ; on a Chron. x. 16 he has a note, but no mention of tikkun sopherim. On Jer. ii 11 neither Rashi nor Kimhi4 has any note. The LXX, Peshitta5, Vulgate, and Aquila apud Field, agree with the M.T. Theodotion and Symmachus are not cited. The rendering of the Targum seems to represent the כבודו of the M.T., ' They have forsaken my service for the sake of which I bring upon them glory.' Ezek. viii 17. Rashi has a long note on this passage, but makes no mention of tikkun. Kimhi, however, remarks ' Their nose: it means (רוצה לומר) my nose, but the Scripture has employed 1 So the printed Masorah in quoting this passage among the eighteen, though it does not profess to give the ' original reading ' of any passage affected by tikkun sopherim.

The LXX (ώϊ μνκτηρίζοντα) is perhaps too free a rendering for absolute certainty, but the three later Greek versions apud Field, and the Peshitta1, Targum, and Vulgate support אפם without doubt. Hos. iv 7. Neither Rashi nor Kimhi makes any mention of a variation here. The LXX and Vulg. agree with the M.T. No variation from the M.T. is recorded in Field from Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. On the other hand the Targum (with which the Peshitta2 agrees almost ad liter am) has what is almost a tikkun of its own, יקרהון בקלנא חליפו' they changed their glory for shame.' Hab. i 13. Rashi writes:— ' The prophet says, And thou, wherefore dost thou keep silence at all this ? Art not thou from everlasting, my God, my Holy One, who diest not not (איטר לא תמות). And this which is written We shall not die (לא נמות) is one of the tikkune sopherim which are in Scripture, for the Scripture has employed euphemism; cp. (pi), And ye have snuffed at it [Mai. i r 3], and there are seven3 similar instances which are set forth in Siphre. And according to the tikkun sopherim the interpretation is this, Art thou not my my God from everlasting I My Holy One, give me not for death into his his hand.' Again LXX and Vulg. agree with M.T., except that with Siphre Siphre and Mechilta they read ולא for לא. Field gives no Greek variant, but Symmachus, quoted by Jerome, gives 1 ut non moreremur' an idiomatic rendering of the Masoretic text. The Targum, however, reads טימרך קיים לעלמין, which is a para phrase of לא תמות. [The Peshitta *, דלא נמוס (' without law 1'), is probably a corruption of דלא נמות, which should be taken in agreement with the M.T. as a first person plural.] Lastly, it must be noted that Siphre quotes the passage with ולא אמות for לא נמות.

To these must perhaps be added (4) ימות Tanhuma \ It must be confessed that the weight of the evidence thus displayed is decidedly in favour of the נמות of the M.T., and the tikkun tradition does not turn the scale in favour of תמות· The Targum contains a Midrashic element, and its reading here is not improbably a Midrashic play on the original reading, viz. that of the Masoretic Text. It should be mentioned here that the tendency to avoid anthropomorphism is far from universal in Talmudic and Rabbinic literature. Sometimes an exactly opposite tendency makes itself strongly felt. Thus in Siphre (ed. Friedmann, 22 b) it is said that when Israel went into exile to ' Edom,' the Shechinah was with them, and when they return the Shechinah will return with them. Zech. ii 12 [8]. Neither Rashi nor Kimhi mentions tikkun in connexion with this passage. LXX and Peshitta read עינו ,his eye,' Targum עיניו 'his eyes.' The Vulgate, however (as printed in Stier and Theile), has ' tangit pupillam oculi mei' (i. e. עיני the alleged ,original reading'), but some MSS (affected, perhaps, by the LXX through the Old Latin) read eius or sui for mei. Field cites nothing here from the later Greek versions. It is not uninteresting that Siphre, Mechilia, Shemoth R. (§ 13), and the printed Masorah, together with five [seven] MSS cited by Kennicott, give בנונע for נוגע, and that LXX has &amp;&gt;s ατττόμίνος, and the Targum כדמרטיט ידיה למיקרב. One spirit of glossing inspired them all. Mai. i 12. This instance is without visible means of support from versions and commentators. As an interpretation it is correct: Ye profane it means Ye profane my name, Ye profane me. Mai. i 13. Rashi2 writes (in loco) :— ' Ye say also, Behold a weariness, i. e. a lean beast and one driven away (ונהלאה), for we were poor and there was no power in our hands to vow choice offerings; and in this sense Jonathan has interpreted, Behold we we brought our fulness ("the best that we had").

And ye have snuffed [at it], i.e. "and ye have made [it] waste away"; [הפחתם] is in the sense of blowing away with the breath. [ Ye have snuffed] at me and at my table.' This passage suggests no alteration of the consonantal text at all. It tells us that punctators (all or some only ?) added a point to suggest the reading of י for ו. The written text, however, is clearly stated to be אותו (at it); the אותי (at me) is simply an unveiling of a supposed euphemism of Scripture. The versions here give an uncertain sound. The Targum, the Vulgate, and Cod. א and Cod. 311 (according to H. P.) of the LXX as well as the Complutensian edition support the Masoretic Text. On the other hand the Peshitta has w nephheth b'hdtt (Cod. Ambros.), 'And I rejected them' (the sacrificers), or (C. U. 'LI. a. 4'; C. U. Add. 1965) b'hen ' them ' (the sacrifices). Similarly LXX (ABQT) has ΐζΐφΰσησα αντά. Mai. iii 8, 9. Here the expression אתם קבעים 'ye rob (R.V.) is supposed to be substituted for the original reading, and it has been supposed that the πτ(ρνίζ(Τ( (= אתם עקבים) ' ye attack in the rear' or ' ye trip up ' of the LXX represents this original reading. But the supposition lacks support; one only of our authorities mentions Mai. iii 8, 9, as a tikkun passage at all, and even that one does not give us the alleged displaced reading. It seems, in fact, that the LXX guessed, as do the rest of the versions, at the meaning of a rare and obscure word. A'2'Θ' give airooairooretire; Vulgate configitis; Peshitta tal'min 'ye injure'; Targum מתזין קדמי 'ye provoke me.' From a passage so obscure it is well to keep out the obscure subject of tikkun, since there is so little authority for introducing it. Ps. cvi 20. Here Rashi (in loco) gives no hint of any variation 1, but Aben Ezra writes :— ' Thus they changed their glory. An euphemism for the glory of the Name'1·,Name'1·, cp. [2 Sam. xii 14] Because thou hast verily despised [the enemies enemies of the Lord], And there the euphemistic expression is in reference to David the king by way of reproof; and he said not to him, Because Because thou hast verily despised the Name.'

Aben Ezra does not say anything about a change of reading. LXX B, Peshitta, and Vulgate support the M.T. The LXX variant την δόζαν αντοΰ (Ν 0-a ART) is probably a cor ruption introduced from the parallel place (Jer. ii u). Field is silent. Job vii 20. On this passage Rashi mentions no variant, but Aben Ezra writes :— 'So that I am a burden to myself (^y). A tikkun sopherim although the interpretation is certain (j13J) without a tikkun! The LXX here stands alone among the versions in supporting the alleged original reading ; it reads «'μι δέ 1-κ\ σοι (="p^y) φορτίον. (This σοί may, however, be derived from the σον of the previous clause.) Peshitta, Targum, and Vulgate agree with the M.T. Field is silent. Job xxxii 3. Here Rashi writes :— 'And yet they had condemned Job. This is one of the verses in which the scribes have corrected (DnsiD Όρη) the language of Scripture ; and they passed by their silence a condemnatory judgement in reference to the Omni present (Dipon lyen'i) one ought to have written, but the Scripture has employed euphemism (31Π3Π W3). Compare [Ps. cvi 20], Thus they changed their glory for the likeness of an ox ; my glory one ought to have written, but the Scripture has employed euphemism1. Compare also [Num. xi 15], And let me not look upon my wretchedness (" my evil ") ; on thy evil one ought to have written, but the Scripture has employed euphemism. Compare also many places [cited] in Siphrë and in the Masorah magna.' Aben Ezra on the other hand (in loco) writes :— 'And it is written (31Π31) that it is an instance of tikkun sopherim, but they who say so, know that which has been hidden from me.'

There is nothing in Field to support the tikkun. Conclusion. I have already drawn tentatively (p. 402) the conclusion that the tikkun tradition is not Masoretic (i. e. textual), but Midrashic (i. e. exegetical or, more accurately, homiletic). This conclusion was based on the nature of the documents in which the data of the subject are contained ; it is supported further by the consideration of each passage in detail There is no confirmatory evidence in favour of the ' original reading ' of Gen. xviii 22. Of Num. xi 15 the utmost which can be said is that the reading of LXX Β throws a slight doubt on the M. T. In Num. xii 12 the two 'original readings' are impossible as readings, possible only as flights of homiletic fancy. In χ Sam. iii 13 the M. T. is probably corrupt, and the tradition of the sopherint may be said to be no worse than the emendations of the Peshitta and the Α. V. The reading restored in 2 Sam. xvi 12 is simply a homiletic fancy. The ' original reading ' alleged in the group of passages consisting of 2 Sam. xx ι ; ι Kings xii 16 ; 2 Chron. χ ιό is merely a theological reflexion. A similar remark may be made regarding the group, Jer. ii 11 ; Hos. iv 7 ; Ps. cvi 20. In Ezek. viii 17 the obscurity of the heathen rite alluded to has opened the door to the play of fancy. In Hab. i 12 we get a very early and very daring homiletic flight ; that is all. In Zech. ii 12 [8] the meaning of the M. T. and of the ' original reading ' is the same in substance, only if we read yy we introduce a change of speaker between and the end of the verse ; no ' reverence ' is saved by the U'y of the M. T. As regards Mal. i 12 and 13 and Job xxxii. 3 the tikkun tradition is simply theological comment Mai. iii 8, 9 is an instance too obscure to be discussed further. Job vii 20 is a difficult passage which the 'original reading' makes more difficult still. Lam. iii 20, according to the M.T., yields satisfactory sense, no other reading has any support from the versions. The whole evidence leads us back to the play of homiletic fancy on Zech. ii 12 [8] (Siphrê,Mechilta, Tanhuma, Cod .Bab. Pet.) and to a parallel play of the same fancy on Num. xi 15 ; xii 12 (printed and Yemen Masorah).
