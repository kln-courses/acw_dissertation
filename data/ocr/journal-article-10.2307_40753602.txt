<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOMAS WHITBREAD Wallace Stevens' "Highest Candle" WALLACE STEVENS, THROUGHOUT THE LATER YEARS OF HIS CAREER as poet, went constantly and far in his own direction. As several critics have recently observed1 of his later poems, he often and well expressed aspects of maturity and old age in a meditative mode within which he had played variations throughout his work. And yet, in "The Irrational Element in Poetry," Stevens observes that "one of the motives in writing is renewal" : As a man becomes familiar with his own poetry, it becomes as obsolete for himself as for anyone else. From this it follows that one of the motives in writing is renewal. This undoubtedly affects the choice of subjects as definitely as it affects changes in rhythm, diction and manner. It is ele- mentary that we vary rhythms instinctively. We say that we perfect diction. We simply grow tired. Manner is something that has not yet been disen- gaged adequately. It does not mean style; it means the attitude of the writer, his bearing rather than his point of view. His bearing toward what? Not toward anything in particular, simply his pose. He hears the cat on the snow. The running feet set the rhythm. There is no subject beyond the cat running on the snow in the moonlight. He grows completely tired of the thing, wants a subject, thought, feeling, his whole manner changes. All these things enter into the choice of subject.2 Such desire for "renewal," for a change in "bearing," for new and com- pelling "subject, thought, feeling," is similar to the renewal of the ma- terial of the poet's art as he grows old, as he sees his different world with different eyes, a renewal seen and praised by T. S. Eliot in the develop- ment of Yeats (and implicitly desired by Eliot for himself) : Now, in theory, there is no reason why a poet's inspiration or material should fail, in middle age or at any time before senility. For a man who is capable of experience finds himself in a different world in every decade of his life; as he sees it with different eyes, the material of his art is con- tinually renewed. But, in fact, very few poets have shown this capacity of 1 Most notably Robert Pack, in Wallace Stevens: An Approach to His Poetry and Thought, New Brunswick, 1958; and Frank Kermode, in Wallace Stevens, New York, 1961. 2 Wallace Stevens, Opus Posthumous, New York, 1957, pp. 220-221.

It requires, indeed, an exceptional honesty and courage to face the change.3 Eliot would not have said, however, "We simply grow tired" ; he would be more likely to remark, with becoming modesty, that we try, in our small but arduously devoted ways, to perfect diction. To see "renewal" as deriving (in part) not from new dedication but from getting tired of oneself, of one's familiar manner and obsolete diction, is a typically wry, typically clear-sighted, Stevensian aperçu. Yet Stevens is fully aware that a man, for all his renewals of manner and diction, and including them, is the man he is, throughout his life : he is endowed with certain inalienable tendencies, bents, incipiencies. He may, if he has a potentiality for writing poetry which reaches po- tency, be, as a result of his personal sensibility, a poet : A poet writes poetry because he is a poet; and he is not a poet because he is a poet but because of his personal sensibility. What gives a man his per- sonal sensibility I don't know and it does not matter because no one knows. Poets continue to be born not made and cannot, I am afraid, be prede- termined. {OP, p. 217) The "personal sensibility" of a man is centrally his "style," a word used by Stevens to refer to essential being, as distinct from comparatively superficial pose or "manner." A man, a poet, can escape his style no more than he can escape himself: Style is not something applied. It is something inherent, something that permeates. It is of the nature of that in which it is found, whether the poem, the manner of a god, the bearing of a man. It is not a dress. It may be said to be a voice that is inevitable. A man has no choice about his style. When he says I am my style the truth reminds him that it is his style that is himself. If he says, as my poem is, so are my gods and so am I, the truth remains quiet and broods on what he has said. ("Two or Three Ideas," OP, pp. 210-211) The need to discover one's own unique style, to find a place to go to in one's own direction - a discovering and a finding seen as taking place through poetic acts - is bound together with the theme of home, of familiar place, in one of Stevens' last poems, "The Poem That Took the Place of a Mountain" : There it was, word for word, The poem that took the place of a mountain. He breathed its oxygen, Even when the book lay turned in the dust of his table. 8T. S. Eliot, "Yeats," On Poetry and Poets, New York, 1957, p. 301.</page><page sequence="3">Wallace Stevens' "Highest Candle" 467 It reminded him how he had needed A place to go to in his own direction, How he had recomposed the pines, Shifted the rocks and picked his way among clouds, For the outlook that would be right, Where he would be complete in an unexplained completion : The exact rock where his inexactnesses Would discover, at last, the view toward which they had edged, Where he could lie and, gazing down at the sea, Recognize his unique and solitary home.4 "The poem that took the place of a mountain" was first of all lin- guistically "There," "word for word," on the page of "the book," read by the character. And it was also there, for the character, with a meta- physical physicality, as an atmosphere in which he inspired, in which he was inspired, after he had laid the book down and turned it over: "He breathed its oxygen, / Even when the book lay turned in the dust of his table." The poem-mountain lingered vitally on, in him, as fresh air and elevation. This extended experience of reading poem and meta- poem is one of Stevens' several variously dramatized "moments of awakening, / Extreme, fortuitous, personal, in which // We more than awaken, sit on the edge of sleep, / As on an elevation." ("Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction," "It Must Be Abstract," CP, VII, 486) And, in ite particularities, "It reminded" the character, who seems very like Stevens the poet, of a sustained desire to attain such elevation in the circum- stances of his own past life: "It reminded him how he had needed / A place to go to in his own direction." In trying to satisfy this need, the character was like a painter, stage director, and poet, rearranging and exploring the things of this world : he remembered "How he had re- composed the pines, / Shifted the rocks and picked his way among clouds," looking always in his creative travels "For the outlook that would be right, / Where he could be complete in an unexplained com- pletion," in a wholeness or unity of being spontaneous, inexplicable, full in itself. Such an "outlook" would be a physically real ledge over- looking the sea, yet metaphysically meaningful beyond that meaning: The exact rock where his inexactnesses Would discover, at last, the view toward which they had edged, Where he could lie and, gazing down at the sea, Recognize his unique and solitary home. 4 Wallace Stevens, Collected Poems, New York, 1954, p. 512. This volume will be cited subsequently as CP.</page><page sequence="4">468 THOMAS WHITBREAD The conditional verbs prevent us from being sure that the character ever discovered such a view. But the important thing was his edging toward it - his desiring and feeling within himself what Stevens else- where calls "the edgings and inchings of final form." The character, in his creative and recreative searchings toward completion, and Stevens, in his poems, exemplify in their respective pasts the portendings of human imaginations, demonstrate that "what we say of the future" must uBe alive with its own seemings, seeming to be / Like rubies red- dened by rubies reddening." ("Description without Place," CP, 346) Seeming makes being more vital, like rubies made red by rubies becom- .ing red. And, if the character ever may have reached "an unexplained completion," he must have done so through an experience in which seeming both replaced and was being, like that of reading "The poem that took the place of a mountain" so fully, with such exhilaration of spirit, that it left him breathing that mountain's air. The desire to believe in the possibility of such elevation as a discov- ered "unique and solitary home" in one's whole life, or as a coming to full awareness of one's central and inimitable style, is the large process of Poetry as Self-Discovery which may only approximate its large high end, but in which individual poems often are valuable as partial achievements of that end. "The poem that took the place of a moun- tain" was such a poem: for an extended moment, in the reader's ex- perience, that poem did take the place of a mountain, did give an eleva- tion. It did so through what Stevens sees as a powerful "nuance of the imagination": "a nuance but a nuance of importance, worth being signalized," like the nuance at the end of Planck's thesis on The Con- cept of Causality in Physics, in which, according to André George, Planck not only recognizes that it is part of human aptitude to foresee events but to foresee them by means of science, "the provisional and chang- ing creation of the power of the imagination." How then liberate the con- cept [of a rigorous causal bond between two successive events] from such an anthropomorphic hypothesis? Only an intelligence external to man, "not constituting a part of nature," would be able to liberate it. This supra- natural intelligence would act through the deterministic power . . . Planck thereupon concludes that the law of causality is neither true nor false. It is a working hypothesis.5 Stevens calls Planck a true "symbol of ourselves," "a more significant figure for us than the remote and almost fictitious figure of Pascal." And, of Planck's notion of a "supra-natural intelligence," which, at the 5 Quoted by Stevens in "A Collect of Philosophy," OP, p. 202.</page><page sequence="5">Wallace Stevens9 "Highest Candle" 469 conclusion of his thesis, "is far away from the rigid concept, firmly determinisi, which seemed up to now to constitute Planck's belief," Stevens remarks : I think we may fairly say that it is a nuance of the imagination, one of those unwilled and innumerable nuances of the imagination that we find so often in the works of philosophers and so constantly in the works of poets. It is unexpected to have to recognize even in Planck the presence of the poet. It is as if in a study of modern man we predicated the greatness of poetry as the final measure of his stature, as if his willingness to believe beyond belief was what had made him modern and was always certain to keep him so. (OP, pp. 201, 202) Such a predication about "the greatness of poetry," combined with a "willingness to believe beyond belief," represents Stevens' going very far in one of his chief directions : the assertion of the powers and gran- deur of the creative imagination. He goes similarly far, we have seen, in the first four lines of "The Poem That Took the Place of a Moun- tain." And he implicitly or explicitly goes in this direction in numerous poems, nowhere more openly than in "Holiday in Reality," where, after saying of several living things, "These are real only if I make them so," he celebrates the sensed "unreal of what is real." (CP, pp. 312-313) But poetry seriously conceived as great in being the final measure of man's stature, in being a noble force and a virile master, is most movingly attempted by Stevens in two poems concerned with ex- pressing both man's "willingness to believe beyond belief" and such a belief beyond belief itself. Both focus on the fact of death. The one is a short elegy; the other, a six-part meditative imagining of "the mythol- ogy of modern death." The first of these poems is titled "Flyer's Fall" : This man escaped the dirty fates, Knowing that he died nobly, as he died. Darkness, nothingness of human after-death, Receive and keep him in the deepnesses of space - Profundum, physical thunder, dimension in which We believe without belief, beyond belief. (CP, p. 336) The spare opening assertion sounds extraordinarily authoritative be- cause of the absence of particular details, the speaker's directness, the contrast between "dirty" and "nobly," and the focus through repetition on the fact that "he died." If we do not question, as we don't, the speaker's assumed omniscience - if, cued by his tone, we set aside as</page><page sequence="6">470 THOMAS WHITBREAD irrelevant any reflection that only the flyer could know for sure what the flyer knew as he fell - we are also unlikely to dissociate ourselves from the attitude of prayer at once struck by the speaker in a manner both subdued and daringly open : Darkness, nothingness of human after-death, Receive and keep him in the deepnesses of space. The tone of supplication, of reverential address to "Darkness" and to "nothingness of human after-death" as if they were God, may seem to have a slight sarcastic edge to it : an edge lessened in advance by the serious use of "nobly" (as well as by the seriousness of the subject) , and completely removed when the speaker, after a pause, turns from invok- ing non-gods to a statement of belief in the existence of those non-gods' realms, of "the deepnesses of space" in which the dead man may, he prays, be received and kept. It is the physical universe, as conceived by Planck, by Einstein, by modern man, which Stevens evokes as fit tomb for a fallen aviator, dead in noble heroic action: "space" is Profundum, physical thunder, dimension in which We believe without belief, beyond belief. In the second of these poems, "The Owl in the Sarcophagus," (CP, p. 431 ) Stevens expands "human after-death" into a region ruled by a mythological trinity - "high sleep," "high peace," and "she" : I Two forms move among the dead, high sleep Who by his highness quiets them, high peace Upon whose shoulders even the heavens rest, Two brothers. And a third form, she that says Good-by in the darkness, speaking quietly there, To those that cannot say good-by themselves. These forms are visible to the eye that needs, Needs out of the whole necessity of sight. The third form speaks, because the ear repeats, Without a voice, inventions of farewell. These forms are not abortive figures, rocks, Impenetrable symbols, motionless. They move About the night. They live without our light, In an element not the heaviness of time, In which reality is prodigy. There sleep the brother is the father, too,</page><page sequence="7">Wallace Stevens' "Highest Candle" 47 1 And peace is cousin by a hundred names And she that in the syllable between life And death cries quickly, in a flash of voice, Keep you, keep you, I am gone, oh keep you as My memory, is the mother of us all, The earthly mother and the mother of The dead. Only the thought of those dark three Is dark, thought of the forms of dark desire. These "forms of dark desire" truly exist: they "move among the dead," and "live without our light." They truly exist in a metaphysical realm which is physically dark, lacks our sunlight, and yet is light, in the sense of weightless, in that it is timeless - "In an element not the heavi- ness of time, / In which reality is prodigy." They exist there in sensible forms which are created by the human desire to see them there : "These forms are visible to the eye that needs, / Needs out of the whole neces- sity of sight." And we see them there through Stevens' images of them, through the descriptions with which Stevens clothes them in his poetry. A realm "In which reality is prodigy" may be a realm in which the real is prodigious in the sense of unusual, out of the ordinary, unnatural ; or one in which the real is prodigious in being enlarged, marvellously enhanced, capable of almost anything. Or it may be a realm in which the prodigious is the real : real not in being physically real, but in being imaginatively real. Each of these three senses of the line, "In which reality is prodigy," adds to our understanding of what Stevens is doing in "The Owl in the Sarcophagus." He is, in large part, attempting to write "poetry of ideas" such as he describes when he remarks, A poem in which the poet has chosen for his subject a philosophic theme should result in the poem of poems. That the wing of poetry should also be the rushing wing of meaning seems to be an extreme aesthetic good; and so in time and perhaps, in other politics, it may come to be. It is very easy to imagine a poetry of ideas in which the particulars of reality would be shadows among the poem's disclosures. If we are to dismiss from poetry expectations of that nature, we might equally well dismiss from philosophy all the profound expectations on which it is based. {OP, p. 187) It is much harder to write such "poetry of ideas" than to imagine it. Yet this is what Stevens, with the all-important aid of the images and metaphors in which his imagination presents his ideas, is trying to do. In his poem's next disclosure, Stevens represents the idea of mystical or metaphysical experience as occurring to a man who journeyed into the realm of ideas, of "the forms of thought" :</page><page sequence="8">472 THOMAS WHITBREAD II There came a day, there was a day - one day A man walked living among the forms of thought To see their lustre truly as it is And in harmonious prodigy to be, A while, conceiving his passage as into a time That of itself stood still, perennial, Less time than place, less place than thought of place And, if of substance, a likeness of the earth, That by resemblance twanged him through and through, Releasing an abysmal melody, A meeting, an emerging in the light, A dazzle of remembrance and of sight. This "man," in having "walked living among the forms of thought," is like Dante, who walked living through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise, conversing with persons who were dramatically credible, imaginedly real - as if they were shining with "their lustre truly as it is" - and yet, conceived in Dante's mind, were very much outside of time and place, were insubstantial except in bearing a concretely vivid "likeness of the earth." Stevens' "man" is also an ironic inversion of Christ: "one day" Jesus "walked living" among men on earth, while Stevens' "man" took passage, as conceived by the poet, into a metaphysical realm "as into a time / That of itself stood still, perennial," resembling the time-encom- passing timelessness of God's mind. And the "man's" journey is like Stevens' own mental journey to the creative experience, the flash or twang, represented in the poem's language by means of "resemblance" and "likeness of the earth," which led, through "Releasing an abysmal melody, / A meeting, an emerging in the light, / A dazzle of remem- brance and of sight," to the created substance of this poem. In Canto I of "The Owl in the Sarcophagus," Stevens introduces us to his trinity of "forms" and to the metaphysical realm in which they "move among the dead." In Canto II, he brings in a character, "A man," and takes that character - who, we have seen, is like Dante, Christ, and Stevens himself - into the center of the realm of "the forms of thought," and, there, into "A dazzle of remembrance and of sight." Each of Cantos III through V describes one of the forms which the "man," who soon becomes indistinguishable from Stevens, saw in that "dazzle": Canto III, "high sleep"; Canto IV, "high peace"; and Canto V, "she." And Canto VI, after the descriptions, forms a con- clusion. It gradually becomes clear to us, as we read on, that Stevens' trinity reflects the Christian Trinity : "high sleep" is like God the Father,</page><page sequence="9">Wallace Stevens' "Highest Candle" 473 "high peace" is like God the Son, "she" is like God the Holy Ghost. But the reflection is subtly present, in no way brought so far forward as to be a potential interference through raising the hue of parody or the cry of blasphemy. "High sleep," we remember from Canto I, "quiets" the dead "by his highness"; he is "the brother" and "the father, too." In Canto III, "Sleep realized" was godlike in being "the whiteness that is the ultimate intellect," as seen by the bedazzled traveler: III There he saw well the foldings in the height Of sleep, the whiteness folded into less, Like many robings, as moving masses are, And a moving mountain is, moving through day And night, colored from distances, central Where luminous agitations come to rest, In an ever-changing, calmest unity, The unique composure, harshest streakings joined In a vanishing-vanished violet that wraps round The giant body the meanings of its folds, The weaving and the crinkling and the vex, As of water of an afternoon in the wind After the wind has passed. Sleep realized Was the whiteness that is the ultimate intellect, A diamond jubilance beyond the fire. That gives its power to the wild-ringed eye. There he breathed deeply the deep atmosphere Of sleep, the accomplished, the fulfilling air. Sleep at first appears as "the whiteness folded into less," reduced to less than itself through being personified as a robed figure, like such anthro- pomorphically conceived gods as Jove or God the Father. In this ap- pearance, sleep was like "a moving mountain" of the earth, "moving through day / And night" and including all its own movements, from the most "luminous agitations" to the "harshest streakings," "In an ever-changing, calmest unity, / The unique composure." Sleep robed was like a mountain clothed In a vanishing-vanished violet that wraps round The giant body the meaning of its folds,</page><page sequence="10">474 THOMAS WHITBREAD The weaving and the crinkling and the vex, As of water of an afternoon in the wind After the wind has passed. But sleep stripped of its robes, its "giant body" divested of "the mean- ings" which concealed it, was "sleep" fully "realized" in its powerful, deep essence, behind and beyond all folds of "weaving," "crinkling," and "vex." "Sleep realized" was "A diamond jubilance beyond the fire, // That gives its power to the wild-ringed eye" of the Creator or the poet. It was only when he had imaginatively and implicitly passed be- yond its physical appearances to its metaphysical reality that the char- acter "breathed deeply the deep atmosphere / Of sleep, the accom- plished, the fulfilling air." And a similar passage was, we infer, neces- sary for Stevens before he could speak with authority of sleep-in-itself, behind its robes. The character is dropped entirely in Canto IV, where Stevens speaks in general terms of the relationship between "peace, the godolphin and fellow, estranged, estranged," and men: IV There peace, the godolphin and fellow, estranged, estranged, Hewn in their middle as the beam of leaves, The prince of shither-shades and tinsel lights, Stood flourishing the world. The brilliant height And hollow of him by its brilliance calmed, Its brightness burned the way good solace seethes. This was peace after death, the brother of sleep, The inhuman brother so much like, so near, Yet vested in a foreign absolute, Adorned with cryptic stones and sliding shines, An immaculate personage in nothingness, With the whole spirit sparkling in its cloth, Generations of the imagination piled In the manner of its stitchings, of its thread, In the weaving round the wonder of its need, And the first flowers upon it, an alphabet By which to spell out holy doom and end, A bee for the remembering of happiness. Peace stood with our last blood adorned, last mind,</page><page sequence="11">Wallace Stevens' "Highest Candle" 475 Damasked in the originals of green, A thousand begettings of the broken bold. This is that figure stationed at our end, Always, in brilliance, fatal, final, formed Out of our lives to keep us in our death, To watch us in the summer of Cyclops Underground, a king as candle by our beds In a robe that is our glory as he guards. "Peace after death," described in Canto I as "cousin by a hundred names," is here called "the brother of sleep, / The inhuman brother so much like, so near, / Yet vested in a foreign absolute." Peace is "so much like, so near" his brother, sleep, and yet is different in being "in- human," in occurring only "after death." Stevens' point here, I think, is that though "high peace" and "high sleep" both "move among the dead," sleep alone is a possible human experience before death. Thus "peace after death" is "The inhuman brother," not only to sleep, but also to men: he is "the godolphin and fellow," but "estranged, es- tranged." And thus Stevens is concerned with the "foreign absolute" in which "peace after death" has been "vested" by generations of men's hearts and minds. "The whole spirit," presumably of mankind, is "sparkling in its cloth." "Generations of the imagination" are "piled / In the manner of its stitchings, of its thread." Its cloth was once "an alphabet / By which to spell out holy doom and end" ; it is now "A bee for the remembering of happiness." In its adornments it links the time of Revelation, "our last blood . . . , last mind," with that of Genesis, "the originals of green," and includes, in between, "A thousand beget- tings of the broken bold," bright solaces which have been the offspring of the human imagination's need to justify and solemnize the deaths of the soldiers of time, the breakings of the bold. Finally, peace seems re- sponsive to human need, like God the Son, in the guarding service of mercy he renders us, "a king as candle by our beds / In a robe that is our glory as he guards." The third member of Stevens' trinity, "she," was, like the Holy Spirit, "an influence felt instead of seen," "an inner thing." In Canto I she was called "the mother of us all" and presented as "she that in the sylla- ble between life // And death cries quickly, in a flash of voice, / Keep you, keep you, I am gone, oh keep you as / My memory." She says good-by to men left alive for men who die, when they die; she also says good-by "To" as well as for the dead, "those that cannot say good-</page><page sequence="12">476 THOMAS WHITBREAD by themselves." In a central sense, she is death itself, seen as a woman constantly departing: V But she that says good-by losing in self The sense of self, rosed out of prestiges Of rose, stood tail in self not symbol, quick And potent, an influence felt instead of seen. She spoke with backward gestures of her hand. She held men closely with discovery, Almost as speed discovers, in the way Invisible change discovers what is changed, In the way what was has ceased to be what is. It was not her look but a knowledge that she had. She was a self that knew, an inner thing, Subtler than look's declaiming, although she moved With a sad splendor, beyond artifice, Impassioned by the knowledge that she had, There on the edges of oblivion. O exhalation, O fling without a sleeve And motion outward, reddened and resolved From sight, in the silence that follows her last word - She "stood tall" in her own "self," and also in the "self" of each man in whom she was "an influence felt instead of seen." There "She spoke with backward gestures of her hand," as if of the vital spirit leaving its own body. "She held men closely" in herself and in their selves, "in the way / Invisible change discovers what is changed, / In the way what was has ceased to be what is." The "discovery" with which she held men was "a knowledge that she had" - a knowledge discovered by men in them- selves, of loss, diminution, imminent death. Thus she was simultaneously "an inner thing" within men and a compassionate, noble figure without them, on the verge of the realm of the dead. In the last stanza, the "exhalation," "fling without a sleeve," and "motion outward" stand for the loss of life, and the dash at the end of the unfinished sentence, the suspended animation "in the silence that follows her last word - ," represents the final pause of death. In the final canto, Stevens sums up and sets aside his poem : VI This is the mythology of modern death</page><page sequence="13">Wallace Stevens' "Highest Candle" 477 And these, in their mufflings, monsters of elegy, Of their own marvel made, of pity made, Compounded and compounded, life by life, These are death's own supremest images, The pure perfections of parental space, The children of a desire that is the will, Even of death, the beings of the mind In the light-bound space of the mind, the floréate flare . . . It is a child that sings itself to sleep, The mind, among the creatures that it makes, The people, those by which it lives and dies. The three "monsters of elegy" in Stevens' "mythology of modern death," marvelous and pitying, "are death's own supremest images" insofar as they imaginatively constitute "The pure perfections of pa- rental space," as uncontaminated confections made from the "space" of "Profundum, physical thunder, dimension in which / We believe without belief, beyond belief." And they are children of that "space" in being "The children of a desire that is the will." Further, they are "the beings of the mind." So, finally, "parental space" is explicitly equated with "the light-bound space of the mind," which is "the floréate flare," the creative light. And the imaginative mind, like Stevens' in writing this poem, is no more, no less, than a self-delighting child. We are left reflecting that the imaginings of the child and of the myth-maker, inso- far as both are fresh and fecund, are of similar value and importance within the life of each human mind. In writing "The Owl in the Sarcophagus," Stevens gallantly at- tempted to fill what he sees as one major rôle of a modern poet, "to sup- ply the satisfactions of belief" : In an age of disbelief, or, what is the same thing, in a time that is largely humanistic, in one sense or another, it is for the poet to supply the satis- factions of belief, in his measure and in his style. I say in his measure to indicate that the figures of the philosopher, the artist, the teacher, the moralist and other figures, including the poet, find themselves, in such a time, to be figures of an importance greatly enhanced by the requirements both of the individual and of society ; and I say in his style by way of con- fining the poet to his role and thereby of intensifying that role. (OP. p. 206) But "the mythology of modern death" which he constructs "to supply the satisfactions of belief" is typical of Stevens in that neither he, nor we, really believe for a minute in his trinity of forms who move among the dead - except as figures imaginatively credible to him in writing, to</page><page sequence="14">478 THOMAS WHITBREAD us in reading, his words. And, doubtless, the more acutely any reader may feel the need for imaginative "satisfactions of belief," may have "the eye that needs, / Needs out of the whole necessity of sight," the more readily he will "believe without belief, beyond belief," even while sticking to "the nicer knowledge of / Belief, that what it believes in is not true." ("The Pure Good of Theory," CP, III ["Fire-monsters in the Milky Brain"], p. 332 ) "It can never be satisfied, the mind, never."6 "The Owl in the Sarcophagus" also in large part exemplifies what Stevens calls "Pure poetry" : Pure poetry is both mystical and irrational. If we descend a little from this height ... it is possible to say that, while it can lie in the temperament of very few of us to write poetry in order to find God, it is probably the pur- pose of each of us to write poetry to find the good which, in the Platonic sense, is synonymous with God. One writes poetry, then, in order to ap- proach the good in what is harmonious and orderly. Or, simply, one writes poetry out of a delight in the harmonious and orderly. If it is true that the most abstract painters paint herrings and apples, it is no less true that the poets who most urgently search the world for the sanctions of life, for that which makes life so prodigiously worth living, may find their solutions in a duck on the pond or in the wind on a winter night. (OP, p. 222) There are many more ducks and winds in Stevens' poetry than there are owls in sarcophagi. In fact, "The Owl in the Sarcophagus" is unique in being Stevens' most sustained full-dress attempt to write a pure poem, tending to the "mystical and irrational." And he is certainly serious in making this attempt. But the owl is too owlish, the poet is too clearly aware of what he is doing, of his pretending to be an owl, of the child in the myth-maker, for the poem to be titled "The Poem That Took the Place of a Religion." Nevertheless, in this poem he suc- cessfully goes far - how far for each reader, only that reader can say - in his recurrent direction of asserting the powers of the poetic imagination. "If the philosopher's world is this present world plus thought, then the poet's world is this present world plus imagination." (OP, p. 199) And in Stevens' world, when, with him, in "Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour," (CP, p. 524) "We say God and the imagination are one . . .," we have lit the "highest candle" it is possible to light: 6 This line is quoted from "The Well Dressed Man with a Beard," (CP, p. 247) where Stevens also exclaims, Ah! douce campagna, honey in the heart, Green in the body, out of a petty phrase, Out of a thing believed, a thing affirmed : The form on the pillow humming while one sleeps, The aureole above the humming house . . .</page><page sequence="15">Wallace Stevens' "Highest Candle3' 479 Light the first light of evening, as in a room In which we rest and, for small reason, think The world imagined is the ultimate good. This is, therefore, the intensest rendezvous. It is in that thought that we collect ourselves, Out of all the indifferences, into one thing: Within a single thing, a single shawl Wrapped tightly round us, since we are poor, a warmth, A light, a power, the miraculous influence. Here, now, we forget each other and ourselves. We feel the obscurity of an order, a whole, A knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous, Within its vital boundary, in the mind. We say God and the imagination are one . . . How high that highest candle lights the dark. Out of this same light, out of the central mind, We make a dwelling in the evening air, In which being there together is enough. It is "for small reason" that we "think / The world imagined is the ultimate good"; and it is "since we are poor" that we wrap "that thought," like "a single shawl," "tightly round us." But that shawl is also, in ascending affluence, "a warmth, / A light, a power, the miracu- lous influence." The thought-shawl is "the intensest rendezvous" for each man and his inner self, and for all men, for all of us. "Here, now," within this rendezvous, we lose our sense of separate and indi- vidual identities, becoming as one in a dwelling made from a light that is mind. In making such an illuminating, inclusive, sufficient dwelling, we have within us as "Interior Paramour" that "genius of poetry" which Stevens imaginatively described when accepting an award from the Poetry Society of America in 195 1 : What is the apt locale of the genius of poetry? As it happens, she creates her own locale as she goes along. Unlike the bride [who, in Elizabeth Park, Hartford, tried through imposing herself to make June of December], she recognizes that she cannot impose herself on the scene. She is the spirit of visible and invisible change. She knows that if poetry is one of the sanctions of life, if it is truly a vital engagement between man and his environment of the world, if it is genuinely a means by which to achieve balance and measure in our circumstances, it is something major and not minor . . . And knowing this and in consequence of it, she has herself chosen as her only apt locale in a final sense the love and thought of the poet, where</page><page sequence="16">480 THOMAS WHITBREAD everything she does is right and reasonable. Her power to change is so great that out of the love and thought of individual poets she makes the love and thought of the poet, the single image. Out of that which is often untutored and seemingly incapable of being tutored, insensible to custom and law, marginal, grotesque, without a past, the creation of unfortunate chance, she evolves a power that dominates life, a central force so subtle and so familiar that its presence is most often unrealized. Individual poets, whatever their imperfections may be, are driven all their lives by that inner companion of the conscience which is, after all, the genius of poetry in their hearts and minds. I speak of a companion of the conscience because to every faithful poet the faithful poem is an act of conscience. ("Honors and Acts," OP, pp. 242-243) "The genius of poetry," as described here and as active in Stevens' poems, sees that she cannot physically change the scene from whatever it happens to be in the goings-along-and-around of time and place. Yet, being "the spirit of visible and invisible change," and knowing that poetry, to be "one of the sanctions of life," to render human life sacred and inviolable, must lead men into those imaginative modifications of their circumstances which move toward harmony and away from chaos, "the genius of poetry" locates herself in "the love and thought of the poet." She has such power in men's hearts and minds that "out of the love and thought of individual poets she makes the love and thought of the poet, the single image," an act of creation similar to Stevens' in imagining "high sleep," "high peace," and "she." And out of often terrible human circumstances, "she evolves a power that dominates life, a central force so subtle and so familiar that its presence is most often unrealized." She is like the "shade" and "force" which stand for the imagination as perhaps most real reality at the end of "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven" : It is not in the premise that reality Is a solid. It may be a shade that traverses A dust, a force that traverses a shade. (CP, p. 489) In "The Owl in the Sarcophagus," Stevens' imagined reality was such a force, his imagination so modified the circumstances of its body that he went as far as he ever did, in a major direction of his own.
