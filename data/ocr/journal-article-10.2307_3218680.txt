<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABSTRACTS OF COLLOQUIUM PAPERS VISION AND INSIGHT: THE INTUITIONIST VIEW OF NORMATIVITY CARLA BAGNOLI, UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN AT MILWAUKEE The intuitionist conception of the normativity of ethics is generally rejected as problematic on the account that it involves a queer and redundant ontology. In response to the objection of queerness, and in a spirit of reconciliation, many non-cognitivists have proposed to revise the intuitionist semantics and epistemology, while retaining the claim that ethical judgments are normative. These corrective proposals perpetrate a serious misunderstanding about the normativity of ethical judgments. They assume that Intuitionism is committed to the view that ethical judgments are judgments about intrinsically motivating and action-guiding properties. In contrast to this assumption, I argue that Intuitionism conceives normativity as reasons-givingness. My contention is that this interpretation eschews the objection of queerness. It makes better sense of the Intuitionist critique of naturalism and non-cognitivism. More importantly, it vindicates the intuitionist conception of moral activity as vision and insight. IN DEFENSE OF CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS GORDON P BARNES, UNIVERSITY OF ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA Some philosophers have argued that there is no conceptual analysis of consciousness. It has also been argued that there is an explanatory gap between matter and consciousness. What is the relationship between these two views? According to one view, the only way to close the explanatory gap between matter and consciousness is to provide a conceptual analysis of consciousness. In a recent article, Ned Block and Robert Stalnaker attack this view, which they call the conceptual analysis thesis. Block and Stalnaker argue that there are counterexamples to the conceptual analysis thesis, and that there are alternative ways of closing explanatory gaps. In this paper I respond to them on both counts. I argue that their alleged counterexamples are nothing of the sort, and that their alternative methods are insufficient to close explanatory gaps like that between matter and consciousness. 109</page><page sequence="2">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 HUME ON STEADFAST OBJECTS AND TIME DONALD BAXTER, UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT According to Hume there are steadfast objects-things that are not successions co-existing with successions. I show by citing several different passages that this is Hume's view. Given Hume's account of moments as abstractions (in his sense) from temporally single things, there being steadfast objects entails that there are single moments that co-exist with successions of moments. Thus time is more like a wall of variously sized bricks than like a line. I formalize the assumptions behind this surprising view, to make sense of it and to show that it is consistent. I note also that this view justifies the common-sense assumptions that time flows and is unlike space. OBJECT PERCEPTION AND "EXPLICIT REPRESENTATION" SARA BERNAL, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY My purpose here is to examine a contrast that has been alleged between two competing accounts of the object concept in infants and adults, one due to Elizabeth Spelke, and one due to Alan Leslie and his colleagues. According to Spelke, the object concept is defined by an intuitive physical theory, comprising certain principles that describe the motion of physical objects. She suggests that infants' perceptions "accord with" these principles. Scholl and Leslie claim to disagree with Spelke about the nature of this "accordance". They suggest that while in accounts like Spelke's, the principles are "explicitly represented," in their own account they are merely "implemented". I think this distinction is very unclear. I attempt to clarify the issue by distinguishing some different things that "explicit representation" might mean. I draw the deflationary conclusion that none of these various senses can serve to divide Spelke's view from that of Leslie et al. I also consider why one might maintain or deny that explicit representation holds in these various senses. TAKING LIBERTY WITH HUMEAN NECESSITY TROY BOOHER, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH Hume describes his Treatise discussion of liberty and necessity as putting "the whole controversy in a new light, by giving a new definition of necessity." Paul Russell has argued that many interpretations of Hume's discussion of liberty and necessity fail because they give a role to Hume's definition that is merely consistent with the rest of his discussion rather than essential to it. I endorse this line of criticism, but argue that Russell's interpretation is, perhaps surprisingly, subject to the same criticism. I then solve the interpretive puzzle left by Russell. I do this by showing that both the historical context and Hume's own text suggest that the 'controversy' to which Hume is referring is over whether the same type of necessity applies to free actions as applies 110</page><page sequence="3">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 111 to the rest of nature, rather than over whether free actions exist or how free actions should be analyzed. MORALISM AND HUMANITARIANISM NATALIE BRENDER, WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY In the past decade, humanitarian catastrophes and interventions in Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Kosovo have inspired a class of journalistic critiques that takes various parties to task for their culpably moralistic responses to such situations. This paper surveys these accusations of moralism, and finds four major senses in which the criticism is lodged. By delving into such popular usages of the term, I contend, philosophers can both enrich our conceptual understanding of moralism as a fault of moral rationality, and can also contribute to a clarification of public debate on humanitarian politics. JUSTICE AND THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE OF PLATO'S REPUBLIC JAMES P BUTLER, ILLINOIS WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY In Republic Book II, Socrates places justice among those goods that are welcomed (A) for their own sake and (B) for their consequences (358a). Some interpreters (e.g., Mabbott) believe that Socrates argues for (A) in Books II-IV by showing that justice is intrinsically good regardless of any consequences. Socrates is said then to switch focus in Books V-IX, arguing for (B) by showing that justice results in the happiest life. I argue that such interpretations of Books II-IX are mistaken. For in Book IV, Socrates makes it clear that his argument for (A) concerns happiness, not intrinsic value. More than that, because Socrates' ultimate proofs in Book IX contend that the just life is happiest because it is most pleasant, justice is 'welcomed for its own sake' because justice leads to the most pleasant life. ON THE BORDERS OF LANGUAGE AND DEATH: THE QUESTION OF THE ANIMAL IN DERRIDA' S APORIAS MATTHEW CALARCO, BINGHAMTON UNIVERSITY In this paper we pursue a reading of Jacques Derrida's Aporias from the perspective of the question of the animal. Of particular concern for our reading is Derrida's Auseinandersetzung with Heidegger's determination of the essential relation between mortals and animals, and language and death. Derrida's text sets out to complicate this set of conceptual distinctions, and in the process, leads to a rethinking of the fundamental status often accorded to the existential analytic. More importantly, Derrida's contestation of the status of animality in Heidegger's discourse on death points in the direction of a rethinking of the essence of the political and the place animals might occupy in this thought. Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 111</page><page sequence="4">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 THREE THESES FROM KANT'S EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY ANDREW N. CARPENTER, ANTIOCH COLLEGE In this paper, I discuss Kant's account of embodied cognition in the "Metaphysik L," lectures. I focus on three of Kant's doctrines, which I call the community thesis, the constitution thesis, and the embodiment thesis. According to the community thesis, the soul and body constitute an especially tight community: my body is the sole conduit for my soul in the sense that my soul is in immediate relation only to my body, and it is in relation to other things only insofar as those things are in relation to my body. This view was enshrined in the embodiment thesis, which stated that there is no mental action where "the body is not come into play." Kant also maintained the "constitution thesis," which stated that the specific constitution of the body affects the constitution of the soul. THE SPECTACLE OF DISAPPEARANCE IN THE ARGENTINE DIRTY WAR AS A TECHNIQUE OF POLITICAL REPRESSION KAREN A. CHANEY, UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO The Argentine Dirty War culminated decades of national political unrest with perhaps the most brutal political repression experienced in the country's history. The most notorious tactic used by the military dictatorship for social control was that of targeting and removing "subversives" by disappearance, or forced abduction of individuals from their home, workplace, or public locations, by military or police personnel. I will examine the spectacle of disappearance in the Argentine Dirty War in light of Michel Foucault's book, Discipline &amp; Punish: The Birth of the Prison. In particular, I will look at the use of disappearance as a technique of state control and punishment vis-a- vis Foucault's description of the historical shifts in the nature of state discipline and punishment, and, most importantly, as an effective tool to ensure a docile, obedient population to govern. CONTRACTUALISM AND THE UNITY OF RIGHTNESS MICHAEL J. CHOLBI, BROOKLYN COLLEGE OF CUNY Philip Pettit has recently argued that T.M. Scanlon's contractualism rests on what I call principle (R): For any choice x, x is right if x is distributively justified. Pettit claims that no matter how (R) is understood, contractualism is implausible. I defend contractualism by arguing that one construal of (R), which Pettit calls "semantic-cum-substantive", is defensible. On this construal, wrongness is simply the subjunctive property of being distributively justified to non-defective moral observers. Pettit objects that this construal neither captures key features of the phenomenology of right and wrong, nor does it adequately explain the unity of right and wrong as properties of choices. However, Pettit's objections (1) confuse the intrinsic nature of rightness with the 112</page><page sequence="5">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 113 unity of right options under a non-evaluative description, and (2) assume that the phenomenology of particular judgments of right and wrong is similar to the phenomenology of right and wrong in general. PRAYING FOR THE OTHER: LEVINAS' ETHICS AS A WHOLLY HUMAN SPIRITUALITY MARK E. CLAMEN, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO By focusing on the use of the term "prayer" in Emmanuel Levinas' philosophical and religious work, this essay offers an account of the religious, or the spiritual, founded in a moment of radical openness to the other person. For Levinas, the encounter with the other before me is the arrival of transcendence itself. Transcendence is thereby implicated in the very substance of subjectivity, of being subject-what Levinas at times identifies as "the religiosity of the self." Here we can find an account of the experience of the absolute, or the divine, manifest implicitly not merely within isolated events of ex-tasis or the mystical, but in the everyday life of each one of us. More than egoism, more than altruism, and more than faith as a modality of inwardness, is, for Levinas, the religiosity of being responsible for the one before me. PHYSICISTS, DETECTIVES AND HISTORIANS: WHY ALAN SOKAL IS CORRECT ABOUT THE LOGIC OF THE CAUSAL RELATION H.E. CLINE, ALBION COLLEGE Some disciplines, namely the physical sciences, have not fallen prey to the skepticism about realist ontology which is generated by postmodern views of the world. Disciplines tend to get rattled by anti- realist analysis in direct proportion to the lack of confidence that their disciplinary communities and external publics have in them. I argue that one reason for this easy resistance by physical science is that there is a common ground in science and ordinary causal talk for a robust sense of causal connectedness. I explore some of this common ground in this paper. I develop an account of causal talk which supports Alan Sokal's ontological views about the wrongheadedness of his critics. COLOR AND COLOR SPACE: STRUCTURAL AND METRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE COLORS JOHNATHAN D. COHEN, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY Naive experience of the world represents colors as objective, mind- independent properties of external objects. Perhaps the simplest way of accounting for this is a theory on which colors are objective, mind- independent properties of external objects. Such theories, which have come to be called primary quality theories of color, have seemed at least initially attractive to many thinkers. However, many have rejected such theories on the basis of the allegation that colors bear structural relations to each other that no primary qualities bear to each other, and therefore that colors cannot be primary qualities. Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 113</page><page sequence="6">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 In this paper I want to lay out a form of this argument and the empirical data on which it turns. Then I'll show why, according to primary quality theories of color, the colors do have the requisite structural properties, claims to the contrary notwithstanding. THE COMPATIBILITY OF HUME'S NATURALISM AND INDUCTIVE SKEPTICISM MARK D. COLLIER, STANFORD UNIVERSITY Hume's skepticism concerning causal induction appears to be incompatible with his embrace of naturalism. How can he maintain that causal inductions are irrational, while at the same time endorsing their use in his science of human nature? This seems to be a severe case of philosophical bad faith. This paper argues that this inconsistently is merely apparent, since Hume distinguishes two very different ways of making causal inductions. The first is the way of the vulgar, who mistakenly construe constant conjunctions as sufficient proof of the existence of necessary connections. The second is the way of natural philosophers, who regard constant conjunctions as tentative evidence that must be further investigated by the method of hypothesis-testing. Hume limits his skepticism to the former type of causal induction, and uses the latter in his own naturalistic investigations. RECOVERING FROM THE FIRST MEDITATION DAVID R. CUNNING, NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY In the Second Meditation Descartes claims that he is only aware of himself insofar as he is a thinking thing. Some commentators have argued that he concludes from this that all that there is to him is his thinking. Here I argue that a proper understanding of Descartes' method of doubt reveals that he does no such thing. In the Second Meditation, Descartes considers his pre-Meditations idea of himself, and he abstracts what is clear in it from all that is confused. At the end of the abstraction process he is left with a clear idea only of thinking. He does not conclude from this that thinking is incorporeal because he is not in a position to do this. He has not yet uncovered a clear idea of body, so he does not have the resources to check to see if thinking is corporeal. KILLING VS. LETTING DIE JOHN J. DAVENPORT, FORDHAM UNIVERSITY The dominant and most plausible position among opponents of euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide accepts the moral legitimacy of both radical pallative care and the cessation of medical therapies preserving life (both of which may result in death as a double-effect) for patients in pain during the last stages of a terminal illness. I argue that given these premises, we can show by thought-experiment that it 114</page><page sequence="7">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 115 can be morally legitimate to initiate therapies that cause a terminally ill patient to become dependent on life-supporting mechanisms, as a result of which it also becomes morally legitimate to let that patient die by stopping the life-supporting mechanisms. But if so, then the killing vs. letting-die distinction has no practical relevance for the dominant group of euthanasia-opponents who have most strongly defended this distinction. HYLOMORPHISM: THE ORGANISM AND MATERIAL UNITY IN DESCARTES KAREN DETLEFSEN, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO Some commentators have argued that Descartes embraces a hylomorphic conception of the human substance to account for mind- body unity. Implicit in some of these accounts is the suggestion that Descartes uses this ontology to account for bodily unity as well. I argue that if Descartes does embrace hylomorphism, it is merely to account for mind-body unity because the unity of human bodies precedes both ontologically and temporally the union of those bodies with souls. Further, human bodies have much in common with animal and plant bodies and in fact, there is strongly implicit in Descartes' work the (very Aristotelian) idea that organisms are among the created world's ontologically real material individuals. A REDUCTIO OF MILLIANISM MAX E. DEUTSCH, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY "A Reductio of Millianism" defends the view that Millianism-the doctrine that the semantic content of an ordinary proper name is exhausted by its referent-is inconsistent with a self-evident truth about belief. Kripke's "strengthened disquotational principle"-the principle that a normal English speaker who is not reticent will be disposed to sincere reflective assent to 'p' if and only if he or she believes p- is (self-evidently) true and implies the falsity of Millianism. The challenge to this view presented by Kripke's "Pierre puzzles" is replied to. Although one of the puzzles shows that similar inconsistencies can be derived by replacing Millianism with some seemingly unobjectionable theses concerning translation, the existence of the puzzle does not take the blame off of Millianism, since, in effect, the translation theses presuppose Millianism. The paper also replies to an argument against the strengthened disquotational principle made by Nathan Salmon. Salmon's argument is criticized for begging the question. Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 115</page><page sequence="8">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 THE TRUE CONCEPTION OF GOD IN SPINOZA SHERRY DEVEAUX, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS Most contemporary Spinoza scholars understand the attributes to be somehow identical with the essence of God. The exact nature of this relation, however, varies among commentators. Some, for example, claim that the essence of God is identical with the collection of attributes (i.e., the sum of the distinct attributes), while others hold the view that the divine essence is identical with the totality of attributes (i.e., a whole consisting of non-discrete attributes). In 2d2 Spinoza says that that which pertains to the essence of a thing is that without which a thing can neither be nor be conceived. I argue that this rules out the identity between God's essence and the attributes. I suggest instead that the essence of God is absolutely infinite and eternal power. My interpretation of God and the attributes is based on the idea that human intellect has an adequate idea of the essence of God. How NOT TO EXPLAIN THE EXPRESSIVE FUNCTION OF A TRUTH PREDICATE JOHN DEVLIN, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY Deflationists and non-deflationists agree that truth predicates have an expressive function, and so advocates of both theories are committed to identifying an enabling feature. Horwich offers an explanation which would be consistent with both deflationary and correspondence theories, but that explanation is inadequate, as is a seemingly obvious variation which may be thought to presuppose deflationism. There is a story here which everyone is committed to telling and which so far no one has told. AWARENESS AND SENSE OF 'CRITERION' IN STOIC EPISTEMOLOGY HENRY DYSON Julia Annas has given the following criticism of Stoic epistemology. The defense of cognitive impressions in terms of their causal ancestry and power to command assent is in conflict with their assigned role as the criterion of truth. It is intuitively part of the idea of a criterion that it may by used to advance knowledge and so must be consciously available. This availability is denied by the Stoics' causal account. The paper argues against this criticism that the Stoics have two senses of the term 'criterion.' One sense does imply conscious awareness, but is not applied to cognitive impressions. Another sense is applied to cognitive impressions, but does not imply conscious awareness. These two senses are explained in terms of the Stoics' developmental account of common notions and their use of these to advance scientific knowledge. 116</page><page sequence="9">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 117 GOLDMAN ON PROBABILISTIC INFERENCE (OR WHO SHOT MILES ARCHER?) DON T. FALLIS, UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA, TUSCON In his latest book, Knowledge in a Social World, Alvin Goldman claims to have established that if a reasoner starts with accurate estimates of the reliability of new evidence and conditionalizes on this evidence, then this reasoner is objectively likely to end up closer to the truth. In this paper, I argue that Goldman's result is not nearly as philosophically significant as he would have us believe. First, accurately estimating the reliability of evidence-in the sense that Goldman requires-is not quite as easy as it might sound. Second, being objectively likely to end up closer to the truth-in the sense that Goldman establishes-is not necessarily as valuable as it might sound. PERSONHOOD AND MENTAL DEVELOPMENT TOVE FINNESTAD, STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, NEW PALTZ Proponents of a psychological view of personal identity typically believe that we cannot exist without the psychological capacities by virtue of which we are persons. I argue that this psychological view is not consistent with any sufficiently plausible account of human mental development. The most coherent accounts of human mental development consistent with the psychological view face serious difficulties. One might try to avoid the problems I discuss by revising the psychological view in various ways. I consider two such revisions, and argue that neither is acceptable. I conclude that if I exist only when I have, and continue to have, psychological states of some sort, then there seems no acceptable way to explain how my psychology came to be. NON-LOCALITY AND CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS MATHIAS FRISCH, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY I distinguish several logically distinct locality principles that are invoked in the context of non-quantum physics. I argue that Gordon Belot's recent proposal for a non-causal explication of the principle "effects propagate with a finite velocity" is unsuccessful, and that the propagation principle as well as the principle that all action is by contact, are irreducibly casual locality conditions. As main case study I discuss Dirac's classical theory of the electron which is non-local in the two causal senses I distinguish but satisfies Belot's locality criterion. By discussing Dirac's theory, which is the most promising candidate for a consistent theory of microscopic electrodynamics, I also aim to correct the widespread misconception that classical electrodynamics is the ideal of a local and 'well-behaved' classical theory. Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 117</page><page sequence="10">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 INFERENTIALISM AND COMMUNICATIVE ACTION: ROBUST CONCEPTIONS OF INTERSUBJECTIVITY BARBARA FULTNER, DENISON UNIVERSITY Jurgen Haberrnas and Robert Brandom both emphasize the social nature of meaning. However, Haberrnas has criticized Brandom's conception of communication as objectivist and as privileging the representational function of language at the expense of its communicative and expressive functions by according a central role to assertions. I argue that inferentialist semantics can complement the theory of communicative action without sacrificing its intersubjectivist insights. Conceived as nodes within the inferential web, assertions need not privilege the representational dimension. Haberrnas's thesis that there are three mutually irreducible types of validity claim can be retained by identifying claims to truth and rightness with mutually irreducible patterns of inference. Inferentialism is robustly intersubjective since at the pragmatic level, interlocutors inherit each other's commitments and entitlements, and at the semantic level, the mechanism of anaphora shows how the web of meaning, connecting expressions of the language as well as interlocutors, is knit together. CONSTRUCTIVISM IN KANT'S MORAL THEORY RICHARD F. GALVIN, TEXAS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY The argument begins by establishing that (i), despite their similarities, Constructivist interpretations of Kant's theory should be distinguished from Practical Reason interpretations, (ii) some "Kantian Constructivists" are primarily concerned with applying constructivist procedures to first-order moral issues, and (iii) others see constructivism as a metaethical view. Among metaethical Kantian Constructivists, I argue that some take an agnostic position on the existence of independent moral facts whereas others adopt an atheistic view. But then these should be viewed as two distinct, and indeed incompatible, versions of Kantian Constructivism. I conclude by arguing that this points to a deeper tension within Kant's theory itself, insofar as there are good "Kantian" reasons for adopting both the agnostic and atheistic views on the existence of such moral facts. ARISTOTLE'S BASIC AND NONBASIC VIRTUES STEPHEN MARK GARDINER, UNIVERSITY OF CANTERBURY Conventional wisdom has it that Aristotle believed that the virtues are reciprocally entailing (RV): a person can have one of the virtues of character if and only if she has them all. Since Aristotle claims that eudaimonia, or happiness, requires a virtuous character, RV implies that a person needs all the virtues in order to be happy. But I argue that Aristotle accepts neither RV nor its implication. Instead, he endorses a 118</page><page sequence="11">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 119 very different account of the relationships between the virtues. First, he distinguishes between a set of basic and a set of nonbasic virtues, and claims that only the basic virtues are reciprocally entailing. Hence, he rejects RV. Second, he believes that, given at least a moderate amount of external goods, the basic virtues alone are both necessary and sufficient for happiness. Hence, he rejects the claim that a person needs all the virtues in order to be happy. PREJUDICE AND CONSCIOUSNESS: READING MEYERS WITH SARTRE JACQUELINE M. GATELY, HAMILTON COLLEGE In Subjection and Subjectivity, Diana Meyers discusses the role of cultural imagery in perpetuating prejudice. She explains that "prejudice rests in part on unconscious, emotionally entrenched bias that is 'innocently' broadcast as common knowledge and enacted in everyday behavior." In this paper I explore how these images are so destructive, using Sartre's explication in Being and Nothingness of the dual (and simultaneous) modes of consciousness. I argue that because there is a perpetual reflection that constitutes the self, the consciousness which Sartre claims is responsible for being is a reflective consciousness. As such, it is enmeshed with the cultural images available for that reflection. The co-extensive presence of the pre-reflective consciousness, however, allows for the possibilities of change for both the individual's negative sense of self and the cultural images which inform and are informed by individuals. SEX, STIGMA, AND THE LAW JEFF GAUTHIER, UNIVERSITY OF PORTLAND In their arguments for decriminalizing prostitution, Laurie Shrage and Martha Nussbaum challenge the approach of feminists who seek to defend the rights of prostitutes while condemning prostitution as an institution. They charge that such an approach not only unreasonably singles out prostitution as an exploitative practice, but lends support to popular sexist attitudes about prostitution that unjustly stigmatize prostitutes. I argue that even if Shrage and Nussbaum are right that criminalization lends support to an irrational and sexist stigma against prostitutes, it does not follow that decriminalizing prostitution contracts would dismantle that stigma. Because the current practice of prostitution reinforces the same beliefs that fuel popular prejudices against prostitutes, decriminalizing it would be an ineffective remedy for social stigmatization. Although there may be considerations that would warrant prostitution's decriminalization or legalization, the elimination of the stigma against prostitutes is not among them. Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 119</page><page sequence="12">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 INFINITISM REDUX? A RESPONSE TO KLEIN CARL GILLETT, ILLINOIS WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY Infinite regresses have played important roles in many philosophical debates, but they have recently been most prominent in epistemology. A wide array of positions, Foundationalist, Coherentist, Skeptical, etc., have all been adopted in response to a looming regress of epistemic reasons and these positions are united in one respect-they all accept that epistemic justification cannot result from an unending, and non- repeating, chain of reasons. Peter Klein has recently challenged this minimal consensus with a defense of what he calls "Infinitism" -the position that justification can result from such a regress. Klein provides surprisingly convincing responses to most of the common objections to Infinitism, but I will argue that he fails to address a venerable metaphysical concern about a certain type of regress. My conclusion will be that until Klein successfully offers an answer to these metaphysical worries, he will not have restored Infinitism as a viable option in epistemology. ARISTOTLE, MORAL PARTICULARISM, AND THE INDETERMINACY OF PRINCIPLES REX GILLILAND, KENT STATE UNIVERSITY In a recent article, Terence Irwin takes issue with the particularist interpretation of Aristotle's ethics by arguing that the virtues and the doctrine of the mean are general principles that provide normative guidance for moral agents. I agree with Irwin that Aristotle is not a moral particularist, though I find Irwin's supporting argument to be inadequate. Irwin's claim that the virtues and the doctrine of the mean provide normative guidance, although controversial, is well-founded. However, I argue that moral particularists, contrary to their explicit assertions, do not reject all exceptionless moral principles. Consequently, Aristotle's relation to moral particularism is not decided by the fact that he expounds exceptionless moral principles, but instead by the relative indeterminacy of these principles. I conclude the paper by briefly considering Aristotle's relation to moral universalism and moderate positions such as that of Ross. MAKING ROOM FOR UNIVERSALIZABILITY IN KANT'S ARGUMENTS FOR DUTIES TO ONESELF JOSHUA GLASGOW, UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Allen Wood argues that when Kant uses his "Universal Law" formulation of the Categorical Imperative to derive his duty against letting one's talents rust, his argument fails its intention of illustrating the Universal Law formulation, That is, this argument at most reveals an inconsistency in one's willing about oneself, and so makes no use of the concept that everyone must act under the agent's universalized maxim (Kant's duty against suicide is open to an analogous critique). 120</page><page sequence="13">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 121 I argue here that Kant's universalizability requirement involves more than the idea that everyone must will as the agent wills; it also has a temporal component, such that one must will one's maxims in all relevantly similar circumstances throughout one's life, I further argue that for Kant's arguments for duties to oneself to work, he must utilize this temporal universalizability, and so Wood's objection is met by reconsidering the scope of Kant's universalizability requirement. PUNISHMENT AS SELF-DEFENSE: A CRITIQUE DEIRDRE GOLASH, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY The self-defense theory of punishment seeks to show that punishment for deterrent purposes is justified on grounds of self-defense, either because offenders who ignore our defensive threats are responsible for our increased vulnerability to others or because the justification for the threat carries over to justify its enforcement. But rather than shifting inevitable harm from the victim to the aggressor, as in self-defense, punishment imposes new harm on past wrongdoers to prevent future harms by other aggressors. Past offenders are responsible for the danger from future ones only in that their actions may affect the motivations of others; such responsibility is too limited to justify harming them to reduce future offenders' motivation to attack. Self-defense does not justify threatening harms known to be ineffective; thus, the justification of a self-defensive threat cannot carry over to justify enforcement, as the enforcement condition is met only if the threat was ineffective. THE BARBER, RUSSELL'S PARADOX, CATCH-22, GOD, CONTRADICTION AND MORE LAURENCE GOLDSTEIN, UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW By looking at 'stripped down' versions of the Barber and the Russell paradoxes, we see that, in both cases, the conditions purporting to specify some item are actually vacuous biconditionals of the form '(A &lt;-&gt;-A)' which do not succeed in specifying anything at all. Other puzzles and paradoxes, including Catch-22, the Paradox of... Omnipotence and the Liar, involve vacuous specification, so the natural assumption that there is something (a barber, a Russell set, a Liar statement) conforming to a legitimate specification evaporates. To be vacuous is to convey no information-neither true information nor false information. Contradictions, likewise are vacuous-they are neither true nor false. This view is defended by Wittgenstein early and late (the late Wittgensteinian position bearing interesting comparison to Aristotle's position in the Metaphysics), and I defend it here and, in particular, try to meet the objection that, in virtue of the meanings of the words of which they are composed, contradictions are false. If it is correct that contradictions are vacuous, then reductio ad absurdum really is reduction to absurdity, rather than to falsity. Further, since one cannot get something from nothing, the Lewis proof cannot properly get started, and we can see how to reject ex contradictione quodlibet.

GRAHAM, SAINT Louis UNIVERSITY It is argued that there are two constraints on the content of a name motivated by six familiar and intuitive data points. These data points are standardly used in favor of Millian or Descriptivist theories, as well as Hybrids of Millian and Descriptivist elements. It is argued that none of these theories meet the two constraints. The moral is that standard arguments motivated by the data points in favor of these theories actually undermine these theories. Neither Millian, Descriptivist, nor Hybrid theories are well motivated by the familiar and intuitive data points. INEFFABILITY AND AESTHETIC FORCE YORK H. GUNTHER, STANFORD UNIVERSITY Many artists, aestheticians and audiences are committed to the idea that non-verbal artworks are ineffable. However, as widespread as the view is, few have ventured to substantiate it and, to my knowledge, none have succeeded. Three problems generally face such accounts: a failure to explain the invariability of ineffability, its intentionality and its value. Recent attempts by Diana Raffinan and Roger Scruton at explaining the phenomenon fare no better. In response, I outline an alternative based on the force/content distinction, which is commonly drawn in language and thought. My contention is that nonverbal artworks and their experiences conflate content and force and it is in virtue of this that they are linguistically inexpressible. While my argument doesn't establish the existence of ineffability, it offers an explanation of a substantive conception of it. ON THE PROBLEMATIC ORIGIN OF THE FORMS: PLOTINUS, DERRIDA, AND THE NEOPLATONIC SUBTEXT OF DECONSTRUCTION'S CRITIQUE OF ONTOLOGY MATTHEW C. HALTEMAN, UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME I attempt in what follows to draw Plotinus and Derrida together in a comparison of their respective appropriations of the famous "receptacle" passage in Plato's Timaeus (specifically, Plotinus' discussion of intelligible matter in Enneads 11.4 and Derrida's essay on "Khora"). My contention is that these accounts exhibit comparable approaches both to thinking the origin of the forms and to problematizing the stability of the sensible/intelligible opposition. With these parallels in focus, I go on to explain how examining such points of contact can help us to re-sketch the canonical caricatures of "Plotinus-as-Platonic-dualist" and "Derrida-as-anti-Platonist" that have (1) obscured important connections between Neoplatonism and hermeneutic phenomenology and (2) suppressed the ample resources within the Platonic tradition for critiquing the dualistic ontology of so- called "Platonic metaphysics." 122</page><page sequence="15">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 123 WHAT PROPOSITIONS COULD NOT BE: A BENACERRAF PROBLEM FOR RUSSELLIANISM PETER W HANKS, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY Here I raise a problem for Russellianism about propositions that is similar to the problem that Paul Benacerraf raised for set-theoretic accounts of arithmetic. It is natural to take Russellianism to be the view that propositions are structured sets, the constituents of which are contributed by the semantically significant parts of the sentences that express them. I consider different Russellian schemes for assigning structured sets to sentences and argue that there are many such schemes that meet all the conditions for correctness. The correct conclusion to draw is that none of these theories is true and that propositions cannot be structured sets of any kind. It is still possible to hold onto the view that propositions are complex, structured entities. The point is that propositions cannot be structured by set-theoretic relations. THE BABY PROBLEM ELIZABETH HARMAN, MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Many people believe that human babies have high moral status; that cats and dogs have significantly lower moral status; and that early human fetuses also have significantly lower moral status. These beliefs are in tension. Dogs and cats have as good mental and physical abilities as babies. To explain the higher moral status of babies, it seems one must appeal to babies' potentiality to become persons. But then one seems forced to conclude that early fetuses similarly have high moral status. I propose that the potentiality of babies does affect their moral status, while the potentiality of early fetuses does not. I argue that potentiality can increase moral status, but cannot by itself create moral status. STUFF AS OTHER: WHY WE CARE ABOUT SOME THINGS MORE THAN OTHERS JAMES F. HARRIS, COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY Stuff is physical objects that we value in a unique way with a heightened sense of importance. I argue that we appropriate and attach ourselves to physical objects in a Gestalt manner to a degree which is disproportionate to their utility, monetary or other kinds of value. Since stuff is fragile and vulnerable and needs special care and attention, we, as agents, become vulnerable and vested in the physical world through the care and attention which we give to stuff. Our connection to and investment in stuff is pre-cognitive and pre-reflective. Human beings are thus best understood as natural creatures thoroughly vested in the physical world. In our stuff we see ourselves, and stuff thus functions in much the same way as Sartre's Other.

As a question of comparative statics, we investigate the difference between auxiliary theories that are independent of the hypothesis as opposed to positively relevant to the hypothesis. As a question of dynamics, we investigate how bringing in an independent or a positively relevant auxiliary theory to shore up the reliability of the instrument affects the degree of confirmation of the hypothesis. Our results have some surprising repercussions on the Duhem-Quine thesis. ADVISING AS INVITING TO TRUST EDWARD S. HINCHMAN, KENYON COLLEGE How can you give your interlocutor a reason to act? One way is by manipulating his deliberative context through threats, flattery, or other incentives. Another is by addressing him in the way distinctive of reasoning with him. I aim to account for the possibility of this non- manipulative form of address by showing how it is realized through the performance of a specific illocutionary act, that of advising as inviting to trust. I argue that exercise of a capacity for reasonable trust can give us reasons that are not grounded in our motivational susceptibilities. Here I echo Kant on moral motivation. But this rational faculty assesses not principles but persons. Here I echo Hume on the moral virtues. We can thus agree with Kant about the motivational efficacy of practical reasons dispensed through advice but agree with Hume about the form of intelligence needed to put ourselves in touch with them. QUESTIONING THE PRESUMPTION OF ATHEISM: AN APPEAL TO CONSISTENCY IN PRESUMING DISBELIEF AARON T. HOLLAND, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH According to Michael Scriven and Norwood Hanson atheism is obligatory in the absence of evidence for the existence of God. In response to Scriven and Hanson, Thomas Morris argues that the presumption of atheism is obligatory if and only if it is rational to believe that we are in a good epistemic position vis-a-vis God's existence. In response to Morris, I will employ and expand a recent argument by PJ. McGrath which shows that Morris' position entails that we must suspend belief with regard to all preternatural beings. Then, I shall defend the presumption of atheism against three potential objections and elucidate several implications for two species of agnosticism. 124</page><page sequence="17">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 125 SOCRATES VIA LACAN: EROS AND IRONY, LOVE AND KNOWLEDGE, IN PLATO'S SYMPOSIUM NOAH M. HORWITZ, LOYOLA UNIVERSITY, CHICAGO Before the series of speeches in praise of love begins in Plato's Symposium, Socrates, the man who is infamous for having claimed that all he knew or was aware of was his own ignorance, to have never claimed to know anything, nevertheless claims to have knowledge concerning Eros (Symposium 177d-e). Through a reading of Plato's Symposium Socrates' claim to know what love is will be read in relation to the way love is defined and elaborated by Socrates and Diotima and by Socrates' relationship to Alcibiades. In addition, since no one has emphasized and rigorously elaborated this aspect more so than Lacan in his commentary on Plato's Symposium, this attempt to render the relation between love and knowledge and explicate Socrates' claim to have knowledge of Eros will be informed by Lacan's exemplary reading. ALLEGED CASES OF SELF HATE YALONDA T. HOWZE, HARVARD UNIVERSITY In this paper I argue that the rejection of one's racial heritage or ethnic tradition does not categorically qualify as self-denial or self-hatred. This is not to say that self-hatred does not exist. Rather, I distinguish conceptually between group-distancing attitudes and behaviors that actually qualify as self-hatred from those that do not. In part one, I discuss how philosophers have traditionally approached the question of personal identity and distinguish my approach to this topic from theirs. In part two, I argue that what is sometimes taken to be self- hatred is not self-hatred. In parts three and four, I show that self-hate is possible after all and develop criteria for determining which attitudes and behavior qualify as self-hate and which do not. DESCRIPTIVE REFERENCE FIXING AND SINGULAR PROPOSITIONS DAVID A. HUNTER, BUFFALO STATE COLLEGE Suppose we stipulate that "N" is to name the current Prime Minister of Great Britain. (I) If anyone is the Prime Minister of Great Britain, then NN is. Some have maintained (a) that knowing our stipulation would position one to be justified a priori in believing what (I) expresses, and (b) that this belief would be de re with respect to Tony Blair. Some have objected to (a). I focus on (b). But I question its sense, as much as its truth. I identify a plausible necessary condition on being singular with respect to Tony Blair: that such a proposition is true with respect to a possible world only if Tony Blair exists in that world. I show that if (I) is a material conditional or a Stalnaker-Lewis conditional it does not meet this condition. I then argue that the only responses make the notion of a singular proposition unclear. Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 125</page><page sequence="18">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF INTELLECTUALS KATHIE L. JENNI, UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS Academic careers are conceived by their practitioners to provide public service in lofty forms: the search for truth, the questioning of deep assumptions, the cultivation of thoughtful citizens. Outsiders, in contrast, think of intellectuals as distant and impractical, contributing little to worldly concerns. Both conceptions of intellectuals' social contributions have become somewhat unreflective and complacent. There are truths, as well as errors, in both views. How can intellectuals best fulfill obligations of service arising from our context of global suffering? I consider three views: isolationism (intellectuals can do most good in academia, morally educating students), integrationism (intellectuals should mix increased social service with professional pursuits), and defection (intellectuals should exit the academy for more direct avenues of service). I argue that the latter two are the most appropriate responses to our situation. Short of them, making academic life more responsive to urgent need is the least that intellectuals should do. ARE THERE SEMANTIC NATURAL KINDS OF WORDS? KENT JOHNSON, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY Gareth Evans proposed that there are semantic natural kinds of words. In his development of this theory, he argues for a constraint on the individuation of these kinds. I argue that this constraint is question- begging and, more importantly, that natural languages do not respect the constraint. My argument against Evans' constraint constitutes a direct argument for the existence of semantic natural kinds, something Evans himself never offers. I conclude by sketching some positive details of a more plausible theory of semantic natural kinds. RATIONALISM ABOUT MORAL MOTIVATION LEONARD A. KAHN, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE Much recent debate in metaethics focuses on three plausible but mutually inconsistent claims about our moral psychology: (1) moral judgments express beliefs, (2) moral judgments entail motivation, and (3) beliefs and desires are distinct. Rationalists about moral motivation attempt to show that these claims are consistent because practical rationality ensures that moral judgments entail motivation. However, rationalists have a problem explaining the existence of amoralists. Recently, Michael Smith has attempted to address this problem by claiming that amoralists are best understood as failing to make moral judgments because they lack moral concepts. I argue that Smith's attempt is either based on a false analogy or simply ad hoc. Moreover, I contend that since it is possible to be mistaken about one's subject matter while still making judgments about it, no version of rationalism seems likely to be able to explain amoralism. 126</page><page sequence="19">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 127 CARNAP AND QUINE ON LOGICAL TRUTH YOICHI KANIIKE, INDIANA UNIVERSITY It has long been considered that Carnap's position on logical truth and analyticity was decisively refuted by Quine, although such a standard view may now be less prevalent owing to recent studies on Carnap and logical positivism. Arguments that Quine gives in the "Truth by Convention" are not decisive as criticism of Carnap's position but reveal the deep chasm between views of these two great philosophers. We would argue that one of the most fundamental, underlying differences is found in their views of what the subject matter of philosophy is and what philosophy should do. The difference in their view about the latter is particularly manifested in their ideas about the kind of philosophical explanation that should be given to logic. We find Carnap's conception of Wissenschaftslogik (logic of science) as well as its indebtedness to Wittgenstein's Tractatus to provide an extremely important key. GENDLER ON WHY WE CAN'T TRUST THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS IN PERSONAL IDENTITY KATHRYN T7 KANUCK, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA Recently, some philosophers have called into question the methodology of thought experimentation in personal identity over time. In "Exceptional Persons: On the Limits of Imaginary Cases" Tamar Szab6 Gendler argues that our ordinary practice of identifying something that falls under the concept of personal identity is such that it does not enable us to make reliable judgments about personal identity when considering hypothetical cases. In this paper, I show how Gendler's appeal to Williams' thought experiment in "The Self and the Future" is unsuccessful by showing that the following conditions that must be met in order for her argument to work are not met: (i) Our intuitions produce discrepant judgments in response to the different descriptions, (ii) Our discrepant intuitions are not easily dislodged, and (iii) The descriptions she offers are, in fact, descriptions of one and the same case. REVISITING THE CONCEPT OF AUTHENTICITY: THE WESTERN AND ARAB FIN DE SIECLE DEBATES ELIZABETH S. KASSAB, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT Authenticity has been a central issue in 20th century cultural theory both in the West and in the Arab world. It has occupied an important place in the discussions about modernity and the cultural malaise caused by it, especially in the last few decades. However it has been associated in each of these two parts of the world with different sets of preoccupations and concerns particular to the socio-political and cultural setting in which those discussions were carried out. This paper Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 127</page><page sequence="20">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 aims at identifying and contextualizing both sets of reflections on culture and authenticity, by examining closely the debates that were engaged in the latter part of the century. This examination demonstrates that whereas authenticity is discussed in the West in connection with phenomena proper to the dynamics and tensions inherent to Western modern culture, in the Arab world it is used to address problems of Western colonialism and post-colonialism. In the West the tendency seems to be towards a more "authentic" Enlightenment while in the Arab world it is towards a more "enlightened" authenticity. ISAAC UNBOUND: RE-THINKING RESPONSIBILITY THROUGH LEVINAS AND KIERKEGAARD CLAIRE KATZ, PENN STATE UNIVERSITY This paper will re-visit the Akedah through a Jewish lens, with the strong disclaimer that it is a Jewish lens, not the Jewish lens, since Judaism comprises a plurality of views. In particular, I combine themes from Emmanuel Levinas's philosophical and confessional writings so that we may glimpse an unorthodox, if you will, reading of the binding of Isaac. Moreover, I think this task can only be accomplished by taking seriously Kierkegaard's reading of Abraham found in Fear and Trembling. Though I sympathize with Levinas's concerns with Kierkegaard's reading, it is Kierkegaard who gives us the strong psychological reading of Abraham. I claim that it is precisely Kierkegaard's reading that ultimately gives force to Levinas's concern. Finally, the task of this paper is to examine the possibility of locating a "genesis" of the ethical and to explore Levinas's conception of responsibility, by using the images we find in the Akedah. ARE THERE GROUNDS FOR TERRITORIAL CLAIMS? AVERY H. KOLERS, UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE Territory is a centrally important distributive good. So a viable theory of global justice must imply solutions to territorial disputes. Contemporary political theories all fail to meet this criterion. I lay out the "problem of relevance" - that is, the problem of solving territorial disputes in a nonarbitrary way and by appeal to political principles, rather than expectations or preferences. I then canvass several major political principles, including resource egalitarianism, domestic and global distributive justice, Buchanan's theory of secession, communitarianism, nationalism, multiculturalism, and Walzer's theory of distributed membership. None of these solves the problem of relevance. Finally, I distinguish principles for territorialjurisdiction from principles for territorial boundaries. Theories about the latter also do not solve the problem of relevance. Political philosophy needs a solution to the problem of relevance if it is to take seriously the plight of indigenous peoples, refugees, and other dispossessed peoples. 128</page><page sequence="21">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 129 INFORMATION AND ISOMORPHISM JOHN KULVICKI, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO There is a broad consensus that perceptual representations represent quite detailed and determinate states of affairs and that they are isomorphic representations. If we take up an information-theoretic model of representation, we gain a new perspective on the relation between these two features of perceptual representations. After introducing Dretske's information theory, I work out the conditions under which the analog information in a perceptual representation is extractable and it is shown why it is important that such information is extractable. Once isomorphism has been defined, it becomes clear that if a representation is isomorphic in the right ways, then the information that it carries is extractable. It is not just important that perceptual representations carry a lot of information, but that the information they carry is extractable. Since isomorphic representations carry their analog information in extractable form, they are ideally suited to playing the role of perceptual representations. Is HUMANITARIAN MILITARY INTERVENTION TO STOP GENOCIDE MORALLY OBLIGATORY? JOHN W LANGO, HUNTER COLLEGE There is a presumption against such intervention. To override this presumption, we have the burden of proving that just-intervention criteria are satisfied (cf. just-war theory). When we satisfy this burden of proof, we establish that it is permissible to intervene. But an action can be permissible without being obligatory. How, then, are we to decide whether intervention is obligatory? Having established that intervention is permissible, we do not have the burden of proving that intervention is obligatory. Instead, we have the burden of proving that intervention is not obligatory. To satisfy this burden, we have to prove that a criterion that makes intervention optional is satisfied-namely, a criterion about excessive costs. Just-intervention criteria should be stringent, so that the permission to intervene is not too readily obtained. Similarly, the excessive-costs criterion should be stringent, so that the obligation to intervene is not too readily avoided. THE HIDDENNESS OF GOD: A SECOND POSITIVE ARGUMENT FOR THE NON-EXISTENCE OF GOD ROBERT P LOVERING, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER A popular claim in the philosophy of religion is that there is only one positive argument for the non-existence of God, viz. the problem of evil. In this paper, I submit what I believe to be another positive argument for the non-existence of God. The argument is abductive in nature, and it pertains to the hiddenness of God. The argument can be stated in the form of a syllogism: Premise 1: If God exists, then we Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 129</page><page sequence="22">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 would expect him to make his existence (or evidence thereof) obvious to all people on a regular basis. Premise 2: God's existence is not obvious to all people on a regular basis. Conclusion: It is probable that God does not exist. This paper is concerned solely with defending the controversial first premise. NON-NATURAL QUALITIES IN G. E. MOORE: INHERENT OR CONTINGENT? MIODRAG LUKIC, UNIVERSITY OF BELGRADE G.E.Moore's theory of the nature of the quality referred to by the word "good" asserts that this quality is non-natural. I fit is, further, supposed that this non-natural quality belongs necessarily and exclusively to those events, human acts, entities, etc., which possess certain strictly determined natural qualities, and those qualities only, then it becomes difficult to explain the relation and the supposed interdependence allegedly existing between the two so disparate categories of qualities. Not even G.E.Moore seems to have successfully searched for this explanation. This paper purports to show that, in fact, any mutual dependence of natural and non-natural qualities, including the causal one, is inconceivable. To deny this would allow no less than the possibility of deriving an "ought" from an "is". A final consequence of this is that a non-natural quality, denoted by the predicate "good", does, in fact, attach to a strictly delineated and limited morally relevant behaviour (and whatever else we may consider morally relevant), and to it only. But it is attached therein randomly; it is contingent, not inherent; it is there without regard to, and not as a consequence of, the natural qualities of what is the subject of moral judgment ...whether we like it or not. A PARADOX OF PROMISING ALISTAIR M. MACLEOD, QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY When a contemplated action can be seen to be morally wrong but an agent promises to perform it nevertheless, does any moral value attach to the keeping of the promise? Holly Smith argues that the answer is NO, and that the reason is that no moral value ever attaches to the keeping of promises as such. I agree with her answer but not with her reason. The paper provides a critique of her solution to the paradox of promising -the paradox presented by the fact that an agent can determine the moral quality of a contemplated action, no matter how wrong it is, by simply promising to perform it. The critique points to an alternative solution to the paradox: whether the keeping of a promise has moral value depends, crucially, on whether the promised act, viewed independently of the promise to perform it, is a morally permissible act. 130</page><page sequence="23">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 131 CONCEPTION AS A POSSIBLE HARM TO A CHILD: A REFUTATION OF PARFIT JANET I. MALEK, RICE UNIVERSITY In this paper, I argue that it is possible for a parent to have harmed a child by conceiving her even if her life is worth living. Specifically, a parent can harm his child when he conceives her knowing that he will be unable or unwilling to ensure that her basic needs will be met. A parent harms an existing child if he fails to provide for her. Generally, an individual has an obligation to avoid bringing about a circumstance in which he is aware that he will do harm. By not conceiving a child, it is possible for a potential parent to avoid creating a situation in which he will harm that child and he is obliged to do so in many cases. As a result, a parent can have harmed a child by conceiving her if he is unable to ensure that her basic needs will be met. SARTRE AND THE STRUCTURE OF WHITE RACIALIZED IDENTITY STEVE MARTINOT, SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY Sartre is one of the few Euro-American philosophers who addressed racism directly. To understand white supremacy in the United States, we have to go beyond Anti-Semite and Jew. In the Critique of Dialectical Reasoning, Sartre discusses the seriality of white racism as a relation between whites for which black people (for instance, or brown) are the means, the mediation. As such, every white person is the milieu, constituted through a structure of racialization, for every other white person as identification. What becomes central is the socially peripheral notion of complicity. Complicity in this context can be understood as an ontic moment in one's Being-for-others. If this reveals the centrality of bad faith and inauthenticity in white identity, it also exposes the structure of its tenacity, in that racism traps anti-racism in its own terms, and thereby hermeticizes itself against it. IN PURSUIT OF CHIC: PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE JAPANESE AESTHETIC OF IKI GRAHAM L. MAYEDA, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO Kuki Shuzo's Iki no kozo (The Structure of iki), while inspired in many ways by phenomenology, also develops the basic transcendental structure of phenomenology in surprising ways. By focusing on Kuki's writings on iki, the paper seeks to outline the similarities and differences between Kuki's approach to aesthetics and the phenomenology of Bergson, Husserl and Heidegger. "Iki" is a term traditionally used to describe the sensibility and style of the Tokyo urban merchant class of the early part of the nineteenth-century. However, it is especially applied to the style of those who frequented the pleasure quarters, and has also come to indicate, not only the aesthetic sensibility of these people, but also the relationship that exists between a geisha and her lover.

There are two main feminist criticisms of Foucault's notion of the body. First, some feminists accuse him of androcentrism, because his account ignores the sexual specificity of the body. Second, some feminists argue that Foucault implicitly relies upon a pre-discursive, natural body and that this is at odds with the cultural inscription model of the body found in his work. I address both criticisms; I discuss feminist extensions of Foucault that do account for the sexual specificity of bodies. And, I argue that Foucault's contribution to a theory of the body cannot be captured by the cultural inscription model alone. I offer a new interpretation of Foucault's work on the body that can account for aspects of internalization and interpretation as well as inscription. VERIFICATIONISM AND INFERENTIALISM IN WITTGENSTEIN'S PHILOSOPHY JOSE M. MEDINA, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY This paper examines Wittgenstein's verificationist considerations in the early 1930s. My thesis is that what is at the core of Wittgenstein's philosophy in this period is not the notion of verification, but the notion of material inference. Arguing against Max Black and Alberto Coffa, I try to establish that Wittgenstein never held a verificationist theory of meaning, although his semantic views in the intermediate period were influenced by verificationist ideas. I conclude that Wittgenstein's verificationist considerations played only a methodological role in his inferentialist view. SUPERVENIENCE, MATERIALISM, AND CONCEIVABILITY: CRITIQUING THE CONTEXT OF CHALMERS' DUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY OF MIND KEVIN M. MEEKER, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA David Chalmers bas recently received much attention for arguing against a materialistic theory of mind and for a type of property dualism that is, according to him, naturalistically acceptable. Employing many examples invoking objects such as zombies, he contends, roughly speaking, that consciousness does not supervene on material states of affairs. Consciousness, then, is unlike nearly every other natural phenomenon, which does supervene on materialistic states of affairs. In this paper, I will not explicitly examine Chalmers' examples and arguments that purport to show that consciousness does not supervene on physical facts; I will instead challenge his assertion that (nearly) every other macro level property does supervene on microphysical facts. If 1 can successfully impugn his arguments for this conclusion, then 1 will undermine his contention that consciousness is extremely 132</page><page sequence="25">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 133 unique no matter how the debates about zombies and so forth are eventually resolved. How PRIMITIVE IS SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS?: AUTONOMOUS NONCONCEPTUAL CONTENT AND IMMUNITY TO ERROR THROUGH MISIDENTIFICATION ROBLIN R. MEEKS, CUNY-GRADUATE SCHOOL &amp; UNIVERSITY CENTER Traditionally, investigations into the nature of self-consciousness have focused on the peculiarities of the first-person pronoun. But can we extend the notion to non-language-using creatures as well, including pre-linguistic infants? Jose Luis Bermudez has recently argued that creatures possessing no conceptual abilities whatsoever nevertheless possess states that can be considered primitive forms of self- consciousness. I discuss one such form Bermudez gives-that of somatic proprioception-and show that it fails to concurrently satisfy the conditions he adopts for states funded by that type of perception to be representational as well as to be immune to error through misidentification. This conclusion forces a reevaluation of the notion of immunity to error through misidentification, including whether or not it should be adopted as a prerequisite for self-consciousness. PROTECTIONISM, FAIR TRADE, AND UNEQUAL EXCHANGE FROM THE COSMOPOLITAN POINT OF VIEW DARREL MOELLENDORF, UNIVERSITY OF THE WITWATERSRAND In this paper I evaluate trade tariffs in light of a principle of cosmopolitan fair equality of opportunity. Trade tariffs may be defended on at least three grounds: To protect domestic businesses and employment, to provide incentives for better working conditions and healthier environments, or to remedy unequal exchange. I argue that protectionist trade policies violate the principle of fair equality of opportunity. I argue further that although fair trade polices are superior to protectionist ones on this score, a better remedy for the evils recognized by advocates of fair trade policies and theorists of unequal exchange is the provision of subsidies for sustainable development. NEW INCONSISTENCIES IN INFINITE UTILITARIANISM BARBARA G. MONTERO, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH In the context of worlds with infinitely many bearers of utility, we argue that several collections of natural Utilitarian principles-principles which are certainly true in the classical finite Utilitarian context and which any Utilitarian would find appealing, such as the principle that adding utility to a world makes it no worse and that any world that is exactly as good as it is bad has on balance zero utility-are inconsistent. Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 133</page><page sequence="26">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 STATUES AND LUMPS: A STRANGE COINCIDENCE? MARK MOYER, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY Burke and Heller have argued against coincidence, claiming that if multiple objects of different sorts coincided, they would be qualitatively identical and therefore there would be no explanation for the fact that they belong to different sorts. Burke offers a temporal supervenience argument, but it rides on confused notions of 'identity across time' and 'the statue at t'. We can understand these phrases in multiple ways, but once disambiguated, the argument collapses. Heller offers a modal supervenience argument, but it infers that an object's non-modal properties must determine its modal properties since the modal is grounded in the modal. Popular accounts of modality show that this inference is unwarranted. "THIS MUTE AND PERMANENT QUESTION WHICH CONSTITUTES NORMAL SEXUALITY": MERLEAU-PONTY, "SEXED BEING" AND IDEOLOGY CHRISTOPHER NAGEL, CSU - STANISLAUS While the debate concerning the value of Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception for feminism has largely focused on the issue of masculine normativity in the description of sexuality in "The Body in its Sexual Being," the chapter itself takes sexuality as merely an example of body-subjective transcendence. Far from being an excuse for Merleau-Ponty, this raises a more fundamental question: what makes sexuality a key to understanding existence and transcendence? In a footnote to the chapter, Merleau-Ponty discusses the rise during labor crises of the ideological interpretation of society as primarily economic. I argue that this same "self-deception" is always at work when any interpretative term appears decisive. "Sexuality" arises as a key term during an analogous period of crisis, and is likewise ideological. PERSONAL IDENTITY UN-LOCKE-ED: SOME KEY POINTS ANDREW NAYLOR, INDIANA UNIVERSITY SOUTH BEND Psychological continuity theories of personal identity frequently go wrong, I argue, in formulating how the psychological states of a person are related diachronically, in failing to capture a truly appropriate causal connection between later and earlier psychological states, and in drawing conclusions about particular cases. After bringing out instances of such difficulties, I offer several examples and other considerations that support more directly an alternative, biological continuity theory of personal identity. 134</page><page sequence="27">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 135 SELF-DECEPTION, MOTIVATION, AND THE DESIRE TO BELIEVE DANA K. NELKIN, THE FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY In the debate over the nature of self-deception, "intentionalists" argue that self-deception requires an intention to deceive oneself, whereas "motivationists" argue that a desire, and not an intention, typically plays a crucial causal role in self-deception. Intentionalists have traditionally criticized motivationist views for leaving out what is distinctive about self-deception. Recently, motivationist views have also come under attack for being unable to account for cases of "twisted" self-deception (i.e., cases in which the self-deceiver has no desire that his self- deceptive belief be true.) In this paper, I offer a new motivationist account that borrows a key element from intentionalist accounts, namely, the desire to believe. I argue that this account identifies what is common to cases of both "twisted" and "straight" self-deception, and I show how, in so doing, the account captures what is distinctive about self-deception. PUZZLING PAIRS MICHAEL NELSON, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY Mark Richard contains a powerful account of the semantics of belief sentences. The account offers an explanation of our apparent substitution failure intuitions according to which substitution of co- referential proper names does not always preserve truth. Richard's account came under fire by a paper by Scott Soames, in which he showed that Richard's account entails counter-intuitive assignments of truth-value to certain sentence/context pairs. In this paper I argue that Soames's argument against Richard extends beyond just Richard's account. I argue that the tenets of Richard's account which give rise to the problem Soames isolates are tenets which any plausible account of our apparent substitution failure intuitions. I argue that the problem has a solution, but only if the account is an account of the information typically conveyed pragmatically by utterances of belief sentences, and not as an account of their semantics. UNDERSTANDING REID ON VISIBLE FIGURE RYAN NICHOLS, UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME Visible figure plays a problematic role in Reid's theory of perception because its status as an intermediary between our perceptual faculty and the world threatens Reid's direct realism. The confusion is textual and philosophical. I note the importance of this issue and its context in Reid's theory of perception, then I explain and justify my account of the ontological status of visible figure according to which visible figure is a relational property of an object by being a projection through ambient light of the dimensions representing a three-dimensional object's surface and edges. Next I defend the consistency of Reid's Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 135</page><page sequence="28">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 views on visible figure and his perceptual theses, i.e. that we perceive bodies directly and that we have immediate knowledge of bodies. This is facilitated with a pair of distinctions, both of which are present in Reid: between mental and physical perception, and between universal and sense-specific versions of direct realism. RIGHTS AS MORAL CONCLUSIONS MARK PERLMAN, WESTERN OREGON UNIVERSITY A major difficulty for theories of rights is that rights can conflict. One right, it is said, can override another, less pressing right, or a duty can be negated by a right, and so forth. On one hand this is advantageous, since it allows attribution of rights more liberally to many different people, and then makes allowances for conflicts between those rights. But it is also a drawback, for it leads to confusion as to whether or not a right is really present. This paper presents a different view of rights, that they are mere summaries of moral conclusions, thus making it a contradiction to say one can justly infringe on a right, or that it can be wrong to exercise one's right. WHAT A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF EMPTY NAMES CANNOT BE MATTHEW H. PHILLIPS, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY Recently, Salmon has proposed that certain putatively empty names- fictional names, and names generated by mistaken theories-are not really empty names at all, but rather referring terms. They refer to abstract objects; negative existentials about them are literally false, as are most predicative statements employing them (e.g., 'Holmes is a detective'). This proposal is intended to serve as a partial solution to the problem that empty names pose for Direct Reference theorists: insofar as empty names turn out not to be empty, there is no problem of empty names. I will not question this view as it is applied to names drawn from fiction. However, I will claim that this view can't be extended to names generated by mistaken scientific theories. Such names, I will claim, must be accepted as non-denoting, and Direct Reference theorists must find another way to meet the challenge posed by such names. THE SEMANTICS OF 'CHOCOLATE' AND OTHER NATURAL KIND TERMS MARK PHILPOTT, STANFORD UNIVERSITY Externalism makes the negative claim that meanings of natural kind terms are not determined solely by psychological facts about the speaker, and the Positive claim that such meanings are fixed once we take proper account of external factors like division of linguistic labor and hidden indexicality. The negative part of the thesis is right but the positive picture is mistaken. Considering the semantics of 'chocolate' teaches us that division of linguistic labor doesn't fix meaning, because 136</page><page sequence="29">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 137 deference of everyday meaning to the pronouncement of experts is not assured. A case study in veterinary parasitology shows that hidden indexicality fares no better. In-the-head conceptual content left meanings underdetermined, motivating externalism's move outside- the-head. With external factors also failing to fix meanings, a further look back inside the head is required. ALTER EGOS AND THEIR NAMES DAVID PITT, BROOKLYN COLLEGE Jennifer Saul claims that there are sentences containing no propositional-attitude, modal or quotational constructions that claims, exhibit failure of substitutivity of coreferential expressions. For example, whereas (1) Clark Kent is Superman's secret identity is true, (1') Superman is Superman's secret identity is not I argue that the assumption that 'Superman' and 'Clark Kent' are coreferential is false. They are names of alter egos, which are distinct from the person whose alter egos they are. I take alter egos to be sums of time-slices, hence, proper parts, of the individuals whose alter egos they are. Though it follows that (2) Superman is Clark Kent (2) is false, I argue that utterances of (2) may be interpreted as meaning that the referents of the terms of the identity are alter egos of the same person. I show that identity sentences are commonly used in such non-literal ways. COMPOSITIONALITY AND SEMANTIC THEORY GEORGE F. POWELL, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON Within the current philosophy of language, compositionality is taken to be a necessary constraint on semantic theory. In this paper I aim to explore the motivation behind this assumption and, given this motivation, just what constraint compositionality does place on semantic theory. I shall argue that the version of compositionality embodied in most semantic theories within the truth-conditional tradition is untenably strong. I shall then outline an approach to the semantics and pragmatics of natural language which offers a natural analysis of a range of semantic phenomena traditionally seen as problematic, while embodying a version of compositionality which, although weaker than that employed by truth-conditionalists, nevertheless satisfies the original intuitions upon which the assumption that theories of meaning must be compositional is based.

POWERS, SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY In the course of presenting his ethical theory, Kant introduces the controversial thesis that freedom of the will is necessary and sufficient for the moral law. My aim is to show how his exposition of this thesis commits him to a defeasible (and arguably anti-humanist) conception of human dignity. Though this view is rejected by most Kantians, I think there are textual and philosophical reasons for accepting it, and I provide some. My account turns on analyses of the consciousness of freedom in moral agency, the notion of "taking oneself seriously" as a moral agent, and the accepted practice of differential levels of rights and obligations in modem societies. ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN DESCRIPTION AND INTERPRETATION OF ARTWORKS STEPHEN A. REBER, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS In recent work in aesthetics, it has been argued that the distinction between the description and interpretation of works of art cannot be maintained in any principled way. This paper will present a theory of description of works of art that is based on our pre-theoretic understanding of the identity of the work, and which allows us to distinguish description from interpretation. The facts of the art work forming that work's pure (i.e. non-interpretive) description will be differentiated from the properties imputed to the work of art by a critic or interpreter seeking to make sense of that work by imputing a coherent design to it. Based on this distinction, an outline of an account of the interpretation of artworks, called "critical foundationalism" will be developed. SOCRATES ON WISDOM, GOOD LUCK, AND HAPPINESS: EUTHYDEMUS 279D6-280B3 NAOMI RESHOTKO, UNIVERSITY OF DENVER At Euthydemus 279d6, Socrates introduces good luck as a supposedly good thing to be added to the list of other supposedly good things that occurs at 279a. Everything on this list, with the exception of wisdom, is later found to be neither good nor bad. While Socrates treats good luck somewhat differently from any of those other neither good nor bad things, Socrates' point in bringing it into the conversation is to show that there is no such thing as antecedently good circumstances for living a good life-luck is always neither good nor bad. In demonstrating this to be the emphasis of the passage at 279d6-280b3, I make it clear that Socrates in not, herein, committed to the thesis that virtue (wisdom) is sufficient for happiness. I 138</page><page sequence="31">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 139 WHAT COMPOSITIONALITY STILL CAN DO PHILIP A. ROBBINS, UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT Proponents of deflationism about meaning are wont to claim that, properly understood, the Principle of Compositionality (PC) places no constraint whatsoever on the nature of lexical meaning. This deflationary thesis admits of both a strong and a weak reading. On the strong reading, PC does not rule out any theory of lexical meaning either alone or in conjunction with other independently well-motivated semantic assumptions. On the weak reading, PC alone does not rule out any such theory. I argue that, though weak deflationism about compositionality has better initial prospects than strong, neither version of the thesis is credible. In particular, weak deflationism cannot be maintained in conformity with the deflationist commitment to explaining facts about phrasal meanings in compositional terms, that is, by appeal to facts about the lexicon. LANGUAGE AND WORLD: AGAINST FOUNDATIONALISM IN ETHICS LAURA K. ROBERTS, UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, URBANA-CHAMPAIGN The desire for solid foundations for ethical and political commitments has taken myriad forms, and Habermas's attempt to ground ethics is particularly important because it takes seriously the diversity of human practices and socialization. Theorists like Habermas mistakenly fear that a lack of foundations undermines claims like those found in Martin Luther King's "Letter From Birmingham City Jail," such as "Any law that degrades human personality is unjust." Foundationalists are dissatisfied with the idea that moral and political disagreements float amidst the shifting currents of the lives and practices of those who are engaged in them. I argue that while Habermas's theory at best offers only an empty description of normative validity, King's "Letter" taken in context can illuminate many of the complexities of meaningful ethical discourse against a background of power inequality. JACKSON'S APOSTASY WILLIAM S. ROBINSON, IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY In a 1998 postscript, Frank Jackson has declared the failure of the "knowledge argument" against physicalism, and has given a brief explanation of the reason for his new position. The statement of this reason is too compressed to be clear, so the first task of the present paper is to develop a defensible explicit interpretation of Jackson's argument. The second task is to evaluate this argument. It is found to beg the question against proponents of the knowledge argument, although which question is begged depends on how we understand the relation between having an opinion about qualities of experiences and knowing about them. A tentative explanation is given of why Jackson's argument features the possibility of false 'memory' traces as sources of alleged new knowledge. Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 139</page><page sequence="32">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 SOCRATIC PERFECTIONISM GEORGE RUDEBUSCH, NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY There are passages in which Socrates appears to be committed to versions of egoism. In other passages, Socrates seems to hold a view incompatible with egoism. There have been two strategies for reconciling these texts: make Socrates an egoist for whom virtue is merely an instrumental good, or broaden the egoism and make Socrates a eudaemonist. I raise problems for both strategies and suggest a third solution: perfectionism, which I distinguish from both egoism and eudaemonism. LIMITS FOR REDUCTIVE EXPLANATIONS ALEXANDER RUEGER, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, EDMONTON The preference for explanations of the behaviour of a system in terms of the behaviour of sub-systems at a 'basic' level - 'reductive explanations' - is often related (at least in the physical sciences) to the success of a formal technique of analyzing the system in an approximate way. This technique - perturbation theory - serves to extract insight into the workings of a system from a supposedly exact but intractable mathematical description. The preference for this style of explanation, however, can be justified only in the case of 'regular' perturbation problems. For the much more frequent case of 'singular' perturbation problems, various modifications of regular perturbation techniques have been developed which all introduce a hierarchy of levels or scales into the solutions, describing, e.g., processes or sub- systems operating simultaneously at different time or spatial scales. No single level, no reductive explanation in the above sense, will provide an adequate explanation of the system behaviour. EXPLAINING THE "INHERENESS" OF QUALIA REPRESENTATIONALLY: WHY WE SEEM TO HAVE A VISUAL FIELD DAN RYDER, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL One line of argument against the representationalist about qualia has been to appeal to features of the "visual field" as properties of experiences that are inexplicable on the representationalist picture. I counter that the visual field is something we invent to serve as object for some "2-D representations" in the visual system, representations that are silent about the dimension of depth. Current empirical results support this hypothesis. I conclude that 2-D representations go some way towards explaining the mystery of qualia. 140</page><page sequence="33">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers REID AND EPISTEMIC NATURALISM PATRICK W RYSIEW, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Central to the contemporary dispute over 'naturalizing epistemology' is the question of the continuity of epistemology with (the rest of) science. This question in turn is understood by most as reducing to the question of how far purely descriptive, psychological matters can/ should inform the traditional, evaluative epistemological enterprise. Thus, (epistemic) naturalists and non-naturalists alike are fairly convinced that the distinction between psychology and epistemology corresponds to a fairly hard-and-fast fact-value distinction. This is something Reid denies: While insisting on the continuity of epistemology with the rest of science, Reid does not wish to derive an "ought" from an "is", or to reduce the epistemological to the psychological. His view is that the First Principles of Common Sense are simultaneously descriptive and prescriptive, and thus that with regard to the constitutive principles of our credal and epistemic practices there is simply no fact-value gap to be bridged. EVOLUTIONARY RELIABILISM: WHAT'S TRUTH GOTTA DO WITH IT? JAMES A. SAGE, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH Many philosophers hold both of the following claims: N human cognitive faculties result from natural selection R human cognitive faculties reliably produce true beliefs In Warrant and Proper Function, Alvin Plantinga argues that accepting N gives us good reason to doubt R. But if we have good reason to doubt R, then we have good reason to doubt any belief produced by human faculties, including N, and so belief in N is epistemically self-defeating. In a forthcoming paper entitled "Naturalism Defended," William Ramsey attempts to rescue N from Plantinga's attack. His attempt is based on a position he calls "Evolutionary Reliabilism." I object to Ramsey's position by arguing that it relies on a circular account of how to appraise our cognitive faculties as well as a circular account of how to best explain adaptive behavior in terms of truth. Hence, Plantinga's argument that N is self- defeating is left unscathed. PERDURANCE AND PREDICATION THOMAS B. SATTIG, OXFORD UNIVERSITY Perdurance is existence at different times by having different temporal parts at different times. The standard perdurantist analysis of temporal predication de re is the following: necessarily, an object x is N at a time t iff x has a temporal part at t that is N simpliciter. In the present paper this analysis is shown to be untenable on the grounds that it requires that by being N a temporal part represents the whole of which it is a part as being N. 141</page><page sequence="34">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 DESCARTES AND THE PRIMACY OF PRACTICE: THE ROLE OF THE PASSIONS IN THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH AMY M. SCHMITTER, UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO This paper argues that Descartes conceives of theoretical reason in terms derived from practical reason, particularly in the role he gives to the passions. That the passions serve-under "normal" circumstances-to preserve the union of mind and body is a well- known feature of Descartes's defense of our native make-up. But they are equally important in our more purely theoretical endeavors. Some passions, most notably "wonder," provide a crucial source of motivation in the search after truth, and also serve to reinforce memory . Our cognitive successes and failures can also be tracked by passions and trains of passions. My aim in the present paper is to show that this analysis is untenable. A PARADOX OF DEMOCRACY SIBYL SCHWARZENBACH, BARUCH COLLEGE AND THE GRADUATE CENTER Aristotle recognized that in principle democracy embodies the value of fraternity (philia) between equals to a greater extent than do other regimes, and he argued that political friendship between citizens is a prerequisite for genuine justice in any state (NE 1 155a). Paradoxically, modern liberalism stresses the freedom and equality of persons, but has little to say about friendship and this in an ostensibly democratic regime. I argue that key to resolving this "paradox of democracy" is to focus on a form of activity that has been performed in the last centuries largely by women: what I call reproductive activity in an extended ethical sense. For it turns out Aristotle is right. A public version of such activity is required for democracy in a deeper sense - for achieving and maintaining a civic friendship between equals, and hence the possibility of genuine justice. IS RACISM IN THE 'HEART'? TOMMIE SHELBY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY This essay critically examines Jorge Garcia's recent defense of what he calls a volitional conception of racism. According to this conception, racism is rooted, not in the content or irrationality of certain beliefs about so-called "races," as is commonly supposed, but in the "heart" of the racist-i.e., in his or her wants, intentions, hopes, fears, predilections, aversions, and so on. Garcia suggests that we view racism as "a vicious kind of racially based disregard for the welfare of certain people." I argue that Garcia's account rests on dubious methodological principles; that it underestimates the significance of racist beliefs in an adequate analysis of racism; and that it wrongly takes a vicious heart to be necessary for racism. 142</page><page sequence="35">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 143 INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MOLINIST MIDDLE KNOWLEDGE JOSEPH SHIEBER, BROWN UNIVERSITY I develop and discuss an argument designed to demonstrate that the Molinist notion of middle knowledge, and in particular the concept of conditionals of freedom, is incompatible with the notion of individual responsibility (for created creatures). In section I, I introduce the Molinist concepts of middle knowledge and counterfactuals of freedom. In section II, I develop an argument to the effect that, due to his construal of the concepts of middle knowledge and counterfactuals of freedom, the Molinist is not entitled to the notion of individual responsibility. I then discuss criticisms of the argument in the closing section, section III. Ultimately, I contend that the argument is unsuccessful as an internal argument against the Molinist. RELIABILITY, EPISTEMIC SELF-DEFEAT, AND SKEPTICISM DONALD P SMITH, UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME Standard externalist theories of knowledge contain a reliability condition, according to which an individual, S, knows some proposition, p, only if the belief-producing process or processes responsible for S's believing that p is/are reliable. I will argue that such theories of knowledge are epistemically self-defeating, and, more broadly, lead to a certain kind of skepticism. "THE ANIMAL IS WORLD-POOR": A HEIDEGGERIAN CONTRIBUTION TO THE ANIMAL RIGHTS DEBATE GARY STEINER, BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY In recent years, Peter Singer and Tom Regan have each attempted to counter the conventional wisdom of the Western philosophical tradition, according to which animals neither enjoy moral rights nor are due moral obligations. Singer and Regan have both maintained that animals possess a kind of "subjectivity," Singer arguing that animals deserve to be included in our utilitarian moral calculus and Regan arguing that animals should be recognized as bearers of rights. A line of thinking from one of Heidegger's early lecture courses opens up the possibility of an entirely different way of thinking about animals, one that does not seek to reduce the experience of animals to anthropomorphic categories like subjectivity and intentionality, but instead conceptualizes our relationship to animals in terms of Heidegger's notion of dwelling and thereby takes a step in the direction of detaching considerations of the moral worth of animals from considerations of their cognitive abilities.

For them numbers are sets-and they are very well aware of the existence of multiple models of the Peano Axioms. For mathematicians, the Benacerraf arguments have little or no force. That is because there are good mathematical reasons to identify the natural numbers with the finite von Neumanns (e.g. continuity at transfinite limits and cardinality as 1-1 correspondence ). I present those reasons and argue that the Peano Axioms do not exhaust the mathematical concept of natural number. So: 2 is { { } { { } } }. Isomorphisms between models of the Peano Axioms are like counterpart relations. The Zermelo counterpart of 2, for example, is not 2. Numbers are sets. FOUNDATIONALISM, SENSE-EXPERIENTIAL CONTENT, AND SELLARS'S DILEMMA MATTHIAS STEUP, ST. CLOUD STATE UNIVERSITY According to foundationalism, the following two theses are true: (1) Sense experience is a source of justification. (2) Some empirical beliefs are basic: justified without receiving their justification from any other beliefs. I defend (1) against Davidson's argument that sense experience is devoid of propositional content and thus cannot stand in a justificatory relation to beliefs, and (2) against Sellars's well-known dilemma, which I construe as follows: Sense experiential states either have propositional content, or they do not. If they do, then they cannot play the role of justifiers without being justified themselves, and thus fail to stop the justificatory regress. But if they do not have propositional content, they cannot play the role of justifiers at all. In response, I argue that sense experiential states are not the sort of mental states that admit of justification, and thus can justify without having to be justified themselves. BACK-TRACKING IN CLOSEST COUNTERFACTUAL WORLDS MARK SYLVESTER, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK David Lewis' small-miracle account of counterfactual truth does not seem to allow for back-tracking, extrapolating from a counterfactual present to a past consequent. Lewis himself acknowledges this, but he does not take this to be a problem with his theory. Rather, he sees this as a consequence of there being "no true counterfactuals that say in any detail how the immediate past would be if the present were different." I believe that some back-tracking is possible, and so I will provide an account how the small-miracle approach can accomodate this intuition in a way that neatly limits the extent to which back-tracking is possible. 144</page><page sequence="37">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 145 COSMOPOLITANISM AND PARTIALITY KOK-CHOR TAN, QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY How can we reconcile, or put in a "reflective equilibrium", our cosmopolitan belief that individuals are the ultimate units of moral worth and entitled to equal consideration, and our commonsense belief that people may show greater concern to their conationals over strangers? There are four possible courses of action here. (a) One is to reject the practice of conational partiality, or any form of partiality, as illegitimate from the moral point of view (call this the strict impartialist position); (b) another is to accept the practice of conational partiality but only within cosmopolitan constraints (constrained partiality). These two options attempt to defend cosmopolitanism by either limiting conational partiality or rejecting it entirely. On the other hand, one might opt to reconsider one's cosmopolitan belief in light of this partiality claim, on the ground that (c) the fact of conational partiality shows the incoherence of the cosmopolitan moral view (anti-cosmopolitanism), or by arguing that (d) cosmopolitanism properly understood justifies the practice of conational partiality even in the context of global inequality (restricted cosmopolitanism). I survey these four options, and argue that the constrained partiality view is the most plausible one. ACTING WITH FEELING FROM DUTY JULIE TANNENBAUM, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES A central claim in Kantian ethics is that an agent is properly morally motivated just in case she acts from duty alone. Bernard Williams, Michael Stocker, and Justin Oakley claim that certain emotionally infused actions, such as lending a compassionate helping hand, can only be done from compassion and not duty. I argue that these critics have overlooked a distinction between an action's manner, how an action is done, and its motive, the agent's reason for acting. Through a range of examples I demonstrate how an emotion can determine an action's manner without also serving as the motive. Thus, it is possible for an agent to act compassionately from duty alone. This distinction between the manner and the motive of an action not only restores a central claim in Kantian ethics but it also allows for an expanded role of emotions in moral action. INQUIRY WITHOUT NAMES IN PLATO'S CRATYLUS' CHRISTINE J. THOMAS, DARTMOUTH COLLEGE Plato's Cratylus positively recommends learning, discovering, and inquiring without names (aneu onomaton). The dialogue's interlocutors reach the bold conclusion that "it is far better to learn and to inquire from the things themselves than from their names" (439b6-8; 439a6-b3). It is not at all clear, though, what exactly it is to Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 145</page><page sequence="38">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 learn without names. And unhappily there is no well-developed account in the Cratylus of inquiry without names. But we are not left at a complete loss. Plato provides a few robust clues as to the nature of the sort of inquiry he favors. Commentators have interpreted Plato as encouraging either nonlinguistic cognitive contact with forms or empirical study of nature. I defend the view, however, that Plato means to highlight his abiding commitment to the view that dialectical inquiry into first principles is the best and clearest form of inquiry. THE REASONS WE SHARE CRYSTAL L. THORPE, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA The internalist claims that in order for an agent to have a reason to N there must be a sound deliberative route leading from one or more of her particular desires to the conclusion to N. How does the internalist account for reasons that we all share? The received view is that an internal reason can be true of all agents if and only if it is grounded in a particular desire that all agents have. In this paper I argue against the received view. I show that all agents can share the same internal reason to N regardless of whether they have any particular desires in common. This argument, if successful, will force us to revise our intuitions about internal reasons, for it is commonly thought that only external reasons can be shared in this way. Do MEINONG'S IMPOSSIBLE OBJECTS ENTAIL CONTRADICTIONS? MICHAEL THRUSH, UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME Meinong's theory of objects commits him to impossibilia: objects which have contradictory properties. Russell famously objected that these impossibilia were apt to infringe the law of noncontradiction. Meinong's defenders have often relied upon the distinction between internal and external negation, a defense that only works against less exotic impossibilia. The more exotic impossibilia fall victim to an argument that uses an intuitively attractive logical principle similar to the abstraction principle, but which is not subject to Russell's paradox. The upshot is that things are not as bad as Russell claims. Some impossibilia don't entail contradictions. Still, things are still disastrous for Meinong. Some of his impossibilia do entail contradictions. FROM CONSTITUTIONALISM TO ANIMALISM CHRISTOPHER TOLLEFSEN, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA Animalism holds that you and I are essentially animal organisms. Recently, Lynn Rudder Baker has attacked this account of the nature of human persons. Baker calls her account of the relation between animals and persons the Constitution View. While her account of the nature of constitution has much to offer, it does not offer an adequate account of the nature of persons, and their relation to animal organisms. 146</page><page sequence="39">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 147 In this paper, I show how the strengths of the Constitution View in dealing with artifacts and material constitution are weaknesses when dealing with human persons. These weaknesses give good reason for returning to some variation of the Animalist view of the nature of human persons. ANSELM'S EQUIVOCATION DAVID A. TRUNCELLITO, NATIONAL CHUNG CHENG UNIVERSITY St. Anselm's ontological argument for the existence of God has been much discussed for centuries in philosophical and theological circles. Notoriously, although most agree that the argument is not sound, there is no consensus as to what, exactly, is the flaw in the argument. In this essay, I propose what I take to be a novel criticism of the argument, one which makes it clear not only that the argument is not sound, but that it cannot be, for deep and important reasons. COUNTERFACTUALS FOR CONSEQUENTIALISTS JEAN-PAUL VESSEL, UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS - AMHERST That all subjunctive conditionals with true antecedents and true consequents are themselves also true is implied by every plausible and popularly endorsed account. But I am wary of endorsing this implication. I argue that all presently endorsed accounts fail to capture the nature of subjunctive conditionals in contexts of consequentialist reasoning. I attempt to show that we must allow for the possibility that some subjunctive conditionals with true antecedents and true consequents are false, if we are to believe that certain types of straightforward consequentialist reasoning are coherent. I begin by evaluating a pair of morally relevant counterfactuals in a case via Lewis's account. I then turn to a slight modification of the case, arguing that Lewis's semantics fails to generate the correct truth values of the subjunctive conditionals in the modified case. Finally, I present an modified version of Lewis's semantics that generates the correct results in all cases. NOMINALISM AND NATURALISM IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS SUSAN N. VINEBERG, WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY In response to the indispensability arguments of Quine and Putnam, a variety of nominalist programs have been developed to show that the use of mathematics in science is compatible with the view that abstract mathematical objects do not exist. It has been claimed by Burgess and Rosen that the resulting nominalized versions of science are inferior on scientific grounds to the standard mathematical versions of scientific theory that quantify over platonic domains. Consequently, they maintain that naturalism counsels accepting the standard theories, and with them mathematical objects. I argue here that scientific practice does not yield evidence for mathematical realism over nominalism in the Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 147</page><page sequence="40">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 way Burgess and Rosen suppose, and that the nominalist programs they discuss have an important naturalistic underpinning that they overlook. GROWING INDIVIDUALS AND INTRINSIC PROPERTIES BRIAN J. WEATHERSON, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY I argue that the objects we refer to in everyday discourse have past and present temporal parts, but not future temporal parts. This hypothesis appears to be the best available solution to the problem of temporary intrinsics, and to what I call the problem of long-term intrinsics. The hypothesis also offers an attractive explanation of some surprising phenomena concerning tense and speech reports. THE A PRIORI, EXTERNALISM, AND THE PURPOSES OF JUSTIFICATION JONATHAN M. WEINBERG, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY Two streams in recent epistemology show interesting signs of flowing together: the resurgence of interest in the a priori, and the persistence of externalist programs. At first glance, the idea of an 'externalist rationalism' strikes one as odd. The a priori is the realm of the truths of reason, after all, and externalism is typically associated with empiricist, 'naturalizing' programmes in philosophy. But on closer inspection, an alliance between externalism and rationalism begins to make sense. This paper examines our theoretical motivations for the category of the a priori, i.e., extra-empirical sources of justification; and our background desiderata for justificatory norms, i.e., having beliefs that are inter-temporally reliable, and allowing the formation and facilitation of cooperative research and cognition by communities of investigators. It is argued that our justificatory norms, though motivating a general internalist constraint on justification, also requires a broad exemption from such internalism for the a priori. SELFLESSNESS AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELF: IS DEFERENCE COMPATIBLE WITH AGENCY? ANDREA C. WESTLUND, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN In this paper, I investigate the implications of self-abnegating deference for autonomous agency. Using Thomas Hill Jr.'s character the "Deferential Wife" as my central case, I argue that systematic deference can compromise one's autonomy even where the deference is voluntary and reflectively endorsed. I argue that self-abnegating deference involves abdicating a form of responsibility for self that is central to autonomous agency. This form of self-responsibility consists in a disposition to hold oneself answerable to an external perspective on one's commitments, and it requires taking a self-critical stance that is inaccessible to one who grants unconditional authority to the will of some particular other or others. 148</page><page sequence="41">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 149 CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS, CIRCULARITY, AND THE COMMITMENTS OF PHYSICALISM DONALD G. WITMER, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA Frank Jackson has recently defended the claim that if physicalism is true, then we ought to be able to deduce, a priori, from a purely physical description of the world, its true psychological description. His argument depends on a rehabilitation of the traditional view that we can know a priori which truths are strictly necessary. I resist his conclusion, not by attacking that traditional view, but by showing how one can accept it and still resist the "a priori deducibility" thesis. In so doing I show how circular conceptual analyses can be made to do the work a physicalist needs them to do. HUMOR AS A TOOL OF NORMATIVITY MICHAEL P WOLF, KALAMAZOO COLLEGE This paper presents a position on the pragmatic significance of humor. Setting aside questions of the aesthetic and phenomenal qualities of the experience of humor, I focus on its role in correcting and enforcing adherence to the norms of other social practices. I emphasize that humor can come in two forms, a congenial and a denunciatory one. In the former, we correct and reaffirm the status of other agents within the practice, while in the latter we excoriate others and make no amends. Though this makes even good clean fun sound cruel, I argue that when looked upon in the right light, most forms of humor can be reconciled with our moral and political obligations. FORMS OF INDIVIDUALS IN PLOTINUS KENNETH WOLFE, REED COLLEGE Plotinus believes there are forms not just of universals but also of individuals, for two reasons. First, he believes that intelligible forms of individuals are necessary for explaining the observable differences in the physical world. Secondly, he believes that they are necessary for explaining the human being's capacity to achieve intellection and commune with the divine Intellect. He deals with many problems that arise for this doctrine. He denies the existence of identical twins and admits that not all, but only some, physical things have individual intelligible archetypes. To harmonise his thesis with the doctrine of the soul's transmigration, Plotinus claims that every soul contains the formative principles for all the forms but at any given time actualises only some of them. To guarantee the finitude and thus knowability of the forms, Plotinus adapts the Stoic doctrine of the periodic return of the physical world. Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 149</page><page sequence="42">Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, 74:3 KANT'S IMMEDIATISM, POST-1781 JULIAN WUERTH, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA The notes on Kant's lectures on anthropology published in October 1997 reveal Kant's commitment throughout the 1770s to our capacity for immediate consciousness of ourselves as simple, substantial things in themselves. This essays argues that Kant remains committed to these conclusions even after 1781. Kant maintains that pure apperception reveals our absence of determinate qualities and so our simplicity and substantiality in the negative sense that we are not extended in space or time and are distinct from our accidents. Our indeterminacy cuts both ways, though, and so we cannot hope to extract determinate conclusions from these notions of simplicity and substantiality, such as our inability to decompose or our permanence, much less our immortality. We thus have the same negative conception of noumena in relation to ourselves as in relation to all other noumena, the only difference being our non-inferential awareness of being this thing without determinate qualities. AQUINAS AND THE STOICS ON THE FREEDOM OF THE DIVINE WILL COLEEN P ZOLLER, EMORY UNIVERSITY Recently scholars have argued that Aquinas had a libertarian incompatibilist position on the freedom of the divine will. Opposing this view, I will identify the influence of Stoic compatibilism on Aquinas. The mistaken impression concerning Aquinas' compatibilism reflects the misreading of Stoicism that Aquinas himself inherited. Aquinas' compatibilism is unambiguous once one understands that he argues for a dual causality jointly exercised between God and natural causal agents. Once it is established that Aquinas maintains that providence is fulfilled by natural causal agents, it is clear that fate and necessity are distinct notions. So long as the historical Stoicism is borne in mind, we can dismiss Aquinas' otherwise puzzling rejections of Stoicism as his own misinformation about the actual Stoic doctrine of compatibilism. As a result, we can demonstrate Aquinas' compatibilism and appreciate the incorporation of a major Stoic theme into Aquinas' thought. ON KNOWING THE GOOD AND NOT CARING LESS MATT ZWOLINSKI, UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA, TUSCON This paper examines several aspects of Michael Smith's argument in favor of metaethical internalism, as presented in chapter three of The Moral Problem. I first argue that Smith fails to provide us with sufficient reason to doubt the possibility of a rational amoralist. Furthermore, Smith's challenge to explain the reliable connection between judging an act to be morally right and being motivated to perform that act can be met simply by supposing that most people have a desire to do what 150</page><page sequence="43">Abstracts of Colloquium Papers 151 is good. Smith's use of the distinction between de re and de dicto motivation to respond to this objection fails for two reasons: 1) Smith's account of de re motivation can save internalism only by abandoning a commitment to other plausible aspects of his theory, and 2) Smith's account of de dicto motivation underestimates the extent to which such motivation can be genuinely moral in the relevant sense.</page></plain_text>
