<plain_text><page sequence="1">Regional Reports v -C/ ~ \?' "" LIZA KIRWIN Every collection in the Archives has its own story about where it came from and how it got here. Papers are usually donated by the owner or their relatives, or be- queathed to the Archives, but occasionally an unsus- pected trove turns up in an odd place. These serendipitous discoveries make us aware that the past is an incomplete puzzle, but also give us hope that unknown pieces will eventually surface and be saved. The latest gift of Jervis McEntee (1828-1891) papers is such a collection. The donor, William Gaffken, headed an insurance company in Kingston, New York - Trem- per, Gaffken &amp; McEntee - that acquired the McEntee family insurance firm many years ago, along with some of the office furniture. Mr. Gaffken recently found sixty letters to McEntee and some miscellaneous papers, dating from 1861 to 1891, in one of the old McEntee desks. Herbert L. Schultz, a local historian who had taken an interest in McEntee, advised Mr. Gaffken to donate the material to the Archives. McEntee, a second generation Hudson River School painter, was at the center of the American art world at the end of the nineteenth century. A charter resident of the Tenth Street Studio Building in New York, his fellow residents and friends were the leading artists of the day. Included in this acquisition are letters from Frederic Ed- win Church, Sanford R. Gifford, Eastman Johnson, Launt Thompson, John Ferguson Weir, and Worthington Whit- tredge. There are also pages from McEntee's sketchbook, newspaper clippings, a manuscript by McEntee titled "Sketch of John Vanderlyn's Life," and letters and clip- pings about McEntee's brother-in-law and sister, archi- tect Calvert Vaux and his wife. McEntee's friends wrote to him about sketching ex- cursions in the Catskills, exhibitions in New York and Paris, and commented on their paintings and the role of the artist in society. On July 22, 1867, John Ferguson Weir, whose work focused on industrial themes, de- scribed the challenge of his latest painting, The Forge, in which he literally hoped to forge a union between every- day reality and romantic sentiment: I think I have a good subject and strong too. Although dev- ilish hard to treat, and about eighteen inches beyond my capacity to grasp. It is so very practical, so severely prosaic, abounding in ugly but necessary mechanical appliances. And to combine with that and throw over it a veil of senti- ment strong enough to make it impressive as a work of Art and an epic, is just what I must attempt but feel by no means sure of accomplishing. The subject matter of paintings was an important issue among McEntee's friends. In 1867, Worthington Whit- tredge commented on the critical response he had re- ceived at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, when his painting Birches was hung above Frederic Edwin Church's Niagara: [the] writer's notions of landscape painting are that the representations of great subjects like Niagara are altogether necessary for us to make an impression abroad. I wonder if Frenchmen think so, because if they do I am prodigiously sorry I have anything there. I am sorry anyway. Whittredge was disgusted by the idea of a "popular artist" in America. He advocated asceticism: I think it would do you and I [sic] first rate good to damn all society for a year or two perhaps for the next fifty years and go to the Academy and draw ... I think we do not study hard enough. We do not study nearly so hard as the French artists do. It may seem as if we could not do more, but they do do more. They study night and day and fore- go society. . . . I think we have to come to simpler lives, and harder work and more secluded lives, and more earnest lives. This latest group of McEntee letters adds to the Archives substantial material about McEntee and throws addi- tional light on the relationships among his friends and on their artistic aspirations and attitudes toward society in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. While the McEntee papers had an uncommon prove- nance, the papers of sculptor Seymour Lipton (1903- 1986) came to us through more conventional channels-- the heirs of the artist. The papers, covering the years 1917 to 1985, consist of childhood drawings, correspondence, notes and writings on art, address books, scrapbooks, photographs, slides, motion picture film, and video and audio tapes. The collection is unusual for the variety of primary sources and the large percentage of unpublished writings. Some of this material, the earlier correspond- ence and writings, was lent and microfilmed in 1969. The Archives of American Art and the National Mu- seum of American Art jointly sponsored a symposium, "Cult, Culture and Consumers: Collecting the Work of Self-Taught Artists in Twentieth Century America," on 35</page><page sequence="2">-:f .:f-:::?..: I MINZ nX t AiJt~~t~~lil' t 1 Eli M.. f: F~_?*9 fa- -wil ... .. ... :: ::ff t ?:. ....... ... :,N:. ............. 1 ?~n~...... .... ... Seymour Lipton in the Betty Parsons Gallery with his works (left to right) Pioneer, Earth Force, Viking, and Prophet. October 26, 1990, in conjunction with a major exhibition, Made with Passion: The Hemphill Folk Art Collection, at the National Museum of American Art. The symposium examined how the work of the self-taught artist fared in the commercial, collecting, and curatorial worlds. Pres- entations were given by Avis Berman, art critic and writer ("Pioneering the Unsanctified Past: The Role of Women in the Discovery, Promotion, and Collecting of American Folk Art"); Susan L. F. Isaacs, doctoral candidate in folk- lore and folklife, University of Pennsylvania (" 'Last in a Long Line': Buying the Folk Image in Contemporary America"); Kinshasha Conwill, executive director, The Studio Museum in Harlem ("In Search of an 'Authentic' Vision: Issues of Subversion, Consumption, and Liber- ation in Collecting Works by African American Self-Taught Artists"); Richard Nonas, sculptor ("Justified Margins: Seeking the Soul of Art"); Donald Kuspit, professor of art history and philosophy, State University of New York at Stoney Brook ("Street Smart: The Appropriation of Marginal Artists in the 1980s"); and Judith McWillie, associate professor of painting and drawing, University of Georgia at Athens ("A House of Keys: Conscience, Context, and the New Collector"). Kenneth Ames, chief of the Historical Survey New York State Museum in Al- bany, and Wanda Corn, chair of the Department of Art at Sanford University, served as respondents. ?- ------ ----- ? !l i i : c- ? ," "' ?? . / , /  ,....., ..................... .....

This quarter the Archives has been given a large number of glass negatives of photographs of him, his family, and work. They document his European travels and, to the degree to which photographs can, reveal his relations with fam- ily and fellow artists. For a number of years the Vose Galleries of Provi- dence and Boston assiduously collected press reviews of exhibitions--its own and those elsewhere, particularly in New York and London--and press biographies and obituaries of art-world figures. The thousands of clip- pings, dating from the 1890s to the 1940s, provide ex- ceptionally rich secondary documentation of art-world activities during the period. Particularly well documented is Vose's transformation during these fifty years from a dealer in Barbizon, Old Master, and English paintings to a leading seller of conservative contemporary American painting. The file, comparable in size to the clipping files maintained by leading art reference libraries (which are among our most-used microfilmed loan collections), is a major acquisition. Benjamin Kopman (1887-1965) was a member of the New York group of painters and printmakers called 36</page><page sequence="3">The Introspectives who worked during the first quarter of this century in a vapid symbolist style that faintly echoed contemporary European work. A newly acquired group of Kopman's papers contains photographs of Kop- man, his work, his family, and other artists; and sketches and prints by several of his colleagues, including Felix Russman, Jennings Tofel, and Claude Buck. We await the gift of Kopman's letters to his wife, written at the height of his modest renown, which should reveal much more about the group's artistic intentions. The Archives has been given detailed research files on Beatrice Cuming (1903-1974) and her work, compiled for a recent exhibition at the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London, Connecticut. A precocious child-artist in her native Brooklyn, after graduating from Pratt Institute and studying in France Cuming settled in New London, where she had a career as a watercolorist and mural painter. A Connecticut priest, William Dolan Fletcher (1918- 1988) was an indefatigable collector of work by the print- makers Gerald Brockhurst, Clare Leighton, Keith Shaw Williams, and Eugene Higgins. In late 1990 we received Fletcher's useful research files, which include photo- graphs, correspondence, and journals kept by Williams from the 1930s to the 1950s. The Print Club of Albany presented the Archives a microfilm of its records, which date from 1934 to 1986. This artists' organization has carried on a steady exhi- bition program for almost sixty years, showing regional artists for the most part, but frequently including work by major American printmakers.

Of particular note were the following: the sizable research files on nineteenth-century artists who visited the White Mountains of New Hampshire, com- piled by the late Catherine Campbell (1916-1989); correspondence with John Taylor Arms and manuscripts of writings by Bolton Brown (1864-1936), an eminent authority on lithographic processes and founder of the art department at Stanford University; family correspon- dence of the painters Charles (1864-1940) and Marcia Oakes Woodbury (1865-1914); letters received by Henry Sayles Francis from George Norbert Kates (1895-1990), a noted authority on pre-Communist China and Chinese decorative arts; the papers of the prominent Boston art critic and museum educator William Germain Dooley (1904-1975); papers, including sketchbooks, of the noted portrait painter Gardner Cox (1906-1988); and the file kept by Kenneth Noland (b. 1924) on the sculptor David Smith. The New England Committee, the group of volunteers that develops programs for members as well as fund- raising events, and Archives staff held a benefit preview of an art and design exposition on October 11, 1990. The show, Images &amp; Objects: Art and Design of the 20th Century, was the most important one of its kind ever held in Boston. Some four hundred people attended the preview, and several thousand saw the show during its three-day run. / ,i ...... .. ..... ... . ......... :, - ......... ..... .. . . . .......-..... ...... .... .. i .. .. .. ......... . ...... ....... i i .. . ......... .. . . . ......... ??'?. ? ........................... r ..... ., , ......... ......................, . ..................................... , ., . .. ..... .. ... .. ....... \ ,! .... -" i ..................... , ' ~ ~ ~~~~....... ..... .............. . ... . .'4. ... .......

Orear, authors of a recent book on ceramicist John Foster (1900-1980), donated a box of Foster's papers, which includes letters, catalogues, photographs, and business records. Foster, a ceramic en- gineer at Ford Motor Company, advised Mary Chase Stratton at Pewabic Pottery and taught at the Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts and Wayne State University. "Since I am not able to make a living in the fine arts I trust that you will carefully consider my application for the scholarship," wrote Edgar Yaegar (b. 1904) in his 1930 application for a Guggenheim Fellowship. Over the next half-century Yaegar became one of Detroit's most highly regarded artists, working in a range of media, 37</page><page sequence="4">including painting, ceramics, and graphics. A small col- lection of personal papers was donated by Yaegar in this quarter. Materials on his years on the WPA predominate and include photographs of Detroit-area artists working in their studios, preliminary sketches for mural cycles, and a delightful set of studies for the library of the Ford Elementary School in Highland Park, Michigan. Educational outreach continued to be the primary fo- cus of the Midwest Regional Center in this quarter. Up- date, a newsletter for researchers, continues to publish information about Archives' publications, new collec- tions, changes in our services (particularly the Interlibrary Loan program), and funding possibilities. A slide lecture has also been developed to introduce potential research- ers - students, librarians, scholars - to our programs.

MARINA PACINI Printmaker Richard Hood (b. 1912) was accepted onto the print project of the Pennsylvania Works Progress Ad- ministration in 1935 and then went on to serve as District Supervisor (1936-1938), Federal Field Supervisor (1938- 1939), and State Director (1939-1942). Hood's papers, donated this quarter, include two linear feet of material documenting his work on the WPA and on collateral projects. The WPA materials include minutes and correspon- dence about project exhibitions, appointments to the rolls, and day-to-day operations. There are also field reports from various community art centers and the Pennsylvania Game Commission; and official reports (from the Mu- seum Extension Project, for example) that include pho- tographs of activities. Publicity materials include printed matter and typescripts of radio interviews; among the many photographs are shots of painting, sculpture, and museum extension exhibitions, the graphic workshop, and art works. Hood was frequently interviewed on the radio, and the transcripts provide fascinating information on how the WPA was promoted. In one, for instance, Hood noted the development of the carborundum print in the Phila- delphia graphic workshop, in order to stress the contri- butions made by the projects. Other interviews covered the general operation of the programs, contributions to the defense effort, and many stories about work on the projects. Art week, "a nationwide art fair of 'American Art for EVERY American home,' " was developed to exploit the greater visibility of American art and artists brought about by the WPA, and to increase sales. Hood discussed the fair in an interview in 1941: A Pennsylvania Federal Art Project exhibition of sculpture, May 1939. Richard Hood Papers. CATING.

":' . . ........</page><page sequence="5">I would like to express the appreciation of all of us to Mr. Richard Dooner, the originator of the Art Week idea. ... This idea was so good that it has spread all over the United States as a yearly custom. Last year for the first time it was proclaimed by President Roosevelt, and a uniform date set, so that Art Week would be celebrated at the same time in all of the interested American cities and towns. This was of great encouragement to American artists, because like the earlier establishment of ... the National WPA program, it made artists realize that their President and their govern- ment were aware of the need [for] an American art and an American culture. [Interviewer]: What is the objective that Art Week tries to accomplish, Mr. Hood? How does it benefit the artist? [Hood]: Well, strictly speaking, Art Week is simply a week set aside for the exhibition and the selling of work by Ameri- can artists. . .. [li]t benefits the artist, because through Art Week he very often sells some of his work, and it benefits the public because it makes it possible to buy original works of art by local artists at very reasonable prices. . .. [I]f we are to have an American Art, we must have artists, and to have artists we must buy their work. /Interviewer]: How do you know that the people ... are going to like these paintings? After all, what would the av- erage Philadelphia woman think if her husband came home from the office some day next week with a surrealist paint- ing under his arm? Don't you think that might cause a family row? [Hood]: Well, perhaps it might in some cases. But in recent years the American public has become much more apprecia- tive of all kinds of Art, modern as well as more conservative types of painting. However, the Art Week Committee has taken care of that, because there are all kinds of paintings to be exhibited. Despite enormous efforts, the results were disappoint- ing: only $2448.50 worth of art was sold in the whole state of Pennsylvania in 1940, and most of the sales were from one city - Pittsburgh. Hood's papers also contain records of the American Color Print Society, of which Hood was president from 1965 until about 1983, and materials from his years on the faculty of the Philadelphia College of Art (1951- 1982). Sidney Goodman (b. 1936) was a student of Richard Hood's at the PCA. In a seven-hour interview, Goodman speaks about his studies, his affiliation with the dealer Terry Dintenfass, and his work and career. In discussing the importance of photography for his painting, he stated: When I started using photographs, that's about the time when the work got a little more ordered--I can't think of the right word--classical, more refined, more realistic. I started working on the photographs about 1963. Up until then, I was using a model, working from memory, making things up. And I didn't know it at the time, but I was moving towards something more objective, something more verifiable in terms of reality -the way things really looked. But I hadn't found the means to do it and the polaroids helped me. . .;7 .... ............ ......, ! . ............. . .......................... ..... ... ... .  " ... .......... . .... . ... r. ................. .. ..... ......... .

KARLSTROM Among the most noteworthy local collections acquired during the final quarter of 1990 were the papers of Rob- ert Alexander (1923-1987), who in 1968 established the Temple of Man (founded in San Francisco in 1960) in Venice, California. The papers preserve the records of this spiritual organization, headed by Alexander until his death in 1987, whose members included many promi- nent local artists and poets, among them Bruce Conner and Michael McClure. What distinguishes the collection is the extraordinary amount of ephemera, mostly cor- respondence art, that was gathered and preserved by Alexander as part of the Temple of Man archive. Included, for example, are forty collages, photographs, and other greetings sent by Wallace and Shirley Berman to Ben and Shirley Talbert and others from 1959 to 1965. Similar materials from other artists were also preserved by Alex- ander. Reflecting the mysticism and sexual liberty of the 1960s, the imagery encountered in these letters and cards tends towards the erotic, irrational, surreal, and anti- authoritarian. In fact the collection offers a survey of the kind of intimate visual correspondence favored by many of the leading Beat (and Funk) period artists in Southern California and the Bay Area from the late 1950s on. Underlying many of these works was the basic philos- ophy of the Temple of Man, so characteristic of the 1960s, which held that creativity and enlightenment are best served by minds and bodies liberated from the inhibitions and constraints imposed by American society. The Alex- ander papers, one of the most significant and compre- hensive collections of its kind, will illuminate one of the more intriguing, and least accessible, periods of creative life in California. Phil Paradise (b. 1905), whose papers the Archives acquired this quarter, was a leading member of the so- called California School, a group of watercolorists prom- inent in the 1930s and 1940s whose work resembled in style and subject American Scene painting elsewhere in the country. California-born, Paradise studied with F. Tolles Chamberlain and Millard Sheets at the Chouinard Art Institute, where he later taught. By the late 1930s he was exhibiting regularly in both New York and Los Angeles. The papers date mostly from about 1960 (the earlier 39</page><page sequence="6">records were lost in a storage-area flood), but an inter- view and other writings provide autobiographical infor- mation on the pre-1950s period, documenting, for ex- ample, Paradise's association with Rico Lebrun (whom he brought to Los Angeles to teach at Chouinard), Rex Brandt, Diego Rivera, George Bellows, Paul Sample, and Enjar Hansen; as well as his experiences as a movie set designer and camouflage expert. Peter Hurd (1904-1984) is among a handful of realist artists most clearly associated with New Mexico and the Southwest region. A student of N.C. Wyeth at Chadds Ford, Hurd married Wyeth's daughter Henriette, a well- known painter in her own right. The Hurds eventually settled on a ranch at San Patricio in the Rio Hondo Valley, and their home became the place for cultivated, intel- lectual, and creative people to gather. Among their closest friends was the novelist and historian Paul Horgan, and this first donation of Hurd-Wyeth papers consists pri- marily of correspondence between him and Peter and Henriette, who each sent him letters describing events both in New Mexico and Chadds Ford from the 1920s to the 1970s. Consisting of approximately one hundred seventy letters, many of them five to ten pages long, the correspondence paints a vivid portrait of a distinguished family of American artists. The Southern California Research center continues an active program of acquisition and processing. Joanne Rat- ner, first coordinator of the specially funded project, "The Visual Arts in Southern California, 1900-1950," has com- pleted a survey of archival holdings in the region and compiled a directory-now being prepared for publica- tion- which has served as the basis for current collecting activity. Among the Southern California collections being pursued by current project coordinator Sharon Emanuelli are additions to the papers of Phil Paradise, Phil Dike, Conrad Buff, Douglass Parshall, Laura Andreson, Thad- deus and Ludmilla Welch, and Elise (Armitage Welton), and to the records of the Los Angeles Art Association. ? .j. : ................: .............. . .. . .. . ... - ?

KARLSTROM Painter, printmaker, and author Clinton Adams (b. 1918) had art-world connections on the West Coast and in New Mexico. His research files, donated this quarter, deal with Howard Cook, Theodore Cuno, and Lawrence Barrett, three of the many artists about whom Adams has written. Future installments will include records of Adams's career and correspondence with Lorser Feitelson, Helen Lun- deberg, and other prominent Los Angeles-area artists. The papers of Frederick Stuart Church (1842-1924) consist of five etchings, twenty-one photogravures, and seventy-five illustrated letters. The letters, most of which are richly illustrated, are addressed to the donor's moth- er's aunt, Emma Louise Klots, one of Church's most im- portant patrons. Writing from his Carnegie Hall Building apartment or Pennsylvania's Buckwood Inn, Church de- picted cupids, anthropomorphic dancing bears, and blue- birds to illustrate themes and to portray himself and Klots. Gurdon Woods (b. 1915) was director of the San Francisco Art Institute (formerly California School of Fine Arts) from 1955 to 1965. During his tenure, the school expanded its curriculum, increased the professional level of its faculty, and introduced a graduate program chaired by Elmer Bischoff. Even more importantly, these years marked perhaps the most fertile decade in SFAI's history. Among notable faculty and students were Joan Brown, Robert Hudson, William Wiley, Nathan Oliveira, Richard Diebenkom, Manual Neri, Richard Shaw, and William Allan. Woods's papers are distinguished by student draw- ings, most notably by Hudson and Brown, and handmade greeting cards by many artists. Other papers document Woods's career as a sculptor. After leaving SFAI, Woods taught at the University of California, Santa Cruz, until 1973, when he became director of Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. After more than a year's survey of Asian American artists in the Pacific Northwest, a focused and selective collecting effort began in the summer of 1990. Coordi- nated by Seattle art historian Barbara Johns and funded by the Luce Foundation, in the last quarter of 1990 the project secured the papers of Roger Shimomura (b. Postcard with drawing, 1902.

Born in the Philippines, Laigo came to the United States in 1931, and after study in Mexico City and at the Uni- versity of Washington, where he received his M.F.A. in 1964, he has taught art at Seattle University. Laigo has advocated the teaching of non-Western art and has been active on regional arts commissions and multicultural projects. The Laigo papers primarily document his profes- sional activities in the Seattle area. Roger Shimomura, a Sansei Japanese American born in Seattle, was interned with his family at Minidoka, Idaho, during the Second World War. Since receiving his M.F.A. at Syracuse University in 1968, he has taught art at the University of Kansas, Lawrence. Shimomura's paintings, many of them in the Ukiyo-e style, are distin- guished by imagery based on Japanese American inter- cultural experience, a theme which has carried over into his more recent performance art. Additionally, many of the papers relate to Asian American issues, notably cor- respondence with playwright Frank Chin and poet Law- son Inada, leaders of the redress movement in which the Shimomura family was also active. Kamekichi Tokita was born and educated in Japan and came to the United States in 1919. In the 1930s he was part of the small group of advanced artists working in Seattle, among them Morris Graves and Kenneth Cal- lahan. The Tokita family, like Shimomura's, was interned at Minidoka, Idaho. In addition to art-related and WPA records and correspondence, the papers include a per- sonal notebook and the artist's diaries (in Japanese) from the World War II years. These are exactly the kind of materials we hoped to discover when the Asian American project was initiated as a means to explore the interaction of cultures in American art. Both the Tokita and Shim- omura papers will be processed in Southern California. The project has also produced interviews with painter Frank Okada, and photographer Johsel Namkung. Okada was interviewed by Barbara Johns and Namkung by poet-painter Alan Lau. Lau and his wife Kazuko Na- kane were coordinators of the first phase of the Northwest Asian American Art Project.</page></plain_text>
