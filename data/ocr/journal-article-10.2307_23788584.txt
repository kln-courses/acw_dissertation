Despite the best efforts of the periods, they were all filled at roughly the same excavation team, this "pit" could not be entirely time. Overall the pots found in this locus tended cleared during the 2006 campaign, and further to be in a good state of preservation, only the sur work was undertaken during the Spring and face paint on those vessels found in the lowest lev Autumn campaigns of 2008.3 By 2008, however, it els of the complex had been removed by the ris was clear that the original pit, subsequently ing ground water. termed L81/1 was cut into a depression which is As to the purpose and meaning of this pit a either natural or a larger pit complex which number of theories can be advanced, although (principally) bears the numbers L81/3-6-12-15. since the material is not yet fully studied all such The entire pit complex was subsequently filled must be seen as preliminary in nature.

Aston and Bettina Bader with a contribution by Karl G. Kunst A. The Pottery Corpus7 Nile clays, Marl clays, oasis vessels, and imports, r ^ ^ . , . „ ^ c „ the first being divided into previously known trom the outset it was clear that most or the pot- ö r / r ,, , „ ,, T- „ i is ur types and those new to the Tell el-Dabca ceramic tery torms were well known to the Iell el-Dabca repertoire and could be firmly positioned within repertoire, the Hyksos Period. By applying the established Tell el-Dabca vessel index to the large number of restorable round-bottomed cups (U-Näpfe) it became obvious that the entire ceramic material can be dated to the period E/l-D/3, (cf. Tables 1-2). Although the Napf index cannot differenti ate between E/l and D/3, a dating into phase E/l, (or at latest the changeover from E/l to D/3) might be preferred since a number of the vessel forms have antecedents in Phases E/3 and E/2 whilst the minimal amount of Marl F perhaps speaks against a full D/3 date. Similarly the dip per jugs, albeit few in number, are more likely to be E/l than D/3 since they tend to be slim with sloping shoulders rather than the more squared examples of D/3 whilst the Cypriote imports are primarily different varieties of White Painted wares, for which see further below. A dating into this period is also confirmed by the relative amounts of the different fabrics distributed among the so-far restored vessels. The silt clays comprise mostly Nile B2, - in both a fine variant (true B2) and a coarser sandy variant which bor ders on a Nile E, hence the term b2/e is coined for these vessels, - with Nile C being somewhat rare, whilst the marl clays consist almost entirely of Marl C, mostly Marl C2, and, amongst the so far studied material only six vessels - 0.033% of restored vessels - are made of Marl F. This is again typical of an early Hyksos context. No previously known vessel type is earlier than Phase E/l-D/3 and no previously known vessel type is later. In addition to these well-known types, however, a number of types, never seen in forty years of exca vations at Tell el-Dabca can, naturally not be dated except by reference to the earlier excavated repertoire. However, since all the known types found in this homogeneous pitfill complex date to the period E/l-D/3, it is thus highly probable that these new types are of the same date. As such this pit is likely to provide us with the definitive corpus for Hyksos Period pottery.

We are grateful to Susan Allen for show ing us these vessels in Dahshur, and for permission to mention them here. In addition Robert Schiestl informs us that similar vessels have also been found in earlier excavations at Dahshur, but most remain unpublished. 24 Engelbach, 1923, pi. xl. 70M2 25 Engelbach, 1923, pi. xxxviii. 26 TO XVI, 348-349.</page><page sequence="14">32 David A.

This thus revises the statement in TD XIII, 83, where in view of the absence of fragments found at Tell el Maskhuta, it was suggested that fish dishes were no longer used in the Delta after the mid Thirteenth Dynasty, ie the beginning of the Hyksos Period. Not all vessels were counted since some were clearly from the surface, and could thus not be dated, or are stored in SCA magazines and could not be accessed to check whether they were made of Marl CI or Marl C2.</page><page sequence="42">60 David A.
