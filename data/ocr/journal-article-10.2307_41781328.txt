Pauketat 20 ARCHAEOLOGY • September/October 2009</page><page sequence="2">In 1832, artist George Catlin painted Mandan Indians hurling staffs or spears at a rolling stone while playing i a game known as chunkey. These ancient chunkey 1 stones are from Missouri, where the sport originated. I moment 1,000 years ago, when social life, political organization, I religion, art, and culture were all utterly transformed in the middle I of the Mississippi River Valley At the epicenter of events was a radical new kind of social and political experiment: a planned capi- tal city Someone - or some governing body - designed one from f scratch at Cahokia. The leaders superimposed a new plan directly over an old village and supervised the construction of great earthen r pyramids, open plazas, and huge wooden buildings. Then they gained control over people living throughout the region, an unprecedented move in the history or ancient America north or Mexico. A new culture developed at the city, perhaps inspired by Mesoamerican models. The people of Cahokia practiced human sacrifice, incorporated obelisk-like timber posts into their worship, told stories of superhuman men and women, used Mesoamerican- style flint daggers, and understood the cosmos in ways similar to Mesoamerican notions. They then spread this new way of life, which included intensified maize agriculture, across the Midwest and into the South and Plains with a religious fervor. Archaeologists refer to the culture as Mississippian, after the river that flows by many of its known sites. One of the primary vehicles for the growth of this new civilization may have been Cahokian envoys who carried chunkey stones in one hand and war clubs in the other as they ventured into the hinterlands with the purpose of making peace or political alliances. These emissaries seem to have established and enforced a region-wide peace of sorts, a veritable Pax Cahokiana, an important element of which may have been the game of chunkey.

In many cases, the ritual preparation of the playing ground, or chunk yard, involved sprinkling fine sand over it before the game. Then one of the players hurled the stone into the field as two play- ers or two teams simultaneously began running after it, A few paces into the yard, the players would hurl their playing sticks toward where they thought the rolling stone would come to rest. Points were scored depending on how close the sticks landed to the stone after it stopped rolling. Imagine the modern game of horseshoes, but with both the thrower and the ringer posts in motion, and you have an idea of the difficulty involved. In the South, the prominence and politics of chunkey were apparent in the formal playing grounds of Native American towns, described by European and Anglo- Amer- ican explorers and naturalists who had seen the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Muskogee peoples still playing the game. Among these explorers was an Irish nobleman and historian named James Adair, who traveled through the southern colonies in the 1770s, Adair, who translated chunkey as "running hard labor" owing to the full-body workout involved in playing the game, noted that play took place "near their state house" on"a square piece of ground well cleaned" - the town plaza. The 18th- century American naturalist William Bartram also noted the proximity of the chunk yards to the public and political centers of society, Bartram said that some of these yards or plazas were 600 to 900 feet in length. In the middle stood a high obelisk, or massive wooden post, erected in a low earthen mound and rising 30 to 40 feet. It was topped with the towns insignia or other markers of community identity. Nearby were other posts, some used to exhibit enemy scalps, skulls, and recently captured enemies condemned to death. Not only was chunkey an important event, as attested by its prominent venue on town grounds, but there were other possible associations, direct or indirect, with warfare and enemy executions. In historic times chunkey was also a gambling game par excellence. It seems to have been addictive for both players and spectators, Adair wrote that Choctaw men wagered "their silver ornaments, their nose, finger and ear rings; their breast, arm, and wrist plates, and even all their wearing apparel, except that which barely covers their middle," The painter George Catlin, who visited many Plains tribes in the 1830s, From a.D. 1050-1300, Cahokia was the largest center north of Mesoamerica. Visitors would have marveled at its great pyramids, spacious plazas, and thatched-roof temples, as well as a central "chunk yard" where players from Cahokia and other towns would face off.</page><page sequence="4">This pre-Cahokian sandstone chunkey roller measures 2.5 I' inches 12th-century was single made in source diameter. of stone quartzite on the of Below, Mississippl. 3.5 found a 12th-century stone of 3.5 inches was made of quartzite found at a single source on the Mississippl. people become excessively fascinated [with chunkey] ♦♦♦ often gambling away everything they possess, and even sometimes, when everything else was gone, [they] have i been knQwn to stake their liberty upon the issue of these I games, offering themselves as slaves to their opponents in 1 case they get beaten," According to one southeastern tale, players bet their spouses on the roll of the stone» Chunkey meant a lot to its participants, who would have learned the game as children* Archaeologists have found both child-sized chunkey disks, made of stone or baked clay, and tne more finely made, adult- jh sized stones* The lat- m ter were presumably H the prized heirlooms H of whole families, WĚ clans, or even entire M towns, as described 1 by the Anglo explorers* "The hurling stones they use at present, /'aair wrote, were from "time immemorial rubbed smooth on the rocks, and with prodigious labor; they are kept with the strictest religious care, from one generation to another, and are exempted from being buried with the dead* They belong to the town where they are used, and are carefully preserved*" Some archaeologists suspect that the politicians of the biggest southern towns infused the play with political or religious associations that served tribal interests* At a mini- mum, this might have included a sense of team loyalty and community identity* Players from different towns would have faced off, and the cheering and wagering would split along community unes* j usu as in moaern sports leagues, there would have been challengers and a home team, perhaps mortal enemies who came together to settle a dis- A pute or prove a point* individuals or entire communities would J have developed reputations for winning or losing, placing their very identities at stake* Those identities, in turn, were tethered to deeper cul- tural meanings, memories, aesthetic sensibilities, and religious beliefs, many of which probably came from Cahokia* The games sticks « Found 90 miles south of Cahokia, this ornamental shell collar depicts a chunkey player in elaborate J regalia.

Often weighing less than an ear of corn, such a stone could have been rolled quite a long way, making it difficult for the stick throwers to hit their mark and score points* In addition to their finely crafted and distinctive shape, many Cahokia-style stones were made from white or honey- colored, sometimes red-banded, siliceous sandstone or quartzite - essentially, the same light-colored sandy sub- stance that many native townsfolk in the South sprinkled on their plazas before playing chunkey* An intriguing pattern emerges when Perinos stylistic observations are cross-referenced with the archaeological finds of chunkey stones around eastern North America* The finely made chunkey stones first appear at Cahokia in 1050 and replace the older, thicker, community-owned varieties in the region; some finds hint that not everybody had access to them afterward* Perhaps the best evidence for central control over the stones is a pile of 15 chunkey stones associated with the elaborate burial of an important person, perhaps a chief, in Cahokias Mound 72, dated to between 1050 and 1100* But the bigger geographic pattern is revealing: archaeolo- gists have found no chunkey stones outside greater Cahokia dating before 1050* Not in Montana, Wisconsin, Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, or Louisiana, all places where the game was played at later dates, and where the artists and explorers of the colonial and early American periods saw it played in earnest by people wagering all they owned on this pastime* Cahokia-style stones do show up at certain large sites outside Illinois and Missouri, particularly in the trans- Mississippi River area - but only after 1050* Outside the old pre-Mississippian villages in western Illinois and eastern Missouri, people were not playing chunkey - at least not with stone gaming pieces - before the rise of Cahokia* At the first southern towns where chunkey stones appear after 1050, the Cahokia-style disks have been found together with chunkey stones made in local styles* North of the core Mississippian world no local varieties of chunkey stones have been found* But in Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota, archaeologists have discovered Cahokia-style stones from sites that date to after 1050 and, for the most part, before 1200* These may have been secreted away, kept from "time immemorial," as Adair noted* One such stone was found in far-off South Carolina* Another was buried with the honored dead at the site of Spiro in Oklahoma around 1400* All this suggests to archaeologists a clear con- nection between the spread of chunkey, as documented by the distribution of stone rollers in the historical era, and the rise of Cahokia* One important piece of evidence in support of this idea comes from a recent discovery by archaeologist Thomas Emerson, leader of the University of Illinoiss Transportation Archaeological Research Program* Emerson's work focused on a series of famous smoking pipes found at sites related to Spiro, which were carved in the shape of anthropomorphic gods and heroic superhuman characters that included, in one case, a chunkey player* Found at a site near Ocmulgee, Oklahoma, around 1900, the carved chunkey-player pipe is nearly nine inches tall and was made from a block of soft red stone probably around the year 1100* The bowl of the pipe is drilled out of the figures upper back, and a stem hole connects to it inside the body and exits out the figures lower back* The pipe stem itself, long since deteriorated, would have allowed the user to inhale the smoke of burning tobacco* The artist who carved this piece realistically depicted a man on his knees in the act of playing chunkey* The hair on his head is tied up in a bun, and he wears circular ear spools* His neck is adorned with a modest shell-bead choker* In his left hand he holds two short chunkey sticks* In his right hand is a chunkey stone, pulled back as if about to be launched forward along the ground* Most tellingly, the roller in his hand is a Cahokia-style disk* ARCHAEOLOGY • September/October 2009</page><page sequence="6">In 1836, George Catlin painted Eastern Sioux women playing lacrosse in what is today southeastern Wisconsin. The work captures the frenzy and violence of the game that supplanted chunkey after the collapse of the Mississippian world. Up until 2002, Perino and others who worked with Spiroan artifacts thought that this object, like many similar ones, was made in Oklahoma or Arkansas from bauxite mined in Arkansas, That conclusion suggested someone other than a Cahokian made the pipe showing a supposed Cahokia- style chunkey stone. But Emerson, working with a geologist and an archaeometric specialist, found that the red stone sculpture was made not from Arkansas bauxite, but from a raw material called flintclay, which could only have been oDtainea rrom a single source, an outcrop zu mues west of Cahokia.
