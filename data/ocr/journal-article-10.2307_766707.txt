<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Fifth-Century Book Cover and the Origin of the Four Evangelist Symbols Page in the Book of Durrow* LAWRENCE NEES University of Delaware after the appearance of Werner's article has unearthed a work which provides a better and more convincing prototype for the Book of Durrow Four Evangelist Symbols page than Werner's hypothetical reconstructed Coptic source. However, before turning to the analysis of that work, Werner's theory will be reviewed on its own terms, since it accords with and lends support to other assertions of the importance of Coptic art for the development of Insular and early medieval art in general.2 Werner's case for a connection of the Durrow miniature with Coptic art rests heavily on his assertion that the "Hiberno- Saxon artist was attempting to imbue his animal symbols with anthropomorphic qualities," as most noticeably con- veyed by the "upright" positions of the lion and ox.3 Even leaving aside the question of whether or not an"upright" posture may be taken as an indication of an anthropomor- phizing intent in the depiction of an animal, it is far from self-evident that the Durrow animals are "upright" at all. Werner does suggest that the lion "is apparently standing on its hind legs," but offers no specific observation to support this statement, which is, in fact, utterly contradicted by the image as it appears to my eyes and as described by Meyer in the facsimile publication of the Book of Durrow.4 If the lion were standing on its hind legs, one would expect to see the two hind legs below and at least some indication of the fore- paws around the area of tlie shoulders. Instead one sees a frontal head and a bilaterally symmetrical torso covered with a chevron pattern, ending at the bottom in two paws with strongly marked claws. The simplest and most natural inter- pretation of this pose is that the lion is standing on all fours and is seen directly from the front, with the hindquarters hidden from view. One of the most famous medieval lions, the neither upright nor anthropomorphic beast explicitly drawn "al vif" by Villard de Honnecourt, is displayed in precisely this position.5 Thus the very basis of Werner's argument, that the Dur- row Evangelist symbols exhibit clearly anthropomorphic qualities, is not persuasive as presented. Also unconvincing are his assertion of the particularly "oriental" character of such motifs as animal ornament or pearled borders, which FIGURE 1. Four Evangelist Symbols Page in the Book of Durrow, DublinX Trinity College Library Ms. 572 fol. 2r In 1969 Martin Werner published in this journal his provocative proposal, supported by a wide-ranging discussion of a variety of works from East and West alike, that the Four Evangelist Symbols page in the Book of Durrow (Fig. 1) was derived from a "venerable symbolic Maiestas Domini com- position with zooanthropomorphic Evangelist symbols," a "rare and unusual composition created in Egypt and perhaps employed as an introductory miniature in an early Coptic manuscript.''l An important archaeological discovery made 3 GESTA XVII/1 (o) The International Center of Medieval Art 1978</page><page sequence="2">^&gt; f * ^ } + FIGURE 2.

Bootcover with cross and symbols oJ Evangelists; detatl oJ FIG. 2 in fact occur widely throughout the Mediterranean by the sixth century,6 and his central but dubious argument that a composition similar to the Four Evangelist Symbols page of the Book of Durrow was likely to have been created in Coptic Egypt by the sixth or seventh century. The earliest Coptic image Werner can cite, the tenth-century miniature from Morgan Library cod. 600,7 does resemble the Durrow miniature in certain respects. Yet as is invariably true for all of his Coptic parallels, this miniature groups around a cross not Evangelist symbols, zooanthropormorphic or otherwise, but the Evangelists themselves. The eleventh-century Nubian fresco from Faras to which Werner attached much impor- tance8 does indeed present the four "living creatures" around a cross in a composition which, but for the presence of the medallion with Christ at the center, forms a striking parallel to the Durrow miniature. However, Werner's implication that these figures may be interpreted as the symbols of the Evangelists and thereby associated with his earlier Coptic material and with Western compositions such as the Book of Durrow miniature is demonstrably erroneous. In the fresco from Faras the four Beasts are clearly inscribed with their names, which are not Matthew, Mark, Luke and John but rather Meliton, Agrammatap, Paramyra and Peourouthion, strange angelic names from the magic lore of charms and incantations.9 On several grounds Werner's theory of a Coptic source for the Four Evangelist Symbols miniature of the Book of Durrow must therefore be rejected. Yet the contrary case for a purely western and most probably Italian origin of the image could be argued only with some difficulty and on the basis only of individual features such as the type of symbols employed, since it has heretofore been impossible to cite any early Western work in which the Evangelist symbols were arranged in the quadrants around a cross.1 ° Such an argument could not be wholly satisfactory, since Werner is surely correct in his basic premise that the Durrow miniature was not con- structed by the Insular artist from wholly disparate elements, but that some prototype must have existed for the funda- mental conception of the image. Hence the importance of the recent excavation in Naples of a fifth-century mosaic (Fig. 2) which not only provides precisely the sort of early Italian prototype hitherto lacking, but also seems to offer new insight into the significance of the image and the reason for its appear- ance in so prominent a position at the very opening of the volume.l 1 Excavations were undertaken beginning in June 1971 in the catacombs adjacent to the church of S. Gennaro, in the area thought to be the apse of a large underground basilica found in 1888.12 These excavations revealed a large crypt area, 5.5m long, 2.5m wide and 6.0m high, raised four steps above the floor level of the "basilica," and containing eight arcosolia and ten loculi 13 Each arcosolium contained a bust portrait, usually in a clipeus, four executed in mosaic and four in fresco; the former are relatively well-preserved14 whereas the latter have been almost totally destroyed. On the basis of a thorough analysis of the topography of this area of the catacomb, the excavator, Umberto Fasola, concluded that this crypt must be dated after the first decades of the fifth century and before the early sixth, and he further suggested that the different arcosolia were decorated in different cam- paigns during this span of nearly a century.1 5 The arcosolium of primary interest here was uncovered 4</page><page sequence="3">on 27 September 1971, and is located on the north wall of the crypt immediately adjacent to the central mosaic in the "apse,7' which Fasola very plausibly claimed for the oldest of the works.1 6 The north wall arcosolium (Fig. 2) presents under a narrow arch with green and yellow rinceaux against a blue ground, a mosaic clipeus portrait of a dark skinned ec- clesiastic garbed in a white tunica with dark clavi, holding a large book before him with both hands.t7 The book is of compelling interest here, for its cover is decorated with a large jeweled golden Latin cross, with the four golden beasts in the surrounding quadrants (Fig. 3). At the upper left is the man, at the upper right the eagle, at the lower left the lion and at the lower right the ox. Unfortunately the utilization of standard large tesserae in so small a detail of the mosaic (the entire clipeus measures only 80cm in diameter) made the pre- cise rendering of details extremely difE1cult, but the following observations seem to provide an accurate description of these beasts. None of the creatures have haloes, nor are any carry- ing books, while all four are provided with wings. Each wing appears to be tripartite, as is most evident in the eagle and oXl 8; that is, each creature has six wings. As in nearly all such images the eagle is presented at full length, whereas the other three are apparently seen as half-length f1gures. The ox very clearly has horns, but other details of the filgures cannot be discerned with confidence. This fifth-century Neapolitan mosaic presents an image almost entirely analogous to the Four Evangelist Symbols page of the Book of Durrow. Both show the four beastsl 9 arranged in a rectangular field around a large Latin cross, and the correspondence extends even so far as to the order in which the beasts are portrayed LION oGx * Moreover, the evidence offered by the mosaic from the S Gennaro cata- comb in Naples indicates not only that an arrangement of the four Evangelist symbols around the cross was already known in Italy from as early as the fWlfth century, but also that it was used to decorate the eminently portable cover of a book. Indeed book covers were commonly adorned with the cross, as is abundantly clear from many examples in all media,2 ° and the grouping of the four Evangelist symbols in the surrounding quadrants is not surprising given their deeply- rooted association with cosmographic notions of the four directions.2 l Such an arrangement occurs in the fifth-century vault of the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna;2 2 the five-part ivory book covers in Milan (Fig. 4) present a clearly related arrangement the clarity of which is, however, diluted by its distribution over two panels.23 The similarity of this composition to that of the Naples mosaic supports the connection of the Book of Durrow miniature with an early Italian book cover, but it remains still to address the question of the relationship between a book cover and a miniature just inside the cover. Both likely share to some degree the utili- tarian purpose of conveying an impression of the contents of the volume, yet considerable evidence indicates that in the late antique and early medieval period the images both out- FIGURE 4.

In a recent article Kitzinger has argued that images outside and inside books might be closely related in the period under discussion, and raised the issue of a possible apotropaic func- tion.2 4 The imagery of the Four Evangelist Symbols miniature in the Book of Durrow readily lends itself to this interpreta- tion. Such important and closely related works as the carved coffin of St. Cuthbert from Lindisfarne suggest that some apotropaic role could be exercised by images of the Evangelists and/or their symbols, the major figures of the Durrow minia- ture,25 and that a magical potency was credited to the Evan- gelists in Great Britain at least as early as the tenth century is quite evident from several sources. Most extraordinary of these, in which the power of the Evangelists is dramatically linked with that of the cross, is an elaborate ritual prescription for the fertilization of bewitched fields from a tenth-century medicinal book, in which four crosses, each inscribed with the names of the Evangelists at the ends of the four arms, were to be buried in the corners of the barren field amid prayers, libations and other ceremonies.26 The apotropaic power of the cross still alive today in magic and (if only semi-con- sciously) in popular religious practice, is repeatedly attested throughout the Christian world from the earliest period.27 5</page><page sequence="4">Within the realm of book illumination Leroy has underlined the existence of miniatures of the cross most likely serving a talismanic function at the beginning and end of Syriac manu- scripts dating from as early as the middle of the sixth cen- tury.28 Even the interlace decoration of the cross in the Book of Durrow miniature may have served such a purpose,2 9 and the combination of Evangelist symbols, cross and inter- lace in a single image adds up to a source of considerable apotropaic potency. Indeed a direct testimony to the pos- sibility of an apotropaic interpretation of such a miniature is provided by a late-eighth or early ninth century miniature now preserved at Heidelberg, probably north Italian in origin according to Bischoff. This miniature presents an interlaced cross page, strikingly recalling the Durrow page, in which the quadrants around the cross contain not the symbols of the Evangelists but an inscription whose apotropaic intent is be- yond question (Fig. 5).3 ° Finally, the placement of the potent image at the "entrance" to the book) whether on the cover, as in the mosaic from Naples, or just inside as in the Book of Durrow, immediately associates it with other prophylactic images located at the threshold of a dwelling or holy place.3 1 In conclusion, the fortunate preservation and recent excavation of the fifth-century mosaic from the S. Gennaro catacomb in Naples permits us to state with confidence that the origin of the image of the cross surrounded by the four beasts, as it appears in the frontispiece miniature of the Book of Durrow, should be seen not in Coptic Egypt but in Italy. Moreover, the depiction of an image of the four beasts around a cross in such a context sheds revealing light on the probable function of this image in the Insular world as an apotropaic sign as well as a pictorial assertion of the harmony of the four Gospels.32 That an Insular book should have been regarded as the source of such power fully accords with our knowledge of the Insular fascination with the Word. We know that one of the earliest surviving Insular manuscripts, known as the "Cathach" of St. Columba, was "in ancient days. . . carried into battle as a charm or mascot."3 3 Indeed, it seems that the attribution of a similar magic potency to the Book of Durrow itself became traditional, as one of the filrst notices of the Book relates that the farmer responsible for its keeping in the seventeenth century was seen to immerse the codex in water so as to produce a curative potion for his sick cattle.34 NOTES *The substance of this article was presented at the informal session on Insular Art at the College Art Association meeting in New York in January 1978. 1.

Salem X. 1 2a. tween Coptic Egypt and the Insular world, although she cautions that such contact must have ceased during the seventh century. The general validity of this oft-repeated theory is not at issue here, but in my opinion it is necessary to underscore the general method- ological point that in examining the parallels between Insular and certain Eastern Mediterranean works of art one must also be ex- tremely scrupulous in noting the existence of the same forms and motifs where they occur in other and less remote areas as well. Thus Nordenfalk has rightly cautioned against the too hasty sup- position of "oriental" models for such features as interlace orna- ment, which also appears commonly in the West from an early period; cf. C. Nordenfalk, Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Painting, New York, 1977, 14. 3. Werner, "Durrow," 4-8. 4. Cf. A.A. Luce, G.O. Simms, P. Meyer and L. Bieler, Evangeliorum Quattuor Codex Durmachensis, Olten/Lausanne/Freiburg i B., 1960, II, 103-104. On the supposed anthropomorphic qualities of the animals it is Meyer's opinion that ". . . only the Vitulus of f. 2r, drawn in frontal view, which is unique also on account of its geometrical style, might possibly be taken for a clothed (human) figure; the other symbols, except the Man, are unmistakably animals." 5.

XLVIII. 6</page><page sequence="5">suggests the middle of the fifth century on the basis of rather general comparisons to other mid-fifth-century mosaics, but on relatively firm archaeological grounds a date somewhere in the fifth century seems certain. Prof. Kitzinger has recently informed me that this dating has been accepted by B. Brenk, Spatantike und fruhes Christentum, Propylaen Kunstgeschichte, Supp. I; Frankfurt, 1977, 130 and pl. 25. 18. As noted by Fasola, Catacombe, 155. This is, of course, a very common characteristic in early Italian mosaics, as for example in the fifth-century Baptistery at Naples itself and in the S. Matrona Chapel from nearby Capua; cf. M. van Berchem and E. Clouzot, Mosaiques chretiennes du IVme au xme siecle, Geneva, 1924, pls. 120-121 and 95-96 respectively. 19. Although they are not so inscribed and do not even carry books, the presumption that these represented symbols of the Evan- gelists seems well founded. First, they stem from a country and a century, fifth-century Italy, in which such an identification of the beasts was clearly already commonplace in literature, boasting no less a champion than St. Jerome's own preface Plures fuisse to his translation of the Gospels, and in which the symbols of the Evangelists figure in a number of works of art Furthermore, they are portrayed here on the cover of a large book which, held by a bishop and decorated by a cross, can only be idehtified as a Gospel book. 20. For ivories cf. the sixth-century works reproduced by Volbach, Elfenbeinarbeiten, nos. 142, 145, 150, 153, and 154. For mosaics, cf. G.

It may also be noteworthy that an initial in a sixth-century north Italian Orosius manuscript, Florence, Biblioteca Medicea-Lauren- ziana, cod. Plut. LXXV, 1, fol. 102r, shows a small wreath con- taining a Latin cross surrounded not by the four symbols of the Evangelists but by four books; cf. C.

Leroy, Les manuscrits syriaques a peintures conserves dans les bibliotheques d'Europe et d'Orient, Institut Francais d'Arch- eologie de Beyrouth, Bibliotheque Archeologique et Historique, LXXVII, Paris, 1964, 113ff. To the examples provided by Leroy may be added a twelfth-century manuscript in the Harvard College Library, MS. Syr. 4, which I have discussed along with a more 6. For decorative animals many examples could be cited from the realm of floor mosaics alone. From north Africa there is the grand mosaic of Asinus Nica at Djemila (M. Blanchard-Lemee, Maisons a Mosaiques du Quartier Central de Djemila [CuiculJ, Aix-en-Pro- vence, n.d. [1974], pl. XVI), and from north Italy the outstanding example is the fourth-century pavement at Aquileia; cf. G.C. Menis, I mosaici cristiani di Aquileia, Udine, n.d. [ 1966], fig 4 and pls. 1-11, 25-26 and 40-48. Werner's implication that the use of such animal motifs is purely Eastern is so far from being self-evident that at least for the employment of such animals as part of an all-over field pattern, a strong case has been made that Western, north African examples such as the just-cited Asinus Nica pavement may actually be prior to any of the similar floors from the East; cf. E. Kitzinger, "Mosaics in the Greek East from Constantine to Jus- tinian," in La Mosaiq ue Greco-Ro main e (Co lloq ues Internationaux du Centre National de la Recherche ScientiElque, Paris, 1963; Paris, 1965), 348 and note 37. Pearled borders already appear in sixth-century ivories from Con- stantinople and from Italy (W.F. Volbach, Elfenbeinarbeiten der Spatantike und des fruhen Mittelalters, 2nd ed.; Mainz, 1952, nos. 15, 28 and 31), and by the seventh century had demonstrably penetrated as far as Germany, as evinced by the reliquary casket from Ennabeuren (J. Hubert, J. Porcher, and W.F. Volbach, Europe of the Invasions, trans. S. Gilbert and J. Emmons; New York, 1969, pl. 297). 7. 8. Werner, "Durrow," 9 and Fig. 14. Ibid., 10 and Fig. 15. 9. Cf. K. Michalowski, Faras. Die Kathedrale aus dem Wustensand, Einsiedeln/Zurich/Cologne, 1967, 161-162 and pls. 87-89. Indeed the basic fact is that almost no evidence from Coptic, Byzantine, or any other eastern Mediterranean art suggest that the apocalyptic Beasts were in that region identified as the Symbols of the Evan- gelists before the eleventh century; cf. K. Wessel, "Evangelisten," Reallexikon zur byzantinischen Kunst II, cols. 469-471, and E. Kitzinger, "The Coffin-Reliquary," in The Relics of St. Cuthbert, ed. C.F. Battiscombe, Oxford/London, 1956, 230. 10. Meyer, EQCD, 105, does cite for comparison an altar-stone in S. Maria del Priorato in Aventino in Rome, from the eighth or ninth century; cf. A. Haseloff, Pre-Romanesque Sclllpture in Italy, New York, n.d. [19301, pl. 59. This work is not cited by Werner, although it is in fact no later in date than the earliest of his Coptic examples. 11. Because the leaves of the Durrow book were all cut in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century the present location could be different from the original, although Powell's study indicated the location on fol. 2r as most likely; cf. R. Powell, "The Original 'Make-up.' The Repair, and the Re-binding of 1954," in EQCD, 80-81 . 12. Cf. U.M. Fasola, Le catacombe di S Gennaro a Capodimonte, Rome, 1975, 133ff. and fig. 87. 13.

Fasola sought to identify this ecclesiastic as the exiled Bishop Quodvultdeus of Carthage, resident in Naples after expulsion from his own see by the Vandal conqueror Genseric, and subsequently venerated in Naples as a saint. Fasola makes a plausible case for this theory and may well be correct, although the identification as an African solely on the basis of his dark skin does not inspire confidence. In any event, in the present connection the precise identification of the per- sonnage is not important, nor is a precise dating essential; Fasola 7</page><page sequence="6">detailed analysis of apotropaic cross miniatures in early medieval manuscripts, in "Two Illuminated Syriac Manuscripts in the Harvard College Library," to appear in Cahiers archeologiques. 29. That is particularly true if one can associate interlace with knots, whose extremely common magical and especially apotropaic sig- nificance (as well as practical and mnemonic function) has been discussed by C.L. Day, Quipus and Witches's Knots, Lawrence, Kansas, 1967, 51ff. This study was cited along with other litera- ture by E. Kitzinger, "The Threshold of the Holy Shrine.

For evidence of both the knowledge of this variety of meaning in the Insular world and of the close association there of knots with interlace one can cite the eleventh-century Anglo-Saxon penitential books which prescribe penances for the sin of making knots and interlace as apotropaic amulets; cf.
