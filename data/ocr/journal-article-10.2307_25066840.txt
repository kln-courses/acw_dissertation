<plain_text><page sequence="1">Xunzi and Early Han Philosophy PAUL R. GOLDIN University of Pennsylvania The cultural prestige of the philosopher Xunzi (third century b.c.) has reached extreme highs and lows over the centuries. In his own day, he was revered as "the most senior of the masters" (zui wei lao shi ?SUii?fl?)1 and numbered among his students some of the most influential men in the Chinese world, including Han Fei (d. 233 b.c.) and Li Si $|ft (d. 208 b.c.). He was still widely celebrated in the West ern Han dynasty, when Dong Zhongshu ?#af (fl. 152-119 B.c.) is reported to have written a paean to him (now lost).2 However, by East ern Han times, although Wang Chong 3E?E (a.d. 27-ca. 100) still took him seriously as a philosopher3 and Ban Gu SEH (a.d. 32-92) quoted him approvingly in his "Treatise on Penal Methods" ?PJi??/E,4 Xunzi 1 The source of this oft-repeated phrase is "Mengzi Xun Qing liezhuan" ]m? l??iP^'Jfl?, Shiji ?E (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1959), 74.2348. 2 Stated in Liu Xiang's S'Jfn] (79-8 b.c.) preface, included in Wang Xianqian 3L9tM (1842 1918), Xunzijijie ^?^MM, ed.

GOLDIN had largely been eclipsed by Mencius (371-289 b.c.?) in the minds of most literati.5 Thus the first three or four centuries after Xunzi's death witnessed a slow but continuous decline in his reputation. Thereafter the pace of this decline quickened. By the Tang dynasty, even admirers like Han Yu (768-824)6 were careful to note that Xunzi's works contained grave mistakes. A few voices, such as those of Sima Guang ?iMJt (1019-1086)7 and Chen Liang Pf JE (1143-1194),8 still praised him in the Song, but the opinion with the greatest long-term consequences was that of Zhu Xi (1130-1200), who declared that Xun zi's philosophy resembled those of non-Confucians such as Shen Buhai ? ^ I? (fl. 354-340 b.c.) and Shang Yang M (d. 338 b.c.), and that he was indirectly responsible for the notorious disasters of the Qjn dynasty.9 Throughout the rest of imperial history,10 Xunzi was rejected by the cul tural mainstream. Into the twentieth century, he was criticized by intel lectuals such as Kang Youwei (1858-1927),11 Tan Sitong (1865-1898),12 5 Cf. Majigao, p. 214.

Xunzi is one of the most popular philosophers throughout East Asia15 and has been the subject of more books published in English over the past two decades than any other Chinese philosopher, vastly outstripping Mencius.16 From a twenty-first-century perspective, this revival of interest in Xunzi is not hard to explain: his body of work has always been one of the best preserved, and with the commonplace scholastic objection to his philos ophy?namely, that he was wrong to say human nature is evil (xing e 14 M)?having lost most of its cogency, it is only to be expected that phil osophical readers should be attracted to his creative but rigorous argu ments. In this sense one could say that Xunzi has finally been restored, more than two millennia after his death, to his erstwhile position as zui wei lao shi. 13 See Hao Chang, Liang Ch'i-ch'ao and Intellectual Transition in China, 1890-1907 (Cambridge: Har vard University Press, 1971), pp. 74?76; Carsun Chang, 2:425; and Joseph R. Levenson, Liang Ch'i-ch'ao and the Mind of Modern China, revised edition (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1959), p. 35. 14 For an idiosyncratic view of this material, see Michael Twohey, Authority and Welfare in China: Modern Debates in Historical Perspective, Studies on the Chinese Economy (New York: St. Martin's, 1999), p. 28, where it is argued that "Xunzi's outlook was central to China's modern reformers." In prosecuting this thesis, Twohey mischaracterizes several of the studies he cites; for example, see p. 164 n. 22, where he says: "The flexibility of Xunzi's political system is discussed in Creel's chapter, 'The role of compromise in Chinese culture.'" In fact Creel criticizes Xunzi for not en couraging his students to think for themselves and thereby straying from the paradigm of com promise that Creel attributes to Confucius. See Herrlee G. Creel, "The Role of Compromise in Chinese Culture," in Chinese Ideas about Mature and Society: Studies in Honour ofDerk Bodde, ed. Charles Le Blanc and Susan Blader (Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 1987), p. 146. 15 Kam Louie shows that the rehabilitation of Xunzi (along ideological lines) was already well underway during the first two decades of the People's Republic. See his Inheriting Tradition: Interpre tations of the Classical Philosophers in Communist China, 1949-1966 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986), pp. 165-78. 16 The following have appeared since 1999 alone: Paul Rakita Goldin, Rituals of the Way: The Philosophy ofXunzi (Chicago: Open Court, 1999); T.

GOLDIN However, it is worth examining the reasons for the vast intervening trough. Though the best-known criticisms of Xunzi belong to the Song dynasty (especially to philosophers, like Zhu Xi, of the fellowship known as daoxue x??), a radical change in literati sentiment is detectable as early as the Six Dynasties. The two tirelessly repeated clich?s about Xunzi were that he propagated the doctrine of "xing e" and that, by serving as Li Si's and Han Fei's teacher, he furthered the cause of Qin Legalism and thus represented the antithesis of true Confucianism. Both these accusations are woven into a Jin ? dynasty rhapsody by Zhongchang Ao i^M^L.11 Since no other work of Zhongchang Ao survives, there is no hope of dating this difficult piece precisely, but it cannot be from later than the fifth century. The extant text18 is here translated in full, since it is illuminating and, to my knowledge, has never been discussed in English: The writings of Master Xun of Zhao say that human nature is evil. His disciples Li Si and Han Fei turned to him and said, "Teacher, your saying that human nature is evil fits the facts, but you have not clarified how talent can be good or bad.19 We would like to hear your explanation." Master Xun said: "There are millions of clans spread between Heaven and Earth. They are alike in their endowment and physical substance; there is no difference among them. Among the three hundred naked animals, human beings are the weak est. Their nails, teeth, skin, and hair are not adequate to defend themselves with. They can only rely on deception and artifice; they take turns preying upon one another. Briefly said, there are few Yaos % but many Jies S!; one sees only a Shang Yang flSlft and never hears of aji H or Xie 8?.20 Among fathers and sons and elder brothers and younger brothers, there are diverging passions and differing schemes. Among lords and ministers and friends, there are separate aspirations and entangling resentments. Neighboring states and communities take it as their duty to swallow each other up. The lowliest slaves and servant boys only steal and pilfer. They obey with their faces and rebel with their backs.21 Their intentions and their mouths oppose each other: 17 Cf. Majigao, pp. 223-24. The name is misconstrued as Zhong Zhang'ao in David McMullen, State and Scholars in Tang China (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 299 n. 65. 18 It is unknown whether the text translated below represents the entirety of the rhapsody. The title, Hexingfu ?S'ftPJ?, suggests that this may be only one section of a longer work. 19 This distinction between cai ~Jf and xing '?; is typical of the Six Dynasties. See Liao Qifa IP?E?8, Xian-Qin Liang-Han renxinglunyu jiaoyu sixiangyanjiu 7fe?jiM??A'ttiEI??&amp;WS^W;rL (Chongqing: Chongqing chubanshe, 1999), pp. 33-55. 20 Yao was one of the first sage-kings, Jie the tyrannical last ruler of the legendary Xia dynasty, Ji the patron saint of agriculture, and Xie a worthy minister. 21 The phrase is mian cong bei wei E ??blfa?; this could also mean "they obey to one's face but rebel behind one's back," though I think the more salient contrast is between what people profess to do and what they actually do, not between how they behave when supervised and when unsupervised.</page><page sequence="5">XUNZI AND EARLY HAN PHILOSOPHY 139 their speech is like syrup and honey, their minds aggressive and violent. Until they know whether they will succeed or fail, they bully and disparage each other. They do not tread on the path of decency, instead vying to follow aberrant tracks. Engaging and contending with each other for profit and loss, would they respect decrees and in stitutions? Those who cherish humanity and embrace righteousness merely earn their extinction. The Duke of Zhou and Confucius labored in vain; the Doctrine of Reputa tion [mingjiao ?^ifc, a deprecating epithet for conventional Confucianism]22 is a vacu ous construction. Their wisdom was not very different from that of all the imbeciles. If we carry this point further?who is more foolish and who more clever? You gentlemen with legalistic skills, are you able to keep from gnashing your teeth, now grabbing your wrist, now pushing up your sleeves?" [These are all standard tropes for the expression of anger and frustration.] Before Master Xun had finished speaking, Han Fei leapt up from his mat and started to dance; Li Si beat the rhythm, and they sang out loud: "There is an end to the life of our bodies, but no limit to desires. Whether we perceive it with our nose and ears, or we open our mouths and eyes, we take in the whole host of evil and keep a distance from all good things. The tiny space of the human heart is a dizzying cliff. It is easy for human beings to make difficulties [for themselves], so that impediments can arise in an instant. Many thanks, fathomless master. It is not too late for us to recognize this."23 Zhongchang Ao begins with premises that Xunzi would have ac cepted: people are essentially the same, regardless of their birth, and are puny unless they use their social skills to form collectives. But Zhongchang Ao's Xunzi departs from the real Xunzi by proceeding from these initial claims to state that the Duke of Zhou and Confucius were no wiser than anyone else. Xunzi himself would never have as sented to anything of the kind. Rather, he would have argued that they cultivated themselves for a lifetime and thereby distinguished them selves from "all the imbeciles" (chun'eryigai ?ff?-flS) by attaining wis dom of the rarest kind. 22 The implication is that Confucius's teaching is an ostentatious sham. Mingjiao, a term used most commonly by detractors, refers to the ethos of cultivating one's reputation by means of ex hibitionistic acts of virtue.

Knechtges for their help in translating this rhapsody.</page><page sequence="6">140 PAUL R. GOLDIN Zhongchang Ao ends Xunzi's harangue by referring to "gentlemen with legalistic skills" (fashu zhi shi ???$T/?dr),24 a phrase apparently connoting the charge that Xunzi was merely a fajia ?EHc in Confu cian raiments. Nowhere in the rhapsody, neither in Xunzi's speech nor his disciples' song, is there any discussion of self-cultivation?a glaring omission. Whereas Xunzi's fajia epigones used the theory of human nature to advance administrative protocols that appeal to the popula tion's irremediable greed, Xunzi himself insisted that all human beings had both the duty and the capacity to refashion themselves into moral paragons.25 What is interesting about Zhongchang Ao's rhapsody is not that it misrepresents the historical Xunzi, but that it illustrates the tendency of literati in the Six Dynasties to portray him as the founder of the im perial ideology that had recently collapsed and that the aristocracy re garded with attitudes ranging from indifference to seething contempt.26 Various works from this time denigrate Xunzi obliquely but in terms that their readers would not have mistaken; modern scholarship has generally missed the significance of these materials because they often avoid mentioning Xunzi's name explicitly. Consider, for example, the dispute between Ji Kang Mi?. (223-262) and Zhang Miao WiM (d. 291) over the question of whether learning is natural. As the documents have come down to us, Zhang Miao stated his position first, arguing, essentially, that, because people delight in the benefits of education even though these are not inborn, they must naturally love learning. Ji Kang responded: By nature, people love security and hate danger; they love idleness and hate toil. If they are not disturbed, they attain their wishes; if they are not oppressed, they follow their inclinations. In the past, in the era of primeval chaos, Great Simplicity had not yet waned. Lords 24 If this were a Warring States document, fashu zhi shi would have to be translated along the more neutral lines of "men-of-service with methods and techniques," but in Zhongchang Ao's late usa.ge,fashu is more plausibly construed as an accusation that Xunzi was a partisan of the fajia. 25 On this point, see Lee, pp. 75-78; Paul Rakita Goldin, "Xunzi's Piety," in Confucian Spirituality, ed. Tu Weiming and Mary Evelyn Tucker (New York: Herder and Herder, Crossroad, 2003), 1:297-301; Wei Zhengtong %WiM, Xunzi yu gudai zhexue ?j?J^SIt??^, 2d edition (Taipei: Shangwu chubanshe, 1992), pp. 218-43; and L?on Vandermeersch, La formation du L?gisme: Re cherche sur la constitution d'une philosophie politique caract?ristique de la Chine ancienne (Paris: Ecole Fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient, 1965), pp. 202-9. 26 On the range of post-Han attitudes, see, e.g., Paul Rakita Goldin, The Culture of Sex in Ancient China (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2002), pp. 111-22, and the references cited therein.</page><page sequence="7">XUNZI AND EARLY HAN PHILOSOPHY 141 were not contriving above, the people not quarrelsome below. Things were whole and the Plan flowed smoothly; no one failed to attain [satisfaction]. If people were full, they slept peacefully; if they were hungry, they went in search of food. They drummed on their bellies cheerfully. Unbeknownst to them, this was the era of ultimate virtue. How could they know the principles of humanity and righteousness or the contrivances of ritual and law? When such "ultimate men" no longer existed, the Great Way deteriorated and be came decrepit; it was then that people first produced writing and ink in order to transmit their ideas. They differentiated among the teeming things, causing there to be species and clans. They invented humanity and righteousness and thereby hampered their minds. They instituted titles and duties in order to regulate [the world] around them. They "encouraged learning" and lectured on writings to make their teachings seem spir itual. Thus the farrago of the Six Canons and the multifarious Hundred Schools opened the road to glory and profit, and people raced along, astonished and unaware.27 Any educated reader would have recognized "They 'encouraged learning'" (quanxue ffij^P) as an allusion to the first chapter of the Xunzi28 This was a popular chapter title in early imperial times29? it is attested in Lilshi chunqiu Sft^l^C (The springs and autumns of Mr. L?),30 the Xinshu fill (New writings) attributed to Jia Yi Mit (201-169 b.c.),31 and Da Dai Liji ^HclUlE (The ritual records of Dai the Elder),32 and was also the title of a lost book by Cai Yong ?H (a.d. 133-192)33? but the oldest and most famous work to contain an "Encouraging Learning" chapter is the Xunzi. Interpreting Ji Kang's essay as a veiled criticism of Xunzi only adds to the argument's coherence. "They dif ferentiated among the teeming things" can be unpacked as a reference to Xunzi's theory that the fundamental characteristic of human beings 27 "Nan Ziran haoxue lun" Si ? ^$? ^fw, in Ji Kangjijiaozhu fSStHtSai, ed.

GOLDIN is to make distinctions.34 Although Ji Kang uses the phrase "humanity and righteousness" (renyi t2?) while Xunzi preferred "ritual and righ teousness" (liyi ?HI?),35 Ji goes on to mention another favorite theme of Xunzi, namely, the establishment of hierarchies that enable human society to colonize the rest of the world.36 And the reference to the "Six Canons" is perhaps the most pointed of all his allusions, since Xunzi has been renowned since the dawn of the empire as the primary transmitter of the Confucian canon.37 In sum, Xunzi emerges from Ji Kang's account as the chief architect of everything that he and his group disdained: artificial ritualism, counterfeit erudition, and an op pressive network of laws that serve only to interfere with the innocuous enjoyment of life. These are not exactly the same charges conveyed by Zhongchang Ao in his rhapsody, in which Xunzi rejects the "Doctrine of Reputation." Ji Kang, by contrast, sees him as one of the figures who worked to impose the detested social code. What Ji Kang and Zhongchang Ao have in common, however, is that they both regard Xunzi as an apologist for the Qin and Han empire. Although Xunzi is sometimes caricatured, even today, as a kind of Legalist Confucian,38 any allegation that he was an intellectual cat's paw for the Qin regime is baseless.39 In Ji Kang's and Zhongchang 34 See Goldin, Rituals of the Way, pp. 72-74.

Not more than one or two generations before Xunzi, the idea that an aged ruler should abdicate and choose a worthy successor from among the general populace, instead of bequeathing the throne to his son, was still being taken seriously. Xunzi criticized the practice and the standard justifica tions for it in "Zhenglun" IE sue, Xunzi jijie 12.18.331-36; thereafter, abdication was no longer</page><page sequence="9">XUNZI AND EARLY HAN PHILOSOPHY 143 Ao's day, however, it might have rung true if Xunzi was indeed com monly seen as one of the founding fathers of the loathed imperial state. In order to gauge the likelihood of this association in the minds of Six Dynasties literati, one must examine afresh Xunzi's influence on early Han philosophy. What little has been written on this subject is often based on obso lete scholarly assumptions. For example, John Knoblock declares that, after the establishment of the Han dynasty, "Xunzi's influence . . . markedly declined, especially in the reign of Emperor Wu when the in tellectual atmosphere was at odds with Xunzi's basic views."40 Presum ably, Knoblock is referring to Dong Zhongshu, whose omenology has conventionally been understood as incompatible with Xunzi's Tianlun ^m (Discourse on heaven). Nevertheless, as the following discussion will show, Dong Zhongshu stands with Lu Jia HW (ca. 228?ca. 140 b.c.) as one of the two early Han philosophers who were most eager to apply Xunzi's theories to the new circumstances presented by the creation of the imperial state. It is not surprising that scholars have had a hard time limning Xunzi's status in the early Han when they cannot even agree as to whether Dong Zhongshu followed or repudiated him. There are other reasons why this subject has not been studied care fully. The first has to do with the condition of the extant sources. Not one of the four great early Han political advisors, namely Shusun Tong MLWM (ft. 209-188 b.c.), Lu Jia, Jia Yi, and Dong Zhongshu, has had his works transmitted to the present day in uncontested editions. Shu sun Tong's Han Hqi zhidu WkWt^MJ?. (Han ritual institutes) survives only in fragments,41 and the collected works of Lu Jia, Jia Yi, and Dong considered viable by literati. See Yuri Pines, "Disputers of Abdication: Zhanguo Egalitarianism and the Sovereign's Power," 7P 91.4-5 (2005): 243-300. 40 Xunzi: A Translation and Study of the Complete Works (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1988 94), 1:49.

Yet another reason why Xunzi's imprimatur has so rarely been no ticed in this body of literature is that early Han philosophers do not generally focus on the problem of human nature. Dong Zhongshu has a theory of human nature (xing 14), to be discussed below, but it is not the centerpiece of his philosophy; Jia Yi and Lu Jia seldom refer to it in their works.48 As we have seen, the chestnut that "xing e" was Xunzi's central argument was already widespread by the Tang dynasty, and thereafter attempts to discover Xunzi's influence on later thinkers almost always took xing as their focus. But one can infer from the earli est extant comments about Xunzi that his arguments concerning xing were not taken to be his most distinctive contribution until the Eastern Han at the earliest. Not until Wang Chong is there even any exter nal confirmation that Xunzi did indeed advance the "xing e" theory.49 Moreover, the newly discovered Guodian f|5/?5 and Shanghai Museum documents show that Xunzi's understanding of xing was unexceptional for its time and that Mencius's use of the term, rather, would have been considered eccentric.50 All this means that one will rediscover Xunzian themes in early Han philosophy only if one is prepared to set aside the notion that Xunzianism begins and ends with xing e. It is reasonable to begin a reassessment of Xunzi's influence on Han philosophy with Lu Jia, since this figure may have belonged to Xun zi's own pedagogical lineage. Tang Yan /US (the alternative name of the Manchu scholar Zhenjun M$l, 1857-1920), reported that "some" 47 Especially that by Xu Fuguan. 48 According to Wang Xingguo, pp. 245-49, Jia Yi held that there is both good and evil (in vary ing ratios) in human nature, but this appraisal is based on a synthesis of Jia Yi's views expressed in other contexts. There is no evidence that Jia Yi ever felt obliged to construct an explicit theory of xing.

(The dates of Xunzi's birth and death are an unsettled question, but he may well have been dead before Lu Jia was even born.) More plausible is the thesis that Lu Jia was a disciple of Xunzi's student Fuqiu Bo ??JEn{?, whose other famous pupils included Shen Pei $i? (d. after 139 b.c.) and Liujiao SI5, Prince of Chu ^ (r. 201-178 b.c.).52 Lu Jia speaks highly of Fuqiu (whom he calls Bao qiu IE i?) in an enigmatic passage in New Speeches,53 where he seems to have originated the rhetorical trope of comparing Fuqiu favorably with the more widely acclaimed Li Si.54 Lu Jia also quotes frequently from the Guliang zhuan WtW^W (Guliang commentary) to the Chunqiu #|^ (Springs and autumns), a tradition that Fuqiu Bo's student Shen Pei is known to have transmitted to others, so it is possible that Lu Jia learned it from Fuqiu Bo himself.55 However, if Lu Jia really was a student of Fuqiu Bo, this fact must have been forgotten even in antiquity, as he is never mentioned alongside Fuqiu's other disciples.56 At any rate, the strongest evidence of Lu Jia's indebtedness to Xunzi lies on the level of ideas.57 Like Xunzi, Lu Jia appealed to the classics as 51 "Tang Yan Luzi Xinyu jiaozhu xu" /SSPE:ff/??p4$??ff:, reproduced in Xinyujiaozhu */f fn? ??, ed.

As is well known, Xunzi argued strongly against the old idea that weird occur rences on earth can be rationalized as monitory signs from Heaven. When stars shoot down and trees squall, the citizens are all terrified. They say, "What is this?" I say, "It is nothing." These are the shifts in Heaven and Earth, transforma tions of yin and yang, material anomalies. It is acceptable to wonder at them, but it is not acceptable to fear them. No generation has been without eclipses of the sun and moon, untimely winds and rains, or the appearance of wondrous stars. If the ruler is enlightened and the government peaceful, even if such things arise all together, they cannot cause any harm. If the ruler is benighted and the government precarious, even if none of these things should happen, [their absence] will confer no benefit.60 What is crucial, in other words, is not how loudly the trees may have squalled this year, but how people have behaved. Xunzi goes on to expound his theory of "human portents" (renyao ?f?), a term de noting the many shortsighted and immoral acts through which human beings bring on their own ruin. "When ritual and morality are not cultivated" (liyi bu xiu |?il^Rl?) and "when men and women engage in licentious disorder" (nannilyinluan ^^C^SL) are typical examples of "human portents." Heaven has no part in such affairs. Now and then strange things may happen in the skies, but they have happened at all moments in history, and they have never been sufficient to destroy a prudent and moral society?whereas an imprudent and immoral society will fail even if it is spared an eclipse. Good acts have good consequences; bad acts have bad consequences; and only fools (and hypocrites) wait for Heaven to intercede.61 ?? ftJ?, Hebei daxue xuebao M^L^PPSz 1980.1: 63-74.

GOLDIN Lu Jia accepted this framework, but with a single, consequential inno vation: people bring about their own fortune or misfortune by emitting qiM. Thus when societies fail and the Way is lost, it is not the work of Heaven. The lord of the state has done something to cause it. Bad government breeds bad qi; bad qi breeds disasters and abnormalities. Locusts are born in accordance with the qi; rainbows ap pear in accordance with the government. When the Way of Order is lost below, the patterns of Heaven change above. [This is a reference to comets and other celestial prodigies.] When bad government flows among the people, locusts are born in the wilderness.62 By adding the element of qi?a term that Xunzi almost never used, and certainly did not build into his metaphysics?Lu Jia retains Xunzi's volitionless and mechanistic Heaven but forges a novel philosophical justification for the arcane science of omenology, which Xunzi merci lessly deprecated. Where Xunzi counseled us to ignore abnormalities, Lu Jia accepts their validity as "admonitions" (jie ?jJc). However, for Lu Jia as for Xunzi, Heaven itself has no effect on our success or failure. If a cloud of locusts appears, we should know that we are responsible for their generation through our own maleficent conduct.63 This nuance helps to explain arguments in New Speeches that might otherwise seem mutually contradictory. A typical example is furnished by the following passage, in which Lu takes pains to describe the kind of behavior that will educe auspicious and inauspicious natural re sponses. He calls these responses "tallies" (fu f?f). If those located in superior positions are not indolent, they will cause no harm to those below. If you grasp the One in governing all things, then even if [your power] is sparse, it will certainly become massive. If your mind is self-indulgent and your passions dissi pated, then even if you are lofty, you will certainly collapse.

Thus the tallies stimulated by qi may be pure and bright; the expression of one's unvarnished inner state may be serene and harmonious. One who is complaisant is firm; one who is tranquil is blessed. If your will is settled and your mind at peace, your veins will be strong.64 The same chapter, however, contains a scathing condemnation of omenology: People of this generation do not study the Odes and Documents, perpetuate humanity and righteousness, respect the Way .of the Sages, or plumb the depths of the canoni cal arts. Instead, they present unverifiable sayings, study things that are not so, chart the shape of Heaven and Earth, explain abnormalities such as disasters and prodigies. They rebel against the methods of the Former Kings; they depart from the intention of the Sages; they delude the minds of scholars and seduce the will of ordinary people. They approve or disapprove of current affairs by pointing to Heaven and demarcating the Earth. They motivate people with evil prodigies and alarm them with wonders. Those who listen to them think they are like spirits; those who look at them think they are extraordinary.65 Does Lu himself not "explain abnormalities such as disasters and prodigies"? At first blanch it may seem odd that Lu spares no venom in censuring augurs and seers, when portents clearly have a place in his own cosmology. The first of these two excerpts goes so far as to imply that one can perceive people's virtue by studying their countenance?a practice commonly known as "physiognomy" (xiang ffl), which Xunzi, as one might expect, bitterly criticized.66 Why is physiognomy permis sible if astromancy is not? Such seeming discrepancies can be recon ciled by assuming that Lu's ire is aimed at those who fail to apply his &lt;7?-based theory of omenology, which locates the ultimate source of all portents firmly within the human realm. In Lu's view, one who pur ports to explain prodigies by decoding supposed changes in Heaven is a charlatan; one who explains them as the natural reaction to offen sive qi released by human beings in the process of committing immoral acts, is a philosopher.67 64 "Huail?" fUA, Xinyujiaozhu B.9.139.

Lu Jia's conception of omens is, therefore, informed by that of Xunzi, but not identical to it. What Lu Jia kept intact, however, was Xunzi's image of an eternal and constant Heaven that does not will fully interfere in human affairs; Lu drew from this premise the same distinctive conclusion as Xunzi: creating a good world is a task that Heaven began but human beings must "complete." After giving us the necessary faculties and resources, Heaven thrust us into an incomplete world that awaits transformation at our hands. Xunzi's formulation of this idea was "Heaven and Earth give birth to it; the Sages complete it" ^iti?z?^L, ?A?c^L,68 to which Lu Jia alludes at the beginning of his book: "It is handed down: 'Heaven gives birth to the Myriad Things, Earth nourishes them, and the Sages complete them'" {?B: ^?EH^, J?lit???y?5 ?? AOC?.69 Lu Jia goes on to assert, in line with Xunzi, that the Sages provided the people with morality and civilization, which they fashioned on the basis of principles observed in nature: Then the first sage [Fuxi iXI?t]70 looked up and observed Heaven's patterns, looked down and investigated the principles of Earth. He graphed Qian $2 and Kun $$ [the trigrams representing Heaven and Earth] in order to fix the Way of Humanity. For the first time, the people became aware; they came to know the intimacy between father and son, the righteous relationship between lord and minister, the separation between husband and wife, the precedence between elder and younger. Then the Hundred Of fices were established and the Way of Kings was born.71 There follows a lengthy sequence of sages, from the Divine Farmer |$J| and the other heroes of highest antiquity, who furnished the may claim for themselves, and influence others to claim, complete autonomy from the teachings of the sages."

All these achievements required the genius of human beings. Although the Sages were careful to accord with Heaven's principles in their works ("they governed the Earth by making themselves subalterns of Heaven" 7S5Cl?iti2),72 Heaven itself did nothing to bring these advances about.73 Lu Jia returns to this theme on several occasions, as below: The Sages received the brilliance of Heaven; they took the movements of the sun and moon as a standard of rectitude, recorded the measurements of the stars and constel lations, accorded with what is profitable in Heaven and on Earth, ranked the grada tions of lofty and base, and set up [ways of exploiting] the commodious mountains and rivers. They pacified the Four Seas, divided the Nine Continents, made everyone's likes and dislikes similar, and unified customs.74 Sometimes Lu depicts the human achievement of creation in literal terms, as in the following passage, where he implies that the sage kings and ministers of antiquity, by deposing wicked rulers and thereby usher ing in a golden age of peace and morality, induced the Yellow River and Luo River to yield their precious scriptures: Lords like Tang ? [of Shang jffi] and Wu ? [of Zhou il] and ministers like Yi Yin ffi P" and L? Shang S f? carried out punishments in accord with the Heavenly seasons; they moved in concert with yin andyang. Above, they observed Heaven's patterns; below, they examined people's hearts. They subdued the many [troops of their enemies] with the few [troops at their disposal]; they controlled the strong despite their weakness. With but three hundred armored chariots and three thousand armed soldiers, they chastised their enemy and quashed his hosts. In this way, they requited their great en mity; they suppressed contrary and disorderly lords, and eliminated the source of un ruly turpitude. The world was at peace, and families and individuals were adequately supplied; ordinary men practiced humanity, and even merchants were trustworthy.

GOLDIN The notion that we are enjoined by circumstances to complete our own creation manifestly rests on the belief that Heaven, like an absen tee god, withdrew after producing the natural world, leaving it behind for humanity to cultivate. The philosophy of Huang-Lao Jf^:, though it differs from that of Lu Jia in many respects, proceeds from a similar conception of Heaven and the Way as forces that abide by knowable laws, rather than as conscious beings who can be swayed with prayers or blandishments.76 Xunzi's lingering prestige must have contributed to the popularity of this kind of cosmology. On the one hand, he was not the sole parent of this way of thinking, since the conception of the universe as a place governed by constant principles rather than capri cious spirits characterizes much of the late Warring States literature. It is obviously anticipated in the Laozi 3?~F, and permeates such texts as Pheasant-Cap Master (Heguanzi %%M~P)77 as well. On the other hand, Xunzi did the most to make this outlook intellectually respectable at the turn of the third century b.c.78 Two other passages in Lu Jia's work bespeak Xunzi's influence. Though less central to his philosophy than his theories of Heaven and omenology, these are in some respects even more revealing, because they may shed light on the type of material that was used in his edu cation. In the first of these passages, Lu Jia refers to the obscure story that Confucius executed a man named Petty Officer Mao ^IE5P.79 To my knowledge, the oldest extant source of the tale is the Touzuo W ^ 76 On Huang-Lao, see Ding Yuanming TM?^, Huang-Lao xue lungang^^^m?Wi (Jinan: Shan dong daxue chubanshe, 1997); and R.

Though transmitted as a chapter of the Xunzi,80 this is probably not by Xunzi himself, but rather, as Knoblock has suggested, may be part of a body of texts that Xunzi assembled as a "proper curriculum."81 The same chapter may be the source of another article of Confucian lore repeated by Lu Jia: the story that Confucius and his disciples encountered hardship when they were traveling be tween Chen Pit and Cai ?. (The locus classicus is Analects 15.2.)82 Signifi cantly, Lu Jia uses this anecdote to illustrate the truism that unfavorable circumstances sometimes preclude success: When the Master was in distress between Chen and Cai, his beans, rice, vegetables, and broth were not sufficient to stave off hunger, nor his disciples' plain shirtsleeves83 and rag gowns sufficient to ward off the cold. They were in dire straits, having placed themselves in such extremes. However, the Master took the Way as his responsibility84 and his disciples remained close to righteousness. Though only a gentleman of plain clothes [i.e., not a salaried officer], above he [lacuna] the Son of Heaven and below he pacified the common people; he wearied his body in order to assist his superior. He lamented the decay of the House of Zhou and the disuse of ritual and righteousness. Although he tumbled into straitened circumstances, he peregrinated and declaimed before the feudal lords; he wished to rectify the Way of Emperors and Kings and re turn [proper] government to the world. But he did not have the right standing and the age did not have the right ruler. He wandered around the world, but there was no one who matched his intentions.85 It is telling that Lu ends with the observation that the world was not ready for Confucius, because, as I have argued elsewhere,86 "The Warning Vessel on the Right" appears to be the oldest text conjoining the two well-worn tropes on display in this passage, namely "Confucius and his disciples faced difficulties between Chen and Cai" and "even sages will suffer failure if the circumstances are not propitious." Thus it seems likely that Lu Jia learned of this episode, as well as that of Petty 80 Xunzijijie 20.28.520-21. 81 Knoblock, 3:237. 82 See, generally, John Makeham, "Between Chen and Cai: ^huangzi and the Analects" in Wandering at Ease in the Zhuangzi, ed.

GOLDIN Officer Mao, from the same kind of textbook that Xunzi had compiled one or two generations earlier. Thus far, the discussion has dwelled on Lu Jia, not because he is a par ticularly original thinker, but because his works have suffered relatively little damage and the derivation of his ideas from those of Xunzi is transparent. When we turn to Dong Zhongshu, however, the situation becomes more complicated. Although there is a great deal of writing attributed to Dong Zhongshu, its authenticity, as mentioned above, is difficult to evaluate. A researcher wishes neither to be waylaid by trust ing a spurious document nor to dismiss one that turns out to be genu ine. The most judicious approach may be to place the most stock in the quotations from Dong Zhongshu found in texts other than Luxuri ant Dew, especially the set of memorials reproduced by Ban Gu in the History of the Han, but this technique has two defects of its own: first, it narrows the scope of the evidence (and removes much of it from its original context);87 second, it places us at the mercy of those respon sible for the preservation of these materials, since they may have had their own reasons for distorting Dong's work. Indeed, there is reason to suspect that Ban Gu may have habitually condensed and doctored the texts cited in his history.88 Moreover, Dong's arguments are sometimes confusing and contradictory. For all these reasons, any modern recon struction of his philosophy is necessarily tentative. Critics have surmised for centuries that Dong Zhongshu was influ enced by Lu Jia,89 and in some ways, their philosophies are similar. Like Lu, Dong is most renowned for his omenology and made qi a crucial element of his theory. But Dong introduced a productive dis tinction: instead of discussing qi as a uniform, monadic substance, he 87 For example, Dai Junren, 2:868-80, facing a similar methodological problem in his analysis of Jia Yi, elects to disregard Xinshu and limit himself to the sources quoted in Han shu, but ends up with an overview of Jia Yi's philosophy that deals almost exclusively with politics. 88 See Arbuckle, "Restoring Dong Zhongshu," pp. 66-76. 89 See, e.g., "Anshu" iS?, Lunhengjiaoshi 29.83.1169. Li Dingfang, pp. 67-68 and 74 n. 24, asserts that evidence is found in Xijing zoji EaS?rS as well, but does not give a precise reference.

This refinement allowed him to construct cosmological arguments of unprecedented specificity. Good government, in Dong's view, properly attunes the yin and yang aspects of the qi that makes up the world, with magnificent results: Thus one who is a ruler of men rectifies his heart in order to rectify his court, rectifies his court in order to rectify the Hundred Offices, rectifies the Hundred Offices in order to rectify the myriad people, and rectifies the myriad people in order to rectify the four quarters. When the four quarters are rectified, no one near or far dares not be at one with this rectification, and there is no perverse qi to cause turmoil among them. Thus yin and yang are attuned and the wind and rain timely; the teeming things are harmo nious and the myriad people fertile; the Five Cereals ripen and the plants and trees flourish.90 By the same token, bad government causes yin and yang to produce catastrophes: Later generations, in their licentiousness and indolence, decayed, and [rulers] were no longer able to control the teeming things. The feudal lords became treacherous; they preyed on the good ordinary people in order to compete with each other for arable territory. They did away with the instruction of virtue and relied on laws and punish ments. When laws and punishments are not appropriate, perverse qi is born. Perverse qi gathers among inferiors, and resentment and evil collect among superiors. When superiors and inferiors are not in harmony, yin and yang become deranged, and portents and catastrophes are born. This is the reason why disasters and abnormalities arise.91 The "Yubao dui" Mfif? (The conversation about rain and hail), attributed to Dong Zhongshu and a disciple named Bao Chang I??, lists the many auspicious signs of an era of utmost peace (taiping zhi shi ^^/?tft), and concludes: In such a case, when a sage is at the top, yin and yang are harmonized and the wind and rain timely.

GOLDIN not be attuned; the wind will overturn houses; the rain will flood the rivers; snow will get into oxen's eyes; and hail will kill donkeys and horses.92 Thus far, Dong Zhongshu's system is in line with what Lu Jia had taught two generations earlier: our actions cause reactions in qi, and those reactions in turn produce desirable or undesirable natural phe nomena.93 However, Dong's biographies record that he applied this yinyang framework to rain-making rituals of his own devising.94 Here he departs from his predecessors, as there is no record that either Lu Jia or Jia Yi performed rain-making rituals, while Xunzi, as is well known, ridiculed them.95 In Dong's view, virtuous conduct is not the only way to guarantee a favorable climate; in an emergency, one can also imple ment corrective measures that quickly restore a salutary balance ofyin andyang. When Zhongshu governed the principality [i.e., of Jiangdu tCfP, where he served as Chancellor], he inferred the manner in which yin and yang interact from prodigies such as the disasters and abnormalities [recorded in] the Springs and Autumns. Thus when he sought rain, he would close off all yang and set loose allyin; when he wished to stop the rain, he would do the opposite. Practicing this throughout the principality, he never failed to attain the end he desired.96 Another text, ostensibly from his tenure as Chancellor of Jiangdu, confirms that Dong dealt with drought by trying to redress the super abundance of yang and shortage of yin. 92 Preserved in "Dong Zhongshu da Bao Chang wen jingshi yubao," Xijing zqji, 5.241-42; and the anonymous Tang dynasty compilation, Guwenyuan rS" 3t5E, ed.

I request, Great Prince, that you allow an exemption of one month's worth of taxes to those women in Guangling MW. who act as invocators on behalf of others. Grant [this concession] to the various shamanesses.97 The various shamanesses, whether great or petty, should gather at the gate of the outer wall; they should make a small altar in order to immolate dried meat and liquor. The women should, by themselves, select a broad and convenient place for the market to be moved to. The market deputies should not let in any men, for men should not be permitted to go drink and eat with [the women]. Order each of the officials' wives to go and see her husband. When all this has come to pass, [the procedure] will have be gun; the rain will saturate the ground, and then it will stop."98 The cosmological underpinnings of this rite are the same as in Dong's explanation of baleful prodigies: through their actions, human beings alter the balance of qi in the world, often with disastrous effects; but once the science of ^'-manipulation is properly understood and ap plied, it becomes possible to reverse the negative consequences of mis guided actions and re-establish an equilibrium ofyin and yang through a series of precisely coordinated ceremonies. Dong's method is rem iniscent of the remedies of traditional doctors, who attack disease? construed as the manifestation of an imbalance of qi in the body?by attempting to restore equilibrium. This affinity with medical reasoning may even have contributed to the common misconception that Dong also subscribed to the cosmography of the Five Phases, for it is charac teristic of early imperial medical texts?for example, the Huangdi neijing ff'n? F^$S (Inner canon of the Yellow Emperor)?to invoke bothyinyang and" the Five Phases.99 The yinyang paradigm was so congenial to Dong Zhongshu that he even employed it in trying to put to rest the never-ending debate over human nature:100 "In the great warp of Heaven, there is both yin and 97 The association of shamans and especially shamanesses with rain-making rituals is ancient; see, e.g., "Siwu" W]M, Zfiouli zhushu jiUS?EB?t, in Shisan jing zhushu fu jiaokan ji ~h?If ?iif?ffi' ?SSJjqE (1817; rpt., Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1980), 26.816a: "If there is a great drought in the state, [the Director of Shamans] leads the shamans and dances the rain-making rite"; and "N?wu" j?CM, Zfiouli zhushu 26.816c: "If there is a scorching drought, [the shamanesses] dance the rain-making rite."

Tin qi is base; yang qi is humane. Those who say that human nature is good are looking at the yang, those who call it evil are looking at theyin."m With this tidy so lution, Dong sought to reconcile the Mencian and Xunzian camps in a typically syncretistic way: each is correct on its own terms, but both have missed the deeper truth. However, Dong's theory, taken to its log ical conclusion, leads to a philosophical quagmire. If it is true that the base aspects of our being are due to yin, and the virtuous aspects to yang, then it follows that good people have a preponderance of yang, evil people a preponderance of yin. (It might even follow that one could improve oneself by augmenting one's yang, but if Dong ever espoused this view, there is no longer any document that attests to it.) Aside from raising grave gender problems,102 this means that, in a nation of inordi nately virtuous people, yang qi would outweigh yin?precisely the con dition that, as we have seen, produces drought. According to Dong's scheme, then, it would seem that the maintenance of seasonable weather requires the troubling premise that human beings stay contin ually suspended in a state halfway between good and evil. Whether this dilemma can be chalked up to the imperfect condition of the sources or represents a genuine contradiction in Dong's thinking is not easy to determine,103 but it may help explain the declining esteem that Dong was accorded in the centuries after his death. Elaborate cosmologies without a commensurately robust concept of self-cultivation have not enjoyed lasting popularity in Chinese history. Dong's cosmology is incoherent in other respects. His rationalization 101 From a lost text by Dong elucidating xingqing ttfif, quoted by Wang Chong in "Benxing," Lun hengjiaoshi 3.13.139-40.

Queen. Some material in Chunqiu fanlu, especially Chapters 35 and 36, "Shencha minghao" W-^^^ and "Shixing" K'B:, presents a different image of the xing. "Shixing," for example, offers a straightforward post-Xunzian understanding of human nature and goodness: "[When speaking of] xing, one should be aware of what it denotes: what arises without being con tingent on anything else, what one possesses from birth. The goodness that one possesses is [the result of] education and instruction; it is no longer xing.

But other pas sages in the memorials recorded in the History of the Han suggest that Heaven does play an active role in the generation of omens after all. I, your servant, have carefully reviewed the contents of the Springs and Autumns, where I have seen the affairs carried out by previous generations. In this way I have ob served that the locus of interactions between Heaven and human beings is dreadful. When a state is about to be vanquished because it has lost the Way, Heaven first pro duces disasters in order to reprimand [the ruler]; if he does not then know to scrutinize himself, it produces further abnormalities in order to alarm him; if he still does not know to change, his vanquishment will come to pass. One sees in this that the heart of Heaven loves the lord of men and wishes to put an end to disorder on his part. As long as his generation is not one that has utterly lost the Way, Heaven wishes only to sup port him and make him secure.104 One might contend that Dong's characterization of Heaven as a willful entity that sincerely loves the terrestrial ruler is merely a fa?on de parler: perhaps he means that Heaven is really mechanistic, but that the mysterious cosmic processes appear to us as though guided by an intel ligent divinity (rather in the way that microbiologists today sometimes speak of viri that "learn" to attack different kinds of hosts). However, the proviso in the final line that Heaven will not send omens unless the society is corrigible?which, as other documents confirm, is to be taken seriously105?makes this interpretation problematic. If Heaven were merely the sum total of all natural laws, the consequences of our actions would be the same regardless of the moral standing of our ep och. A Heaven that considers whether we can profit from its omens before it produces them must have some degree of consciousness. Whether Dong Zhongshu's Heaven is (to borrow one scholar's termi nology) "naturalistic" or "anthropomorphic"106 remains an unresolved 104 "Dong Zhongshu zhuan," Han shu 56.2498.

But it is clear that Dong imag ines Heaven's workings, at least for practical purposes, as rational and regular. For example, he believes, like Xunzi and Lu Jia, that the Sages produced civilization by following the normative patterns laid down by Heaven. I, your servant, have heard that Heaven is the ancestor of the teeming creatures. Thus it covers, embraces, and contains them everywhere, so that nothing is divergent. It has established the sun, moon, wind, and rain in order to harmonize them; it regulates yin, yang, cold, and hot in order to complete them. Thus the Sages modeled themselves on Heaven and took their stand in the Way. Indeed, they loved broadly and did away with selfishness; they broadcast virtue and acted with benevolence in order to enrich [the people], and set up propriety and erected ritual in order to guide them.107 Again like Xunzi and Lu Jia, Dong Zhongshu believed that the greatest of the Sages' achievements was the composition of the Five Canons. Dong himself specialized in the Springs and Autumns, and cited that work most frequently, but he appreciated the unique value of each of the other four canons, and envisioned the entire corpus as a syn optic whole.108 Moreover, for Dong as for Xunzi, the Sages' literary productions also included efficacious music, which inspires listeners to improve their habits and pattern their own utterances after the Sages' august models.109 Armed with rites and scriptures inherited from the Sages, human beings organize themselves into stratified societies and thereby take their rightful place as suzerains of the living world.110 and Other Essays on Science and Confucian Ethics (Hong Kong: Chinese University Press, 2005), p. 71.

Within, they have intimacy between fathers and sons, elder brothers and younger brothers; without, they have propriety between lords and vassals, superiors and inferiors. When they gather and convene, they have conventions for seniors and juniors. Brilliantly they receive each other with culture; sedately they love each other with magnanimity. This is the manner in which humans are noble. They grow the Five Cereals in order to feed themselves, cultivate silk and hemp in order to clothe themselves, and tend the Six Domestic Animals in order to nourish themselves. They tame oxen, harness horses, ensnare leopards, and cage tigers. This is because they have obtained the numen of Heaven; they are nobler than other crea tures. Thus Confucius said: "Of the living things111 among Heaven and Earth, human beings are the noblest."112 A brief examination of Jia Yi's views of omens and ritual will serve to highlight the distinctive features of Lu Jia's and Dong Zhongshu's philosophies. Jia Yi agreed with his two coevals that human beings are responsible for their own fortune or misfortune and thus have no cause to blame Heaven:113 Doing good is simply the way to bring fortune on oneself; doing evil is simply the way to bring ruin on oneself. Thus Heaven cannot assail those who have received Heaven bestowed fortune, while those who have been ruined by Heaven must not complain to Heaven, for they have caused this by their own actions. Those who know what is good but do not practice it are called unenlightened; those who know evil but do not reform themselves will certainly receive calamities from Heaven. Heaven's fortune is constant: it is always bestowed on the virtuous. Heaven's ruin is constant: it is always bestowed on those who snatch the people [for labor] during the wrong seasons.114 Yet it is clear from this and similar passages that Jia Yi does not re serve a role for qi?let alone yin and yang?in bringing about fortune or ruin. In this respect, he remains closer to Xunzi than either Lu Jia or Dong Zhongshu.

It is also worth noting that Jia Yi, in line with Xunzi but in contrast to Lu Jia, argued unambiguously against physiognomy.115 In other matters, however, Jia Yi departed further from Xunzi than did either Lu Jia or Dong Zhongshu. Like most Han philosophers, Jia Yi was drawn to the idea of using ritual to differentiate roles within society, but he stressed the stability and order that would ensue rather than the power of human beings to dominate other species:116 If [distinctions between] the lowly and honorable are made manifest, if superiors and inferiors are distinguished, then human relations will fit the proper standards. Thus the ruler is to his vassals as the sun to the stars. Vassals do not hope to be able to imi tate the ruler; the base do not hope to be able to encroach on the noble. If inferiors do not exceed their grades, the position of superiors will be honored; if vassals do not step beyond their level, the position of the lord is secure. If one carefully safeguards this skein of relations, disorder will have no place to arise from.117 Similarly Jia Yi stated: Thus the Sage Kings of antiquity instituted the range of grades. Inside [the royal court], there were the [Three] Excellencies, the [Nine] Ministers, grand masters, and men-of-service; outside [in the feudal domains], there were dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons. After these, there were superintendents and petty officials. They brought [this hierarchy] down to the commoners so that grades and levels would be clearly distinguished. And the Son of Heaven was placed above all of them; thus his honor could not-be reached [by anyone else].118 Xunzi, Lu Jia, and Dong Zhongshu all argued that ritual does more than simply arrange the population in a conveniently governable fash ion; it also benefits human beings by uniting them socially and thus 115 See "Dengqi" If??, Xinshujiaozhu 1.47. 116 Cf.

It is curious that Jia Yi did not emphasize this function of ritual, since it was a distinctive Xunzian idea, and he would not have had an obvious ideological reason for rejecting it. On most im portant issues, however, Jia Yi followed Xunzi more than he deviated from him. However, despite the pervasive influence of Xunzi sketched above, in certain respects Lu Jia, Jia Yi, and Dong Zhongshu have more in common with each other than with Xunzi. Most obviously, they were all subjects of an empire, while Xunzi was not; thus their political argu ments always had to proceed from the assumption that the Son of Heaven had already been chosen. In practice, many of their recom mendations (such as organizing society on the basis of ritual) proved to be similar to those of Xunzi, but with an important theoretical nuance: they were writing about how the emperor could retain his position as Son of Heaven, whereas for Xunzi, the issue was how a particular ruler could achieve it. Similarly, Xunzi could travel from kingdom to kingdom and find a new patron if his old one no longer suited him. He is known to have served in Zhao, Qi, Chu, and Qin, and was free to berate princes in language that might have gotten someone like Jia Yi summarily executed.119 The differences between Xunzi's attitude toward the realm of Qin and those of the early Han writers are attributable to the same cir cumstances. For Xunzi, Qin was a mighty but flawed state that might, if corrected, eventually rule the world;120 for Lu Jia, Jia Yi, and Dong Zhongshu, Qin was an empire that had lost its mandate in spectacular fashion, and whose failure had to be exhaustively analyzed so as never 119 See his scathing epistle to Huang Xie Jtllft (Lord Chunshen If^fq, d. 238 b.c.), preserved in "Ke shui Chunshen jun" ?r??i?F$?q", Z^an?,uo ce^&amp;Wiffi.

GOLDIN to be repeated. Identifying and decrying the excesses of Qin was there fore commonplace in early Han literature.121 Finally, although Lu Jia, Jia Yi, and Dong Zhongshu respected the Five Canons as the patrimony of the ancient sages, they all drew par ticular inspiration from the Springs and Autumns, each becoming identi fied with one of its three major commentarial traditions: ?uo &amp; (Jia Yi), Gongyang (Dong Zhongshu), and Guliang (Lu Jia). In this respect, they may have set the tone for generations of Han literati, who tended to place the Springs and Autumns at the summit of the canon,122 whereas, throughout the Eastern Zhou, the preeminent text had been the Odes. Not long after Dong Zhongshu, Xunzi's star began to set. In Tantie lun l??IEn? (Discourses on salt and iron), compiled in the early first cen tury b.c. by Huan Kuan fell, quotations from Mencius outnumber quotations from Xunzi by ten to one.123 Although one cannot rule out the possibility that these figures might reflect Huan Kuan's own pref erences, it is reasonable to assume that, as a digest of the arguments put forward in a real debate, Discourses on Salt and Iron reveals at least a partial glimpse of the range of authoritative texts that literati were apt to cite at the time. The Xunzi does not seem to have ranked among them. By the Six Dynasties, literati had developed an antipathy toward Xunzi for two reasons: they saw him as the exponent of the weaker 121 The most famous example, Jia Yi's "Guo Qin lun" l?il?tn?, is found in Xinshu jiaozhu 1.1-25.

But neither of these considerations would have carried much weight in Huan Kuan's time, when the end of the empire was not in sight and the discourse of human nature had not yet taken its decisive Mencian turn. That Xunzi should have fallen out of favor so rapidly and thoroughly is puz zling. I believe there are at least two discernible reasons for this trend. First, omenology became increasingly prominent in Han political culture.124 Of the three early Han thinkers discussed in this article, only Jia Yi was ambivalent about the significance of portents, while Lu Jia and Dong Zhongshu both made omenology a cornerstone of their philosophies. Dong's view was the closest to that of later generations; eventually it became impossible to legitimate the ruler's sovereignty without appealing to Heaven-sent omens of various kinds. The bur geoning interest in omens is probably related to another preoccupation of Han political thought, namely, the Mandate of Heaven. Xunzi did not make much use of this concept, and the First Emperor of Qin, in keeping with the times, made little effort to affirm that his reign was mandated by Heaven. The Han historians, by contrast, took pains to scrutinize all the nuggets of evidence indicating that the emperor did indeed enjoy Heaven's sanction.125 With the development of these in tertwined concepts, omenology and Heaven's Mandate, Xunzi's role in shaping imperial ideology could only have been diminished. Second, Xunzi may have suffered for expatiating on li W. instead of ren C Without denying its importance, Xunzi rarely discussed ren, whereas he saw in li the sage guidelines for every conceivable human endeavor. Later writers, even when they admired Xunzi, found them selves compelled to grant ren more political purchase. For example, Jia Yi, no less of a devotee of ritual governance than Xunzi, noted when de scribing the rule of the Sage King Yao that, above all, he practiced ren: He practiced humanity and established righteousness; he spread his virtue and lav ished moral transformation [upon the people].126 Thus, without being rewarded, the people were encouraged; without being punished, the people were orderly.
