<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EARTH-DIVER (Th. A 812) Elli Kaija K6ngas Indiana University Earth-Diver, Th. A 812, has been referred to as "the most widely distributed of all North American Indian myths." 1 The distribution of this myth extends far beyond North America, however. As the German folklorist Will-Erich Peuckert ob- serves, Earth-Diver occurs not only in native North America and in part of native South America, but also in the Pacific Is- lands, Australia, and in eastern Europe. Its most westerly distribution in Europe, Peuckert points out, is among certain groups in East Prussia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and Slovakia; there are also numerous Finnish variants. 2 This wide distribution of Earth-Diver has often been dis- cussed. Later in this paper some interpretations of the myth's dissemination will be briefly reviewed. Earlier scholars were inclined to treat versions from different culture areas as par- allelisms. Yet the versions show striking similarities both in essential and secondary traits. The essence of the myth seems always the same, notwithstanding geographical and cultural distances; even small details correspond in different areas, and the distribution, although wide, is continuous. Observa- tions like these make the investigator doubt the probability of parallelism. Various problems arise from the study of Earth-Diver: problems relating to its origin and diffusion, to the noticeable influence of "book religions" in some of its subtypes, to the 'function" of the myth and its connection with rites. Such 151</page><page sequence="2">152 Ethnohistory topics as these, however, will not be treated herein; I will only try to point out the traits of the myth, briefly review the long discussion about it, and offer a possible explanation of the primary development of Earth-Diver. Earth-Diver in North America The Traits of the Myth. The essence of the Earth-Diver myth in North America has been described thus: In North American Indian myths of the origin of the world, the culture hero has a succession of animals dive into the primeval waters, or flood of waters, to secure bits of mud or sand from which the earth is to be formed. Various animals, birds, and aquatic creatures are sent down into the waters that cover the earth. One after another animal fails; the last one succeeds, however, and floats to the surface, half dead, with a little sand or dirt in his claws. Sometimes it is Muskrat, sometimes Beaver, Hell-diver, Crawfish, Mink who succeeds, after various other animals have failed, in bring- ing up the tiny bit of mud which is then put on the surface of the water and magically expands to be- come the world of the present time. 3 Some variants will be given in extenso to illustrate how the myth is told. In a Shoshone Indian variant the story goes: The whole earth was covered with water. Only on a high mountain there was a dry spot. Our Father sent the Crow to get earth in order to make land. Then the Crow came back stinking. 'You are crazy,' said the Father; 'you have eaten the drowned people. Now, go back, and go around homeless. You will eat whatever any one has killed. Go, now! You will be black.' Then he said to the small birds, 'Come, I will now hear which one of you has a good heart and good sense.' He found that the Chickadee was the only one that had any sense and was good-hearted. Then he bade it bring earth. It brought it. Our Father made the earth out of it. 'It will be small,' he said, 'for little hands brought it. You will have</page><page sequence="3">Earth- Diver 153 six moons. You will not lose track of tongues. You will have good thoughts.' 4 Interesting traits in this variant are the high mountain - there are other myths about the central mountain of the world (Th. A 875.1 and A 875.1.1.) - and Our Father, which may reveal Christian influence here. Explanatory motifs are also incorporated, as is so often the case in North American Indian mythology. Instead of the mountain, the world tree appears in the following Yokuts variant: The whole earth was once covered with water, and there were no living creatures, save an eagle and a crow. There was a stump of a tree that pro- jected above the surface of the watery expanse, and upon this the two birds were wont to stand and hold converse. Finally they became weary of the solitude, and between them they managed to create a duck, which swam about the stump. One day the duck dove to the bottom and brought up some earth on his bill. This struck the eagle and the crow as worth looking into, since they had never seen anything like it. They were very tired of having nothing but the stump to roost on, and as the mud brought up seemed promising, they en- tered into an agreement to keep the duck constant- ly employed diving for it. They could not agree, however, as to where the mud should be deposited. So they divided the world into two portions. After this a scene takes place which is very prevalent in Eurasiatic tradition: the two creators quarrel about their portions of the world. It is mentioned that this is why the eagle is honored and the crow despised. 5 Two ornithomorphic creators are also met in Ukrainian variants, 6 and in versions from Eastern Finland; 7 one gains the impression that not only the diving animals, but also the creator in the form of a bird may be a very ancient trait. We need only to recall another cosmogonic myth, the cosmic</page><page sequence="4">154 Ethnohi story egg (Th. A 641). An interesting detail is the notion that the birds became weary of solitude; this is a basic situation in various creation myths. 8 Primeval water is a feature of both the Shoshone and Yokuts variants above. It also appears in a Cheyenne var- iant telling how a person floated on water which covered the whole earth. Water birds - swans, geese, ducks, and other birds that swim - already existed and were all about the person. He called to some of these birds and asked them to look for some earth. The birds said that they would dive and see if they could find earth at the bottom of the water. Larger birds dived and came up without anything for they could not reach the bottom, but there was one small duck that returned with some mud in its bill. This duck swam to the man and put the mud in his hand. The man took the wet earth and worked it with his fingers until it was dry. They he sprinkled it over the water - made little piles of it on the water - and it formed land and grew and spread until as far as he could see all was solid land. Thus the dry land - the earth - was created.9 Coyote as creator and primeval water appear in the following Crow variant: The earth was all covered with water. Old- Man Coyote alone was going around on the water. Then a little coyote met him. 'I am alone, I am looking for a companion, I'll meet one,' he said. Then they met. There was no living thing then. They went around together. 'We are alone, it is bad; let us make the earth.' 'All right, how shall we make it?' After some time ducks came flying. 'You dear younger brothers, dive here,' he said. 'How shall we do it?' 'Dive into the water, bring earth, we'll make the world,' he said. They brought some. 'Is there any?' 'Yes.' 'Go, bring some.' Four times they brought some, he took it and made the earth ... 10</page><page sequence="5">Earth-Diver 155 Instead of primeval water we have the deluge in a Sarcee Indian variant: Once on a time two young men from above visited the people of the earth. Two sisters, daughters of a chief, fell in love with the young men and wanted to marry them, but the people de- sired that the sisters marry two bright stars above, which they refused to do; so the two young men were murdered by the people, which vexed the Creator, and to punish the people of the earth he caused the water to rise and to drown all of them, save one old man, who saved himself by building a raft, on which he gathered all the animals and birds. After many days, when the water had risen very high, the old man became lonesome and wanted to see land again, so he sent various diving animals down in the water to bring up some earth from the bottom, but as each rose to the surface the old man saw that they were drowned. He examined the paws of each to see if they had any earth, but he found none until he came to the last animal that had been sent down. This was a muskrat, in whose paws was some earth which the old man took and rubbed between his hands, then blew up to increase its size; and after it had increased to such an ex- tent that when the ringed-neck plover was sent around it and returned old and tired, and did not wish to be sent again, the old man was satisfied with the size of the world; so he then began to make rivers, to plant trees, and to distribute the animals he had saved. 1 The deluge motif here seems Biblical: a raft is built, and animals are gathered to be saved. The diving animals are drowned or almost die when they return to the surface of the water, in many North American Indian variants. The measuring of the grown earth appears in the deluge story of the Bible. However, it could be an independently-invented trait; e. g., the Cree- Ojibwa tell about the measuring of the new earth by a wolf. 12</page><page sequence="6">156 Ethnohistory The myth necessarily always begins with the water. It is hard to tell which is more common, primeval water or the deluge, 13 but there is good reason to suppose that pri- meval water is the original trait. 14 The beings who exist are sometimes only animals. 15 Manibozho, 16 (var., Nani- bozhu,17 Wa'n-lbozhil 8) is the culture hero in many Algon- quian versions of the myth; it is he who organizes the div- ing for earth. 19 Other named beings occur in other versions; for example, Siina'wavi in Shoshonean variants 20 and Wesa- kaychak in Cree variants. 21 In the variants quoted above, four different types of locale in which these beings were on the water occur; a mountain, a tree, a raft, and - partic- ularly when the first beings are ornithomorphic - merely the surface of the water. The diver is often Muskrat, alone; he may dive several times. When a series of divers is presented, the animals are, e. g., a raven, an otter, and a muskrat; 22 a kingfisher, a duck, and a turtle;23 swans, geese, ducks, and other birds that swim. 24 The last of these series shows how easily the divers can be changed; the essential point is that the diver must be able to dive. Wilhelm Schmidt in his monumental work, Der Ursprung der Gottesidee, emphasizes the importance of the turtle as the earth-diver: he gives examples from Maidu, 25 Wintun, 26 and Yokuts 27 traditions. He also presents many other Cali- fornia variants in which the duck successfully dives for earth. In most of these versions of Earth-Diver the creator is ornithomorphic: he is the eagle or the hawk. 28 This is extremely interesting, for in several Asian, and even Euro- pean, e. g., Finnish variants, there is only one earth-diver, a duck, and the creator also appears in the form of a bird. Could some of the California versions represent the oldest American variants ?</page><page sequence="7">Earth-Diver 157 The number of animal-divers, and the number of times one or several of them may dive varies, but it is always the last attempt that is the successful one. Even though the last animal dies while diving, a handful of earth is taken from its feet, 29 or a little sand is found under its fingernails. 30 The earth or sand is placed on a raft, increases in size, and becomes a new earth. 31 In Wyandot versions the earth may be rubbed on the edges of the Big Turtle's shell; "And from this small amount soon there was the Great Island upon the Big Turtle's back." 3 Some variants tell that a ball is made from the mud by the creator; then he blows upon it, 'whereupon it seemed to grow rapidly.' 33 In a Carrier myth the earth is kneaded together to form an island and finally the world as it is today. 34 Here, again, we have a trait which also appears in East European vari- ants. 3 The Distribution of the Myth. It is more illuminating to mention those areas in North America in which Earth- Diver does not appear, than to list those in which it does. As the American anthropologist Earl W. Count states, the myth 'covers most of North America, excepting the Eskimo, the Northwest Pacific coast, the Southwest and most of the Southeast [areas]." 36 It is told "from California through the Great Basin, Plains, and Eastern Woodlands to the Atlantic Coast." 37 Of all the North American areas in which Earth-Diver appears, the California one is the most interesting: here more examples have been recorded than elsewhere in North America, and often the variants are rather similar to the Eurasiatic ones. Probably there is no definite split between the two continents. Count has recently stressed this point. He writes:</page><page sequence="8">158 Ethnohistory North American mythology cannot ever be under- stood in terms confined to this continent alone, be- cause much of it is a part of a larger area which includes so much of Eurasia; and the cultural tide has been prevailingly from west to east - Eurasia the donor, North America the recipient. 38 Count also comments that most American scholars have been unaware that Earth-Diver occurs elsewhere than on the North American continent, and that European scholars also have overlooked its total distribution. 39 This is partly true, but the history of Earth-Diver studies shows how the Eurasiatic- American problem occasionally emerges. Earth-Diver in Eurasia The Traits of the Myth. In the Eurasian area many traits of the Earth-Diver myth show a striking similarity to North American traits. The following Yenisei Ostyak variant resembles the Cheyenne variant previously noted: In the beginning, water flowed everywhere, and Doh, the great shaman, was gliding above the waters, accom- panied by swans, red-throated divers, loons, and other water birds. When he could find no place to rest, he asked the red-throated diver to dive into the water and bring a bit of earth from the bottom of the sea. The bird tried twice, but only on the third attempt did he succeed in bring- ing up any earth. From the earth the red-throated diver brought up under his bill, Doh made an island in the sea.40 This Yenesei Ostyak variant, which opens with many water birds accompanying the culture hero, begins like several North American variants. Such an opening, how- ever, is not usual in Eurasia, where only one bird, a div- ing bird,41 a duck,42 a swan,43 or a swallow44 appears, and is said to be the devil in disguise.45 Of course, the</page><page sequence="9">Earth-Diver 159 group of birds may not be an original trait, although it ap- pears on two continents. Nevertheless comparison of the American and Eurasiatic traditions shows that one water bird, at least, was original in the myth. Both the creator and his helper appear in ornithomor- phic form in the following Yezids variant, which details the creation of a reflection-helper. In the beginning the world was an ocean, in the midst of which was a tree created by divine power. God lived in this tree in the form of a bird, for many centuries. After that, the Lord created from his own reflection the Archangel Gabriel, also in the form of a bird, and placed him beside himself on the tree. After a little while he asked him, "Who are you and who am I ?" Gabriel answered, "You are you, and I am I." With this proud answer the arch- angel wished God to understand that each of them had a special importance and that he, Gabriel, could consider himself the peer of his creator. When the Lord heard Gab- riel's answer he became angry and pecked the archangel and drove him from the tree. 46 The two birds and the tree in the midst of the ocean are traits which also appear in the California Yokuts version of the myth. The Yokuts tell that these birds became weary of solitude; in the Yezids variant, something of the same atmosphere can be found, e. g., "for many centuries.... " In a Russian version the two birds are a white and a black duck; the black duck which is the devil, brings earth, and the white duck then forms the earth. 47 The variant is interesting not only because there are two birds, but be- cause these birds are described in color terms: in the be- ginning, there were the "black and white" elements of the world. All the East European and Northern Asian variants</page><page sequence="10">160 Ethnohistory show this strong and seemingly Christian dualism. The name of the earth diver is Satan, or Satanail, even when he appears as a bird. Mikhailo Dragomanov, Ukrainian academician who wrote a distinguished study of dualistic creation myths, gives interesting variants which represent the early ornithomorphic persons as Christianized; these tales are transcripts of an apocryphal text titled, 'About the Tiberian Sea." In the beginning, according to this text, there was no heaven or earth, but only a Tiberian sea with no shores to it in which the Lord and a goldeneye were swimming. The goldeneye was Satanail, and the text tells how the Lord asked him, "Who are you?" "I am (a) God." "And who am I ? "Thou art God of God(s)." God said again: "Whence art you ?" The bird answered, 'Ego ex infimis." And the Lord said, 'And whence am I?" The bird answered, 'De superis." And the Lord said, 'Da mihi ex infimis." And the bird dived into the sea .... 48 In this text the dualism does not appear very distinctly, but it is emphasized in numerous variants. These latter tell how the devil saved a bit of earth in his mouth; when God expanded the earth, the stolen bit grew in the mouth of the devil and, as he spat it out, mountains formed.49 The devil not only helped God, but also spoiled his creation. A Finnish variant, typically enough, describes how the devil caused the uneven formations on the earth, spitting his mouthful of earth toward the significant direction of north.</page><page sequence="11">Earth-Diver 161 In the beginning when the earth did not exist, God was on a golden pillar in the middle of the sea. As he saw his image there, he said, 'Arise what- ever you are!' He arose, and it was the devil. Then God asked: 'How could the earth come into being?' The devil said, 'It will come, if one dives for earth into the bottom of the sea, three times.' God asked him to dive, and the devil did so, but on the third time, stole a little earth and hid it in his mouth. Then, God moulded that bit of earth with his hands, and the earth grew. And the earth in the mouth of the devil grew, and, at the same time, his pain grew. He came to tell God that he stole earth, and it caused pain. Well, God then took the earth from the mouth of the devil, and threw it to the North; it became stones and rocks. 50 The following Bulgarian variant represents the Christian- ized type of the myth rather well. At first there was no earth and people. Every- where was water. There were only the Lord and the devil, who at that time lived together. Once the Lord said to the devil: ' Let us make the earth and people.' 'Let us do so,' answered the devil, 'but where shall we get dirt?' 'There is dirt under the water,' said the Lord. 'Go down and get some.' 'All right,' answered the devil. 'But before you go down,' said the Lord to the devil, 'Say: With God's power and mine ! Then you will reach the bottom and find dirt.' The devil went down, but he did not say first, 'With God's power and mine!' but: 'With my pow- er and God's power.' Therefore he did not reach bot- tom. The second time he did the same and again he did not reach bottom. Finally the third time he said, 'With God's power and mine !' And then he reached bottom and with his nails he grasped a little dirt. That dirt the Lord put on the water and it be- came a little earth.</page><page sequence="12">162 Ethnohistory When the devil saw that, he thought up this piece of deceit: he proposed that they sleep; then, when the Lord had fallen asleep, he would push him into the water, and thus he (the devil) would be left alone, and he could take credit for having made the earth. The Lord knew this, but he lay down and pretended to sleep. Then the devil gets up, takes the Lord in his hands, and starts for the water, to throw him in. He walks towards the water, but the earth grows. As he did not reach the water, he turned in the other direction, but again he did not reach the water. Then he turned in the third direc- tion and when he again did not reach the water, he put the Lord down and lay down also. When he had slept a bit, it occurred to him that there was still a fourth direction. He picked up the Lord and car- ried him toward the water, but still he could not reach it. Then the devil rouses the Lord, 'Get up, Lord, let us bless the earth! Look how it has grown while we were sleeping!' 'When you were carrying me in all four direc- tions, to throw me into the water, and made a cross with me, I blessed the earth,' said the Lord. The devil got mad at this, left the Lord and ran away from him. 51 To summarize briefly, the Earth-Diver of Eurasia is rather Christianized: God and the devil tend to be substi- tuted for the two animals, or, more often, for the culture hero-creator and his helper-animal. This, of course, changes the whole atmosphere of the myth: quarrels between God and the devil take place; all kinds of harm is done by the devil, who wants to have a portion of the earth, or credit for having created it. In this connection, it may be said that an entire East-European and Asiatic myth cycle involv- ing the creation of certain members of the animal kingdom, develops from the Eurasiatic version of Earth-Diver. S2 The Distribution of the Myth. The area of dissemina- tion of Earth-Diver in Eurasia is, again, a very wide one:</page><page sequence="13">Earth- Diver 163 Baltic, Slavic, and Finno-Ugric peoples tell similar versions of Earth-Diver, and Tatars, Yakuts, and other Asian peoples share the conception with them. The primeval sea, however, is a more wide- spread motif than diving for earth; in Hebrew and in Egyptian tradition, for example, we have the water, but no diving. 53 The same is true in Indian tradition: the earth has sunk down, and must be brought up. This is not earth-diving in quite the same sense as in the American and Eurasian myths already discussed. Dragomanov was concerned with the relationship between the versions of various nationality groups within the Eurasian area. He wrote: Such similarities of many Russian variants - Great Russian and Ukrainian - with the Finno- Turkic, raise the question all the more: Who took the tale from whom - the Russians from the 'abo- riginals' or vice versa? The notion of the demi- urges, or at least one of them, in the form of a bird, speaks rather in favor of the opinion that the tale has been carried from the aboriginals rather than the reverse. Had the reverse been the case, the variants of the tale should have moved from southwest to northeast, from Ukrainia to Siberia. But the Ukrainian as well as the White-Russian variants are completely anthropomorphic, whereas almost all the aboriginal variants are ornithomor- phic; while the Great-Russian occupy an inter- mediate position between them. It is more natural to allow that the character of the mythology has been heightened, rather than that it has fallen, as the variants passed from one people to another. 54 It may be questioned whether Dragomanov's problem - the interrelationship of the Finnish, Turkic, and Slavic var- iants - is solvable, but he pointed out a useful criterion: the occurrence of ornithomorphic and anthropomorphic divers. He drew, so it seems, a correct distinction between</page><page sequence="14">164 Ethnohistory the primary appearance of the bird-divers, and the effects of the 'heightening" influence of book-religions. Discussion Alexander Veselovski, a Russian scholar who wrote two studies of the dualistic myths, was aware of Earth- Diver's American variants, although his main concern was with the distribution and origin of Eurasiatic versions. 55 He shared the opinion of the Finnish folklorist Julius Krohn that the base of these stories had been elaborated by the Finno-Magyar or Ural-Altaic tribes; 56 he also admitted that Gnosticism had influenced "these Finnic legends" as they traveled toward the Slavs. He saw some similarity between North American Indian and Slavic legends, but was not inclined to see any primary connection between them. 57 Following Veselovski, Dragomanov definitely stated: 'these traditions must be placed in the category of completely in- dependent tales." 58 Dragomanov had a thorough knowledge of the medieval Gnostic sects. We can say that he proved the thesis that the 'Christian" character of the tales is due to the influence of these sects, which, in their turn, were modified by Irano- Chaldean religions. 59 His thesis was then accepted by Oskar Dihnhardt, who compiled an outstanding collection of the variants. 60 We must here stress the point that the in- fluence of the book religions is a secondary development and has nothing to do with the original myth, however obvious such influence is in the late recordings. The American anthropologist Robert H. Lowie was con- cerned with the probable genetic connection of the North American and Eurasian variants and noted that if they really were variants of the same myth, the distribution of this</page><page sequence="15">Earth- Diver 165 myth would be enormous. He treated Earth-Diver as part of the deluge story. 61 Walter Anderson, the Estonian folklorist, showed that the deluge was secondary and primeval water original. 62 Uno Harva, who thoroughly discussed a great number of the variants, saw the connection between the American and Eurasian myths, but doubted the dualistic character of the latter; he posed the question whether it could be possible that the medieval Bogomil creation story had traveled so far. Independently, Harva suggested that the devil was a late substitution for the original bird. 63 In the 1920's and 1930's several studies relating to Earth-Diver were published. The American anthropologist Gladys Reichard summarized the North American Indian variants of the myth in 1923; 64 a doctoral thesis was written in California; 65 and two European scholars dealt with the theme from the non-American point of view. 66 Count's thesis emphasizes the intercontinental connections of the myths. He was not the first to do so; Schmidt had listed similar traits in Algonkian and Yurak Samoyed myths. 67 One could say that all these scholars attempted to develop a synthesis of the history and distribution of the myth. How difficult this task is, is indicated in a statement of Count's in 1952: I have assembled from the literature about 230 specimens of the tale. Their scrutiny quickly broadens into a far greater study, one of a com- parative mythology as yet scarcely touched. This study awaits the combined efforts of a host of scholars who would view the mythological systems of northern Eurasia and of North America simul- taneously and comprehensively, noting the simi- larities and differences of total pattern, and relate the mythopoea to the social processes and religious and political evolution of the peoples of these two</page><page sequence="16">166 Ethnohistory continents. This study would work from the hypoth- esis that mythology is the cultural philosophy of the folk, expressed symbolically and pragmatically, and therefore it is an integral part of their culture. 68 The last of these thoughts - that mythology is a cultur- al philosophy - is highly debatable, but I agree that myths are an integral part of a culture. I would express the thought in a slightly different way: studying Earth-Diver we learn how myths, when they are accepted, become integrated and modified according to conceptions which already exist, or, later, according to changes which are introduced by other religious systems. Conclusions The Earth-Diver myth has a world-wide distribution. It is told in various forms, but it always has four invariable traits - earth covered with water, the creator, the diver, and the making of the earth. Wherever it occurs, the myth has been acculturated; the creator is God for the Christianized peoples, Manibozho for the Algonquians, Doh, the great shaman for the Ostyaks. Such variation holds in regard to all of the traits; to discuss the variations would be an historical-geographical problem. At present, however, I am concerned with another kind of problem. In the Yezids variant, 'the Lord created from his own reflection the Archangel Gabriel, also in the form of a bird." In the Finnish variants the Earth-Diver, that is the devil, has his origin in the reflected image of God on the water. 69 All over the area of dissemination the earth-diver appears either as an animal, or as having formerly been an animal: there is, for example, a clear development</page><page sequence="17">Earth-Diver 167 from a bird to bird-Satanail, and finally to Satan, the devil. Let us forget the reflection-helper for a while, and think of the animal as the constant factor. Which animal then - the muskrat, the turtle, the duck? The duck is mentioned all over the area where the myth is known. I would like to suggest an interpretation, which has not appeared in the many studies of the Earth-Diver myth. First we have the creator, alone. Then we have the creator and a bird or some other being who is with him, or whom he summons to help him when he sees his image in the water. What does this indicate? There is an old and wide-spread notion of something which is with a person even when he is alone. This some- thing is the soul, or spirit. The soul can take the form of an animal, mostly the form of a bird; actually the term "bird soul," Seelenvogel, is the terminus technicus for the wandering soul in folklore literature. The distribution of this concept is widespread; 70 it is especially prevalent in the Arctic area where shamanistic practice presupposes the concept - where the shaman sends his soul away to fulfil difficult tasks. As the German scholar Ad. E. Jensen states, wherever shamanistic practice is found, it is in connection with this dualistic world-concept, as a part of the characteristic capacities of the shaman, that his soul is able to leave his body. 71 The bird soul, for example, can move independently of the owner's body, fulfil tasks which are not possible for the person himself, wander over seas, and visit the other world. Could we not think that the helpful animal in the Earth-Diver is the bird soul of the creator? In shamanistic terms, the</page><page sequence="18">168 Ethnohi story soul is the helping- spirit. In the Earth-Diver myth the cre- ator needs earth: he sends his spirit helper to fulfil the dif- ficult task. The variations in form of the spirit-helper are numerous: the diver appears in many shapes, and there are even several divers in a single variant. This, naturally, is not in accord with my explanation, but the important point is that there are variants which do accord with it, and that these variants were collected in different parts of the whole area of distribution. We cannot expect that the original meaning of the myth sur- vived the changes it suffered when traveling from one culture to another. A myth is a narrative, and the Earth-Diver myth has had the common history of a narrative, undergoing change after change. Scholars have stressed the fact that religious dualism is not original in the myth. I agree with this, for good reason: the dualistic 'disguise" is a late development, with roots in medieval Christian doctrines, as Dragomanov and others have shown. I suggest another kind of dualism for the inter- pretation of Earth-Diver: psycho-physical dualism, the con- cept of the soul being separable from the body. The notion that the helper was originally the reflection of the creator on the water is an additional proof of such a dualism; also the reflected image is a form of the soul. 72 That is why it is believed that a person can lose his soul looking in a mirror, or into water. Thus, when the first being on primeval water saw his image and summoned it to help, he "became aware of himself," as one variant beauti- fully states. A very familiar parallel illustrates my interpretation. We all remember the beginning of the creation story of the Bible: the spirit of God moved upon the primeval water. I</page><page sequence="19">Earth- Diver 169 do not mean to suggest genetic identity, but I cannot help seeing a similar notion in the Earth-Diver myth. The helper of the creator was not the Devil; it was not any occasional animal, but a very definite kind of animal - "the spirit of the god," the soul of the creator. Notes 1.
