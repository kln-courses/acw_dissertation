<plain_text><page sequence="1">ASH'ARI AND THE ASH'ARITES IN ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS HISTORY II THE PROBLEM OF ASH'ARi Ash'arl poses a problem as author of a work entitled Istihsdn al-khaud fT 'ilm al-kalam. This work was published in Haidarabad in 1323/1905-6. Goldziher does not mention it in his Vorlesungen of 1910, nor in the French translation of this work reviewed by him and published in 1920 (1). In any case, Goldizher's position is that the Ibana represents the last definitive exposition of Ash'arl's doctrine (2). Two years after the publication of Goldziher's Vorlesungen, M. Horten published a German translation of an extract of Isfihsan al-khaui as an appropriate piece of literature in favor of speculative theology with which to conclude his work Die philosophischen Sysieme der spekulativen Theologen im Islam (3). Twenty years later, as we have already seen, the question (1) Nor is it in the edition revised by Franz Babinger and published in 1925.

McCarthy who does not agree with Goldziher, pointing out that he gives no reason for calling it K the last , see Theology, 231. Perhaps Goldziher's reason was derived from, or at least supported by, that of Muhammad b. al-Mausill, who is cited as having made a statement to this effect in his Saif al-sunna.

For Wensinck, Ash'arI's rationalism as described by JuwainI was supported by the certain fact that Ash'arl had adopted kaldm as a method. The certainty of this fact, as far as Wensinck was concerned, was demonstrated by Ash'arI's work Islihsan al-khaud (1). Wensinck could not answer the question as to what Ash'arl's role really was as far as Ash'arism was concerned. Was Ash'arl the tradition- alist of the Ibdna and of the Maqaldt who later elaborated such Ash'arite doctrines as those of kasb and tanzTh? Wensinck felt that the answer to such a question and a clearer distinction between Ash'arl and the Ash'arite school would perhaps have to wait until other works by Ash'arl were found (2). At the present time, there are two different attitudes on Wensinck's suggestion. One is that of impatience. It con- siders Wensinck's question as to a two-faced position of Ash'arI as typical of an attitude held by the Western scholar of the last century who has tended to be out of sympathy with Ash'arl. According to this view, there is no longer any reason to cast doubt on Ash'arl, what with the increasing number of his works which have come to light; the attitude to adopt should be one of sympathy (8). The other attitude is one in line with Wensinck's suggestion for new sources, in the hope of solving some of the great problems of Muslim theology (4). (1) A. J. Wensinck, Muslim Creed, 93 (a That he (Ash'arl) adopted kaldm as a method is certain. D), and n. 2 (, Cf. his Risala fl 'stihsan al-Khawd fl 'l-Kalam. '). (2) Op. cit., 94. (3) See W. M. Watt, Free Will, 135. (4) See J. Schacht, a New Sources , in Studia Islamica, I, 23 if. From a study of the Kitab al-Luma', Joseph Schacht sees the forerunners of Ash'arI as a group of men who employed a speculative method of reasoning, while sharing many of the opinions of the Traditionalists. These, he said, were a kind of c orthodox Mu'tazila D. These a must have been the forerunners and even the true founders of that scholastic school of theology which we know as the Ash'arite school. Ash'arI himself counts for little in this; he was chosen as the eponym at a later date, when the school needed some one of recognized orthodoxy in order to repel the attacks of the extreme Traditionalists. And what better name could they find than that of a good Traditionalist who had himself admitted the legitimacy of reasoning in theology ? D Schacht is alluding here, I believe, to the Istihsan al- khaui attributed to Ash'arl. 20</page><page sequence="3">ASH'ARi AND THE ASH'ARITES 21 As for the Islihsdn al-khaud it has held its ground as a work by Ash'arl since its appearance. Since M. Horten (1) and A. J. Wensinck (2), who called our attention to this work as proof of Ash'ari's endorsement of kaldm, there has been a ten- dency to minimize his traditionalism. Thus doubt has been cast on Ash'ari's authorship of the Ibdna (3); whereas no reason could be seen to doubt Ash'ari's rationalism as evidenced in his authorship of Istihsdn al-khaud or the Luma' (4). However, it will always be necessary to establish the authorship of a text, especially one attributed to Ash'arl, in view of the doubt which has been cast on his role in Ash'arism as it came to be known since Baqillanl. Admittedly, it is not a simple task to establish the authorship of a work in the case of so controversial an author as Ash'arl. Perhaps we shall never be able to achieve certainty Goldziher does not consider the Islihsdn when he makes of Ash'arI a thorough going Traditionalist. Wensinck sees in it the proof, along with JuwainI's des- cription, of Ash'arI's rationalism, which, when considered with his traditionalism based on his Ibdna, gives us two faces for one man. Schacht reconciles both views by seeing in Ash'arI ( a good Traditionalist who had himself admitted the legitimacy of reasoning in theology D (p. 34). What the Luma' contains of untra- ditionalist doctrines are not necessarily his own but rather those of the (I orthodox Mu'tazila , (cf. p. 33). The doctrine of tanzih is a variant of the Mu'tazilite inter- pretation by metaphor (p. 34). In other words, Schacht accepts Ash'arI's authorship of the rationalistic Risdla and reconciles it with Ash'arI's traditiona- lism. We thus emerge with two new views : Mu'tazilites with traditionalist ten- dencies, and Ash'arl with a rationalist tendency. - Father Richard J. McCarthy has published the full text of Kitdb al-Luma', which is attributed to Ash'arI, in The Theology of Ash'arl, in which he also gives a very good outline of Ibn 'Asakir's Tabyin and a reprint of the text of Istihsdn al-khaud with his English translation of that work. (1) See Die philosophischen Systeme der spekulativen Theologen im Islam, 622 ff., where Horten finds that in concluding this work on speculative theologians in Islam, he could do no better than quote Ash'arI's treatise in vindication of kaldm (i. e., Istihsdn al-khaud) which he accepts as Ash'arI's without questioning the authenticity of authorship. (2) Wensinck, like Horten before him, did not raise the question of authorship regarding Istihsdn al-khaud; he simply accepted it as Ash'arI's work, and used it as proof of Ash'arI's adoption of ( kaldm as a method ,; see Wensinck, Muslim Creed, 93 and n. 2. (3) See Theology, 232. (4) Op. cit., p. xxvI and p. xxv, respectively.</page><page sequence="4">GEORGE MAKDISI in the matter of each of his works. But the task is no less necessary for being difficult or for appearing hopeless. What must be avoided are the two extremes of textual criticism: credulity and hypercriticism. In the case of a work attributed to Ash'arT, there are, to my mind, reasonable objections which can and should be made. As an out and out traditionalist of his day, Ash'arl could well have written the Ibana. But he could not have written Islihsdn al-khaud fi 'ilm al-kalam - he could not have done so and remained a traditionalist. The latter work could be attributed to Ash'arl if we assume a change in his thinking. Thus as a traditionalist he could have written the Ibdna; and as a rationalist, the Islihsdn. Ash'arite propagandists have presented us with an Ash'ari who was first a thorough-going rationalist, who then became a thorough-going traditionalist, and who finally became a tradi- tionalist keeping the rationalist method by adopting kaldm. Now Ash'arl could have been a rationalist, who then became a traditionalist. Or a traditionalist, and later a rationalist. But he could not have been both at one and the same time. There is nothing inconsistent in an Ash'art who was a tradi- tionalist using reason in defense of orthodoxy. There would definitely be something inconsistent in an Ash'arl who was a traditionalist using kaldm in defense of orthodoxy. For between reason and rationalist kaldm there was a difference. It was all the difference between Muslim traditionalism and Muslim rationalism. The traditionalists made use of reason in order to understand what they considered as the legitimate sources of theology: scripture and tradition. What they could not understand they left as it stood in the sources; they did not make use of reason to interpret the sources metaphorically. On the other hand, the rationalists advocated the use of reason on scripture and tradition; and all that they deemed to contra- dict the dictates of reason they interpreted metaphorically in order to bring it into harmony with reason. Now the position of Ash'arI is difficult to understand, since he is presented as a traditionalist who used kaldm. Any traditionalist theologian among his contemporaries would have 22</page><page sequence="5">ASH ARI AND THE ASH'ARITES seen the inconsistency in such a position. The theologian who wrote the Ibdna could not have written Istihsdn al-khaud and claim allegiance to both lines of thought at one and the same time. For the latter work is a refutation of all that for which the former stands. The authenticity of Islihsdn al-khaud as a work by Ash'arl (d. 324 H.) is, to say the least, open to doubt. The Ash'arites themselves, for centuries after Ash'arl, do not seem to know of it. Neither Ibn 'Asakir (d. 571), nor Subki (d. 771) make any mention of it. It is not in the list of Ash'ari's works, either according to his own list as we know it through Ibn 'Asakir and Ibn Fuirak (d. 406), or in their respective supple- mentary lists (1). It may be assumed that were such a work as Islihsdn al-khaud known to be that of Ash'arl, the Ash'arite propagandists would have lost no time in mentioning it, in order to prove their point that the ((traditionalist)) Ash'art really and truly advocated the use of kalam. But if one should suppose that for some reason unknown to us today, the Ash'arites of that time knew of the work but did not mention it because it would have been in some way inimical to their cause, then one would expect that the enemies of Ash'arism would have broadcast it themselves. But the anti-Ash'arites seem to be as unaware of the work as the Ash'arites. The celebrated Hanbalite Ibn Taimlya who, no less than Ash'arite Subkl, is a mine of information on the development of Muslim theology, does not seem to know of this particular work. There are other reasons to doubt Ash'ari's authorship of this work. Islihsdn al-khaud is a treatise in defense of kaldm. It is highly vindictive in character. It is in answer to objections raised by the censurers of kaldm. It is posterior in date to the censure of kaldm. It is also posterior to other pro-kalam literature. The development of literature in defense of kaldm as we know it today through its best specimens appears to have followed a gradual evolution. Its character is, at first, calm and conciliatory, as in Ibn 'Asskir's Taby(n. With (1) See Tabyin, 128 ff.; Spitta, op. cit., 63 ff.; Theology, 211 ff. 23</page><page sequence="6">GEORGE MAKDISI Subki's Tabaqdt it is still conciliatory but fraught with a definite sense of urgency. In Istihsdn al-khaud the conciliatory tone has given way to one of vindictiveness. Nowhere does this vindictiveness show itself so clearly as in the very title of the treatise: Isli.hsdn al-khaud ft 'ilm al-kalam. This title makes use of a very familiar medieval phrase; a phrase which was used by both camps, the traditionalists as well as the rationalists, those who censured as well as those who defended, kaldm. The traditionalists spoke of al-khaud fi 'ilm al-kaldm, ((plunging into the science of kaldm ,, as some- thing to be avoided. The rationalists spoke of it as something to be avoided, unless called for by necessity. Both camps agreed that it was something to be avoided. But the title of the treatise advocates, as something to be esteemed (istihsdn), this very thing which should be avoided. Traditionalists felt strongly that kalam should be avoided at all costs because, in plunging, one risked being submerged. The rationalists agreed that the risk was there, tried to demonstrate the need for plunging nevertheless, and tried to allay fears by stating that it should be restricted to those who were endowed with the requisite strength and acumen to over- come the submerging treacherous currents and keep their heads above water. But the message of Istihsan al-khaud does not recognize any such risk or any need whatever for precautions. The message has no place in it allotted to reasonableness and compromise. It is rather impatiently vindictive and arrogant. (Plunging ) was not something to be approached cautiously, as with Ibn 'Asakir and SubkI. Much less was it something to be avoided, as with the traditionalists. On the contrary, it was something to be ((esteemed as good ) (istihsdn). And the text of the treatise endorses kaldm outright and unconditionally. There are still other reasons to doubt Ash'arl's authorship of the Istihsan. Not merely because its chain of transmitters (isndd) which claims to go all the way back to Ash'arI, has a lacuna in it. This lacuna could be attributed to the neglect of some copyist. More serious doubt arises from the anti- kaldm arguments which the treatise is intent upon refuting. 24</page><page sequence="7">ASH'ARi AND THE ASH ARITES 25 These arguments have a date in the history of anti-kaldm literature. Take, for instance, the arguments contained in paragraph 3. Here, the traditionalists argue that if kaldm were a necessary guide, the Prophet, his lieutenants and his compa- nions after him would have discussed the matter. They argued that the Prophet, before dying, had not left unsaid any neces- sary matters of religion. It is these arguments of the traditio- nalist which the treatise intends to refute. The doubt concer- ning its authorship by Ash'ari arises from the fact that these traditionalist arguments were, in their turn, a refutation of an Ash'arite argument. Ibn 'Asakir (d. 571), as already mentioned, argues in favor of kaldm on the basis of necessity. Ibn Qudama (d. 620) and Ibn Taimlya (d. 728) answer this argument of necessity by stating (1) that, had kalam been necessary, the Prophet himself would have made use of it (1) and by stating (2) that the Prophet had died leaving behind him a perfect religion; he died after having made a clear exposition of the whole field of religion, its fundamental principles as well as its practical applications. This last statement is, lite- rally speaking, the title of one of Ibn Taimiya's anti-kaldm works () ; and it is, literally speaking, one of the arguments the Istihsan sets out to refute (8). Moreover, as can be seen in paragraph 4 of Istihsan (4), its author was perfectly aware that ((plunging )) was something the traditionalists believed should be avoided. Here, the argu- ment of the traditionalists is that the Prophet and his compa- nions avoided ((plunging)) into kaldm; that if kaldm were truly a part of religion (din), they could not have abstained from speaking of it ) (6). It is from this paragraph, the only place (1) Cf. G. Makdisi, Ibn Qudama's Censure of Speculative Theology (in press).

And here, as in the title, appears the contempt of the rationalist for those who fear ( plunging ). Furthermore, the treatise insists upon a certain fundamental aspect of kalam which our major apologists for Ash'arism passed over in silence when endeavoring to make it palatable to tra- ditionalists. Nowhere in Ibn 'Asakir's Tabyin or in Subk's Tabaqdl do we find these two apologists for Ash'arite kaldm insist upon the positive aspects of kalam, i. e. the philosophical concepts contained therein; for example, motion, rest, body, accident, accidental modes and states, the atom and the leap. To discuss these concepts was considered by the traditionalists, the treatise rightly charges, as heretical innovation. Ibn 'Asakir and Subkl, seeking conciliation, pass over in silence this aspect of Ash'arite kalam. For them, it would have sufficed to get a foot in the doorway by obtaining a conditional acceptance of kalam as a tool with which to defend the orthodox doctrines. On the other hand, such concepts were the primary concern of the Islihsan. What this treatise insists upon is the legitimacy of the positive concepts contained in kalam as the speculative science of theology. The treatise loses no time in coming to this point. This controversial question it raises at the very outset, hard upon the heels of a brief introduction (1). From all the foregoing, it would appear to us that Ash'ari's authorship of Istihsan al-khaud is, to say the least, subject to doubt. In order to attribute it to Ash'arl, we would at least have to remove all that which would make it anachronistic, including its title. But should this be done, very little of the treatise, if any, would remain. Ash'ar['s Maqalat It may rightly be argued that such philosophical concepts as the Islihsain mentions are contained in Ash'arT's Maqalat al- (1) Op. cit., 87/120: paragraph 2 of Istihsan. It insists upon this very same quotation once more shortly afterwards; op. cit., 89/122 : paragraph 6. 26</page><page sequence="9">ASH ARi AND THE ASH'ARITES islamtyin, and that consequently there is no reasonable cause to doubt Ash'arl's authorship of the Istihsdn. But the diffe- rence between the two works it that the Maqdala is not advo- cating a study of this science, as in the case of the Islihsan. The Maqalat merely outlines the doctrines of the various groups of theologians concerning these concepts. Nevertheless, it has puzzled us why the ((traditionalist )) Ash'arl of the first volume of the Maqalat should even go into these concepts at all in the second volume of the Maqalat unless he had in mind to refute them. And this is what causes us to have some doubts con- cerning the second volume of the Maqalat. Ash'arl, as the author of the Ibdna, would easily write the first volume of the Maqalat; but there could be reasonable doubt concerning the appropriateness of the second volume as part of the same work. At the end of the first volume of the Maqalat, the author states in very definite terms his allegiance to the traditiona- lists (1). This is the same position that Ash'ari takes in the Ibdna. But the second volume of the Maqalat deals with philosophical questions (2) which the traditionalist of the Ibdna or of the first volume of the Maqaldt would not enter into, or if he did, would do so to refute them. But there is not a single word of retort in this whole volume (8). This is what struck us at first upon examining the two volumes of the Maqalat. It appeared doubtful to us that the same author had written both volumes while in the same frame of mind. And this opinion was reinforced by the fact that volume one is completely independent of the second. As a matter of fact, each of the two volumes is complete unto itself. To these internal facts about the work was then added another external fact which reinforced our doubts concerning the second volume. This fact may be found in a note on the title page of one of the manuscript copies of theMaqaldt, Manus- (1) Maqldat, I, 284.

A description of this manuscript is given by the learned editor, H. Ritter, in his introduction to the Maqaldt (1). Here, the manuscript is described as belonging to the sixth century A. H. (twelfth century A. D.), judging from the calligraphy and the paper. A note at the end of the manuscript attests to the completion of Kitab al- maqalad wa'l-ikhtildf. So far, there is no cause for doubt. But the title page carries the following note: (( (This is) volume one of Maqadlt al-islamiyin wa'khtildf al-musalltn, authored by al-Shaikh Abii 'I-Hasan 'Ali b. Isma'Il al-Ash'arl - May God be well pleased with him. The end of this volume is the end of the book )) (2). According to this note, only volume one of this work is to be considered as the integral work of Ash'ari entitled Maqaldt al-islamiyin wa'khtilaf al-musalltn. Volume two is left in a doubtful state. Under this note, another one appears by a different hand: (((This is) one of the books (owned by) the excellent Shaikh Shams al-Din Muhammad, son of the virtuous Shaikh TaqI al- DIn 'Abd al-Karim al-Muqri' al-Shafi'i. ) Below this note are two verses the text of which speaks of the futility of speculative thought. The editor points out that these two verses are quoted by Ibn Khallikan (8) in his biographical notice on Shahrastani (d. 548) (4). ShahrastanI had cited these two verses at the beginning of his work on kaldm, Nihdyat al-iqddm fi 'ilm al-kaldm (6), without mentioning whose verses they were, but that they have been attributed to Ibn al-Sa'igh al-Andalusi (d. 533) (6). Ritter further states that the name in the above (1) See Maqaldt, I, page kd of Ritter's Introduction in Arabic.

The two notes, by different hands, which appear on the title page of the Maqaldt, are related by the fact that they are tra- ditionalist-inspired. The first note is so inspired for attribu- ting only the first volume of the Maqaldt to Ash'arI and divorcing it from the second volume; the second, for the two cited verses which have a pro-traditionalist message (3). The exclusion of the second volume of the Maqalad from forming an integral part of the work preserves Ash'ari from having entered into a discussion of such philosophical concepts as motion, accident, atom, etc., a discussion into which the traditionalist writer of the first volume would be expected to avoid ( plunging )) into, as a matter of principle. None of the five extant manuscripts, as studied by Professor Ritter for his edition of the Maqaldl, was copied before the 6th/12th century. The list of Ash'arl's works as cited in the Fihrist (ca. 377/987) makes no mention of the Maqdlaf (4). The earliest mention of this work appears to be in Ibn 'Asakir's list of Ash'arl's works (5), where Ibn 'Asakir quotes Ash'ari as stating that he wrote ( a book on the doctrines (1) Muhammad, son of 'Abd al-Karim, and the nisba: ash-Shdfi'i.

But both before and after Ibn 'Asakir, the Maqalda has been recognized as Ash'arI's work. The Ash'arite, Abu T?hir al-Baghdadl (d. 429/1037) cites from the first volume of the Maqaldt (2) as well as from the second (8); and it is clear from the references to the Maqald by the Han- balite Ibn Taimiya (d. 728/1328) that his acquaintance with the work includes data which we can find in the two volumes of the Maqaldt (4). Whereas there is no reasonable doubt regarding the author- ship of both volumes of the Maqaldt, it is possible that Ash'ari wrote them as separate works at different periods of his life. Ibn Taimlya cites yet another work entitled Maqalad which he distinguishes from the Maqaldt al-isldmiyin and which deals with the doctrines of the philosophers (faldsifa) (5). It is possible that his latter work is identical with that entitled Kildb jumal al-maqadla in Ibn 'Asakir's list (6). It is also possible that Ash'arl wrote three independent works entitled Maqalal: one dealing with the doctrines of the Muslims in general (vol. I of the edition of Ritter), another dealing with the mulkallimun (vol. II of the edition of Ritter), and a third dealing with the philosophers (the work cited by Ibn Taimlya).

THE PROBLEM OF THE ASH'ARITES The problem is not Ash'arI's alone. It is also that of some of the famous Ash'arites who came after him; namely, Baqil- lani (d. 403), Juwaini (d. 478), Ghazzall (d. 505), ShahrastanI (d. 548) and Razi (d. 606). Nothing perhaps can demonstrate this problem more clearly than the question of the legitimacy of kalam. BaqillanI, Juwainl, ShahrastanI and RazI, all had a death- bed repentance for having used kaldm, if we are to believe their biographers. (If Ghazzall had no such repentance, it is very likely because he made a sufficiently convincing show of opposing kalam throughout his lifetime (1).) In other words, these Ash'arites are shown by these anecdotes to have repeated the experience of Ash'arl. Like Ash'arI, they had begun as rationalists and ended by reverting to that traditionalism which was the legacy left them by their Ancestors. Whatever be the facts concerning the works attributed to Ash'ari, the image of Ash'arl as presented by the Ash'arite propagandists is one which admits of opposites. So also that of the great Ash'arites just mentioned. On the one hand they are presented as partisans of metaphorical interpretation (ta'wtl); and on the other, as partisans of the way of the An- cestors (Salaf), namely, the acknowledgment of all the scrip- tural and traditional data concerning God's attributes without attempting to interpret them for fear of falling into anthro- pomorphism, or of explaining them completely away and thus (1) For Ghazzall's attitude concerning kaldm and his K hatred of it, see Wensinck, Muslim Creed, 97 where Ghazzall is cited in translation (from the Ihyag). 31</page><page sequence="14">GEORGE MAKDISI denuding God of His attributes, or of using tanzth which is an attenuation of the doctrine of denudation. These two views are diametrically opposed. After Ash'arl, the great Ash'arites appear to us, in their works, now as partisans of one view, now as partisans of the other, in diametrical opposition. Such is the case of Baqillanl, in his own Ibana, as seen and cited by the Hanbalite Ibn Taimlya (1). In the case of JuwainI we can be our own witnesses. This famous mutakallim shows himself as a partisan of the way of the Salaf in his Risala NizamiTya (2) and this fact is admitted by SubkI himself, who explains it by pointing out that Ash'arl himself was a partisan of both ways(8). Thus Baqillani and Juwainl, in so far as they adopt the way of the Ancestors, would appear to be against kalam. And this attitude against kaldm carries itself further down the line to a student of JuwainT, GhazzalI, whose fame surpassed that of the master. Ghazz5al's hostile attitude towards kaldm is well-known (4). His work entitled Iljdm al-'awdmm 'an 'ilm al-kaldm (The Reining in of the common people from the science of kalam) was a source of embarrassment to the Ash'arite propagandists who reacted to it in various ways. Ibn 'Asakir tries to conciliate GhazzalI's view by stating that ( reining in the common people )) was exactly what Ash'arl did (6). Subki tries to explain it by pointing out that GhazzalT was not very strong in the field of kalam. He may have written something on usul al-drn, such as Qawd'id al-'aqd'id and 'Aqa'id sughra, ((but as for an independent work according to the method of the (1) See Majmfi'at ar-rasd'il al-kubra (2 vols.; Cairo : Sharaflya Press, 1323/ 1905), I, 459; cf.

By the time we come to Fadall (d. 1236/1821), the attitude towards Ghazzali's hostility against kaldm is itself definitely hostile and clearly shows itself in the title of this Ash'arites's treatise in favor of kaldm: Kifdyat al-'awamm fi 'ilm al-kaldm (The Suffi- ciency of the Common People in the science of kalam). In all three cases, the Ash'arite apologists do not mention Ghazzal's Iljdm itself, though their concern about it and about his refe- rences to Shafi'i in the Ihyd' as prohibiting kaldm is evident and evolves from a desire to be conciliatory to a deep feeling of vindictiveness. When Ghazzali reviews the sayings of the ((Fathers )) regar- ding kaldm, he concludes that they were against the use of this science. This is what GhazzalI understood from his own exa- mination of the Ancestors' sayings. Furthermore, Ghazzali makes it quite clear that Shafi'i himself was against kaldm. It is not until the advent of the great Ash'arite propagandists, such as Ibn 'Asakir and Subkl, that these sayings are re-inter- preted systematically in one of two ways. On the one hand, to show that if the Ancestors were against kaldm, what they were really against was the kaldm of the heretics; and on the other, to show that kaldm is admittedly dangerous, but defi- nitely necessary, and consequently calls for caution in its use when needed, at which time only the experts should handle it. In the period of time between GhazzalI (d. 505) and Ibn 'Asakir (d. 571), kaldm did not fare too well in the Shafi'ite school of law. Two Shafi'ites are known to have attacked kaldm outright. One of these was Karajl (d. 532) who did so in a famous and controversial poem; another is BustI (d. 388) (1) Notice here that Subkl wants to make very clear his meaning of the term kaldm, a according to the method of the kalam-experts ?, the real kaldm, in other words, not that of the Ancestors, practised by GhazzalI. This is one of the rare instances where Subkl does not want his terms to be vague. SubkI is, in effect, saying that GhazzalI is no mulakallim; one cannot expect him to speak for kalam as one of its own advocates.

Subkl objects to KarajI's poem suspecting forgery (1) but condemning the author whoever he may be (2). As for Busti's work against kalam and those who advocate it, Subkl cites the work and makes no comment (8). CONCLUSION There is a thread which runs conspicuously through the warp and woof of Ash'arite polemic and history. This two-way thread in Ash'arism's fabric is nowhere so conspicuous as in Subki's Tabaqdt. None other than Subkl has been able to weave so masterfully that design of Ash'arism which, on closer view, shows Ash'ari and the Ash'arites going in two different directions. When Subkl pleaded his case for Ash'arism to the Shafi'ite school of law he used as his cardinal principle a legal doctrine. It was a legitimate legal doctrine, accepted by the schools of law; namely, the doctrine of the double legal truth. And this is how it worked in law. An imam, such as Shafi'T or Ibn Hanbal, is quoted by some of his followers as in favor of a legal opinion concerning a point of law. He is also quoted by others among his followers as in favor of another legal opinion concerning the same point. As there is no possibility of knowing which legal opinion supersedes the other, both opinions are accepted as legally valid. One then has a choice of fol- lowing one of these two legal opinions. When a lawyer refers to one or the other of these two opinions, he quotes his autho- rity; for instance, Shafi'i's legal opinion according to such and such a report (riwdya) from Shafi'T, upholding such and such a course, or opinion. Some books were written with a view to collecting all such points of law concerning which there were two variant opinions, either of which could be followed (4). (1) Tabaqdt, IV, 82 (line 22) ff.

He admits, as we have seen, the existence of the anti-kalam traditions attributed to Shafi'i, but counters that other tradi- tions are also related on Shafi'I's authority which give evidence of the contrary opinion. Now the question as to which of the two opinions one must adopt is left to the individual discretion of the jurisconsult who arrives at a decision in favour of the one or the other on the basis of another legal principle, namely, ijlihdd; that is to say, on the basis of a personal opinion arrived at after he has exerted himself in the study of the sources of law in order to form a legal opinion. It is on the basis of ijlihdd that Subkl explains not only how Ash'ari had two views (wajh; incidentally wajh also means face) to his theology, but also how the celebrated Juwaini could have been a mulakallim and then change to a traditio- nalist after a death-bed repentence for having indulged in a life-long practice of kaldm. Subki attempts to take the edge off traditionalist polemics by declaring this change of heart as a perfectly normal thing. What Subki is saying is that Ash'arism has two faces; and an Ash'arite is no less Ash'arite for having the one or the other. It is simply a matter of ijlihad (1). This principle of the double legal truth with which Subki tried to conciliate the kalam-using Ash'ari with the Ash'ari of unadulterated traditionalism, explaining these two wajhs of Ash'ari as a matter of ijlihdd, did not meet with success among the Shafi'ite traditionalist lawyers. They understood the principle of ijlihdd perfectly well; but they applied it strictly and solely to matters of law. Where dogmatic theology was concerned, ijlihdd had no place - so far as they were concerned. wa'l-wajhain (The Book of the two Reports and the two Ways). This work was later supplemented by his son Ibn AbI Ya'la (d. 526). Ibn Aql's (d. 513) KiUab al-ishara is an abridgment of the original work of the father. See Ibn Rajab, Dhail, I, 189 and 212. (1) Tabaqat, III, 264 (line 1). 35</page><page sequence="18">GEORGE MAKDISI This is, in the final analysis, the main reason for the failure of Ash'arism to attract the traditionalists. After Subki, Ash'arism became more and more rationalist, less and less con- ciliatory. It had failed to obtain its legitimacy, and had given up the struggle to infiltrate the schools of law. The case of Ash'arism's failure in theology is reminiscent of the case of Zahirism's failure in law. Ash'arism's case was that of Zahirism in reverse. Zahirism failed as a school of law because of its failure to include among its sources of jurisprudence, a rational element (the principle of analogy, qiyds), following the example of the other four sunnite schools of law. Ash'arism failed as a school of theology because of its failure to exclude from its sources of theology, a rational ele- ment (the principle of metaphorical interpretation, ta'wfl), following the example of the traditionalists who constituted the majority membership of all the sunnite schools of law. Here, then, we find both Zahirism and Ash'arism without full membership in the orthodoxy of the sunnite schools of law. Both had missed the mark of orthodoxy: one by falling short of it; the other, by exceediAg it. And though they shared a common experience of failure, the one was the arch enemy of the other, for their principles were diametrically opposed to one another. Ash'arism and Zahirism failed as systems; one as a system of theology, the other as a system of law. This failure did not entail the failure of each of their members as orthodox. An Ash'arite was still orthodox by virtue of his membership in one of the schools of law, the Shafi'ite school, for instance. A Zahirite was still orthodox by virtue of his membership in the traditionalist system of theology. A Mu'tazilite, whose system of theology had failed to gain legitimacy, was still orthodox by virtue of his membership in one of the sunnite schools of law, the Hanafite, for instance. A Zahirite could still, by virtue of his orthodoxy through membership in tradi- tionalist theology, condemn both Mu'tazilism and Ash'arism as heretical. This is exactly what the Zahirite Ibn Hazm did. The rule of the majority as expressed by the general con- sensus of the Muslims had denied legitimacy to juridical Zahi- 36</page><page sequence="19">ASH ARI AND THE ASH'ARITES rism and theological Ash'arism. Sunnite consensus accepted the rational element in law, against Zahirism, and rejected it in theology, against Ash'arism. To sum up: the place of Ash'arism in the historical develop- ment of Muslim theology has been allotted an exaggerated importance. Whenever this happens in the writing of history, something else is sure to suffer in the process. And the loss, in the final analysis, is our own. The place of traditionalism in the history of Muslim religious thought has been minimized, and its importance overlooked. This misjudgment arises from our ignorance concerning the Ash'arite family, as well as the traditionalist family. We saw in the Hanbalites what the Ash'arites wanted us to see: a small group of backwater theo- logians, pitifully pitted against the much more numerous and more progressive Shafi'ites, whom we believed to be allied to the Ash'arites. What we failed to see was that the Ash'arites were opposed by the Shafi'ites themselves. If the Shafi'ites were not as vocal against Ash'arism as the Hanbalites, it was because of their peculiar situation: the majority of the Ash'arites whom they opposed theologically were members of their own school of law. If the Hanbalites were more vocal, in fact the most vocal group among the traditionalists, it was because their members were not involved: they were tradi- tionalists through and through, as well as a recognized sunnite school of law. We have taken it for granted that the Shafi'ite school of law formed the shielding armour of Ash'arism; when, in reality, the majority of Shafi'ites regarded Ash'arism as a parasite, and were hard at work ridding themselves of it. Furthermore, we have been misled by Ash'arite sources into thinking that the enemies of Ash'arism were, on the one hand, Mu'tazilism, the ultrarationalists who divested God of His attributes; and, on the other hand, Hanbalism, the ultra- conservatives, who were plagued by crass anthropomorphism. This picture was calculated to convince its viewers that Ash'a- rism was the middleroad orthodoxy. And so we dutifully 37</page><page sequence="20">GEORGE MAKDISI became convinced not only of this, but of more, by force of implication. We became convinced that these enemies of Ash'arism were also the enemies of the Shafi'ite school of law. This took us a long way away from seeing that the great upheaval between Ash'arism and traditionalism was taking place within the Shdfi'ite school itself. The majority of the Shafi'ites, who were not Ash'arites, harbored no hatred for Hanbalism. On the contrary, it was with Hanbalites, not with Ash'arites, that the Shafi'ites were in alliance, together with all the other tra- ditionalists, against their common enemy: Ash'arism.' The alliance was not a new one; it had been in existence since the days of Mu'tazilism. The Ash'arism we have known, i. e. rationalist Ash'arism (not the Ash'arism of Ash'arI's Ibana, which is purely tradi- tionalist), was not the main current in Muslim theological thought. It was, and is, one current among others. The main current should be sought for in a different direction; in the direction of traditionalism. The study of the Ash'arite movement is difficult because it is a movement fraught with unsolved questions. It develops under a highly dubious designation. Its greatest thinkers are known for their death-bed repentence and their return to the traditionalist credo of the Ancestors. Whether or not these anecdotes are historically sound, the Ash'arite propagandists themselves treated them as though they were, and explained them as examples of the traditionalist side of Ash'arism. It may very well be that these anecdotes were concoctions put together by anti-Ash'arite traditionalists who presented them as answers to, and variations on, the Ash'arite theme of Ash'arl's re-conversion to kaldm, after he had been converted from it and from Mu'tazilism. Yet, in spite of all our preoccupation with Ash'arism, a comprehensive study of this movement is still lacking. Perhaps the reason for this is that we have been off-track. The sources examined here briefly have, so to speak, derailed us and we have consequently not been able to make real progress. A serious obstacle towards a comprehensive study and apprecia- tion of this movement is the lack of monographs on each of 38</page><page sequence="21">ASH ARi AND THE ASH ARITES the great theologians and jurisconsults encompassing a study of their life and times, as well as of their thought. The impor- tant periods are those clustered around the fifth/eleventh century, perhaps the most important period in the development of Muslim institutions in the field of law as well as in the field of theology. The key personalities, next to Ash'arl (d. ca. 324), are: BaqillanI (d. 403) (1), Juwaini (d. 478), Ghazzall (d. 505), ShahrastanI (d. 548) and Razi (d. 606). Another serious obstacle is the lack of similar studies with regard to the other great movements, contemporary with Ash'arism; namely, Mu'tazilism, especially just before and during the rise of Ash'a- rism, and Hanbalism which survived them both as the spear- head of the traditionalist movement. These movements must be studied, if only to avoid attributing to Ash'arism roles and characteristics which rightly belong elsewhere. Moreover, it would be well to consider together the development of law and theology in this very important period in the development of Muslim Institutions. For we cannot hope to understand the nomocracy of Islam if we study the theology of Islam without its relation to Islamic law. George MAKDISI (Concluded) (Boston, Mass.). (1) Father McCarthy's work on Ash'arism, especially Baqillanl, is highly important in this regard and a substantial step in the right direction, since we need the texts themselves in order to study Ash'arite thought. But the texts must, in view of the danger of spuriousness, be carefully examined as to their authorship. Maybe we shall never be able to do this with regard to Ash'arl. Maybe Ash'arI's two faces ' have disfigured him historically in a permanent way and beyond recognition. But this is a problem which nevertheless has to be faced and recognized. 39</page></plain_text>
