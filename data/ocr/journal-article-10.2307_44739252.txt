<plain_text><page sequence="1">Contribution The Cohimbre Stela: Death , Sacrifice , and Political Ideology on the Guerrero Coast Gerardo Gutierrez and Jamie E. Forde Carved stone monuments have frequently provided impor- tant insights regarding religious and political ideology in ancient Mesoamerica (e.g., Boone 1999; Grove 1999; Guern- sey 2006; Guernsey et al. 2010; Pasztory 1976; Schele and Freidel 1990; Urcid 1993; Urcid and Joyce 2001). As objects produced for public display that were typically commissioned by ruling elites, they often present idealized relationships be- tween humans and supernatural beings, between rulers and their subjects, and between members of a polity and their founding ancestors. In this article, we present an analysis of one such monument, known as the Stela 1 of Cohimbre, found at the site of Terreno de Cohimbre in the Costa Chica region of Guerrero, Mexico, originally reported by Gutiérrez (2007). The monument contains a rather elaborate depiction of a skeletal figure, or death deity, and is suggestive of ideo- logical views related to human sacrifice. After first providing a description of the archaeological context and the monument itself, we go on to compare the Cohimbre stela image to rep- resentations of similar figures in Mesoamerican iconography, presenting an interpretation of its general significance as it relates to sacrifice. Lastly we compare the stela to earli- er monuments found in Guerrero. We argue that contrasts between the Cohimbre stela and earlier monuments along the Pacific Coast suggest changes in religious and political ideologies, in which rulers were no longer portrayed as the principal intermediaries through which people propitiated the gods. Instead, deities themselves are represented independent of royal lineages, marking a different kind of interaction be- tween elites and the commoners, the latter in direct contact with the supernatural realm. This diminished role of rulers' religious and ritual authority may have owed to the collapse of large centralized polities of the Classic period, paralleling trends seen elsewhere throughout Mesoamerica at the time (Pye and Gutiérrez 2007). Terreno de Cohimbre Terreno de Cohimbre, also known as Arroyo Tila, is a small site located near the eastern coast of Guerrero, in the modern municipality of Marquelia (Figure 1). The area was surveyed by Gutiérrez in 2001 as part of a broader regional reconnais- sance project (Gutiérrez 20 1 0). The site itself is located along a stream that empties into the Pacific Ocean just under 4 km to the southwest, via a rich estuary that was likely utilized by the site's prehispanic inhabitants. The core of the site consists of two mounds (Ml and M2) raised 2-3 m above the floodplain, ranging between 40-50 m in diameter (Figure 2). Approximately 480 m to the south, a third mound is found (M3), which was disturbed by the construction of a modern house on top of it. While unfortunately disturbing its archae- ological context, the modern construction on M3 brought a number of well-preserved prehispanic artifacts to the surface, inspected by Gutiérrez, including ceramics, obsidian, manos, and metates. Among the ceramics were polychromes dating to the Early Postclassic period (1000-1150 A.D.), though stratigraphie excavations are needed to firmly secure the chronology of the site. Survey beyond the core of the site indicates extensive surrounding settlement, spanning approx- imately 27 ha in the larger area known as Los Callejones. The Cohimbre stela (also termed Stela 1), was first en- countered by Gutiérrez not at the archaeological site, but instead in the modern municipal palace of Juchitán. Discus- sions with multiple local residents, however, revealed that the monument had undoubtedly been taken from Terreno de Cohimbre within the last decade. Family members of the owner of the land upon which the site is found were, in fact, able to precisely identify where the monument was located prior to it having been taken (Figure 2). Thus, it is fairly clear that the Cohimbre stela was once located within the core of the site, in front of the south side of Mound 1, likely erected for public viewing. Stewardship of the monument is an issue that remains debated among the recently created municipali- ties of Marquelia and Juchitan, both of whose territories made up parts of the ancient lands of Azoyú. The Cohimbre Stela The Cohimbre stela itself (Figures 3 and 4) was carved on a large flat gneiss stone, measuring approximately 1.8 m in height, 80 cm in width, and 30 cm in thickness. The bottom portion of the stone, extending nearly 40 cm, was left blank, indicating that it was set beneath the ground, such that the monument could be propped up vertically for public display. Though portions of the stone are eroded or otherwise dam- aged, enough of it is well preserved such that much of its iconography can be discerned. The front of the monument is dominated by a carved image of an anthropomorphic skel- etal figure. The head of the figure is rendered exaggeratedly large and is adorned with a broad headdress of feathers. The mouth exhibits a wide smile or grin, surrounded by what ap- pear to be separate bones of the maxilla and mandible. The torso and limbs are also depicted as skeletonized, though the hands and feet may be fleshed. In general, the figure appears rendered as somewhat of a "caricature," given its large head, lack of neck, and general inaccuracies with regard to skeletal anatomy (e.g., numbers of teeth, rib bones, vertebrae, etc.). Overall, the image resembles skeletal deities associated with death seen widely in Mesoamerican iconography, particularly during the Postclassic (Ochoa and Gutierrez 1 996- 1 999: 1 1 5). On the left side of the stela, though poorly preserved, is a small carved image that appears to represent a cipactli, or crocodile, particularly distinctive in Late Postclassic iconog- raphy by its truncated or "tucked in" lower jaw, frequently used to represent the first day sign in the Mesoamerican ritual calendar (Figure 5). Thus, this may represent part of a calendrical date, perhaps commemorating an event related to 19 mexicon • Vol. XXXVII • Februar 2015</page><page sequence="2">20 Figure 1 : Map of the Costa Chica of Guerrero, showing the location of Cohimbre and other archaeological sites (drawn by Gerardo Gutiérrez).

A second possibility is that it represents a calendrical name, associated with the figure on the front of the stela. We view this second possibility as unlikely, nonetheless, given that its placement on the side divorces it from direct association with the skeletal figure, which would constitute an apparent break with pictorial conventions seen in Classic and Postclassic iconography, in both Guerrero and Mesoamerica more broadly (see essays in Boone and Mignolo 1994; Boone and Urton 201 1 ; Diehl and Berlo 1989; Jansen and Broekhoven 2008; Marcus 1992; Urcid 2001). Meanwhile, the other sides and back of the monument were left blank. / Figure 4: Line drawing reconstruction of the Cohimbre stela (drawn by Jamie Forde). Returning to the front of the monument, perhaps the most in- teresting features of the stela are the objects associated with the skeletal figure. Within the right hand, and between the legs, are two similar motifs that we interpret as human hearts (Figure 6a). A third heart was likely depicted in the left hand as well, as shown in our reconstruction (Figure 4), though this portion of the monument is badly damaged. Hearts are depicted somewhat disparately in Mesoamerican iconogra- phy over time, from the tri-lobed heart glyph characteristic of Classic period Teotihuacan (De la Fuente 1995: 292, fig. 19.30) and Oaxaca (Urcid and Joyce 2001: 208) (Figure 6b), to the more globular motif with two or three lobes at its top common in the Postclassic and colonial codices of Oaxaca and central Mexico (Figure 6c). The motifs seen on the 21 mexicon • Vol. XXXVII • Februar 20 15</page><page sequence="4">Figure 5: Photograph of the side of the Cohimbre stela, showing a carved image of a cipactli (crocodile) (taken by Gerardo Gutiérrez). Cohimbre stone also bear less direct resemblance to what Urcid (2005: figure 2.9; Urcid and Joyce 2001 : 208) identifies as the "blood" glyph (Figure 6d), though the Cohimbre ex- amples lack the tripartite ends distinctive of the blood glyph. In our view, the motifs most closely resemble hearts depicted in Postclassic iconography, though the distal ends are point- ed rather than globular, and may thus suggest a "hybridized" form, or that they were otherwise distinctly stylized. Below the heart motif seen in the left hand of the figure is another design that, though somewhat eroded, may represent dripping blood. Meanwhile, the heart between the legs ap- pears to fall into what we identify as a vessel filled with liquid, possibly blood as well. If our identifications of these various motifs are correct, the image on the Cohimbre stela, though considerably different in style, bears closest resemblance to scenes found in the Late Postclassic and Early Colonial codices of Oaxaca and central Mexico, in which skeletal de- ities are shown receiving offerings of hearts and blood, often transported in vessels, in acts of sacrifice and propitiation (e.g., Figure 7). These deities, including Mictlantecuhtli, Tlatecuhtli, Coatlicue, and Lady 9 Grass, were most com- monly female and associated with not only death, but also the earth and rituals related to sustenance and agricultural fertility (Klein 1975; Nicholson 1977: 428). The gender of the Cohimbre figure cannot be discerned, as the only item of dress shown is the feather headdress, and no distinguishing features of anatomy are depicted. The Cohimbre figure also differs from Postclassic and Colonial depictions of death deities in that it lacks the clawed hands and feet typical of those seen in the codices. Hence, we can- not consider this figure a direct analogue of any specific Post- classic deity documented in colonial sources. Nevertheless, we view the association of the various motifs found in the Cohimbre stela as combining to create a strikingly analogous scene, in which this more generalized or unidentified death deity receives offerings of human hearts and blood, taken in acts of sacrifice, likely in hopes to propitiate it and garner fortune with regard to agricultural fertility, or subsistence generally. In other words, it was required that the deity be "fed" in order for the community of Cohimbre to be sustained by the gods in reciprocity. It is impossible to know who originally carved the Cohim- bre stela, but given its original placement within the core of the site, in front of one of the largest mounds in this location, it is quite possible, if not probable, that the monument was commissioned by the site's elites. It was placed in front of what may have been a public building or palace, and hence would have served as a piece of political "propaganda." Such practices were common in prehispanic Mesoamerican history, as elites would metaphorically link the kinds of sacrifice required of all humans in propitiation to the gods to sacrifice in the form of tribute, be it in goods or labor, that polity mem- bers were expected to pay to their rulers. These ideologies were very frequently expressed in monumental art and sculp- ture. The Cohimbre stela would have thus served to reinforce a general ideology emphasizing the necessity of sacrifice, which in turn could be used to legitimize the tribute demands of elites and their positions of power more generally. Such ideologies held deep historical roots in Guerrero, as they did throughout Mesoamerica; however, we argue below that the creators of the Cohimbre stela went about crafting a similar message in a way that deviated significantly from those of their Classic-period predecessors on the Costa Chica. This deviation, we believe, may reflect shifts in political ideolo- gies within the region, and changing views of elites vis-à-vis their roles in sacrifice and contact with the supernatural. Rulers, Deities, and Sacrifice on the Costa Chica Though the archaeological record of Guerrero remains some- what poorly understood relative to other parts of Mesoameri- ca, research has demonstrated that the area was home to rich traditions of artwork, including monument carving, since at least the Formative period (Garcia Pay ón 1941; Gutiérrez 2010; Gutiérrez and Pye 2010; Jiménez 2000; Manzanilla 1995, 2002; Pérez Negrete 2004; Piña Chan 1960; Urcid 1993). In terms of chronology, the largest corpus of carved monuments from the region dates to the Classic and Epiclas- sic periods, probably derived from a Zapotee tradition, but 22 "Ö *© Sff Figure 6: Depictions of hearts seen in a) the Cohimbre stela, b) Codex Tudela, page 46, c) Codex Magliabechi, page 66, and d) the Zapotee blood glyph (adapted from Urcid and Joyce 2001 : 208) (drawings by Jamie Forde). mexicon • Vol. XXXVII • Februar 2015</page><page sequence="5">sharing an even stronger relation with the iconography of Xochicalco and Teotenango (Gutierrez 2008b: 83). These monuments are diverse in their subject matter, yet a great number of them depict individual anthropomorphic figures directly associated with calendrical dates, likely depicting named rulers or other important personages. Though some of these individuals exhibit supernatural qualities, adopt- ing aspects of deities' costumes such as "goggle-eyes" (e.g., Gutierrez 2008b: fig. 9p), or depicted as undergoing shamanic transformation (e.g., Gutierrez and Pye 2010: 49-51; Urcid 1993: 156), the Cohimbre stela appears to represent a break from earlier traditions in its representation of a rather generic and unnamed death deity, as opposed to a named ruler. One earlier monument in particular from the Costa Chica region appears strikingly analogous to the Cohimbre stela, and serves as an intriguing basis for comparison and contrast; namely, Monument 3 from the nearby site of Piedra Labrada (Figure 8), a mere 38 km away. This monument, which dates to the Late Classic period (Gutiérrez 2008b; Gutiérrez and Pye 2010), features a large representation of an anthropomor- phic figure with a feline or jaguar head. On the chest of the figure, the "knot" glyph is depicted atop two horizontal bars, indicating the personage's calendrical name was Lord 10 Knot. Both Urcid (1993: 152) and Gutierrez and Pye (2010: 49) argue that this figure represents a male individual ruler who has undergone a process of shamanic transformation into his nahual , animal-spirit-companion or alter ego - in this case a jaguar. The figure in Monument 3 from Piedra Labrada exhibits a stark similarity to that depicted in the Cohimbre stela inso- far as, in both hands, we see motifs that are interpreted as bleeding hearts (De la Fuente 1995: 292; Gutiérrez and Pye 2010: 49). These designs closely resemble those identified here as hearts in the Cohimbre stela. The heart motifs in the Figure 7: Death deity receiving offerings of hearts and blood in Codex Tudela, page 64 (drawing by Jamie Forde). Piedra Labrada monument differ only in that each ex- hibit two pointed distal ends (rather than a singular distal point, as seen in the Cohim- bre motifs), perhaps com- prising composites of the "heart" and "blood" glyphs, and hence representing "bleeding hearts." A simi- lar motif is seen emanating from the mouth of the Pie- dra Labrada figure, which has been interpreted as a combination of a heart glyph and speech scroll, through which Lord 10 Knot calls out for hearts and blood, re- minding his people that the time has come to propitiate gods of the earth and fertil- ity through human sacrifice (Gutiérrez and Pye 2010: 49). In Monument 3 from Pie- dra Labrada, Lord 10 Knot is thus depicted as an inter- mediary who facilitated his community's fulfillment of the sacred covenant with the gods. In other words, the ruler was a crucial "go-between," as the community was required to provision various deities with human hearts and blood in order to ensure their continued sustenance (Joyce 2004: 213; Monaghan 1995, Olivier and López Lujan 2010), and the ruler had unique abilities to transport these goods to the gods upon their behalf. Rulers such as 1 0 Knot were depicted as having privileged access to these supernatural beings, in the present case through the ability to transform into the pow- erful nahual , the jaguar. These abilities likely would have ensured more direct contact with the deities in question and presumably more effective communication and petitioning. Such themes are common in Mesoamerican monumental art generally throughout prehispanic history, as social elites were frequently cast as descended from divine origins and possessing supernatural abilities. These qualities served to justify rulers' positions of power, allowing them to demand tribute - itself seen as a form of sacrifice - from commoners in exchange for using their special abilities to carry out hu- man sacrifice and other rituals in order to propitiate the gods. If, during the Classic period, rulers such as 10 Knot were celebrated in stone monuments as such vital intermediar- ies with the supernatural, why is it that the Cohimbre stela depicts not an individual ruler, but instead this generalized death deity? We see a move from what once appeared to be a triadic relationship, as seen in the Piedra Labrada monument, in which objects of sacrifice are passed from commoners to rulers, and eventually to gods, to a simple call for persons to propitiate the gods directly, evidenced in the Cohimbre Stela. Why does the ruler as "middleman" appear to have been effectively cut out of the equation? While much more research is needed to treat this matter fully, we would like to explore this question in the following section. 23 mexicon • Vol. XXXVII • Februar 2015</page><page sequence="6">Political Ideology and the Postclassic Transition The transition from the Classic to the Postclassic period was a time of political disruption and upheaval throughout much of Mesoamerica (Blomster 2008; Cowgill 1979; Culbert 1973; Diehl and Berlo 1989; Joyce 2010; Sabloff and Andrews 1986; Webster 2002), though polities in Guerrero may not have been impacted as significantly as other regions (Gutier- rez 2008a). It is clear, however, that polities of Guerrero had significant ties to Teotihuacan during the Classic period. Though the exact nature of these ties remain to be fully un- derstood, connections undoubtedly involved commerce, as residents of the Costa Chica would have likely traded gem stones, cacao, and other marine resources in exchange for green obsidian and prestige goods (Gutiérrez 2008a: 387). Among other factors, including those internal to the region, disruption of such trade networks could have contributed to a loss of clout, or erosion of legitimacy, for rulers of polities on the Costa Chica. Blanton and colleagues (1996), in an elaboration of their "dual-processual" model of sociopolitical change in Mesoa- merica, discuss subject matter depicted in stone monuments, amidst other lines of evidence, as indicating cycling between "corporate" and "network"-based polities. While it is not our intent to fully apply this model here, the distinction these authors draw provides a useful basic analytical framework for the data at hand. Blanton and colleagues argue that during the Classic period, Teotihuacan was typified by a corporate-based structure of political authority, in which aggrandizement of individual named rulers was muted in monumental art, in favor of emphases on general cosmological principals and depictions of relatively anonymous personages (Blanton et al. 1996: 6, 9-10). Interestingly, at the same time, the op- posite may have been the case in Guerrero, as monuments depicting named rulers were quite common. It is only after the fall of Teotihuacan that we see the Cohimbre Stela, the kind of monument that would be expected under a form of more corporate-based rulership. We can only speculate as to the reasons for this until more data are collected, but a similar pattern appears to typify the Lower Rio Verde region of the nearby Oaxaca coast as well, in which depictions of rulers accompanied by calendrical names, common during the Classic period, give way to more generalized figurai rep- resentations afterward (Joyce 2010: 253; Urcid and Joyce 2001). Both these regions had connections with Teotihuacan, but rather than mimicking the former's political structure, rulers on the coast may have used such ties to aggrandize themselves, following more of a network-based strategy. Te- otihuacan 's eventual collapse may have been a contributing factor in creating a social context in which this strategy was no longer viable, in effect eliminating one basis of prestige for these rulers. In the Maya region we see a similar phenomenon oc- curring in the transition from Classic to Postclassic periods. Whereas Classic polities were typified by abundant stela and other monuments dedicated to various sites' rulers and their exploits, at Epiclassic and Postclassic centers such as Chichen Itza, these representations give way to more gen- eralized images of warriors and other personages, and links between rulers and the sacred are deemphasized (Joyce 2000: 98; Pohl and Pohl 1994; Wonderley 1985). While reasons for 24 the Classic period collapse in the Maya area, as elsewhere in Figure 8: Depiction of the ruler 10 Knot in Monument 3 of Piedra Labrada (after Gutierrez and Pye 2010:50, fig.2.15; drawing by Gerardo Gutiérrez). Mesoamerica, continue to be debated today, it appears that this rupture in sociopolitical systems in some cases led to a diminishment in the perception of elites as sacred, reflected in shifts in the subject matter of monumental art. We propose that the data presented here may indicate a similar shift in political ideology on the coast of Guerrero during the Post- classic. mexicon • Vol. XXXVII • Februar 2015</page><page sequence="7">Conclusion We must reiterate that the Costa Chica region is only be- ginning to be understood archaeologically. Nonetheless, we believe the Cohimbre stela provides potentially intriguing suggestions regarding sociopolitical changes in pre-Hispanic Guerrero. The depiction of the death deity on the stela seems to represent a break with earlier subject matter seen in mon- umental art from the region - sacrifice is seen being made directly to the deity, rather than through a ruler as an inter- mediary. We argue that this may indicate a shift in political ideology, in which rulers had lost a certain degree of religious or ritual authority and could no longer cast themselves as possessing such privileged ties to the gods. Reasons for such a shift are currently unclear. Links to major centers such as Teotihuacan and Monte Alban, which collapsed during the Classic, may have played a role. What we may see in Guerrero is a process, whereby politico-reli- gious ideologies were reformulated after the Classic period. These ideas constitute hypotheses for future testing as we continue to investigate the history of this region of Mexico, and its ties to the broader Mesoamerican world.

Abstract In this article, we present a study of a carved stone monument depicting a death deity from the Costa Chica region of Guerrero, Mexico. In comparing the monument with other representations of death deities in Mesoamerican iconography, we discuss its general significance as relates to human sacrifice. Further, comparisons with other carved stones found in the Costa Chica are suggestive of changes in political ideology within this region that may parallel similar developments seen elsewhere in Mesoamerica. This study will shed some light on the archaeology of a key area of Mexico that has largely remained unexplored. Resumen En este artículo presentamos el estudio de una estela grabada con la rep- resentación de una deidad de la muerte, proveniente de la Costa Chica de Guerrero, México. Con base en un estudio comparativo con otras deidades de la muerte en Mesoamérica, discutimos su significado general y su aso- ciación con la práctica de sacrificio humano. Un examen más detallado del monumento frente a otras estelas encontradas en la Costa Chica de Guerrero, nos permite sugerir que esta región atravesó cambios político-ideológicos similares a desarrollos detectados en otras áreas mesoamericanas. Este estudio arroja luz a la arqueología de una región clave de Mesoamérica que por desgracia permanece poco explorada. Zusammenfassung In diesem Artikel stellen wir ein skulptiertes Steinmonument von der Costa Chica-Region in Guerrero vor, dass eine Todesgottheit darstellt. Durch den Vergleich dieses Monuments mit anderen Darstellungen von Todesgot- theiten in mesoamerikanischer Ikonographie können wir seine Bedeutung erforschen und diskutieren, in welcher Beziehung es zum Menschenopfer steht. Darüber hinaus zeigen Vergleiche mit anderen Monumenten der Costa Chica-Region, dass es Veränderungen in der politischen Ideologie dieser Region gegeben hat die Parallelen aufweisen zu ähnlichen Entwicklungen in Mesoamerika. Diese Untersuchung möchte einen Beitrag zum besseren Verständnis eines bislang wenig beachteten Gebietes in Mesoamerika leisten.</page></plain_text>
