<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol 54, No. 1 (Autumn 2004) The Figure of Jerusalem: Jacques Derrida's Specters of Marx Christopher Wise "The beautiful golden city is the heart and soul of the Jewish people. You cannot live without a heart and soul. If you want one simple word to sym- bolize all of Jewish history, that word would be Jerusalem." - Teddy Kolleck, Israeli Mayor of Jerusalem in 1977 "The intifadah is Palestinian self-determination, and is not a figure of speech." - Edward W. Said, The Politics of Dispossession In this essay, I explore Jacques Derrida's evocation of the Jerusalem fig- ure by contrasting Jewish and Christian approaches to allegorical interpre- tation, and by closely examining Fredric Jameson's suggestion that Specters of Marx advocates a figurative exegesis or an inherently didactic hermeneu- tics. The claims of Marxist critics like Antonio Negri and Pierre Macherey that Derrida relies upon a disguised ontological interpretive system are re- jected insofar as they imply the impossibility of non-European belief sys- tems.1 I argue that such readings of Derrida tend to activate the "Shylock Complex," or the violent conversion of the Jew to logocentric modes of in- terpretation. Deconstruction does not therefore offer us yet another footnote to Plato, or a new way of practicing Western philosophy, but a potentially liberating alternative to dominant Western modes of theorizing the real. However, in describing the "war for the appropriation of Jerusalem," Derri- da subordinates deconstruction to serve the interests of specific politics that are far from neutral. He does this by authorizing a hypostasis of the Jerusa- lem figure in the pages of Specters of Marx (but also at the "Whither Marx- ism?" conference in Riverside, California) at the expense of actual Palestin- ian peoples and the historical city of Al-Quds, the Arabic name for Jerusa- lem. The Jerusalem figure is universalized rather than identified as a strictly Zionist obsession. The inherently didactic nature of this allegorical maneu- ver is further strengthened by Derrida's assumption of a homiletic and ped- 73</page><page sequence="2">74 Christopher Wise agogical posture at the "Whither Marxism?" conference, where he offers to lead disoriented Marxists into the future, provided that they accept his "un- alterable" condition of re-politicization: namely, that the Marxist theory of ideology be rewritten as a variety of messianic eschatology, or Abrahamie religion. Derrida seeks to convert Marx into a "thinker of technics," or a de- constructionist avant le lettre . Specters of Marx is haunted by an evangelical spirit, by Derrida's desire to transform Marxism into an imperfect version of deconstruction. Even Francis Fukuyama, a Platonic-Hegelian Liberal, is recast as a "thinker of technics," albeit an immature and childish one. Derr- ida imagines that his Marxist student-readers are also in need of his benign pedagogical assistance. Specters of Marx is therefore offered to the incompe- tent reader as a lesson in Middle Eastern politics. To this end, the capital of Elsinore and the medieval kingdom of Denmark from Shakespeare's Ham- let are set before the reader to elicit a judgment about the modern "capital" of Jerusalem and the "rotten" State of Israel. I urge the reader to decline Der- rida's charitable gift, as well as his sermonic lesson about the Jerusalem fig- ure and the mortified remains of the messianic. This rejection will almost always be necessary for Christian and Muslim readers of Derrida because his allegedly "universal" concept of messianicity promotes a Jewish concept of the Messiah as a structure of expectation rather than absolute or even his- torical event. In Specters of Marx, Jacques Derrida will agree with Max Stirner that " [the Christian God] Jesus is at once the greatest and the most 'incomprehensible of ghosts,'" a kind of "horrible being [. . . who] introduced great distress into history" (144). It may well be, however, that there is no ghost in more recent global history that has brought greater distress to human life everywhere, but especially to Levantine peoples in the Middle East, than the ghostly figure that continues to haunt the dreams of Zionists throughout the world: the "symptomatic figure" of a Holy City built upon the ruins of Palestinian Al- Quds (or Arab Jerusalem) and countless Arab lives. At the "Whither Marx- ism?" conference event in Riverside, Derrida repeatedly evokes "the figure of Jerusalem," summoning this religious phantom on numerous occasions. "Frequency counts," Derrida reminds us. "The experience, the apprehension of the ghost is tuned into frequency : number (more than one), insistence, rhythm (waves, cycles, and periods)" (Specters of Marx 107). Like the ghost of Hamlet's father, the Jerusalem figure possesses "spectral density" (109), becoming a master trope that reigns in this text's more anarchistic impuls- es. As is also true of the murdered king in Shakespeare's Hamlety Derrida's Jerusalem figure haunts the pages of Specters of Marx at its most dramatic, climactic, and paradoxical moments. To clarify the importance of the Jerusalem figure to this text, we must first differentiate Derrida's "quasi-atheistic" approach to figurative exegesis from</page><page sequence="3">Derrida and Jerusalem 75 dominant Western ones, especially Christian and Marxist hermeneutical models. In Derrida's exchange with Fredric Jameson, who relies upon a Marxian variety of figurative interpretation, Derrida will state: "I continue to have reservations concerning the word 'allegory,' which Jameson assigns so important a role [. . .] and am still undecided about it" ("Marx &amp; Sons" 246). Derrida rejects the words "aesthetic" and "utopian" as irrelevant while merely registering his ambivalence about allegory without further explana- tion. Understandably, Derrida expresses his discomfort at the ease with which Jameson employs allegorical interpretive strategies (for Jameson, a term that is related to Claude Lévi-Strauss's general concept of the pensée sauvage and integral to his own theory of the political unconscious); however, in respond- ing to Jamesons critique of Specters of Marx, Derrida is compelled to recog- nize that, unlike the concepts of the aesthetic and the Utopian, he may not simply reject the concept of allegory because of his frank manipulation of it. In part, Derridas divergence from Jameson can be explained with refer- ence to his unique heritage as a Sephardic Jewish philosopher, understand- ably less at ease with reworked Christian concepts and interpretive strate- gies. In his introduction to The Political Unconscious ( 1 98 1 ) , it will be remem- bered, the Marxist critic Jameson surprised many by his frank appreciation of Northrop Frye's Anatomy of Criticism (1959), a modern Christian rein- vention of the patristic hermeneutic systems of Origen, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and others. In The Political Unconscious , Jameson even applauded these church fathers for devising an interpretive system that sought to me- diate between the temporal horizons of their imaginary "neolithic" ances- tors and the present needs of the church community.2 Implicit in Derrida's discomfort with Jamesonian allegory is the long history of Jewish and Chris- tian discord over the concept of allegory and its proper usage in the inter- pretation of the Bible. Although Jewish interpreters employed allegorical interpretation long before Augustine's On Christian Doctrine appeared in 427 A.D. (the first comprehensive and systematic treatment of figurative herme- neutics and homiletics), those Jews who did not convert to Christianity were often dismayed at how their Greco-Roman rivals relied upon allegory as a means of canceling the literal (or etiological) meaning of the text. August- ine of Hippo, who was deeply influenced by Neo-Platonism and who was far less familiar with Hebrew civilization, often sought the Biblical text's allegor- ical meaning for the new "chosen" community as a way of superseding Ju- daic theology and history. This Christian practice predates Augustine in the Epistles of Paul, where Levantine customs like circumcision, the prohibition of eating animals with cloven-hoofs, and similar indigenous practices were negotiated in light of the cultural prejudices of new Greco-Roman converts to the faith. If the contradictions of the Biblical text itself rendered any strictly</page><page sequence="4">76 Christopher Wise anti-figurative exegesis unlikely, Jews who remained loyal to the religious beliefs of the Pharisees, Scribes, Essenes, and others understandably felt that the interpretative practices of the Christian community were both offensive and heretical. As Solomon ben Ardet, a leading Jewish exegete in the medi- eval period, put it, "A man [like Augustine] who reduces the entire Bible to useless allegories trifles with and perverts all the commandments in order to make the yoke of his burden lighter to himself" (Peters II 1 16). From this orthodox Jewish perspective, Christian allegorical exegesis served the func- tion of freeing the Christian from adhering to the far stricter Mosaic codes while preserving such codes as old or defunct instances of scriptural revela- tion. Allegorical interpretation in the emerging Christian orthodoxy implied that Judaism was both idolatrous and irrelevant. In Specters of Marx, Derrida indeed relies upon allegorical interpretation, as Jameson suggests in his essay "Marx's Purloined Letter," but Jameson too hastily assumes their shared beliefs about this strategy, which no Jewish ex- egete could employ without careful equivocation or qualification. Perhaps the most obvious reason for Jewish disdain of figurative rhetoric in Chris- tian discourse is its implied anthropomorphism, or its recasting of scriptur- al meaning in terms of the Corpus Christi, or body of Christ (i.e. the united church community). The word figure, from the Latin figura or Old Latin fin- gere, literally means "to form." In Derrida's anti-essentialist critique of the Platonic Idea as idol, or a kind of "Wise Guide" for the human eye/I, he sug- gests that forms are unavoidably sedimented with the real, which can never be real in the way that many Western philosophers assume. Allegory or fig- ura in its most obvious sense is commonly evoked to enable the transcen- dence of the level of the literal, etiological, or historical meaning of a text, which in this instance maybe signified by the Palestinian Arab term for Jerus- alem, which is the holy city called Al-Quds.3 Arab Al-Quds, a word that never appears in Specters of Marx, is the historical or etiological level that Derrida effaces with his Jerusalem figure. The word "Al-Quds" means "holy" and is etymologically related to "Gaddos" in Arabic and "Gaddosh" in Hebrew. All of these names are preceded by the Aramaic word "Qaddosh." (In the Qur'an, one of God's names is "Qaddoos" or "the Holy One.") From a Muslim per- spective - and, arguably, from a historical perspective - the city of Al-Quds is far more ancient than Jerusalem. In fact, the name "Jerusalem" is almost never used by Arabic, Aramaic, or Muslim speakers, except when address- ing a Western audience. The Qur'an does not refer to either "Jerusalem" or "Al-Quds" but mentions the "Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa," known by the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad to be located in the town of Al-Quds. Muslims believe that Muhammad visited Al-Quds on the night of Al-Esra'e. The Qur'an also refers to the "Qubaat Al-Sakhrah," or the Dome of the Rock of Al-Quds. The Prophet Muhammad himself never utters the word "Jerusalem" in any of his</page><page sequence="5">Derrida and Jerusalem 77 Hadith or "Sayings." In Specters of Marx, Derrida deliberately elides the spec- ificity of Al-Quds, burying this ancient name in preference for Jerusalem. In other words, while Israeli Jews may certainly be fighting a war to win their beloved Jerusalem, Arab Muslims are embroiled in an intifada - or "shirk- ing off" - to restore their Holy City of Al-Quds. In one of the most striking passages from Specters of Marx, following an apocalyptic reference to what he alleges is a "world war" for the Holy City of Jerusalem, Derrida collapses all distinctions between this armed figure and its historical grounding or "place": "the greatest symptomatic or métonymie concentration of what remains irreducible in the worldwide conjuncture in which the question of 'whither Marxism' is inscribed today has its place, its figure, or the figure of its place in the Middle East: three other messianic eschatologies mobilize there all the forces of the world and the whole 'world order' in the ruthless war they are waging against each other, directly or indirectly" (58). Reduced to its constituent elements, this complicated sentence makes a simple assertion: the irreducible center has its place. It has a ground of its own. The thing is a thing. Moreover, this thing uhas its place, its figure, or the figure of its place in the Middle East " (58, emphasis added). In the later por- tion of the sentence, Derrida conflates the levels of the historical and alle- gorical: The place of Jerusalem is the same as the symptomatic/ïgwre of Jerus- alem; or, the figure of Jerusalem implies "the figure of [Jerusalems] place" (58). Earlier in Specters of Marx, Derrida quotes a remarkably similar pas- sage from Shakespeare's Hamlet after the ghost of Hamlet's father appears to the Prince and his fellow conspirators: "The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body : The King, is a thing (Specters of Marx 9, emphasis added). After Derrida demonstrates how the god-term (or King-Thing) comes into being for Hamlet and his fellow conspirators, or how word and thing become conjoined as word-thing when summoned by the human voice, he clarifies the social consequences of this conflation by showing how logocentric centers like the King-Thing (in the play, the Ghost of Hamlet's father) are evoked on behalf of interpretative bodies, who swear collective oaths of silence about truths that they know are lies (but in a "nonmoral" sense, as Nietzsche once put it).4 The King becomes King-Thing, Derrida writes, "in order to reign, and first of all, to inherit royal dignity, whether by crime or election." In the case of the Jerusalem figure, this ghostly city also becomes a Thing at the moment that it separates from the more literal ground of Al-Quds. In other words, Jerusalem doubles as simultaneous figure and place in order that some unified body might reign "whether by crime or elec- tion." In the meantime, the historical field of Al-Quds is superseded if not annihilated in a figurative sense, not to mention an implicit moral sense, the inevitable adjunct to these first two levels of meaning; that is, after allegori- cal meaning is secured, it is incumbent upon the body of believers in the</page><page sequence="6">78 Christopher Wise ghost to act. For this reason, Frye and Jameson have both emphasized the social or communal character of figurative interpretation despite their great differences in political orientation. Jameson is certainly correct that Derrida proposes a figurative hermeneu- tics in Specters of Marx , but Derridas own figurative system diverges from the patristic or medieval Christian model in at least one very important way: The central mechanism that propels the movement of the Augustinián sys- tem differs from what gives impetus to Derridas own figurative model, a mystical "mechanism" that is paradoxically described as invisible writing. It bears emphasizing that this mechanism is devoid of metaphysical content. For this reason, Derrida may always claim that the figure of Jerusalem is lit- tle more than a ghost, not a metaphysics. In relation to Jameson's reading of Derrida, the movement of Derridas system is not in any way driven by Chris- tian charity [ caritas ] , as in Augustinián polysemous interpretation but by the "universal" or messianic structure of irreducible faith. In Of Christian Teach- ing , Augustine draws from Paul to define the Christian concept of Spirit with reference to the law that is inscribed upon the human heart: "You are our letter " Paul writes, " written not with ink but with the spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone buton the fleshly tablets of the hearť (2 Corinthians 3:2- 3). In certain circumstances, Augustine suggests the superfluous character of sacred scripture, which must finally be subordinated to this other corpo- real "text": " [A] person strengthened by faith, hope, and love, and who stead- fastly holds on to them," Augustine writes, "has no need of the scriptures except to instruct others" (On Christian Teaching 28). With some exceptions, Christians generally assert that the law written upon the human heart takes precedence over written scripture, which from an orthodox Jewish perspec- tive fails to respect the literal integrity of the Biblical text. In Augustine, on the other hand, Christian exegetes measure the validity of their reading of scripture in relation to the guiding principle of Love or charity [caritas]; or, as Paul puts it, "there remain faith, hope, and love, these three; but the greatest of these is love" (1 Corinithians 13:13). Extrapolating from Paul, Augustine argues, "When someone has learnt that the aim of the commandment is 'love from a pure heart, and good conscience and genuine faith' [1 Timothy 1:5], he will be ready to relate every interpretation of the holy scriptures to these three things and may approach the task of handling these books with confi- dence" (29). For Augustine, the Spirit that guides interpretive inquiry im- plies logocentric embodiment, which is the chief consequence of Augustine's and Paul's insistence upon the priority of love (or caritas ), whereas the "uni- versal" principle that guides Derrida's approach to figurative exegesis is the messianic "structure of the promise" ( Deconstruction In A Nutshell 22). In other words, the greatest virtue for Derrida is not love but "faith," a concept that he argues cannot be reduced to any specific religion or "determinate</page><page sequence="7">Derrida and Jerusalem 79 figure and form" of the Messiah: "When I insisted in Specters of Marx on mes- sianicity," Derrida states, "which I distinguished from messianism [in Juda- ism, Christianity, and Islam], I wanted to show that the messianic structure is a universal structure" (22, emphasis added)." For Derrida, the validity of textual exegesis may be ascertained with ref- erence to the exegete's adherence to or deviance from this pre-emptorial interpretive principle. Derrida states: "[T]he fact that this expectation of the coming has to do with justice [. . .] is what I call the messianic structure" (23). Readers who are not believing Jews will obviously be more skeptical about Derridas claim that the messianic structure may be posited in any univer- salizing way. Christians who remain loyal to their own concept of Messianic Truth, which for them is a concept that implies Messianic incarnation, may understandably feel that Derrida 's assertion that his faith in a Messiah who never comes is far from being a matter of universal truth. Muslims too may wonder if Derrida's claim that messianicity supercedes even Quranic reve- lation, or belief in an uncreated and co-eternal Book, is not a disingenuous strategy for asserting the cultural hegemony of a historically specific "uni- versalism," one that has more in common with Judaic religion than either Islam or Christianity. "This 'trust me, I am speaking to you is of the order of faith," Derrida insists, "a faith that cannot be reduced to a theoretical state- ment, to a determinative justice [. . . and] is absolutely universal " (22, em- phasis added). The position of the Jew who awaits the coming of the Messi- ah but rejects belief in a revealed truth that has already arrived - whether that truth is Jesus Christ or the Heavenly Book - becomes the common subject position for all humanity, as well as a basis for establishing a new concept of human rights. While Derrida emphasizes that the messianic structure should not be reduced to any given messianism that privileges one Abrahamie tradition over its rivals, he effectively reduces both Christian and Islamic messianism to Jewish messianism. Derrida refrains from stating his actual beliefs but his equivocating on this question is disingenuous. "On the one hand," Derrida states, he may accept the historical validity of revelation in Judaism, Chris- tianity, and Islam as absolute events that have unveiled messianicity. In this case, "we would not know what messianicity is without messianism" (23). "On the other hand," he also states, he may accept that messianicity is a "uni- versal" rather than an historical experience, what he calls "a stylistic Heideg- gerian gesture." The later assertion reinforces the hegemony of Judaic belief systems, promoting a spiritualist theology rather than a logocentric one. Derrida will elsewhere insist upon the materiality of this theology ("Marx &amp; Sons" 267), but "matter" for Derrida is always the "matter of the mother" or an ideology affirming the theological character of the maternal debt ("Cir- cumfession" 155). For this reason, Derrida also refers to messianicity as a</page><page sequence="8">80 Christopher Wise "quasi-atheism" or a religious belief system that appears to be materialist but is actually Jewish theology. Derrick's prior assertion that Abrahamie revela- tion occurred as "absolute events" would, by way of contrast, imply that Derrida affirms a more traditional belief in Mosiac revelation. This would mean that Derrida is simply a believing Jew. Emptied of universality, this possibility will no doubt seem more acceptable for believing Christians and Muslims because it might allow them to retain their own belief systems with- out converting them into Jews manqués; that is, Jews, Christians, and Mus- lims could simply agree to disagree about revelation in their respective faiths. Jews could continue to affirm that the entirety of revelation was given to Moses at Sinai; Christians could continue to affirm belief in Jesus Christ as Revealed and Incarnate Word; and Muslims could continue to affirm that the Revealed Quran supersedes both Jewish and Christian revelations. In- terlocutionary exchange between Abrahamie rivals would therefore imply the need for a secular (or liberal) framework rather than a religious one. This solution is not acceptable to Derrida, however, because he believes that the ideology of humanism secretly privileges logocentric belief systems, especially Christianity with its distinctly Platonic heritage. In the case of Christian hermeneutics, the Augustinián system, which has overshadowed Western interpretive theory for hundreds of years, nonethe- less parallels Derridas disguised allegorical system in at least one important sense: the guiding interpretive principle of caritas , or Christian love, also advocates that Christians adopt a spirit of forbearance in judging the mean- ing of any given text, including the universe of ontological signs. The guid- ing principle of Derrida's system similarly mandates that the exegete ap- proach the text in a spirit of tolerant anticipation, a hopeful waiting for the truthful word of the other. Although Augustine finally insists upon a con- cept of caritas that is inseparable from an ideology of Messianic incarnation, he also acknowledges the importance of "genuine faith" and "good con- science" (On Christian Teaching 29). Augustine and Derrida nonetheless diverge in their speculative location of their respective true or revealed words, which both imagine to be autonomous. While Augustine will insist that the exegete's spirit of critical leniency must finally give way to a concept of em- bodiment, wherein merely written texts are disregarded in favor of the cor- poreal word, Derrida theorizes that the exegete's spirit of hopeful anticipa- tion should lead to belief in a factual but unseen word that circulates out- side the human body, not as an Incarnate Word or Gathered Book in Heav- en, but in discourse that is produced during interlocutory exchanges with the other. Derrida maintains that the spirit (or trace) of the word cannot be contained within the human body, or within any organic interior space, but enjoys an independent life in a realm exterior to the mind, heart, or organic body ( Specters of Marx 171-72). If not identical to mainstream or orthodox</page><page sequence="9">Derrida and Jerusalem 81 Judaism, his revised definition of the trace in Specters of Marx parallels Kab- balistic concepts of spirit, or "the soul of the Torah": The Book of Splendor, for instance, affirms that "the genuine Sages, the servants of the Most High King, those who stood at Mount Sinai, look only at the soul of the Torah, which is the most elemental principle of all, the True Torah" (Peters II 76). The true Torah in this sense is an oral-aural word that is destined for the ears rather than the eyes, in stark contrast to the Pauline view that Jews follow the letter of the law rather than its invisible spirit. Both Jewish and Chris- tian concepts of revelation are integral to their respective orthodoxies, and they are powerful in theological implication, but no single exegetical tradi- tion should seek to obliterate its religious rival, nor posit itself as "absolute truth" or empirical fact. For many Levantine peoples today, there is obviously more at stake in this matter than the resolution of a subtle difference in exegetical orientation. First, in mediating from the level of the literal to the figurative, Derrida not only insists upon the priority of his Judaic concept of universal faith, he also evokes the Jerusalem figure without asking what happens to the historical level that is strategically transcended. Here, the temptation to assert that Derrida is unwittingly logocentric may be impossible for some to resist. However, this temptation must be resisted, not merely for the interpretive violence it enacts against Derrida, but also because of its inaccuracy. Even though he does not always live up to his own high standards in every instance, Derrida must not be recast as secret Christian or closet ontologist, an all too common catechresis of Marxists and other theorists in the West. Nonethe- less, in Specters of Marx, Derrida leaves himself vulnerable to the charge of promoting a regressive ontology because Arab Al-Quds, or the literal or eti- ological field, is eclipsed within his own figurative system. From the stand- point of many, that the State of Israel has illegally controlled Jerusalem for more than thirty years now seems too obvious to have been over-looked.5 Derrida also insists that this figure is a "symptomatic" or "métonymie" one, implying that the Jerusalem figure, like the term apartheid, is intended as a moveable one that is not reducible to the State of Israel but must be appre- ciated in a global sense rather than one too narrowly centered upon the ac- tual site of Al-Quds. In regards to the later, or the Jerusalem figure in its more global valence, the appeal to its transferability must be renounced because of the obvious interpretive violence it enacts against actual Palestinians. It is also worth noting that in Maimonides' famous list of "Thirteen Prin- ciples," articulating the essentials of Judaism, there are no references to land- claims or even the status of Jews as a chosen people. As do Christians, Mai- monides does affirm the Messiah must come from David's lineage, implying the need for a Jewish remnant, but that is all (Peters 1 271-73). Maimonides' view here is not unlike the beliefs of Shi'ite Muslims that the Mahdi, or the</page><page sequence="10">82 Christopher Wise man who will prepare the way for the second coming of Jesus, will come from the line of Muhammad (through Ali and Fatima). Zionism is similarly at variance with historically orthodox articulations of the Christian religion. As in the case of the figurative interpretation of circumcision rituals in the Christian religion,6 the Zionist claim to the Promised Land, believed to be recorded in the Book of Joshua, becomes an idolatrous literalism for Chris- tians, a no longer binding "old" testament that has been rendered invalid by the Gospel of Jesus. Some Americans like Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and others have lent support to U.S. foreign policy in Israel by affirming a dis- tinctly American form of Christian Zionism.7 The seeds of the American Christian double-standard are latent in the Pauline approach to circumci- sion, wherein Paul maintains that circumcision retains its validity, but only for Jews. Paul refuses to circumcise his disciple Titus, who is born of a Gen- tile mother, but agrees to circumcise Timothy, another disciple born of a Jewish mother. If cases like this one have led some Christians to view Jewish peoples as entitled to unique spiritual privileges and responsibilities, the more widely accepted historical view in the Christian religion has been that Paul's tolerance of circumcision was a product of specific historical circumstances that are no longer binding. Thomas Aquinas, for instance, argued that " [t]he reason why the Holy Spirit did not wish the converted Jews to be debarred at once from observing the legal ceremonies, while converted pagans were forbidden to observe the rites of paganism, was in order to show that there was a difference between those rites" (Peters II 277). Hundreds of years af- ter the time of Paul, Aquinas and most Christians believed that this period of special dispensation for Jews had come to a conclusion. Islam, on the other hand, allows for less ambiguity on the Zionist question, since Jewish scrip- tures are viewed as imperfect, due to textual revisions that Muslims believe occurred, both from Jewish carelessness and from deliberate efforts on the part of Jews and Christians to erase all prophetic references to the coming of Muhammad and the Islamic religion. From a Muslim perspective, there is little need to rationalize or even discuss Biblical references to Jewish claims about the "Promised Land," which may be viewed as historically invalid or false. For instance, Muslims reject the story of Lot's incestuous relation with his daughters, which they believe were invented to imply the illegitimacy of non-Jewish claims about the region (i.e. Lot's daughters were the founding mothers of the Ammonites and Moabites). Beyond the belief that a vener- ated figure like the Prophet Lot (or "Lut" in Islam) would have not have be- come drunk and fornicated with his own daughters, Arab Muslims common- ly believe that Jews often falsified the scriptures out of self-interest.8 In op- position to Jews and Christians, Muslims have also maintained that it is not possible to know which scriptures may or may not be read allegorically. As Ibn Rushd (or Averroes) put it, "it is not possible for general unanimity to</page><page sequence="11">Derrida and Jerusalem 83 be established about allegorical interpretations, which God has made pecu- liar to scholars. This is self-evident to any fair-minded person" (Peters II 147). The literal or fundamentalist claim that Eretz Israel belongs to a specific ethnic group, whether it is advanced by scriptural exegetes like Jacques Derr- ida, Pat Robertson, or the Gush Eminem deserves to be underscored, not because Zionism is reducible to Judaism, but because Zionist Jews and Chris- tians have advanced this claim in opposition to their respective orthodoxies and to the detriment of Arab Christians and Muslims, many of whom have not only lost their ancestral homeland but basic civil and human rights, in- cluding the right to live. In Israel's Declaration of Independence (1948), the claim is advanced that lands long held by Arab peoples belong to Israeli Jews by virtue of "natural and historical right" (Findley 3); or, as one offical AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] document puts it, "Israels in- ternational 'birth certificate' was validated by the promise of the Bible" (4). Although many Orthodox Jews do not read the Bible outside of Talmudic mediation, one Biblical passage often cited to substantiate this claim is re- corded in the Book of Joshua wherein God [YHWH] is reputed to have said: "I have allotted to you [Joshua and the Israelites], by your tribes, [the terri- tory] of these nations that remain, and that of all the nations that I have destroyed, from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea" (Joshua 23:1-7). In some cases, figures like Ariel Sharon have even claimed that "Originally Pal- estine had included Jordan" (Findley 8). In fact, the historical insistence of Israeli political leaders like Sharon, Menachem Begin, and Benyamin Net- anyahu that the East Bank (i.e. approximately half of the Hashemite King- dom of Jordan) rightfully belongs to Jewish peoples has for decades been an important factor in undermining the Middle Eastern peace process. Unlike many contemporary Israeli historians, Derrida himself prefers not to distin- guish between Zionism, Orthodox Judaism, Reformed Judaism, and secu- lar varieties of Judaism: it bears repeating that in Specters of Marxist, Zionist ideology is consistently described as a " Jewish discourse on the Promised Land" or "the Jewish préfiguration of the Promised Land" (60, emphasis added). At no point in Specters of Marx will Derrida confirm that Zionism is an ideology in its own right, distinct from more orthodox interpretations of Judaism. Never does Derrida make clear that the Jerusalem figure assumes a logocentric character only for Zionists. In his essay "Marx &amp; Sons," Derrida alleges that he comes "disarmed" before his Marxist interlocutors (214); however, Derrida repels Christian claims upon the holy land by implying that the Jew may convert the Chris- tian into a disabled Jew (i.e. the inverted Shylock Complex); and by imply- ing that the Jew may turn himself into a "Christian" as it suits him to pre- serve the Jewish claim to the holy land (i.e. he may evoke a metaphysics of presence for "pedagogical" reasons ["Marx &amp; Sons" 229]). With these vio-</page><page sequence="12">84 Christopher Wise lent inversions, Derrida effectively abuses deconstruction in a manner that necessitates yet more inversions: for, if the Shylock Complex is present at the inauguration of Marrano identity (i.e. the Jew who must pretend to be a Christian), the counter-Shylock Complex, wherein the Christian is forcibly converted to Judaism, may give rise to a whole new species of "Marranos": Christians who are compelled to make Jews of themselves, or suffer dire consequences like exile or death: this is, in fact, the historical situation of many Arab Israelis today.9 Not unlike his catechrestic conversion of the "hea- then" (i.e. "Christian") Fukuyama, Derridas reading of Marx is guided by a figurative evangelical impulse, only Derrida "saves" the "Jewish" Marx from the "Christian" Marx. In other words, Derrida excavates the Marx of "tech- nics" as a "predeconstructive" theorist, a valorized term in this context, but he buries another Marx, the Marx who remains stuck in the logocentric bi- nary of essence and actuality. The Marx that Derrida affirms is one who is free from the spell of Christian ontology, a Marx who thinks in terms of a "critical but predeconstructive ontology of presence as actual reality and objectivity" ( Specters of Marx 170). Marx's "critical ontology" in this instance, which is synonymous for Derrida with "technics" or "hauntology," is laud- able because it may serve to exorcise phantoms, ghosts, or "figures" (i.e. fig- ures of speech), without going as far as suggesting that living human beings can actually do without their specters: in other words, it would be impossi- ble to imagine a society without a common vocabulary of stock phrases like "the good news," "the Holy City," and "the Promised Land" from which to draw. We will always have such ghosts among us, but they should never be construed as ontological or metaphysical ghosts. Derrida affirms that what he calls the "predeconstructive" in Marx does not then mean false, unneces- sary, or illusory; instead, it signifies "a relatively stabilized knowledge that calls for questions more radical than the critique itself and than the ontology that grounds the critique" ( Specters of Marx 170). When Marx is at his best, he comes close to being a "quasi-atheistic" thinker like Derrida, a "thinker of techics" or "hauntology." This invisible spirit (which is really a ruah or "windy writing") does not exist within the confines of the organic human subject (nor the Hegelian object of that subject), but is better grasped as "a surviv- ing automatism" ( Specters of Marx 171). The spirit in question is "the one which supposes the very movement of its letter" ( Specters of Marx 172). The trace moves of its own volition, not willed by any subject or object. "It is a matter of something or someone, neither someone nor something, of a 'one' that does not act" ( Specters of Marx 172). The problem with "a certain Marx" is that he "chased away so many ghosts too quickly" ( Specters of Marx 174). There were some figures-of-speech that Marx should have preserved, presumably Abrahamie figures like spirit, the messianic, revelation, and the "symptomatic figure of Jerusalem." Marx</page><page sequence="13">Derrida and Jerusalem 85 should have reverently waited upon these biblical figures in a spirit of pas- sive apprehension and humility. An evangelical impulse unites Derrida's read- ings of Fukuyama and Marx, both of whom must be converted into "think- ers of technics." Marx and Marxism may have a future after all, Derrida sug- gests, but only on the non-negotiable condition that they are shepherded into the messianic fold: "[Marxism] is still necessary," he assures his readers, " but provided it be transformed and adapted to a new thinking of the ideologi- cal" (58). To the question "Whither Marxism?", Derrida does not therefore pose a new question but provides his readers with a definitive answer : He himself will become the good shepherd (or "pedagogue") who will "lead" Marxism into a new future: "[W]here is [Marxism] to be led?" (59), Derri- da rhetorically asks. It cannot be led, or Derrida will refuse to become the good shepherd, unless Marxism first undergoes a certain adjustment. This is the condition to which his readers must submit: The teacher will not teach, or the pedagogical "leading" cannot happen "without transformation" (59). Derrida's "Christian" and homiletic posture in Specters of Marx may be illuminated with reference to Augustinián figuration, especially its third or moral level wherein pragmatic action, specifically the necessity of spreading the good news, arises after figurative meaning is ascertained. Christian exe- getes, or the church fathers and scriptural authorities, must teach the world the truths that they have discovered. This duty is especially enjoined upon those endowed with the talent of teaching, so that they may bring light to the naïve or less astute. Rhetoric is the handmaiden of exegetical truth-find- ing. Augustine's rhetorical system, which builds upon Greco-Roman mod- els, subordinates the speaking arts to Biblical exegesis. In Of Christian Doc- trine &gt; rhetoric is superseded by homiletics, which becomes a tool for dissem- inating logocentric philosophy, but never a means of finding truth in lan- guage. Although he professes no confidence in Augustine's word-made-flesh, Derrida occasionally slips into "the error" of metaphysics for his readers' sakes because he imagines that they are not up to his expert level. Derrida reluc- tantly indulges his readers' unhealthy taste for metaphysics, so that he may teach them a needed lesson. Some of Derrida's readers may nonetheless wonder if he adopts the mantle of don in Specters of Marx for less charitable reasons (quite possibly from their past readings of Derrida), just as they may resent being extended this rather burdensome gift, knowing very well that such gifts entail costly obligations. Derrida welcomes a certain foreign inter- locutor by inviting him or her to take a seat upon the arid soil of the desert and listen to the words of the one who claims to have laid down his weap- ons ("Marx &amp; Sons" 214). Derrida comes to the Abrahamie rug as messian- ic rabh (but also the jewgreek guide who is willing to lead) addressing dis- abled or youthful disciples. However, his strategic assumption of the world- weary teacherly role implies an unequal relation in the exchange with the</page><page sequence="14">86 Christopher Wise other, whom he imagines to be a guileless student of Marxism. In Specters of Marx , Derrida's conversation with the other is not an exchange between equals but between the one-who-knows and the ones-who-dont-know, but who might possibly be set upon the right path. The one-who-knows de- mands unconditional submission of his potential disciples, especially to his unique messianic ideal, which is the unalterable condition of a "re-politici- zation," or the condition that will "always remain" ( Specters of Marx 75). Derrida plays the role of the rabh who lays down his weapons, but as a mere rhetorical strategy , for there is only a figurative invocation of the gesture of Abrahamie hospitality. In reality, the host claiming to be unarmed is the one who is in the possession of universal truth, the most deadly weapon of all. In Specters of Marx, messianic terminology is adopted for its "pedagogi- cal usefulness" ("Marx &amp; Sons" 254), which, in certain instances, Derrida claims is a "purely arbitrary" strategy (254), and, in other instances, the will- to-death in Abrahamie guise ( Specters of Marx 169). It may be useful in this context to remember that the pedagogue was originally a paid Greek slave who led boys by foot through the jostling streets of Athens [from the Greek paidagogos or pais "boy" and agogos , "leader," derived from agein, "to lead"] . The pedagogue's job was to walk the hapless boy to and from school, return- ing him to the safety of his home. Derrida adopts the role of the master will- ing to enslave himself for his readers. He offers his services in leading Marx- ism into the future, provided that certain conditions have been met (Specters of Marx 59). The most important of these conditions is that they adopt a "blind faith" in "messianicity"; but, Derrida is aware that such faith is not easy to come by, especially for scholars, intellectuals, and writers. Those who lack in "faith" must therefore seek to become like children, or possibly like the less educated and economically privileged, those "natural" folk who have not been spoiled by book knowledge. Derrida's Marxist auditors must become like the those "who [do] not know what the singularity of a position is" ( Specters of Marx 12); they must rid themselves of their cumbersome worldliness. Although Derrida typically makes only elliptical references to the State of Israel, it is significant that he does allegorize the relation between Shakes- peare s fictive Denmark and the economic situation of contemporary Den- mark. In an early footnote of Specters of Marx, Derrida speculates that the medieval kingdom of Denmark prefigures that of modern Denmark. In con- ceptualizing the possible "relation" between these two states, one fictive and the other historical, Derrida states, "Ought one to have recalled that in the West, near the end of the European peninsula, Denmark almost became, precisely along with England, the last State of resistance to a certain Europe, that of Maastricht?" ( Specters of Marx 178 fii 3). Derrida refers here to the modern state of Denmark's near refusal to join the Economic Union in Eu- rope that led to the introduction of the Euro. The implication is that because</page><page sequence="15">Derrida and Jerusalem 87 both England and Denmark are not fully connected in a geographical sense to the continent (or "body") of Europe, they may have been encouraged to imagine themselves as culturally separate from other European nation states, or at least they were more reluctant to join the "conspiracy" of the Europe- an Union. This remark is notable not only for its random if not flippant character - after all, what does Maastricht have to do with Hamlet? - but also because it reveals Derrida's willingness to extrapolate from the imaginary kingdom of the Shakespearean text to the real political entities of Denmark and England. Derrida therefore encourages us to believe that the kingdom of Denmark in Shakespeare's Hamlety as well as the capital city of Elsinore, may indeed be read as allegorical markers that illuminate the historical crises of contem- porary nation-states, particularly European ones that imagine they are geo- graphically, if not spiritually, separate from the continent. The question of Denmark's and Elsinore's allegorical potential is nonetheless deflected by Derrida, who quickly asserts, "No, this corollary of the royal head [i.e. Elsi- nore as medieval capital of Denmark] would be oriented toward other plac- es" ( Specters of Marx 178 fh 3, emphasis added). Derrida declines to inform his readers where these "other places" might be. One wonders, for instance, what ostensibly European nation-states may exist that are not fully connected to the continental body? Derrida will, however, offer further elliptical spec- ulations regarding "a certain figure of the head" (emphasis added), which is simultaneously described as "capital," "chief," and mere "head" ( Specters of Marx 178 fn 3). The problem of the figurative capital, which Derrida will only refer to in ellipses, is also the problem of "the war for Jerusalem," the figura- tive "head." We are also often reminded that the specter is a "revenant," or a thing that has returned ( Specters of Marx 11). The most powerful "revenant" in the world today is, of course, the Zionist revenant, or the Jerusalem fig- ure, which began by "returning" to claim a "certain" inheritance. "[A] spec- ter is always a revenant ," Derrida states, "One cannot control its comings and goings because it begins by coming back " ( Specters of Marx 1 1). As we have seen, Derrida evasively states that he is "undecided" about allegory ("Marx &amp; Sons" 246), but what he seems to mean is that, as is true of his "oscilla- tion" between Abrahamie messianism and "universal" messianicity, or be- tween two laws for two kinds of people, Christian-style allegories may be pressed into service in order to teach a lesson to certain kinds of people, but they must be categorically eschewed in the company of those who know better, or, among those who already belong to the block of the faithful. The third level of patristic hermeneutics, the "ethical" or "moral" meaning of biblical scripture, is important insofar as it reveals to the community of true believers what must be done: or, it enables the practical implementation of scripture in daily life. Derrida encourages his own readers to consider Shake-</page><page sequence="16">88 Christopher Wise speares capital of Elsinore as a "corollary on the royal head" that is "orient- ed towards other places" ( Specters of Marx 178 fn 3). The term "corollary" is worth repeating here because it demonstrates Derridas view that his read- ers should themselves logically infer the location he implies but dare not utter. Like the Christian fathers with their polysémie Bible, Derrida implements the ambiguous Shakespearean text within a social context that is radically different from its proper historical context so that a lesson might be taught. The case of Elsinore, a fictional setting with no obvious connection to the historical "capital" of Jerusalem, is set before Derridas readers to elicit their judgment about the modern State of Israel. If allegory in this sense slightly differs from Christian parable, at least in popular usage (the OED defines the former as "extended simile" and the latter as "extended metaphor"), they both share a common didactic function; that is, allegory is only apparently less didactic than parable; for, in the end, "ev- ery parable is an allegory and every allegory a parable" (Fowler Modern En- glish Usage 558). Like the "horrible being" deemed fit for deconstructive ex- orcism, Derrida teaches those Marxists assembled through parable, or he is most "Christian" when teaching edifying lessons about the Jewish state. The other's difference in this instance is so vast, his intellect so blunted, that he must be lent a hand in an act of Christian "charity" (caritas). To teach the Marxists a lesson, the failed political conspiracy of Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus becomes a model of praxis for disoriented Marxists in the era of the New World Order, most particularly with reference to the State of Israel. Derrida not only theorizes about the crises of the Middle East, he summons through incantation of ritual formulae a host of religious figures in a public assembly of Marxist scholars for whom he volunteers to become a leader or pedagogical guide. If Derrida must be left to his alterity, Derrida himself does not allow the Christian and Muslim other to be fully other, not only with reference to "uni- versal" messianicity but also the "symptomatic figure" of Jerusalem. Derri- da erroneously assumes that the religious obsession for Jerusalem is identi- cal for Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike rather than endemic to Zionists. In Specters of Marx, a hypostasis of the Jerusalem figure indeed occurs, al- though for allegedly "pedagogical" reasons. This is not by any means a nec- essary hypostasis, but its existence indicates a definite betrayal of deconstruc- tion rather than its "disguised" ontological character, coterminous with messianicity, or the will-to-death. Derrida valorizes a "certain" Marx - the Marx who is secretly Derrida - while stigmatizing another, the Marx who is a closet idealist. Although a "logocentric" or "heathen" Marx, this other Marx may still be "saved" if converted to a prototypicial thinker of technics. As with the Augustinián system, once exegetical meaning is ascertained in Derridas allegorical model, it must be taught to the less experienced or astute; in this</page><page sequence="17">Derrida and Jerusalem 89 case, however, its central mechanism is not charity (or caritas) but messian- icity (or "universal" faith). In other words, Derrida occasionally authorizes the hypostasis of certain figures on behalf of the incompetent reader. Final- ly, Derrida implies that the fictional capital of Elsinore and the kingdom of Denmark in Shakespeare's Hamlet prefigure the modern nation state of Is- rael and its imaginary political capital Jerusalem - for Palestinians, the cap- ital city of Al-Quds. In "Marx &amp; Sons," as we have seen, Derrida adopts a rhetoric of disarmament, stating that he prefers to come "disarmed" before his Marxist critics. However, no laying down of weapons occurs, merely a fiddling with his visors (or theoretical "problematics") especially to intimi- date his audience. Derrida remains fully armed before his interlocutors, who must recognize a ruse, a veiled war strategy. Western Washington University NOTES though I cannot fully explore this question here, my argument presupposes that deconstruction draws from pre-Platonic and non-European thought systems that have had an enduring influence on Africa and the Middle East, most obviously Egyp- tian and Judaic orientations to language that do not posit any bifurcation between the spheres of unreal appearance and absent Ideal. It is not then incidental that Derrida's overturning of Western metaphysics takes its impetus from Egyptian my- thologies of writing's origin with special reference to ibis-headed Thoth, the Egyp- tian god said to have invented writing (see Dissemination [ 1975] , especially the chap- ter "Plato's Pharmacy," and Of Grammatology [ 1972] ). In this sense, Negri and Ma- cherey s categorical refusal to entertain the possibility that there may be coherent alternatives to Western modes of theorizing the real can be seen as a form of cultur- al myopia, if not arrogance. See my forthcoming paper "Nyama and Heka: African Concepts of the Word." Also see Susan Handlemans The Slayers of Moses (1982). 2See Christopher Wise's "Jameson / Frye / Medieval Hermeneutics," Christianity and Literature , Vol. 41, No. 3 (Spring 1992): 313-33. 3In Mimesis , Eric Auerbach has distinguished between figurative and allegorical interpretation. For Auerbach, "an event taken as a figure preserves its literal and his- torical meaning" ( Mimesis 1 95-96) . By way of contrast, "allegory" for Auerbach tends to refer to highly spiritualized interpretations of the Biblical text of late antiquity and the Middle Ages that failed to respect the level of the etiological. In this essay, my own use of the term "allegory" is synonymous with what Auerbach calls the "figu- rative realism" of Tertullian, Jerome, and Augustine. What Auerbach calls "allegory" is more closely akin to Rabbinic approaches to the text, preferred by Derrida in al- most all other circumstances. 4The conjuration process described by Derrida in Specters of Marx is a variety of</page><page sequence="18">90 Christopher Wise synesthesia wherein spirits, or invisible words that are spoken and destined for the ear, evoke the apparition of specters, or visible images that are destined for the eye. Derrida never claims that mystical or hallucinatory events of this order happen, merely that religious conspiracy depends upon them: "One will never be able to prove that it happened, but only swear that it did [i.e. the oath sworn on the sword of Hamleťs father]," Derrida states. "Perjury must remain possible. That's a duty that must be respected [Derrida's emphasis]" (Veils 83-84). Derrida's theory of conjura- tion is actually a veiled critique of the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation. 5U.N. Resolutions relating to the U.N.'s opposition of the illegal Israeli occupa- tion of Jerusalem since June 5, 1967 include: Resolution 2253 (ES-V) of the General Assembly, dated July 4, 1967; Resolution 2254 (ES-V) of the General Assemby, dat- ed July 14, 1967; Resolution 252 of the Security Council, dated May 21, 1968; Reso- lution 267 of the Security Council, dated July 3, 1969; Resolution 271 of the Securi- ty Council, dated September 15, 1969; Resolution 298 of the Security Council, dat- ed September 25, 1971; Resolution of the General Assembly (32/5), dated October 28, 1977; and Resolution 446 of the Security Council, dated March 22, 1979. 6Judaism also affirms figurative interpretation of the heart's circumcision. When the human heart becomes hardened, as in the case of the Pharaoh in Exodus, God is implored to "circumcise" or remove the outward shell of the heart of the believer. 7Richard Popkin and David Katz trace the fascinating history of messianism in American culture in their Messianic Revolution : Radical Religious Politics to the End of the Second Millenium (1998). Popkin and Katz's study implies the need for fur- ther comparative analysis of messianism in the Occupied Territories and the Unit- ed States. Christians are similarly charged with altering the revealed teachings of "The Prophet Jesus." For instance, when Jesus promises that a "comforter" will be sent in his wake, Muslims believe that Christians either altered or misconstrued his origi- nal meaning. This belief is held because the Aramaic word for "Paraclete" - under- stood by Christians to mean the "Holy Spirit" - is "Ahmed," which is one of the names of Muhammad. The Islamic view generally accords with the critique of the Trinity that pervades the teachings of the Qur'an. 9In his book Imperial Israel and the Palestinians (2000), Nur Masala comments on recent efforts of Rabbi Eli'ezer Waldenberg and others to apply halacha prohibi- tion on non- Jews living in Jerusalem. Masala comments: "The implications of these ideas and actions are crystal clear: if Christian Arabs are practicing a form of 'idol worshipping,' and if the Palestinians, Christian and Muslim, are to be discouraged from living in Jerusalem and are to be subjected to the Torah laws of 'resident alien' (a status that is extremely unlikely to be acceptable to the Palestinians) then expul- sion becomes a logical conclusion for the political messianics" (128-29). More sig- nificantly, it is important to remember that Israeli citizenship hinges upon one's tribal affiliation, which is sometimes described as an ethnic identity, sometimes a religious belief, and sometimes both at the same time. In other words, "citizenship" in Israel is not defined on the basis of where one happens to reside, as is the case of Liberal Democratic nations like the United States, France, Britain, etc., but what one's eth- no-religious identity happens to be. Israel's emphatically anti-Liberal legal system insures that Arabs are denied full civil rights as Israeli "citizens."</page><page sequence="19">Derrida and Jerusalem 91 WORKS CITED Auerbach, Eric.
