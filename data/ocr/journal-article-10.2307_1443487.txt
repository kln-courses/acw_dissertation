<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS AND COMMENTS THE AMATEUR ZOOLOGIST'S GUIDE TO TURTLES AND CROCODILES. By Robert T. Zappalorti. Stackpole Books, Cameron and Kelker Streets, Harrisburg, PA 17105. 208 pp., 138 figs. (44 color), $12.95.-The amateur zool- ogist, young or old, will find this book informa- tive in both text and illustrations. The author uses many personal experiences to amplify the ecological and behavioral traits of the croco- dilians and turtles while making a plea for their conservation. The crocodilians make up the first of three parts to this book, the turtles the second, while the third consists of appendicies listing herpe- tological societies, herpetological terms, metric and temperature conversion tables and litera- ture cited; the latter does not list certain refer- ences given in the text. The tuatara and its habits are briefly de- scribed. The crocodilians are treated in length with a list of the living species in the world. The turtles are covered as snapping turtles, musk and mud turtles, aquatic, semiaquatic and box turtles, desert and gopher tortoises, sea turtles, and soft-shelled turtles, and care of pet turtles and tortoises. The discussions treat the turtles at the species level or a particular sub- species most familiar to the author. As the title indicates, this book will be an aid and stimulus to the amateur zoologist, but I am sure many experienced herpetologists will find useful information in the author's experi- ences and will find the illustrations helpful.- CHARLES C.

McClelland and Stewart, Ltd., 25 Hollinger Rd., Toronto, Ontario, M4B 3G2, Canada. 120 pp., 50 figs. (16 color), $8.95.-This small, attractively composed book is quite liter- ally the product of a long-protracted labor of love. To those who have never been exposed to the endearing qualities of captive ("pet") turtles, the affection they elicit from their owners is a bit bewildering, and the often sentimental, anthropomorphic accounts of these relationships are frequently regarded as shallowly emotional and somewhat abnormal. Far too many people react the same, intrigued way to turtles, how- ever, to justify categorization of cheloniophilia as anything except typical when circumstances are favorable. It is nevertheless seldom indeed that a healthy concern for turtles, which Froom certainly has, is carried to such a level of sophis- tication as is documented in the present book. Tapping extremely varied sources of informa- tion, including a very considerable personal experience maintaining turtles in captivity and acting as one of Canada's few professional her- petologists, the author (who founded and has been the primary impetus for the Canadian Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Society, Canada's only herpetological association) has aimed in this book to present a balanced per- spective of turtles for the non-specialist: 1) an aid to identification of Canada's 10 inland and 4 sea turtle species; 2) a summary of salient background information on turtles in general; 3) a more detailed specification of habitat, habits, characteristics and distribution of each of the Canadian species; and 4) a guide to the care of turtles in captivity. Overall, the objec- tive has been to evoke interest in and concern for turtles as broadly as possible; without them conservation is not possible, and conservation is never far from uppermost in the author's mind. Such concern is a ready product of the marginal existence eked out by all reptiles, including turtles, in the rigorous climate characteristic of Canada. All 14 species treated are illustrated by color- photo reproductions of exceptionally high qual- ity, as well as by a number of black and white photographs. Nine chapters concern 1) the origin of turtles; 2) myth and legend; 3) physi- cal characteristics and adaptations; 4) large turtles (Chelydra s. serpentina, Trionyx s. spi- niferus); 5) medium turtles (Chrysemys picta of 3 subspp., Malaclemys geographica, Emys bland- ingi, Clemmys insculpta, Terrapene c. carolina); 6) small turtles (Clemmys m. marmorata, C. gut- tata, Sternotherus odoratus); 7) sea turtles (Che- lonia mydas agassizi, Lepidochelys olivacea kempi, Caretta c. caretta, Dermochelys coriacea of 2 subspp.); 8) turtles as pets; and 9) con- servation of turtles. A 2-page list of 21 varied references on turtles terminates the book. 843</page></plain_text>
