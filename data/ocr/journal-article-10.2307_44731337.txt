Warner, Douglas "L" Allsop, and Thomas R. Perl Collision Safety Engineering, Inc. ABSTRACT Occupant simulation models have been used to study trends or specific design changes in "typical" accident modes such as frontal, side, rear, and rollover. This paper explores the usage of the Articulated Total Body Program (ATB) as an accident reconstruction tool. The importance of model validation is discussed. Specific areas of concern such as the contact model, force-deflection data, occupant parameters, restraint system models, head/neck loadings, padding, and intrusion are discussed in the context of accident reconstruction. INTRODUCTION The Articulated Total Body (ATB) program is also known as Crash Victim Simulator (CVS); it is the forerunner of another program called DYNAMAN. CVS was originally developed in the early 1970's at Calspan under NHTSA sponsorship. During the 1980's it was enhanced for use by the Air Force, and was re-named Articulated Total Body. Additional improvements and enhancements have continued to be made over the years. In 1989, GESAC, Inc. adapted ATB version IV.2 to run on personal computers. They also developed a user-friendly pre-processor and post-processor. This package is called DYNAMAN and is commercially available. In this paper, ATB refers also to CVS and DYNAMAN. ATB is a general purpose lumped mass program. It can be used as a three-dimensional occupant simulation program by 1) creating "occupant" body parts of lumped mass ellipsoids connected together by joints, 2) building a "vehicle" by defining contact surfaces and ellipses, and then 3) specifying motion for the "vehicle." Each occupant body part consists of a lumped mass at a given location and a skin of elliptical shape. This is used to define contact between other ellipses and contact planes. The occupant body parts are interconnected by joints with defined properties which restrict the motion of the joint. The program calculates when and where contacts occur between the various ellipsoids &amp; planes and applies forces as a result of those contacts. The occupant is displaced inertially and by the application of these contact forces. ?» ATB is an initial value simulation program. The input parameters are used to describe the initial occupant kinematics and contact parameters. The output of the first time step becomes the input for the second time step. This process continues through many iterations. As with all initial value programs, small errors in the input values can propagate or grow as the program goes through a large number of iterations. The ATB program has undergone, and continues to undergo, changes and improvements [Fleck, 1991]. Some of these modifications are proprietary and are not publicly available [Deng, 1990, Prasad, 1993, Grew, 1985]. Most modifications were made in order to achieve reasonable simulations for specific applications. When reviewing the literature it is important to note that not all studies are using the same version of the program. In 1996, and ATB users group was officially formed to help users learn more about ATB, make them aware of new innovative modeling techniques, new applications, peripheral programs, problems and remedies. The program is relatively complex to use. A typical input file contains 3000 to 7000 parameters. The appropriate values for many of these input parameters are not readily available. There are no recognized "default" or "typical" values. In practice, an existing input file is usually modified to fit the new application rather than creating a new input file from scratch. The input values in the existing files are often used when specific data for the new application are not available, even though the source of the existing data is often not known. Most of these data are not physically measured values, but are values which "seemed to work" in a prior simulation. Reliable input data are very sparse. DESIGN PROCESS Occupant simulation programs, such as ATB, can be very powerful tools when integrated into the design process. Once validated, they can be used to evaluate the effects of 1918</page><page sequence="2">parameter changes on the system response and substantially reduce the number of sled tests or full scale crash tests in a design or research project. They can be versatile and economical engineering tools. For example, British Leyland used a modified version of ATB as a design tool for optimizing the three-point restraint system in a pre-production vehicle [Grew, 1985]. Sled and component tests were run and the appropriate input and output parameters for the model were measured. The input parameters were then adjusted within a reasonable range until the sled test was simulated. Modifications to the restraint system were then made in the model and the corresponding effects were evaluated. Based on the modified simulations, a second sled test was run with a modified restraint system. The inputs were then adjusted to get the best simulation for both sled tests. Further optimization of the model led to additional modifications of the restraint system. Additional sled tests were run to verify the effects of these modifications. Eventually, a well validated computer simulation was developed allowing the design parameters to be better understood. As the researchers pointed out, the tests established and validated the model, while the model helped to interpret the test results and insure that unnecessary testing was avoided [Grew, 1985]. In another research project, the dangers of invalidated modelling were pointed out. There, researchers attempted to develop an occupant simulation model of an unrestrained occupant in a frontal impact (using MVMA 2-D). Difficulties with determining appropriate input parameters led to the conclusion that "it is dangerous to draw conclusions from the model without having convinced oneself that the model matches up well with test results in a situation which is not too much different from the one under consideration" [Forrest, 1984]. In other words, validation is an important part of the application of occupant simulations in the design process. VALIDATION The crux of every mathematical modeling endeavor is validation. Validation is the process of establishing how well the predictions of a simulation agree with reality. The usefulness of a computer simulation depends on the extent to which it has been validated. Validation can be a difficult and time-consuming task for a complex simulation program such as ATB. A computer simulation cannot completely model every aspect and detail of a real event because of the innumerable complex physical events taking place. Simplifying assumptions must be made. Therefore, model validation is not a black and white issue; there are levels of confidence associated with each validation effort. In reviewing the ATB literature, one finds different usages of the term "validation". It has been used to describe the program code as "working," i.e., that the code does not have any programming bugs and produces output that is not random. The more proper use of the term "validation" is demonstrating a specific application of the program properly simulates real physical events such as crash tests or sled tests. Fleck and Segal made this distinction by using the terms verification and validation. They verified that the ATB program ran without crashing and produced output that was reasonably related to the input. However they were unable to accurately model a real event using the ATB program [Fleck, 1982, Segal, 1984]. Since ATB has not been validated in general, it must be uniquely validated for each specific application in order for the results to have scientific meaning. Validation requires well documented crash test or sled test data to (1) establish the ATB input parameters, and (2) provide a basis forjudging the reasonableness of ATB program output values. There are difficulties in obtaining appropriate test data for validation because many of the ATB input and output parameters are not routinely measured in crash tests or sled tests. In fact, some of the parameters cannot be directly measured and must be inferred from other measured data. A true validation protocol requires that the input values be measured independently from the test that is being simulated. For example, input parameters measured from a series of bench or component tests might be compiled to create an input file that represents the actual test to be simulated. This is difficult with complex programs such as ATB, because some inputs cannot be directly measured in component tests. Therefore, such programs are often validated using a pair of full scale tests which are very similar. The first test is used to "calibrate" the model by adjusting the input values within reasonable limits until the measured loads and occupant kinematics from the first test are accurately simulated. The validation simulation is then made by changing only those inputs which represent the differences between the two tests (such as the crash pulse). The second simulation is then compared to the second actual test to determine whether validation has been achieved. If only trends in "typical" impact modes are to be evaluated, a less stringent validation protocol may be sufficient. For example, a protocol of accurately simulating just one test has been used in some research applications. This procedure can be criticized as being merely a curve fitting project, i.e., showing that the program can generate curves to match the experimental data. There are likely multiple combinations of reasonable input data that could be used with the program to match the experimental curves. Before relying on the results of a study validated in this manner, additional full scale testing ought to be done. Validation is difficult when reconstructing real world accidents because there is rarely a well documented full scale test with which to compare the simulation output. Sometimes claims of "validation" have been made by matching the injuries in a real world accident to injury threshold values in the simulation. This approach has several problems. First, the program is generally not able to accurately predict injury measures in actual tests. Its predictive power is limited to gross occupant motion. Second, the relationship between dummy injury measures and actual human injuries is not well established for individual exposures. Third, the simulation often requires unreasonable or arbitrary input values in order to predict the injury exposure seen in the accident. Tweaking 1919</page><page sequence="3">variables beyond acceptable ranges so the program matches a known injury is not a scientific endeavor and can result in conclusions that are erroneous and misleading. Robbins [1989] presented a useful method of quantifying levels of validations in the form of the "Proposed Validation Index" developed by the Human Biomechanics and Simulation Standards Committee of SAE (see Table 1). He noted that for a simulation to be useful as a design parameter trend indicator, a validation level 5 is generally considered sufficient. This level of validation has not been achieved in published efforts using the ATB program [Kaleps, 1982, Smith, 1993, Ma, 1995]. Validation of ATB simulations has traditionally been difficult because of limitations of the program. More sophisticated occupant motion simulation programs, such as MADYMO and finite element impact models, have had much greater success. [MADYMO, 1990 Barbat 1995, Chang, 1994]. As occupant motion simulation programs continue to develop and achieve validation in the research arena, their use will naturally spread to accident reconstruction. However, strict validation will always be a problem when simulating real world accidents without test data for comparison. In the absence of proper validation, a few keys can be used to evaluate how well a simulation matches an actual accident. First, there should be no obvious errors in the input file, such as improper vehicle geometry, missing contact parameters, occupant motions beyond the capability of the human body, etc. Second, the output must reasonably match the known facts of the accident. Third, the output must not violate the laws of physics. (There are no internal checks within the ATB program to verify consistency with laws of motion or physics.) Fourth, the simulation must actually be modeling what the user intends it to model. When the user focuses on certain output values and adjusts the inputs until those desired outputs are achieved, the simulation oftentimes will be doing things inconsistent with the initial modeling goal. Fifth, one must consider all of the outputs of the simulation: focusing on certain output parameters while ignoring others is bad science. While it is difficult to create an ATB simulation of a real world accident using reasonable input values that match the physical evidence and comply with the laws of physics, simulations that achieve these criteria may add insights in evaluating real- world accidents, even without formal validation. VALIDATION ATTEMPTS Some of the problems experienced while using the ATB program can be illustrated by examining two independent attempts to validate a new data set developed to represent the Hybrid III crash test dummy. One attempt was by Obergefell, et al. [1988], the other was by Khatua, et al. [1988]. Both used frontal sled test data from a series of three tests run by Prasad [Prasad, 90]. Each sled test used two dummies; one Hybrid II (H2) dummy and one Hybrid III (H3) dummy. The sled buck consisted of a plywood seat, toe-board and floorboard, and a 3-point restraint system. The use of plywood surfaces minimized the effect of difficult-to-measure force-deflection functions. The lack of any dashboard, steering wheel, or windshield, eliminated the effect of additional contacts. Obergefell attempted to validate both the H2 and H3 data sets using a single frontal sled test. This was not a validation in the strict sense because only one sled test was simulated; it was really an exercise in calibrating the model to match the experimental results of the single sled test. The H2 data set was constructed by Fleck [1982] and consists of 15 ellipsoids. The H3 data set was constructed by Kaleps [1988], and consists of 17 ellipsoids, the same ellipsoids as the 15 in the H2 data set, with the addition of hands. Obergefell modified both the H2 and H3 data sets by adding two additional massless contact ellipsoids, one at the upper torso and one at the lower torso. These additional ellipsoids did not alter the mass or inertial characteristics of the dummy but were added to provide a more realistic geometry for the belts to contact. The seat belt webbing stiffness and friction coefficients were not independently measured. The input parameters were simply adjusted to values which seemed to provide the best fit with the experimental data. The gross occupant motion was assessed by comparing the high speed film to the simulation's graphical output. Both the H2 and the H3 simulations had occupant motion similar to the test data during the initial part of the event. However, the motion in both simulations began to deviate from the test as the event progressed. The simulation's acceleration data for the head, chest and pelvis, also matched the test data reasonably well early in the event, but then developed substantial deviation. The match of head acceleration was much worse than that of the chest and pelvis acceleration. Neck forces were not reported. Interestingly, the older H2 data set matched the experimental data better than the newer H3 data set, even though the H3 data set was derived using more precise measurements of the dummy. The inability of the simulations to match the experimental data was attributed to difficulties with the belt model. The authors noted that even small changes in the belt parameters significantly affected the simulated occupant motion. Since the sled test belt forces were the most significant forces acting on the dummy, the belt model was clearly critical to simulating the dummy motion. However, the belt parameters were not independently measured in this exercise; the indication being that the model was simply not capable of matching the experimental data. Khatua, et al. [1988] attempted to validate the same H3 data set using a pair of sled tests from the same series by Prasad. However, a more rigorous validation protocol was followed; the first sled test was used to calibrate the model and the second test was used for validation. Force-deflection data were independently measured by statically pressing the lower torso into a plywood seat cushion. The lap belt characteristics were measured by pushing the H3 dummy against the lap belt 1920</page><page sequence="4">TABLE 1 - PROPOSED VALIDATION INDEX Level 0 No agreement between predictions of model and a "reference event." Level 1 Qualitative Agreement a. Trends of predicted parameters same. b. Kinematics correspond qualitatively. c. Contacts between occupant and vehicle interior are the same in general. Level 2 HIC and similar indicators predicted by simulation are within 20% of those obtained in reference event. Level 3 Peak values of important occupant responses limited to a relative error of 20% (20% on vector magnitude, 11.31 degrees on vector direction). Level 4 Same as above except 5%. Level 5 Timing of peaks of important vector responses limited to 5% relative. Level 6 All peaks and valleys in the duration of time-dependent predictions must match the reference event within 10%. Level 7 Same as 6 except 5%. Level 8 1% relative error, point by point, over the duration of the reference and predicted event. in a quasi-static fashion. A generic dynamic amplification factor of 1 .25 was applied to the measured data. The shoulder belt characteristics were not directly measured, but were adjusted to provide the best fit with the experimental chest acceleration and shoulder belt load data. Certain adjustments were required in the H3 data set in order to simulate the "calibration" test. The model predicted substantial bending at the occupant's waist. No such bending was seen in the films. The bending was eliminated by locking the joint between the middle and lower torso. The head and neck motion in the simulation indicated that the neck stiffness parameters in the model were too stiff by a factor of 8. The neck stiffness was reduced to one-eighth of its original value for neck rotations up to an angle of 10 degrees, and then increased to its original value at 20 degrees of rotation. Even with these modifications, the head motion of the calibration test was not accurately simulated because the neck parameters did not include energy absorption (the reason for this is discussed later in this paper). The knee joint values resulted in simulated femur forces that were too low, but attempts to find a combination of parameters that more accurately simulated the test results were unsuccessful. Once the input parameters had been adjusted in the calibration run to give the best possible match to the test data, the crash pulse was modified to that of the second sled test. The validity of the model was then determined by comparing the second sled test to the validation simulation. The chest accelerations and the shoulder belt forces were in reasonably good agreement, which is to be expected since the shoulder belt parameters had not been independently measured, but had been adjusted to give the best fit in the calibration run. The head accelerations, however, were too high and the lap belt forces were not reasonable. It was concluded that the simulation results did not fully agree with the test results and that the measured stiffness values in the H3 data set for the neck joints, torso joints and knee joints needed to be re- evaluated. Neither of these attempts to validate the new H3 data set were successful. Obergefell concluded that the data set was probably valid, and the belt model was responsible for the bad results. Khatua concluded that the data set was the problem. It is likely that there are problems with both the data set and the belt model, in addition to other limitations inherent in the program. The remainder of this paper will explain some of the difficulties in validating the ATB program for even simple frontal sled tests. These limitations exacerbate the difficulty in attempting to simulate a real- world accident. MODEL LIMITATIONS With any math model, it is necessary to understand the underlying equations, assumptions, and simplifications in order to evaluate the validity of the output. The more complex the model, the more important this understanding is. This paper does not address all the inner workings of ATB in detail, but presents a description of specific factors which clarify the difficulties in validating simulations for reconstructing accidents. CONTACT MODEL - The ATB contact model is what "drives" the program. It computes the contact forces which act on the occupant and produce the occupant motion. It is a simplistic model of what is in reality a very complex 1921</page><page sequence="5">event. Even though the ATB program simulates occupant motion in three dimensions, the contact model is essentially one-dimensional. The user must define a set of "allowable contacts" between the various body segments and vehicle surfaces. Each individual contact definition specifies the force vs. deflection properties which govern that contact. Contact is deemed to occur when an ellipsoid of the occupant intersects a vehicle surface. If a contact is not defined between a specific body segment and vehicle surface, the body segment will pass through that part of the vehicle structure as if it did not exist. Even when the contact has been defined, the ellipsoids and planes do not deform, they still pass through each other, but the geometry of the overlap is used to determine three aspects of the contact: depth of penetration, direction of force application and the point of force application. Penetration is defined as the perpendicular distance from the plane to the deepest point on the overlapping ellipsoid (Figure 1). The magnitude of the contact force is determined by applying the depth of penetration to a user- defined force-deflection function. For oblique contacts, this is not the actual length of deflection. Therefore, force-deflection data measured in perpendicular tests will not appropriately represent contacts at oblique angles. A single force-deflection function represents the mutual crush of both surfaces. If separate data for the vehicle component and the body segment are available, they must be combined to form a single function for use in the model. Ignoring the compliance of the body segment is equivalent to modeling a rigid occupant, which will result in erroneous occupant accelerations and joint forces. i ' /- CENTER OF ELLIPSE DEFINED CENTER OF Y /- BY THE INTERSECTION OF THE ĘĄŁIPSOID -y /' ELLIPSOID AND THE PLANE ANYWHERE ALONG THIS LINE PERPENDICULAR MAXIMUM / TO PLANE PENETRATION - ' FIGUREI The contact force is the resultant of the normal and the friction components. The normal component is always perpendicular to the contact plane. The frictional force is parallel to the plane and directed so as to oppose the ellipsoid's motion. Its magnitude is a function of the normal force. When the magnitude is modeled as being directly proportional to the normal force, the direction of the resultant contact force will be at a constant angle relative to the plane (Figure 2). This does not appropriately describe the pocketing effect which often occurs when body parts contact deformable surfaces and the direction of the contact force changes as the deformation increases.

The location of the force application can be defined by the user anywhere along the line connecting the point of maximum penetration on the ellipsoid and the centroid of the ellipse created by the ellipsoid/plane intersection (Figure 1). The location of the force application remains constant for all magnitudes of deflection. It should be chosen based on how much each of the two surfaces deform. For example, if a rigid head form contacts a soft dashboard, the contact force should be applied closer to the surface of the head form (Figure 3a). Whereas, a deformable abdomen contacting a stiff, unyielding plane would be better modeled by choosing the point of force application closer to the surface of the plane (Figure 3b). For contacts where there is deformation of both the plane and the ellipsoid, care must be taken in defining the point of force application, especially when large deformations occur. The contact model used in ATB has difficulty when ellipsoids contact narrow planes or the edge of larger planes. There are several program options from which the user may choose. The default option results in no contact force unless the center of the ellipse defined by the intersection of the ellipsoid and the plane is within the plane boundary. This can result in very unrealistic results because the contact force can change instantly from a high value to zero as the center of the ellipse moves beyond the edge of the plane. Another option treats the plane as if it were infinitely large as long as any part of the ellipsoid intersects it within the original plane 1922</page><page sequence="6">RIGID HEAD FORM SOFTDASHBOARD POINT OF FORGB ^ APPLICATION FIGURE 3A / DEFORMABLE ' I ABDOMEN j RIGID PLANB " POINT OFFORCE - APPLICATION FIGURE 3B boundaries. The third option reduces the magnitude of the contact force proportionately to the area of the intersection; however, the direction of the contact force is not modified. None of these program options adequately models the true interaction between a body segment, such as the head and narrow vehicle surfaces like the A pillar or steering wheel rim. Creative modeling by the user, however, can be used in some circumstances to overcome this program limitation. FORCE-DEFLECTION DATA - When defining an ATB input file, every potential occupant segment/vehicle surface contact must be individually defined. If no definition is made, the occupant segment will pass through the plane as if it was not present. Since a single force-deflection function is used to define the mutual deformation of both surfaces, different force-deflection functions are necessary to define the contact between the same vehicle surface and the various occupant segments. Very few data are available to characterize these force-deflection properties. They are different for each vehicle make and model, and they are difficult to measure. Segal developed a test methodology to statically and dynamically measure properties for several vehicles [Segal 87]. It was hoped that "generic" values could be developed for use in many applications. Unfortunately, the testing indicated a wide range of stiffness values that were very sensitive to slight variations. Interior surfaces of 19 different automobiles were tested using both static and dynamic tests. "Typical" or "average" stiffness characteristic for vehicle interior surfaces could not be determined. They also found that static tests were not representative of dynamic tests, and that there was no consistent amplification factor which could be used to convert static test results to dynamic force levels. Small changes in the direction of loading and the specific location of loading resulted in large variations of measured force-deflection properties. One cannot expect accurate simulations using generic force-deflection values. Even force-deflection values which have been established for a specific area of a specific vehicle can have substantial variations depending on the location of loading, the angle of loading, and the rate of loading. This extreme variability is one of the most significant problems with using ATB for accident reconstruction. It is not as significant a problem when using ATB as a design tool because the force-deflection values can be modified within reasonable limits until a fit with the test data is achieved. OCCUPANT PARAMETERS - An ATB occupant is represented by a group of ellipsoids connected together by joints. Each ellipsoid must be defined in terms of size, mass, location of the center of mass, moments of inertia, and joint locations. There are readily accessible sources of data which can be used to compile the ellipsoid data for standard crash test dummies, and also for various size occupants. As mentioned previously, Fleck [1982] has developed a data set for the Part 572 (Hybrid II) dummy and Kaleps developed a data set for the 50% Hybrid III dummy, with both the seated pelvis and the standing pelvis [Kaleps, 1988]. A program called GEBOD has been developed to create data sets for occupants of various sizes [Cheng, 1994]. The user specifies the occupant's height, weight, or both, and GEBOD will appropriately scale the relevant occupant parameters. The data for adults is based on surveys of Air Force personnel [Grunhofer, 1975, Clauser, 1972] as well as other Air Force studies [McConville, 1980, Young, 1983, Engin, 1987]. The data for children's sizes comes from the Snyder anthropometry for children [Snyder, 1977] and the joint torque data comes from Kaleps [1982]. Recently Ma, et al., developed a partial set of "human" joint parameters [Ma, 1995]. An undocumented set of "human like" joint parameters is included in GEBOD version 4.1. The joint parameters which are most critical in evaluating occupant injury exposure are also the most difficult to define; namely those characterizing the neck. Head and neck injuries represent the majority of injury in automobile impacts. However, accurately simulating head motion, and predicting head/neck loadings is an area of research that is still developing. The current ATB head/neck model consists of a rigid neck segment connected to the head and the upper torso with a pair of joints. The joints allow rotation between the neck and the adjacent segment, but there is no compliance in the axial or shear directions (Figure 4). Physical neck models, on the other hand, such as the Hybrid II and Hybrid III necks, 1923</page><page sequence="7">AXIAL COMPLIANCE SHEAR COMPLIANCE FIGURE 4 are flexible segments with a fixed attachment to the upper torso and limited joint rotation at the head attachment. The neck of the Hybrid II dummy consists of a single rubber cylinder with a cable running through the center axis. It has bending characteristics which are the same in each direction, i.e., flexion, extension and lateral bending can be modeled with the same characteristic. The human neck, however, does not have the same characteristic in each direction, so the Hybrid III dummy neck was designed to have resistance to extension motion be about half the resistance to flexion motion. It is constructed of six aluminum disks separated by rubber disks, held together by a cable running through the center of the structure. Cuts on the anterior portion of the rubber disks are used to create the different resistance to flexion and extension. Data sets of the H2 neck have been developed by Paver [1987] and Doherty [1986]. Several attempts have been made to create joint parameters to simulate the H3 neck [Kaleps, 1988, Doherty, 1987, Seemann, 1986, Wismans, 1988]. There is a particular problem, however, with modeling the Hybrid III neck. ATB allows joint characteristics to be defined by either an equation, or by specifying tabular data. When the equation method is used, damping properties can be defined, but only one equation can be used to specify the torque vs. angle characteristic for all directions of bending. When the tabular data method is used different characteristics can be defined for different direction of bending, but no damping can be modeled. The Hybrid II neck can be modeled using the equation method (because it has the same bending characteristic in each direction), and damping properties can be defined. However, the tabular method must be used to model the Hybrid III neck (because it has different bending characteristics) and damping properties cannot be defined. Head motion cannot be accurately simulated without the damping. The rigid neck model may, with proper evaluation, be used to simulate gross kinematics of head as long as the head does not hit anything. However, better models and more data are necessary before accurate simulations of head contact kinematics and forces can be achieved. A more sophisticated neck model for the ATB program has been developed by Deng [1989]. It more closely approximates the flexible H3 neck by treating each of the six aluminum disks as an individual ellipsoid. BELT RESTRAINT SYSTEMS - The ATB program has two options for modeling belt restraint systems: The "BELT ROUTINE" and the "HARNESS ROUTINE." The belt routine does not yield reasonable results in most situations, is generally not used, and will not be discussed [Deng, 1989, DYNAMAN User's Manual 2.3.2]. The harness routine is a more sophisticated model, but it is still incapable of accurately simulating occupant belt interactions in many situations. Each belt in the harness routine is modeled as a series of webbing segments that contact the occupant at user- specified points. The belt length is not a user input but is a function of the occupant's initial position and the belt anchorage locations. Additional webbing can be specified by adding belt slack. Using the harness routine in an accident reconstruction context can be misleading because some of the important input parameters are unknown, or cannot be measured directly, and the simulation output can be very sensitive to small changes in the inputs [Obergefell, 1986 ]. There are readily available data on seat belt webbing characteristics from standard elongation tests. Unfortunately, these data are not useful for ATB applications because the webbing stress-strain input parameter must account for several additional factors in addition to webbing stretch. For example, Deng [1988] modeled sled tests using independently measured webbing force versus strain characteristics. It was noted that the dummy motion in the sled tests was greater than what would have been expected based solely on the webbing stretch. Additional factors such as anchor deformation, retractor spool-out factors, and occupant compliance must be accounted for in order to correctly simulate the occupant motion. Shimamura, et al., [1987] used a series of bench tests to independently measure webbing strain, webbing unloading characteristics, retractor spool-out (film spool effect) and movement of webbing through the D ring. All of these effects were then combined into a single belt load versus strain characteristic. The retractor spool-out, or film spool effect, was directly related to both the webbing elongation characteristic and the length of webbing on the reel. These researchers note that it is also important to correctly define the hysteresis characteristics (webbing unloading curve) because the maximum occupant displacement occurs after the maximum belt load is achieved. Dummy (or occupant) compliance must also be accounted for in the belt model. The ATB code has the capability to independently define the compliance of the occupant, but this feature is infrequently used because it leads to numerical instabilities [Obergefell, 1992]. Modeling the upper torso as two separate ellipsoids connected by a spring- damper system can be used to account for chest compliance (and can also be used to determine chest compression and the VC criteria). The other alternative is to adjust the belt strain 1924</page><page sequence="8">characteristics to include the effect of occupant compliance. The same belt characteristics cannot be used for both the lap belt and the shoulder belt because of the differences in body segment stiffness and webbing length. One might be tempted to use the actual webbing stiffness values in the model and just add a few inches of belt slack to account for other factors. In practice this introduces additional errors because the occupant gets a running start at a stiff belt, resulting in unrealistically high belt loads which alters the occupant motion. The "softening" factors need to build up over time to realistically simulate the occupant motion. When using ATB in a design context, it is possible to simply adjust the belt input parameters within a reasonable range until the best fit is achieved with the test data. In an accident reconstruction context, it is not possible to do this because there is no test with which to compare, and the actual occupant motion and webbing loads are not known. PADDING - Head and neck loadings are difficult to model using ATB not only because of the neck model limitations, but also because of the difficulty ATB has simulating impacts with padded surfaces. Modeling the response of energy absorbing interior padding requires a more sophisticated contact model than that used by the ATB program; the impact algorithm must take into account both the deformation of the padded surface and the complex properties of the padding material. Padding materials are typically nonlinear and visco- elastic; their dynamic properties are strongly strain rate dependent. As a curved object such as the head impacts a padded surface, three things are happening: 1) the area of involved padding increases as the penetration progresses; 2) the strain rate decreases as the head is slowed by the padding; and 3) the stiffness of the padding increases as the material compresses. Therefore, at each instant there are different conditions for each location within the deforming pad material. The model cannot relate these changing factors without actually modeling the deforming padded surface. It is possible to simulate a specific test using ATB because the strain rate and force-deflection input can be matched, but those inputs are for a specific impact velocity and geometry, and are not valid for general application. A study by Orringer, et al. [1986], demonstrated the difficulties associated with developing accurate math models of energy absorbing interior padding materials. They developed two complex empirical models of padding materials for ATB. One model had nine parameters and the other model had twenty-one parameters. Even with these elaborate models, they had difficulty matching actual test data. Finite element analysis, however, has been shown to suitably model head impacts with energy absorbing interior padding materials [Barbat, 1995, Chang, 1994, Chou, 1995, Sherman, 1995]. Substantial improvements in ATB will be achieved as finite element neck models and finite element padded surfaces models are merged with the current program. However, until that occurs ATB is not capable of accurately simulating head impacts with padded surfaces. INTRUSION - The effects of intrusion on occupant response are receiving increased attention. ATB has the capability to model intruding surfaces, however ascertaining the intrusion experienced in a vehicle impact is a very difficult task. The program does not compute the intrusion motion. The user must specify the position of the intruding surface relative to the vehicle at specific times. This user input defines not only the magnitude or extent of the intrusion, but also the velocity of the intruding surface. There are very few test data with which to evaluate the velocity of intruding surfaces. Intrusion parameters are not commonly measured in crash tests and are difficult to measure using high speed film. When the intrusion deformation is the result of contact with a fixed object or the ground, the ATB intrusion input parameters must be carefully coordinated with the vehicle motion defined by the crash pulse. Without careful coordination, the intruding surface will simulate unrealistic contact velocities between the occupant and a surface that should have no velocity relative to the ground. When the intrusion deformation is the result of a car- to-car impact, the timing is critical. There is only a small window of time in which the intruding surface is moving. If occupant contact occurs within that window the contact velocity may be higher, resulting in higher forces and accelerations on the occupant. The simulation output will be very sensitive to slight changes in the inputs. In order to use the program to analyze intrusion, good test data is necessary to determine if the timing of the intrusion motion and the timing of occupant contacts are accurate. When reconstructing an actual accident the detailed information necessary to create an accurate intrusion simulation is almost never available. This does not completely preclude the study of initial gross occupant motion, but greatly hampers the reliability of the simulated occupant contact forces and the subsequent occupant motion due to contact with the intruding surface. As finite element models improve and become more accessible, reliable intrusion motion may become available for use in occupant motion simulations. CONCLUSIONS ATB can be a powerful tool in the design process when used in conjunction with a series of vehicle or sled tests. However, it is difficult to develop well validated simulations with only one or two tests. The predictive power of the program is generally limited to gross occupant motion. Factors which limit the accuracy of ATB simulations include the simplicity of the contact model, lack of reliable dynamic force-deflection data, limitations on occupant joint parameters, sensitivity of belt restraint model, and an inadequate neck model. Adjustments in the input parameters can sometimes be made to simulate specific tests. However, there are limitations to using the ATB program for reconstructing occupant kinematics in actual accidents. Some of these 1925</page><page sequence="9">limitations are due to modeling difficulties, and some are due to the inherent lack of data available with real world accidents. As research and development of occupant simulation programs, such as ATB, continues, the ability to model both test data and real world accidents will improve. Merging finite element codes with the existing ATB code may improve the accuracy of simulations in the future, given proper validation.
