<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE UNIVERSITY AS CLOISTER, GARDEN AND TREE OF KNOWLEDGE AN ICONOGRAPHIC INVENTION IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CUZCO Francisco Stastny EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY Cuzco was the centre of considerable intellectual and social unrest. During the first decades of the century the change of dynasty in Spain, and the weakening grip of the Viceregal system in the colonies, encouraged the aspirations of both the criollo aristocracy and of some sections of the native population. The former was basically motivated by economic interests and the desire to obtain new privileges; while the latter initiated a movement of greater ideological complexity.' The 'Republic of the Indians' was composed of two dissimilar groups: a minority of caciques and the taxed peasant masses. The Inca nobility, inspired by a utopian concept of the old Tahuantinsuyo Empire, promoted the ideal of a profound political transformation which would restore their usurped rights to the descendants of the ancient lords of the Andes.2 The political significance of the nativist movement has already been recognized, owing to the repercussions it had on the frequent Indian rebellions, which in 1780 culminated in the revolt led byJose Gabriel Condorcanqui. However, the impact of Inca nationalism upon the intellectual and artistic life of Cuzco and other cities of Viceregal Peru has not yet received the same attention.3 The arts played an important role in the ideological battles which developed.4 The Inca Renaissance not only generated considerable artistic output, but also provoked, in contrast, a systematic opposition, both from the Viceregal authorities and from the criollo groups, each of whom sought a way of expressing their views through the arts. The situation was further complicated by the fact that the aspirations of the criollos and of the Inca nobility had much the same purpose. Both aimed at lightening the burden of the Spanish yoke, though they differed radically in the nature of their claims. It is therefore not enough simply to categorize as either loyalist or nationalist the attitudes adopted in eighteenth-century Peru. One can perceive a variety of divergent attitudes among the latter in groups as dissimilar as the criollos, the mestizos, the Inca nationalists and the native peasantry, all opposed to Spanish rule. 1 There are very few specific studies about these subjects. See Michel Colin, Le Cuzco a lafin du XVIP et au dibut du XVIII siecle, Paris 1966; Jose Tamayo Herrera, Esbozo para una Historia de las ideas en el Cuzco, Cuzco 1972; and some general essays, e.g.Jorge Basadre, La multitud, la ciudady el campo en la historia del Peru, Lima 198o; Pablo Macera, Visidn histdrica del Peru, Lima 1978. 2John H.

Lothrop, Essays in Pre-Columbian Art and Archaeology, Cambridge, Mass. 1961, p. 327. There are hardly any studies at all on Viceregal Peruvian decorative arts. It is not strange therefore that works produced especially for Inca caciques have not been noticed until now. However, many objects of the period have Indian subjects and surely belonged to noble Incas.

However, the struggle soon provoked an articulate response, barely concealed by a veil of euphem- ism, from official circles. Meanwhile the differences which distinguished the criollo aristocracy from the caciques and the mestizo groups were vividly reflected in the universities and in theological disputes there, witness the series of paintings analysed here. Both the official position and the ideological debates were expressed by means of iconographic novelties created with the aid of Cuzco painters to defend and disseminate different standpoints.5 The pictures described in this paper originated in this context, in a city of Viceregal America, and cannot simply be considered as repetitions of or deriva- tions from foreign ideas. The genuine inventiveness of these subjects will be even more evident if it is understood that the intellectual and ideological climate of the New World was - like most other aspects of its existence - radically different from that of Europe. We have explained elsewhere how the system of colonial government implied an ambivalent attitude on the part of metropolitan Spain.6 On the one hand, the internal organization of the Viceroyalties - that is, the world of learning and thought, the technology at their disposal and the internal economic structure (especially in rural areas) - was feudal in its treatment of the local population and semi-medieval for the rest.7 On the other hand, the external relations of the colonies with Spain were centred around a semi-capitalist mining economy of exploitation, based on an ideology along the lines laid down by the triumphant post-Tridentine Church, and supported by forms of artistic expression which reinforced ecclesiastical policy. Indeed, both religious practice and the arts developed an American counterpart which spontaneously drifted away from established principles. These changes came about as a normal consequence of a daily praxis which took place under social circum- stances quite different from those of the Old World. This is particularly evident in the arts. The inherent language of a work of art requires it to reflect the ideological and social environment within which it has evolved. American artists were, therefore, presented with a paradoxical situation when, because of their colonial relationship with Spain, they were confronted with post-Tridentine religious imagery in the form of prints which arrived from Europe, and which they had to use as a starting-point to create an artistic language suited to their own semi-feudal society. This contradiction between modern prototypes and an archaic social environment, perceptible in most Latin-American pictures, explains the frustrated nature of many of these works. In the case of Cuzco this dualism was progressively overcome during the eighteenth century. Artists increasingly disregarded metropolitan stylistic intrusions and attended to their own cultural reality. The process took place simultaneously, both in a significant formal renovation and in the invention of iconographic novelties. This essay deals with 5 F.

The pictures exemplify the archaic nature of colonial Spanish-American thought in relation to that of Europe; the ingenuity of the authors of these iconographic programmes; and the fact that painting in Cuzco responded to the essentially Spanish-American colonial context in which it evolved.8 It must be remembered that, as in Europe, complex schemes with theological arguments, tinged with political implications and intellectual rivalries, were devised by clergymen or university professors. The painters were merely executors and interpreters, although in their hands lay the ultimate task of giving visual form to the ideas. On the other hand it must also be acknowledged that although in Cuzco art iconographic innovations played a substantial part in overcoming colonial dualism, the works which show these novel characteristics are not necessarily those of the highest artistic merit, as is often likewise the case in European painted allegories. UNIVERSITY EDUCATION AS SPIRITUAL GARDENING: THE GARDEN OF ST ANTHONY (P1. I 2a) The Museum of the Archbishop's Palace in Cuzco contains a large painting which represents a cloistral garden with two saints of disproportionate size,9 St Thomas Aquinas and St Anthony Abbot. The latter aims a spade towards the ground where, among the flowers, sprout a number of human busts. The entrance wall represents the Chapel and the principal doorway of the Seminary of St Anthony Abbot of Cuzco. The hedge which forms the rear of the cloister has been fashioned into the shape of two arches. In one King Charles II of Spain is seen granting the Decree of the foundation of the University of St Anthony (1692). In the other Pope Innocent XII is extending the Bull of pontifical recognition.10 So the canvas represents the University of Cuzco with a group of disting- uished men related to its academic life. For reasons that will be mentioned later, the work can be dated to between 1770 and 1776. Its style is characteristic of the late period in Cuzco painting, with figures scarcely articulated in their anatomical structure and with gilt ornament (estofado) over the 8 For an attempt at iconographic interpretation of a group of late I6th-century paintings by relating them to the religious atmosphere surrounding St Rose of Lima, see F. Stastny, 'Perez de Alesio y la pintura del siglo XVI'. Anales del Instituto de Arte Americano, xxII, 1969. 9 The canvas measures 2.42 x 1.58 m. 10 Although the University of St Anthony was awarded a Bull for its foundation in the same year (1692), the inscription next to the scene attributes to it a greater antiquity by mentioning the year I690, when the foundation was requested. 'El afio y de nobenta/dia del grande Antonio Santo/sali6 por buena quenta/la c'dula, sin espanto / que por vigilancia atenta del Pa... (Padre Avalos), . . . el santo/Salvati . . . (Salvatierra dej6) en corte/y el de Brenez coste6 el porte.' The verses by the other scene suggest that St Anthony himself miraculously intervened in order to prompt the King to award the Decree of Foundation. 'Un colegial aparece/a Carlos segundo, dando/una carta, y desa- parece;/andan al Propio buscando/y en el Propio, Antonio parece que andava solicitando/con pasos del colegial/su Real Universidad.' These texts, like all the others in the picture, were certainly written by the Rector Jose Perez Armendiriz, who was famous for his sayings and puns. See n. 67 below. The complete texts have been published in H. Villanueva Urteaga, La Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad del Cuzco, Cuzco 1963, pp. 23-24. Some were transcribed earlier by Pedro Pascual Farfin, Las glorias del Seminario del Cuzco o Apuntes para la historia del Seminario Conciliar de San Antonio Abad desde su fundacidn en i598 hasta la celebracidn de su III centenario en 1898, Cuzco 1899, who had the advantage of reading them before the canvas suffered damages and alterations by later restorations.

Other aspects indicate, however, that the author was a rather modest painter whose work reflects the popular idiom. The composition is conceived as a field divided into three interrelated zones: Heaven; the University; and the Outside World - the last as a stage for the victory of the University over heresy and evil. The University is associated with the Heavenly Kingdom through a series of links which clearly express how divine support is bestowed on its cloister. God blesses the University from his seat in heaven (P1. I2b). Directly below Him, the dove of the Holy Spirit hovers above the Crucifix," the main means of communication between heaven and earth. The blood of the Redeemer runs into the Eucharistic Fountain and emerges from it as water, which is received in chalices by the Four Fathers of the Church, and later passes into a network of canals which run alongside the plants. This irrigation system symbolises the doctrine of the Church which directly inspires the educational task of the University.12 Furthermore the Evangelists allow the ink of their pens to drop over the cloisters from above, in a gesture which refers to an idea expressed in one of the hieroglyphs of Horapollo, who compares the effect of dew on plants to the process of teaching. This image gives the first clue to the understanding of the central allegory of the painting, which compares university education to spiritual gardening.13 Around the figure of God are four little angels who present doctoral caps, crowns of laurels,14 mitres and crosiers in order to stress the purpose of the University as supplier of clergymen, 11 The image of El Cristo de los Temblores is an ancient piece of Cuzco sculpture which gained great popularity and veneration after the earthquake of 1650. During that catastrophe it was brought out in procession and praised for putting an end to the tremors. It has progressively become a symbol of the city and its native population. Around this sculpture a legend has been embroidered that it was awarded to Cuzco by Charles V, as in the case of so many other devotional images. Harold E. Wethey, Colonial architecture and sculpture in Peru, Cambridge, Mass. 1949, P. 243; Miriam Kropp, Cuzco window on Peru, New York 1956, pp. 39-40. 12 A Latin text which confirms this meaning runs over the cloister: 'Regalis deliciarum Magni Antonii hortus ex Eclesiae Fonte Ricatus ad que Doctoribus, et Sanctis Patribus'. The fountain has the following texts: 'Fons Eclesiae Catholicae'; and 'El huerto que aquif vera's/de estas flores, no es Aonio; planta si es del Grande Antonio/y da las aguas Thomas'. ('The orchard of these flowers which you here see is not an Aonio; it is rather a plant of Anthony the Great, and Thomas provides the water.') Occasionally the University was compared to a fountain and was thus associated (abusively) with the Fountain of 'living water'. Images glorifying the University of San Marcos of Lima are used in a similar way, for instance in the sonnet dedicated to it by Pedro de Ofia in 1602: Esclarecida Fuente de Agua pura No dudes ya, de que las aguas vivas de tu Doctrina, y regla saludable, Alcancen a las filtimas naciones. ('Illustrious Fountain of pure water ... Have no doubts any more, that the living waters of your Doctrine, and wholesome rule, shall reach the furthest of nations.') See Luis A. Eguiguren, Diccionario histdrico cronoldgico de la Universidad Realy Pontificaa de San Marcos (3 vols), Lima, 1940, 1949, 1951, I1, p. 305; A. Salazar y Zevallos, Constitucidny Ordenanzas antiguas, a~iadidasy modernas de la Real Universidady Estudio General de San Marcos de la ciudad de los Reyes del Peru', Lima 1735 (pages unnumbered). 13 The hieroglyphics of Horapollo explain that the effect of teaching is like dew falling from above; it benefits some plants while others are incapable of absorbing it. See Horapollo, The Hieroglyphics, edn New York 1950, 1, 37; Guy de Tervarent, Attributs et symboles dans l'art profane, Geneva 1958-64, 11, col. 325. Dew dropping from a cloud is depicted in the allegory of Doctrine in C. Ripa, Iconologia, edn Rome 1603, p. 113. 14 The laurel wreath symbolizes wisdom and fame according to an 18th-century Peruvian author. 'Fame is rewarded with coins of crowns and palms ... But for wisdom, preference was given above all to laurel, as the plant of the mind which purifies and of influential prophesy.' ('Las coronas y las palmas fueron la moneda de la Fama ... Pero se prefiri6 ... entre los que se debian dar a la Sabiduria el del laurel, como planta del entendimiento que depura y del vaticinio que influye.') Salazar y Zevallos, op. cit. n. 12 above. Because its leaves are permanently green, laurel is in particular the symbol of immortality. Cf.

The most active relationship with the celestial world, however, is established by St Thomas Aquinas and St Anthony Abbot. With their great size, which allows them to have their feet in the garden and their heads in heaven, but especially through the dialogue they establish with Christ, these figures embody the main idea of the painting. The words they seem to pronounce come from the First Epistle to the Corinthians and explain the actions of the saints and their relation with God: 'I planted, Apollo watered; but God gave the increase.' St Paul refers to his preaching in Corinth, in these verses, and they were often quoted by writers such as Cesare Ripa and authors of emblemata.16 St Anthony plants - in other words he is in charge of the daily academic toil of the cloister; St Thomas waters with the wisdom of the doctrine that flows from his pen;17 and the Heavenly Father bestows the power that fertilizes the spiritual education of the pupils. 18 But it is Christ who encourages each of the participants in their noble work: 'You wrote well of me, Thomas';19 and 'Plant the vineyard of the just'; are the words which Jesus addresses to the Saints from His cross. Thus the educational undertaking of the University is associated with the growing of a Christian garden whose flowers are professors, bishops, cardinals and doctors, and whose purpose is compared with the illustrious example of St Paul in his apostolic preaching at Corinth. The comparison of education with the cultivation of flowers or plants has a long literary tradition and derives from classical antiquity.20 A Peruvian author of the eighteenth century, in order to defend the desirability of educating the Indians, quoted 15s Another sign of divine favour is the star which falls directly from the halo surrounding God the Father into the cloister, near to the place where Vice-Rector Hermosa is standing. It has the same meaning as the star on the forehead of St Dominic. The text by the star reads: 'Very good fortune is announced to you, noble Pindo, by this star which has fallen in your midst envious of your glory.' ('Muy buena estrella te anuncia / noble Pindo, este lucero / que embidioso de tus glorias/se despefia a vuestro centro.') For the star symbolizing Fame, Happiness and Glory, see Norma Cecchini, Dizionario sinottico di Iconologia, Bologna 1976, p. 469. See also n. 85 below. 16 I Corinthians 3. 6. The Apollo mentioned was a disciple of St Paul. The Latin texts - 'Ego plantavi, / Apollo rigavit, / Deus incrementum dat' - are inscribed on St Anthony's spade, among the rays springing from the pen of St Thomas and on either side of God. 17 The idea of the water of St Thomas's doctrine was taken further by representing him as a 'fountain of life' which nourishes the members of the different religious orders. That is the subject of the picture by Antoine Nicolas (1648?) painted for the Dominican convent of the Annunciation of Faubourg St Honore in Paris which, since 1974, hangs in the transept of N6tre Dame. The composition is based on Adrien Collaert's engrav- ing of the early I7th century. See P. M.

In the explanation he reminds us that proper education needs God's grace according to the words of St Paul. 'Ego plantavi . . .' (I Corinthians 3. 6). And this idea is symbolized by a ray of light descending from Heaven over the figure. The same words of St Paul inspired the emblem Sine numine frustra of P. Iselberg. The images illustrating it, however, are entirely different from those of the Cuzco version. Paul is kneeling with his sword on the ground next to him, planting a tree with his hands, and Apollo leans forward with a watering can.

E. Salazar y Zevallos, a similar comparison is made, in a reference to the revenues the Cloister would require: 'Already the field was ploughed and the seeds planted and all that was lacking was the watering.... '22 However, it is in the seventeenth century that such similes are encountered with more consistency in the elaborate writings of the University professors. As early as 1619 that idea is found in a song which Bernardino Montoya dedicated to the University of San Marcos: De tanto noble ingenio que cual nativa plantafertilizas, fruto verds en abundante copia.23 In the middle of the century, in a work of praise to the University of Lima written in anger by Le6n Pinelo because his University had been ignored by the famous Belgian philosopher Justus Lipsius, nearly a dozen similar images can be found. To the question 'What is the Academy?', he answered: 'It is portrayed as a resplendent garden of spiritual gifts.' In another passage the Rectors 'are the reapers' who gather the crop of the university field. And in a description which brings to mind the Cuzco painting, he wrote: 'the bonnet-covered heads are the fruits' of the tree of science.24 In the city of Cuzco itself, an anonymous chronicler of the Jesuit College, writing in 1653, compared the children who were being taught with the 'tender plants (that) are beginning to be cultivated for glory'.25 The high point in the use of the literary image of education as spiritual gardening coincided, in the seventeenth century, with a new way of representing the allegory of Grammar among the arts. It originated in the circle of Raphael and showed Grammar no longer as the woman of medieval iconography teaching children with a whip and a file, but rathers as an affable youth who waters a small plant from an amphora. The plant is, in the words of E. Male, an 'image of the young spirits that [Grammar] cultivates',26 and this was precisely the allegory adopted in the handbook of Cesare Ripa, which gave the idea its wide acceptance. In Europe this subject was extremely rare in independent paintings, although Grammar appears in series of Liberal Arts.27 There seem to be no examples in the Old World of the conceit directly related to university life in the way it was 21 Ignacio de Castro, Relacidn del Cuzco (I795), Lima 1978, P. 45; he quotes Juan de Sol6rzano, Politica Indiana, 1795. 22 Salazar y Zevallos, loc. cit. n. 12 above. 23 Diego Cano Gutierrez, Relacion de las Fiestas Triumphales que la insigne Universidad de Lima hizo a la Inmaculada Concepcidn de Nuestra Seiiora, Lima 1619, quoted by Eguiguren, op. cit. n. 12 above, ii, p. 622. 24 Diego de Le6n Pinelo, Semblanza de la Universidad de San Marcos (1648), Lima 1949, pp. 109, 130, 173; see also: pp. 74, 80, o10, 1 2. 25 Breve relacidn de lo sucedido en el Colegio del Cuzco desde el afio i6oo hasta el presente de 1653 ... in Ruben Vargas Ugarte, op. cit. n. io above, p. 131. 26 The medieval prototype was inspired by the description of Grammatica given in the fifth century by Martianus Capella (De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii) which was still in use in such Renaissance engravings as the so-called 'Tarocchi Mantegna'. However, the new iconography already appears in a print by Marcantonio (B. xiv, 292, 383) which developed the idea that Grammatica is the root of the tree of the sciences and therefore needs water to grow.

On either side of the eucharistic fountain placed in the Heavenly Kingdom are two figures which complete the group of divine images. A repetition in smaller size of the effigy of St Anthony appears kneeling on the left side making a gesture of devotion29 to a female figure laden with attributes seated on the opposite side (P1. I 2c). Earlier interpretations have sought to recognize in this latter image a personification of the University30 adorned with symbols representing the different faculties. However, the attributes she bears and the significant position that she occupies in the celestial level cast doubt on this interpretation.31 In fact she illustrates Divine Wisdom,32 whose presence above the cloister, being adored by St Anthony, clearly alludes to the role intended for her as the guide and inspiration of academic life. The attributes bestowed on this figure reveal its meaning. She is seated over the clouds with the sun of wisdom and resplendent virtue beaming on her chest,33 the crown of victory over her head, and in possession of the 28 Van Marle mentioned the possible existence of a university decorative cycle in Europe; but no examples are preserved. The university subject encountered most frequently is the 'professor with his pupils'. It is easily distinguished from the parallel and more common subject of the school-teacher, in that the Magister sits in a professorial chair and has no whip. Closely linked to academic iconography is that of libraries, of which a notable example is Martin de Cervera's *decoration of 1614 in the library of El Escorial. See Raimond Van Marle, Iconographie de l'art profane au moyen-ige et ae la Renaissance, The Hague 1931-32, I, pp. 351 ff.; H. Van de Waal, Iconclass, an iconographic classification system, Ams- terdam I977, Bibliography 4, part ii (no. 49 B 4); Andre Masson: 'Le dc&amp;or des bibliotheques anciennes au Portugal et en Espagne', Bulletin des Bibliothiques de France, vII, 2, 1962, pp. 87 ff. See also n. 52 below. 29 By the side of the Saint is a collegiate sash and a bell, symbols of university life. His eyes and the gesture of his hands are clearly directed towards the allegorical figure. Therefore he is not presenting the University to God, which would have to be the case if the female figure represented the Academy; rather, he is offering the symbols of university life to Divine Wisdom. 30 In Ripa the allegory of the University (as Accademia) is completely different. It is an enthroned female figure who holds a file with the inscription Detrahit atque polit, and a garland made of ivy, myrtle and laurel; at her feet lie several books and a reading cynocephalus. Ripa, op. cit. n. I8 above, 1669, p. 2. 3' Although the most important Faculty in the University was Theology, it is likewise unacceptable to identify that figure with a personification of Theology, as Teresa Gisbert recently suggested. The main iconographical attributes of Theology are missing. Ripa presents her as a woman with two faces sitting on the globe of the firmament. This double-faced female figure is usually replaced by the visually more acceptable image of Religion, who has a veiled head and holds a cross, a chalice, a book or the flame of devotion, and treads on the dragon. See Ripa, op. cit. n. I8 above, p. 625; and, for instance, the image from Giarda's Icones Symbolicae (Milan 1626) reproduced in E. H. Gombrich, Symbolic Images. Studies in the Art of the Renaissance, London 1972, pp. 123-25, fig. 133: Teresa Gisbert, Iconografiay mitos indigenas en el arte, La Paz 198o0, p. 151. In the short description given by Gisbert, Pope Innocent XII is taken for King Philip V, Juan Bustamente Carlos for Melchor Inca I, and the painting is dated around I700o Such an early dating cannot be accepted, for, besides the emblem of Bishop Gorrichategui (I770-76), the very facade of the Seminary of St Anthony depicted in the canvas was built under Bishop Sarricolea y Olea in 1736-40. See nn. 52 and 54 below. 32 Divine Wisdom is usually represented by one of three basic iconographic types: a. Minerva holding a shield decorated with the dove of the Holy Ghost, as in Ripa (op. cit. n. 18 above, p. 547); b. God the Father with a triangle and a sceptre, as in O. Vaenius (Emblemata Horatiana, Antwerp 1607, 83) and T. Mainardi's picture (Pinacoteca, Faenza); and c. a crowned female figure with a sceptre,the sun, a looking- glass or a globe and the Trinity, as in A. Sacchi (Barberini Palace), Luca Giordano (Medici-Riccardi Palace, Florence), G. Vasari (Vasari House, Arezzo) and C. Clemens, Musei sive bibliothecae, Lyons 1635, frontispiece and as in Cuzco. This last is the most frequently used prototype. 33 For G. P. Valeriano the sun is the symbol of Wisdom. That is the principal meaning of the sun over the breast of St Thomas. An engraving by Charles de la Haye, for instance, shows the Saint being awarded the title of Angelic Doctor by a figure representing Wisdom, which carries a laurel wreath and has a shining sun over the chest. Also in Veronese's Eternity and Fame (Frick Collection, New York). See, G. P. Valeriano, Hiero- glyphica, edn Basle 1575, XLIV; G. de Tervarent, op. cit. n. 13 above, I, fig. 42, 11, p. 356; E.

There too is Divine Wisdom seated among the clouds with a sun upon her chest and a sceptre in her hand. She is surrounded by personifications of the same virtues, as well as some other attributes of her sanctity.41 34 A small cross over the crown confirms that the figure must be of a sacred nature and does not represent the University. Besides, crown, sun and sceptre (or spear) are generic symbols of the power to command and of Virtue. See, Mile, op. cit. n. 14 above, p. 404; C. Ripa, Iconologia (1603), Hildesheim I970, p. 512. 35 The Trinity and Eternity are two of the main attributes of Divine Wisdom. They are thus mentioned in an old iconographic description of Sacchi's fresco. The relation of Eternity to Wisdom is clearly illustrated in Veronese's painting in the Frick Collection, where Eternity has the sun of Wisdom over the forehead and the inscription Omnia Vanitas. The serpent biting its own tail derives from Horapollo. For Divine Wisdom and the Trinity, see also n. 32 above. See de Tervarent, op. cit. n. 13 above, I, fig. 42, 11, cols 346, 251; G.

Like Ripa's Divine Justice, the Cuzco figure has loose hair falling over her shoulders. The sun and the cornucopia are also occasional attributes of Justice. See n. 38 below and Ripa, op. cit. n. 34 above, p. 52 and op. cit. n. 18 above, p. 246. 37 For the attributes of the Virtues mentioned see Mile, op. cit. n. 14 above, pp. 391, 396, 418. The cornucopia, symbol of Fortune in classical antiquity, was also applied to the personification of Virtue in the Renaissance, since as Alciati for example explains, Fortune might be conquered by the merits of Virtue. See Tervarent, op. cit. n. 13 above, I, col. 123; Alciati, Emblemata, ed. Paris 1583, no. II8; R. Wittkower, 'Chance, Time and Virtue', this Journal, I, 1937-38, p. 316; C. Ripa, op. cit. n. 34 above, p. 51o; L. Reau, Iconographie de l'art chritien, Paris p955-59, i, p. 189. 38 Besides symbolizing Wisdom, the Sun is a general attribute of Virtue and especially ofJustice, which is an idea dear to the author of the programme of the Cuzco picture. According to Ripa, this relationship is explained by the fact that Virtue enlightens the microcosm of the human person, just as the sun illuminates the universe. Furthermore the Sun of Justice, mentioned by Christ, is the Virtue which comprises all others. Ripa, op. cit. n. 34 above, p. 512. 9 The complete text reads: 'No dire que . .. aqui esti el tesoro de la Sabiduria, principalmente de la sabiduria que salva ...? Por eso Dios Padre ... ensefia a las mentes de los mortales que sean conocedoras de la divinidad. Esta ciencia goza del cetro, esta cerrada sin cerco la puerta, se abre uinicamente a los cultores de la verda dera fe, s61o stos se apacientan en el Sol.' ('Shall I not say that ... here is the treasure of Wisdom, especially of the saving wisdom? Therefore God the Father ... teaches human minds to seek divinity. This science possesses the sceptre, the door is closed without fence, it opens only to the worshippers of the true faith, only these will be instructed by the sun.') Pinelo, op. cit. n. 24 above, p. 49. 40 Virtue and wisdom are united in Divine Wisdom. The combination of these two attributes is the subject of the decorative programmes of many conventual librar- ies in South Germany and Austria. They usually contain figures of Minerva and personifications of the Virtues, as in Daniel Gran's frescoes in the Monastery of St Florian near Linz.

Its educational task was inspired by Divine Wisdom, nourished by the theological doctrines of the Fathers of the Church and led, in the main, by the thought of Thomas Aquinas, who had been established by Pius V as the fifth ecclesiastical Doctor. Its professed aim was almost exclusively the doctrinal instruction of youth in order to provide dignitaries for the Church, and to supply jurists for the Crown; and, in that way, to construct an ideological bastion against heresy.42 'Through this medium' (Viceroy Amat wrote of the colonial University a few years after the picture had been painted) 'Religion affirms its dogmas, and the political and civil government their best axioms.'43 For almost three centuries of Viceregal government this concept did not vary. As early as 155 I it is found in the Real Ce'dula of the foundation of the University of San Marcos of Lima.44 With even greater clarity it is expressed in 1576 in the Provisiones of the great organizer of the Viceroyalty, Don Francisco de Toledo, who wrote: 'that ... the University was one of the most important entities for the service of God and his Majesty ... as the sciences are the road and light to the better knowledge of our faith, and of the love and loyalty that the subjects should have for their King and natural Lord'. Furthermore, he wrote of those leaving the University that, 'being learned persons, they will provide a source for future beneficiaries, prelates, dignitaries, preben- daries and holders of other offices of honour that his Majesty supplies ... for these Kingdoms'.45 Studies at the University were therefore aimed at reinforcing religious dogma and providing a better understanding of the Faith. As in the scholastic institutions of the fourteenth century, all energies were directed at the repetitive teaching imparted in the faculties of Theology, Arts and Canon Law. It is true that Medicine was included in the curriculum, following the pattern of medieval universities; but, as in the case of Mathematics, insufficient students attended the lectures. There was a total lack of interest in scientific subjects and gradually the funds assigned to those chairs were channelled to 42 That the Spanish university was meant to serve the Crown is clearly expressed on the facade of the University of Salamanca, model of the American universities. Over the doorway there is a medallion with the portraits of the Catholic kings and the Greek words: 'Hoi basileis tei enciclopaideiai aute tois basileuisi' (The kings for the university and the latter for the kings). See S. Sebastian, 'El mensaje iconol6gico de la portada de la Universidad de Salamanca' Revista Goya, cxxxvII, 1977, p. 300. 43 The Viceroy Manuel de Amat y Juniet governed from I76i to I776. He mentioned the University in his Memorias de Gobierno, V. Rodriguez, Seville 1947, P. 123. 44 The following definition of the purpose of the Peruvian University is to be found in the Cidula Real for the foundation of the University of San Marcos awarded on I2 May 1551: '. . . el (Estudio General) seria muy provechoso en aquella tierra: porque los hijos de los Vecinos de ella serian doctrinados y ensefiados y cobrarian habilidad ...', meaning the ability to serve the Crown and the Church. See C. D. Valcaircel, San Marcos, Universidad decana de Amirica, Lima 1968, p. 17. 45 Toledo also mentions the financial advantages which will be derived from the existence of a university in Lima as its graduates would be able to replace the officials, who had to be sent, at great cost, from Spain. Eguiguren, op. cit. n. 12 above, 11, p. 912. Fray Antonio de la Calancha uses similar terms in the I7th century. The University, he wrote, will be 'provechosa . . . a la exaltaci6n de la Iglesia ... y servicio a las dos magestades ... (y cuyos) graduados ... han sido o han ascendido a Oidores, alcaldes de corte, fiscales, ... arzobispos, obispos, inquisidores y fiscales del Santo Tribunal .. .'.

As late as I789 the programmes for the examinations in Philosophy at the University of San Marcos still denied the theories of Descartes in favour of those of Aristotle, and the system of Copernicus was admitted, at most, as a hypothesis.47 The conceptual distance between the thought of the New World, and what was current in Europe at the time, was indeed considerable.48 In this connection it is instructive to compare the painting of the Garden of St Anthony with a ceiling decoration completed exactly one hundred years earlier (1669) in the University of Oxford, commissioned to exalt the academic life of that ancient institution. Robert Streeter's allegory of The Arts and the Sciences glorifying the Truth signalled the official adoption of Cartesian principles at Oxford, as well as the idea that the University should be devoted to the acquisition of scientific knowledge. Streeter's composition represented in two ways the liberation of British universities from what remained of their medieval subjugation to the Church. First of all, the construction of the Sheldonian Theatre, where Streeter's ceiling is placed, was commis- sioned by the University from Christopher Wren to provide a hall for the academic ceremonies which had previously been conducted at the Church of Saint Mary's in Oxford. Secondly, among the allegorical figures represented in this composition, Theo- logy herself is placed beside the Arts and Sciences, imploring, together with all the others, guidance from Truth. Thus, for the learned members of this British University, not even Religion could 'claim to be in the possession of truth'.49 46 From 1634 courses of Medicine were given at the University of San Marcos in Lima (and officially recognized by Royal Decree in 1638) thanks to the personal interest of the Viceroy Conde de Chinch6n. Since 169i Internal Medicine was taught. Yet these courses did not receive proper revenues nor were they subscribed to by the students; and finally they were 'no longer read'. (Memoria of Viceroy M. Navarra y Rocaful). Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood (i628) was accepted at San Marcos only in 1723, after having received a favourable report from the polygraph P. Peralta y Barnuevo, who assured them that the discovery 'contained nothing against the principles of true philosophy'. In 1730 the excellent mathematician Cosme Bueno arrived at Lima. Due to the lack of pupils, in I773 Viceroy Amat ruled that it was obligatory for cadets to enrol in his courses. The military arts were the only ones which could not dispense with mathematics.

At last, in 1793, due to the liberalizing effect of the Mercurio Peruano (1791-93), the courses of Philosophy at Lima Univer- sity recognized the theories of Descartes, Newton, Leibniz and Copernicus. Barreda Laos, op. cit. n. 46 above, pp. 227, 228. 48 One must note that, given the growing contact between Europe and the New World during the second half of the I8th century, there were exceptional individuals who were well informed about trends in philosophy and the scientific developments of their day. The most outstanding example is that of Toribio Rodriguez de Mendoza, who as Rector of the College of San Carlos (1 786-I8I 7) initiated the teaching of these subjects. But society as a whole, and certainly the official view, still adhered to the patterns of scholastic- ism to a marked degree. 49 The profane jests of the terrae filius, which used to take place during the ceremonies of the Encaenia, were one of the reasons why these premises were left by the University, and they remind us of the institution of the vejamen del graduando in the graduation ceremonies of colonial Peruvian universities. See L. A. Eguiguren, El Paseo Triunfaly el vejamen del graduado, Lima i949; E. H. Gombrich, 'Art history and the social sciences', in Ideals and idols, Oxford I979, pp. I31-66 passim, figs 3-4.</page><page sequence="11">1o4 FRANCISCO STASTNY In this way, a hundred years before The Garden of St Anthony in Cuzco reaffirmed a medieval faith in studies governed by Divine Wisdom and theological authority, Oxford University had already adopted the notion that academic activity should imply the search for truth, and embrace the motto Nullius in verba of the Royal Society, to which the majority of its professors belonged. A comparison of the academic programmes of the Universities of Oxford and Cuzco might seem unjust, given the disparity between the histories of the two institutions; however, it achieves the purpose of stressing the distance that lay between two such extremes of the Old and New Worlds. Even so, it must be remembered that Oxford was an exception among European universities. Leaving aside universities in Britain and the Netherlands, in Catholic Europe only a few Italian universities had succeeded in incorporating the principles of the new scientific and philosophical advances. As is well known, the revolutionary work of men like Copernicus, Bacon, Descartes or Leibniz had to be undertaken outside - or in opposition to - the established universities, under the auspices of academies or in complete privacy.50 In fact from the Counter-Reformation onwards the institution of the university itself (as in the case of Paris) became, with the years, increasingly more conservative. However, it is no less true that the intellectual world of Cuzco - without any academies or private scientific activity to support it - was, compared to Europe, archaic in its colonial setting, more so even than the most backward of European institutions. A brief survey of the iconographic programmes used in the decoration of university buildings and libraries of Spain and Portugal will reveal how far removed they already were from Thomist thought, still officially sustained at the University of St Anthony Abbot as late as the end of the eighteenth century. Even the University of Salamanca, the model of Spanish-American universities, displayed - beside medieval images of the Trivium and Quadrivium - a Renaissance decorative scheme derived from Italian humanist thought and ancient philosophy, in which the reconciliation with Christian principles was scarcely stressed.51 Later, such an important centre for the Counter-Reformation as the Library of El Escorial had a programme probably established by Juan de Herrera which not only argued in favour of a reconciliation between Religion and Philosophy, but also sought to harmonize the seven traditional Arts with the mysteries of Hermeticism and the new astronomical knowledge.s2 In the eighteenth century, during the time in which the Cuzco iconography was being developed, the fagade of the University of Valladolid represented a more conservative attitude, whose message proposed the reconciliation of university knowledge 50 On the intellectual atmosphere of Europe, see Robert Mandrou, Des humanistes aux hommes de science: i6f et It siecles, Paris 1973. 51 The seven Liberal Arts, now lost, were depicted in the Library of the University of Salamanca associated with a planetary system in accordance with a medieval tradition already described by Dante, and were painted towards the end of the I5th century. The facade, on the other hand, contains the dialectic opposition of Hercules and Venus, which symbolizes the University as the Palace of Virtue and Vice. This, and the cloister with its humanist hieroglyphics, were created in the first third of the i6th century.

Sebas- tian, op. cit. n. 42 above. 52 The allegorical figures and mysterious scenes taken from Antiquity, the Bible and Egypt were painted by Pellegrino Tibaldi and Bartolom6 Carducho, according to a programme whose true author seems to be Juan de Herrera and not FatherJos6 de Sigiienza, to whom it is traditionally ascribed.

Such is the case for the decorations of the University of Coimbra or the fagade of San Telmo in Seville.54 On the ceiling of the beautiful Library in Coimbra, Theology is represented on an equal level with the other Faculties, all placed around an allegory of Encyclopedia, just as earlier, at Oxford, where she was subservient to Truth.55 Even if we direct our attention to the most traditional iconographic programmes of the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries as produced for some Jesuit Colleges and convent libraries of Europe, none contains a message as archaic as that of the Peruvian colonial painting. The medieval principle that is defended in such schemes, of the submission of the sciences to religion rather than their reconciliation, is more consistent with a university outlook than those created in Cuzco, since at least the scientific disciplines are implicitly recognized. This is clearly exemplified in such scenes as that of the Virgin as Sedes Sapientiae and source of inspiration for the Faculties, portrayed at the University of Evora; or Philosophy and the Sciences submitting to the Catholic Faith, as represented on the ceiling of the Jesuit College of Lisbon.56 These positions are more advanced than those defended in the Garden of Saint Anthony, where neither Faculties nor Sciences are mentioned at all, and the University is viewed as a hortus conclusus irrigated by the eucharistic waters and cultivated by the grace of Divine Wisdom for purely religious purposes. Only in the last decade of the eighteenth century would this artificial archaism begin rapidly to disintegrate in Cuzco, along with the whole Viceregal system, and attitudes similar to the ones expressed in the convent libraries of Europe begin to be adopted. At that late date the arguments for the reconciliation of Knowledge with Religion - debated only a few decades earlier in Lima - began to be considered.57 They laid the foundations for a 'political harmony' of which 'God himself is the author' and without which 'the 53 In Valladolid the Sciences and the Faculties are placed around the central and predominant figures of Theology and Solomonic Wisdom. Four Kings of Spain linked with the history of the University stand at the top of the building. See S. Sebastian, Contra-Reforma y Barroco, Madrid 1981, p. 51. 54 Sebastian, loc. cit. n. 53 above. ss The ceilings of the three chambers of the Library of the University of Coimbra are decorated on the sides with allegories of the Library and of the Encyclopaedia or Knowledge, and of Wisdom in the central room. Near the latter are two putti who are sprinkling water in reference to the dew of teaching as in Horapollo's Hieroglyphics. Instead of making reference to Divine Wisdom or the wisdom of Solomon, the image is surrounded by personifications of Honour, Fame, Virtue and Fortune, and is associated with four classical authors: Virgil, Ovid, Seneca and Cicero. All of this confirms the exceptional modernity of the programme and renders most doubtful the comparison with the medieval mirrors of Vincent de Beauvais to which A. Masson alludes, deceived by the quotation which compares the Library with 'a palace which imprisons the universe in a looking-glass'. See Jose Ramos de Bandeiria, Universidade de Coimbra, I943, pp. I66-8o; Germain Bazin, Connaissance des Arts, Paris, June 96o0, pp. 66-71; Masson, vII, 2, op. cit. n. 28 above, p. 67. 56 Masson, loc. cit. The programme of Evora, similar to that in the library of the Convent of Schussenreid, Germany, derives from the work of Claude Clement (op. cit. n. 32 above), which was conceived as a handbook of Christian allegories for the decoration of libraries, and which was written with the purpose of avoiding the abuse of pagan and classical themes in academic premises. The author was a Jesuit and professor of rhetoric in Madrid. s7 In Lima the arguments for the conciliation of Reason and revealed Truth began to take hold during the last third of the I8th century. One of the early instances is the anonymous manuscript Antorcha Lumi- nosa, 1772, attributed to Francisco Ruiz Cano, which states that there are only two kinds of irrefutable truth: those of dogma and those 'demonstrated by calculation and experiment'. See n. I00oo below. 8</page><page sequence="13">106 FRANCISCO STASTNY sciences would be silenced . .. ignorance would know no bounds', according to the words of Dr Ignacio de Castro.58 The distance between both continents, therefore, was much greater than the hundred years that separated the Sheldonian Theatre from the Garden of Saint Anthony. In fact the principles which guided the intellectual movement of the Renaissance were never adopted in colonial America.59 Even less so were the scientific discoveries of the seventeenth century, which opened the doors to the modern conception of reality. Therefore it goes without saying that the American ideological world had some sui generis features and that the outlook of its artists, as well as of those who commissioned the works, was far removed from the thought of their European contemporaries. These differences were indeed significant, to the extent that any comparison between works of art produced on either side of the Atlantic which does not take these factors into account will surely be found faulty.60 Returning to the programme of the Cuzco painting, it is necessary to examine the figures portrayed and to determine the date at which the picture might have been painted (two interrelated questions) in order to reach an understanding of the revealing symbolic subject which is suggested at the lower level of the canvas. There are altogether thirty-four figures distributed among the nine beds into which the cloistral garden is divided. They represent the most outstanding intellectual and ecclesiastical authorities related to the University. Among them are the first Rector, DrJuan Cairdenas y C6spedes, and those who participated in the inaugural degree ceremonies in 1696; the great Cuzco writer Juan Espinoza Medrano 'El Lunarejo', a graduate of St Anthony; Vasco de Valverde y Contreras, a writer and bishop who rose to become Rector of the University of San Marcos in Lima; Pedro de Alva Astorga, who became a cardinal; as well as many other bishops who graduated from the College.61 58 Ignacio de Castro (1733-1829), Rector of the College of San Bernardo, is a typical example of a criollo intellectual who tries to incorporate the new ideas without breaking with the Faith. In describing the function of the University, he typically repeats the old arguments of the university being for the service of the 'sovereignty of the Prince ... and his supreme authority', but he also adds the need for a 'study of the sciences, the investigation of their arcana, ... the knowledge of truth' and he attempts thus to reconcile scientific purposes with Religion. Ignacio de Castro, op. cit. n. 21I above, p. 146. 59 On the Renaissance and Mannerism in Spanish- American art, see F. Stastny, 'Maniera o contra- maniera en la pintura latinoamericana', Instituto de Investigaciones Estiticas, La Dispersidn del Manierismo, Mexico 198o, p. 207. 60 The mural decorations of the libraries of convents, palaces and universities of Catholic Europe are closer to Cuzco iconography. Apart from a few themes taken from classical antiquity, the parallels between Theology and Philosophy and the opposition of Orthodoxy and Heresy were the most frequent subjects. The reconcilia- tion of Natural Law with Divine Revelation, which was the leitmotiv of German monastic libraries, is a theme which appears late in the Spanish-American world, around 1795, shortly before Independence.

That side represents, therefore, ecclesiastical power.62 Those who participated in the foundation ceremonies are on the opposite side. Among them are Don Crist6bal de Traslavifias, Vice-Rector of the Seminary at the time of the creation of the University; Espinoza Medrano, El Lunarejo; standing up alone, the 'Marquis D. Carlos Inca', descendant of the Royal Inca house. All of them symbolize the intellectual, mestizo and native social forces which sustained the University. So far, thirty of the thirty-four persons portrayed have been identified.63 All of them lived in the seventeenth century or in the first two-thirds of the eighteenth century, with the exception of Jose Perez Armendairiz and the brothers Eugenio and Toribio Hermosa,64 who are in places of special significance in the composition. The former was Rector of St Anthony Abbot from 1769 until 18o6, and is depicted, as his position requires, to the right of the Crucifix along with the highest authorities. Eugenio Hermosa, who acted as Vice-Rector with PWrez Armendairiz, is on the opposite side. The place of honour, at the foot of the fountain, was reserved for Don Juan de Cirdenas, the first Rector to govern the University in 1696, and forJuan Rodriguez de Rivera (d. 1631), one of the Rectors of the Seminary celebrated for his sanctity. The positions second in importance in the row closest to the spectator, on either side of the portal, are occupied by PWrez Armendairiz and Eugenio Hermosa.65 This distribution (both spatial and chronological) reveals that the work was executed during the time of PWrez Armendairiz and Eugenio Hermosa, with the clear purpose of exalting the glorious past of the institution. The relationship which can thus be traced between Rector Perez and the painting will be established more clearly once one has a better knowledge of that exceptional character. Jose P6rez Armendiriz (1728-1819) was born in Paucartambo, near Cuzco, the son of a wealthy family which owned large estates in the surrounding districts. At the age of fourteen he enrolled in the Seminary of St Anthony Abbot and graduated as a Doctor of Theology at twenty-three (1751). During a brilliant academic and ecclesiastic career66 he achieved the office of temporary Bishop of Cuzco (1786-91) and was finally appointed to the Diocese in i8o6. At the University he was Regent, Vice-Rector for ten years, and Rector for the extraordinarily long period of thirty-seven years, until he renounced the post in order to occupy the Bishopric. PWrez Armendiriz appears to have been a 62 The figures of the Pope and Charles II are placed similarly at the rear of the cloister. The former is on the right next to the ecclesiastical authorities; the latter is on the opposite side, with the representatives of temporal power. 63 Twenty-seven characters have been identified and dated. One, the monk of La Merced, Acufia, has been identified without a date. Two had died when the painting was executed: Paredes ('if time has eclipsed his light, his memory lives here') and Angel Soriano ('he is Soriano, Angel in death and life'). Four are unknown: Quifiones, Santa Cruz, Cisneros and Bernardo Evar- isto. "Apart from the three we have mentioned, Pedro Barrueta, who was named Archbishop of La Paz in 1755, could have been alive at the time. The painting of the University Tree of 1794 offers the following informa- tion on the Hermosa brothers: Eugenio was Professor of Arts and Theology, Regente and Vice-Rector and Rector Curate of the Cathedral of Cuzco. Toribio was Professor of Arts and Theology. 65 Perez is on the right hand of the portico (on the left of the beholder). Hermosa occupies the second place from the doorway, on the opposite side. 66 In 1768 he was Curate of Spaniards in the Cathedral, in I787 Treasurer and in 1792 Maestrescuela.

A brilliant man, who was famous for his wit67 and proud of the successes of his intellectual achievements, he did not, unfortunately, leave written works which could allow us to understand better his thought and political ideas. In that sense, the two paintings here analysed as related to him shed more light on his character and idiosyncracies than many documents. The ambivalence of his position stemmed from the enormous prestige he managed to gain, not only in the academic circles of the city, but among the ordinary people, who respected him as a living example of charity and modesty. He has been compared to the famous Bishop Manuel de Mollinedo, who precisely one hundred years earlier had bestowed his generosity on the city of Cuzco by lavishly patronizing the arts. Perez Armendiriz, on the other hand, spent most of his fortune in supporting the education of the poor youth of Cuzco and his home town of Paucartambo, and in providing funds for the University.68 'He is a Saint Pius V ... He founds his virtues on humility and charity ... He is venerable,just and loved .. .' were the words used by Intendent GeneralJose M. Goyeneche when he wrote to Spain asking the King to bestow the Great Cross of Charles III upon the Bishop.69 So the Viceregal authorities tolerated him and, as the words quoted above reveal, he was even flattered in order to avoid something much worse - that 'the flame of rebellion ... should (perhaps) be lit', through the neglect of his person.70 However, Perez Armendairiz's heart was with the poorest and most exploited, that is, with the Indian population. His rural roots and mestizo background account for this inclination, as do his Christian education and his familiarity with the new philosophical trends.71 For the same reasons he was also decidedly sympathetic with the rebellious caciques and the Inca nationalist Renaissance; just as in his later life he would come to assist the 1814 revolution almost openly.72 It is not by chance that many of those who participated in that rebellion were graduates of St Anthony.

Given his fondness for rhymes and despite their limited literary value, presumably Rector Perez was the author of the verses which are next to all the figures on the canvas of the Garden ofSan Antonio. 68 One contemporary document mentions his auster- ity and 'the very frugal meals ... (which) were served at his table because (his fortune) was dispersed and given to the poor'. In his will he left his estate in Mollepata 'for the cost of shoes and clothes for p6or students M.

In opposition to the wealthy aristocracy of the Jesuit College of St Bernard and of its University of St Ignatius of Loyola, St Anthony drew to itself the mestizo population and was identified with the ideals of the Indians. As Rector of the institution for thirty-seven years, PWrez Armendairiz directed its destiny and guided its ideological bearings. Taking these facts into account, and the light they shed on the historical circumstances, together with the clear anti-Bernard (that is, anti-criollo) content of the painting, there can be little doubt about the close relationship which existed between the origin of this complex composition and the Rector P6rez Armendiriz, who is portrayed in such a privileged place within it. The picture must have been commissioned, then, during the long period of Perez's Rectorship, between 1769 and I8o6.73 However, an analysis of some of the elements represented in the painting can limit considerably the chronological boundaries. The terminus ante quem can be reduced, first of all, by the references to the Inca world, such as the coat of arms in the upper right-hand corner or the effigy of the Inca Don Carlos. None of these symbols could have been used after 178 1, the year of T6pac Amaru's defeat. The use of Inca dress and all cultural remembrance of the Inca Empire was forbidden after that date.74 An examination of the buildings represented in the painting allows us to narrow the time even further.7s Two recognizable coats of arms are exhibited on either side of the central niche of the pediment on the main entrance of the seminary of St Anthony Abbot, although this has been schematically designed. The royal shield of Castile and Leon is to the left, and on the right is a heraldic emblem which has been identified as the coat of arms of Bishop Augustine de Gorichategui, who occupied the diocese of Cuzco from 1770 until the year of his death in 1776.76 A comparison of the painting with the actual building of the Seminary will reveal, however, an important difference in this detail. The coat of arms on the right side over the doorway is not the same as that of the picture. It corresponds to that of Bishop Sarricolea y Olea, under whose patronage the building was erected between 1736 and I740.77 More precise information reveals that Bishop Gorichategui was appointed to the episcopal dignity on 6 December I769,78 only a few weeks before the election of Perez Armendairiz to the Rectorship of the University, which took place on 24 November of the same year. The replacement of the coat of arms of Bishop Sarricolea with that of Gorrichategui in the painting cannot be considered a mere coincidence. Quite the contrary: it should be understood as a gesture of courtesy by Perez Armendairiz to the new Bishop of Cuzco, for reasons which will be explained later. So the painting can be 73 The mitre which covers Jose Perez's head in the picture was painted over the original in the period when he tried to obtain permanent appointment to the bishopric in which he was ad interim (1786-91). The competition for this placement between the mestizo Perez, and the Spaniard Bartolome de las Heras, who was finally appointed, aroused much agitation in the city. The canvas suffered damage and some later restorations, but not to the extreme suggested by Villanueva Urteaga, op. cit. n.

The University itself is here enclosed between solid walls, a sort of hortus conclusus.81 No longer are professors and doctors garrisoned behind this stronghold, but they are rather 'the Giants of this short Paradise'.Thus the University, with its doorway defended by the military Archangel St Michael, reveals its true character as an 'impreg- nable castle', according to the image used by Le6n Pinelo.82 While blocking the entry to the cloister with a flaming sword in hand, St Michael83 is seen to be treading upon two serpents (Pl. I3a). These are not the traditional seven- headed dragon or the more usual curled snake of European iconography. Besides, the Archangel hardly crushes them underfoot but seems rather to allow them to escape in the direction of the College of St Bernard. In fact, these lively serpents derive from Quechua mythology. They are the incarnation of the Amaru, whose presence in this context represents, most obviously, the victory of the Church over Indian paganism, although it also contains other less evident symbolic references to native thought.84 Like Athena, the University harmonizes knowledge with power.85 Armed with knowledge of the Truth, she is ready to defend it, by force if necessary, against wrong and 79 The most probable date is January-September 1771. In that year Ignacio de Castro, future Rector of the College of San Bernardo, celebrated his arrival at Cuzco with a speech in his honour. In October 1771 Gorrichategui was consecrated in Lima and from January 1772 to September 1773 assisted the 6th Concilio Limense, where he gave support to those who defended probabilism, in other words the friends of the Jesuits. As he was appointed by the crown on 6 December 1769 and ratified by a papal Bull on 12 December 1770, one can deduce that his journey to Cuzco took place after the pontifical approbation. One can also assume that P6rez Armendairiz would have tried to influence the new Bishop shortly after the latter's arrival at the city. See Ignacio de Castro, Oracion panege'rica a la feliz llegada del Ilustrisimo Sr. Dr. D. Agustin Gorrichategui, Obispo del Cuzco, Cuzco 1771; Blanco, loc. cit. n. 78 above; P. Macera, 'El Probabilismo en el Perui durante el siglo XVIII', Trabajos de Historia, Lima 1977, H, pp. 100, 118. 80 The text at the foot of the portrait of the Rector reads: 'Do not expect to see united / humility, knowledge and virtue/with more equal exactitude/than in great Master Perez'. ('Ver unidas no esperes/humildad, ciencia y virtud / con igual exactitud / que en el grande Sefior Perez.') The adjectives applied to him might seem immodest, but the praises dedicated to him in the 1794 painting werejust as strong and, like the latter, it can be assumed that the Garden ofSaint Anthony was presented to him as a tribute by his colleagues. 81 As in so many other aspects, the presence of the motif of the 'closed garden' shows the affinity of 18th- century Cuzco painting with the international Gothic style and with the idyllic, sentimental vision of reality which that style developed. On the evolution of the theme of the 'hortus conclusus', in the I5th century, see R6au, op. cit. n. 37 above, 11, 2, p. 101 and E. Mile, The Gothic Image. Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century, New York/ London 1958, p. 238. 82 The complete text inscribed on the outer wall of the Seminary reads: 'To want to count the Giants/of this short paradise/would be an infinite task/for innumer- able are those who have emerged.' ('Querer contar los Gigantes/de este corto Parayso/fuera proceso infinito /porque son innumerables los sujetos que han salido.') The idea of the University as an intellectual fortress had already been developed by Le6n Pinelo in the I7th century. 'You, our true shield, and you who fight for us ... You are our wall, stronger than Achilles ... .' Le6n Pinelo, op. cit. n. 24 above, pp. I 13, 114. In the following century the images took a more military character: 'with the arms still in the hand, the resolution was taken to found this University, as an arsenal of the sacred (arms) ...', in Salazar y Zevallos, op. cit. n. 12 above, unnumbered. 83 The shield bears the usual inscription: Quis sicut Deus que in Altis habitat. 84 See p. 120 and n. i3o below. 85s It is not a chance comparison. On three occasions the University is compared to the Pindus: in the verses relative to the star; to Juan de Isturrizaga; and to Diego Carrasco. The allusion to the noble Pindo shares the strength of the mountain and the prestige of Apollo. The other similes used in the epigrams refer to the flowered garden; the vineyard; the garden of St Anthony and, one, to the Athenaeum of letters.</page><page sequence="18">UNIVERSITY OF CUZCO III heresy. The militant character which the University assumes on this level is aimed at a clearly defined target, not only against evil in general or Indian idolatory, but particu- larly, as we shall see, against the heterodoxy of its rivals at St Bernard. For the main drama is being played out in the far left-hand corner of the composition (Pl. I3c). The cloister of St Bernard, founded and ruled by the Jesuits until 1767, stands in the midst of the fallen heads of heretics being trampled upon by St Thomas.86 Nearby is a double branch of flowers which comes out of the garden of St Anthony and grows over the belfry of the chapel descending into the cloister of St Bernard. Stepping over the branch are three small figures dressed in university gowns and holding their caps in hand. Underneath stands a member of the Society of Jesus, and the same three students, now dressed in doctoral garb, appear in the small cloister next to him. A text on the wall provides the explanation. They are Juan de Esquivel, Diego de Meneses 'and Espejo ... who are descending in order to become the first plants in the garden of St Bernard'. But - as the following verse emphasizes - 'beware that the plants belong to the garden of Anthony the Great'.87 The figures of these three students refer to events which took place around I650 when the first doctoral degrees issued in Cuzco were awarded at the University of St Ignatius. The Jesuit University was created in 1621 as an extension of the College of St Bernard. However, it was initially prevented from functioning by legal action initiated by the University of San Marcos of Lima, and above all by opposition from the Seminary of St Anthony, whose officials had previously been thwarted in their attempt to establish the first university in Cuzco.88 St Ignatius was not therefore able to begin academic activities until it was granted approval under Bishop Jose A. Oc6n (1649-52), who personally bestowed their degrees upon Domingo Zufiiga, Meneses and Esquivel, two of whom had in fact studied at St Anthony Abbot. Consequently one can assume that the author of the Garden's programme wanted to declare his College to be both older and academically superior. In addition he wished to make the point, though it was an obvious exaggeration, that the university graduates of 1649-52 were not pupils of St Bernard but had all belonged to St Anthony.89 It becomes evident from the allusion to this event in the painting and in the accompanying verses that there was serious rivalry between the two 86 Of the three fallen heretics one can recognize Averroes and Calvin. The third is possibly Mahomet. The triumph over heresy was also a favourite theme of the conventual libraries of Europe, such as those of SS Giovanni e Paolo, in Venice, or of the Abbey of Schussenried in Swabia, where the heretics are depicted, uncharacteristically, as playful putti. This detail points to the difference between the Spanish- American reality and that of Europe, for which the subject of heterodoxy had become merely an academic exercise. 87 The complete text of the verses reads: 'Aunque las flores que nacen / reverberan tan brillantes / a los riegos de Bernardo,/sepan que las plantas son/del jardin de Antonio el Magno./Pues Esquivel y Meneses,/y un Espejo Trasluciente,/muy ufanos van vajando (sic)/a ser las plantas primeras/en el jardin de Bernardo./Y para mas florecer,/quieren tambien merecer/estar siempre acompafiados/de la casa de Jesiis/y la Doctrina de Ignacio.' ('Although the flowers which are born/ shine so brightly due to / St Bernard's watering / know that the plants are from / the Garden of Anthony the Great. For Esquivel and Meneses/and a brilliant Espejo [the name Espejo means Looking-glass]/are moving keenly/to be the first plants/of St Bernard's Garden/and to flower thus even more/they wish to deserve/to be always accompanied by the house of Jesus /and the Doctrine of Ignatius.') 88 Villanueva Urteaga, op. cit. n. Io above, p. 6. 89 The College of St Anthony Abbot, founded in 1598, was in effect older than that of St Bernard, created in 16I9. See also n. I i I below.

It will be helpful then, to examine the positions adopted by the two groups and to point out more specifically the issues in the history of both institutions that motivated the painting of the Garden ofSaint Anthony. The creation of the University of St Ignatius of Loyola, and its policy of refusing to grant degrees to those who had studied outside it,90 considerably aggravated the frictions which continually took place between the Seminaries of St Anthony Abbot and St Ber- nard in Cuzco. These disputes reached such a level of violence that in 1669 the Rectors of both institutions signed a document agreeing that the members of their Colleges would not carry weapons.91 But the animosity between the two groups was more than a schoolboy squabble. Anthonians and bernachos (as the Jesuit College students were called) represented two social groups whose antagonism grew over the years. The Anthonians were mestizos and a small percentage of noble Indians who belonged to the middle and lower classes of Cuzco;92 while the others were members of the criollo aristocracy and came from all over the southern Sierra of Peru. For the better part of the seventeenth century the privileges of the latter class had been growing to the point where in the eyes of the native population they represented the active force behind colonial exploitation. This was an ambiguous situation as, on the other hand, the criollos developed a deep resentment toward Spain caused by the limitations placed by the regime on their ambitions and on their access to the higher administrative levels of government.93 Because of their potential for rebellion the metropolitan government, in a state of economic decadence during the second half of the seventeenth century, thought only of bestowing further favours on the criollos. It sought to appease the local aristocracy by 'favouring a repressive feudalism [in order to] allow each criollo to enjoy his encomienda or his business - be it legal or not - on a 90 Supporting their arguments by Gregory XV's Bull, the University of St Ignatius tried to limit the issue of degrees to those who had studied in the College of St Bernard. Nevertheless, Bishop Juan Alonso Oc6n had obtained permission to open the University as long as degrees could be issued to all students from Cuzco, be they Jesuits or Anthonians. See Vargas Ugarte, op. cit. n. io above, xvi-xxI. Contrary to this, the Informe written by Father Juan de Goicochea S.J., in 1696, opposing the foundation of the University of St Anthony, alleged that those who studied at the Seminary could always graduate at St Ignatius and quoted 19 examples, 7 of whom are portrayed on the canvas discussed here, among them Espinoza Medrano 'El Lunarejo', Vasco de Valverde and Arias de la Cerda. (Vargas Ugarte, loc. cit.) 91 Even before 1664 a similar agreement had been signed, with no result. H. Villanueva Urteaga, Historia del Colegio Nacional de Ciencias del Cuzco, Cuzco 1956, p. 3; Vargas Ugarte, op. cit. n. Io above, xI. 92 After J. A. Oc6n, Bishop Pedro de Ortega Sotomayor voted in 1654 for a greater elasticity on the part of the University of St Ignatius, describing the popular character of the Anthonians, who, he said, 'are the apple of this city's eyes, her children, relatives of the nobility and the plebeian'. The Bernardians, on the other hand, were accused of being foreigners, as many of them came from Cuzco's neighbouring towns. In a letter to the King, the city Council described this situation with great clarity. 'The students of St Bernard are foreigners and parvenus ... (some of) their parents and relatives are of the nobility of the city ... Those of San Antonio live poorly and most of them don't dress in a way that they could honestly compete with others better dressed ... (this and the discrepancies in theological schools gives rise to disturbances and riots)'. Vargas Ugarte, op. cit. n. 10 above, xvII, xII. 93 This situation concerned the accountant Juan de Saveata of the Tribunal of Accounts of Lima, who in 168i wrote to the King '. .. there is not a married man from Spain who does not have a civil war in his own family, for his very wife and children vituperate against Spain at all times .. .'. He adds that 'the tribunals, both secular and ecclesiastical, are composed of criollos, and the poison has taken hold in all places .. .' and even 'the corporals of the army are born on this soil', which makes him fear an 'accident' (rebellion), for 'although nobility, faithfulness and obligations will be of assistance, the force of the stars and the constellation (of the American soil) is terrible . . .'. Alfredo Torero, El quechua y la historia social andina, Lima 1974, p. 20 1.</page><page sequence="20">UNIVERSITY OF CUZCO I13 local or regional level'. In this way the pressures the criollos exercised over the mestizo and Indian population were intensified even further.94 The agreement of 1669 did not neutralize the differences which were progressively extended from the University jurisdiction to the entire city. In the letter that the celebrated Bishop of Cuzco and patron of the arts, Don Manuel de Mollinedo, wrote on the subject to the King in 1678, he stated that the disagreements between the Seminaries 'are causing the whole city to be divided and not even the mandates and orders of my predecessors or the authority ofjustice is enough to stop them . .. as [the collegiates] like youths, have lost all respect for it'.95 Finally through his counsel a second university was created in the city of Cuzco so that the students of St Anthony would be able to graduate without being subject to the humiliations they suffered in the Jesuit Academy.96 Nevertheless, when the University of St Anthony Abbot was finally established in 1692 as a Royal and Pontifical College, the conflicts between the two institutions became more acute. The bernachos launched an intense and aggressive campaign, and an Informe to the Viceroy was compiled by Padre Juan de Goicochea, Procurator of the Society ofJesus for the Province of Peru. He pointed out among other things that the Seminary of St Anthony was in need of stable professorship, and that there were not more than two or three professors owing to lack of funds, a claim which was probably exaggerated although basically correct. 97 Poor conditions, shortage of money and consequent academic limita- tions, compared with the comfort and prosperity of St Bernard, were precisely the causes of permanent rivalry and animosity.98 This situation evolved along the same lines during the eighteenth century. Metropoli- tan power was reinforced under the modernization imposed by Charles III in the middle of the century, and in consequence the criollos found even stronger motives for discontent and for rebelliousness against Spain when, according to the policy of Enlightened Despotism, the latter tried once more to strengthen its hold over America. One of the most decisive acts of the policy of reaffirmation was the expulsion, in I767, of the Society ofJesus from the Spanish Empire. The consequences of that action had wide repercussions in Viceregal Peru, for since the beginning of the century the criollo unrest had been nourished by the education that young aristocrats received in Jesuit colleges. The doctrine known as probabilism, spread by the Jesuits, represented an opening to a more liberal attitude in matters of a moral order. Against the dictates of authority, it defended the legitimacy of the individual's freedom of choice to opt for 'the least probable 94 Ibid., p. 203; Pablo Macera, op. cit. n. I above, p. I58; Manuel Burga, 'La sociedad colonial', in C. Aranibar and others, Nueva Historia General del Perui, Lima i98o, pp. 94 ff. 9s Having been educated by the Jesuits, Bishop Mollinedo had a friendly relationship with the Univer- sity of St Ignatius; and, although he defended the basic right of the Anthonians, he never openly solicited the opening of a second university. The Ecclesiastic Council undertook this task, by making requests to the Pope and the King. Villanueva Urteaga, op. cit. n. xo above, pp. I0, I I. 96 In the letter of 14 March 1678 quoted above, written by Bishop Mollinedo to the King, the latter recom- mends specifically that the Anthonian students should not be obliged to take courses in St Ignatius in order to graduate, but should '. .. study in their own college with their teachers ... for ... serious troubles are (thus) avoided . . . with the differences between Thomist and Jesuit opinions'. Villanueva Urteaga, loc. cit. n. 95 above. 97 See n. 90 above. 98 Therefore, when Perez Armendairiz finally let his voice be heard, in 178o, he requested appointments to professorships offered by the Royal Council of the 21 May 1697 which had never materialized.

In 1772, by order of the Crown, the Bishops of the Viceroyalty of Peru met in the VI Concilio Limense to discuss these issues. In spite of heated debates, and the efforts of Bishop Pedro Angel de Espineyra under pressure from Viceroy Amat, the conclusions of the Council did not succeed in formally condemning the probabilist doctrine. The teachings of the Jesuits had such a wide following among criollo intellectuals that one may perhaps grasp the direction of thinking among the most advanced member of the College of St Bernard by analysing a clandestine text entitled Antorcha Luminosa (i773) which has lately been attributed to the jurist Francisco Ruiz Cano.0oo In that paper, after recogniz- ing the existence of only two certainties - dogma and mathematics (a judgement that implies a reconciliation of Religion and Science) - liberty in all the facets of human conduct and knowledge is defended against the principle of authority. Even the ideal of nationalist aspiration is proclaimed against the standardizing policy of the Spanish Empire. It is somewhat paradoxical that the criollos, whose political purpose had always been conciliatory or reformist, were being sustained ideologically by the most liberal ideas in circulation in America at the time; while the Inca noblemen and the mestizos, who were actively revolutionary, were followers of the Thomist doctrine in religious matters and supported an absolute monarchy as their political ideal. Thomism and absolutism were behind the Inca Renaissance movement which flourished among the caciques in Cuzco during the eighteenth century. John Rowe, who first pointed to the intellectual and political importance of that current of thought, observed that a new edition of the work by the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, published in 1727, served as an inspiration. The scheme of the group was based on the purpose of obtaining for the Indians nothing short of the right to participate in the religious and administrative organizations, as well as to gain access to all levels of education (from which they were at the time excluded). Also they defended the right to equality before the law and justice, and the abolition of the mita, together with all other forms of servile exploitation. The most extreme among them proposed the armed seizure of power to achieve independence from Spain in order to establish a new paternalistic and nativist monarchy which would reign over all other nations without exploiting them.'1' A considerable section of the mestizo population, linked by bonds of blood and affection to the native people, shared the ideals of a renaissance and the political 99 The purpose of those who defended the doctrine was to update the teachings of the Church and the lives of the faithful to the circumstances of the new times, far removed from the sternness of primitive Christianity, and so avoid members leaving the Church because of conflicts of conscience caused by its traditional auster- ity.

Without doubt the most influential of such sympathizers were members of the secular Church of Cuzco, some of whom shared the same aspira- tions, and even offered tacit support to the rebellions provoked by the movement.102 These groups were sustained by the orthodoxy of St Thomas Aquinas, whose ideas were not only officially approved by the Council of Trent, but also embodied a medieval mentality which coincided with their own. In a certain way this was then a rebellious traditionalism, parallel to the attitude of their friends among the native nobility who wished to return to a golden age in which justice and social peace would reign. It was a traditionalism largely employed as a weapon to argue before the political authorities against the Jesuits and particularly against their criollo disciples, who formed the main target of the mestizo intellectuals. This was especially true after the expulsion of the Society of Jesus and the attempts by the Spanish crown to make their doctrines appear tantamount to heresy.'03 Jos6 Perez Armendiriz, elected Rector of the University of St Anthony in November 1769, seems to have been the most remarkable sympathizer with the Inca national movement among the secular clergy. From his origin and background he was also best suited to head the struggle of St Anthony against the Jesuits of St Bernard and their criollo pupils. The way in which the College of St Bernard is represented in the painting clearly reflects that position. When the Jesuits were expelled from Spain and her colonies in 1767 Don Ram6n Velasco, the previous Rector of the University of St Anthony, felt the time was ripe to gain a decisive victory over the academic institutions of the Society. He applied to the Viceroy asking for the suppression of the University of St Ignatius, and for all the buildings belonging to it to be given to St Anthony; as well as that, the College of St Bernard should lose the right of 'reply' in all public ceremonies.104 Such judicial proceedings were very slow in Viceregal times. In 1769 the Precentor (Chantre) of the Cathedral, Jos6 Segura y Melo, was appointed to be the new Rector of St Bernard; by coincidence, in December of that same year the Panamanian Don Agustin de Gorrichate- gui was named Bishop of Cuzco.s05 Perhaps encouraged by the moral support of the new Bishop, who was a man of modern ideas favourably disposed towards Jesuit probabilism, Jos Segura y Melo and his Vice-Rector, Miguel de Iturrizaga, intensified their campaign to defend themselves from the accusations of being followers (as indeed they were) of the Jesuits.'06 Earlier, in September 1769, they had organized a public oath before a notary to prove their loyalty to Thomism. The following month, 'in order to accredit the profession of the Thomist School (they even placed) an effigy of the Angelic Doctor St Thomas over 102 See Aparicio Vega, op. cit. n. 66 above. 103 The church itself never condemned probabilism. Not even the Concilio Limense convoked by Viceroy Amat in 1772 to please Charles III, shortly after the expulsion of the Order, succeeded in this. Macera, op. cit. n. 79 above, II, p. 99. 104 To deprive it of the right of 'reply' - that is, the opportunity to participate in public, religious or civil ceremonies, with pieces of oratory composed by professors or collegiates - was virtually the equivalent of extinguishing the College by reducing it to a purely private existence. The request was presented by Don Francisco Espinoza de los Monteros on behalf of the Rector Ram6n de Velasco. Eguiguren, op. cit. n. 12 above, I, ccxxxiiiff.; L. A.

A keen and patient man, the new Rector understood that the time had not yet arrived to insist on the demands of his predecessor. The buildings of the Society ofJesus, which were so desirable because of the quality of their architecture and their location, would not be assigned to St Anthony without the approval of the Ecclesiastic Chapter of Cuzco and by consent of Bishop Gorrichategui, who, given his convictions, was not of a mind to grant these concessions; nor was it convenient to insist on silencing the College of St Bernard. Furthermore, it was shortly after this, in i772, that the University of St Ignatius was suppressed by decision of the Junta de Temporalidades of Lima.los A little before or after that date PWrez Armend iriz probably had the Garden of Saint Anthony painted. Considering that it was not a suitable moment to insist on legal proceedings,'09 yet feeling the need to express his own standpoint, the painting was the best and most subtle way he could devise, both to encourage his colleagues at the University and to present the Anthonian thesis convincingly to Bishop Gorrichategui and the members of the Chapter, in the hope of influencing their opinion. Homage was paid to the Bishop by the painting of his coat of arms over the portal of the Seminary.110 This was also a gesture of modesty by which the University placed itself under the protection of the new authority. But when Gorrichategui was invited to see the work, the true message surely did not escape him. The canvas contained a penetrating criticism of the College of St Bernard in the midst of an elaborate glorification of the Christian and academic merits of the University of St Anthony Abbot. Not only did it declare that St Anthony was the oldest academic institution in Cuzco and that the University of St Ignatius had taken advantage of its efforts to obtain its own recognition; but furthermore, by locating the building of St Bernard among the heads of Luther, Averroes and other heretics trampled upon by St Thomas, the reprehensible character 'of the doctrine of Ignatius' which was taught in that 'house of (the Society) ofJesus' was made quite clear, as the verses on the walls of the College imply. Written to flatter Bishop Gorrichategui, but also to open his eyes, their apparent meaning is praise of the Society ofJesus; but the explicit mention of the Doctrine ofIgnatius refers to the reasons which caused the Order to fall into disgrace.l"' 107 The theology of St Thomas was the antidote against the probabilist infection. In the VIth Concilio Limense, Father J. M. Durain said in his attack against Jesuit doctrine, that probabilism 'gives vassals ... opinion against their Prince as to authorize them... to attempt against his sacred life (of which the very mention causes horror) ... which Regicide and Tyrannicide, was called by St Thomas, who thought in a different way: doctrine contrary to that of the Apostles'. Earlier a portrait of St Ignatius of Loyola presided in the hall of the College of St Bernard. See Vargas Ugarte, op. cit. n. 10 above, p. I97.

See the text in Eguiguren, op. cit. n. 12 above, I, ccxxxix ff. 110 See n. 76 above. 11 There are various reasons why, despite the long enmity between the two colleges, the verses inscribed on the wall of St Bernard had to maintain an appearance of respect for the Jesuit Order: I. Probabilism was never openly condemned by the Council of Lima or the Vatican. 2. Bishop Gorrichategui had participated in the Council and was one of the outstanding modernists defending the Jesuits and their doctrine; if his support was being sought, it would have been unwise to offend his opinions. 3. Nor would it be acceptable for an important public painting to appear to be an open attack by one religious institution against another. 4. Last, but not least, the chief argument in the scene is the defence of the aspirations of St Anthony (founded in 1598) on the grounds of its greater antiquity than St Bernard (founded in I619). Moreover the incident described took place about 1650 when Jesuit doctrine had still not been exposed tojudgement.</page><page sequence="24">UNIVERSITY OF CUZCO 117 The probabilism of the Jesuits and criollos was in this way tacitly criticized, while the Thomist orthodoxy of the University of St Anthony was made to stand for Christian righteousness.112 In the event the patience and ability of Perez Armendairiz were fully rewarded years later in 1780, when he applied for and obtained for his University the buildings that had once belonged to the Society ofJesus.113 In addition to glorifying the Christian University of St Anthony in its battle against the heterodoxy of the College of St Bernard, the painting seems to have yet another purpose: to stress the national and cultural values of the native population. This is suggested also the image of the famous Cristo de los Temblores (Christ of the Earthquakes)114 of Cuzco. The nationalistic tone is also confirmed by the presence of prominent mestizo intellectuals of Cuzco among the University graduates."s However, the manifest agreement of the author of the Garden's programme with the ideals of the Inca Renaissance is more clearly expressed in other symbolic images within the picture. The Inca national movement consisted mainly in the reactivation of oral traditions and means of collective behaviour, rather than a system expressed through the written word in literary or philosophical texts. It was a life style rather than a doctrine, and as such, elements of form played a vital role in its definition. Consequently a large part of its energy was channelled into an artistic movement which manifested itself in the social scene through a wide variety of expression: not only painting and sculpture, but also the plastic arts, costumes, crafts, decorative arts, tapestry, music and stage settings."6 So apparent was the artistic presence of the native elite in Viceregal Peru in the eighteenth century, that the political and ecclesiastical authorities felt the need to respond with loyalist imagery in an effort to counteract the effect that the dissemination of the Inca Renaissance had on the Viceregal community.17 On the other hand, some mestizos in the secular clergy, who sympathized with the cacique movement, adhered to the new Inca 112 The conclusion that the work contains a doctrinal censure of the rival College is derived from a graphic reading of the composition and the pointed mention of the notorious doctrine oflgnatius, which was very much in everybody's mind when the picture was being executed. Just as the painting is divided in horizontal zones, there is also a vertical demarcation. The right hand of Christ, representing the vigour of the theological field, contains, at the base, the images of enemies and heretics. On the other hand, the opposite side contains the forces of temporal power, and, at the base, a friendly institution: the cloister of the Franciscans who, together with the Dominicans and the secular clergy, participated in teaching in St Anthony. 113 With great diplomacy, P6rez Armendiriz reques- ted, on 13 May I78o, what appeared to be less than his predecessor Ram6n Velazco; he actually obtained from Bishop Moscoso y Peralta what had been requested and more - the buildings, library, classrooms and other rooms of the College of the 'regulars expatriated', as well as the income he solicited. A few months earlier, on I6July I779, Dr Ignacio de Castro, a friend of Agustin Gorrichategui, took over the Rectorship and the revitalization of the College of St Bernard. See R. Vargas Ugarte, op. cit. n. Io above, p. 4. 114 See n. Io above. 115 It is also revealing to see, among the first graduates, such people as Father Diego Carrasco, priest of the parish of Indians of Santiago. 116 This valuable artistic expression was drastically interrupted due to the failure of Tupac Amaru's Indian rebellion and the prohibition imposed on all kinds of symbols, dress or paintings which made any kind of allusion to the old Inca Empire. See Rowe, op. cit. n. 2 above. Some continued to be produced, although much simplified, by the native peasants, such as, for instance, the keros, decorated wooden cups. F. Stastny, op. cit. n. 3 above, 1981, 32, p. 229. 117 That is how an official iconography was originated with subjects such as the King of Spain defending the Eucharist, which contains veiled menaces against the Indians; or the conciliatory inventions of the Jesuits like the Wedding of Martin de Loyola with an Inca princess. See F. Stastny, op. cit. n. 4 above, p. 15.</page><page sequence="25">118 FRANCISCO STASTNY iconography and adopted some of its motifs. This was the case of the Rector P6rez Armendiriz, who included three revealing images in the large allegorical composition: the picture of Don Carlos Inca; the heraldic emblem of Cuzco; and the double serpent. The Marquis Don Carlos Inca appears at the side of the Vice-Rector Hermosa dressed in the collegiate sash of St Anthony and wearing the insignia of Inca royalty on his forehead.1s He stands out among all the other figures by being portrayed full length.119 Although there are no means for a positive identification, because the name Carlos was used by all the descendants of the Inca Huayna Capac on the Paullu side, the cacique who is most probably represented here is Don Juan Bustamante Carlos Inca. He deserved special distinction and recognition in the middle of the eighteenth century as he was an authentic heir to the royal Inca dynasty, and such was his position that he was asked to head an Indian rebellion in 1735. In 1747 Juan Bustamante travelled to Spain in order to request the award of a title of nobility from the King, an event which accounts for the title of Marquis which is given him in the picture.120 The verses next to his portrait on the canvas could not be more explicit in revealing the feelings of sympathy and veneration the Anthonians held for the noble Inca whose presence, reads the text, 'honoured ... this noble, humble house'.121 Close to the heads of the saints, in heaven, are four coats of arms. On one side are those of Pope Innocent XIII and of Antonio de la Raya, Bishop of Cuzco, founder of the College. On the opposite side, close to St Anthony (similarly relating imperial hierarchy and regional authority) are the emblems of Castile and Leon, together with a heraldic device of the Inca city of Cuzco depicted according to an image formulated in the circles of the native elite (Pl. I3b). This is not the heraldic huaca, surrounded by eight condors, granted to the city of Cuzco as an emblem by Royal Order in I540.122 Rather it is an 118 He wears the mascaipacha or imperial diadem and a golden sun on his breast. 119 Only two people are portrayed full length: Carlos Inca and Crist6bal Traslavifias. 120 Crist6bal Paullu Topa Inca was the legitimate son of Huayna Capac, brother of Huascar and Atahualpa. He collaborated with the Spanish conquistadors. He had a son, Carlos Inca, who in turn had a son, Carlos Melchor Inca. The latter travelled to Spain in I602, and met Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, who mentions him in his book. Melchor Carlos obtained the Order of Santiago, but was not permitted to return to Peru. He died in i6io in Alcali de Henares. His son, Melchor Carlos Inca (II) lived in poverty at court around the year I630. We do not know what relationship this last had with Carlos Inca, the Royal Lieutenant, portrayed in the series of the Procession of Corpus Christi (Archbishop's Museum, Cuzco); or with Juan Bustamente Carlos Inca. Finally there was a Carlos Inca, graduate of the College of San Borja in Cuzco, who participated in the 1814 revolution. From which we can deduce that through the College of Saint Anthony could have passed: Melchor Carlos (I), before travelling to Spain, Carlos Inca, the Royal Lieutenant, and Bustamante Carlos Inca. Because of the closeness of the dates and the similarity of the names, it is most probable that the portrait is of the last, or anyway of one of his sons. Vargas Ugarte, op. cit. n. Io above, p. I5I.

The rainbow places the action on the Caypacha or Earthly World;123 and the tower is a symbol of Inca royalty derived from a disjunctive transformation of the imperial Inca diadem.124 The presence of this coat of arms (which is larger than the emblem of the Spanish crown) clearly reveals the political inclinations of PNrez Armend iriz and his colleagues at the University, who shared the Utopian ideals of the Inca nobility. At the same time it reaffirms their opposition to the attitudes of the enlightened criollos and their reformist hopes.125 It is not clear how, being educated in strict Christian dogmas, the caciques succeeded in reconciling their faith with the idolatrous practices of the Indian peasant masses.126 The ambivalence is further expressed by images such as that of the two snakes at the feet of the Archangel St Michael. Having confirmed the relative success of its campaigns for the extirpation of idolatry, the Church itself eventually assumed a more lenient position with regard to the beliefs of the native population.127 Modernist thought also helped to give more flexibility to Catholic dogmatism by sustaining a reconciliation of religious principles with science and with the particular needs of regional historical situations. It may be assumed (although there is no written evidence) that the nativist movement sought to reconcile ancient beliefs with Christian religion by stressing the ethical and philosophical values of the former. Christian tradition itself, in its retrieval of the philosophers of classic antiquity, provided an example which might have enticed them to follow a similar path.128 That such dualism existed is proved by the Inca elite's acceptance of the pagan practices of the peasant masses, which they must have known through their daily dealings with them. It is also revealed in the attitude assumed by the rebel noble curacas, all of whom embraced a kind of pagan political messianism tempered with respect, and even devotion, towards the Church and the clergy.129 The pair of snakes dominated by St Michael (P1. I3a) embody the Andean concept of Amaru. They are the two great mythical serpents Yacumama and Sachamama who, as they pass successively from one stratum of the Inca cosmos to another, maintain all the strata linked together. Departing from the tectonic underworld of Ukju Pacha they 123 See Valcaircel, op. cit. n. 44 above, I, p. 55. The rainbow associated with images of the Inca is a common theme on the keros. 124 Rowe, op. cit. 1951, n. 3 above, p. 263. The tower is the result of the transformation of the tassel of the mascaipaicha in colonial art. It is frequently to be found on keros and weavings. On the subject of disyunction, see Stastny, op. cit. n. 3 above, 1979, p. 143. 125 A criollo, without doubt, would have assumed the official emblem to represent Cuzco. 126 Rowe, op. cit. n. 2 above, p. 5, considers on the other hand that the caciques 'were better Christians than the Spaniards themselves ... and that the philosophical religion of the royal court of Cuzco disappeared completely'. It is possible that this may have been the case as a living tradition, but Rowe himself draws attention to the evocative value of the Comentarios of the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega. His influence in this field, as in the political, must not be underestimated. See Pierre Duviols, 'L'Inca Garcilaso de le Vega, interprete humaniste de la religion incaique', Diogine, xlvii, 1964, P. 39. 127 Distinction was made between idolatry and witch- craft and, according to the policy of the Church, attempt was made to integrate pagan festivities into Christian celebrations.

There is no doubt that together with illustrations of myths of historic content those images contain elements of the religious and philosophical beliefs of the Incas. The only scholarly publication on the keros is Rowe, op. cit. 196I, n. 3 above. 129 One of the principal demands of the caciques was for the institution of an indigenous clergy.</page><page sequence="27">120 FRANCISCO STASTNY eventually arrive at the celestial heights ofJanan Pacha, where the first serpent provides rain in the shape of Lightning-Thunder; and the second, fertility embodied in the Rainbow.130 The snakes are defeated by the Archangel but are not annihilated, and they give the impression that they intend to escape from the foot which treads on their tails.131 They may be subjugated by the superiority of the revealed truth of Christianity, but the thought which they embody still survives due to the intrinsic ethical merits attributed to it by its admirers. In a similar way, Socrates or Plato were able to appear in European paintings overcome but not destroyed by the chariot of the Triumphant Church. So the Garden of Saint Anthony is a complex synthesis. It reveals the grandeur and excellence of the University of St Anthony Abbot sustaining it by all the divine, theological (Thomist), intellectual, ideological (Inca Renaissance) and social (Indian and mestizo) forces which its authorities were able to invoke, in order to show its superiority - through both merit and antiquity - over the rival College of St Bernard. Around these themes revolves the subtle duel of wills between a Bishop and a Rector who would be future Bishop ofCuzco. The first was a Panamanian criollo of liberal thought and modernistic education. The other was a mestizo of ancient roots in Paucartambo, a friend of the Indians and their culture, who had been educated in Thomism and mellowed by the ideals in Garcilaso's book of a reconciliation between the Christian world and American antiquity. The meeting of these two positions gave rise to the arduous iconographic argument presented here. Closely related to the main idea of the Garden ofSaint Anthony is a small painting for private devotion in which SS Thomas Aquinas and Anthony Abbot appear with spades in their hands as if cultivating the soil (P1. I4b). Their efforts give abundant fruit. Around a bronze fountain crowned with the usual figure representing Fame,132 professors, doctors, cardinals and bishops grow between the leaves of trees and large potted plants. All are dressed with the Collegiate sash of the University of St Anthony in which they are supposed to have studied (P1. I5b). The principal part of the composition above the garden consists of a huge heart depicted with some anatomical details. Inside it, as a perfect example of Christian love, is the Holy Family accompanied by the little St John, SS Anne and Joachim.133 The 130 In the intermediate level of the Kai Pacha (terrestrial world) Yacumama is transformed into a great river and the other serpent into a gigantic tree, before undergoing its final metamorphosis prior to reaching heaven. See Valcaircel, op. cit. n. 44 above, i, pp. 8o, 84; F. Pease, Los tiltimos Incas del Cuzco, Lima 1972, P. 59. 131 One of them, in effect like Sachamama, who walked erect on the earth in the form of an old tree trunk, lifts its head and seems to rise. 132 Fame announces the successes of the Anthonian students. This image, and others similar to it which were placed on top of fountains and towers, suggests that in Viceregal art the image of Fame was usually assimilated with that of a military trumpeter. The transition between these two types is found in the military archangels, which were often represented as regiments of musketeers with flags and musicians. On the other hand, fountains and towers were often crowned with figures of the Archangel St Michael, in accordance with an old European tradition. The image which once stood on the fountain of the Plaza de Armas in Lima, finished in I65i, seems to have been one of these hybrids. Rafil Porras Barrenechea, 'La fuente de la Plaza de Armas en Lima redescubierta', in Haydee Di Domenico Suazo, La Fuente de la Plaza Mayor de Lima, Lima 1974, PP. 33, 38. 133 The model for the holy heart derives from the prints by the Wierix brothers, created at the end of the i6th century, which show the soul cleaning and taking care of the heart.

The heart is surrounded, in heaven, by four particular Saints. The combination of figures is not common and can only be explained as a symbolic allusion to the university life of Viceregal Peru. In fact it is unusual to depict only two of the Doctors of the Church as here, with St Augustine and St Gregory set at the highest level of the composition. The first was chosen in order to stress the central theme of the love of God,135 and the second as the universal patron of those who dedicate their lives to learning. It is even less common to portray an Evangelist alone, as is the case here with St Mark. Placed directly above St Thomas, he symbolizes the Royal and Pontifical University of Lima which was founded by the Dominicans under Mark's patronage.136 The fourth Saint, just above St Anthony, is a soldier in Roman armour holding a Christian banner. He represents St Martin of Tours and symbolizes the Jesuit College of Lima, which bears his name. The College of St Anthony Abbot of Cuzco was related by a special link to that of St Martin. In 1713 the Viceroy Ladr6n de Guevara gave the Cuzco Seminary the right to use 'on the Collegiate sashes the insignia and the emblem of a crown in the same way that they had been given' to the Lima College.137 It is reasonable to assume, then, that this little painting was commissioned by an ecclesiastical dignitary from Cuzco who, as was frequent at the time, would have begun his studies at the College of St Martin in Lima and probably received a degree at the University of St Mark, before graduating from St Anthony Abbot. The main message which he wanted to transmit in the picture, however, was related to the perfection of Christian love which could be attained through university studies. Being a work for private worship, it does not have reference to the disputes with the criollos and to the political questions which worried PWrez Armendairiz. In addition its style reveals that it was executed at a time (1785-I 8oo) when the conflicts with St Bernard had been superseded. Nevertheless, the existence of this painting proves that the imagery created by PWrez Armendairiz of university education as spiritual gardening had achieved some diffusion in the academic circles of Cuzco. In 1794, some twenty years after the completion of the Garden of Saint Anthony, a new work was painted in homage to Jose P&amp;rez Armendairiz (P1. I4a). This time, continuing the botanical symbolism, the University was represented as a tree in whose branches the 134 The Marian cult, promoted in particular by the Jesuits, reached its apotheosis with the great feasts which the city and University of Lima organized to celebrate the official adoption of the mystery of the Immaculate Conception, decreed by Philip III. These celebrations culminated in the oath taken on 3 February 1619 by the University of San Marcos, according to which '... no one can receive a degree ... in any faculty at all unless he first vows an oath ... always to hold, believe and teach ... that the Virgin Mary was conceived without original sin'. The University of Cuzco, however, had not adopted that vow.

'The sciences are described', he wrote, 'as a combined exuberant tree: the insignia are the leaves, the cap-covered heads are the fruits.' But the concept has deeper implications, because the tree of knowledge is inevitably associated with the tree which caused the Fall. Le6n Pinelo himself so interprets it: 'I will call the Academy the Paradise of pleasure in which the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil is located.'139 Nevertheless, the absence of all explicit theological allusions in the composition is noteworthy.140 Times had changed in twenty years. The Illustration had been adopted as the official thought of the University. Although the tree still alludes to the Garden of Eden it is already, by the nakedness of its imagery, the tree of knowledge conquered by reason.141 The symbol can serve both for one thing and the other. And the very ambivalence between Dogma and Reason is already a pointer to the new era.142 The Rector P6rez Armendairiz is portrayed from the waist up in the lower part of the composition, and behind him emerges the trunk of a tree which follows the genealogical prototype of the Tree ofJesse. That is precisely the significance of the way the figures are here set out. The spiritual paternity of the present and future generations of St Anthony's pupils is attributed to the Rector. In the words inscribed beside his portrait: 'The house of Perez will now reign for all time, as will his descendants and those born of them.'143 This allusion to the descendants of a clergyman would seem out of place were the phrase not used in a spiritual sense. In fact the emphasis in the text is most significant. Those who admired the Rector thought of him in terms other than those of a simple 138 Although the idea of comparing education with spiritual gardening is classical in origin, the iconogra- phy of the tree of knowledge is Carolingian and is to be found in several miniatures of the period. One of the first literary examples is the poem by Theodulf of Orleans (d. 821) in which Grammar, Rhetoric and Dialectic sit at the foot of a tree on which the Quadrivium (Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy and Music) flowers. See Witt- kower, op. cit. n. 20 above, p. 83. 139 Later on Le6n Pinelo would describe the University as '. . . a fruitful tree in which the understanding ... finds food and nourishment'. Pinelo, op. cit. n. 24 above, pp. 73, I00, 15. For the rest the image of the University as tree of good and evil is aJudeo-Christian counterpart of the humanist theme of the University as Palace of Good and Evil. See Santiago Sebastian, op. cit. n. 42 above, p. 297. 140 The difference is evident if we compare it with the traditional depictions of the Tree of Knowledge, which were closely linked with religious thought. See for instance the print by Master D.S., where the tree emerges from the body of Philosophy and is surrounded in heaven by the Trinity, the Immaculate Virgin and the four Doctors of the Church. It is on the frontispiece of Reisch's Margarita Philosphica, Basle 15o8; Van Marle, op. cit. n. 28 above, 11, pp. 245-6 and fig. 267. 141 Comparing the image of the Tree with the previous iconography the difference is evident. The medieval concept of the University expressed in the Garden ofSaint Anthony is to grow individuals who bloom like flowers in the garden of spiritual life. The new university of the enlightenment contributes to develop the corpus of human knowledge by nurturing the Tree of Knowledge. 142 This last was the attitude which is evident in the decorative programmes of German convent libraries which, in spite of the onset of the new learning, tried to maintain the principal Philosophia est ancilla Theologia. The murals of the library of San Florian, near Linz, illustrate this well. Here Pallas and the Virtues take hands to fight the Vices and to express the unity of Knowledge with Religion. Although medieval and archaic in Europe, as Adrian observes, in a Spanish- American context these ideas indicate, on the contrary, the opening of the American world to the enlightenment around the 1790s. Dr Ignacio de Castro was one of the most eloquent exponents of these attitudes in Cuzco, where he attempted to conciliate the worship of God with the sciences. See G. Adriani, op. cit. n. 40 above, pp. 63 ff.; and nn. 58, 6o above. 143 The Latin text on the canvas reads 'Jam Peretis domus hic cunctis dominabitur aevis/et nati natorum, et qui nacentur ab illis'. The transcription which we offer of this and other texts is literal, with the errors and abbreviations found in the original. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Father Dr Armando Nieto Velez S.J. for his kind collaboration in translating and identifying the quotations in Latin which follow, some of which presented great difficulty due to the poor spelling of the originals.</page><page sequence="30">UNIVERSITY OF CUZCO 123 university professor. His teachings, in order to last forever in 'his descendants and those born of them', must have contained a more consistent doctrine, ideals that would have provided alternative political projects to solve the serious social problems faced in that period by the Vice-royalty of Peru. In 1794, when the canvas was painted, Jose PWrez completed twenty-five years as Rector of St Anthony, and in the same year was appointed to the important office of Precentor of the Cathedral of the city of Cuzco. This point must have seemed an ideal occasion upon which to pay tribute to the illustrious clergyman.144 His colleagues' agreement to keep him for so long as Rector can be attributed to his exceptional personal gifts and the success with which he had conducted the University's dispute against the Jesuits. But it was also due to the merit of his teaching, which turned St Anthony into a living centre for the diffusion of the renewed ideals which were then spreading through American lands. The Cuzco Seminary had become, through P6rez's preaching, a nursery for revolutionaries, producing, for example, the priest Ildefonso Mufiecas and the leaders of the Cuzco rebellion of 1814.145 The ideological action which he stimulated, combined with the long term of his Rectorship, explain why the University of St Anthony came to be thought of as 'the house of P&amp;rez'. There can be no doubt that the ideas of Prez Armend iriz about the future of America had changed with the passing of time. In the painting of 1770-76 his sympathies favoured a utopian restoration of an Inca monarchy; but in 1784, after the terrible experience of the defeat of the rebellion ofJuan Gabriel Condorcanqui, Ttipac Amaru II (fallen in I781), his thoughts developed along more serious lines. It is not strange that he and those who surrounded him found themselves in sympathy with the uncompromising phrases of the Book of Ecclesiastes. There they would have read that 'there are spirits that are created for vengeance ... (and that) serpents and the sword taking vengeance upon the ungodly, unto destruction . . . all these were created for vengeance'. There can be no doubt who were the ungodly in the eyes of PWrez and his friends: none other than the corregidores and those who represented the system of colonial exploitation, who transgressed the most basic Christian teachings day after day in their mistreatment of the native population. As the activities of the University reveal, in the opinion of the Rector it was necessary to prepare those divine avengers who, according to the words of the Bible, 'in his command- ments ... shall feast, and ... shall be ready upon earth when need is' in order to end the injustice of time.146 Even more appropriate to the situation is the first part of that particular chapter of Ecclesiastes partly quoted on the arched banner held over the head of the Rector by two 144 This tenure in the Rectorate is exceptionally long. The norm in the colonial Lima University was for the position to be renewed every two years, in which feature it was at this time more democratic than it is today. Valcircel, op. cit. n. 136 above, p. 46. 145 Already by 1786 a grave accusation against Rector Perez was made by the Intendente Benito de la Mata Linares, who linked him with the rebellious indigenous movements and opposed his interim appointment to the Bishopric. See Aparicio Vega, op. cit. n. 66 above, pp. 232 ff.; see also nn. 70, 72 above. 146 The mention of serpents in the Biblical text of course particularly suited the situation in Cuzco with the place accorded to serpents in Andean thought. Somehow the Spanish version is even more appropriate: '. .. El fuego ... la hambre y la muerte ... se hicieron para castigo; como ... las serpientes y la espada vengadora que extermina los impios'. One must add that it is difficult to believe that Perez openly supported armed rebellion. He would have been unable to retain his post if this were the case. But the idea must have germinated among his hearers as a natural consequence of what was being taught at the Anthonian university. See Ecclesiastes 39. 33, 36, 37. See also n. 130 above.</page><page sequence="31">124 FRANCISCO STASTNY members of the college.147 The verses celebrate the wise man who 'will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients', 'he shall pass into strange countries: for he shall try good and evil among men', as Perez did with the history of the Incas. And above all, like the Rector himself, the wise 'shall shew forth the discipline he hath learned ... and the church shall shew forth his praise'. The particular phrases inscribed on the banner perfectly express the feelings of admiration which disciple and colleagues had for him: 'Many shall praise his wisdom ... The memory of him shall not depart away: and his name shall be in request from generation to generation.'148 PWrez Armendairiz had assumed the role of a leader. He was the living symbol of the aspiration of the mestizo and the Inca dlite in face of the oppression that the Spanish and the criollos inflicted on the country. He also embodied, in the city of Cuzco, the reaffirmation of nationalist ideals as opposed to the pretensions of the chapetones.149 The phrase from Ecclesiastes ('his name will be repeated from generation to generation') had, then, to be clarified by an additional text. Not only would his name, but his house reign for all times. And the impression that this new reading leaves is that 'Pereti domus' represents not only the University of St Anthony, but also the community of all those who shared the ideals ofjustice of the Rector P6rez Armendiriz. THE UNIVERSITY DEFENDED: THOMAS AQUINAS, ANTI-MARIAN, AND ANTHONY ABBOT, PROTECTOR As might be expected, an image like that of the Garden of Saint Anthony did not spring from virgin soil. The practice of using paintings for certain specific university purposes (portraits of rectors and professors, graduation pictures) was widespread in Cuzco during the eighteenth century. It is not surprising that this should have happened in a city where a school of painting had emerged which had, by that time, developed a special branch for the mass production of pictures for commercial use and for export, somewhat similar to the situation in Flanders two centuries earlier. The earliest identified precedent for university iconography in Cuzco painting consists of two large canvasses in the Museum of Art in Lima (P1. I6a, b), which at one time were surely displayed in the General Lecture Hall of the University of Cuzco. They represent the patron saints Anthony Abbot and Thomas Aquinas surrounded by a complicated network of theological allusions. As with the Garden, the compositions are conceived as allegorical images, whose significance could not be fully understood without the explanatory texts. St Anthony and St Thomas figured from the outset on the coat of arms of the University of Cuzco and are therefore closely related to its iconography. The former was 147 The student on the left holds the shield of Castile and Leon; the other holds the emblem of the Rector. 148 Ecclesiastes 39. 12-13. The same words were used to exalt Thomas Aquinas in the print by A. Collaert mentioned previously (see n. 17 above). 149 The occasion was the vacancy of the Bishopric of Cuzco, in I8o6, when the previous holder, the Spaniard Bartolome de las Heras, became Archbishop of Lima. Perez having occupied the seat ad interim between 1786 and 1791, his supporters felt that it was his right to be appointed. But the authorities hesitated before granting him this important position. The whole city agitated in his favour and placards appeared denouncing the fact that 'all effort is being made to put in a chapetdn bishop'. (Chapetdn was the name given to Spaniards recently arrived in America, who when travelling to the highlands of the Andes or exposed to the strong sun, would become red in the cheeks (chapas).

The enthusiasm for his teachings was so great that the 'collegiate students ... bound themselves by oath to follow' his doctrine.150 The scheme of the two pictures follows the compositional formula usually applied to paintings of the Immaculate Conception, with the difference that the saints, rather than being suspended in heaven, are at ground level and of disproportionate size. They stand over a defeated dragon surrounded by the symbols of their attributes and in front of a landscape seen from above. The different elements around them are organized at four levels established horizontally. The highest corresponds to the theological merits of the Saint; the next, to his hagiographic and thaumaturgical attributes; the third represents the University; and the last, the triumph over evil with some symbols related to the life of the Saint. In both compositions the University has been suggested simply by two flowered cloisters, each of which has at its centre a large garland of roses (P1. I7a). This is the first, timid formulation of the idea of the University as a cultivated garden. That is the meaning of the fountain with three basins located in the upper part of each cloister, whose waters irrigate the plants and allude to the Trinity as well as to the eucharistic symbol of the 'fountain of life'. The flowers once again symbolize the members of the college, and the placing of the roses in the form of a crown corresponds to the verse from St Paul inscribed underneath: 'Vos gloria mea et corona mea', words which express the love and devotion of the saints for the University community.151 The affection of the saints for the College and particularly the protection they offer form the central theme of these pictures. To accentuate this message, the area which corresponds to the hagiographic attributes of the saints contains two vertical scrolls with the words of the Psalmist who asks to be protected from his enemies who 'speak proudly' and who prays God to grant him justice: 'Hide me', reads the text, 'under the shadow of thy wings, from the wicked that oppress me .... .'152 The sentiment echoes the feelings of the Anthonians during the second half of the seventeenth century. Having been thwarted by their rivals at St Bernard of the university status for which they had been the first to ask, they had to suffer, in addition, the absence of revenues promised to them by the Crown for the support of the professorships and the relief of their students' poverty. Moreover they had to endure the imposition of the obstacles and humiliations mentioned above whenever one of them wished to graduate at the University of St Ignatius.153 Yet the events which took place shortly before their University obtained official recognition were even more distressing. The conflicts between both academic communities, as already explained, reached a critical level under the jurisdiction of Bishop Don Manuel de Mollinedo. He was lenient towards the wishes of the Society ofJesus, but on the other hand desired to bring peace to 150 De la Raya created the College in 1598. The papal brief founding the University (I March 1692) mentions the fact that '. ... its students, after entering it, agree to take an oath to follow the doctrine of St Thomas Aquinas and depend on it for all purposes .. .'. This was the justification for its creation, as the differences with the theologians of the Society ofJesus did not allow them to graduate in St Ignatius without breaking their word. s51 Philippians, 4.

It was on his recommendation that, in 1692, the Ecclesiastic Chapter applied for and obtained the recognition of a second University in the city of Cuzco. The Jesuit rivals, seeing that they had lost their supremacy, started a skilful campaign to prevent the Royal Seal of foundation of St Anthony from proceeding further. The protest against these manoeuvres by the Rector of the Seminary, Dr Juan de Cairdenas y Cespedes, was so violent that Bishop Mollinedo was obliged to dismiss him from office and even had him imprisoned for a period. At the same time he exiled the Vice-Rector, Don Crist6bal de Traslavifias. The students then began a strike in protest and the boarders retired, removing their beds from the premises. Finally in October 1696 the provision from the Viceroy, the Conde de la Monclava, authorizing the foundation of the University, was issued in Cuzco and thus the case closed in favour of St Anthony.154 The style of the paintings is characteristic of the late seventeenth century, a dating which coincides with the dramatic events just outlined. It can therefore be assumed that these two pictures were commissioned during the time of greatest difficulty and bitterness for the College, between 1692 and 1696. Seeing their Rector imprisoned, and having lost the support of Bishop Mollinedo, the Anthonians expressed their bitterness by resorting to the eloquence of the Psalmist and prayed for protection and justice with a message conveyed by the power of images. According to tradition, Don Crist6bal de Traslaviiias, as Vice-Rector of the Seminary, was one of those who fought most relentlessly to obtain University recognition. The high esteem in which he was held by Perez Armendairiz and his eighteenth-century colleagues is demonstrated by the fact that Traslavifias is one of the two figures portrayed full length (along with Don Carlos Inca) among all the illustrious authorities in the Garden of Saint Anthony. It could be too that P6rez Armendairiz had recognized that Traslavifias was his predecessor in the use of pictorial allegory as a powerful medium for the expression of ideas. A painting fraught with symbols might, without causing scandal or offence, obtain more persuasive results than long judicial petitions. The two earlier pictures should thus be considered as part of the effective campaign that Vice-Rector Traslavifias conducted between 1692 and 1696 to obtain official recognition for the University of St Anthony. For apart from the general devotional role of both saints within the University, each is also identified by some allegorical attributes of particular significance among those which surround them. St Thomas is distinguished by his anti-Marian and anti-Jesuit position in the polemics concerning the Immaculate Conception; and St Anthony Abbot by his traditional role as protector. The canvas dedicated to St Thomas is a virtual compendium of the attributes which symbolize the power of his doctrine and the divine favour bestowed upon him. Two small angels crown him with laurels and bring him the collegiate sash and cap which, together with the large wings he carries, refer to his title as Angelic Doctor. The dove of the Holy Spirit dictates into his ear the wisdom of the Summa, a copy of which he holds in his right hand inscribed with the words which Gregory X uttered in its praise, 'Each article, a miracle'.155ss 154 On the imprisonment and expatriation of the authorities see Villanueva Urteaga, op. cit. n. io above, pp. 12-14.

I7b). A scroll at the side of the pen announces: 'He irrigated all of the Church' (with his wisdom). Over his chest the carbuncle that usually represents the light irradiated by the truth of his doctrine has been substituted by a monstrance, a more genuinely ecclesiastical symbol.'s7 The model of a chapel is depicted on the book that he holds in one hand as an indication of the support he gives to the structure of the Church. And finally, the hand of the Lutheran Bucer rises from the sea of heresy under the Saint's feet, seizing the point of the moon on which the latter is standing and trying unsuccessfully to make him fall. A scroll quoting two words from Bucer reveals the significance of this scene: 'Tolle Thomam.'ss58 But St Thomas remains unshaken, like the ox represented under- neath, with whose force, spirit of sacrifice and self-denial he was compared (P1. I6a).s59 On the opposite side of the ox, a unicorn, symbol of the purifying effect of his teaching, introduces its horn into the water to clean it of the poison of heresy (P1. I7b).160 The implication of these symbols of the power of St Thomas as supporter and defender of the Church is specific; in the main, they sustain the Thomist position with regard to one theological point: the conflict between the Dominicans and Jesuits over the Immaculate Conception.'61 That is why the crucified Christ, located in the upper left-hand corner, 156 Thomas Aquinas was virtually elevated to the rank of fifth Doctor of the Church by Pius V, a notion which was widely accepted in Spanish America. In the chapel of the University of Lima, for instance, the figure of the holy patron was surrounded by those of St Thomas with the four Doctors and St Bonaventure. See Antonio de la Calancha, 'Relaci6n Hist6rica de la Universidad de San Marcos hasta el afio 1647', in Eguiguren, op. cit. n. 12 above, I, p. 13. 157 The Wisdom of St Thomas which gave the Church support and encouragement in its most difficult moments inspired a special iconography in which he is associated with the fountain oflife from which churchmen of all orders drink. (Only a Jesuit appears to be doubtful.) See n. 17 above. The monstrance refers specifically to the hymn Adoro te devote of the Holy Week mass whose words were composed by the Saint. See Kirschbaum, op. cit. n. 33 above, vin, col. 477. 158 The complete phrase reads Tolle Thomam et dissipabo Ecclesiam (Remove Thomas and I will destroy the Church). See M ile, op. cit. n. 14 above, p. 472. 159 'Foolish ox' was his nickname as a child at the Benedictine school of Monte Cassino; but this mockery soon turned to praise in view of his exceptional qualities. For the ox as a symbol of Christ see George Ferguson, Signs and Symbols in Christian Art, New York 1961, pp. 23, 145- 160 The unicorn, apart from its messianic symbolism, was famous for its power as an antidote against poison. Its allegorical use in religious iconography was not infrequent in colonial Spanish America. In the specta- cular celebrations held in Lima in honour of the Immaculate Conception, King Abias appeared on horseback carrying a 'fountain of clear crystals' with the following verses inscribed on it: Dios, unicornio sagrado, Aquestas aguas reg6 y al punto las preserv6 del veneno del pecador. ('God, sacred unicorn, Sprinkled these waters and immediately preserved them thus from the sinner's poison.') See Diego Cano Gutierrez, Relacidn de las Fiestas Triumphales que la insigne Universidad de Lima hizo a la Inmaculada Concepcidn de Nuestra Seniora, Lima 1619; Eguiguren, op. cit. n. I2 above, ii, p. 646. 161 For a summary of this controversy see Reau, op. cit. n. 37 above, II, p. 77. The quarrel between Dominicans and Jesuits took place on several fronts, one being the universities. In Lima the Society ofJesus won complete victory. In 16i9 the University swore to defend the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception; and on 8 December 1654 all the authorities took the oath: Viceroy, the church's Chapter, the Audiencia, the municipal Council and all the people. But the Prior of St Dominic did not follow the general trend, and in I662 he began a sermon for the Festivity of the Immaculate Virgin in the Cathedral with the words 'Glory be to the most sacred Sacrament', and not, as King Philip III had stipulated, '.. . to the Sacred Sacrament and to the Virgin conceived without original sin'. This resistance, repeated on several occasions, caused such tumult among the populace, and nocturnal processions repe- ated day after day, that finally the Dominicans had to give in.

Romero, 'Distur- bios religiosos en Lima', Revista Histdrica, I9O6, 1.</page><page sequence="35">128 FRANCISCO STASTNY repeats the well-known words directed to the saint: 'Thomas, you have written well of me.' On the opposite side Mary is kneeling modestly. Towards her runs a text which appears to come out of the mouth of the Saint and refers to the preceding inscription. Freely translated it means: 'If I wrote well of the Son, I would not write ill of the Mother',162 words which are evidently a clear defence of the Thomist and Dominican opinions about the human origin of the Virgin. At the second and fourth levels there are further allusions to the Marian topic, recognizable by their unorthodox interpretation of some of the more usual symbols of conceptionist iconography. Thus, for instance, the monstrance that substitutes for the star on the chest of St Thomas has a scroll with the words: 'Covered by the Sun', a paraphrase of the verse about the Woman in the Book of Revelation, the well-known prototype of the Virgin Mary. In this manner the Dominican Saint seems to take possession, for his own purposes, of the famous solar attribute and give it a new theological meaning.'63 Even more complex are the implications of the way in which the moon is depicted at the feet of the Saint. It appears as a crude face leaning on the dragon and floating over the sea of heresy, carrying the words from Ecclesiastes: 'The foolish will change like the moon.' Far from representing the purity of virginity which it normally symbolizes in Marian imagery, the moon here takes on a pejorative connotation.164 The crescent, emblem of Mohammed, also has a long iconographic history as symbol and attribute of the enemies of Religion. In Spanish America, Moors wearing turbans with crescents on them are frequently shown defeated at the feet of St James, or next to the monstrance defended by the King of Spain - a thinly disguised equivalent for the Indians subjected to the crown. So the visual association of the moon with the paganism of Moors and Incas was an established topic by the end of the seventeenth century.165 The moon at the feet of the Saint is, therefore, a symbol of an ephemeral and changeable idolatry, which even with the help of Lutheranism could not withstand the power of the arrows emerging from the pen of St Thomas that pierce it with the sternness of his theological arguments. Placed in such a context and with a meaning so contrary to that which it usually has in Marian iconography, the crescent appears to be, thus, a veiled parody of the Immaculate Conception166 and an open attack on its Jesuit defenders.'67 162 The Latin version of the picture is 'non bene de filio si male scripsisem de matre'. 163 'A woman clothed with the Sun.' Apocalypse 12. I. 164 The waxing moon is, in effect, the symbol held by the personification of Inconstancy in Ripa, op. cit. n. 13 above, p. 226. For the rest, the offensive meaning of the quotation could hardly have been more explicit. 'A fool is changed as the moon .... The discourse of fools is hateful, and their laughter is at the pleasures of sin': Ecclesiastes 27. 12-14. 165 This explains why some of the caciques dressed in the elegant robes of the Inca nobility, portrayed in the series of paintings of the Procession of Corpus Christi (Archbishop's Museum, Cuzco) bear the emblem of the waxing moon on the mascaipaicha. In the drawings of Huamin Poma the waxing quarter also appears on the forehead of evil characters or the inhabitants of Collasuyo. R.

'A woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet.' Apocalypse I2. I. 167 Two other scenes appear on the second level of the hagiographic attributes. On the left two angels direct themselves to the Saint, in allusion to the belt they miraculously gave him in order to overcome the temptations of the flesh. The text reads: 'angelorum servit attentio'. On the right are St Peter and St Paul, with the inscription: 'Petrus et P. lus faciunt obsequi', referring to the apparition of both in the Saint's study to help him as he wrote the Summa. See Kirschbaum, op. cit. n. 33 above, viii, col. 481.</page><page sequence="36">UNIVERSITY OF CUZCO 129 If Thomas Aquinas appears to be the principal theological supporter of the Church whose thought sustained the Dominican position in the Marian disputes, St Anthony Abbot stands out, in the other picture (P1. I6b), as spiritual guide and protector par excellence. His general saintly merit is symbolized at the highest level of the composition. Like St Thomas, he is crowned with the laurel of immortality and, in place of doctoral insignia, angels bestow upon him the palms of spiritual triumph. To the left, under the face of an anthropomorphic sun which symbolizes Christ, the T with which he is identified is depicted above the heart of St Augustine, which recalls, as a neighbouring scroll reveals, that Anthony was the founder of the eremitical life adopted by the Augustine Order.'68 On the opposite side, in allusion to the fire that is one of his attributes, Anthony is exalted as 'The column of light that sustains the world'.169 The main emphasis however is placed on the function of the Saint as protector against misfortunes and, in consequence, as the friend who offers much-needed comfort to the afflicted Seminary of Cuzco. That is why he is shown holding three arrows in his right hand, like the saints invoked against the plague in medieval iconography. It is neverthe- less unexpected to see at his side the miraculous raven which fed him during his visit to St Paul the Hermit not carrying the bread it brought but rather holding three arrows between its claws. An inscription below assimilates it to the fiery eagle mentioned by the prophet Isaiah, who uses it to symbolize the people of God that the Almighty shall feed and console 'like a shepherd' and whose forces He shall multiply until they attain the fierceness of that bird of prey.170 In consequence the arrows which it carries are genuinely offensive weapons, with points at each end. In contrast the arrows in the hand of Anthony have their points facing upwards with their blunt ends towards the ground and thus lose all their aggressiveness.171 The benevolent gesture of his hand is underlined twice: first by the words of Psalm xvI, quoted earlier, and then by another scroll which states that those who are placed under his protection 'will not perish either by sickness or by fire'.172 The victory announced by the armed eagle is reiterated in the image of the tall palm trees which are placed symmetrically on the opposite side of the composition.73 At the foot of these trees, on the other hand, the aggressiveness of the former images is mitigated 168 St Augustine drew inspiration from St Anthony Abbot and St Paul the Hermit when he wrote the Rules for his order. The Augustinian churches often honour St Anthony, and dress him in the habit of their order (Mile, op. cit. n. 14 above, p. 457). 169 The image represents the world on a column, supported at the base by a hand. The idea is a somewhat exaggerated paraphrase of the words of Christ: 'I am the light of the world'. The association stems from the image of fire, which is one of the thaumaturgical attributes of the Saint, and which is represented by a light over the book which he sustains. The column, as an emblem of the Virtue of Strength, has also a symbolic meaning related to protection. See Reau, op. cit. n. 37 above, III, p. 104. 170 The well-known text from Isaiah lent itself well to the sentiments of the Anthonians: 'Be comforted, my people, saith your God. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd. He shall gather together the lambs with his arms and shall take them up in his bosom ... They that hope in the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall take wings as eagles ... they shall run and not be weary . . ' Isaiah 40. I, 1 I, 31. 171 Arrows generally symbolize sickness or adversity. The principal saints who have arrows as attribute are those who protect against the plague: Sebastian, Roch and Anthony. The arrows together stand for hunger, war and plague, among which David had to choose as punishment from God for having taken a census of the people of Israel. See Samuel 24: see also Reau, op. cit. n. 37 above, Imn, p. 395- 172 The Latin text of this last inscription is particularly obscure: 'ni debita [de vita] incendio q. perituras'. But it is intelligible as a new offer of protection which alludes to the 'fire of Saint Anthony', the medieval sickness against which the saint was invoked. Ibid., p. 104. 173 The palm tree (and palms) because of its exceptio- nal height is the symbol of greatness and victory. It is included among the Marian attributes in the Litanies, derived from the Song of Songs: 'Thy stature is like to a palm tree' (7.7).</page><page sequence="37">130 FRANCISCO STASTNY by the dove sheltered between the rocks from the Song of Solomon, which reveals the Saint as pacific and chaste.174 For St Anthony appears as the mighty protector armed by Divine favour, victorious and at the same time pure and mild, whose benevolence will not suffer any harm to be inflicted upon those placed under his protection. Quite the contrary, he leads them, as spiritual guide, along the path of righteousness symbolized by the mythical centaur from his visit to St Paul.175 It was customary in Viceregal universities that the rectors and certain distinguished professors would be honoured with the painting of their effigies, which were incorporated in the university's portrait gallery. These pictures were hung in chronological order in the General Lecture Hall and were next to some symbolic images such as those of the patron saint, the royal coat of arms, the university's emblem and allusive texts about its foundation. A new convention, derived from the academic portraits, was established in Cuzco in the middle of the eighteenth century. The recently graduated doctors and masters began to offer paintings to the Virgin or the saints of their devotion in acknowledgement of the successful completion of their studies. Although these pictures probably did not remain on the premises, they were planned in the University and provided the members of the cloisters with the habit of thinking in terms of pictorial allegories, some of which were as complex as the ones reviewed previously. The first example of the type (P1. I5a) is a large canvas in which the brothers Alejandro and Bernardo Garcia are depicted as donors at the feet of a Virgin of the Chair. An inscription explains that the former, who had achieved a Master's degree, was born in 1730, while unexpectedly Bernardo, who was a year younger, was already graduating as Doctor.176 Considering that the brothers were barely twenty years old, as the very young faces with which they have been portrayed suggest, the work can be dated around the year I750.177 By a balustrade behind them are their academic insignia: hoods, gowns, caps, with white tassels for the Doctor and blue ones for the Master, all forming a pyramid crowned with a floral arrangement. Both are dressed, furthermore, in the complete uniform of the 174 Song of Songs 2. 14 'My dove in the clefts of the rock . .' 175s En route towards the dwelling of St Paul, Anthony Abbot encountered a centaur, which showed him the way. In the painting the centaur holds a vine to allude more clearly to its character as representative of the pagan world and nature in the wild. With his free hand he points to the seven-headed dragon which lies defeated and in chains at the feet of St Anthony. A pig is also depicted at this level, as counterpart of the ox by St Thomas. It is a humble animal which accompanied the Saint in the desert. It was incorporated late into Anthonian iconography as, in France, the hospitallers' order of St Anthony obtained permission, in the 14th century, to let its pigs loose in the streets of the cities. See Mile, n. 8I above, p. 296. 176 Museum of Art in Lima. On the lower border is the following inscription: 'El Mt/Dn. Alexo Garcia naci6 a 18 deJulio de 173o.' 'el Dr./Dn.

'Doctor Bernardo Garcia was born on the i9th August 1731.') 177 At colonial universities five years of study were required to receive a degree. Applicants usually enrolled very young, at around 14, and graduated by the age of 20. See: Vargas Ugarte, op. cit. n. Io above, xIv; Eguiguren, op. cit. n. 12 above, II, pp. 200 ff.

The Virgin of the Chair, whom they adore, is similar to the one hanging in the Church of the Almudena of Cuzco and, as its attributes reveal, is an Immaculate Virgin.178 Another painting of this type hangs in the Brusberg Gallery of Hanover. A praying collegiate is depicted in that canvas at the feet of a hieratic Virgin of the Rosary. He wear the collegiate sash, though he does not reveal the insignia of his degree; and at his side is the patron Saint of the University himself.'79 Placed around the central figure, in the upper corners, are St Dominic and St Francis, and in the middle, St Joseph and the Archangel St Michael. Just what personal ties linked the donor with these other saints is uncertain. Finally, it may be worth mentioning in this context the wall painting that decorates the baptistry of the Church ofYanahuara, near Arequipa (P1. 17c). There, on both sides of a naive representation of the Baptism of Christ, datable around I760-80, two clergymen have been portrayed full length. They carry purposefully books in their hands and wear caps with the blue tassel of recently obtained Master's degrees. 80 The habit of offering paintings on the occasion of the graduations of university students was not practised exclusively in Cuzco. At Santa Fe of Bogotai pictures were painted for the same reason and dedicated to St Teresa of Jesus by young doctors who graduated from the University of that city. In the Museum of Colonial Art of Colombia there are two paintings, one from 1752 and another from 1759, containing that subject.'8' The paintings so far examined mark a century of intellectual and artistic life in Cuzcol82 and the ideological world to which it was related. In fact the dominant system of thought developed around the ideas which have been here discussed was basically different from that of contemporary Europe. In the American Viceroyalties archaic concepts held sway, concepts which coincided for the most part with the medieval philosophical and theologi- cal world and were adapted (re-archaized)183 to the circumstances of the colonial regime. Moreover, it cannot be assumed that those were static principles, imposed mechanically by the established structure of domination; rather they were living realities which evolved according to the social, economic and political relationship between the Colonies and Spain. Thus we have seen that the concept of the Cuzco University changed from that of a mere instrument of political and ecclesiastical power to incorporate the nationalistic ideals of the Incas and finally to assume, around 1795, new scientific and liberal 17s The Virgin of the Chair is an immaculist image which stems from Cuzco. She is crowned by angels, leaning on a waxing moon. There is a canvas with the same subject by Marco Zapata in the Church of the Almudena in Cuzco. J. de Mesa, T.

As an interest in the subject grows, new examples will probably emerge. 183 P. Macera, op. cit. n. I above, p. I I6.</page><page sequence="39">132 FRANCISCO STASTNY aspirations. It cannot be denied, therefore, that the art of colonial Cuzco obeyed the stimulus of its own reality with inventiveness and originality. Colonial art was a sui-generis expression which arose from the particular social conditions of the colonial American world. Therefore, Viceregal Hispanic art should also be understood, appreciated and judged, not according to the canons used to judge European art of the same period, but rather with criteria that take into account the peculiarities of the colonial circumstances of this New World.184 UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL MAYOR DE SAN MARCOS, LIMA 184 We therefore consider that it is more useful to compare it with the art of periods which have more in common with its social, ideological and economic make-up, such as the late Middle Ages (international Gothic style) or the beginnings of the Counter- Reformation.</page><page sequence="40">12 UNIVERSITY OF CUZCO a-Cuzco School, 1770-75, The Garden of St Anthony.
