<plain_text><page sequence="1">Les vierges meres et les naissamces miraculeuses. By P. SAINT- YVES. Paris: Emile Nourry, I908. i6mo., pp. 280. Saintyves' book is a volume in the Bibliotheique de critique re- ligieuse. It is called an essay in comparative mythology. It aims to bring the birth of Christ into relation and place with the vast number of miraculous births recorded in sacred books or recounted in the folklores and mythologies of many peoples. The field is not unworked. E. Sidney Hautant in his Legend of Persons presents many miraculous births; so does De Charencey in his Le fils de la vierge (published in second edition under the title Lucina sine con- cubitu). Saintyves has added to the work of his predecessors chiefly a method of treatment. He classifies and groups his great number of cases under the means by which conception has been produced. Thus his chapters are: "Fecundating Stones and</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 707 Stone-Worship ;" "Aquatic Theogamies and Water-Worship ;" "Fecundating Practices of Plant-Worship;" "Phytomorphic Theo- gamies ;" "Of Miraculous Births Due to Simultaneous Action of Divine Plants and Sacred Waters ;" "Theromorphic Theoga- mies ;" "Meteorological Fecundations ;" Solar Theogamies, or Births Due to the Action of the Sun;" "Anthropomorphic Theo- gamies." These chapter-titles indicate the material and the method of presentation, as well as the related topics suggested thereby. In two closing chapters Saintyves discusses the subject of Christ's birth, which he considers at once solar and anthropomor- phic, ranging it thus under the last two of his recognized classes.
