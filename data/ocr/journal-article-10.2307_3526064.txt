<plain_text><page sequence="1">music, beyond-more correctly, before-know- ledge, before the Cartesian subject-object dual- ism. Pace Bakhtin, it is integrally related to Rosen's anthropomorphic stance: it is precisely because Rosen makes a metaphorical (but necessary) anthropomorphic leap that he is able to love music-the one presupposes the other. To see the human in music is to love it. Active love, then, is another way of talking about human responsibility, and this, I believe, is precisely how Rosen con- ceives of the proper way to engage with music, both historically and aesthetically-with style. It remains to be said only that, like the virtues it extols, this is a 'passionate' (p. 318) book. It is about loving music. In fact, these are the two most important things that can be said about it. Little can be said about the practice of music, and Critical Entertainments is a practical book through and through, right down to its title. Nevertheless, although these essays have already appeared in print elsewhere (with the exception of Chapter 11), they certainly deserve to be read again. Critical Entertainments is that rare combination, of both the critical and the entertaining-as one would expect from a performer. ANTHONY GRITTEN Absolute Music and the Construction of Meaning. By Daniel K. L. Chua. pp. xii + 314. 'New Per- spectives in Music History and Criticism'. (Cambridge University Press, 1999, ?40. ISBN 0-521-63181-5.) Daniel Chua's second book, Absolute Music and the Construction of Meaning, may at its most funda- mental level be intended simply to spell out, in ways hitherto lacking or unexplored, the relation- ship between 'absolute music' and 'meaning' (or 'construction of meaning', if that is different). Owing to the wide spread of arguments in the book, there are many clues throughout to Chua's general project, many possible starting-points for an explanation of what he is about. The structure of the book itself reflects how Chua thinks the phenomenon of absolute music may be observed, as a black hole with stars clustered about it. The stars, the 35 chapters, are fragments of the identity of absolute music, and it seems no accident that the source Chua makes most use of is Friedrich Schlegel, whose fragmentary aphorisms he liber- ally quotes. The chapters are grouped in three parts. Parts I and II are called 'The Garden of Eden' and 'The Fruit of Knowledge' respectively, to evoke the idea of the ahistorical absolute first at its artificial origin and then at its awakening in the nineteenth century. Part III is called 'The Tower of Babel' because it describes modernity's self- induced drive to propel itself forward, separating from its origins. This tripartite structure may suggest a historical framework, but the book is not a historical essay, and the structure seems more of a historical accommodation of Chua's rich, complex thought than a chronological pre- scription. Ultimately, the onus on the reader is to discern what is offered by the fragmentation of thought which is presented. One way of setting out the book's agenda occurs at the end of Chapter 3, 'On Disenchantment': 'Absolute music is therefore only absolute in that it recalls the past when music was once absolute reality. Today absolute music simply curls up in its own orbit as a microcosm of some unknown universe, discovering an aesthetic freedom in an autonomy that is out of tune with the cosmos' (p. 22). Chua here and in many other parts of the book seems to dissociate himself from traditional claims that instrumental music is, absolutely, music par excellence. Instead, and as a musicologist primarily drawing on work from other disciplines (whose discourses musicology has only lately been catching up with), he wishes to explain that absolute music is as ontologically rooted in extra- musical realities as it is in the progression of aesthetic positions from mimesis to autonomy, and very likely even more so. There is indeed an overall sense that the book is felt (by Chua himself and by the publisher) to be a pioneering attempt in this direction-that it is one of the most radical current musicological efforts to quantify what has in recent decades been the concern of literary theory, poetics and the rest of a substantial list of other fields all vying to answer the demands of a postmoder world. The book features in the CUP series 'New Perspectives in Music History and Criticism'. This series-now, with Chua's, includ- ing five titles in areas from French Enlightenment theory to rap music-aims 'to create a greater presence of music in the ongoing discourse among the human sciences'. Chua's book certainly and creditably addresses this aim. It not only follows on from but also extends the work of Lawrence Kramer and a host of other writers. Generally, the likely intended readership is a mixture of historical musicologists, historians of aesthetics and cultural theorists (which could in- clude documenters of visual culture), the current standards of whose work may be challenged and even upset by Chua's work. To get a further sense of Chua's project, refer- ences to which are framed and reframed through- out the book, it is perhaps well to look at what 287</page><page sequence="2">the reader encounters first, an 'anxious' preface and a five-page first chapter (or fragment) which concludes by denying absolute music the pedi- gree which is conventionally attached to it: 'To write a history of absolute music is to write against it' (p. 7). 'A preface often speaks of anxiety', Chua begins ('On the Preface', p. xi), citing Caccini's Le nuove musiche (Florence, 1601/ 2). This 'fear' is Chua's symbolic sharing of the concerns that he and Baroque musicians have in common: will the reader 'get' (= understand) Chua's book as the performer ought to 'get' a piece of music (i.e., offering an informed but free interpretation that is the hallmark of 'performance practice')? The term 'get' also occurs in the body of the book, where Chua criticizes some concep- tions of sonata form (pp. 210, 213). All in all, his fragmented book draws fragments of criticism. Does that procedure 'get' the book? Perhaps not. But then, Chua's literary mode seems to demand a similar mode of response. It must therefore be said that the anxiety Chua brings up is in the end directive and that those who do not 'get' his book still deserve credit. He invites a 'creative interaction' (p. xi) with the history of absolute music that is different and new. His intentions are clarified when he says that 'abso- lute music cannot be defined'-it does not admit of easy conceptualization. The most guidance Chua feels he can offer, as a remedy for his felt anxiety, takes the form of the three words 'Constellation', 'Archaeology' and 'Dialectic' ('On the Preface'). 'Constellation' (loc. cit.) evokes the fragmentary nature of the project: no one chapter or fragment, whether dealing with history or gender or modernity, can outstrip all the others in terms of historical importance (and historical order is not the dominant method employed anyway). 'Archaeology' (p. xii) conveys the importance of knowing what epistemological foundations are necessary before absolute music can even exist as a concept or a reality. And with 'Dialectic' (loc. cit.) Chua wants to remind the reader that the book does not attempt a synthesis of concepts of absolute music, as part of a dialec- tical process. Ironically, these verbal guidelines are not meant to be taken as gospel by the reader. Perhaps the most interesting of them is the second, 'Archaeology'. In this Chua is at pains to say that his method of 'excavation' of the story of absolute music is not at all dependent solely on the history of music 'circling in its own autonomous sphere' (loc. cit.). Absolute music's essence is contained in structures external to music or musicology. Inspired by Foucault, Chua advocates desubjecti- fying history in order to reach the heart of absolute music. This explains the possible theme of the book: 'Absolute music is not an emancipation of music but a reconstruction of it' (p. 168). Absolute music's meaning without meaning comes from without, notwithstanding the fact that in parts of the book Chua actually and not reluctantly does a good job of keeping music to itself. 'The emergence of absolute music was muttered rather than announced by the early Romantics' (p. 3). From this note of uncertainty it can be seen that Chua's will be no ordered account and will take stock of many musical traditions and genres in establishing the meaning of absolute music. For Chua, more conventional historical-aesthetic mu- sicology, which locates absolute music, or the new aesthetics of instrumental music, most specifically and prominently in Romanticism, with forebears in eighteenth-century British aesthetic and cogni- tive theory for example, does not come close to what he wants to do. In fact, he does not even bother to inveigh against this standard approach. Equally, towards the end of the book, Chua notes: 'Art just elaborates' (p. 265). Nor at that point does he take the trouble to go on any long crusades defending a point of view: he preserves the stance of the almost impassive historian. The book is woven from start to finish, one fragment intercon- nected with the next at their juncture, fragments being peppered with footnoted references to other fragments (an admirable integrative feature). Per- haps in many respects fathered by Carl Dahlhaus's The Idea of Absolute Music (Eng. trans., Chicago, 1989), Chua's book is more far-reaching, though taking a cue from Dahlhaus's eclecticism. It is obvious on reflecting on these characteristics that Chua could have said much more. The chrono- logical scope of the book (not tightly reflected in the arrangement of the discussion) tantalizingly stops with serialism. There is no mandate to apply or reinterpret concepts of absolute music in the contemporary world. All this is not inconsist- ent, however, for one suspects that Chua holds to absolute music as a kind of Protestant idea that died what might be called a 'pre-death' in the Enlightenment (see pp. 23, 28, 33, 221-3). If this suspicion is correct, Chua would find adequate support in Henry Sussman's The Aesthetic Contract: Statutes of Art and Intellectual Work in Modernity (Stanford, 1997) (especially Chap. 2). This, then, would perhaps amount to a more standardized explanation, except that Chua notes that absolute music 'survives . . . as a perpetual post-mortem' (p. 222) and 'keeps dying in the hope that it might be born over and over again to enact the self- renewing process of modernity' (p. 223). The book is an erudite and distinctive attempt to 288</page><page sequence="3">question existing historical methods of investiga- tion of 'autonomous' music, drawing on a panor- ama of sources. It quickly becomes clear, however, that these omit, for example, Nelson Goodman and Richard Wollheim, whose work (especially Goodman's) could have illuminated discussions of the musical score (Chaps. 7, 8, 14), although Chua cites Lydia Goehr's more historically-centred The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works (Oxford, 1992), which does make use of Goodman and Wollheim. Nor does Chua mention the work of writers such as Peter Kivy and Roger Scruton. Kivy hardly discusses 'absolute music', which Scruton does, for example in the 1980 New Grove. Kivy and Scruton, Chua might argue, little serve his purpose. His non-reliance on the present-day philosophical-aesthetic fraternity accentuates his leaning towards aesthetics as history rather than a composite approach which engages with both real time (represented by pure philosophy) and histor- ical time (represented by narrative). His evocation of'historical truth' (pp. 251, 268) demonstrates this leaning and, with other concepts he adduces, slots his work into a current kind of orthodoxy. One might argue that with the present state of scholarship it is difficult for Chua to proceed in any other way. Philosophical aesthetics has not traditionally taken a special role in discussing the concept of absolute music as such. Rather it has, more often than not, appropriated the term with- out historical exposition, infused it with analytical approaches stemming from specifically modern discourses, and embarked on comparative aes- thetics which draw particularly on the visual arts (especially abstraction). In other words, absolute music is a given for philosophy while at the same time being a philosophical problem. This no doubt parallels what Chua feels about absolute music and history (absolute music as a given for history while at the same time a historical problem). Whatever it is about the long-term aspirations of absolute music that Chua seeks to uncover, his book is rich in varied music examples and vocabu- lary which builds up the narrative. It is worth examining some of this vocabulary for its own sake, but first it must be noted that Chua post- pones discussion of the genesis of the term 'abso- lute music' until Part III. 'When Wagner coined the term in 1846 he was announcing the death of instrumental music. The symphony, he claimed, was over. It was already history, buried by Wagner himself, whose music dramas were about to over- come the inchoate utterances of instrumental music though the word and deed' (p. 224). This leads logically into Chua's following of a tradi- tional thread from Kant through Hanslick to modernity, but a modernity which premisses art as being mimetic of society instead of formalistic- ally self-contained (an outlook propounded by Adoro and Peter Burger among others) (p. 229). Setting the scene for Part III in this way makes the reader comfortable, and Part III does in fact live up to its initial promise. It will, for example, be essential reading for undergraduate courses in music and twentieth-century ideologies, especially studies of totalitarianism. It is, however, the consistent refusal to define absolute music musically, which permeates Parts I and II, that gives rise to many curious, telling phrases. This refusal also puts existing terminology into new guises. Without giving any originating contexts (Wagner) or real prehistory against which to set up his narrative, Chua slips almost too easily into the use of 'instrumental music' and 'autono- mous music'. The question which poses itself is: is absolute music simply instrumental music? Chua does frequently touch on the concept of (rational) 'instrumentality' (p. 42), perhaps roughly redu- cible to 'toolness' or functionality, which subverts the cosmos. And he defines the musical status of the cosmos in the Renaissance as follows: 'The entire cosmos was the notation of absolute music' (p. 16). But Chua further argues that, in later developments, such as issues raised by the mod- ernity of early opera, absolute music may be constrained to walk what he calls 'the epistemic line between cosmic magic and instrumental dom- ination' (p. 42). So the music that is 'instrumental', that is actual and existent, 'the practical manifesta- tion of music' (p. 78), undermines or 'disenchants' (see Chap. 3, 'On Disenchantment') the pure abstraction of music which is the cosmos. This is central to Chua's thought, and he sees it as having particular application to Romanticism (where he is not concerned, as is conventionally done, to situate the genesis of absolute music). One might, for example, invoke it to account for the lack of refer- ence to real composers or works in Wackenroder's Herzensergiessungen eines kunstliebenden Klosterbruders (Berlin, 1797) and (with Tieck) Phantasien uber die Kunst (Hamburg, 1799). Real-life examples in that literature would have killed the absoluteness of music to which Wackenroder repeatedly returns. The result: a disaster. Music reified is music disenchanted. The transformation of melody or the voice in its original state into an instrumental function, providing the basis for harmony, is a retrograde step for absolute music. Also of interest to the enigma of Wackenroder's non-reference to real music and musicians is Chua's discussion of instrumental music's endless deferral of the naming of its own meaning, in accordance with 289</page><page sequence="4">the prohibition of the First Commandment not to make graven images: 'And to protect its space, the subject hid itself in the pure autonomy of sound; in instrumental music, man is reified but never named' (p. 189). In this particular discussion (in Chap. 23, 'On Self-Deification') Chua acknow- ledges the concept of 'pure autonomy of sound' but clearly does not believe in its role in explaining absolute music, a role which, at least to some extent, it undoubtedly has. Autonomy constitutes a vexed question for Chua, judging by his apparent enmity towards it (p. 22, cited above) and the (consequent) lack of any sustained or coherent discussion of it in his book. This is where philosophical aesthetics might have helped, getting the obvious questions out of the way. For example, can absolute music repre- sent? (See pp. 162-3.) In not stopping to address such questions Chua involves his story in a number of assumptions which are precisely about the historical discourses he discusses so passion- ately. Autonomy, though not philosophically expounded, is gendered and organic: 'instrumen- tal music became the quintessence of art, for it was elected to resolve the crisis of the male soul' (p. 146). Chua here should at least remind his readers of alternative critiques. On page 178 the reader encounters the obscurely picturesque refer- ent 'spikes of autonomy'. Such language gives a sense that 'autonomy' is being used merely in a freely idiosyncratic way instead of as something which is at least respectable (or even indispens- able) in terms of Chua's or any argument concern- ing absolute music. And on page 186 the treatment of the shift in notational procedures and their significance, between the Baroque and Romantic periods, so that 'the score is no longer the site of performance, but locates music outside time and action in an idealized realm where performance is no longer a prerequisite of a work's existence', still leaves autonomy out of the picture, not attempting to relate it to absolute music. Autonomy is side- lined or conventionalized. The subject is not wanted any more (see the discussion of Adoro's thought in Chap. 33, 'On Suicide', esp. p. 273). Philosophy has nothing to say about it. Chua by his silence, or perhaps by the aching space left by Auschwitz (pp. 267, 271-2), uncritically legitimizes all of this. 'Absolute music is doomed-whatever it says. It is consigned to talk itself to death, which is to say that it lives in the meaning of its own catastrophic statements' (p. 276). The concept of absolute music given here does not invite identi- fication with autonomous music. Chua, however, does not say so, or say why. Similarly, the empty chattering of Beethoven's late string quartets (and Kevin Barry's term 'empty sign', referring to pure music, is constantly evident in Chua's book) lives in its own meaning. (See Chap. 34, 'On Absolute Drivel'.) But before this chattering can be absorbed into dialect it must be written by the composer. The authorial voice, through the nature of the material, cannot avow a dialectic intention, so Chua abstracts one for it from the structure of the music. There may be much novelty and value in this approach in an age of refinement of research methodology and Chua has already done some- thing similar by gendering the slow movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata in A minor, K.310 (Chap. 16, 'On Masculinity'; pp. 142-3). But the consequence-the whole implication of these examples being that Chua does not cherish auton- omy-is that questions of intentionality (as the intention to convey or embody something beyond musical notes, rhythms, timbres etc.) go by the board. Therefore pure philosophy, which could have benefited the discussion even by just being acknowledged, suffers. Chua may be right (histor- ically) to gender instrumental music, but does he also care what a philosophical aesthetician would want to say about it? An exegesis of music itself must take account of the purely musical. It is the problem of what 'purely musical' means that Chua could also have addressed. 'During the course of the eighteenth century, the position of instrumental music did not change; on the contrary, in a rebellion against Cartesian rationality, it was the soul that changed its identity, making an allegiance with the passions' (p. 87). This may adequately describe Romantic logic. Where, however, is mention of the sterling reas- oners (not in the Wackenroderian sense) that helped to bring this logic about? Michel Paul- Guy de Chabanon's theories are seen primarily as completing Rameau's (pp. 100-101) and Adam Smith, whose Of the Nature of that Imitation which takes place in what are called The Imitative Arts (1777- 82?; pub. London, 1795) offers a logical and potent basis for Romanticism and interestingly criticizes Rousseau's view of instrumental music, is nowhere in sight (beyond the mention of the idea of 'sym- pathy' on page 117). Chua's book shows that there are different ways of relating the story of absolute music. It does not spell them out, it just spells out its own approach. As noted above, making history for Chua involves constellation, archaeology and dialectic (see above). He has decided, while making use of studies such as Bellamy Hosler's Changing Aesthetic Views of Instrumental Music in 18th-Century Germany (Ann Arbor, 1981), to adapt their chronological orientation, failing to point out to future researchers the possibilities that some- 290</page><page sequence="5">thing new could be said within either mode (his or someone like Hosler's). Chua's eclectic style could flower in disciplined application within a tighter historical framework. To be fair to his rich fabric, however, a sense of chronological perspective is maintained. He has been diligent in Parts I and II of his book as well as in Part III, offering a panorama ranging from the quadrivium-+trivium through Monteverdi's Orfeo to the Classical style of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. On the latter, Chua complains vigorously and comprehensively against structural definitions which hamper the egoistic signification of the absolute, singling out Tiirk in particular (p. 213). This part of the book occasions what might be the most memorable term in Chua's endless stream of new phraseology, the 'aesthetic subject' (p. 210). This could perhaps be tied in with his notion of 'instrumental aesthetic' on page 112. Perhaps the most justice any reviewer of Chua's complex and variegated text can do in this space is to highlight his approach to some general issues, as has been attempted here. His version of the Romantic project in particular is scattered, or 'fragmented', the preferred unitive term! Chua says early on that 'the Romantics merely gave a twist to an existing discourse to turn instrumental music into absolute music' (p. 9). His explanation of pre-Reformation (pre-absolute music) theory is therefore good because it needs to be: 'Within this [cosmic] system, the differentiation of instrumental and vocal music was not structured hierarchically as a binary opposition as it is in modernity; rather sound and text found their being in the rationality of the celestial spheres' (p. 24). This Romantic pre- Romanticism flickers in Chua's book, and clearer reasons need to be given for its eventual demise. Chua's book is both brave and discomfiting, as he might have intended it to be, and it will doubt- less be made welcome in current musicology (and other discourses). In the final analysis, there are his and other ways of writing about absolute music. This is not to imply that he is in a minority of one: scholars like John Neubauer, for example, may also be of Chua's persuasion. Practically everybody writing today in the field of absolute music refers to Dahlhaus, but Chua's book should not be seen merely as stemming from Dahlhaus's work: it extends it as well as enriching it. But it must also be true that exponents of other ways of writing about absolute music (and that is another story) should, while being aware of Chua's project, not be daunted if they do not 'get' it. For his efforts speak not least of the difficulty of understanding history, history which, though highly significant, offers one among a number of ways in which the concept of absolute music can be approached. KEVIN O'REGAN Medieval Music as Medieval Exegesis. By William T. Flynn. pp. xxii + 271. 'Studies in Liturgical Musicology', viii. (The Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Maryland, 1999, $55. ISBN 0-8108- 3656-4.) The rather sweeping title of this book must be clarified at the outset. For 'Medieval Music' we must understand simply 'eleventh-century chant'; and for 'Medieval Exegesis' we must infer 'the processes by which medieval writers explained or commented upon the meaning of liturgical texts'. The third word ('as') is, despite its useful brevity, rather more ambiguous: it is not clear whether the connection between exegesis and musical composi- tion is being viewed as an active or a passive one. There are some moments within the discussion when the impression is given that a composer has used melodic structure as a means of exegesis; but there are others when it seems to be suggested that within an overall exegetical context certain effects can be noted with regard to melodic structure. Although these two scenarios may, at first sight, appear to be similar, they are really very different. In the case of the former, it would be difficult if not impossible to contemplate undertaking a mean- ingful analysis of the music without having estab- lished and understood beforehand the associated textual exegesis which has (supposedly) given birth to the particular melodic structure. With the latter, however, one could conceivably use musical ana- lysis as a tool for arriving at a perception and understanding of textual exegesis. This ambiguity may well have been intentional. If so the title might be understood more clearly as 'Eleventh- Century Chant and its Interaction with Medieval Exegesis'. Such a reworking would, in any case, give a more immediately accurate overview of the contents of the book. The book is not an easy read despite its elegant literary presentation, and musicians will find that it raises more questions than it provides answers. In his preface (p. xix) the author claims that the book is 'particularly wide-ranging, since it aims to engage not only musicologists and liturgists, but also biblical exegetes, ecclesiastical historians, and students of medieval Latin literature'. This list of recipients would seem to divide into two groups: (a) those who are reasonably well provided for, and (b) those who are not. Under (a) can certainly be placed liturgists and biblical exegetes (also possibly 291</page></plain_text>
