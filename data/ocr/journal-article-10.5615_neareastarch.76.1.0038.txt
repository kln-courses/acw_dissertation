The tombs have a rectangular plan typical of shaft  graves. The depth of the shafts is up to 1.5 m. The bound- ary of each shaft is defined by a perimeter of boulders.  Each shaft grave was covered with large wooden beams  running the length of the shaft and other smaller beams  running the width. The dead were put into the tombs  with bent legs, lying on a side, and looking to the west.  Many ritual, personal, and manorial objects as well as  vessels were found in the tombs. The beams were filled  with compacted earth. The heads and legs of sacrificed  bulls were placed on top of platforms constructed of  mudbrick or stone slabs (Koşay 1951; Özyar 2000, 101;  Bachhuber 2011, 160). The tombs will be described in  more detail in a forthcoming publication. Here we want  to give a short report about the anthropomorphic metal  figurines and of what the tombs contained. Tomb H measures 8.00 x 3.40 m. A woman was buried  inside. Among the various funeral offerings is a golden  diadem, two copper mace heads, a bronze sun standard,  Figure 6. Plan of tomb H drawn by M. Akok in 1937 (Kos ̨ay  the statuette of an animal, small ornaments made of gold 1951, pl.

Figure 7. Photo of tomb H taken in 1937 (Kos ̨ay 1951, pl. CXX). Tomb A1 is located next to tomb A, which contained a  female skeleton. A1 measures 4.00 x 2.80 m and yielded  the skeleton of a male adult. Tombs A and A1 were over- lapping. It was rather difficult to distinguish the funeral  offerings of these tombs during excavations (Koşay 1938,  115). Besides numerous jewels and small ornaments for  garnishing clothes, there were three sun standards, five  vessels, a broken sword, a golden diadem, two iron pen- dants or beads, and a silver anthropomorphic figurine  (11702; fig. 4). Tomb L is at the lowermost point of the slope that  tends toward the southwest. Measuring 5.00 x 2.30 m,  it contained the remains of an adult female. The buried  person was bejewelled with a golden diadem. In addition,  there were four sun standards, an animal statuette, sev- eral metal ornaments, pieces of an iron object, and two  metal anthropomorphic figurines (8801, 8802).
