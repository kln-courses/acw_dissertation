Aydogan Kars Received: 5 May 2012 / Accepted: 17 October 2012 / Published online: 3 November 2012 © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012 Abstract This comparative study juxtaposes two celebrated medieval examples of negative speech, apophasis, and theorizes the languages of unsaying in the great medieval thinkers, Maimonides (d.1204) and Ibn 'Arab! (d. 1240). The paper coins a distinction between 'asymmetrical' versus 'symmetrical' approaches to language as a heuristic to analyze the two philosophical apophatic accounts comparatively. While apophatic thinkers in Neoplatonic traditions generally oscillate between these two poles in their various apophatic moments, the paper argues that Maimonides and Ibn 'Arab! represented the climax of these two non-linear poles in a visible tension and con versant with each other. I frame philosophical apophasis in the medieval Islamic lands in terms of the problem of God's transcendence versus imminence. Maimonides cele brates apophasis and claims that negative speech, asymptotically approaching silence, is the only genuine praise to God. As an uncompromising exponent of absolute tran scendence, and a severe critic of those who ascribe attributes to God, he privileges apophasis to kataphasis; he presents negative speech as a medium of purification and spiritual progress. Ibn 'Arab!, on the other hand, is critical of this widespread asym metry, and defends the gathering together of transcendence and imminence for human perfection. His intricate theory of transcendence and imminence appeals to a dialec tical logic, explaining why kataphasis and apophasis are symmetrical in front of the Absolute. The productive tension between two apophatic minds challenges Hegelian habits of reading the history of thought, as well as various scholarly prejudices about medieval intellectual landscapes. A.

I will refer to the term 'apophasis' as a higher order construction; its application (not only to, say, the Far Eastern traditions, but also to the Greek-influenced heritage) begs justification and contextualization. The widespread and apparently daunting scholarly disagreements on its definition, how ever, do not mean that apophasis cannot be defined; rather, this plurality implies that it can be defined, problematized, and theorized in many different ways. Extrapolating from J. Z. Smith's reflections on the term 'religion,' I will contend that apophasis is 'not a native term; it is a term created by scholars for their intellectual purposes....It is a second-order, generic concept,' without which no disciplined study of mystical languages would be possible.1 To avoid speaking through context-free general terms as well as unjustified appli cations of this Greek-originated scholarly term, the first part of the paper will frame philosophical apophasis in medieval Islamic lands in terms of the question of whether certain attributes and predicates can be ascribed to God, i.e., the heated tension of God's transcendence versus imminence. The paper coins the binary terms 'asymmetrical' and 'symmetrical' approaches to language as a heuristic to analyze and contextualize the two philosophical apophatic accounts comparatively. I will argue that these binary terms embody two possible philosophical poles, among many others, of unsaying avail able to medieval apophatic thinkers to approach this specific problem. While thinkers in Neoplatonic traditions resorted to both poles in their various apophatic moments, Maimonides and Ibn 'Arab! embodied the most concrete and distinguishable manifes tations of these two positions. I will argue that Maimonides and Ibn 'Arab! represent the climax of the asymmetrical and symmetrical poles of apophasis clearly in tension, yet in conversation with one another. Defending the irreducibility of these modes of unsaying, I will challenge the Hegelian readings of the history of thinking, which char acterize apophasis in over-generalized terms as monolithic and critically progressive. A brief sketch of the intellectual landscapes in the thirteenth century Islamic lands The question of the applicability of positive attributes to God was one of the most central questions bothering medieval thinkers living in the Islamic lands. The binary Arabic technical terms through which they discussed the problem were tanzTh and tashbïh. TanzTh referred to God's dissimilarity and transcendence; His being beyond and greater than any possible conception of man. Tashbïh, having the distinct conno tation of 'similarity,' indicated God's imminence being ubiquitous and nearer to us 1 Smith (2004, pp. 193-194).

God's tran scendence, on the other hand, aimed to strip away from Him every predication and positive attribute in favor of His supreme ipseity that human mind and language cannot circumscribe. As early as the eighth century, certain branches of Islamic theology [kaläm] had developed a complex and radical transcendence conception of God that became the official even if not the dominant doctrine of the Abbasids (r.750-1258) until mid-ninth century. These 'rationalist' theologians, Mu'tazilite mutakallimün, firmly rejected the application of anthropomorphic words and acts to God. To believe in the reality of divine attributes [sifät] would jeopardize the essential oneness [wahdah] of God, and culminate in polytheism.3 On the other hand, mainstream Jewish theology, represented by the rabbinic tradition in the Islamic lands, had already established a convergent transcendence concept of God for many centuries. The Torah was full with anthro pomorphic verses, insofar as it spoke 'in the language of man.'4 Rabbinic tradition interpreted these verses as allegories, in favor of God's transcendence. Within the polemical discussions among mutakallimün and their Christian and Jewish adversar ies, anthropomorphic verses in the sacred scriptures served as an indicator of their being changed [taghyîr, tabdïl] and corrupted [tahrif] in the hands of their peoples.5 Tashblh was widely used as a synonym of anthropomorphism by theologians and philosophers, including Moses Maimonides himself.6 It was evidently much more difficult to defend God's imminence within these theological landscapes. Even if philosophical and theological strands were generally, at least at the polit ical level, in competition, philosophers including the peripatetic [mashshat] school favored God's absolute transcendence as well. Ibn Sïnâ (Avicenna) (d. 1037) presented God as the Necessary Being, from which everything else emanated. This distinction between the inherently Necessary Being [ wäjib al-wujüd bi-dhätihi] and contingent beings [wäjib al-wujüd bi-ghayrihi, or simply, mumkinät], was qualitative and deci sive. God's being, which was nothing but His essence, became an inaccessible category totally alien to our forms of existence. NasTr al-DTn Tûsï (d. 1274), a thirteenth century Shï'I interpreter of Ibn Sïnâ's al-Ishärät wa al-Tanblhät suggests that 'the philosopher completely shut to himself the door on [reaching] the knowledge of God.'7 With the notable exception of Ibn Rushd (Averroes) (d.l 198) 'the interpreter' of Aristotle (d.322 BCE), medieval Islamic peripatetic philosophy was deeply influenced by Neoplato nism.

Accordingly, the material world is non-existent darkness illuminated by the light of all lights, which is never fully visible even if making the visible world manifest.8 Suhr awardl did not claim to have founded a new school of thought, but saw himself simply as reclaiming the ancient pre-Islamic Persian heritage of wisdom [hikmah], which was deeply rooted in the Hermetic tradition. The subtle phenomenology of light of ishräqT school, thus, merged Neoplatonism with Hermetism and a kind of ancient wis dom, which was accordingly Persian in its origin.9 'God is the light of heavens and the earth:'10 the great pre-modern master Mulla Sadra (d.1640) would later synthe size the ishrâqT, philosophical, Sufi, Shî'T, Hermetic and theological currents in his deeply Neoplatonic works, and crown the Safavid period (r. 1502-1736) intellectuality in Persia." Finally, Ismâ'TlT traditions of thought preserved what is likely the most distinguished and radical emphasis on God's transcendence. Ismâ'TlT thinkers such as HamTd al-DTn al-Kirmânï (d.ca. 1021), radically rejecting attributes [nafy al-sifât] of God, embod ied a vivid channel of Neoplatonism, and championed the absolute transcendence of God.12 Ismâ'TlT philosophers, beginning in the tenth century with al-NasafT (d.943) (who claimed that God is neither existent nor non-existent), Abü Hätim al-Râzï (d.934) and Abü Ya'qüb al-Sijistânï (d.972), amalgamated Ismâ'TlT theology with Neoplato nism in a highly original manner that would have enduring influence beyond the Fätimid Egypt (r.969-1171). In the first half of the thirteenth century, living in a mys terious Nizârï Ismâ'TlT fortress in Quhistän relatively isolated from the outer world, TusT, one of the most celebrated ShT'T philosophers, defended the Ismâ'TlT conception of 'pure unity' and 'unconditioned absoluteness' of God, and wrote as follows in his Persian autobiography: [God] is more glorious and exalted than to be the fount of two opposites, the origin of two contraries, the source of unity and plurality, the cause of the ab solvement [tanzîh] and non-absolvement [lä-tanzih] (of attributes). He is beyond any attribute by which something could be qualified, whether it be non-existent or existent, negative or positive, relative or absolute, verbal or in meaning [lafzT yä ma'nawT], He is beyond, and also beyond the beyond and so forth.11 Islamic lands in the twelfth and thirteenth century already encompassed a myr iad of languages, religions and cultures extending from modern Spain and Italy to India, Central Asia, Anatolia and Africa. Among a vivid diversity of philosophical, theological and mystical intellectual currents in this period, absolute transcendence 8 For a short introduction, see Nasr (1964, pp. 52-82). 9 See van Bladel (2009, pp. 23-63, 223-226). 10 al-Qur'ân, 24:35. 11 See Mullä Sadra (2004). 12 Ivry (1986. p. 144). al-Tûsï (1999, p. 37) (p. 11 in Persian manuscript).

It was this colorful environment wherein two great masters 'the rabbi, of blessed memory' and the shaykh al-akbar emerged as the zeniths of two modes of apophasis. Maimonides and the asymmetrical approach to language Maimonides' monumental Guide to the Perplexed [Dalâlat al-Hâ'irïn] was a compre hensive and critical response to its rich intellectual environment. It cited not only the Jewish theological sources, but also Aristotle, Plato (d.348 BCE), Ibn Sïnâ, al-Fârâbï (d.950), Mu'tazilites, Ash'arites, Ptolemy (d. 168), Ibn Aflah al-Ishblll (Jäbir) (d.l 150), Ibn Bajjah (Avempace) (d.l 139), Ibn Wahshïyyah (d.935), al-RäzT (Rhazes) (d.925), Galen (d.216), Pythagoreans, esoterics [bätiniyyah] etc., intellectuals who dwelt in the colorful intellectual atmosphere of Maimonides. Unsurprisingly, the famous negative theology in the Guide is in many ways rooted in this intellectual environment. Not only the Abrahamic transcendent God, but also peripatetic philosophy, Neoplatonism (through faläsifah, especially al-Färäbl and Ibn Sïnâ, and Ismâ'ïlîs like al-Kirmänl14) and kaläm theology (particularly 'rationalist' Mu'tazilite mutakallimun, and Ash'arite theology) have direct influence on Maimonides' conception of the deity. His reference to the Aristotelian principle already stated by al-Kindl (d.873) that 'one should accept the truth from whatever source it proceeds,'15 and his critical appropriation of the manifold accessible sources is instructive. A myriad of schools of thought intersect and crystallize in Maimonides' critical philosophy. Chapters 52 to 68 in the first part of the Guide embody the paragon of what we call 'negative theology.' In these sections Maimonides firmly rejects any ascription of any attributes to God. Reminiscent of the famous master of the Mu'tazilite kaläm school, Wäsil ibn 'Atâ' (d.748) of Basra, Maimonides claims that ascribing positive attributes to God is polytheism [shirk].16 Accordingly, nothing we state positively about God is correct; instead, the correct way of speech is through negation [salb]. This privileging of negative language can be traced back at least to the founding figure of Neoplato nism, Plotinus (d.270), who claimed that 'we can and do state what it [the One] is not,'17 instead of what it is. The Neoplatonist Ismâ'TlT thinker al-Kirmânl's 'affirming by the method of negation [sa/fr]'18 seems also conversant with this privileging of 14 'Maimonides would have found the last major Ismâ'îlï theologian, al-Kirmânï, particularly attractive, for he added the spherical cosmic structures of the Aristotelian philosophers to the triadic scheme of Neo platonic hypostases. Al-Kirmänl also held both to the idea of a voluntaristic creation from nothing, and a universe that, though created, will last forever. Moreover, al-Kirmânï expresses his opposition to predicating attributes of God in the same language that Maimonides later adopts. ... Last, though Maimonides would have been uncomfortable to admit it, his understanding of Moses as a unique individual with superhuman intelligence, a prophetic lawgiver combining both intellectual and political skills, has many similarities with Ismâ'îlï teachings of their occulted leaders' (Ivry 2005, pp. 63-64). 15 Gorfinkle, in Maimonides (1912, pp. 35-36). 16 Maimonides (2008. 1.58. pp. 136-137). 17 Plotinus, in Franke (2007, p. 61). 18 Kraemer(2005, p. 25). ö Springer</page><page sequence="6">266 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:261-278 negation. Ismä'Tlism must be a vivid channel through which Neoplatonic negativist language was canalized to Maimonides. Ibn STnâ gave Maimonides the required demonstration of God's necessary existence (in an inaccessible mode). This also means His absolute oneness, and His necessary dissimilarity from everything other-than-Him. TashbTh, in every form, must be thus firmly rejected in favor of one, absolute God, who does not resemble His creatures in any way, has nothing in common with them, and does not entertain plurality.19 All the attributes we use to point to Him are just deficient similes [amthäl]\ they can be ascribed only metaphorically, insofar as words are used either polysemously [musht arakah] or figuratively [musta'ärah] when they are applied to God.20 The entire first and some additional chapters of the Guide are devoted to analyzing the poetical expres sions in the Torah, and preparing the backbone of his theory of language. Maimonides does not tolerate literal [zâhirî] readings of anthropomorphic passages, and insists that one should understand them metaphorically. None of the passages that ascribe certain attributes to God can be read literally, because language works analogically,21 and God necessarily does not resemble anything.22 Similarity [tashbïh] means anthropo morphism [tajsïm]; God's having a body, and deficient traits comparable to ours are scandalous ideas for Maimonides. Nothing should compromise God's necessary one ness and absolutely dissimilar transcendence. No predicate applies to God insofar as all predicates are anthropomorphic. God is not great, merciful or angry in the sense that we understand. Even the essential attributes of 'unity' or 'being' (understood by human beings) cannot apply to Him literally: 'He is one [wähid] without possessing (the attribute) oneness [wähidah].'^ This idea of being one without oneness immedi ately recalls not only the Sufi master al-Halläj (d.922)'s enigmatic Kitâb al-Tawâsïn translated to Persian by another great Sufi, Ruzbihän BaqlT (d. 1209),24 but also the Corpus Parmenidem, which embodied thinking through the first two hypotheses of Plato's Parmenides: 'if the One is One,' and 'if the One is.' However, it is not only Neoplatonist traditions that Maimonides inherits from the Greek legacy. Probably more evidently, Maimonides is a tough-minded Aristotelian. He does not hesitate to criticize faläsifah with misreading (and sometimes even dogma tizing) Aristotle.25 In this rigorous Aristotelianism, Maimonides became particularly close to another great contemporary philosopher born in Andalusia, Ibn Rushd. Aris totelianism, however, was difficult to reconcile with the Neoplatonism circulating in the medieval period (even if certain Neoplatonic texts were mistakenly attributed to 19 See Maimonides (2008, 1.58, p. 139). 20 Maimonides (2008, Intro, to Part 1, pp. 5-6). 21 Maimonides (2008, 1.26, pp. 58-59). 22 E.g. Maimonides (2008, 1.1, p. 14). 23 Maimonides (2008, 1.57, p. 135). The same expression appears in later Kabbalah as well. See Wolfson (2008. p. 403). 24 See al-Halläj (1913, p. 68). Halläj 'defines' Sufism as 'the divine erasings and effacements. ... It is inexpressible' (al-Halläj, in Ernst 1985, p. 29). 25 Maimonides (2008, 2.15, p. 177). 4y Springer</page><page sequence="7">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:261-278 267 Aristotle).26 Inheriting both legacies, the Guide visibly embodies the uneasy tension between the apophatic God of Neoplatonism and the Aristotelian God as the pure intellect. [Maimonides] continues to accept the Aristotelian notion identifying God as Self-Intellecting Intellect (1.68). Nor does he wish to surrender the conception of a Living, Powerful, Willing, and Knowing deity (1.53). Despite Maimonides' negation of attributes of relation, he regards God as the final and formal cause of the world, in addition to the efficient cause, who continuously endows the world with its existence (1.69).27 On the one hand, God has to be stripped of all positive attributes; while on the other, Maimonides does not shy away from identifying God with certain qualified attributes based on the peripatetic philosophical tradition. God is the First Cause [al-sabab al awwal], following the philosophical strand of al-Färäb! and Ibn STnä (which mingled the ideas of Plato, Aristotle and Neoplatonism). In a similar way, God is the Necessary Being [wäjib al-wujüd\, which was demonstrated by Ibn STnä,28 and found evident repercussions in the Guide.29 Maimonides follows the same philosophical line claim ing that God is the pure 'Active Intellect.' In the case of God, intellect ['aql], that which comprehends ['äqil] and that which is comprehended [ma'qui] are one and the same;30 there is no potentiality in God as al-Fârâbï, and later Maimonides both claim.31 Besides, in the Guide Maimonides applies certain qualified attributes to point to God, such as the attributes 'All-Knowing,' 'Living' and 'Omnipotent.'32 In this case, Maimonides' position is strikingly similar to that of the Mu'tazilites, who also claimed that all attributes should be negated, but did not refrain from using the same three qualified attributes 'All-Knowing,' 'Living' and 'Omnipotent' in referring to God.33 The Guide thus conspicuously carries the tension between the apophatic, 'absolute transcendence concept of deity' versus the kataphatic, more Aristotelian, 'qualified transcendence concept of deity.'34 More generally, it embodies the crux of medie val thought wherein various intellectual traditions come to a crossroad. To claim that Maimonides saw all of the implications of this crux, and solved all of the emerging problems cultivating a full harmony in the Guide is to fall into the fallacy of assuming a closed, completely coherent and finished intellectual position, which violates the open endedness of philosophical thinking itself. Nevertheless, it is clear that Maimonides 26 The Theology of Aristotle, probably compiled by Ya'qüb ibn Ishâq al-Kindî, circulated among Islamic and Jewish medieval philosophers as an Arabic translation of a book written by Aristotle. In fact, this text was an excerpt of books 4-6 of Plotinus' Enneads.

The precious philosophical tool he applies to eliminate this tension is the interpretive the ory of analogical application, which can be traced back at least to Philo (d.ca.40) and can be found in others like Eriugena (d.ca.877) as well. Philo wrote that names were 'the symbols of created things,' and anthropomorphic expressions in sacred scriptures must be interpreted allegorically.35 Maimonides appeals to a similar strategy. Accord ingly, those qualified attributes such as the First Cause, Necessary Being, pure Active Intellect, All-Knowing, etc. apply to God, but only allegorically. God is the Necessary Being, but the term 'Being' is only an allegory, insofar as God's existence is incompre hensible even if it is proven by demonstration [burhän]?6 Qualified attributes emanate from God, and only allegorically can they indicate God's transcendence. Any positive ascription is at best an allegory, and at worst, anthropomorphism or polytheism, which should be firmly rejected in favor of the absolutely transcendent God. Apophasis has thus an evident advantage compared to kataphasis according to Maimonides. Apophasis neither essentializes nor transgresses the inaccessibility of divine ipseity [dhät\. it indicates the transcendent by showing what it is not. The more one negates, the closer one becomes to its knowledge. The motor of this dynamic is the negativist conception of God who opens Himself through His acts of wisdom, but also goes always further and hides His essence, which remains transcendent. The more one acquires knowledge of the world through the lens of this negativist philosophy, the better one grasps that God is not similar to this or that. Negative ascriptions therefore cultivate a docta ignorantia wherein spiritual and intellectual progress resides. 'By each additional negative attribute you advance toward the knowledge of God, you get nearer to it than he who does not negate. ... With every additional positive assertion you follow your imagination [khayâl] and recede from the true knowledge of God.'37 We approach God through negative ascriptions; through recognizing that God is not great, merciful or angry in the sense that we can comprehend and even imagine. Due to the transformative power it possesses, apophasis in the Guide is a speech-act that has a bearing on ontology. Negative ascriptions provide 'the medium of purifica tion,'"'8 while positive ascriptions in reference to God are nothing but implicit profan ity and blasphemy.39 Apophasis transforms the performer, and provides the required openness to further steps of maturation. Therefore, it is never redundant to silence;40 on the contrary, it is 'a verbal gesture, a speech-act'41 at the asymptotical end of which stands silence as an unattainable state. The more we negate positive ascriptions, the more we approach God, who is depicted by Maimonides as the absolute unground of being. His approach to language is asymmetrical, in the sense that he privileges apophasis to kataphasis. As shown in the broad sketch, this asymmetrical approach to 35 Philo, in Franke (2007, p. 119). 36 Cf. IbnSTnä(1957, p. 44). 37 Maimonides (2008, 1.59, pp. 140-141). 38 Yovel (1986. p. 274) and Wolfson (2008, p. 416). 39 Maimonides (2008. 1.59, p. 144). 40 Wolfson (2008, p. 414). 41 Wolfson (2008, p. 407). â Springer</page><page sequence="9">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:261-278 269 language, the preference of the doctrine of transcendence [tanzTh] in different forms, and objection to the divine immanence [lashbTh] was actually a very popular view in the Islamic and Jewish intellectual landscapes. It is this imbalance of transcendence and immanence, and the related, widespread asymmetrical language that grounds the critique of the greatest master [al-shaykh al-akbar]. Ibn 'Arab! and the symmetrical approach to language Ibn 'Arab! opens the third chapter, 'the Wisdom of Exaltation in the Word of Noah' of his exquisite 'Bezels of Wisdom' [Fusüs al-Hikam] with an enigmatic sentence: the doctrine of transcendence [tanzTh] is on par with that of limitation [tahdîd] and restraint [taqyïd] of God.42 Ibn 'Arab! is succinct; his claim is that God cannot be limited even with non-delimitedness (which is still anthropomorphic). Therefore, apophasis is in no better position than kataphasis; all ascriptions are symmetrical in front of the Absolute. To give examples, the negativist propositions such as 'God has no fingers,' or 'God does not sit on a throne,' 'God does not get angry' or 'God is not similar to anything' still imply the accessibility of God's essence, and violates rational transcendentalism. Maybe God has fingers, or maybe He sits on a throne; who knows? The fact that our language is anthropomorphic does not necessarily prove that the absolutely transcen dent is not in the way we imagine or think. Thus, true tanzîh must take a further critical step, and negate itself. From Ibn 'ArabT's perspective, the prevalent negative theologi cal currents are not radical enough; they still make essentialist claims implicitly about the Absolute, and presume to access its ipseity. The apophatic step he takes aims to free the Absolute from being limited to our own conception of non-delimitedness. Two important aspects of Ibn 'ArabT's objection are worth underlining briefly. First, the objection is not based on a mystical or anti-intellectualist negativist schema. As a famous Sufi, he wrote a large corpus, the bulk of which can be best classified as mysti cal (for certain scholarly purposes). The objection raised here, however, is based on a rational argument, and refers to an elusive intellectual problem. It is fully rational, and accuses the mutakallimün and faläsifah of avoiding the logical limits of reasoning.43 In this sense, his critique does not attack reason and does not rely on mystical intu ition. On the contrary, his reasoning is working in the same paradigm of intellectual negativity with his contemporaries. Secondly, the objection does not rely on a simple negation of everything predicated to God which yields an infinite regress. Instead, it reaches a resting point (or more accurately, an unresting, continuous dialectic) in the symmetry of positive and negative attributes ascribed to God. Accordingly, no defense of apophasis vis-à-vis kataphasis can be made without essential claims on the 42 Ibn al-'Arabï (1946, Ch. 3, p. 68). See also Ibn al-'Arabï (2007j, p. 395). 43 Challenging the scholarly stereotypes about Sufism, Ibn 'Arabî's works are philosophically rigorous and precious. His Sufism and philosophy are 'neighbors,' which 'visit each other' (see Rosenthal 1988). Rosenthal's observation of the close-knit relation between philosophy and mysticism in Ibn 'Arab! finds its counterpart in Maimonides' intellectual spirituality, which has been relatively neglected. (For mystical motives in the Guide, see Blumental 2006.) The scholarly, stereotypical, mutually exclusive categories such as 'philosophers' and 'mystics' evidently do not do justice to the great many-faceted minds. Springer</page><page sequence="10">270 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:261-278 Absolute. This rigorous objection is radically intellectualist and negativist insofar as it pushes negativist reasoning to its logical limits.44 Ibn 'ArabT, while carrying transcendence further through negation, supplies it with an existential immanence. Accordingly, the world wherein we dwell is nothing but God's finite, temporal and spatial manifestations [tajallî]. Creation and God are thus in a seemingly paradoxical relationship. On the one hand, God is so transcendent that nothing can be said about His ipseity. The term 'God' is nothing but a word of negation.45 Our affirmations of His transcendence are still binding for Him. On the other hand, all things are the tongues of God;46 creation is the unveiling of God, and neither can be alienated from the other. Thus, tanzîh and tashbTh both must be pur sued to their limits, which produce the dynamic of the famous 'paradox of the veil.'47 Tanzîh (pushed to its logical limits) dictates that God is always inaccessibly veiled from us however we affirm His transcendence. TashbTh dictates that it is God's 'face' that appears through all phenomena. Once the two modes are unified, existence and God present themselves within apparent paradoxes. '[E]very entity qualified by exis tence is it/not it. The whole cosmos is He/not He [huwaAä-huwa]. The Real manifest through form is He/not He. He is the limited who is not limited, the seen who is not seen.'48 From the subjective point of view, the paradox manifests itself in the very nature of one's self [nafs]: 'you are not He [mä anta huwa] and you are He [anta huwaY simultaneously.49 The face of truth is nothing but its veils. The veil of truth is nothing but its face. [N]one but God is loved in the existent things. It is He who is manifest within every beloved to the eye of every lover-and there is nothing which is not a lover. So the cosmos is all lover and beloved, and all of it goes back to Him... Though no one loves any but his own Creator, he is veiled from Him by the love of Zaynab, Su'äd, Hind, Laylä, this world, money, position, and everything loved in the world. Poets exhaust their words writing about all these existent things without knowing, but the gnostics never hear a verse, a riddle, a panegyric, or a love poem that is not about Him, hidden beyond the veils of forms.50 Negation is a purely rational process for Ibn 'Arab!,51 while affirmation is more challenging to defend, because of its very inalienable immediacy.52 Tanzîh is the 44 '[T]he element of transcendence in Islamic mysticism,' is pursued 'to its extreme,' instead of being destroyed by Ibn 'ArabT (Sells 2004, p. 113). 45 Ibn al-'Arabï (2007c, p. 48). 4® Ibn al-'Arabï (1946, p. 69). 47 'All veils are He.

Tashbïh, on the other hand, is the faculty of our imagi nation [takhayyul], and also has to be pursued to its limits. Ibn 'Arab!does not accept the widespread philosophical superiority of reason to imagination that was defended by Aristotle and accepted by al-Färäbl, Ibn Slnâ, Ibn Rushd, Maimonides, al-Tûsî, and many others. Instead, they are two distinct faculties, which have to operate in har mony, and complement each other. Wisdom and divine knowledge rely on the dialectic of reason and imagination, which are irreducible to each other.53 As complementary faculties, they should operate independently and fully to achieve highest knowledge. 'If you insist only oji His transcendence, you restrict Him, And if you insist only on His imminence, you limit Him.'54 The two faculties are 'blind' alone, and best operate together. Ibn 'Arab! uses the met aphor of binocular vision to explain their unity: transcendence and imminence are like two lenses through which we relate ourselves to God. Two eyes actually do not con tradict, but testify and accord with each other. 'Ontologically speaking, one eye sees Being and the other perceives nothingness. Through the two eyes working together, man perceives that he himself and the cosmos are He/not He.'55 One has to become a 'possessor two eyes,' [dhu'l-'aynayn], which means to unify these two faculties, and hence, transcendence and imminence. TanzTh must be unified [jam'] with tashbïh.56 Scholars widely use the solemn term 'coincidencia oppositorum [coincidence of the opposites] to refer to Ibn 'ArabT's paradox. Even if inspiring, the term might be misleading if we do not clarify what it means, for the visible and the invisible, or imminence and transcendence are actually not opposites for Ibn 'Arab!. Defining the unity of God's manifestation with the world as the coincidence of the opposites means to assume that the two are opposites. However, the world is the manifestation of God not in the sense that God remains always veiled as the essential unground of being. God is neither the essential truth veiled behind the material un-truth, nor the being of beings according to Ibn 'Arab!. Phenomena are not untruth, but the truth of the deeper truth, the visible o/the invisible, the surface of a deeper reality. The visible is not only the veil of the invisible, but also the way in which the invisible shows itself (as an absence). The face of God is not hidden behind infinite veils. On the contrary, relying on a dizzying perspective shift, the face is the veil, and the veil is the face.57 The vessel and the wine it contains, the content and the form wherein the content appears 53 As Stelzer points out, this issue would be the major divergence between Ibn 'Arabi and Ibn Rushd, who firmly believed in the supreme authority of reason. Old Ibn Rushd's meeting with the young Ibn 'Arab! in Cordova has a symbolic significance as it dramatizes the meeting (and separation) of two distinct positions of epistemology and worldviews. In his Meccan Openings [al-Futûhât al-Makkiyyah], Ibn 'Arab! narrates this enigmatic meeting as follows: 'He [Ibn Rushd] said, "How did you find the situation in unveiling and divine effusion [fi-l kashfi wa-l faydi-l Hühl]? Is it what rational consideration [al-nazär] gives to us?" I replied, "Yes and no. Between the yes and the no spirits fly from their matter and heads from their bodies'" (Ibn 'Arabï, in Chittick 1989, p. xiii).

Discussion: apophasis, apophases, and critical theory Maimonides and Ibn 'Arab! present us two distinct but conversant approaches to the problem of tanzîh and tashbTh, and to the role of negative language that were com peting in the medieval Islamic landscapes. In the eyes of Maimonides, the heated debate of mutakallimün, philosophers and many others on God's attributes was in fact not a real problem. His position on the question was crystal clear as he stood at the radical pole of rationalists, well-informed on various schools no less than the rab binic tradition, Mu'tazilite mutakallimün, faläsifah, and Ismâ'ïlï thinkers. He was an uncompromising exponent of the absolute transcendence [tanzîh] or negation [salb]', and a severe critic of those who ascribed attributes to God, implied God's corporeality [tajsTm] and similarity [tashbTh] to the creation. In the sense that he privileges negative speech over positive speech, his approach to language is 'asymmetrical.' In this asym metry, he stands in the same line with Neoplatonic thinkers such as Plotinus (Aflütln), Porphyry (Farfüziyüs) (d.304), Proclus (Birükliyüs) (d.485), Dionysius (DiyünTsiyüs) (d.500), al-Kirmânl, Albert the Great (d. 1280), al-TusT; and arguably gives the boldest philosophical defense of an asymmetrical approach. Porphyry had already argued that 'those who, in knowledge of him, give priority to what he is not are better than those who [give priority to] what he is, even if they speak the truth.'59 Commented on by Albert the Great, Dionysius in his Celestial Hierarchy similarly would write 'that in theology negations are true, while affirmations are ill-adapted.'60 It is arguably with Maimonides that this Neoplatonic asymmetrical preference becomes most evident. Ibn 'Arab!, on the other hand, is closer to Plato, Damascius (d.ca.538), gnostics, ishräql philosophers and particularly to the Hermetic tradition. His critique of tran scendence is philosophical, and claims that reason and language arrive at a resting point only in the balance of apophasis and kataphasis. His gathering of positive and negative ascriptions culminates in nothing less than apparent paradoxes, reminiscent of Plato's Parmenides. Especially the Corpus Hermeticum, with which Ibn 'Arab! was evidently conversant, contains apparent paradoxes that are paralleled in Ibn 'ArabT's own oeuvre. He is himself the things that are and those that are not. Those that are he has made visible; those that are not he holds within him. This is the God who is greater than any name; this is the God invisible and entirely visible. ... He is bodiless and many-bodied; or, rather, he is all-bodied. ... He is nameless or rather he is all-named since he is one and all.61 Chodkiewicz ( 1993, p. 10). Chodkiewicz notes that he borrows the phase 'bintäni min abm wahid' from Denis Gril's Ishärät al-Qur'än. 59 Porphyry, in Franke (2007, p. 70). 60 Albert the Great, in Franke (2007, p. 245). 61 Corpus Hermeticum. in Franke (2007. pp. 125-126). ■£) Springer</page><page sequence="13">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:261-278 273 Similarly, the ishrâqïconception of God as the light making everything visible while His very ipseity remains invisible has clear repercussions in Ibn 'Arabï's works62 as well as the Corpus Hermeticum: 'while remaining invisible because it always is, it makes all other thing visible. The very entity that makes visibility does not make itself visible. ... [I]n presenting images of all things he is seen through all of them and in all of them.'6-' It is no surprise that for SuhrawardT Hermes was the 'ancestor of the Sages' [abü al-hukama]M and his intellectual forebear 'who was thus considered throughout the Middle Ages, in the East as well as in certain schools in the West, as the founder of philosophy and the sciences.'65 Hermetism was in close-knit relationship not only with Sufism, but also with philosophical currents such as ishräqiyyah. Ibn 'ArabT's works make it clear that he was genuinely informed by various philosophical and mystical schools which adopted a symmetrical approach to language. Asymmetrical and symmetrical approaches, embodied respectively by Maimonides and Ibn 'Arabï, were two irreducible forms of thinking on the Absolute in medieval Islamic lands. Maimonides adopts an asymmetrical approach to language, and pro ceeds through perpetual negation, which will never end, but bring maturation to the performer as a speech-act. The more one negates positive ascriptions to God, the more one understands what God is not and how He transcends all transcendence. Ibn 'Arab!, on the other hand, works within the symmetrical approach to language, and proceeds with real paradoxes if analyzed by a non-dialectical propositional logic. From the lens of absolute imminence, there is nothing but the manifestation of God. From the lens of transcendence, on the other hand, the Absolute remains infinitely hidden in those very appearances (not as the invisible veiled behind the visible, but as the invisible of the visible). Apophasis and kataphasis are symmetrical and intertwined in this approach; they constitute a 'p and -p' structure together, a genuine violation of the principle of non-contradiction if we read it through non-dialectical propositional logic. One has to make recourse to a double-semantics to analyze the dialectic of transcendence and immanence, which cannot be separated. In the language of Ibn 'Arabï, ' [t]he smallest semantic unit is not the sentence or proposition, but the double sentence or dual propo sition.'66 'Yes and no,' 'He and not He': one has to perpetually affirm and negate; these two modes are like two eyes which do not see different things but unify in true vision. 'Negation is affirmation.'67 The semantic unit is a sentence according to Maimonides, who sticks to Aristotelian logic; but it is the dialectic of an affirmation and negation according to Ibn 'Arab!. This subtle difference, especially the case of Maimonides is theoretically instructive as it displays the limitations of framing apophasis as the transcendence of Aristotelian logic, or as the 'inspired paradox.' The tension between the two apophases in Maimonides and Ibn 'Arab! points to dis tinct philosophical approaches to language with evident bearing not only on semantics 62 The strength of God's light overpowers comprehensions, thus the manifestation of His light is called 'veil' (Ibn al-'Arabï2007g, p. 123). ^ Corpus Hermeticum, in Franke (2007, p. 125). 64 Nasr(1973, p. 61).

Their diver gences on the station of divine union are most telling and instructive. Divine union in Maimonides is based on the reverse progress attained through perpetual negation. This negative progress is not only faithful to human reason, but also possible only through it. Reason is not only a 'likeness to God,' but also 'an overflow' from Him.68 The ethical claim of imitatio Dei and the philosophical ideal to approaching the Active Intellect converge in the divine union [ittisäl], which is an asymptotical approximation attained through a negative progress. For Ibn 'Arab!, on the other hand, experiencing divine union [ittihäd] is not possible.69 It happens only when the reason breaks; unity with God's being [wujüd] is found [wujida] in ecstasy [wajd].10 Thus, union refers to a 'station of no station;' it is not an experience, in the sense that experience demands its recognition.71 Divine union for Ibn 'Arab! is the highest form of bewilderment or perplexity [hayrah], which occurs in the restless dialectic of paradoxes.72 'Vision happens in perplexity and incapacity, so vision is not-vision ... Incapacity to attain comprehension is itself comprehension.'7-1 Instead, Maimonides defines perplexity in the Guide to the Perplexed as an initially useful, even required condition, which has to be gradually guided to, and replaced with, the light of clarity and certainty. What unites both great minds is the permanence of transformation. Ibn 'Arab! describes divine union as a station of perpetual transformation [taqallüb] of the heart [qalb] at which logic, time, space, reason and language break down in paradox and perplexity; the highest station is that of permanent movement [talwïn], i.e., the 'station of no station.'74 According to Maimonides, on the other hand, divine union is at the asymp totic end of infinite negations and approaching God by imitating His actions. This is a twofold, endless process. On the one hand, it entails achieving Active Intellect by using the most essential divine gift, i.e., reason; on the other, it demands to approach God through His creation, i.e., His actions, which are manifestations of His wisdom [hikmah]15 Neither reasoning nor knowing God through His creation has an end: both lead to an infinite, transformative process. The given subtle divergences between these two irreducible modes are particu larly important and unnegligible. Once the differences in these currents are trivialized and merged into one 'perennial negative theological philosophy,' apophatic think ers dangerously emerge as if they are in a progressive evolution. From the Hegelian lens that reads apophasis as infinite negation, apophatic thinkers inescapably appear as the negation of their predecessors.

Similarly, certain postmodern conceptions of apophasis as 'limitless criticism,' or its depictions as belonging to periods of crisis, 'when confidence in established discourses crumbles' is hardly applicable to the medieval intellectual framework sketched above. Neither is Damascius the critical maturation of Proclus, nor was Ibn 'ArabT's critique a tran sition from Maimonides to a higher, more critical level of thinking. Apophases of the two minds are two distinct modes with different ontological claims, and ways of shaping the discourse on a specific intellectual problem, to point to its beyond. Ibn 'Arabï's critique of asymmetry is not an additional negation deepening the already infinite asymmetry, but a step towards the (un)resting (dialectical) balance of apo phasis and kataphasis, i.e., to a different mode. His position does not simply add a negation to Maimonides' philosophy, but adopts a different apophatic approach that succumbs into blatant paradoxes intolerable within the logico-philosophical standards of Maimonides. Conclusions This paper offered a comparative analysis of the languages of unsaying in Maimonides and Ibn 'Arab!. Such a study assumed the ready-to-be-comparedness of idiosyncratic figures that appears as an immodest risk considering that the literature is overwhelmed by literary approaches and poetical analyses that undervalue structural inquiries. The paper considered 'apophasis' as a scholarly, higher order term with a tentatively limited field of application, which can be vindicated only through contextualization. Instead of giving a sweeping, universal definition of the term, the application of the term 'apophasis' was limited through framing it in terms of the debate over God's attri butes that circulated in the medieval Islamic lands and was conversant with Greek, Hellenistic and Abrahamic traditions. Apophasis, within this theological and philo sophical context, appears as a speech act through which the beyond of language and ontology were pointed out simultaneously. Apophasis applied by Maimonides, Ibn 'ArabT, and their intellectual environment, is a performative meaning event that has an evident bearing on ontology and theology. This contextualization of apophasis is fundamentally necessary. Even the two figures analyzed here vividly show that con text-free broad terms such as 'the negative theology' and 'the apophatic tradition' have limited explanatory power. There is no one consistent category, or cumulative tradition, of negative theology: it is an umbrella concept encompassing a rich variety of different theological, mystical, philosophical and artistic conceptions of the deity that can be in direct opposition to one another as in the case of Maimonides and Ibn 'ArabT. Even the widespread depiction of Maimonides as 'the negative theologian' is substantially reductive considering his subtle hermeneutical digestion of the tension between apophasis and kataphasis. Similarly, the application of the term 'apophasis' in the historiography of thought demands careful contextualization and theoretical jus tification. The application of this Greek term to Far Eastern and Indian traditions and their historical figures without sufficient theoretical justification or contextualization yields nothing but the universalizing of a domestic concept. Every text and work of art "Ö Springer</page><page sequence="16">276 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:261-278 might turn into instances of apophasis, and the scholar might find herself celebrating the 'break-down of borders' between cultures and forms through apophasis, while she is in fact either appropriating 'the other' by reducing it to her own a Greek-originated category or by creating exotic, orientalist representations of 'sister traditions.' As a response to the urgency of theorizing and contextualizing apophasis, the paper coined the binary of asymmetrical and symmetrical language, which has no claim for having mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive applicability even within the thirteenth century Islamic world. Instead, they are scholarly tools and conceptual met aphors, which show the analyzed phenomenon in a certain way, and simultaneously veil it in many other ways.76 Simply recalling Rüml (d. 1273), another towering fig ure of the thirteenth century from Anatolia, might demonstrate that 'apophasis' in this paper was circumscribed by the specific philosophical debate over tanzïh versus tashbïh. RümT's 'praise to the emptiness that blanks out existence'77 and his poetical call to listen to the cry of silence, or the ecstatic expressions and inspired paradoxes celebrated by Ruzbihän BaqlT are enough to remind us that the binary introduced in this paper is not collectively exhaustive. Similarly, far from being mutually exclu sive, asymmetrical and symmetrical languages represent two possible harbors between which apophatic thinkers traveled in their various apophatic moments. Exemplary of this oscillation, Proclus applies an asymmetrical approach in his Commentarium in Parmenidem, writing that 'even the negations are not true of the One, but negations are truer than assertions.'78 Then he immediately shifts to a symmetrical voice: '[it] is therefore right in ending with the removal even of the negatives, saying that it is impossible that they should express anything about the One, which is inexpressible and unknowable.... Both the assertions and the denials are false of the One at the same time.'79 The same oscillation is clearly identified in Damascius as well. Adopting a symmetrical language, he claims that pure negation is 'like someone blind from birth asserting that heat does not consist in color. ... [E]ven negation is still a certain dis course.'80 At the end of his treatise, however, he shifts the mode of discourse adopting an asymmetrical language: '[i]t is necessary to keep silence, remaining within the ineffable sanctuary of the soul, without going forth. And if it is necessary to indicate something, most useful are the negations of these predicates ... and such negations, I know not how, overturning themselves absolutely into infinity.'81 As Sells points out, the same swinging can be observed in Plotinus' writings as well.82 This perpetual oscillation and shifting logic that paralyze the reader have been hallmarks of many apophatic thinkers and texts. 76 'All metaphors, like categories, highlight certain aspects of things and obscure others... A critique of a metaphor, then, does not consist in showing that it is somehow "wrong" but in pointing out what it hides and noting the importance, for certain purposes, of attending to these hidden aspects.'

Maimonides and Ibn 'Arab! are two apophatic thinkers who firmly stand on their poles critically positing themselves against the other pole about the specific discussion on God's transcendence versus immanence. Maimonides shows the beyond of language through perpetual negation; negating, negating, and negating... Ibn 'Arabï, on the other hand, does this through deliberate paradoxes: yes and no, yes and no, and yes and no; 'all things are neither/nor, both/and, but never either/or.'83 In their non-linear but competing fashions, both are capable of using language to undermine its own ground and to refer to its beyond, constantly transforming not only themselves, but also their excited readers.
