<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> What Women Want: (Among Other Things)  Quality Art CHRISTOPHER PERRICONE Toward the end of “Of the Standard of Taste,” Hume summarizes what it  means to be “a true judge in the finer arts.” He says: “Strong sense, united  to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and  cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable character.”1  Throughout the essay, he also claims that his position is commonsensical  and naturalistic—that is, notwithstanding the diversity of opinion among  critics, there is a “structure of the mind . . . naturally calculated to give plea- sure,”2 that the “general principles of taste are uniform in human nature,”3  that the foundation of good taste lies in “the common sentiments of hu- man nature.”4 Hume is essentially right about what it means to be a good  critic. Good critics need strong cognitive skills to develop sound arguments.  They need to be perspicacious in discerning the finer sensuous details in  artworks. They need to be thoroughly practiced in the art of their choice.  They need a broad knowledge of their field in order to make salient and  significant comparisons, which, in turn, will place their subject matter in its  proper thematic and historical contexts. And finally, perhaps most difficult  of all, they need to perform their acts of criticism, if not with an innocent  eye, at least as free as possible from those prejudices that would distort or  deform the object of their criticism. This last criterion, I have often thought,  might be a moral criterion in the sense that Hume is suggesting that criti- cism requires a sense of fair play, insofar as you imaginatively place yourself  in the audience for which the work was intended.  Hume’s position is fundamentally sound; however, it’s incomplete.  So, I’d like to add another criterion to Hume’s five: given the structure of  the mind, as we know it today, the “common sentiments” of human na- ture are not equally distributed. Thus, women are naturally disposed to be  educated as art critics and therefore are more likely to excel in art criticism  Christopher Perricone, is a professor of philosophy at Iona College in New Rochelle,  New York.

At first blush, this proposition may appear both outrageous and   preposterous. One could immediately point out that the historical record  reveals, perhaps as a result of a natural disposition in men or more likely  because of a prejudice against women, that the majority of critics—indeed,  the great critics, in fact—have been men. As I will try to show, however,  there exists sound scientific evidence to support my claim. One source of  evidence comes from evolutionary biology, more specifically Darwinian  and neo-Darwinian ideas on sexual selection. The other source of evidence  comes from evolutionary psychology, more specifically the differences be- tween male and female brains and minds.5  Now, before I go on to make my argument, let me be clear that I am not  arguing that every woman who is educated in art criticism would be a better  art critic than any man. That would be a preposterous claim. My claim that  women would make better critics than men is a probabilistic one, that is,  given what we currently know to be a woman’s general nature, she is more  likely to be a better critic than a man.  My argument will, in spirit and in some detail, be similar to the  argument  made by the evolutionary biologist Helena Cronin in a piece she wrote for  the Guardian. In that piece she is discussing the notion that women in gen- eral do not perform outstandingly well in the sciences and mathematics.  Although the mean scores on standardized mathematics examinations for  men and women are essentially the same, nevertheless, “In the US, even in  the top 1% of mathematical ability, only one woman to eight men makes a  career in maths, engineering, or science; the other seven choose medicine,  biology, law or even the humanities—typically to work with, and help,  people.”6 Even though politics or oppression of some sort should never be  ruled out, the reasons for these differences, Cronin says, run deeper than  mere male domination. Unsurprisingly, she says the roots of these differ- ences lie in our evolutionary history. They are: 1. Men’s intuitive mechanics  and “3-D thinking are naturally keener.” 2. Men have different dispositions,  interests, and values, i.e. they are more competitive, ambitious, status con- scious . . . and they would rather work with abstract ideas or objects than  with humans. Women are more focused on relationships, familial and oth- erwise. 3. “Sex differences exhibit greater male than female variance.” As  Cronin amusingly puts it, when it comes to science and mathematics, “more  men than women will be dunces but more will be geniuses.”7 Ultimately,  the aim of Cronin’s piece is to discuss intelligently the intellectual poten- tial of men and women so that smart education programs can be designed  and developed such that everyone has the opportunity to realize his or her  potential. In principle, I’d like to make a similar argument for women art  critics. If men have the brain machinery to make them geniuses in science  and mathematics and thus advance our empirical knowledge of the natu- ral world, it seems to me that women have the brain machinery to make  them geniuses in art criticism and thus advance our emotional knowledge  JAE 45_3 text.indd   89 7/19/11   8:29 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> 90  Perricone of the art world. Of course, I would suggest that both kinds of knowledge  are  essential to a good life.  Before discussing sexual selection and evolutionary psychology, I’d like  to take a slight but important detour and briefly look at art experience since  much of my argument about women as art critics will center around the idea  that art experience is an emotionally charged experience in an ideal sense.  In the expressionist tradition of Croce, Collingwood, Dewey, and Langer,  I tend to think that expression is a necessary condition of art. Although I  tend also to be skeptical about theories of art that purport to capture art’s  essence, nevertheless I think that a highly significant feature of any artwork  is its expressive character. Art creation and art appreciation seem to be much  about embodying emotion in and expressing emotion through some sensu- ous medium. In respect to the thinkers mentioned above, John Dewey is  especially compatible with my Darwinian agenda. He sees art processes, as  Darwin saw life processes, as emerging out of evolutionary/natural selec- tionist mechanisms.  Dewey begins his classic in philosophy of art, Art as Experience, with a  chapter entitled “The Live Creature.” In that chapter he attempts to estab- lish a continuity between the conditions of an artwork’s origins and that  artwork’s operation in experience. This continuity ultimately forms the ba- sis of his ideas on expression and art as “an experience.” As Dewey says,  “In order to understand the esthetic in its ultimate and approved forms,  one must begin with it in the raw.”8 He says that the approach to under- standing art is, in principle, no different from understanding “the flowering  of plants”; it is an understanding of “the interaction of soil, air, water and  sunlight that condition the growth of plants.”9 For Dewey, the world, espe- cially the living world, is one of rhythms and flux, a sense of stability and  change, balance and counterbalance, strife and rest, crisis and resolution, or- der and disorder, etc., etc. Experience emerges out of those dynamic forces.  He calls experience “heightened vitality.”10 He says, “Because experience is  the fulfillment of an organism in its struggles and achievements in a world  of things, it is art in germ.”11 Not only in ordinary experience lies the germ  of art, but also there is no distinction, in fact, between ordinary and art ex- perience. Again Dewey says, “Experience occurs continuously, because the  interaction of live creature and environing conditions is involved in the very  process of living.”12 However, as he also says, ordinary experience is often  distracted and dispersed. “An experience,” an art experience, although only  different in degree and not in kind from ordinary experience, is an experi- ence that “runs its course to fulfillment.”13 It is “integrated within and de- marcated in the general stream of experience from other experiences. [Thus]  A piece of work is finished in a way that is satisfactory; a problem receives  its solution . . . [there is] a consummation not a cessation. Such an experi- ence is a whole and carries with it its own individualizing quality and self- sufficiency. It is an experience.”14 JAE 45_3 text.indd   90 7/19/11   8:29 AM </page> <page sequence="4"> What Women Want  91  An experience in art is essentially an emotional experience. As a  matter  of fact, Dewey does not want to distinguish emotions from experience.  He says, “Experience is emotional but there are no separate things called  emotions in it.”15 What happens in art experience is that an experience is  rounded out “into completeness and unity as emotional.”16 If one were to  summarize the course of an experience, one would begin with impulse and  end with expression. Expression is a self-conscious and idealized marriage  of emotion, order, and material. Such a marriage effects a transformation.  Dewey illustrates the development of expressive acts in the following way: At first a baby weeps, just as it turns its head to follow light; there is  an inner urge but nothing to express. As the infant matures, he learns  that particular acts effect different consequences, that, for example,  he gets attention if he cries. . . . He thus begins to be aware of the  meaning of what he does. As he grasps the meaning of an act at first  performed from sheer internal pressure, he becomes capable of acts of  true expression. The transformation of sounds, babblings . . . and so  forth, into language is a perfect illustration of the way in which acts of  expression are brought into existence.17 It is important to note that, in principle, and this is Dewey’s point, this   illustration of biological/psychological development is no different from  the development of ordinary experience into art experience. The difference  in detail, however, is that rather than nature unfolding unimpeded, the art- ist now adds conscious intent to the picture, and in so doing “the artist ‘does  the deed that breeds’ the emotion.”18  This brief excursus into Dewey is meant to accomplish several things:  First, long before current thinkers were wondering about the connections  between biology, psychology, and art, Dewey was arguing for organic ways  in which one could discuss art. Second, there is good reason, given Dewey’s  position, to think that there is a continuity between ordinary and art ex- periences, that is, that art experiences are not a realm apart. As in respect  to all physical phenomena, there are only differences in degree and not in  kind. Thus, where one might have thought there were discontinuities, there  are continuities. Third, art experiences are fundamentally emotional expe- riences ordered, idealized, and embodied for the purpose, not merely for  the individual but also for a society, of producing experiences of fulfillment.  Finally, for my specific purposes, these ideas provide historical context as  well as connect the philosophical and scientific bases for my argument that  women are well disposed to be the best art critics.  So, if what Hume says about criticism is true, and if art is experience as  Dewey describes, what would dispose women to be keen art critics? Well,  let’s see what the scientists say. The short answer is, it’s the way women are  built in a biological and psychological sense. In many, perhaps most sens- es, men and women are built in the same way as a result of natural selec- tion. Men and women have ten fingers and ten toes. Men and women have  JAE 45_3 text.indd   91 7/19/11   8:29 AM </page> <page sequence="5"> 92  Perricone  binocular vision. Many of men’s and women’s survival skills are similar.  However, in addition to some obviously different primary sexual charac- teristics, when it comes to reproductive strategies, men and women are also  not quite the same. Indeed, men and women need to cooperate in order to  achieve reproductive success; however, they also compete in intra- and in- tersexual senses.  The idea that men and women employ different strategies in order to  achieve reproductive success goes back to Charles Darwin’s idea of sexual  selection.19 According to Darwin, there are two mechanisms that account  for the evolution of species: natural and sexual selection. Natural selec- tion is strictly concerned with survival. It is the process by which organ- isms with characteristics better suited to their environment produce more  offspring than others with characteristics less suited to that environment.  As a result of natural selection, the proportion of well-adapted organisms  in an environment increases with each generation. Thus, on the one hand,  natural selection modifies the originally random variation of genetic traits  in a species so that alleles that are beneficial for survival tend to predomi- nate in a particular environment. On the other hand, the alleles that are  not beneficial tend to decrease. Sexual selection is, strictly speaking, con- cerned with reproductive success. It attempts to account for secondary  sexual characteristics of males and females that are not necessarily valuable  in the struggle for existence. As a matter of fact, some secondary sexual  characteristics are inimical to the struggle for existence, the paradigm case  being the peacock’s tail—that is, the peacock’s tail is heavy to lug around  and is conspicuous to predators. As Darwin says, “There are . . . sexual  differences quite unconnected with the primary reproductive organs, and  it is with these that we are more especially concerned—such as the greater  size, strength, and pugnacity of the male, his weapons of offence or means  of defense against his rivals, his gaudy colouring and various ornaments,  his power of song, and other such characters.”20 Sexual selection suggests  that females select mates having the most highly developed of such char- acteristics, thereby perpetuating those characteristics. Again, according to  Darwin, “The exertion of some choice on the part of the female seems a law  almost as general as the eagerness of the male.”21  I should immediately point out two things: First, female choice is not a  crucial factor in sexual selection in respect to all species. Darwin and others  recognize this.22 As Cronin and others point out, however, when it comes  to the human species, the female exerts not merely “some” but rather sig- nificant choice in the mating process. Furthermore, as she says, “Darwin’s  ultimate concern in Descent is to apply his theory of sexual selection to the  evolution of human races; the peacock’s tail is partly just a means to this  goal.”23 Second, some critics of sexual selection based on female choice  have argued that the whole concept is corrupt in the sense that it imputes  JAE 45_3 text.indd   92 7/19/11   8:29 AM </page> <page sequence="6"> What Women Want  93  conscious aesthetic values to creatures lacking the faculties to exercise any  such choices or judgments. Cronin addresses and answers this objection: There’s nothing necessarily anthropomorphic about female choice  of mates. To talk of female choice is only to say that there has been  selection for genes that have the effect of making females behave as  if they were choosing. Such talk makes no assumptions. . . . To say,  for example, that females “prefer” males who can give them attrac- tive sons, is merely to say that there are now, or have been in the  evolutionary past, genetic differences in the population that cause,  or have caused, differences in behaviour; and that, because of these  differences, some females have a greater probability than others of  mating preferentially in such a way that they end up with “attrac- tive” sons—that is, sons who will benefit from the same kind of pref- erential mating. . . . The theory is not about discriminating animals  but about discriminating genes.24 I should add at this point that what is ultimately significant about human  sexual selection driven by female choice in respect to my argument is that  it forms the basis of the idea that it is the female who is the discriminat- ing and aesthetically fussy partner in the male-female relationship—her  reproductive success depends on, as Hume would say, such a “delicate  imagination.”  So, what is it precisely that women want in their sexual relationships?  Before answering that question, one needs to know what is the difference  between being male and being female. The answer is: the size of sex cells.  Males have small sex cells, sperm. Females have large sex cells, eggs. Men  produce millions of gametes. Women produce approximately four hundred  ova during their entire lifetimes. For men sex is a low-cost proposition. For  women, sex is a high-cost proposition, not only in respect to a limited and  nonreplenishable egg supply but also because of female parental invest- ment, that is, women invest not only their precious eggs in sexual relation- ships, they also invest time and energy in gestation, child bearing, lacta- tion, nurturing, and protecting offspring. Also, male sexual relationships  don’t end with a successful sexual union. Once a male is finished copulating  and smoking his cigarette, he is back on the reproductive market. Females,  however, are, if not barefoot, maybe pregnant. Consequently, once finished  copulating, females, whether they smoke or not, are potentially off the mar- ket for at least nine months, and probably longer. As a result, when it comes  to searching for mates and making choices for reproductive success, males  emphasize quantity, females quality. Correlatively, males are somewhat in- discriminate in mate choice; females are very discriminating in mate choice.  As David Buss says, there are a bewildering variety of ways that are significant to the choice of a  mate. Men vary in their physical prowess, athletic skill, ambition,  JAE 45_3 text.indd   93 7/19/11   8:29 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> 94  Perricone  industriousness, kindness, empathy, emotional stability, intelligence,  social skills, sense of humor, kin network, and position in the status  hierarchy. Men also differ in the costs they impose on a mating re- lationship: some come with children, bad debts, a quick temper. . . .  From among the thousands of ways in which men differ, selection over  hundreds of thousands of years focused women’s preferences laser-like on the  most adaptively valuable characteristics.25 So, here’s what women want, what their “laser-like” sights are set on:   economic capacity, social status, older men, ambition and industriousness,  dependability and stability, intelligence, compatibility, size and strength,  good health, love and commitment.26  The evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller makes the connection  between what women want and art. Like Dewey, he has a bottom-up ap- proach to the origins and nature of art. He says: “The evolution of art is hard  to explain through survival selection, but is a pretty easy target for sexual  selection. The production of useless ornamentation that looks mysteriously  aesthetic is just what sexual selection is good at.”27 Miller is careful not to  reduce art instincts to sex instincts. Rather he argues that both are intimately  related as the result of sexual selection. Miller hypothesizes that the arts in  the Pleistocene age—for example, body ornamentation, cave decoration,  jewelry, clothing, and hand axes—were means that a male used “to attract  sexual partners by playing upon their senses and displaying one’s fitness.”  In other words, males employed body ornamentation, etc., in order to ad- vertise economic capacity, social status, etc.28 Also, Miller suggests, given  the close relationship between art and religion, early artistic production  may have also intimated that the artist possessed spiritual powers or the  power to cure disease.29 Of course, if art production is a fitness indicator,  then what artists are doing in some ultimate sense is trying to communicate  to women that they have what it takes to give them what they want; quality  art indicates quality genes and thus quality offspring. Although artistic pro- duction may not be the only way of attracting mates, nevertheless women  are artists’ essential target audience. As Miller says, Aesthetic significance does not deliver truth about the human condi- tion in general: it delivers truth about the condition of a particular hu- man, the artist . . . Plato and Hegel derogated art for failing to deliver  the same sort of truth that they thought philosophy could produce.  They misunderstood the point of art. It is unfair to expect a medium  that evolved to display biological fitness to be well adapted for com- municating abstract philosophical ideas.30  Miller argues further that much of our Pleistocene mentality drives art  production to this very day. Art production throughout history and across  cultures has been dominated by males. This is not merely the result of male  domination over and oppression of women, as some feminists would have  us believe. Miller says that JAE 45_3 text.indd   94 7/19/11   8:29 AM </page> <page sequence="8"> What Women Want  95 males [produce] about ten times more cultural output, across all   media, than females . . . Given the observations by Darwin (1871)  and hundreds of other researchers (see Andersson 1994) that male  courtship displays are almost always more frequent, more energetic,  brighter, louder and more strongly motivated than female displays,  the most parsimonious biological interpretation of the cultural di- morphism is this: human cultural production functions largely as  a courtship display, and the persistent sex difference in public cul- tural production rates reflects an evolved sex difference in courtship  strategies.31  I said above that the difference between males and females is sex cell  size, but there is another difference, according to Simon Baron-Cohen, that  will complete my discussion on sexual selection. Of course, natural and  sexual selection produce different morphologies in respect to the males and  females of all species; however, they also produce in respect to all species  different brains and minds, and thus different behaviors. In respect to homo  sapiens, as psychologist Baron-Cohen puts it, there is an “essential differ- ence” between men and women. This essential difference is also important  to my argument.  At the beginning of his book The Essential Difference, Baron-Cohen tells  us what is the difference in a brain/mind sense between men and women:  “The female brain is predominantly hard-wired for empathy. The male brain  is predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systems.”32 It  is important to recognize at the outset that Baron-Cohen uses the word “pre- dominately” in his definition, since he is not saying that women don’t at all  systematize and men don’t at all empathize. Rather, he says that “on aver- age, females spontaneously empathize to a greater degree than males do.”33  So, on the one hand, empathy is a capacity to react in an emotionally appro- priate way to the emotion of another; such an emotional reaction occurs in  order to understand and to connect with that other person emotionally, and  furthermore to predict that other person’s behavior: “Empathy arises out of  natural desire to care about others.”34 On the other hand, “systematizing is  the drive to analyze, explore, and construct a system. The systematizer in- tuitively figures out how things work, or extracts the underlying rules that  govern the behavior of a system. This is done in order to understand and  predict the system, or to invent a new one.”35  After laying down these definitions, which are not merely the result  of ordinary language analysis but rather based on experimental studies,   Baron-Cohen begins to draw out the implications. Here are some that are  particularly relevant to my thesis. 1. Baron-Cohen asks whether or not it is “possible to systematize a   person.” He answers, no. In the spite of what some philosophers ar- gue, Baron-Cohen thinks that human behavior is not governed by  rules in any useful sense, such that we could understand and predict  JAE 45_3 text.indd   95 7/19/11   8:29 AM </page> <page sequence="9"> 96  Perricone a person’s behavior by an appeal to, let’s say, if-then rules. “ Consider  the rule ‘if people get what they want, they will be happy.’ Say that you  followed that rule and gave Julia what she wanted for her birthday;  why is she still not happy? Systematizing just cannot get a foothold  into things like a person’s fluctuating feelings. While the natural way  to understand and predict the nature of events and objects is to sys- tematize, the natural way to understand a person is to empathize.”36 2. “To systematize you need detachment in order to monitor information  and track which factors cause the information to vary. To empathize  you need some degree of attachment in order to recognize that you are  interacting with a person, not an object, but a person with feelings,  and whose feelings will affect your own.”37 3. Empathizing means imagining yourself in the shoes of another . . .  what it is like to be that other person. Thus “empathizing leads you  to constantly search people’s tone of voice and to scan people’s faces,  especially their eyes, to pick up how they might be feeling or what  they might be thinking. . . . [as a result] your view of the world may  not be the only one, or the true one, and that their views and feelings  matter.”38 “The female approach seems to be to assume from the out- set that there might be subjectivity in the world. Therefore, they make  room for multiple interpretations, each of which might have an equal  claim to being a valid viewpoint.”39 4. “Empathy is a defining feature of human relationships . . . it helps you  tune into someone else’s world.”40 Sympathy is one type of empathic  response. 5. Empathy allows for communication and conversation. “Real conversa- tion is sensitive to this listener at this time.”41 It encourages dialogue. 6. Females show greater concern for others and engage in more comfort- ing behaviors. 7. Females develop a theory of mind earlier than males, that is, they have  the ability to understand others’ feelings and have the ability to take  others’ perspective at an earlier stage of development. 8. Females tend to value and to develop altruistic, reciprocal relation- ships.42 I don’t want to discuss at any length what Baron-Cohen says about the  male brain and mind since it is not particularly relevant to my thesis. Let it  suffice to say that the male as systematizer is particularly adept at dealing  with technical and abstract problems. He attends to detail, classifies, builds,  organizes, and likes to compete. As Baron-Cohen says: “the big pay-off of   systematizing is control.”43 JAE 45_3 text.indd   96 7/19/11   8:29 AM </page> <page sequence="10"> What Women Want  97  Naturally, one wonders what are the causes of these psychological sex  differences. Although Baron-Cohen does not want to eliminate the role of  culture in accounting for these differences, he believes that the appeal to  culture leaves, at best, the story incomplete. The scientific evidence more  and more seems to point compellingly to biological differences between  males and females, especially in hormonal and genetic senses; according to  Baron-Cohen, studies on testosterone and autism are specifically relevant.44  Of course, ultimately the essential difference between men and women is  explained by natural and sexual selection.  So let’s again talk about art and art criticism now in light of these cur- rent scientific claims. The crucial ideas to my thesis that women poten- tially make better art critics than men are female choice and empathy. As  I have outlined the scientific evidence, I have suggested ways in which  these ideas and their implications might apply to my thesis. Let me now  be more explicit.  1. Art creation is among the many male displays aimed at attracting  women. As Miller points out, the great majority of cultural displays are per- formed by men. When it comes to displays of musical genius, especially in  composition, men are overwhelmingly dominant. The same goes for paint- ing and sculpture. Although I can think of some great women authors, for  example, Jane Austen and Emily Dickinson, nevertheless, again, men seem  to dominate. The same is true for architecture. Perhaps choreography can  claim the greatest number of women geniuses; however, I would still be re- luctant to say that women dominate even that field. Now, as I have already  suggested, it would be foolish to say that male competitive and aggressive  behavior played no cultural role in oppressing women. It would be equally  foolish, however, to deny a biological role to these specific circumstances,  that is, the role of sexual selection. In the sexually reproducing animal king- dom, the role of the male, for the most part, is display for sake of reproduc- tive success. This role, however, does not relegate the female to a second- class status. On the contrary, the female has a crucial role. Remember men’s  reproductive strategy is quantity, women’s quality. Although men display,  nevertheless women choose. So, the male may, for the most part, be the artist,  but the female is the audience, and, I should add, not “audience” in any pas- sive sense of the term. The female in some essential sense determines what  the next generation of offspring will look like. She determines the length of  the peacock’s tail. Analogously, the female, as art critic, may very well deter- mine what the next generation of art will look like. Given the fundamentally  social character of art, I would suggest that both sides of the equation are of  equal value. Think of it this way: women do not merely want to be critical  in respect to men’s displays, artistic and otherwise, they need to be critical of  male displays for the sake of their own survival and  reproductive success.  As I suggested above, women, as choosers, are partners through sexual se- lection in the building of men’s bodies and behaviors.45 In short, men would  JAE 45_3 text.indd   97 7/19/11   8:29 AM </page> <page sequence="11"> 98  Perricone not display at all were it not for women and what they want. Of course, I  want to say that goes, most crucially, for art display as well.  2. David Buss argued that women in sexual relationships focus on those  characteristics that are adaptively most valuable. Among other things, what  this means is that women will mate with those men who display the poten- tial for producing similar characteristics in their sons and grandsons. Con- comitantly, women will also be reinforcing their sense of choosiness in their  daughters. Now, it is unlikely that any man, artist or otherwise, will indi- cate all the positive characteristics a woman wants. Yet among the choices  offered to women by men, what artists offer, and especially great artists,  is quite adaptively valuable. Although history is filled with tales of starv- ing artists, nevertheless many artists have great economic capacity. Artists,  even those with bleak financial prospects, typically have very high social  status. Artists, even when the odds are against them, are among the most  ambitious and industrious in society. And it is noncontroversial that they  are intelligent. Are artists always dependable in their sexual relationships?  No. Are they always healthy? No. However, as in many of our negotiations  and transactions, and especially in high stakes games, there are trade-offs  and compromises. Thus, women make compromises in terms of with whom  they will mate. This does not, however, mitigate the fact that women will  be keen and critical about what artists do in their displays. If artists do not  have all the characteristics that women want, they surely display through  their work those characteristics that seem to promise precisely what women  want. To be a great artist you must work hard, you must be committed to  your vision, you must seek resources to keep you alive, you must be strong  to endure rejection and hardship. These characteristics, if not true of the art- ist himself, are precisely what is often true of his art and the imaginative  ideals it embodies. So much of great art expresses in style: order, balance,  form, dynamism, unity; so much of art expresses in content: harmony, integ- rity, struggle, triumph, heroic action in the face of implacable adversity, etc.  Perhaps in this sense there is a deceptive element to art, not as Plato thought  but in the sense that the artist through the expressions of his work is promis- ing women what they want notwithstanding whether or not he himself can  actually deliver. It is often difficult for anyone to distinguish the man from  what he does. Of course, the artist may deliver. Even if the artist does not  deliver, however, the art does. In art, as in the mating process, appearance  (in the sense of aesthetic qualities) is everything.  3. Given that ordinary and art experience, as Dewey argues, is only   different in degree, and given that there is continuity in the development  of art creation from nest building to symphony and epic poetry composi- tion,46 it should not be surprising that females of many sexually reproduc- ing species will be perspicacious observers of male behavior. Having the  potential for being a good critic, like having the potential for being a good  JAE 45_3 text.indd   98 7/19/11   8:29 AM </page> <page sequence="12"> What Women Want  99 musician, mathematician, or athlete, is probably much about having a   particularly strong nature, which then is developed by a well-informed and  well-structured nurturing process. In the specific case of an art critic, having  a particularly strong nature, in part, means being born a woman. Nurturing  that is well informed and well structured means having the kind of educa- tion suggested by Hume’s five criteria of good taste. As Cronin says, we  need to start with discriminating genes of a certain sort. Women have those  genes that are most discriminating when it comes to male display. Given  the continuity in nature, in this respect, men and women are no different in  kind from bower birds, as well as the innumerably other sexually dimor- phic  species where males build nests, sing, dance, or show off their physical  prowess . . . and then the females choose.  4. I said that Miller, like Dewey, has a bottom-up approach to art creation.  Both think of art in terms of a long historical perspective, that is, art his- tory goes back as far as the Pleistocene age and its origins go back beyond  the emergence of the human species itself. Thinking of art in long historical  perspective is consistent with connecting animal, hominid, early, and more  recent human behaviors. Although it has been argued that “the modern sys- tem of the arts”—that is, art creation and art criticism as we know it—is a  product of the eighteenth century, nevertheless, in this essay I am arguing  for a much more comprehensive view of what we understand art to be.47  Like Miller and Dewey, I would not omit evolutionary ideas from either the  emergence of our species or the emergence of art.48  5. Although explaining and predicting natural phenomena requires   systematic thinking as exemplified in scientific method, nevertheless when  it comes to understanding and appreciating the emotional world, empathy  is far more effective. Thus, understanding aesthetic objects seems analogous  to understanding persons rather than understanding natural objects and  events. Understanding and appreciating an aesthetic object seems similar  to being tuned into the feelings of another person. I am reminded here of  Aristotle, who famously said at the beginning of the Nicomachean Ethics: “It  is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in each class of things  just so far as the nature of the subject admits; it is evidently equally foolish  to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician and to demand from a  rhetorician scientific proofs.”49 In short, not all understanding proceeds in  the same way. Although one can reason about the art world, there seems  to be no aesthetic method analogous to scientific method that one might  apply in order to appreciate a work of art. As a result, as Baron-Cohen sug- gests, although there are rules to follow to understand the natural world  and abstractions, there are no hard and fast rules for understanding the  individual. By analogy, since there are no rules, strictly speaking, for un- derstanding art and appreciating art, the natural way to understand and to  appreciate a work of art is to empathize. Cronin, Miller, and Baron-Cohen  JAE 45_3 text.indd   99 7/19/11   8:29 AM </page> <page sequence="13"> 100  Perricone suggest, in their various ways, that women are not strong when it comes to  dealing with general or abstract ideas. However, what they are strong at, as  Baron-Cohen says, is empathy in the full sense of the word. Quite simply, if  women are hard-wired for empathy, as Baron-Cohen argues, then they will  be particularly sensitive to and discriminating toward expressive objects,  since expressive objects are specifically wrought to engage and to absorb us;  they invite us into their worlds in order that we experience those worlds as,  according to Dewey, an experience. What kinds of genes would you want to  appreciate an experience, to be a good critic? You would want those genes  that would dispose you to take well to the kind of education that would  produce good taste; you would want those genes that would best incline  you to empathizing rather than to systematizing. Given the nature of art,  you would want genes that incline you to understanding the individual  rather than the general. Here, I mean not only individual as person but also  individual as aesthetic object. Surely, representational art often deals with  characters, their nature and relationships. And being a good critic means,  among other things, being a keen observer of the human condition in all its  manifestations. However, one should also not forget that the art object itself,  the expressive object itself, representational or otherwise is an individual:  it is unique; it is not an abstraction; it presents itself as “being there”; it is  this aesthetic object at this time; the individuality and the peculiarity of the  art object is its power and value; in this sense, the art object is not “translat- able” into another language and it is non-paraphraseable. The art object is  the kind of thing and has the kind of qualities that are perfectly compatible  and ultimately best apprehended and comprehended by a mind wired for  empathy. As Baron-Cohen says, empathy requires attachment. Art invites at- tachment in the most profound and perhaps most intimate sense. As both  Hume and Baron-Cohen say, the empathetic person and the good art critic  put themselves imaginatively in the shoes of another. They are keen and dis- criminating in respect to tone, slight gesture, and nuance in order to “read”  others’ minds and the expressions of those others’ minds. Indeed, as Baron- Cohen says, studies seem to indicate that women are particularly adept at  this aspect of empathy given their early development of a theory of mind.  Furthermore, women are more likely to see things from various points of  view; they are amenable to multiple interpretations. Again, this is precisely  consistent with the nature of art and is particularly important to art inter- pretation, evaluation, and criticism. The fact that women connect well and  care about others also is consistent with a sound approach to art objects.  Given that art objects are expressive objects, and that expressive objects pro- duce an experience, connecting well and caring about those objects is crucial  to an emotional understanding of them. Women have greater aptitude in  communication and conversation, which again characterizes well the na- ture of art and its aims. So much of our response to art is concerned with  JAE 45_3 text.indd   100 7/19/11   8:29 AM </page> <page sequence="14"> What Women Want  101 dialogue about the meaning of art objects. In some sense, the  qualities of  reciprocal  altruism are best revealed in the transactions between art and au- dience; and, of course, that sensitivity to reciprocal relationships is brought  into relief by a woman’s inclination to empathy.  6. And finally . . . if there is any truth in what I have argued about the  nature of art and the nature of women, it would appear that encouraging  women to seek education in the arts, as well as providing opportunities for  women in the arts, would not only have positive effects on society in gen- eral but would have positive effects specifically in the arts, as well.

The idea that women inspire men to create art is an ancient idea. Among the  many examples one might cite, consider the invocation of the muses in Homer,  “Sing, Goddess, the anger of Peleus’ son Achilleus” (Iliad, trans. Richmond Lat- timore [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961), 1.1. The argument in this  essay should be construed as a complement to that ancient idea, with some good  science added.  6.
