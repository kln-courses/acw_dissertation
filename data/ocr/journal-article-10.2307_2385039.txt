<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fujinoki Tomb and Its Grave-Goods by J. EDWARD KIDDER, JR T nHE excavation of tombs in Japan is so commonplace that only a most unusual find makes its mark on archaeological history.' However, when the structure, contents, or interior furnishings of a tomb have a significant bearing on the political, social, or cultural conditions of the past, the discovery takes on a special meaning. Only two have caught the public's eye in the past fifteen years and have become household words. One is the Takamatsuzuka , tomb in Asuka, Nara prefecture, which attracted a great deal of attention in 1972. Its plastered walls and small paintings in a relatively current continental style gave art of the Hakuho period a new respec- tability and relieved Japan of the burden of feeling deprived of one of the major art forms of that time. The tomb is presumed to have been the burial place of an intimate member of the royal family who died around A.D. 695.2 The media inflated this discovery into one of the ten top stories of the year. The other example is the Fujinoki )*t/ * tomb in Ikaruga, also in Nara prefecture, which was opened in 1985 and yielded a spectacular array of horse- trappings. Brief and incomplete reports about Fujinoki were issued in the latter half of the year and some of the excavated objects were exhibited in late October. The first spectacular news appeared in the morning press on 3 December and gave the exaggerated impression of a completely intact tomb. The archaeologists were prepared for the media by early December, and THE AUTHOR is professor of art and ar- chaeology, Division of Humanities, Interna- tional Christian University. 1 In the Kinki alone, as recorded for 1984, over 240 mounded tombs were dug. Not all clustered tombs are described individually (Shiga, 9; Kyoto, more than 17; Mie, 39; Nara, 60; Wakayama, 3; Osaka, more than 5; Hyogo, more than 110).

On 15 December the one-day showing of a small number of grave-goods recovered from the site attracted 2,368 visitors, while some 23,000 people went to see a one-week exhibition of the items in February 1986 at the Ikaruga-cho Kominkan despite its inaccessible location. The initial excitement was almost as great as that caused by the Takama- tsuzuka tomb a dozen years earlier, for the quantity, quality, and uniqueness of decoration put the finds into a special category. But public interest in objects such as riding gear starts at a lower level of understanding and is considerably more fleeting. In addition, the Takamatsuzuka paintings were totally new to the art scene, whereas the Fujinoki material is merely more, better, and diverse than what has been already found elsewhere. Location The Fujinoki tomb is located about 350 m west of the Nishidaimon, or Great West Gate, of Horyfiji in Ikaruga-cho. Excavations by the Kashihara Institute of Archaeology were started in July 1985 and lasted through December.3 From evidence in the first exploratory trenches cut through the mound, the tomb was thought to belong to the Middle Kofun period, that is, the fifth century, and this was officially stated on the formal sign posted at the site. But this designa- tion was later pasted over to read Koki, or Late Period, after the long stone passageway and chamber had been opened and a variety of grave-goods, together with chronologically datable types of Sue and Haji pottery, had been discovered. The tomb, in fact, was built in the late decades of the sixth cen- tury, and the quality of its furnishings indicates that it was the final resting place of the ranking personality of the area. Fujinoki now seems to be a strangely isolated mound, but this was not necessarily so in the distant past. The clustering of tombs together can be explained by family-related reasons, provided the range of time or time gaps between construction are not too great. But an isolated tomb should first be studied in the topographical context, since it may actually be the only sur- vivor of a group, especially if the area is known to have had a history of one or more occasions of'population influx. Destruction of tombs proceeds at a faster rate today than ever before in the past. Modern housing and commercial developments have created havoc in traditional areas, starting with the demand for more farmland during World War II and accelerating as 'bed towns' have been built. Examples of this can be found across the hills from Ikaruga. Parts of the Mozu Tomb Group in Sakai, south of Osaka, among which is the largest tomb of all, the reputed tomb of Emperor Nintoku, are being transformed into a park and will include 3 Ikaruga-machi Kyoiku Iinkai, Ikaruga Fu- jinoki Kofun / t , 1986 (catalog for exhibition held 16-26 February).</page><page sequence="3">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 59 / \ 1. Ikaruga: tombs within a four-kilometer radius of Horyfiji. a new museum. The group of chiefly fifth-century tombs totalled 92 before the war. This number is now down to 46, and only 16 among these are well preserved today. Twenty-three tombs are half-destroyed and seven more are expected to disappear when the park is expanded.4 There is good evidence that numerous tombs once dotted the Ikaruga land- scape. A small one lies about 150 m to the northeast of Fujinoki, while another is about 200 m to the northwest. One small mound is located in the bus parking lot along the east side of the long avenue approaching Horyfiji. Not long ago at least three about 250 m to the west were razed to make way for new housing. Many tombs are still left on the lower slopes of the neighboring hills, chiefly 4 Gekkan Bunkazai Hakkutsu Shutsudo Joho A fUJ ftLt M, W?1 [GB], 86:4, p. 89.</page><page sequence="4">60 Monumenta Nipponica, 42:1 to the north. The selection of any particular site will never be rationally ex- plained except within the broadest context of geomantic principles of direc- tions, natural conditions, and appropriate timing. The larger locality was family territory, but the necromancer's mystique for determining the location of each individual tomb was fraught with irrational intuition. Archaeologically, it was the destruction of local tombs that led to the initial misdating of the Fujinoki tomb. In the first digging in the fall of 1985 the mound was found to contain many fragments of haniwa cylinders of a type ascribed to the fifth century. In fact, however, such cylinders were out of style by the time the tomb was built. Further evidence of the practice of clearing ground indiscriminately- presumably if no families remained to claim any connection with the tombs- came in the recovery of thousands of fragments of cylindrical haniwa from trenches in the cloistered courtyard of the present Horyuiji when it was dug to install a new draining and plumbing system. Several tombs must have been flattened to make way for the new, second temple. It is inconceivable that Hory-aji and the Fujinoki tomb have only a coinciden- tal relationship. Prince Shotoku's own temple, Ikaruga-dera or Wakakusa- dera, was constructed around 607 a little to the southeast of the present Horyfji. The complex was destroyed by fire in 669 or 670 and was replaced by Hory-iji in the late years of the century or early in the following. It is therefore not with any personality of the second and present temple with which Fujinoki can be associated, but with Ikaruga-dera, that used to stand about 540 m to the east of the tomb. Records Documents mentioning imperial tombs contain pertinent information about Fujinoki. First, they suggest that the tomb was originally keyhole in shape and, second, that it was once listed as an imperial tomb, the burial place of Emperor Sushun, d. 592. Two nineteenth-century reports were compiled by Tomobayashi Mitsuhira {tWY , a monk who was asked by the governor of Yamato to consider all the available material on the tombs, and to select and identify those that should be acceptable for an approved list of imperial tombs.5 Tomobayashi trudged around the area for several years and his investiga- tions covered considerable territory. His first report, dated Ansei 3 (1856), is titled Ansei Sannen Shiwasu Junryo Kiji i qgEe4d ('Articles on the pilgrimage to the imperial tombs in the last month of Ansei 3'). The second is dated Bunky-i 2 (1862) and is titled Noyama no Nageki ff Oo tr ('Lamenta- tions of the mountains'). Tomobayashi tells a curious story in the first work. West of what is now 5 GB, 86:3, p. 95.</page><page sequence="5">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 61 called Ikaruga-cho was Aza-misasagi, a locality of imperial tombs (misasagi, or ryo, I) where a nunnery called Misasagi no An had once stood on the top of the hill. Its occupant had gone by the name of Misasagi no ni. The hill, that is, the tomb, was shaped like a fish (gyoshi or uoko If). The nunnery had been destroyed by fire before Tomobayashi visited the place; it had not been rebuilt, and the site had been turned into rice fields. According to Noyama no Nageki, the mound was 'fish-shaped' and had the earmarks of an imperial tomb. The word implying a shape resembling the tail of a fish is now accepted by archaeologists as one in use before the modern standardized term zempo-koen -iOVYW (rendered in English as 'keyhole-shaped') entered the technical vocabulary. This means literally 'square-front round-back', but falls short of creating an adequate mental image for anyone not familiar with the shape. Aerial views taken in connection with the investigations of Fujinoki show a small raised uncultivated area to the east, and other topographical features sug- gest that the square part of the tomb extended in that direction. The angles of the passageway and chamber would then be generally consistent with other long-chambered keyhole-shaped tombs. Horytiji owns a document, dated Ansei 1 (1854) and titled Sogenji Monjo JQ, in which the tomb is said to belong to Emperor Sushun and to have been listed in Taiko Kenchi tkl 1t of Bunroku 4 (1595) as exempt from taxation on account of its status as an imperial tomb. Sogenji Monjo calls the nunnery Ryosanoji-in Hoshakuji, saying that it had stood on the hill but had been subsequently destroyed by fire. There is a Kagen-ki -dKC reference of Jowa 3 (1347) to a ceremony held at 'West Place Imperial Hall' (Saigoryo- do, or Sairiryo-do), and Takada Ryoshin takes it as meaning the building later known as Hoshakuji (actually a nunnery, not a monastery) and therefore inferring that already some two and half centuries earlier than the Taiko Kenchi statement the tomb was recognized as and had the importance of an imperial mausoleum.6 The key word in these names is, of course, ryo, or imperial tomb. But if the Fujinoki was originally an imperial tomb, it had certainly lost its place of honor by Meiji times.7 The official inventory now lists Sushun as buried in a circular mound in Shkurai, Nara prefecture, some eighteen kilometers south- east of Ikaruga. The Tomb The round proportions of the Fujinoki mound today measure 40 m in diameter and 8 m in height. The stone passageway and chamber are entered 6 GB, 86:3, p. 95. 7 Such a change in status happened to Takamatsuzuka, which was recorded in Edo documents as the tomb of Emperor Mommu. It was later removed from the imperial list when the designation was shifted to a larger mound nearby.</page><page sequence="6">62 Monumenta Nipponica, 42:1 m 2. Plan of Fujinoki tomb.

This internal construction is oriented almost exactly southeast to northwest. A large stone sarcophagus of unusual shape lies across the back of the chamber. Assuming that the head of the deceased would have been at its larger end, the body would have been pointing toward the northeast. The total length of the internal stone construction is 14.5 m and puts the Fu- jinoki tomb among the ten longest in Japan. In floor plan, the passageway simply widens slightly to form a chamber 6.31 m in length and 2.63 m in width. The height, however, rises sharply from 2.24 m in the passageway to 4.14 m in the chamber, providing the grand spaciousness typical of this style of tomb in the Kyoto-Nara area. As regards size, Fujinoki compares favorably with the Ishibutai tomb in Asuka, a massive exposed stone passageway and chamber commonly believed to be the burial place of Soga no Umako R d. 626.8 Considering Umako's megalomaniacal inclinations, the tomb's identification with him is probably correct. He built Asuka-dera in the last decade of the sixth century on a scale well beyond that of the modest means of the time, and its plan was never repeated. In terms of cubic space and gigantic slabs, Umako's tomb was the largest of all. The Mise-maruyama tomb, also in Asuka, was originally far bigger than the nearby moated one currently attributed to Emperor Kimmei, d. 571. Its front end has been totally leveled by farmers, but it has the longest chamber of all. Unfortunately the tomb's internal dimensions were not fully recorded before 8 Hamada Kosaku A FB E , Takahashi Itsuo AWVnt &amp; Umehara Sueji I Yamato Shimanoshto Ishibutai no Kyoseki Kofun t ffi-T - f e EtJ, Kyoto Teikoku Daigaku, 14, 1937.</page><page sequence="7">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 63 Longest Stone Passageways and Chambers of Tombs Name and Passageway Chamber Total Sarco- Location length width height length width height length phagus *Mise-maruyama Asuka, Nara-ken 18.0 1.8 2.7 7.2 5.5 ? 25.2 2 **Miyajidake, Tsuyazaki-machi, Fukuoka-ken 2.5 3.0 22.0 0 ***Ayazuka, Katsuyama-cho, Fukuoka-ken 15.9 2.4 2.9 3.5 3.6 3.8 19.4 1 Otsuka, Kibi-gun, Okayama-ken 10.6 2.3 2.4 8.6 3.3 3.5 19.2 3 cists Ishibutai, Asuka, Nara-ken 11.0 2.5 open 7.7 3.5 4.7 18.7 0 Komorizuka, Okayama-shi 8.9 2.3 3.0 8.0 3.5 3.4 16.9 1 Hebizuka, Kyoto-shi 10.0 2.5 3.0 6.3 4.0 5.0 16.3 0 FUJINOKI 8.2 2.1 2.25 6.3 2.6 4.1 14.5 1 The measurements, given in meters, are usually the highest or widest dimensions; some are rounded off. *No longer accessible; the widths and heights are estimated. **The passageway is continuous, with no break for a chamber. ***The dimensions are of the larger of two chambers. it was put on the Kunaisho's protection list.9 A good guess is that Mise- maruyama is in fact the burial place of Kimmei, although it never seems to have had a moat, one of the characteristics of the 'imperial' tombs in the Osaka-Nara region. Some of the large granite blocks in the Fujinoki chamber measure more than two meters in length. The immense overhead slabs in both the passageway and chamber are particularly impressive. Surprisingly little infiltration of soil between the blocks speaks well for the fit of the roofing stones. A sealing w~1l of rough stones filled the entrance of the passageway to a depth of 3.5 m. The remaining floor of the passage had been paved with a thick layer of large pebbles. Beyond the entrance barrier was a stone-filled ditch running down the center of the passageway. Depressions along the foot of the walls carried off water seepage. Earth from a covering mound naturally tends to slide into the passageway, especially if the tomb has been entered by looters, for such tampering invariably induces more seepage. 9 William Gowland, 'The Dolmens of Japan and Their Builders', in Transactions and Proceedings of the Japan Society, Lon- don, 4, 1897-1898, p. 182 (Gowland's dolmen no. 121).</page><page sequence="8">64 Monumenta Nipponica, 42:1 The Fujinoki chamber itself has no drainage system other than the pebble floor. In Ishibutai the chamber has side drains that meet in a central trough to empty out through the passageway. The clogged state of the drains when such a tomb is excavated indicates that they had a short practical life and that, despite the appearance of greater sophistication in the Ishibutai system, the Fujinoki stone floor was a more efficient solution to the problem of interior water seepage. Grave-goods The first surprise is the staggering quantity and quality of the grave-goods, and the fact that the tomb survived major predations. Most of the tombs with long stone passageways stand open today, stripped of their grave-goods and, quite possibly, even of their stone sarcophagi. Few other prominent tombs escaped plunder, although admittedly we know little about those classified as 'imperial tombs' under the jurisdiction of the Kunaisho, for that office does not publish what information it possesses on the history of the plundering. In the case of some tombs, references in early records throw light on the subject. For exam- ple, there is a thirteenth-century document describing the interior of the coburial tomb of Emperor Temmu and Empress Jito in Asuka after pilfering had been discovered. A fourteenth-century text purports to provide similar information about the tomb of Prince Shotoku in Taishi-cho, although in this case the document has little credible value. Some people may like to believe that the Fujinoki tomb owes its relatively in- tact condition to the fact that it lies within the area protected by Horyfiji's 'earth-pacifying' deposits (jichingu Patz) that ward off spirits bent on causing natural disasters.10 It is true that, despite some tragic losses, such as the destruction of the kondo by fire in 1949, Horyutji has survived much better than most temples. But at the same time, without cooperative monks a full ring of jichingu would be of little use to protect a temple or tomb. Monks have a far from perfect record as grave wardens and are generally not regarded as suitable custodians to be entrusted with such responsibility. It remains to be explained how some attractive grave-goods have found their way into the treasure houses of several shrines and temples; Horytiji itself owns a few such items of remarkable quality. Several reasons can be given for believing that the tomb had been previously entered. The east corner of the lid and body of the stone sarcophagus are both chipped, resembling the modus operandi of amateurish pilferers who lacked the strength to raise the lid.'11 All the pottery was situated well to one side at the front of the chamber, the large floor space in front of the sarcophagus strange- 1o GB, 83:4, pp. 54-55, &amp; 83:9, p. 96. 11 Fujinoki Kofun, pp. 5ff.</page><page sequence="9">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 65 ly empty as though the area had been stripped. I believe that most of the pot- tery had been moved once-although not too roughly-to make working space for the looters who were frustrated by the lack of room and light. The largest of the vessels and one medium-sized one still stood upright. Earth tremors and narrow bases may be partly responsible for upsetting the others, although some are quite wide-based. There are further reasons why the tomb may have once been entered. Among the 59 pieces of pottery are 16 loose lids of the Sue type that do not fit any of the vessels. While this strange mismatch should be checked against other finds of relatively unlooted tombs, it is difficult to account for such a tomb being the dumping ground for lids. A man of such prominence as to merit such a grandiose resting-place was not in need of cheap grave-goods. My guess is that the pots were taken by the pilferers, who failed in their attempt to loot the tomb thoroughly because they were caught in the act. The tomb was then quickly resealed by responsible officials. Whatever happened, the choices are few. The canny burial managers tucked the mass of grave-goods, many of them wrapped in cloth, down behind the sar- cophagus in a space so narrow and dark that no one would have thought to look there or would have seen them if they did. Alternatively, the thieves were caught or their tracks traced, and the goods were stashed away to avoid any recurrence of the plunder. Or were the items placed there to be as close to the dead man as possible? It seems preposterous that such exotic grave-goods were ignominiously stacked there without reason, for surely they would have been treated more ceremoniously. Unless there were grave-goods on the floor in front of the sarcophagus that the thieves did get away with, the losses are presumed to have been slight. But the stone sarcophagus has yet to be opened, and much mileage is being gained from the suspense. The reason given for the delay is an exhausted budget: the results of opening the tomb proved to be far beyond expectation, and the time and expense consumed in dealing with the artifacts have been greater than an- ticipated. Having had some experience with archaeological budgets in Japan, I personally accept this explanation for the present and suspect no hidden motives. But I grant some strange quirks when it comes to the attitude of the authorities (not the archaeologists) toward the ancient tombs. At any rate, the 1987 budget should provide enough funds to continue with the work. There exists a relevant case in point. In November 1983 investigators found in Horyfiji the second jichingu, covered by a huge granite slab. Although it might well answer questions raised in documents of the thirteenth and eigh- teenth centuries as to the location of the jichingu, the head priest would not allow it to be opened, claiming that the unsealing was not in the will of Prince Shotoku. The prince's spirit dominates all, but this particular case is a historical anachronism. Prince Shotoku died in 622 and the new temple was</page><page sequence="10">66 Monumenta Nipponica, 42:1 built at the end of the century. And so the prince's prognostications concern- ing Ikaruga-dera have nothing to do with the present temple. 12 Sarcophagus The tufa sarcophagus in Fujinoki is made up of two sections: a body 1.26 m wide and 2.36 m long, rising toward the head where the total height is 1.5 m, and a large roof-shaped lid, also higher at one end. Thus the sarcophagus is a common 'house-shaped' type.13 The lid, estimated to weigh around 500 kilos, bears large carrying lugs on either side. The source of the tufa is Mt Nijo, where a substantial quarry about 12 km to the southwest of the tomb supplied the stone for many sarcophagi in the Nara and Osaka areas. Most of the stone cutting was done at the quarry, and the carrying lugs indicate that this was 12 In February 1983, true jichingu were discovered a little to the east of the cloister in the road leading from the Sai-in to the To-in. The significance of these articles was played down because it did not fit the conventional views about the dating of the rebuilding of the temple: the last decades of the seventh cen- tury. Two Haji bowls contained gold sheets and coins, the latter first minted in 708. These were a deposit made in a ground-breaking ceremony, an offering to the kami for a safe construction, and should be more seriously considered in regard to dating the erection of the second temple. These jichingu have become confused over the centuries with the fukusohin bang, the substitute relics buried in case the principal relics disappeared or lost their power. Jichingu were deposits made automatically at the beginning of a major construction phase and were too commonplace to be mentioned in the records. On the other hand, the fukusohin are said to have been buried "by order of Prince Shotoku during a period of Buddhist decline (mappo J1t). Three were deposited, de- scribed by Priest Kenshin WA in Kokon Mokurokusho Ue p J in 1238 as under the Sutra Repository in the northeast corner of the kondo, and to the southwest of the cloister. Smallish holes have been known, presumably for centuries, for the first two with no contents recorded. The third was found in the fall of 1983; its lid, a huge stone 2.5 x 2.0 m, was lying 10 cm under the same road that crosses in front of the Sai-in. Priest Ryokun AdII, in Kokon Ichiyosha i + Addi~, 1746, described a large stone near the Big Bath. Kenshin's description of this one makes it immediately clear that most of the fukusohin are not the sort of things that were used as relics in the seventh century: 10,000 bronze roof tiles, 30,000 gilt bronze mirrors, a bow and some arrows, and the sword used in killing Mononobe no Moriya. The tiles and the mirrors are, however, characteristic medi- eval votive gifts to temples from the ailing and the afflicted seeking cures. The Horyfiji authorities issued a statement for the media to the effect that Prince Shotoku had directed that the buried treasures should remain untouched for a millennium after his death and, even then, should be opened only if the temple falls on lean years and the power of Buddhism ebbs. Fortunately, Horyfiji is enjoy- ing good times, so the buried treasure does not need to be opened. One wonders whether the early writers had sorted out the relationship between the first and second temples, and how Ryokun could describe the stone cover so accurately. But should one blame the present authorities? After all, the hole in the kondo was said to con- tain 80,000 ryo of gold (more than a ton), 900 ryo of silver, and 10,000 ryo of copper. 13 About 400 house-shaped sarcophagi are known throughout the country, but the ex- amples that correspond most closely with the Fujinoki one in material and date are found in tombs across a southern arc of the Nara basin. They are hollowed out and have lugs on the 'roof', separated by a flat surface where the ridge would be.</page><page sequence="11">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 67 done in the case of the Fujinoki sarcophagus. The heightened and widened part for the head and shoulders is a traditional Chinese feature known since the Han dynasty, and this pattern has persisted in China into modern times. To the best of my knowledge, the shape of the Fujinoki sarcophagus is unique among house-shaped sarcophagi in Japan. The entire exterior surface of the sarcophagus was once covered with ver- milion paint, much of which still remains. Red paint used as lining for wooden coffins, the interior of tombs, and occasionally for miscellaneous grave- goods-as though they were simply dipped into buckets of it-was primarily, but not exclusively, a Yamato-area practice. Beginning with the Jomon period, hematite (Fe2O3) or red ochre, and less often, cinnabar (HgS) was applied to bones, ornaments, and utensils of the dead. The practice increased in populari- ty in the Yayoi period for skeletal remains and pottery. Many grave-goods from the mounded tombs have been subjected to this treatment. In the case of the Fujinoki sarcophagus, the extent of coverage is again probably unique and, one may assume, vermilion paint will be found in its interior. Most single sarcophagi lie lengthwise in a tomb, introduced through the passageway into the chamber. In a strangely cramped way, the Fujinoki sar- cophagus lies laterally only 80 cm from the rear wall. Its size and fit make it highly unlikely that it could have been brought in through the passageway after the structure had been completed, and so it must have been installed after the pebble floor had been laid but before the wall slabs had been erected. The large empty space in front of it raises the possibility of there having been some thought of adding at least one more sarcophagus. Most tombs with two sarcophagi, such as the Gamoike, Mizudoro, and Jingtiyama tombs in Nara prefecture, have them in file. Old drawings show that the Mise-maruyama tomb, closed throughout most of the present century, contains two. 14 One lies parallel to the back wall of the chamber and the other along a side wall. The inexact nature of the sketches makes it impossible to determine whether the sarcophagus at the rear could have been introduced into the completed tomb or whether its bulk made it necessary for the walls to be constructed around it. Pottery Sue and Haji pottery are occasionally found together in tombs of this period, but the proportion of Haji in Fujinoki seems rather high. Twelve pieces of the traditionally reddish, domestic Haji pottery were mixed indiscriminately with 47 pieces of the brownish-gray ceremonial Sue ware.15 The Haji pieces include seven pots and five takatsuki, or ceremonial pedestalled bowls. These had become more and more like the Sue takatsuki vessels with the passage 14 Gowland, pp. 142-43. ' 5 Fujinoki Kofun, pp. 3 &amp; 14.</page><page sequence="12">68 Monumenta Nipponica, 42:1 of time. Red paint still remains on many of them; one small pot is almost completely covered. Sue pottery was ceremonial from its inception, but the more pedestrian Haji had to be made more suitable for burial purposes by either emulating the Sue shape or by adding the magical property of red paint. As regards the shapes of the pottery, the proportionally large number of takatsuki (11 with lids, 9 without, and 16 loose lids) reflects the trend to pro- duce more of that ceremonial type. The Sue ranges from a sandy brown to deep gray, with many pieces discolored to brown on the sides that had been in contact with the floor. One small takatsuki, with an unperforated pedestal, is almost completely covered with a blackish ash glaze. The floor of the bowl of the largest takatsuki was paddle-stamped. If paddle-stamping appears on any of the others, it has yet to be reported. This piece and the others have long nar- row slits in the pedestals, two levels of these in the case of the smaller ones and four levels in the case of the larger ones. A few bear finely combed decorations. To judge by the considerable consistency in shape, color, and texture, almost all the Sue, with the exception of the small glazed pot, seem to have come from the same kiln. An investigation of the few unlooted tombs would be of the greatest com- parative value to determine whether the mix of Sue and Haji here is out of the ordinary. Pottery appears to have been low on the looters' priority list. Comparison may be made with the ceramics recovered from the 1934 and 1935 excavations of the Ishibutai tomb, despite its ancient plundering and the possibility that it has been open since the ninth century.16 Once the precious materials had been stolen, the pottery in the accumulating soil offered little or no attraction to the plunderers. Among the Sue pottery in Ishibutai were large pots, bowls with stands, a pair of small bottles and a big kettle with raised ridges, while among the Haji were large low bowls, trays (or shallow, low bowls), and stands. Counting the complete examples or those that could be restored, the Sue amounted to 21 and the Haji to 15, the former including two takatsuki and one bowl on a high base. Additionally, there were eight complete or partial Sue lids, but these were too fragmentary to demonstrate any fit with the vessels. Looters may be assumed to have had preference for Sue, but the ratio of the one type to the other may not be too different from that in the large tombs of the late sixth and seventh centuries. Horse-trappings The beginnings of horse-riding in Japan have been examined in the most minute way since 1967 when Egami Namio proposed his horse-rider theory to explain the creation of the Yamato state.17 This theory credited the late third- 16 Hamada, Ishibutai, pp. 31-35. 17 Egami Namio iffL , Kiba Minzoku Kokka: Nihon Kodai-shi e no Apurochi ,".MR 1n -q-7 -- CD 7 7 P- I , Chfi6 Karon-sha, 1967.</page><page sequence="13">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 69 or early fourth-century 'emperor' Sujin with leading a horse-riding group into Kyushu and inaugurating the Yamato state.

Egami's theory received rather wide popular acceptance, but a more refined archaeological and historical viewpoint indicates that horse-riding took a very different course in Japan.18 So far there is little to indicate that horses were being ridden before the fifth century. Wooden stirrups are the best piece of evidence for actual riding as they would have been of everyday use and would have had no prestige value. They appear in the earlier half of the fifth century, such as in the Yoshitake site in Fukuoka prefecture. By the second half of the century trappings begin to show up rather often in tombs, and then they become a major component of the repertory in the sixth century. As regards the sheer quantity of horse-trappings, Fujinoki exceeds all other tombs, including the remarkable Otani tomb in Wakayama.19 Otani had been a landmark in exotic grave-goods: wooden and gilt-bronze parts of a saddle, stirrups, bridle-bits, and cheek plates, flank or crupper ornaments, bells, saddle and strap buckles; and, in iron, horse armor, a horse helmet, cuirass, slat armor, helmet, swords, arrowheads, spearheads and daggers, together with farming and carpentering tools. It also contained glass beads, gold ear-pendants, small bronze mirrors, and gilt-bronze and silver belt plaques. The grave-goods of a tomb seldom consist almost exclusively of horse- trappings, but they predominate in Fujinoki. The tomb has also yielded about one thousand slats of iron armor, iron arrows and arrowheads, along with several gilt bronze ornamental pieces of uncertain use. Archaeologists sometimes speak of 'sets' of trappings and there may perhaps be more than one set in Fujinoki. A set would have to start with the most basic, fundamental pieces, such as bits, stirrups, and saddle parts, all of which are the most numerous among buried trappings. But however a set is defined, it is precisely the missing pieces from the 'basic set' that makes the trappings in Fujinoki fall short. One half of the bridle-bit and cheek-piece rig is here, and only one stirrup. And one other part-a metal edge for the saddle flap-also has no counterpart. Bits in Japan are snaffle-bits, that is, constructed of two linked sections for the mouthpiece rather than a single rod. Many trappings, including those found in Fujinoki, do not have these bits, and therefore the bit was composed of rawhide rope, as it was in many parts of Asia where metal was hard to find or costly. The piece that remains in Fujinoki has the gilt-bronze bar with end 18 There is a large amount of Japanese literature on the subject.

The decoration of the cheek plate is divided into quadrants with a spread of palmette leaves rising from below and another hanging from above. Examples recovered from numerous tombs, as well as depictions on Korean tomb models and Japanese haniwa, and in wall paintings in Chinese and Korean tombs, show that riders almost invariably used stirrups. Simple ring- shaped stirrups outnumber all other types and were always available with various modifications. But other styles were introduced and it was possible to economize by using wood to construct parts of the stirrups. Stirrups made entirely of wood, shaped like a wide, large hook, have been recovered from the marshy Iba site in Shizuoka and the Shima site in Yamagata.20 Giant trappings appear quite late in the evolution of riding gear and are regarded as status symbols. In fact, ornamental trappings or prestige gear, such as frontlets, crupper and flank ornaments, bells, elaborate strap buckles, and metal ornaments for saddle bows tend to be later additions to the reper- tory, although there are several striking exceptions. Among Fujinoki's giant trappings are parts of a characteristic sixth-century type of stirrup. Such an item is known from several other sites, but is often in such a poor state of preservation that the features are barely recognizable. The example in Fujinoki is made of a bronze frame of three slightly curved bars joined at the top. These spread out to toe size below and are connected by a triangular bar. The frame was floored by a wooden foot piece. A linked chain made the attachment to a strap over the back of the saddle. The Fujinoki stirrup is broken and large parts of the reinforcing frame are missing. The oversize trappings in Fujinoki have to be compared chiefly with material from tombs in Fukuoka, although quite a few giant-sized ones have been found elsewhere. Miyajidake, for instance, has trappings to match its colossal chambers: a huge pair of gilt-bronze pocket stirrups, two frames of gilt-bronze saddle bows (with decorations broken off), and fragments of a king-sized sword.21 These giant-size trappings were show pieces and could not possibly have been worn. Any rider trying to do so would have looked outlandish, especially in contrast to the rather small horses being ridden in Japan at the time. The large trappings, in fact, may have been intended exclusively as burial goods. The same is true for the iron horse helmet from the Otani tomb, for it is regarded as far too large for actual use. 20 Sakamoto Yoshio ; Bagu .li, Kokogaku Raiburarii 34, New Science-sha, 1985, p. 77. 21 Mori Teijiro AA&amp;A Hokubu Kyusha no Kodai Bunka IMA)tIti Ikzi4L, Meibun- sha, 1975, pp. 201-05.</page><page sequence="15">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 71 Saddle Bows The prize among the Fujinoki trappings is the gilt-bronze, arc-shaped or- naments for the wooden vertical cantles that served as a saddle. Few examples have the frame, decoration, and lower arc still attached to each other as was found in Fujinoki. Harnessing required a front bow with two buckles for the strap to pass under the neck of the horse, and a hind one with four buckles for at least a pair of straps to be looped under the tail. Both bows in Fujinoki are constructed of a heavy outer frame, a thin openwork field of decoration originally backed by a sheet of bronze, and a thicker solid arc below bearing the buckles; the backing sheet and lower arc are joined by closely spaced rivets. The rear bow is slightly larger, measuring 57 cm across and 43 cm high, com- pared with 51 cm and 41.5 cm for the front bow. Both had a special inserted middle piece; this is still intact in the rear bow, but no trace remains of it in the front. Strangely enough, the front bow has its ornamentation properly com- pleted where it would meet the middle plate and so looks as though it was designed to take it, but the decoration on the rear bow is cut off abruptly as though this plate were an afterthought. The plate in the rear bow and the lower arc in both bows are cast in the same style, lacking the delicate openwork, as they needed to be of considerably stronger material. The plate bears a rod, referred to as a handle, rooted by three legs. Rods run through the legs for attachment to the wooden saddle. The feet are encircled by lotus petals. A round ornament of dark blue glass pro- vides decorative ends and bears minute inlay gold granulations and cabochon settings in pendant teardrop shapes. Those at the very end are arrayed like the spokes of a wheel, much like the 'pinwheel' ornaments that decorated the rump of the horse. Sleeves hold the parts of the handle together over each leg. A Korean tomb has yielded a similar handle, 16 cm in length, closely matching the 18.24 cm length of this one. But the Korean example is more finely decorated and has wooden legs instead of bronze ones. Although it did not come up with a saddle, it is unlikely that the object had any other use.22 Since other bows lack this piece, it is not an essential and commonly used device to secure the ornament to the wooden saddle, although that may have been one of its uses. It probably served as a holder for the straps bearing the 'pinwheels' or some other rig ascending from the rear of the horse. Behind the buckles is a flat rod about 6.5 cm in length to attach the metal pieces to the wooden saddle, amply long for this purpose. Decoration The unit of decoration on the saddle bows is a series of hexagons of equal size, containing a variety of imaginary and real beasts, birds, a fish-like creature, 22 GB 86:2, p. 110.</page><page sequence="16">72 Monumenta Nipponica, 42:1 B Bird E Elephant P Palmette BP Bird-palmette FP Fish-palmette PB Phoenix bird D Dragon-like beast L Lion T Tiger-like beast DF Demon face MB Mythical beast</page><page sequence="17">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 73 I_~~~~~~~~~~. ... ........... ... .. .. . .. . . . . . 3.Gl-rnefon adebw ith5. m(bv) rer adl owdt 70cm(eo)</page><page sequence="18">74 Monumenta Nipponica, 42:1 and palmette patterns. The six-sided panel became identified with the tortoise- shell shape, and appears with great regularity on the backs of tortoises in Chinese and Japanese art, from which it derives its common name kikko- tsunagi-mon try, or tortoise-shell pattern. Hexagons, however, can be traced back to Near Eastern art, well before they were standardized into the Four Tutelary Deities of Taoist thought.23 For the approximate time period with which we are dealing, good examples are seen in silver inlay in iron on weapons recovered from mounded tombs. Also, there is a section of an iron saddle bow from the Suketo tomb in Ashikaga, Tochigi, bearing the pattern.24 The handle of a sword from the tomb of King Munyong of the Paekche period, who lived in the first quarter of the sixth century, is decorated with phoenixes within hexagons. As regards the layout of the hexagons, there is some bilateral cor- respondence across the arc of each bow-for instance, in the rear bow, the elephants in the third hexagon (or part thereof) from the bottom. But the slightly larger rear bow throws the balance off, suggesting that the original design was drawn up with the smaller one in mind. In which case, the frame of reference was the first full hexagon up on the left side of the front bow (T) which fits the frame perfectly, and its counterpart (MB) on the other side. On the larger bow, designed to hold more straps, the comparable hexagon on the left (FP) has no completely fitting counterpart. Many identifications of the motifs in the hexagons have been suggested. The exhibition catalog speaks of dragons, phoenixes, tigers and 'lions' (shishi), small birds and palmette patterns on the front bow, and 'animals', demon faces, phoenixes, elephants, small birds, rabbits, lions, and palmette patterns on the rear bow. Since some of the hexagons have suffered a substantial degree of corruption, the range of identifications is understandable. Also, the Han-dynasty tradition of coalescing motifs-fusing floral-cloud-mountain patterns-was still strong. The talent of Korean artisans to merge motifs may have been less pronounced than that of their Japanese counterparts, but it still existed. Numerous mirrors bearing wild hairy creatures, representing the almost limitless world of spirits, have been excavated from Japanese tombs. I find the distinctions between the quadrupeds to be very fine and have taken a conser- vative view, listing certain ones as tiger-like (T), dragon-like (D), and those that are one step beyond as mythological beasts (MB). Given the looseness of definition, I can agree with the catalog's designation of dragons, tiger, and lion, but so far I do not go along with its identification of the rabbit(s), although without the benefit of the X-ray photographs that eliminate the 23 Egami Yasushi UiE?L, Nihon no Mon'yO no Genry H 1oi1RtirfE, Nihon Keizai Shimbun-sha, 1983, pp. 1-18. 24 J.

The two elephants on the rear bow are fitted into incomplete hexagons, the one on the right side more cramped than the other. Both are long-trunked in the stolid Indo-Iranian profile style as seen in the textile material of a silk screen preserved in the Shoso-in, in which the floral patterns below include a bear, the elephant in side view, and a tree with a monkey in the branches. But the elephant on the left here, with more frame space at the top, has a kind of mane, perhaps actually floral. The other tradition for elephants in Japan is the T'ang graphic-arts style, with turned-back head and an anteater's trunk, quite humanized. The elephants decorating the Fujinoki saddle bows precede this T'ang tradition. While these figures were heralded by the media as the oldest in Japan, elephants had in fact appeared in the arts of Japan long before this. Three bronze mirrors include elephants in their decoration, two of them belonging to the fourth century and one to the fifth. The last has been above ground since the Meiji period, and the other two were excavated in 1971. The two fourth- century mirrors were found in the Shironoyama tomb, Wadayama-cho, Hyogo. In one of the circular outer bands some ten animals are placed between the knobs. Among them is a fish, frog-toad, turtle-tortoise, mythical beast, bird, and elephant looking to the right on one mirror and to the left on the other. Given its hefty proboscis, an elephant is hard to misidentify. These two mirrors have been included in the Kobayashi theory that has judged them to be part of a group of mirrors sent from a Chinese ruler to Himiko, the female shaman leading the kingdom of Yamatai.25 If true, such mirrors could have bypassed Korea completely. The other mirror is one of seven dug up out of the Kutsugawa Kurumazuka tomb in Joyo, Kyoto prefecture, a place south of Uji. Along with floral patterns, many of the creatures have a familiar ring: phoenix, lion, rabbit, monkey, a demon face, mythical beast, and elephant.26 Two demon faces balance each other in the hexagons on the rear bow. Begin- ning with the early dynastic bronzes and running through Han, demon faces in East Asian art always seem to retain a strong Chinese flavor. The category of oni in Japanese lore is a large one, embracing spirits associated with tombs, temples, and residences. After the early sword handles, the roof tiles from the seventh century became the chief vehicle for oni, a creature that was able to reverse its role as an evil spirit in a pre-Taoist and Taoist context to a benign one to fulfill its Buddhist duties as a guardian. These grimacing, puffy faces are tusked and toothy. Eyes stretch their sockets and hair swirls wildly behind. They are more effective in isolated settings, not just one of many, and es- pecially where they are among full-bodied quadrupeds. 25 GB 86:3, p. 157, &amp; 86:4, p. 93. 26 GB 86:4, p. 72.</page><page sequence="20">76 Monumenta Nipponica, 42:1 The Japanese received two sorts of floral patterns on which they made varia- tions through the eighth century: the palmette of Iranian origin, as far as Asia was concerned, and what is called karakusa WA, or Chinese grass, an uniden- tified plant of considerable diversity. The flattened, formalized palmette in its simplest form is like a stylized fleur-de-lis. The karakusa is a florid, lively, rhythmically flowing pattern, vaguely approximating nature. The saddle-flap strip has a free form of palmette, like those in the saddle bows, more typical of its use for the thinner bronze ornaments. It is slightly more stiff on the flat doughnut-like object and somewhat more so, when en- larged, on the cheek plate. The pattern around the outer frame of the bows is karakusa, with one report saying that it includes eleven animals. The demon depicted under the handle of the rear bow is a common type of personified nature spirit, seen on bronze mirrors, in Korean and Chinese tomb paintings and reliefs, and moving through Japanese art into such types as gongen *R. the mountain spirit in later times. It is a violently active humanoid, with its head in the upper right looking leftward, drastically foreshortened torso, and a sword in the right hand and an axe in the left. Tusks protrude from the open mouth, eyes and forehead bulge, and hair blows in the wind. Its jacket is frilled below the elbows and the pantaloons above the knees, which are turned back at impossible angles. The decoration of the lower arc is variously illustrated in drawings in newspapers and popular magazines as serpentine, twisted creatures, but only the legs can be fully identified in the material available to me. It has the unrepressed power of the anthropomorphic figure under the handle, but does not appear tortoise-like as the catalog suggests.27 As far as one can tell, the arrangement of creatures within the hexagons does not seem to produce a mandala or any special magical arrangement, however much we may search for zodiacal significance, the presence of the Four Tutelary Deities, or some other relationship. Even if we construe one of the mythical beasts as an entwined tortoise and snake, the symbol of the north, and interpret a bird, dragon, and tiger for south, east, and west, the group does not make sense unless it can be seen as properly disposed in four opposing directions, and that is not the case here. The eighteen (the catalog says seventeen) leaf-shaped hanging flank or crup- per ornaments are gilt-bronze, bronze-backed, gilt-studded, and done in methodical linear surface detail of line hatching. A pair of confronted phoenixes stands toward the foot of the ornaments, a palmette growing be- tween and spreading into three clusters of leaves at the top. The handsome, elegant sweep of the feathers and floral motifs is the Chinese touch to the Near Eastern symmetry that was made more rigid by its transmission through 27 Fujinoki Kofun, p. 7.</page><page sequence="21">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 77 -CZ t I 4. Gilt-bronze rump ornament, ca. 10 cm high. Iranian textiles. Japan has all of the motifs, and they are found on objects ranging from sword handles in tombs and the end of a clay sarcophagus in the Hirafuku tomb in Okayama to many examples of dyed textiles in the Shoso-in. If the Fujinoki find had been made in Korea, the presence of the decorative rump pieces, here called 'pinwheels', would surely have indicated a person of very high rank. Few horses in wall paintings have them, and none when hunt- ing. These are parade and battle ornaments, worn only by a select few. The number of pinwheels, thirty-four of them, in the Fujinoki tomb is in itself astonishing. This is exceeded only by the forty-one in the ritual sites of Okinoshima, but in this latter case they are believed to be an accumulation of two centuries or more. Some five other sites in Japan have yielded them, but in ones and twos. They come from scattered locations, for instance, the Watanuki Kannonyama tomb in Takasaki (Gumma), the Shizuhanayama tomb in Shizuoka prefecture, and the Maruyama tomb in Osaka.28 By and large the early examples have a rising bar that is twisted into the shape of a cross. Silla tombs have their share of these. The later ones are made in sections and fitted together, as is the case for the Fujinoki pinwheels. The lat- ter are not very large. They average up to 10 cm high and had (some now lost) as many as ten 'spokes'. The domed-base piece flattens out around the edge to 28 Tajima Katsurao WBA-??3, Nihon no Kodai Iseki, 17, Gumma Seibu HF | 17, .

The most sophisticated of other examples, from Okinoshima and Kannonyama tomb, have a lobed dome piece resembling a lotus. Okinoshima is the forbidding shrine island, some 77 km north-northwest of Fukuoka, where seafearing people left offerings under large overhanging rocks.29 Pinwheels have been found in two places there and have four, five, six, eight, and ten spokes, although most have five or six. These all have upward turning spokes terminating in loops for suspending leaf-shaped pendants. Three have the lobed dome piece and a smaller, flower-shaped flat plate like a washer. Most are a rather simple structural type. As for the Fujinoki pinwheels, the pieces were made separately and then assembled. The stem is capped, with a high ridge like a simulated rope about halfway down its length. The spokes are cast in one piece around a central hole. Below is a hollow tube, probably merely to improve the appearance, and below that the supporting dome. A piece looking like a washer was used on the underside of the leather strap. Nothing painted in Korean tombs or in clay models looks precisely like these. There is a grander flourish to them in Korea, which may perhaps be ar- tistic license, but is also partly due to the fact that the perishable materials in- volved have disappeared. The Tomb of Three Chambers _ a Koguryd tomb in Tung-kou, has armored men on armored horses in combat. One is grandly plumed. Another kind known in Korea can be seen on the east wall of the Twin Pillar Tomb 5AMJ* of the fifth or sixth century in south P'yongan pro- vince. In this case, a large hollow curving bronze rod is mounted behind the saddle. One of these was found in a site on Okinoshima and another among the relics of the Asuka-dera that were buried in 596 and excavated in 1955. Interestingly enough, the temple's relics include armor and beads, and are in other respects much like the grave-goods of tombs of the time. A wall in the Tokhungri ?AT tomb, Kogury6, dated to 408, bears four levels of figures, most of whom are on horseback. Eleven armored horses can be counted on the topmost row and a similar line on the lowest one. Other horses on rows between are not armored. Rump plumes are seen on the two lead horses in the top row only.30 This would seem to indicate that only a few men were qualified to display this ornament. The crowning example is a fragmentary ceiling section on the west side in the Armored Horse Tomb aWW. The walking king is pictured on the left wearing a high crown and flared plume above. He is followed by an attendant, an in- 29 Munakata Jinja Fukk6 Kiseikai 7rcltO J , M R Okinoshima Munakata Jinja Okitsu-gfi Saishi Iseki P v ,tgPtit e, Yoshikawa Kobunkan, 1958, pp. 138-47. 30 KCokuri Bunka-ten AIXILSc, Kokuri Bunkaten Jikko Iinkai, p. 33 (n.d., but the ex- hibition was held in 1986).</page><page sequence="23">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 79 5.

The openwork ornamental strip in Fujinoki was used to decorate the outer edge of the saddle flap and it extended along the upper edge and down only a short way. Any lower and it might have been damaged by the boots and stir- rups. It is made of thin gilt-bronze and fitted with grooved frames, the frames riveted at the corners and where the arc connects in the middle. The decoration is flat, exclusively floral, and appears to be quite unembellished. It has the remarkable length of 88.3 cm and runs 29.4 cm vertically. In most cases in paint- ings and in clay models the length of this flap conforms closely to the distance between the saddle-bows. If this were the case here, the saddle would be huge, some 88 cm in length. There are two Silla clay vessels made to look like a horse and rider in the National Museum in Seoul, each with a large spout and a large bowl-shaped funnel behind the saddle. The flap is considerably wider than the saddle, suggesting that this is the type for which the Fujinoki ornament was made. Those funnel-shaped ornaments were perhaps inspired by plume holders. The nine gilt-bronze objects shaped somewhat like shoes would seem at first to belong with the horse-trappings, such as the hanging pendants or frontlets, 31 Kim Jeong-hak !&amp;V,-, Kankoku B''utsu Zensha WAIM 4A 4, Hekiga Ad, Dowa Shuppan, Seoul, 1974, p. 77.</page><page sequence="25">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 81 7.

At 15.4 cm in length they would ordinarily be rather large, but larger flank or- naments do exist. They are excellent work, but with rather few rivets around the edge they are clearly not intended for the hard use for which most of the trappings were made. There is, in fact, simply no place to hang them on a horse. The six that I could study have much similarity and at least some of the decorated parts were produced in the same molds. A crested, open-mouthed, long-tongued dragon is interwoven with palmette stems and flowers, its body and legs merging with the foliage. Here and elsewhere tiny dark glass balls are inserted for eyes. Occupant Finally, to return to the occupant of the tomb and the possible date of his burial. According to one writer, the person buried in the Fujinoki tomb is unlikely to have been a member of the Kashiwade clan, because the tomb is dated to the middle of the sixth century and the major power in the area at that time was either the Heguri or the Yamanobe. The nature of the grave-goods suggests the possibility that he was a noted soldier.32 Kuroiwa Jtgo believes that the tomb was the property of Mononobe no Okoshi, Mononobe no Moriya's father, in view of the presence of so many horse-trappings that he regards as a patent association with Silla.33 He notes that much help from Paekche continued to arrive until 560, the 21st year of Emperor Kimmei's reign, but that there was only one subsequent mission and, against normal precedent, no one came over to lament at the time of the emperor's funeral. The Soga connection with Paekche was close. The 32 Mansurii Nara soshite Kyoto-Osaka -v v ~9-~3A -) LC A I, *P, Nara Bunka Kanko Shuppan, 10, 1986, p. 33. 33 GB 86:2, p. 112.</page><page sequence="26">82 Monumenta Nipponica, 42:1 Mononobe, contending for power at the court, sided with Silla. Moriya's strength was centered in the Yuge region, that is, between Osaka and Ikaruga, after Okoshi died, sometime after the middle of the century. Silla had repaid Okoshi with extravagant gifts. Seeing their power slipping at court, the Soga brought the contention to a climax by taking on the Mononobe in the field, knowing well that their rivals were professional soldiers. But the Mononobe were roundly defeated in the battle of Mt Shigi and, reduced to slavery, vanished from the scene. Kuroiwa's theory raises the obvious question: the burial place of the leader of the defeated Mononobe clan was no secret, so why was it not fair game for the victors? Katsube Akio theorizes that the trappings date to just before the middle of the sixth century, during the transition stage from the round stirrup to the pocket stirrup, and that they were deposited with their owner about fifty years later, as indicated by the pottery typology. He sees the composite character of the trappings and their decoration as coming only from Paekche; Silla would not have been the source.34 An accurate identification of the creature under the saddle bow handle may be the key to understanding the meaning of the saddle objects. Katsube rejects the theory that it is Hososhi, Ch. Fang-hsiang-tai iNgfk, a mock spirit that wears a bearskin, holds a shield and sword, and leads funeral processions, because this creature does none of these things. Perhaps it should be identified with the war god Ch'ih-ch'uan (J. Shiyfi) :iAt, a legendary figure in China. Katsube arrives at the view that only in Paekche was there such a cultural melting pot-mixed techniques, mixed motifs, glass inlay and gold filigree- and the person who received these goods had a close Paekche connection. He was most likely Kashiwade no Omi Katabuko W father of one of Prince Shotoku's wives. Another view supporting a Paekche origin is advanced by Machida Akira, who has examined hexagons in China, Korea, and Japan, and concludes that the Fujinoki objects are most similar to southern Chinese and Paekche material, specifically grave-goods from the tomb of King Munyong; they are not like those of north China, Kogury6, or Silla. The Fujinoki items were made by Chinese or Koreans with southern Chinese training, and the time was close to 529 (sic), the date of Munyong's death. Machida downplays the rank of the tomb's occupant, however, noting that the internal stone structure is no larger than that of others in the Yamato region and therefore Fujinoki is not the tomb of such a powerful ruler.35 Priest Yamamoto Hojun Septe, of Ango-in in Asuka, has pointed out that two stories appearing in books on Prince Shotoku-Joggu Taishi Shuiki Lrt if 34 GB 86:5, p. 109. 35 GB 86:5, p. 103.</page><page sequence="27">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 83 Wag2 by the Kamakura-period priest Hokfi ip of Horyfiji, and Taishi-den GyokurinshO S3TfTE# by the Muromachi-period priest Kunkai 4Ji!. They describe how Soga no Umako transfered Buddhist relics from his home to the new temple Hokoji (or Asuka-dera), where they were deposited under the pole of the pagoda in the construction ceremonies. Four groups of objects were car- ried in the procession: a statue of a white elephant; drum(s), bell(s), and a long hanging (ban M) for a temple pillar; an image of a large (presumably) fabulous bird; and Hososhi, the leader of the funeral procession, a 'demon' wearing a bear skin, described as holding a harpoon and shield, glaring out of four eyes. During the ceremony, according to the old texts, Umako and about a hundred attendants wore Paekche clothes, much to the enjoyment of the crowd.36 The fact that the elephant and bird images were exhibited and the leader was prob- ably a masked and costumed individual playing the part of an exorcising demon, seems too coincidental not to have a direct bearing on the subjects of the saddle bow. Emperor Sushun I go back to reconsidering Emperor Sushun as the occupant of the tomb. Sushun was the twelfth child of Emperor Kimmei, the so-called thirty-second emperor, and succeeded Emperor Yomei. He is said to have ruled in the palace at Kurahashi from the Eighth Month of 587. According to Nihon Shoki, he was assassinated when he threatened the independence of the Soga family. Sushun detested Soga no Umako and connived to eliminate him. Umako quickly had the emperor killed by a member of the Aya family. The Sushun chapter in Nihon Shoki concludes with the emperor's burial in the imperial tomb on the hill of Kurahashi.37 In Kojiki, the terse statements concerning the emperor constitute the second last paragraph of the work. It says that Hatsu- sebe no Waka Saki, posthumously known as Sushun, lived in the Shibagaki palace at Kurahashi and ruled for four years. His mausoleum is on the mound of Kurahashi.38 Kurahashi is identified with the place of the same name today in the Sakurai area. Ikenobe, wherd Sushun's predecessor Yomei had his palace, lies a few miles west of it. Interestingly enough, for both Yomei and Empress Suiko, who succeeded Sushun, there are statements to the effect that their remains were transferred after a first interment-in the case of Yomei, from near the border of Lake Iware to Shinaga, and for Suiko, from the mound of Onu to Shinaga. But for Sushun, once he was buried, there is no further reference. Sushun is so closely identified with Kurahashi that it seems to be forcing the case to associate him with Ikaruga. But the following explanation is possible. 36 GB 86:2, p. 113. 37 William G. Aston, tr., Nihongi, 4th edi- tion, Tuttle, 1978, 2, pp. 112-20. 38 Basil H.

One reason why Prince Shotoku selected Ikaruga for the site of his palace and later his temple was to repay his debt to the kami of Mt Shigi. Their sphere of influence included Ikaruga. They were favorable toward Buddhism and Sushun had led the imperial line into a new era. He had a personal stake in the victory. Prince Shotoku built his palace at Ikaruga and around 607 added a temple nearby as a memorial to his father. The territory, said to have been dominated by the Kashiwade family, was friendly to the Soga. One of Prince Shotoku's wives was a Kashiwade. Sushun's mother, Oane no kimi, was the daughter of Soga no Iname. The Soga influence ranged loosely from Sakurai to Asuka and northwest to Ikaruga, and included Shinaga just west of Mt Nijo. While it is sometimes argued that Prince Shotoku relocated in Ikaruga to escape Soga influence, to have done so effectively he would have had to distance himself to the point of becoming politically ineffective. As for Sushun, his remains stayed well within Soga territory, whether at Ikaruga or Sakurai. At least one archaeologist believes a better choice could have been made for Sushun's tomb. The one ascribed to him is a rather lonely mound about three kilometers southeast of Sakurai Station in the area still named Kurahashi. It has been suggested that a more plausible mound could have been chosen for him in the vicinity of Sakurai.39 Historically, Fujinoki was for long identified with Sushun, perhaps the most poorly explained emperor in early Japanese history. He died in some mysterious way in 592. The man buried in the Fujinoki tomb must have been a shrewd politician in foreign affairs, playing both sides of the street. The grave- goods are an interesting mix, although such blends are not uncommon in Japan. Most of the objects came from Paekche, although the oversize ones were probably presents from solicitous officials in Silla. The tomb chamber and passageway are of 'imperial' size. As a matter of fact, when the chamber and passageway are considered together, the interior is larger than that of any tomb at present associated with a ruler. KoJiki maintains its usual blunt style when referring to Sushun, but Nihon Shoki, which is normally far more informative, is oddly oblique in regard to him. The ancient editors of Nihon Shoki packaged each reign neatly, thereby providing a series of natural links in the chain. They give the genealogy of an emperor, the palace he occupied, the place of his death, and the location of his tomb. But the text hedges on several points when dealing with Sushun. Nihon Shoki notes that he was the twelfth child of Kimmei and that his mother was a 39 Harashima Reiji iOLI, 0-kimi to chart 12.

Soga. His palace was built at Kurahashi (although the text does not say that he took up residence there). The Soga conspired to kill him, and he was assassinated by a man named Koma, a person of Korean background. In most cases Nihon Shoki writers seem to enjoy describing how such killings took place, but here they are silent on this point. The account implies that Sushun was killed and buried on the same day,40 that is, the 5th year, Eleventh Month, 3rd day (how could the writers have known the exact day and not the other details?). On this day, the account con- tinues, the emperor was buried in the misasagi on the hill of Kurahashi. Since 40 Nihongi, p. 119.</page><page sequence="30">86 Monumenta Nipponica, 42:1 dead rulers had a 'temporary' burial, followed, often months later, by a final burial, this version is patently absurd. But it may account for the slim possibil- ity that Sushun actually had no burial, as some scholarly books dealing with tomb archaeology omit his Sakurai/Kurahashi tomb from their maps. It may in fact be nothing more than a natural knoll. One should notice that most of Sushun's immediate predecessors and suc- cessors, with the exception of Jomei, who was also a stake-holder, were buried at Shinaga (present-day Taishi-cho) just over the mountain in Osaka prefec- ture. Whether the next sequence of events was trumped up or not, it suited the in- terests of the Soga to dispose of the murderer. Koma, who was a member of the Yamato Aya family, struck up a liaison with Kawakami no Iratsume, daughter of Umako and one of Sushun's widows. When this was discovered he was eliminated. Sushun was supposed to be a puppet in the view of the Soga, but he stock- piled weapons and made threatening remarks. He was, in fact, an aberration and embarrassment to the system. At sixty-eight he is said to have been the oldest person to ascend the throne. But apparently the Soga could not wait. Sushun's action in defeating the Mononobe had given him the 'right' to the throne, and much of the chapter on Sushun in Nihon Shoki is taken up with his securing this position. Large missions came from Paekche in 588 with presents, relics, and specialists to train Japanese in temple construction. Umako started the Asuka- dera by tearing down an ancestral home on the site. Inspectors were sent out to check the frontiers. Generals were appointed, and troops were mustered and moved to north Kyushu to protect Japanese interests in south Korea. Sushun was certainly not inactive, but the events surrounding his death are obscured, intentionally or otherwise, and the record in Nihon Shoki is neither credible nor explicit. In fact, before they themselves were assassinated in 645, the Soga tried to burn the records. Late-Tokugawa and Meiji scholars making tomb assignments were much influenced by the earlier studies of Motoori Norinaga and others, whose work became known as the Kokugaku, or National Learning School. They lent particular credence to Kojiki, viewing Nihon Shoki more ambivalently. Their studies gave validity to the ancient histories and became the basis for many tomb designations. The Kokugaku writers appear to have followed the formula probably because they were in fact uninformed, but perhaps also because a traditional cover-up was in order. Ikaruga was in the lee of Mt Shigi, the site of the most important event in Sushun's reign and a turning point in Japanese history, opening the way for the development of Buddhism. Whether he was a willing participant or not may be immaterial; by virtue of his presence, he must receive some credit for the events of his reign.</page><page sequence="31">KIDDER: The Fujinoki Tomb 87 This history should have been among the reasons why Prince Shotoku chose Ikaruga for his palace and temple. I suspect that he honored Emperor Sushun by building his palace and temple in the vicinity of the late emperor's tomb. The opening of the Fujinoki sarcophagus may not complete the research, but it will at least allow progress in that direction. Even if the sarcophagus turns out to be empty, that very fact will have to be explained.</page></plain_text>
