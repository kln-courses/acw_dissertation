UCKO University College London As far as I know the last lecture to be given on the topic of penis confinement took place in about 1537. Fabricius discussed 'infibulation before his class .. .. showed them a fibula and demonstrated before his pupils how, when it was applied, sexual intercourse became impossible' (Dingwall 1925: 44). I must make it clear that no such contortionist demonstration will be attempted here tonight. Instead I hope to discuss generally some of the problems involved in any study of material culture and at the same time I hope to explore various aspects of a particular example of human ingenuity-the penis sheath.t The study of material culture As most of us are aware, the climate of anthro- pological opinion in this country has tended in the recent past towards fission rather than fusion; in more and more university departments the classic subjects making up an anthropological degree have drawn away from each other. In most cases it is the social anthropologists, preoccupied with their relationship to sociology, who are in the positions of power and to whom belong the burdens of directing future developments of academic anthropology. For a considerable time now the study of the material cultures of small-scale societies has been primarily confined to museum studies; the study of the material cultures of past peoples has become the field of archaeology, a subject which is now considered to have its own discipline and which has achieved independence in many universities in this country. I do not want to spend time reviewing the history and causes of these developments but I do want to stress the general result of the present academic position. In remarkably few university departments of anthropology in Britain is it thought necessary to focus attention on the artefacts of the peoples whose social organisation, and occasionally whose physical make-up, are deemed essential knowledge for the undergraduate student. Museums of ethnography and archaeology, once the pride of some lucky univer- sity departments, have become academic embarrass- ments-their futures unclear and the space that they occupy coveted. In short, despite the works of such authors as Malinowski (e.g. 1922: 105-224; 1931) the study of material culture has in general become the poor handmaiden of other aspects of anthropology and its methods and aims are in some way considered less sophisticated than are those of modern social anthropology. This present situation is, to my mind, as dangerous and as much in need of urgent review as any other in the anthropological field. The essential difference between studies of past cultures and modern ethno- graphic ones is that for the former material culture is often the major data available for study, whereas for the latter material culture is just one aspect of what can be observed in the field or gathered from infor- mants. One result of this has been for much of the ethnographic study of material culture to become concerned with ordering and morphological classi- fication, whereas archaeological study, besides directing its attention more and more to field investigations, has made great progress in refining concepts and designing new analytical methods with which to squeeze all possible information from inanimate axes and pot- sherds. The rather static museum studies of material culture ignore much of the sophistication and detail of available anthropological data, while most social anthropologists nevertheless leave this area of investigation to their museum colleagues and con- centrate instead on theoretical abstraction. In so doing, and by their tacit acceptance that archaeology is an independent discipline and no longer simply a particular method of approach dependent on excavation, anthropologists condemn the few remains that we have of many peoples to sterile disintegration in museums. As more and more 'primitive' societies become part of 'literate empires' so the social anthro- pologist is becoming more and more preoccupied with 'complex' societies, peasant communities and urbanisa- tion. He will soon be leaving the one tangible evidence of 'primitive' societies to the curiosity of museum visitors, to art historians and to archaeologists; he will have failed in the task of analysing cultures as inte- grated economic, technological, social and political systems. The material recorded by ethnographers will simply have become more 'archaeological' material- more 'type fossils', analysable only by archaeological statistical methods; and the pendulum will have swung. As Clarke has recently put it: '. . . with the current demise of ethnology in academic circles it is interesting to notice that archaeology is taking on many of the tasks and problems formerly left to the ethnologist' (Clarke 1968: 13). As it is inevitable that the small- scale societies will continue to disappear, so it is all the more important that they should be studied now. At the moment it is still possible to claim that to be a good prehistorian one must also be an anthropologist but in the future it may well be that to be an anthro- pologist, as opposed to a sociologist, one will have to be an archaeologist (e.g. Ucko 1968: 420; 1969: 264). It is the major aim of this paper to suggest that at this time when social anthropologists are concerned 27</page><page sequence="7">with redefining the aims of their subject it is vital that they should recognise the rightful place of studies of material culture within anthropology. To my mind the strange assumption that an expert on primitive pottery or weaving is somehow less of an anthro- pologist than the expert on plural societies is a dangerous and illfounded one, which holds out little hope for the future development of anthropology as an integrated academic subject. As I hope to show here, the study of human artefacts can act as a bridge between most other aspects of anthropology; in this sense it should be a central interest of any anthro- pological department. Any subject which can provide common ground for the varying and disparate interests of anthropologists, and which at the same time commands the interests of the public, must be considered invaluable at this time. No one can tell at the present moment where the various interests of sociology, human biology and archaeology will lead the integrative subject of anthropology, but acontinued or increasing emphasis on the relation of environ- ment to culture seems certain. A central basis in material culture from which all these interests can develop can only benefit the whole subject. To be central is often to be ignored and it is uniquely to the credit of the Royal Anthropological Institute that a lecture exists whose content is specifically decreed to be non-sociological and which is nevertheless spon- sored by anthropologists. In a recent article in Man it has been argued that the present lack of interest in material culture is primarily due to a change in fashion (Heider 1969: 379); I suggest, rather, that the social anthropologist's lack of interest in this subject is primarily due to his ignorance of what such studies are, or at least should be, all about. Classically, studies of material culture and primitive technology have been involved with several different aspects of man's adaptation to his environment, analysis of the processes of innovation and diffusion, and the understanding of the techniques employed in the manufacture of cultural artefacts. From here studies of material culture proceed to analysis of the function of the artefacts and/or classification of these artefacts, a classification based most usually on morphology but sometimes on function. Most active work by ethnographers on ma- terial culture has in the recent past been based on museum studies and their classifications have been primarily exercises in ordering material. Previously, however, and currently as far as the material culture of past populations is concerned, the primary aim of such classifications is to study distributions with a view to understanding culture history and culture contacts. I make no apology for mentioning these methods and aims nor for considering them to be vital aspects of anthropological investigation. I will, however, seek to show in the context of penis sheaths that such analysis should lead to a consideration of a much wider range of anthropological topics. Before I embark on detailed discussion of penis sheaths I should like to stress two particular points. First, that my aims in this paper are strictly limited; I wish primarily to indicate how wide and multifaceted any useful study of a human artefact must be. This limited aim almost inevitably implies that various parts of this paper will appear obvious and perhaps simplistic to different sections of its readers; I can only hope that the general picture resulting from a study of penis sheaths will be to some extent novel. The second point that I would like to stress is that this study is not based on any new fieldwork, and the nature of the literature is such that much of the information which would be needed for reasonable analysis of myth or for reasonably based inductions regarding culture history simply does not exist. I will therefore be able to give little of the social, political or economic background which would be required for any satisfactory social anthropological study. There are large gaps in the literature and, furthermore, some of what does exist is contradictory even on quite specific points of fact. It is remarkable, for example, that Miklucho-Maclay (1878: 113) maintains that the inhabitants of Taui Island in the Admiralties urinate through a small hole in their penis shell, whereas Thilenius (1902: 129) claims that they are always removed for this purpose; similarly the explicit claim that the Unkia of New Guinea urinate through their penis gourds has been challenged because of the observation that not all the gourds used have the end cut off (Karius &amp; Champion 1928: 95, 101). Perhaps even more disturbing is the fact that the most detailed statements regarding social status and the wearing of particular sheath types are found in a recent popular book on New Guinea. It is said about an unspecified tribe in an 'unknown valley' that the women have exclusive control of the cultivation of gourds and that it is they who choose the gourds and fix them correctly on to the penis. These gourds 'must not be a fraction of an inch too long . .. the wives of the men who have the biggest gourds . . . swell with pride as they measure up their husband's against the lesser fry . . . I shall always remember the admiring glances of a young husband as his wife looked at him with that ambiguity common to all women, but here you could hardly tell whether he was admiring his ... gourd or was gazing lovelornly into her eyes, for they were both in the same place. His gourd was so large that it extended to the face' (Davis 1969: 164-5). Almost every specific point in this account is contra- dicted in more serious literature. The deplorable state of much of the literature2 can, I think, be largely explained by the lack of interest in material culture of many of the social anthropologists who have occasion- ally merely recorded the existence of such, to my mind, striking penial appendages. It is certainly clear that the literature on penis sheaths, despite its interest for those concerned with economic anthropology, with primitive art, with status organisation and with medical anthropology, is largely unknown. Another 28</page><page sequence="8">of my aims is, therefore, to review and to attempt to order a large, scattered and confusing literature. The one positive aspect is the excellence of many of our museum collections which include a wide, although sadly neglected,3 variety of specimens of penis sheaths from different areas of the world. Penis sheaths. The first important step is to define the area of investigation in this paper and, perhaps surprisingly, this is by no means an easy step to take; nor is it one without important consequences for it immediately brings to the fore a distinction to which I will return several times in this paper; the distinction between morphology and function. One dictionary definition of a sheath is that it confines something, in the context of this paper the glans penis; in this sense all clothing of the lower part of the body could be called a sheath but a second dictionary definition states that a sheath is a close-fitting cover. The starting point of this investigation will be a close fitting cover of the glans penis, but an immediate refinement must be acknowledged; not all sheaths are necessarily manufactured objects although the methods of fastening them must involve the use of an artefact. As will be seen later in some detail, some people 'sheath' the glans with the prepuce which is fastened, in many different ways, so as to confine the glans penis with a tight fitting cover. These practices, when they include manufactured artefacts securing the end of the prepuce, will all be included for analysis in this paper. My initial starting point is thus primarily a non- morphological one, but one which depends on a particular function, sheathing the glans penis. That I am able to start from function is the virtue of dealing with ethnography; the prehistorian who studies material culture must, except in the most rare cases, start from a purely morphological basis. This is a most important point for, as Steward has argued (1954: 55-6), it is at the functional and not the morphological level that cross-cultural comparisons are at their most useful. Nevertheless it is important to realise that my narrow functional definition implies nothing with regard to the wider functional meaning (or meanings) of the particular practices. In other words although the function of all these artefacts is to confine the glans penis, this definition does not define the context of use. It can include everyday wear as well as special accoutrements which confine the glans penis during sexual intercourse. However this restricted functional definition does have several necessary morphological concomitants; the sheath must be shaped so as to cover the whole penis (i.e. it must be roughly cylindrical) or it must be shaped so as to fit directly on to the glans (i.e. globular, cubic or pyramidal), or it must be designed to fasten the end of the prepuce (i.e. clamp, ring, or thread). Arbi- trarily, perhaps, all general covers, binding, painting or even tattooing4 of the pubic area which are without special elements designed especially to confine the glans or the whole penis, are omitted from this enquiry.5 Thus shell plaques and even whole shells which serve simply as hangings in front of the penis are not included in this study for they do not conform to the whole meaning of my initial definition;6 shells into which the penis is actually placed are, of course, included.7 Possibly the main rationale for the exclusion of general pubic coverings and the inclusion only of techniques involving confinement of the glans penis is to introduce a further element into this study, namely the important distinction between penis and glans penis on the one hand and scrotum on the other. Whereas in many small-scale societies it is either the penis or the glans penis which is singled out for sheathing practices, the scrotum in the vast majority of cases is left unconfined and open to view.8 Clearly this further functional restriction has morphological implications for the main element under analysis here is a penis/glans penis cover, and specifically such. Inclusion of any scrotum covering is secondary, and only occurs when it forms part of a penis sheath. Function and morphology. Recent argument by those studying material culture has centred on the problem of whether analysis should be based exclusively on function or morphology (e.g. Tippett 1968). To my mind such extreme positions are not required at the present time; material culture can be studied from two complementary starting points- first, as part of a larger cultural activity and second as a system of its own (see Clarke 1968: 649). The fact that this investigation starts from a functional basis with restricted morphological implications makes any morphological pattern which may emerge from cross- cultural investigation, whether synchronic or dia- chronic, all the more worthwhile and possibly significant (and this view is, I would maintain, valid despite the views of such authorities as Steward (1954: 54) who have over-simplified and over-stressed the superficial differences between morphology and function). If there is one thing which distinguishes the study of material culture from most other aspects of anthropological investigation, it is that its data are manufactured objects, the result of some technological process, and I therefore make no apology for insisting on the potential importance of morphological studies. The essential quality of material culture studies is that re-analysis is possible at all times; in other words, with changing attitudes and interests the basic material can be re-investigated at any time without the charge being levelled, so common in the social anthropological field, that the societies themselves will have changed considerably between the time of first recording and subsequent re-investigation. It is at this point that the artificiality of the present academic division between the study of present day and past material culture becomes evident, for the qualities of the material under consideration are exactly the same in both cases and the methodology and many of the aims coincide. Despite all the sophistication of modern analysis of prehistory the essential tenet of any material culture investigation is, and must be, 29</page><page sequence="9">that the morphology of artefacts is a reality which reflects some cultural situation and that this level of social reality is no more or less meaningful than any other that may be discerned by analysis. It is the job of those who study material culture, whether in an ethnographic or in an archaeological context, to try to establish how social and cultural realities are reflected in the material evidence (see Deetz 1967: 7, 11, 52). To dismiss the importance of morphology by stressing that the same morphological club type may serve very different purposes (Tippett 1968: 76) is to ignore the main point and fascination of material culture studies. In the words of Clarke (1968: 120, 364) 'artefacts . . . embody information-congealed information about the orientation of a culture's perceptor, information about the actions integrated in their fabrication, information about their intent, and information about the "sensory" level of the culture's technology . .. artefacts represent coded information of great variety and capable of direct interpretation or misinterpretation by individuals both inside and outside the manufacturing culture . . . [Material] culture maps a real entity that really existed . . . that this entity is not identical to the historical, the political, the linguistic or racial entities does not make it the less real or important . .. the entities in all these fields are equally real, equally arbitrary and simply different' (and see also Ford 1954: 47). Morphological con- tinuity or discontinuity will sometimes correspond to functional continuity (e.g. Tippett 1968) and dis- continuity but not necessarily so; where such correspondence is not found the morphological status of the investigation is as deserving of the anthro- pologists' interest as is the functional situation. It is simply not good enough to dismiss the importance of morphological studies in the terms adopted recently by Tippett (1968: 25) who maintains that mor- phological classification, where it does not coincide with functional analysis, is simply a reflection of over- objectivity on the part of the modern western observer. In terms of the clubs, mentioned above, it is as pertinent to ask why the same club types are used in certain different contexts and why different club types are used in the same contexts, as it is to concentrate on function and context to the exclusion of morphology. It is for this reason that social anthropologists cannot simply dismiss the sophistication and results of some attempts at classifying material objects by maintaining that all this evidence could be obtained from observa- tion of actual practice or from informants. Nor, for the same reason, can one simply maintain, despite all the archaeologists' classifications and typologies, that they can never reach a position more advanced than that from which the ethnographer starts his observa- tion. These different levels of analysis inherent in the study of any material culture should not appear strange to those working in social anthropological fields. Cross-cultural analysis. There are many people who do not clothe themselves at all; some are content with a hip/waist girdle. Many peoples cover themselves in substantial artefacts, varying from the fully tailored outfit of the Eskimo or the robeS of the Muslim Hausa to the few skins of the Tierra del Fuegians. Penis or glans confinement by means of some sort of sheathing device occurs among certain groups of people irres- pective of the amount, or nature, of other clothing used by them. Thus, although the majority of peoples to be discussed wear nothing or little else besides the penis sheaths, some combine their use with headdress, loin cloth and elaborate clothing. Since European contact, several cases occur where their use accom- panies the wearing of shirts and even, as will be seen later, of trousers. Despite several statements in the literature, the use of penis sheaths is not confined to New Guinea. In fact penis or glans sheaths are, or were, found also in Africa, various Pacific islands, North and South America and the Himalayas (see pl. 18) (e.g. Mills 1926: pl. 35; Haimendorf 1947: 110, 118, 120; 1955: pl. 29). From representations it appears that some forms of penis confinement were used in ancient Egypt, north and east Africa, Minoan Crete and the Cyclades; actual discoveries confirm their existence in ancient Egypt and suggest their possible use in some parts of the prehistoric Near East (see Hole et al. 1969: 232-3). Representations and literature show that they were in use in ancient Greece and in Etruscan and Roman Italy. In more modern times, the use of codpieces from the late fourteenth to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth centuries is well known. Certain isolated cases of glans confinement may have existed among the modern Eskimo and the Japanese. Before looking at this distribution in some more detail, there is yet another important theoretical consideration to be kept in mind. It has recently been claimed, admittedly in a rather different context, that it is to Levi-Strauss's 'lasting credit that . . . it . . . is once again intellectually respectable to indulge in broad cross-cultural com- parisons, especially in areas where sophisticated anthropologists have been evading comparison ever since the days of Sir James Frazer' (Leach 1967: xvi). Leach in this statement ignores the fact that cross- cultural comparisons have always been the mainstay of sophisticated studies of material culture and that they are implicit in the avowed aim of studies of material culture to show human reactions to different environmental and cultural situations. As I have tried to show elsewhere (Ucko 1969: 263-4), it is in the realm of cross-cultural comparisons that some serious divergence has begun to appear between the work of those studying modern material culture and those concerned with archaeological material culture. I have argued that in the context of studies of material culture, the comparative method focuses attention on a variety of cultural responses to what may appear to be similar situations. In such cases, and especially where one is dealing with a universal human predica- ment and one which allows only a limited range of 30</page><page sequence="10">solutions, cross-cultural similarities and differences are at their most interesting, and at the same time are most difficult to interpret. I was prompted to make these observations in the context of burial rites, and it may appear far-fetched to argue the same with regard to glans sheathing but, in every society, whether or not it recognises physiological paternity, the penis must, at the very least, have served to define half of the population. For any society which does not simply hide the male organ beneath a garment cover- ing the whole of the lower part of the body there are only a few possibilities left; to allow the penis to remain unencumbered in its natural state, to place it within some form of sheath, or to anchor it in some unnatural position. Where the penis is not allowed to hang loosely in its normal flaccid state the various possi- bilities for human ingenuity are limited and at the same time they are concerned with an area of the body which can be assumed to be of universal sexual significance. In other words, I am dealing with a situation where the common denominator is the penis/ glans which can be assumed to be associated with ideas of virility (and all the symbolism and emotion which may go with this concept) and at the same time with an area of human activity which, for those people who do not simply leave the penis to its own devices, allows only limited ingenuity. It is exactly this situation of restricted solution to a universal human predicament which offers the challenge to so many studies of material culture. It should force such studies to concentrate not only on gross morphological analysis but also on less obvious morphological dis- tinctions (such as pre- and post-usage), on the details of the construction of the artefacts, as well as on such vital aspects as their social contexts, in order to distinguish between those similarities which may reflect cultural contact and those which may be the result of independent or convergent evolution. I have spent considerable time in discussion of both the definition of the objects and practices to be dis- cussed in this paper and the aims of material culture studies. I hope that from this starting point I have avoided the pitfalls against which Heider (1969: 380) has warned when discussing Dani attire; namely, the restrictive pressures involved in starting from a purely 'exclusive category'. As far as I am concerned, to start from limited functional-morphological criteria leaves open all options regarding subsequent method. Distribution We have seen that one of the established aims in studies of material culture is to investigate processes and results of cultural diffusion and innovation, and one of its main tools has been the use of distribution maps. Clearly I have not the time here to enter into the details of argument which make up the distribu- tions that I have prepared and I must content myself with saying simply that these maps extend in several ways previous attempts to plot distributions of penis sheaths.9 A , DAUCWAEOLQ6GCAL EVIDENCE &lt; ~~~~~~~~* * Sn*rH * U[ * GouRzSEf&gt; * LEAF AV r.GRQ,\ss Sa4EVAT? g ) s~~~~PENtS ISiELL FIGURE 1. Distribution of sheathing practices in South America. 31</page><page sequence="11">South America The cultural distribution in the Americas (fig. 1) of the practice of confining the glans penis is concentrated in the Amazonian basin and along the north coastal region of South America. In the vast majority of cases the South American practice consists of binding the prepuce over the glans and placing the penis erect under some form of belt; in a significant minority of cases some form of manufactured sheath is used; and among a few peoples the prepuce is tied over the glans and the penis is left in its natural flaccid position. As was said long ago by Friederici (1912: 155), the South American distributions of different ways of confining the glans penis overlap considerably; and, in general, sheathing which itself has been occasion- ally used to define a culture area, does not in fact conform very closely to culture areas which have been distinguished on quite different criteria. When we look at the materials used for the manufacture of sheaths we find a northern distribution for the use of gourd and the occasional grass example, and an eastern distribution (south of the Amazon) for the use of leaves and the occasional grass example. Nordenskiold (1924: 148) had already observed this discontinuous distribution and had suggested that those tribes who now wear aprons had previously used penis sheaths or had tied the prepuce beyond the glans. The gaps in distribution (many of which cannot be ascribed to lack of recording) point the lesson that we must be cautious in assuming that this trait is particularly useful for assessing culture con- tacts; such gaps are found, for example, within the mountainous areas of Peru which are characterised by the relatively widespread practice pf prepuce tying (Steward &amp; Metraux 1948: 571). All that can be said about this restricted South American distribution is that glans confinement is common in the mountainous areas, in areas of tropical forest and in various isolated tribal groups, and that this practice has a remarkably limited distribution in eastern Brazil. Most attempts to characterise particular tribal groups otherwise defined by language, on the basis of the absence or presence of glans confinement have been shown to be inadequate by more recent observation (e.g. Zerries's (1964: 120) now outdated claim that only one Ge tribe had such a practice). There are a few more specific suggestions concerned with the relationship between individual tribal groups rather than with general distribution. Polykrates (1962: 86-7) suggests some possible cultural affinity between the Kashuiana, the Parantintin and the Tupi, for they alone wear long manufactured sheaths of various vegetable fibres, and he draws attention to evidence that the Kashuiana formerly lived at the mouth of the Tapajoz and might therefore have been in contact with the Tupi. Similarly Caspar suggests cultural affinity between those Brazilian tribes of the Guapore and Mochado rivers who wear a particular distinctive leaf sheath (1952: 155; 1953: 209). Outside the mainland of South America, northwards to the Gulf of Mexico, the penis is occasionally bound'upright under a belt. In North America the Mandans bound the prepuce over the glans with deer sinew at least for the performance of certain rites (see Catlin 1967: 58).1o * ~~~~~&amp;AA?

New Guinea The practice of tying up the penis under a belt is also found widely scattered in New Guinea (fig. 2), extending further eastwards in New Guinea than any other form of glans confinement. The best known of New Guinea methods of penis confinement is the one isolated by Graebner as part of his Oceanic 32</page><page sequence="12">'totemic' complex (e.g. Graebner 1924: 49): the use of manufactured sheaths. Bamboo, and also nets, are restricted to a few isolated areas, whereas the use of nuts is widespread and scattered. Concentrations are evident in the use of shell sheaths on the south coast and along many of the south-draining rivers such as the Fly, Baliem and Digoel and in the use of gourds on the north coast, but almost exclusively in the Highlands. The distribution of the use of gourd sheaths is now known to be quite extensive from the April and Strickland rivers in the east to the Wayland mountains in the west." Most authorities have correctly taken the use of the gourd sheath as a Highland trait and the use of some other form of penis concealment, especially shells, as a Lowland one; Le Roux (1948) and Reisenfeld (1946) identify particular areas as intermediate regions where gourds and shells, shells and nuts or gourds and net/ aprons occur together. In general some authors have stressed the cultural continuity of the areas across which the use of a particular type of sheath is found whereas, rather more convincingly, other authors have stressed the scattered nature of the present day distribution, have insisted on the speed of change of such practices, and have postulated previous culture areas whose identity is now disguised by changes in custom. Some authorities have focused on the details of sheathing practices, particular decorative devices and technological features such as the position of the opening into which the penis is inserted. These attempts have met with only limited success in charac- terising cultural areas, the most convincing being the identification of the coastal New Guinea Mimika peoples with the use of distinctive bamboo sheaths. Detailed analysis of bamboo sheath designs led Haddon and Layard (1916: 35) to isolate three different types of sheath whose geographical distribution is not well defined. A stone figure from the Huon peninsula with the representation of a figure with penis held upwards suggests that some of these practices may in the past have extended further eastwards (Neuhaus 1911: fig. 59, 1).

Distribution of sheathing practices in the South West Pacific. 33</page><page sequence="13">South-west Pacific In the Gambier Islands and in several of the Mar- quesas the prepuce was tied beyond the glans and the penis allowed to hang naturally, a practice known from the South Americas but not from the south-west Pacific. Within the islands of the south-west Pacific (fig. 3) the distribution of penis confinement is strikingly discontinuous. Shell sheaths are worn in most of the Admiralty Islands, whereas New Britain and New Ireland, except apparently for very occasional tying up of the penis under the belt in the former, practise no penis confinement. With the probable exception of Ulawa Island no penis confinement exists in any of the Solomon Islands, Santa Cruz or Tikopia. Further south, however, many varied practices occur, particularly the penis tied up under the belt both with and without previous wrapping of the penis in different materials, and these practices are concen- trated in the New Hebrides, the Loyalty Islands and New Caledonia. The majority of attempts to deduce culture history from practices of penis confinement have been concerned with this discontinuous Melan- esian distribution and many suggestions have been made regarding the relation between sheathing and circumcision. The two main general explanations are those by Rivers (1914: 432-6) and Speiser(1934: 138-9), both making free use of postulated incursions of different peoples into the area. For Rivers some form of operation on the foreskin was an indigenous Polynesian practice; when the later Kava peoples came into the area they came without their own women. In order to be accepted by the indigenous women the Kava men had to be circumcised and yet they had a dread of exposing the glans; to neutralise the results of such exposure they adopted penis covers. Layard (1942: 478), in rejecting this explanation for the New Hebrides, nevertheless accepted the association between penis wrapper and incision/circumcision. According to Speiser nakedness was originally a Papuan trait whereas both clothing and circumcision derived from Melanesia; before circumcision was introduced the penis was allowed to hang freely. Speiser's two main tenets are 1) that when Melanesian circumcision spread into areas where loin cloths were worn the practice developed of placing the penis under the belt; and 2) when circumcision spread into areas without clothing the penis was placed either into a shell or into some sort of wrapper. To explain the whole distribution, however, Speiser had to postulate that in a certain few areas where circumcision was adopted, the penis was nevertheless left hanging; such areas of circumcision and nudity were, according to Speiser, marginal. But the complexity is still greater, for Speiser had to admit that in certain areas of nudity circumcision was rejected, and yet penis covers were adopted and, besides, he gave no explanation as to how a penis shell could be fastened onto a circumcised penis. Furthermore the distribution of penis confine- ment in this area shows a remarkable association between the use of manufactured sheaths and areas formerly often called Papuan. Within so-called Melanesian areas we find three possibilities: either no practice of penis confinement exists, or the penis is occasionally bound up to a belt, or a penis wrapper is used. That the prepuce bound and held up to a waist belt also occurred in Polynesia is clear from classical Maori practice (e.g. Best 1940: 296; Biggs 1960: 15; Mead 1969: 37). On the basis of certain particular similarities in penis covers several more specific theories were developed. Thus, despite differences in modes of attachment and materials, Speiser (1933: 189) deduced that diffusion to New Caledonia came from the north and not direct from Arue. The existence of penis sheaths throughout Malekula was taken by Deacon (1934: 10), although he distinguished different forms of penis wrappers, as evidence of the overall cultural identity of the island. For the whole region of the New Hebrides Deacon stresses that the custom of wearing a penis sheath is restricted to the islands with patrilineal descent, and he explained the current distribution in terms of various influxes of different peoples. At first the organisation of the islands was matrilineally based; under the influence of immigrants who practised incision and who wore penis sheaths the organisation changed to a patrilineal one. A further invasion occurred this time of a 'mat-skirt culture' which occupied matrilineal areas and did not extend very far southwards. However this mat-skirt culture did reach 'the coastal areas of Malekula, where although the man's penis sheath survived the fringed petticoat of the women gave place to the mat-skirt' (Deacon 1934: 706). It is worth noting that none of these cultural reconstructions makes any reference to reports that either in the past or still today the Maoris of New Zealand, some groups in the Philippines, certain Japanese and the natives of Nias Island, west of Sumatra, all tied or tie the prepuce to cover the glans or tie the penis up to the belt. Africa Penis confinement in Africa (fig. 4) is restricted ethnographically to large areas of west Africa, many South African tribes'2 and some parts of the Congo (the apparent scattered distribution in the Congo is probably the result of inadequate recording). In the vast majority of cases the confinement takes the form of manufactured penis or glans sheaths. The literature deals with this African distribution in two rather different ways, either concentrating on local group or tribal affiliations or stressing the great antiquity of the African penis confinement trait and pointing out the major lines of development and distribution. In the local west African context interest has centred on showing how certain tribal groups, such as the Bafia in what is now East Cameroon are distinct from other groups within the same supposed culture areas (Tessmann 1934: 83). For the Bafia the suggestion is that they fall within the cultural influence of the 34</page><page sequence="14">A 4ogAt A AA I s 'h9 OA AA g PsREPU TIE 4P1A9 N *oB*JL A IO A SIAEPTHs FIGURE 4. Distribution of sheathing practices in Africa. central Sudan, while the use of sheaths in Adamawa in Nigeria is accepted by many (e.g. Meek 1931: 378; 1925: 41) as showing an ancient connexion with the Plateau. Such observations are elaborated in two different ways which may appear somewhat con- tradictory; one line of argument accepts the custom of wearing penis sheaths as a mark of certain tribes such as the Chamba of Adamawa Province, the Guisiga of Northern Cameroon and the Zango Verre of Yibango, distinguishing them from surrounding tribes of other- wise similar cultural traditions. The other approach is to equate the use of sheaths with wide cultural or linguistic groupings; thus for northern Nigeria Meek (1925: 41) claims that all sheath wearers are semi- Bantu peoples, while those of the French Sudan are taken to belong to the Volta family. Following this line of argument the use of sheaths is taken as evidence of an ancient connexion between the Plateau Bantu and the semi-Bantu. For the Bantu-speaking tribes of southern Africa the emphasis has been on con- nexions between specific tribal groups and the borrowing of different sheath types (defined morpholo- gically) by one group from another. Frequently the suggestion is that tribal groups who originally had their own distinctive penis confinement practices eventually adopted a Zulu type of glans cover (e.g. Junod 1927: 95); but, unfortunately, this sequence of events in the majority of cases is difficult to authenticate in view of the wide variety of practices of the Zulu themselves and the confusion of terminology in the literature. The most elaborate scheme is that offered by Junod (1927: 626) for the Thonga who, it is suggested, may already have worn a cylindrical or conical glans cover made of plaited palm leaf (the Mbaya) in a pre-Bantu period. Later, until c. 1500, they may have continued to wear the same mbaya. 35</page><page sequence="15">In the third period, from 1800 to 1820, Junod claims that they definitely wore the mbaya while, after 1820 (but see below for comments on this date), and until they adopted European dress they wore a polished round glans cover made of gourd or wood (the shifado) which Junod claims was derived from the Zulu. Some suggestions have been made for Africa, as also for Melanesia, that circumcision and penis sheathing have a parallel distribution. More recent study, however, has shown that confinement of the penis/glans is found both amongst tribes who do practise circumcision and those who do not. No one has suggested for the African data, as they have for Melanesia, that this distribution was the result of partial adoption of practices introduced by incoming peoples. Egypt The wider interest in African sheaths has focused on the long antiquity of penis confinement in the African continent as well as its modern distribution. Penis sheaths of several forms are known from repre- sentations dating from the Pre- and Proto-Dynastic (before c. 3000 B.C.) periods of Egypt until at least the end of the Middle Kingdom, c. 1780 B.C. while the evidence of rock art from some stage of prehistory reveals similar practices in Algeria, Upper Egypt and Rhodesia (e.g. Flamend 1921: 82; Winkler 1938: 20; Lee &amp; Woodhouse 1966: 115). There have been two major arguments concerning the antiquity of this practice. According to the first the similarities between the ancient and modern custom indicate the basically African nature of early Egyptian culture, an African basis which continued well into historic times (e.g. Junod 1927: 93, note 1; Luschan 1900: 505). The second view, which is by far the more popular, is that the wearing of a sheath in ancient times was a Lybian characteristic (e.g. Bates 1914: 122; Naville 1900: 68; Winckler 1938: 20). According to this view the Pre- and Proto-Dynastic representations are evidence of original Libyan contact (or even identity) with ancient Egyptians; later historic representations are in the majority of cases interpreted again as Libyans. This almost universal equation between the wearing of a penis sheath and the Libyan identity has led to several ingenious attempts at deciphering the meaning of several Proto-Dynastic ornamented palettes in terms of invading populations and the enslavement of indigenous peoples (Legge 1900: 125-39; 1909: 297, 300, 309). Recent re-analysis, however, of several of the historic representations has made it quite clear that many of the individuals shown wearing sheaths are in fact Egyptians (see e.g. Blackman 1914: 3; 1915: 19; Fischer 1961: 68, 74). Furthermore Elliot Smith's observation (1923: 83) that there was undeniable direct evidence for Pre- Dynastic Egyptian peoples themselves having worn penis sheaths has, until recently (Holscher 1955: 37; Ucko 1967: 351-3), been completely overlooked. Elliot Smith, himself, saw the penis sheath distribution as reflecting cultural continuity from Pre-Dynastic Egypt into historical times; from Egypt he considered the practice to have spread into Nubia and hence, after a considerable lapse of time, into east Africa. In some cases these two approaches have been reconciled, the ancient Libyans being considered as representatives of basic African culture and historic Egyptian representations of people wearing sheaths therefore being interpreted as depicting either Libyans or Nubians (see Fischer 1961: 74). The views of those who have stressed that the Egyptian sheath might have had a restricted function, such as for use in hunting (e.g. Fischer 1961: 68) or that the Libyan sheath might have served a quite different purpose from that of sheaths worn elsewhere (e.g. Bates 1914: 122) have been largely ignored. Suggestions of some kind of meaningful similarity between the sheaths of such diverse peoples as the Libyans, Pre- and Proto-Dynas- tic Egyptians, Minoans, Myceneans, modern Moba, modern Thonga and New Caledonians gained much more attention (e.g. Evans 1927: 20-1; Legge 1900: 133-5; 1909: 300; Luschan 1900: 505; 1901: 197-200, and see Pendlebury 1939: 268). Interpretation of distribution At the beginning of this paper I made no apologies for the continued interest in distinguishing indepen- dent invention from convergent and parallel evolution and from diffusion. I must stress, however, that the correct distinction between these processes is vital and only when this has been satisfactorily accomplished can historical inferences and deductions be usefully undertaken. I would suggest that these distinctions were sadly missing from the works of the majority of authors reviewed so far. In the first place, we are confronted with a highly discontinuous distribution, worldwide but with the trait separated by vast distances and enormous time spans, a distribution which may lend itself to explanation in terms of independent evolution, assuming that the same solution has been found to satisfy a basic need for protection which has arisen at different times and in different areas (e.g. Chauvet 1936: 99) (and see Luschan 1901: 117-200). Secondly, we have a practice which can be considered specific and unusual enough to suggest cultural con- nexions. This last view is supported not only by numerous archaeologists who have postulated some cultural connexions between ancient Egypt (with or without the Libyans), Minoan Crete and ancient Greece, on the basis of representations of the sheath- ing practice, but also by some ethnologists who, in perhaps the most extreme form, have seen in this distribution (excepting the Himalayas (plate 18) about which they were apparently unaware) evidence of the diffusion of a negro trait not only across Africa from the western Sudan but also from Africa to Melanesia, New Guinea and South America (Jeffreys 1968: 305-17). 36</page><page sequence="16">In other words, I insist on the continuing importance of the old familiar questions posed by at least the cultural and physical anthropologists; how similar do traits have to be to constitute possible evidence of past contact and how can one distinguish such similarities from those derived from other factors such as the situation to be dealt with, or the chance appearance of similar traits. And I insist too on the importance of Forde's emphasis on the specific similarity of form or content as opposed to what in this context we can call general morphological or sociological parallelism (Forde 1959: 199). In studies of material culture (and I am not at all sure that this does not equally apply to other studies of anthropological interest) it is clear that different facets of activity may develop or remain relatively static independently of each other (e.g. Ucko 1969: 263). This is an important and complex point for it can be argued with equal logic that on the one hand it is the specific non-generalised parallel between cultures that is the really meaningful clue to cultural contact (Ucko &amp; Rosenfeld 1967: 153; and see Jeifreys 1968: 315-16) and on the other hand that it is the number of similar traits shared by different cultures that can distinguish between homology and analogy (Balfour 1936: 11; and see Jeffreys 1968: 309), or it can be argued that both kinds of similarities have their own value (e.g. Ucko &amp; Rosenfeld 1967: 153-8). Following Rowe (1965-6: 336), we may go a stage further and say that even in situations where the details of form or content may be similar we need not even then postulate diffusion. But we are then, and this is the important point, confronted with a crucial question-why have two or more peoples, in widely dispersed areas or at widely different dates, adopted the same solution to a particular problem or why have they responded in the same particular way to a specific situation. If we rephrase these possi- bilities with reference to penis confinement practices, we may say that to reject any diffusionist explanation of the detailed similarities in the sheathing practices of different peoples is to say that we have eliminated any cases of convergent evolution, and that we accept the likelihood of processes of independent invention, with the added rider that the range of possible penis confinement practices is, by definition, limited. Furthermore we must acknowledge, as has been stated before, that to confine the penis by some sheathing practice is to choose only one of several different possible responses to the problem set by the 'shame- display' situation, which may or may not include the use of some form of manufactured sheathing device. There are several aspects of penis confinement which must therefore be investigated in order to assess the usefulness of these possible lines of interpretation. We may consider these features under several major headings: evidence for the relative stability of the trait; details of techniques of manufacture and methods of attachment; overt explanation of the trait by the users; and contexts of its use, each of which will help us to form an opinion about the nature of this practice. To take one of the more convincing of the suggestions reviewed above, before we can assess the likelihood of the Kashuiena, the Parantintin and the Tupi having previously been in contact because all these groups wear sheaths we must attempt in several different ways to evaluate how close the similar practice of sheathing really is amongst these peoples. In this specific case, Polykrates has started from an overall morphological similarity based primarily on size and has, rightly or wrongly, taken this similarity as being more significant than other differences in morphology, the use of different vegetable materials in their construction and the very different techniques involved: the Parantintin folding some twelve aruma leaves on top of each other (Nimuendaju 1924: 254-5) to form conical tubes to hang down from the penis, the Kashuiana plaiting their sheaths with an opening in the side for the insertion of the penis which is then attached by cords round the waist, and between the legs and up across the buttocks (Polykrates 1962: 86-7). Relative stability Within the context of the relative stability of the trait we may distinguish 1) the attitude of the peoples concerned, 2) the speed of change associated with the trait, and 3) the variety of practices within a tribe or culture area. Attitudes towards sheaths. It is, I think, relevant to realise that my insistence on the importance of study- ing human artefacts at the beginning of this paper was not solely the view of an outside observer wishing to study culture history but is also an attitude held by many of the peoples concerned. Their interest in material objects is of course partly to be explained in terms of time, labour and economics (see below) but it is also a reflection of the fact that they themselves often find artefacts the most convenient distinctive signs of a person's tribal or cultural allegiance. The Apapocuva of Brazil have a creation myth in which are related the exploits of some brutish but not particularly terrifying creatures and their relationship to the twins born of God. One of these creatures disturbs the twins while they are out hunting and is thereafter at the receiving end of numerous of the twins' practical jokes. Normally this creature wears his penis tied up to the body with a long hip cord which he removes while bathing. One day the twins put pepper into the water and the more the creature washes his penis the more it burns when tied up to the belt. Finally he runs away and falls into the ever- lasting abyss. The Apapocuva do not themselves tie up the penis and Nimuendaju (1914: 320) explains this part of the creation myth as a means of making fun of those nearby tribes who do practice this form of penis confinement, amongst whom are found their own arch enemies. The use of some form of penis confinement as a distinctive tribal sign is also reported from other parts of the world. The use of a sheath by the chief of the Nioka of the Congo is taken by them as distinguishing 37</page><page sequence="17">them from other Pende (Sousberghe 1954: 216-19). In New Guinea the situation seems to vary from people to people; there are several reports of native porters collapsing in laughter at the varying methods of penis confinement encountered during the journey when accompanying travellers in New Guinea. In some areas of New Guinea the distinction is not simply between those who do and those who do not wear some form of penis confinement; different groups of Dani are distinctively recognisable according to the width and length of their penis sheaths as well as by the angles at which they are held (Heider 1969: 386). Similarly, the Simori never have the sheath decorated with plumes or held up to the stomach, while the Dem never have the sheath protruding straight forwards with the point curving upwards (Le Roux 1948: 143). In several cases in New Guinea different districts are characterised by the wearing of different types of sheath: some may be decorated, others plain; some may be elongated and others egg-shaped; some curved, some peanut in shape and size (Willey 1966: 185). A typical New Guinea situation is described by Reche (1913: 75-6); as he journeyed along the foot- hills of the Sepik river, at first the majority of the people in most villages were naked, then in one particular village the majority of people were clothed in a variety of sheaths and eventually in the mountains more or less everyone wore gourds. Le Roux (1948: 143) summarises the position for New Guinea by stressing that there is some regularity in the fashions of penis confinement in each tribe, but that these fashions often overlap. There is some suggestion in the literature that this picture may also be true for other areas apart from New Guinea; thus in different parts of New Caledonia, penis wrappers vary greatly in length, from the short wrapper bound up to the stomach to wrappers of some 60 cm. long (Glaumont 1889: 102). Much the same picture of regional differentiation emerges from a study of sixteenth and seventeenth century European codpieces whose mor- phology and methods of attachment varied from country to country (e.g. Binder 1958: 200-1 and illustrations). Speed of change. In certain areas of regular visiting and trading in New Guinea, such as Seka and the Humboldt Bay, no surprise is evinced by varying customs; the former people wear sheaths and their Humboldt Bay visitors wear nothing and yet they are given the kind of welcome due to prestigious neigh- bours. There are strong indications in the literature that it is particularly in areas of intensive trading or migrant labour that, as might have been expected, the use of penis confinement has undergone most modifi- cation; it is known that in Leitere sheaths used to be worn but that this custom has been discontinued for the past eighty years or so. This information is based on direct observation, but some very different criteria have been used for deducing the length of time that the custom of penis confinement has been in use, and clearly some of these are much more reliable than others. There is of course no problem about assessing the speed of change associated with penis confinement when the assessment is based upon directly observed evidence, except that most of these observations tend to be derived from trading centres and are therefore subject to special conditions of strong external influence. In this way we know of the changes of custom both at Leitere and in the general Humboldt Bay region of New Guinea. We also know from direct observation of the decrease of the use of penis shells on the Pacific Islands of Pak, Lou and Paluan. In certain ares of Malekula a far greater number of wrappers had'names than were actually used. From this Deacon (1934: 341) deduced that the custom of wrapping the penis was breaking down, a conclusion which is supported by the fact that there has been acute depopulation in Malekula. We have similar observa- tions from Africa, for Meek (1931: 504) reports that when he visited the Kugama the wearing of sheaths was then in the process of becoming obsolete. Occasion- ally it is even possible to assign rough dates to different forms of sheaths; the last South African Thonga mbaya was seen about 1894, having been still common among the northern clans until about 1835 (Junod 1927a: 516; 1927b: 93), while Zulu aluminium sheaths cannot have been introduced before c. 1890. There are also the first reports of European voyagers, giving us some idea of the longevity of penis confinement practices (e.g. Vasco da Gama's observation at the end of the fifteenth century that the inhabitants around St Helena's Bay wore sheaths (Ley 1947: 4)). In Venezuela also some direct observation records that gold and pearl decorated sheaths were greatly desired by the Spaniards and that the natives took to wearing gourds (Friederici 1912: 156; Nordernskiold 1924: 148). We can also accept the antiquity of tying up the penis in South America as this practice is shown on certain excavated plaques and on statues from San Augustin. Becher (1955: 144) associates this with the continued existence of such practices in some very isolated tribes. Perhaps the least convincing of these criteria for assessing change is that based on an ancient Egyptian representation of a female wearing a sheath, from which it is deduced that already by the Vth Dynasty (c. 2550-2400 B.C.) the real meaning of what must originally have been an actual male practice had been forgotten (Borchardt 1913: 13). Some further criteria have been used to assess changes in penis confinement practices and must surely be more questionable. In the African context, Tessmann (1934: 83-5, 88) argues from traditional history for the exceptionally swift changes of style of penis confinement, for the Bafia of the Cameroon who now wear leaf sheaths claim that they originally wore skin coverings and later adopted gourd sheaths from neighbouring tribes, the latter still wearing gourd or wood sheaths. For the Moba and Gourma of west Africa, Froelich (1949: 101) argues that the sheath must be an archaic form of dress for its use is confined to initiation rites, ignoring the possibility that it might 38</page><page sequence="18">always have been confined to such occasions. For the Chamba Lekon of Nigeria as well as for the Pacific island of Emirau it has been argued that because it is only the old men who wear sheaths it can be assumed that the custom is dying out, ignoring the possibility that this practice might be defined by, or might define, social status and age (Meek 1931: 378; Chinnery n.d.: 131). The restriction of the use of shell sheaths for dancing and at times of war in the Admiralty Islands has been taken as evidence of its relatively recent foreign introduction. The basic problems of deducing former practice from restricted usage is not only that the use may always have been restricted but that such restriction can as well be interpreted as reflecting recent introduction. We have already noticed this explanation suggested in the case of the Admiralty Islands and we find it again for the peoples of the Yawin valley in New Guinea where only few males wear a penis confinement (of shell or coconut); it has been argued (Wirz 1928: 145) that this reflects recent introduction of the practice from the Marind- Anim. Whatever the shortcomings of all the deduc- tions which are not based on recorded direct observa- tion or on datable events, there is no doubt of the considerable evidence which suggests that practices of penis confinement are not particularly stable. As Friederici (1912: 153) maintained long ago (although assuming that this practice had once formed a single complex) this trait cannot be assumed to be static and, over time and distance, numerous changes and differences can be assumed and shown to have occurred. Variety of practice. Although we have seen that certain tribes and cultural areas are distinguished by specific penis confinement practices, this in no way implies that each tribe always has just one sheathing practice. Sheaths may be used in certain situations only, as for example during certain dances on the island of Manus where the men don white shells and the boys practice wearing small fruit shell coverings, or there may be several types of sheaths used by the same people. In the central New Hebrides, apart from Erromanga, the penis is wrapped in grass, in tapa or in cotton cloth or is placed within a horn or even possibly within a bamboo sheath. The island of Pentecost has penis wrappers in the south but no penis confinement in the west of the island. Variety of penis confinement practices are also found within the same tribe and at the same locality; thus in New Guinea the Telefolmin normally wear either various types of gourds or large nuts, the latter being rarer and more greatly valued (Villeminot &amp; Villeminot 1964: 255), but the occasional individual is to be encountered wearing instead a toothpaste container (Simpson 1963: 363), a Kodak film container or a cut-open sardine tin (personal communication, B. A. L. Cranstone). Also in New Guinea Toro men are sometimes nude, some- times nude except for a waist belt, sometimes clothed with a waist belt with a shell suspended over the flank and sometimes with a belt with the shell hiding the penis which is tucked under the belt (Seligman &amp; Strong 1906: 228). Amongst the Mimika people both shell and bamboo are used, while amongst the Marind-Anim the variety is even greater, some having the penis under the waist belt, some wearing a shell sheath and some with a shell 'phallocrypt' (see note 6). A story from the Dani reflects this situation of variety within a broad framework of conformity. Mathiessen (1963: 135) recounts that while a woman was asleep a man quickly assaulted her, and she, once she realised that it was not her husband, shouted for help. By the time help came, the man had gone leaving behind only his sheath. The village was very anxious to trace the culprit, but as all males wore elongated gourds, some straight and some with curled tips with or without dangling fur decorations, they had little real hope of succeeding. In Africa also the literature hints at variety both intra-tribal and between groups of basically similar peoples. Thus among the Thonga the length of sheaths varies from 1 to 2 ft according to taste (Bryant 1929: 291), while all the Verre of northern Nigeria except for those who call themselves the Zango wear sheaths. In South America, each clan and subclan of the Bororo owns a particular sheath decoration, but amongst different groups of Bororo are found quite different penis confinement practices; some place the penis within a leaf cuff, some place the penis under a waist belt, and some are reported as wearing rings. With this picture in mind it is unlikely that a tribe within which such variety is the norm should hold strong views about the necessity of sheathing the penis in a particular and standardised way. This is a picture which again suggests fluidity and a possibility of both personal and group variety and experimenta- tion. Techniques of manufacture It is now necessary to move on to the consideration of the details of technological construction of the different methods of penis confinement and in this way to add a further dimension to the question whether we are in fact dealing with very similar practices and objects or whether we may, in some cases at least, suspect that we are dealing with processes of convergent evolution. We may broadly distinguish two aspects to the technology of sheathing devices: first the manufacture of the sheaths themselves, and second, the methods of attaching them to the penis, glans penis, or prepuce. Vegetable fibres. Our initial approach must again be cross-cultural taking as the starting point the materials from which the sheaths are made. Most information in the literature is concerned with the use of leaves and with gourds, while for several of the other materials used, we know almost nothing of the details of their manufacture. The vast majority of sheaths made of vegetable fibres, most commonly leaves or raffia/grass, are plaited (plate 1), a few exceptional cases being made of woven basketry 39</page><page sequence="19">(plate 3). The plaiting varies greatly from society to society some sheaths being made from narrow strips of palm leaf or raffia and others of wide leaves of banana, aruma, etc. Morphological varia- tion within the category of fibre sheaths is vast, both in shape and size. These sheaths may be long and straight, short and straight or in distinctive shapes resembling knee-shaped pipes, boxes, or envelopes, the particular form used varying according to cultural preference and the methods of attachment to the penis/glans. In some cases the plaiting used, for example for penis wrappers in Malekula (e.g. Layard 1942: 42) is very intricate while in other cases, such as the Akwe-Shavante (plate 2) and many other South American peoples, the men make their own everyday sheaths by simply folding leaves over each other to form a cone (e.g. Krause 1911: 396). The most detailed account of the techniques of manufacture of different leaf sheaths as well as the identity of the manufacturers is found in Tessmann's (1934: 83-94) account of the Bafia of the Cameroons who wear a multiplicity of sheath forms each with its own distinctive name. New styles of sheaths are con- tinually being introduced and, once approved, are quickly copied by others. Any Bafia can make his own normal, everyday, sheath from strips of palm leaves, the sheaths being as broad as they are long. Boys make their own net-like sheaths or obtain good specimens from their fathers. Only specialist Bafia can make the type of leaf sheath which has two points; these forms are made with an awl of a type used in many other contexts and are constructed from large palm leaves which have had the middle spine removed by a knife during folding. Each palm strip is made into one sheath which has its lower ends cut obliquely, is then rolled and the point pushed through the slit in the roll while the front end is pushed into shape to make the second point which is kept in place by stitching; stitching also extends all along the edge of the rolled sheath. Only certain master craftsmen amongst the Bafia can make certain rare types of sheaths and those worn during festivals, all of which are covered with snake or lizard skin and are charac- terised by their rounded off corners and the use of decorative sewing, colouring and the sophisticated inclusion of decorative additions such as feathers and claws. The Zulu are one of the rare peoples to make use of basketry sheaths which are made by minor craftsmen of woven strips of banana stalks fashioned into very lightweight spherical box shapes (Bryant 1949: 135, 408). There is also good information available about the manufacture of the palm leaf cuffs of the Bororo of Brazil which are worn for the first time during initia- tion rites. There is some confusion whether it is the women or the novices' grandparents or uncles who collect the appropriate leaves for the manufacture of the cuffs (see Levi-Strauss 1964: 52-4) but it seems likely that it is the novice's ritual father who actually manufactures the sheath and places it on the novice's penis. As has already been stated, Bororo cuffs vary in their decoration according to the particular clan or subclan of the wearer but this applies only to festival occasions when a band of 8-16 cm. length decorated with feathers or down and often painted is allowed to hang freely. Normally Bororo sheaths are cut short without such appendages, made simply by folding and rolling a palm leaf of c. 50 cm. on itself to form a conical funnel with one end open (Levi-Strauss 1936: 294-6; Karsten 1926a: 150-2; Steinen 1894: 193; cp. Fric &amp; Radin 1906: 392). In Malekula where sheaths are again adopted in initiation rites it is the woman, the mothers of the novices, who are apparently responsible for their plaiting which follows the longitudinal stripping of banana leaves while leaving enough of the central fibre to withstand some wear (see Layard 1942: 42). It is noticeable from this review that the morphological variety allowed by this particular material, as well as the techniques employed in their shaping, is vast. Gourds. Sheaths made from gourds may be of very varying diameters and lengths; sometimes two gourds may be fitted together to gain the desired length. Haddon &amp; Layard (1916: 8) report a New Guinea Utakwa case where one gourd of 24 cm. length is inserted into another of 13-5 cm. to form a sheath of 34-5 cm. with a 4 cm. diameter at the base and 1 cm. at the tip. In some museum specimens from the New Guinea Tapiro the joining of two gourds together under a binding allows the tip of the sheath to have some flexibility (plate 4). Some New Guinea tribes use sheaths which are open- ended; others, such as the Pesegem and Dani use sheaths which are closed either naturally or with the use of such materials as a wad of the fur from a cuscus or other marsupial's tail, wads of bark, some kind of fibre stopper, or even a hornbill beak (e.g. Heider 1969: 387; Kooijman 1962: 48; Nouhuys 1913: 15). As will be seen, gourd sheaths are attached in different ways to the penis and/or scrotum13 and/or to the waist and these different methods require different features on the sheaths themselves: perforations at different places through the gourd or encircling bands. Among the pygmies in the Goliath mountains of New Guinea, for example, the long sheaths have rattan strips round the middle or top of the gourds to which are attached cords (e.g. Brock 1911: 821-3; Kock 1912). In the Star Mountains the bases of the gourds are strengthened with small plaited rattan or pandanus leaf bands (e.g. Kooijman 1962: 18). Several attempts exist to devise morphological classifications of New Guinea gourd sheaths but these are hardly con- vincing. Sande (1907: 92), for example, distinguished between egg shaped and pear shaped examples, the former large and heavy with closed blunt ends and the latter lighter with rather wider openings in the middle of the gourd. Normally these two sheath types are decorated with black engravings. The shapes of the sheaths depend partly on the methods of gourd cultivation used. Amongst the 40</page><page sequence="20">Dani of New Guuinea a long and straight gourd is obtained by attaching a stone weight to the growing gourd; a curved or curving gourd results from bending and lashing it while growing; and a particular light coloured gourd is obtained by protecting it from sunlight by wrapping the growing gourd in inner banana bark (Heider 1969: 396). In the Dani case each man may possess a wardrobe of several sizes and shapes (Gardner &amp; Heider 1969: 28; Heider 1969: 386-7), the variety consisting, as was reflected in the story of the rape of the sleeping woman, not only in the length of the sheath (a typical short example being c. 10-20 cm. long, and a typical long straight example being c. 60 cm. long) but also in the absence or presence of curled tip as well as in the sheath diameter (Heider 1969: 386). The basic manu- facturing processes are the same for all gourd wearers. Once the elongated fruit of the gourd creeper has been grown into the correct shape, the thick end of the fruit is cut off using stone or bamboo knives and some of the flesh is scooped out. The gourd is then roasted for some 15 minutes in order to harden the shell and to make the flesh soft. More flesh is then taken out together with reheating, a process which lasts for some 25 minutes, the outer skin of the fruit is scraped off and the gourd often sun-dried, sometimes to achieve a distinctive yellow colour (e.g. Kock 1912); the fruit is then dried for several nights near to a fire in order to harden it (Harrer 1963: 124; Heider 1969: 386; Pospisil 1963a: 286-7; Le Roux 1948: 138). The gourd is then often polished with fats or sweat and various attachments added. Not all New Guinea tribes train their gourds into special shapes (Le Roux 1948: 139). Unlike the Dani and Kapauku who appear to have a specially elaborate manufacturing process whereby the gourd vines are trained to climb up a special framework above the ground (Heider 1969: 386; Pospisil 1963a: 286), the Tifalmin do not appear to train their gourds at all. It may be that there is here a connexion with their unique method of splitting the wider end of the gourd down one side, pushing the broken sides inside each other and binding it to the required diameter with a tight plaited band of pandanus, one end of which is anchored in the split (plate 6). The resulting sheaths have basal diameters of 2-7-3-0 cm. and are all charac- terised by an angled profile at the base. South African gourd sheaths are usually bulbous and much smaller than those of New Guinea. Amongst the Nguni and Zulu, the gourds are often decorated with burnt incisions and are provided with protrusions, often curved, at the basal ends (plate 5). Amongst several tribes tassels of varying materials hang from the gourd sheaths (plate 23). Bamboo. The distinctive short bamboo sheaths of the Mimika of New Guinea (plates 8a, 8b) require particular techniques for their manufacture and yet their typological characteristics are only partially determined by the material and the tech- niques used. In the detailed analyses by Haddon and Layard (1916: 34) the cylinders used are said to vary from 10-19 cm. long and from 3-4-4-3 cm. diameter. One end of the cylinder is cut above a node and the other below a node, so that the upper end of the sheath is naturally bounded by a node whose septum is usually artificially pierced by a hole of 1 1-1 8 cm. diameter. Below the node is situated the scar of the leaf growth which is found alternately on one side and the other in the growing bamboo and which, with only the rarest of exceptions, is also the side of the bamboo cylinder in which is cut the opening for the insertion of the penis. On the other side of the cylinder a peak is usually carved as well as one or more lozenges whereas the ring surrounding this part of the whole bamboo cylinder is natural. On almost all of the Mimika bamboo sheaths are found decor- ative incisions, some apparently made by the application of hot metal tools to achieve a brownish colour standing out against the natural yellow colour of the bamboo and some cut out with cold tools. Morphological variety is expressed both in the shapes of the holes for insertion of the penis (divided into several types by Haddon &amp; Layard (1916: 35)) and in the general shape of the whole sheath which varies from squat and cylindrical (Fischer's cylinder-tongue types (1913: 48)) to cut-outs in the form of the human body with legs and feet (Fischer's two appendage legs type (1913: 49)). Experiments have shown that the whole time involved in the manufacture of even the most detailed and complex of these sheaths may have involved no more than 30 or 40 minutes, for bamboo is easy to work by slicing when cut with the grain and once the outer skin is penetrated the nodes are easy to pierce. Aluminium. Only a short time is involved in the manufacture of some other sheaths however unlikely this may at first sight appear to be. Museum collec- tions in Britain contain a considerable number of sheaths made from aluminium which were apparently worn by the Zulu (and possibly several other South African tribes). These artefacts were spun, their rims being bent severely backwards with the application of heat and a hole being punched after the manufacture and polishing of the object through the closed end of the sheath. It is not known whether these particular sheaths were made locally in South Africa from imported sheets of aluminium or whether, as claimed at least in certain sale catalogues (e.g. Stevens Sale Catalogue 1924), they were manufactured 'by an enterprising German trader and sold to the natives' (Lot 357). What does seem clear (Personal com- munication, Alcan Research and Development) is that these objects could have been made by anyone who had already acquired even the most rudimentary skills of metal spinning, and that the whole process would have been a matter of only some ten minutes. It is noteworthy that these distinctive sheaths, never mentioned in any ethnographic literature, are found in two main morphological types (plate 7) the first pear-shaped and the second spherical with 41</page><page sequence="21">grooved cylindrical opening, both types with apertures of 2-4-2-7 cm. diameter. Shells. On some of the Admiralty Islands the shells used as penis sheaths have the internal con- volutions broken but the apertures are left untouched or occasionally slightly enlarged, apparently to about finger-width (Miklucho-Maclay 1878: 113). Several examples are incised with black-filled linear decor- ations (e.g. Moseley 1876: 397; Nevermann 1934: 109) (plate 10). The shells used by some Mimika are similarly worked and in addition have two small perforations to take an attachment to a waist belt (Wollaston 1921: 113-14). The shells used by Toro men are apparently not worked in any way and the Toro do not trade them but fetch them them- selves from between the Bensbach and Morehead rivers (Seligman &amp; Strong 1906: 228). The shells used in the Kiwai district of New Guinea are obtained from the mouth of the Binaturi river and from the Torres Straits (Landtman 1933: 33). It is interesting to note that shell penis sheaths are not only known from the primitive world, for one example appears in Mabuse's (c. 1516) picture of Neptune and Amphitrite. Interestingly enough this sheath covers the penis and glans but not the scrotum, and is without parallel, contemporary representations being shown either nude or covered with a leaf or some form of cloth (see Segord 1923: 77; Heidrich 1910: fig. 124). Miscellaneous. Of the other materials used for the manufacture of different kinds of sheaths there is virtually no detail regarding their construction. Perhaps the strangest and simplest of all sheaths is that made from cocoons (plate 12a) of butterfly or moth worn by the Bhaca, the Zulu, the Nguni and Pondo of South Africa (e.g. Kohler 1933: 11; Tooke 1962: 81). Sheaths made from ivory, wood, coconut or fruit shell were carved into a variety of shapes, some possibly skeuomorphs of gourd and basketry forms (plates 12b, 12c). Skin and leather sheaths, from antelope, ox or goat, are quite common among several South African tribes. Amongst the Pondo all skin-working was undertaken by old men (Hunter 1961: 101). The Xhosa construct distinctive sheaths consisting of an elongated skin or leather bag to cover the penis with a thin strip extending through a shank of brass or twisted wire (plate 11). One Zulu type of skin sheath with sewn seam seems again to be skeuomorphic (plate 12d), greatly resembling the normal Zulu basketry sheath. Skin or leather sheaths were also used in ancient Egypt (see below). The Kaleri of Nigeria make some of their sheaths from long curling horns and perforate them for attachment cords (plate 13). In certain parts of South America the foreskin is not simply tied by the boy himself or by his mother, nor simply placed under a waist belt, but is held in a wooden suspensor of some 6-7 cm. long which is attached to the belt (Zerries 1964: 120). Carved wooden penis holders are also found in parts of New Guinea (e.g. Sorenson &amp; Gajdusek 1966: 159). Fibula. We must also note the use of metal rings. Amongst certain groups of Congolese Ba-Pende these form the bases of raffia sheaths (Sousberghe 1954: 214-19). In Roman Europe (and possibly earlier also) metal rings were inserted through holes in the prepuce. The nature of Roman 'fibula' is open to discussion. There is certainly no doubt that some men wore metal rings covering the prepuce (Celsus VII, 25(3); Juvenal, VI, 379) but there is some evidence that a Roman fibula might also refer to a metal sheath (see Martial XI, 75) or even a metal clasp of unknown shape. The latter evidence is based on an epigram by Martial (VII, 82) which describes Menophil wearing a particularly large fibula which, unfortunately for him, fell off during some athletic enterprise and revealed him to be circumcised. It is clear from this account that Menophil, being no doubt Jewish, was unable to wear a normal ring fibula as he could not fasten it over or through his prepuce and, as a fraudulent Jew, he became the subject of satire (see Dingwall 1925). Economics. There have been several hints in the previous review of the possible economic importance of sheath manufacture. For several peoples it is clear that sheaths were made domestically; for example, a Swazi boy's penis cover is made for him and given to him by his father (Marwick 1940: 153), but we have also encountered mention of full-time and part-time craftsmen as well as the trading of pubic shells (see Papuan Annual Report 1924-5, 1926: 44). We can also note that several New Guinea gourd and bamboo specimens were carefully mended (plate 4) by stitching or lashing with bast string across the break (and see Sande 1907: 438; Fischer 1913: 48). For the Dani it is reported that if the tip of the sheath is broken, the end is carefully closed with a wedge or the sheath is adapted for use in a shorter form. 'If the base is broken, the gourd will be replaced, but the broken pieces put to the side for possible future use' (Heider 1969: 386-7). That the mending of sheaths is not confined to New Guinea is shown by a mended example in the British Museum (No. 1951 Af. 12.77) from the Kaleri of Nigeria. It could be argued that to mend a sheath might imply no more than the existence of a favourite article of clothing but it is also worth- while, as Le Roux has suggested (1948: 139), con- sidering that there may also be economic factors influencing these practices. In parts of South Africa droughts and extreme sun-scorching are often responsible for the failure of gourd germination, and this is reflected in the refusal to part with gourd sheaths even to traders offering high rewards (Louw 1938: 63). The literature concerning the economic importance of penis confinement equipment is virtually non-existent, the outstanding exception being Pospisil's account of the Kapauku of New Guinea (Pospisil 1963a). From this account we learn that penis sheath gourds are grown in plots scattered through different gardens on the valley floor; on the other hand amongst 42</page><page sequence="22">tlhe Dani it appears that the gourds are grown in gardens in or near the village compounds (Heider 1969: 386; Gardner &amp; Heider 1969: 28). Amongst the Kapauku the area of gourd cultivation is small and this crop has little significance for general crop rotation; as compared with banana and sugar cane cultivation its significance is minimal, the area specially planted with gourds being 0-014 per cent. of the total area under cultivation (Pospisil 1963a: table 13, 297). The sowing of the gourds is undertaken by both males and females, whereas responsibility for weeding rests with the women. Only the males select the gourds and decide which are suitable for penis sheathing and it is also the men who are exclusively concerned with all stages of their manufacture (Pospisil 1963a: 286). Kapauku sheaths are owned individually and never lent (Pospisil 1963a: 294, 349). Amongst the Dani, however, every male has his own extensive wardrobe and visitors may be given sheaths of particular shapes (Heider 1969: 387). As it ages the Kapauku gourd sheath acquires polish and an orange colour, both features being considered desirable qualities, and the life span of a gourd sheath is six months (Pospisil 1963a: 379). Kapauku gourd sheath manufacture must be considered a specialist activity, for half of the adult males had never made either a sheath or the rattan rings which encircle them (Pospisil 1963a: 299). At the same time the gourd sheath was one of the five most frequently traded objects. Within eight months some forty-six raw sheaths were traded in and out of one village. Thirteen sheaths were imported from other villages, five from kin and eight from strangers. Twenty-nine sheaths were exported from the same village, six to kin and twenty-three to strangers living in the Kamu valley. Five sheaths were sold to members of the same village, at a higher price than those to be obtained by import, and nine sheaths were given away as gifts (Pospisil 1963a: 347). In terms of general village income, therefore, the import and export of gourd penis sheaths has some considerable interest. It is also interesting to note that, as Pospisil says (1963a: 379) 'as in Western society, the expenditures for female costumes are painfully higher than those of the male'. Only with a detailed recording such as that carried out by Pospisil of all exchanges relevant to even the most apparently insignificant material objects can any meaningful picture of general economic activity be obtained. Methods of attachment It is clear that the morphology of the various sheath types will depend to a major extent not only on the techniques employed in their manufacture but also on their methods of attachment to the body. These methods may themselves have important conse- quences, for they will affect how readily such sheaths may be removed and the permanence or otherwise of such equipment may influence a people's own practice and hence bear some relationship to its economic significance. Methods of attachment will also influence the angles at which the sheaths are worn, a distinction which we have already seen to be some- times equated with a people's own cultural identity. These attachments may also have medical conse- quences and therefore be significant when we come to discuss the functions of these sheaths and they may also find reflection in some works of art (see below). Kynodesme. When the prepuce is to act as a sheath of the glans penis the simplest way of obtaining this is to bind the end of the prepuce over the glans, a practice we have already encountered in various North and South American tribes. This method also existed in ancient Greece where the cord for tying the prepuce was referred to as a kynodesme and is shown on several Greek vase paintings (plate 14) and Etruscan statuettes (e.g. British Museum No. BR 526; see Dingwall 1925; Stieda 1902; Hovorka 1893: 135-8 for other examples). A kynodesme must be removed for urination and copulation (see Stoll 1908: 464). Amongst the Coyabi of Brazil these are the only times when the foreskin is untied (Nimuendaju 1948a: 308) whereas among the Kaschibo of Peru the thread is changed every ten days or so (Tessmann 1930: 129). The wearing of a kynodesme of course does not in itself imply whether the penis should hang or be held vertical; both penis positions are found quite com- monly. Amongst the Karaja of Brazil it is reported that the foreskin is tied so tightly that the penis is partly forced back into the scrotum which has there- fore a three-pronged look about it with one prong protruding obliquely upwards (Krause 1911: 294). For the Karaja, Koenigswald (1908: 223) has argued that this custom leads to an artificial lengthening of the prepuce,14 while Steinen claims (1894: 193) for the Kulisehu of Brazil that there is a marked shortening of the penis as a result of this practice. Infibulation. The prepuce, as we have already seen, may also be fastened over the glans by means of a ring or clasp referred to in antiquity as a fibula. Celsus (VII, 25(3)) describes how infibulation was performed in the first century A.D., a practice confirmed by several Roman statues shown wearing rings. The prepuce was drawn forward and marks made on either side to show how far the prepuce could retract without revealing the glans. In cases where the glans was uncovered, holes were made at the places marked and threads inserted through them. When the hole has healed sufficiently, the thread was removed and a light fibula inserted in its place. Dingwall (1925: 58) records an episode said to date from 1822 to show the continued use of the fibula. Apparently a patient consulted a doctor Petroz; sometime previously the patient had fallen in love with a Portuguese woman with whom he lived for several years. He gradually discovered that she was exceedingly jealous. 'One morning before rising he suddenly felt a sharp prick in the region of the prepuce, and on making an examination he discovered to his amazement that he had been infibulated with a neat little gold clasp which 43</page><page sequence="23">had passed through the foreskin, closed quickly by means of a spring, and could only be opened by a little key which he found in the possession of the woman by his side ... he yielded to her entreaties and consented to wear the clasp, which was of course removed as occasion required. To his surprise one morning however he found that she had slipped a second one by the side of the first.... This continued for four to five years, till owing to their constant removal and reattachment, the state of his membrane was such that he was compelled to seek medical relief.' It seems from this account that infibulation with a clasp, and the same has been argued for the ring in- fibulation in antiquity (Stoll 1908: 494), allowed urination while preventing intercourse. Waist belt. When the penis is to be held in a vertical position and the glans sheathed, the foreskin is often pulled over the glans and jammed under a hip or waist belt. In some cases this may involve quite a struggle: amongst the Marind-Anim the waist belt under which the prepuce is held must be so tight that it can only be put on with a great amount of wriggling, the greasing of the buttocks and the help of four other people (Baal 1966: 157). -It has been claimed (e.g. Dingwall 1925), although the supporting evidence is not known, that this practice may also greatly elongate the prepuce. Amongst several other people, however, the penis is only placed under the girdle from time to time (see W. New Guinea Expedition 1904-5, 1908); amongst the Tugere of New Guinea only when they happen to meet a woman (Sande 1907: 91), and amongst the Jiravo of Peru, who normally wear loin- cloths but who also carry the necessary girdle around with them, only when they swim (Karsten 1935: 453). In cases where the glans or penis is confined by being placed inside a manufactured sheath, the method of attachment may consist either 1) of jamming the prepuce, or scrotal skin, or organ into the sheath, 2) of placing a wrapper around the organ, or 3) of fastening the sheath to the body by means of one or more cords. In cases when it is the prepuce that is jammed into the sheath this can be seen as an alter- native method for fastening the prepuce in such a way that it sheaths the glans (see Beidelman 1966: 397). The particular method chosen will greatly influence not only the ease of removal of the sheath for such necessities as urination but also the angle at which the penis and sheath are held. Frictional adhesion. There are various different ways of achieving adhesion by the first method, the most common depending primarily on the smallness of the hole into which the prepuce and/or penis is inserted. From study of museum specimens it can be said that the diameters of these holes appear to be strikingly uniform according to sheath type and thus can be said to characterise particular sheath-wearing peoples. Whether these measurements reflect any physical differences in the penis sizes of different populations cannot, at this time, be established, but some observers (e.g. Miklucho-Mackay 1878: 114-15) have commented on supposed differences of this kind. It is relevant to note that in modern Western sheathing practices the standard diameter of the sheath aperture is 3.5 cm., this having been reduced from some 6-7-5 cm. diameter in the eighteenth century to ensure that the contraceptive remains in place at least during detumescence; meanwhile the stretching qualities of the sheaths have of course been improved (personal communication, E. C. Corderoy, London Rubber Industries Ltd). The same principle of frictional adhesion still demands a small sheath aperture. In any case the closeness of the fit between penis and sheath aperture is clear from accounts describing the insertion of the penis into the sheath among several scattered New Guinea peoples who do so with the aid of a thin stick or spatula, made sometimes from pig's tusk, more or less as a shoe horn is used in Europe today; the spatula, being considered an essential accessory to the sheath, is worn in the hair for easy accessibility (Chinnery n.d.: 51; Friederici 1912: 155; Kelm 1966: 160; Sande 1907: 92). There is contradictory evidence regarding the results of this first method of attaching sheaths, some authors stress- ing that sheaths nevertheless easily drop off, others maintaining that they are so firmly fixed in place that (in New Guinea) the wearers are free to jump and dance (e.g. Sande 1907: 93), and others stressing that for South African tribes a projecting metal shank (see plate 11) facilitates removal of the sheath (Barrow 1801: 213). Friederici (1912: 155) records a journey he made in New Guinea during which he noted that the sheaths became loosened when crossing water and regularly became filled. He describes how the sheaths had to be repeatedly taken off, emptied and replaced with the aid of a spatula, fresh leaves having been placed around the opening of the sheath. At each stop on a particular march, the spatula was taken out of the hair and a toilette performed. This reference to the effect of water on the fit of the sheath has been noted elsewhere, and the facts of their becoming easily filled with water is echoed from observations in South America (Nimuendaju 1924: 254). In the Admiralty Islands where shells are only worn during the war dance the attachment was obviously very tight indeed, for in the dance the penis swings upwards, to left and to right in a circle (Never- mann 1934: 111). The Taui islanders always carry their penis shells about in a small bag on the chest or threaded on a cord over the shoulder; on other Admiralty Islands they are carried in special net bags or on cords round various parts of the body (Never- mann 1934: 102, 111). To put on the shell sheath the foreskin is pulled over the glans and is clamped into the narrow aperture of the shell so that it nips the penis just behind the glans (Thilenius 1903: 129; Moseley 1876: 397). Nevermann (1934: 108) reports some variation in this practice for some males manage to get more of the penis actually into the shell whereas one individual, with an abnormally long penis, only inserted the foreskin. 44</page><page sequence="24">The physical consequences of wearing tight-fitting sheaths are rather obscure. We have already noted that conflicting evidence regarding the need of their removal for urination (see p. 28), but Thilenius (1903: 129-30) suggests that to wear shell sheaths for a long time results in a partial paralysis of the bladder muscles and he describes various attempts to urinate with them on. Different authors vary in their esti- mates of how much compression of the penis is involved in wearing a penis shell, but several (e.g. Thilenius 1903: 129; Reclus 1879: 197) maintain that the penis becomes either flattened and/or elongated by the weight of the shell. In one particular New Guinea case, the wearing of gourd sheaths is claimed to have resulted in a great elongation of the foreskin, sometimes to twice its original length (Zuid-West Nieuw-Guinea-Expeditie 1904-5, 1908). There are also conflicting reports about the use of green leaves to protect the penis from the sharp edges of tight- fitting sheaths (e.g. Finsch 1914: 325; Sande 1907: 93). For the Admiralty Islands, Moseley (1876: 379) remarks on the supposed flattening of the glans, the general swelling of the penis, the impossibility of erection while such a sheath is worn and the painful sharp edges of the shell aperture. In support of some of these observations there is evidence in the Admiralty Islands of ulcerations of the penis caused by pushing it into the narrow shell opening. During some war dances men remove their penis shells from time to time, turning their backs to the crowd, apparently because of the pain of wearing them. Nevermann (1934: 110) also records the observation made by Kramer of one man having great difficulty in removing his penis shell after a dance, finally succeeding by jumping into the water. Much the same sort of observation exists for the Lawo of New Guinea who are said to have inflamed penis tips, chaffed skin and generally enlarged penes, all caused by the pressure of their gourd sheaths (Neuhauss 1911: 197). The distinctive Mimika bamboo sheaths also depend on the closeness of their fit and they are so designed that they can only be put on in one standard way with the result that they are always worn verti- cally (plate 15). The penis is inserted about three-quarters along the way of the cylinder shaft into a small hole of 2-6 to 4 cm. diameter which has either been cut in the side of the cylinder or is a continuation of the half cylinder. The prepuce is then pulled far forwards to penetrate a hole of 1 2 to 1 8 cm. diameter pierced through the node at the lower end of the cylinder, and the penis is thus held in flaccid position without any further attachment of the sheath to the body. Both the cut-out peak and the burnt and cut- out linear decorations are therefore visible; in the case of those cut into human shape the figures are worn upside down. A few exceptional specimens do not possess the normal pierced node; in one example in the University Museum at Cambridge (plate 9) the node is simply pierced by a small hole through which is threaded a knotted fibre, a device which could perhaps have served to allow the circumcised to wear this type of sheath. Jamming of the prepuce or penis through a narrow sheath aperture is also the basis of several African sheathing practices. The Zulu basketry sheath dangles at the end of the penis, held in position by the prepuce which has been forced through a hole of 1 6-2 5 cm. diameter (see Bryant 1949: 134). Many of the more typical South African basketry forms have a short cord running from the closed end of the sheath up to a hanging pubic covering (plate 16), a feature which may well explain the holes punched in the aluminium sheaths. Frobenius (1913: 322 sqq.) de- scribes the putting on of the basketry sheaths of the Tamberama of Togo; in this case the prepuce, which Frobenius claims to be exceptionally long, is first wetted with saliva and the penis is then pushed back into the scrotum. The freed foreskin is placed in the sheath aperture, the penis is released and 'like a bolt or spring-loaded corkstopper' it jerks forward and forces the wet foreskin far into the sheath in which it clings. The skin near the scrotum is hard against the sheath, thus keeping the prepuce and penis vertical in the sheath. This form of sheath is suitable only for the uncircumcised, but even so they fall off fairly easily. Much the same method of inserting the penis into the sheath is followed by the Namchi of the Volta Republic; according to Muraz (1932: 104) the penis is forced back into the skin of the scrotum and then allowed to spring into the sheath when released, a method which secures it firmly enough to hold it in place while walking. But the Namchi are unique in their method of placing the penis into its sheath, for they provide it with a protective fibre brush which surrounds it during its insertion (e.g. Leiris 1934: 66, note 3) (plate 17). The Bafia of East Cameroon, however, simply press the penis, claimed to be particularly short, into a grass sheath, with or without the foreskin pulled over the glans depending on whether the wearer is circumcised or not. Tessman (1934: 85) records that the success of the method is greater for those who are not circumcised but that these sheaths, which of course have to be removed for urination, often fall off when walking in long grass and the penis is then covered with a temporary tube of leaf. The plaited sheaths (see plate 1) worn by the different tribes of the Jos Plateau in Nigeria are dampened at the edges and given a slight twist after they are put on (Meek 1925: 41). The same problems of keeping sheaths both secure and comfortable confronted the Parantintin of Brazil who, exceptionally for the American continent, wore long manufactured sheaths made of leaves. These were made of some twelve leaves joined together to form a long cylinder of 25-40 cm. Although the Parantintin carefully selected smooth green leaves for this purpose and folded their borders so that they would be smooth and not hurt the skin, it is reported that youths wearing sheaths for the first time were incommoded by their new confinement and that the 45</page><page sequence="25">sheaths caused sores on the tip of the penis (Nimuen- daju 1924: 255). According to Freitas (1926: 68) to keep the sheaths securely attached the circumference of the prepuce was inflamed with the use of ants' teeth. Before use the sheaths were in the form of a rect- angular prism, but once the whole penis was inserted they adjusted to the skin to become cylindrical (Nimuendaju 1924: 254-5). They were removed for bathing and urination, a removal which could only be achieved when the cotton threads attaching the sheath to the penis are broken or untied (e.g. Nimuendaju 1924: 254; 1948b: 286). The penis cuffs of the Bororo of Brazil are attached by pulling the foreskin through the sheath opening (Levi-Strauss 1936: 294-6), a practice claimed by some (Steinen 1894: 193) to cause a certain shortening of the penis length. The simple Akwe Shavante leaf sheath is supposed to be worn more or less con- tinuously, except for urination and copulation, even while bathing. It is made moist in the mouth and is then pulled over the folds of the prepuce which have been drawn over the glans. However the difficulties in anchoring the sheath in this way are reflected by the Akwe-Shavante practice of employing small boys during initiation races especially to pick up the sheaths which inevitably fall off during any athletic activities (Maybury-Lewis 1967: 106). Amongst the Kayapo very similar sheaths also often fall off in public (personal communication, Terence Turner). The Tupari of Brazil adopt a slightly different method of attaching their sheaths, a method which nevertheless still depends on frictional adherence. As with the Karaja of Brazil (see p. 43), the penis is pushed back into the sub-cutaneous tissue of the pubis so that it gives the impress of a third testicle in the upper part of the scrotum. But in this case, the penis, even when walking or dancing, is permanently concealed by surrounding tissue, except when it is pushed out for urination or copulation. A fold of skin above the orifice is then squeezed between a strip at the back of the palm-leaf sheath and the main body of the sheath. This method, also, causes irritation of the skin; many Tupari, when they first adopt sheaths complain of the pain and intermittently adopt the practice of tying the prepuce instead of using their sheaths (Caspar 1952: 155; 1953: 207-9). Even when sheaths are attached to the glans/ prepuce/penis by friction this does not at all imply that they inevitably hang freely at the end of the penis. Thus in certain parts of New Guinea, for example, shells and nuts are perforated to hold strings which run either to a belt or directly round the waist (e.g. Murray 1918: 41), thus allowing the penis to be held in any position. Similar methods are attested for several South African tribes (e.g. Barrow 1801: 213), such as the Xhosa whose penis stalls are drawn up to the level of the waist band by means of a string (Bryant 1949: 135). However, as has been seen in the case of the Mimika, methods of attachment by friction may anchor the penis in a certain position through the sheath being jammed against the body (see plate 15). Similarly, the weight of the sheath may determine the position of the penis. Thus the weight of Sande's egg-shaped gourd type (see p. 40) forces the sharp end of the sheath forward so that the blunt end is supported behind and below the root of the penis right up against the scrotum, whereas the pear-shaped type is worn vertically (Sande 1907: 92). In these cases, as also for most of the other examples relying on a firm fit of the penis in the sheath, erection of the penis is more or less ruled out, for erection involves not only a change in the angle of the organ, but also an increase in its width and approximate doubling of its length, whatever its original dimen- sions (Morris 1969: 106; Masters &amp; Johnson 1966: 192). Cords. The method of tying the sheath to various parts of the body determines the angles at which the penis and sheath are held. In New Guinea such attachmient is achieved by fastening a cord either through holes made into the nut, shell or gourd sheath itself or under one or two bands encircling the base, top, or middle of the sheath. Such cords are fastened to different parts of the body, round the scrotum (or one testicle) waist, or shoulders (see Heider 1969: 387; Pospisil 1963a: 273). This method is also found outside New Guinea (see plate 18), for in one case reported among the Zaunde of East Cameroon the sheath is said to be so long that it has to be attached by a cord around the neck (Junger 1926: 107). Normally in New Guinea these attachments ensure that the gourd sheaths can easily be loosened and adjusted by moving the rattan or pandanus bands up or down the sheath (e.g. Neuhauss 1911: 147; Le Roux 1948: 143-4). The Pesegem, for example, have the gourd sheath resting on the scrotum at angles of 30? to 70? to the vertical, held in position by a band of twisted bark which is attached to the base of the gourd and runs round the hips (Nouhuys 1913: 14). In other New Guinea examples some gourd sheaths are so attached that they protrude horizontally, vertically or even downwards (plate 19) (Le Roux 1948: 140). Amongst some New Guinea peoples these adjustable sheaths are removed at night but amongst others such as the Pesegem they are worn in vertical positions while sleeping (Nouhuys 1913: 15; Le Roux 1948: 144). Wrappers. We have seen that the technique of tying the prepuce beyond the glans does not in itself predetermine whether the penis is held vertically or not. The same is true for the wearing of penis wrappers. In the Tanna Islands for example, such wrappers may reach some 44 cm. in length with a basal diameter of c. 5 cm. wound round the root of the penis, which is then held up in a waist band (Somerville 1894: 368). In New Caledonia (plate 20) such thick wrappers, with or without a second decoratively tied cloth, are sometimes allowed to hang freely (Speiser 1934: 138; 1919: 184-5; 1933: 189; Sarasin 1929: 156) and are sometimes attached to a string round the neck (see 46</page><page sequence="26">Cameron 1964: 229). There may, however, still be problems of anchoring the wrapper securely to the body; in Malekula the foreskin is slit longitudinally and rolled back so that it heals in thick ridges and therefore acts as an anchor for the wrapper (Somerville 1894: 368). When put on after circumcision rites, the wrapper is often lined with a dressing of medicated soft leaves (Layard 1942: 510). Such wrappers can apparently be removed without losing their original form (Sarasin 1929: 156). For Malekula, Layard records (1942: 42, 477) that the wrappers, made of banana leaf, are held vertically and tucked in and from behind a waist belt and that they are only removed for urination, performed in secrecy, or for washing, which is carried out while under water. In other cases it is reported that urination takes place with the wrapper still attached: ' . . . nor do they untie it when they want to make water, but piss through all and when done shake off what drops may hang to the coat' (see Cameron 1964: 229). Only in the case of the Pende of the Congo do we know of an example where the sheath, sometimes used together with paralysing drugs, is so designed never to be removed once put on. In one Pende group a metal ring is placed directly on the penis behind the glans to which is attached a piece of cloth onto which is sewn a short raffia sheath, bell-shaped at the end of the sexual organ. Urination takes place through a small hole at the end of the sheath (Sousberghe 1954: 215). Archaeological evidence. There are special problems confronting the study of sheathing practices of ancient Egypt, the prehistoric Cyclades (e.g. Zervos 1959: 253), the prehistoric Near East (e.g. Ucko 1968: 359) and those cultures only known from their rock art (e.g. Anati 1968: 75-6; Winkler 1938; 1939), for it is remarkably difficult to interpret the significance of many of the representations. With the exception of the evidence from Egypt which includes not only representations but also pre-dynastic burials from Naga-ed-Der and a particular New Kingdom text, all that can be said is that sheaths were worn, without being able to specify the types of sheaths or how they were put on and attached to the body. Egypt. This review of the Egyptian evidence at least can start with direct evidence, for some fifty adult males were buried at Naga-ed-Der wearing 'protective pouches' made from a variety of materials: 'cloth', linen, leather, soft skin with hair on it. Even with this direct evidence the details of how these sheaths were worn are not entirely clear but it seems that there may have been at least two sheath types worn by the inhabitants of Naga-ed-Der both held up by various cords to a waist belt: a long tube which fitted onto the penis with a pouch to cover the testicles and a penis wrapper of some 13 cm. length (see Ucko 1967: 351-3). Contrary to Baumgartel's statement (1960: 69) several pre-dynastic carved male figurines are shown wearing recognisable sheaths attached to a waist belt, and others are shown with a protrusion which can be interpreted either as a sheath or as the penis itself considerably enlarged. Now that the evidence from Naga-ed-Der is known, there is little reason against accepting these also as representations of sheaths, the absence of belts being either due to artistic convention or reflecting actual technological variety. Sheaths are represented on figurines from both the Amratian and Gerzean period (e.g. Ucko 1968: 75-80, 97 and No. 18), and probably also on several Gerzean vase paintings. An ivory figure from Mahasna (Ucko 1967: 353; 1968: 97) probably shows the existence of long sheaths not unlike gourd types in use in New Guinea today. These excavated male representations are similar, in being sheathed, to sev- eral bought figurines the pre-dynastic date of which is questionable (Ucko 1965). These in turn are very different from other bought figurines, the authenticity of which is still to be proved, shown with erect, semi- erect and flaccid uncovered penes (Ucko &amp; Hodges 1963).15 Bought ivory figurines resemble excavated male figurihes from Hierakonpolis and Abydos, some having 'simple' sheaths extending from the navel region to the top of the leg separation and others having 'complex' sheaths, shaped in various ways often including two lateral projections at the level of the testicles, extending from a waist belt quite far down the body (Ucko 1965). The sheaths of these latter figures are closely similar to a bought basalt statue (e.g. Aldred 1949: pl. 1) the date of which is also obscure. The sheath represented upon it has been claimed to have been made from metal or wood (Naville 1900: 68), but is more likely to have been constructed of skin or leather (Luschan 1901: 197; Bates 1914: 123). Some of the Hierakonpolis and Abydos figures may, or may not date from the Proto-Dynastic period (Ucko 1965; Kemp 1968: 153) as also do several ceremonial palettes which sometimes have sheathed figures represented on them. On the Narmer Palette are shown some figures apparently circumcised, as was also true of some of the Naga-ed-Der individuals, and others wearing sheaths. Equally clear are the sheaths shown on the individuals being trampled by a bull on the Louvre Palette, and there are other possible examples on palettes in the Ashmolean and British Museums. The use of sheaths is also attested in representations of the Old Kingdom (e.g. Fischer 1961: 68; Jequier 1938: 13; Bates 1914: 122; Holscher 1955: 27; Borchardt 1913: 12). It is in the Vth Dynasty (c. 2565-2420 B.c.) that we find a representation of a woman wearing what on a male would undoubtedly be interpreted as a penis sheath.16 This representation has received various interpretations, the first based on the supposition that the original meaning of this 'sheath' must have been forgotten since the time when it was used by males (see above) and the second that to wear a 'sheath' was a visible indication of male status (e.g. Bates 1914: 113; Newberry 1915: 102). This is not the only known example of women wearing what morphologically appear to be sheaths, for among 47</page><page sequence="27">the Sara of Chad, women wear an object shaped like a sheath called a gol, which is fitted so that it presses on the vulva and anus either by being attached at the anal end to a waist belt or by being actually forced into the anus. The gol, made of vegetable fibres, is normal female wear being washed several times each day and being renewed about every six months (Muraz 1932: 109-10). There is no doubt that the sheath was also worn in the Middle Kingdom (c. 2134-1786 B.C.) and it is from the Dynasty XII tomb of Senbi at Meir that we have the only representation showing how the sheath was fitted. As far as it is possible to interpret this representation it seems that the vertical penis was inserted into a tubular sheath which was tucked behind and under a belt and which then hung down in a wide flap over the pubic region (see Blackman 1914: 31 and fig. 7). Also from the Middle Kingdom are several other probable representations of sheaths but these are very difficult to distinguish clearly from various types of kilts, many of which are apparently adorned with tassels and hanging appendages (see e.g. Fischer 1961: 73-4; Bates 1914: 122 sq.). In the New Kingdom (c. 1570-1086 B.C.) there is clear evidence that some of the enemies of Egypt, such as the Tehenu, Meshwesh and possibly Nubians, wore sheaths, sometimes attached to a separate waist belt and sometimes apparently looped and forming part of the belt under which it is tucked (see Bates 1914: 122-4). But the most definite evidence of sheath- wearing in Egypt is the representation of a deity (see below), for most of the - other possible Egyptian examples are difficult to distinguish clearly from complex kilt types (see Bates 1914: 122 sqq.; Fischer 1961: 74). Unfortunately, despite numerous attempts, it is not possible to make out accurately the details of the sheathing practices of the Minoans shown in some Egyptian representations (see Evans 1925: 20-1; Evans 1928: 736-9; Pendlebury 1939: 223; Davies 1943: 24-5), nor can much be said from Minoan works themselves (but see Evans 1921: 35 note; Evans 1925; 20-1; Evans 1930: 182; Evans 1935: 22-3, 28; Hutchinson 1962: 110-11; Myres 1902-3: 363-4; Pendlebury 1939: 117, 268). There is, however, textual evidence about the sheaths of other peoples. Normal Egyptian practice was to cut off the hands of enemies slain in war so that accurate counts could be made after a battle, but in a text about the battles of Merneptah against the Libu and Sea Peoples it is said that in some cases they cut off the phalli. These phalli are said to have kernata, a foreign word (used only in two Egyptian texts) which is often taken to mean sheath (see e.g. Naville 1900: 68) but which, it has also been argued (partly on linguistic grounds) could equally well mean prepuce (see e.g. Holscher 1955: 43-5; Bates 1914: 122-4). Accepting the latter argument, Egyptian practice would have been to cut off the hands of those enemies who were circumcised and to cut off the phalli of the uncircumcised. If this is the correct interpretation, it would mean that we still do not know the Egyptian word for penis sheath, although it has been suggested that there was such a word used in connexion with priests whose duties included the clothing of god and king (Grdseloff 1943: 357-66). Actual depictions of Merneptah's battles, as well as the later ones of Rameses III, show actual heaps of hands and phalli with testicles, and the bodies shown appear to have either hands or un- sheathed penes. By the time of Rameses IlI the word kernata clearly referred to the phallus and not merely the foreskin if the evidence from the representations can be accepted. This is perhaps the major reason against accepting the equation between foreskin and kernata, but it should be noted that similar extensions of meaning occur in Hebrew for the Semitic word which kernata represents.17 There is no good evidence for the use of sheaths in Egypt after the New Kingdom and classical authors make no mention of them. The few claims for their existence at this period apparently rest on depictions in Late papyri which are impossible to interpret with any degree of certainty. Ethology. We have seen several ways in which techniques and methods of attachment influence or determine the angles at which penis sheaths and/or the penis are held. Morris (apparently basing himself on Wickler (1966: 430-3), has recently claimed (1969: 100) that 'status sex' is concerned with dominance display and that one rule about dominance is that it involves the clear display of 'trappings, postures and gestures of dominance'. In Morris's view, phallic symbolism is often cryptic but amongst New Guinea tribesmen it is direct and overt; the greater the erection the greater the degree of threat involved (Morris 1969: 106). In fact, as we have seen, it is clear that different cultures have different penis confinement fashions, which have their own implications regarding sheath angle. There is absolutely no evidence to support a claim that a people who normally wear their sheaths dangling at the end of flaccid penes are therefore less dominant or aggressive than a people who normally have the sheath held more vertically. To consider Morris's thesis seriously, it must be discussed in terms of intra-cultural variations; in a situation such as that which operates among the Bafia of East Cameroon, where the correct angle of the small sheath placed on the end of the penis is said to be of as much concern as are the trouser creases of the modern European (Tessmann 1934: 92-92), it is well worth looking for any evidence to support a correlation between angle chosen and particular personality. In the Bafia case, although the 'most magnificent' sheaths are worn by 'very strong men', this does not seem to be correlated with the sheath angle or length of sheath protrusion but instead with width, weight and a particular decoration incorporating nowadays the top of a smelling-salts bottle. Particular sheath types are always worn in particular ways, aslant and upwards or aslant and to the right. In New Caledonia, penis wrappers are sometimes left to hang down and some- 48</page><page sequence="28">times, often on feast days, worn tucked up to the belt (Speiser 1933: 189) but there is no evidence to suggest any correlation of the kind suggested by Morris. For the Dani, the New Guinea people to whom Morris refers, who have a wide variety of shaped sheaths from which to choose, it is categorically stated that the gourd sheath 'is not, in any explicit way, a focus of Dani sexuality or eroticism' and that there is no obvious correlation between sheath shape or decor- ation with status or personality (Heider 1969: 387-8). In fact, Wickler's (1966) interpretation is partly different from that advanced by Morris; human sheathing of the penis corresponds to territorial 'guard sitting' by baboons and vervet monkeys whereby these animals sit, with their backs to the remainder of their group members, with thighs opened so that the extended or erect penis is clearly visible. To support his interpretation, Wickler stresses the ornamentation and appendages of human sheaths and he maintains that, although penis sheathing varies from village to village, it is always uniform within a village. As has already been seen, such uniformity does not in fact exist and the social contexts of sheathing practices are much more complex than anything suggested by Wickler (see below). Overt explanation To date there has been little evidence to explain the morphological variety of sheathing practices reviewed, and it is time to approach this material from a wider functional point of view. An obvious starting point would be the statements and explanations given by the people who practise penis confinement but, in the ethnographic context, such statements are to a large extent absent from the literature. What we find instead are either simple explanatory generalisations on the part of the ethnographer or wide ranging schemes concerned with the evolution of clothing. It is often impossible to distinguish between what is the ethnographer's conclusion and what is direct reporting of a people's explanatory statements. In this situation, it becomes necessary to concentrate on several different levels of analysis: the directly observed practice, the social context of penis confinement and the identity of the sheath wearer. Finally, it will be necessary to consider the evidence from myth, ritual and art to complete this investigation into the sig- nificance of sheathing practices. In view of the paucity of direct ethnographic information, it is essential to search for as wide a range of explanations as possible against which to test observed ethnographic practices (see Ucko &amp; Rosenfeld 1967: 150-8). The clearest statements about the function of the wearing of sheaths come from modern western cultures, an area of information which should not be ignored, for, as already noted, we are dealing with a human activity which is allowed only a limited range of possibilities. In Britain today, as is well known, the male sheath is primarily a contraceptive, devised so as to fit so tightly on to the penis that it cannot come off during sexual intercourse and which is made so that it is strong enough to contain ejaculated semen. Such contraceptive sheaths were already on sale in different sizes and packed in different coloured wrappers by th-e eighteenth century (see Finch &amp; Green 1963: 51-2), and in 1970 there are several sheath types available on the market, all with the same primary contraceptive aim. These modern examples vary in colour, shape, lubrication and thick- ness. The variety of colour and lubrication is aimed at simulating the natural state with a view to attracting buyers; the different shapes aim at increasing the stimulation of either the female or the male by the use of protruding appendages or restricted coverage; different thicknesses aim at deferring or hastening moments of climax. These modern European sheaths focus attention on the multiplicity and variety of functions that a sheath may fulfil at one and the same time. Furthermore they raise the question whether other sheaths are in fact acting as contraceptive devices, not necessarily through being worn during sexual intercourse, but perhaps by preventing erections or at least by delaying orgasms. Contraception. Ethnographically, the most explicit case of a sheath acting as a contraceptive device is that of the Nioka chief, mentioned previously, who after certain ritual activities is tabooed for the rest of his life from sexual intercourse. To ensure that the taboo is not violated, for this would bring great misfortune to all his people, the chief's sheath is fastened by knots behind his back and these knots are inspected every day (Sousberghe 1954: 214-19). Less explicitly perhaps, virtually all the confinement practices which have been reviewed on previous pages do, as claimed by Gerson (1919: 25), make erection either impossible or painful, for during erection the penis not only changes angle but becomes considerably longer and thicker. There is also evidence that certain ethnographic penis confinement practices may have dire physical consequences; for example, Sorenson and Gadjusek (1966: 159, 161) remark that when the erect penis is artificially held between the thighs 'violent sexual activity is required by men and youths to achieve a response'. There are however virtually no explicit statements by sheath wearers to suggest that contraception or the prevention of erection are primary aims of penis confinement. One exception is the case of the Thonga, for Junod records (1927: 95) that one of their explicit comments on the sheath is that it is an aid to continence, those not wearing sheaths being accused of being immoral adulterers. It is quite possible, although there is nothing in the literature to confirm such a view, that such an attitude also exists among other peoples.18 Another explicitly sexual aim of penis confinement is that recorded by the ancient Romans. Infibulation, it is clear from Martial (VI, 82) and Juvenal (Satires VI, 73, and VI, 379), was primarily practised to prevent any sexual activity by actors and musicians for, according to Roman and also much later accepted 49</page><page sequence="29">belief, any form of sexual activity detracts from general physical wellbeing and particularly harms the qualities of the voice. Such infibulation, it is clear, in no way lessened the physical attraction of some of these actors and singers in the view of several Roman ladies. In some small-scale societies the belief exists that sexual activity leads to a diminution of male power, and particular male activities are therefore often surrounded by sexual taboos. The use of penis sheaths might be associated with such a belief although there is no evidence to suggest, except in the Classical and Nioka cases, that sheaths were especially adopted for the performance of particularly male activities.'9 Nevertheless it is worthwhile noting the view that, for several different reasons, genital excretions, and in particular those connected with procreation, are 'pollution-worthy' (Douglas 1966: 125). Disease. European sheaths were not always simply contraceptives for, already in the sixteenth century, their function was primarily protective against disease (e.g. see Finch &amp; Green 1963: 48). Several claims exist that disease, and particularly bilharzia, was the primary cause for the adoption of sheaths both ethnographically and in antiquity, but there is no good evidence to support this view (see Dingwall 1925 for bibliographical references). Ethnographically, only the Bafia of East Cameroon give an explanation for the use of their present-day palm leaf sheaths which is explicitly medical (Tessmann 1934: 82-5). They maintain that they switched from the use of skin or gourd sheaths to their present small fibre sheaths so that their women could tell whether or not a man had a genital disease. In fact the value of this explicit rationale is highly questionable, for the present Bafia sheaths do, in fact, serve to camouflage any such genital afflictions. Tessmann records that he hoped to add the sheath of a certain prisoner to his collection, but that when the 'prisoner . .. was made to remove his sheath . . . the discharge of gonorrhoea flowed out . . . ' and Tessmann decided against including this particular specimen in his collection (1934: 85). Codpiece. When we proceed even further back into European history we find the use of the codpiece, likened by many authorities to ethnographic penis confinement practices. There is surprisingly little known about the details of the origin of this form of clothing, but there seems little doubt that in the late fourteenth century, when it was invented, the codpiece was considered by the authorities as an essential item to ensure decorum at a time when jerkin and doublet were becoming shorter and hose were tighter (see Rudeck 1897: 45; Binder 1958: 200-1). In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the codpiece became not only an item of obtrusive display and fun, often simulating the sexual organ (see Laver 1951: 8), but also part of recognised armoury and a visible sign of cultural allegiance (see above). That the codpiece was at this time a means of display is shown by the fact that it was often stiffened and padded and frequently decorated with embroidery or with bows (see Linthicum 1936: 204; Binder 1958: 164), all features which directed the observer's eyes to this area of the body. At this time codpieces were often used as containers for handkerchiefs, purses and napkins, anid it is recorded that on some occasions meni even secreted spoons or oranges within this item of their clothing (see e.g. Boehn 1923: 107; Cunnington &amp; Cunnington 1954: 118). The excesses of this form of dress are superbly recorded by Rabelais in his The history of Gargantua and Pantagruel: 'His codpiece took 241 yards of the same stuff; and its shape was that of a bowed arch, well and gallantly fastened by two fine old buckles with two enamelled clasps, in each of which was set a huge emerald, the size of an orange. For this fruit has an erective virtue, and is encouraging to the natural member. The vent of the codpiece ... slashed like his hose, with a blue damask puffing out in the same way.... (with) fine wire-thread embroidery and ... charming platting.... For it was always brave, sappy, and moist, always green, always flourishing, always fructifying, full of humours, full of flowers, full of fruit, full of every delight. I swear to God it was a pleasure to look at! . . . Not only was it long and capacious, but well furnished within and well victualled, having no resemblance to the fraudulent codpieces of so many young gentlemen which contain nothing but wind, to the great disappointment of the female sex.' Already in the sixteenth century women had adopted clothing which partially reflected this male item, and any woman who wished to disguise herself as a man was more or less bound to wear the codpiece. In this way Julia in Shakespeare's Two gentlemen of Verona (Act II, scene 7, line 53), when discussing with her waiting woman Lucetta how best to disguise herself as a page, is advised by her that to make her disguise effective 'You must needs have them with a cod-piece, Madam', to which she replies . . . 'that will be ill-favoured', but is warned that 'a round hose, Madam, now's not worth a pin, unless you have a cod-piece to stick pins on'. In the seventeenth century the use of the codpiece, except in country areas, became rarer and rarer, for breeches were then separately buttoned or tied (see Cunnington 1954: 122) until, eventually, they became obsolete, and reproductions of the works of Holbein and others had this item of dress removed from them. This brief- review may serve to introduce the question whether the use of sheaths as recorded in ethnography fall within the shame or the display aspect of clothing and it suggests the possibility of the sheath as either a protective device or as a container for miscellanea. It also stresses that one item of dress may come to epitomise the male sex and may therefore, in an ethnographic context, be especially suitable for certain ritual, and especially transvestite, activities. Shame and display: naked and nude Much of the secondary literature referring to sheathing practices has been primarily concerned with the history and development of clothing (see Benedict 50</page><page sequence="30">1951). By far the most common view has been that an instinctive fear, or shame, about the genital area led to the adoption of clothing which therefore consisted, in its earliest form, of a covering of the genitals. The opposite view, that feelings of modesty derive from the use of clothing has been rejected because the feelings exist amongst peoples who wear nothing at all. Other suggestions about the origin of clothing have isolated such factors as the cold or the need for protection against either natural dangers or spiritual powers. It is the distinction between shame and display which has greatly concerned many of the authorities writing on primitive sheathing practices for, to many of them, there seems an inherent contradiction be- tween the idea of shameful concealment of the genitals and the form and dimensions of some of the sheaths. It is necessary here to widen our investi- gation to consider exactly what is meant by the use of. the terms 'naked', 'nude' and 'shame'. Beidelman (1968: 115) has recently accepted and made use of the distinction originally proposed by Sir Kenneth Clark (1956) whereby nudity is taken to refer to a state of being unclothed without any associated feeling of embarrassment or shame, whereas to be naked signifies a state of embarrassment or even dread (see Rivers 1914: 43). If we accept this distinction for the moment we find, as already noted from the mor- phology of sheath types, that no feelings of modesty are associated with the unclothed scrotum or testicles amongst the vast majority of penis sheath wearers. There is also considerable evidence that to many peoples who confine the penis it is not the exposure of the penis itself which is a sign of nakedness, but the exposure of the glans (see e.g. Bryant 1949: 125; Speiser 1923: 70). It is this distinction between nudity and the naked glans which formed the basis of several of the theories of cultural relationships, incursions, and invasions reviewed previously (see pp. 32-36 above). For those who tried to trace the influences of different Melanesian immigrant populations it was assumed that feelings of being naked were derived from the practices of circumcision and the consequent exposure of the glans (e.g. Speiser 1934: 136-9). Unfortunately, the literature is in general too poor to be able to talk about the attitudes to various parts of the genitals in any detail (see also Beidelman 1968: 122, note 2), but we do know that the situation is vastly more complex than is suggested in the works of Speiser and others. In New Guinea, for example, the Sohur are exceptional in associating shame with both the penis and the scrotum whereas amongst the Marind-Anim shame is focused on the prepuce (Nevermann 1940: 175). It is also necessary to stress that feelings of shame are not necessarily focused on the genitals at all for, amongst several peoples, they are concentrated instead on the anal region; even when the penis has been incised (e.g. Friederici 1912: 159-60). In several cases it is defecation and not urination which must be undertaken in strict privacy. The extremes of attitudes to nakedness are well brought out by Sorenson and Gajdusek (1966) for New Guinea where, for example, the Awa wear several thicknesses of skirts to avoid ever having to appear unclothed even in wholly male company. It is clear, however, that most penis sheathing peoples do, in certain circumstances, consider themselves to be naked when deprived of their penis sheaths. The intellectual distinction between nude and naked has been quite a useful one (see Beidelman's (1966) analysis of the Swazi king as denuded of status and as a solitary figure) but in many ways the point made by St Augustine in The City of God against the Pagans (IV, Bk. 14, XVII) is even more important. According to St Augustine's view, the pubic parts only became shameful after man's first sin so that before this time, as stated in Genesis (II, 25), 'they were both naked, and were not ashamed'. 'And the reason for this is not that they were unaware of their nakedness, but that this nakedness was not yet base.' When grace was lost 'there came to be in the action of the body a certain shameless novelty, and thereafter nudity was indecent. It drew their attention and made them embarrassed.' The importance of this statement is that it focuses attention on the fact that shame regarding undress is dependent not merely on what happens to be worn in a particular society but on the particular social contexts under consideration. In other words, it may not be embarrassing to be seen without a sheath in certain situations but in other social contexts to be without a sheath may be acutely distasteful. When we turn to sheathing practices recorded in ethnography we see the immediate utility of this approach. Firstly, on the cross-cultural level we find that what is considered appropriate dress for a certain situation is inappropriate in another culture. Thus, amongst the Namchi of the Cameroons and several nortbern Nigerian tribes, the penis sheath is removed before burial (Leiris 1934: 66, note 3; Meek 1925: 116), whilst among other sheath wearers, such as the Gurma of the Upper Volta, correct burial rites demand the wearing of a penis sheath (Froelich 1949: 110, 178). Amongst the LoDagaa of Ghana, the corpse of an unmarried man is buried with the penis tied under the waist belt, the practice of young boys, thus symbolising the shame of never having become a husband (Goody 1962: 84). Secondly within a particular culture the uncovered penis or glans only causes shame in certain situations; amongst the Seka and Bangu-Anim of New Guinea (e.g. Wirz 1928: 145) only when women are around, amongst the Remo of Peru only when in public (Zerries 1964: 119), and amongst several South African tribes only when an unexpected visitor calls at the house or when crossing water (e.g. Vaillant 1796: 362). Similarly we also find, for example in the New Hebrides (Speiser 1923: 70) that to be unsheathed, and thus to expose the glans, is not shameful when performing certain activities such as planting or, amongst the Dani of New Guinea (Heider 1969: 383) 51</page><page sequence="31">when doing particularly muddy work. In other social situations all these people would consider it shameful to be without one's sheath. Where there is shame associated with being naked this takes different forms in different societies. Amongst the Urubu of Brazil, for example, the tying of the prepuce seems to be a straightforward matter of embarrassment, for those who are not yet old enough to tie up the prepuce but who are, nevertheless, conscious of the size of their organs, cover the penis with their hands, and, in general, any adult who was seen without his sheath would die of shame (Huxley 1957: 142-3). This same theme of shame finds expression in Urubu myth together with an implication of strength associated with the glans (Huxley 1957: 241, 249, 261). To be ashamed of being seen without one's sheath is true of many sheath wearers in all parts of the world. As Huxley and Cope (1965: 20) have put it with specific reference to the Amahuaca of Peru, to appear without one's sheath 'is as embarrassing as for a New Yorker to discover himself bare-bottomed in Times Square'. In extreme cases such modesty extends even to situations where a group of people are bathing together (see e.g. the Parintintin (Nimuendaju 1948: 290)) and may even result in the sheath being removed only when under water (e.g. Von Koenigswald 1908: 223). The Brazilian Tupari, who do not remove their sheaths even for bathing, consider Europeans who bathe in the nude and neighbouring tribes who are reputedly nude all the time, as similar to tapirs and monkeys (Casper 1952: 156; 1953: 209; Levi-Strauss 1969: 266). Amongst the Gaika of South Africa an individual who exposes himself without his sheath is subject to a specific fine (Maclean 1858: 126) whilst amongst the Dani of New Guinea sexual modesty is the only explicit reason given by the people themselves for the use of their gourd sheaths which are put on while carefully turning their backs on any other people present (Heider 1969: 387). It is interesting to note in this connexion that many sheath wearers when forced to remove their sheaths for urination adopt a squatting posture. The correlation between being naked and feeling shame is, however, not as straightforward as it may so far appear to be. For example (Frobenius 1913: 323) points out that among the Tamberama of the Upper Volta only some men actually wear a sheath and no shame is shown by the non-sheath wearers. Furthermore little fuss is made when a sheath needs readjustment, a not infrequent occurrence, and for dancing the sheaths are often removed without embarrassment, either by the man himself or by his female partner. Similarly in parts of New Guinea it is not exceptional for the sheath to become detached while walking (see above), in which case the person concerned simply walks away and adjusts his covering (Neuhauss 1911: 196). In other New Guinea cases, as for example amongst the Pesegem, when the sheath comes off, a temporary covering of leaves is applied (Nouhuys 1913: 14). It is also important to note that to feel shame is not always simply a matter of being totally unclothed, for penis sheaths are some- times worn, as was the case with codpieces, with the Classical Maori and in the Himalayas still today, with many other items of body covering. Furthermore, embarrassment may be caused just as much by the wearing of the 'incorrect' form of dress as by the uncovering of a particular part of the body. Thus, we have already noted the case of the Bafia where the correct positioning and angle of the sheath worn is a matter of great concern, and we must also remember the great number of cases recorded where the European custom of wearing trousers, although covering both penis and anus, is considered highly indecent. As Beidelman remarks (1968: 123) for the Nuer 'it is not the sight of the genitalia in itself which is thought to cause injury so much as the disrespect in not observing the convention'-although the Nuer now wear shorts 'they continue to wear as well over them . .. the wild cat's fur traditionally worn'. Almost all that has been said with regard to feelings of shame and the wearing of penis sheaths applies equally well to people who do not wear sheaths. As Malinowski wrote for the Trobriand Islanders, who wear a pubic leaf: 'It is bad, shameful and ludicrous in a degrading sense not to conceal, carefully and properly, those parts of the human body which should be covered by dress. . . . However when it is necessary for practical reasons for males to take off the pubic leaf, as during the fishing or diving activities, this is done without either false shame or the slightest symptom of improper interest. The natives convey clearly by behaviour and comment that nakedness is not shameful when it is necessary, but becomes so when due to carelessness or lewdness' (Malinowski 1929: 53, 255, 379, 380). We must return here to the starting point of this particular discussion, for there can be no doubt that many of the sheathing practices, with their associated beliefs of impropriety and shame, are nevertheless striking and noticeable. As Koch-Gruneberg (1910: 89) and many others have said, penis sheaths can hardly be adopted because of shame about the genitals if they are painted and adorned with tassels. Similarly, Sande has argued (1970: 39) that New Guinea gourd sheaths, however much they in fact hide, must be instrumental in focusing attention on the sexual area and possibly in accentuating virility. Support for the view that sheathing practices are part of display activity comes not only from the ethologists (see above) and from the elaboration of some of the practices themselves but also from some hints, as for example those by Frobenius (1913: 324), that it is pre- dominantly the young boys rather than the old men who wear sheaths. In the context of display the parallel has often been drawn between ethnographic sheathing practices and the historic European cod- pieces whose history, development and blatantly exaggerated nature, have been shortly reviewed above. 52</page><page sequence="32">This display factor becomes explicit in the dances of, for example, the Tamberama of the Upper Volta, for their dancing sheaths are larger and more noticeable than are those worn for everyday activities (Frobenius 1913: 324). The same interpretation can be offered for many of the decorations on, and carved shapes of, several South African sheaths. We have already noted several seemingly flamboyant examples of New Guinea gourd sheaths as well as the use of appendages and fur, all of which could be associated with display. In New Caledonia the norm is a simple penis wrapper but on feast days specially painted examples are worn which have wider bases and are curved round to the top (e.g. Speiser 1919: 166; Sarasin 1929: 156); here again, we must accept a display element. In the case of the Admiralty Islands, as we have already seen, penis shells are carried about all the time but are only worn for war or dancing; the islanders are otherwise nude. It is impossible to reject the suggestion that we are dealing with phallic display and decoration (see e.g. Thilenius 1903: 129-30; Mead 1942: 38, 132). At this stage it is important to note that all these aspects of display have obvious morphological features but with South American practices of tying up the penis any display is limited, by definition, to the colouring matter of the thread used. The literature on these South American practices is very poor, but even when the threads are coloured red it has been claimed that the intention is not decorative but to protect against evil magic (e.g. Karsten 1962a: 152). This is not to say that display is not the aim of other South American practices; for example, among the Bororo of Brazil the use of decorated penis sheaths as social signals is obvious (see below). It is now clear that a simple distinction between nude and naked is less useful than it at first sight appeared to be, and furthermore that its use has served to camouflage the interesting fact, already suggested by the example of modern contraceptive sheaths, that sheaths may have a multiplicity of functions. There can be no doubt that many of the sheaths of primitive peoples are at one and the same time performing the functions of shame coverings and display signs. It has perhaps become a truism in modern Europe to say that one conceals what one wishes to display but this is nevertheless an appropriate statement about many of the sheathing practices recorded by ethnographers. As Birket-Smith has said (1965: 182) sheaths may be designed to protect the genitalia from view but this by no means implies that they are designed to conceal the existence of the sheathed items. From this point we may go back to Westermarck's (1921: 553) argument that most clothing is designed to allure, and add that it is perhaps true to say that the less one actually sees the more one can imagine. There is in this context perhaps a valid parallel between the use of sheaths in the ethnographic context and the use of lipstick or the brassiere (with or without its small decoration or bow on the front) in the modern western world. Receptacle. As we have already seen, the codpiece during its heyday acted as a receptacle as well as a covering of the penis. This function is found also for some sheathing practices among primitive peoples. In some areas of New Guinea the sheath is evidently considered a place for keeping things not only accessible but also dry, for the Kaya Kaya keep tinder in their sheaths (Bruijn 1915: 85) and the Wiram of Trans Fly use them 'as a repository for tobacco and other odds and ends' (Williams 1936: 397). Williams also recounts the meeting of an expedition with peoples around Everill Junction who were munching shrimps 'and continually helping themselves to further supplies secreted in the covers of their pubic shells'. In other areas the transportation aspect of the sheath is restricted to the occasional needle stuck in the wad of fur or fibre at the end of the sheath (Heider 1969: 388). Protection. Codpieces, as we have seen, also became integral parts of protective armour, as have also various types of more recent sheaths used in sports, and this is an explanation sometimes offered for sheathing among non-literate peoples, not usually for defence against human attack but as protection against natural dangers and irritants, insect, animal and vegetable. In several cases, especially in South America, this is the only explicit explanation offered by the sheath wearers themselves and it is by far the most common interpretation offered by the ethno- graphers (e.g. Nordenskiold 1922: 94; Koch- Gruneberg 1910: 89; Karsten 1926b: 172; Becher 1955: 145; Junger 1926: 107; etc.). There is little doubt that in several parts of South America where sheaths are worn the dangers and inconveniences from insects and fish at least are considerable. Thus Friederici (1912: 156) records the unmanning from fish bites of several people who bathed without wearing a penis cover. Furthermore in Guiana-and the mouth of the Orinoco the humidity may be as much as 100 per cent., a situation which must favour the minimum of non- functional clothing. The same explanation has also been offered by many of the ethnographers working in New Guinea and Africa. The Omand of the Cameroons themselves say that they wear sheaths as protection against small creatures that creep up their legs while they are seated (Tessmann 1934: 83), and the Thonga of South Africa are similarly explicit in stating that their sheaths are protection against ants (Junod 1927: 40). But one fact which argues against the protection against natural hazards being the sole or even major reason for the wearing of sheaths is the patchy nature of their distribution (see figs. 1-4), for the same natural hazards exist in many different areas, some where sheaths are worn and some where they are not. If such sheathing practices were really effective against major natural irritants one would expect to find them in use by tribes who were in contact with each other and were subject to the same natural hazards, but this is often not the case (see above). 53</page><page sequence="33">For New Guinea it has sometimes been claimed that the sheaths are protective against human attack in the same way as cuirasses (Reisenfeld 1946: 34), but this is not a convincing interpretation as the amount of protection afforded even by the cuirass is very questionable (see Austen 1947: 97), and in any case the sheaths are too brittle to be good defence against arrows (Heider 1969: 387). Several morphological features argue against the protective function of many sheaths. First, that many of the ends of sheaths are left open thus affording little protection against insects or fish. Second, that most sheathing practices, not only in America but also in Africa, New Guinea and the Pacific Islands, leave the testicles totally uncovered. Third, that many sheath types are very small indeed as well as being relatively unstable. But perhaps the most striking point against accepting any simple single explanation either in terms of display, shame or protection for the use of sheaths is the very widespread custom of continuing to wear sheaths under other adopted forms of clothing such as shirts, kilts or trousers. All the forms of sheathing reviewed above- the prepuce tied at the end of the glans, the penis wrapper, the manufactured penis sheath-are found still in use under adopted European clothing in all parts of the world (e.g. Tessmann 1934: pl. II; Lebuf 1936: 16; Tooke 1962: 81; Lembezat 1961: 123; Meek 1925: 39; Speiser 1923: 72; Sarasin 1929: 156; Zerries 1964: 118; Nordenskiold 1924: 148; etc.). In regions of New Guinea where the sheaths are made of long gourds this is often no easy feat, but cases are known where a special hole is cut in the front of a pair of trousers (Nouhuys 1913: 14) or where the sheath protrudes through the left leg of the trousers (personal communication, B. A. L. Cranstone). There is even one case recorded for the Admiralty Islands of a shell being worn under a loin cloth (Nevermann 1934: 111). Nevertheless, in view of the remarks made above about the importance which is often attached to adhering to accepted clothing custom, it would be dangerous to exclude an originally protective function of some sheaths as an important reason for their being worn. Furthermore, in the context of human warfare, their psychological effects may have been considerable. As we have seen, many of the sheaths, especially in New Guinea, may be very flamboyant and they may easily be associated with an aggressive swagger or, as has been seen for the Admiralty Islands, an explicit phallic display. Furthermore, with the possible exception of some ancient Egyptian, recent European and modern Sara practice, they are an exclusively masculine symbol and could easily have been asso- ciated with ferocity and virility within the context of warfare. There is rather contradictory evidence regarding the sheath types worn in warfare from different parts of the world. For the Dani of New Guinea (Heider 1969: 386) it is stated that these sheaths are normally of the short and straight variety, features which are correlated with the ease of keeping the sheaths anchored in place. For the Xhosa of South Africa, however, we have unique evidence to show that the sheaths worn for fighting were of the normal gourd type but were somewhat longer and were adorned with chains which sometimes had small bells attached to them (Louw 1938: 63-4). For some other South African tribes also it is recorded that sheaths worn in warfare are larger than those worn for everyday activities. There are some few remaining explanations of sheath wearing which are based either on explicit statements by the sheath wearers themselves or on practices observed by the ethnographers in the field. Thus, in several parts of New Guinea, excitement, wonder or fear leads to the drumming of the finger nails on the gourd sheaths which, amongst the Dani at least, is also a means of expressing agnatic relation- ship (Nouhuys 1912: 14; Heider 1969: 388). Orifices. With perhaps more general application is the wearing of the gol by Sara women; we have already seen that the wife of a Libyan chief is shown in an ancient Egyptian representation to be wearing what looks like a male sheath and we have also noted that in Europe women sometimes opted to wear dress simulating the male codpiece. Sara women, however, wear the gol with no explicit wish to appear masculine but because they aim to exclude those evil spirits which wander freely around and who seek to gain entrance to the human body through its orifices. Whereas Sara men are initiated into special societies whose rites include flagellation to separate the good spirits from the bad, the woman block both vagina and anus by the use of the gol (Muraz 1928: 4-7; Baumann &amp; Westermann 1948: 298). There is, in the literature, a small body of evidence which suggests that sheathing acts as protection not so much against natural dangers as against such things as evil spirits, the evil eye and especially the harmful spirits of dead animals (e.g. Karsten 1962a: 150; Polykrates 1969: 161; Palmer 1922-3; 123; Baumann 1938: 235; Speiser 1923: 70-4; Graebner 1924: 49). In general, as for the Sara, the assumption is made that such evil influences can gain entrance to the human body through its natural orifices, especially the genitalia, which are therefore blocked by various different methods. There is some evidence to suggest that this belief lies behind several of the practices from different parts of the world designed to prevent contact between water and the human body (e.g. Vaillant 1796: 362; Karsten 1935: 453). Amongst the Jibaro of Peru the normal clothing is the loin cloth but when crossing water the penis is tied up, in this case apparently because the the Jibaro believe that contact between the glans and water will impede erection. It is in this context that several of the claims for the Pacific Islands that the penis wrapper acts as a blockage against a particular evil spirit fit into some explanatory context (e.g. Somerville 1894: 368). A rather similar argument is advanced by some authorities for Melanesia in 54</page><page sequence="34">general in terms of a special spiritual presence which is situated in the glans following incision or circum- cision and whose exit from the human body is blocked by the use of a penis sheath (e.g. Rivers 1914: 432, 434-6). Here again it becomes important to remember the argument that body symbolism is part of the common stock of symbols and that orifices of the body therefore symbolise especially vulnerable parts. The ritual protection of bodily orifices can be treated as a symbol of social preoccupations about exits and entrances (Douglas 1966: 121, 126). It must, however, be noted that many peoples who practice some form of penis confinement do not block other orifices and that, in general, the penis when it is sheathed, can be thought to be a socially controlled instrument of relationship and to have little connexion with other body orifices (see below). Some other explanations are specific to the tribes concerned. Thus amongst some South American tribes the wish apparently exists to have elongated prepuces, a condition which may possibly result from tying the prepuce byond the glans and up to the belt (Zerries 1964: 119). Amongst the Thonga of South Africa sheaths are considered valuable not only because of the protection that they afford against natural hazards but because they protect the wearers from contact with the earth (Junod 1927: 95). The Namchi of the Cameroons apparently believe that the confinement of the penis will result in a strong organ and therefore in the birth of many children (Leiris 1934: 66, note 3), and this same theme of sexual prowess resulting from sheathing the penis finds occasional echo in other ethnographic reports. Thus, for the Waika of Venezuela, Zerries (1964: 122) reports that beyond the practical protection afforded by this custom the Waika expect to gain additional virility, and a similar belief involving the health of the penis and success with women exists amongst the Ghanaian LoDagaa (Labouret 1931: 392). Amongst the Thonga of South Africa the same theme also recurs; at the time of a boy's first emission a rite is performed to ensure strength and virility and it is at this time that the sheath is first worn (Junod 1927: 95). Social contexts 1 have reviewed the explicit statements of the people concerned and the direct observations by the ethnographers and I flow move to a consideration of the social context in which sheaths are worn and the identity of the sheath wearers. For all the societies for which we have sufficient data the wearinig of a sheath, at least for its first putting on, is closely correlated with age or social status. In other words sheaths are not worn by children below a certain age, another factor arguing against an unitary explanation of sheath wearing in terms of protection against natural hazards. The exact age at which a sheath is first worn differs widely from society to society, from three to fifteen years old, as does also the formality of the occasion when the sheath is first presented or put on or the prepuce first tied beyond the glans. However, in the vast majority of societies this event is correlated with either sexual (pubertal) or social maturity, an event which is often defined by initiation rites which may or may not include circumcision/incision rites as well. In some societies this is the occasion for the first opportunity for a boy to adopt a sheath, whereas in other societies this is the time for a change in genital clothing; in the case of the Tenda of Guinea for a change from the boy's string corset to the adult reed sheath (Techer 1933: 660). We may deduce for ancient Egypt that the same differentiation between youth and adult was in operation, for the young children on the Sahure relief are shown with no sheaths (see Bates 1914: 123). Similarly Zulu youths are distinct from adults in that they wear no sheath at all or an imitation sheath made from a cocoon (Bryant 1949:168). In Ghana, the LoDagaayoungmen have the penis placed under a waist band whereas married men have the penis placed into a cloth bag (Rattray 1932: 450). As the LoDagaa example shows, sheaths may not always be indicators of pre- and post-pubertal status but may be markers for any recognised social status. In New Guinea in the Digoel and Star regions the gourd is the normal type of sheath but both boys and old men wear black nut sheaths (Le Roux 1948: 114). Amongst the Marind- Anim to the south different sheath types serve to distinguish and exemplify different stages in social development for this is a society with patrilineal descent where age groups exist from infancy onwards. Children go nude from infancy onwards until the change of status to adolescence when they wear a pubic shell given to them by their maternal uncle. When they reach the grade of those-about-to-be- married the penis is placed under a tight hip belt and covered with a shell phallocrypt. At a later age the Marind-Anim continue to wear the penis under the belt or they adopt the penis shell or half coconut sheath (see Nevermann 1940: 175; Wirz 1922: 55; 1928: 14-17; Baal 1966: 140, 157; for rather conflicting details). As already noted, the sheaths are first adopted in an informal or formal situation, depending on the society concerned. The Bafia of East Cameroon are a case where the adoption is informal, and boys of between five and seven wear small maize leaf or plaited net- like sheaths which they have made for themselves unless they are lucky enough to have been given better specimens by their fathers (Tessmann 1934: 91). Amongst the Kayapo of Brazil there is a special sheath-giving ceremony which takes place at puberty and which is a necessary prerequisite for allowing long hair which itself is a stage in the progression towards ritual betrothal, from which time onwards they are allowed to become sexually active (Turner 1969: 57). There are numerous accounts of the initiation rites which surround the adoption of the penis sheath, which often involve a considerable 55</page><page sequence="35">period of seclusion of the boys before they enter the adult world. Amongst the Tupari of western Brazil, boys are first given their sheaths at about twelve years of age in a ceremony which precedes initiation rites by several years. The chief fastens the sheath onto the boy's penis only after considerable feasting and the flogging of the boy (Casper 1953: 208; 1956-8; 154). It is for the Bororo of Brazil that we have perhaps the best account of sheathing practices and their sub- sequent role as display pieces (see Crocker 1969; Levi- Strauss 1936; Fric &amp; Radin 1906; Karsten 1926a). Normal everyday sheaths are put on during initiation rites which take place after a youth's first adult erection. Only after the sheath has been adopted can someone marry and these sheaths are worn all the time, at least until old age. On certain feast days, however, the normal sheaths are changed for ornate ones with pendants made from stiff straw which are decorated with down and feathers and painted. Each decoration is the property of a particular ranked clan or subclan. In some societies, as we have seen, these puberty rites and the adoption of penis sheaths are associated with circumcision or incision rites, and these occasions are in general marked by greater formality than are the occasions so far reviewed above. Amongst the Namchi of the Cameroons two days of special ritual culminate with the blacksmith removing the normal penis sheath and circumcising the penis (Leiris 1934: 67, 69). Similarly amongst the Bhaca of South Africa a lightly constructed penis box is worn to cover the glans after the prepuce has been removed during initiation rites (Kohler 1933: 10). This association between the assumption of sheaths and circumcision rites has led some people to postulate a further pro- tective function for the ethnographic sheath; namely that of protecting the newly circumcised penis (e.g. Sarasin 1929: 156). This is an explanation which seems without doubt to be valid for certain cases where a soft fibre sheath, green leaves or soft skin sheath is applied immediately after the circumcision operation for a limited time before the adoption of the normal sheath made of other materials (e.g. Leiris 1934: 70). However Layard, while accepting this explanation for Vao, reports for the Small Islands of the New Hebrides that the newly incised novices are without penis wrappers during their seclusion but must wear protective wrappers once they leave their seclusion, and this despite the fact that their wounds heal after some ten days. Here, Layard suggests, the protection is not aimed at the newly circumcised penis but at the newly acquired spirit located in the glans. But even in Vao, novices on the fifth day of their seclusion remove their wrappers and run the gauntlet of rows of initiates who throw ash onto their unhealed wounds (Layard 1942: 515). This post-operative protective function is clearly not the primary aim of most sheathing practices for, apart from anything else as we have seen, the wearing of penis sheaths is as much associated with those who do not practice circumcision as with those who do. From this review it seems inevitable that we accept yet another function of the penis sheath; to define status and to act as a visible sign of newly acquired social, status or as a restatement of existing social hierarchy. In the Kayapo case, Turner (1969: 57) argues that the adoption for the first time of a sheath is one form of public recognition of a person's growing sexuality and that Kayapo sheaths are in general the expression of the social control and regu- lation of a mature male's sexual powers. Much the same points are made by Maybury-Lewis (1967: 106) for the Akwe-Shavante of Brazil, amongst whom the first sheaths are given by mature males to boys of between seven and twelve years of age while they are secluded in a bachelor's hut. Here the sheath symbolises physical maturity and is at the same time an expression of social control over sexual potential. Amongst the Urubu of Brazil a boy nowadays ties his own prepuce at about the time of puberty when he becomes embarrassed by the size of his own organ, or he gets his mother to do it for him. In the past, however, it was the village war chief who tied a man's prepuce, thus transforming him into one of his warriors and thereby making visible the person's new status as an adult man (Huxley 1957: 153). In many of these cases we can say that the wearing of sheaths is a symbol of political status. One of the most explicit examples of this state of affairs is that found in Malekula. According to Deacon (1934) penis wrappers in Malekula have to be bought at each rise in rank, so that wrappers can be arranged in a series of more or less prestige. Entry to the first grade is obtained by simple payment by the novice's father and only after an operation on the novice's prepuce, in or after the third grade, does he acquire his first penis wrapper. In Layard's account (1942: 42) boys adopt a banana leaf wrapper at puberty; at initiation a ceremonial plaited pandanus leaf wrapper, painted with red or yellow dye and adorned with tassels, is placed over the original one. These decorated wrappers vary according to the status of the wearer, and this in turn depends to some extent on the person's economic situation. Fair payments are regulated by spirits who send illness or death whenever 'sacred objects' are sold too cheaply (Deacon 1934: 578; pl. 21). Youths who are initiated rather later than is the norm wear half-wrappers (plate 21). In Southern Malekula even the dead are provided with appro- priately ranked penis wrappers (plate 22). As we have just seen, the identity of the sheath wearers depends to a great extent in many societies on the age and therefore on the social status of the person concerned. In several, but not all, societies to be sober but not to wear a sheath is also to signal a socially recognised role to the community at large. Amongst the Thonga, as we have seen, the absence of a sheath is normally enough to label one as a potential adulterer. Amongst some groups of Dani of New Guinea, to be unsheathed is to be undergoing a particular seizure, amongst other groups to be feeble 56</page><page sequence="36">minded (see Heider 1969: 383-4). The absence of a sheath is quite commonly a sign of mourning amongst several peoples in different parts of the world, a sign of temporary withdrawal from social participation, but it is only amongst the Thonga of South Africa that there is a special mourner's rite which involves the sheath. A Thonga male at the death of his first wife joins the Widower's Society; the rite starts with the burial of his wife and continues with ritual bathing in a pool and the incision of the widower in the inguinal region. The widower then throws away his penis sheath and walks across his hut in tears (Junod 1927: 202). In other societies, as we have seen also, the wearing of a sheath is defined by the particular social context. In some cases the reason for the adoption of a sheathing practice appears to be purely functional; thus in some parts of Peru the penis is sometimes anchored out of the way to ease movement during the climbing of trees. In other societies the sheathing practice appears to be restricted to certain professions only. The evidence of Greek representation shows that this was the case with wrestlers, athletes (see plate 14) and boxers, whilst the Roman representations of males wearing a fibula are all musicians to whom can be added youthful trainee performers, slaves and actors mentioned in the literature. For the ancient world this practice is taken to have been purely protective but in Japan it is said to prevent the evaporation of strength through the penis (see Dingwall 1925; and above). The case of ancient Egypt is very curious in its own right. As we have seen we can no longer accept that all those people represented with sheaths were in every case Libyans although in some cases, such as Senbi and possibly the wife of a chief, this may well have been so (see Borchardt 1913: 11; Holscher 1955). Those who have favoured the Libyan origin of sheathing customs have assumed that within ancient Egypt itself the custom of sheathing became restricted to hunting activities (e.g. Fischer 1961: 68). However, whether or not we accept that an Old Kingdom priestly title derived from the word for phallus sheath, the actual Egyptian evidence is much more complex. In one case we find a Libyan and his attendant both wearing sheaths but in the tomb of this same man's son, only the attend- ant is sheathed. If we accept all the possible examples of sheathing represented in ancient Egyptian represen- tations (see above) it becomes clear that this form of dress was widespread and not simply a hunting costume. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that we find some Nile Gods shown with sheaths (see Borchardt 1913: 29). On present evidence there is no justification for assuming that there were Libyan originals for these deities just because they are sheathed. We must conclude, rather, that the sheath was an acknowledged form of 'clothing' fit for the gods. Furthermore, in the Egyptian context, we must note one more sheathed representation of a deity (see Daressy 1906: 25, no. 38068). A limestone statue from Karnak, dating from the XVJJJth Dynasty, is shown with a penis sheath. Unfortunately the identification of the deity represented is uncertain; one likelihood is that it represents the god Ptah-Tanen, another that it represents a form of the god Ra. The tempting view that the figure could represent the king himself, in this case Amenophis II, wearing the costume of his Libyan subjects must be ruled out, for the statue is clearly shown with the long beard of divinity (personal communications, H. S. Smith and C. Aldred). Whatever is the correct identification of this deity there is no possible suggestion of any Libyan association. Why only this one representation of Ra or Ptah-Tanen should be shown wearing a penis sheath, and what this reflects about the ancient Egyptians' view of sheaths, is for the present totally obscure.29 In ethnography, it is reported for several societies that there is a difference in incidence of sheath wearing between the young and the old. We have already seen one kind of interpretation of such evidence which would seek to argue that where old men are predominantly the ones to wear penis sheaths this is an indication that the practice is in the process of dying out. Another interpretation mentioned by Friederici for the Tupinamba of Brazil (1912: 156) is that the sheath might have acted as a protection against the shame of old age. It is far more likely, however, if we follow Metraux (1948b: 105) that Tupinamba youths were characterised by their tying of the prepuce beyond the glans and that they were thus distinct from their elders who wore manufactured penis sheaths. The remainder of the literature is contradictory and unsatisfactory regarding the differ- ential use of sheaths, and particular sheath types, by the old as opposed to the young. In each case the argument can be made that the old men no longer had a natural interest in appearing virile and flamboyant, or that the custom of sheath wearing was simply dying out. Although Heider (1969) has made it clear that for the Dani there is no regular association between any particular sheath type and the age, personality or status of the wearer, there are reports from other parts of the world that social importance is associated with distinctive sheath types, woven instead of plaited wrappers, horns instead of nut sheaths, elaborate instead of simple covers, and so on (e.g. Speiser 1934: 139; Meek 1925: 41; Marwick 1940: 85). Levels of analysis At the beginning of this paper it was said that one of the virtues of studies of material culture was that they are based on tangible reality. It can be argued that this is in itself no reason for staying at the explicit and observable level of interpretation of data, as has been done so far in this paper. We have already considered the views of Wickler (1966) and Morris (1969) and have seen how difficult it is to accept their interpretation of penis sheathing. We have found a 57</page><page sequence="37">variety of detail and possible significance for confining the penis whereas both these authorities assume a universal significance to the sheathing practice. One result of the cross-cultural approach attempted here must be to reject Wickler's assumption that the sheathing practices of New Guinea, South America, Melanesia, the Etruscans and the fifteenth and sixteenth century Europeans were all simply a matter of aggressive display. This is not to deny the value of an ethological approach to such data for it is clear that in the case of the Sara at least an approach in Morris's terms of the 'unconscious mimicry' of the male organ, which may sometimes extend to the adoption of a pseudo rump or scrotum, can provide an added insight to a particular form of material culture. In the case of the Sara, despite the absence of explicit male identification when the gol is worn, the shape of this artefact is clearly phallic in its upward curve and its hanging 'testicles'. We may also suspect a similar subconscious symbolism and identification for ancient Egyptian and sixteenth and seventeenth century European attire but this is bound to remain no more than a suspicion. Forge has argued in the 1965 Curl Lecture (1965: 25), that the overt meaning of any symbol has little or no importance. It is at the deeper level of analysis of what is admitted by Forge (1965: 25) to be possibly the level of the subconscious that discussions of penis sheathing, at least, get into trouble. We may surmise a loaded symbolism connected with the placing of the penis in an erect position under a waist belt but, despite the claims of such authorities as Le Roux (1948) and Baal (1966), there is virtually nothing in the recorded literature to support such an interpretation. Again, this is not to decry such an approach to the data but simply to insist on the differences which exist between studies which start from observable reality and which demand that each switch to theoretical abstraction be visibly related to the observable data, and those studies which approach material on the basis of any assumed universal principles of structure or symbolism. The differences in levels of analysis are very evident when we look at Layard's (1942: 477; 1961: 254-5) inter- pretations of the New Hebrides wrapper. Layard claims that the wrapper is a sign of bodily sacrifice and is protective in the sense of preventing any loss of the power situated in the glans. He then proceeds to interpret the penis wrapper in general as a symbol of manhood and man's ability to conquer the forces of nature and in the particular context of initiation as the symbolic means for female power to be conveyed to male novices. Similarly Levi-Strauss, after a complex discussion of the relative merits of various existing forms of Bororo myth concludes (1966: 46) that these Brazilian sheaths are identified 'not with the female sex in general, but with the women of the moiety and even of the clan, and subclan, to which the novice belongs and with which the sponsor's subclan prefers to inter-marry-in other words, with those women who might be the sponsors in "brides"' (and see Yalman 1967: 74-5). These various possible levels of analysis become clear when we consider penis sheaths within the context of primitive art. Art. At the most obvious level we must note the rarity in all parts of the world of representations of the human figure shown wearing sheaths. There are two possible explanations; the first, that figures are supposed to be represented naked/nude and that the sheaths are considered to be clothing and the second, that it is technically difficult to represent the male penis, let alone penis sheath, especially on represen- tations carved in the round (see Forge 1965: note 9; Ucko 1968: 337). In addition we must note the common practice of adding external articles to the basic carved or modelled figure as for example, is found in the New Hebrides. Here the basic clay- modelled form of the dead person is given a 'real' penis wrapper made of the correct fibres and indicating appropriate status (see plate 22). Nevertheless it is striking that virtually no representations with a penis sheath are known from New Guinea. The one exception being a figure with penis held up by the belt (see p. 33). In South America, however, figures shown with the penis bound up to the belt are known from both ancient and modern contexts (see Barrades 1954; Ruel 1967). The numerous sheathed representa- tions which we have seen from ancient Egypt and Classical Greece and Rome are in marked contrast to the ethnographic situation. There is, however, one exceptional wooden carving, said to have been obtained from the Zulu before 1919, which is shown with flaccid penis, provided with a detachable glans cover, which is partially hidden by a skirt (plate 24). Some of the sheaths used in non-literate societies are themselves art objects and might perhaps be thought suitable material for providing insight into the subconscious values and activities of their carvers. Unfortunately many of the representations on New Guinea gourd sheaths are extremely difficult to interpret. Even when the content of the art can be made out, the problem is to assess the significance of the association between specific content and the fact that it is shown on a penis sheath. The problem is again one of method and levels of analysis. A symbolic identification can be simply assumed or, and this is much more the method of established studies of material culture, a consistency between content and the penis or its sheath must be demonstrated. Unfortunately the data are simply not available at the present time to demonstrate or deny any such a consistent association. It is possibly correct, as claimed by Preuss (1899: 172-6) and Sande (1907: pls. 15-16) that certain New Guinea gourd sheaths are decorated with birds, flying foxes, snakes, lizards and possibly crabs but their identification with the penis in the imagery of their carvers is still to be demonstrated. What is at least certain is that this decoration is predominantly situated on the side of the sheath opposite the aperture intended to receive the penis, and that this decoration is therefore visible 58</page><page sequence="38">to the observer. The bamboo sheaths of the Mimika of New Guinea are themselves also art objects (see plates 8a, 8b, 9). They are again decorated on the surfaces visible to the observer but their decorations are almost entirely geometric, made up of lozenges, chevrons, semicircles, dots, zigzags, and triangles (see Fischer 1913: 48-50; Haddon &amp; Layard 1916; Zuid- West Nieuw-Guinea Expeditie 1908). As already noted some Mimika sheaths are themselves shaped as the legs and lower part of the human body. The observer sees the legs, which are shaped exactly as are some ceremonial house posts (Landtmann 1933) as if they were upside down. It has been claimed (Haddon &amp; Layard 1916: 35) that at the lower ends of most Mimika sheaths an isolated lozenge has been cut out representing the vulva which is outlined by an engraved line which runs from the manufactured peak of the lower end of the sheath. This same lozenge has also been claimed to represent the human eye (Rawling 1913: 59). An alternative explanation is that the dark lower end of the sheath symbolises the glans so that the penis, to an observer, is at rest with the ridges of the prepuce clearly indicated (Kelm 1966). Whatever the respective merits of these alternative explanations, one thing is clear, on a more mundane level of analysis, and that is that several of the features of these bamboo sheaths are not determined by the techniques of their manufacture. Certain of their elements, such as the nicks on the sides of the sheaths, have received no interpretation. Symbolism. There are so few hints of any possible subconscious or unconscious meaning associated with the wearing of penis sheaths that we can attempt a short review of the available data. It is reported for the New Hebrides for example, that the removal of a person's penis wrapper is considered a deadly sin (Speiser 1923: 72) and amongst the Dani of New Guinea it is similarly considered especially insulting to cut off the top of a person's penis sheath (Harrer 1963: 34). Amongst the Gaika of South Africa anyone who removes a person's sheath is subject to a fine of up to five cattle. It is possible to interpret these few scattered remarks within the context of the feelings of nakedness, shame and modesty which have been mentioned above, or it is possible to assume, as does Le Roux (1948: 147) that the penis sheath in New Guinea is a symbol of erection, or even super-erection, whereby the end plume or fibre stopper represents either the glans or even semen. If this latter view is correct the symbolic implication of cutting off the end of a penis sheath appears obvious. It is also possible to see in the erect penis of those peoples who tie the prepuce under a waist belt an explicitly sexual statement regarding virility. For the Marind-Anim of New Guinea, Baal makes it clear that he interprets the raised penis with its shell in front of it as an overtly sexual symbol. According to Baal, the Marind-Anim initiate, with his symbolic erection and carefully covered buttocks, is presenting himself in the role of a homosexual. Similarly Baal finds echoes of identi- fication with the neophyte in the adult use of pubic shells during some rites and he interprets several myths as reflecting classic castration anxiety (Baal 1966: 157, 950-1). If we search the literature for any evidence of symbolic meaning to the wearing of penis sheaths then it may be significant that amongst the Tamberama of Upper Volta as we have seen, it is the female partner in a dance who may jokingly remove the sheath of one or two male dancing partners (Frobenius 1913: 323-4). There is really nothing in the literature to suggest that female involvement in this way reflects any significant symbolism of the penis sheath. It is only if we assume that anything to do with the male organ must have particular hidden meaning that we will automatically assume any deep symbolic signifi- cance from this dancing situation. The only other two examples from Africa which might suggest any deeper significance to the penis sheath concern the Zulu and the Thonga. Among the normal Zulu basketry sheath types there are numerous museum specimens charac- terised not only by their strikingly small apertures but also by being full of some brownish mixture (see plate 3). Museum catalogues state simply that these specimens (e.g. British Museum No. 3289) were taken from dead boys and 'filled with semen and cow-dung to promote fertility'. Semen also features in the Thonga example, for if the delivery of a baby is unduly long there is doubt about the child's legitimacy. The husband takes a little of his semen in his penis sheath, mixes it with water in a shell and gives it to his wife to drink. If legitimate, the child will 'feel his father' and delivery will be swift (Junod 1927: 40). In the Pacific area there are reports for New Caledonia of exchanges of sheaths by chiefs on the occasion of major feasts or peace-signing ceremonies (Sarasin 1929: 156), and in Malekula there is a possible vague association between a chief's sheath and the blood of animals (Deacon 1934: 363-5). For New Guinea, amongst the Kwoma, an initiate's penis cover is placed over a growing bamboo shoot as soon as the period of seclusion is finished. When the penis cover eventually splits the initiate, whose penis is supposed to have grown in size in the same way as the bamboo shoot, has reached adolescence (Whiting 1941: 66-7). Finally, there remains one further myth which mentions penis sheathing. One of the culture heroes of the Tukuna of Brazil dances with his penis free from his waistband and this causes the laughter of the 'girl from Umari' and her subsequent discovery hidden within a flute (Nimuendaju 1952: 127-8). There are no further indications of this kind in the literature to suggest any deep-seated general symbolic significance to the penis sheath, and even in the cases that we have seen any such symbolism is perhaps more likely to be focused on the semen than on the sheath itself. When we also remember the absence of any explicit state- ments from which one could infer any such meaning, the paucity of myths which deal explicitly with sheathing practices and the virtual absence of 59</page><page sequence="39">transvestite use of the sheath, it is necessary to conclude at the very least that any deep symbolic meaning still remains to be demonstrated for the penis sheath. Conclusions I may perhaps conclude by asking what I have achieved by this review. It may be thought that I have tended to see a penis sheath in everything that I have looked at. This is a danger which is particularly liable when dealing with artistic representations21 but it is one which is perhaps an improvement over the situation in 1903, when Myres had to append a note to a 31 page long article on Cretan figurines (1902-3: 387), saying that he had received a letter subsequent to the writing of the article which suggested 'that what I have described as a "loin-cloth" may be a "Bantu sheath" of the type which is familiar on . . . figures of predynastic style in Egypt'. At the very least I have, I hope, managed to put some order into the existing literature on penis confinement practices. Amongst the limited aims of this paper I hoped to show how by taking a series of material objects as a starting point, investigation leads into many spheres of anthropological interest. I have tried to show how taking a limited set of morphological criteria as a starting point allows cross-cultural comparisons in a way which exclusive insistence on wide function does not (see Leach 1967: xvi). I suggest that what we have seen is a situation where the same cultural solution, the confinement of the penis, has been adopted in many different cultures, both in the past and in the present, sometimes for the same reasons and some- times for quite different ones. The same problem confronts all males in those societies which require that the penis or glans should normally be covered; a limited range of solutions to this problem exists but within the range of sheathing practices there is considerable room for individual preference. We have seen the range and variety of morphological types of penis sheaths. Within any particular culture the particular morphological type used by any individual often corresponds to his profession, age or status or, in some societies, it is the particular social situation which defines the particular qualities of the sheath which are appropriate to that situation. In some societies the morphology of the sheath is at its most simple, the tying of the prepuce over the glans, and there is little evidence to suggest that its primary function was anything but protective. In other societies, however, the morphological aspects of the sheaths are complex. We must note that the penis is very suitably shaped for the attachment of objects to it, and that considerable variety of practice has been represented in the record. There is evidence that these morphological possibilities have been used in many societies to attract attention to the wearer, and yet that this function is at the same time closely associated both with feelings of modesty and with the prevention of erection. The display aspect of sheathing practices is perhaps not only connected with the technical possibilities of attaching appendages to the penis itself or to a penis sheath, but also to the fact that a penis sheath can be treated separately from any other article of clothing and can be easily associated with male qualities such as aggression and virility. We must, I think, distinguish carefully between an individual's wish to wear a flamboyant article within the range allowed by accepted practices of propriety, rather as is the situation with the wearing of hats in western society today, and the existence of societies which might be called overtly phallic. From our review we see that penis sheaths in most societies have remarkably few phallic connotations and are, rather, symbols of modesty and decorum. This is perhaps not as surprising as it might at first sight seem to be, when we remember that most societies first adopt the penis sheath at or near puberty. The sheath is, in many of these cases, not simply a symbol of sexual maturity but one of social control of that sexuality. The penis sheath, in many instances, is not primarily a sexual symbol in itself but a visible sign of sexual restriction. When we move to the morphological aspect of cross-cultural studies we have found that penis con- finement by the use of some sheathing process is widespread and is found in restricted areas of different continents. By examining the details of their manu- facture and the methods employed in actually putting them on, we have found that some sheath types are unique to a particular society and that others are shared by several societies. Where the forms are different there is no difficulty in accepting that they were independently invented whether for the same or for different purposes. Where a particular distinctive trait of penis sheathing is shared by several tribes who are in reasonably close proximity, for example the Brazilian tribes of the Colorado, Branco and Mequens rivers, who all attach their sheaths to a fold of skin produced by forcing the penis into the pubis, we can postulate diffusion and cultural contact as the ex- planation for the morphological similarity of the practices. Where the forms are the same in more than one continent, as are for example some of the practices in New Guinea, some Pacific islands and parts of South America, we must first note that these are primarily the forms which are morphologically the simplest. As has been long maintained in studies of material culture, the simpler the device the more likely it is to have been invented independently in more than one area. We do in fact have one recorded example of the tying of the penis, which must be accepted as a case of independent invention. Thus, Gould and Pyle (1901) record the relatively recent occurrence of a 'spontaneous retraction of the penis . . . of a peasant of twenty-three . . . which bodily disappeared and which was only captured by repeated effort. The patient was six days under treatment, and he finally became so distrustful of his virile member that, to be assured of its constancy, he tied a string 60</page><page sequence="40">about it above the glans'. The morphologically simple devices of tying the prepuce over the glans or fastening the prepuce under a waist band have been found to characterise both whole societies and particular sections of societies. It is possible to argue that it is the very simplicity of these practices, the efficacy in protecting the glans against natural hazards as well as the relative ease of reversing the process of confinement, that make these forms of sheathing so suitable to the different requirements of the various societies. I have maintained throughout this paper that a study of material culture opens up many areas of investigation of interest to a wide range of anthro- pological enquiry. I have attempted to deal with one aspect of penis sheathing only; the aspect most directly associated with the forms and social contexts of the sheaths themselves. I am well aware that a different dimension of social enquiry into penis sheathing could have been attempted; such a study would have examined sheathing practices within the wider context of cosmological beliefs, theories of conception and general attitudes to the human body. In Melanesia, at least, such an approach would have been largely concerned with the general distinction between males and females and would have shown how these are often sharply distiniguished symbolically both in taboos and ritual activities. Such a study, which would of course require exceptionally good and full data from particular societies, still remains to be unidertaken. All dimensions of social enquiry are, to my mind, of equal value and interest and I can do no better than to end this paper by quoting from Professor Daryll Forde (1959: 199): 'Sociological and ethnological explanations relate to different frames of reference. In contributing to our understanding of a custom or a total culture, each of them may provide partial, but only partial explanations at different levels. They can complement but cannot logically exclude one another. Ethnological explanations are concerned with the composition of particular culture patterns and the sources of their various components focus attention on the content of the custom. . . . Sociological expla- nations do not and cannot account for the specific content of the custom'.

Different people have read all, or parts, of this manuscript and I cannot attempt to express what I owe them. At the very least I have taken up the time of the following: Dr J. Alexander, Dr R. Boyd, Mr B. A. L. Cranstone, Dr P. Fry, Dr J. P. Garlick, Professor I. M. Lewis, Mr H. S. Smith, Professor M. G. Smith and Dr R. Tringham. I am especially grateful to Mr A. Forge, Dr P. Kaberry, Dr P. Morton-Williams and Dr A. Rosenfeld, without whose assistance and time this paper would never have been completed. On a personal note this is, as far as I can remember, my first paper to be published without the benefit of criticism and advice from my friend the late Dr R. Bradbury. I know that it would have been much improved had he been able to read it, and I wrote it with his memory constantly in mind. 2 See note 9. 3 I cannot resist mentioning the various attempts to perform on these specimens in the mistaken belief that they were musical instruments. 4 As Briffault (1927: 292) has pointed out, painting and tattooing may sometimes be thought to act in the same way as clothing. 5 The possibly arbitrary nature of this definition is shown by, for example, the cases of 1) the Awa of New Guinea who wear a tight-fitting corset fastened around the hips which holds the penis tightly between the legs (Sorenson &amp; Gajdusek 1966: 159) and of 2) Santa Cruz where males wear a belt with a woven or barkcloth mat tied up at the front and back under a belt, thus also anchoring the penis and scrotum (Speiser 1919: 185). 61</page><page sequence="41">6 We may, I suggest, adopt the term 'phallocrypt' for devices which simply conceal the penis but do not closely sheathe it. It is perhaps interesting to note that within the same tribe the same object may or may not be used as a phallocrypt, seemingly according to whim, thus Seligmann (1906: 66) records that Toro men (New Guinea) sometimes wear a simrple waist band, sometimes a waist band witlh a shell suspended on the side of the body and sometimes a waist band with the shell suspended centrally covering the vertical penis. The 1904-5 expedition to south-west New Guinea drew attention to these morphological distinctions: the shell sheath is not attached to the waist band but to the penis itself; the phallocrypt is a small shell (excluding the plaque) whereas the sheath is a large shell (Zuid-West Nieuw-Guinea-Expeditie 1908). It is unfortunate that much of the available literature fails to distinguish or specify between shell phallocrypts and shell sheaths. In several cases this distinction can be established from photographic records, but a large element of uncertainty remains for many other cases. Only definite cases of shell sheaths have been entered on the distribution maps and it is therefore possible that their frequency is in reality greater than that indicated. 7 This is again, in one sense at least, an arbitrary categori- sation for although justified on grounds of morphology the use of phallocrypts is often subject to the same rules and social conditions as is the use of sheaths (e.g. Purari Delta (Chauvet 1930: 101-2)). Some people have opted to extend the organ with some attachment usually in the form of a pin or ring (e.g. see Brown 1874). Penis pins are excluded from this investigation for these penetrating devices in no way sheath the organ, they are not designed to confine the penis and they do not cover it. These 'piercing' devices, I am assured by Dr R. Needham, have 'no connexion with penis sheaths as far as intention and effects are concerned'. Where rings, simple circular objects of bone, ivory or metal, are used to fasten the prepuce over the glans they are included in this investigation; circular objects with roughened surfaces of varying penetration which fit over the penis root and do not serve to sheath the glans or confine the penis are excluded from this investigation. 8 There are a few exceptional cases, such as the Utakwa and Unkia of New Guinea, where the penis sheath is also extended to cover the scrotum (e.g. Karius &amp; Champion 1928: 91). 9 Many of the previous attempts to assess the distribution of penis sheaths are partial and include many faulty bibliographical references. I make no excuse, therefore, for drawing up here a bibliography of the more important sources dealing with the confinement of the glans penis.

Burt (University College London). 11 It is instructive to compare the supposed extent of gourd sheath distribution in New Guinea according to the dates of the different surveys-cp. Sande, Friederici, Haddon and Layard, Le Roux, Reisenfeld (see Note 9). 12 Accurate plotting of the South African distribution is impossible; the literature includes a multiplicity of tribal, linguistic and general names which defies accurate location to a particular geographical area. Furthermore, museum collections contain labelled specimens of types which according to the published literature were not found amongst the tribes from which the specimens are said to be derived. 13 See note 8. 14 This is a claim also made for ancient Greece on the basis of a study of representations, but convincingly rejected by Dingwall (1925). 15 Since that article was published a figurine in the Ashmolean Museum (no. E14466a) has come to light which is said to derive from the Archaic tomb of Zer at Abydos (this attribution apparently made by Margaret Murray). There can be no doubt of the striking similarities between this Ashmolean figurine and those featured in Ucko and Hodges (1963: no. 28e; see also Ucko 1968: nos. 139-143); in fact all six figures could well have been made by the same hand. The unfortunate break on the Ashmolean figure makes it impossible to determine whether or 62</page><page sequence="42">not it was shown with a penis sheath or whether, like the others, it was shown with erect penis surrounded by white-painted pubic hair. If the Ashmolean Catalogue ascription is accepted, the other five figurines must also be considered genuine (but see Ucko &amp; Hodges 1963: 208, 211, 213) and the whole group would then be the only examples knowni of figurines from the Archaic period of Egypt. 16 See Blackman &amp; Apted (1953: 15-17) for other possible Egyptian examples. 17 Much of the obscurity of several interpretations of these two texts rests on two main assumptions; that the Egyptians themselves did not wear penis sheaths, and that there is an inevitable connexion between the wearing of a sheath and the practice of circumcision (but see Holscher 1955: 14, 35; Wain- wright 1962: 92). 18 One interesting line of enquiry would be to investigate any possible relationship between the use of male sheatlhs and the absence of female contraceptive practices. 19 The use of the kynodesme by the Mandans may be viewed either as a reflection of the mode of 'dress' before the adoption of the loin cloth, or as an integral part of sexual abstinence before and during the performance of rites (personal communication, B. Burt). 20 C. Aldred (personal communication) tells me that a fragmentary statue of the time of Rameses II in the Alexandria Museum shows the same sheath. 21 A temple image from Hawaii (Hiroa 1957: fig. 308e) is in fact shown with erect penis but without a waist belt. On analogy with several South American carvings and the stone figure from the Huon peninsula (see above) this could be interpreted as the representation of a sheathing practice, but there is, to my knowledge, nothing to confirm such an interpretation.
