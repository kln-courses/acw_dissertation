<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Turkey, 2004-2005 BAHADIR YILDIRIM AND MARIE- HENRIETTE GATES This edition of the "Archaeology in Turkey" news- letter presents an overview of the archaeological work undertaken in Turkey in 2004-2005. We intend to pub- lish a newsletter from Turkey in alternate years in this journal. The report is organized chronologically, then geographically within the chronological eras.* INTRODUCTION The revival of this newsletter in the comprehensive format established by Machteld J. Mellink is a testament to her holistic approach to archaeology, now a standard assessment of human settlement in the longue duree. Her newsletters chronicled archaeology in Turkey almost annually from 1955 to 1993 and were followed by those by Marie-Henriette Gates through 1997.1 Scholars of Anatolian archaeology have lamented the interruption of this source for the most recent trends and discover- ies.2 Reports on the Stone to Iron Ages were published by Alan Greaves and Barbara Helwing in the AJA and in the Turkish Academy of Sciences Journal of Archaeology (TUBA-AR) for the 1997-2002 field seasons.3 Beyond Steven Mitchell's last newsletter in Archaeological Re- ports covering 1990-1998,4 there is no comprehensive account in English for 1999-2003.5 Bridging this gap are the invaluable publications (mainly in Turkish) of reports presented at the annual International Sympo- sium of Excavations, Surveys, and Archaeometry and the Symposium on Museum Research and Salvage Ex- cavations, both organized by the Turkish Ministry of Culture's General Directorate of Monuments and Mu- seums.6 This newsletter relies on the reports delivered at the 27th and 28th International Symposium of Exca- vations, Surveys, and Archaeometry as well as reports kindly sent to us by project directors or published in various newsletters, journals, and edited volumes. New Trends Several of the trends noted a decade ago by Gates continued in 2004-2005: an increase in the number of projects; the growing role of surveys and investiga- tions of more neglected periods; and site destruction by development and illicit digging, an unfortunate leitmotiv of the newsletter.7 Projects numbered about 160 in 1995, and more than 200 by 2005 (fig. 1). There are several reasons for this. One is the lack of project quotas, despite the ministerial person- nel shortage to oversee projects. The instigation in 1993 of a cultural inventory by the Turkish Ministry of Culture has encouraged surveys and excavations as well as more ambitious projects, such as an inven- tory of all sites in Turkey by the Tiirkiye Arkeolojik Yerle§meleri (Archaeological Settlements of Turkey) (TAY) Project.8 The establishment of new universities with archaeology departments, greater support by the merged Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the Scien- tific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) , provincial and municipal authorities, and the private sector stress the need for public awareness about documenting and preserving cultural heritage. Development and construction have precipitated res- * A great debt of gratitude goes to colleagues who contrib- uted reports and who are individually acknowledged in the text.

Surveys account for much of the increase in the number of projects. This shift reflects a wider trend in the field of archaeology toward examination of so- cioeconomic and anthropological questions related to human settlement patterns and land use in their paleoenvironmental and cultural-historical contexts. Surveys examining all periods in a region have become the favored means for identifying these patterns and factors. Increasingly, interdisciplinary and interna- tional teams of specialists from the social and natural sciences are incorporated into projects to apply new technologies for analyzing and documenting artifacts and the environment and assessing the information through geographical information systems, which fa- cilitate intensive survey techniques. Regional survey projects in Turkey, such as the Granicus River Survey, Central Lydian Archaeological Survey, Sinop Regional Archaeological Project, Rough Cilicia Archaeological Survey, and Goksu Archaeological Project, are exem- plary of the application of these new approaches to archaeology in Turkey. Surveys have also been incor- porated into the programs of excavation projects (e.g., at Sagalassos),11 to understand a site's settlement his- tory during all periods and the relationship between the site and its territory, leading to the examination of "unknown phases of regions that seem at this point (deceptively) familiar."12 Geophysical prospection, which permits analysis of subsurface features without resorting to invasive excavation techniques, has become one of the most utilized tools of archaeological projects. Increasing costs of large-scale excavation and preservation have made it an attractive alternative in combination with targeted soundings, which, when applied over large areas, have transformed our understanding of urban- ism and its diachronic development in all periods, such as at Troy, Ku§akh, Miletos, Kerkenes, Pergamon, and Aphrodisias.13 A complex, multidimensional landscape in Turkey and elsewhere is taking shape as a result of these new trends and the mass of information they produce. Lo- cal contexts and the range of responses to more nu- merous variables are playing prominent roles in the reassessment of issues, such as ancient trade and the functioning of empires, and in the formulation of plu- ralistic approaches that abandon traditional dualities (e.g., East/West, Greek/Roman) to examine processes such as the role of material culture in the construction of social, political, and cultural identities.14 One side effect of the data overload has been fewer attempts at synthetic studies encompassing the entire range of evidence for a particular region or period.15 HIGHLIGHTS FROM 2OO4-2OO5 PROJECTS The longest early Paleolithic sequence in Anatolia has now been revealed at Kaletepe Deresi in Cappado- cia. On the outskirts of §anhurfa, at the Early Neolithic site of Gobekli Tepe, geophysical survey indicates that 20 sacred stone-built enclosures with T-shaped pillars decorated with reliefs and incisions may exist, in ad- dition to the four that have now been excavated, and that they are not isolated from settlements but adjacent to a sequence of long-lived contemporary settlements. Excavations at the Hittite city at Ku§akli, ancient Sa- rissa, have uncovered a well-preserved stable of Old Kingdom date. Remarkable evidence for the Iron Age was found at the monumental entrance to the palace complex at Kerkenes Dag in the form of a statue and relief sculpture bordered by an inscription in the Old Phrygian language, and at Xanthos, where reliefs in Phrygian and Neo-Hittite style decorated what may have been the entrance to a palace. Ongoing excavations at classical sites on the coast of Lycia (Patara) , Pamphylia (Perge), and Cilicia (Soloi/ Pompeiopolis) have reached Bronze Age levels in their acropoleis, to be associated with settlements referred to in Hittite texts ("Parha" for Perge, "Patar" for Patara) . New excavation projects have also begun at many clas- sical sites since 1995: in Aeolis (Allianoi, Aigai), the Troad (Alexandria Troas, Antandros, Parion), Ionia (Smyrna-Roman Agora), Lycia (Tlos) , Phrygia (Laodi- cea), Cappadocia (Tyana), Commagene (Doliche), and Thrace (Heraion Teichos). Notable finds at Archaic sanctuaries include fine marble griffin and horse protomes that probably deco- rated the Temple of Athena at Phocaea; at Klaros, a 9G6rur and tstanbulluoglu 2006; Ortac 2006. 10 For sites threatened by the dam projects on the Tigris and Euphrates, see Greaves and Helwing 2001, 463-65; 2003a, 71. nVanhaverbeke and Waelkens 2003. 12 Gates 1994, 249. 13 For Troy, Pergamon, and Aphrodisias, see Mitchell 2003, 21-3, 34. 14Mattingly 2004; Osborne 2004; Woolf 2004; Alcock 2005. 15 This problem is not exclusive to archaeology in Turkey but represents a general issue in the field as a whole; see Osborne 2004, 96; Woolf 2004, 417-26; Salmeri and D'Agata 2005, 23.</page><page sequence="4">278 B.

GATES [AJA 111 sacred way of the seventh century B.C.E. below that of the fifth century B.C.E. to the Sanctuary of Apollo; and in the Mycale Mountains, the remains of a sanctuary that may belong to the Panionion. At Sardis, there is now no doubt that the location of the Lydian capital is below the Roman city, with definitive stratigraphic proof for the production of croeseid coins before the Persian attack. Important sculptural finds of the Hellenistic and Roman periods include a statuary group at the bouleu- terion of Aigai of the Late Hellenistic period signed by a sculptor from Pergamon, a spectacular Attic Diony- sian kline sarcophagus with reclining portraits of the third century C.E. from a well-preserved tomb in the West Necropolis at Perge, and the colossal statuary of the aediculated facade of a Hadrianic nymphaeum at Sagalassos. Significant Roman Imperial architectural finds include a lighthouse of the first century C.E. at Patara, remains of the early Julio-Claudian Temple of Apollo at Hierapolis, the sanctuary of the god Jupiter Dolichenus at Doliche, and the exceptionally well- preserved thermal resort complex at Allianoi. For the Byzantine period, a fourth-century C.E. har- bor containing the remains of at least eight boats from the seventh to 11th centuries C.E. was uncovered dur- ing salvage excavations at Istanbul's Yenikapi district. The processional route of the late fourth and early fifth centuries C.E. has been associated with the creation of the Martyrion of Saint Philip at Hierapolis, and a public balnea in use from the sixth to ninth centuries C.E. has been discovered at Amorium. In an attempt to make sites more accessible to visitors, the Turkish General Directorate of Cultural Heritage and Museums now requires site management plans as part of every excavation's annual application for research permits. One immediate effect has been the creation of new signage and visitor paths at sites and an emphasis on restoration and reconstruction that both help the public understand the excavated monuments and provide data for experimental ar- chaeology, such as the full-scale reconstruction of part of the inner wall of the Lower City of the Hittite capital, Hattusha. Overall, the increasing demands are straining resources, which had been traditionally allocated to research rather than restoration or site management, and are requiring more input from the private sector and international funds. The growth of sponsors for sites and these projects was clearly vis- ible in the latest presentations prefaced by corporate and institutional logos at the annual archaeological symposium. Illicit digging has reached pandemic levels, as net- works of dealers and collectors have developed to keep up with a seemingly insatiable demand. The discov- ery in 2006 that some of the repatriated items of the so-called Lydian Hoard that were looted from burial chambers in the 1960s were missing or replaced with fakes is another sad example of the sophistication of these networks.16 The pervasive extent of this "evil"17 is most evident in reports by the TAY Project and at the annual symposium, which indicate that no site is immune from destruction.18 PALEOLITHIC Be§parmak Dagi, Latmos Over two decades of surveys by Anneliese Peschlow- Bindokat on Mount Bes.parmak (Latmos) , above clas- sical Herakleia-on-the-Latmos and Bafa Lake at the edge of the Meander Valley, have documented the many Paleolithic settlements there. Early inhabitants took shelter in the lower reaches of its rocky slopes near the fertile lakeshore, plain, and sea, and decorat- ed its caves and rock faces with paintings interpreted as cultic images. Recent years have focused on slopes overlooking the north shore of the lake, between the summer villages of Kapikm and Egridere. Twenty new rock paintings have been identified. One of the best preserved is in a cave at tkiz Ada, where a scene with men and women may represent a wedding. A contem- porary settlement found in 2003, west of Herakleia in the valley of Christus Cave, has also been completely recorded.19 Kaletepe Deresi Nur Balkan-Ath's long-term collaborative project on obsidian quarries and workshops in Cappadocia has centered on Golludag, the world's largest obsidian source with many different beds. Her research team lately turned from Neolithic exploitation to its Paleo- lithic precursors. Five seasons at Kaletepe Deresi 3, an open-air site on a streambed revealed by recent ero- sion, present the longest early Paleolithic sequence in Anatolia: 17 stratified phases representing five levels (V-I) from Lower to Middle Paleolithic (Acheulian, 16 For a study of the culture of looting in Lydia, see Roos- evelt and Luke 2006. 17Mellinkl965,133. 18 TASK Foundation 2004.

Radiocarbon dates span 1.1/1.3 million years ± 200,000/160,000 years b.p., with the penultimate level II related to early Karain. Artifacts occur within sealed occupational deposits for all phases, but finished tools are few. Typically, finds consist of large cores of andesite, rhyolite, and high-quality obsidian intended for distribution and processing elsewhere. Extensive use of obsidian was, however, found in the earliest level (V), especially for biface production (e.g., hand axes). Few organic materials survive the acidic volcanic soil, with the ex- ception of a very early equid mandible from level II (Mousterian).20 EPIPALEOLITHIC, NEOLITHIC, AND CHALCOLITHIC Southern and Southeastern Turkey, Central Turkey, Cappadocia, and Konya Plain Pinarbasi. This site is located in the Konya plain at the northwest foot of Karadag, where today a lime- stone ridge grades down into wetlands that were al- ready present in Epipaleolithic times. The region is thus poor for agriculture but good for wild resources and hunting. Brief excavations here in the early 1990s were carried out as part of the Catalhoyuk Project. They have been revived by Douglas Baird to chart the Epipaleolithic and Early Neolithic periods (13th-ninth millennia b.p.) on the Anatolian plateau. Two settle- ment types are being examined for the transition into early sedentism: an Epipaleolithic rock shelter on the limestone ridge, and a small Early Neolithic open-air site (&lt;0.25 ha, 1 m deep) in front of it that borders the wetlands. Below a top level of Late Neolithic type related to Qatalhoyuk, the rock shelter produced Epipaleolithic settlement debris with lunate microliths, mostly of ob- sidian. Earlier layers contain several burials: one with its skull removed, and another provided with a tortoise carapace containing dentalia-shelljewelry coated in red ocher. These features, and a stone "shaft-straightener" incised with a net pattern, all point to the Levantine Natufian Epipaleolithic and slightly earlier. The open-air site is later (ninth millennium b.p.), contemporary with Cafer Hoyuk on the Euphrates 'east bank, but illustrates a simpler social context. Trenches in two areas gave, as first occupation phase, two levels of curvilinear pit houses, with evidence for red-ocher floor plaster and a wattle-and-daub superstructure. Hearths and pos tholes were located outside. Above this phase was a small cemetery of skeletons that were super-flexed, as though the bodies had been wrapped or put in bags. Deposits contained no cultivated cere- als and no wild ancestors of standard (later) cultivars. The excavator proposes that this tiny hunter-gatherer community was nonetheless sedentarizing - an indica- tion that, like A§ikh, sedentism in the Konya plain was not linked to agriculture.21 Musular. The 2004 season concluded eight seasons of fieldwork at this small Early Neolithic site in west- ern Cappadocia, 400 m southwest of A§ikh, to which it was closely linked. Mihriban 6zba§aran, Istanbul University, reports: Musular is a low-lying site founded within view of A§ikli during its late settlement stage and sharing its Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) cultural features. Initial occupation was followed by a brief Pottery Neolithic phase, indicating some continuity after A§ikh was aban- doned at the close of the aceramic period. The Musular radiocarbon dates, ca. 7600-7000 B.C.E., confirm the archaeological relationship between the two sites. Ar- chitectural remains at Musular were preserved only for the earlier level, its successor being too eroded to assess what type of community it might have supported. Pre-Pottery Neolithic Musular consisted exclusively of two buildings. Building A resembled A§ikh's ritual public building, which is "T" in plan and has interior furnishings such as benches, postholes, pits, a fire- place, and a red-plastered floor. Building A most likely served a similar purpose. The rock-cut walls of Building B were exceptional and unparalleled, however. Con- nected to the use of the buildings was an impressive drainage system, combining deep channels cut into bedrock with sections that were lined and covered with stones. The only other feature here was a sizeable mid- den that had accumulated in a bedrock depression. It served throughout the site's lifetime for waste disposal, none of it domestic. Instead, faunal remains of wild animals (esp. cattle, sheep, and goat, selectively hunt- ed), bone tool blanks (unused or unfinished), and a chipped-stone toolkit with high percentages of burins and arrowheads all indicate that this site's activities were focused on hunting and its by-products. The specialized character of this place suggests that Musular functioned as a late satellite of nearby As, lkh, as did another two contemporary sites identified by survey in the immediate vicinity, at Yellibeden and Gedikba§i. Musular' s two buildings and associated installations must have provided this extended com- munity with some public setting, perhaps as a festival center for hunting and post-hunting activities where 20 For a review of the 2000-2004 seasons, see Slimak et al. 2005.

Leather- and bone-working oc- curred here as subsidiary industries to process waste materials from these festivals.22 Central Anatolian Salt Project. An interdisciplinary survey of salt exploitation in prehistoric Anatolia was begun in 2002 by Burcin Erdogu, Trakya University, and Mihriban Ozba§aran, Istanbul University. They report Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites along the southeastern shore of Tuz Golu (Salt Lake) , Anatolia's most important salt source, and settlements near salty springs on the low and dry terraces of the lake, where large basalt hammerstones and pecking tools could have served for early salt mining.23 Qatalhoyuk. The Catalhoyiik Project, coordinated by Ian Hodder, continues into its second decade as a consortium of international teams responsible for dif- ferent areas on the East Mound, Mellaart's area A and the "deep sounding." The project also maintains active outreach programs designed for schoolchildren and neighboring communities. Interest in the Neolithic site's social geography prompted, in 2004, a return to the highest part of the East Mound for larger-scale exposures, where surface scraping a decade ago sug- gested a street bordered by buildings. A 400 m2 trench revealed several adjacent houses dating to Mellaart's level V. Furnishings, such as the plastered horn cores of bison, were deliberately dismantled when the build- ings were buried in ceremonies that included feast- ing. Characteristic of these Late Neolithic houses is a hearth in the center of the room. This architectural feature was maintained in the Chalcolithic settlement, when it shifted to the West Mound after level V. No evidence suggests social differentiation in the Late Neolithic, either in the furnishings or size of houses or in burial practices. As for the "street," the 2004 excavations showed that it was a midden, filled with trash dumped out from neighborhood households. A broad expansion west of this area in 2005 reached earlier (VII-VI) buildings with multiple rooms, their benches and walls ornamented with horn cores and bull skulls. Into the oven of one house had been placed a cattle skull and dog skeleton at the time the build- ing was condemned. Mellaart's deep sounding, the stratigraphic trench on the East Mound's steep west slope, has now been enclosed and covered with a protective shelter. Levels and features defined by the 1960s excavations here have been cleaned and labeled with informative panels for visitors. In the course of this undertaking, several burials were discovered under the intact E platform of level VH's Building 42 (excavated in 1960). Gifts included a steatopygous figurine and a worked bird ulna, perhaps a musical instrument. A terracotta seal in the shape of a bear suggests that the famous plaster wall sculpture with upturned "feet" and "hands" and red concentric circles represents a bear rather than a female figure. Most exceptional was the burial of a young woman cradling a plastered skull whose face was coated with red paint. The closest Anatolian par- allels are the plastered skulls from Kosjk Hoyuk. The formal burial of a lamb is also the first attested for an animal at this site. Work in Mellaart's area A succeeded in correlating three Late Neolithic layers (levels 0- II) . They include a building, perhaps a charnel house, with nine skeletons on its plastered floor. A new project south of the deep sounding began with systematic surface scraping and the excavation of one burnt building. It produced a remarkable terracotta figurine of a pregnant woman with a crouching skeletal figure on her back, its arms wrapped around her neck. The woman's head was in- serted as a separate piece that is now missing.24 Ko§k Hoyuk. Excavations at this large Neolithic/ Chalcolithic mound in the region of Bor, Nigde, and classical Tyana were revived a decade ago by Aliye Oztan and Suleyman Ozkan for the Nigde Museum. The 2004-2005 seasons expanded the Middle/Early Chalcolithic level 2 - a village of dense residential clusters separated by irregular lanes - by several more well-preserved houses. Rooms were characterized by interior platforms under which were buried plastered skulls, ovens and bins in room corners, and grill-plan annexes. A full-scale model of one is on view in the Nigde Museum. Because the level 2 village was de- stroyed by earthquake, furnishings were found aban- doned on floors and collapsed from shelves. Ceramics were typically black, brown, or red burnished and in- cluded plates with high, standlike ring bases. A deep trench in the north area of the mound investigated its Early Chalcolithic/Late Neolithic levels 3-5. Level 3 was distinguished, as in earlier seasons, by superb pottery with applied relief decoration, which persists in smaller quantities into level 2. Illustrated here are human figures, such as three dancers with arms linked, and a steatopygous woman resembling a Hacilar type, 22 Yor recent publications, see 6zba§aran 2003; Duru and Basaran 2005.

From a level 3 house, a plastered wall painted with red figures also recalls Hacilar pottery designs. Between two houses of this level was found the flexed and headless skeleton of a youth buried with three vessels, one with relief decoration. While levels 5-2 formed a coherent cultural assem- blage, level 1 was clearly different, its neatly planned, one-room houses sharing party walls and laid out in neat rows. Imported painted pottery from two of the level 1 houses is paralleled at Can Hasan 2B and pro- vides a relative chronological range for this latest pre- historic phase. Radiocarbon and dendrochronological dates indicate a sixth-early fifth-millennium B.C.E. span to these five levels.25 Guvercinkayasi. Sevil Giilgiir's 2004 and 2005 seasons at this Early/Middle Chalcolithic Cappadocian site (ra- diocarbon dated to 5200-4750 B.C.E.) exposed 25 m of a casemate wall built of mudbrick on jogged stone foundations and delimiting the housing area exca- vated in previous years to its southwest. Construction technique reflects Ubaid influence, as do stamp seals. Inside the wall lie stone foundations for a room and courtyard with silos, all very burnt, and postholes cut into bedrock were still filled with burnt wood. To this structure was attached a tower filled with ash layers that contained animal horns, such as deer antlers. A large, sloping area paved with rubble connected this citadel with a lower settlement. Successive phases show that the settlement closed in over time as roads and alleys were blocked up. At a late stage, a separate area with a silo and grinding platform was installed behind the houses; their doors faced the other way toward the mound center. Household ovens were carefully built up to a higher floor level with each new house phase. Significant finds include unfired cup fragments and a terracotta figurine whose head (now missing) was separately attached and was perhaps in a different material. The faunal assemblage indicates much meat consumption. Tepecik, Qiftlik. In 2000, the most recent of the Cap- padocian prehistoric projects began in the Melendiz plain at this large Late Neolithic and Middle Chalco- lithic mound (3.5 ha, 10 m ht.), first known from Ian Todd's regional survey in 1966. Erhan Bicakci, Istan- bul University, and his colleagues report: Four prehistoric phases have so far been identified under the Late Roman/Byzantine cemetery, marking the last use of this mound. Its final occupation level, period 2, was a Middle Chalcolithic settlement whose architectural remains are too eroded to provide any coherent plan, but pottery gives it a secure date. The local handmade repertoire finds good parallels in contemporary assemblages from Guvercinkayasi and K6§k Hoyuk level 2, and includes the Gelveri Ware typical of this period. Certain features of the ceramic assemblage also illustrate a lingering Early Chalcolithic tradition that underlines some degree of continuity between the two periods. Evidence of activity in the Early Chalcolithic period 3, in contrast, is substantial, with at least four building phases detected. The lower three are well preserved, whereas the latest is badly damaged, suggesting an interruption before the onset of period 2. Housing in all four phases consisted of single-room mudbrick structures set on neatly laid fieldstone foundations (fig. 2) . Walls and floors were mud-plastered, and the rooms were furnished with pise platforms, hearths, ov- ens, and bins. Housing of the earliest phase included a flagstone pavement on which were found several boar skulls. Pottery was handmade in a rich variety of forms, including carinated wares and jars with tall necks in red-slipped and plain versions; handles and lugs also occur, if rarely. Most remarkable are red- slipped vessels decorated in relief with human figures and animals such as cattle, aurochs, deer, and dog, often depicted in motion. K6§k Hoyiik (level 3) pro- vides close parallels both for the relief vessels and for the general repertoire of this phase. Most of the pot- tery was locally made, but there were a few imports, notably red-polished ribbed bowls. A trench opened in 2004 is investigating Tepecik's earlier occupations. Period 4, immediately below the first Early Chalcolithic settlement, was associated with a stratum of yellowish-brown soil containing much organic material but no occupational debris. Within this deposit were found the flexed burials of six adults and one child. Thus, at least this part of the site stood unbuilt, covered in vegetation and serving only as a cemetery, most likely at the close of the Neolithic pe- riod. A small sounding showed that it was preceded by a Late Neolithic occupation, labeled period 5. Pot- tery diagnostics include dark-faced, red-slipped, black- faced, and decorated wares in decreasing percentages, respectively, and some imports. The assemblage in general recalls Can Hasan 7-3, with contacts to Mersin- Yumuktepe. Tepecik's obsidian tool industry, typical of central Anatolia and exploiting a number of Golludag quarries throughout all of its prehistoric periods, was at its most skilled in this Late Neolithic phase, when it produced pressure-flaked arrowheads of the high- 25 Oztan 2003.

Also in this level were found a number of worked equid phalanges (schematic figurines?) otherwise known from Syria (Djadde) and Romania. Earlier phases, reached in 2005, stressed continuity in the Neolithic settlement and its house plans, each retaining its initial core structure around which later units were added. The Tepecik-(]iftlik excavations are contributing to a fuller definition of the Early and Middle Chalcolithic cultural horizons that extended from K6§k Hoyiik, 50 km to the south, to the north end of Tuz Golii and the western borders of the Konya plain, where it has been documented by surface surveys. In the Late Neolithic, however, the site's orientation was toward the south, even as far as Mersin.26 Southern and Southeastern Turkey Gobekli Tepe. The first decade of excavations by Klaus Schmidt at this Early Neolithic site on the outskirts of §anhurfa concentrated on its sophisticated sacred en- closures. Four have now been investigated fully, and a 2005 geophysical survey indicates the presence of another 20. The four that have been excavated have similar features: a square room built entirely of stone, with rounded corners and two monolithic T-shaped pillars in its center; additional T-shaped pillars set at regular intervals into the rubble walls for structural support; and stone benches lining the room's four sides. At least half of the pillars and bench stones were decorated with reliefs and incisions depicting snakes, scorpions, spiders, bulls, foxes, wild boars, birds, and H-shaped pictographs. Some pillars were anthropomorphized by arms carved in relief on the sides. The number of pillars is now estimated at 200- 300, of which 43 have so far been exposed. Since the same elements of plan, masonry, and decoration are also known at Nevali Qori, they can be recognized as a precise regional style of sacred architecture. The enclosures' exceptional preservation results from the Neolithic practice of deliberately burying buildings, attested also at Qatalhoyuk and Qayonu. Careful at- tention to the backfill layers in Building D (the fourth sacred enclosure, 20 m diam., with walls and pillars standing 5 m high) has radiocarbon dated the top to 7600-7200 B.C.E. and the base to 8240-7780 B.C.E., providing the building with a lifespan in the ninth millennium (PPN-A). It was initially thought that Gobekli 's sacred build- ings were isolated from any settlement. Their backfill contains quantities of occupational debris, however, whose source was discovered in 2004 beyond the four enclosures: a 14 m high mound of long-lived PPN-A settlements with small, oval houses, capped by a thin (1 m) level of PPN-B rectangular housing. Finds in- clude limestone sculpture (predatory animals with teeth exposed, and one holding a human head in its paws) recycled in domestic contexts, as at Nevali Qori. Iconographic similarities for the pillars' scorpi- ons, spiders, and intertwined snakes at contemporary Jerf al-Ahmar, across the Syrian border, now situate a specific PPN-A cultural horizon on the east side of the Euphrates from Nevali Qori and Gobekli to Jerf al-Ahmar. The excavators see Gobekli as a ritual cen- ter serving a 200 km network of sites.27 Salat Cami Yam.

Yutaka Miyake, Tokyo Kaseigakuin University, reports: Two Pottery Neolithic phases lie directly above vir- gin soil, and a third lies higher up the mound slope. The earliest, phase 1, involved pise features and ar- chitecture: a hearth rebuilt six times outside a square, single-room structure; a rectangular building divided into large cells like the latest house plans at Cayonii; and bins and ovens in the phase's later stages. An early cobbled surface produced bag-shaped vessels with lug handles in a dark-burnished fabric heavily tempered with coarse grits. It compares with the earliest pottery found at Akarcay Tepe and Mezraa Teleilat in the Turk- ish Middle Euphrates, and with post-PPN-B deposits in Syria, such as Halula. In phase 2, a dense vegetal temper replaced the mineral inclusions to make an in- troductory version of Proto-Hassuna ware like Ginnig's in northern Iraq, before the introduction of painted or applied decoration and husking trays. These Proto- or Early Hassuna types appear with phase 3, found in 2005 at a higher elevation largely disturbed by Medieval and Iron Age pits. Finds from all three phases include clay quadruped figurines, worked-stone items such as bracelets and vessels, and a chipped-stone industry manufacturing borers and favoring obsidian.28 Salat Tepe. Another Ihsu Dam salvage excavation, east of Bismil on the Salat Cay at Salat Tepe, has since 2000 traced the site's discontinuous and perhaps seasonal occupations in the Ubaid, Middle Bronze Age, Early Iron Age, Hellenistic, and Medieval periods, conclud- ing with a cemetery of the 18th to 19th centuries C.E. A. Tuba Okse, Hacettepe University, reports: Work in 2005 identified the extent of the Ubaid settlement as 120-150 m in diameter. Remains of the more substantial Middle Bronze settlement include a series of burnt rooms in a building probably de- stroyed by earthquake, and radiocarbon dated to the 18th-l7th centuries B.C.E. The overlying Early Iron Age deposits produced pottery and portable hearths but no architecture. The Hellenistic period is repre- sented by grain pits.29 Kenan Tepe. The 32 m high mound and lower town of this 6 ha site east of Bismil on the north bank of the Tigris in the Ihsu Dam area were occupied in the Chalcolithic, Bronze, and Iron Ages, and again in the Medieval period. Remote sensing and excavations have been conducted here since 2000 by the Upper Tigris Archaeological Research Project (UTARP) under the direction of Bradley Parker. Investigations in 2004-2005 focused on Ubaid and Late Chalcolithic levels. The Ubaid settlement covered a limited area: less than 1 ha on what was then a natural hill, on the east slope of the later mound. The subse- quent Late Chalcolithic settlement was also limited to this east side but was far more substantial, covering 4 ha and extending into the lower town, where it repre- sents the earliest occupation above virgin soil. The Ubaid phase involved two levels: the earlier was distinguished by a higher percentage of quality obsid- ian that was also more professionally worked, whereas the later level's obsidian industry was poorer in its raw material (green obsidian) and technical skill. Similar- ly, the later level's ceramic assemblage also had more coarse wares and less fine painted pottery. Architecture consisted of multicelled buildings with neat mudbrick walls, characteristic of the Late Northern Ubaid cul- tural horizon. Since one cell contained pottery, an- other a pile of grain pseudomorphs, they may have been basement rooms supporting living areas like the courtyard house type known from other Ubaid settle- ments. Two of these buildings had foundation burials, one the primary burial of a female in ajar. The Late Chalcolithic settlement in the lower town showed dramatic building collapse and destruction by fire radiocarbon dated to ca. 3100 B.C.E. as well as outside work areas and animal storage pens of simi- lar date. Kenan Tepe does not appear to have been affected by the Uruk expansion, despite having been occupied during that period. Hakemi Use, Diyarbakir. Salvage excavations begun in 2001 at this significant Late Neolithic site 70 km east of Diyarbakir on the south bank of the Tigris in the flood zone of the Ihsu Dam show it to be a northern outpost of the Hassuna-Samarra culture. It was reoc- cupied only sporadically, like many sites in this region. Halil Tekin, Hacettepe University, reports: Three main periods have been identified: period III, the earliest levels on virgin soil, date to the Hassuna- Samarra Late Neolithic sixth millennium B.C.E.; pe- riod II, Middle Bronze (MB) to Late Bronze (LB) Old and Middle Assyrian second millennium B.C.E.; and period I, the Early Iron Age to Late Assyrian first millennium B.C.E. A medieval cemetery was later es- tablished on the mound by a community at Hakemi Use II, a few hundred meters to the east. Agricultural activities have destroyed much of the two later periods, represented only by a few graves and ceramic finds. In contrast, Late Neolithic period III (6100-5950 B.C.E.) is well documented by five building levels with similar plans, pise walls, and outdoor hearths. They match the 28 Miyake 2005, 2006. 29 Okse 2006.</page><page sequence="10">284 B. YILDIRIM AND M.-H. GATES [AJA 111 sequence and some aspects of the material culture in levels 7-4 at Tell Sabi Abyad. Pottery consists of stan- dard monochrome, painted and slipped wares, fine, and orange fine wares, and Dark-Faced Burnished Ware. Metallurgical activities may be indicated by a mortar with a number of hollows and the site's prox- imity to Ergani Maden, a major copper source for the Near East 150 km distant. In 2005, the occupation sequence was confirmed by a sounding to virgin soil, and ceramics provided clearer ties to northern Iraq's Hassuna and Samarra cultures. Husking trays occur in all Neolithic levels. The earliest "purplish ware" found here connects its foundation with Salat Cami Yam, which immediately precedes Hakemi Use. The Archaic Hassuna assem- blage is represented by standard Hassuna pottery (fig. 3) : red-washed, painted, and incised wares and a variant with brown paint on a white ground. Further similarities with Tell Sabi Abyad are found in bitumen- painted vessels and a stone stamp seal. Some fine Samarra pottery seems imported. Twenty-two graves were also excavated, consisting of flexed burials with gifts, including a coarse vessel with four animal legs similar to an example from Mezraa Teleilat.30 Kerk-iisti. A short salvage season was carried out in 2005 by Ash Erim Ozdogan for the Mardin Museum, when this Late Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic site was exposed by a road-cutting near the town of Derik, west of Mardin. It involves Ubaid and Late Halaf occupa- tional levels with a large percentage of finely painted ware, including human figures, preceded by Middle and Early Halaf types and a few sherds of Samarra pot- tery. Several adult skulls and the skeletal remains of infants and juveniles were found in a secondary col- lective burial under the floor of a Halaf structure. The site was also occupied in the second and first millennia B.C.E. and in the Roman and Medieval periods. Yumuktepe, Mersin. Over the past decade, the new Yumuktepe excavations have reformulated, rede- fined, and expanded Garstang's 1930s version of this touchstone occupational sequence for prehistoric and Bronze Age Anatolia. The research program of the latest campaigns has been ascending from Neolithic levels, where the new excavations started, up to this long-lived site's later periods. Isabella Caneva, Univer- sity of Lecce, reports: Operations in 2004 and 2005 were conducted over several chronological contexts, from prehistoric to Hittite, Iron Age, and Medieval, in five different units: two in the ongoing northwest area, a new one on the east slope, and two on top of the mound. Fig. 3. Late Neolithic Hassuna sherds from Hakemi Use (H. Tekin). In the northwest area, the earliest settlement in- vestigated this year belonged to the Late and Final Neolithic phases. For the Late Neolithic, a phase not identified by Garstang, the almost complete plan of the second apsidal house to be discovered at the site was brought to light. These houses proved to be rounded at both ends, giving them an elongated oval plan that was not previously identified. Directly above the sec- ond house lies the big stone wall partly uncovered in past campaigns. It can now be followed for 15 m, ris- ing about 1.5 m in its newly exposed stretch, and was flanked by a pebbled road that climbed up the slope toward the east and north. East of the road, aligned postholes indicate the presence offences or light struc- tures. This phase, dated 6886 ± 65 b.p., is characterized by high-quality pottery with painted geometric motifs on a cream-colored surface. Extending this exposure north revealed a succes- sion of terraced settlements that cut into each other, creating an expanse of horizontal stratigraphy from the Neolithic at the south end to Chalcolithic, Bronze, and Medieval periods at the northern one. The Middle Chalcolithic terrace, dug directly into the terrace wall of the Final Neolithic phase, contained two rows of dwellings separated by a road. Traces of new rooms for this dwelling complex were uncovered on both sides of the road. They were dated 5605 ± 65 b.p., and can therefore be considered contemporary with the Mersin XVI citadel (5739 ± 65 b.p.). Furnishings in- cluded a small stone cup with thick walls, presumably a crucible, attesting to smelting activities here, and a sealing impressed with a geometric design, the first to 30 For reports of the 2004-2005 seasons, see Tekin 2006a, 2006b; see also Tekin 2005.</page><page sequence="11">2007] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY, 2004-2005 285 be found at the site. The Chalcolithic structures were in turn cut by several terraces, dated to Early Bronze (EB) II by white-painted, red-slipped pottery known from Tarsus and by radiocarbon sampling to 2800- 2470 B.C.E. The northernmost and most destructive terracing belonged to Byzantine storage facilities still containing big pithoi. South of this terraced area, work continued in 2003 in a small trench opened 2 m above the Final Neolithic deposit. Here was uncovered a two-roomed mudbrick structure belonging to a Halaf-related phase (6495 ± 50 b.p.) . The absence of stone foundations makes this phase distinct from the underlying Final Neolithic one, although the pottery shows almost the same charac- teristics despite a 400-year interval. On the mound's east side, a new step trench was opened below the Medieval level to investigate Iron Age levels and to extend the Hittite city wall partially uncovered in previous excavations. Stone foundations representing the first Iron Age structures to be recov- ered at Yumuktepe were found in association with pot- tery of highest quality, including painted wares dating from the seventh to fifth centuries B.C.E. Medieval Yumuktepe consisted of a settlement on top of the mound and several terrace buildings on the slopes. Excavations in 2004 explored a monumental building that, with a huge fortification wall surround- ing the medieval settlement, belong to the site's final occupation phase of the 12th century C.E. (952 ± 50 b.p.). The structure, identified as a church, saw at least three different building phases distinguished by stratified stone-paved and plastered floors, and by changes in architectural layout and function. South of the building ran a wide road paved with river gravel. A square hole in the middle of the road gave access to an underground drainage system. Immediately below the modern surface were found a number of human burials. Skeletons lay extended on their backs with arms crossed on the chest, and all were oriented similarly with the head to the west. Some were simply buried in pits, others in wooden coffins. Since both sexes and all ages, including juveniles and children, were represented, it is clear that this cemetery was not reserved for church clergy but instead served a population living in the area after the abandonment of the site.31 Domuztepe. One decade and 2,000 m2 of excavations directed by Elizabeth Carter and Stuart Campbell have determined that most of this 20 ha site south of Maras, dates to the Halaf period, since soundings show that areas with later material (Late Hellenistic through Byz- antine and Islamic) have Halaf deposits underneath. Domuztepe 's size was thus exceptional for the Halaf culture and involved ambitious community enterprise such as fill projects to create broad, flat areas and ter- racing, perhaps for water management. The center of the Early Halaf site (mid sixth mil- lennium B.C.E.) was occupied by an artificial red-clay terrace functioning as a ritual area on which were set ovens, kilns, and crushed burials. Its edges were demarcated on four sides by a series of long, shallow ditches recut whenever the terrace was raised. The ditches evidently received items associated with the terrace, since they contained finds remarkable both in number and quality - obsidian vessels, seals, and tools, and spectacular figural pottery. One vessel shows a tree, birds (vultures?) with two headless bodies, an isolated head, and a large, standing figure holding something upright. It may refer to a ritual associated with mass burials or to the carnage of battle. A figu- rine-shaped vessel, 20 cm high, represents a stylized female with painted clothing or tattoos. A single eye is painted on the vessel's flared neck. Its closest paral- lel was found at Yarimtepe II/III in northern Iraq. A mass burial pit (ca. 40 individuals) was later cut into the terrace. A cluster of small pits containing human and animal skulls was found to its south. The south- ern boundary of the site was a line of shallow pits also containing unusually fine pottery. The stratigraphic sequence situates the skull pits immediately after the mass burial was filled in, and in general assigns a long lifespan to the ditches and its terrace. This ritual center was abandoned and replaced by a later Halaf level with architecture of tholos type and walls set on stone foundations. Housing and a district of square kilns were excavated in 2004 and 2005. Local industry, apart from ceramics, is attested by obsidian bead blanks, for which many finished examples have also been recovered. The 2005 season also investigated the site's later pe- riods: a substantial building of a third- to 10th-century C.E. date on the mound summit, where a hoard of 285 late Constantinian bronze coins was discovered, and to the southwest what may prove to be a church. Late Antique Domuztepe, like its Halaf precursor, occupied a large area estimated at 7-8 ha.32 Kazane Hoyuk. Another exceptionally large Halaf site, in the southern outskirts of §anlmrfa, has since 1996 been investigated by Patricia Wattenmaker with the §anhurfa Museum. Halaf ceramics cover a 20 ha 31 For a report of the 2004 season, see Caneva et al. 2006. 32 For a report of the 2004 season, see Carter and Campbell 2006.

GATES [AJA 111 area and occur in every sounding and trench, but it has yet to be established whether they reflect a single site or several adjacent villages. Ubaid deposits overlying the Halaf show that Kazane maintained its large scale during Chalcolithic times. A high mound then formed over a succession of later periods, and a lower town extended at its foot during the late EB and MB I. Recent seasons have focused on the lower settle- ment district, under constant disturbance from irriga- tion ditches. In 2004, excavations southeast of the high mound found Halaf-period housing with rectilinear plans and tholoi and an outside pebbled area. Finds from this domestic context included a bowl with its base perforated ("ritually killed") and placed inside a wall foundation, a cache of astragali in a room, a stamp seal, Halaf sherds with figural decoration (on- ager, deer), and a small (headless) female figurine painted with a necklace and band motif at the hips, like examples from Yarimtepe in northern Iraq and more recently from Domuztepe. In another part of the lower town, a magnetometer survey that showed a large building and streets was confirmed by finding the broad stone foundations of a Middle Bronze Age building whose rooms con- tained storage jars and stoppers impressed with cylin- der seals. Ubaid deposits underlie this building. Door sealings were also found in a domestic district, dated to the mid-late third millennium by pottery of Kur- ban FVb type. A nearby Middle Bronze tomb was richly furnished with bronze pins, a carnelian bead, and an obsidian knife, again cut into Halaf deposits. Tilbes Hoyiik. A long-term salvage project directed by Jesus Gil Fuensanta, Alicante University, with the §anhurfa Museum, now focuses in the vicinity of Tilbes on sites threatened by the Carchemish Dam. Fuensanta reports: We exposed up to a dozen buildings over 1,200 m2 of a well-planned, single-occupation Chalcolithic site with Northern Ubaid-like remains near Tilbes Hoyiik. Although the buildings are separate, it is possible that they functioned in an interconnected way as part of a larger structure. Among the plans of the buildings, we distinguished at least two bipartite and one large tripartite building, which is the largest, covering more than 90 m2. The highest concentration of the Ubaid- like painted pottery, which consists of rectilinear and wave motifs as well as schematic humanlike figurines, in isolation or in combination, was found in this build- ing, together with unusual and distinctive examples such as pictographlike motifs. The grittiness of the sherds, which have traces of the wheel or slow-wheel, and a sherd of Coba bowl provide the best diagnostic evidence for dating the site to the Late Chalcolithic 1 period in the fourth millennium. The discovery of more remains of this culture a few hundred meters away from Tilbes Hoyiik at an elevated position east of this mound suggests that settlement may have shifted to these places to escape an early fourth-millennium B.C.E. flooding of the river after the Late Ubaid phas- es. The upper mound of Tilvez Hoyiik was further sur- veyed to understand better its EB I occupation. Finds included the string-cut bowls, champagne cups, cyma recta bowls, and fine ware, as well as reserved slip ware typical of the site and period.33 Surtepe, Birecik. In 2004, the Spanish Archaeologi- cal Mission led by Fuensanta resumed work at this 20 ha site upstream from Birecik on the east side of the Carchemish/Birecik Dam. Soundings conducted on the mound's north side in 2000-2001 determined that the site was occupied in the Late Chalcolithic, Early Bronze, and Late Iron Ages. In 2005, a step trench to reach bedrock was initiated on the south slope. Finds include a Late Uruk house foundation, ajar fragment with a Late Uruk seal impression, and two cylinder seals with typical Uruk scenes involving warfare. As at Tilbes, Late and Terminal Ubaid fea- tures, such as bitumen-painted ware, were identified below these deposits. Early Bronze levels were found above them, separated by a thick ash layer that sealed off the Late Chalcolithic phase. The site's last (prob- ably Achaemenid) occupation consisted of a monu- mental brick building with walls preserved 2 m high. Although quite empty, it did produce a stamp seal of Persian type and a stone tablet inscribed in an unusual form of Aramaic. Cilicia, Misis. The Cilicia Survey Project, led by Giovanni Salmeri and Anna Lucia D'Agata, is study- ing the acculturation processes of settlements between the Ceyhan and Seyhan Rivers during the Late Bronze Age and the fourth century B.C.E., particularly in re- lation to Hellenic cultures. Systematic survey of Misis (ancient Mopsouhestia) in 2004 documented Late An- tique and medieval fortification walls at the west side of the city and a series of Middle Iron Age features on the eastern slopes of the Lower Hill. Pottery associated with this period shows significant Cypriot influence. A stratigraphic sequence of Middle to Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic date was identified at the western slope of the acropolis. It included brown to reddish burnished pottery as well as obsidian cores and tools supporting V. Se ton-Williams' conviction that the acropolis saw the site's earliest occupation.34 33 Fuensanta etal. 2006. 34 Salmeri and D'Agata 2006.</page><page sequence="13">2007] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY, 2004-2005 287 Central and Western Turkey Bademagaci. Excavations at this 100 x 200 m Neo- lithic and Early Bronze mound, 50 km north of An- talya at the Qubuk pass into the Tauros Mountains, continue into their second decade. Refik Duru and Giilsun Umurtak, Istanbul University, report: Investigations in 2004 and 2005 of Neolithic levels in the southeast part of trench A found that the stone, grill-like foundations thought to be contemporary with Early Neolithic (EN) II/4 and II/3 building levels continue under the EB II settlements on the mound's south side and may be part of a defensive system. Four storage bins built from separate clay plaques and filled with grain were found in House 7 (EN 11/ 3) on the north side as well as a fine stamp seal with a swastika motif. In 2005, at the west corner of trench A, a kiln- like structure in the EN I/I level was perhaps used for sacred functions. Underlying this level were structures equipped with storage vessels and silos and destroyed by fire. Work was completed in deep trench 2 when virgin soil was reached just below 9 m. The building technique and plans of Bademagaci 's Early Neolith- ic structures (fig. 4) are comparable to those from Hacilar and Hoyucek. An extramural cemetery has not been found. Burials in the Early Neolithic settle- ment are primarily for babies and children, placed in a flexed position under the floors of houses. Excavation of Early Bronze levels on the mound's northwest slope clarified that the earliest EB II/3 settlement was planned symmetrically across the east and west slopes of the mound. Its megaron houses, of which 24 have been found so far, were oriented so that entrances faced the center of the mound. The entire settlement was surrounded by a stone glacis. Two towers flanking a northwest gate into the city were uncovered below the glacis at the north edge of the excavated area, where a bronze stamp seal was also found. In 2005, excavations of the less-studied southern half of the mound found evidence at its west slope of further monumental EB II structures and the continuation of the stone glacis. This first Early Bronze level was founded on the abandoned EN II mound after a gap of several thousand years.35 Dedecik/Heybeli Tepe, Metropolis. Excavations by Recep Meric and Clemens Lichter at Dedecik/Heybeli Tepe, 1 km south of Metropolis, uncovered Late Neolithic to Early Chalcolithic strata, whose ceramics are par- alleled at Hacilar. Obsidian from Cycladic Melos was imported for the local chipped-stone industry - the earliest known instance of its use in western Anatolia and a sign of early Aegean ties with this coast.36 UlucakHoyuk, Izmir. Altan Qilingiroglu's excavations at this llm high prehistoric mound in the industrial outskirts of Izmir have finally succeeded in enclosing a 3 ha area of the site to protect it from surrounding development. The site's later phases - Late Chalcolith- ic (level III), EB II (level II), and Late Roman/Early Byzantine (level I) - claimed the attention of cam- paigns since 1995. The project has now reached the Neolithic occupation, of particular importance since this period is otherwise unexcavated on the eastern Aegean coast. Two well-preserved Neolithic levels (IV, V) are differ- entiated by distinct architectural layouts and building materials. The earlier level V houses were single-room units with party walls made of wood posts with pise in- fill but no wattle. In contrast, those of the later level IV were built of mudbrick on stone foundations. Their walls are in parts preserved to a height of 2 m, on oc- casion retaining a plaster coating but rarely painted. The ceramic assemblages of the two levels are, however, similar and do not reflect this architectural change; both have white-slipped wares decorated with red paint, although quality improved in level IV. Containers in both levels stored wheat and barley separately. A level V house was also furnished in one corner as a workshop, with broken stone tools and a work platform. Other finds include quantities of clay loomweights, heaps of clay slingballs, numerous bone tools, shells for decora- tion, and a terracotta stamp or mold with geometric designs. Figurines are rare, but a male and female pair found in a terracotta vessel containing flints suggests a ritual intent. The most significant find of 2005 was a flat figurine preserving remains of a finely woven fabric. Levels Va, IVb, and IVa have been dated by radiocar- bon analysis to 6230-6055 B.C.E., 6030-5895 B.C.E., and 5990-5730 B.C.E., respectively.37 Coskuntepe. Turan Takaoglu reports that his 2004 survey in the Ayvacik/Qanakkale region has located the westernmost Neolithic site known in Anatolia. At the hilltop site of Co§kuntepe, 1.5 km inland from the seacoast, he found evidence for early sixth-millennium ceramic production, a clay stamp similar to types from the west-central Anatolian Lake District, and grinding stones of local andesite and basalt. The many grinding stones suggest an economy involving their production and trade rather than one based on agriculture or fish- ing. This may explain why the settlement is located on 35 Duru and Umurtak 2006a, 2006b; see also Umurtak 2005, 2006. 36 For the 2004 season's report, see Meric et al. 2006. 37 For a final report of the excavations from 1995 to 2002, see Qilingiroglu et al. 2004.

Parz- inger) at Early Bronze Kanhgecit and Neolithic/ Chalcolithic A§agi Pinar; a regional survey; an ar- chaeological park displaying replicas of local ancient building types made of wood with thatched roofs; a cultural preservation project for historical buildings in Kirklareli proper; and an archaeological research center at Ahmetce Koyu. A§agi Pinar illustrates the Neolithic/Chalcolithic cultural horizon shared by the Balkans and Thrace and extending into northwestern Anatolia. The early levels 6 and 7, further exposed in 2004-2005 to the north- east of previous trenches, were contemporary with the Karanovo I - II culture, as demonstrated by imported painted wares, but would represent the autonomous and original core culture for Neolithic Thrace. The next phases, level 5, and especially 4, already well doc- umented in previous seasons, adopted the common Balkan-Thracian culture of the Middle Chalcolithic ("Later Neolithic" Karanovo III-IV) - black vessels with incised, white-filled decoration and figurines of the same ceramic style in the shape of square boxes with four feet and a human head. Another anthropo- morphized type has hands and arms in relief on the sides of the vessel. All were found in household con- texts. These also produced masses of slingballs and impressions on pise of woven mats. Despite intensive pitting from an overlying Iron Age cult center, the burnt wood housing of level IV is well preserved thanks to roof collapse that sealed indoor bins and their con- tents. It included a bead workshop identified by thou- sands of spondylus shell and malachite beads.39 BRONZE AGE Western Turkey Kulluoba.

Their layout was regular, square to rectangu- lar (typically ca. 30 x 20 m), and followed the same principle: a megaron unit was always located on one side of the complex as its single large room to which were attached a number of smaller rooms. Direct ac- cess led into the megaron from outside. The rest of the complex could be entered from the megaron and from separate outer entryways, although some of the rooms formed autonomous units. Each megaron had a hearth in the center. Complex II, excavated in 2004- 2005, had a ramp of wood planks paved with pebbles leading up to the megaron entrance, which was faced by a three-columned porch. Inside the megaron were found seven pithoi in situ. These houses thus com- bined a formal reception place (the megaron) with an extensive residential component (small rooms). The houses were set inside a square enclosure whose north gate with attached tower was excavated in 2004. This EB II occupational phase has now been situated within an overall site sequence thanks to a careful pro- gram of soundings. The limited distribution of early EB III material, lying 4 m above the EB II deposits, indicates that the site shrank into a small settlement for this later period. On the East Terrace, or lower settlement area, a sounding at its farthest east edge un- covered an EB I deposit underneath a thin Hellenistic one, close to the modern surface. Finally, a trench on the mound's west side gave a stratigraphic sequence from the Final Chalcolithic/Early Bronze transition into earliest EB I, demonstrating that Kiilluoba was or- ganized - long before Demircihoyuk - as an enclosed and fortified settlement whose houses opened onto a common central courtyard. A shift from central Ana- tolian to Aegean ceramic (i.e., cultural) traditions oc- curred in late EB II and the onset of EB III. It is also reflected by the change in settlement plans from EB II's formal citadel and lower town to the village of EB III. Prosperity throughout the Early Bronze Age is indicated by the many metal finds. The site has also produced a rich collection of terracotta figurines and unusual EB III pottery from a pit that may have been intended for votive offerings.40 Eski§ehir. Taciser Tufekci-Sivas, Anadolu University, reports that he has recorded 1 3 previously unknown mounds, largely of the Early Bronze Age, while survey- ing the Eski§ehir province.41 Midaion/Karahoyuk. A. Nejat Bilgen, Anadolu Uni- versity, reports that her survey at Midaion, one of the largest mounds in the Alpu plain, on the banks of the Porsuk and 30 km east of Eski§ehir, found ceramic evidence for settlements from the third millennium B.C.E. to the Islamic periods.42 Aizanoi. See below, under "Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman: Phrygia." Harmanoren. This cemetery, typical of western Ana- tolian Early Bronze traditions and located along the Isparta-Egridir road, must have served the nearby settlement at Gondurle Hoyiik, a large mound where the Isparta Museum has established a Late Chalco- lithic through Roman sequence thanks to several soundings. Excavations since 1993 by Mehmet Ozsait on behalf of the Isparta Museum have uncovered more than 1 00 burials, all following the same practice: multiple inter- ments in pithoi facing southeast in a shallow sloping pit occasionally lined with stones to hold the pithos more securely in place. The jar mouth was sealed with pithos sherds and/or stones, in some cases with a sin- gle large, flat stone, and surrounded by stone pack- ing. Bodies were flexed, at least for the latest burial in the jar. Tomb gifts were placed inside the pithos and outside beside the cover. The pithos types date the cemetery to a long span of use from EB II- III and into the EB-MB I transition.43 Qine-Tepecik. Excavations directed by Seving Gii- nel, Hacettepe University, began in 2004 at this low- lying prehistoric mound 36 km south of Aydm. She reports: Three years of surveying the interior plain of the Meander Valley determined that Cine-Tepecik prom- ised the best perspective on this region's prehistoric cultural sequence. Soundings and trenches on the mound's summit and west side have now confirmed this expectation. Settlement deposits of the Chalco- lithic and Bronze Age are substantial, with ceramic types characteristic of the Aegean and western Anato- lia. A single Late Neolithic sherd sets the site's founda- tion even earlier. Late Bronze Age ties with the west are indicated by Late Helladic (LH) IIIB and LH IIIC pottery and continue into the Iron Age with Geomet- ric types. Trench locations indicate topographic shifts over time. Excavation on the mound summit located Early Bronze and Late and Middle Chalcolithic deposits di- rectly below a shallow level of possibly Late Hellenistic wall foundations, the latter much disturbed by a cem- etery in use from late antiquity onward. Chalcolithic buildings made use of structural wood.

Pot- tery is gray-burnished, pitchers are common, and one ware type was decorated with grooves. Marble "violin" figurines from Chalcolithic deposits may represent the earliest occurrence of this idol type. In contrast, soundings on the mound's west slope encountered Middle and Late Bronze deposits overlying those of the Early Bronze. A broad stone foundation (wdth. 2.20 m), now exposed over many meters, represents a possible candidate for a Middle/Late Bronze forti- fied enclosure.44 Bademgedigi Tepesi, Metropolis. Major prehistoric dis- coveries in the vicinity of Metropolis, particularly for Mycenaean relations with Minoan and Cycladic cul- tures, have been conducted in recent years by Recep Meric, Dokuz Eyliil University. He reports: Significant Bronze Age levels were identified inside a city wall at the north side of Bademgedigi Tepesi, whose latest occupation dates to the mid seventh cen- tury B.C.E. ALH IIIC phase (1190-1050/1030 B.C.E.) with local and Mycenaean ceramics, including a krater fragment with a human figure, suggests a sacred area on the mound's east slope. Below these were found deposits with Late Minoan (LM) IIA2 ceramics and a cream-slipped fragment of a late Middle Cycladic cup, together with local Anatolian wares. The earliest level contained Middle Minoan (MM) II and LM IA pottery in an assemblage again dominated by local Middle Bronze types.45 Liman Tepe. Long-term excavations at Liman Tepe, classical Klazomenai's precursor on the Izmir Bay at Urla, are taking this Bronze Age harbor back to its earliest phases. Hayat Erkanal, Ankara University, reports: Excavations to determine the first settlement at this site discovered at its northern limit a Late Chalcolithic occupation with circular structures made of wood and mudbrick. Finds include pattern-burnished pottery associated with Cycladic Keos and Kephala, conical- based marble cups, obsidian arrowheads, figurines, and stamps. In one level, a burnt destruction layer in a house preserved a concentration of carbonized wheat. The second major area of focus was the EB I defensive system (fig. 5) located beside the Izmir- Ce§me road. Twenty-five meters of defense wall are now exposed. They include a monumental city gate flanked by rectangular bastions with mudbrick walls on stone foundations. Baglararasi, Qesme. Today, this ancient port at the tip of the Izmir peninsula near Qe§me is located 100 m inland from the coast, and its Bronze Age harbor, sheltered between two peaks, is buried under alluvial fill. Excavations since 2002 show that it was a major port city in the third and second millennia B.C.E. Hayat Erkanal, Ankara University, reports: The latest occupation level at the site is a Late Bronze phase that included a rubbish pit with My- cenaean LH IIIB2-IIIC vessels. Two major Middle Bronze occupations preceded it. The earlier one had a planned urban layout of pebble-paved streets lined with house blocks and workshops. Houses were large, rectangular, and probably two-storied, built with mud- brick and sometimes rubble walls. Floors and walls were plastered, some with paint still visible. Workshops engaged in textile, metal, wood, ceramic, and, most significantly, wine production, the last previously un- attested for Middle Bronze Anatolia. The sweet Ce§me wine known in the first millennium B.C.E. as "Patriri- on" may thus have originated much earlier. Well- preserved house furnishings, trapped under earth- quake collapse as in contemporary Miletos, provide a detailed domestic inventory for this period. Geo- morphologic study has identified a volcanic ash layer probably associated with the Thera eruption ca. 1628 B.C.E. The later Middle Bronze settlement essentially maintained the previous one's plan. Imported ce- ramics came from Crete, the Cyclades, and mainland Greece, but the bulk was Minoan, including locally produced and imported loomweights. Among the Anatolian sites known to have Minoan pottery, the concentration at Baglararasi, Ce§me, is second only to Miletos, now considered a Minoan colony. A sig- nificant Minoan population may have resided here too, together with local residents firmly attested by local ceramic production and finds. The MM III-LM IA transition is also precisely documented in this sec- ond Middle Bronze phase. In 2005, excavations 30 m west of the Middle Bronze settlement discovered three parallel walls dated by as- sociated wheelmade plates to EB IIIA. A more substan- tial EB II level consisted of a central court and houses with trapezoidal and rectangular plans opening onto two narrow streets with pebble paving. Floors were packed earth and in one case plastered, as was a hearth. The houses remained in use over multiple periods and contained spindle whorls and loomweights, bone and chipped-stone tools, and marine items. Handmade pottery was mainly black- or brown-slipped and bur- nished; less frequently, red-slipped and burnished. Shapes include round-shouldered jars with horizontal handles and tripod vessels.

Pottery from the later phases maintained the earlier forms but introduced handles with string holes. Also in 2005, soundings 20 m north of the Early Bronze settlement and 30 m west of the Middle Bronze one found Middle Bronze deposits rising from north to south on terraces, which had destroyed part of the underlying EB II occupation. Middle Bronze archi- tecture here is similar to that of the Early Bronze and consists of houses with parallel walls and a street with pebble paving. Panaztepe. The project led by Armagan Erkanal-Oktu has in two decades exposed a wide range of compo- nents for this Bronze Age and later coastal town lo- cated west of Menemen on the Izmir Bay's north side. A source for the site's drinking water was located at a series of springs and caves, some enlarged into cis- terns and wells, from which channels brought water down to the city from the second millennium B.C.E. through Ottoman times. The current excavation area has moved east to the ancient harbor zone to connect the site's Late Bronze occupational sequence with its extensive contemporary cemetery. Domestic Late Bronze contexts (fig. 6) provide a valuable chrono- logical framework for correlations with grave goods, such as a pithos type used for jar burials as well as in the house. Pottery and finds closely match the Troy sequence for the later 13th to 12th centuries B.C.E. Erkanal-Oktii reports: The sequence in this 320 m2 exposure consists of Ot- toman, Byzantine, Late Roman, Archaic, and Geomet- ric levels overlying an alluvial stratum from the Gediz River. Below it lie four Late Bronze occupational lev- els. In the latest one, finds from a rectangular building with six rooms correspond to Troy VIIb2 (mid-late LH IIIC) . Two structures and an open area with a well and stone paving in the next level down date to Troy Vlla-b (early LH IIIC) . Preceding it was a well-built structure with broad walls, contemporary with Troy Vim (LH IIIB). The earliest Late Bronze level is a large com- plex (14 x 12.5 m) with seven phases spanning Troy Vlh-m (LH IIIB) . Another 3 m of sterile alluvial soil seal these Late Bronze phases from their predecessors and render them nearly inaccessible.46 Troy.

That progress should have contin- ued without pause serves as yet another affirmation of Korfmann's managerial skills and his ability to inspire associates with his own archaeological perspective. The project participants intend to continue future Troy excavations along the lines of the previous years and to implement his heritage management plan for the site, which attracts more than 200,000 visitors annu- ally. Research on the Troy VI citadel and its lower town is enlarging the scale of the Late Bronze settlement with each season. Sword pommels and attachments for war chariots were found lying in debris washed down from the citadel onto Vl-VIIa terrace walls and paths. Excavations around Troy VI' s East Gate exposed a Vlf phase structure inside it, its room paved in one corner and equipped with a drain, perhaps for a toilet. Troy VI mudbrick walls were uncovered below the northeast corner of the square bastion on which the Athena tem- ple was constructed, and contemporary deposits have been probed several hundred meters to the citadel's northeast and south. The project's geophysical survey also provides conclusive documentation for the size of Troy's Bronze Age (and Hellenistic) settlements (fig. 7) . The geomagnetic survey, completed for the entire site in 2005, indicates conclusively that the Troy VI and Hellenistic lower towns extended 400 m to the citadel's east and south, while the area to its north stayed unbuilt, and the east only sparsely. As for the putative Late Bronze harbor on the coast at Yenikoy Kesik Kanal, pollen recovered through a systematic program of coring located a freshwater swamp that was unsuitable for navigation and anchorage. Excavations well outside the citadel to its northwest, where Blegen had discovered a Bronze Age cemetery, produced instead a house of Early Archaic date, a pe- riod otherwise poorly represented at this site. To the citadel's northeast, a Troy II rampart and outer fortifi- cation wall show that the Early Bronze lower town was also enclosed. The latter and Troy III housing were eventually buried under the Troy IV terrace when the second-millennium city expanded beyond the confines of the Early Bronze town. Site preservation consolidated the Troy II megara inside the South Gate and laid out more marked paths and stairways for visitors. It is hoped that the consid- erable and lengthy efforts to declare the Troy area a national park will gain force from the recent found- ing of a Canakkale-based society whose mission is to see this project succeed.47 47 See also Korfmann 2002.

In 2004, Co§kun Ozgiinel be- gan sounding at this prehistoric mound located 200 m north of the Smintheion sanctuary. Chalcolithic levels from the first half of the fifth millennium B.C.E. illustrate ceramic connections to Thrace, Troy, and the eastern Aegean. Kanhgegit, Kirklareli. Mehmet Ozdogan's research program on Thracian prehistory investigates its Early Bronze horizon at this site, which shows that an abrupt cultural change overtook at least this part of Thrace in the later third millennium. At Kanhgecit, megaron- plan architecture and Troy II (EB III) pottery were implanted, presumably by a population coming from coastal western Anatolia to exploit nearby copper mines. The megara were first revealed a decade ago, inside a small citadel fortified with a stone-revetted rampart made of clay packing (glacis) . This citadel has now acquired a lower town, also protected by a mas- sive enclosure whose heavy stone foundations probably supported a wood superstructure. Housing followed a strict layout, with 14 x 6 m megara aligned side by side and built of mudbrick. Plan and building mate- rial point to an intrusive community installed at one time. Housing was especially dense in the lower town's northeast sector. In the southwest, an open space with two deep pits, into which votive offerings were depos- ited over a long period of ritual use, imply the presence of a sacred area. Soundings below this EB III megaron level revealed a dense area of ovens and hearths, in line with earlier local settlement tradition. Two phases of EB III buildings in the lower town were followed by an impoverished level, when the site contracted and the fortification wall went out of use at the close of EB III or immediately thereafter. On top of the abandoned fortification wall was constructed an enigmatic square building in a new technique: its foundations of large stones had earth packed between them, and the superstructure of small stones perhaps formed a dome or vault. This possibly sacred structure is unfortunately much damaged by the Hellenistic re- occupation of the site. Menek§e Qatagi, Tekirdag.

Its earthquake destruction debris contained both Helle- nistic and sixth-century B.C.E. silver coins. Black Sea Coast and Central Turkey Ikiztepe. The 30th campaign at this cluster of four mounds overlooking the Black Sea near Samsun, 7 km northwest of Bafra, was carried out in 2005, where Onder Bilgi has been investigating the early history of northern Anatolian metallurgy since 1980. Excavations of the past two years focused on the early stratigraphy of Mound 1. A 150 m2 sounding on its north slope (area M) traced its foundation on virgin soil to EB I, represented by three separate levels. They were suc- ceeded by six levels of houses and workshops, all dated to the Early Bronze Age. Fixtures of these wood build- ings for both periods are burnt floors, platforms, well- preserved ovens, figurines, bone tools, and quantities of loomweights, combs, and spindle whorls, attesting a lively cottage industry in textiles. Overlying this occu- pational phase is an extensive EB III cemetery known from previous excavations in this sector.48 QadirHoyuk. Project director Ron Gorny, University of Chicago, now identifies this prominent, 30 m high mound near the village of Peyniryemez in Yozgat prov- ince with Hittite Zippalanda. He reports: Most of our 2005 Byzantine efforts were directed toward an extensive area on the terrace, now linked by architecture and ceramics to the citadel (kastron?) previously excavated on top of the mound. They con- firm a long Byzantine occupation. The latest level of the terrace is contemporary with the last level on the mound (IXa), dated to the 11th century C.E. by pot- tery, coins, and a sealing of Samuel Alusianos, gen- eral under Romanus IV Diogenes (1068-1071 C.E.). This level appears hastily built and perhaps destroyed in a siege. Material remains suggest a site under the constant threat of attack. It was preceded by a Middle Byzantine phase of some prosperity (levels IXb, IXc) . Level IXc produced, together with a large proportion of coarse wares, some fine ceramics, especially late Af- rican Red Slip Ware, datable to the beginning of the eighth century. An earlier fifth- to sixth-century level (IXd) contained substantially more African Red Slip, including a spectacular stamped platter of authentic type. This prosperous and long-lived Byzantine commu- nity was severely affected by the Arab invasions of the eighth century, whose lingering impact may explain the deteriorating nature of Qadir's final settlement. The 2005 investigations reached the Early Iron Age on the south slope. A structure discovered below the Middle Iron wall and gateway there displayed unique pottery and may be connected to the enigmatic "Dark Age" that followed on the heels of the Hittite empire. With the structure were several round plaster surfaces and many spindle whorls, perhaps for a weaving and dyeing industry. Late Bronze Qadir Hoyuk, we now believe, repre- sents the Hittite cult city of Zippalanda, center for the worship of the Stormgod of Zippalanda. The eastern trench in 2005 yielded a complex of rooms that may be part of a temple, dated by shattered vessels early in the Old Hittite period (ca. 1700-1650 B.C.E.) . A pit dug into the floor of one room produced an array of cult materials. An Old Hittite stamp seal was found on another room floor, along with a stone bull figurine nearly identical to examples from nearby Ali§ar. On the north slope (area 6) was a monumental gate prob- ably built during the Hittite empire. The 2005 excava- tions showed that it continued to exist for some time after the empire's collapse, since a Late Iron casemate wall was found to block off the original Late Bronze entrance. Three periods of usage are clearly visible. There is evidence, too, that the nearby mountain of Qaltepecan can be identified with Mount Daha, the "beloved mountain of the Stormgod of Zippalanda." Visible on its surface are walls for several large struc- tures that could be associated with the Hittite period. A 40 x 80 m enclosure just below the summit may rep- resent the temple area, approached by a gated court- yard compound (a Hittite hilammar) to its east. These discoveries correspond closely to how the Hittite texts describe Zippalanda and nearby Mount Daha, where a mountaintop edifice served as counterpart to the storm god's city temple during his stay on the mountain for the various Hittite festivals. The texts also mention a hilammar located very close to the temple. It is prob- ably not coincidental that an ancient road descends the gentle slope behind the mountain. This roadway leads through the present-day village of Karahacih to- ward Comak Dag. Ali§ar Hoyiik (Ankuwa?) is located on that mountain's south slope, and Salur Hoyiik (Kat- apa?) occupies the south one. Both settlements would have been reached by the king's chariot in a relatively short period of time, as described in the Hittite texts.49 (Other recently proposed contenders for Mount Daha 48 For a summary of the 2004-2005 seasons, see Bilgi 2005, 2006a, 2006b. 49 For a report of the 2004 season, see Paley 2006.</page><page sequence="21">2007] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY, 2004-2005 295 and Zippalanda are Kerkenes Dag and neighboring Ku§akh Hoyiik [not the Ku§akh near Sivas].)50 Kaman-Kalehoyuk. Sachihiro Omura's excavations at this major Cappadocian site have in recent seasons recovered large areas of its Middle Bronze and Late Bronze I phases (strata IIIc, Illb) , when Kaman flour- ished as an urban center midway between Bogazkoy and Kayseri. Its commercial and administrative im- portance during the Assyrian Trading Colony period through the Hittite Old Kingdom is underlined by the recovery of many seals and seal impressions in im- posing architectural contexts. Remains dating to the Hittite empire (stratum Ilia) are thin in contrast, sug- gesting that the network linking the Hittite capital to its provinces shifted away from southern Cappadocia, perhaps instead moving east before rejoining, south of Nigde, the route through the Taurus Mountains. The stratigraphic trenches in the mound's north sector have now exposed five huge cobble-lined silos for storing vast reserves of wheat. They were set around a building with massive stone walls preserved to heights of more than 3 m. Seals and other finds from the silos date this level to stratum Illb, the Hittite Old Kingdom. The floors of the stone building, reached in 2004, in- cluded a basement level with burnt contents in situ, immediately above the equally destroyed IIIc stratum contemporary with Kultepe-Karum Ib. A skeleton and weapons in a IIIc gate building nearby show that it ended in an event as violent as the one terminating the Old Hittite establishment. Other finds, such as a bronze stamp seal, stamp seal impressions on jar stop- pers, and two fragmentary cuneiform tablets, place Kaman IIIc and its activities within the commercial, administrative, and historical context of central Anato- lia's Middle Bronze Karum network. Excavations in the south sector, devoted to broad exposures of Raman's settlement history, descended from its Ottoman and Hellenistic phases to a residential district of the later Phrygian period by 2005. They will eventually reach the underlying Hittite levels.51 Kultepe. During the summer of 2005, Tahsin Ozgiic's final campaign, the Kultepe project advanced on sev- eral fronts: excavation, geophysical survey, plans to turn this once-thriving center for Assyrian and Anato- lian businessmen into an open-air museum, and the accelerated publication of their rich archives. Excavations in houses of the lower town produced the usual spectacular harvest of ceramic vessels, all of the Karum Ib and la period (Samsi-Adad I and later) . Geophysical surveys carried out to the south and north- east of the Karum exposures suggest that the lower town's walled perimeter measured 2 km; they also in- dicate the presence of a large building to the north- east. More surprising was the discovery in an empty area between two previously exposed Middle Bronze houses of a large thick-walled building of Hellenistic date. It includes three compartments of equal size, each containing a sunken storage jar. Beside it ran a street paved with stones brought in from outside the immediate district. Of the many sites excavated by Ozguc in a long career marked by exceptionally rewarding fieldwork, Kultepe remains his most spectacular undertaking. He delighted in describing its sophisticated character, the prosperity of its residents, and the international network that linked the seemingly remote highlands of central Anatolia to the rest of the Near East in the 19th to 17th centuries B.C.E. Kiiltepe's residents in- deed mirrored their excavator's own scintillating and cosmopolitan personality. Their harmonious partner- ship made an incomparable contribution to Anato- lian archaeology. Bogazkoy. Jiirgen Seeher's final two campaigns (2004-2005) at the Hittite capital, Hattusha, pushed through conclusively the revolution in Hittite archae- ology that has marked the past decade: a readjust- ment of the Hittite ceramic sequence back into the Old Kingdom, and the associated attribution of the urban layout of the site to as early as the 16th century B.C.E.52 Seeher reports: In 2000, a project was launched in untouched areas in the Upper City's western sector to clarify when the Upper City was founded and if indeed a special purpose was connected with it. According to an idea formulated by excavators K. Bittel and P. Neve, this occurred no earlier than the 13th century B.C.E., with Hattusili III or, more likely, Tudhaliya IV responsible for its entire program: all known temples, numerous other build- ings, the city wall, and the complete renewal of the royal citadel on Buyiikkale. It is now clear that the Upper City was in use much earlier. As yet, only findings from the new excavations can be securely dated. The oldest structure discovered was a grain silo lo- cated on a small spur east of the central temple area and dated by radiocarbon and pottery to the late 16th-early 15th century B.C.E. After the silo's demise 50Gurney 1995; Summers etal. 1995. 51 Annual reports on excavations, the yearly regional survey (begun in the early 1990s), and specialized studies, including archaeobotanical and archaeozoological analyses, appear in the site's publication series Kaman-Kalehoyuk.

GATES [AJA 111 in the 15th century, the "southern ponds" (Siidteiche) , five large water reservoirs, were constructed on the plateau. They were in use for a short time only, indi- cated by the many sherds in the fill of Pool 1 dating to ca. 1400 B.C.E. By at least the early 15th century B.C.E. , settlement commenced in the valley below Sankale in the west- ern Upper City, under excavation since 2001 (fig. 8). This date is indicated by pottery and radiocarbon- dating from the "square building" (Quadratgebdude) and a second similar one. Their set plan, rigid inte- rior layout, and associated finds such as weapons and handmade pottery (besides wheelmade Hittite wares) suggest the structures were soldiers' barracks. This ho- rizon was followed by several settlement phases, lasting probably until the first half of the 13th century B.C.E. Workshops feature prominently in the levels immedi- ately following the square building horizon: tuyeres, molds, crucibles, and bronze scrap attest to metal pro- cessing; blanks for stone seals, pumice grinders, and drilling cores to stone-cutters' ateliers; and scrap glass to glass manufacture. Later levels of the 14th century reflect a rise in urban residential standards. A promi- nent house contained a large bathroom with open fireplace, partial tile floor, and a clay bathtub with a small sitting-bench. The existence of the silo, water reservoirs, and populated districts makes it question- able that the Upper City stayed without defenses over these many centuries. This area's strategic advantages also invite the presence of a defense wall already in the late 16th or early 15th centuries, in the same place as the excavated (later) version. In 2005, a bold reconstruction project was success- fully completed in the Lower City, where a 65 m stretch of the inner city wall (Abschnittsmauer) between the Great Temple and an adjoining district was replicated at full scale (fig. 9). Three stretches of curtain walls and two towers up to 12 m high now give an impres- sion of how well fortified the ancient city was and the imposing effect it must have had upon visitors of that time. This reconstruction also accentuates the fact that Hittite architecture was, in essence, brickwork. It took almost 11 months, spanning three cam- paigns from 2003 to 2005, to make the mudbricks and construct this stretch of wall; 64,000 bricks of Hittite size (45 x 45 x 10 cm, wt. 34 kg each) were produced and used. This project aimed both to create a visual reference for the original city and to contribute data through experimental archaeology. All work proce- dures, labor force, and time spent for individual tasks were recorded precisely. The replica will now be moni- tored to determine how a massive structure of unfired brick survived the harsh climate of central Anatolia. We will note how exposure to sun, rain, snow, and frost af- fects plastering, the roof, and the building as a whole as well as its needs for upkeep and repair. We intend, through direct observation, to assess the architectural and maintenance challenges met by Hittite builders 3,500 years ago.53 Shapinuwa-Ortakoy. Work led by Aygiil Suel at Hittite Shapinuwa, northeast of Alaca Hoyiik, took place in 2004-2005 in the site's second temple district on the east, around administrative Building A and on high terraces at its north end. The east sector's terraced ceremonial complex was entered through a pillared hall and open court (Building C) leading to a temple (Building D) with relief orthostats at its entrance. A stretch of its casemate enclosure (a square tower and rooms containing sunken jars and other vessels) was exposed on the complex's south side. A long, narrow magazine was located just inside this wall. West of the complex was a district of houses and a large outdoor oven (4 m diam.) most likely for industrial use, as sug- gested by several molds: one to make two figurines of a weather god with thunderbolt and eagle, and another for a royal seal. Broad excavations around Building A revealed that it was enclosed by a paved road. Beyond it were also shops or industrial installations: hearths, grinding stones, and deep storage pits filled with car- bonized seeds. On the hill to the north, at the highest point over- looking the site, geophysical survey and surface scrap- ing traced five stepped platforms and a broad, paved area enclosed by a deep ditch containing burnt occu- pational debris, including two fragmentary terracotta lion heads. A stone-lined drain or water channel was also connected to the platforms, which perhaps func- tioned as open-air ceremonial space.54 Alaca Hoyiik. A decade of new campaigns is redefin- ing this well-known site south of (Jorum, now seen to conform to urban features that have emerged in re- cent years at the other major Hittite cities (Bogazkoy, Ku§akh, Ortakoy) . Aykut Qinaroglu, Ankara Univer- sity, reports: Since 1998, excavations along the mound's east edge, behind the level II temple-palace complex of the Empire period, have uncovered a contemporary district of large, circular, stone-paved silos like those found at 53 For a report of the 2005 season, see Seeher 2006b.

Bogazkoy, excavated area in the valley west of Sankale in the western Upper City of Hattusha (J. Seeher). Bogazkoy on Biiyukkaya. Overlying the granaries was a much-damaged Phrygian megaron. Preceding them in an adjacent area (uncovered in 2004-2005) are the two phases of a metalsmith's workshop, furnished with crucibles, weights in a variety of materials, masses of iron objects, and ajar handle stamped with a Hiero- glyphic Luwian seal. Terracotta pipes supplied the workshop with water. A sounding below the workshop came down on Early Bronze walls and a doorway with its pivot stone, all distinguished from the Hittite phases by a different masonry technique and orientation. The mound can now officially be recognized as the citadel for a lower town, whose enclosure wall was exposed in 2005 on its southwest perimeter. A water source for the Hittite city was identified during the Alaca campaigns of the 1930s at nearby Golpmar (1 km to the southeast), where the outline of a dam and pool was visible from the surface. Work here in 2002-2004 exposed the dam, made of clay coated with lime and revetted with small stones, over its 130 m length and 15 m width. Shallow steps and a channel at the top run its entire length to control wa- ter flow. Behind the dam, and created by it, is a square pool (130 m/side), with water exiting at one corner into the dam's upper channel. A stele base was also found set into the top of the dam, together with stela fragments in Hieroglyphic Luwian naming a Tudhaliya (IV most likely) . Other finds from the pool, which was partially cleared, include a gold disk with a dark red, translucent bezel.55 Kastamonu, Kinik. Salvage excavations directed since 1994 by Aykut Qmaroglu near Kmik in the province of Kastamonu were precipitated by the discovery of Hittite metal objects in a road cut in 1990. Recent seasons have concentrated, however, on a settlement site (Delibeyoglu Sirti Oren Yeri) uphill from the Hit- tite deposit. Qmaroglu and Elif Gene, Ankara Univer- sity, report: Three distinct settlement levels have been identi- fied on the ridge, which is much damaged by erosion and plowing: I (Late Chalcolithic to EB I), II (II.l = EB III; II.2 = EB III-MB I transition), and III (Iron Age / Phrygian ). Two crucibles identify active metal workshops in level II.l. Excavation since 1996 of level IFs later phase continues to uncover a massive wall, still incomplete at 63 m in length. Substantial stone foundations, 2.5 m wide, were made of regular and irregular limestone blocks packed with rubble to sup- 55 For a report of the 2004 season with references to previous publications, see Qnaroglu and Qelik 2006a.

Numer- ous conical clay weights and spindle whorls show a long-lasting textile industry at the site.56 Resuloglu. Excavations since 2003 of the EB III ceme- tery at Resuloglu, southeast of Qankm and 28 km from Sungurlu, by Tayfun Yildirim with the Chorum Muse- um, have uncovered more than 100 pithoi, including 30 in 2005. The cemetery was cut into an abandoned district of EB II housing. The pithoi, for single flexed interments, were buried quite deep, then sealed with inverted vessels, stones, or stone slabs. Gifts included black-burnished, ribbed tankards typical of central Anatolian Alaca and Ma§at, and beads in many ma- terials and colors, including a yellow arsenical stone. Fine bronzes are also present: toggle and plain pins paralleled at Ikiztepe, Oymaagac, and Alaca; torques twisted like Alaca examples; bracelets and anklets; ear studs covered in gold leaf; weapons bent and "ritually killed"; and flanged daggers, one of them wrapped in coarse-weave linen. Metal analyses indicate some with high tin levels and others with arsenic, the latter from Samsun or Malatya mines.57 Fatmaoren and Boyah Hoyuk. These two Hittite sites together with Yoruklu/Huseyindede are three closely linked localities that Tune Sipahi has been investigat- ing within a 7 km circuit north of Sungurlu. Soundings in 2003 on the hilltop called Fatmaoren identified Old Kingdom deposits associated with a single large-scale structure, a likely extra-urban sanctuary like Hiisey- indede. Work in 2004 turned to the Hittite center for which Fatmaoren and Yoruklii were satellite hilltop sanctuaries - a large mound in a river valley framed by hills, within view of the other two sites. Soundings, followed by larger exposures in 2005, have located monumental architecture associated with Old Hittite 56 For a report of the 2004 season, see Qmaroglu and (]elik 2006b; see also Gene 2004. 57 For a report of the 2004 season, see Yildirim and Ediz 2006; see also Yildirim 2006a, 2006b.</page><page sequence="25">2007] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY, 2004-2005 299 pottery: a bull rhyton, relief vessels, and ajar impressed with the "signe royal." Below this level are Early Bronze Age deposits.58 Ku§akh. Excavations directed by Andreas Muller- Karpe at this eastern Cappadocian Hittite city, ancient Sarissa, 60 km south of Sivas, continued to coordinate remote sensing with the broad exposures necessary for this large urban center on the northeast periphery of Hittite territory. Work in 2004, the 12th campaign, took place in three sectors: north of the acropolis, the northwest city gate, and the "Caravansaray" in the northeast city. In the low-lying area north of Acropolis Building E was excavated a "sub-Hittite" residential area char- acterized by small, irregular houses reusing Hittite building stones. Pottery also derived from the Hittite tradition. A sounding beneath the floor of one house found it was built over a typical Hittite period silo, 3.5 m deep with a paved stone floor. It contained ce- reals and a storage jar stamped with the city's name, Sarissa. The northwest city gate, one of four located at the four corners of the city, contained furnishings in situ, an oven filled with carbonized barley in a room of its south tower, and a fragmentary Mycenaean LH IIIA2 pyxis. Charred beams from the stone and wood ma- sonry of the tower provide an Old Kingdom construc- tion dendrodate of 1530 B.C.E. Outside the gate lies Anatolia's oldest known dam, an artificial pool set on the same axis as the gateway. The 60 m long pool was contained by clay ramparts, 15 m high and lined with stones on both faces. Geophysical survey outlined a monumental build- ing, initially called the Caravansaray, near a pool in the sector between the temple on the north terrace and the northeast city gate. Excavations in 2003-2004 now show it was a stable built in the Old Kingdom. It consisted of a very large central hall with four square stone socles in two rows and cobbled corridors on three sides; it was later expanded by a smaller annex of the same design. It could have stabled 10 horses, and war chariots in the corridors. The nearby pool functioned as the watering place for the horses. The entire establishment was connected with the temple on the north terrace and had direct access from outside through the northeast gate. Earthquake destruction was evident from structural damage. It also felled a horse, whose skeleton was found lying beside a large jar containing a bronze knife. This area was later re- occupied by small houses of the sub-Hittite phase.59 Porsuk. A vigorous new project directed by Domi- nique Beyer, has, after a decade-long hiatus, reac- tivated excavations at Porsuk (Zeyve Hoyiik) near Uluki§la. This large mound guarded the entrance to the mountainous passage through the Cilician Gates, linking Anatolia's central plateau with the Adana plain. Beyer associates its proximity to the Taurus with Old Assyrian and Hittite D/Tuna, a distribution center for silver from local mines. The site was also occupied during the Iron Age, Hellenistic, and Late Roman periods, concluding with a Late Roman and Early Byzantine cemetery. Work in 2003-2005 continued the program and two trench areas of the earlier excavations: area IV on the mound's east end for a stratigraphic sequence, and area II at the east end on the Hittite gate complex. Area IV' s top exposure of Late Roman village housing and cemetery (130 graves excavated over the years) was cleaned and restudied. The cemetery can now be dated conclusively to the third through seventh centu- ries C.E., the earliest graves being contemporary with the final Roman settlement. Early Byzantine graves would have served another community (mainly Chris- tian) living elsewhere. Underlying Hellenistic housing extends over three separate levels. A second area IV trench, down the steep southeast slope of the mound, gives access to Late Bronze/Hittite levels built on bedrock. A large building with magazines contained storage jars sunken under floors, roofing beams in its burnt collapse, a silver ingot, and a seal impression. This formal structure of the Empire period (Porsuk phase V) cut into architectural remains from the Old Kingdom (Porsuk VI) . An Iron Age deposit overlying the Late Bronze one represents a distinct stratum here, rather than a squatter's occupation set into destroyed Hittite buildings, as in the gate area on the west side. The date of this later deposit within the Iron Age is yet to be established. Area II's Hittite gate complex, exposed by the previ- ous project, was cleaned and consolidated. Graveled terraces leading up from the road to the gate have been installed for viewing purposes, and the entrance into the gate complex has been screened off for pro- tection; a roof will ensure its preservation. Soundings inside the gate show that its mudbrick and timber walls, set on rubble foundations, were sunk very deep (6 m) into bedrock cuts; the same insertion technique was used for a postern running under the entranceway. A trench inside the gate (2005) uncovered collapsed wall- ing made of pise, cobbles, and wood, as well as ceiling 58 For the 2004 report of the season at Fatmaoren, see Si- pahi 2006. 59 For annual reports of the 2002 and 2003 seasons, see Muller-Karpe 2004.</page><page sequence="26">300 B.

Surveys in Yozgat province since 1997 have analyzed settlement patterns from the pre- historic to Byzantine periods, identifying regional centers and the communities dependent on them. Buyiiknefes (Roman Tavium), 30 km west of Yozgat and 20 km from the Hittite capital, was the focus for 2004. Karl Strobel, Klagenfurt University, and Chris- toph Gerber, Heidelberg University, report: The site of Buyiiknefes, founded in the fourth mil- lennium B.C.E., enjoyed its first floruit during the Hittite period as Tawinija and its second as Roman Tavium, capital of Roman Galatia. Visible architec- tural remains here and in the vicinity date from the Roman Imperial to Middle Byzantine periods but are especially frequent for the second to third and fifth to sixth centuries C.E. Burials range from Hellenistic to Early Byzantine times, with numerous tumuli sporting phallic stone markers and in one case, west of the city, a colossal marble lion. Other funerary finds include banquet reliefs, sarcophagi, grave stelae, and rock-cut tombs. Press-stones confirm the textual evidence for wine production in the area in the Byzantine period. The surrounding region follows a similar trajectory. At nearby Sogiitcuk Pmari, early Chalcolithic pottery typical of the south-central Anatolian plain but not previously noted this far north, was found. In 2005, geomagnetic survey at Yassihdyuk, occu- pied from the Late Chalcolithic to Late Bronze Age, identified a large building at the top of the mound. Intensive field walking determined that the citadel and its lower city covered an area of approximately 150 ha by its last, Late Bronze, phase. The finding of a Hittite tablet on the surface makes it likely that the site was a satellite of Hattusha.61 Oymaagac,Vezirkopru. In 2005, a survey project was started by Rainer Czichon and Jorg Klinger, Freie Universitat, Berlin, to assess whether this middle Pon- tic site east of the Kizihrmak and 7 km northwest of Vezirkdprii can be identified with the Hittite cult city of Nerik, lost to the Kashka in the 15th and 14th cen- turies B.C.E. Czichon and Klinger report: A first examination of the mound and its archi- tectural features, pottery, and finds indicates fairly continuous settlement from the Early Bronze to the Iron Age. A 0.5 m thick destruction layer, observable in the mound's south and west sections, may result from struggle with the Kashka but awaits exact dat- ing. Oymaagac is so far the only northern site with undeniable traces of the Hittite empire: three tablet fragments and a bulla with the seal of Sarini, a scribe known from Hattusha and Tarsus. Another resem- blance to the Hittite capital may be a posternlike tun- nel noted here by U. Bahadir Alkim in the 1970s but today refilled and inaccessible. Southeastern and Southern Turkey Turbe Hoyuk. Rescue excavations began in 2002 at this site in the Ihsu Dam watershed 27 km from Siirt at the confluence of the Botan and the Tigris. Haluk Saglamtimur, Ege University, reports: Two stone cist graves with whole pots and multiple burials indicate a Pre-Halaf phase in the second half of the sixth millennium B.C.E. Above this level was an Ubaid phase (fourth millennium B.C.E.), associated with thousands of worked and rough obsidian pieces distributed beyond the area of the mound proper. This broad settlement suggests the site may have been a ma- jor outpost for obsidian trade between sources in the Lake Van region and sites in Mesopotamia. However, architectural features for these early phases were not found, presumably destroyed by a second-millennium fortress built on the mound after a period of abandon- ment in the third millennium B.C.E. The 70 x 30 m fortress (fig. 10) , with walls up to 3 m thick, controlled this strategic point in the valley and may have been part of the Mitanni empire. The fortress' most significant find, a fragmentary clay tablet in Akkadian cuneiform dated to the 15th or 14th century B.C.E., records a waybill of goods to be sent to other cities. Kavusan Hoyuk. Salvage excavations at this 1 75 x 75 m site in the Ihsu Dam watershed on the south bank of the Tigris and 10 km east of Bismil began in 2001 under the direction of Giilriz Kozbe and Kemalettin Koroglu. Despite poor preservation, three major pe- riods have been identified. A Medieval phase is rep- resented by domestic contexts over the entire site. The Iron Age spans three phases: (1) a long-lasting "post-Assyrian level" consisting of a mudbrick case- mate structure belonging to a seasonal Achaemenid palatial camp, (2) a Neo-Assyrian level with numerous loomweights, and (3) an Early Iron Age level marked by crude pottery similar to examples at Gre Dimse and nine cremation burials in jars of people suffering from the genetic anemia illness still endemic in the area. These are preceded by a Middle Assyrian/Mitannian level and Middle Bronze deposits containing the Red Brown Wash Ware typical of the region. 60 For the report of the 2004 season, see Beyer et al. 2005; Beyer 2006.

Second-millennium B.C.E. fortress built on the mound at Tiirbe Hoyiik (H. Saglamtimur) . Hirbemerdon Tepe. Survey and salvage excavations since 2003 at Hirbemerdon Tepe, on the right bank of the Tigris 40 km east of Bismil in the Ilisu Dam area, have been carried out by Nicola Laneri for the Diyarbakir Museum. This 10.5 ha site combines a high mound separated by a natural rock formation from an outer town and a lower town. Laneri reports: The first two years of surveys suggested Hirbemer- don 's particular significance for the Middle Bronze Age, although the site was occupied from the Late Neolithic through the Iron Age and again in Medi- eval times. In 2005, a first season of excavations on the High Mound (area A) revealed sections of a building complex belonging to the late third to mid second millennium B.C.E. The prominent location reflects its important function. The building is characterized by well-preserved stone walls and furnishings left in situ when the site was abandoned during the 16th century B.C.E. The complex was built on terraces compensat- ing the natural slope here. A stone staircase and an external corridor connected its separate but adjoining architectural units. Its Middle Bronze archaeological assemblage consistently features the characteristic lo- cal Red Brown Wash Ware, associated with materials from contemporary periods in northern Mesopota- mia and Syria such as Stone Ware, Painted Ware, and Canaanean blades. More specifically, several ceramic decorated andirons and vessels and metal artifacts find parallels in central and northern Anatolia and in northern Syria at Tell Mozan/Urkesh and Tell Brak/Nagar.62 Ziyaret Tepe. Eight seasons led by Timothy Matney, University of Akron, at this 32 ha site on the south bank of the Tigris and 60 km east of Diyarbakir have been conducted on its multiperiod high mound and in the lower town, settled only in the mid-late Assyr- ian periods. Matney reports: A step trench (operation E) on the high mound found occupation from the Islamic period to the Early Bronze third millennium B.C.E. Work in 2004 focused on third-millennium levels below the Middle Bronze "Brightly Burnt Building." These levels produced hemispherical Dark-Rimmed Orange bowls common to this region and to some sites in northeast Syria, grain storage pits with Early Bronze ceramics, and the foun- dations of a mudbrick wall more than 5 m wide, prob- 62 Laneri 2006a, 2006b.</page><page sequence="28">302 B. YILDIRIM AND M.-H. GATES [AJA 111 ably the encircling wall for the Early Bronze citadel. Base levels showed that the site was founded no earlier than the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. In the lower town (operation G), several official Late Assyrian buildings include typical large courtyards decorated with black and white pebbles in checker- board and irregular geometric patterns (rectangles and triangles) . A pair of rooms in Building 2 contained pithoi capable of storing 10,000 liters, and 27 unbaked cuneiform tablets and fragments with ephemeral ad- ministrative accounts on receipt, storage, and issue of grain. The tablets were burnt soon after they were writ- ten at the end of the seventh century B.C.E. (two bear year eponyms for 613 and 611 B.C.E.) . Simo Parpola, who is studying the tablets, suggests that the building complex may be part of a temple to Ishtar of Nineveh. Excavation of the lower town's fortification wall (op- eration K) , first located by magnetic gradiant survey, revealed a 4 m high terrace fill with an exterior ditch to control flooding. Associated pottery dates the wall's construction to the Early Iron Age or soon thereafter. Stone roads of the lower town were uncovered during investigation of long parallel magnetic anomalies iden- tified in a 1999 survey, indicating the area had evenly laid streets running parallel to the high mound and its fortifications to the north.63 Kazane Hoyiik. See above, under "Epipaleolithic, Neolithic, and Chalcolithic: Southern and Southeast- ern Turkey." Malatya, Arslantepe. The 2004 season at Arslantepe, 4 km northeast of Malatya, expanded its focus away from the upper mound's VI A monumental complex, which dominated research efforts and interest for the past decade, just as it did the site and region during the later fourth millennium B.C.E., to begin placing this complex within the framework of its broader site plan. Excavations in the north part of the site were di- rected toward connecting the monumental complex with other buildings previously excavated there and dated to the same period. Establishing their precise topographical relationship will provide a picture of the fourth-millennium settlement's layout, starting from its administrative center and extending as far as the housing districts located outside the city wall. Chronological parameters in current use for south- eastern Anatolia attribute this phase, marked by long- distance contacts with Protoliterate Mesopotamia, to the Late Chalcolithic period. A second research question receiving increased attention is Arslantepe 's transformation from the VI A period, with its highly structured authority embodied in the upper mound's monumental complex, to the "stormy times" following its destruction and the collapse of centralized power. Excavations outside the city wall and in the north- ern trenches worked on the complicated Early Bronze stratigraphic sequence for period VI Bl, whose Trans- caucasian assemblage shows the arrival of a new popu- lation, and for VI B2, when Arslantepe gradually grew from a fortified village to a larger EB II settlement. An impressive 4 m wide fortification wall, built of mud- brick with buttresses every 3-4 m, is dated to the first phase of VI B2. Walls set against the buttresses eventu- ally partitioned this area into rooms as the settlement expanded - either while the defenses still remained in use or after they were abandoned. In a second phase, the exposed stretch of VI B2 fortifications was replaced by a large building, preserved only as good floors with postholes. Finds from burnt surface deposits and the building's architectural plan belong to the "Gelincik culture," already known from a similar building exca- vated in earlier seasons at Arslantepe. The overall se- quence can at present be summarized as follows: (1) destruction of VI A, (2) arrival of the Kura Araxes-type settlers of VI Bl, (3) the Royal Tomb, (4) the fortified village of VI B2 phase 1, and (5) an expanded version of the fortified village as VI B2 phase 2. A survey of the settlement patterns between the mountains and plains surrounding Malatya that began in 2003 under the direction of Gian Maria Di Nocera, found more than 100 settlements from the Neolithic, Early Bronze, Iron, Roman, and Medieval periods. In- tensive survey around Arslantepe in 2005 confirmed a settlement at the base of the mound. Typological analysis of the settlement locations (mound vs. natu- ral setting) shows that the number of settlements in- creased in the first half of the third millennium B.C.E., mainly located on natural hills. Their occupation spans a limited period, suggesting that population did not necessarily increase but instead spread out from nucle- ated settlements to "villages." This shift reversed in the second half of the third millennium, when settlement returned to urban centers on mounds that continued to be occupied into the Middle Bronze Age.64 Zeytinli Bahge Hoyilk. This site, the largest mound in the Carchemish Dam's flood zone, lies east of Gazian- tep on the east bank of the Euphrates 10 km north of Zeugma.

The site's striking configuration, a flat-topped mound capped by a high and steep conical formation, probably originated with its MB II citadel. Excavations in 2004 at the base of the mound's steep west slope, cut by river erosion, exposed four Late Chalcolithic (fourth millennium) phases. Houses of the earliest two were local types, with well-plastered walls and outdoor areas with cobbled pavements. These were followed by a transitional level with post- holes and hearths, and two levels with Middle Uruk cultural material. On top of the mound, trenches west of the MB citadel found an EB III-IV sequence of ir- regular house plans, pebbled courts, and numerous pits, one of which contained sealings from jars, doors, and sacks, all impressed with cylinder seals of Early Dynastic (Mesopotamian) type. Ceramic finds include Kurban IVb types and metallic ware. The following MB I settlement was unwalled. In contrast, the MB II site, represented by 3 m of deposit and two phases, was protected by a massive fortress. The excavated sec- tor of the earlier phase's 3 m wide brick fortification was found attached to a heavily burnt square tower, containing jars and other vessels contemporary with Lidar period 3. A brick building overlying the burnt tower belongs to the later MB II phase. After a thin Iron Age level, the site again saw sub- stantial, uninterrupted occupation from the Late Hellenistic to Late Roman Imperial periods, well docu- mented by coins. In the ninth or 10th century C.E., a small, round Byzantine fort with square towers was constructed on the citadel. The fort was partitioned into narrow, parallel rooms abutting the interior pe- rimeter of its wall. Its rooms first served for storage or barracks, then were modified during the final, medi- eval settlement for stables and housing. These were furnished with well-preserved pise hearths, their deco- rated fronts typical of the 12th to 14th centuries C.E., when contemporary medieval housing also covered the lower terraces of the mound.65 Tilbe§ar. The project led by Christine Kepinski since 1994 at this Neolithic-Medieval site, a 6 ha mound and 50 ha lower town located 20 km southeast of Ga- ziantep, resumed excavations in 2005 after five study seasons. This season focused on the Early Bronze and Middle Bronze periods in the lower town's north and south sectors (areas D and L) and on the north slope of the citadel mound (area M) . The urban history of this site is now, as a result, better understood: the first major urbanization occurred in the EB II period (2900-2500 B.C.E.) but declined and collapsed by the end of the third millennium B.C.E. On the mound, this was indicated by further exposure of a very large mudbrick platform, attributed to the later part of EB II (2700-2500 B.C.E.). On top of it was a mudbrick enclosure wall of the same period.66 Excavations in the lower town illustrated the in- terrupted settlement patterns characteristic of sites throughout this region. In areas D and L, EB II depos- its, followed by MB I- II deposits without intervening EB III, related mainly to outdoor activities, suggesting nomadic campsites. A burial of undetermined date in a sterile layer between the Medieval and Middle Bronze levels reflects the same type of society: a man wearing bronze anklets and a bronze bracelet was placed on his side in a large circular pit, with a horse on top of him. Gaziantep Kalesi. Stratigraphic cuts have been con- ducted since 2003 by Fikri Kulakoglu and Hamza Giil- luce, with the Gaziantep Museum, on the steep slopes of the mound crowned by the medieval citadel in the center of Gaziantep. At the base of the foundation wall of the citadel were two EB III levels: a room with six pithoi sunk into the floor, in turn cut into by two large stone-lined cist tombs that contained Syrian bottles and fine green (Plain Simple Ware) cups. A similar tomb cut into an EB III deposit in another sounding included a fruit stand, painted vessels, and small metal items. Halaf levels lie at the base of the mound. Tilmen Hoyiik. U. Bahadir Alkim's excavations at Tilmen Hoyiik (1959-1972) demonstrated that this second-millennium B.C.E. capital of the Islahiye Val- ley was conceived as a smaller version of Alalakh/Tell Atchana, and that its public buildings mirrored the plans and construction techniques of Tilmen's domi- nant neighbor to the south. Tilmen's scale, however, affords a more complete view of city layout than does Atchana; its enclosed lower town and separately forti- fied administrative citadel, as outlined and partially excavated by Alkim, illustrate an urban standard to supplement Atchana's inaccessible components. The close similarities between the two sites also invite cross- checks on, for example, regional ceramic sequences, since Atchana and Tilmen seem to have run a parallel historical course, at least initially. Archaeological research at these sites has followed a similar course, too. Interest in Tilmen was revived in 2002 when a member of Alkim's team, Refik Duru, Istanbul University, carried out a program to clean and consolidate the site and published a summary of that 65 For the report of the 2004 season, see Frangipane and Balossi 2006; see also Alvaro et al. 2004. 66 For reports of the 2004-2005 seasons, see Kepinski 2005; Kepinski etal. 2006.</page><page sequence="30">304 B.

Nicolo Mar- chetti, University of Bologna, reports: The main foci of the new Tilmen Hoyuk project are the study of the urban structure of this ancient capital; its relations with the environment, including regional settlement patterns; a detailed seriation of its Bronze Age material culture; and the implementation of an archaeological park at the site within the context of the Islahiye Valley. Excavations in the monumental public complex on the southern part of the acropolis have exposed new sectors of three previously known buildings: Building E (MB I-LB I), perhaps an early temple of central Anatolian type; Palace A (MB II-LB I), whose plan, orthostats, and blocked doorways match Atchana's VIFs Yarim-Lim palace to a remarkable degree; and Residency C (late MB II-LB I, rebuilt in LB II). Two buildings have also been newly discovered within this citadel: Fortress H, in the southeastern corner of the acropolis fortifications, dated by its pottery to LB I; and Building L, farther to the north, with three construc- tion phases spanning early MB I to mid LB. A burnt floor deposit for this building's first phase produced a rich ceramic assemblage with residual Early Bronze features. In the west lower town, a temenos and its monu- mental Temple M, a typical single-room in antis plan on foundations built of large basalt blocks, were un- covered in 2004. In the cella was found a basalt stele 0.5 m high depicting in Old Syrian style a king with rounded cap, shawl, and curved stick in his left hand; he faces a storm god in smiting position. Comparisons can be drawn to seals, the "Baal au foudre" stele from Ugarit, and a bronze plaque from Hazor. In 2005, the monumental polygonal stonework of the temple and an associated paved outer surface were exposed, whereas the eastern part of the temenos was found to be much eroded. Pottery and small finds, all ex- clusively MB II, supply a firm date to the temple and to the stele. In 2005, the urban structure of this Middle Bronze Age town and its occupational sequence were explored further in the southern part of the acropolis (areas G, N, K-5). A new area was opened around the top- most part of the monumental stairway K-5 (excavated by Alkim), which connected the eastern lower town to the top of the acropolis. From a room west of the upper entrance came a rich pottery assemblage dat- ing to late MB II. A late MB II monumental building with orthostat doorjambs and monolithic doorsills was identified to the south along a paved street (fig. 1 1 ) . A paved courtyard and three rooms are known thus far: one with a floor of crushed limestone and a stone stairway; the second with grinding tables; and the third with ceramic vats. The building seems to be an official residency linked to control of the gate area and extends to the south toward Palace A. The whole area is sealed by a thick destruction layer. The 2005 season also started investigating the west- ern casemate walls in area K-3 and their relationship with the lower town. Where Alkim had uncovered a small postern in the western casemates, this year's further exposure revealed an upward-sloping floor of beaten earth, crossed by a drain, and an adjoining building. The excavations made clear that K-3 was added after the building of the main casemates. The pottery collected dates from MB II, and no destruction was observed in this area (nor in area M) . Other 2005 projects include a geophysical survey (georadar and geomagnetic) covering one-fifth of the site. A complete topographic, three-dimensional model of the site and its georeferencing were obtained through DGPS, while a botanical study of the site and its environs was carried out for the interdisciplinary project of the Tilmen archaeological park. To that end, excavated monuments have been surveyed and restored, pathways and informative panels set up for tourists, and the governor of Gaziantep is building a new road to the site.68 TellAtchana. A new project at Tell Atchana (ancient Alalakh) , the Amuq's second-millennium B.C.E. capi- tal city excavated by C.L. Woolley in the late 1930s and late 1940s, began in 2003 under the auspices of the Oriental Institute/University of Chicago and the directorship of K. Aslihan Yener. The 2003-2004 seasons investigated unresolved aspects of the site's Hittite empire phase, such as an unexcavated corner of the level III citadel and a section of casemate wall perhaps contemporary with it. New trenches were also opened in a previously unchartered area southeast of the monumental district excavated by Woolley. Im- mediately below the modern surface was uncovered a workshop district identified by its several kilns. Glass and/ or faience wasters were found in the debris of one well-preserved square example with its firing platform still in place; pottery was also manufactured here. This level was preceded by LB I housing, con- temporary with level IV (15th-14th centuries B.C.E.) . 67Duru2003. 68 For the 2005 season, see Marchetti 2006b; see also Mar- chetti 2006a.</page><page sequence="31">2007] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY, 2004-2005 305 Fig. 11. Late Middle Bronze II residency at Tilmen Hoyiik in area K-5, view from northeast (N. Marchetti). Both the housing level and the industrial district that succeeded it would date well before the 2003 season's most spectacular find, a LB II grave in which four in- dividuals were buried with ceremony, gold jewelry, and Cypriot Base Ring II pitchers. This tomb and a second one of similar date were cut into the mound slope - presumably late in the site's settlement history. After a temporary interruption in 2005, excavations resumed in 2006.69 Tell Ta 'yinat. A third Amuq site to receive renewed attention is Tell Ta'yinat, Neo-Hittite Kunulua, which in the Iron Age replaced nearby Alalakh, by then abandoned, as regional capital. It was also a major Early Bronze Age center, vacated in favor of Alalakh throughout the second millennium B.C.E. The two sites thus complemented each other historically, as do now these concurrent revivals of archaeological projects conducted in the 1930s. Timothy Harrison, University of Toronto, reports: Ta'yinat's great size (500 x 700 m), complex settle- ment history, and previous large-scale excavations by the Chicago Syro-Hittite Expedition (largely unpub- lished) presented challenges best approached by as- sessing the site first through coordinated geophysical, topographic, and surface surveys. In 2002, an extensive remote sensing survey with a proton magnetometer began on the lower mound and expanded to the up- per mound the next year. The magnetometer survey proved highly successful in recording anomalies for rectilinear structures or features on the lower mound. On the upper mound, similar anomalies made it pos- sible to situate the Chicago Expedition's findings - today unrecognizable from the surface - within the site's present topography and the new project's sur- vey data. The 2004 excavations began with a 3 x 20 m ex- ploratory trench along the southern edge of the Chicago Expedition's West Central area to test these geomagnetic and topographic survey results. They soon recovered part of an Iron Age temple (Building II) excavated 70 years ago, which in turn sealed a re- markably well-preserved sequence of Early Bronze and Early Iron Age remains. This trench was expanded in 2005 to 400 m2 as field I, where six architectural phases (Field Phases [FP]) have been distinguished below the plow zone (FP 1). The earliest, FP 7, is dated to 69 For the comprehensive survey that preceded this project, see Yener 2005. For a report of the 2004 season, see Yener 2006.</page><page sequence="32">306 B. YILDIRIM AND M.-H. GATES [AJA 111 EB IVB (Amuq J) by associated deposits with Simple and Painted Simple Wares. It was superimposed by four early Iron I (Amuq N) phases (FP 6-3) . The fea- tures and deposits of FP 6-4 produced much painted pottery, including possible Aegean imports, but pre- dominantly a locally produced monochrome version of Mycenaean IIIC1, together with central Anatolian painted wares. Field Phase 3, represented by substan- tial pitting but no walls or other freestanding struc- tures, may date primarily to late Iron I (or Iron IC). Sealing these were the large mudbrick foundations for Building IFs north and south walls, identified in the 1930s as a megaron-style temple of the late ninth century B.C.E. (Iron IIB, Amuq Oc). Most of this im- pressive structure, whose two porch columns were sup- ported by basalt bases representing pairs of lions, has been destroyed by plowing in the intervening years. Nonetheless, remaining sections of the cella's cobbled surface, the north pier of the cella doorway, and two stone steps from the entrance to the temple were again exposed. Pottery from its disturbed contexts dated predominantly to Iron II and included large quanti- ties of the Red Slip Burnished Wares assigned by the Chicago Expedition to Amuq Ob and Oc. North of field I, field II was opened in 2005 to de- termine what remained of the Iron II bit hilani palace (Building I) and of Building XIV below it, an earlier structure only partially excavated by the Chicago team. Immediately below the modern plow zone were found two massive mudbrick walls (&gt;3 m wide) running east- west and parallel across the 10 m length of the trench; two others intersect them to form two rooms. A probe into one reached its floor at a depth of more than 3 m. This monumental structure may, at this prelimi- nary stage, be recognized as Building XIV and dated to late Iron I/early Iron II (lOth-early ninth centuries B.C.E.) for the complex. Size and preservation mark it as an important structure, possibly related to the Neo-Hittite polity of Padasatini/Wadasatini recently proposed by D. Hawkins. Field III, also on the upper mound and southwest of field I, was opened in 2005 to gauge the Early Bronze levels' depth and accessibility here, since Braidwood's nearby trench T4 had p:roduced intact remains of this date 1.7 m below the surface. Walls, a plaster in- stallation, and an intact pithos at 2 m depth dates to EB IVB (Amuq J), the terminal Early Bronze phase in the region. A coring program is also testing, since 2004, the extent and sedimentary profile of Ta'yinat's lower mound, now hidden under alluviation from the Oron- tes, and the impact of this river's changing course in ancient and modern times. Thirty-five cores, 2-8 m deep, have been drilled across the lower mound and around the base of the upper mound. The east sector shows extensive Early Bronze and Iron Age cultural deposits, some almost 8 m below the plain's current surface. In contrast, cores at the west base of the up- per mound produced only sand and shells from a relic water channel or lakebed. Like the fortress of 'Unqi depicted on the Balawat Gates, Ta'yinat was enclosed by swamps. Another goal is to inventory and document the Chi- cago excavations' 460, mainly unpublished, artifacts in the Antakya Museum. Roughly half of them have been processed. They will be integrated into this project's publication schedule.70 Antioch-on-the-Orontes. After a long hiatus, systematic research resumed in the region of Antioch-on-the- Orontes as part of the Orontes Valley and Orontes Delta Archaeological Project, led since 2002 by Hatice Pamir, Mustafa Kemal University, Antakya, and since 2003 in collaboration with Gunnar Brands, Martin- Luther-University, Halle-Wittenberg. The survey is documenting Bronze Age to Byzantine settlement pat- terns in Antioch and its vicinity, where the Amuq Plain intersects with the estuary of Orontes and at Sabuniye and Seleucia Pieria on the estuary's east and south banks. Pamir reports: At Sabuniye, reinvestigation of Woolley's 1930s trenches indicates that occupation began there in the Late Bronze period rather than Middle Bronze, as Woolley had proposed. Finds include a 14th-century Mitanni seal, Cypriot White Slip, and Late Mycenaean pottery, indicating the settlement was an important port in the LB II eastern Mediterranean. At the classical coastal seaport of Seleuceia Pieria, on the northern bank of the Orontes delta, the East Necropolis and other monuments were documented and mapped, and geophysical prospection surveyed the agora. Surveys between Harbiye (ancient Daphne) and Antakya (ancient Antioch) identified mainly Ro- man and Late Roman finds and documented water mills {noria) and rock-cut tombs. At Antioch-on-the-Orontes, Gunnar Brands aims to study the city's development from its Graeco-Macedo- nian phase as a polis and its Late Roman phase as a metropolis to its Medieval-Crusader phase. In 2004, the necropoleis on the foothills east and northeast of the ancient city were planned and documented, as were the 8 km circuit of fortification walls and related structures on Mounts Silpius and Staurin and features 70 For the report of the 2004 season, see Harrison et al. 2006.</page><page sequence="33">2007] ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY, 2004-2005 307 of the lower city such as the Orontes island (Basileia) . The polygonal city walls on the southeastern and northern slopes of the Staurin plateau are perhaps to be identified with Epiphaneia, the quarter added by Antiochos IV Epiphanes to his capital.71 Kinet Hoyiik. Excavations at this ancient port city, active from Neolithic to Hellenistic times and again in the Middle Ages, turned in the past three campaigns to investigating its Bronze Age components more ex- clusively. On the mound's lower west slope, facing the sea, a long EB III residential sequence was recovered. It consisted partly of modest houses, repeatedly modi- fied and rebuilt on either side of a cobbled alley, and of a larger structure, again rebuilt over many centu- ries along the same wall lines. A cache of bronze tools, weapons, and pins, a jar stopper impressed with a cylinder seal, and a room with sunken jars for large- capacity storage confer an elevated status to this com- munity, whose cultural affiliations combine Tarsian and west Syrian traits. Underlying this residential district is an EB II fortification wall with multiple versions. In 2005, a massive square tower was reached at the northeast corner of the MB II/III monumental burnt building on the mound's east terrace. This structure is now understood to be a fortress with a long, straight facade (50 m exposed) , defending the inland edge of Kinet's Middle Bronze citadel mound. Its foundations were cut into Early Bronze levels, and a clay rampart lined with a stone glacis reinforced the mound slope on which it stood. This fortress matches military and palatial architecture throughout the Levant in the last centuries of the Middle Bronze Age. Pottery and radiocarbon samples date it in the 18th to 16th cen- turies B.C.E. A longer Late Bronze sequence was also discovered in 2005 in an expanded exposure of the Late Bronze levels excavated higher up on the mound's west slope in the 1990s. Kinet was tightly connected with the cen- tral Anatolian Hittite state in LB I (Old Kingdom) and LB II (Empire). To the previously known three levels is now added a fourth, sub-Hittite, one characterized by a ceramic industry that debased Hittite standards. Cypriot and other imports place it at the close of LB, in the early 12th century B.C.E. This level was destroyed by earthquake and followed by an Early Iron presence with handmade pottery and no built architecture.72 Tarsus. In 2001, nearly half a century after the ex- cavations by H. Goldman and her team, research at Tarsus-Gozlukule was resumed by an interdisciplinary group from Bogazici University and other institutions in cooperation with Bryn Mawr College. Ash Ozyar, Bogazici University, reports: In 2004, fleldwork concentrated in area 05 on the south slope of the eastern summit, east of Goldman's section A, where the mound had been terraced to ac- commodate modern houses. Analysis of a 10 m stretch of the section cut into the mound revealed a succes- sion of floors and adjoining mudbrick walls with and without stone foundations in the lower half of the section, and at the upper part a conical pit and a wall foundation with two courses of stones. At the top lev- el, the section cuts through a room/building where burnt debris and tumbled mudbricks have piled up on the floor. Pottery from the lower half of the section, mainly bowls and small pitchers with incised handles, dates to EB II. Metallurgical activity is suggested by a crucible fragment with metal residue. Radiocarbon analysis of 10 charcoal samples from the section date it to 2750-2400 B.C.E. In 2005, area 07 on the eastern summit of the mound northeast of section A was cleaned and record- ed. Its densely burnt deposits may extend from the LB II monumental building excavated by Goldman. As- sociated pottery includes Hittite Monochrome Ware. Radiocarbon analysis from a single charcoal sample gave a calibrated date of 1455-1369 B.C.E.73 Soloi/Pompeiopolis. Excavations led by Remzi Yagci at this ancient port city 1 1 km west of Mersin began in 1999. The project has focused on Soloi Hoyiik, in particular its Late Bronze Age level, underlying Iron Age to Hellenistic occupations when the site became Soloi, and a later, more substantial settlement of the Late Hellenistic and Roman periods, when it was re- founded as Pompeiopolis. The mound is much dis- turbed by trees planted for a municipal park, and on top by a public building. However, trenches on top of the mound and stratigraphic soundings along its slopes give a Late Bronze sequence with a rich collec- tion of imported ceramics (Cypriot, Mycenaean LH IIIB, IIIC), an LB II local assemblage characteristic of the Hittite empire, and official status indicated by an early Hieroglyphic Luwian seal impression of Middle Kingdom type on a cup; it names the city lord 71 For the report of the 2004 season, see Pamir and Brands 2006. 72 Gates 2006.

A summary of the first three campaigns appears in Ozyar 2005.

Mountjoy.</page><page sequence="34">308 B. YILDIRIM AND M.-H. GATES [AJA 111 Targasna. Foundations of a fortification wall dated to the Hittite empire were also uncovered. These Hit- tite finds correspond with strata VII-V at Yumuktepe (Mersin) . Late Bronze Soloi is considered a good can- didate for the Hittite port town of Ura, known from textual references that link merchants from here with Ugarit. For the Iron Age, when this harbor was equally well-connected, large stone buildings and White Slip IV pottery can be paralleled with Neo-Assyrian Tarsus.74 Pompeiopolis. See "Soloi/Pompeiopolis" below, under "Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman: Cilicia." Bronze Age Perge. The 2004-2005 campaigns complet- ed a decade of research on Perge's acropolis, where in recent years the long-sought preclassical settlement was successfully located, with a continuous Bronze to Early Iron Age sequence. It may be identified with Parha, listed as a border town in the late 13th-century bronze treaty tablet from Hattusha. Roman Perge. See below, under "Classical, Hellenis- tic, and Roman: Pamphylia and Pisidia." Bronze Age Patara. A stone axe of ca. 2000 B.C.E., forti- fication walls, and Late Bronze pottery excavated on the Tepecik acropolis of Patara may represent the preclas- sical Patar known from Hittite texts during the reign of Tudhaliya IV and, like Parha, listed on his bronze treaty tablet. A pair of male and female figurines with parallels in 11th-century B.C.E. Crete was also found on the acropolis, in the fill of a Hellenistic cistern. Classical Patara. See below, under "Classical, Helle- nistic, and Roman: Lycia." IRON AGE Western Turkey Daskyleion. Excavations at Achaemenid Lydia's satra- pal capital at Ergili near Bandirma have concentrated in recent years on its cult center at Hisar Tepe, where a sanctuary was already active in the Phrygian period. Its replacement by installations for Zoroastrian wor- ship can now be set precisely within the site's archae- ological and historical context. Tomris Bakir and A. Erdogan, Ege University-Izmir, report: The 2004 season produced conclusive evidence dat- ing the Persian sanctuary to the fifth century B.C.E. and its abandonment to the Middle Achaemenid pe- riod, most likely in the satrap Pharnabazos IFs 18th year, when it was deliberately sealed under a deep layer of fill. On the surface of a thick, burnt deposit overly- ing the fill were found rooftiles and especially table- wares, both local and imported red-figure Athenian cups, dated 400-390 B.C.E. Two pits cut into the paved sacred road leading to the sanctuary provided similar chronological limits: a complete red-figure lekane cover by the Ottchet Workshop and two cooking pots (ca. 350 B.C.E.), an iron pitchfork, and a lead weight decorated with a fish and the letters "KYZ" (= Kyzikos) . These and other offerings show that, even after the sanctuary's demise, the sacredness of this location continued to be recognized into the Late Achaemenid period, as indeed during Hellenistic times. Excavations on the outskirts of the sanctuary (area HT-1 ) produced spolia from Early Achaemenid struc- tures that were eventually dismantled and reused in terrace walls. They included a marble block carved in relief to imitate a door panel, the most recently discov- ered of several "false doors" that could be orthostats from the Daskyleion palace or from an as yet unidenti- fied temple. Other reused materials consisted of thick andesite blocks and large quantities of marble, decora- tive architectural fragments. The uppermost deposit in this sector was filled with terracotta figurines of the "worshipping woman" and "Kourotrophoros" types, and offering plates (pinakes) . Although not in situ, they confirm the presence of a cult to Kybele at Hellenistic Daskyleion, as suggested in previous seasons. Evidence for a pre-Achaemenid monumental struc- ture was recovered this year in a trench on the south side of Hisar Tepe (area HT) , where it was later cut by terrace walling. A massive stone wall, 2.2 m wide and preserved 1.45 m high, was exposed for more than 8 m in a deposit with seventh- to early sixth-century B.C.E. pottery. It would thus date before the Achae- menid occupation. In order to document and date the tower build- ing excavated south of Hisar Tepe in the 1950s by E. Akurgal, the past two seasons have been opening the area to its west. From here was recovered this year a fragmentary marble block whose proportions show it to be an orthostat from the satrapal palace. On it was sculpted the profile of a male head in Anatolian- Persian style, a clear example of a local craftsman work- ing for a foreign patron. While the face was carved according to early fifth-century Ionian criteria, the addition of a cloth cap gave it a recognizable Per- sian look. The same process can be understood for a unique gray ware vessel in the shape of a Persian bowl, perhaps attesting to a potter's workshop at Daskyleion under the Late Achaemenid satrap Ariobazarnes.75 74 For the 2005 season reports, see Yagci 2006a, 2006c.

Altan Qilingiroglu continued his exca- vations in the last citadel constructed by the Urartian king Rusa II at this well-situated hilltop overlooking the east shore of Lake Van, 18 km north of the Urartian capital Tuspa. A 200 m2 exposure at the northeast end of the temple precinct (area 3) found, below medieval deposits (11th century C.E.), a drainage channel cut into the bedrock as part of the citadel's sophisticated water and sewage system. Beside this channel had ac- cumulated a large dump of broken pottery, which in- cluded previously unknown white-slipped vessels with black geometric designs and a higher percentage of red-burnished wares than elsewhere on the site. Over- lying this ceramic heap was an unburied, complete, ar- ticulated equid skeleton. The well-preserved mudbrick walling for a terrace or platform was found at the west end of the citadel (area 10) , again below medieval de- posits. Excavations in the temple precinct east of the excavated temple (area 9) uncovered a row of three stone column bases, set on bedrock, of the same type (square with projecting corners) as in the sanctuary, indicating the presence of a columned hall. Fortifica- tions on the south side of the citadel, which are less deeply buried in erosional soil, are also being cleared and restored for site enhancement. The usual harvest of fine Urartian metalwork from these excavations in- cluded an ornate iron quiver with bronze arrows still inside, a cache of more than 600 iron arrowheads, a helmet with thunderbolt motif, an arrowhead of Scyth- ian type (rare at Ayanis), and fragments of bronze vo- tive shields. Other notable finds were two jars packed with seeds and a cuneiform tablet with a dated receipt for a private transaction. Upper and Lower Anzaf, Van. The Urartian fortress founded by King Ispuini at the start of the Urartian dynasty (late ninth century B.C.E.) on the flat plain at Lower Anzaf and, 900 m to its south, the city founded by his son Menua on a high hill dominated by a temple at Upper Anzaf together became the economic center of Urartu, at the convergence of roads from Iran and the Caucasus, a few kilometers northeast of the capital Tuspa (Van Kalesi) . Investigations here by Oktay Belli have, like those at Ayanis, entered their second decade. They continued unabated in 2004, concentrating on the sanctuary of Haldi, crowning Upper Anzaf, and on magazines outside this temple precinct, which has the same layout as the one at Ayanis. The columned hall, with five magazines on its north side excavated in previous seasons, connects by a single doorway along its east side to a corridor now exposed for a length of 46 m, with doors opening onto an eastern wing of magazines (not yet excavated) . Fire preserved the mudbrick walls of the magazines to heights of at least 4 m. Ceramic finds from the corridor consist primarily of fine red-polished wares, especially juglets of a type known from Karmir Blur; they include an exceptional red-burnished bull rhyton. A two-part bronze doorpost holder inscribed with the name of King Sarduri III was also found in the corridor.76 Yoncatepe, Van. Belli has directed excavations since 1997 at this Iron Age citadel on a mountain peak (2,050 masl) commanding a spectacular view of Lake Van and the eastern approach to the Urartian capi- tal at Van Kalesi, 9 km to the northeast. The citadel has excellent springs and benefited from a nearby dam, one of several that supplied water to the Urar- tian centers. The immediate area also provided a fa- vorable setting for animal breeding and agricultural production, the livelihoods of an Early Iron Age and Urartian settlement located on the lower part of the mountain's northeast slope, whose nearby necropolis is being excavated. On the citadel, excavations continued to uncover a monumental building oriented east-west. It was con- structed with stone supporting walls and brick interior partitions, its three wings containing large halls and flagstone pavements. Neither its building technique nor layout is Urartian. The western wing included a square central room with a square basin made of stone slabs, perhaps a fireplace for burnt sacrifices, as sug- gested by quantities of animal bones. Cereals were also found in jars and on floors throughout the building. In 2004, excavations began on a second monumental complex to the east, separated from the west build- ing by a road oriented north-south. The single long hall so far exposed was stocked with storage jars filled with wheat and barley, and a large selection of table- wares. The doors of both buildings had been blocked after the jars were filled with dry goods (grains, len- tils, chickpeas) . Much military equipment was stored in them as well: arrowheads in metal and bone, a rare type of iron axe, and metal knobs from lightweight (reed or leather) shields. These circumstances suggest that the buildings saw seasonal use by a pre-Urartian nomadic tribe that stored its fall harvest and other 76 Belli 2003. For a report of the 2004 season, see Belli 2006b.

Both buildings were burnt in a catastrophic fire, resulting in their excep- tional preservation. The necropolis at the base of the mountain, which served an Early Iron Age community followed by an Urartian one, reflects the historical se- quence surrounding the citadel's construction, use, and eventual destruction.77 Altintepe. This site was established on a high and steep natural hill overlooking the Euphrates, 15 km north of Erzincan, at the northwestern border of the Urartian kingdom. Ozguc's excavations on its acrop- olis (1959-1969) had uncovered two levels of monu- mental buildings (a palace, columned audience hall, and temple-tower in a peristyle enclosure) with wall paintings and precious furnishings in ivory and metal; tombs with equally fine grave goods; and at the east end of the acropolis, an Early Byzantine church paved with mosaics of the highest quality. A new project, begun in 2003 by Mehmet Karaosmanoglu, is exam- ining questions raised by the earlier excavations and aims to restore and consolidate the exposed monu- ments. Soundings around the columned audience hall (apadana) now demonstrate that it belongs to a second building phase and overlies a predecessor, also with column bases, that would be contemporary with the original Late Urartian citadel layout. The central hall was later divided into smaller spaces, one of them a storage depot containing an oven and bench.78 Kerkenes. This vast Late Iron Age site (late seventh- mid sixth century B.C.E.) is enclosed in 7 km of granite fortification walls on Kerkenes Dag, south-southeast of Yozgat in the district of Sorgun in the northern Cap- padocian highlands. Geoffrey Summers and Francoise Summers report: The Iron Age capital was probably founded in the late seventh century B.C.E. It was looted and burnt, presumably by Croesus, king of Lydia, ca. 550 B.C.E. If these dates are correct, Kerkenes is surely to be iden- tified with the Pteria of Herodotus. Recent work has led to the unexpected recognition of Phrygian mate- rial culture. Excavations at the Cappadocia Gate and the monumental entrance to the palace complex were completed in 2005. Set up inside the Cappadocia Gate facing into the gate chamber was a built stepped monument on which was set a semi-aniconic stele of well-known Phrygian type, demonstrating a degree of Phrygian culture at Kerkenes. Other westernizing, or Phrygianizing, traits include pitched roofs and reed thatch together with architectural stone elements with good parallels in the highlands of Phrygia. In the lower part of the city, excavation in 2003 confirmed the existence of true megara, with central hearths and open porches. There are, however, significant differences between Gordion and Kerkenes, including an absence of architectural terracottas and pebble mosaics at Kerkenes. The monumental entrance at the eastern end of the palatial complex was the last and most impressive in a series of ever more ambitious schemes (fig. 12). In the course of these developments, the nature of the complex (which was largely defensive, with huge tow- ers supported by a stone glacis) changed. In a second phase, the inclined stone pavement was extended to the Audience Hall comprising a main room and an anteroom covered by a pitched roof supported on two rows of wooden columns on almost cylindrical sandstone bases. The Ashlar Building, with a course of finely cut granite blocks and, in the front room, a sandstone surround, stood immediately to the north. In the culminating phase, the entrance structure it- self was flanked by huge rectangular towers or raised platforms with tall courses of finely finished granite, white limestone, and yellow sandstone interspersed with horizontal timber beams. Pairs of freestanding wooden columns, some 0.85 m in diameter, stood on stone column bases at the front and rear of the entrance. The remnants of their stone capitals lay smashed on the pavement among other carved ele- ments from the tower facades. In the center of the passage stood a monumental wooden screen that, al- though destroyed in the fire, contained double-leaved wooden doors. There was a second such screen in the rear of the entrance where the width of the pas- sage was reduced by rooms on (presumably) either side. These screens perhaps resembled in some way the rock-cut architectural facades in the Phrygian highlands. Rows of semi-iconic stelae with plain faces encircled by raised bands of hair ending in bossed roundels on the shoulders, each about 1 m in diam- eter, seem to have stood shoulder to shoulder on the fronts of the towers. These are carved on both sides, and the front, eastward facing side is slightly inclined. In the morning sun, these iconic battlements would have been impressive. Several sculpted monuments stood in the passage, including one that is inscribed. A pair of stone plinths perhaps carried life-sized lions, of which one piece was found on the surface. One aniconic stele was found. Smashed on the surface and much disturbed by later pits were fragments of a sandstone monument with 77 For a report of the 2004 season, see Belli and Tozkoparan 2006.

These panels probably belong to the base for a sandstone statue. The front of the block shows a pair of griffin-headed genies supporting a winged sun-disc and holding vegetation. The inscrip- tion runs around the raised frame. A second inscrip- tion on the frame of a side panel tells us that Tata is making the dedication. Striding lions were included in the scheme on the side panels. The statue (fig. 13) , 1 m in height, depicts a human figure wearing a tunic and plain, pleated skirt. The head is not covered, the hair ends in curls, and there is no beard. The face is subtly and realistically molded with almond-shaped eyes in low relief, less fleshy cheeks and chin, and dis- crete mouth. The right arm, bent at the elbow, holds an object, perhaps a mace with a ferruled handle, over the right shoulder. The missing left arm neither hung straight down the side nor was held against the body; it was probably extended forward. The strong forward tilt of the head can now be understood as a gesture of peering down at the viewer below. One possibility is that it represents a young male ruler, perhaps a hero.79 Gordion. Recent findings of the multidisciplinary Gordion Archaeological Project directed by G. Ken- neth Sams have transformed our understanding of the Phrygian and post-Phrygian phases of settlement at Gordion. The redating of the massive destruction level of the Gordion Citadel Mound, one of the fixed points for the chronology of Iron Age Anatolia, up one century to ca. 800 B.C.E. as a result of radiocar- bon dating in 2001 and subsequent reexamination of artifacts from this level, will have major repercussions for our understanding of Phrygian culture, such as its relations with the Geometric culture of Greece. The destruction, perhaps by a catastrophic fire, can therefore no longer be associated with Kimmerian raids. Recent study of destruction- and post-destruc- tion level artifacts as well as dendrochronological dat- ing of a wooden log discovered in the Early Citadel wall in 2003 appear to corroborate this new, higher chronology and reveal that the rebuilding of the set- tlement mound took place soon after its destruction. Another major fixed point of Phrygian chronology, the so-called Midas Tumulus, has also been redated to an earlier period (ca. 740 B.C.E.) after recalibration of the dendrochronology of its juniper logs. The tomb can no longer be identified as that of Midas but may have been built for his father, Gordios. Fig. 12. Plan of monumental entrance at the eastern end of the palace complex at Kerkenes Dag (drawing by F. Sum- mers and G. Summers) . Excavations in the Gordion Citadel Mound's north- west, southwest, southeast, and central zones have in recent years provided new information about the Hel- lenistic, Roman, and Medieval phases of settlement. Excavations near trenches of R. Young from the 1950s at the south edge of the mound now provide a continu- ous sequence of Hellenistic pottery from the fourth to early second centuries B.C.E. from well-stratified domestic contexts of nonelite areas. Fragments of ar- chitectural terracottas including a raking cyma and heraldic lion may be associated with the late Phrygian building containing a mosaic floor, overlying rooms of a mid-Phrygian building (Building A) . Excavations also focused on the Roman and Medi- eval settlements in the western part of the mound. In- vestigations in the northwest zone provided evidence for two Roman building phases probably dating be- 79 For interim reports on the recent findings, including extensive resistivity survey that has helped reveal the extensive urban lay- out of the site, see Summers and Summers 2005, 2006.</page><page sequence="38">312 B.

Evident in the latter is a greater complexity in architecture, an increase in local coinage circulation, and the use of fine wares such as Eastern Sigillata, all indicating that the village of Gordion described by Strabo during the Augustan period had grown to a significant size and level of economic prosperity before its abandonment in the late second century C.E. Excavations in both the northwest and central zones support an abandonment of the mound for approximately a century, until the late third century C.E. A thick layer of fill (ca. 0.5 m thick) separates building phases with artifacts of ear- ly and later Imperial date. A fourth phase - the Late Roman reoccupation of the late third or early fourth centuries C.E. - was attested in all zones excavated. Rooms in the central zone in 2004 revealed a metal scrap pile containing fragments of Roman military ar- mor, including bronze and iron chain and ring mail, dating to the first or second century C.E. Another spec- tacular find in 2004 was made in the northwest zone: a lion-head of faience dated to the 13th century C.E. from either Anatolia or Iran. A Byzantine phase was also recovered in 2005 in the southwest zone during excavation of a semisubterranean rectangular build- ing, which contained holes at its corners for tripods. Finally, evidence of the bombardment of the area during the battle of Sakarya in 1922 was found in the form of an artillery shell.80 CLASSICAL, HELLENISTIC, AND ROMAN Pamphylia and Pisidia Roman Perge. The 2004-2005 campaigns directed by Haluk Abbasoglu, Istanbul University, at Perge's West Necropolis have brought funerary material culture of the Roman empire vividly to light. The most remark- able example, Tomb M9 (fig. 14), is two-storied, with a richly ornamented exterior facade and chambers containing five sarcophagi in situ and floors deco- rated with mosaics depicting Medusa and Okeanos. Sarcophagi on the ground floor include two plain examples made of local limestone, one partially fin- ished of Proconnesian marble inscribed with names of family members of the tomb, and one probably of Dokimeion marble with an Amazonomachy relief. The upper floor housed a large Attic Dionysian kline sarcophagus (fig. 15) of Pentellic marble in pristine condition with portraits of a reclining couple of the third century C.E. Ongoing investigations and restoration of the col- onnaded streets at Perge provide more examples of the important function these spaces served for the dis- play of honorific monuments in the urban life of the Roman Imperial period. In the west gallery of streets J9 andjll along the colonnaded main north-south thoroughfare of the city were found an inscribed base honoring a Gn. Pedanius Valerianus and fragments of portrait heads of the late second or early third century C.E. of a male and female wearing bust crowns.81 Bronze Age Perge.

A series of articles discussing recent studies of the multifaceted project has appeared in Kealhofer 2005. The final publication of seals and sealings at Gordion (Dusin- berre 2005) is remarkable for the range of chronology of the material (1800 B.C.E.-400 C.E.) and its discussion of style, technique, and iconography in relation to well-document- ed excavated contexts.

In 2004 and 2005, Ulku izmirligil continued her decade-long project to document and restore the theater. More elements of the Late Hellenistic/Early Roman Temple of Dionysos to its southwest were iden- tified in the infill cleared from chambers and shops along the exterior of the theater's stage building.82 Sagalassos. The archaeological project led by Marc Waelkens, Catholic University, Leuven, continued its comprehensive interdisciplinary program of excava- tion, conservation, restoration, and archaeometrical study of the Pisidian city and its territory. Waelkens reports: At the Upper Agora, the completed excavation of a two-storied nymphaeum (fig. 16) with aediculated fa- cade and wings revealed that its ground-floor niches were filled with colossal marble statues of the Olym- pian gods, including an enthroned Apollo Clarios (fig. 17), which occupied the central niche. The upper- story niches contained inscribed statue bases for bronze statues. The central niche featured a gilded statue of Hadrian (129-132 C.E.) flanked by those of Ti. Claudius Peison, the first Roman "knight" (eques) of Sagalassos, who, according to the inscriptions, fi- nanced the nymphaeum's construction through heirs as stipulated in his will. Excavation in the northern section of the Roman baths uncovered a large room (30.4 x 10.2 m, most likely of the period of Marcus Aurelius) made of solid brick curtain walls between ashlar piers. It was refur- bished in the fourth century C.E. with an opus sectile floor and reused marble wall revetment, some of which depict Egyptianizing scenes. In the fifth century C.E., the room was subdivided into an apodyterum with niched walls fitted with bathtubs and a frigidarium decorated with statues of Aphrodite of the Capitoline type and a putto carrying an amphora. Test soundings in the city's eastern domestic quar- ter confirmed that it was planned in the Early Roman Imperial period and that its houses were probably abandoned in the fourth century C.E. A decade of in- vestigating a large urban mansion here of the second century C.E. has uncovered 44 rooms arranged over three terraces/floors, and identified six major building phases from the second to late sixth or early seventh centuries C.E. In the seventh century C.E., more "ru- ralized" units occupied courtyards of the ground floor, 82 For reports of the 2004 and 2005 seasons, see izmirligil 2005, 2006.</page><page sequence="40">314 B.

Surveys of the countryside indicate that this phase coincides with the disappearance of suburban villas, suggesting that part of the farming activities of the landholding elite was transferred to their urban residences. Public spaces in the city were also transformed into private, artisanal, or commercial facilities in a similar pattern beginning in the fifth century C.E., after which they became pub- lic dumping areas before final abandonment after the earthquake of the seventh century C.E. Two-thirds of the total urban area enclosed within the necropoleis of the town has been surveyed. A geophysical survey of the Potter's Quarter identified a dense occupation in its center of workshops with at least 50 kilns. Specialized production of moldmade figurines, lamps, and flasks was found in a workshop with eight kilns dated to the fifth or early sixth centu- ries C.E. The kilns were transformed into lime-burn- ing units in the second half of the sixth century C.E. and abandoned by the end of the century. Anastylosis projects continued at the Augustan Northwest Heroon and at the Antonine Nymphaeum (161-180 C.E.) on the north side of the Upper Agora.83 Pednelissos. The Pisidian Survey Project, now led by Lutgarde Vandeput and Veli Kose, University of Co- logne, at this site, located in a mountainous region 30 km north of Perge, mapped and documented its monuments, urbanism, north and south necropoleis, and well-preserved Hellenistic fortification walls of its upper and lower cities. Ceramic surveys indicate occu- pation mainly from the second century B.C.E. to the seventh century C.E., with concentrations between the first century B.C.E. and first century C.E. and the fourth to seventh centuries C.E.84 Lycia Limyra. The "West City" of Limyra and its pre- Hellenistic phases are the focus of a new program of investigations led by Thomas Marksteiner. Soundings in the northwestern portion of the West City's Early and Middle Byzantine fortification walls revealed 13 consecutive strata of occupation extending from the Hellenistic to the sixth and perhaps early seventh cen- turies B.C.E. A terminus post quern of the early fourth century B.C.E. was established for the construction of the classical fortifications in this area.85 Xanthos andLetoon. Information on the urbanism of Xanthos' central quarter results from current inves- tigations led by Jacques des Courtils. Excavations of the decumanus maximus uncovered a major Roman Imperial refurbishment of the area in the form of two large porticoed agoras. A civil basilica of the first - or first half of the second - century C.E. extends along the northern agora's east portico. Underlying Hel- lenistic structures are on a different orientation and include a large cistern. Major discoveries for preclassical Xanthos come from soundings in the little-studied southeastern por- tion of the city. The investigators uncovered a large wall of Lesbian masonry at least 10 m in length and two blocks with reliefs featuring bulls in an oriental- izing Neo-Hittite and Phrygian style, similar to reliefs of lions found a decade earlier in the same area. In 2005, exposure of a Hellenistic extension of the wall revealed another relief fragment similar to these but at a larger scale. It preserves the lower legs of a kneel- ing, over-life-sized draped figure holding a smaller draped figure. If based on Neo-Hittite iconography, it might represent a ruler protected by a deity. The reliefs and wall could be part of a monumental gate to the city or a palace. A Chalcolithic axe found in a nearby sounding may point to settlement at a much earlier period than previously known.

A rare discovery, an undisturbed Lycian rock- cut tomb, was made 20 km north of Xanthos at Tlos during excavations of its necropolis led by Hawa I§kan I§ik. The door of the tomb, dated by an inscription to 340-250 B.C.E., was found sealed shut with plaster. Stratified grave goods indicate a long period of use, from the early third to the first centuries B.C.E.87 Classical Patara. Hawa I§ik and Fahri I§ik made an- other rare find at the west corner of this ancient har- bor city: a lighthouse of the Roman Imperial period. Removal of tons of sand exposed its three-stepped podium (20 x 20 m and preserved to a ht. of 3 m) as well as elements of curved walls for a round tower with an interior staircase that rose to a height of 20 m. A 25-30 m long dedicatory inscription by the provincial governor Sextius Marcius Priscus dates it to the third quarter of the first century C.E. Sand removal also uncovered the theater's cavea, orchestra, and large portions of its scaenae frons, as well as the entire cavea and orchestra of the bouleuterion, where a portrait, perhaps of Faustina the Elder, was found.88 Bronze Age Patara.

Creation of a new tourist route at this steeply sloped site provided Cevdet Bayburtluoglu's team the opportunity to investigate south of the Great Basilica at the Peristyle House, which appears to have been abandoned in the late fourth century C.E. and destroyed later by a fire, perhaps the catastrophic one of 430/440 C.E. Further indication of this aban- donment phase was found south of the house in the water channel of a public bath's frigidarium, which contained a hoard of 216 coins, mostly of the reign of Honorius.

A survey of Kibyra and its territory, where the cultures of Phrygia, Pisidia, Lycia, and Caria inter- sected, has been the focus of a project led by Thomas Corsten. Systematic investigation of archaeological remains began in 2001. In 2005, more evidence was revealed for the northernmost extent of the influ- ence of Lycian culture in the form of Lycian-type rock-cut tombs.90 As part of this project, a new survey of Boubon, 22 km southwest of Kibyra, was begun by Christina Kokkina, Institute for Greek and Roman Antiquity-Athens, who reports that after an extensive epigraphic survey in 2004, work in 2005 documented a rock-cut tomb or sanctuary on its acropolis, and nu- merous fortifications mainly of the Roman period on surrounding mountain tops. Phellos. A survey by Martin Zimmermann at Phellos, 5 km inland from its port city Antiphellos (modern Ka§) and midway between Myra and Xanthos, deter- mined that its urban scale peaked during the sixth to fourth centuries B.C.E. A subsequent decline was concomitant with its contributing to the growth of Antiphellos in the Hellenistic period. Zimmermann attributes the limited urbanization of Phellos as a de- liberate attempt by its citizens to preserve their city's Lycian material culture in a museumlike state as an expression of Lycian cultural identity.91 Beydaglan. Extensive surveys by Nevzat Qevik in the highlands between Lycia and Pamphylia 25 km west of Antalya continue to document Trebenna, Neapolis, Kelbessos, and their territories, as well as to identify new sites in the area such as In Onu.92 Lycian Epigraphic Surveys. An epigraphical survey of the necropoleis of Rhodiapolis, Karmylessos, and Pmara was completed in 2004 by Martin Seyer, who dates the large South Necropolis of Pmara no earlier than ca. 360 B.C.E.93 Caria Kaunos. Restoration of the site's Late Classical and Hellenistic monuments continued to be a focus of Cengiz I§ik's investigations, which completed an ana- stylosis of the fountain building at the Liman Agora to its original form of the late third century B.C.E. Evidence for the salt production attested in customs regulations inscribed on this fountain may have been located nearby, on the shore of Lake Iztuzu.94 Burgaz, Datca. Investigations led by Numan Tuna, Middle East Technical University at Burgaz, docu- mented the transformation of its urban polis of the Ar- chaic and Classical periods, perhaps the precursor for Hellenistic Knidos, into a more ruralized settlement of the Hellenistic and Roman periods.

A decade of excavations led by Ramazan Oz- gan on the so-called Dionysos terrace has uncovered most of a 130 m long stoa with 25 chambers, each 5 x 4 m and lavishly decorated with opus sectile and marble revetment. It was in use perhaps as part of the Dionysos sanctuary, from the early third century B.C.E. to the second century C.E. Recent clearing of rubble from the terrace recovered another relief depicting a maenad with tamborine and satyr from the frieze of its Dionysos temple. Reinvestigation of monuments concluded that the so-called Sanctuary of the Muses is more likely a nymphaeum, and that the so-called Gymnasium ap- pears to be a building with a different function.96 Knidos Shipwrecks. Reinvestigation of shipwrecks in the vicinity of Knidos was the focus of the annual survey led by Faith D. Hentschel, Institute of Nautical Archae- ology, Texas A&amp;M University, in collaboration with Orkan Koyagasioglu, Sualti Arkeoloji Enstitusu. They report that five shipwrecks of the Classical, Late Ro- man, and Early Byzantine periods were reinvestigated in 2004 as well as one of the seventh century B.C.E. in the harbor at Kekova Island on the coast of Lycia. Its contents included Cypriot basket-handled amphoras and others from Samos and Corinth.97 Halikarnassos. Poul Pedersen's investigations on the north and west slopes of the Zephyrion peninsula for the presumed remains of the Palace of Mausolus con- tinued to document a large terrace (11 x 13 m), with foundations of green andesite ashlar blocks similar to those of Mausolan walls, and associated staircases along a fortification wall below the 15th-century C.E. crusader chapel. After a survey discovered LH IIIA and Protogeometric pottery, settlement on the penin- sula now appears to be much earlier than previously thought.98 Myndos. Systematic excavations began in 2005 at Gumusluk Beldesi, 18 km west of Halikarnassos at the western tip of the peninsula. This coastal site has excellent strategic harbors and a substantial granite pseudo-isodomic city wall with square towers, most likely part of the Mausolan refoundation of the city. Mustafa §ahin, Uludag University, reports, at the so-called military harbor, remains of a Roman bath building, and elsewhere, evidence for earlier settle- ment phases in the form of a tower with cyclopean walls on the acropolis, Mycenaean ceramics, and an Archaic kouros." Iasos. Restoration and preservation of the House of the Mosaics and excavation of the agora continue to be a focus of investigation led by Fede Berti, Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Ferrara. She reports: Excavations in the west stoa of the agora, beside the fornix doorway, uncovered two rooms. Sealed be- neath the burnt destruction layer in one of them were bronze and iron artifacts, polychrome marble wall and floor revetments, fragments of wall paintings and floor mosaics, and a lava quern stone. An Iasos struck coin of Maximinus provides a terminus post quern, prov- ing that the fire that affected the eastern side of the agora occurred after 235-238 C.E. A large limestone block inscribed with a metrical epigraph, probably of the fourth century B.C.E. and mentioning the dynast Idrieus, was found in situ inside the wider of the two rooms. Near its base were a small marble head, finely modeled (a Muse?), and the moldmade bottom of a rare Knidian terracotta patera decorated with an erotic scene.100 Mandalya, Iasos. A survey of the chora of Iasos in 2004-2005 at the Gulf of Mandalya was led by Raffa- ella Pierobon-Benoit, Universita di Napoli Federico II, who reports: At Akarca Tepe, a Hellenistic period settlement was documented with so-called Lelegan-type houses of the third to second centuries B.C.E. grouped in small villages with tombs. The settlement appears to have been militarized, with garrisons and a fortification wall with towers, sometime in the third century B.C.E. Un- derstanding the reasons for this development paral- lel to the fortification of Iasos and the identity of the inhabitants of Akarca Tepe remain a focus of future investigations.101 Lagina.

Work in the sanctuary of Hekate discovered a frag- ment of a relief frieze distinct from the main frieze of its Corinthian peristyle, which could have decorated the architrave of its cella walls.102 Nysa. Vedat Id.il, Ankara University, reports: A detailed architectural study of the agora and its stoas, particularly the better preserved east and north stoas with double Ionic colonnades, has permitted a more secure restoration of their elevation and re- vealed that the outer dimensions of the agora (113.5 x 130.0 m) are larger than those published in earlier studies. Investigation of the urban plan continued, exposing portions of the cardo maximus, paved with polygonal conglomerate blocks and aligned with the west side of the agora. The decumanus connected the so-called East and West cities, most likely via a bridge at the north end of the stadium, where excavation of a nymphaeum at the bridge's southwest base determined that it was built after the terrace wall of the stadium. Northwest of the stadium, trenches south of the Hadrianic library between its central and west entrance uncovered a monumental hyposorion containing bones of a couple in their 30s. Its richly ornamented lid is stylistically similar to the library's architectural decoration. Excavation at the stage building of the theater revealed a symmetrical plan with staircases at either end for access to the second floor. Eight heads of figures from the elaborate Dionysian frieze of its podium were stolen in 2005, despite new protective barriers built after blocks had been stolen in 2004. Remains of the Temple of Kore and Pluton at the nearby cult site and sacred cave of Acharaca (Salvath) indicate it was of the Corinthian order and probably dates to the Hadrianic period. A fragment of drapery for a monumental statue was found, which must have been associated with the temple.103 Aphrodisias. The archaeological project of New York University at the well-preserved site of Aphrodisias has focused in recent years on better understanding its urbanism through excavations based on extensive geophysical prospection, which has enabled a recon- struction of the city's grid plan. Study and publication of the well-preserved marble sculpture from the site aim to record the mass of material excavated from 1961 to 1990. R.R.R. Smith and C. Ratte report: Study of the city's mid fourth-century C.E. fortifica- tion wall has shown that its exterior consisted largely of spolia from about 1 ,000 monumental tombs from surrounding cemeteries outside of town, and not, as previously thought, from public buildings within the city. Excavation and study of the stadium of the mid or late first century C.E. revealed that its stairways pro- viding the main access to the building from the south were aligned with streets as part of an integral plan. Excavations in the stage, orchestra, and beneath the radial supporting vaults of the bouleuterion of the late second century C.E. found no conclusive evidence of an earlier bouleuterion attested in inscriptions. Investigation of a rectangular feature visible in the geophysical survey in the southwest corner of the North Agora revealed a courtyard or pool 19.7 x 26.7 m and 2.5 m deep, lined and paved with marble slabs and below ancient ground level. It dates no later than the Hellenistic or Augustan period, which is consistent with the epigraphic dating of the initial monumental construction of the agora. Investigation of the agora's east stoa found Late Roman structures at its central doorway and a large room projecting 18 m beyond the back wall of the east stoa at its southeast corner. Excavation to the room's floor level revealed a major Late Roman renovation, which required complete dismantling and re-erection of two columns aligned with the inner colonnade of the south stoa. In front of a marble-paved niche centered on the room's north wall were found fragments of a portrait statue of Ti- berius, namely parts of the ankle and statue's head, an adjusted official version of the Tiberius type. Its body of the Dresden Zeus type was found in 2002 reused in a nearby Ottoman wall. Excavation of the grand chamber at the south end of the Roman Civil Basilica at the southeast corner of the South Agora permitted reconstruction of its elevation, which consisted of an elaborate marble- faced interior with a three-storied engaged order. Two significant finds were (1) a 1:1 elevation draw- ing incised on floor slabs, which depicts the upper part of a vaulted and pedimented classical building similar in form and scale to the Tetrapylon; and (2) a high-quality, well-preserved late Antonine portrait head (fig. 18) found on the floor, together with the 102 A report of the 2004 season is found in Tirpan and Sogiit 2006. 103 For the 2004 season's report, see Idil and Kadioglu 2006.

An anastylosis project was begun to rebuild the east end of the South Building of theJulio-Claudian Sebas- teion. Excavations for this project uncovered a head- less portrait bust and acanthus acroterion with eagle, most likely from the temple of the Sebasteion. A regional survey of the territory of Aphrodisias, begun in 2005, will bring new insights to the unstud- ied relationship between the city and its abundant natural resources from prehistory to Ottoman times. A series of citadels and hilltop watchtowers suggests a defensive system for the valley that was developed by the Late Classical period, and a number of tumu- lus tombs attest a culture of local dynasts that existed before the foundation of the city in the early second century B.C.E.104 Labraunda. Lars Karlsson, Uppsala University, reports: Fifty-two rock-cut tombs, all near or in view of the Holy Road leading from Labraunda to Milas, were sur- veyed as well as 32 spring houses closely connected to this road, which suggests they were built in the fourth century B.C.E. On top of the acropolis, a fortress with nine towers containing an inner fortress with two tow- ers and barracks was documented as well as five free- standing towers on small hilltops in its vicinity. They appear to be part of a defensive system to protect the sanctuary in the late Hekatomnid period. Excavation in the apse of the Byzantine church in the sanctuary revealed a burial, most likely an ossuary for a hermit monk or local saint.105 Hyllarima. Epigraphical and archaeological surveys led by Ender Varinlioglu and Pierre Debord in 2004 of this inland Carian site 20 km south of Bozdogan found in the vicinity of Asarcik Tepesi an in situ bilingual inscription in Carian and Greek of 263/262 B.C.E. referring to an Apollo sanctuary as well as evidence of streets on a grid plan east of the theater.106 Chersonese. Surveys led by Winfried Held of settle- ments at Loryma on the tip of the Carian Chersonese peninsula, and more recently (2005) Bybassos and Kastabos at its north end, are attempting to define the self-representation and development of these set- tlements as an independent political Carian League from the Archaic to Hellenistic periods, when it came under Rhodian control.107 Zeynep Kuban led a survey Fig. 18.

New investigations led by Andreas Furt- wangler, Martin-Luther-University, Halle-Wittenberg Universitat, continued the long-term restoration and consolidation of the Hellenistic Didymaion and fo- cused on its various phases, particularly of the Archaic temple (Temple II) . In 2004, a sounding in the south pteron of the Late Classical Didymaion revealed that its foundations were not set on bedrock, as previously thought, but in a 5 m deep clayey layer. Soundings southwest of the temple in the so-called Southwest Stoa determined that it should date to the sixth century B.C.E. instead of the seventh.

YILDIRIM AND M.-H. GATES [AJA 111 Archaic layer of 530-520 B.C.E. with indications of burning can be associated with terracing of the area for the sanctuary of Temple II. Remains of Early Archaic and Late Geometric artifacts were found underneath this stoa in the deposit of a streambed, which must have been fed by the sacred spring in the sanctuary of the first temple (Temple I). Furtwangler reports: A sounding in the north pteron of the Late Classi- cal Didymaion uncovered deep stone foundations of Temple II. Soundings in the Late Classical adyton re- vealed that the west wall of Temple I's adyton should be reconstructed 4 m further west than previously thought. There was no evidence for foundations of a dipteros plan for Temple II. Examination of the walls of the naiskos of Temple II determined that the Ar- chaic naiskos was destroyed before the construction of the Hellenistic one, which, based on cuttings and spolia in its west wall, was partially or completely built from elements of other structures within the adyton of the Late Classical/Hellenistic Didymaion. An east-west oriented wall between those of the naiskos of Temple II was first set in place in the Early Byzantine period, most likely as part of a staircase of the baptismal area of the first church. Finds from soundings completed at the Taxiarchis mound, mainly drinking vessels, some of which have votive inscriptions, corroborate the identification of its upper terrace as an Archaic sanctuary from the first half of the seventh century B.C.E. , which was destroyed in the second half of the sixth century B.C.E.109 Miletos. Volkmar von Graeve, Ruhr Universitat, Bo- chum, reports: In 2005, research on Bronze Age Miletos, led by Barbara Niemeier and Wolf-Dieter Niemeier, ended with a study season after 10 years of excavation of the Bronze Age layers at the Athena temple. Research on Archaic Miletos continued at the sanctuary of Aphro- dite (Zeytintepe). Excavations on its western terrace confirmed the hypothesis, first formulated in 2003, that a quarry was located here, supplying limestone for the Late Archaic temple erected during the last quar- ter of the sixth century B.C.E. on the top of the hill. Following its completion, this quarry was refilled with quarrying refuse, marble chips from the superstruc- ture, and settlement debris, presumably transported from neighboring Oikous (see below). At the same time, it also served as a large bothros for an unusually large number of high-quality votive offerings, which were deposited in this inaccessible spot in an action resembling a ritual burial. The range of finds from the 2005 campaign cor- responds to the previous year's. Terracotta figurines are very common - some are still complete and pre- serve their original coloring. New coroplastic types were also found: double-headed vases combining the heads of a veiled woman and a satyr, reclining revel- ers, and reclining satyrs. Miniature animal figurines are also common. Among the rich bronze finds are several phialae mesomphalos, jewelry, and vessel at- tachments. Noteworthy was a sixth-century griffin pro- tome from the Aphrodite sanctuary and a large bronze shield suitable for actual use in battle and retaining its original wooden backing. Pottery, the largest class of finds, comprises many vases in the Fikellura style, including masterpieces of figured Milesian vase paint- ing of the sixth century B.C.E. They are dominated by mythological representations, especially of Aphrodite and Dionysos. Geophysical survey of the city and its environs discovered a new harbor on the eastern side of Hu- meitepe, new tombs on the Sacred Road outside the Sacred Gate, and the presumed suburb of Oikous, mentioned in literary sources, on the westernmost part of Degirmentepe, in the immediate vicinity of the sanctuary of Aphrodite "of Oikous." Geomagnetic prospection of a street system between the Late Helle- nistic city wall and Kalabaktepe showed the same ori- entation and insula size as in the southern part of the city but with lesser building density and later buildup of debris. This area was either a thinly settled suburb of classical Miletos within the fifth-century B.C.E. city walls (which demons trably included Kalabaktepe) or the remains of a Late Archaic street system. Accord- ing to recent theories for redating the "younger" Athena temple, this street grid may have formed the template for the city's rebuilding after the Persian destruction.110 Prime. Wulf Raeck, J.W. Goethe Universitat, Frank- furt am Main, and Wolf Koenigs, Technische Univer- sitat, Munich, are examining closely the stratigraphy of Priene's houses to clarify questions about the regu- larity of the division of insula into eight equal parcels during the foundation phase of the city in the mid fourth century B.C.E. They report: 109 For the 2004 season's report, see Furtwangler 2006b.

Examination of Insula F15 revealed that the two adjoining parcels in its southwest quadrant were joined soon after the foundation phase, which suggests that it may have had a public function, since this is a feature found occasionally in the phases of the plans of public structures at Priene. In Insula E5, the plan and architectural history of a building with two Hellenistic phases have been clarified. The middle of the building contains a small plastered court, and in the south and southwest, three rooms opened to the north, for occasional use as triclinia. In the southwest corner room were found well-preserved wall paintings with geometric decoration and stucco imitation of ma- sonry that belong to the first phase of the house. Com- pletion of investigations in the northwest residential quarter determined that, with only a few exceptions, it was no longer inhabited after a major destruction phase due to a natural disaster in the second century B.C.E. A continuous sequence of habitation from the Early Hellenistic to the 14th century C.E. was deter- mined for the eastern sector of the city. A study of the Athena temple concluded that its sanctuary was first expanded in the Late Hellenistic period, when there was a surge in public building in the city.111 Melia and Archaic Panionion. A survey by Hans Lohm- ann of Mount Mycale, north of the Milesian and Lat- mian gulfs between Soke and Cape Dip Burun (ancient Trogilion), in 2004-2005 identified a settlement with large fortification walls as the site of Melia and the Archaic Panionion, about 5 km north-northwest of Priene and 2 km east of Fmdikh Kale between Qatal- lar Tepe and Belenkuyu Tepe. Within the walls were found remains of a temple 100 Attic feet in length and oriented east-west, with a large assembly (?) chamber at its west end and Ionic capitals and terracotta lion- headed antefixes. The temple, perhaps that of the Panionion, saw a short span of use, in the second half of the sixth century B.C.E. Pottery of the seventh cen- tury B.C.E. and a fine group of terracotta sculptures of warriors indicate an earlier phase, preceding this temple and its sanctuary.112 Magnesia ad Maeandrum. The 20th year of excava- tions led by Orhan Bingol, Ankara University, was marked by the completion in 2004 of the anastylosis of the west pediment of the Artemision, which contains a central doorway, and of the architectural study of the so-called Theatron, which lacks a stage building and was left unfinished probably because of a landslide in the late first century C.E.113 The first systematic exca- vations of the stadium began in 2004 and uncovered several rows of marble seats with topoi inscriptions and part of the podium wall of the arena, which was decorated with reliefs, including a tropaion. Excava- tions in the agora at the south half of the east stoa found part of a cryptoporticus. One of its exposed piers had remains of a wall painting defaced in a later period, depicting a garland and perhaps a chariot rid- den by a female figure (Artemis?) holding a lance in her right hand.114 Ephesos. Despite a century of investigations, much remains to be discovered, reexamined, and preserved at this metropolis of the Roman province of Asia. This report lists only some of the many projects car- ried out by the project's large interdisciplinary team. Friedrich Krinzinger, Austrian Archaeological Insti- tute, reports: A definitive study of the mausoleum at Belevi has determined that it can be securely dated to the early third century B.C.E. based on the style of its architec- tural ornament and ceramic finds from new excava- tions. The tomb was not covered by a pyramidal roof, as proposed in earlier reconstructions, but rather consisted of a covered columnar peristasis surround- ing an open inner court. The main entrance from the north was emphasized by an inner colonnade with fine palmette capitals behind an exterior row of Corinthian columns. The inner tomb chamber cut out of bedrock contained a kline sarcophagus, a life- sized statue of a royal attendant, and a table, most likely arranged in a manner similar to scenes found on Totenmahl reliefs. Excavation and study of the theater for its defini- tive publication conclude that it existed at its present location since the mid third century B.C.E. and went through at least two to three refurbishments from the Domitianic to Late Roman periods. The extent and plan of the Hellenistic foundation of the city by Lysi- machus, particularly of the ports between the two forti- fications in the extreme west and northeast of the city, was another focus of research. A substantial wall, which may belong to this same phase (third century B.C.E.) , was found underneath Room 25 of Residential Unit 5 in Hanghaus 2.

GATES [AJA 111 and dated to the second half of the second century B.C.E. suggests that luxury residences also occupied this area in the Hellenistic period. Geophysical survey of the Upper City found evidence for a grid plan and dense occupation in the Roman period. More fragments were found of a major statuary group, honoring the family of Vedius in the second century C.E., in the so-called Kaisersaal of the bath- gymnasium complex known as the Vedius Gymnasium (fig. 19). The group, which belongs to the original phase of the gymnasium, was later deposited during the leveling of the area around 400 C.E. as part of a major refurbishment. Excavations of the bath com- plex of the gymnasium revealed the use of the latest technological innovations of its day: a well-preserved testudo to regulate the heating of the water. The completion in 2000 of an innovative roofing sys- tem over the better-preserved Hanghaus 2 (4,000 m2) has ensured the preservation of the area and aided in the research of its residential units. Reexamination of the finds and the stratigraphy of earlier excavations of the houses have determined that the final catastrophic layer caused by an earthquake dates to ca. 262 C.E., providing an important new terminus ante quern for the houses. This redating will have a major impact, particularly on the chronology of Roman wall paint- ing and mosaics in the eastern provinces.115 Klaros. Excavations at the oracular Sanctuary of Apollo at Klaros, which resumed in 2001 under the directorship of Nuran §ahin, discovered a road paved with limestone slabs, and dated by ceramic evidence to the seventh century B.C.E., below the sacred way of the fifth century B.C.E. on a different north-south orientation. It may clarify the relationship between the settlements of Notion and Colophon and the cult center during this earlier period. Klazomenai. A more detailed picture of the prehis- toric settlement and the transition from the Bronze to the Iron Age at Klazomenai has been revealed by recent excavations directed by Guven Bakir, Ege Uni- versity. He reports: On the south slope of the prehistoric mound at Li- man tepe, solid structures of early Pro togeome trie date set directly on Bronze Age layers suggest there was no gap at the site in its transition to the Iron Age. Apsidal, single-room house units with strong stone socles were exposed directly under the Late Classical levels. Their pottery dates to the late sixth century B.C.E., like con- Fig. 19. Fragment of a female head from a marble statuary group decorating the so-called Vedius Gymnasium of the second century C.E. at Ephesos (F. Krinzinger). temporary dwellings of the same plan previously exca- vated elsewhere at Klazomenai. The curvilinear plan in house architecture was well rooted at this site, in contrast to other Archaic settlements in the Aegean. Test soundings at the Hamdi Balaban Tarlasi sector (HBT) in the so-called Basileia, a large mansion of the second quarter of the fourth century B.C.E., found it was partly built over an olive oil production facility dating to the middle of the sixth century B.C.E. They suggest that, contrary to earlier assumptions, houses were being built in the area in the latter years of the fifth century. Some date earlier than the large pros- tas houses of the late fifth to early fourth centuries B.C.E. aligned with the grid plan to the northeast of the mansion. Excavation to the east of the mansion's well-made terrace wall showed it partially destroyed an earlier city wall with a tower on its west face. A replica of the sixth-century B.C.E. olive oil plant with mud- brick walls and thatched roof made of reeds is now fully functional.116 115 For an overview of recent excavations, see Krinzinger 2006.

Recep Meric, Dokuz Eyliil Uni- versity, reports: Excavations on the acropolis of Metropolis revealed the east and west gates of its Byzantine fortifications and the road connecting them as well as architectural elements of a temple of Ares. The so-called Han Yikigi on the east slope of the city appears to be a 40 x 40 m Roman bath complex, probably dating to the early second century C.E.117 Old Smyrna, Bayrakh. Excavations directed by Meral Akurgal of a necropolis of the first half of the sixth century B.C. E. outside the Early Archaic city wall (ca. 640-620 B.C.E.) uncovered a second city wall running parallel to it of well-cut polygonal masonry and built in 600-590 B.C.E. soon after the Lydian attack. At this time, the upper mudbrick levels of the inner wall were replaced with a stone leveling course and fine Lesbi- an masonry. Excavations revealed that the outer wall formed a wide gate, perhaps protected by a tower, at the entrance to the Archaic Athena temple.118 Roman Agora, Smyrna. After a long hiatus, systematic investigation of the Roman Agora at Izmir resumed under the direction of Mehmet Ta§halan, Izmir Ar- chaeological Museum, in collaboration with a French team led by Thomas Drew-Bear, who reports: Excavations in the center of the agora and along its north side facing the Hadrianic civil basilica un- covered Hellenistic levels and wall foundations that indicate the agora was not an empty space before its Roman Imperial phase. Buildings of this earlier phase were also found incorporated in the substructures of the west portico and basilica. Reexamination of the basilica allows a new reconstruction of its elevation, most notably the placement of figured relief panels, such as of Poseidon and "Demeter," in the space be- tween the chamfered piers of the second story facing onto the central nave.119 Mount Olympos, Izmir. A new survey at this mountain (Nif) east of Izmir began in 2004 under the direction of Elif Tiil Tulunay, Istanbul University, who reports finding remains from the seventh century B.C.E. to the 13th century C.E. as well as evidence of extensive illicit digging.120 Erythrai After a long hiatus, systematic investigation of Erythrai under the direction of Co§kun Ozgunel, Ankara University, began in 2003 to reinvestigate monuments within the city, to document its extensive 4 km fortification walls (fourth century B.C.E.), and to create a digital topographical plan of the site and its necropoleis, some now partially submerged, which extended along the ancient road to Klazomenai.121 Kizilburun. Deborah Carlson and Donny Hamilton, Institute of Nautical Archaeology, Texas A&amp;M Univer- sity, led investigations of the Roman shipwreck (first half of the first century B.C.E.) discovered in 1993 on the coast at Kizilburun at the edge of the Korykos Mountains 30 km south of Erythrai. The ship's cargo included eight unfluted drums and what appears to be a Doric capital, all newly quarried, belonging to a monumental column about 9 m tall. Examination of a sample drilled from one of the drums during the 2005 excavation season revealed that the marble drum(s) likely originated in the Marmara region of Turkey. Lydia Sardis. Excavations led by Crawford H. Greenewalt, Jr., University of California, Berkeley, focused in recent years on the East and West Lydian city wall exposures and a monumental Roman sanctuary in the central area of the site. Investigations 1.35 km east of the Lyd- ian city wall and related defenses (at sector MMS) in 2000 made the significant discovery of more remains of the Lydian defensive wall immediately under the Roman city wall. The Lydian city was therefore locat- ed in the area of the Roman city rather than west of MMS around the Pactolus stream, as previously be- lieved. Excavation of the mudbrick core of this wall at the eastern limit of the city uncovered an interior corridor. Structural wood incorporated in the mud- brick wall was burned completely, most likely during the Persian capture of Sardis in the 540s B.C.E., and provoked massive wall collapse. On the west side of intramural Sardis (sector MMS/ S) just inside the Early Archaic Lydian city wall where a rectilinear recess opens east, more deposits were exposed, including iron objects, parts of wagons(?), two sickles, spits, and pottery immediately underneath the destruction stratum associated with the mid sixth- century B.C.E. Persian attack. Investigations continued in the large recess along the outer west face of the wall to determine the stratigraphic sequence leading up to the Archaic fortification construction. At least four more levels extend back to the late seventh century B.C.E. below the destruction stratum. A gold and a 117 For the 2004 season's report, see Meric et al. 2006.

The terrace wall retains a massive artificial fill dated by pottery to the mid to third quarter of the first century C.E., ap- proximately the date proposed for the Wadi B temple (on purely architectural grounds) when it was pub- lished in 1986.123 Investigations can now posit from this terrace wall and its orientation a 2 ha platform for the sanctuary. The Wadi B temple is a very large pseudodipteral temple (similar in scale to the Temple of Zeus at Aizanoi) with Attic-Ionic bases, and is per- fectly aligned with and axially centered on the terrace. Recent excavations showed that it faces north onto the terrace and not east as suggested earlier, when only a corner had been discovered. Excavations at the west side of the terrace uncovered marble sculptural and architectural fragments such as a Corinthian figured capital with depictions of Herakles and 12 inscrip- tions, including several on statue bases and one on an architrave. Abutting a staircase of the temenos wall is a Late Roman residence with tiled floor and wall painting imitating opus sectile, four iron sword blades (spathae), coins from the fifth century C.E., as well as pottery of the fifth to sixth centuries C.E. In 2005, a probe below the terrace fill revealed Lydian walls and part of a floor with a pattern created by pebbles of two different sizes and colors.124 Bin Tepe. Christopher Roosevelt, Boston University, reports: The Central Lydian Archaeological Survey begun in 2005 focused on a 72 km2 region south of the Gygean Lake (Marmara Golu) known as Bin Tepe ("A Thou- sand Mounds"), commonly thought to be the royal burial ground for the ancient Lydian capital of Sardis located about 10 km to the south, to understand better the settlement, burial, and land use patterns as they develop diachronically in response to environmen- tal, sociopolitical, and economic changes.

He reports: Completion of a building to protect the Hellenis- tic stucco decoration, wall painting, and Roman floor mosaics of the large peristyle Building Z (fig. 21) was celebrated at the site in August 2004 by an interna- tional symposium on the achievements of excavation projects in western Asia Minor ("Stadtgrabungen und Stadtforschung im westlichen Kleinasien: Geplantes und Erreichtes" 126) in light of their original objec- tives. Documentation of buildings in the Roman lower city focused on the Red Hall in order to complete its plan and to study its relation to the urbanism of the lower city. Archaeological finds from the substructure vaults of the Trajaneum excavated in 1978-1981 were reexamined, and a color reconstruction drawing of a painted ceiling from a vault was completed. A new program to determine the layout of the statuary in the large gymnasium was begun with soundings in areas where statue bases and foundations existed or were thought to exist, and numerous statue fragments were examined and documented. Detailed investigation of the urbanism of the city, its Hellenistic fortification walls, and its territories will be part of the program of research by the new di- rector, Felix Pirson, German Archaeological Institute- Istanbul. He reports: Activities in 2005 concentrated on concluding archi- tectural research in the Red Hall complex and on the study of a small Roman bath in the Wohnstadtgrabung, accompanied by the conservation of the complex excavated in 1974-1975. Geomagnetic work on the southeast slope (Sildostabhang) of the acropolis hill produced traces of two streets, which subsequently were corroborated by small excavations and obser- vations on the surface, permitting a new hypothesis about the layout of the east-west tracks of the street grid below the gymnasium complex (fig. 22). If our reconstruction proves to be right, a remarkable rela- tion between the layout of the street grid and central features of the gymnasium, such as staircases, becomes obvious. It provides new insights into the planning process during the enlargement of the Hellenistic city, probably in the second century B.C.E. Soundings in the eastern wing of the Upper Gym- nasium provided evidence for the layout of the first Hellenistic building and its furnishing (second cen- tury B.C.E.) . A hitherto unknown eastern wall of the Hellenistic Upper Gymnasium was found to run be- tween the east wall of the rooms opening to the large Fig. 21.

Salvage excavations since 1998, under the direction of Ahmet Yara§, Trakya University, at Pa§akoy Ilicasi, 18 km to the northeast of Pergamon, have uncovered 9,000 m2 (25%) of the extraordinarily well-preserved site, an ancient thermal resort identi- fied by the director as Allianoi. Herculean efforts by the director have managed to delay the Yortanh Dam project, which threatens to flood the site by dam- ming the Ilya River, ironically the major reason for the site's preservation, since the river originally ran through the site, silting it over, in some cases up to 7 m deep. Excavations have provided an unparalleled opportunity to study a Roman High Imperial thermal resort with luxurious bath complexes decorated with marble sculpture, polychrome revetments, mosaics, wall paintings, and stucco, which were part of a larger grid-planned community.

Plan of Pergamon during the period of Eumenes, showing areas of investigation (F. Pirson; courtesy Pergamon- Grabung, DAI Istanbul). Excavations west of the site at the necropolis at Cak- maktepe found burials dated to the Augustan period, indicating the site must have already been exploited for its water resources prior to its monumentalization in the Hadrianic period. An earthquake of 178 C.E. appears to have ended the first major phase of build- ing at the site, which by the early third century C.E. revived and continued to function into the Early Byz- antine period, when chapels and a basilica were built. A second earthquake in 262 C.E. may have precipitated the flooding and abandonment of the northern por- tion of the resort. Sophisticated engineering channeled four hot springs about 47°C via two parallel tunnels (as in the Red Hall at Pergamon) , which diverted the river into the north and south sectors of the city, connected by two bridges. Work has focused on the well-preserved North and South Bath complexes. In the North Bath complex (fig. 23) a magnificent basilical hall 23 x 16.5 m (fig. 24) silted up to its roof level was uncovered, revealing polychrome geometric floor mosaics and a double row of monolithic columns of granite from Kozak with composite capitals of the first half of the second century C.E., two of which were found in situ. Its barrel-vaulted roof was decorated with stucco acan- thus leaves on its diagonally set ribs. Fragments of wall painting found in the silt indicate the walls were also decorated. Two apsidal halls with pools were connect- ed to the north side of the hall. The larger of these is a barrel-vaulted hall (14 x 13 m) containing three pools and niches for statues through which cold water from Cam Tepe was piped into the pools. A cryptoporticus entered from the northwest corner of the basilical hall was uncovered, revealing its well-preserved roof with tiles in situ. Numerous metal surgical tools and pestles found in a large peristyle building just to the north of the bath complex suggest the building had a medical function.128 Aigai In 2004, Ersin Doger began the first sys- tematic investigations since those of R. Bohn and C. Schuchhardt of the 1880s at this Aiolian city 35 km south of Pergamon. Excavation in front of the cavea of the bouleuterion uncovered a group of six Late Hellenistic marble portrait statues on top of architec- tural debris from a roof. A thick layer of fill between this level and the floor, on which was found a coin of 267 C.E., indicates a period of abandonment before the final collapse of the roof and the statuary group. An inscription on the support near the foot of one of these statues states that it was made by Hippias of Pergamon, son of Menestratos. Phocaea. Omer Ozyigit's heroic struggles to preserve Phocaea from the constant threat of modern develop- ment have led to remarkable finds in limited parcels of the modern city of Foe. a. The remains on the penin- sula are actually the extension of a much larger settle- ment area from the Bronze Age to the Roman period centered on the mainland. Excavations of the Archaic Athena temple uncovered its podium with walls dated by ceramic evidence to 590-580 B.C.E. and in a similar style as the sixth-century B.C.E. city walls. The podi- um's stone fill, which contained pottery from the Early Bronze Age to the last quarter of the seventh century B.C.E., cut through an oval tower made of polygonal stone construction preserved to a height of 5 m and dating to the Protogeometric to Geometric periods. Next to the podium wall were found Corinthian capi- tals of the temple's Roman phase, which probably dates to after the earthquake of 178 C.E.; marble Ionic capi- tals (ca. 2 m diam.) of the Archaic temple; and, most spectacularly, finely carved marble griffin and horse protomes with a rectangular tenonlike end for inser- tion into an architectural feature, which the director 128 For reports of the 2004 and 2005 seasons, see Yaras, 2005a, 2005b, 2006a, 2006c, 2006d.

Excavations led by Sebastiana Lagona, Univer- sity of Catania, continued to concentrate on the port, monuments in the center of the city, and the North and South hills' residential districts. Lagona reports: In 2005, new excavations below the port's medieval castle exposed more of the andesite foundations of a harbor wall dating to the last quarter of the fourth century B.C.E. A foundation wall with clamps along the harbor now appears to have extended at least 100 m. Aligned with it is a paved area enclosed by an elegant apsidal portico, probably a market agora of the Hel- lenistic period similar to those at nearby sites such as Priene. A gold coin of the sixth century C.E. was found on a later pavement of the agora, which maintained the dimensions and layout of the earlier version.130 Troad Troy. For classical Troy-Ilion, see above, under "Bronze Age: Western Turkey." Assos. The passing of limit Serdaroglu brought an untimely end to his 23 years of excavations and re- search at Assos. The new director, Nurettin Arslan, Qanakkale Onsekiz Mart University, reports: In 2004-2005, restoration of the well-preserved clas- sical city walls continued. A sounding at its West Gate revealed that the wall was set on bedrock and dated to the early fourth century B.C.E. Excavations at the West Necropolis found the first example of a small plate of local production of the Archaic period with a painted figure (warrior?) (fig. 25). Smintheion. Investigations led by Co§kun Ozgunel, Ankara University, at the Apollo sanctuary celebrated their 25th year in 2005. Restoration work since 1989 concerns its temple, specifically parts of the opisthodo- mos and krepis at its northwest corner. Excavations just outside the temenos wall revealed a structure with fine cut masonry, which may be a water reservoir. Antandros. Excavations, which began in 2001 at the site near the (^anakkale-Edremit coastal road in Bahkesir province, have uncovered a Late Roman house with floor mosaics and a small bath complex. Excavation of the well-preserved so-called Melis ne- cropolis revealed a variety of inhumation and crema- tion burials, mainly of the second half of the seventh 129 For a report of the 2004 season, see Ozyigit 2006a.

Elmar Schwertheim, Universitat Munster, reports: Excavation of a portico at the east end of the forum uncovered finds from the first to fourth centuries C.E., including numerous pieces of floor and wall opus sec- tile with human and animal representations and floral motifs, marble and bronze sculptural fragments, and a fountain. Excavation of the cryptoporticus at the west end of the forum revealed elements of a Doric hall aligned with it. A paved granite street, most likely Hellenistic in date, was detected running along the forum to the harbor.132 Sigeion, Yenisehir. A survey of this colony of Athens established in 620 B.C.E. at a harbor 6 km south of Troy began in 2005 under the direction of Thomas Schaefer. Ceramics of the seventh to fourth centuries B.C.E. confirm its historical tradition. Parion. The well-preserved necropolis of Parion near the coast of the Marmara Sea 20 km west of Priapos (Karabiga) was the focus of excavations led by Cevat Ba§aran that began in a systematic manner in 2005. Burials of various types from the first half of the fourth century B.C.E. to the Roman Imperial period, similar to other cemeteries in the region (Antandros, Darda- nos) , were found with high-quality artifacts including gold jewelry and crowns.133 Granicus, Biga. In response to a dramatic increase in looting, the Granicus River Survey project was begun in 2004 under the direction of C. Brian Rose, Uni- versity of Pennsylvania, in collaboration with Reyhan Korpe, Qanakkale Onsekiz Mart University, to record one of northwestern Turkey's most significant burial grounds, where up to 100 tumuli can be associated with Persian satrapal estates (546-334 B.C.E.). Rose reports: Surveys of the area of Biga (ancient Granicus) and Karabiga (ancient Priapos) on the coastal plain in the vicinity of the Granicus and Aisepos rivers and tributaries have identified more than 40 sites, largely tumuli, which all date to the period of Persian oc- cupation in the late sixth to early fourth centuries B.C.E. These tombs highlight the contrast between the wealthy Persian hinterland and the impoverished, nearly abandoned, cities on the west coast during the Classical period. It seems clear that the wealth of the interior, dominated by Daskyleion, continued without significant interruption through at least the first half of the fourth century, at which point the fortunes of the coastal cities again revived. The small Hellenistic and Roman sherd samples corroborate epigraphic evi- dence for a hiatus in land use after the defeat of the Persians in the fourth century B.C.E., causing landed estate holders to move to cities. Increased land use is evident by the Middle Byzantine period beginning in the 10th century C.E., and peaks in the 13th, when the region and its strategic port near the citadel of Kara- biga fell under the control of the Nikaian empire. The quarrying of Proconnesian marble from the Is- land of Marmara and its associated sculptural activity appear to have been initiated by the rich tomb burials of the satrapal estates, since all those excavated were made of this marble, such as the magnificent marble sarcophagus of ca. 500 B.C.E. featuring the sacrifice of Polyxena by Neoptolemos. It is the earliest datable example for the use of Proconnesian marble as well as the earliest stone sarcophagus with flgural scenes found in Asia Minor. Prior to its discovery, archaic and classical stone sarcophagi with figural scenes were known only from Lycia, Cyprus, and Sidon. The accepted location of the battle of Granicus may now need to be revised as a result of a geological survey that indicates the course of the river was different than previously thought.134 131 For a combined report of the 2003-2004 seasons, see Polat and Polat 2006. 132 For the 2004 season's report, see Schwertheim 2006b.

Excavations at the citadel by Sait Ba§aran continued to clear four underground chambers first investigated in 1978-1983 that contained ceramics largely of the sixth to fourth centuries B.C.E. The fifth-century B.C.E. cultural horizon is most evident at the Qakilhk necropolis, where a variety of burials have been excavated. They include cremation burials in bronze hydriae encased in two limestone blocks shut with led clamps and buried in the ground, and a rock-cut grave 1.90 m deep and 1.60 m wide contain- ing remains of a person cremated in the tomb, and five lekythoi of the second half of the fifth century B.C.E. with white-ground and red-painted figures.135 Heraion Teichos, Karaevliath. Excavations since 2000 led by Ne§e Atik may have identified the ancient port city of Heraion Teichos at a site on the coast in the Karaevliath area of Tekirdag province. Soundings on the acropolis within the fortification walls at the north gate and flanking towers discovered remains of cham- bers around two courtyards. Numerous medical instru- ments and objects such as a marble mortar, bronze medicine bottle, ceramic cup with "pharma" written on it, and an oven for burning the shells of murex brandaris, as well as terracotta votives of body parts and figurines of deities such as Hygeia, confirm the func- tion of the medical facility of the first century B.C.E. to first century C.E. and its related cultic activities. Classi- cal and Hellenistic housing was also identified. Many fine red-figure Attic imports and stamped amphoras largely of the fourth to third centuries B.C.E., includ- ing examples from Thasos, Rhodes, Knidos, and Sin- ope, attest to the extent of trade connections.136 Nicomedia, Kocaeli. In 2005, Ay§e Qelik Ross began an extensive survey of the city and its region, to record its large theater, stone quarries, aqueducts, roads, cisterns, and a necropolis with mainly third-century sarcophagi. Hadrianoupolis, Eskipazar. The site in southern Paphlagonia on the border with Bithynia 3 km west of the main east-west route at modern Eskipazar near Karabiik was the focus of a survey begun in 2005 by Ergiin Lafli, Dokuz Eylul University, who reports that the site and its environs served as hinterland vinicul- ture areas in the Classical to Early Byzantine periods, and that Phrygian gray ware was found in the teme- nos of a Roman temple at the nearby hilltop site of Kimistene.

The temple settlement of the cult of Ma at Comana Pontica may have been lo- cated by Deniz Burcu Erciyas, Middle East Technical University, during a survey in 2004 of Hamamtepe 9 km northeast of Tokat by the Ye§ihrmak River, and of necropoleis on hills to the south of the river.137 Sinope. The Sinop Regional Archaeological Project, led by Owen Doonan, begun in 1996 as the terrestrial portion of the Black Sea Trade Project, combining land and maritime surveys of the Sinop area to examine cul- tural formation, exchange, and production, completed its first phase in 2004. Published results examine pro- cesses such as colonization in the context of the dia- chronic relationships of its archaeological landscapes from the Neolithic to early modern periods.138 Phrygia Aizanoi.

Excavations at the southeast corner of the Zeus temple's podium revealed a two- chambered mudbrick and wood rectangular house- like structure from EB I (2900-2400 B.C.E., based on radiocarbon dating) , which may have been a public edifice. A Phrygian pithos, ceramics, and oven were found on top of Bronze Age levels below the south corner of the colonnaded court of the sanctuary. Within the Byzantine wall in this area, remark- able evidence of High Hellenistic domestic culture was found in a house dating from the early second century B.C.E. Its wall paintings, ceramics, statuettes, and seals were preserved in a burnt destruction layer of the mid second century B.C.E. A bouleuterion or odeion with a parados built from reused seats, perhaps from an earlier theater, was excavated in this area northwest of the Doric columnar court, and dated to a Trajanic phase of terracing of the mound for the Zeus sanctuary.139 Gordion. See above, under "Iron Age: Southeastern and Central Turkey." Pessinus. John Devreker, Gent University, reports: Excavation of the Early Roman Imperial temple fo- cused on determining the date of its north-south wall for which three phases were identified: the Late Hel- lenistic, Roman Imperial, and Late Roman. A build- ing divided into two small spaces built against the wall on its west side may be a subterranean chapel of the Early Christian period in a sacred zone between the Roman temple and the basilica of St. Sophie. Exca- vations determined that after the destruction of the agora in 392 C.E., there was an intermediate phase before the construction of the small theater to the south of the temple. A survey of the Hamamtepe plateau found circular walls 10 m in diameter made of local stone similar to ones documented on the western elevations of the Dindymos in 2002-2003, a small sanctuary with pro- naos, a Phrygian (?) rock-cut tomb near a large rock- cut basin (15 x 4 m) with a pair of small round and rectangular basins, and at the south end of the plateau, a citadel with fortification towers and walls similar to the Hellenistic walls of Pessinus. On its east slope, ter- races with large rectangular structures more than 100 m in length were discovered. Pottery from the survey consisted largely of simple plain ware, wheelmade ce- ramics from the Phrygian to Roman periods. Some of the Phrygian gray ware had inscribed decoration and graffiti including a Phrygian sign or arrow.140 Hierapolis. Significant new insights on the Apollo sanctuary and urbanism of Hierapolis in the Roman and Byzantine periods were gained in the recent cam- paigns led by Francesco D'Andria, Universita degli Studi di Lecce, who reports: Removal of the tourist car park and road at the Apollo sanctuary (fig. 26) revealed four terraces, whose highest one contained foundations and architectural remains of a large Ionic peripteral temple of the Tibe- rian period. The so-called Apollo temple of the third century on a lower terrace of the sanctuary must now be considered the building of the oracle connected to the cave of the Plutonion below it. In its center was found a bothros for libations to chthonic divinities. The civic agora may have been identified at the pool of the mu- nicipal motel on the site, where remains of Ionic por- ticoes and a first-century C.E. monumental door at its north side, oriented in relation to the Frontinus street, were documented. The earliest known depiction of a hydraulic saw used for cutting stone blocks was found in low relief on a sarcophagus (fig. 27) of the second half or end of the third century C.E. from the necropo- lis. A sixth-century C.E. Greek inscription of a Manasse prayer, from the "Song of Solomon," hitherto known only from examples on papyri, was found written in red paint on the plastered walls of a room in the western portion of the House of the Ionic Capitals. Satellite images helped identify the processional route associated with the creation of the Martyrion complex of Saint Philip between the late fourth and early fifth centuries C.E. Excavations along the route beyond the Theodosian city walls found a bridge built in the fifth century C.E. and numerous coins dating between the fourth and ninth centuries, perhaps evi- dence of a ritual associated with the passing of the bridge. An octagonal building (11th century C.E.) of unknown function was discovered beyond the bridge, as was a watchtower of the 13th century C.E., perhaps from the Seljuk phase of occupation.141 Laodicea. More information about the settlement landscape of the Lycus Valley is expected from new ex- cavations at the site of Laodicea, which were resumed in 2001 after a long hiatus.

Its so-called Bath-Basilica is actually a single bath com- plex of 100 x 70 m, probably of the second century C.E. Monuments along the road have been newly ex- cavated: a nymphaeum with columnar, aediculated two-storied facade, projecting wings, niches filled with statuary, including a statue of Athena in the central niche, and an inscribed dedication to Septimius Sever- us; and the Temple A complex (previously referred to as a Sebasteion) made up of a large, Corinthian colum- nar courtyard (13.4 x 27.2 m) and adjoining Roman- type prostyle Corinthian podium temple in antis with a vaulted chamber under its naos, probably dating to the late second or early third century C.E. Sculptural finds from the temple include statues of emperors and dei- ties, an under-life-sized Ephesian Artemis cult statue, and two columns dedicated to Apollo and Diana with Latin vota inscriptions and reliefs featuring these dei- ties and Fortuna of the city. The vaulted chamber was filled with ampullae of the fourth to sixth centuries C.E. A well-preserved workshop (fig. 29) dated to the fifth century C.E. for dyeing textiles was discovered in the North Necropolis. Surveys identified the marble source for Hierapolis at Domuz Deresi in the lower slopes of the Salbakos Mountain.142 Galatian Survey, Ankara. The relationship between Galatian fortresses and settlements of the Hellenistic period in the region of Ankara and Kmkkale are now better documented by the extensive surveys of Levent Egemen Vardar, who reports that since 1996, more than 110 forts have been identified.143 Cappadocia Tyana-Kemerhisar. Systematic excavations at this site on the route connecting the highlands with the Medi- terranean coast began in 2001 under the direction of Guido Rosada, Universita degli Studi di Padova, who has focused on the water systems of its Roman phase, which took advantage of the site's abundant water re- sources. Rosada reports: An attempt to identify the location of the distribu- tion tank (castellum aquae) where the aqueduct entered Tyana in the "Su Kemer" suburb in the northeastern part of Kemerhisar discovered the baptismal basin of a baptistry with a polygonal apse, polychrome opus sectile floor, and walls revetted with motifs and figures in cut marble and glass. Coins found inserted in an outflow canal of the monumental pool, the so-called Roma Havuzu, at K6§k Hoyiik near the source of the aqueduct supplying Tyana, date it to the beginning of the third century C.E., when classical sources claim 142 For a report of the 2004 season, see §im§ek 2006. 143 For the 2004 season's report, see Vardar 2006.</page><page sequence="58">332 B.

The well-preserved floor levels of a Roman bath, also built in the early third century C.E., were excavated at the south edge of Tyana.144 Cilicia Kelenderis. The origins of the antique port town of Kelenderis were found to extend far earlier than the eighth century B.C.E. as a result of investigations of its acropolis led by K. Levent Zoroglu. Late Chalcolithic ceramics and relatively few Bronze Age ones suggest a hiatus in settlement until the sub-Geometric pe- riod, when the mound was resettled, and remained occupied well into the Hellenistic period. Work also focused on the excavation of an Early Byzantine ba- silica of the fifth to sixth centuries C.E. in the agora and on the so-called Theatron, for which a definitive chronology was not obtainable because of extensive contamination by the cemetery of a recent church (18th and 19th centuries C.E.). Underwater surveys of the site's natural harbor, on the closest route to Cyprus, found stone and metal an- chors that attest to the harbor's use as an anchorage from the Bronze Age to the Late Roman periods. At nearby Yilanh Ada, the Erkut Arcak wreck, which con- tained at least 60 amphoras mainly of the Late Roman 1 type of the sixth and seventh centuries C.E., could be evidence for exportation of olive oil or wine from Kelenderis in late antiquity.145 Soloi/Pompeiopolis. Excavations conducted by Remzi Yagci at the Roman settlement of the harbor city, 1 1 km west of Mersin, continued at its colonnaded street (depicted in Beaufort's Karamania of 1817), where, in 2003, parts of a statuary group of the Severan pe- riod of Asklepios, Nemesis, Pan, and Dionysos were found. Additional fragments as well as honorific por- trait statues and figured capitals with heads of Pan and maenads peering out above acanthus leaves have been recovered. The porticoes in the Early Byzantine period (fifth-sixth centuries C.E.) were occupied by merchants' stalls formed by partitions erected between columns; one of these stalls was decorated with an opus sectile mosaic. Inscriptions on columns refer to business and craft corporations.146 Excavations on the mound produced fine imported Greek and Cypriot pottery as well as Archaic terracotta architectural plaques with figures of lions, warriors, and sphinxes, and vegetal motifs. Bronze Age Soloi See above, under "Bronze Age: South- eastern and Southern Turkey: Soloi/Pompeiopolis." Rough Cilicia Archaeological Survey. This project, led for a decade by Nicholas Rauh, and since 2004, by Mi- chael Hoff, has documented seven cities and villages in western coastal Rough Cilicia. In 2004, the Roman and Late Roman monuments of Kestros, located on the ridge of mountains overlooking Selinus/Traja- nopolis near Alanya, were documented, and in 2005, those of Antiocheia ad Cragum, including a fine po- dium temple-like building, probably a temple-tomb of the Antonine or Severan periods. A maritime survey directed by Cheryl Ward discovered remains of a port at Iotape and the ancient harbor of Antiocheia ad Cragum, near the modern village of Giiney, where a small bronze socket in the form of a winged horse for a boat timber, dated to the Late Hellenistic/Early Ro- man Imperial period, was found. Seaborne commerce increased during the period of piracy before Roman control, and encouraged the cultivation of export crops such as wine and olive oil in the region.147 Taskent. A new survey begun in 2005 by Asuman Baldiran, Selcuk University, at Ta§kent in southern Isauria 155 km southwest of Konya identified ossuaries with mythological scenes, in the nearby town of Av§ar, perhaps ancient Olosada.148 Korykos, Kizkalesi. A new survey of the site located 60 km west of Mersin began in 2004 under the direction of Serra Durugomil, Mersin University, who reports 144 For the 2004 season's report, see Rosada 2006. 145 For reports of the 2004 season, see Evrin et al. 2005 (un- derwater survey) ; Zoroglu et al. 2006.

One hundred meters northwest of the Armenian castle is a Roman temple datable to the second quarter of the second century C.E. based on the style of its decoration, which is simi- lar to a colonnaded road found 1 km to its east.149 Diokaisareia, Uzuncaburg. Detlev Wannagat's survey, begun in 2001, completed documentation of the site's necropoleis, mainly rock-cut, from the Late Hellenis- tic/Early Roman periods to the sixth century C.E. He discovered a cross-formed pool for the Early Byzantine baptistry - when the Zeus Olbios temple was converted into a church - and, at the temple's northwest corner, the floor of the pteron of its Hellenistic phase.150 Olba. In 2004 and 2005, Emel Erten continued her survey of Olba's churches and necropoleis, largely rock-cut tombs.151 Alahan, Goksu Valley. The Goksii Archaeological Project, a systematic survey to understand the settle- ment patterns, communication, and economy of the uplands and lowlands between Mut (ancient Claudiop- olis) and Karaman (ancient Laranda) in the Taurus Mountains of Rough Cilicia, began in 2002, focusing on areas to be flooded by the Mut Dam as well as the well-preserved Early Byzantine churches at Alahan. Hugh Elton, British Institute at Ankara, reports: Mainly Roman and Medieval sites, roads, and bridg- es were found throughout the valley, as was evidence of extensive wine and oil production, attested in Late Ro- man written sources, in the form of rock-cut wine and oil presses. Approximately 180 mainly rock-cut tombs of the necropoleis within a 2 km area of Alahan were documented, and a small classical city surrounded by a Late Roman fortification wall was discovered under- neath Alahan village. An Early Bronze Age settlement was detected at Qomlek Tepesi, and nearby Paleolithic chipped-stone processing centers.152 Karasis, Kozan. A new survey led by Adolf Hoffmann in collaboration with Mustafa H. Sayar is document- ing a well-preserved Seleucid fortress, perhaps the site of Kydnia, on a steep ridge of Karasis Mountain in the east Cilician Taurus range 8 km from Kozan. It includes a two-story granary, approximately 60 m long, and 15 m tall fortification walls.153 Anazarbos. A new survey led by Richard Posamentir, German Archaeological Institute-Istanbul, in collabo- ration with Sayar, was begun in 2004 at the site situated Fig. 28.

Posa- mentir reports: Geophysical prospection at the northern section of the site showed grid-planned areas and others with structures, including a 90 m long foundation, likely of a temple. New monuments were discovered: an archway of late antiquity; a large propylon on top of the rocky spur (presumably of a temple precinct); a church; a second rock-cut staircase up the spur; and a monumen- tal sepulchral building in the style of a Macedonian chamber tomb on the summit of the spur, perhaps for the founder of the city. The theater, circus, honorary monument, and colonnaded road with 1,400 columns appear to be contemporaneous in style, indicating monumentalization of the city in the second half of the second century C.E. when the city became the capital of the Roman province of Cilicia Secunda.154 149 For the report of the 2004 survey, see Durugonul et al. 2006.

A new phase of investiga- tions led by Kutalmi§ Gorkay, Ankara University, be- gan in 2005. He reports: The main objectives of the first seasons are to es- tablish the infrastructure for a long-term program of excavations, which includes appropriation of land to ensure the entire site is protected. Excavations were carried out mainly at the so-called Dionysos and Da- nae Houses in order to better understand their plan and stratigraphy. A Riegl three-dimensional scanner is being used to create a three-dimensional digital topographical map of the city.155 DuliikBaba Tepesi, Doliche. Since 2001, investigations directed by Engelbert Winter, Minister University, of the site of Duliik Baba Tepesi in the vicinity of ancient Doliche 10 km north of Gaziantep have uncovered the main sanctuary of the god Jupiter Dolichenus, which has evidence of uninterrupted sacrificial activity from the first millennium B.C.E. until its destruction by Shapur I in 235/236 C.E. Winter reports: A Late Iron Age basalt stone capital in the shape of a bull's head found in the northeast area of the hilltop appears to be a local imitation of an Achaemenidic prototype. A monumental polygonal basalt stone pave- ment was found to end at a monumental building complex of Roman times at the center of the hilltop sanctuary. Artifacts from the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. found in an ash layer associated with sacrificial rituals predating the Hellenistic-Roman phase of the sanctuary include pearls, amulet stones (fig. 30) , stamp and roll seals (fig. 31), and Attic black-figure pottery, as well as scarabs from the Levant, Syrian-Phoenician miniature grotesques, and a small bronze statue of Osiris.

New excavations at Adramytteion, known in the Byzantine period for its harbor, on the Edremit Bay at the Oren area of the Burhaniye town- ship of Bahkesir province, have focused on uncover- ing a church with a simple, domed cross-in-square plan of the late 10th to early 11th centuries C.E. built over a necropolis dating to as early as the sixth cen- tury B.C.E.157 Anaia/Kadikalesi, Kusadasi. Systematic excavations at the 12th century C.E. citadel known as Kadikalesi built on a mound identified with the settlement of Anaia with remains as early as the third millennium B.C.E., 8 km south of Ku§adasi, began in 2001 under the direction of Zeynep Mercangoz, Ege University. She reports: Excavations continued as in previous years at the East Gate of the citadel and inside and outside its southwest corner producing largely Late Byzantine (12th-13th centuries C.E.) terracottas and abundant evidence of ceramic production in the form of tripods used in setting up pottery in the kiln for firing, wast- ers, and thick ash layers. Amorium. Christopher S. Lightfoot, Metropolitan Museum of Art, reports: Since 1998, excavations have focused on the cen- ter of the site known as the Lower City Enclosure, where intensive use and occupation are evident for the Byzantine period (sixth-llth centuries C.E.). A major discovery was a small freestanding bath com- plex probably built in the sixth century C.E. with a major refurbishment perhaps in the second half of the eighth century C.E., when the large entrance hall or apodyterium was abandoned. The entrance hall is 16-sided and had an adjoining rectangular suite of bathing rooms and a latrine. Both tepidarium and caldarium have well-preserved hypocausts. It repre- sents one of the very few known Byzantine public balnea. The bathhouse continued in use into the first half of the ninth century C.E. Near it are buildings of mixed functions (residential, commercial, industrial) , some contemporary with the bathhouse during the Dark Ages (650-800 C.E.), others showing reoccupa- tion of the area during the Middle Byzantine period (ca. 900-1080 C.E.), when a massive defensive wall Fig. 30. Jewelry of the sixth to fifth centuries B.C.E. from Diiluk Baba Tepesi (E. Winter) . Fig. 31. Stamp seals of the sixth to fifth centuries B.C.E. from Duliik Baba Tepesi (E.

Excavations in the area in 2005 exposed the well-preserved remains of two grape-treading vats, both dated to the earlier part of the Dark Ages (seventh-eighth centuries C.E.). One had subsequently been converted to store grain before it was destroyed by fire, probably as part of the general destruction seen across the site and associated with the sack of Amorium by the Arabs in 838 C.E. Next to the same installation, a stretch of unpaved street was also 156 For a preliminary report of the excavations from 2001 to 2003, see Blomel and Winter 2005.

GATES [AJA 111 exposed, its size and orientation suggesting that some elements of the (Late) Roman city plan had survived until the ninth century C.E. Work also continued in the Lower City Church in preparation for a major conservation and preservation project culminating in a roof over the entire structure. In 2002, work in the narthex uncovered several tombs in the floor, which had well-preserved organic remains including silk and leather shoes. Several had reused Middle Byzantine stone slabs in their construction, indicating the church underwent several phases of re- furbishment and redecoration between the late ninth and the 11th centuries C.E. To the north of the main body of the church, an entire baptistry was excavated in 2005 at its western end. This formed part of the original Early Byzantine (fifth-sixth centuries C.E.) ecclesiastical complex and included a sunken cruci- form font at its center. The baptistry remained in use throughout the Byzantine period, but in the 10th and 11th centuries C.E., the font was filled in and paved over. Three tombs, one in the baptistry and two in its narthex, were added at that time and match the series of tombs previously excavated in the main narthex of the church. Evidence was also found for subsequent use of the area by Seljuk Turkish settlers in the 13th century C.E. Surveys of the west necropolis and rock- cut tombs of Phrygian type were also conducted.158 Myra-Demre. Excavations in 2004-2005 under the direction of S. Yildiz Otiiken in the area north of the St. Nicholas Church at Myra exposed at the southern part of Structure D an arcosolium containing a wall painting and two stone cist graves, one of which was covered with a stone panel decorated with a lion in relief. The family burial is probably of the patrons of the structure built in the 12th century C.E. Numer- ous metal objects and architectural elements, includ- ing stone balustrades with vegetal, geometric, and cross-motif openwork, were found in the southern portion of the northern chamber (D3) of the build- ing. Remains of earlier Roman walls were uncovered in orientations that differed from the overlying walls of Structure D. Along the south side of the western courtyard, soundings in the western vaulted chamber of Structure E uncovered fragments of polychrome opus tessalatum and vegetal and geometric marble inlay comparable to those of the Sarachane. A coin of the reign of the Seljuk sultan Izzeddin Keykavus II (r. 1246-1249) found in a prealluvial layer provides a new terminus ante quern for this structure. A trapezoidal structure probably associated with the ritual processing of myrtle (myrrh) was revealed in the courtyard. Restoration of a unique series of wall paintings of the life cycle of St. Nicholas in the southern burial chamber of the church was completed in 2005. 159 Qadir Hoyu'k For its Byzantine levels, see above, under "Bronze Age: Black Sea Coast and Central Turkey." Elaiussa Sebaste. Over a decade of investigations by E. Equini Schneider at Elaiussa Sebaste on the coast between Silifke and Mersin has documented an ex- tensive building phase in the Early Byzantine period, when ceramic finds attest trade with Cyprus, Syria, and Palestine. A mid sixth-century C.E. destruction layer containing numerous fragments of polychrome mar- ble and opus sectile from wall revetment of an apsidal hall (22 x 11 m) and its annexes may be evidence of a violent civil revolt of the Justinianic period attested in the writings of Procopius. The discovery of a skel- eton of a man with an arrowhead in his chest found in situ in front of a doorway under a collapsed wall on a road connecting the complex to the mainland, which was closed for defensive purposes, may point to Persian or Arab invasions of the seventh century C.E. Work in 2005 focused on the south promontory and agora, where Roman levels were reached and remains of a peristyle domestic building of the first half of the second century B.C.E. to the early first century C.E. were revealed. The house was modified in the second century C.E. when public buildings were built in the area. Work continued in the temple and its under- ground, barrel-vaulted chamber, refurbished into a cistern in the fifth century C.E., when the temple was converted into a church.160 Yumuktepe, Mersin.

Soundings on the west rise of the settle- ment mound to determine the date of the Red Walled Monumental Structure revealed that its earliest levels belong to the Iron Age.161 Surveys Kucukyah, Istanbul. The latest investigations under the direction of Alessandra Ricci at Kiicukyah, now an archaeological park, on the Asian side of Istan- bul, have shown that the large, triple-apsed, domed, cross-in-square-plan church and its cistern of 2,700 m3 capacity should be identified with the Monastery of Satyros (867-877 C.E.) and not the Palace of Bryas of the first half of the ninth century C.E. as previously thought. A refurbishment in the 12th century C.E. of a "reliquary chapel" and opus sectile flooring in the apse of the church was also documented. Georadar and geoelectrical prospection combined with topographi- cal study indicates the church and cistern were the nucleus of a much more extensive complex. Great Imperial Palace, Istanbul. The phases and chro- nology of the landing staircase structures have been the focus of recent surveys by E. Bolognesi Recchi Franceschini in the Boukoleon area on three lower terraces of the Great Palace complex at the edge of the southwest sector at the foot of the curved end of the Hippodrome. Five phases of four long stretches of walls between the towers of Belisarios at the west, no longer extant, and the lighthouse at the east with re- lated structures were identified. The second phase may have been a west-east staircase connecting a sixth-cen- tury C.E. apartment with the Boukoleon. This staircase was replaced in the early ninth century C.E. with the north-south landing staircase during a fourth phase. The third phase is evident to the west of the landing staircase and consisted of a second ashlar wall on the seaward side of the first wall (now divided by the rail- way of the Orient Express) and arched openings per- mitting access between passageways above these two walls. Examination to the east of the landing staircase focused on the loggia above the fifth-century C.E. sea- walls and an earlier bath complex of the second half of the ninth century C.E.162 Yenikapi, Istanbul. A major discovery for maritime archaeology and our understanding of ship-building technology of the Byzantine period has been made during a massive construction (the Marmaray Project) begun in 2005 to connect the European and Asian dis- tricts of Istanbul with a tunnel underneath the Bospho- rus. Excavations along both sides of the seaside road between Aksaray and Yenikapi, at the point where the tunnel will connect with a metro station, have uncov- ered city walls with subterranean passageways of the fourth century C.E. considered to date to the period of Constantine the Great. Most importantly, well- preserved remains of at least eight boats dating to the seventh to 1 lth centuries C.E. were found in a harbor of Theodosius I. Round-the-clock rescue excavation, documentation, and preservation of the finds is being led by Ismail Karamut, Istanbul Archaeological Mu- seum, in collaboration with Sait Ba§aran, Istanbul University, and Cemal Pulak, Texas A&amp;M University. The boats and finds will be exhibited as part of an on-site museum and at the Istanbul Archaeological Museum. Fatih and Eminonu, Istanbul. The ongoing survey by Ferudun Ozgumus, of Byzantine remains focused in 2004 on the district of Fatih, where a brick-vaulted structure, probably of the 11th century C.E., was iden- tified near the Peribleptos Monastery. In 2005, survey of the Eminonu district revealed a high concentration of Byzantine remains, including an unrecorded cistern (late fifth-early sixth centuries C.E.) and ajustinianic building.163 Ayasojya, Vize. Surveys of the church of Hagia Sophia at Vize in the district of Kirklareli, 30 km north of the coast of the Marmara Sea, have focused on clarifying its building phases, elevation, and the basilical plan of its ground floor and that of its barrel-vaulted gallery level supporting its central dome, and on determining how best to restore its now decaying structure, which may have originally been built in the eighth or ninth century C.E. after an earlier church of the fifth or sixth century C.E. was torn down.164 Byzantine Monasteries, Marmara. The ongoing survey of the numerous monasteries on the south coast of the Marmara Sea seeks to identify their relation to written sources, principally the Lives of the Holy Monks. Discov- eries in 2004 included between Mudanya (Apamee) and Kocadere (Rhyndakos stream) , the first monastery of Nikephoros of Medikion of the late eighth century C.E.; an unknown monastery farther west at Mesudiye (Ayazma) , probably of the 1 lth to 13th centuries C.E.; and a known one of similar date on the north side of 161 For the report of the 2004 season, see Ozgen et al. 2006. 162For a report of the survey in 2004, see Franceschini 2006; see also Bardill 2006. 163 For the report of the 2004 survey, see Ozgumus, and Dark 2006.

The survey continued along the coast to docu- ment these sites further and identify communication routes between the monasteries along the coast and sites in the uplands.165 Qamalti Burnu I Shipwreck. Nergis Giinsenin's exca- vations of this 13th-century C.E. ship ended in 2004. She reports that it had a capacity of probably 100 tons, and is one of the last known examples of the use of am- phoras as containers for sea trade (in this case, wine) before the introduction of wooden barrels.166 Pepouza and Tymion. Discovery in 2000 of an in situ inscription south of U§ak referring to the Roman colonies of Tymion and Simoe instigated a survey of the region by Peter Lampe, who suggests that Simoe is located northeast of the inscription and Tymion to its southwest at the village of §ukraniye. Byzantine re- mains 12 km south of Tymion, perhaps of Pepouza, were documented, including two rock-cut cloisters, one with wood radiocarbon dated to the second half of the ninth or 10th century C.E.167 Qanh Kilise. The final publication of Bob Ouster- hout's survey of Qanli Kilise, the first systematic survey of a site in Cappadocia, challenges the view that rock- cut settlements of Cappadocia were primarily enclaves of monks living in the wilderness by proposing that the settlement at Qanli Kilise was a town with all the features of a typical Byzantine community.168 Finds recovered from a burial disturbed by looters in the narthex of the church include manuscript fragments and an icon, indicating the metropolitan connections of the settlement during its heyday in the 10th and 11th centuries C.E.169 Selime and Yaprakhisar. Another reevaluation of Mid- dle Byzantine settlements of Cappadocia as being lay rather than monastic is made by Veronica G. Kalas, Mid- dle East Technical University, in her survey of Selime and Yaprakhisar at the north opening of the Peristrema Valley (Ihlara) in western Cappadocia. Kalas reports: Fifteen rock-cut complexes with courtyards and adjoining churches are most likely a loose associa- tion of domestic residences of the 10th and 11th cen- turies C.E. One called Selime Kalesi, connected to a fortification on top of a cliff above, is the largest and most elaborate recorded in Byzantine Cappadocia and may be considered a lay domestic residence of a local warlord, which would characterize the region as a frontier zone controlled by magnate families. It is not clear whether Selime Kalesi dates to the first push by these families into the region following the Persian and Arab invasions in the ninth and 10th centuries C.E. or the period after the families gained control and settled in the area in the 10th and 11th centuries C.E. as part of the Byzantine empire. The pilasters and blind arcades of the superimposed registers of impres- sive rock-cut facades preserved at Yaprakhisar (fig. 32) were documented in detail and appear to have been status markers with no correlation with the interior architecture.170 Olympos. Yalgm Mergen, Anadolu University, re- ports that her new survey of the port city of Olympos, 57 km southwest of Antalya, mapped a large portion of the site's primarily Byzantine phase, and identified in the city a quay and harbor discovered at the base of the southern pier of a bridge over Olympos creek (modern Akgay) ,171 Kelosk Kale. Turgut Saner led an architectural sur- vey near Birecik at this site with chapels, cisterns, and architectural monuments built in the opus africanus technique. The buildings are considered to be part of a monastic complex of the fifth to sixth centuries C.E.172 Artvin, Erzurum, and Ardahan. A new survey of me- dieval Georgian architecture in these provinces was begun by Fahriye Bayram, who recently published a study of Georgian monasteries at Artvin.173 ISLAMIC Excavations Demirkoy Fatih Dokumhanesi, Kirklareli. Systematic investigations led by A. Osman Uysal and Ziilkuf Yil- maz since 2000 have revealed three building phases of the fortified 17th-century C.E. foundry in Kirklareli province, which continued in use into the 19th cen- tury C.E. as well as evidence of the exploitation of the rich metal resources of the region extending back into prehistoric times.174 Iznik Kilns.

Excavations by Bedri Yalman of the Ro- man theater of Nicea (Iznik), which became a dump in the Byzantine period and a ceramic workshop in the Ottoman period, produced remains of a section of the theater's vaults and fragments of a frieze from the theater, including depictions of a sword and horse. A layer of burials, perhaps of the Byzantine period, was also found, as were thousands of tripods for use in the kilns and ceramics (including 16th-century C.E. jugs) of the Roman to Ottoman periods, Begin. Excavations at Begin, 5 km south of Milas, in 2004 identified what may be a small lodge (zaviye) with mosque, meeting room, and kitchen. Kubad-Abad. Ruchan Ank, Qanakkale Onsekiz Mart University, director of excavations of the Seljuk pal- ace on Lake Bey§ehir near Konya reports finding in 2004 in the southern part of the palace, a bath com- plex that was used into the first half of the 14th cen- tury C.E.176 Alanya Citadel Excavations in the Seljuk palace in the Alanya Citadel in 2004 by M. Olu§ Ank discovered a sixth-century C.E. basilica and remains of a Hellenistic settlement below the 12th- to 13th-century C.E. church incorporated in the late palace. New investigations in 2005 of the so-called Seljuk Bath at the southeast sec- tion of the citadel uncovered a rectangular pool adja- cent to its north side and glazed tiles similar to those from the palace.177 Harran. Excavations directed by Nurettin Yardimci cleared the Great Mosque complex built in 744-750 C.E. by Khalif Mervan II.

Rescue excavations of the medieval settle- ment on the Silk Road between Diyarbakir and Cizre at the city of Hasankeyf in Batman province precipi- tated by the construction of the lhsu Dam revealed a 13th-century C.E. mosque with a medrese, which has a courtyard of limestone porticoes with pointed arches and an inscription stating that it was constructed by Emir Ali Bey. Abdusselam Ulucam, Selcuk University, reports that the now famous remains of the Zeynel Bey tomb were added to the complex by the Ayyubid and Akkoyunlus in the 15th century C.E., and that it was further expanded by the Ottomans in the 16th century C.E. Remains of plaster decoration including inscriptions were found, which would have decorated the walls of the first two phases of the complex. Exca- vation of another complex higher up on surrounding slopes revealed an inscribed mihrab decorated with fine stone-carving decoration featuring muquarnas and vegetal ornament dated stylistically to the 13th century C.E.180 Bitlis KalesL Kadir Pektas,, Pamukkale University, reports that his excavations in the citadel of Bitlis un- covered a medieval Turkish bath complex.

Reports on the 2004 fieldwork season presented in 2005 at the 27th symposium, hosted by Akdeniz Uni- versity in Antalya (30 May-3 June), were published in 2006.181 The reports on the 2005 season presented in 2006 at the 28th symposium, which was hosted by Qanakkale Onsekiz Mart University (29 May-2June), will not be available until the 29th symposium con- venes in 2007. In 2005, proceedings of the 14th annual symposium, "Museum Research and Salvage Excava- tions," were published with reports of work conducted by museum personnel in 2003. 182 The growth of archaeology departments and insti- tutes has led to a proliferation of symposia.183 The pro- ceedings of the first and second national symposia on archaeological research held at Ankara University in 2002 and 2003 covering all periods of antiquity were published in 2004. 184 A new symposium series of the graduate program in settlement archaeology of Mid- dle East Technical University began in 2004 (16-17 April) with a Black Sea studies symposium focusing on surveys, museum excavations, and research by young scholars on the settlement history of the Pontus and Paphlagonian regions from prehistoric to modern periods.185 This conference was partially sponsored by the British Academy Black Sea Initiative (BABSI), which organized in the same year (14-16 October) an interdisciplinary international conference, "The Black Sea Region: Past, Present, and Future," at Istan- bul Technical University with sessions on ecosystems and the natural environment, cultural, political, and socioeconomic interactions, as well as cultural and natural heritage conservation and tourism.186 There were also interdisciplinary symposia to dis- cuss eastern and northeastern Turkey.

Also notable was the first Lake Van Basin Symposium (8-10 September 2004) ,188 which was also sponsored by these two institutions in conjunction with Van YuzuncuYil University. The latter also hosted an international symposium (9-13 August 2004) on highland/lowland interaction in the Bronze Age, fo- cusing on the socioeconomic history of the region, including Georgia, Azerbaijan, Nakhichevan, Iran, and eastern Turkey. Cilicia has experienced one of the most rapid in- creases in archaeological projects. One factor has been the archaeology department founded in 1992 at Mersin University and its Research Center of Cili- cian Archaeology (Kilikia Arkeolojisini Ara§tirma Merkezi [KAAM] ) , established in 1998, which organize symposia and workshops including an international interdisciplinary workshop (7-9 April 2005) on the use of archaeological material in settlement studies. The intensity of research along the south and south- west coasts of Turkey has been sustained not only by Akdeniz University at Antalya but also the creation in 1996 in Antalya of the Suna and tnan Kirac Research Institute on Mediterranean Civilizations (Akdeniz Medeniyetleri Ara§tirma Enstitusu [AKMED]), with a library, museum, photographic and cartographic archives, and an extensive publication and lecture series.189 AKMED sponsored the Third International Symposium on Lycia (7-10 November 2005), which included more than 140 presentations covering the Paleolithic to Medieval periods.190 Convergence of the 175th anniversary of the Ger- man Archaeological Institute (DAI) with the 75th of its Istanbul branch and the 125th of its Pergamon investigations gave rise to a series of symposia, col- loquia, and workshops in 2004-2005, many of which are published in a new series (Byzas) of the Istanbul branch of the Institute. These included a symposium on the development of farming in Europe and its re- lations with Anatolia in the second half of the seventh through the first half of the sixth millennium B.C.E.,191 a workshop on the contribution of archaeology to the study of the Hittites,192 a symposium on the Red Hall at Pergamon and the archaeology of Egyptian cults in the Roman empire,193 a colloquium on the visualiza- tion of rulership in the Early Medieval period,194 and a colloquium at Pergamon that assessed the results of the research programs of the directors of excavation projects at over 25 mainly Classical to Roman period sites in western Asia Minor in light of what they had initially planned to achieve.195 An international colloquium ("Continuity or Discon- tinuity?") focusing on the Neolithic to the Iron Ages was held in Tokyo (12-15 March 2004) and included evidence of a general continuity from the Late Bronze to Iron Ages at Bogazkoy and Kaman Kalehoyuk dur- ing the Dark Ages.196 The extensive proceedings of the Fifth International Hittite Congress held in Chorum in 2002 appeared in 2005,197 the year of the Sixth Inter- national Hittite Congress, which was held in Rome (5-9 September 2005) . The Sixth Anatolian Iron Ages Symposium, also an international affair, was held at Anadolu University in Eski§ehir (16-19 August 2004) and examined many facets of the Iron Age from Ephe- sos to Van.198 The first international symposium on the oracle in antiquity and the cults of Apollo in Asia Minor, which took place in Izmir at Ege University (17-20 August 2005) , investigated the archaeology of sanctuaries and cult sites as well as oracle rituals from the Classical to Early Christian periods. The recent focus on the Persian empire of the Achaemenids199 has lead to a better understanding of Achaemenid Anatolia, which was the subject of a workshop in Istanbul (20-21 May 2005), "The Achaemenid Impact on Local Popula- tions and Cultures in Anatolia," covering the sixth to fourth centuries B.C.E. and organized by the Institu- tum Turcicum Scientiae Antiquitatis/Turk Eskicag Bilimleri Enstitusu (TEBE) and French Institute of Anatolian Studies in collaboration with the Istanbul branch of the DAI. JOURNALS AND SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Never before has information on archaeological projects in Turkey been as accessible as it is today. The Internet is the most significant catalyst for this, as proj- ects produce Web sites with extensive (and frequently updated) reports, digital images and plans, and even 188 Belli 2006a. 189 See the institute Web site at http://www.akmed.org.tr. 190 For abstracts with English, French, or German transla- tions, see Akdeniz Medeniyetleri Ara§tirma Enstitusu (AK- MED) 2005. 191 Lichter 2005; see also Yakar 2005. 192Mielkeetal.2OO6. 193 Hoffman 2005. 194 Bauer 2006. 195 Radt 2006c. 196 For discussion of the "myth" of the Dark Ages and evi- dence for continuity, see Strobel 2005. 197 Suel 2005. 198 Cilingiroglu and Sagona 2006. 199 For recent research, including Anatolia, see Briant and Boucharlat2005.</page><page sequence="68">342 B. YILDIRIM AND M.-H. GATES [AJA 111 interactive daily logs.200 The time gap between docu- mentation and final publication has been filled with this increasingly real-time feed of information ex- emplified by the newly launched Web site, "Current Archaeology in Turkey,"201 maintained by Christine Eslick, which provides up-to-date reports in Turkish and English about the entire spectrum of archaeologi- cal projects in Turkey, along with the relevant links to project Web sites. The adoption of the digital medium was apparent at the General Directorate's annual in- ternational archaeology symposium, where presenta- tions in 2005 were almost all in a digital format, while less than half were presented this way in 2004. The launching of the GIS database of the TAY Project on- line in 2004 has permitted another level of analysis of the thousands of sites it has surveyed.202 The increase in the number of archaeological proj- ects and symposia has lead to an overall increase in pub- lications. A brief listing of journals produced since 1994 by Turkish universities and institutes on archaeology in the country reveals the extent of this increase: 1. Archivum Anatolicum, a publication of TEBE, fo- cuses on the prehistoric to the Iron Age (1995). 2. Adalya, published by AKMED, focuses on the his- tory, culture, and archaeology of the region of Antalya (1996). 3. OLBA, by the archaeology department of Mersin University, covers all periods from the prehis- toric to the Medieval, focusing particularly on Cilicia(1998). 4. Turkish Academy of Sciences Journal of Archaeology (TUBA-AR) has an emphasis on the Paleolithic to Iron Ages (1998). 5. Colloquium Anatolicum, also by TEBE, mainly pub- lishes the lectures sponsored by the institute, which are predominantly on the prehistoric pe- riod to the Iron Age (2002). 6. Anadolu Akdeniz Arkeoloji Haberleri/News of Archae- ology from Anatolia's Mediterranean Areas provides timely yearly, bilingual Turkish and English reports focusing on work from Lycia to Cilicia (2003). 7. Kubaba is edited by Reyhan Korpe of Qanakkale Onsekiz Mart University (2003). 8. Anadolu/ Anatolia, of the Archaeology Department of Ankara University, was revived after a long hia- tus and covers all periods from the prehistoric to Byzantine (2003). 9. Gephyra, edited by Johannes Nolle (DAI) and Sencer §ahin (Akdeniz University), has an em- phasis on epigraphic and numismatic material of the Classical to Roman periods, which will hopefully fill a gap in publications and stimulate the development of experts and departments in those fields in Turkey (2004). 10. Arkeoloji, Anadolu ve Avrasya is produced by Do- kuz Eyliil University and its Institute of Anatolia and Eurasia supported by the Archaeological Sources of the Turkic Culture in Central Asia Project (OTAK) of the History Foundation of Turkey (2005). The Ancient Near Eastern Studies supplementary se- ries, edited by A. Sagona of Melbourne University, has produced final publications of major studies on northeastern Turkey: a study by M. McConchie203 of iron technology through examination of the Iron Age finds from Buyuktepe (Bayburt) and Sos Hoyiik (Erzurum) , and a detailed study by A. Sagona and C. Sagona on highland cultural development from the earliest times to the present, based on their survey of the Bayburt and Erzurum regions.204 Numerous studies and final publications have recently appeared on work conducted in Cilicia,205 which are indicative of the growth of investigation of the region during the past decade: a volume on colonization and acculturation of settlements of the Cilician plain;206 an extensive study of the Achaemenids in Cilicia by O. Casabonne;207 a study of the Roman and Late Roman periods on the plain of Issus byj. Tobin;208 and an extensive survey by R. Bayliss of temples converted to churches largely in the fifth century C.E.209 A fortunate development in publications of tumuli, which remain largely in the form of salvage excava- tion reports or articles, has been the monographic study by I. Delemen of the Naip tumulus discovered unplundered in 1984-1985 during rescue excavations 15 km southwest of Tekirdag in Thrace, with remark- able finds, marble furniture, and a silver sympotic set 200 See, e.g., the virtual dig of Sagalassos on Archaeology's Web site at http://www.archaeology.org/interactive/sagalassos. 201 The Web site (http://cat.une.edu.au) is operated un- der the auspices of the Anatolian Iron Age research project headed by Peter Grave and Lisa Kealhofer and hosted at the University of New England, Armidale, Australia. 202 http://www.tayproject.org/giseng.html. 203 McConchie 2004. 204 Sagona and Sagona 2004. 205 Salmeri and D'Agata 2005. 20bEhlingetal.2004. 207 Casabonne 2004; see also the review by Gates 2005b.

Cormack.211 Detailed and systematic studies of Roman and Byz- antine Lycia and Pamphylia have also appeared: H. Brandt and F. Kolb's well-illustrated publication incor- porating the results of recent studies of the region,212 and a three-volume historical geographical study by H.G. Hellenkemper and F. Hild of the Byzantine phase of the provinces of Lycia and Pamphylia as the eighth volume of the Tabula Imperii Byzantini series.213 Another welcome publication, again in three volumes, is by B. Bohlendorf-Arslan on Byzantine glazed ceramics, to be the standard reference for seventh- to 15th-century C.E. ceramics.214 The first volume of the final publication of the 11th-century C.E. shipwreck at Serce Limani has appeared.215 The wreck is one of many off the coasts of Turkey from the Bronze Age to Byzantine periods investigated by the Institute of Nautical Archaeology of Texas A&amp;M University, which are discussed in a new well-illustrated book on the history of all the institute's projects edited by its long-time director and pioneer of the field, George F. Bass.216 MUSEUM EXHIBITIONS AND CATALOGUES A lavishly illustrated catalogue on Kultepe appeared in 2005 for an exhibition in Japan sponsored by the Japanese Middle East Cultural Center.217 A major ex- hibition on Urartian culture was held in Istanbul for which a well-illustrated bilingual Turkish-English cat- alogue was produced.218 The Anatolian Civilizations Museum at Ankara continued to be the rare museum with a consistent publication series, Anadolu Medeniy- etleriMuzesi Yilhgi, mainly of research on its collections and salvage excavations in the province of Ankara. The private Sadberk Hanim Museum of the Rahmi Koc Foundation began the journal, Palmet, in 1997. Recent finds from Bogazkoy, Ortakoy-Shapinuwa, Ydruklu/ Huseyindede, and other sites in the province are now displayed in forum's elegantly redesigned museum, which opened in 2005. H. Qambel announced the in- stallation and opening in 2005 of a superb regional museum at the Karatepe archaeological park and visi- tors' center near Kozan. Exhibits display basalt sculp- ture from Iron Age Domuztepe and Karatepe (lions, bulls, another statue base with bulls like Azitawatas' outside, unfinished monuments); three rooms pre- senting a generous Neolithic to Medieval pottery se- quence from Domuztepe and elsewhere; finds from sites flooded by the nearby Ceyhan Dam (such as me- dieval Kum Kalesi); and antiquities from the region, among them a milestone from Hierapolis-Castabala. Explanatory panels throughout include information about restoration work at Karatepe proper. FESTSCHRIFTS AND MEMORIALS A large, two-volume festschrift honoring Friedrich Krinzinger, director of the Ephesos excavations of the Austrian Archaeological Institute, appeared in 2005. 219 Its first volume is dedicated to recent studies on Ephe- sos. In the same year, a festschrift for Volker Michael Strocka appeared, which contains articles on subjects from Turkey as a result of his research on architec- tural ornament and sarcophagi in Asia Minor.220 Fahri I§ik221 and Ramazan Ozgan222 received festschrifts in 2004 and 2005, respectively. They conducted doctoral studies in Germany and returned to Turkey to help establish classical archaeology departments (I§ik at Atatiirk University in Erzurum and Akdeniz University in Antalya, Ozgan at Selcuk University in Konya) and major excavations (I§ik at Patara, Ozgan at Knidos). The articles of the festchrifts reflect their interests in sculpture and sarcophagi as well as the projects they directed. The 54th volume of the Istanbuler Mit- teilungen (IstMitt) of the Istanbul branch of the DAI was dedicated in honor of Wolfgang Radt's 34 years as director of the Pergamon excavations upon his re- tirement in 2005 and contains recent studies on Per- gamon. Charles Burney, a pioneer of the study of the Urartian kingdom and the highlands in eastern Ana- tolia, Transcaucasus, and northwestern Iran, contains numerous articles on the preclassical cultures of the Neolithic to Iron Age in Anatolia.223 Archaeology in Turkey has lost some of its greatest scholars: Manfred Osman Korfmann (d. 11 August 2005), 224 who, through his directorship of Troy, trans- formed our understanding of the Bronze Age and developed the project into a major national and in- ternational collaborative enterprise, which has helped ensure the protection of the site and its environs for 210Delemen 2004, 2006. 211 Cormack 2004. 212 Brandt and Kolb 2005. 213 Hellenkemper and Hild 2004. 214 Bohlendorf-Arslan 2004. 215Bassetal.2OO4. 216 Bass 2005. 217 Ozgiic 2005. 218 Ozdem 2004. 219 Brandt etal. 2005. 220 Ganschow and Steinhart 2005. 221 Korkut 2004. 222§ahin and Mert 2005. 223 Sagona 2004. 224 Rose 2006b.</page><page sequence="70">344 B.
