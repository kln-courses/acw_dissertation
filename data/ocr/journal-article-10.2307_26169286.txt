The most  common occupant injuries in these extremely short duration events arise out of the very high vertical acceleration of  vehicle due to its close proximity to hot high pressure gases from the blast. In a prior study [16], an extensive parametric  study was conducted in a systematic manner so as to create look-up tables or automated software tools that decision- makers can use to quickly estimate the different injury responses for both stroking and non-stroking seat systems in terms  of a suitable blast load parameter. The primary objective of this paper is to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of using  such a tool in lieu of building a detailed model for simulation and occupant injury assessment.

Parametric Study A parametric study was conducted by varying the peak  acceleration from 10g-1200g, and duration of the pulse from  2.5ms to 60ms (a total of thirteen distinct duration levels) such  that Δv is varied to a maximum value of about 15 m/s. The  blast pulses with the minimum and maximum amplitudes from  these thirteen duration levels are shown in Fig 7. In addition to  a rigid seat without an energy-absorbing (EA) mine blast  feature, two other generic EA blast mine seats of different  ratings (EA1, EA2) were also used in the study (Fig 8). As may  be observed from the figure, both EA seats have the same  amount of stroke, but EA2 is softer in that it strokes at a lower  limiting force level than EA1. Fig 5.

REDUCED ORDER MODELS (ROM) /  INJURY LOOK-UP TABLE Three different Reduced Order Modeling approaches to  construct injury look-up tables with increasing levels of fidelity  and thereby accuracy are described below. Approach #1 (Single Parameter) Using the linear/quadratic regression equations resulting from  this parametric study, occupant injuries for any triangular- shaped pulse can be easily computed. As an example, Figure  10 shows one such occupant injury, viz., Head acceleration  2ms clip vs. Δv. Fig 9.

One limitation of this approach is that if a  single simple relationship for the entire range of pulses and Approach #3: (Response Surface Metamodel) durations of interest considered in this study were to be  constructed, it would result in significant error.
