<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lawrence, Words worth and 'Anthropomorphic Lust' IN JUNE 1925 THE AMERICAN critic Stuart Sherman published in the book section of the New York Herald Tribune an essay entitled, 'Lawrence cultivates his beard ' After reviewing Lawrence's critical fortunes from the time Sons and Lovers had caught Henry James's jaundiced eye in 'The New Novel' (1914), Sherman decided that what made Lawrence distinctive was his 'marvellous awareness of life in nature'. This was especially the case because, unlike Wordsworth who 'saturated nature with purely human emotions', Lawrence did not 'taint the air with human preconceptions and "pathetic fallacies" '.* The general level of critical commentary on Lawrence in 1925 was not high but Sherman's was higher than most. Since beggars can't be choosers, and although it would hardly have delighted Lawrence to be told yet again that nature descriptions were what he did best, he wrote to inform Sherman on 11th July that he always liked to hear what he had to say 'because you do care about the deeper implications in a novel. Damn "holiday reading"!' The second purpose of the letter was to ask Sherman, who edited the Herald Tribune's book section, whether there would be any interest in two short articles which he had just written and which are now known as 'Art and Morality' and 'Morality and the Novel'. Sherman did not take the articles for his newspaper but in November and December of that year they were published in England in the Calendar of Modern Letters where, through the agency of figures such as F. R. Leavis, their striking concepts and formulations played a significant role in the development of what was later to become known as 'Cambridge English'. One such formulation is the definition of morality as 1 Sherman's essay is reprinted in vol. 1 of D. H. Lawrence: Critical Assessments , ed. Ellis and De Zordo, pp. 497-503.</page><page sequence="2">LAWRENCE, WORDSWORTH AND 'AN THROPOMORPHIC LUST' 231 that delicate, forever trembling and changing balance between me and my circumambient universe, which precedes and accompanies a true relatedness. . . . Morality in the novel is the trembling instability of the balance. When the novelist puts his thumb in the scale, to pull down the balance to his own predilection, that is immorality. This occurs in the second article which begins The business of art is to reveal the relation between man and his circumambient universe, at the living moment.2 Man's relationship with the surrounding world was a major preoccupation of Lawrence's at this time as he began writing the six essays which would shortly appear in book form under the title of one of them: Reflections on the Death of a Porcupine'. It was not so much now relations with the opposite sex which interested him, but how to live satisfactorily with the natural and above all animal world. The female protagonist of the essay he called '. . . Love Was Once a Little Boy' is less Frieda than a black cow called Susan which he had recently acquired. In discussing the difficulty of relating to her, Lawrence seized eagerly on Sherman's suggestion that Wordsworth made the mistake of saturating nature 'with purely human emotion'. This is what characters in the films of the '50s and '60s tried to persuade us Americans called a 'bum steer'; but it was a suggestion too much in accord with Lawrence's current preoccupations and prejudices to be ignored. The publisher's original idea for Reflections was that it should consist almost entirely of previously published pieces. It was with this in mind that on 15th July Lawrence wrote to David Jester at the Centaur Bookshop in Philadelphia and asked him to send a few of the essays, like the one on ťLove'. I think I would rather revise them a good deal: perhaps re- write them.3 Jester must have been holding a copy of 'Love' which had been published in the English Review in January 1918. '. . . Love Was Once a Little Boy' is a rewriting of it only in the sense that the first two pages implicitly undermine the position Lawrence had adopted in the earlier essay. In the later war years Lawrence was a believer in Birkin' s dialectical solution 2 See 'Morality and the Novel', ' Study of Thomas Hardy' and Other Essays , cd.

Lawrence , vol. 5, eds Boulton and Vascy, p. 279.</page><page sequence="3">232 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY to the problem of how, in a relationship with a woman, a man can both surrender himself and retain his own being. In the fire of ' extreme sensual love', he writes in 'Love', in the friction of intense, destructive flames, I am destroyed and reduced to essentiality: she is destroyed and reduced to her essential otherness. It is a destructive fire, this profane love. But it is the only fire that will purify us into singleness, fuse us from the chaos into our own unique gem-like separateness of being.4 Seven years on, Lawrence no longer believes that sexual love can be the royal way to an intensified individuality. Adopting in the later essay the somewhat wearily commonsensical, 'You have to balance love and individuality, and actually sacrifice a portion of each', he writes, Most of our talk about love is cant, and bunk. The treasure of treasures to man and woman today is his own, or her own ego. And this ego, each hopes it will flourish like a salamander in the flame of love and passion. Which it well may: but for the fact there are two salamanders in the same flame, and they fight till the flame goes out. Then they become grey cold lizards of the vulgar ego. ( Reflections p. 332) Having dealt with human love relationships in his first two pages, and to some extent therefore with his relationship to Frieda, Lawrence turns with evident relief to his 'black cow Susan'. The beauty of his descriptions of Susan indicates how important it is to him to establish a satisfactory relationship with her, as with all the other manifestations of 'nature' on the ranch in New Mexico where he was living. Lawrence describes how in the morning, at milking time, he often has to search for Susan among the timber where 'possibly she is lying peacefully in cowy inertia, like a black Hindu statue, among the oak-scrub'. Sometimes she has disappeared into the bottom corner of the field and can be found there, 'lowing sotto voce and blindly to some far-off, inaccessible bull. Then when I call at her, and approach, she screws round her tail and flings her sharp, elastic haunches in the air with a kick and a flick, and plunges off like a buck rabbit, or like a black demon among the pine trees, her udder swinging like a chime of bells' . On still other occasions she has to be looked for on horseback and is discovered amongst the trees 'her ears apart, standing like some 4 See ' Reflections on the Death of a Porcupine * and Other Essays , ed. Michael Herbert, p. 10.</page><page sequence="4">LAWRENCE, WORDSWORTH AND 'ANTHROPOMORPHIC LUST' 233 spider suspended motionless by a thread, from the web of the eternal silence'. Establishing a relationship with an animal like this is very difficult but Lawrence feels that he has succeeded in doing so: 'There is a sort of a relation between us. And this relation is part of the mystery of love: the individuality on each side, mine and Susan's, suspended in the relationship' ( Reflections pp. 333-4). If only intermittently, he and Susan have achieved a 'true relatedness', contrived to meet in that third realm which, in 'Morality and the Novel', Lawrence had described as also the home of the genuine work of art, the work of art (that is) which is neither . Van Gogh's perception of the sunflowers nor the sunflowers 'themselves', but 'a revelation of a perfected relation, at a certain moment, between a man and a sunflower.'5 Recognition of his success with Susan leads Lawrence to recall Sherman's allusion to Wordsworth's failures. He remembers from school (as either a pupil or a teacher) the famous lines about Peter Bell for whom, 'A primrose by the river's brim/ A yellow primrose was to him/ And nothing more'; and assumes that it was Wordsworth's intention to contrast Peter's indifference to the natural world with the solipsistic quality of his own attention: 'The yokel had no relation at all -or next to none -with the primrose. William gathered it to his bosom and made it part of his own nature'. Warming to his theme, and after having made his own contribution to the long list of parodies of Peter Bell , he complains a page later, 'Ah William! The "something more" that the primrose was to you, was yourself in the mirror'. Towards the end of '. . . Love Was Once a Littíe Boy' , he returns to the issue once more and lights on the striking if misapplied phrase of my title: 'So a man can go forth in desire, even to a primrose. But let him refrain from falling all over the poor blossom, as William did. Or trying to incorporate it in his own ego, which is a sort of lust. Nasty anthropomorphic lust' ( Reflections pp. 334, 336, 443). ♦ ♦ ♦ Why is it that Lawrence feels he can speak with such authority on the anthropomorphic lust which is only one manifestation of a man's desire to make the world a mere extension of self? The simplest answer is perhaps that it takes one to think he knows one. Throughout the early poetry there are moments when Lawrence's own presence is either implicitly obtrusive 5 ' Study of Thomas Hardy' and Other Essays , p. 171. Invoking the fashionable jargon of the day, Lawrence in fact describes Van Gogh's encounter as taking place in the 'fourth dimension' .</page><page sequence="5">234 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY in an uncomfortable way or, as in this stanza from the original version of ťThe Wild Common', explicitly so: Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air, Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad. And the soul of the wind and my blood compare Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in liberty, drifts on and is sad. ( Complete Poems ed. da Sola Pinto &amp; Roberts p. 895) Verse like this is in part no more than a reminder of the stylistic mannerisms any young writer is likely to inherit; but since Lawrence had some choice in the matter, it is partly indicative of a state of mind: one in which the observer and what he observes are unpleasandy intermingled and seven larks seem to have taken a collective decision to sing in unison for his sole benefit. To have been able to move from what a stanza like this represents to the triumph of Birds , Beasts and Flowers , was a great achievement. This is not because, at a fundamental level, the poems in that collection are any the less 'anthropomorphic'. Since language is a uniquely human attribute, 'nature' has always to be described in human terms. But what nearly all its critics have celebrated is the successful struggle that goes on in Birds, Beasts and Flowers to acknowledge the gulf between the human and natural worlds; and to both recognize and respect that the latter has a life independent of the meaning-conferring power of human beings. Lawrence's tendency to overflow his own boundaries and saturate his surroundings with his own feelings is also apparent of course in numerous descriptive passages from the early novels. Together with the verse, these provide literary-critical support for what emerges as the main thesis of volume 1 of the new Cambridge biography. As John Worthen shows on numerous occasions, Lawrence was a man of acute self-consciousness as well as vivid imagination. He quickly came not only to understand but also to be seriously alarmed by his own solipsism (to employ that convenient but perhaps here not always entirely appropriate or sufficiendy comprehensive technical term); and began consciously to seek out situations which would challenge it. This is a fact which seems to be central to any study of his work, although recognising it as such is difficult since both Lawrencean solipsism and his fear of it manifest themselves in so many different forms. In contrast to the Romantics, solipsism is most important to Lawrence in the sphere of love, not of 'nature' but of other human beings (in which</page><page sequence="6">LAWRENCE, WORDSWORTH AND 'ANTHROPOMORPHIC LUST' 235 case of course the 'lust' it is likely to engender can no longer qualify as anthropomorphic). This is especially because the only alternative he can often see to incorporation - making the other person a part or adjunct of himself - is being incorporated (either drinking in or being drunk, as Wordsworth might have put it). Even as late as The Plumed Serpent he has Don Ramón complain, 'But which woman can I meet in the body, without that slow degradation of ravishing or being ravished, setting in?'6 The terms have changed but the alternatives are essentially the same. To move in either direction increasingly came to seem to him deathly. The deathliness of being incorporated is obvious enough since it involves a surrender of personal identity and hence (at least partly) all those protests against devouring women in Lawrence's work. It is I think to Lawrence's credit that he is almost equally fearful of deathliness in the other direction: of the fact that it is only in relation to the other that identity can be established and that therefore to exist alone in the world is not really to exist at all. In the later criticisms of 'merging' in his Whitman essays, he makes no particular distinction between the phenomenon of incorporation in its active or passive forms, and strongly deprecates both. They are both ways of affirming that oneself and the world are at one and complementary aspects therefore of a detested idealism. How strongly Lawrence's nature had led him to feel about the more easily recognisable of these two aspects is evident from a poem in Look ! We Have Come Through! which is remarkable, not for its use of language, but for the feelings it expresses. At the beginning of 'New Heaven and Earth' the speaker confesses, I was so weary of the world, I was so sick of it, everything was tainted with myself, skies, trees, flowers, birds, water, people, houses, streets, vehicles, machines, nations, armies, war, peace-talking, work, recreation, governing, anarchy, it was all tainted with myself, I knew it ail to start with because it was all myself. ( Complete Poems p. 256) What has rescued him from this self-enclosure is putting out his hand one night and touching 'that which was verily not me'. 6 The Plumed Serpent , ed. L. D. Clark, p. 274.</page><page sequence="7">236 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY It was the flank of my wife I touched with my hand, I clutched with my hand, rising, new- awakened from the tomb! It was the flank of my wife Whom I married years ago at whose side I have lain for over a thousand nights and all that previous while, she was I, she was I; I touched her, it was I who touched and I who was touched. {Complete Poems p. 260) There is a persona in Look!, or rather a variety of personae, but everything we know about Lawrence encourages us to read these remarkably bald statements autobiographically. If it took Lawrence a thousand nights to be properly convinced that Frieda was indeed someone else, no wonder he felt qualified to detect in other people a habit of mind which is so solipsistically appropriating, or turned so fiercely denunciatory when he thought he had detected it. The way in which, in Women in Love , Rupert Birkin meets the difficulties Lawrence felt were to be found in all relations with the opposite sex is through the doctrine of ' stellar polarity'. In his essay 'Love' this was articu- lated rather differently than in the novel since there Lawrence begins by giving the names 'sacred* and 'profane' to the respective yielding and hard aspects of love (Blake's pebble and his clod of clay). As my previous quo- tation from the essay indicated, it is only in 'profane love' that there is that burning down into 'gem-like singleness, distinct and apart from all the rest, proud as a lion, isolated as a star' ( Reflections p. 11). One of several puzzles then is why, having gone through this process, either of the two partners would want or need to go through it again. What is the nature of the need the two star-like souls continue to have of each other that can hold them suspended in the upper atmosphere in electromagnetic unison? There are answers to this question, as there are to all literary enquiries of a similar kind, but they have never struck me as very satisfactory. By 1925 they were no longer satisfactory to Lawrence either and he was denouncing as an illusion the notion that individual identity could be heightened through love, on a continuing basis at least. The crucial new words are 'balance', 'equi- poise', 'equilibrium' which no longer suggest what had previously been implied by polarity and all of which Lawrence is now happier invoking in relation to Susan than Frieda. Wordsworth emerges as the villain of the piece because Sherman has incited Lawrence to see in him an Establishment version of his younger self, or someone who might, if only very indirecdy, be made partly responsible for that younger self because of the powerful influence on Lawrence's early writings of the Romantic tradition.</page><page sequence="8">LAWRENCE, WORDSWORTH AND 'ANTHROPOMORPHIC LUST' 237 * * * Yet of course Wordsworth's disapproval of Peter Bell's indifference to the primrose is not at all a sign of his own, anthropomorphic lust. That the pedlar should have no feeling for his surroundings intrigues and challenges Wordsworth because (like himself) Peter has lived with and been moulded by Nature: 4 His face was keen as is the wind /That cuts along the hawthorn fence'.7 The difference is that whereas Nature has been for Wordsworth a nurse and the soul of all his moral being etc., she has imparted to Peter only her savage aspects and left him morally blank. He is brought back into the moral fold by a series of happenings which might be described as either accidental or the work of Providence. The light ballad form cunningly discourages the reader from dwelling on the difference; but the poem is too good in every respect to evade all its philosophical responsibilities. (If one were looking for explanations as to why Peter Bell has enjoyed so less good a press than its near- contemporary, The Ancient Mariner , the candidates might include: the circumstances surrounding its publication; a degraded public taste for Gothic sensationalism; and Wordsworth's own great talent - which Lawrence certainly did not share - for presenting what was original but cilso peculiar about himself in the guise of the ordinary and everyday.) Wordsworth believes that the transforming powers of the mind, especially in their more frightening aspects, provide people with experiences which are crucial to their moral development. But in that case why is it, he asks (only half-jocularly), that men like himself, who are in no particular need of a fearful imagination, are so liberally provided with one while it is withheld from the likes of Peter Bell? The comparison with himself is relevant since close to the origin of Peter's moral regeneration is a sight to which, in The Prelude , Wordsworth attributes great importance for his own growing sense of the world: a drowned man lifted up from the water. His own memory is of how the corpse 'bolt upright / Rose with his ghastly face, a spectre shape'.8 In 'Peter Bell' the pedlar pulls on the stick which has become entwined in the hair of the body under the water until, The man who had been four days dead, Head-foremost from the river's bed Uprises -like a ghost!

This and subsequent quotations are taken from the Norton Critical Edition of the poem, eds Wordsworth, Abrams and Gill.</page><page sequence="9">238 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY Strictly speaking, the transformation in Peter begins just before this moment, after he has been beating the dead man's faithful ass. The animal's 'long and clamorous bray' sends an echo into the rocks which disturbs his habitual sense of the world, that sense in which - up until then - a primrose has only ever been for him a mere primrose, The moon uneasy look' d and dimmer, The broad blue heavens appear'd to glimmer, And the rocks stagger 'd all around. (P-87) This is the first of a series of assaults on Peter's perceptions to which his previous life has made him unusually and cunningly resistant, so resistant in fact that, in exasperation at the slowness of Peter's reformation, Wordsworth is moved to interrupt his tale at the beginning of 'Part Third' and tell the story of a ' gentle Soul' who was one day reading a pious book when his taper seemed to go out. Plunged in darkness, he then saw that the taper's light had transferred itself to the book's pages and formed there a word which 'till his dying day . . . / Perplexed the good man's gentle soul'; but which he later felt ('poor gentle wight!') had been instrumental in bringing many of his hidden sins to light. This moves the author of the nineteenth century's most impressive theodicy to the mildly humorous and impatient enquiry (the invocation is to the 'Spirits of the Mind'), Dread Spirits! to torment the good Why wander from your course so far, Disordering colour form and stature! - Let good men feel the soul of Nature, And see things as they are. (p. 119) Unlike Peter Bell, good men do not need to be terrified into behaving properly: they should be allowed to 'see things as they are', as Peter himself has the opportunity of doing when, soon after his initial fright, the heavens have stopped glimmering and the mountains no longer stagger. Steady the moon doth look and clear, And like themselves the rocks appear, And tranquil are the skies. (p. 89) No-one would suggest that 'things as they are' and 'rocks like themselves' must be synonyms in Wordsworth for a brute materiality imposed upon a passive observer. True vision is for him most commonly</page><page sequence="10">LAWRENCE, WORDSWORTH AND 'ANTHROPOMORPHIC LUST' 239 related to an ideal of the mind as 'creator and receiver both, / Working but in alliance with the works/ Which it beholds' ( Prelude , II. 273-5). It is this rather than solipsism in any of its various, early Lawrencean forms which could most fairly be contrasted to Peter's insensibility as regards the primrose, or to the hallucinatory transformations of a mind beset by guilt or fear. With its emphasis on give-and-take, its insistence that in any encounter with the world outside (perceptual or otherwise), what one brings should neither overwhelm nor be overwhelmed by what is presumed to be on offer, it corroborates rather than contradicts those notions of relationship Lawrence is struggling to define in the 1925 essays. It can and has been argued that Wordsworth does not always practise what he preached and that, despite his creator/receiver formula, he often gives an undue weight to the creative side of the equation, especially when (in The Prelude) fear is not involved and doing so allows him to maintain his precarious hold on an optimistic view of the world and his own place in it. On those occasions he may well be what Sherman claims he always and uniquely is: 4 an interpreter of the contemplative minď . But there is also in him an obstinate realism which usually, or at least often, inhibits the slide into a private world. Lawrence once said that the 'Immortality Ode' was one of the poems which had meant the most to him in his life;9 but in that case he either had not read or he had forgotten the famous note. The gate which Wordsworth there remembers having to grasp as a young boy fulfils the same function for him as Frieda's 'flank' does for Lawrence: it saves him from the 'abyss of idealism'.10 If Lawrence had known or remembered this note in 1925 he might not have written so unsympathetically of the 'Immortality Ode"s author. Just as much as himself, Wordsworth was alarmed by his own tendency to solipsism and understood its complicated relations to death (as well as madness). The new world he discovers in Book XII of The Prelude - like Lawrence's his work is also pervaded with images of resurrection - is fit to be transmitted and made visible to others because it has as its base, That whence our dignity originates, That which both gives it being, and maintains A balance, an ennobling interchange Of action from within and from without: The excellence, pure spirit, and best power, Both of the object seen, and eye that sees. (XII. 371-9) 9 See 'Hymns in a Man's Life', Phoenix //, eds Moore and Roberts, p. 597. 10 See The Poems , vol. 1, ed. John O. Hayden, p. 978.</page><page sequence="11">240 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY Lawrence might have complained that there is, as usual with the Romantics, and despite the fine passage in The Prelude on the ť despotism of the eye', too much emphasis here on sight; but the 'balance' he advocates in such different terms in '. . . Love Was Once a Little Boy' is none the less a close relation of Wordsworth's 'ennobling interchange'. * » * To suggest a strong affinity between Wordsworth and Lawrence might seem like pushing at an open door. Lawrence has after all very often been regarded as a late Romantic: someone who by developing his own, highly distinctive versions of characteristic Romantic attitudes helped to keep them lively in a period when high literary art began to be dominated by so-called modernism. This view finds support in the kinds of things Lawrence would say about composition (T am doing a novel which I have never grasped. Damn its eyes, there I am at page 145, and I've no notion what it's about'), or literary form ('And even while [Thomas Mann] has a rhythm in style, his work has none of the rhythm of the living thing').11 But the affiliations which remarks like these suggest are vague and general whereas the affinity with Wordsworth strikes me as highly specific, more a matter of personal temperament than of a common literary approach. Both writers clearly revelled in the power of their imaginations to create an autonomous world but both were also alarmed by the implications of that power and needed periodic reassurance that there was something out there besides themselves. Lawrence, especially, had to feel the presence of the other - animate or (as neither he nor Wordsworth would in fact have put it) inanimate; and he needed to be reassured that by achieving harmony with the environment he had not reduced it to himself. This aspect of his make-up helps to explain why, as he sat in the ranch above Taos writing his Reflections on the Death of a Porcupine, the New Mexican landscape had come to mean so much to him. What so impressed him was its resistance to being taken over, made domestic. This is the quality he describes at length in the strange ending to St. Mawr where his primary interest is not in the New England woman's failure to make what is obviously the Lawrences' own ranch pay , but in her unavailing efforts to reduce it to a state where it can be taken for granted. In the essay which contains the famous phrase, 'I think New Mexico was the greatest 11 See Letters , vol. 1, ed. James T. Boulton, p. 544, and Phoenix, ed. Edward D. McDonald, p. 313.</page><page sequence="12">LAWRENCE, WORDSWORTH AND 'ANTHROPOMORPHIC LUST' 241 experience from the outside world I have ever had', Lawrence remarks: 'Leo Stein once wrote to me: It is the most aesthetically satisfying landscape I know. To me it was much more than that. It had a splendid silent terror'.12 Terror was important to inhibit that slide into feelings of at-oneness with the environment which Romain Rolland had called 'oceanic' and which Freud then very tentatively associated with the baby's experience at the mother's breast.13 Certain passages in the early part of Wordsworth's Prelude might suggest that on this occasion Freud was offering an important insight, and he receives further support from analogues to those passages in Lawrence's psychology books.14 The similarities between the two indicate how important it might be for an understanding of Wordsworth and Lawrence's approach to landscape that they were both such experts on the seductions and perils of regression. As I have said elsewhere, it is possible to imagine many novelists writing the disturbing scene towards the end of Lady Chatterley's Lover in which Clifford begins to fondle and kiss Mrs Bolton's breasts, but only someone in whom the regressive instincts were very strong could have written it with such venom.15 Wordsworth had been an explorer in characteristically Lawrencean territory well before Lawrence's time and he had developed a highly effective personal vocabulary for the discussion of very similar preoccupations and anxieties. It is hard to think who amongst all Lawrence's other nineteenth-century predecessors could have been more helpful and encouraging on his central concern. Yet apart from the tribute to the 'Immortality Ode', references to Wordsworth in Lawrence's work are sparse and unenthusiastic, more I suspect as a consequence of lack of information than of positive dislike. The attack on Peter Bell in '. . . Love Was Once a Little Boy' occurs because Lawrence's knowledge is limited ('Ignorance, madam, pure ignorance'); but also because Stuart Sherman, a professor of English as well as a literary journalist, had given him a tip on which he felt he could rely. In the Introduction to Fantasia of the Unconscious , the second of the two psychology books (despite Penguin's irritating habit of printing them as if it were the first), Lawrence writes, 'I am no "scholar" of any sort. But I am very grateful to scholars for their sound work. I have found hints, suggestions for what I say here in 12 4 New Mexico', Phoenix , p. 143. 13 See 'Civilisation and its Discontents', vol. 12 in the Penguin Freud, ed.
