Methodical denial can easily harden into dogmatic denial; on the other hand, an apparently dogmatic denial may in fact conceal an implicit affirmation of God: false gods are always present, and the true God is always possible. What must especially be emphasized—because we can hardly resolve a problem if we haven't properly located it—is the new and actual significance of atheism. It has often been pointed out without showing the reason for it: God today is present everywhere and is being denied everywhere—he has never been the theme for so many plays and films, and this occurs at the very moment when the denial of God is most widely propa gated. This is because God is not sim ply an intellectual problem—we are dealing here with the very meaning of life. It is a fact that our political and economic choices today are made for or against God. Proudhon was not wrong: God is indeed involved at the center of Contradictions Economiques. We are at the point where metaphysics includes politics and economics. Whether we regret this or whether we rejoice in it, it is also at this level that ultimate problems must be taken up and exam ined.10 Translated by Joseph Ε. Cunneen Thus Carrel explains that his experience as surgeon and doctor, his studies of the regenera tion of tissues and cicatrization of wounds have helped him appreciate "the curative effects of prayer." "When prayer becomes habitual and really fervent, its influence becomes very great, like that of the endocrine glands. The sense of the sacred would seem to have an analogy with the need for oxygen, and prayer has a respiratory function. Man needs God like he needs water and oxygen." (quotations from Carrel, Prayer) 2. At least if we take the word in its precise present-day meaning and not as a synonym for the reason (causa sive ratio) of Spinoza, for example. 3. For Brunschvicg this would mean that the God of historic Christianity could not be the true God. We understand this phrase in the sense that the representation of a God in whose name war was waged could only be a falsified and perverted representation. 4. F. Dubarle, O.P.: Scientific humanism and Christian thought, Blackfriars, 195 5. 5. Of course Marx wrote that atheism ought to be surmounted. But this only means that so cialism considers the non-existence of God as established, and from then on could start out concretely from the existence of man. In Poli tical Economy and Philosophy, he writes: "From the fact that man has in practice become visible in nature, it has become practically impossible to ask if there exists a foreign being, a being placed above nature and man—this question im plying the non-essentiality of nature and man. Atheism, in as much as it is a denial of this non-essentiality, no longer has meaning, for atheism is a denial of God and by this denial of God affirms the existence of man. But so cialism as such no longer needs this mediation; it begins with the awareness, both in theory and practice of man's presence in nature con sidered as being." 6. Cf.

I say also, because it is obvious that the direct testimony of what is most abruptly transcendant is always legitimate and necessary; the prophetic vocation and mystical experience are eternal data of Christianity. By trying to clarify one aspect of reality, we do not wish to deny others.</page></plain_text>
