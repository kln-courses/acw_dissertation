To p. 9, note 20: Leiden MS Warner 3, fol. 452a, differs here from the selection based on the Firkowicz MS and printed in Pinsker's LikkutW Kadmoniyoth. The fact that the printed version from which our English translation was prepared concludes each excerpt with an "etc." only, without indicating the extent of editorial omis- sions, makes the comparison difficult indeed. Thus, there is no way of checking, whether the text available in the Leiden MS and missing in Pinsker's edition was deliberately left out by Firkowicz or did not exist in the Russian MS in the first place. At any rate, the St. Petersburg MS seems all along superior to the copy of the Leiden Library. There is also a very important line printed in LikkutM which is simply missing in the Leiden version. The clause thereafter is also corrupt. In the present note the full text of the Hebrew quotation will be given. The sections omitted by Pinsker (or Firkowicz) from the Russian MS will be supplied here on the basis of the Leiden copy and put in brackets, whereas the words missing in the Leiden MS and given by Pinsker will appear in capital letters: oln~rwan 1n3w1 14? -IIVY3 kn mr.1 ;.,mpnn n10I 'vbt lbtn p-1hnn mml .mlyz I-po' Crin 1 J I r .71nnn In npy l ran It 7m aqn-n ril " 17 ] 'Iml niN In "D .2"o 'ton r'mnloll',' .l3boD umliny i'nul lmrI orm:' wNoVn i Cli`?yl .?hz 'z-1 01ran' 115?1 . 3,In5 ,, m9 ,5,= 'Dy 43 unrn, .?nly-V 7"'lr" Wl VOW2 -IM 6M"Ml .'1)1 Jl1-I ID n 011-1c r -10mN ipul vz .-Tnm -p~n ?y 1?in -inim vnvorn npvo w 1'm r int n bt t41</page><page sequence="2">178 ANKORI [601 .NI lnw 71Y Zvi xpv) -.Ignnn Inm .0nim 11y:11 cny i?1-i, tn1 Ip3' o1I7 D73 y ni . The gist of the section omitted by Firkowicz and offered here from the Leiden MS is that while both branches of Jewry have sinned, the sin of the Karaites is smaller than that of the Rabbanites. Yet, their indiscriminate following of Rabbanite customs delays salvation to which they would have otherwise been entitled. In spite of this indictment, the author concludes on a hopeful note and predicts redemption of both Jewish factions. The condition for Divine reconciliation with Israel is the wholehearted and sincere repentance of both Karaites and Rabbanites. Cf. MS Leiden, loc. cit.

To pp. 9 f. and note 21: The thesis (in which I followed Poznanski) that Tobias ben Moses was the first among Karaite scholars to use the term ha'atakah seems to be inaccurate. Already Sahl ben Maslialb, the tenth-century Karaite polemicist in Palestine, discussed the concept in his Epistle. Cf. Pinsker, LikkutM Kadmoniyoth, App. III, 34: D', nm .(n ' w"ntw) 3yinn nw- ~'7y 'm-r) n ,rt11 011013101"1 O mNwmn 1 ,07 ,7'? n.I?Onnl norw n 01yn "IM PIX ,"n 001 nm n- pnym wirn ?NwW, -Tin-= nnn O mpnY3n"I Orl?numn a'2m111 '2D0T 001 Dfl I N '2 '2 E3TK iDn ' Dt 1 awD1l3310710 ?x ... t0o= N1. Likewise, the sources offered by Harkavy in support of Rabbanite authorship of ha'atakah are all too late. They belong to the early days of Hai Gaon, i. e. a decade or two after Sahl. Unless we revise our concept altogether and consider ha'atakah as an originally Karaite principle of jurisprudence, we shall have to assume that the Rabbanites used it in Palestine before the 970's. A study of the full manuscript-version of</page><page sequence="3">[61] KARAITE-RABBANITE RELATIONS IN BYZANTIUM 179 Tobias' hitherto unpublished Osar Ne.mad (Bodleian MS 290) convinced me that the Hebrew term ha'atakah, the equivalent of the Arabic nakl, was contributed by Hebrew translations of Sa'adyah's commentaries. These must have surely been intro- duced in the early post-Saadyan era as part of an intensified anti-Karaite campaign. While it is difficult to decide whether the term was actually coined then for the first time or merely used from that time on in greater profusion, the connection between its appearance in Karaite literature and the Saadyan polemic against sectarianism seems beyond doubt. Thus, Tobias ben Moses employed the term and its kindred grammatical forms mainly when quoting Sa'adyah and when discussing Sa'adyah's ideas on the history of scholarly transmission. Cf. Tobias' Osar Nebmad, Bodleian MS 290, fol. 6a: nTrpo 'lm ?y -N,7 1an6 Il4 (mpl~nm , ny, m :i. e.) nz-n nr ntrnm 'm 4:3 ,ninn, ("nlon' :read) , [mon] InpCnp. also the l70,Dngt .[=sn]us In orn folt 17r7vv -1y n' 9y' -71i1 "D nvm" 'm ' - 7:17,m -12- 7 y rrwl j1v7Az In ID 94nb f r= a in man~ mr.

Cf. also the lengthy discussion on fols. 94b ff. and in many more passages throughout the MS which cannot possibly be all quoted here. In at least one connection Tobias uses also the expression ansh? ha-ha'atakah, "adherents of transmission." The Arabic equivalent of ha'atakah is men- tioned alongside of the Hebrew term in the hitherto unpublished Sefer ham-Miswoth of Levi ben Yefeth. Cf. Leiden MS Warner 22, fol. 75b: 'p'K nrpnyrrm. In brief: the impression is gained that Hebrew translations of Sa'adyah's exegetic works, or at least the polemical sections thereof, were circulating in Palestine among Rabbanites and Karaites alike. It is from these (mid-</page><page sequence="4">180 ANKORI [62] tenth-century?) Hebrew-Saadyan texts that the term ha'atakah found its way into the compositions of Sa'adyah's successors and into the writings of his Karaite opponents as well. - My initially very cautious suggestion of the existence of Hebrew translations of Sa'adyah's Arabic commentaries had now been borne out by a Saadyanic student. I have it on the authority of my learned friend, Doctor M. Zucker, that some forty leaves of such a Hebrew version have indeed been yielded this summer during his search in the Genizah treasures of the Cambridge University Library. We shall have to await the publication of the fragment in order to ascertain whether it contains the term ha'atakah and the necessary data for determining the time of the translation. At any rate, the extant leaves belong to Sa'adyah's commentary on the Leviticus section of the Pentateuch to which precisely Tobias' Osar Nezmad is also devoted. - While it is obvious now that Tobias ben Moses was not the first Karaite to use the term ha'atakah, it was he who first established its specific legal applica- tions and gave it the novel twist which was symbolic of the evolution of Karaite legislation in Byzantium. Originally, the term was argued by Palestinian Karaites to mean literally "transmission (of the written tradition)," as against the Rab- banite stress on oral transmission. Thus, Sahl ben Masliah. in the text cited above refers under ha'atakah to the post-Mosaic portions of the Jewish Bible "which all Jewry accepts as true." In the course of time, however, Byzantine-Karaite texts claimed it as closely related - indeed, synonymous - with the earlier terminology denoting consensus. Such close kinship, if not outright synonymy, is already partly implied in the wording of Tobias in Osar Nebmad, Bodleian MS 290, fol. 95b: ' 1 m n1 'z And again further on, fol. 97a: p' -n,1 ',~in',n r- flK mn- In ... an i 'inmr. Especially the terms ha'atakah and yerushshah appear very frequently together. Thus, the trend of equating the above terms, finally formulated by Hadassi (see p. 11, note 24, of our study), had its roots in the legal doctrine of Tobias ben Moses.</page><page sequence="5">[63] KARAITE-RABBANITE RELATIONS IN BYZANTIUM 181 3. To pp. 9 f. and note 22: The study of the full manuscript-version of Tobias' Osar Ne mad permits us in the case of .abbalah, too, to move back the date of the earliest Karaite use of the term by some hundred years. It was not Hadassi but Tobias ben Moses who first referred to kabbalah as a legal concept corresponding to ha'atakah. Cf. in the quotation given from fol. 95b of Osar Ne mad in our previous note. Cf. also Osar Nezmad, fol. 17b: -ini nir ,t ,nMp 7 1n iprn bt ,1 'bnn. And on fol. 35b: 'rinvan nm ... rn~bI npp rt 'D wwtp Qon5 In' ansy pli n ptp. And further, fol. 90b: m9nn nn t rln nopm n7onn m;n: ,uc ntry n nn 'tN. The same phrase is repeated on fols. 93b f. Cf. also Sefer ham- Miswoth of Levi ben Yefeth, translated into Hebrew by the eleventh-century school of Tobias ben Moses in Byzantium, Leiden MS Warner 22, fol. 16b: inun ~ -r "I ,nnn i'i 11 ... n-t i Tpn~mn . 4. To pp. 17 f. and note 38: The expression haggadoth which appears twice in our excerpt, copied from the brief fragment reproduced by Frankl, misled me into inferring that the Karaites concentrated their attacks especially on the anthropomorphic aggadoth in Rabbinical litera- ture. The study of the entire text in the Bodleian MS of O.ar Ne mad made me realize that in the broader context of the work the expression haggadoth means simply presentations. While the conclusion reached there is corroborated by other material and consequently valid, the supporting evidence of the text quoted in our note 38 will have to be dropped and the English translation on p. 17 corrected accordingly. 5. To p. 34 and note 76: A similar case occurred in the year 1061 C. E. This we gather from the date of a kethubbah published by Mann, Texts and Studies, II, 173 f. (App. IV). The marriage-contract was issued</page><page sequence="6">182 ANKORI [641 at Fust.t in 1062 on the ninth day of what was to the Karaites the eleventh month of Shebat. The Rabbanites, so it is reported, considered it the month of Adar: i' Nmirv l 'w'ommrr n ,nxv ync awn" nDD6 a'~roI tlOiU ni1m D mr l w'Nm. Obviously, in the previous spring the Karaites sighted the Abib a month later than the Rabbanite (pre-calculated) Nisan. There is no telling whether the date of the contract is identical with that of the Byzantine document discussed on pp. 33 ff. of our study. 6. To p. 38, note 82: The text quoted from Sefer ha-'Osher in the first part of our note is an abridgement of a Karaite-Arabic commentary on the Canticles. A fragment of the Arabic original was published by Mann, Texts and Studies, II, 89. Mann failed, however, to recognize the relationship between the two works. Elsewhere I have shown that Jacob ben Reuben did not produce the Hebrew translation himself but used compilations and transla- tions which'were circulating in Byzantium from the middle of the eleventh century on. - For the interpretation of pnlln ltv, quoted in our note, see also Leka4 Tob on Exodus, 186 (93b).</page></plain_text>
