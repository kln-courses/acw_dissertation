<plain_text><page sequence="1"></page><page sequence="2">Furniture by Zaha Hadid AA BAR &amp; MEMBERS'ROOM 13 JANUARY-13 FEBRUARY 1988 Two tables, two sofas, and a storage unit con? stitute the earliest material evidence of Zaha Hadid's 'Suprematist geology'. This isn't sur? prising. From the columnar torcheres, undu? lating screens and cantilevered bookshelves of her 1981 scheme for 59 Eaton Place, London, to the trapezoidal desks and angular partitions of her recent Kurf?rstendamm office-building scheme in Berlin, furniture has played a con? tinual and important role in organizing the in? teriors of Hadid's explosive projects. The furniture in this exhibition originally occupied the interior of an International Style town house in Kensington, London, designed in 1962 by Timothy Rendle, and subsequently al? tered by successive owners, including Hadid's client, William Bitar, a timber importer. These wittily named pieces possess the structural com? plexity of buildings (the more daring ones re? quired the engineering expertise of Ove Arup &amp; Partners' Peter Rice) and a heroic scale rarely associated with domestic interiors. Hadid's fur? nishings do not submit to an overall decorative scheme, but are independent sculptural objects which dominate the neutral planes of their innocuous container with a dynamic, gravity defying tension. Elements pivot, slide, swivel, open, and close, and even stationary pieces are cantilevered, curved, bent, and layered to imply movement ? which prompted the client to ask: 'Why can't they all be electronic?' The backdrop to this kinetic ensemble is a storage wall framing a staircase and screening the kitchen off from the living space. The wall panels slide to expose shelves, brightly lac? quered in a Mondrian-like grid; and a hinged door in the right-hand panel swings open to form a trapezoidal window, intended to provide a view of the kitchen. Hadid arranged the sofas and tables to form two seating areas on the opposite side of the room, adjacent to a gridded window-wall facing the street. Of the two sofas, the 'Wavy Back' is the more architectonic, its undulating backrest affixed to the wall and its curvaceous upholstered seat framed by a sculp? tured wooden nook. The sofa is paired with the 'Metal Carpet' table, thus named because of its steel-supported bronze base which extends over the floor. The counterpart of this duo is the 'Whoosh' sofa, a great sweeping cushion, gra? dated in colour as if lit from one side, with a wet-suit rubber-covered beam and wedge shaped backrest, and the 'Sperm' table, a glass topped, whiplash line of cast bronze. The as yet unbuilt second phase of the project comprises a cantilevered dining table, staircase canopy, pivoting table, and desk. Rendered in black, white, greys, and primary hues, the furniture reflects Hadid's sensitivity to the emotive effect of colour applied to ab? stract forms. But these seemingly pure tones are not what they appear to be: the black of the 'Whoosh' is actually a deep green; the yellows and blues of the sofas and cabinet are a shade off true primaries; and the greys, like the muted tones of a Japanese Rikyu grey, are not mixtures of black and white, but variable blendings of complementary colours. The subtlety of this palette and the exuberant, irregular curves of the furniture are further proof of Hadid's gradual move away from the bright, orthogonal language of her Suprematist sources. Earthy and sensual, the furnishings refer to a variety of modernist predecessors. The curved wooden nook of the 'Wavy Back' sofa, for example, is reminiscent of Eileen Gray's lacquered day-bed, designed in 1919 ? and both sofas echo the sinuous lines of chairs designed by Alvar Aalto and Arne Jacobsen in the 1930s and 1940s. There is also an element of surrealist fantasy in Hadid's pieces ? one is reminded of the anthropomorphic curves of Salvador Dali's Mae West's lips sofa of 1936. The exaggerated, boomerang shapes of the sofas and their com? binations of seemingly incongruous fragments of materials also allude to 1950s kitsch and its recent, albeit refined, manifestation in the work of the Memphis group. Zaha Hadid's ability to evoke such an eclectic range of associations demonstrates the breadth of her vision, a welcome relief from the precious Hoffmann and Mackintosh knock-offs which continue to flood the furniture market. The architect's assertion, in a recent interview, that she was hampered by the unwillingness of crafts? men to experiment with unorthodox materials and techniques leaves us wondering how much more fantastic these pieces could have been if rendered in synthetic materials (shades of El Lis sitsky's transparent plastic chairs) with machine tooled precision, or if ? as her client suggested ? they had been electrified. For the next stage of her exploration Hadid will have to find a manu? facturer willing to risk the cost of developing her bold visions. Her exhaustive research into materials and methods of assembly, revealed in the detailed working drawings, proves that she is ready to confront the challenge of mass pro? duction.
