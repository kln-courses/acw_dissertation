<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS. Realism : An Attempt to Trace its Origin and Development in its Chief Representatives. By S. L. HAsAi. With a foreword by J. A. SMITH. Cambridge University Press, 1928. 16s. Dr. Hasan's purpose is to trace the development of realism from its origin in the common consciousness of man to its fulfilment in the philosophical -writings of Prof. G. E. Moore. It is not an easy book to read. Not only is the style heavy, but the method of presentment is unfortunate. On -the one hand he seems to view the development of realism as a continual ibattle between opposing views, in which there awe various " enemies " to be overcome. On the other hand, he regards it as an Hegelian dialectic the final synthesis of which is achieved by Prof. Moore. The origin of realism is to be found in the conviction of common con- sciousness that there is a real external world, or, as Dr. Hasan puts it, " Man believes in the existence of the world and its direct perception by a necessity of his nature " (p. 2). This necessity of man's nature is then referred to as the " realistic instinct," which is said to involve " two main theses: the reality of the external world and the direct revelation of it to our sense-apprehension ". To say that the external world is- real is to say that it exists independently of us. But this independence is of finite mind, not necessarily of infinite mind. Realism has nothing to say to the view that there "m may be an infinite mind, say God, who holds the whole universe of men and things on the palm of his hand, and on whom it depends for its being and its nature ". Subjective idealism is said to be the only metaphysics that is inconsistent with realism, whilst " objective. idealism is but realism plus the hypothesis of an infinite subject " (p. 9). Thus realism is treated as a theory of knowledge, but Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, Hegel, and Kant are all said to be realists. This seems a curious conclusion. It is difficult to see what definition of realism could justify the classing of these philosophers in one group with the authors discussed in this volume. Moreover, it is hardly possible to separate Plato's theory of knowledge from his metaphysic, and to regard the latter as " realism Certainly Dr. Hasan has made no attempt to justify these contentions. Although realism has its origin in the " unconscious convictions of man," these convictions must be questioned before realism as a philosophy can be established. On the one hand, the epistemnological doctrine of re- presentationism denies the directness of perception-onCe main thesis of realism; on the other hand, the metaphysical doctrine of subjective idealism denies the independent reality of objects-the other main thesis. Dr. Hasan conceives the development of the doctrine as consisting first in the exclusive assertion of one thesis, then in the exclusive assertion of the other. The difficulty is to combine them. But until they are combined, Tealism as such is not achieved. Accordingly, his exposition falls into three main divisions, with smaller sub-divisions. The beginnings of realism are found in Descartes, Locke, Reid, and Hamilton. They, how- ever, fail to secure the directness of perception. The modern movement</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 507 begins in Schuppe, Mach, and Avenarius who, however, do not succeed in making the object of perception independent. Meinong, Stout, and the American " Critical Realists " are grouped together. They overcome subjective idealism, but do not succeed in overcoming representationism. Dr. Hasan's mode of dealing with these philosophers is well brought out in the following quotation: "The first [of the series of unsuccessful attempts] (Descartes, Locke, Reid) asserts only the existence of objects; the second (Schuppe, Mach, Avenarius) emphasises only the directness of perception; the third (Meinong, Stout, " Critical-Realists ") aims at being a synthesis of both these movements, only the aim falls short of attain- ment. The attempt, however, succeeds in bringing out the paramount necessity of combining both the moments; it repeats more clearly and at a higher level the need which Reid had felt " (p. 45). Realism proper " starts with Moore at the beginning of the century" (p. 107). The contest is now regarded as centering in the conflict of thought and sense. This conflict is said to give rise to three species of realism: (1) the rationalistic realism of Cook Wilson, Prichard, and Joseph; (2) the empirical realism of Alexander, E. B. Holt, and Bertrand Russell; (3) the critical realism of Moore, Dawes Hicks, and Laird. These writers are treated in this order, much the greatest amount of space and attention being given to Prof. Moore, Dr. Hasan's exposi- tion is difficult to follow. Those who are not familiar with the writings which he criticises may find it difficult to grasp what exactly are their authors' views. This is particularly the case with the Oxford group of realists, since Dr. Hasan expounds their views by means of critical comments on papers which they have written about each other. The exposition of Alexander is also very obscure, being too much encumbered by disconnected criticisms. Prof. Holt is taken as the chief representative of American neo-realism. His views are more clearly expounded, but Dr. Hasan's criticisms seem to show some failure to grasp what exactly Holt's view is. Thus, his criticism of Holt rests on the assumption that consciousness must be awareness, which' is, of course, what Holt denies. He fails to see that, for Holt, the difference between subject and object is a difference in the context in which the same entity occurs. Hence, it cannot be considered that Dr. Hasan establishes his contention that Holt's doctrine is incom- patible with realism. This suggests that, after all, it is not very clear what " realism " is, in spite of the care with which Dr. Hasan attempts to define it. The criticism of Russell is peculiarly inept. No doubt there are im- portant affinities between Holt's views and Russell's, especially in the Analysis of Mind. But Holt's metaphysic is essentially based on a theory of subsistence-probably derived from Meinong and from Russell's earlier writings (e.g., The Principles of Mathematics)-which Russell has now completely abandoned. Dr. Hagan recognises that Russell's later views are not in accordance with those of Meinong and Holt, but he does not seem to realise how far-reaching the difference is. Nor has he apparently grasped the significance in Russell's philosophy of the principle of " con- structions versus inferences ". His criticism of the Frege-Russell theory of number shows a total misconception of their analysis. He're-asserts the common criticismn that the definition of number is circular, and says, ' But a one-one relation is conceivable only if the concept of the number 1 is already there. Moreover a one-one relation between classes signifies. equality not by itself, but because of the identity of the concept 1 " (p. 218). It is not a little surprising at this time of day to have these mistakes repeated. The footnote to this page, which asserts that " in de- fining number through the numerical equality of two classes, Frege and</page><page sequence="3">508 NEW BOOKS. Russell seem to be following psychology rather than logic," reveals a mis- conception that can only be described as grotesque. Much the longest section of the book is concerned with Moore's phil- osophy. The defects of Dr. Hasan's method are most apparent here. The various theories of Prof. Moore do not lend themselves to this dramatic presentment. Dr. Hasan's exposition suggests that he has failed to grasp the nature of Moore's method, and that he consequently does not realise that the changes in Moore's views are largely the result of a more and more rigorous application of that method. Indeed, Dr. Hasan has nothing to say about the method of analysis. He sets out from the assumption 'that Moore is essentially Kantian, and holds that " Moore's thought seems to traverse, consciously or unconsciously, these ithree moments of Kant's thought " (p. 231). Thus he fits Moore also-into the dialectic movement, and represents his development as consisting of three -stages: in the first, he is an idealist and a metaphysician; in the second, he is a " logicist," and goes beyond Kant; in the third, he " turns to the world of sense and asserts its reality explicitly and for itself " (p. 232). The exposition of the " first period," is very confused, and throughout, the conviction that Moore is a Kantian prevents Dr. Hasan from grasp- ing some of his positions. Nevertheless, Dr. Hasan has rendered a valu- able service to students of modern realism by giving such a full account. of Prof. Moore's writings. It is all the more valuable since Prof. Moore has refused to republish, in accessible form, the articles which have so greatly influenced contemporary philosophers. Dr. Hasan is perhaps the first writer to have stated clearly the extent to which modern philosophy has been influenced by Prof. Moore's views, even though he has failed to realise the significance of his'critical method. The book is exceptionally well-documented. Dr. Hasan seems to have read nearly everything that has been written by the philosophers whose views he criticises. There is a very full and well-arranged bibliography. L. SUSAN STEBBING. Greek Philosophy Before Plato. By R. ScooN, B.A., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Philosophy in Princeton University. London: Milford (for the Princeton Univ. Press), 1928. Pp. vii + 353. 16s. BESIDES its combination of competent scholarship with sound sense, Dr. Scoon's book is remarkable for the quality of its writing. The presenta- tion is made chaste and choice not only by a distinguished literary style but also by the tacit scruples of a mind for which thinking is a moral as well as a rational activity. Original ideas are brought forward with the decency of quietness; when a predecessor has to be corrected he remains unnamed and the task is done with unemphatic argument; and when a. thought calls for pregnant expression the brittle brilliance of epigram is shunned. If all this is rare nowadays it is perhaps because philosophy seems to be rapidly contracting from the love of wisdom to the exhibition of abstract technicalities that neither require nor evoke a balanced moral temper. It is particularly welcome to receive this example of disciplined and elegant scholarship from the States. The book is divided into/two parts: the first discusses the early thinkers in their due order, the second follows out the problems in their historical development within the period chosen. The second part inevitably re- peats much that is given in the first (indeed, its first, fourth and fifth chapters largely repeat each other) and could for the most part have been omitted without much loss; but perhaps this repetition is tedious only</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 509 to a reviewer, who is obliged to read the book straight through. The second chapter of this part gives a summary account of early Greek science in order to show that it arose.and developed among the philosophers, and to defend these from the charge of being merely speculative dreamers. Unfortunately this account reads like a catalogue and is entirely undocu- mented. There is an excellent index, which includes matters as well as names. The proof-reading has been almost impeccable: there seem to be only three misprints, all trifling-the omission of the last " i" in 4 scientific " on page 23, line 12; the omission of " c " in " Aeckern" on page 138, note 15; and in note 39, p. 172 raivrcov has gone awry. Dr. Scoon begins with a brief sketch of the oldest Greek views, popular as well as literary, of the world and man's place in it, but only to provide the cultural background against which the first philosophers must be seen, not to allege precedents abolishing the tradition that with Thales some- thing new began. Their anthropomorphism is admitted and their moral and religious motives even emphasised, but it is pointed out that there is a big difference between an explanation in terms of the imagined behaviour of imagined gods and one in terms of the known behaviour of human beings, and that the moral and religious impulse remained an impulse, providing the force rather than the content of their thinking. Xenophanes appears, as in Burnet, as having no connexion with Eleatic- ism, and as primarily a poet, though strongly influenced by the new Ionian cosmology. I should hesitate to accept the following as a state- ment of " the real point of Xenophanes' work," but it deserves quotation: "t If the sun is really a collection of sparks, it is difficult to imagine it as a divine person. And if the world is one great god, the whole Olympian fraternity seems unnecessary. X-enophanes meant to substitute the scien- tific point of view for the traditional one, through the implication that when science has explained a thing, it is impossible to think of that thing in any but a scientific way" (p. 49). Of Heraclitus the author all but says what I should like someone to say roundly, that he was the first meta- physician. The exposition of Parmenides' system is fresh and convincing. What he did was to grasp the exigencies of proof, to feel for the first time the full force of logical necessity-if you grant this you must grant that. This is well connected by Dr. Scoon with the nascent rhetoric of the time, and Parmenides' procedure is accordingly described as an application of "the principles of rhetorical argumentation to cosmological inquiry." With regard to the " Way of Opinion " Parmenides is done the simple justice of being supposed to mean what he says, namely, that it differs from truth by having no truth in it. It was natural that the thinker who first be- -came acutely aware of the fact of implication, with its imperious command, should deem all other facts irrelevant. The " Way of Opinion," accord- ing to Dr. Scoon, was intended as a description of the way we pass through before we come to truth. The thorny fragment ro yap av'r'o voiv E'oTV TrE JcaL eLVaL is read in accordance with Burnet's interpretation and, again with Burnet, ro2 O'v is taken as material, though Dr. Scoon entirely refrains from Burnet's extreme revolt, against Hegelian historians, in calling Par- menides the father of materialism. The most novel feature of the book is the treatment of the obscurest of all the problems with which the historian of Pre-Socratic philosophy has to deal, Pythagoreanism. We are modestly offered the outline of a genetic account, which seems to hold the germ of a'helpful contribution to the subject. The chief result is to raise Philolaus to the ranks of the -conspicuous cosmologists of the aze. The Philolaic fragments are repro- duced in translation and their claim to authentieity is defended. It is unfortunate that Dr. Scoon has not expanded his work here, for we are greatly in need of an extended examination, especially in English, of the</page><page sequence="5">510 NEW BOOKS. Pythagorean question. Even in German there is only, so far as I know, Frank's " Plato und die sogenannten Pythagoreer " (1923), and Prof. Robin has recently (in " La Pens4e Grecque ") declined to deal with Pythagorean- ism except as a whole. The author thinks it a mistake to claim that in Atomism the cosmo- logical ideas of the Pre-Socratics find their consistent culmination: when judged not by its later fortune but by the range and mode of contemporary thinking the system of Anaximenes, not that of Democritus, is seen to be the most logical synthesis. The point is argued with insight (pp. 206-211) and is offered as a new explanation of the standing problem why Plato ignored Atomism. It is good to find the Sophists dismissed as not philosophers but " philo- sophical opportunists ". Dr. Scoon adds a measured but severe condemna- tion of- them even when considered simply as leaders of the popular humanistic movement, and notes that it is quite erroneous to regard them as representing a clearly marked humanistic interregnum between the old cosmology and Platonism, since the activities of Parmenides, Zeno, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Archelaus, Diogenes, and Melissus all extend into (some, indeed, fall wholly within) the so-called Sophistic period. Further, almost all the early " cosmologists " were humanists in the sense of being concerned with a general view of human life, differing from the Sophists in ignoring not man but the social conditions of his existence. Partly on account of the first of these two points Socrates is treated rather in connexion with the cosmologists than with the Sophists. Not that Dr. Scoon accepts the Burnet-Taylor view; but he has clearly been influenced by.it. He attributes to Socrates the theory of Forms (and of their unification in the Good), Forms moreover as physical causes, and also the theory of knowledge as reminiscence. Here Dr. Scoon has faltered in his usual thoroughness. He does begin with a brief reference to the problem of separating the Socratic from the Platonic contribution, but absolves himself from dealing with ib and falls back on the usual method of subjective choice against which the work of Burnet and Taylor was a much needed protest. To take the Form of the Good as Socratic while holding, as Dr. Scoon' does, that the Republic, of which the doctrine of the Good is the metaphysical climax, is predominantly Platonic, is an inconsistency that needs a reasoned defence. To our exiguous literature on the early Greek philosophy the book is a delightful and helpful addition. In the graceful urbanity of its literary form it comes near to the relevant works of Ferrier, Caird, and Adamson, and in content incorporates and continues the work of Diels and Burnet. T. E. JESSOP. The Technique of Controversy. By BORIS B. BOGOBLOVSKY. Kegan Paul. Pp. 266. 12s. 6d. Mr. Bogoslovsky believes that many arguments used to-day are inefficient while others appear to be so although they are not. This real and ap- parent inefficiency is due, it is said, to the fact that we have no adequate technique of reasoning. We have failed to see that our reasoning processes are unlike those of the Greeks, and so have remained content with the logical technique of Aristotle. Mr. Bogoslovsky insists that the technique required implies the rejection of previously accepted criteria for truth and falsity. Hence in Chapter II. we are warned that we must not object to the new technique on the grounds that it is paradoxical, contrary to common sense, or hair- splitting.</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 511 In Chapter III. the nature of logic and its relations to other subjects is examined. Mr. Bogoslovsky's theory is unusual, while, to me, it remains obscure. He holds both that almost every logician has his own idea of what logic is and also that there has been no advance in deductive logic since Aristotle and none in inductive logic since J. S. Mill. Logic is classified as one among other " regions of experience" on the three-fold basis of subject matter, scope, and attitude. The resulting classification is strange. It contains ethics, as a normative subject of wide scope whose subject matter is " facts related to other facts," and logic as a normative science of limited scope whose subject matter is " statements related to statements ". Among other subjects included in the classification are psychology, metaphysical speculabions, and dialectics. According to Mr. Bogoslovsky most writers on logic have been concerned with the two latter subjects, a fact which, he says, explains the inefficiency of existing logics. Such logics are not techniques. Mr. Bogoslovsky's concern is to create the required technique. He believes that only by examining the character of actual processes of reasoning shall we discover the purpose which this new technique has to serve, and hence only so shall we know what kind of logic to create. Instead of making the desirable examination, however, Mr. Bogoslovsky reviews various sciences, contending that each imnplies four characteristics of modern thinking, namely, contiQuity, relativity, evolution, and an inclination to entertain various possibilities. Classical thought on the contrary was contemplative with no desire to control environment-a method of thinking adequately served by Aristotle's technique. Mr. Bogoslovsky neext examines Dewey's argument in Interest and effort in modern education as a sample of modern reasoning, in order to discern in it the requisites for a new technique. His contention is that Dewey's thinking implies the rejection of the law of excluded middle. It is difficult to understand why Mr. Bogoslovsky believes this. All that his examina- tion of Dewey's argument reveals is that Dewey insists that certain concepts are not mutually exclusive, but these concepts do not, as far as I can see, include any which are contradictory. Chapter V. is again concerned with the nature of modern thinking, but Mr. Bogoslovsky does not now generalise concerning this character as ex- hibited in different sciences, nor in particular thinkers ; instead, he turns to the psychology of thinking. He suggests that one formula is capable of representing any cognitive experience provided different values are as- signed to the variables it contains. The most important implication of the formula is that any experience consists of a combination of new with old elements. The relative part played by each in any given experience is alleged to determine the inductive or deductive, the subjective or objective, character of experience. Having described the various character- istics of thinking Mr. Bogoslovsky believes himself in a position to formu- late four principles of dynamic logic. It must suffice, here, to say that three of these principles are related to the combination of new experience with old, while the fourth is concerned with the quantitative expression of the relative parts played by different constituents in given experiences. In the following two chapters Mr. Bogoslovsky considers the possible uses to which these principles may be put. Firstly, they may be used curatively-to prevent fallacies-thus if the first principle is violated nonsense results, while violation of the second, third, and fourth incurs intolerance, ambiguity, and vagueness respectively. Secondly, he con- siders how the principles can be used constructively in education. He suggests that they would (1) solve difficulties of various antinomies; (2) supply a basis for intelligence tests for subje3ts of thirty years, whereas he contends that existing intelligence tests are only efficient for subjects</page><page sequence="7">512 NEW BOOKS. up to sixteen years; (3) make, logic an indispensable part of educational curriculum. Mr. Bogoslovsky evidently feels, in spite of these suggested applications, that he has not made the nature of his new logic clear, since in Chapter VIII. he returns to this question. He seeks to define his subject by showing how it is related to' the work of Heraclitus, of Parmenides, of Hegel, and to each of six different kinds of logics. Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of his book is this six-fold classification of logics, and his reasons for not identifying dynamic logic with any member of the six classes. He finds most kinship with the logic of A. Sidgwick, while he expresses the hope that a dynamic logic with quantitative indices of all values between 1 and 0 may be created, having the merits of the symbolic logic of Principia Mathematica but lacking its inapplicability to any specific problem. Stich a hopo appears to rest on confusion; it is doubtful whether Mr. Bogoslovsky has considered' the difference between a propositional function and its values. The book concludes with a brief consideration of certain implications of dynamic logic. To one who accepts the law of excluded middle Mr. Bogoslovsky's un- disguised contradictions are worrying, especially in the face of his dogma that the new logic, of which this book is presumably an application, cannot be refuted by that law. E. M. WHETNALL.' Die Selbstverwirkltichung des Geistes. By RICHARD KRONER. Pp. viii + 225. J. C. B. Mohr, Tubingeu, 1928. "A Phenomenology of Mind in 225 pages " is a not unfitting description of the scope and limits of this work. It has the explailatory sub-title "Prolegomena zur Kulturphilosophie," and is a systematic attempt to ground and understand the whole objective world of " Kultur " (Kultur includes everything which can be the object of history) as the necessary development of the simple fact of Consciousness. Consciousness is the ultimate datum beyond which no thought can go. The process of this development is timeless and dialectic, and the pro- cess not only of " our " thought, but of reality itself: it is not part of the author's task to justify the idea of such a process, except of course by his application of it. A " dialectic " process is one in which the spirit (the use of this term is meant to indicate that the prooess is not one merely of the knowing mind) is forced from a prior stage to a later by the self- contradiction of the prior. The contradiction, the progressive overcoming of which is the life of -the spirit, is in its most general terms that of Exist- ence and Significa-nce (" Sein und Sinn "), the real and the ideal: the contradiction that the given implies more than it is. This contradiction is present in the elementary fact of consciousness itself: consciousness implies at once knowing and being (this is made more obvious by the German term: Bewusst-sein), and yet consciousness barely as such is not what it knows and knows not what it is. It is impossible to give a sum- mary of an argument, which is at this stage (pp. 17-64) itself compressed almost into a summary, and the recapitulation of a few headings must suffice. The spirit must reconcile its knowledge with its being: or it must know itself. To do this it must present itself to itself, or objectify itself. All stages of individual consciousness, from that of naive sensation upwards, are successive attempts at this reconcilement through objectifi- cation. They show themselves successively inaadequate, because the mind at this level sees in its object never itself (or never merely itself), but an</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 513 external reality; and the gulf between the mind as " I " and the mind as object remains unbridged. The individual body represents one of these stages; in it (as in each stage) a partial solution is reached. The body is at once " I and object"; it is at once wrought and fashioned by the I *nd known by the I as itself-but only to a certain degree. There remains in it a stubborn element, recalcitrant to the moulding will and impene- trable to thought, and the spirit is driven further on its path towards self-reconciliation. We approach the central theme of this book when it is driven inevitably beyond the merely individual and forms for itself a " spiritual. body " in that sphere of " Kultur " which Hegel first discovered and called Objec- tive Spirit. In this new sphere it continues its process of objectification, and the author distinguishes four main stages, on each of which the reconciliation is signalised as incomplete by being achieved in a duality of forms, cor- T3sponding to the old duality of consciousness-of-self and consciousness-of- -object, and again to that of practical and theoretical consciousness. The stages are (1) the sphere of Economic Organisation and of Applied Science (" WirtIschaft und Technik ": we may think of Plato's " City of Swine ": this is the best part of the book) ; (2) State and Science; (3) Religion and Art; (4) Philosophy and History. The theory of Philosophy is in one respect worthy of especial remark. It is bhe task of Philosophy to review the other (in comparison naive) efforts of the spirit at self-objecti- fication, to understand 'how far they succeed and how far they fail in bridging the gulf; but in doing so it is itself solving the problem which they left unsolved, and this "reflective" reconciliation is the peculiar contribution of Philosophy to the self-realisation of spirit. Thus are explained two striking facts: that all typically modern philosophy is essentially " Kulturphilosophie " (its preoccupation with History is the sign of this), and that the whole vast realm of the objective spirit was only, discovered (i.e., only became a subject' of philosophy) so recently. The Greeks tried to reconcile Religion and State under Art, the Middle Ages all other objective forms under Religion; it is only since the break- down of these two attempts that Philosophy has achieved the hegemony (v. p. 123). A further conclusion from these premises seems to be that Philosophy proper dates only from Kant (cf. p. 196)-a conclusion which is harder to accept. The author expressly avoids attributing his views to their sources, wishing his argument to stand or fall by itself, but a review of the book would hardly be complete without a mention of its relation to the classical German Idealism. That it is grounded through and through upon the foundations laid by the latter, will be clear without further words; this alone rendered possible, e.g., the compression and brevity of the earlier stages of the deduction: a whole technical language, with all that that implies, lay ready for use. To Hegel (naturally from the nature of the subject) affinities are greatest, and they are very great. Hegel had partly stultified his great discovery of the objective spirit by identifying it ex- clusively with the state: thus the other forms of objective spirit presented him with an insoluble problem (cf. the embarrassment which Bradley in "Ethical Studies" and Bosanquet in, e.g., "Some Studies in Ethics" feel over the " Ideal Values "). Kroner corrects Hegel by removing this limitation, and thus making possible a proper systematisation of the sphere of Kultur. His treatment of " Wirtschaft und Technik " illustrates admirably his dependence on, and variation from, Hegel. His "Wirt- schaft " is nothing else than Hegel's "System of Needs," or "Civil Society ": an organisation for the supply of private wants, which implies and depends upon a superordinate reality (the state), and which, by the</page><page sequence="9">514 NEW BOOKS. mere fact of its organisation imports into itself an element of "Objec- tivity," which contradicts its avowed end. But Hegel does not notice the- complementary sphere of "Technik " (the most striking feature of the modern world), which is devoted likewise to the supply of private needs, but which in order to supply them must submit itself to scientific dis- cipline, acquiring thus a character which is incommensurable with its original end, and forcing thought in the same manner beyond itself to the objective world of Natural Science, which thus takes its place beside that of the state. This correction of Hegel is of course far-reaching, but the great problem before which the Hegelian Philosophy came to a standstill, the problem of History, does not seem to be materially advanced by the difficult last chapter of this book. MICHAEL B. FOSTER. Kant, sein System als Theorie des Kuilturbewusstseins. By REINHARD? KYNAST. Verlag Ernst Reinhardt, Munich, 1928. Pp. 229. 9 marks. TEIs book certainly gives a valuable exposition of many important features of Kant's philosophy. Perhaps the chief objection which can be urged is that it in some degree "falls between two stool{," since it is not quite suitable either as an introduction to Kant or as a research work for specialists. It would not, I think, be of much value to anybody who was not already fairly well acquainted with the philosopher, while it is too general and its conclusions not well enough supported by detailed evi- dence from the'text adequately to fulfil the other function. It can, how- ever, very well serve the intermediate purpose of renewing and synthesis-- hag the 'student's impressions of Kant, and helping us to view details in the light of more general principles. But in any case it would be very greatly improved by the addition of more frequent references to the actual text, at least in the earlier part where the author is dealing with the Critique of Pure Reason, and by summaries of the grounds for the lines of interpretation adopted. It also seems to me personally to give a some- what misleading impression by overbmphasising certain elements in Kant's. philosophy at the expense of others, thus failing to do real justice to the agnostical tendency in Kant, and also to the place which was taken in his, thought by physical science and the anxiety to provide an adequate philo- sophical foundation for this science. This is perhaps more than anything a question of emphasis, but it may none the less leave a student with wrong ideas on the subject. But, having said so much, I must at once- add that the book remains a very fine piece of work marked by lucidity, skill, and comprehensiveness. The fundamental conception applied is that of "K ulturwerte," a word which can hardly be translated in English, " cultural values " being too narrow for the purpose. As used by the author the term covers all intellectual, aesthetic and ethical values realised in society, including " the good will " itself as the most important, though, as he admits, this is not the usage of Kant. In this wide sense of the term we find that themwhole of physical nature must be regarded merely as a means to the realisation. of " Kulturwerte," and that the significance of the Critique of Pure Reason, depends on it being a study of this means. It is further discovered that Kant's attempt to justify recognised moral duties by arauing that a law which was in conflict with them could not be universalised is only valid if we give as our ground for this view, not, as Kant does, that such a law would be self-contradictory, but that it would prevent the realisation of these " Kulturwerte " if made general. Personally I should be inclined to criticise both lines of approach, the first on the ground that it over-</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 515 stresses the importance of Kant's ethics for the rest of his philosophy,. the second on the ground that once you make his ethics teleological in this fashion you have so fundamentally diverged from his view that it would be better to say frankly that you disagree with him than to talk as though the gulf were one that could be bridged by slight amendments. Kant's system is one which is less capable than most of being viewed as a " Theorie des Kulturbewusstseins ". For the standpoint suggested by' these words is primarily a social one, and one that lays great stress on values such as education, art, advance of knowledge. Now, firstly, Kant does not admit any value in intellectual or asthetic goods except as mere means to morality or to happiness, and, secondly, his philosophy is essen- tially individualistic in character rather than social. Hence the attempt- to look at his whole philosophy primarily from this angle seems to me almost bound to lead to distortion, for, however unfortunate and unwar- ranted we may think these omissions on the part of Kant, it is best. frankly to recognise them as historical fact. Finally in dealing with Kant's views on religion the author makes him give to the immediate- religious experience a significance which I should have thought he would have been one of the last to admit, and neglects to adduce much evidence in support of this disputable interpretation. But these are all differences of opinion, and do not make me feel any hesitation in recommending the book. A. 0. EWING. The Liberal State. By THoMAs WHITTAKER, B.A. With a foreword by the Rt. Hon. J. M. ROBERTSON. Pp. xxx, 159. London: Watts &amp; Co. 6s. net. This is a reprint, with son,e necessary additions, of a book published by- Mr. Whittaker twenty years ago. It is described on the title-page as an ' Essay in Political Philosophy,' and its avowed aim is to give us the theoretical principles on which Liberalism, as opposed to other political creeds, can be held to rest. These Mr. Whittaker defines as Justice and Freedom, contrasting thenm especially with the\ ' Order and Progress' of (Comte's Positive Polity, and less explicitly with the supposed principles of the other political parties.' But he can never resist the temptation to, digress; and so, desiring to avoid the construction of Utopias and con- vinced that his ideal already to some extent exists, he is seduced into a long parenthetical chapter of Philosophy of History, in which he traces the development of the Liberal State from its origins in Greek Antiquity thiough its temporary eclipse in the Dark and Middle Ages to its revival in modern times, only to be threatened with extinction by the various rivals, actual and theoretical, which have emerged from the great war' fought in its defence. And in the final chapters, deserting the past for the future but still digressing from the main issue, he expounds the policy which he thinks the Liberal State ought to develop on certain urgent practical matters such as Industry, Religion, and Education. The only part of the book which strictly carries out his intention of explaining the nature of Justice and Freedom is thus the second chapter, also digressive and somewhat confused, on the 'Watchword of the State'. Here he endeavours to show that, contrary to what might be expected, the Liberal' Theory of the State is more concerned with the ends or' results of the political process than with the rights on which it is based, and himself argues for ' culture ' as its proper end. But as he more or less withdraws this chapter in a t6rminal note, it is probable that for him</page><page sequence="11">516 NEW BOOKS. the real nerve of the book lies in the application of this vaguely adum- brated philosophy to past history and still more to future programmes, in the chapters which certainly constitute its main bulk. And these chapters suffer not only from the digressiveness of their style and the vagueness of the philosophy applied in them but also from the general difficulty, shared by Mr. Whittaker with most writers on these topics, of successfully mingling theory and practice. Yet they have the great merit of being written in a spirit of philosophical debate rather than of party controversy; for Mr. Whittaker is very ready to see and acknowledge merit in positions and policies other than his own and is indeed, both in his theory and its applications, far more open to the accusation of eclecti- cism than of intolerance-as is the case even with political parties, at least in the composition of their programmes. So if the book is not altogether successful as an Essay in Political Philosophy, it is nevertheless not with- out value as a discursive and suggestive treatment, from a singularly in- dependent point of view and with a vivid sense of the continuity of thought and of history, of some questions of considerable practical importance. And the theoretical issue is somewhat more adequately dealt with in the two articles which are reprinted as an appendix. D. DE SELINCOURT. Les anne'es d'apprentissage de Descartes (1596-1628). By J. SIRVEN. Paris, J. Vrin, 1928. Pp. 498. 50 fr. This book seems to me a careful and valuable account, on a very ample scale, of Descartes's philosophical development up to the composition of the R-egulce. It may be regarded as a genetic explanation of much in the Regulce; and therefore, of course, of much in the Discouils. It is a valu- able supplement to M. Gilson's admirable edition of the latter work, and contains searching criticisms of M. Brunschvieg and of certain other authors, ancient and modern. In view of modern research, no one would say to-day, as M. Bergson said in 1916, that Cartesianism owes nothing essential to antiquity or to the middle ages. It is not " proles sine matre creata," even if Descartes himself rather sedulously tried to convey that impression. Perhaps M. Sirven is somewhat overzealous in the opposite direction. Is Cartesian analysis really identical with Tolet's resolutio ? (p. 194). How much was frankly borrowed by Descartes (or semi-consciously borrowed) from Soto, Fonseca, and others? On points such as these, however, the reader must consult the evidence, and M. Sirven's very full quotations are likely to save him a vast deal of trouble. M. Sirven has studied the contemporary manuals, either accessible to Descartes or in use amona his teachers at La Fleche, with very great care, and has pieced the evidence together in a connected narrative. Possibly some parts of the narrative are over elaborate. It is important to show that Descartes's physics in 1618 had not detached itself from the conceptions of the schools-perhaps even that Descartes had not fully understood these conceptions-but thirty pages or thereby, on smallish fragments, seems very good measure. M. Sirven begins his decisive exposition with a long discussion of what probably happened on the night of 10th November, 1619, the nature and history of Descartes's celebrated visions, and the like. This discussion, although not short, has, as with Descartes himself, a certain dramatic quality. It is a convenient spool on which to begin to wind that thread of Theseus which in the developed theory of Regulce V. was the clue to the labyrinth of the sciences. This thread of Theseus, our author explains, is the principle of order which deity has imposed on his handiwork the</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 517 mechanical world, and its essence (vide Fonseca and others) is the principle of simplicity which resolved itself for Descartes into a universal mathe- matics. Along with the history of the thread of Theseus go the historical enquiry into the fundamenta scientiae mirabilis which Descartes may have divined at that early date, and into the ethical question Quod vitae sectabor iter ? later to be developed in the Studium Bonae Mentis and in the well-known " interim " ethics of the Discours. M. Sirven's spacious and admirably documented pages go a long way towards enabling us to answer such questions. M. Sirven concludes his book with a most useful bibliography of twenty- five pages.
