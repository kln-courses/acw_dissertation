<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sculpture in the Round and Very High Relief in the Clay Statuary of Hadda The Case of the So-called Fish Porch (Niche XIII) by Zemaryalai Tarzi Maurizio Taddei merited whole volumes to be dedicated to him on Afghan archaeology. This is my modest contribution - an offering of a few pages containing some ideas and various points on a subject we long debated in lively discussion. As a wise master who often found himself in agreement with my theories, he would discreetly encourage me to make my documents known and substantiate my working hypotheses. I come to this task all too late, regretting his absence. Of the many points that found us in agreement, one concerned the interpretation of the scene in Niche XIII at Tape Shotor, known as the 'Water Niche' or 'Fish Porch'), 'Chapel H' and 'Rawaq-e Mahiha.' I welcome the opportunity to set out my ideas here, although in the technical context of sculpture, and more particularly study of in the round and very high relief in clay statuary. To this end I have undertaken presentation of this celebrated Niche XIII (the Fish Porch) at Tape Shotor (henceforth TSh). It was built on the west side of the st?pa court (Fig. 1) in the prolongation of Niches XIV-XVI (Tarzi 1997: fig. 1). These niches formed an integral whole, but the builders at work at the beginning of the TSh V period (Tape Shotor V) found themselves compelled to make some changes. The floor of Niche XIII was then raised about 40 cm above the level of the original Niche XIII, which was at the same height as the floors of Niches XIV-XVI, all the Niches dating to the same period. We probed it from the front for some tens of centimetres without encountering the feet of statues placed in the original Niche, but among the fragments in the filling we unearthed a Buddha head in clay measuring 18.5 cm in height (Inv. no. 1976 = H.TSh. VIII, 89). Badly damaged, it was half calcined, grey-black in colour, partly gilded with gold leaf. When the niche was reorganised it underwent a total transformation. The entire surface of the walls and floor of the second version of Niche XIII is sculpted with decoration in bas-relief. The sinuous, wave-like undulations and aquatic flora and fauna together with the fish all evoke the watery element. The scene thus displayed three-dimensionally recounts of one of the episodes of the meeting between the Buddha and the n?ga. We cannot be certain where exactly the Buddha was placed, but tu 383</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 - Hadda, Tape Shotor, plan of the excavated remains (ground level). (Drawing Z. Tarzi, after Tarzi 1997). the position of the n?ga raises no problems: he occupied the middle of the composition, slightly off-centre to the left (Fig. 2). Since all the TSh niches illustrate scenes in the life of the Buddha S?kyamuni, it is more logical to read into this the episode in which the serpent deity Kala or K?lika (the n?gar?ja K?lika), attention aroused by the arrival of the Bodhisattva Siddh?rtha, foretells to him his imminent triumph. We see K?lika lying at his feet, singing the praises of the future Buddha. 384 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2 - Tape Shotor, Niche XIII (= Water Niche = Fish Porch = Raw?q-e M?hih?) after restoration. The interpretation of this scene offered by Sh. Mostamandi (1968b, 1968c, 1968d) as representing the conversion of the n?ga Gop?la who dwelt in the cave of the Buddhas shadow to the south of Nagarah?ra seemed quite convincing at first sight. Indeed, Sh. Kuwayama's identification of the scene in TSh Niche XIII, drawing on the evidence of the texts, as the submission of the n?ga Apal?la, given the presence of the Vajrap?ni and the 'blazing arch' on the back wall, seemed truly ingenious, despite the fact that the episode reflected a legend of the Swat valley (1987: 158-61). However, Sh. Mostamandi's theory raised as many difficulties as Sh. Kuwayama's. Interpreting the scene as depicting the submission of Gop?la would appear to be more logical since TSh and the cave of the Buddha's shadow belonged to the same region. But, we may ask, was it really necessary to illustrate a scene when the devotees could visit the very place where the episode occurred? Is it possible [3] 385</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 3 - Tape Shotor, Niche XIII, photograph highlighting in white the position of a removed element in high relief resembling a trefoil arch. that representation of the naga was more important than the appearance of the shadow of the Buddha himself in this cave? On the evidence offered by Xuanzang (Julien 1857: 98-101; Beal 1983: 93-94; Watters 1996: 184, 193-95), we opt for the second solution. In any case, the hypotheses offered by Sh. Mostamandi and Sh. Kuwayama concur on one precise point, and that is the image of the Buddha depicted in the middle of the back wall, facing the visitor. However, their ideas come up against an insurmountable technical objection. In every single case where the Buddha was depicted in a niche or chapel at TSh, in terms of scale he was shown from twice to about four times larger than the other figures completing the scene. If we picture to ourselves a seated statue of the Buddha within the 'blazing' trefoil arch, his head rising no higher than the upper 386 [4]</page><page sequence="5">I j Fig. 4 - Tape Shotor, Niche XIII, attempted reconstruction of the images in relief on the basis of the evidence of the wooden skeleton. foil, it could hardly be any larger than the Bodhisattvas and divinities around it (Fig. 3). On the other hand, four holes left by dowels or poles at the base of the 'blazing' arch must have belonged to an arrangement to fix a socle or prepare the skeleton at the level of the lower limbs. In this case, the large hole situated roughly at the centre of the arch in question could have held the centre pole. However, it will still be hard to account for the presence of hole 10 in the floor and holes 6-9 near the edges of this 'blazing' mandorla since, in the latter case, the wooden dowels fixed there would be left outside the body of the supposed seated Buddha statues (Fig. 4a-b). Actually, the over-wide cavity 1 housed a couple of dowels serving as struts to create a better fit for the pole that was fixed on hole 10. Thus it served as a skeleton for a sculpted image rising some way above the top of the 'blazing' arch. If Sh. Mostamandi had not consulted the prints of the excavations by J. Barthoux in the Museum of Kabul, Sh. Kuwayama could at any rate have seen the article by [5] 387</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 5 - Hadda, B?gh Gai, plaster decoration of Stupa 66. H. Motamedi in the journal Afghanistan, 31, 2, September 1978 (summer 1357), with my drawing of the statue of Kanishka at Surkh Kotal on the cover, and on the other side a photograph of the B?gh-Gai excavation illustrated here (Fig. 5), which represents a n?ga and his n?gi, both kneeling, before a great lotus flower bearing a Buddha. If the scene does indeed represent the submission of the n?ga, then in this case, as compared with B?gh-Gai, the contours in the form of a trefoil arch (the blazing arch of Sh. Kuwayama) would correspond to the contours of the lotus flower in high relief, and the upper foil to its flared pericarp. His technical device by means of which the sculptors were able to give an aerial position to a statue, placing it at an upper level so that it seems to be emerging from the walls, had already been implemented in Niche E XXIVb de TSh (Fig. 4c). Here, however, the unusual position of the forearm skeleton set into the walls and the limited space afforded additional solidity (Tarzi 1986: fig. 3). If such a system had been attempted in the case of Niche XIII, it would indeed have been an audacious solution. To complete the picture presented here, we should also reconstruct above what remains of a figure facing the n?ga - two stumps, 11 and 12, and hole 11 in the ground - either a statue of the standing Buddha, or the kneeling wife of the n?ga 388 [6]</page><page sequence="7">N Fig. 6 - Tape Shotor, plan of excavations in the west corner of the st?pa court: Niches IX, X and XIII together with the nearby st?pa. (Drawing S.A. Reha). (Fig. 4a and a). Now, the distance from the tip of the right foot to hole 11 serving for the shaft of the skeleton is no less than 0.30 m. Adding on the thickness of the layer of clay round the foot at the heel and taking account of the length of the toes, we reach about 0.35-0.37 m, which comes to a sufficient length to take in the feet of the nagt, which do not exceed half this length. In this case, we should take as good the account given by S.A. Reha (Fig. 6), who was present during the excavation campaign, before the two restorations of the niche by A.R. Far?zi and subsequently Fed?h Mohammad, which modified certain details of apparently no significance, but important to us. Apart from the evidence of the plan drawn up by S.A Reha, that architect himself informed me of the presence of a large figure standing in front of the n?ga (to the right of the spectator, that is) showing left three-quarter profile. The Afghan architect added that there were a great many fragments, undoubtedly of a standing Buddha. His hypothesis implies the need for two stumps and two holes for the legs. [7] 389</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 7 - Tape Shotor, Niche XIII, north corner and n?gas socle at the foot of the north-east wall. Thus we would have the Buddha represented as in Gandh?ra on the reliefs showing his meeting with the n?ga K?lika, where he is always shown standing. To make room for the nagt, we must reconsider our reconstruction. In fact the three elements on the floor of the niche, i.e. the two stumps 11 and 12 and hole 11, should be ascribed to the two knees (the stumps) and the pole (the hole) as framework consolidating the position of the kneeling figure. In complete agreement with S.A. Reha, I believe that what we had here was a standing Buddha since the evidence on the floor of the cavern suggests something too large for a nagt, whether standing or seated. The fact that there is only one shaft to the skeleton suggests a lopsided position for the Buddha, as in the case of the Bodhisattva in Niche VI. However this may be, there is no need for the 'blazing' arch surrounding the body of the Buddha. The presence of Vajrap?ni offers no proof for identification of the scene in Gandh?ra, where such a presence beside the Buddha was obligatory from the Great Departure to the Parinirv?na. What remains to be worked out is the presence of a socle below, against the right (north-east) wall, which was flanked by two genies the remains of which offer very scant evidence for detailed description (Figs. 7-8). The lower end of a fold in a robe on this socle might evidence the presence of another draped figure; otherwise, it might be a scrap of material 390 [8]</page><page sequence="9">associated with the genie to the right. In any case, the socle was not made to support a figure, whether seated or standing, since the knees of the genies came between it and the wall. Moreover, the elevated position of the genies and the upward direction of their movements forming a sort of pyramid with the two converging diagonals suggest the presence of an element fixed to the wall which was connected with the socle. Actually, this connection was not particularly sturdy (a trunk or stem of a plant) since it left a good view of the genies as at Fondukistan (Hackin et al. 1959: fig. 182) and Tapa Sardar (Taddei 1978: figs. 218-223). Without going into detailed description of the other personages taking part in the scene (already supplied by Sh. Mostamandi), we may observe that the figure on the far left, close to the Fig. 8 - Tape Shotor, Niche XIII, n?gas socle at the foot of the north-east wall. spectator, of which there remain no more than the feet shod with the slightly pointed boots of a horseman is to be identified as a donor. Also to be noted is the makara head above, to the left of the back wall, enhancing the sense of a watery environment. As for the two statues situated close to the opening of the niche, one against the wall to the right, the other to the left, added, according to Sh. Mostamandi, at a later date (an opinion I share), they were made of clay coated with plaster and have failed to survive. It is regrettable that this Niche XIII was among the first to be excavated by a very young squad of Afghan excavators belonging to Sh. Mostamandis team. Greater care in the work could have yielded more complete results, and we would not be working at such a hypothetical level. Among the fragments saved that were to be found in the palace of Sar?j-al-'Em?rat, we have at any rate identified those belonging to the head of the n?ga (Fig. 9). The grimacing head recognised as such by Sh. Mostamandi (Fig. 10) could not have belonged to the n?gar?ja: whenever and wherever depicted in Gandh?ra, apart from the cobra hood as animal symbol the anthropomorphic n?gas have the appearance of monarchs, like Indra, Bodhisattva etc. In terms of artistic execution, Niche XIII is in the tradition attested in Niches (VI-V3) of the vih?ra no. 1. The torsos of these figures in wet robes are comparable with the Brahma figures in Niches VI and V2. Actually, we brought to light some [9] 391</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 9 - Tape Shotor, Niche XIII, K?lika. head of n?ga identical torsos in Niche VIII but we were unable to place them in their location. However, our comparisons should not stop here, since certain statues of large proportions (as compared with the miniaturised representation of the bas-reliefs) in Gandh?ra show the sculptor intent on rendering the transparency of cloth, as in the case of the TSh sculptor, who clearly took pains to make the anatomy of the body show through. In the case we are dealing with here, we have such details of dress as the undergarment on the lower abdomen taking the form of a roll (Ingholt 1957: fig. 340). By now we have dedicated sufficient attention to Niche XIII. It would be extremely useful to carry out separate, detailed study of the relationship between our niche and the monuments of Central Asia and India still in place. In view of the date of Niche XIII (probably the latter half of the 3rd century - first half of the 4th century A.D.) we are not limited to mere conjecture but can rapidly deal with a couple of points. To start with, there are solid grounds for comparison between Niche XIII and the aquatic scene depicted on the walls of the east iv?n in temple II at Penjikent since both scenes show the same technique and the same material. On the evidence of the relatively late date of Penjikent it has been suggested that a new dating be proposed for Niche XIII de TSh. Contesting this theory, G. Verardi (1982) addressed the question of Penjikent anew, rightly rejecting dating in the 5th century AD. According to Verardi, in reality these clay reliefs belonged to a Buddhist monument that not only dated to the Kushan period but appear to have represented a prolongation of the Graeco-Bactrian tradition. Much the same idea had already been launched by B. Rowland (1974: 56-58), but with a late date based on the discovery of some Shapur III coins (383-388 A.D.) made by Sh. Mostamandi. Again, with respect to Niche XIII, B. Rowland points out that it was dedicated to the meeting of the Buddha and the spirits of the waters, or as a sanctuary organised solely for cult of the n?gas appearing on practically the entire precinct of this chapel. It is for this reason that he takes one of the worshiping divinities to be the n?gi. Finally, he observes that certain n?gas with their wet robes recall the contemporary late antique formula (4th century A.D.) to be seen at Penjikent and Hadda, the classical heritage emerging more strikingly in the sculptures on the latter site. Moreover, in the light of the latest discoveries there is no longer any doubt about the prolongation of the Graeco-Bactrian artistic past. By 392 [10]</page><page sequence="11">comparing Hadda with Penjikent B. Rowland takes a great step forward in this respect, although he remains faithful to his old ideas. On the second point I again find myself in agreement with G. Verardi, who points out the futility of seeking a close parallel between Penjikent and Cave 5 at Udayagiri (Vidisa District) (Verardi 1982: pis. XIV-XVI; Harle 1974: figs. 12-15). If there is an influence at work, we should take it in the contrary direction and follow it from Bactria (where it remains to be found) - Sogdia to Gandh?ra and India. In conclusion I must point out that the article by M. and Sh. Mostamandi Fig. 10 - Tape Shotor, Niche XIII, probable head of n?ga Gop?la (?). (1969: 19-22, figs. 13-20) on the new excavations of Hadda contains a good description and plentiful photographs of the water Niche XIII. [11] 393</page><page sequence="12">BIBLIOGRAPHY Beal, S.
