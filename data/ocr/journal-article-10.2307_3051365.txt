<plain_text><page sequence="1">Unfinished Homage: Manet's Burial and Baudelaire Nancy Locke Little precise documentation exists for Edouard Manet's The Burial, a painting that has been in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NewYork since 1909 (Fig. 1).1 The work, which Manet listed in an inventory of his works as "L'Enterrement ta la Glaciere,"2 never left Manet's studio in the painter's lifetime, and it was authenticated by Suzanne Manet, the painter's widow, in 1884. The painter Camille Pissarro, who owned it by 1894, referred to it as "an extraordinary sketch" he had obtained in an exchange with the dealer Ambroise Vollard: "a superb [size] 30 canvas."3 The modern viewer can easily discern what appealed to Pissarro about the work: it is a real landscape that offers the kind of apparent fidelity Pissarro so valued with regard to weather effects, to shifts in topography, and to the monu- ments of the Paris skyline. In the painting, a funeral cortege makes its way across the right foreground field; it seems enclosed by the canopy of the city above and around it. There are varying accounts of the precise location of the vantage point and suggestions that the work commemorates the funeral of Manet's great friend Charles Baudelaire, which took place on September 2, 1867.4 For all its specificity in certain areas, the painting remains strangely vague in others. Unlike the figures in so many other Manet paintings, the figures in the cortege cannot be identi- fied. In contrast to the background of recognizable Paris monuments, the middle ground is sketchy and unfinished. Although some writers have suggested a relation between the dark clouds in the picture and the storm that broke out at 1 Edouard Manet, The Burial, oil on canvas, ca. 1867.

Several commentators, however, have noted the specifically imperial uniform of the figure at the end of the cortege, a detail that indicates a date prior to 1870, while the stylistic evidence points to a date of late 1867 or after.6 Given this tantalizing mix of the particular and the ambigu- ous, it is necessary to think more broadly, or better yet, speculate: If Manet were to paint a picture commemorating Baudelaire's funeral, what might it be like? Perhaps more important: What would it not be like? What other examples would Manet have been responding to in 1867? And what kind of a funeral, and what kind of a picture of Paris, does the painting actually offer? First, the location. It has long been noted that the painting was done somewhere at the foot of the Butte Mouffetard, which features on its summit the Pantheon, prominent in the painting's skyline. In the 1930s, Adolphe Tabarant had proposed Manet's vantage point as the rue de l'Estrapade, but that area, at the heart of the Fifth Arrondissement, seems too close to the Pantheon to offer a glimpse of all the other monuments depicted.7 Eric Darragon suggests the area around the Gobelins tapestry works; certainly it provides an excellent perspective on the Pantheon from the present-day avenue des Gobelins.8 The major monuments themselves have not been much in dispute: the canvas shows the rounded dome of the Observatoire at left and, close to it, the vaulted dome of the Val-de-Grice; the highest point is occupied by the Neoclassi- cal Pantheon, and near it lies the belfry of St-Etienne-du-Mont and the Tour de Clovis, part of the Lyc&amp;e Henri IV. Despite the painting's appearance of faithful transcription, many critics have argued that Manet must have juggled and rear- ranged the monuments. Theodore Reff has proposed that the painting could literally represent the Montparnasse cemetery, where Baudelaire was buried, and that the structure usually identified as the Val-de-Grace could instead be the dome of the Sorbonne, another seventeenth-century building.9 Charles Sterling and Margaretta Salinger observe that if La Glaciere is the location, then Manet has moved the Observatoire and the Val-de-Grice closer together.10 Most recently, and more accu- rately, however, Henri Loyrette reinforces the idea that the painter's viewpoint was the rue de la Glaciere; a painting with a view of Paris from Gentilly shows essentially the same view from farther away." There is, in fact, a contemporary text that almost perfectly describes Manet's view. In Emile de Labedolliere's Le nouveau Paris: Histoire de ses 20 arrondissements, 1860, the writer suggests a walk out to the new Thirteenth Arrondissement: The stroller who, after having followed the rue Mouffe- tard, turns right and takes the rue Petit-Gentilly [today from the avenue des Gobelins to the rue Abel Hovelacque], finds himself unarguably faced with one of the most beautiful landscapes that can be found in Paris. Right before his eyes, he has a valley watered by the Bi~vre, to which he is not close enough to breathe its deleterious and nauseating emanations.12 The Bi~vre River, a tributary of the Seine, was once a prominent feature of the Parisian landscape on the southeast- ern Left Bank.13 By 1860, it had long served as a waste collector for the tanneries, dyers, and other factories in the area, and it had a notorious reputation for its brown color and putrid odors. The writer continues: The imposing lines of the Gobelins works dominate a cluster of rooftops, most of them deteriorating with time. Above the houses, outlined against the sky, are the Observa- toire, the dome of the Val-de-Grtce, that of the church of Sainte-Genevieve [the Pantheon], the steeples of Saint- Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, of Saint Etienne-du-Mont and the tower of the lycee Napoleon [Lyc&amp;e Henri IV]. We cannot too highly recommend to travelers this exceptional view, which deserves to be better known.14 The rue Abel Hovelacque, the location of the writer's view, is on the hill known as the Butte-aux-Cailles, west and southwest of the present-day place d'Italie. Other structures now inter- fere with the once famous view.15 The spot was partly known for being out of the way and underappreciated; in Les miserables, Victor Hugo had lamented: "As much as the spot is worth seeing, no one goes there. ... [ Comme le lieu vaut la peine d' tre vu, personne n'y vient. .. .]."16 In about 1815, the painter Jean-Baptiste Langlace (1786-1864) executed a view of Paris seen from the heights of Gentilly (Fig. 2). After taking into consideration Langlace's more classicizing approach to land- scape (he was an early master of Camille Corot) and his vantage point, which is considerably more to the south and slightly to the west of Manet's, it is possible to see certain similarities in the relationships between the Val-de-Graice, the Pantheon, St-Etienne-du-Mont, and the Tour de Clovis in the two paintings. In Langlace's work, the Butte-aux-Cailles is visible as the hill on the painting's right side, with the Moulin des Merveilles on its crest. The butte had been the site of the historic landing of the first balloon voyage in 1783, an event perhaps already depicted by Manet in a small print tacked to Polichinelle's curtain in the artist's frontispiece for an album of etchings (Fig. 3).17 The steep perspective and variegated sky in The Burial make an immediate impression on the viewer. If a subsequent impression is created by the painting's roughness or unfin- ished areas, the viewer is also likely to notice that however sketchlike the painting remains, the structures and figures are nevertheless laid down with a certain definitiveness. Above and behind the funeral cortege, the dark and ragged cypress trees appear to make a procession of their own against the light, scratchy middle ground.1s Visible are a few of the rooftops mentioned in Labedolliere and delineated in the Langlace painting. Manet's landscape appears highly specific in regard to weather conditions. Close study of the sky reveals a mixture of darker and lighter clouds, a puff of smoke coming from a distant chimney, and patches of deep blue sky punching through the clouds. Manet intersperses the cobalt blue patches with traces of wispy white cloud and adds a touch of cerulean blue to the small opening of sky just at the horizon line center. The dark clouds cast a deep shadow over much of the landscape, and the silhouettes of the domes and belfries appear dramatically backlit against the light in the distance.</page><page sequence="3">70 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 1 2 Jean-Baptiste Langlac6, Paris vu des hauteurs de Gentilly, oil on canvas, ca. 1815.

Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs At the same time, the opening in the clouds allows a band of bright light to sweep over the foreground, illuminating the funeral cortege and casting a breath of light over the facing portion of the Pantheon dome. The Burial presents a detailed record of a few very particular and transitory moments when a break in a mass of dark, heavy clouds can create brilliant and unexpected passages of light across a landscape. Even if Manet characteristically pulls background elements forward and makes the perspective more abrupt than did his predecessor Langlac6, the topography represented in The Burial nevertheless remains as specific as its meteorology. The grove of trees in the left foreground registers as an elevation. Manet renders it with Courbet-like palette-knife work, consid- erably lightening the right edge of the grove in order to set it off from the meadow at right as well as from the dark foliage that encloses the procession. A further topographical shift is delineated by the band of yellow drawn across the right center of the picture, beyond the foreground meadow. This in all likelihood represents the low retaining walls built along the Bievre River, especially those along the rue Croulebarbe and the Gobelins tapestry works.19 Lab6dolliere's text mentions the easy visibility of the Gobelins works from the Butte-aux-Cailles, and a contempo- rary etching by E. Bourdelin shows the retaining wall along the curving Bievre, around which was built the large complex of structures that comprised the centuries-old tapestry manu- facture (Fig. 4). Bourdelin's etching even indicates the view of the Val-de-Graice (at left) and the Pantheon from the banks of the Bievre near the works. A further detail to be gleaned from Bourdelin's etching is the tall chimney that appears near the Gobelins factory. The chimney, no doubt represented in Manet's painting by the long, vertical, brown stroke near the center of the painting (Fig. 5), would appear to be that of the</page><page sequence="4">UNFINISHED HOMAGE: MANET'S BURIAL AND BAUDELAIRE 71 4 E.

On the left side of the horizon, well to the left of the Observatoire and a good distance from it, stand a steeple and a second small structure (Fig. 7). These could well belong to St-Pierre de Montrouge, a church Manet painted again in 1870 in a small canvas (Fig. 8). During the Franco-Prussian War, the unfinished nave was used as a hospital.22 In addition, a great puff of smoke appears to be coming from the Pantheon in Manet's painting. Although this could well be a bit of visual play, there was one important producer of smoke along the Left Bank north of the Pantheon: the H6tel des Monnaies.23 One remaining question has to do with the title, "L'Enterrement 'a la Glacikre." The area usually called La Glaciere is farther west than the Butte-aux-Cailles; it was also outside the city limits, beyond the Barriere de la Glaciere (or de l'Oursine). Nineteenth-century maps of the quartiers such as Labedolliere's show its western boundary as the rue de la Glaciere (a road that served as the route to Gentilly) and its eastern boundary as the Bievre River. It took its name from the temporary frozen ponds made on the banks of the Bievre in the winter; these were frequented by ice-skaters.24 In practice, the term was used loosely in speaking of the area along the banks of the Bievre, hence Manet's use of the name in his inventory title. It seems quite plausible, then, that the Butte-aux-Cailles was Manet's vantage point for the painting. By the late 1860s, the butte had a certain notoriety, since Baron Haussmann, 5 The Burial, detail of chimney and building, center (photo: Christopher Campbell) prefect of the Seine, had proposed a new artesian well to be drilled there; the well remained unfinished twenty years after his resignation, when he wrote his memoirs.25 More impor- tant, however, the butte also remained, as it had been since the last years of the Restoration, a shantytown for the chiffonniers-the ragpickers who had figured prominently in the poetry of Baudelaire and the work of Manet before 1867. A further consultation of Lab dolliere's guide reveals: Unfortunately, this view can only be had by crossing a badly constructed, and we can say badly inhabited, neighbor- hood-since it is conventional to regard poverty as a sign of reprobation. The honest workers who are densely packed into the sinuous streets of the faubourg Saint- Marcel must perhaps have more to complain about than those whose misfortune we have already pointed out in speaking of the XIe and the XIIe arrondissements. It is to the XIIIe and to one part of the Ve that the Parisian chiffonniers are confined.26</page><page sequence="5">72 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 1 6 Dugart, H6tel de la Reine Blanche, photograph, 1867. Paris, Bibliothbque Nationale 7 The Burial, detail of horizon, left (photo: Christopher Campbell) Before the annexation of the surrounding areas of Paris in 1860, the Butte-aux-Cailles was outside the city limits, and thus exempt from taxation on certain items, such as wine. One architectural historian writes that in the Butte-aux- Cailles during the first half of the nineteenth century, "a rural fabric was maintained and built up in an utterly anarchic way.""27 As the industries along the Bievre expanded, the ragpickers would have been in close proximity with the 8 Manet, Effect of Snow at Petit-Montrouge, oil on canvas, 1870. Cardiff, National Museums and Galleries of Wales potential outlets for their scavengings: there were in fact over a hundred factories, tanneries, mills, and dye works in the vicinity, including a paper mill and two cardboard-box manu- facturers.28 Once he is equipped as a chiffonnier, once he has familiar- ized himself with the ignominy of this dirty profession, after having adopted it by necessity, he continues it by inclination. He revels in his nomadic life, in his endless promenades, in his lazzarone-like independence. He looks with profound mistrust upon those slaves who shut them- selves up from morning 'til night behind a workbench in some atelier. While others-those living machines-adjust the use of their time to the movement of the clock, he, the chiffonnierphilosophe, works when he wants, rests when he wants, without memories of the night before, without worries about the next day.29 The chiffonnier is "arm"," equipped, with a medallion; the number of licensed Parisian ragpickers was regulated, as was that of street singers and saltimbanques (street acrobats). Maxime Du Camp's Paris, ses organes, ses fonctions, et sa vie attests to the existence of 5,952 licensed chiffonniers in Paris around 1870.30 Labedolli're's romantic account of the no- madic life of the chiffonnier continues with a listing of the meager prices-from eight to forty-four francs-that could be had for a haul of 100 kilograms (200 pounds) of rag scrap, depending on its quality (from paper scrap to fine linen).

Oslo, Nasjonalgalleriet (photo: J. Lathion, ? Nasjonalgalleriet) scenic spots of Paris, albeit an area the visitor entered with caution. Honore de Balzac, too, had described it in Lafemme de trente ans: There exists a perspective worthy of ravishing the most blase artist or traveler with the pleasures of its view. .. You have before you, at your feet, a deep valley peopled with rustic factories, scattered with greenery, irrigated by the brown waters of the Bievre or the Gobelins. On the opposite slope, some thousands of rooftops pressed to- gether like heads in a crowd harbor the miseries of the Faubourg Saint-Marceau.31 As historian Gerard Conte writes, Parisians in the 1860s referred to the Thirteenth Arrondissement as "the faubourg of misery." Indeed, some 15,000 indigents from 5,000 house- holds registered with the Welfare Bureau of the Thirteenth Arrondissement during the winter of 1868-69.32 Synonymous with poverty, the arrondissement had been the site of the peregrinations of Jean Valjean and Cosette in Hugo's Les miserables.33 Almost a century earlier, Louis-Sebastien Merci- er's Tableau de Paris of 1782 had memorialized the faubourg St-Marcel (or St-Marceau) as populated not by Parisians- who lived in style on the banks of the Seine-but by people who were three centuries behind them in terms of culture and manners; by people whose private problems were broad- cast in public rows; by those whose discussions always ended with the parties coming to blows. An entire family lived in one room, Mercier claimed, "where kitchen utensils rolled about with the chamber pot," where it was not so surprising if people had hardly any possessions, "for every three months the inhabitants changed holes, since they were being pursued for defaulting on the rent."34 It was, in other words, the place romanticized in Baudelaire's "Le vin des chiffonniers," even if the poet himself lived in furnished rooms in the more civilized neighborhoods. In order to consider the possible links between Manet's painting and the notion of a homage to Baudelaire, we should begin with a consideration of Manet's art after the eventful summer of 1867. Spring had witnessed his lavish, self-financed solo show in a pavilion on the Pont de l'Alma at the time of the Universal Exposition. The larger spectacle had occa- sioned Manet's marvelous panorama of the fairgrounds, A View of the Universal Exposition, 1867, now in Oslo (Fig. 9). Like the 1862 work La musique aux Tuileries, Manet's painting of the exposition contains fully realized figures, including the recog- nizable figure of Leon Koalla, called Leenhoff, the son of Manet's wife Suzanne Leenhoff; he is seen walking a large dog. The exposition structures and towers are rendered with definition but in a rather casual, sketchlike style. It is the looseness of this style that emphasizes the transience of the fairgrounds. By contrast, the separations between the more defined clusters of figures describe a kind of sociability in which visitors to the exposition toured it with their friends yet retained a certain anonymity and distance from the larger crowd of strangers. Other commentators have noted a stylistic similarity between the panoramic Universal Exposition and The Burial. Manet's solo show contained about fifty canvases, and his pavilion was adjacent to the structure housing Courbet's second solo exhibition, which displayed more than twice that number of works; Courbet had at first planned an exhibition of some three hundred paintings.35 This discrepancy points to the way the younger artist would have seen himself at this crucial juncture. On the one hand, Manet was already being recognized as the leader of a new school of painting; he was being defended in the press by the likes of Emile Zola. On the other hand, Manet cannot have failed to be impressed, and somewhat awed, by Courbet's massive achievement. It is not surprising to find Manet's political juices flowing again that summer, and to find him taking on the subject of the execution of Maximilian-the story of Napoleon III's with- drawal of French forces and the subsequent execution, by order of the revolutionary leader Benito Juirez, of the emperor's half brother Maximilian in Mexico (Fig. 10). Manet was told in advance of the Salon of 1868 that his painting on the subject would not be accepted, and his</page><page sequence="7">74 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 1 10 Manet, The Execution of Maximilian, oil on canvas, 1868. Mannheim, Stfidtische Kunsthalle Baudelaire but already written by Poe twenty years earlier. Baudelaire had long admired Goya's work; he referred to its demonic aspects in Lesfleurs du mal and composed a quatrain to accompany Manet's Lola de Valence, a painting with a distinct relationship to Goya's portrait of the duchess of Alba.40 It is not surprising, then, to find that Manet may have had Goya in mind in the execution of The Burial. Yriarte's book included a reproduction of Goya's The Meadows of San Isidro, a small canvas that Manet would have had the opportunity to view on his trip to the Prado in 1865 (Fig. 11).41 The painting shows some festivities on the banks of the Manzanares River, and a panoramic view of Madrid serves as the backdrop. Manet surely admired the mixture of colorful incident and conversation among the foreground figure groupings and the silvery silhouettes of the city's spires and domes against the sky. In comparison with Goya's Meadows, a sketch for a tapestry that was never made, Manet's The Burial pulls the background elements forward toward the picture plane, a 11 Morin, after Francisco de Goya, The Meadows of San Isidro, engraving, from Charles Yriarte, Goya, 1867 lithographic stone after the painting was seized and almost effaced.36 It is well known that Manet's later versions of The Execution of Maximilian are heavily indebted to Francisco de Goya's anti-Bonapartist The Third of May, 1808, of 1814, and that Manet's friend Charles Yriarte had just come out with a monograph on Goya in April 1867 that included an engraving of the painting.37 In the last months of Baudelaire's life in the summer of 1867, it had been a book on Goya that remained one of the few pleasures enjoyed by the aphasic poet.38 The most detailed account of Manet's art ever written by Baude- laire was an 1864 letter to Theophile Thore in the newspaper L'Indipendance Belge which protested Thore's critique of Ma- net as a pasticheur of Velazquez and Goya.39 "The word 'pastiche' is unjust. M. Manet has never seen Goya," Baude- laire had written, and later, "So much has been said about his 'pastiches' of Goya that now he is endeavoring to see some works of Goya." The letter is deservedly famous for Baude- laire's description of his own relationship with Edgar Allan Poe, and his discovery of actual "phrases" conceived by device typical of Manet's work in general and The Execution of Maximilian in particular. Stylistically, The Burial appears to combine the loose notation of cityscape visible in the Universal Exposition with the handling of space typical of the Execution, which would suggest that the painting is from the same period-late 1867 or early 1868. If Goya and contemporary politics were important touch- stones for Manet in late 1867, then so was Courbet. Among the large canvases on view in Courbet's independent exhibi- tion was once again his Burial at Ornans of 1849-50 (Fig. 12). The painting, which is over twenty-three feet long and includes some four dozen life-size figures, remained the kind of definitive statement that could practically stand for Cour- bet's representational project. Recent research by Claudette Mainzer suggests that the precise subject for Courbet's paint- ing is the burial of Courbet's relative Claude-Etienne Teste- the first burial to take place in a new cemetery outside the town of Ornans in 1848.42 It may well have been known in artistic circles, if not evident to the nineteenth-century French viewer, that the cemetery in Courbet's painting was</page><page sequence="8">UNFINISHED HOMAGE: MANET'S BURIAL AND BAUDELAIRE 75 12 Gustave Courbet, Burial at Ornans, oil on canvas, 1849-50. Paris, Mus~e d'Orsay (photo: R6union des Musees Nationaux-D. Arnaudet) outside the town limits. Concern over the merits of cemeter- ies inside and outside city limits was a major point in the positivist debates on burials in the period. If seeing Courbet's Burial at Ornans again, in the context of two decades of Courbet's painting, played a role in prompting Manet to meditate on the great Realist subject of burials, Manet's The Burial reads as the opposite of the earlier painting. Whereas the Burial at Ornans revels in the manners and details of provincial life, Manet's Burial offers no close- ups and is resolutely Parisian. Courbet's painting is epic; Manet's is small-scale. Courbet earthily depicts the digging of the grave; Manet represents a cortege, not necessarily meant to be seen in the context of the cemetery, but en route. And Courbet's painting shows the Ornanais finally adopting the custom Paris had embraced a half century earlier, namely burial outside the city limits. Manet, by contrast, seems to want the city to frame and enclose the site of the funeral procession. His decision to show the city's deliberate embrace of the cortege probably had its source in another political issue that flared in 1867. Ci git tue par M. Haussmann Roi de Paris Sous le regne de Napoleon III le culte des parisiens pour leurs morts (Here lies/ killed by M. Haussmann/ King of Paris/ Under the reign of Napoleon III/ The Parisians' cult of their dead.) So went Xavier Feyrnet's satire on a notable controversy in Paris from 1867 until well after the fall of the Second Empire: Baron Haussmann's plan to build a necropolis over nineteen miles from Paris at Mery-sur-Oise, near Pontoise.43 In the end, the necropolis was never built. At the height of the debate, however, the project was emblematic of what many Parisians perceived as the cold efficiency of Haussmann's attitudes toward every aspect of life in the city.44 The writer in the 1867 Paris-Guide quoted Haussmann as saying matter-of-factly, "There are few sepulchres that are not abandoned after forty years."45 Haussmann's interest in long-range planning made him consider the fate of the rapidly filling three major Paris cemeteries: Montmartre, Montparnasse, and Pere-Lachaise. These cemeteries themselves represented solutions to the problems of full parish cemeteries; less than a century before, Paris had had a network of some two hundred cemeteries, many of which were closed or built over by the later nine- teenth century, if they had not become casualties of Hauss- mann's new boulevards.46 (All that was left of the famed Clamart cemetery, burial place of the comte de Mirabeau and Restif de la Bretonne, for instance, were a few weathered, leaning gravestones; an amphitheater of anatomy had been built on the spot, and the boulevard St-Marcel enlarged right over it.47) Haussmann decided that a parcel of land of appropriate size could only be had outside the city. As some historians of Haussmann's renovations have related, once the decision had been made to build a cemetery accessible only by train, a few more kilometers did not seem to make much difference.48 Before Haussmann approached the Municipal Council in 1866, he had already sounded out his plan with the mayor of MWry, a small community some thirteen miles northwest of Paris. By the time the plan became known to the public in April 1867, it had passed several early stages toward its approval. The Municipal Commission made its deliberations on March 23, 1866, and the plan had become an approved order of the prefect on January 28, 1867.49 It was announced that the Parisian cemeteries of the Batignolles and Montmar- tre/St-Ouen would be closed as of April 1, 1867.50 These were, incidentally, the cemetery in Manet's immediate neighbor- hood and the cemetery where his father had been buried in 1862, respectively. There was an immediate outcry. The notion of the bodies of loved ones being laid to rest far from ancestors and survivors was difficult to accept. The administration tried to convince the public that special hourly train service would be established, with extra trains on Sundays and holidays such as All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day. Assurances were given that the trains would be discreetly divided, with compartments for the bodies and compartments for mourners; that trips would be subsidized for the indigent; that the service would be adjusted according to demand. The simple funeral cortege from church to burial ground, it seemed, would soon become a thing of the past. "We have no parti pris, no preconceived hostility against the Prefect's project," said Louis Jourdan in Le Siecle, "but it</page><page sequence="9">76 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 1 seems to us difficult to imagine that in such circumstances and with a matter so grave, which so touches the intimate sentiment of the population, that the feelings of repugnance, the wishes of the public, would not be taken seriously into account."51 Workers would be hardest hit if the new cemetery were built, argued Feyrnet, as they would have to take the entire day off from work to make thejourney. 52 Charles Blanc, a resident of Mary's neighboring community of Mont- morency, queried whether it was legal for the prefect of Paris to impose the Parisian dead on another dipartement; he also wondered about the cemetery becoming a kind of morbid tourist attraction.53 He was not alone in his thinking. MWry stood to profit handsomely from the number of visitors from Paris streaming into town on a daily basis, and most likely staying long enough to patronize local establishments. Three neighboring communities joined in MWry's endorsement of the idea, but they were opposed by seventeen surrounding towns that "energetically opposed" the project, principally on the grounds that they were disturbed by the spectacle of the "train of the dead" full of corpses and mourners that would cross their communities.54 Property values were natu- rally a concern. The motives of the project's opponents were no more admirable than those of its backers. As Michel Ragon has shown, the anti-Meary campaign waged by Le Sizcle aimed to support the Commission d'Assurances Generales, which owned the neighboring Montmorency forest and had an interest in railway concessions in the area.55 The most vociferous critique of the cemetery project was launched by Victor Fournel in Le Correspondant; it was two years later but the idea was still afloat in the administration.56 He conjured a vivid scenario whereby coffins would be stamped, numbered, and stacked forty in a compartment for the journey to their final resting place. He meticulously described what a burial at MWry would actually entail for mourners: there would first be the departure for the mortu- ary house, from there to the church, from there to the Parisian cemetery for the rest of the Paris ceremony; from the Paris cemetery, mourners would make their way to the railway station, then change trains to gain access to the cemetery train at Montmartre, then undertake the trip from Montmar- tre to MWry, and finally, walk from the loading platforms to the (sizable) necropolis to the gravesite and back.57"' He was right to point out that for the family members of the deceased, the issue was not the alleged twenty-five-minute train trip to MWry, but rather the whole series of necessary voyages and periods of waiting in-between, which were in themselves so taxing and time-consuming that the bodies eventually would seem like cumbersome parcels. Fournel railed against Haussmann's proposal, which would consign the bodies of loved ones to a "faraway, vast, glacial and funereal Siberia," whereas the same administration did not spare expense when it came to laying out a new boulevard, building a glittering opera house, or creating a garden out of the Buttes Chaumont.58 The govern- ment declared its grands projets to be democratic, argued Fournel, and in the process had remade Paris into a city of boulevards, caffs, barracks, and luxury stores, while the doubling and tripling rents had forced workers to the outskirts.59 Fournel's lengthy and thoughtful attack followed years of oppositional writings to "Haussmannization." His points, and those of his contemporaries, fell in line with their concerns about the rapid changes being wrought on the city and the fortunes being made by speculators who were let in early on the MWry land option, like so many other grand schemes for the city. What remained in many ways an unspoken fear, hidden beneath the professed concerns about the city, the worker, and the difficult journey, was the social nature of the train trip itself. At a time of profound grief, when mourners formerly would have been surrounded exclusively by family, friends, clergy, and parishioners, now they would be forced to stand on waiting platforms and to sit in train compartments opposite strangers who were accompanying a different body or visiting another grave. To the average nineteenth-century person, still unaccustomed to mass public transportation, such a situation was disconcerting enough when the object was travel for pleasure. The project did have its supporters. The official newspapers sang its praises. Le Constitutionnel pointed out that the provin- cial farmer who moved to Paris did not miss his village cemetery. In the early 1860s, LUon Vafflard, funeral contrac- tor for the city of Paris, had criticized the English reliance on trains and cemeteries outside the London periphery.60 When he realized that the construction and maintenance of the vast new necropolis would mean a boom for the funeral business, he published a pamphlet that cheered for the end of the shared, unmarked grave and embraced the "cemetery of the future."6' One Le Docteur Favrot gave his stamp of approval, and did what he could to emphasize the democratic ticket pricing and the free tickets for the poor.62 Haussmann, for his part, expressed his concern that the poor as well as the rich deserved a dignified rest-if not eternal, then one that was reasonably long. There were sentiments to echo his, like that of Jules Noriac in the Paris-Guide, who also argued that the demise of the common grave would represent a step forward in the name of equality.63 Since railways were already used by the wealthy to transport bodies to distant cemeteries, rea- soned Councillor Barbier during the deliberations of a commission on the MWry proposal, Haussmann's plan was simply extending this luxury to the rest of the population.64 Michel Ragon has demonstrated the irony of this type of argument at a time when almost two-thirds of the funeral processions were provided free by the city to those who could not afford them.65 The fracas in the newspapers was to be expected, but the real opposition to the Mary cemetery was the result of a more complex synergy. As Philippe Aries has persuasively argued, the MWry project created an unusual alliance between Catho- lics and positivists.66 Whereas Catholic tradition in earlier periods had deemphasized the importance of the body itself, the nineteenth century witnessed the development of a "cult of the dead," with ceremonial visits to the grave, epitaphs, and renewable as well as perpetual grave concessions. Catho- lics accustomed to these practices could not imagine that these were relatively new trends. With their newfound attach- ment to the nearby graves of loved ones and their opposition to the futuristic necropolis, they ironically found a sympa- thetic partner in the positivists, whose tenets more often than not were directly at odds with religion and mysticism of all kinds. Positivists such as Pierre Laffitte, reports Aries, em- braced the latest scientific studies to suggest that burial within</page><page sequence="10">UNFINISHED HOMAGE: MANET'S BURIAL AND BAUDELAIRE 77 13 Henri Fantin-Latour, Hommage a Delacroix, oil on canvas, 1864. Paris, Mus"e d'Orsay (photo: R6union des Musees Nationaux-Herve Lewandowski) city limits was not unsanitary after all. The soil provided a natural filter against disease, and a cemetery with ample air circulation-hence one in a windy area with enough surround- ing trees, they theorized-should pose no health threat to its neighbors. When the administration of the Third Republic was continuing to consider the Mary proposal and issuing new official reports on the plan, Laffitte, the self-proclaimed "director of positivism," and his fellow positivists addressed the municipal council of Paris to declare their unequivocal opposition to the Mary necropolis.67 Whether one fancied oneself traditional and religious or scientific and progressive, then, it was easy to take a stand against the project. Manet came from a distinguished family with ties to Paris and the nearby canton of Gennevilliers. He was, like most of the French population, Catholic by upbringing, as well as reasonably sympathetic with modern positivism; he lived what Zola called "the well-ordered life of a bourgeois."68 In 1867 he was courting controversy with his work on the Maximilian affair and, as a result, was facing certain government censor- ship. His general opposition to the Mary proposal-and, as a Parisian, his newly politicized response to the subjects of cemeteries and burials-can reasonably be surmised. The relationship between Manet and Baudelaire remains both an old chestnut of Manet studies and an aspect of Manet's development that is so fundamental and so formative that it is often inadequately addressed. It is neither an overstatement of Baudelaire's poetic innovation nor an under- statement of Manet's power and originality as a painter to say that many of Manet's greatest paintings in the early 1860s would be unthinkable without Baudelaire. On the level of subject matter, Baudelaire's bitter and exquisite portraits of the poor and the marginalized provided complex precedents for Manet's gypsies, prostitutes, and chiffonniers. On another level, too, which might be described as one of artistic collaboration, the relationship between Baudelaire and Ma- net became a kind of constant, of which Manet sought an equivalent after Baudelaire's death. Aspects of their relation- ship appear to be echoed in Manet's subsequent friendships with Zola-whose subject matter continued in Baudelaire's vein-and then with St6phane Mallarme, whose formal inno- vations and aestheticism further pushed the Baudelairean boundaries of poetic language.69 If Manet had wanted to do a painting that was in some way about Baudelaire's death, there were some things the paint- ing simply could not be. For one thing, the painting-it must have seemed-could not be a collection of recognizable members of the Parisian literary world. Manet had painted the social circle of his family and his artist friends in La musique aux Tuileries, but that had been five years earlier. In the meantime, Henri Fantin-Latour had become the painter of the 1864 Hommage a Delacroix (Fig. 13), which included Manet and Baudelaire, and Le toast, another group painting, which Fantin later destroyed.70 When Fantin was readying the latter for the Salon of 1865, Manet wrote to Baudelaire: "Fantin is doing a toast to truth and of course it's his friends who are making it. I think he's got more blows in store for us."71 By 1865, to paint the circle of Manet and Fantin was to invite more criticism for the group. Similarly, a painting done in the manner of Courbet's The Painter's Studio (Fig. 14) would have been anathema to Manet's style and inappropriate as well, when one considered the distance that had arisen between Baudelaire and Courbet in the years after their shared sympathies in the 1848 Revolution.72 (Such an image can be conjured easily enough: a gathering in a cemetery with the likes of Charles Asselineau, Theodore de Banville, and Manet on one side, and an assortment of ragpickers and exotic figures on the other.) Somehow, the difficulty of Baudelaire's last years-his financial hardships, his exile in Belgium, his erratic production, his aphasia and paralysis- must have mitigated against the thought of a celebrity-filled gathering as a fitting tribute. There would have been the more documentary possibility of a picture depicting the Montparnasse cemetery, but that, too, had its drawbacks. For all Manet's interest in Paris, he rarely engaged in literal transcriptions. It should be recalled that he titled his portrait of Philibert Rouviere as Hamlet The Tragic Actor in order to avoid the critique that it did not adequately resemble Rouviere, and in the Street Singer he</page><page sequence="11">78 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 1 14 Courbet, The Painter's Studio, oil on canvas, 1854-55. Paris, Mus&amp;e d'Orsay (photo: R6union des Mus&amp;es Nationaux) substituted his model Victorine Meurent for the real street singer who caught his eye. 73 Manet may not have wanted to sketch in the vicinity of the grave itself. And then there was the problem of the grave: it was next to that of Baudelaire's stepfather, General Jacques Aupick, to whom Baudelaire had not spoken for decades. 74No doubt it was the proper thing to bury the son of Caroline Aupick in the grave beside that of her husband, with his distinguished record of service to France under several administrations. But a close friend who sympathized strongly with Baudelaire's sufferings under the stepfather who did not understand his literary pursuits, who had unwittingly interposed himself between the seven-year- old boy and his mother, who tried to straighten out the unruly young man with a sea voyage to India, who saw to it that Baudelaire spent his life begging for his monthly allowance from a notary in Neuilly-in all likelihood such a close friend as Manet saw things differently. Manet probably knew of the pain Baudelaire felt over his father's temporary grave in Montparnasse and could not have found the Aupick grave to be a suitable spot for commemorating the poet's death. The idea of a painting that in some way memorialized Baudelaire would be more meaningful if its referent were both allusive and elusive. Not the Cimetiere de Montparnasse; not the elegant apartment on the Ile St-Louis or one of dozens of shabby temporary furnished rooms where Baude- laire had lived; not the clinic near the Arc de Triomphe where Baudelaire languished in his last few months, uttered scarcely a word, and pushed away books he was unable to read. No recognizable literary figures, family, and friends: they in a sense had not managed to do enough for him, to pay his debts, to recognize his achievement. Instead, Manet would paint a small, elegant cortege making its way across a meadow: a spot where the monuments of the city became a kind of curtain or backdrop, a spot that was known both for its spectacular beauty and for the squalor around it. Au coeur d'un vieux faubourg, labyrinthe fangeux O i l'humanit6 grouille en ferments orageux, On voit un chiffonnier qui vient, hochant la t&amp;te, Buttant, et se cognant aux murs comme un po&amp;te, Et, sans prendre souci des mouchards, ses sujets, Epanche tout son coeur en glorieux projets.75 (out of the muddy labyrinth of streets/ teeming with unruly, sordid types,/ a ragpicker stumbles past, wagging his head/ and bumping into walls with a poet's grace,/ pouring out his heartfelt schemes to one/ and all, including spies of the police.) "Le vin des chiffonniers" recalls the labyrinthine streets of the faubourg St-Marcel, that neighborhood Mercier had described as one where "insurrections and rebellions have their hidden origins in this dark seat of poverty [ les siditions et les mutineries ont leur origine cachke dans ce foyer de la misere obscure] ."76 It regards the chiffonnieras a poet who spills out his imaginative projects to passersby and to police spies; it also describes the poet as chiffonnier: he is a social outcast for whom alcohol is a medium of imagination and revolt.77 The territory of the chiffonniers might be an appropriate spot for a painting in honor of Baudelaire. Manet had often enough painted le chiffonnier-philosophe, life-size against a plain background. Yet another painting of a chiffonnierwould not in itself constitute a suitable hommage. Baudelaire may have written "Le vin des chiffonniers" and the troubling prose poems "Assommons les pauvres!" and "Les yeux des pau- vres," but Baudelaire styled himself as a dandy. If the painting in one sense ought to remind the viewer of the lives of those beyond the barrieres, in another sense it needed to do so in an understated and elegant way; it could not just grimly and vividly depict a shantytown. The twin events of Manet's solo show at the Pont de l'Alma and Baudelaire's death in 1867 very likely caused him to reflect on the extent to which he had already explored Baudelairean subjects in his own way. Manet</page><page sequence="12">UNFINISHED HOMAGE: MANET'S BURIAL AND BAUDELAIRE 79 had depicted his own ragpickers, his own Spanish dancers, his own impassive prostitute with black servant and black cat, his own gypsies and beggars and street musicians, his vieux saltimbanque.78 What could lie in Baudelaire's death that could be made into a painting? J' tais comme l'enfant avide du spectacle, Haissant le rideau comme on hait un obstacle Enfin la verite froide se reve1a: J' tais mort sans surprise, et la terrible aurore M'enveloppait.-Eh quoi! n'est-ce donc que cela? La toile etait lev&amp;e etj'attendais encore.79 (I was like a child in front of a stage,/ hating the curtain as if it were in the way . ./ Finally the cold truth was revealed:/ I had simply died, and the terrible dawn/ enveloped me. Could this be all there is?/ The curtain was up, and I was waiting still.) As expressed in "Le rave d'un curieux," a poem dedicated to their mutual friend Nadar, the specter of ennui was the shadow of the specter of death, and it threatened the paintings Manet conceived in and around the subject of the poet's death. The same can be said for a painting that gave too much over to the cult of the dead. Manet could no more have painted an ex-voto ia la Alphonse Legros than a painting of luminaries from the literary world. Had Manet perhaps already painted his tribute to Baude- laire-the first seven years of his artistic life? It is arguable that Manet found himself moving in a new direction in late 1867, away from the overtly Baudelairean subjects; yet the occasion of Baudelaire's death suggested a finality about that project that was not something that could be definitively represented, much less objectively recorded. Perhaps Baudelaire's think- ing, his fleurs du mal, his poemes en prose were so embedded in Manet's notion of his own work that Baudelaire's death could only give rise to a painting that had to remain unfinished and unresolved. To finish it would be to close the book on too much that had already become part of Manet's own practice. If in his painting The Burial Manet rejected the possibilities of picturing such modes as the cult of the dead, the sentimen- tal visit to the grave, the epic funeral, and the homage of the literary world, Manet nevertheless insisted on a certain view of Paris. In the late 1860s, his picture would have expressed to Parisians a very site-specific view from the outskirts, from the terrains vagues inhabited by the chiffonniers; at the same time the painting is not a picture ofragpickers or of squalor. It is a picture whose intimacy is aimed against the Haussmannized burial of the future. It is a rough, unfinished painting suggestive of a city that is being remade. It is, finally, a painting that is not a retrospective on Manet's own Baude- lairean years: it is a painting in the present tense.80 It is a landscape. Baudelaire, too, had created a "Landscape." When the second edition of Baudelaire's Les fleurs du mal was brought out in 1861, it included a section of new poems called "Tableaux parisiens." The first poem in the new section, "Paysage" (Landscape), begins: Je veux, pour composer chastement mes eglogues, Coucher aupres du ciel, comme les astrologues, Et, voisin des clochers, &amp;couter en revant Leurs hymnes solennels emportes par le vent. Les deux mains au menton, du haut de ma mansarde, Je verrai l'atelier qui chante et qui bavarde; Les tuyaux, les clochers, ces m^ts de la cite, Et les grands ciels qui font rover d' ternit&amp;.81 (I want, in order to compose my eclogues properly/ To sleep close to the sky, like the astrologers,/ And, neighbor of the steeples, to listen, while dreaming/ To their solemn hymns carried by the wind./ My chin in my hands, from the height of my garret,/ I will see the workshop which sings and chatters,/ The chimneys, the steeples, these masts of the city/ And the great skies which make one dream of eternity.) As Christopher Prendergast observes, the poem "works from, but also transforms, a stereotype: the view over the rooftops of Paris from the poet's garret."82 Prendergast notes the poem's unusual lack of irony in dealing with the old staple of the poet's stance, chin in hand, at the window. If there are references to the ateliers that might be connected to the disappearing vieux Paris or to remnants of the culture of workers' protests, these have been made to harmonize with an incipient "nature," an idealized city. Prendergast reads the poem as a kind of modern pastoral, as a reworking of the imagery of the city, its chimneys and steeples, into an eclogue; the poet "exploit[s] the view from the attic in order to reinvent the eclogue in and for a modern context."83 The poem conjures up images of repose and of dreaming while looking into the skies, while listening to the wind. These reveries are punctuated by the noise of the city, of the workshop that sings and chatters; yet the steeples and chim- neys of human and industrial activity also become the familiar "masts" that in turn evoke the Baudelairean "invitation au voyage."''84 A Baudelairean eclogue, one might conclude, would necessarily be a dialogue with the city that simulta- neously makes possible an escape from it; Baudelaire would never himself have written a hymn to nature.85 In Lesfleurs du mal and in Le spleen de Paris, however, he often reveled in the idea of being cloaked in some sort of canopy-whether that of the city's crowds, its twilit skies, its fogs and mists, or that of his lover's mane of hair.86 These environmental shrouds were what provided the fldneur's sought-after anonymity and en- abled his particular intensity of sensual experience. The steeples and chimneys and noisy workshops of Baude- laire's cityscape are not specific. His representations of urban</page><page sequence="13">80 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 1 15 The Burial, detail of observer, lower right (photo: Christopher Campbell) squalor in "Le vin des chiffonniers" or of an industrial pastoral in "Paysage" are achieved through the dissonant incorporation of aspects of modernity into a harmonic poetic project.87 By contrast, Victor Hugo in Les mishables had described the nearby Champ de l'Alouette by emulating the newspaper crime story, by referring to the quartier's land- marks as indices of the sordid and criminal affairs for which it was known. And a further example, Balzac's description of the view from the Butte-aux-Cailles in La femme de trente ans connects the panorama of the Left Bank and the "faubourg souffrant" with a view of Pere-Lachaise and the thought of the city beyond as a resting place. For Balzac, the specific location of the peaceful riverbanks gives way to a scene of melodrama as a child is pushed into the mud of the Bievre. Manet would have wanted enough site-specificity that his painting carried the pungency of Baudelaire's language without making it into a tableau identifiable with Les mishables or yesterday's newspaper. In the painting, as the cortege crosses the landscape, it moves from the dense elevation of the grove at left to the green of the meadow at right. The heavy impasto of the grove obscures the legibility of trunks and ground. Out of this thicket of paint the cortege enters an area almost enclosed by the curving yellow band of the Bievre; the meadow itself becomes an oval, almost like an arena or amphitheater.88 That Manet might have intended a subtle effect of theatricalizing the movement and location of the cortege is suggested by the presence of an observer who watches the funeral procession (Fig. 15). Hand on hip, the hatted, crisply painted figure stands apart from the line of mourners, and from the pallbearer who attends to the funeral carriage. His experience of the funeral emblematizes what Carl Schorske has described as the modern, Baudelairean experience of the city as a succession of fleeting moments: "The modern city offered an eternal hic et nunc, whose content was transience, but whose transience was perma- nent."89 In Manet's painting there is both a particular and resonant description of the city and an almost casual incom- pleteness. The picture's power rests on the juxtaposition of a view well known to Parisians and a quality of deliberate unfinish that can be understood within the framework of mourning: refusing the monumental, refusing the elegiac.90 Its unfinish quite possibly suggests that Manet's homage to Baudelaire would not end there.

Louis Chevalier, in Laboring Classes and Dangerous Classes in Paris during the First Half of the Nineteenth Century, trans. F. Jellinek (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973), 83-93, 101-4, devotes considerable attention to the faubourg's appearance in the work of Balzac and Hugo; he also analyzes the 1832 move of the site of public executions from the place de Gr&amp;ve to the Barriere St-Jacques in the Thirteenth Arrondissement, not far from the site under consideration here. In the Hugo passage mentioned above, the Champ de l'Alouette is immediately identified as the site of the murder of the goat woman of Ivry. Chevalier presents a convincing case that the neighborhood had a reputation for being a "setting of crime" as well as the setting of executions. See also Montguerre (as in n. 16), 182-87. 34.

The complex story of Manet's series of paintings and prints is concisely told in Juliet Wilson-Bareau, "Manet and The Execution of Maximilian," in Manet: The Execution of Maximilian; Painting, Politics and Censorship (London: National Gallery, 1992), 35-85.

For an analysis of the MWry project in the context of burial practices and attitudes, see Aries, 539-42.

Thus the title ofJacques Hillairet, Les 200 cimeti res du vieux Paris (Paris: Minuit, 1958); Maxime Du Camp writes of the "twenty-two cemeteries," 661. For precise information on decrees, dates of operation, and number of burials in the smaller cemeteries, see Henri Lemoine, "Les cimetiYres de Paris, 1760-1825," Bulletin de la Socidte de l'Histoire de Paris et de lI'le-de-France 51 (1924): 78-102. 47. In Du Camp's study, he states that the remains of Mirabeau had been taken there directly from the Pantheon. By the early 20th century, this was seriously doubted: see the Marquis de Rochegude and Maurice Dumolin, Guide pratique c travers le vieux Paris (Paris: Champion, 1923), 446. According to Hillairet (as in n. 46), 247, the amphitheater of anatomy dates to 1833. 48. See the account, which is rather biased toward Haussmann, in J. M.

Blanc's statement about the legality of the proposal had already been debated in the Municipal Council of Bessancourt. Victor Fournel reported that in Aug. 1867 the council had unanimously voted that it was neither legal nor right for one commune to establish its cemetery on the territory of another commune; see Fournel, 372-73. 54. Le Sidcle, Sept. 12, 1867, 3C. According to the paper, MWry and its immediate neighbors Villiers-Adam, MWriel, and Fr6pillon endorsed the proposal. Against it were Ermont, Plessis-Bouchard, Enghien, St-Gratien, St-Leu, Taverny, Napoleon-St-Leu, Montmorency, St-Prix, Franconville, Deuil, Montlignon, Andilly, Chauvry, Margency, Cormeilles-en-Parisis, and Pierlaye.

Baudelaire, 95. 82. Prendergast, 60. 83. Ibid., 62. 84. Ibid. 85. See, for instance, his very pointed letter to Fernand Desnoyers, undated, of 1855: "You are asking me for verse for your little volume-some verse on Nature, is that right? [. . .] But you know very well that I am incapable of being moved by plants ... [ Vous me demandez des vers pour votre petit volume, des vers sur la Nature, n'est-ce pas ? (.. .) Mais, vous savez bien queje suis incapable de m'attendrir sur les vigetaux (. ..)]," Baudelaire (as in n. 39), vol. 1 (1947), 321-23. 86. This aspect of Baudelaire's imagery has been commented on frequently; I have in mind such poems as "Le crepuscule du soir" ("Voici le soir charmant, ami du criminel;/ II vient comme un complice, A pas de loup; le ciel/ Se ferme lentement comme une grande alc6ve,/ Et l'homme impatient se change en bate fauve" [It comes as an accomplice, stealthily,/ the lovely hour that is the felon's friend;/ the sky, like curtains round a bed, draws close,/ and man prepares to become a beast of prey], trans. Howard (as in n. 75), 99; and "La chevelure," as well as the prose poems "La chambre double" and "Les foules." One could cite many other examples. 87. Prendergast, 27, in particular speaks of Baudelaire's confrontation with the "discords and dissonances of the modern city" and "the tension between the poetic endeavor and the recalcitrance of the urban reality with which it engages." 88. This shape appears to have inspired the conjecture of Sterling and Salinger that the location may have been the Arena of Lutetia, the Roman amphitheater excavated during the Haussmannian dig for the rue Monge in 1869. See Sterling and Salinger (as in n. 10), 44. The amphitheater is too close to the Panth6on to offer a view of the other monuments. 89. Schorske (as in n. 80), 49-50. 90. Paul de Man, in "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," contrasts Baudelaire's "Obsession" and "Correspondances," and discusses the notion of "mourning" in terms of the "non-elegiac, non-celebratory, non-lyrical, non-poetic." See the essay in Charles Baudelaire, ed. Harold Bloom (NewYork: Chelsea House, 1987), 125-42.</page></plain_text>
