<plain_text><page sequence="1">STOCKS AND BONDS: PANTHEISM AND THE CHAIN OF BEING IN THE AMERICAN RENAISSANCE Richard Hardack "Let him loosen one moment the invisible link which binds atom to atom which we call cohesion-what makes one particle of granite adhere without cement to another particle of granite .... Or let snap the chain by which creation holds .... Loose the etheral cord and how would each orb start from its path into a lawless track .... into pure destruction of all life." Emerson, Sermon LXXXIX1 AGAINST THE BACKDROP of a fractured mid-nineteenth-century American religious and social order, a literal pantheism poses the hope or pretense of a reconciliation of Protestant Christianity with its rival sects, and all sections of society with one another. As Louisa Cohen suggests in Pantheism, echoing the sentiments of many nineteenth-century pantheist apologists, "there is a growing feeling of brotherhood amongst the churches which are fain to accept the universal bond of religion in face of the common enemy, indifference or atheism."2 In this American context, pantheism manages to syncretize egali- tarianism and individualism, Catholicism and Protestantism, universal laws with their transcendence. Most nineteenth-century American pantheists, at least of the tract-writing variety, self-consciously conceive of their position as promoting all inclusive reconciliation. But in the grammars of the church and the state, brotherhood remains an Old Testament relationship, one producing divisions and hierarchy in its very rhetoric of unification: as Cohen continues, "men are told they are part of God ... that they are just fractions of the great whole. ... that all men are brothers."3 (As Emerson and Melville discover, the shibboleths of pantheism are always full of ambiguities, chronometricals and horologicals, unifications which are partitions.) Pantheism itself has traditionally been per- ceived as a kind of masonic brotherhood, arcane, fraternal, and secret. In Pantheisticon, published in England in 1751, John Toland proposes that 21</page><page sequence="2">22 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 "Pantehists can deservedly be stiled the priests and hierophants of Nature; for as formerly as the Druids, Men of an elevated Genius, kept up the Authority of their brotherly Union," so do the members of this new "Socratic Society" practice virtue and prosletyze others to their brotherhood.4 Pantheism provides first and foremost a brotherly union, a model of nature based on universal, yet still secret, correspondence, a ubiquitous chain of being available solely to learned men. Though still essentially masonic, American pantheists tend to envision a universal, egalitarian chain of being-a taxonomy of a uniformly divine nature, and a form of literal connection between all men and all forces of nature. The legacy of the religious conception of the chain of being is then taken up by American pantheists as a familiar language to express their conceptual concerns. Attempting to recast the hierarchic chain of being at the heart of Puritanism, American pantheists ascribe an anthropomorphic and animistic sensibility to the non-human and the inanimate. I wish to argue that in America the chain of social being reflects and is reflected by the disposition of the natural chain of being, in all its facets. The instability of the self in the American Renaissance determines, and is deter- mined by, the instability of matter in Transcendentalism's conceptions of natural science; Transcendentalists envision an increasingly destabilizing mutability of beings along an erstwhile hierarchic chain. The social restraints and instabilities of the self are corroborated by the physical parameters attributed to the natural world. In part, Lovejoy's standard formulation of the chain, similarly a chain of the animate and inanimate, also places all matter, configured as universally representative and transformable, in universal correspondence. The pantheist version of this model implicitly transforms the hierarchic ladder into a horizon- tal chain. Attempts to forward pantheistic or "preterite" democracy would redefine human social and political hierarchies in connection to what they are defined against-the natural, the animal, and the divine. Hence, Melville often castigates American patriotic and political institutions from a "naturalized" perspective, invoking a comparison to god or nature: "that democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God; Himselfl The Great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all democracy!"5 Tocqueville sug- gested that "Aristocracy had made a chain of all the members of the community, from the peasant to the king; democracy breaks that chain and severs every link of it."6 As staged in Moby-Dick, democracy's broken chains can only be reforged through the tyrannical pantheistic fusions of Ahab, or the mystical pantheistic fusions of Ishmael; each in his way forges unbreakable chains to other characters aboard ship. (Ahab is explicitly considered to have few thoughts of Pan, and so is anti-pantheistic, yet his manner of controlling his ship by welding men to his body, his obsession with body parts stolen from him by a silent but divine nature, and his sense of geographical uniformity on the zoned oceans also indicate that he bears many of pantheism's most salient beliefs. For Ahab, pantheism takes</page><page sequence="3">Pantheism and the Chain of Being 23 the form of a monomania about nature's malevolent ubiquity.) If America were to refashion the links of this chain, pantheism would offer a correspondence linking not just men in society, but all matter in the universe; a new all-inclusive circle is drawn by pantheism, even while its rhetoric reifies the violent severings and amputations of democratic individualism. The chain further provides the ordering principle in a universe where all objects are categorized as either absolutely the same or absolutely different: for Emerson, this is "the eternal chain of cause and effect which pervades Nature, which threads the globes as beads on a string."'7 These eternal chains, cords, and links tether each individual orb to the universal center. In Emerson's and Melville's imaginations, images of planetary wanderings, of individual orbs lost in or absorbed by the All, recur frequently. (This will ultimately accord with their impression that cataclysmic disruptions along the chain of being will usher in some form of apocalypse and extinction.) The chain of being marks Emerson's vision of planetary and microcosmic unity; it acts as a cord connect- ing the mortal and the divine, in fact resolving them together to their fundamen- tally equivalent, ulterior natures. Through these cords, all apparent transforma- tion, all anarchic surface change, actually corroborates a universal underlying order: "I believe this conviction makes the charm of chemistry. . . . everything undressing and stealing away from its old into new form, and nothing fast but those invisible cords which we call laws, on which all is strung. Then we see that things wear different names and faces, but belong to one family. . . . All multiplicity pushes to be resolved into unity."s This resolution into unity, through cords, chains, and weldings-this lurking universal identity underlying all masks, whether in a benevolent Pan or a tiger heart-marks the incorporative mania of pantheism. All processes of transformation are controlled by these invisible cords, and the deepest parts of our identities are not individual, but universal and universally connected. While he is "feeling pantheistically," Melville writes to Hawthorne-who himself became fixated on causal chains in The House of Seven Gables, and on the figure of Pan in The Marble Faun-that while there is a great deal of "flummery" in pantheism, a refusal to accept the boundaries of individual identity, it must be reiterated that there is some truth in this all feeling." Over the course of several letters, Melville merges just not with nature, but with Hawthorne himself; he imagines their bodies so closely welded together that he feel's Hawthorne's "heart beat[ing] in my ribs, and mine in yours, and both in God's." These bodies also form a specific but all connecting chain of being in Melville's imagination. Weaving in and out of one another's bodies, men like Hawthorne and Melville then form "a chain of God's posts around the world," a transmitting, electric chain; they create a series of true, or liminal, places- zones ultimately transcribed as America-and, most importantly, a pantheistic male fraternity of writers.9 In one aspect, the chain of being represents a club of</page><page sequence="4">24 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 male storytellers. Fraternal travelers, sailors are the next best thing to writers, but fail to form an authentic chain of interior divinity: "sailors only go round the world, without going into it; and their reminiscences of travel are only a dim recollection of a chain of tap-rooms surrounding the globe ... they but touch the perimeter of the circle."'1 Ultimately, even the ship's chains lead us back to Melville's paper mills, "turning one side of the deck into a rope-walk, where they manufacture a clumsy sort of twine, called spun-yarn." Melville writes to Hawthorne that he would have "a paper mill established at one end of the house, and to have an endless ribbon of foolscap rolling in upon [his] desk," an endless correspondence with him: this ribbon of script becomes the yarn, twine and rigging of Melville's ships." These braids are then themselves kinds of spun- yarns, emphatically stories themselves: "For material, they use odds and ends of old rigging called junk', the yarn of which are picked to pieces, and then twisted into new combinations, something as most books are manufactured" (R, pp. 114-15). Books are then combinations of ropes, parts of chains, as well as models of vertebrate and plant anatomy, formed of spines and levaes; the chain resolves everything into a text, into a form of representation and connection. Writing serves as the ultimate fraternal bond, what joins men to other men, most transparently with Melville and Hawthorne; but Melville, for example, also writes to Dana that when he read Two Years Before the Mast for the first time, he was "while so engaged, as it were, tied and welded to [him] by a sort of Siamese link of affectionate sympathy."'2 These siamese links and chains bind Melville to his influences and his characters to their literary counterparts, and make them representative through their connection to one another. (Hawthorne's "connecting link" of missing evidence in The House of the Seven Gables, or the "connecting link" between Moodie and Zenobia in The Blithedale Romance, suggests that Melville's dream of pantheistic connection is partly shared with, and partly derived from, Hawthorne; Hawthorne's connections, however, rarely suggest the possibility of transcendence, only of ineluctable pattern.'3) In another letter to Dana, Melville closes, "believe me fraternally Yours-a sea-brother";14 the pantheistic mindset pursues a particular type of exclusively male familiarization, for Emerson and Melville a literal project of choosing new families. Melville creates new family boundaries and bonds, continually invokes fraternity among men, spaces, planets, and even inanimate objects; yet in Melville's own judgment, it will be through such ratification that all men become fraternally bound in the rhetoric which produces internecine warfare in America. Through much of his writing, Melville employs a language of chains and joints, of stocks and bonds, to situate his characters in society. For Melville, all men are enveloped in whale lines, joined by fraternal bonds and literal umbili- cals: monkey ropes, chains, connecting links, cunning analogies, magnets, and meridians. Even the tyrannically pantheistic or anti-pantheistic Ahab-who</page><page sequence="5">Pantheism and the Chain of Being 25 has a much more complicated relation to pantheism, and to Ishmael as a pantheist, than can be broached at this juncture-feels that Pip "is woven to [him] by cords woven of [his] heart strings" (Moby-Dick, p. 522). Positing the indissoluble relation of all to all, pantheism incurs a dissolution of the bound- aries of identity, the self's fragmentation through a variety of amputations and its accretion through absolute merger. The string which threads the globe tethers each man to the next, which is why anyone claiming command of the helm can, like Ahab, drag a whole line of men behind him to their deaths. Under Christian-anthromorphism, the "long ladder of animal life" parallels the "chain of causes arriving at a God," where it ends; taxonomy recapitulates cosmology."5 Despite its inconsistent anthropomorphic ascriptions of divinity to man or sentience to matter, pantheism itself posits a chain of being with no direction and no end, one which is circular, and without initial cause or stable identities. It is Emerson, the priest of Con-cord, who inspired the preceding and following passages from John Hittel's 1857 A Plea for Pantheism: "Man is powerful only by the multitude of his affinities, or, because his life is intertwined with the whole chain of organic and inorganic being."'6 Emerson himself dis- plays an abstract empathy with any aspect of creation, and for him all things are equal because they are equal manifestations and points of access to a larger, ideal whole. Emerson envisions the chain of nature as ascending to man, but also as instilling the same vital force indiscriminately in all animals, plants, and inanimate objects." The pantheist seeks to reestablish a mystical lost unity with god, and forge a new chain of being with the god who represents consummation and totality. For D. H. Lawrence, who is in a limited context Emerson's naturalized heir, "the old connexion, the old Allness, was severed" by man's dependence on the machine, which cuts ties between men and all living things; by intervening in the functioning of the chain of being, the modern economy proffers mastery instead of a process of relation.18 Virtually all pantheists use this rhetoric of severed chains as part of their mission to recover a lost connection between man and unmediated nature, man and some primal family, or man and the lost parts of his self. Even Emerson sometimes laments the failure of the chain to safeguard its "cargo." Most pantheists succumb to a feeling of personal dissolution and inconsistency, or partitioning, of a once unified chain of life now disrupted: The truest state of mind, rested in, becomes false. . . . It will be sour if kept, and tomorrow must be gathered anew.... It is by magnifying God that men become pantheists; it is by piously personifying him, that they become idolaters. ... Rightly is this art named composition &amp; the composition has manifold the effect of the component parts.

Every link in this living chain he found separate .. .'</page><page sequence="6">26 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 In trying to fasten this living chain of being, the pantheist conjures a Janus-faced god who must constantly transform himself. Pantheistic representativeness is also reflected in the chain of being, which transmits emblematic characteristics along its route. Embodying a kind of Northwest Passage for natural laws, hereditary traits, and geographic zoning, the chain first creates a version of a human zone, on which all the other abstracted zones are modeled. For Melville, the pantheist chain of being binds all men together; from the configuration of this chain, Melville reconstructs his models of human nature. The chain acts like an equation of signifiers, an infinitely connected series leading to, or in its totality representing, the divinity. At times, Melville advances an isolationist approach, proposing a chain of absolute differences; in the "wild whaling life individual notabilities make up all totalities" (M-D, p. 314). Emersonian representativeness or universality here stems from individual idiosyncrasy. (In Pierre, "small circumstances .., .become indices to all immensities"; individual variety makes up all totalities and univer- sals [p. 357].) But more frequently Melville's protagonists are confounded by absolute sameness, concluding that the borders between all these individual notabilities are illusory. In Melville's imagination, the chain of signification is one of sameness, anchoring us to home: Redburn frequently grasps some "last visible link in the chain of associations which bound me to my home" (Redburn, p. 68). As the rope "serpentines" around him, Ishmael decides that "All men live enveloped in whale lines. All are born with halters round their necks," but few realize it unless they move outside the immediate confines of society, which forms the true veil or mask of nature (M-D, p. 281). The "magical line" trailing behind the harpoon also functions as a chain of connection, literally and meth- odologically fastening the ship to the whale (M-D, p. 284). All men are in this case not Ahab but Ishmael, and all men experience what the representative man feels: "I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes: only, in most cases, he, one way or the other, has this siamese connection with a plurality of other mortals (M-D, p. 320). Just as this "siamese ligature" joins Ishmael and Queequeg, and Melville and Dana, it joins all creatures of the flesh, making-or rather allowing Melville to categorize- "every sailor a butcher" as well as a "brother" (M-D, pp. 320, 303). When Melville attempts to reconnect his isolated ship workers to other men, these improvised umbilicals often prove dangerous. Since all things are joined, all effects of the deity become universal; there is a "jealousy presiding over all creations," for "Gods and men-[are] both brawlers" (M-D, pp. 164, 178). The fractures proceed through every level of creation, and anything said about one man must be applied to all. Any instance becomes a rule, and any creature an entire species; the chain allows, or rather requires, instantaneous access and transmission along its path. Any link can serve as any other, and becomes</page><page sequence="7">Pantheism and the Chain of Being 27 interchangeable with that link. The chain then facilitates Emersonian represen- tativeness, the elevation of any particular to universal relevance. For Ishmael, Queequeg is "the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world"; and Ishmael implies not just that Queequeg perfectly typifies his particular niche in the world, but in effect that any person can serve as an emblem for any other (M-D, p. 321).20 Often called his "inseparable twin brother," Queequeg makes Ishmael perceive that his "own individuality [is] now merged in a joint stock company of two" (M-D, p. 320). That company later becomes projected onto the world as a whole; the American universe is an enlarged and magnified joint-stock company. A unity and a binary (which is usually considered as potentially "innate" to the unity in any case) are the only building blocks needed to construct a world; any person, but more emphatically any two people, any chain, can represent any larger structure: the "two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene" (M-D, p. 494). Through pantheism, there is absolute self-difference, but also absolute self-exchangeability in the chain which connects Ahab to the volcano, the tower, the globe, and the magician's glass (M-D, p. 431). A lack of self-contained, defined identity allows Ahab, and in his way the Confidence-Man, to imperson- ate anything, to occupy any link on the chain. (Where Ahab selectively absorbs the traits of his crew to a monomaniacal purpose, to define his identity, the Confidence-Man assumes the random traits of anyone in his proximity to negate the very concept of identity.) From a specific conception of solipsistic micro- cosms, pantheism develops the notion that all identity is a function of correspon- dence along a pre-established chain. Dualism becomes an essential trait of pantheistic metaphor, which merely picks two random objects along the chain and connects the thread; things are so connected for Ishmael that "there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself' (M-D, p. 53). That is, identity can only be derived from context, from a connective tissue; only stocks and bonds create value or identity. (As a result, no innate identity can adhere to selves or objects. In Mardi, men's skulls, used as spittoons, become spittoons. The use to which an object is put and the charac- teristics of nearby objects "contaminate" any imputed natural identity.) Thus does Ishmael soon discover that "from that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle": to define oneself, one must first merge to all other selves, which is most easily accomplished through the preliminary merger with one other per- son (M-D, p. 61). The Melvillean self is to a great extent a barnacle or leech, a stow-away kept in the undersides and crevices of ship and society, unless he can successfully merge with another. That all men are born, once more implicitly without mothers, through whaling lines-via its surrogate halters and umbilicals-creates a physiognomic universality which in turn establishes the pattern for making universal connec- tions and concluding that the world is a metaphor for the male self. With the</page><page sequence="8">28 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 crucifixion in his face, Ahab embodies the line of representative men, becoming Adam, Noah, Jesus, and again Ahab, kin with the sea: "say'st all of us are Ahabs" (M-D, p. 515). Through Melville's experiments with pantheism, characters are welded into a corporate unity: "They were one man, not thirty ... -yet all these ran into each other . .. all varieties were welded into oneness" (M-D, p. 557). The final effect of Melville's own welding with his male influences is the creation of characters who literally do not know when to stop: "Are they not one and all with Ahab?" (M-D, p. 164). In effect they are part of the One and All, the all and the one of pantheism; merger is so immediate to Ahab that, as for Emerson, other people merely become parts of his body. As Ahab, echoing Shakespeare's Antonian military metaphors, commands, "Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs" (M-D, p. 568). And like Antony, a bridegroom in his death, Samoa, while experiencing the instability of "matrimony at sea ... meditated suicide-I would have said wedlock-and the twain became one."''21 For Melville, Cato, and Ishmael, going to sea is always equivalent to both suicide and wedlock, because the self is created and destroyed by being wed to other people. That escape from society turns out be an imprisonment in its chains, a welding of sea- brothers and-in Emerson's quest for a family designated by choice rather than birth, and in Melville's dramatization of such a prospect in Pierre-other family configurations. Melville uses the image of the chain to describe all cause and effect, all social and natural hierarchies, and all forms of vitalistic transference, as operating under a single law of connection; and once dead "even then the Martial Law might hunt you straight through the other world, and out again at its other end, following you through all eternity, like an endless thread on the inevitable track of its own point, passing unnumbered needles through."22 The pantheistic zone embodies a circular all-inclusive chain; hence there literally are no alternatives, no spaces outside the zone to alter what is. This single infinite thread has passed effortlessly through Emerson to Melville. Emerson's notion of science had ironically created a principle of scarcity along an infinite but circular chain: "Nature is an endless combination and repetition of a very few laws," and, by extrapolation, a very few individuals, and these laws and forms constitute the only permanent binding in the universe.2 Any chain is thus composed of and determined solely by its series of repetitions. Loosen this chain, and the cohesion of society disintegrates. The chain often leads back to the self, since the self threatens to constitute all of nature, so that the familiar theme of the hunter hunting himself, of reflexivity, becomes of primary importance in much of Melville's writing. The self is at once wholly connected and wholly divided, thereby standing in contrast with itself; thus "we spin [our own] shroud out of [ourselves]" (M-D, p. 528). This kind of reflexive "Martial Law" forms the underpinning of the chain, for in every journey and in every metaphor we will always arrive back at ourselves: "Now,</page><page sequence="9">Pantheism and the Chain of Being 29 then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one" (M-D, p. 168). For Emerson, men are implicitly all third-person autobiographers projecting their unknown selves to be universal causes and effects: "Do you see that kitten chasing so prettily her own tail? If you could look with her eyes you might see her surrounded with hundreds of figures performing complex dramas ... -and meantime it is only puss and her tail."24 Melville similarly chases his masonic symbol, and Ahab his bigger prey, but in every case the protagonist advances on a global treadmill. The undifferentiated chain of being must also stage the "retropeptic," the reciprocal, the metaphysics of self-consumption: Taji confesses that in writing, "my own mad brood of eagles devours me" (M, p. 368). Throughout Mardi, writing proves to be self-consumptive: Media speaks of biographers as generat- ing their own combustible thunder and lightning, to which Abrazza replies, "with which they but consume themselves, my prince beloved" (M, p. 592). This is a version of the reflexive hunt, or the eucharist: " in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him. ... through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end" (M-D, p. 383). A literal chain of being, a tether, forces us to circle, and finally consume, ourselves; each man becomes a gate of access and process, the nexus of polarities, but nothing in himself. As Melville titles a chapter of Mardi, "The Pursuer is Himself Pursued." Such a chase confirms Emerson's explicit belief that the hunter and the hunted are one: as Perry Miller long ago noted, "because all men participate in the Over-Soul those who shoot and those who are shot prove to be identical; in the realm of the transcendental there is nothing to choose between eating and being eaten."25 The divinity presides over every aspect of this chase: as Ahab yells to Starbuck, "God hunt us all, if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!" (M-D, p. 166). But again, any external must become ironically reflected back, and the whalers are described as all being "game for Moby Dick" (M-D, p. 163). As Dates laments of Pierre's marriage, "the best shot in all the country round is Master Pierre;-pray god he hits not now the bull's eye in himself' (P, p. 187). These images are important because they indicate that in pantheism all action is simultaneously a quest for self- definition and a form of suicide: "If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy ... turned all its concentrated cannon upon its own mad mark" (M-D, p. 185). The central quality of American mania, and finally of male paranoia, stems from this mirroring. Unchecked projection always ends in an implosion. This principle of reflexive inversion creates an endless series of reciprocal transfor- mations: "But himself a skeleton. Life folded death. Death trellised life" (M-D, p. 450). (Melville's surgeons, in Mardi, White-Jacket and Moby-Dick, are all also similarly regarded as inverted skeletons, and in fact as virtual butchers and cannibals.) And spirit and matter must always be proportionately aligned along this chain: "that ascendancy did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership" (M-D, pp.</page><page sequence="10">30 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 211-12).26 Pantheism insists on absolute commensurability, for every wing in the air, a fin in the sea; for every madness on earth, sense in heaven; for every thrust outward, a returning arc. Spirit and matter must be linked and correspondent, for a line of connection can always be drawn between any two points, even those in incommensurate spheres.27 The reflexivity and circularity of this chain of being creates a series of uncanny inversions in Melville's works; men become silent, animals bear mes- sages we cannot decipher; surfaces become interiors and interiors externals. In short, what we consider "nature" turns out to have no intrinsic parameters, points to no true north, and so is perpetually subject to being turned inside out. Melville's preoccupation with things turned inside out is part of his fascination with self-fulfillment and consumption; it is evident, for example, in the story of the polyp who longed to live in the air, and turns itself inside out: "the lining of our interiors is nothing more than continuation of the epidermis, or scarf skin, [proving] therefore, that in a remote age we too must have been turned wrong side out" (M, p. 507).2 In fact one of Melville's "grotesque conceits" of power here directly echoes Emerson and presages Thomas Pynchon-"an endless string," the endless chain, "of the royal lizards circumnavigating the basin in inverted chase of their tails" (M, p. 255). (Emblematically, the animal evolves from cat to lizard to mythical serpent/benzene ring as the metaphor is handed down from Emerson to Melville to Pynchon.) Inversion, polarization, and circularity mark the pantheist sense of identity. Oloo, appropriately the god of suicides, is designated by a similar emblem of winding chains and inversions: "We came to an image with a long anaconda-like posterior development, wound round and round its own neck ... you perceive, my lord, how he lays violent tail upon himself.., the long lines of sphinxes and griffins and many-limbed images, a band of them" chanting their rounds to the "unnumbered deities" (M, p. 344). In Moby-Dick, whaling, that Egyptian mother who bears offspring themselves already pregnant, conjures a chain convoluted upon itself, a series of inter- twined umbilicals, and a line of hereditary descent marked by inescapable cords. With the whaleline's "coils [and] ... contortions," the whalers "seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs" (M-D, p. 280). These images of coils and recursiveness, of a snake-like chain of being, all harken back to an all-inclusive and consumptive chain of being, and finally to a self whose borders are never clarified, which is continually threatened by its proximity to others and by the unknown in itself, by its own multiplicity. A thread leads out of ourselves and to the All, and from the All back to any other seemingly distinct self; it is only through the web of connections, however, that the pantheist self exists at all. Melville views the threads and chains of pantheism as explicit markers of Emersonian laws of relation. In keeping with pantheism's sense of infinite regress, the chain is nowhere anchored and nowhere begun. Only the totality of</page><page sequence="11">Pantheism and the Chain of Being 31 existence can be considered an end or a divinity. Pierre is best approached as a familial reconfiguration of Moby-Dick's more broadly economic chains and connections. Pierre, like Christ, decides to rend "all mortal bonds," and, like Melville writing to Hawthorne, tries to merge with nature, to "bind [himself] in bonds he cannot break" with what he terms the divine population of the forests; but Pierre is instead ensnared in the bonds of a feminine pantheism, and in a labyrinthine familial merger (P, p. 107). The chain of course always stretches back to before prime and parental causes, for there are "things not wholly imputable to the immediate apparent cause, which is only one link in the chain" (P, p. 67). The family in time and the zone in space are composed of individual links in an endless chain. Women in particular act as reflectors in the Melvillean chain, serving in traditional terms as either the keys to or the disrupters of the connection. Intuitively to Pierre, Isabel's sisterhood "was a link that he now felt was binding him to a before unimagined and endless chain of wondering" (P, p. 139). Isabel, herself associated with the weaving of fate, embodies this principle of connection, and Pierre and Isabel "coiled together, and entangledly stood mute" (P, p. 192). Wondering how Isabel snares Pierre, Mrs. Glendinning concludes with dramatic irony that it was "ay-the sewing!" (P, p. 194). (Mean- while, for her part, Mrs. Glendinning "thought she saw her innate superiority to [Lucy] in the absolute scale of being" [P, p. 70]). The feminized chain fastens the links and threads, whose paths are predetermined, inexorable, and constrict- ing, and creates "those Cretan labyrinths, to which thy life's cord is leading thee" (P, p. 176). After Moby-Dick, Melville has explicitly transposed the cords and threads binding men to those binding men and women. Melville ultimately cathects women with the terrors of the chain, its instability, its endless significa- tion, and its economic constrictions. In Melville's version of all-connecting pantheism, women represent the primary link to nature; even with Lucy, Pierre "seemed as one placed in linked correspondence with the summer lightnings" (P, p. 36). Once Pierre has joined Isabel, the Emersonian correspondence of feminine lightning and the chains of causality is reinforced: "Strangest feelings, almost supernatural, now stole into Pierre ... such coincidences, however frequently they may recur, ever fill the finer organizations with sensations which transcend all verbal renderings. ... With the lightning's flash, the query is spontaneously propounded--chance, or God? ... then most ponder upon final causes. ... all their myriad links rattle in the mournful mystery" (P, p. 111). A force of feminine nature, lightning in effect spontaneously generates the chain and its paths of connection, as it gothically animates or generates matter. The bonds that hold creation together are recapitulated in those that tie men and women, for instance in the "nuptial bond to be tied" in Mondoldo: "he bound them together to a ritual chant, about her neck, in festoons, disposing the flowery ends of the cord .... This cord being attached to the waist of the groom, he leaned over toward the bride by reason of</page><page sequence="12">32 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 the burden ... ." (M, p. 302). For every joining comes a corresponding rendering, nowhere so dramatically as with the mating of female and male souls. The inevitably convoluted images of weddings and weldings in Melville, of dowers and tethers, chains and bonds, suggest a Christian empathy without bounds, a chain of signification which transmits pollution and purity alike. (As part of nature, the systems of pantheism do not make any qualifications, act as neutral conveyer belts for any and all information and cargo; it is up to philoso- phers like Emerson to decide that nature's lack of discrimination is irrelevant, since all evil is turned to good in the universal perspective.) Such connections are part of a larger system of transitivity, where Pan transfers and transforms along the chain and its ties: "to tread the dusty earth would be to desecrate the holy marae by transferring thereto the base soil of less sacred ground" (M, p. 335). The abstract chain acts as the literal conduit of pantheism's system of transmission; all characteristics are potentially contaminating, and act like a series of trip-switches, precisely through the chain of god's posts around the world. The chain or cord connects the one and the all, all sacreds and profanes, and all polarities, to a central and finally indiscriminate All. NATURE AND THE CHAIN OF BEING Melville's depictions of nature, Pan's domain, are structured through the all- connecting chain of being. Allowing for a kind of vivisection of the animal kingdom, and comprised of cords and connective ligature, the chain of being bears its counterpart in the physically animate landscape of Melville's novels. Any object-like a bone-can be transposed to another link in the chain; the inanimate can then be rendered like man, and man like the whole of the animal kingdom. The chain guarantees universal translation, and serves as a Rosetta Stone of creation. In his song catalogue of mermaids, hybrids, and skeletons, Melville describes "the complete skeleton of an immense tiger shark . . . the bony blades of nine swordfish ... braided round and tassled with cords of human hair. (Now obsolete.)" (M, p. 380). Thus when Braid Beard later talks of self-consumption, the retropeptic, he indicates that all forms of digestion trans- form along the path of the chain, and "the glittering coral seemed bones embedded, bleaching in the sun" (M, pp. 549-50). The cord insures that what was once tiger bone will become human bone and bleach back again. Melville, the Darwinian zoologist, presents an aesthetic catalogue of creation: "Oh, be- lieve me, God's creatures fighting fin for fin, a thousand miles from the land, and with a round horizon for an arena, is no ignoble subject for a masterpiece" (M, p. 42). (Endlessly concerned, like Shakespeare's Enobarbus, with determining what is "a phenomenon worthy the chronicling," Melville's narrators must justify</page><page sequence="13">Pantheism and the Chain of Being 33 writing of a whale or a flea, of any self, as representative or noble; but if the chain is not centered, all its constituents are equidistant from the divine [M, p. 110]). By examining the images of animated nature in his works, one traces Melville's ideas concerning identity and self-representation. After Zenophanes and Gold- smith, Melville frequently asserts that the wholly new is entirely false; only what can be interpreted along familiar taxonomic lines is recognizable, is even pos- sible. But Melville avidly desires to create an original American voice, if not original American species. For Melville, then, fabulous creatures also represent fabulous ideas, ideas evolved solely from the author's autonomous mind-at least via Pan's inspiration--without the creationist intervention of a Christian god. Even though they turn out to be confidence tricks-only magnified mice or pigs with wings, recombined bits of the old chain-these anomalous and incredible creatures at least bear the promise of transcendence. In a pantheist taxonomy where any unknown creature is only a version of a familiar species, the lack of a center requires that all creatures be equally capable of representing the liminal and fantastic as well as the average and normative. In other words, a seemingly new species is only a familiar species modified; hence the "margins" of the animal kingdom, like the margins of human society, are central to Melville's works. Melville is particularly interested in creatures who exist at the poles farthest from the already lost center, those beyond classification: "what strange monsters float by. Elsewhere was never seen their like. And nowhere are they found in the books of the naturalists" (M, p. 39). The "extraordinary zoological specimens" which hourly pass in Mardi reflect Melville's reliance on nature, particularly the fringes of a nature which has no median, as the source of identity (M, p. 40). The abnormal and monstrous are no less "central" on the infinite chain than the typical, and in fact become typical simply by occupying any position. To Babbalanja's query of who the monsters are-they or the cripples-of the multiply deformed among the Swiftian Hooloomooloo, Mohi replies that he is the monster for asking such a question (M, p. 574). (In Mardi, we are degenerate offspring of decaying gods, and "our mothers all miscarry. Giants are in our germs, but we are dwarfs staggering under heads overgrown. Heaped, our measures burst." While always fixed in structure, the chain also seems to suffer from the effects of a standard entropy, with the present always a decayed version of a past which is closer to an original unity [M, p. 593]). In some ways, Mardi is structured around a Swiftian catalogue of the fabulous; the invisible malicious spirits, the Plujii; the Genii, who build a ladder of mountains to the sun; the winged beings who first inhabited Mardi; the series of the supernal within nature (M, pp. 262, 272, 642). Catalogues of the extinct, the exotic, the improbable, or the ancestral, are presented in virtually every philosophical discussion in the book, and are often even extended to include imagined or possible variations: "Beyond their land may exist other regions, of which those strangers know not, peopled with</page><page sequence="14">34 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 races something like us Mardians but perhaps with more exalted faculties, and organs that we lack. They may have some better sense than ours, perhaps have fins or wings for arms" (M, p. 420). Melville's sense that civilized men are in and of themselves somehow vestigial seems bound up with his conception of animals and the uncanny; contemporary man is only a version of an earlier model or of a potential successor. His status is always subject to change, to inversion, to the irruption of prior forms, and to a kind of cathexis to some other point along the chain. Men's forms as well as identities are wholly plastic in nature, yet universalized throughout Melville's writings. Melville oscillates between explor- ing man's absolute potential and damning his absolutely determined nature. In general, Melville's images become more dynamic as they become more mythi- cal, for example as emperors move "like a charge of crowned centaurs" (M-D, p. 267). The frenetic energy Melville devotes to non-human or fabricated taxono- mies suggests that he is attempting to liberate man by placing him in an unfamiliar, if often threatening, cosmology. Connected by the monkey-rope, the battering-ram, and the cat-head, by the jackets of the whale, of man, and of the book, and by the skin of all, Melville's protagonists cannot escape having strange bedfellows; the "horrible vulturism" of earth encompasses all creation, all ani- mals as one (M-D, pp. 308, 319). In Moby-Dick, man the "hobbling wight" confronts "that mortal monster" of the whale, but in the process finally wears away the distinction between natural observer and nature observed (M-D, p. 229). Already in Redburn, Jackson "looked like a fat porpoise, standing on end. He had a round face, too, like a walrus; and with the same expression, half human and half indescribable" (R, p. 87-88). Joined to all creation, man is thus also frequently cut in half. Aside from its framework of cords and connections, the chain of being also governs the incarnation of spirit as matter. To Emerson, the world of nature is always encountered as the process which transforms our innate thoughts into actual shapes: "Animals have been called the 'dreams of Nature.' . . . It was in this glance that Ovid got the hint of his metamorphoses; Calidasa of his transmigration of souls. For these fables are our own thoughts carried out."29 The doctrine of pantheistic transformation is entirely based on the chain of animal being. From this perspective, the whale which can "transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharp-pointed New York pilot-boat" reveals not only the animation of the inanimate, but the all-plastic powers of nature. (Through this ascription of thought and life to nature and its shadow world of mechanisms, an animate rope or harpoon line becomes an "iron leech" (M-D, p. 385). The principles governing the incarnation and transformation of the metaphysical are enacted through the chain of being, and as tropes are reified, the images become increasingly absurd and monstrous, but all the more literal: "a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman" (M-D, p. 354). These are the reified metaphors</page><page sequence="15">Pantheism and the Chain of Being 35 which Northrop Frye claims only a madman or a "primitive" would accept at face value, but which pantheists surmise are literal transcriptions of the poten- tial of all necessarily indeterminate objects to assume a new identity, and of thought to become feral.30 I interpret the staggering predominance of animal imagery in Melville as an incarnation of Emerson's doctrine of the "transmigration" of thought to animals. On a single page of Moby-Dick we learn that Tashtego has "snaky limbs" and that Dagoo has a "lion-like tread" and stands "erect as a giraffe" (M-D, p. 121). As characters button their "monkey jackets" or climb the "man ropes," it becomes apparent that objects aboard ship are all alive, and the men all like animals (M-D, pp. 14, 39). (Similarly, in Redburn sailors "pulled on their monkey-jackets. As for Jackson, he was all the time rubbing his back and snarling like a dog." The standard for identity is consistently found in the animal kingdom: others "like fighting elks, sink down into the ocean, with their antlers locked in death" [Redburn, pp. 80, 93]). A harpooner remarks to the "young philosopher" of the crew, once again "Darwinizing" the metaphysical: "thou monkey .... Whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up here" (M-D, p. 159). Captains too are not immune from the worst insult, from being compared to the animal closest to man on the evolutionary scale: Stubb declares "he's no more fit to command a whale ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he's a baboon" (M-D, p. 406). Since animal imagery is always anthropomorphized with human traits, any animal is already a perfect (live) stock metaphor for man. Men are like cattle, "branded for the slaughter by the gods" (M-D, p. 248). Worse than sheep, the mutineers are "dragged along the deck like dead cattle ... like three quarters of meat ... ." (M-D, p. 253) Along with sharks, sheep become the standard metaphor for men and whales: "Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But his occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures" (M- D, p. 385). Such a comment, though, also casts considerable suspicion on Ishmael's insistence on a universal tiger heart (M-D, p. 385). Almost any string of animal images in Melville can be traced to a particular effect. For instance, elephants are typically invoked to convey either a sense of royal power and dignity or royal dignity derided. Whales are representative or exemplary versions of all other animals, but are also particularly compared to elephants as the largest and fiercest of all animals: "What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh ... ?" (M-D, p. 410). If each species is only an evolutionary variation of another species, to Ishmael the whale is only a floating elephant: "As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all beings" (M-D, p. 378). The chain establishes Emersonian prece-</page><page sequence="16">36 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 dent, representativeness, for any correlation. If elephants have survived con- stant hunting, so should the whale in his enormous pasture (M-D, pp. 461-62). Whales are maddened like elephants in the book of Maccabees; and in essential keeping with all these images, Ahab finally collapses "like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants" (M-D, p. 551).31 In many ways, Moby-Dick receives its structure from a procession of animal images, from the flea to the whale. Series of characters can be tracked through a particular animal family, for instance the feline. Tashtego is "nimble as a cat" (M-D, p. 341) Dagoo strains "like a pacing tiger in his cage" (M-D, p. 284). "All three tigers-Queequeg, Tashtego, Dagoo-instinctively sprang . .. like three kettles at the tail of a mad cougar!" (M-D, p. 355).32 If the whale is but "a species of magnified mouse," Ahab is "like a mute, maned sea-lion on the white coral beach" (M-D, pp. 119, 150). Under pantheism, all creatures become versions of one another, magnified or shrunk; Melville's metaphors corroborate the sequen- tial yet undifferentiated chain of being of Emersonian naturalism. For all its indecipherable essence as a veil of nature, the whale is also crucially depicted as being almost identical to man, with its rear end having a striking "resemblance to the human skull" (M-D, p. 349). With its babies suckling and looking upwards like human children, the whale must represent both a wholly inhuman nature and a wholly humanized nature (M-D, p. 388). (I argue elsewhere that the whale's spine is specifically depicted as an Emersonian and Goetheian universal body part, the Romantic building block of all vertebrate life, including man's.) Solitary Leviathan is the male pantheist, "like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters ... ..." (M-D, p. 393). In many ways, the whale represents a complex and hermaphroditic marriage of the male self with nature. Yet in man's merger with nature, he makes little allowance for the fact that he is inextricably connected to what he kills, and that his identity is derived from that connection. In the economy of whaling, man lives by killing those with whom he makes bonds. Ishmael sarcastically defends whaling in the terms of the patriarchy: it's more manly, involves more "butchery," than soldiering, and it makes money, so it must have worth (M-D, p. 109). As Stubb declares, though man "love[s] his fellows, yet man is a money making animal, which propensity too often inter- feres with his benevolence" (M-D, p. 413). Man is lord over all the animals, but "the curse of labor rests only on us ... [and] Mardi is not wholly ours. We are the least populous part of the creation. To say nothing of other tribes, a census of herrings would find us far in the minority" (M, p. 575). The role of labor, of joints and bonds, is also predicated on the conception of nature; Melville's is always an animal economy, and his descriptions of labor almost always invoke the skins and skeins of animals. Men gauge their own place in the chain of being, and the possibility of transformation, against the role of animals and even</page><page sequence="17">Pantheism and the Chain of Being 37 plants. Recalling Mardi's census of men and herrings, Pierre the planter claims "this day I will forsake the censuses of men, and seek the suffrages of the god- like population of the trees, which now seem to me a nobler race than man" (P, p. 106). In the wake of his disappointment with his species, Melville continually searches for divine, and finally satanic, alternatives. Man is predictable because he does certain things, "because not to do them, and their like, would be to be an angel, a chronometer; whereas, he is a man and a horologe" (P, p. 215). Thus Melville's catalogues of angels and animals situate man, give him his identity, and allow Melville to redefine man in terms of his projected identities. With sardonic determination, Melville pinpoints the desirability of having whales, dodoes, or aboriginal peoples literally to use: In the rude ages men hunted and javelined the tiger, because they hated him for a mischief-minded wild beast; but in these enlightened times, though we love the tiger as little as ever, still we mostly hunt him for the sake of his skin. A wise man will then wear his tiger.... In this view, foes are far more desirable than friends; for who would hunt and kill his own faithful and affectionate dog for the sake of his skin? and is a dog's skin as valuable as a tiger's? (P, p. 222) The enlightened man goes among men as among animals, but one is still better off not receiving the benevolence of friends and fellows. Melville moves consis- tently from the hunting of animals to the hunting of men and their souls. By the time of Pierre, The Confidence-Man, and Billy Budd, authors and men will become his endangered species. In virtually all of Melville's works, man is defined by the way he views the rest of creation: "for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men" (M-D, p. 385). If men are only exaggerated versions of beasts, the acts he perpetrates upon them are acts he perpetrates upon himself, magnified, honed, made representative, made divine. What man has done to nature-under pantheism the source of his identity-must be done to him; to survive, he must remain allied with and defined by those he hunts, with those who regenerate him. But soon there will be no one who survives the hunt to tell the tale. At the end of Melville's chain, man ceases to exist; by the time of The Confidence-Man and Billy Budd, he becomes extinct, a fossil, a trophy, superseded by machines, lost in the transformation from boy to man, a vestigial relic of his past. Great Pan is dead, and his subjects are thrown onto a lawless track, into pure destruction of all life.</page><page sequence="18">38 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 NOTES I would like to thank Carolyn Porter for her advice and assistance. 1.

Philips Bradley, 2 vols. (New York: Vintage, 1945), 2:104-106. The American chain of being also determines the nature of its political systems. According to Edmond Holmes, in All is One: A Plea for the Higher Pantheism (London: R. Cobden-Sanderson, 1921): As an individual member of the community the tribesman was a pattern of unselfishness; as a sharer in its corporate life and corporate consciousness he was too often a monster of selfishness. . . . the community itself was separatist and self-centered. . . . With the multiplication of communities came the inevitable weakening of the sentiment of communal devotion. ... The individual self warred against the communal. The communal self against the ideal. The ideal against the individual. ... If the human commonwealth is ... the largest of all the communities to which a man owes allegiance ... he and it are involved in a vicious circle from which there is no escape. (pp. 44-45, 93, 52) Though conceived on a simpler level, Holmes' chain of being sounds much like Melville's in Mardi. Any theorist encounters problems of allegiance when using Pan to define the American, for Pan is literally supra or Pan-American: for Holmes or Emerson, "The Pan-human self is higher than the patriotic self' (p. 94). 7.

Ahab and Ishmael invert Melville's relationship with Hawthorne. Opposition to pantheism and fraternal identity is, for example, played out emphatically in the relationship between Ishmael, with his other pantheist deity, and Ahab, with his erstwhile Calvinist god. While Ishmael is tempted by thoughts of numerous mergers, "few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab's brain" (M-D, p. 483). As Ahab, in a chain of command, clasps up lesser men to his being, Ishmael, after attempting a joint existence with Queequeg-like Melville welded to Dana, magnetized to Hawthorne-vanishes from his own narrative. 10.

(This is "the tendency of events to suggest and establish a connection. ... linking one with the other.") Zenobia repeatedly asks, "XVith what kind of being am I linked?" (p. 123). While I can't address the gender configurations of the chain in detail in this essay, it is important to note here that Melville, while specifically narrowing his focus from the social to the familial in moving from Moby-Dick to Pierre, transfers the systems of weddings and weldings from one sphere to the other. "It was while seated solitary in his room one morning," like Ahab, solitary as at the pole, that Pierre turns towards "the naked floor, following the seams in it, which, as wires, led straight from where he sat to the connecting door, and disappeared beneath it into the chamber of Isabel" (The Writings of Herman Melville, vol. 7, Pierre (1971), p. 308; hereafter cited in the text as P). (Whereupon Isabel immediately hands him a letter from Lucy, in which she protests that "still are we one, Pierre ... and I hastened to re-tie myself to thee .... " (P, p. 309). In Pierre, these now wholly feminized wires, connections, and ties offer to rehabilitate Pierre, but they cannot form a stable circuit of god's manly posts, only of endless feminine instability. 14.

Lawrence becomes an important devotee and critic of Emerson's pantheism; in "Pan in America," Lawrence's modernist response to Tocqueville's Democracy in America, and in "The Overtone," his response to Emerson's "The Over-Soul," Lawrence writes primarily as an interpreter of American Renaissance pantheism. 19.

Such images of the divided man again conjure a unity of geography predicated on an equatorial man. In his 1857 Remarks Upon Alchemy, the philosopher-general E. A. Hitchcock, grandson of Ethan Allen and cadet trainer to Edgar Allan Poe, asks, quoting Van Helmont, "whether both worlds have not a great affinity, and perfect likeness, yea and unity with one another." (Hitchcock's many philosophical works reflect the general fascination with the elements of pantheism during the American Renaissance.) But, in fact, for Melville pantheist bonds must create a gap or duality between any two "worlds" or items related by Romantic tropes. See Hitchcock's Remarks Upon Alchemy and the Alchemists (Boston: Crosby and Nichols, 1857), pp. 32-33. Necessarily incommensurate visions-Hawthorne's simultaneously gay and sorrowful face of Pan-are then generated, ones which are perpetually projected and collapsed: "He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So man's insanity is heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then the uncompromised, indifferent as his God" (M-D, p. 414). Man's insanity remains the proof of god's sanity, the unity of variety, the complementarity of chronometricals and horologicals. 21.

As Annie Dillard writes in her transcendental manifesto, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, "I find in quantum mechanics a world symbolically similar to my world at the creek" ([New York: Harper and Row, 1974], p. 202). 27. Melville has revised the Shakespearian model of the chain of being, where the divine order reflects the mortal political order; the veil between the two spheres is left in place, but the hierarchy is eradicated. The chronometrical and horological worlds, as he describes them in Pierre, are still tethered to one another, but the divine world is purged of all humanity, individuality, personality, or stability. For Melville, the divine sphere has become an anarchic zone of incessant transformation, representative laws, and communal or corporate non-human identity. (The chain finally lends itself to a kind of uniform, corporate American space; Melville's ideal chain of god's posts winds up a series of chain stores-the franchise as prefabricated platonic ideal.) In American Hieroglyphics (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1980), John Irwin locates an American narcissism as, in Ishmael's words, "the key to it all";-in Moby-Dick's images of doubling and repetition, Irwin sees the characters achieving identity through a projection which is only reflection (p. 288). One would then want, as Carolyn Porter suggests in Seeing and Being, to determine whether this is an historicizable narcissism, one which is not just a question of abstract metaphysics, but particular contexts. See Porter, Seeing and Being: The Plight of the Participant Observer in Emerson, James, Adams, and Faulkner (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1981). For contrasting readings of the masculine and feminine aspects of this American self- inscription, see Joyce Warren's discussion of transcendental individualism in The American Narcis- sus (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1984), and David Leverenz' psychoanalytic assess- ment of gendered self-construction and narcissistic incontinence in Manhood in the American Renaissance (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1989). 28. Such images of inverted skeletons are prevalent throughout Melville's writing, from Cuticle's skeleton in White-Jacket to Mardi's and Pierre's numerous images of death in life. Polar inversions reverse internal and external boundaries; in Moby-Dick, for example, Starbuck intones, "already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my flesh" (M-D, p. 564). In more contemporary terms, the images of the inverted or circular serpent also connote "the 'One,' the primordial unity from which we are alienated. . . . Pynchon's reevaluation of the Eden myth [denies] a Serpent-inspired Fall by which nature was supposedly devalued. Similarly, the 'rainbow' of Pan's coils comes to signify a promise of nature's vitalizing permanence," with Pan representing a pre-Christian God. These coils are also menacing, however, and critics disagree on whether the presence of Pan in the book promises any form of redemption (see Dwight Eddins, The Gnostic Pynchon [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990], p. 127. Echoing Perry Miller, Wai-chee Dimock notes that as "a model of relexivity, the snake is hardly a unique invention, either in Melville or in antebellum America .... What boggles the mind is, once again, the impossible conjunction-the fact that the victimizing 'conquer[or]' and the victimized 'avenger' turn out to be one and the same (Empire for Liberty: Melville and the Poetics of Individualism [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989], pp. 177, 183).</page><page sequence="21">Pantheism and the Chain of Being 41 29.

Similarly, Stubb complains of Ahab, "didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that!" (M-D, p. 128). Near the start of Moby-Dick, mariners seem "an eruption of bears from Labrador" (M-D, p. 15). They later proceed into their dark dens "like bears into a cave" (M-D, p. 251). Ishmael could not tell "from what vile hole [Queequeg] had been coming," while the landlord grins "like an ape" (M-D, p. 16). Queequeg's legs are marked "as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms" (M-D, p. 22). Through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touching his appellative "We must have a hedgehog there ... Quohog ...." (M-D, p. 89). After Ishmael wonders whether Queequeg's tribe "fast on their hams that way in his native island?" he reports that he slept with a "wide awake pagan on his hams" (M-D, p. 84). (Pierre is similarly described in porcine terms: "He felt as a moose, hamstrung" [P, p. 339].) At times, Queequeg himself is less hog than metamorph: "a creature in the transition state-neither caterpillar nor butterfly" (M-D, p. 27). Seamen rush "as in swarming-time the bees rush to the boughs" (M-D, p. 276). The sharks too are "the rabid creatures swarm[ing] round it like bees in a beehive" (M-D, p. 321). The animal similes in Moby-Dick are maintained with a loose but verifiable consistency, particularly in cross-referencing, and are crucial to understanding the nature of identity in the text. The mate is "ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious," while "this fellow's a weazel," and "there's a jackal for ye!" (M-D, pp. 246, 322, 403). Similarly, the following images of nature can be associated and reintegrated to tell a story: just as in Indian legend "an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his talons" (M-D, pp. 63-64), so is Ahab in effect carried off aboard a usurped Indian vessel: "Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft ... one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks ... came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings . . . with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his prize [hat]. An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin's head, removing his cap to replace it ... Ahab's hat was never restored" (M-D, p. 539). Various other bird images suffuse the text. The homeless stray birds in effect frequently identify the Pequod: "A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board, and is made a captive" in a whalebone cage (M-D, p. 467). Pantheism can also be read as a sign of the beginning of Modernism. Unlike a Judeo-Christian god, pantheism's natural law is entirely impersonal, sometimes transcendent, sometimes mechani- cal, and this oscillation is apparent in much of post-Victorian literature. Pantheism serves as a kind of missing link between Tocqueville and D. H. Lawrence, between the American Renaissance and Modernism, as well as a missing link of philosophical development among a range of transcendental and pantheistic American writers, from Emerson and Melville to H. D., Annie Dillard, and Thomas Pynchon. Pynchon's texts are even more chain-linked than Melville's; for Pynchon, virtually all transforma- tion proceeds along a chemical-social chain of being: "metamorphoses" of any kind occur when "carbon atoms could link up one to another, into long chains" (Gravity's Rainbow [New York: Bantam, 1973], p. 480). General Pudding "was brought up to believe in a literal Chain of Command, as clergymen of earlier centuries believed in the Chain of Being. The newer geometries confuse him" (p. 88). In order actually to change man, one must not continue to rearrange the molecular alphabet, but open the closed system, the fixed and self-collapsing cycle of being. Otherwise all those within the system are doomed, for any impingement anywhere on the chain reverberates; the chain binds us all, and it must "sooner or later crash to its death ... dragging with it innocent souls all along the chain of life" (p. 481). The Emersonian alchemist "hop[es] that for each psi-synthetic taken from earth's soul there is a molecule, secular, more or less ordinary and named over here-. .. among the plastic trivia, finding in each Deeper Significance and trying to string them all together</page><page sequence="22">42 Studies in the American Renaissance 1994 like terms of a power series hoping to zero in on the tremendous and secret Function, whose name, like the permuted names of God, cannot be spoken" (p. 688). The pantheist's dream is "to bring them together, in their slick persistence and our preterition ... to make sense out of, to find the meanest sharp sliver of truth in so much replication" (p. 688). And the replicating chain literally connects us to the natural world: " ... pirhanna-raid and salmon-climb up the gold glittering fall of your piss, your treacherous ladder of salts and acids, bringing you back into touch with Mother Ground, the great, the planetary pool of electrons making you one with your prototype" (p. 704). To be "one with your prototype" is as simple a definition of pantheism as one can obtain. The chain has reemerged in Pynchon and Dillard primarily in alchemical form: "These are our letters, our words: they too can be modulated, broken, recoupled, redefined, co-polymerized one to the other in worldwide chains that will surface now and then over long molecular silences .... " (p. 414). The very language of Gravity's Rainbow is conceived as a form of connective tissue, a chain of being, sent "out of the silences after all, in again to the chain-linked fields of the Word" (p. 822). God's posts still form the boundaries of the pantheist world. 31. Pynchon practically plagiarizes Melville's reference to Ptolemey's Alexandrian elephants, and adds "if there is no telling what a drunken human will do, so much less a herd of drunken elephants" (V, [New York: Bantam, 1973], pp. 65-66). For a discussion of Melville's ongoing use of several popular phrases of journalism to depict the elephant and the quest, see Donald J. Yannella's "'Seeing the Elephant' in Mardi," in Artful Thunder: Versions of the Romantic Tradition in American Literature in Honor of Howard P. Vincent, ed. Robert DeMott and Sanford Marovitz (Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1975), pp. 105-18. 32. Of course, these are somewhat generic animal similes, but Melville and Pynchon employ them with far too great a frequency and determination for them to remain without specific function for their epistemologies: "I was always weaseling in," like so much else in Pynchon, threatens to become a literal statement, and as the borders between men and animals, between metaphors and identity or equivalence, blur, any such description becomes reified (V, p. 156).</page></plain_text>
