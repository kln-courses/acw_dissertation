<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENERAL ARTICLE Bastard Flowers George Gessert E very year, ornamental plant breeders hybrid- ize and evaluate millions of plants [1]. Among these, only the aesthetically favored ones live. The majority die on compost heaps or are plowed back into the earth. Painters, sculptors and designers typically learn rudiments of aesthetic decision- making in school, but there are no classroom courses about aesthetics for plant breeders-and no philosophers, histori- ans or professional critics of plant aesthetics. From time to time, garden writers comment on the aesthetic qualities of hybrids, but most comments are very brief. Garden writers are not obliged-as are art critics-to explain preferences or even to express preferences at all. Many landscape designers and garden writers use the aes- thetic approach pioneered by GertrudeJekyll. Born in London in 1843, Jekyll came from a wealthy family that was sufficiently free-thinking to allow her to attend art school-something that women rarely did in the nineteenth century. She was drawn to the ideas of William Morris, who championed the crafts. In her 30s she turned her attention from painting and decorating to gardening, and for the rest of her life, until her death in 1932, she designed gardens and wrote about gardening. She compared gardening to painting, and her attitude to- ward plants was much like a premodern painter's attitude to- ward pigments. Her writings communicate deep fondness for plants, but the values of species, varieties and individual plants were subordinate to other considerations: the creation of color schemes in perennial borders, for example. Jekyll's embrace of ornamental plants was so wide that at times she wrote as if there were no bad ornamentals, only poorly grown or ill-placed ones. Such an approach made good sense during her lifetime, when plant explorers were bringing a wealth of new plants to England from around the world. The useful- ness of a new species or variety may take decades of trial and error to determine. Jekyll's spirit of openness and accommo- dation encouraged patient evaluation. She was not so welcoming, however, when it came to hy- brids. Although she did not categorically oppose hybridiza- tion, she firmly rejected most hybrids as aesthetically inferior. She often delivered her aesthetic judgments about cultivars with little or no explanation. For example, Jekyll described ageratum 'Swanley Blue' as, simply, "one of the best." She wrote that among calendula varieties, "by far the best is the double, deep orange-coloured form called Orange King," but she neither named nor described any other calendula variet- ies. Penstemon hartwegii had been "much improved," but in what way she did not mention [2]. OccasionallyJekyll provided slightly more information. She condemned double canterbury bells [3] as "confused and dis- figured" [4] and called the double Madonna lily "a wretched, misshapen thing" [5]. Yet she had nothing but praise for double roses [6], some of which look thoroughly wretched and disfig- ured to me. She seemed to prefer the color white in hybrids, irrespective of context. The "best" gypsophila was "quite white, the type [sic] plant having pinkish bloom." Pure white rocket was also "the best," as was white ragwort (Sene- cio elegans) [7]; red ragwort, on the other hand, was "rank ma- genta" [8]. Jekyll believed that "rank" magenta was the only ABSTRACT Gardeners and plant breed- ers judge ornamental plants by their aesthetic characteristics. However, horticulture does not ac- commodate the discussion of many key questions in plant selec- tion. For example, what are the roles of class and culture in deter- mining taste? Does ornamental plant breeding debase wild plants and contribute to the war against wild nature? What are the effects of the market on plant aesthetics? The author surveys the history of such questions; he claims that by attending to them, we can lay groundwork for a conscious art of evolution. color "that cannot be worthily employed in some well-consid- ered connection or combination" [9]. Fig. 1. Beans and St. Johnswort: gardening as war. Thoreau gave up growing beans because gardening requires killing weeds, such as St. Johnswort. He assumed that St. Johnswort was a wild Ameri- can native, but actually, it had invaded North America from Eu- rope and was wild in a qualified sense only: like many weeds, St. Johnswort thrives on the disturbed soils associated with human ac- tivities and occurs much less commonly apart from people. Beans, on the other hand, are ancient natives of the Americas. George Gessert (artist), 1230 West Broadway, Eugene, OR 97402, U.S.A.

Some later garden writers thought differently. Vita Sackville-West and others produced a flower-color hierarchy in which white is the purest and most beautiful color, followed by blue, pale pink and pale yel- low. Below these are purple and rose- red, then bright reds and yellows, and pale orange. Magenta tests the limits of condescension, but beneath magenta are vile colors, such as gaudy oranges or muddy browns, tasteless under any cir- cumstance. This color hierarchy has been influential among British and North American gardeners for more than half a century. Jekyll never tried hybridizing, but she made selections in her garden at Munstead, Surrey, and saved seeds of plants that she considered especially promising. She replanted the seed and selected again from the next generation. In this way she produced a columbine, 'Munstead White' [10], and an opium poppy, 'Munstead Cream Pink,' which resembled a double peony [11]. For at least 45 years, she selected primroses, and she produced a yellow polyanthus strain named 'Munstead Bunch.' Jekyll felt an almost mystical connection with primroses, and wrote about them with quiet joy: It must have been quite forty-five years ago, sometime in the early seventies of the last century, that I came upon a bunch-flowered primrose in a cottage garden. ... [The flower was of a new color] and I secured the plant. The next year, from some other source, came a yellowish one, much of the same character. They were of a quality that would now be thought very poor, but they were allowed to seed, and among the seedlings some of the best were kept. Gradually, from yearly selection, the quality improved, and, as the grower's judgment became more criti- cal, so more and more of the less satis- factory primroses were discarded. It was an immense pleasure, as the years went on, to see the coming of some new type or some new degree of colouring, and to watch for the strengthening of some desired quality [12]. She goes on for two more pages to dis- cuss color, petal number, petal-notches, frills, eyes and the shapes of anthers and pistils. It is her best writing about the aes- thetic considerations involved in selec- tion. Limited as these remarks are, few writers since her time have done better. Yet much has changed. For gardeners in temperate regions, the great era of plant exploration is over. Plant explorers continue to make discoveries, of course, but what was once a flood of new plants has slowed to a trickle. Only in the trop- ics does plant exploration continue on a grand scale. Oscar Bressane, who collects plants in Brazil for landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx, has recently helped gather thousands of wild plants for horti- cultural evaluation [13]. Many of these may prove valuable in tropical gardens, but few are likely to find their way into temperate gardens. For temperate gar- deners, aesthetic concern has shifted from new species to new hybrids. Plant catalogs are filled with some of the most extreme hyperbole in the En- glish language, while horticultural guide- books offer terse descriptions of plants as physical entities or charming mysteries. Absent is thoughtful, in-depth discussion of plant aesthetics. Plant societies offer little help. Most reduce aesthetics to for- mulas and popularity contests. For ex- ample, the American Iris Society's 1985 handbook divides bearded irises into eight separate classes and assigns a scale of points for judges to evaluate each class. The scale for miniature tall bearded irises is typical (see Table 1). The handbook says nothing about how these numbers were assigned and discusses no aesthetic considerations in detail. Color should be "brilliant, deli- cate or rich," "bright and pleasing," and should "create harmony," but must never "strike a discordant note" [14]. This is excellent advice for shopping- mall decor, but it has nothing to do with art or nature. Both are full of discords. VIEWS FROM THE OUTSIDE Plant societies and most professional garden writers avoid controversy like the plague. As a result, they turn their backs on some of the most important issues in gardening and especially in plant selec- tion. Anthropologists, novelists and po- ets are not so constrained, and from them we can learn what most garden writers avoid. From anthropologists we learn, first of all, that not everyone loves flowers. The colors and forms of flowers produce not only admiration, but a variety of other responses, including suspicion, disgust and boredom. The only thing that is clearly universal in human reactions to flowers are the perimeters set by human physiology. For example, flowers less than half an inch across tend to be over- looked, unless they are extremely fra- grant or numerous. To a considerable extent, response to flowers is culturally determined. Flowers do not figure prominently in the decora- tion, clothing, stories or poetry of most African cultures south of the Sahara, and Africans do not grow ornamentals except where Islamic or European influences are strong [15]. Something similar was true among the agricultural peoples of the Amazon Basin before the arrival of Europeans. Social anthropologist Jack Goody attributes the absence of flowers in most African cultures to the remark- able fluidity of their social systems. Al- though Africa had kings and slaves, fre- quent intermarriage among classes preserved a degree of social homogene- ity that had disappeared long ago in the stratified societies of Eurasia and in other ancient centers of ornamental plant culture, such as Mexico and Peru. Ornamentals, according to Goody, evolved in significant part as luxuries that denote class. A result of entrenched class systems has been an elaborated con- sciousness of flowers [16]. This elaborated consciousness pro- duced new ways of describing flowers and new evolutionary opportunities for plants. For example, beginning about 2,500 years ago, double flowers, which are rare in the wild and ill-adapted for survival, found a favorable niche in gar- dens [17]. Pliny the Elder faulted a cer- tain rose for having too few petals. He criticized another for being too small, and several others for lacking perfume [18]. Pliny's preferences for doubling, fragrance and large size are shared by many gardeners today. Shamans created the first gardens in China. These gardens had ceremonial uses and contained magical plants- probably analogous to contemporary medicinal plants and ornamentals-val- ued for their powers to heal and to con- centrate natural energy. By the period of the Warring States (481-221 B.C.), Chi- Table 1.

Emperor Han Wu- ti (141-86 B.c.) had two lakes built with replicas of the legendary islands of the immortals constructed in each. The is- lands had winter-blooming flowers, "spirit trees" and magical herbs. The pur- pose of these artificial islands was to lure immortal beings and gain the secrets of immortality for the emperor [19]. Only an emperor could take things so far. By Han Wu-ti's time, many parts of China were densely populated, arable land was in short supply, and a land-use ethic had evolved that discouraged acqui- sition of large estates for nonutilitarian purposes, except by the emperor. The government confiscated huge game parks belonging to certain powerful offi- cials and gave the land to the poor. Sometimes the government confiscated gardens as well [20]. The Han Chinese saw what we call ornamental plants as magical and healing in some circum- stances or as luxury items and expres- sions of greed in others. Very similar re- actions to ornamentals occur today in Western society. In the Renaissance, a few writers cen- sured garden flowers for being unnatu- ral, a criticism that was to become so embedded in Western culture that to- day botanists distinguish between "natu- ral" and "artificial" hybrids, and speci- mens of humanly hybridized plants are excluded from most herbariums, as if domesticated plants were biological ephemera or somehow outside of na- ture. Shakespeare's Perdita, a virtuous and intelligent young woman, would not grow "streak'd gillyvors" (dian- thuses) because they were "nature's bas- tards" [21]. In Shakespeare's plays, bas- tards usually embody falsehood. They are often traitors or usurpers and indi- cate a breakdown of the natural order. Andrew Marvell condemned a wide range of ornamentals. In a 1681 poem, The MowerAgainst Gardens, garden plants manifest human corruption: Luxurious man, to bring his vice in use Did after him the world seduce And from the fields the flowers and plants allure, Where Nature was most plain and pure [22]. Marvell disapproved of garden roses for having the "taint" of strange per- fumes, and he compared double carna- tions to "double minds," or hypocrites. Tulips, which Marvell mistakenly be- lieved were white in the wild, had be- come penciled with color, suggesting Fig. 2. A portrait of Lenin composed of sedum and other plants. There are red salvias in the foreground. Alma Ata, Kazakhstan, USSR, 1987. (Photo: Kate Rogers Gessert) painted ladies, the epitome of immoral- ity in late seventeenth-century England. He condemned the bulb trade in Hol- land, and also the search for new orna- mental plants beyond European shores. Marvell reserved his most scathing criticism for grafted fruits. They created "forbidden mixtures," a term that sug- gests adultery and bestiality, as well as agricultural practices condemned in the Bible, such as crossbreeding of cattle and sowing of mixed seeds [23]. Marvell invoked the Bible quite selectively. The Bible contains no injunctions against grafting. In fact, according to Romans 11:17-24, God not only approves of grafting, but metaphorically practices it, joining onto the rootstock of faith those who return to Him. Marvell's criticism of grafting and plant selection was probably a reaction to the scientific spirit of his time, which was laden with Faustian vices. Francis Bacon's essay, New Atlantis, written about 1625, describes a utopia that is, in effect, a gigantic laboratory where human do- minion over the rest of life approaches the absolute. In this utopia are orchards, gardens and parks where men practice grafting, create new plants and turn one kind of tree into another. Scientists keep animals and birds of all sorts for dissec- tions and experiments: By art likewise we make them greater or taller than their kind is, and con- trariwise dwarf them and stay their growth.... Also we make them differ in color, shape, activity, many ways. We find means to make commixtures and copulations of divers kind, which have produced many new kinds [species], and them not barren, as the general opinion is. We make a number of kinds of serpents, worms, fishes, flies, of pu- trefaction.... [24] This brings to mind germ war research. Nowhere in New Atlantis does Bacon con- sider that power over nature might be a mixed blessing, or that animals may suf- fer. He does not even consider that there may be ethical issues involved in our rela- tions with nonhuman beings. Bacon men- tions possible benefits for humankind, but his main motivation seems to be avid curiosity, fortified by faith that knowledge brings earthly power and, perhaps, even brings men closer to God. As for aesthet- ics, Bacon flatly rejects concern for beauty in orchards, parks and gardens, because beauty might conflict with ex- perimentation. From ancient Persia through the Middle Ages, gardens were evocative of paradise, but that association weakened in Europe after the Renaissance. Marvell's contemporary, John Milton, pointedly described Eden as sylvan and Gessert, Bastard Flowers 293</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 3. Old and oldest roses.

(right) A species rose. without either flower beds or the knot gardens that were centerpieces of seven- teenth-century horticulture in Europe [25]. Oliver Goldsmith took things con- siderably farther. In The Deserted Village, he compared the vast private parks and landscape gardens of the aristocracy to graves [26]. In the late eighteenth cen- tury, the period in which Goldsmith wrote, landscape architects such as Ca- pability Brown, inspired to some extent by Jesuit descriptions of Chinese gar- dens, rejected the geometric regularity of earlier European garden design and instead mimicked sheep meadows and woods [27]. But among the economic underpinnings of this so-called reign of nature were the Enclosure Laws, which ruined many small independent farmers and forced them out of the countryside [28]. Most of these people ended up in industrial slums or had to abandon En- gland altogether to begin life over as best they could in distant lands. The Deserted Village idealizes lost rural life, but the poem is unsentimental in its recognition that gardens reflect eco- nomic and social conditions. Impressive gardens have a price that can be high in terms of human suffering. Goldsmith recognized the need for what we call sustainable lifestyles and issued a clear warning that separating the realms of daily life-the natural, the aesthetic and the ethical-leads to catastrophe. CEFTFRRATION OF WEEDS With the rise of industrialism and ro- manticism, wild nature was simulta- neously devastated and deified. A few writers began to question gardening of any sort-even for food-because gar- dening meant cut forests, disturbed soils and assaults on primeval nature. Near Walden Pond, Thoreau had a small bean field, which he cared for with considerable ambivalence. He found the hot sun and long hours of hoeing less bothersome than the nagging sense that his beans replaced a far sweeter wildness, represented by weeds. Thoreau felt that he had no clear right to disturb "their delicate organizations so ruthlessly" or to make "invidious distinctions" with his hoe [29]. He compared his work to war, and after a season of it, gave up gardening. His favorite weed was the graceful, many-stamened St. Johnswort, which Thoreau assumed was a native New En- gland plant (Fig. 1). Ironically, St. Johnswort had crossed the Atlantic with European settlers and was as much a newcomer to America as Thoreau's own family. The common bean, on the other hand, had evolved on American soil and was a true native. Thoreau acknowl- edged that Indians probably grew beans on the very land he hoed, but because beans are domesticated plants, Thoreau found little in them to defend once his experiment in gardening was over. Weeds also came in for praise by Tennyson, who considered thistles supe- rior to garden roses [30]. Gerard Manley Hopkins associated weeds with Eden [31], and Whitman celebrated democratic men and women by compar- ing them to leaves of grass. This meta- phor includes lawns and fields of grain but, in the context of Whitman's poetry, more strongly suggests prairies, marshes and weeds. THE GARDEN OF EVIL Nathaniel Hawthorne was ambivalent about weeds. He considered them em- blematic of humankind's fallen condi- tion, and yet sacred, "more essential to the well-being of the world than the most precious fruit or grain" [32]. He was equally ambivalent about gardens. In "Rappaccini's Daughter," he describes a garden in which almost every plant had been hybridized by its owner, a scientist named Dr. Rappaccini. The hybrids' gorgeousness seemed fierce, passionate, and even unnatural.... Several, also, would have shocked a delicate instinct by an appearance of artificialness, indi- cating that there had been such commixture and, as it were, adultery of various vegetable species, that the pro- duction was no longer of God's making, but the monstrous offspring of man's depraved fancy, glowing with only an evil mockery of beauty [33]. At the center of Rappaccini's garden is a shrub with flowers whose fragrance causes drowsiness. The plant is so poison- ous that even picking a flower is fatal. However, Rappaccini has habituated his daughter, Beatrice, to this tree of death. Immune to its poisons, Beatrice herself has become poisonous. Any contact with her is fatal. She is lethal even to lizards and butterflies, but Beatrice has no de- sire for destructive power, and conse- quently her father's garden is her prison and her nun's cell. The story ends with savage irony: a young man falls in love with Beatrice and gives her a potion in- tended to restore her to "normal" life, but instead the potion kills her. The plants in Rappaccini's garden evoke the lethal spell of scientific uto- pias like Bacon's, as well as the bella- donna, mandrake and henbane of Euro- pean witches and the daturas of the Americas. His plants also arouse more fundamental fears. We have always been somewhat afraid of plants, as well we should be. At an early age, children must be taught not to eat strange leaves, berries and mushrooms. What is new about Rappaccini's plants is not that they are conscious creations, but that they are expressions of a quest for scien- tific knowledge so consuming that no sacrifice is too great, not even the sacri- fice of one's own child. And once ha- bituated to the man-made garden, there may be no way out except death. MICROSCOPIC MALICE No one has more vehemently criticized ornamental plant breeding than John Ruskin. In one oft-quoted passage he wrote that the garden is an ugly thing, even when best man- aged: it is an assembly of unfortunate beings, pampered and bloated above their natural size, stewed and heated 294 Gessert, Bastard Flowers</page><page sequence="5">into diseased growth; corrupted by evil communication into speckled and in- harmonious colours; torn from the soil which they loved, and of which they were the spirit and glory, to glare away their term of tormented life among the mixed and incongruous essences of each other, in earth that they know not and in air that is poison to them [34]. This appeared in one of Ruskin's ear- liest works, an essay on architecture pub- lished in 1837 under the nom de plume Kata Phusin. At the end of his life he was still fulminating against ornamental plant breeding, and in much the same terms. In Proserpina, parts of which were published between 1875 and 1886, he described a certain veronica as wild [italics Ruskin's], of the wildest, and proud in pure descent of race; sub- mitting itself to no follies of the cur- breeding florist [ornamental plant breeder].... I have never seen it pro- voked to glare into any gigantic impu- dence at a flower show [35]. Proserpina is one of the most daunt- ingly peculiar books on plants ever writ- ten. Racism, swamps of nostalgia and dense thickets of vanity surround Ruskin's many insights. To make things more difficult for the reader, the book is unfinished. Written partly in essay form, partly as lecture notes and partly as imaginary conversations with young women, Proserpina focuses on plants through their names. Ruskin found many plant names unsatisfactory, and he proposed a new nomenclature based upon ethics and aesthetics, which he be- lieved were inseparable from one an- other and from nature. He wallowed in anthropomorphism, writing humorlessly of "decent flowers" and "ungracious flowers," of calyxes with tempers and of "impertinent plants." He attacked Darwin and other biologists, accusing them of a "phrenzy" of "micro- scopic malice" for seeing "nasty necessi- ties"-i.e. sexuality-in the forms of flowers [36]. Yet we should not altogether dismiss him. In spite of his Puritanism and senti- mentality he recognized an issue that most scientists of his time failed to ad- dress: namely, the danger of attempting to separate the inner and outer worlds. The forms, colors and textures of all liv- ing things invite intellectual, emotional, sensual, aesthetic and ethical responses. Ruskin's project-to find unity among these responses and at least a measure of unity within human consciousness-re- mains as important today as it ever was. Ruskin also recognized that non- sexual delight affects how organisms in- teract and is a key to survival for many plants. For example, Ruskin speculated that the beauty of fruits such as plums was due to natural ordinance, which adapted nature to humankind's aes- thetic needs [37]. Few people today would explain the colors and forms of fruits in this way, and Ruskin conve- niently failed to recognize that plant breeders have changed the aesthetic characteristics of plums as much as tu- lips, but his underlying question is im- portant: Why are we aesthetically drawn to certain plants? This question can be expanded-are we genetically predis- posed to live at our best among the di- versity of shapes, colors, textures, tastes and fragrances that plants produce? Are wild or cultivated plants more fulfilling, or do they fulfill different needs? Should gardening be part of the core curriculum in grammar schools? In what ways should public policy be directed to ensure the presence of plants in people's daily lives? Ruskin projected parts of his inner world upon plants. Given that under or- dinary circumstances the world is a screen to most of us, what more benefi- cial screen for everyday projections than plants? Ruskin acknowledged what very few garden writers today recognize: the proper study of flowers is the study of human consciousness and, conversely, the proper study of humankind must in- clude plants. Irrespective of whether or not one agrees with Ruskin, his writings Fig. 4. An auricula. Au- riculas enjoyed their greatest prestige in the eighteenth century. No plants more perfectly embody the synthesis of artifice and charm so / valued at that time. about plants can serve as reminders that plants are not merely raw materials or luxuries, but beings at the very center of human life. To discuss plants properly is to open doors to every aspect of human experience. Ancient peoples, who wor- shipped vegetation deities, knew this. We urgently need to relearn it. WAR In the struggles of the twentieth century, ornamental plants have frequently served as propaganda. Bolshevism, for example, raised the fortunes of red-flow- ered bedding plants to unprecedented heights (Fig. 2). Never before had red salvia come so close to becoming a domi- nant life form, with seas of it filling pub- lic gardens from the Baltic to the Pacific. In the People's Republic of China, sun- flowers enjoyed favor because the Com- munist Party likened itself to the sun and the people to flowers that turned forever to the light. Taiwanese Nationalists re- acted by suspecting anyone who grew sunflowers of having Communist sympa- thies, and, even today, with Mao Tse-tung and Chiang Kai-shek only memories, any- thing decorated with sunflowers makes a poor gift to a Taiwanese. Probably the most extreme ideological reaction to or- namentals in history occurred during the Cultural Revolution, when Red Guards systematically exterminated ornamental plants, along with goldfish, for being nonutilitarian. At the Peking Botanic Gessert, Bastard Flowers 295</page><page sequence="6">Garden, Red Guards trampled flower beds and smashed greenhouses as ves- tiges of decadence [38]. In the West, ornamentals continue to signify class, one of their oldest roles. However, this once simple role has be- come complex. Beginning with the French Revolution, the association be- tween ornamentals and high social sta- tus weakened as more and more middle and working class people grew flowers. Most twentieth-century garden writers have celebrated the democratization of ornamental horticulture, but a few have resisted-most often indirectly- through code words, "in" jokes and by equating aesthetic superiority with that which is rare, expensive or difficult to grow. Vita Sackville-West, the best known twentieth-century garden writer, occa- sionally delivered aesthetic judgments in the vocabulary of class war, specifically the war of the upper class against all oth- ers: "I really hate groundsel, a hideous little vulgarian for whom the only good thing to be said is that it can so easily be suppressed at birth," and "I am all for playing rough with things [such as privet] that play rough with us, for mak- ing them behave as our servants, not our masters" [39]. Her reactions were not always so vio- lent, and her concern for quality was not determined only by class, but she re- turned to class war sporadically. She loved wild plants, yet, with the tradi- tional aristocrat's disdain for intellectu- als, wrote, "You have to be a very high- brow gardener indeed to like dead nettles" [40]. Species crocus grown in bowls reminded her of works by Faberg--an association that at first seems affected, considering the contrast between the exquisite simplicity of spe- cies crocuses and the high-kitsch gim- micks of Faberge. But Faberge was the Romanovs' Disney, so his work was a standard of artfulness to Sackville-West. She disliked double flowers-unless they had the approval of Old Europe or of Old China, which was Europe's only possible equal, according to a tradi- tional, high-cultural point of view. Thus, she dismissed double sagitarrias from Ja- pan, but treated double roses, tree peo- nies and carnations-three fixtures of English manor-house gardens-as be- yond reproach. In his book Second Na- ture, Michael Pollan analyzed the dis- creet class war that Sackville-West led in her championing of old roses: Modern roses, as Vita Sackville-West used to complain to anyone who would listen, are insufficiently subtle, too highly colored, altogether too ... bour- geois. Sackville-West was the forerun- ner of a whole faction of rose Tories who agitate (decorously, of course) against hybrid roses and cling to dreams of a restoration for their be- loved albas, gallicas, damasks, bour- bons and centrifolias [41]. Graham Stuart Thomas is the leading spokesman for the old rose faction to- day. He has been so effective an advo- cate of the ancien regime of roses that old roses serve as models for some contem- porary breeders, most notably David Austin. Austin's "English roses" are not Fig. 5. 'Peace,' by F. Meilland, introduced in France as 'Mme A. Meilland' in 1942. In 1945, it was renamed 'Peace.' Peace was the first patented rose and is the best-selling rose in history. exact copies of old roses, but reinterpre- tations of them, artfully Tory and in- formed by the past-but only the rela- tively recent past. Like most aesthetic conservatives, Austin recalls only a few centuries in his work, not millenia or ages. For him "old" roses are mostly nineteenth-century roses-and not wild singles, which are the oldest roses and the ones which have been valued throughout most of history (Fig. 3). FASHION AND DNA Class-determined tastes exert pressures on breeders and on the evolution of or- namental plants, but the marketplace exerts much greater pressure, at least in the United States. All ornamental plants today are filtered through the market- place, except for volunteer plants, plantings that survived from previous times, and informal trades and gifts, which are among the pleasures of gar- dening. The more prevalent an orna- mental plant, the more likely it is to have been extensively hybridized and genetically patterned to fit into con- sumer culture. Typically the most mar- ketable ornamentals are familiar, large- flowered and variable. Above all, they must be easy to grow under extremely diverse conditions. This is crucial for successful marketing across bioregions. Such plants as petunias (originally from Argentina), marigolds (from Mexico), begonias (pantropical, but primarily from Brazil), roses (widespread in the northern temperate region) and tall bearded irises (from Europe and the Near East) are grown commercially in the United States as monocultural crops in fields that sometimes extend over dozens or even hundreds of acres. Some of these plants have evolved so rapidly in only a century of breeding that they re- semble their original species the way that Chihuahuas resemble wolves. The market also encourages horticul- tural fads and fashions. Some of these go back many centuries. In Elizabethan England, for example, the carnation briefly rivaled the rose as queen of gar- den flowers, and, in early seventeenth- century England, double flowers were so popular that men dreamed of making their fortunes by discovering a way to turn single flowers into doubles. The garden writer John Parkinson tried his hand at it by transplanting singles just before the full moon [42]. Capitalism and horticulture dramati- cally converged in the famous outbreak of speculation known as tulipomania, 296 Gessert, Bastard Flowers</page><page sequence="7">which swept Holland from 1634 to 1637. Investors sold and resold bulbs that never left the ground. Single bulbs went for the equivalent of tens of thousands of today's dollars, a staggering amount to pay for a plant [43]. Tulipomania is remembered as an aberration, but it was actually a harbinger of the commodi- fication of life. Speculation in ornamen- tal plants has continued ever since the seventeenth century, and fortunes con- tinue to be made and lost on flowers. There were manias for hyacinths and auriculas in the eighteenth century (Fig. 4), and for dahlias in the nineteenth. For centuries there has also been specu- lation in spices, tea, coffee, liquor, to- bacco and refined sugar, all of which are horticultural products as nonessential as tulip bulbs. In 1983, a racehorse colt re- portedly sold for $10 million, and some stallions may be worth more than $100 million [44]. When Genentech, a pio- neer biotechnology firm, first offered stock on the open market in October 1980, shares went from $35 to $89 in sev- eral hours of trading. The firm raised $55 million the first day, even though the company did not have a single or- ganism or product on the market [45]. How do horticultural fads arise? Their underpinnings are obscure, but this much is clear: without marketing they would not exist. A common marketing strategy is to associate new hybrids with fashionable phenomena of popular cul- ture. Many plants bear the names of ce- lebrities, desserts and tourist meccas. But, names are usually more than marketing devices-they also express aesthetic in- tent. Among roses, 'Dolly Parton' has more genes for the colors and forms of pop culture than does 'Redoubte.' An astonishing example of this cargo- cult-like strategy of associations took place in connection with the Gulf War. In the spring of 1992, the front cover of Wayside Gardens' catalog featured 'Desert Peace,' a red-and-yellow rose "named to honor the peaceful conclusion of conflict in the Middle East." The cata- log went on to claim that 'Desert Peace' had "all the ear-marks of becoming a clas- sic, promising to even surpass its illustri- ous parent...." [46] However, by the time 'Desert Peace' appeared on the mar- ket, the dominant media, along with most Americans, wanted only to forget Iraq. So, in 1993, 'Desert Peace' was demoted to page 8 of Wayside's catalog, accompa- nied by modest new copy stating that the rose expressed "hope for peace" [47]. 'Desert Peace's' "illustrious parent" was 'Peace' (Fig. 5), which was released in 1945 and of which more than 100 mil- lion plants have been sold [48]. Not inci- dental to the fabulous success of 'Peace' was the fact that it was the first patented rose, and patenting fueled its marketing. AESTHETICS AND EVOLUTION While Shakespeare's Perdita rejected streaked carnations as "nature's bas- tards," his Polixenes, the philospher- king of Bohemia, came to the defense of plant breeding. "This is an art," he said, "which does mend nature-change it rather-but the art itself is nature" [49]. Polixenes rejected the notion that orna- mental plant breeding betrays nature, but he left unanswered a more difficult question: are streaked carnations good art? Three hundred and seventy years have passed, and we still cannot answer that question. Very few garden writers engage in criti- cisms of ornamental plants. The most important of these criticisms include: 1. Ornamental plants serve as class signifiers and status symbols. 2. Ornamental plant breeding de- grades nature and contributes to the war against nature. 3. Highly bred ornamental plants are kitsch. 4. Highly bred ornamental plants are expressions and instruments of con- sumer society. I breed irises and other ornamentals. I would not do this if I thought that these criticisms told the whole story about ornamentals, but I think that these criticisms are important. To me, the greenhouses, gardens and field plots of flower breeders are among the most remarkable phenomena on earth. They are places where aesthetic consciousness becomes an active evolutionary force. Plant breeding has always been an art, and one that is potentially superior to other arts. But, in practice, plant breed- ing rarely rises above craft, because most gardeners and garden writers ignore se- rious questions and criticism. By doing so, they collaborate to create a lesser, complacent art. References and Notes 1. My estimate is very rough because few ornamental plant breeders publish statistics. Edward Steichen grew between 50,000 and 100,000 hybrid del- phinium seedlings each year during the 1930s. He hired five gardeners to help him. (RonaldJ. Gedrim, "Edward Steichen's 1936 Exhibition of Delphinium Blooms," in History of Photography 17, No. 4 [London: Taylor and Francis, 1993] p. 320). In the United States today, daylily breeders probably grow between 100,000 and 250,000 seedlings annually. (R.W. Munson,Jr., Hemerocallis, the Daylily [Portland, OR: Timber, 1989] p. 21). I have no statistics for other ornamental plants. Irises, roses, orchids, chrysanthe- mums, carnations and lilies compare with or exceed daylilies in variability and popularity. Hortus Third, an encyclopedia of cultivated plants, lists more than a thousand species of plants with cultivars. Most of these cultivars are the work of plant hybridizers and indicate something of the extent and diversity of or- namental plant breeding. 2.

I have used Latin names for the less familiar or- namentals, or for ornamentals with confusing com- mon names. For example, 'Red Ragwort' is a rare garden plant, andJekyll's name for it is almost ob- solete. "Ragwort" has become the common name for tansy, another plant altogether. 8.Jekyll [2] pp. 98-105. 9.
