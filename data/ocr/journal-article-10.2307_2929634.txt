<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marc Soriano From tales of warning to formulettes: the oral tradition in French children's literature The few studies of children's literature which have been published in France 1 hardly touch on works in the oral tradition. Nonetheless, for centuries storytelling was the only form of artistic expression which reached the great majority of French children. 2 If by chance these studies do consent to mention the oral repertory, they essential- ly confine themselves to fary tales, to those stories commonly known in the seventeenth century as contes de vieilles (old wives tales), or contes de mie (friendly tales), as if they were literature transmitted by "grannies" and deliberately intended for children. But that is not at all the case. These stories are almost entirely directed at an adult audience. To be convinced, one need only read most of them in their unadapted versions, as we find them for example in the large collections of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Very often they contain vulgarities, witticisms or scenes of horror which require a certain sophistication on the part of the audience in order to be understood or appreciated. Yet the criterion of "decency" was established in France only with the missions of the Counter-Reformation in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and even then it did not have the same strin- gent and obligatory character in the country and among the lower classes that it did in the cities, among well-to-do, cultivated people. 1 Including, alas, my Guide de la lituerature enfantine (Flammarion, 1959) which, partly because of this lack, I consider to be completely out of date. 2 At least until the Guizot Law on Primary Instruction in 1833, and perhaps even until the school laws of the Third Republic. See, on this subject, the fine book by Maurice Contard: L'Enseignement primaire en France de la Revolution a la Loi Guizot (1789-1833), (Lyon, 1959); and the more recent synthesis by Antoine Prost, L'Enseignement en France 1800-1967 (Armand Colin, "Collec- tion U," 1968). 24</page><page sequence="2">Marc Soriano Peasant children were raised in contact with the realities of existence, in the promiscuity of misery and ignorance. Even before Perrault legalized it in 1695 in a "modernist" spirit (in his preface to the collection, Contes en vers 3) the amalgam of the children's and the popular repertory must already have existed. It didn't occur to parents to keep the children from listening dur- ing those long evenings when someone told those fabulous stories which were not particularly meant for their ears. And usually the children - for want of something better, perhaps - enjoyed them. The dramatic action, the extraordinary adventures which filled them made them at least partly assimilable by young minds. It all came about as if this "childhood of art" through some sort of spontaneous alchemy was transformed into "art of childhood." In fact this is not true, and one of the most delicate tasks of contemporary pedagogy must be to separate out the components of this faulty alloy. I We should avoid this error so much the more that oral literature does include a number of stories destined specifically for children. These include certain "animal stories," "tales of warning," and most of that sort of nursery rhymes the French call formulettes. In this brief study I shall limit myself to giving a general idea of the vast repertory of these true children's stories, and to establishing its boundaries. * * * As far as one can tell, the "animal stories" made up a literature of transition which was quite naturally common to both adults and children. We know that Renard's wicked deeds were greatly en- joyed by the peasants and simple village folk, who undoubtedly 3 Preface to the fourth edition of Griselidis, followed by Peau d'Ane and the short story, Les Souhaits ridicules, Paris, 1695. 4 Indeed, teachers and parents often say in good faith, "what was good enough for us should be good enough for our children and for their children." This is partly true, and there is no need to rush out and destroy traditions. Still, we should keep in mind that psychology and psychoanalysis have been born and developed, and that our educational criteria have been refined. The children of the Old Regime also lived without vaccines and antibiotics. It seems to me that one of the tasks of teachers today is to make a selection from this vast repertory, using the criteria of our time. 25</page><page sequence="3">Yale French Studies enriched the stories with social and political chords. But they also pleased the children, who, as Henri Wallon has astutely remarked, 5 have a tendency to sympathise with animals, perhaps because they live on the same scale, and to identify with animals of the same size that they are, which might reasonably be one of the causes of the current popularity of "animal art" among young audiences. Le Roman de Renard is the most typical and successful of the summae of animal stories. But is it really a book for children? It seems to me that this work, stuffed with political and social allusions which require an understanding of masses of precise historic al- lusions, and including some frankly licentious episodes, notwith- standing its role as one of the finest and most important products of our literature, has ceased to be appropriate for children, or in any case for very young ones. However, it becomes a wonderful book for children again very easily, if meticulous, scrupulous writers take the trouble either to adapt it, or to present coherent extracts which cor- respond to the levels of comprehension of various age groups. 6 It has only been a short time since the importance of the "warn- ing tales" as a separate current of oral literature was recognized. The great French folklorist, Paul Delarue, was the first investigator to recognize this clearly, in an important series of articles published in the Bulletin Folklorique dIle de France, in 1952. His hypothesis has been the basis for a number of studies, such as that of Marianne Rumph in Germany: Little Red Riding Hood and the Tales of Warning. The Danish folklore expert Rubow examined Danish folk- lore with identical preoccupations in 1955. 5 Preface to the special number of Enfance devoted to children's books, 1956. 6 There are several good adaptations in French. Pere Castor (Paul Faucher), one of the great pioneers of children's literature in France, who died in 1967, edited several episodes intended for beginning readers (published by Flamma- rion). A broader adaptation, meant for readers in the ten to fifteen year-old age group, has been prepared by Leopold Chaveau for La Farandole, and there is another by Guillot, which won the Andersen prize. Finally, I must mention a fine complete translation-adaptation by Maurice Genevoix, which is appropriate for both adolescents and adults. 26</page><page sequence="4">Marc Soriano The first research to be undertaken - and it is still very fragment- ary - shows that there are a great many "tales of warning" in France. This label can be applied to all those stories whose purpose is to divert children from menacing dangers such as water, the forest, etc. So that the synchretic and anthropomorphic mind of the child can assimilate the lesson, the story materializes the danger by populat- ing the tale with wild animals or troubling personages, which means that monsters become associated with dangerous places. These boogey- men, sea monsters and other terrifying characters (to whom Delarue has consecrated a veritable bibliography in the work cited above) are reputed to lurk in these dangerous areas in wait for children, to draw them into their lairs and devour them. I came upon the basic process of development of these stories completely accidentally one day, upon hearing my wife (who at the time had no particular knowledge of folklore) explain to my youngest daughter that she mustn't lean out the window, because behind the shutter there lived a horrible old lady, "Mrs. Gravity," who grabbed little children and dragged them to the ground with amazing speed. This process, one notices, was already contaminated with the scientific terminology of our time. The best known of the "warning tales" in France is and always has been Little Red Riding-Hood. I shall not go into it in depth here, since I just made a long study of it in my book, Les Contes de Perrault, culture savante et traditions populaires. The versions of this story in the oral tradition which can be collected today have, not surprisingly, frequently undergone the influence of the version attributed to Perrault. Those which precede or are independent of Perrault (there are some) can be recognized by a certain number of characteristics which have continued to survive in spite of the celebrity of the text published in 1697: the motif of cruelty -pro- bably a reflection of a "primitive structure"- the motif of the blood and flesh of the grandmother which are placed on the bread-bin and which the little girl is invited to eat; the motif of the "familiar animal" -a cat or bird (or mysterious voice) which informs the child of what she is eating; the episode of the "ritual undressing," 27</page><page sequence="5">Yale French Studies a sort of strip-tease by Little Red Riding-Hood, who each time she takes off a garment asks the wolf where she should put it, which leads to an enigmatic or frankly menacing response from the fero- cious animal; and finally, a "happy ending" of a particular type, built on the scatological overtone of the "tie which sets free": the little girl pretends that she urgently needs to relieve herself, a pretext to escape from the monster. He, suspicious but slow-witted, gives in at last, after having taken the precaution of attaching her to a cord, from which she frees herself forthwith. The wide diffusion of this tale in print should not make us forget that there exist many others of the same type which are themselves very pretty and greatly enjoyed by children: for example that of La Chevre et les chevreaux, whose old age is certified by the well- known fable by La Fontaine, 7 which concludes with the ancient prob- erb in Picard dialect: Biaux Chires Loups, n'ecoutez mie, Mare tenchant chen fieux qui crie. My fine lord wolf please pay no mind While a mother scolds her son who whines. Paul Delarue remarks with perspicacity on the subject of these frightening creatures that "the monsters with which we threaten children to keep them away from water are especially numerous and varied, whereas to make them afraid of woods and paths leading into them, there is really only one monster which has remained traditionally the same for centuries and centuries: the wolf, terror of adults and children alike, the wolf who has in fact carried off and devoured so many children." 8 In spite of their diversity, all these stories have an identical structure which is explained by the effect sought: simple rhythyms, 7Fables, Book IV, 16. 8 Paul Delarue, Bulletin folklorique dIle de France, Oct.-Dec. 1951, p. 290. 28</page><page sequence="6">LM( C howl/r e~</page><page sequence="7">Yale French Studies formulae punctuating the climatic moments, dramatic dialogue which announces the imminent catastrophy and intensifies the "suspense." Some may find it surprising that the only stories of the traditional repertory which are aimed directly at children should be precisely those with unhappy endings. Nonetheless, that is the way it is, and this apparent paradox should not be immediately written off with an hypothesis of "cruelty" in children. The true reason is simpler. Even though these stories are presented as tales "purely for amuse- ment," they actually belong to educational literature, or better, func- tional literature. They take on meaning as soon as one recognizes their purpose, which is to frighten the child. It is true that in the end, certain children come to find pleasure in fear and cruelty. Adults themselves may be tempted to abuse this easy, all too effective teaching method. The warning tales pose some pedagogical problems which we ought to look at in the light of the contemporary behavioral sciences. It is interesting to note that the "pedagogy of fear" was already criticized at the time of Perrault. A "song" by le petit Coulanges, a relative and friend of Madame de Sevigne who frequented the same aristocratic and bourgeois salons as Perrault, furnishes us with a proof which is not lacking in color: 9 ... En faveur des petits enfants Je veux gronder les gouvernantes Qui pour les rendre obeissants Leur font des peurs extravagantes Et qui, contentes du succes, Les rendent peureux 'a jamais. On leur fait peur du loup garou, On leur fait peur de la grand'bete; Le dragon va sortir d'un trou Qui pour les avaler s'apprete. 9 Avis aux peres de famille to the tune of Les Ennuyeux. (In Chansons Choisies, ed. M. de Coulanges, 2 volumes, 1968.) 30</page><page sequence="8">Marc Soriano Enfin ces petits malheureux 'ont que des monstres autour d'eux. To speak out for the little child I feel that I must scold the nurse. For to keep him meek and mild She threatens with a monster curse, And happy to have calmed the strife Leaves him fearful all his life. He's haunted by the boogey-man; He's haunted by the werewolf's cry. The dragon's coming from his den To gulp him down. And by and by The frightened child is weak and cowed, Surrounded by a monster crowd... The theme and the structure of the "warning tales" have left their mark on our literature. They reappear in more elaborate, more or less contaminated forms in several of the major children's books, like La Chevre de Monsieur Seguin, one of the most famous and beloved of children's stories, in the Lettres de mon moulin by Alphonse Daudet, in Le Chdteau des loups, a very fine story published around ten years ago by Henri Troyat. * * * Another important part of the oral repertory intended for children is the childhood nursery rhyme or formulette. This collective expres- sion seems appropriate to designate that "literature of rhymes and games" which, says Eugene Rolland (author of the first large col- lection of these poems 10), "children have transmitted to one another 10 Eugene Rolland, Rimes et jeux de l'enfance (Paris: Masonneuve et Cie., 1883; reedition, 1968), p. 396. 31</page><page sequence="9">Yale French Studies throughout history, which is the only literature that amuses them, the only one appropriate to their mental development, and which is totally different from that which our "utilitarian" teachers would have them learn at any price." This very ancient literary form (we find traces of it in Rabelais and in a great many texts of popular inspiration 11) has only recently begun to be studied. For the last century, compulsory education and the influence of the printed text have certainly weakened and altered it; but in spite of these factors of decomposition, it remains an extremely tenacious and living form of literature, particularly because it belongs to an age group where the child does not yet know how to read, or at any rate has not yet mastered the mechanics of rapid reading, and where his memory is particularly fresh. Another factor which facilitates the transmission of these rhymes is their as- sociation with games teaching motor control or more generally with games transmitted by women (mothers and grandmothers, the first educators) who in our civilization still constitute the most stable and, by necessity, the most traditionalist element. Both modern pedagogy and the Surrealist movement, by re- cognizing the exceptional artistic quality of this "involuntary poetry," have facilitated the conservation effort. Educators and some con- temporary poets, such as Philippe Soupault, Robert Desnos, Raymond Queneau and Claude Roy, have been interested in these formulettes, collecting them and imitating them. 12 Certain studies have been made by men like Joisten, 13 or Philippe Soupault and Jean Bacaumont for the French radio, 14 and they have brought together an impressive number of the rhymes. 11 I have found many traces in the early poems by the Perrault brothers, particularly in their parody of Book VI of the Aeneid. 12 A great number of them have been collected in the journals printed by children in the experimental schools directed by Freinet, or according to his method. Andre Bay and Claude Roy on the one hand, and the psychologist Jean Chateau on the other, have published anthologies. 13 Charles Joisten, "La Vie traditionnelle enfantine dans les Hautes Alpes, enquete folklorique" Spring 1951-Winter 1953 and Spring-Winter 1954, Bul- letin de la Societe d'Ptudes Historiques des Hautes Aipes, nos. 45 and 46, pp. 44-51, 103-105, Gap, 1953-54. 14 Les Comptines de la langue franfaise, collected and commented by J. Bacaumont, Seghers, 1961, p. 366. 32</page><page sequence="10">Marc Soriano These collections use a mass of classifications based in some cases on the internal structure of the poems, in others on the presence or absence of puns, alliteration, etc. These linguistic distinctions are certainly very useful, but for the historian of children's literature, they have the drawback of making one forget that these little texts belong first to the category of functional literature. To me, the ap- parently more capricious classification by Eugene Rolland shows greater awareness of this reality. He makes it clear that these little works follow step by step the development of "small mankind" from his birth to the moment he leaves childhood. They rock him to sleep, make his first movements rhythmic, transforming them into games. Here, for example, is the Breton formulette which "explains" to a baby the circular movement of hands, by making them into puppets: Dansez, dansez bell'main, Yous aurez du gateau demain. (bis) Ah! la bell'main, la menette, Ah! la bell'main que j'ai! (from the region around Lorient, E. Rolland, p. 17) Dance, dance, pretty hand, Tomorrow you shall have some cake. (repeat) Oh my pretty hand, my little pretty hand, Oh that pretty hand of mine! There is another Breton formulette to permit inspection of the various parts of the face: Menton forchu - Bouche d'argent - Nez cancan - Joue bouillie - Joue rotie - (Eil de Picard - cEil de St. Martin - Tape, tape sur le robin. (Finistere, Ibid., p. 19) 33</page><page sequence="11">Yale French Studies Cleft chin, silver mouth, tattling nose, boiling cheek, roasting cheek, Picard eye, Saint Martin's eye, - Tap, tap on the snoot. and one for the fingers of the hand: Celui-ci a vu le lievre - celui-ci l'a couru - celui-ci l'a tenu - celui-ci l'a mange - celui-lta n'a rien eu - il a dit a sa mere: -Je n'ai pas eu, je n'ai pas eu. (Lorient) This one saw the hare; this one chased it; this one caught it; this one ate it; that one didn't get any. He said to his mother: "I didn't get any, I didn't get any!" * There are formulettes to make a crying child laugh, to make him hold still, to tickle him, etc. The greatest part of this literature is associated with games. There are round-dances, like that of the oats: Qui veut ouir, qui veut savoir Comme on se?me l'avoine (ici on imite le semeur) Mon per' la semait ainsi, Puis se reposait un p'tit, Tapait des pieds, battait des mains Et faisait le tour du vilain. Avoine, avoine, avoine, Le beau temps te ranxmne. (Region around Paris, E. Rolland, p. 100) If you want to hear, if you want to know How to sow the oats (here an imitation of the sower) * Translator's note: The English equivalent for many of these poems will be evident to the reader. The English toe-counting game, "This little Pig went to Market" is very similar to this one. 34</page><page sequence="12">Marc Soriano My father sowed them like this, Then he rested a little bit, Tapped his feet, clapped his hands, And went the round of the peasant man. Oats, oats, oats, oats, oats, oats, oats, oats, oats, Sunshine brings you back again. * There is also the roundelay of the "doctor and the kisses," which no doubt comes back into fashion at a less innocent age: Donne-moi le bras que je te guerisse, Car tu m'as l'air malade (bis) Lonla, Car tu m'as l'air malade! (pointing out a person of the opposite sex): Embrasse monsieur (ou madame) pour te guerir C'est un fort bon remede. (bis) Lonla, C'est un fort bon remerde. (ibid. p. 76) Give me your arm so I can cure you 'Cause you look sick to me (repeat) Tra-la 'Cause you look sick to me! (pointing out a person of the opposite sex): * English has many "action" games like this. A similar one is "Here We go round the Mulberry Bush". 35</page><page sequence="13">Yale French Studies Kiss this nice man (or lady) so you get well That is the best cure of all (repeat) Tra-la That is the best cure of all. Another variety of formulette is the little song called menterie ("tall tale") which corresponds to the age where the child begins to have negative judgment permitting him to differentiate and specify his ideas: Ah! j'ai vu, j'ai vu. Compe're, qu'as-tu vu? J'ai vu une grenuoille Qui filait sa quenouille Au bord d'un fosse'. -Compere, vous mentez. (ibid. p. 108) Oh, I saw something, I saw something. Hey pal, what'd you see? I saw a frog, Sawing a log Over the edge of a stream. Hey pal, you're lying to me. The randonne (a sort of circular poem, like "The House that Jack Built," or "As I was going to Saint-Ives") is another type of "function- al" poem. It enumerates the succession of causes and effects of a particular event: causes and effects which augment, then diminish, teaching the child without his noticing that events (or ideas) are generally logically linked together. Many of the formulettes called comptines (counting games) are meant to teach a child to count, an extremely serious operation at the age where he is trying, even in his games, to describe and inventory 36</page><page sequence="14">Marc Soriano the world. Jean Bacaumont remarks that this is a "preliminary to all games, a prelude accomplished ritually with attention and gravity to admit players to the game and to choose the beginner by chance, through the intervention of an occult power recognized by all and charged with a sort of oracular decision." 14 Am, strai, gram Pic et pic et colegram, Bourre et bourre et rataplam Am, strai, gram. * There seem to be formulettes for every occasion. Here is one for a malingerer: II a la fitevre de mouton; Ce qu'il mange, il le trouve bon. (Poitou, Ibid., p. 257) He's got sheep-fever; He's still a big eater. one for anger: Bisque, bisque, rage, Mange du fromage; Si le fromage n'est pas bon, Mange de la poison. (Quercy, Ibid., p. 274) * Translator's note: This is untranslatable. The English equivalent would be: "Eeney, meeney, miney, moe," etc. 37</page><page sequence="15">Yale French Studies Spite, spite, rage, Have a little cheese. If you don't like cheese, Eat some poison, please. and one for boredom: Je m'enuie, je ne sais pas quoi faire. Prends un marteau et tape-toi sur les doigts. (Ibid., p. 275) I'm so bored, I don't know what to do. Go take a hammer and beat on your hand. There is also one of pure verbiage, where the poem seems to get carried away with itself, but which, in spite of that, is not "art for art's sake" or simple verbal juggling, because it contains descriptions, inspections, comparisons and an awareness of progress which has been made, and that which remains to be made. Quand j'etais petit, je n'etais pas grand. Je montrais mon cul a tous les passants. When I was little, I was not a big guy. I showed my bottom to all passers-by. This formulette is still heard all over France, and I have come across it in an almost identical form in a story attributed to the poet JEtienne Pavillon and dated 1687. It is true that the critic and the historian are not in the habit of studying children's games as a form of artistic expression, because they undertake their research with a certain preconception of poetry and literature. But if, for instance, we agree on the convention of 38</page><page sequence="16">Marc Soriano defining poetry as a form which has a sort of consistency and charm which make it stick in the mind and play a real role in the life of he who recites it, we cannot deny the poetic quality of the poem-game of pince-sans-rire, * which all French children know by heart, and which has made all of them laugh until they cried: Je te tiens Tu me tiens Par la barbignette. Le premier qui rira Aura la clafette (la claquette) (Version from La Creuse, Ibid., p. 130) I have you, You have me By the chinny-chin-chin. And we'll give a smack (slap) To the first to grin. In "riddle" games, the mixture of popular imagination and the sumptuous poetic imagery of its expression sometimes produces deli- cate lines reminiscent of Japanese haiku: Qu'est-ce qui passe dans le bois Sans dechirer sa robe de sole? - (Le soleil.) Who goes walking in the wood And never tears her silken hood? - The sun. Because of their number, their quality and their variety, these formulettes rise like a veritable poetic continent whose exploration demands the concerted efforts of folklorists, linguists, historians, teachers, and so forth. At the present time, in this domain as well as * Translator's note: literally: "pinch-without-laughing," a kind of staring contest. The word now implies dry humor in adults. 39</page><page sequence="17">Yale French Studies that of the fairy tale, research seems to have pushed aside the "pro- blem of origins" in the somewhat rigid, formalistic nineteenth century sense of the phrase. Investigators accept the basically anonymous character and great age of the formulettes. All the scholars are in agreement on these two characteristics, although it is difficult to document them, at least for the moment. Historians of language have no doubt been able to observe the traces of certain historic events in some of the formulettes. For in- stance, in the famous nursery rhyme La Maere Michel, one can find the story of Lustucru, one of the leaders of the "Barefoot Revolt" in Normandy during the first half of the seventeenth century, or in other songs collected by Bacaumont, references to the war of 1870 or to the Eiffel Tower. Other specialists, such as Marcelle Bouteillier, here and there have found traces of proverbs, witchcraft formulae, etc. It seems reasonable to believe, however, that these are not part of the original material, but are details added during one of the "updat- ings" and "revivals" which have insured the survival of these rhymes until the present time. These observations would make it seem advisable to avoid the two extreme positions taken by certain specialists. Are the poems magical formulae, pieces borrowed by children from fragments of song, of sententiae, of fables, stories, etc., retained because of their sonority alone-that is, spontaneous creations by the children themselves-or are they conscious reworkings by adults? As Bacaumont says, these theories are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Their synthesis furnishes the most reasonable explanation of the origins of these children's rhymes, each of which nonetheless remains a special case which merits individual examination. This rapid foray into a rarely traveled sector permits us to make a certain number of essential remarks on the evolution of children's literature. The experience of generations of simple people, of those natural experimenters-parents-discovered long ago, centuries before the educational psychologists, the pedagogical "trick" of associating the acquisition of indispensable knowledge with games. Even if it be only 40</page><page sequence="18">Marc Soriano for this characteristic (and there are others) oral literature provides us with a veritable children's literature (or at any rate a perfectly differentiated current) at a time when this type of literature does not exist in the domain of the written, and when pedagogy has not recog- nized the child as a specialized audience. Popular tradition has pro- duced these works through continual confrontation of the parent's educational intentions and the child's possibilities of comprehension and assimilation. Thus it has profited from the inventive power of the former and the fresh imagination of the latter. This paradoxical but natural collaboration has produced an incredible variety of methods and rhythms to which the examples I have given here cannot do justice. The great quality of these nursery rhymes, in my opinion, is that artistic expression is never developed gratuitously, as amateurs of verbal games might tend to believe, but for its power of evocation and for its meaning. This explains their remarkable poetic value, which gives them a ritual value which both catches the child's attention, imbedding them in his memory, and astonishes the adult by their sobriety and richness: OQi est-il? Dans sa chemise, oii ii passe des deux bouts. (Cote d'Or, Ibid., p. 299) (Where is he? Inside his shirt, where he comes out at both ends.) A certain number of not necessarily bad poets, for example Ratis- bonne and Coppee in the nineteenth century, no doubt imagining that the French child did not have a poetic repertory comparable to the "nursery rhymes" of English children, tried to create one. This praise- worthy effort ended in failure. Certain critics have believed they could conclude from this that the "Frenchman does not have a poetic soul." I don't wish to be suspected of chauvinism, but I believe the 41</page><page sequence="19">Yale French Studies failure can be explained in another way. Like all peoples, the French possess a literature for children which is both rich and varied. It is the very quality of this repertory which causes the almost automatic rejection of the greater part of poetry composed for children by "professionals." Our children are accustomed to a poetry of such astonishing fantasy, and moreover one so profoundly functional, that the indispensable task of rejuvenating their literature becomes extreme- ly difficult, if not impossible. The Surrealists understood this: they alone have managed (and still it may be best to wait a little before making pronouncements) to furnish poems which children have ac- cepted and assimilated, by using (Desnos in particular) the very procedures of popular poetry. There is another important remark to be made. These rhymes are usually smiling or facetious, such as that of the agreement: Entendu, conclu, Trente-six fesses font dix-huit culs. (Boulogne-sur-mer, Ibid., p. 286 0. K. Now we've got 'em Thirty-six buttocks make eighteen bottoms. This elementary, basically scatological humor evidently reflects the uncensored style of life of the Old Regime, which gives it a simple, historical interest, but there is another trait which shouldn't be for- gotten. Most of the products of this oral tradition make every effort to teach children to laugh. They admit frankly that humor, irony and gaiety are indispensable acquisitions for a child, because they permit him to dominate his problems and have faith in life, These are natural functions in each of us, but they need to be developed. Let us not accept this orientation as the contribution of common sense. It is in reality an important experimental discovery, of a peda- gogical method which literature for children of the future will need to reflect upon and draw inferences from. Laughter is not only "in 42</page><page sequence="20">Marc Soriano the nature of man," it is also a fundamental part of our adaptation to the world. We who are, who have been made to be sad adults, and who have more or less consented to this sadness, must try to have laughing children. Perhaps they will have more of a critical spirit than we, and that is truly indispensable if they are going to make our world a better one. Translated by Julia Bloch Frey. 43</page></plain_text>
