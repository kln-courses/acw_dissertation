<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS OLD TESTAMENT SECTION The Old Testament Against Its Environment, by G. Ernest Wright (Studies in Biblical Theology, No. 2). Chicago: Henry Regnery Co., 1950. Pp. 115. $1.50. The author, competent in varied aspects of biblical studies, here continues his contribution in the field of biblical theology, begun so auspiciously in The Challenge of Israel's Faith (University of Chicago Press, 1944). In view of some differences of opinion in matters of literary criticism, the reviewer is constantly pleasantly surprised at the degree of his agreement with the author's interpretation of the theological sig- nificance of the OT. Professor Wright examines those central aspects of OT faith which are so unique that he believes they cannot have developed by any natural evolu- tionary process from the pagan world and cannot be fully explained by environmental terms. He has been strongly influenced by the studies of Frankfort and Jacobsen, and he is deeply indebted to Professor Albright for his general point of view. It is opposed to the liberal theological viewpoint more current in the decade of the 20's, but from this volume it would be difficult to determine whether he should be placed in the neo-liberal or neo-orthodox camp; he would probably object to either classification. This monograph contains three essays. The first, " 'What Great Nation Hath a God like the Lord,' " is concerned with the question of the evolutionary development of the religion of the Hebrews from primitive, child-like origins through successive stages to a culmination in maturity, a position the author rejects. He recognizes that the concept of growth has both its good and its bad applications; while concern for developmental aspects of the Bible has at points been misleading, it has resulted in the accumulation of a tremendous amount of facts "without which the progress of biblical history cannot be understood" (italics the reviewer's). Ideally, of course, one should not approach the Bible with a preconception of growth or a static revelation or any combination thereof, but should examine it to see what the data within it itself suggest. One will take into consideration the perspective achieved from the analysis of other contemporary cultures, such as Egypt and Mesopotamia, which, as the author recognizes, mitigates against any purely evolutionary theory. As he comments, the attempt to make the OT a source book for the evolution of religion has caused mis- interpretations, and sociological study cannot explain how Israel became a nation with such faith in its God that its very existence was conceived to be a miracle of grace. But of course, although not explaining it, sociological study may help us some in understanding it, and we could perhaps understand it better if more contemporary data of a sociological nature were available to us. And the author does state that the doctrine of the chosen people arose as "a natural explanation" of a historic fact, the marvelous deliverance of an oppressed minority in Egypt. He also speaks of the 321</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Israelite "mutation" or, as he prefers to call it, "epigenesis." The reviewer would note that one cannot "explain" what is new in human history even on the human level by cause and effect and environmental factors, for one has to reckon with the real creativity of the human mind, and the theologian adds to this the mystery of divine revelation. The author by no means plays down polytheism and paganism, and this makes all the more striking his presentation of the uniqueness of Israel's religion. He em- phasizes that, unlike polytheism, the Israelite knowledge of God was based not on the numinous awareness of nature, but on historical event, and it differed also because it presumed no duality expressed in terms of sex, for the Israelite Godhead was essen- tially sexless. Although anthropomorphic, it was imageless, and it possessed no mythology, even historicizing the myth of the struggle of the deity with the dragon. The first essay concludes with a discussion of monotheism, involving an interpretation of the Divine Assembly of the gods, as in Ps 82. Wright recognizes that here and in Deut 32 8-9 the actual existence of the other gods is assumed, although without inde- pendent existence, and they are responsible to the head of the council, Yahweh. While he is right in making it clear that the differences between paganism and Israelite religion cannot be comprehended by either of the rather artificial terms of modern scholarship, "henotheism" or "monotheism," and while the reviewer shares his ob- jections to the use of the term "henotheism," the reviewer prefers to use the term "monolatry," defining it so as to fit the confessedly unique Israelite situation, and he would accord with Wright's statement that "in Israel there existed an exclusive and true monolatry, which did not exist elsewhere." Although Wright prefers the term "monotheism," he does properly state that the discussion of monotheism is largely an academic affair, pressed because we feel the need of using Hellenic rather than Hebrew categories of thought. The second essay, entitled "'He Established a Testimony in Israel,' " is con- cerned with the election of Israel and the doctrine and role of Israel as the chosen people. It is one of the best brief treatments of this subject that the reviewer knows. In contrast with Irwin, Pfeiffer, and others, Wright accepts an early origin of the doctrine of Israel as the covenanted people. While not as certain about it as the author who says that "there no longer can be any doubt" that the election of Israel was given concrete expression in terms of a legal compact in the wilderness period, the reviewer thinks it probable, and would even admit the possibility that if, as Meek suggests, Joshua preceded Moses, an Israelite amphictyonic covenant may be earlier than Moses, and the Shechem covenant may precede the Sinai or Kadesh covenant. Atten- tion may be called to the fact that the expression "to cut a covenant" has been noted by Albright on cuneiform tablets from Qatna in Syria, not later than the 14th century (BASOR, 1951, 21 ff.). It was, of course, not merely the idea of the covenant that was significant for Israel, but the associations of that covenant with the concept of the election of Israel and with the distinctive Hebrew idea of God. The third essay, "'What Doth the Lord Thy God Require?' " treats the cultus and the influence of Israel's distinctive ideas on the forms of worship. The pagan emphasis on magic and divination is contrasted with the Israelite viewpoint, although 322</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS Wright, with his usual balanced perspective, notes how official Yahwism was not lacking in what we would consider magical practices or things verging thereon. The religious festivals are also discussed, and the author takes a middle position in the question of the New Year festival, finding Morgenstern far more convincing than Mowinckel, but concluding that the reconstruction of an elaborate New Year festival remains in the realm of theory. In his discussion of sacrifice he shows how polytheism had no sense of sin comparable to that found in Israelite cultic life, and he holds a middle position on the question of the prophetic attitude toward the cultic system, believing the truth lies between those who say the prophets would have abolished the sacrificial system and those who say they would not have done so. This monograph is an expanded edition of Part I of the Haskell Lectures, delivered at the Graduate School of Theology in 1949. When the reviewer heard the lectures, he was much impressed by them. In their present form he is even more convinced of the positive contribution they make in the field of biblical theology. This little volume will find wide use in classes in biblical theology and will be of interest to those who have a general concern for biblical studies. The numerous bibliographical data and comments in the footnotes add to the importance of this study, an importance far out of proportion to its size. HERBERT G. MAY The New Testament Against Its Environment: The Gospel of the Risen Lord, by Floyd V. Filson. Chicago: Henry Regnery Co., 1950. Pp. 104. $1.50. These lectures, along with three given by Professor G. Ernest Wright, composed the Haskell Lectures at Oberlin College in 1949 on the theme, "The Bible Against Its Environment." Professor Filson deals with three general subjects: "The God and Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ," "The Fulness of Time," and "Led by the Spirit." Certain general features of the early Christian environment must be observed: In the minds of the writers of the NT, theism and Christology are intertwined; the Resur- rection expectation created a point of contact between Judaism and the NT which cannot be widely explained by use of the OT; the deepest ties of the NT are found in Judaism, rather than among the Gentiles. Jesus and the Apostles did not wish to abolish Judaism; rather they desired to bring their ancestral faith, through God's help, to its climactic form. Jesus during his earthly ministry was aware of his Messianic mission; the Ressurrection deepened rather than created the view that Jesus was the Messiah. Though the Christian message is in its genesis predominantly Jewish, "the Christian movement never lived an hour in a region which was purely Jewish." As this Jewish movement makes way into its specifically Gentile environment after the Death and Resurrection of Jesus, certain things are to be observed: (1) Christian monotheism rejected the polytheism of the Gentile world. (2) Some types of NT scholarship have over-emphasized the Hellenistic character of the later NT writings; there is no thoroughly Hellenistic writing in the NT corpus, not even the Fourth Gospel. (3) The NT's close relation of God's transcendence and his gracious 323</page></plain_text>
