EBOUSSI BOULAGA Universite de Yaounde GENEVIEVE CALAME-GRIAULE, Ethnologie et langage: la parole chez les Dogon (2nd edn). Paris: Institut d'ethnologie, 1987, 591 pp., FF 204, ISBN 285265 011 8. This fascinating, encyclopedic study of Dogon language was first published in 1965. Dedicated to the author's father Marcel Griaule, the pioneering French ethnographer, it is an extraordinary work, a model of sociological research on language that also provides a much-needed context for earlier studies of Dogon cosmology. The first two of the book's three parts, on the theory and mythology of speech, deal with ideas about language. It is clear that the Dogon have given the phenomenon of speech a great deal of highly self-conscious, sophisticated thought. One wonders what kind of ideas similarly detailed research would elicit among any other people. Calame-Griaule has elicited the data and the richness of her questioning is obvious. The elaborate ideology which emerges in response does not seem to be an artefact of the interviewer's concern. Dogon ideas do seem unusually systematic, reminiscent of the ideas associated with divination elsewhere. Perhaps important evidence of the autonomy of these ideas is that they are consistent not only with Dogon practice but also with common practice in neighbouring regions. Whether similarly elaborate ideas about language can be elicited in neighbouring regions remains to be seen. However, the indications are, from other excellently documented neighbouring societies (the Tallensi for example) that cultures vary greatly in the extent to which such notions are elaborated. In the Dogon view recorded here, like that of Edward Sapir, the faculties of speech, and thought are distinguishable but inextricably linked. The Dogon roots which go to make up the word translatable as 'thought' can be glossed as 'the-word-in-the-liver'. This image also indicates the manner in which Dogon ideas about language are tied to a conception of the human body. Calame-Griaule writes, 'We constantly find an anthropomorphic vision of the world, conceived as a gigantic human organism and in all its parts one finds reproductions on a large or small scale, of the same image.' In Dogon thought, speech circulates as a liquid in the human body, and is heated in the liver to emerge and vaporise as the spoken word. It may be cooled as it passes through the pancreas and remain unspoken or it can be heated again and then spoken. The body of speech is made up of sound which contains the same four elements as the human body: water (saliva), air (respiration), earth (the sense of words as distinct from noise), and fire (heat conceived as the emotional content of words), a quality which ranges from cool or calm, to hot or angry. In different utterances, these elements are found in different proportions. Words spoken in a sequence contain articulations analogous to elbow or knee joints, which have more or less wisdom (oil). Speech is either male (low and falling in tone) or female (high and rising). Speech is also imbued with vital essence, and has more or less fecundity. There is living and dead speech, and the dead have their own language. Words of the dead are associated with dryness and cold, feared as destroyers of 158</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS crops. The dead may drink water from the blood of the living and libations are poured to the dead in order to assuage their thirst. The custom of pouring libations to the dead is almost universal in this region but I have never heard it rationalised in this form. The physiology of speech is precisely described. The brain in the head chooses words from a reservoir of speech located in the collarbone. There the words are kept as seeds in water to be nourished by the food a person eats. Water boils in the liver sending the vital essence of speech, by way of the blood, to the liver, the heart, lungs, pancreas, spleen, larynx and mouth. The spleen is the place where suppressed speech may be kept, causing rancour and anger. Hearing speech is a complementary process. Words are caught by the eardrum (called literally, 'teeth of the ear'), and enter the body from left to right, or right to left, depending on whether the words are good or bad. Inside the body words condense to become liquid in the larynx and are carried in the blood to different organs producing different effects depending on the nature of the speech. Good speech refreshes the heart with water, and nourishes the liver with oil. Bad speech dries out the heart and makes the liver contract, causing speech to be spilled from the spleen. Part of this work records a Dogon classification of speech into 48 modes divided by origin into two numbered series of 24. Each mode has gender, is associated with different sets of creative divinities and transcendental powers, each has a number and name, a descriptive moral characterisation, an association with some technological procedure, an animal, a vegetable, a body-part, and a symbolic moral quality. These qualities are not mutually exclusive but cumulatively they produce a distinct profile for each mode of speech. There are graphic representations, well illustrated in the text, for each mode of speech. In the graphic representations there are four clearly distinguished stages appropriate for different places and purposes. It was in this section that I wondered how much of the system depended on the anthropologist's organisation of the data. It is possible that these characterisations and notions of the origin and associations of speech might be less rigid than the tables and analyses make them appear. Since there is no documentation, in this section, of the contexts in which Dogon use this classification of language it is difficult to judge how much of the system is part of the way the data is presented. In the third section, on the use and learning of language, the degree of abstraction with which the data is presented is more evident and perhaps more problematic. No individual cases or illustrative material from specific social situations are presented. This kind of field data, anecdotal though it might be, could illustrate ambiguities hidden by the generalised descriptive ethnography. This lack in depth of ethnog- raphic data is compensated for by the amazing range of material presented, and this section like the earlier two, should stimulate further research.
