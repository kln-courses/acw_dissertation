As responsible professionals it is said that they have no business messing around with theory. For their own part, Gwathmey Siegel have consistently signaled their concern with local meaning rather than its generalizable struc- ture. This should be our starting point as well. As theorist Viktor Shklovsky has written, "If you want to understand a machine, you have to look at it from the point of view of a mechanic, not ¡from the point of view of a vegetarian." To look at this work from 'the point of view of the professional theorist in order to demon- strate its lack of theoretical grounding would be an absurd exer- cise. In any event, theory is not a measurable quality. It might be more productive to say that in the case of Gwathmey Siegel theo- ry is at work in significant and obvious ways, not the least of (which is the avoidance of an explicit theoretical discourse. We have to understand exactly how the resistance to theory is itself theo- rized and how the architecture in turn is affected. Would the ' work look any different if it were accompanied by theoret- ical reflection? In this context it is important to recall that the joint publication of the work of Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk, and Richard Meier in 1972, under the title Five Archi- tects, announced itself primarily as an event of theoretical sig- nificance. Arthur Drexler observed in the preface that Five Architects "attempts to establish the ideological context in which [the work] takes place." Beyond all the other claims advanced for the "Five"- and despite disclaimers from the individual architect - the book contained a not-so-well-concealed subtext: that a coherent formal language was necessarily undergirded by a set of related theoretical precepts. This theoretical stance marked a significant break with the prevailing professionalism of the time. The subtext was encoded in the layout and presentation as well as in the work itself. A theoretically engaged practice looked like this: large white pages with generous margins, spare line draw- ings, and black and white photos. Drawing from two overlapping theoretical paradigms- Colin Rowe's formalism and the incipient project of a "semiotics of architecture "-this publication defined a platform that challenged the program of entrenched modernism and postwar professional practice still unfolding in the 1970s. Theoretical discourse in the 1970s emerged from the perceived crisis of meaning engendered by functionalism; Gwathmey Siegel simply chose not to acknowledge this crisis. For theory to consolidate itself in that professional climate, it was necessary to stipulate a distance from practice. This was never an important part of the Gwathmey Siegel agenda. Not only was Gwathmey Siegels practice based on conceptual and formal con- tinuity with the modern movement, they also wanted to fold themselves smoothly into the economic/cultural machinery of American building practice. As a result, they necessarily sup- pressed the theoretical. The moment of doubt- interrupting and interrogating the conditions of their own discipline - was smoothed over and potential crisis held comfortably at bay. Gwathmey Siegel (then Gwathmey and Henderson) thus dis- tanced their work from the theoretical force field surrounding the publication of the work of the Five Architects. In early lectures, for example, Gwathmey sought to insert his work into indige- nous American traditions of pragmatic functionalism and Shingle Style formalism, noting especially the use of natural wood cladding in the early Long Island houses. On the other hand, it would be inaccurate to associate Gwathmey Siegel with the more radical currents of philosophical pragmatism. Gwathmey Siegel are completely bound to current institutional and professional paradigms, including the associ- ated ideological agendas. Their innovations are formal, marking only incremental changes within known languages and formal paradigms. As defined by Richard Rorty, "Pragmatists are supposed to treat everything as a matter of choice of context and nothing as a matter of intrinsic properties. They dissolve objects into functions, essences into momentary foci of attention, and knowing into success at reweaving a web of beliefs and desires into more supple and elegant folds. "3Nothing could be further from Gwathmey Siegels practice. They privilege objects over functions, essences and intrinsic properties over shifting con- texts. Gwathmey Siegels (professional) pragmatism does not result in a philosophically pragmatic critique of existing institu- tions. Such a critique would demonstrate how professional con- ventions and theoretical paradigms share certain assumptions - assumptions that in both cases limit operational flexibility, arbi- trarily exclude certain options, and enforce outmoded ways of working. Gwathmey Siegel maintain the professional proprieties of design. Though they recognize the usefulness of the "concept" as a strategic, academically sanc- tioned tool, they are committed to the concept as an instrument and not to theory as a prob- lematizing, disruptive discourse.</page><page sequence="2">THEORY (D &lt; co U.35 Gwathmey Siegel and Associates, Whig Hall, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, 1970.

A close reading of Gwathmey SiegelsWhig Hall renovation (1970) will be set within the framework of the dominant critical paradigms of the 1970s, notably Colin Rowe's formalism, as modified and translated by the various reflections on architecture as a linguistic system. But I do not want to suggest a linear movement from the- ory to project or to imply that the architects consciously set out to demonstrate in their buildings the workings of Rowe s theory. My thesis is that while Gwathmey Siegel make productive use of this theory and while they pursued (from very early on) linguis- tic abstraction to unexpected limits, because the work lacks the moment of doubt alluded to earlier, it fails to develop significant- ly from the promise of its starting points. This is not because the work lacks "theory" but just the opposite. If anything, the work is overdetermined by its initial theoretical support. Hence, lacking a more supple theoretical framework, one that allows for possi- bility of doubt, Gwathmey Siegel are unable to question the pre- cepts that make their practice possible. The concrete labor of the work - enmeshed in all the com- plexity and unpredictability of reality - is never allowed to disrupt the orderly architecture of its theoretical support. This is emphatically not to privi- lege pure theory over pure practice but rather to look for those productive moments when the know-how of experiment and practice, the "arts of theory," exceeds the boundaries of theoreti- cal knowledge. Significantly, Gwathmey Siegel describe the reconstruction of Whig Hall as a "correction" to the original structure. The archi- tects were given the opportunity to rebuild one of the paired neoclassical temples built by A. Page Brown in 1893 to house Princeton s Whig and Clio debating societies. A fire had gutted Whig Hall, necessitating a rebuilding of the interior leaving the exterior shell and temple front intact. The university sought to expand and reorder the building s program; the architects sought to extend and rectify the building s original architectural princi- ples. The dialogue is conducted internally, and the propriety of the campus green, marked by the twin temples, is maintained. The oppositional logic of the symmetry is balanced, as in a gen- tlemanly debate: controlled disagreement along preestab- lished lines of argument. Only on the east front (facing, significantly, the School of Architecture and away from Whig s twin) is the section visible: a framed void cut into the building, revealing the purist assemblage within. Gwathmey Siegel justify the correction on the basis of two conceptual operations: first, they point out that in the existing Whig and Clio Halls, classical temple fronts were grafted onto structures only nominally and super- ficially classical. (This contrasts with the Maison Carrée in Nîmes, which the firm introduces as a "proper" temple form.) The untidy, eclectic bearing wall construction of the building volume is at odds with the tectonic clarity of the temple front itself. Gwathmey Siegels response is to supply the (missing) order of a rational Domino structural system, inserted into the existing shell. They reinterpret bearing wall as frame, and the exposed volumes of the stair and lounge establish a "giant order" in frag- mented form. The tectonic logic of the ancient prototype is restated in modern materials. The architects seize on an internal inconsistency (which needless to say did not concern the origi- nal architect) to mount a critique of the expedient logic of the eclectic prototype. They stress the continuity of the reconstruc- tion with the principles (but not the actual reality) of the original structure. History vaults over the interval between the classi- cal prototype and the modern reinterpretation. Gwathmey Siegel weave the complex elements of the program into a new (internal) spatial order, utilizing a characteristic Corbusian free plan strategy to create a counterpoint of curvilinear volumes and regular structural grid. The main volumetric assemblage knits itself into the existing shell by everywhere respecting the frame. In the old building, stairs and service spaces occupied the leftover space. Gwathmey Siegel strategically invert this hierarchy, giving the stairs and service spaces distinct volumetric expression as figures at the periphery, while the primary public spaces occupy a void slightly off-center. The regularity of the grid is compro- mised only once, by the absence of the expected column in the southeast corner of the terrace near the window. This omission allows a clear expression of the volumes within and of the giant order. Its absence clarifies the preferred figurai readings: a frag- ment of the superstructure of an ocean liner, a bare neoclassical column, or an errant fragment of late-Corbusian industrial vocabulary. The existing temple front assigns a monumental scale to the new assemblage. Scale devices that would otherwise con- tradict this reading- stairs, railings, windows, and columns- are suppressed. These details support Gwathmey Siegels own description of the building as "dialogue and counterpoint" in place of a discordant juxtaposi- tion of old and new The abstraction of the new addition underscores a reading of both that under-</page><page sequence="4">a 37</page><page sequence="5">11.38</page><page sequence="6">lines similarities rather than calling attention to differences. The existing building supplies in turn what seems to be missing in other works by Gwathmey Siegel: a figurai presence of fine- grained, internally diversified scales. The most evident conceptual precedent for all of this is Colin Rowe's 1947 essay "The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa," original- ly published in the Architectural Review and later republished in Mathematics of the Ideal Villa and Other Essays.4 Rowe's analysis juxtapos- es artifacts from early-20th-century modernism with 1 6th-cen- tury mannerist examples, suggesting, through formal analysis, a common thread ofWestern humanist thought. Rowe develops his argument along two parallel paths. First, a formal comparison uncovers a common geometrical basis for villas Malcontenta and Garches, designed four centuries apart. Rowe's debt to Rudolf Wittkower's typological analysis, which deduced a common planimetrie scaffold for Palladio 's villas, is well documented. But Rowe's brilliant and sustained formal analysis is framed by a more complex comparison, one constructed not from geo- metrical analysis but from a literary analogy: Villa Capra- Rotonda and Villa Savoye both appeal to the Virgilian dream of an ideal platonic archetype built in the pastoral landscape. Both villas, Rowe asserts, stage the conflict of the absolute and the contingent. The resolution constitutes the "well- executed fugue" of the humanist architect/poet. But the gap between "the ideal world and the too human exigencies of real- ization" can only be bridged via a sustainable belief in a sympa- thy of the natural and the artificial; hence the appeals to the "objective" principles of musical, mathematical, and cosmologi- cal harmonies. In looking to nature to justify a world of ideal forms, it was nec- essary to postulate a scaffold of abstract geometric form beneath the complex and irregular surface of natural form; in short, to make the contingency of nature s appearance transparent to the absolute of nature's order. This reasoning allows Rowe to con- struct his own well-executed fugue from mannerism to mod- ernism. Rowe begins his article with a citation from Christopher Wren: "Natural beauty is from Geometry, consisting in uniformi- ty, that is equality and proportion. Customary beauty is begotten from use, as familiarity breeds a love for things not in themselves lovely. Here lies a great occasion of errors." Rowe is of course too sophisticated to repeat Wren's dogmatic taxonomy; he under- stands Palladio's use of Roman forms as contingent, not absolute, and he describes exactly what is at stake here: "These are charged with meaning, both for what they are and what they signify; and their impression is poignant. By such apparatus the ancient house is not recreated, but something far more significant is achieved: a creative nostalgia evokes a manifestation of mythical power in which the Roman and the ideal are equated." Thus for Rowe, the ideal is a still credible construction: not an ab- solute entity but a complex of ideas that can be denoted through the combination and recombination of conventionalized and categorized associative mechanisms. Rowe suggests that as a construct with a particular denotative power, the appeal to the absolute is legitimate, even while he recognizes the pervasiveness of contingency that renders it impossible as authentic presence. Significantly, the moment of classical architecture that Rowe hypothesizes is not the certainties and perfections of the high Renaissance but mannerism, a moment of self-conscious manipulation of already formed linguistic material. In this choice he underlines the already mediated condition of the classical as origin. For Le Corbusier, Rowe outlines a task more difficult but fundamentally the same. If the certainty of a link between a given figurai vocabulary and a constellation of idealized philosophical concepts has withered, the ambition of con- structing that bridge, now out of semantic material, which is at best "dissipated and inferential," has not. Rowe writes: Instead, as sponsors of his virtuosity, Le Corbusier largely selects a variety of hitherto undiscriminated phenomena. He selects the casual incidents of Paris, or Istanbul, or whatever it may be.... Unlike Palladio's forms, there is nothing final about any of their possible relationships; and their rapprochement would seem to be affected by the artificial emptying of the cube in which they find themselves located, when the senses are confounded by what is apparently arbitrary and the intellect is more than convinced by the intuitive knowledge that, despite all to the contrary, here problems have been both recognized and answered and that there is reasonable order. Out of the disorganized and dislocated world of early moder- nity, Le Corbusier is then able to salvage, at least provisional- ly, a kind of "reasonable order," recognizable in its parts and comprehensible in its whole. The idea of a common geometrical basis for both classical and modern architecture (as the scaffold upon which the resolution of the absolute and contingent might be staged) was institution- alized by the early 1 970s. It became fundamental to the project of reconstructing Whig Hall, allowing Gwathmey Siegel to reduce the architecture of the existing temple to an abstract geometric 11.39</page><page sequence="7">U.40 schema and to imagine a common language of points, planes, and solids as the basis of the dia- logue between two dissimilar systems. It enabled the architects, as it did Rowe, to project historical continuity, inscribing the violent shifts of modernity into a continuum of unfolding humanist thought. But equally important to sanction the work at Whig Hall is the appeal to the pastoral. Brown s twin temples mark a departure from the prevailing collegiate Gothic of the Princeton campus. They maintain a more assertive spatial presence than the deferential Gothic buildings, and their symme- try and figurai language are more explicitly anthropomorphic than that of the other campus architecture. The latent Virgilian nostalgia that they embody mirrors the idealized life of scholar- ship and athletics enshrined at the Princeton campus. Thus the notion that a cut into the body of the temple should reveal the sensuous forms of a lyrically efficient machine for the production of the pastoral is not surprising. The surrealistic effect of juxtaposition- the violence of the cut- persists only in the details, the elaborations, eruptions, and fold- ings of the surfaces: the moldings of the frame, the light wells and stairs on the roof, and the pipe rail on the ter- race. This terrace itself is the result of a lingering ambiva- lence in the design. It is caught between two orders - out- side of the spatial weave of the new interior, yet left unpro- tected on account of the scale of the opening at the east wall. It leaves the visitor feeling unex- pectedly vulnerable. Perhaps most disconcerting is the presence on this terrace of an existing window, an empty frame, which on account of its scale, its familiar form and place- ment, should frame a view from the interior and protect the sub- ject from the world outside. But this window frame is now poised in uncanny suspension between the exterior and the ambivalent space of the terrace. The effect is further enforced by the stucco revetment in the interior of the existing shell - the only place where the interior of the old building is revealed. The clinical white of the stucco here encodes the surgical cut necessary to section this body. Whig Hall is of necessity a hybrid and therefore contravenes certain normative modernist compositional rules. The Corbusian notion of the facade as a screen on which to register the literal and phenomenal transparencies of the building is absent here, as it is in almost all of Gwathmey Siegels work. The Whig Hall addi- tion is a blank box, distrustful of the slippery effects of the sur- face and deferential toward the figure of the old build- ing. The effect on the cutaway east wall is that of a suddenly exposed section that reveals certain unresolved compositional dynamics. The sym- metry supposedly demanded by the bearing wall</page><page sequence="8">11.41 structure has been partially disturbed by the removal of the east wall (though reinstated by the firmness of the base). Two effects follow One is rotational, displacing the frontality of the temple front by the suddenly introduced void. The other is an imbalance created by the disposition of the service spaces in a dense layer compressed between the internal void, the public space, and the external void of the terrace. The compaction of this displaced center facade results in a barely contained verti- cal extension. One further detail: the existing shell is held together by a new concrete roof incorporating an integral tension ring. Here the two systems come together, and new technology literally supports the old. This is evident in the span of the lintel framing the open east wall. Gwathmey Siegel have translated the visual logic of the pilasters into a tectonic logic that frames the open section of the new assemblage. Although tectonically correct according to the logic of the post and lintel system, such a span would have been impossible in the original stone. As did Claude Perrault in the east front of the Louvre, Gwathmey Siegel have achieved the span demanded by the visual logic of their giant order through con- cealed reinforcing. Hidden behind the restored marble cornice is a prestressed concrete beam that makes possible the effect of an integral volume opened by an abrupt cut. The complexity of the technical operations signals that rational tectonics have become subservient to semantic effect. The logic of this is clear: Gwathmey Siegel make tectonic what was previously an atectonic appliqué. The giant order of the temple front defines scale and "supports" the new assemblage conceptually, while the new technology literally provides support. The scale reading is reinforced by the frame, which allows the erasure of the windows that previously encoded the internal scale differences; note the treatment, in the new addition, of the open- ings as voids in a spatial order without internal scale. The archi- tects convey their preferred compositional reference by extending the logic of the existing neoclassical structure. In turn, the rein- forced integrity of this lintel frames and scrupulously maintains the limits of the composition, as if it were a purist painting in a classical frame. There is no memory of the fire, no poetics of ruin. Nothing escapes the control of the frame, and by extension, the impeccable control of the designers. 1 Michel de Certeau, "The Arts ofTheory" in The Practice of Everyday Life, trans.
