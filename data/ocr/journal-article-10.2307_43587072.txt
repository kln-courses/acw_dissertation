In the first part, published as volume 12 of Qedem in 1980, we presented and discussed the architectural remains and cult objects. This volume is dedicated to the other finds: metal objects, alabaster and stone vessels, beads, and, mainly, the unusually rich and well-stratified collection of pottery from the several phases of the sanctuary and its vicinity. This pottery repertoire is the best stratified, and perhaps one of the richest of the Iron Age I from Israel, and is therefore published in considerable detail. The numerous, repetitious forms in the various strata have called for a concentrated typological discussion, based on a "type-series" system; the Figures illustrating the pot- tery are arranged according to homogeneous groups from each of the strata. Thus the reader can readily obtain a graphic picture of the bulk of the pottery found in each stratum or group of homogeneous loci, while the text provides a synthetic approach, sum- marizing the development of each type or sub-type during the various phases at Tell Qasile, as well as its distribution on other sites in the country. Archaeo- logical publications in Israel seldom take a quantita- tive approach to pottery analysis. At Tell Qasile I sought a new method of pottery registration, assisted by computer which could handle part of the quantita- tive analysis, that based on complete vessels and all rim sherds from clear contexts, according to the "type-series" established for our particular excava- tion. The results of this analysis provide a detailed catalogue of the contents of the loci, which we present here in an abridged form. Several statistical tables demonstrate the development of important features in the pottery development based on the above method of registration. This is a new step in pottery analysis in stratified excavations in Israel, and hope- fully it is to be further developed in the future. In the concluding chapters, the background for the establishment of the port town at Tell Qasile is dis- cussed, along with the inner development of the material culture there during the Iron Age, emphasiz- ing the general implications for that period. Since this volume is a direct continuation of Qedem 12, we have decided to continue the sequence of chapter numbering; pagination, however, is independent. Chapter XXI and the appendixes provide the results obtained by several scientists who cooperated with us and analyzed various samples from our exca- vations: pottery, building materials, ash deposits, animal bones, plant remains and textile impressions. May I thank all the contributors for their efforts. I would like again to thank all the staff members of the Tell Qasile excavations (a full list of the staff is given on p. 5 of Qedem 12). Particular thanks are extended to all those who helped in the preparation of this second volume: Mrs. Berachah Goz-Zilberstein (pottery registration and preparation of the Figures); Z. Radovan (photographs); I. Sharon (computer pro- gramming) M. Bar-On (administration) and the staff of Hamakor Press. The text is largely based on my Ph.D. thesis, submitted to the Hebrew University in 1977 under the guidance of Professor Trude Dothan and the Late Professor Yigael Yadin. Revision of the text was carried out during 1983-84 at the Institute of Advanced Studies of the Hebrew University, Jerusa- lem. Mr. R. Grafman has kindly edited the English text and Hana Davis read the proofs.

A. METAL OBJECTS 1. BRONZE Axe-adze (Fig. 1:1, Photo 1) Reg. No. 1430; Locus 133; Level 22.38m; Stratum X. This object was found on the step leading to the raised platform of Temple 1 3 1 of Stratum X; it is well preserved, 12.4 cm long and almost uneffected by corrosion. The circular shaft hole, 2.5 cm in diameter, has protruding margins, giving it a total length of 4.3 cm. One side of this margin is decorated with rope- pattern incisions. The tool has two blades, perpendic- ular to one another. The one is parallel to the handle shaft and could be used as an axe; its blade is rounded, and widens to 4.3 cm at the end. The other is perpendicular to the handle and could be used as an adze; its blade is rounded and is 3.8 cm wide at the end. Metallurgical analysis reveals: Copper 88%; Tin 10%; Lead 1%; Silver 1%. 1 The quantity of tin is indicative of the good quality of the bronze. The only parallels to this tool found in Israel are from Megiddo Stratum Via, contemporaneous with Tell Qasile X.2 Two similar tools were found at the public building (palace?) near the entrance to the city of that stratum. The two tools differ from ours only in the lack of protruding margins at the shaft. Outside Israel, the type is well know» in a wide geographical and chronological range. Our tool fits Type B of J. Deshayes's classification.3 This type appears in the Aegean during the 3rd millennium B.C. and continued to appear in Greece and Crete 1 . The analysis was made by the Nahal Sorek Nuclear Research Laboratories through the Israel Museum Laboratories, by spectroscopy. 2. Megiddo II, PI. 183: 19-20. 3. J.

Hutchinson, Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 16 during the 2nd millennium B.C. The closest parallels to our tool are from Crete and Cyprus. Those from Crete recall closely the end of our tool even more than the examples from Megiddo,4 yet they differ in the oval shape of the shaft. The 6 or 7 examples from Cyprus,5 and a similar tool from the Cape Gelidonya shipwreck,6 recall our tool in their circular shaft; however, they differ in their general shape in profile, for the two opposing blades do not form a continuous line, as in our tool. Various scholars have suggested relating the appearance of the axe-adze to the diffusion of Indo- Europeans over the ancient world.7 This view is based on the emergence of the type in the late 4th millen- nium B.C. in the Indus Valley and Iran, and during the 3rd-2nd millennia along the Danube, in southern Russia and in the Aegean sphere.8 There is no doubt that the appearance of the axe-adze in Israel is related to the settlement of the "Sea Peoples" here. This conclusion agrees with Catling's conclusions as to the relation between the appearance of this type in Photo 1. Ax-adze. (1950), pp. 52-63. 5.

This is based on the fact that most of the tools in Cyprus were found in clear Late Cypriot III contexts, along with Mycenean UIC pottery.9 Though the examples from Israel were found in slightly later contexts (second half of 11th century B.C.) these contexts are still clearly related to "Sea People" cultural traditions, as reflected at Tell Qasile X and Megiddo VIA. The axe-adze is often interpreted as a carpenter's tool,10 though Schaeffer thought that it was a mining tool. Our example was found as an offering in the holy-of-holies of the temple, a fact emphasizing its importance to the local inhabitants. A Spearhead (Fig. 1:2, Photo 2) Reg. No. 2697; Locus 227; Level 21.48m; Stratum XI. Length: 12 cm, maximal width: 2 cm. This object is much worn by corrosion. The tubu- lar shaft is broken at the lower part; the blade, a direct continuation of the shaft, is 7 cm long, and has no central ridge. The object was made from bronze sheet 9.

The type is known, however, in Cyprus. Two such objects were included in Catling's discussion of Cypriot bronze work; both are from obscure contexts. According to Catling, they mark the beginning of production of shafted spearheads in Cyprus and, he dated them to the late 2nd millennium Photo 2. Spearhead.</page><page sequence="12">B.C. 11 A similar spearhead was found at Memphis, in a 19th dynasty context.12 An Arrow Head (Fig. 1:3) Reg. No. 3857; Locus 203; Level 21.37 m; Stratum XI. Length: 7 cm. The tang is 2 cm long and is of square section; the oblanceolate blade is 1.3 cm wide at the centre, has a flat mid-rib 0.6 cm wide. There is no stem between the blade and the tang. The head was found on the floor of Temple 200 of Stratum XI. Two similar arrow- heads were found among the 26 arrow and spear- heads from the el-Hadr hoard (south of Bethlehem), and were defined as Type Al in the typological study of Cross and Milik. 13 Most of the parallels given there are of the Late Bronze Age, yet the same hoard included spearheads of similar shape (Type J 1), parallelled at Megiddo Stratum VI.14 One of these spearheads, and similar spearheads from Ruweisah in Lebanon,15 bear a script palaeographically of the 1 1th century B.C. A similar arrowhead was found at Enkomi, in a Late Cypriote III context.16 This arrowhead type is unique at Tell Qasile. Three other arrowheads, found in Area A, are elliptical in section, and have no mid-rib. A Bronze Hook (Fig. 1:4) Reg. No. 3562; Locus 300; Level 20.76m; Strata XI-X (Shrine 300). This object was found on the western bench of Shrine 300. The hook is made from a 0.6 cm thick bronze rod, much corroded. A Bronze Earring Reg. No. 2732; Locus 174 A 'drop'-shaped earring, 1.5 cm long and 0.8 cm thick. Of the bronze objects found in other areas at Tell Qasile (to be published in the future), we may men- tion a lugged axehead; a tanged spearhead; three arrowheads (mentioned above); two bronze knives (?); a fibula (fragmentary); two needles; a nail; and a shafted object, probably a spear butt. We may also mention a bronze or copper workshop discovered in Building Q, Area A (Stratum XI), which included smelting furnaces and two V-shaped crucibles.17 It is most probable that the copper smelted at this local workshop came from Cyprus, where the copper industry flourished until the mid-1 1th century B.C. In discussing the bronze industry of the Iron Age I, Negbi has emphasized the continuity of Canaanite tradition throughout this period, especially at such sites as Megiddo (Stratum VI), Beth-Shan (Tomb 90) and Tell es-Sayidieh (Tomb 101). 18 Though this is well illustrated by Negbi, we may stress that, besides this group with Canaanite connections there are also bronze objects of the Iron Age I which show connec- tions with Aegean and Cypriot traditions. In fact, the two main bronze objects from our Area C clearly show such connections, as do other bronze objects: (a) Three double axes from Megiddo VI and one from Achzib (in an 11th century B.C. cist tomb), paral- lelled in numerous examples on Cyprus, in the Aegean and in the Cape Gelidonya shipwreck.19 (b) Spearheads with a rounded shaft and prominent, rounded mid-rib. Three of these are known from Megiddo VI, one from the cist tombs at Achzib, two from the cist tombs at Tel Zeror and one from Tell Jerisheh.20 All were found in 11th century B.C. con- texts, and a parallel is known from the tomb at Nebe- sheh (Egypt), of the same period.21 Exact parallels are known from the Late Cypriot III and early Cypro- Geometric periods in Cyprus, while the shape retains Late Cypriot II traditions.22 (c) A spear butt from 11.

Iron objects. Tel Zeror, Tomb VIII (probably part of a spear with one of the afore-mentioned spearheads). This is of a type common in Cyprus during the 12-1 1th centuries B.C.23 (d) A bronze sword found in Schumacher's excavations at Megiddo.24 This is of a type well known in Cyprus;25 the type itself is a branch of a larger group of swords, distributed throughout the Aegean, Cyprus, Egypt and the Levant during the 12th century B.C.26 Catling attributed this diffusion to mercenaries of European origin, yet the phenom- enon may be attributed to metalsmiths of European origin who settled in the Eastern Mediterranean dur- ing the 12th century B.C.; in any case the Megiddo sword was probably imported from Cyprus, (e) The bronze cauldron from Tell es-Sayidieh.27 This has close parallels in Cyprus and probably originated there. The bronze tripod from Beth-Shan is probably also a Cypriot product of the 12th century B.C., as claimed by Catling,28 while another tripod, from Tell es-Sayidieh, combines Cypriot and Canaanite tradi- tions.29 (f) "Omega"-shaped belt buckles from Megiddo VI and Tell Eitun (in a tomb of the late 1 1th century B.C.), parallelled in Europe and the Aegean world.30 This list, which includes two of the objects from Tell Qasile, encompasses both weapons and tools, and elaborate objects found in sites along the coastal and interior plains of Israel. The objects illustrate strong connections with Cyprus during the 1 2th- 1 1th centuries B.C. Some of them, like our axe-adze, show variations from the Cypriot originals, and thus were probably locally made by migrant or itinerant metalsmiths (perhaps like those associated with the Cape Gelidonya ship).31 Immigration of groups of metalsmiths from Cyprus to the plains of Israel may well be explained as part of the penetration of "Sea Peoples" into these regions (see below, p. 120). These newly arrived metalsmiths brought with them Aegean and Cypriot traditions, thus enriching the local Canaanite tradition, which continued to exist throughout the period. At Tell Qasile, objects which display Cypriot traditions have been found in the sanctuary area, while the bronze objects from Area A are all in the local Canaanite tradition. Though the total number of objects from our site is too small to enable clear conclusions, these data should be kept in mind concerning the diversity in the distribution of other finds between these two areas. 2. IRON An Iron Knife with Ivory Handle (Fig. 2:1, Photo 3) Reg. No. 3188; Locus 275; Level 21.47m; Stratum XII. Only the handle of the knife is preserved, with traces of the iron blade held by three bronze rivets. The handle, oval in section, is 13 cm long; its maximal width is 2 cm and it is 1.6 cm thick.

The outer edge of the ring is concave in profile. The tang of the iron blade was fastened into a slot in the ivory handle. The iron remnants are too corroded for analysis.32 The handle was found close to Wall 560 (the northern wall of Room 261, founded in Stratum XI) at the level of the bottom of the wall, in an accumulation of soft grey earth characteristic of the courtyard of Stratum XII. No clear Stratum XI floor was found there. Thus we can fairly safely attribute this handle to Stratum XII. There are 4 or 5 parallels for similar knife handles in Israel: (1) A knife from Tell el-Far'ah (S), Tomb 220 (end of 11th century beginning of 10th century B.C.).33 The handle is defined as made of 'ivory or bone'; the upper ring is almost totally broken. A knife from Tomb 227 (10th century B.C.) may also belong to this type.34 (2) Beth-Shan Stratum V (upper).35 The upper part of the handle was preserved. (3) Gezer, "Fourth Semitic Period".36 (4) A knife from Schumacher's excavations at Megiddo.37 The handle is of bone and ends in rosette- decorated ring. The exact date of (3) and (4) cannot be determined. A similar knife was discovered at Enkomi, on the floor of a 12th century B.C. workshop,38 while another knife of this type is known at Ialissos (Rhodes) in a Mycenean IIIQ context.39 Schaeffer dis- cussed the Enkomi knife, relating it to widely distrib- uted groups of knives known from the various European "Urn Fields" of the late 2nd millennium B.C. Most of these are of bronze, though some are of iron; they differ from the Enkomi knife, and from ours, in that the blade and handle are of one piece.40 The distribution and date of these knives recall those of the swords mentioned above (p. 6). There are few other metal objects found in Israel which may be Photo 3.

Müller-Karpe, however, who saw a photograph 7</page><page sequence="15">handle points to relations with Cyprus and the Aegean, and probably to some European tradition. The phenomenon of 'bimetallism', the combina- tion of iron and bronze in a single tool or weapon, was extensively surveyed by J. Waldbaum, who has shown the continuity of this technical tradition throughout the Iron Age and later periods in the Levant, Cyprus and the Aegean world.43 The particu- lar arrangement of iron knife-blade with bronze rivets, as on our handle, is known in the Iron Age I in several examples. In Israel, such knife-blades have been found at Tell Qasile, Tel Zeror Tomb VI, Gezer Tomb 58, Tell el-Far'ah Tomb 562 and Tel Yin'am.44 All these examples are dated to the 12th- 11th centu- ries B.C.; a definite 12th century B.C. date can be given only to our handle and to the example from Tell el-Far'ah Tomb 562. One contemporaneous knife was found at Hama, in the Cremation Cemetery Period I.45 Several examples are known from 12th- 11th century B.C. contexts in Cyprus, Crete and the Aegean islands and the Greek mainland.46 Other iron knife-blades from Israel are preserved only below the tang, and thus the material of their rivets is unknown.47 Similar knives appear throughout these areas also after the 1 1th century B.C.48 But the knives from the 12th-l 1th centuries B.C. are of particular importance since they are among the earliest iron tools found in the ancient world. The knife-blade from Tomb 562 at Tell el-Far'ah and our handle are perhaps the earliest examples from Israel, and both are dated to the 12th century B.C. A similar date is given to some of the knives found in the Aegean and Photo 4. Iron bracelet. Cyprus. The origin of these knives is disputed. Recently the subject was extensively surveyed by Waldbaum, who challenged earlier views, suggesting a possible Cypriot or Levantine origin. Waldbaum does not exclude a possible Aegean origin, spreading to Cyprus in association with the Aegean immigra- tion to the island during the 12th century B.C.49 This suggestion may have interesting implications for the relationship between the appearance of iron knives in the Levant and the migration of the "Sea Peoples" to this region (see Chapter XXII). An Iron Bracelet (Fig. 2:2, Photo 4) Reg. No. 1981; Locus 131; Level 22.05 m; Stratum X. This bracelet was found on the floor of Temple 131. It is made of an open iron ring having an outer and drawing of our knife during his visit in Israel, rejects any connection between our find and European traditions. This may also, of course, affect Schaeffer's conclusions concern- ing the knife from Enkomi. See, however, Waldbaum's note, op. cit. (above, note 33), p. 332: "it seems clear, however, that the parallels for the Tell Qasile knife are far reaching and any conclusions about its antecedents should be held in abeyance". 43. Waldbaum, op. cit., pp. 325-338. 44. In addition to our knife, an additional iron knife blade with bronze rivets was found at Tell Qasile (Area A, No. 2913). The stratigraphie location of this blade is not entirely clear; it may be attributed to either Stratum X or Stratum IX (the blade is mentioned by Waldbaum, op. cit., p. 341 , No. 60); Tel Zeror III, PI. LXIII: 10 and another unpublished knife (see Waldbaum, op.cit., p. 342, Nos. 69-70); Gezer III, PI. LXX- XIII: 29 (Waldbaum, p. 342, No. 7 4); Beth Pelet I, Pl.

A similar brace- let was found in Area A at Tell Qasile, where it was attributed to Stratum VIII. Such iron bracelets are one of the most common iron objects in the Levant during the 12-1 1th centu- ries B.C. and they continue to appear during the 10th century B.C.;50 The earliest appearance of such brace- lets is in 12th century B.C. Philistine tombs at Tell el-Far'ah (S), and thus they may have been intro- duced into this country by the "Sea Peoples". The find of such a bracelet in a Mycenean IIIQ tomb at Ialissos51 strengthens this possibility. Our bracelet should probably be interpreted as a gift to the temple, while most of the other bracelets of this type were found in tombs, i.e., they were burial gifts. An Amorphic Iron Lump (Photo 5) Reg. No. 2628; Locus 221; Level 21.26 m; Stratum XII. This is a much corroded, amorphic lump of iron, 7 cm long and 2.5 cm thick. It was found in a clear Stratum XII context, and is further evidence for the use of iron by the earliest Philistine settlers on the site. Besides these three iron objects from Area C, there are several iron objects from Area A, including two (a flat object and an iron tool) which have been attrib- uted to Strata XII-X, two others (an iron knife and a Photo 5. Iron lump. trapezoidal object) to Stratum IX, and three others generally attributed to the "Iron Age II". Consider- ing the large area of the Iron Age I town cleared at Tell Qasile, the number of iron objects attributed to this period (5 altogether) is an indication of the limited use of this metal at that time even among the Philistines. The question of the origin of iron technology in the Iron Age, and the role of the Philistines in its intro- duction into Palestine, is complex and controversial. Recently, J.D. Muhly has defended the traditional view, relating the appearance of iron in this country with the appearance of the "Sea Peoples", especially the Philistines.52 His argumentation is based on the distribution of iron artefacts in the Aegean and Cyprus during the 12th century B.C., together with the appearance of Mycenean IIIQ pottery. While archaeologists of the Aegean world would see in these artefacts (especially those found in the Aegean) objects of trade relations with the east,53 Muhly would reverse such a conclusion. On the other hand, J. Waldbaum (followed by Trude Dothan)54 hesitates to identify the "Sea Peoples" as those responsible for the introduction of iron into the Levant, though admitting that most of the earliest iron implements found in Israel indeed came to light in Philistine contexts. I would agree with Muhly regarding the necessary link between the appearance of iron in 12th century B.C. contexts - in Israel, the Aegean and Cyprus - as an indication of the role of the "Sea Peoples" in the distribution of this "new" metal. Cyprus must have played an important role in this respect. However, all agree that iron remained a rare metal throughout the Iron Age I, while bronze retain- ing its dominance until ca. 1,000 B.C. 3. GOLD Slight evidence for the use of gold was found in Locus 125, the favissa of Stratum XI. Two small fragments of gold earrings were found (Reg. No. 2236). They are probably the thin ends of drop-shaped gold earrings. The fragments are 8 mm long and 1 mm in diameter. 50. Waldbaum, op. cit. (1978, above, n. 46), pp. 24-27. 51. A.M.

However, the results of Waldbaum's new research on bimetallic objects {op. cit., above n. 33), which points to a possible Aegean origin of some of the early iron tool-making traditions, may support the hypothesis that "Sea Peoples" brought this technique to the Levant, since we tend to see the origin of the "Sea Peoples" in the Aegean (see the concluding chapter). 9</page><page sequence="17">Fig. 3. Ivory objects. B. IVORY OBJECTS 1. A Bird-shaped Cosmetic Box (Fig. 3:1, Photo 6) Reg. No. 3342; Locus 227; Level 21.41 m; Stratum XI (Temple 200). This box is made from an ivory slab 2 cm thick; it is 15 cm long, 5.5 cm wide and 2 cm high. Its inner container (8.2 cm long, 4.9 cm wide and 1.2 cm deep) is rounded at the tail and straight at the front. At the breast is a rounded projection with a round socket, 0.9 cm in diameter and 1.5 cm deep. Two round holes, 0.35 cm in diameter, are drilled near the front part of the container. By analogy to similar cosmetic boxes it can be surmised that the socket was intended for the neck and head of the bird, while the two smaller holes had held ivory pins on which two ivory wings had hinged, serving as a lid to close the box. The tail (3.0 x 5.3 cm), carved in one piece with the body, slightly flares out and bears four incised herringbone bands in alternating directions. Our box is one of the latest among the large group of such boxes, known throughout the Late Bronze Age in Egypt, the Levant and the Aegean. These boxes seem to have originated in Egypt, where they were made in both ivory and wood.55 In the Egyptian examples, both the wings and tail were made as sepa- rate pieces. Some of the Egyptian boxes have a single oval lid and lack abird's-head. Twenty-five examples found in the Levant and the Aegean are summarised in Table l.56 Type A in the table includes boxes with the lid in the form of two wings (like our example), while those of Type B have a single elliptical lid. Type B is the more common (70% of the total examples) and is also the earlier: two examples of this type are known from 55. W.F. Petrie, Illahun, Kahun and Gurob , London 1891, PI. XVIII: 27; M.

Late Bronze Age I contexts, while Type A is known from Late Bronze Age II contexts only. In addition to the complete boxes and bodies mentioned in the table, fragments of wings and heads have been found in various contexts.57 However, only few such frag- ments can be dated later than the Late Bronze Age: an ivory bird's-head from Beth-Shan Stratum VI,58 and the complete box from Kition (No. 22 in the table), as well as an ivory bird's-wing from Temple 2 at Kition (defined as a "sphinx wing" by the excava- tor, yet probably part of a similar box).59 Our box is thus the best-preserved evidence for the continuation of such ivory boxes into the Iron Age I. It differs from the Late Bronze Age boxes in the rectangular shape of the body, and in its flatter proportions. The curve of the tail, continuating the body, finds parallels in two of the Late Bronze Age examples (Nos. 4 and 9), as well as in the complete box from Kition. In this latter example, probably contemporaneous with our box, the tail also bears an incised pattern (concentric circles and semi-circles). Ivory boxes of our type have been discussed by J. Sakilarakis, in relation to a box from Mycenae.60 Following other Aegean archaeolo- gists, he regards the bird-shaped box as a stylized model of a ship with bird-shaped prow; since there are several Aegean depictions of ships with such prows (a seal from Hagia Triada; a Mycenean UIC stirrup-jar from Skyros, and the "Sea People" ships at Medinet Habu), he suggests that such boxes origi- nated in the Minoan and later the Mycenean world. Other Mycenean objects decorated with the bird's- head motif, sometimes turned back, as on boxes of 57. Fragments of lids in the shape of wings (our Type A) were found at Dan, Megiddo, Gezer and Alalakh (see references for Nos. 1-2, 7, 21 in the previous note and in Megiddo Ivories , PI. 12: 45-53; elliptical lids (our Type B) were found at Lachish, Tell es-Safi and Ugarit (see references for Nos. 11,16 and 21 in the table and in Lachish II, Pl. XIX: 16-17; ivory bird heads which may have been parts of such boxes were found at Megiddo Stratum VIII and in the ivory treasure of Stratum VII there, at Lachish and at Asine (Crete); see Megiddo II, PI. 245: 23; Megiddo Ivories , PI. 45: 202-209; Lachish II, PI.

Ivory cosmetic box. our type, are cited.61 According to Sakilarakis, the Egyptian boxes are local imitations of Mycenean originals, while most of the examples from the Levant were imported from Mycenae. This conclusion does not, however, appear to be justified. Examples from Egypt, cited above (and not brought by Sakilarakis), are superior in style and execution to those from Greece. The boxes from Megiddo and Alalakh, dated to the Late Bronze Age I, predate the Mycenean examples and appear to be products of a local ivory- carving school, inspired by Egyptian products.62 The few boxes from the Aegean (three examples) appear to be imported from the Levant, and not vice versa! The box from Tell Qasile thus reflects the continua- tion of a local Canaanite artistic tradition which went through certain stylistic modifications in the Iron Age I. There may have been some relationship between bird-shaped cosmetic boxes of our type and the bird- shaped pottery cult bowls found at New Kingdom Deir el-Medineh in Egypt, and in the Iron Age I contexts at Tell Qasile, Megiddo and probably also Tell es-Safi.63 The bird motif in both these objects emphasises the popularity of this motif in Egyptian, Canaanite and Philistine art. A direct Aegean influ- ence should thus probably be ruled out. 2. A Small Bowl (Fig. 3:2) Reg. No. 2057; Locus 188 (Temple 131); Level 21.85 m; Stratum X. This small bowl was found burnt and broken to many small pieces, and could be reconstructed by drawing only. It is 7.6 cm in diameter, 2.9 cm high, and has a rounded body, flat rim, rounded base and inner rounded depression. Its rim is decorated on its upper surface with four incised concentric circles with a zigzag between the circles. The bowl has two flat handles, vertically pierced (0.3 cm in diameter). Four similar ivory bowls are known from Israel: three in Late Bronze Age contexts (Megiddo VII, Lachish, Fosse Temple III and Gezer),64 and one from a 12th century B.C. tomb at Tell es-Sayidieh.65 Other boxes of this type are known at Ugarit, while lids of such boxes have been found at Lachish and Megiddo, all in Late Bronze Age contexts.66 Tomb 9 at Kition (13th century B.C.) yielded a large faience bowl of similar profile, which is consi- dered by Peltenberg to be a North-Syrian or Cypriot product.67 All the Late Bronze Age examples have a 6 1 .

Discussion The few ivory objects found at Tell Qasile are a further contribution to an increasing list of such objects from Iron Age I (12-1 1th centuries B.C. Con- texts in Israel. The Megiddo treasure (Stratum VIIA) is considered to represent the Late Bronze Age tradi- tion, yet in fact a cartouche of Rameses III, found on one of the objects, dates it to the Iron Age IA, and at least some of the ivory objects in this treasure were probably produced during this period.71 Other ivory objects from the 12th century include: (1) several objects from Tomb 101 at Tell es- Sayidieh (two goblets, a "swimming girl" bottle and two small bowls);72 (2) several ivory objects from Tombs 7, 66 and 90 in the Northern Cemetery at Beth-Shan (including a gaming board, cosmetic bowls, "swimming girl" bot- tle, comb and spacer-beads) which may tentatively be dated to the 12th century B.C. (except the "swimming girl" bottle, where the tomb also contained Late Bronze Age pottery);73 (3) an ivory goblet decorated with goats, found at Hama, Period I,74 should probably also be dated to the 12th century B.C. Other ivories can be safely dated to the 11th cen- tury B.C., including: (1) a richly decorated cylindrical box and a lid of a cosmetic box of fish-shape, probably of Egyptian origin, both from Megiddo StratumVI;75 (2) the lid of a gaming board from Tell el-Far'ah (S), Tomb 220;76 (3) a lion-shaped ivory spout from Tel Masos, Stratum II;77 (4) a decorated handle and several other small objects from Tell Keisan, Stratum 9;78 (5) a miniature pomegranate vessel from Shiqmonah;79 (6) a flat bowl with bar handle from a cist tomb at Achzib;80 (7) a comb from Gezer, Tomb 59, decorated with guilloche and incisions, found with Philistine pottery, should be dated to the Iron Age I in general.81 All these ivories, like those from Tell Qasile, are made in the Canaanite tradition of the Late Bronze Age, and they illustrate the continuation of ivory 68.

Oren dates all the ivories from Beth-Shan to the 13th century B.C., on the basis of typological comparisons to other finds, specially at Megiddo. Yet the terminus ad quem of the Megiddo hoard is at least the reign of Rameses III, and there is no reason to think that ivories such as those found in the Beth-Shan tombs were not produced during the Iron Age I. 74.

It is in the 10th century B.C. that there is a gap in finds of ivories, which may be haphazard or due to an actual gap in production. In any case, the finds from the 12th-l 1th centuries B.C. bridge at least a large part of the supposed extensive gap in ivory production between the 13th century and the 9th-8th centuries B.C.82 The continuation of ivory carving during the Iron Age I probably flourished in the coastal plains and in the Valley of Jezreel, where the Canaanite cultural tradition was retained. C. ALABASTER OBJECTS Two alabaster vessels were found in Area C. A third vessel, found at Area B in 1956, is published here as well. All three vessels are of Egyptian alabaster (cal- cite) - a yellowish, hard, semi-transparent stone - differing from local gypsum, of which many imita- tions of Egyptian vessels were made during the Late Bronze Age.83 An Alabaster Flask (Fig. 4:1, Photo 7) Reg. No. 3761; Level 22.34 m; Stratum X. The flask was found within brick wall 551, a parti- tion wall to which the raised platform of Temple 131 was attached. A juglet, bowl and a pottery flask were found together with this flask, in what seems to be a building deposit. The intact flask is 13.5 cm high and 1 1 .5 cm in diameter. The lentoid body has a thick wall in the lower part (1.7 cm) which becomes thinner at the centre (0.5 cm). The handles are rounded, with the central hole made by a drill. The thickened rim is rounded on the outer edge. Similar flasks are com- mon in Egypt during the New Kingdom.84 A similar 82. H.

A "Kohl Poť' (Fig. 4:2, Photo 8) Reg. No. 2966; Locus 227; Level 21.40 m; Stratum XI. This intact vessel was found in Locus 227, among the offering vessels at the south-western corner of Temple 200. It is 5 cm high and 4.6 cm in diameter; the central hole is 1 .5 cm in diameter and 3.6 cm deep. Traces of a dark substance can be seen on the inside. The vessel has a flaring, pointed rim, high carinated shoulder and four small feet. Kohl pots of this general type are well known in Egypt and were imported into Palestine during the Late Bronze Age.87 Yet vessels of similar shape and having four feet are quite rare in Egypt.88 Only one such vessel is known from Palestine, from an obscure context at Gezer.89 An Alabaster Vessel (Fig. 4:3, Photo 8) Reg. No. QIV 1045/7; Area B, Locus 106; Level 17.70 m; Stratum X. This vessel came to light in 1956, in a stratigraphie trench excavated on the western slope of the mound. It is intact, 12.3 cm high, with a maximal diameter of 5.7 cm. The rim is everted, and the vessel has two duck-head handles with small central holes (repre- senting the eye) and an elongated body with a pointed, knobbed base. This is an Egyptian type common during the New Kingdom. Two examples are known from Late Bronze Age contexts in Pales- tine: one from Tomb 538 at Lachish and the other from the Amman Temple.90 These two objects, as well as a vessel from Beth-Shan Stratum V,91 also have duck-head handles. In discussing the vessel from Amman, Mrs. Hankey cites the vessel from Tell Qasile, claiming that it could be no later than the Late Bronze Age and was probably an "antique" in the 11th century B.C. context where it was found.92 Photo 8.

The three alabaster vessels from Tell Qasile are all made of Egyptian calcite and probably all three were imported from Egypt. There are only few other Egyp- tian alabaster vessels in Iron Age I contexts in Pales- tine - at Beth-Shan and at Tell Deir 'Alia.93 In Egypt itself, as far as I have been able to check, there are no similar published vessels from clear 12th-l 1th cen- tury B.C. contexts. The lack of recent publications concerning the development of Egyptian alabaster vessels of this period raises a problem concerning the date of our three objects. On the basis of available publications, it appears that all three of our objects were made in Egypt during the New Kingdom, prob- ably long before the settlement at Tell Qasile was founded. All three objects were found in Strata XI-X, i.e., in 1 1th century B.C. contexts, and thus it may be concluded that they were imported from Egypt dur- ing the 11th century B.C., while in Egypt itself they were heirlooms from a previous period. In their pres- ent context, they may indicate relations with Egypt during the 20th dynasty, even though the objects themselves may be much earlier. D.

A deep, V-shaped mortar with flat base, made of basalt, 19 cm high, with a rim diameter of 29 cm, and walls 2.5 cm thick. It was found on the floor of Room 168, near the silo at the corner of the room, where a heap of lentils was found. It was probably used in the household, though this room may have served as a brewery;94 in such case, this vessel would have been used for grinding grain for the brewery. Photo 12. Basalt mortar (2063). Querns and Pestles Several grinding stones, both querns and rubbing stones, were found in Area C, most of them in a fragmentary state. They are mostly of "beach-rock", a hard rock found along the coast of Israel. The best example was found in Building 225, on a raised brick platform;95 this large, flat slab of stone, slightly con- cave on top, has an elongated pestle with pointed ends, convex above and flat below. An outstanding grinding stone was found in Room 314 of Stratum XII (Reg. No. 3769, Photo 13). It is rectangular, 72 cm long, and somewhat narrower at the middle. In profile, it is concave, with a flat edge at one side. The stone is made with exceptional care. A similar stone was found at Megiddo, Stratum VI, Photo 13.

Room 314, where the stone was found, was the main chamber attached to the Stratum XII temple court- yard; thus, it may be assumed that this exceptional grinding stone was used for preparing the sacred meals served in the cult of the shrine. E. BEADS Reg. No. 2924; Locus 227 (Temple 200); Stratum XI. This registration number was given to 809 small faience beads, found among the offering vessels in Room 227. All the beads were probably part of a single necklace. Each bead is ring-shaped, 0.3 cm in diameter with a central hole 0. 15 cm in diameter and 0.15 cm long. The group included 477 light-green beads, 244 yel- low beads, 55 red beads and 33 black beads, Similar beads are common in various Late Bronze Age and Iron Age contexts, among them the Timna temple, where 2,500 beads of this type were found.97 Reg. No. 2946 is a biconical carnelian bead, 0.7 cm long, found together with the previous beads and probably part of the same necklace. Reg. No. 2861 (Fig. 5:4), Locus 194, is a biconical bead of black hard stone. Biconical beads similar to the two last examples are common during the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age I.98 Reg. No. 3210 from Locus 261 (Stratum XI) is a cylindrical carnelian bead, 0.5 cm long and 0.6 cm in diameter. F. SCARAB Only one scarab was found in Area C; it is discussed below, along with a similar scarab from Area A, found in an earlier season. Reg. No. 2912; Locus 230; Level 21.02 m; Stratum XII (Fig. 6:1, Photo 15). The scarab is made of white faience, it is 1.6 cm long, 1. 1 cm wide and 0.8 cm high. The upper part is broken, and thus the form of elythra and prothorax cannot be determined. The schematic depiction on the scarab (described according to an impression) shows a charioteer driving a chariot, the single visible wheel having four spokes (not meeting at the centre). The driver's legs are spread; his hands are stretched out to the sides; his headdress has a frontal projec- tion, and he is holding a bow and reins. The horse has a long neck and tail, and short legs. A second human Photo 14. Necklace made of faience beads (2024). 96. Megiddo I, PI. 114: 11 (Locus 1729). 97.

No. QII 2603 (Fig. 6ś.2), was found in Area A, Room L2, and was attributed to Stratum VIII." It has a very similar chariot scene, though here the charioteer is shown holding a long object - possibly a rudely drawn bow. The chario- teer's headdress is less clear, but it also may have a frontal projection. The man before the horse holds a bridle. Though this scarab was attributed to Stratum VIII, this stratigraphie attribution is not certain since the entire Building L is obscure stratigraphically and should probably be dated to an earlier phase. The two scarabs are made in a style not characteristic of the common New Kingdom styles of scarab engraving. It is schematic, lacking any details of dress, chariot, etc. Both the style and the subject find parallels in three other scarabs found in Israel: two from Tell el-Far'ah (S) (Tombs 533 and 609), and one from Gezer.100 Tomb 533 at Tell el-Far'ah contained only one pot- tery vessel, dated to the 19th dynasty, while Tomb 609 contained an Iron Age I flask and an iron brace- let, and thus should be dated to the Iron Age I. The scarab from Gezer was found in an undetermined context. A fourth scarab of this type has been pub- lished by Newberry.101 Another group of scarabs from Israel, also dated to the Iron Age I and stylistically related to our group, depicts a hunting scene: a human figure shooting an arrow toward an animal with upturned tail (probably a lion), a second human figure on the other side of the animal, and a crouching horned animal above. Seven scarabs can be attributed to this group, four from Tell el-Far'ah (S) (Tombs 102, 133, 601, and 506), one from Beth-Shan, Strata VI-V, one from Tell Jemmeh, Level 188EM, and one from Tomb 7 at Amathos, Photo 15.

This style is foreign to the Egyptian glyptic style of the New Kingdom. The distribution of the scarabs of this group, and their dating, point to its being a local style, probably related to a Philistine (or related) school of glyptic art active in southern Palestine during the Iron Age I. There is a connection between this group and the engraving of the conical seals, as can be learned from a conical seal from Tell el-Far'ah showing a chariot scene similar to ours.104 This glyptic group is rooted, to our mind, in a glyptic style common in Cyprus during the Late Bronze Age. Some of the Cypriot cylinder-seals and conical seals are carved in a similar manner.105 One of these cylinder-seals, found at Tell Abu-Hawam,106 shows a chariot scene not unsimilar to ours. The genetic relationship between Cypriot glyptic style and Philistine glyptic art is an interesting subject which calls for special treatment.107 We are thus inclined to regard this group of scarabs as related to the Philistine culture; the combination of the Egyptian tradition of making scarab-shaped seals was combined, in this group, with a Cypriot-rooted glyptic style and probably also subjects, though the latter may have been inspired by Egyptian or Canaan- ite motifs as well.108 The scarab from Stratum XII is the only seal found in Area C. Tell Qasile has produced other types of seals. We may mention two pyramidal seals,109 a "negro's-head" scaraboid110 and a conch-shaped seal. Thus almost all the known types of Iron Age I seals are represented at Tell Qasile. And there seems to be an interesting relationship between the last- mentioned types and the culture of the "Sea Peoples".111 102. Beth-Pelet I, Pis.

INTRODUCTION The excavation in Area C at Tell Qasile revealed rich, homogeneous groups of pottery vessels from the var- ious strata. Some of these groups, from Strata XII-X, contained large numbers of restorable vessels, found on floors in clear stratigraphie contexts. Other loci contained only sherds, yet even there most of the loci were undisturbed, and were usually found sealed between clear stratigraphie elements of earlier and later strata. This situation enables a detailed study of the typological development of the pottery types and decoration throughout the 12th-10th centuries B.C. For the period between the mid- 12th century and the late 1 1th century B.C., Tell Qasile probably provides the best stratified and richest homogeneous groups of pottery in Israel. B. METHODOLOGY The treatment of pottery found in stratified excava- tions in Israel is problematic. There are various approaches, from the discarding of most of the sherds as irrelevant to the research, relying mainly on re- stored homogeneous groups found on floors, to the other extreme, where even the smallest sherds from various soil layers (such as fills) are retained and published. 1 In our work at Tell Qasile an intermediate mode was taken, suited to the character of the finds. During actual excavations, the procedure was to collect all pottery found; after washing, the restorable pottery (judged according to the character of the find spot) was kept. Pottery from other loci was sorted, discarding undecorated body sherds and some of the handles and bases; all rim fragments, decorated body sherds and a sample of handles and bases from each locus were kept for further research. The pottery was marked with basket and sherd numbers; thus 3546/18 denotes sherd no. 18 in basket 3546. By this procedure we were able to obtain a complete pottery assemblage from the restorable loci, including all the pottery found on the floors of the four temples 319, 200, 300 and 131, all that from Building 225 of Stra- tum X, and several other groups found outside these structures in Area C, particularly Loci 125, 244, 204, and 147. After the lengthy process of restoration, all com- plete vessels and a large sample of sherds were drawn on a scale of 2:5 (reduced in this publication to 1:5, except for the large jars, which are published at 1:10). The next step was the building-up of a type-series for the pottery of Strata XII- VIII. Such a series would facilitate classification, discussion of the pottery as a whole, and description of that pottery which was not to be illustrated. However, establishing the type- series was not an easy task; while in certain classes there are homogeneous types, found in large numbers in certain strata, in other classes there are many variations in profile, and sometimes it was impossible to find two similar vessels. This phenomenon charac- terizes the pottery production of this period, in con- trast to other periods where mass production of almost identical vessels can be found. The typological classification applied in this section is based on the profiles of the vessels. Many of the main groups have been divided into sub-groups, based on minor ele- ments, such as various handle forms added to bowls of similar profile, etc. The basic approach has been to establish wide range typological groups which, though containing variations, enable common dis- cussion of large numbers of vessels. An important criterion in this classification was how far could rim sherds be related to typological groups established on the basis of complete vessels. Our classification has enabled such attributions, and thus provides the basis for registration, on a typological basis, of thousands of sherds not included in the publication. This scheme provides the best method for presenting the full contents of the various loci, as can be seen in the 1. See the approach suggested by Aharoni, as opposed to that suggested by the excavators of Gezer. Y. Aharoni, "Remarks on the 'Israeli' Method of Excavation", Eretz Israel 1 1 (1973), p. 50 (Hebrew). The approach of the Gezer expedition is reflected in the final reports, Gezer I-II (HUC)' see: J.D. Seger, "The Pottery Recording System", in: W.G. Dever and H.D. Lance, A Manual of Field Excavation , Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati 1978, pp. 107-138. 21</page><page sequence="29">catalogue of loci at the end of this volume.2 The fact that all rim sherds were kept and registered has pro- vided a basis for quantitative analysis of the pottery, based on the typological classification. Though effort was made to include most of the pottery in the typological classification, we found a good number of forms which appear only once or are exceptional. These were included as 'exceptional' or 'variations' in the discussion of the various forms. In other cases the fragment was too small or too insig- nificant to be included in the typological seriation. The treatment of the surface, i.e., slip, burnish and painted decoration, was not considered in establish- ing the classification. These important factors may vary and develop separately in each of the typological groups throughout the period under discussion. Thus, though these factors have been emphasized in the discussion of each type, they are discussed sepa- rately at the end of the typological discussion. The description of the pottery, accompanying the Figures, is brief but comprehensive. In various recent publications of pottery from Israel we find a sophisti- cated approach, including a very detailed analysis of clay colour and inclusions.3 Here it was decided to follow the traditional, abridged descriptions used in most Israeli excavations; this decision followed experimental use of Munsell colour charts for de- scribing our wares. The charts were abandoned after it was found that, for one and the same sherd, different registrars obtained different results using the charts. Though colour description in reference to the Mun- sell charts could perhaps be more objective, we found that the results did not justify the amount of work involved in using them. Neutron-activation analysis of pottery samples from Tell Qasile (below, Chapter XXI) has shown that the bulk of the pottery from Strata XII- VIII is local, despite various differences in the clay colours. This analysis, as well as morphological examination of the pottery, have pointed to considerable homoge- neity of most of the pottery from Strata XII-X and IX- VIII on the site. The registration of all the pottery from Tell Qasile, including thousands of unpublished sherds from stratified loci, was carried out with the aid of the Hebrew University computor, on specially designed forms enabling the description of various aspects of the pottery.4 Each line in the computor data sheets was devoted to a single sherd or a complete vessel, with the vertical division into the following categories: Columns Subject 7-10 Basket number 11-12 Sherd number 13-18 Locus number 19-21 Stratum 25-26 Breakage Definitions: (1) Whole vessel (no parts missing); (2) Complete vessel (full profile from rim to base); (3) Rim fragment; (4) Rim, neck and handle; (5) Rim and body fragment; (6) Body frag- ment; (7) Handle; (8) Base; (10) Ring base; (11) Disc base. 28-29 Vessel Definitions: AM - Amphoriskos; BL - Bowl; BT - Bottle; CH - Chal- ice; CP - Cooking-pot; CS - Cup-and-saucer; CT - Baking-tray; FN - Funnel; GB - Goblet; JG - Jug; JT - Juglet; KR - Krater; LP - Lamps: FL - Pilgrim-flask; PT - Pithos; PX - Pyxis; SJ - Storage-jar; ST - Stirrup-jar; SD - Stand; VR - Varia 30-31 Type (Arabic numerals) 32-33 Sub-type (letters) 34 Further division (Arabic numerals; used in few cases). Thus, a complete type description could read: BL 14bl. 2. The typological approach was first used in Palestine by Sir Flinders Petrie. His approach was summarized in Duncan's CPP. This approach led the foundation to Tufnell's typologi- cal classification in the Lachish reports. Yet this approach was neglected by most American and Israeli archaeologists working in Palestine. Recently, however, the need for the use of a typological seriation was emphasized and practiced by McClellan in his doctoral thesis: T.L. McClellan, Quantita- tive Studies in the Iron Age Pottery of Palestine (Ph. D thesis), University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, 1975. The publication of the Middle Bronze pottery from Shechem is also based on a type-series, made in a very accurate and detailed system. See: D.P. Cole, Shechem 1, The Middle Bronze IIB Pottery, Winnona Lake, 1984. 3. Examples of a meticulous method of pottery description can be found in the Gezer and Taanach reports.

This computerized catalogue is too large to be included in the present publication, but it is available at the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew Uni- versity in Jerusalem. An abridged version is pre- sented on pp. 152-158, including the number of complete vessels and sherds in each locus, according to the type-series. It thus makes available data on the quantitative aspect of the distribution of various types in the various loci and strata. A series of tables, produced by the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) system, and based on the data in the cata- logue, provides concentrated quantitative data on some aspects of the pottery from Strata XII-X. Though the type-series also includes the pottery from Strata IX- VIII, that material, including mainly sherds from the open areas of Area C, was not ana- lysed quantitatively and is not included in the cata- logue; the pottery Figures relating to these strata represent the main types found in their respective loci. C. PRESENTATION OF THE POTTERY The graphic presentation of the pottery (Figs. 11-58) is arranged according to strata and loci. Most of the complete vessels, and a representative selection of sherds from each of the strata, are represented, begin- ning with Stratum XII. In each of the strata, the plates of pottery are arranged according to architec- tural units: the pottery from each defined architectu- ral unit (an entire building, courtyard, street, etc.) was assembled. Naturally, each of these units is com- posed of several loci, the numbers of which are given in the descriptions to the plates. Comparison with the plans and the stratigraphie discussion presented in Part One of this report provides the stratigraphie and architectural context of these pottery groups. The text is arranged in three chapters: Chapter XVIII is devoted to a typological discus- sion of the plain or sparsely decorated pottery. Chap- ter XIX is a discussion of the pottery decorated in Philistine style. Chapter XX is devoted to the selec- tion of sherds from the Iron Age II layers of 'Stratum VII'. The bulk of the pottery, about 80% of the material from Strata XII-X, is discussed in Chapter XVIII. Since many different types reappear in the same stratum, and continue to appear over the var- ious strata, we have decided to discuss the pottery from Strata XII- VIII together, according to the type- series. The development of each type and sub-type throughout these strata is discussed separately. Thus the reader is provided with both a visual view of the main homogeneous loci, according to units and strata, and a typological discussion of the pottery as a whole. The material in Figures 11-58 includes most of the complete vessels (except for some of the storage jars from Building 225, which are similar to the published types) and a selection of sherds from the various strata. The other sherds from stratified loci of Strata XII-X appear in the catalogue of loci, as explained above. In addition to this material, there is a quantity of sherds from unstratified loci (wash layers, surface soil, disturbed loci, etc.), as well as unpublished strat- ified sherds from Strata IX- VII, containing repeti- tious forms which have been excluded from this report. The following are the main homogeneous groups, in the order of their appearance in Figures 11-58. Stratum XII Fig. 11. Pottery from Temple 3 19 (see Fig. 7).

Fig. 16:1-14- Two complete vessels and some sherds from Locus 320, a floor north of Temple 319, and sealed by Floors 244 and 3 10 of Stratum XI. Bedrock was exposed a few cm beneath the floor. Fig. 16:15-28; 17:1-8. Sherds from Locus 262, at the south-eastern part of Area C, found on and above a floor, and sealed by floors of Strata XI and X. Fig. 17:9-15. Sherds from Basket 2626, collected in Pit 220, attributed either to Stratum XII or to Stratum XI (the stratigraphie attribution of the pit remains unclear). Fig. 17:16-18. Three sherds from trial pit 274 and Locus 221, the stratigraphie attribution of which is not sure. No. 16 may be attributed to Stratum XI. Fig. 17:19-22. Four sherds from Locus 315, found among the white lime layers of Stratum XII, 20 cm above bedrock. Fig. 17:23-26. Four sherds from Room 314, found on the floor of the room, and sealed by a floor of Stra- tum XI. Fig. 17:27. A bottle found on a small section of floor (Locus 199) in square 64B3-4. Stratum XI Figs. 18-21. Vessels from Temple 200, the group includes 66 complete vessels and 20 sherds (see Fig. 8). Most of the vessels were found in Locus 227, the small cell at the south-western corner of the temple, sealed by the artificial fill of the Stratum X floor.5 Only a few vessels were found in other parts of the building (Loci 200, 203). All the vessels were found lying on the floor, except the stirrup-jar (Fig. 21:1), which was found 20 cm below the floor, attached to the brick wall 619 of the previous building, yet still well above the floor of that structure.6 This vessel seems to have been buried below the floor level by the people of Stratum XI, though it could also be attrib- uted to Stratum XII. Figs. 22-23. Four complete vessels and a selection of sherds from Courtyard 281 of Stratum XI. In Tell Qasile 1 we explained the raisings of floor levels in the courtyard. A large number of sherds were found on these floors, without any typological distinction between them. Most of the sherds, all of repetitious forms, are listed in the catalogue, while only a selec- tion appears in the figures. Figs. 24, 25:1-3. Fifteen complete vessels and some sherds from Locus 244, a homogeneous group found near the northern wall of Temple 200, outside the building sealed by the floor of Room 204 of Stratum X (Fig. 8). 7 Fig. 25:4-20. Vessels and sherds from the northern part of Area C. Nos. 13, 17 were found on the floor of Room 26 1 . Since the same floor was probably in use also in Stratum X, these three items may be attributed either to Stratum XI orto Stratum X. Nos. 6-12, 14, 20 are from the two floor levels in Room 276. The remainder originated in various loci in the open area north-west of Temple 200. Since the stratigra- phie attribution in this area was not always clear, only a few sherds are published here. Fig. 26:1-14. A group of eight complete vessels and some sherds from Room 147, at the south-eastern corner of Area C, mostly found on the floor, except for storage jar No. 14, found beneath the floor. It might be attributed either to Stratum XII or to Stra- tum XI; in the latter case the jar might have been placed into^ a pit dug through the Stratum XI floor. Fig. 26:17-21. Some sherds from Building 147, east and south of Room 147. No. 18 was found on a floor which could be attributed to both Strata XI and X. 5. Tell Qasile 1, PI. 7: 1-2. 6. Ibid., Pl. 4: 3. 1.

Pottery from Loci 174 and 269. No. 11 was found on Floor 269. The other sherds originate in fills and other unclear contexts, their stratigraphie attributions being based on their levels; this area, however, was rife with stratigraphie difficulties, and thus the attributions are not sure. Fig. 27:16-21. Pottery from trial pits south of Temple 200, all the loci there being sealed by Building 225 of Stratum X (and thus their attribution to Stratum XI is sure). Figs. 28-31. Pottery from Pit 125, including 50 com- plete vessels and 46 fragments (Photo 16). Most of the complete vessels and large fragments were discovered in a 40 cm thick layer of earth in the lower part of the pit, together with cult objects.8 These vessels were placed there, together with the cult objects, probably toward the end of the period of Temple 200 and the transition to Temple 131. The pit was sealed by Floor 190 of Stratum X. Many small sherds, found in the upper layers of the pit, not included in the Figures, are of types represented among the complete vessels, and are registered in the catalogue. Strata XI-X Fig. 32. A group of nine complete and four almost complete vessels from Shrine 300, found near the cylindrical stands at the south-western corner of the room (Photo 17). The peculiar stratigraphie attribu- tion of Shrine 300 was already explained.9 It can be assumed that the vessels found on the floor of this cult room were in use at the end of its use, i.e., the end of Stratum X. Yet some of the vessels may have been kept in the room for a long period, possibly even from the time of Stratum XI, when the structure was founded. No other sherds were found here.

Some large fragments of lower parts of kraters and jars have not been published, but are included in the catalogue. This group, among the richest at Tell Qasile, is presented separately from the rest of the finds from Temple 131, since Room 188 may have been used as a repository for offering ves- sels which went out of use during the floruit of the building. Thus, some of these vessels may span the entire period in which the building was in use, and not merely the final days of its existence, as is the case with the vessels found in other parts of the structure. Figs. 39-43:10. Temple 131 (except Locus 188)(Photo 19). These 55 complete or almost complete vessels and 30 sherds were found in various parts of Temple 131, though most are from Locus 134, south of the raised platform, at the south-western corner of the building (see Fig. 9). The vessels were found within a thick layer of burnt debris.11 Fig. 43:11-24.

BOWLS The various types of bowls comprise almost 50% of the total complete or almost complete vessels. The wide range of variations in form and in details made the typological classification of this group most diffi- cult. We classified the bowls to six main "families", which were further divided into 18 types. Sub-types were given whenever various handles were found attached to certain defined bowl types. FAMILY A. ROUNDED BOWL WITH PLAIN RIM (Photos 20-24) Type BL 1. Rounded body , plain rim, flat or ring base . Stratum XII: Figs. 11:1-5; 12:1-5, 8; 16:1; 17:9. Stratum XI: Figs. 18:1-9; 22:1, 3, 5-7; 24:1-3; 25:4, 6; 26:1-3; 28:5-12, 14; 32:1. Stratum X: Figs. 33:1-14, 18, 21-23; 39: 1-13; 43:11- 12; 44:1-2; 45:9; 46:1-2,4. Stratum IX: Fig. 52:1, 17-18. Stratum VIII: Figs. 54:6-7; 55:3-4. This is the largest and most common group of bowls at Tell Qasile. Most of these bowls are 16-20 cm in diameter and 6-7 cm in height. This proportion of height to diameter, of 1:2.5 or 1:3, is characteristic of the group. Most of the bowls have a shallow ring base, and only a few have a flat base (Figs. 18:1-3, 7; 33:4; 39:1). The body profile varies: some examples have a slightly rounded body (Figs. 12:4; 18:1-3; 39:13), others have a vertical rim (Figs. 12:3; 28:7; 33:18; 46:4), while most have an inverted, rounded rim (like Figs. 22:3; 24:2, etc.). The rim is simple and plain, except in a few cases where it is slightly pinched (12:8), or has a slight groove on the outside (22:6). These variations appear in all the strata and are not indicative of any chronological development. The small group of bowls with almost vertical sides and flat base or fļpt disc base (Fig. 12:4, from Stratum XII, and Fig. 18:1-3, from Stratum XI) recall more than the others the Late Bronze Age forerunners of this type, and they should be regarded as an early variation of this group. Types which are characteris- tic of Stratum X appear already in Strata XII and XI. In contrast to the lack of morphological develop- ment, one can observe a clear development in the surface treatment of these bowls. Most of the exam- ples from Stratum XII are not decorated and have no slip. Only a few examples have red stripes on the outside of the rim (Fig. 1 1:2, 5), and one example has a decoration of red and black lines on the rim (Fig. 12:5). One bowl from Stratum XII is red slipped (yet not burnished!) and is decorated with black, concen- Photo 20. Bowl Type BL 1 (Fig. 39:9). Photo 21. Bowl Type BL 1 (Fig. 39:7). Photo 22.

Bowl Type BL 1 (Fig. 18:9). Photo 24. Bowl Type BL 1 (Fig. 26:2). trie lines within (Fig. 12:2). This is the earliest example of a technique which becomes common in Strata XI-X. The bowls from Temple 200 of Stratum XI are neither slipped nor burnished, yet examples from the courtyard of the temple and from Pit 125 have a red slip and black decoration. The red slip is usually thin and applied in uneven layers. Hand burnishing starts appearing in this stratum on a limited number of examples. It is irregular and sparse. Some of the bowls have black and red stripes decorating the body, without a slip. In Stratum X this type of decoration disappears, while the number of red slipped bowls increases. Here, too, the slip is not homogeneous: there are darker and lighter spots on the same bowl. Many of the bowls in this stratum are burnished in a dense, irregular hand burnishing, of the type defined by Albright as "cordal burnish", yet near the rim the burnish becomes horizontal and parallel to the wheel unarks. Some of the bowls of Stratum X are decorated inside with black, concentric lines or large spirals. Sometimes the rim is decorated with short black stripes. Table 3.

The main parallels, and some important data con- cerning inner chronology, are given below. North: Hazor, Strata XII-IXB.1 Most examples lack red slip or decoration, except one from Stratum XI, with concentric red circles and another from Stratum X, with red slip. None of the bowls is burnished. The type disappears in Stratum IXA. Megiddo, Strata VIIA-VB.2 The type is most popular in Stratum VIA and also appears in clear loci of Stratum VB. A few examples are also known from Strata IVB-VA. Two of the bowls from Stratum VIA are burnished, yet no red slip appears in this stratum. Hand burnished red slip starts to appear only in Stratum VB. Some of the bowls from Stratum VIA are decorated with red or black concentric circles or spirals, like bowls from Stratum X at Tell Qasile. At Taanach bowls of Period I (12th century B.C.) are known, mostly in fragments, yet the few complete examples have a flat base, like bowls from Stratum XII at Tell Qasile, while others have a ring base.3 In Period II (10th century B.C.) the hemispherical bowls become thinner, and are usually red slipped and burnished.4 At Beth-Shan, this type appears in Strata VI-Lower Stratum V,5 and disap- pears in Upper Stratum V. One example from Stra- tum VI has a red band on the rim; red slip starts to appear in Lower Stratum V (on one bowl only). Oren and James emphasize the similarity to New Kingdom Egyptian bowls, yet this simple, basic shape may have developed in both countries simultaneously. Al 'Afula, Stratum IIIA, fragments of similar bowls appear, without slip or burnish.6 Red slipped and burnished bowls of this type appear at Tell Abu- Hawam, in the upper phase of Stratum IV.7 In 10th century B.C. contexts at various sites, such bowls, red slipped and burnished, are in a minority in compari- son to other types.8 Centre : At Gibeon, in a tomb from the end of the Late Bronze Age, one can observe an early appearance of this type of bowl.9 At Tel el-Fûl, irregular hand bur- nishing on such bowls begins appearing in Period II. 10 In 10th century contexts at Tell en-Nasbeh and Lachish, similar bowls appear with burnished red slip.11 At Gezer, the development of this bowl is similar to that at Tell Qasile:12 until Stratum XIII there is no burnished red slip, while some of the bowls are decorated on the rim with red bands. Similar bands still appear in Stratum XII, yet in this stratum a hand burnished red slip starts to appear, and the type continues until Stratum X, dated to the end of the 11th century B.C. Thus, Gezer XII should be parallelled with Tell Qasile XI. At Beth-Shemesh III these bowls are usually decorated with red or black stripes, while an uneven red slip begins to appear in Stratum IIA.13 This may point to a possibility that Stratum III was destroyed in the mid-1 1th century B.C. Philistia and the South : At Ashdod the published material is insufficient to establish the development of the type. One bowl, from a pit which contained much Philistine material, has a black decoration on a red slip. Similar profiles appear in Stratum 8 in Area D.14 At Tel Sippor one bowl from Stratum I is red slipped and burnished, while two bowls from Stra- tum II are not burnished. In a tomb at Nitsanim, two such bowls without burnish appear in an early phase of Iron Age 1. 15 Many bowls of this type were found in Cemeteries 200, 500, 600 and 800 at Tell el-Far'ah (S), covering the entire period from the end of the Late 1.

In the north, slip and burnish do not generally appear until the late 1 1th century B.C. At Tell Qasile, Gezer and, somewhat, at Ashdod and Tel Sippor, the red slip appears from the beginning of the 11th century on. Throughout this century the burnish and black decoration increase. Sub-type BL la. Rounded bowl with one or two horizontal handles Stratum XI: Fig. 18:11; 28:17. See also Fig. 18:19 (below, Type BL 2a) Stratum X: Fig. 39:14. These bowls are similar to bowls of Type 1 , yet they have one or two horizontal handles close to the rim. They are red slipped and bear, in two cases, a black decoration (39:14 is larger than usual, with a diame- ter of 25 cm). A few parallels can be found, at Megiddo Strata VIB-VB, Tell Abu Hawam Stratum IV, Tell Jerisheh, Tell Beit Mirsim Strata B1-B2, Tell el-Far'ah (S) (Tombs 562 and 542), Tel Esdar and Tell Deir 'Alia,19 and at one example from Joya in south- ern Lebanon.20 The origin of the type may be seen in Mycenean bowls with horizontal handles, still com- mon in the Mycenean IIIC1 phase on Cyprus.21 Sim- ilar horizontal handles appear in Cyprus on various bowls of the Cypro-Geometric period, and on bowls in the Black on Red I (III) technique.22 It thus can be argued that the addition of a horizontal handle to common rounded bowls of the Iron Age I is an Aegean element which may have arrived via Cyprus. This element can readily be related to traditions brought to this country by the "Sea Peoples". The fact that such handles were not found at hill-country sites underscores this conclusion. Similar handles appear also on bowls of Types 2 and 8 (see Sub-types 2a and 8a below). Degenerate horizontal handles are discussed below (p. 41). Sub-type BL lb.

Similar knob handles appear on various bowls of the Iron Age I and the 10th century B.C. in Israel.23 In his discussion of the material from Tell el-Fûl, Sin- clair claimed that such handles do not appear prior to the 10th century B.C., and used them as a chronologi- cal criterion for dating Fortress II (of Period II). Though most of the known examples are from the 10th century, the few examples from Tell Qasile, Megiddo, Gezer and Ashdod show that this type of handle began appearing in the 11th century B.C. Sub-type BL lc. Rounded bowls with bar handle (Photo 26). Stratum XI: Figs. 18:10; 24:6 (see also Type 2b, Fig. 18:18,20, 23, and Type BL 8c). Stratum X: Fig. 39:15. Fig. 24:6 is larger and flatter than the usual bowls of Type 1; it can be compared with Fig. 22:4 from the same locus and with Fig. 24:4. Fig. 18: 10 is decorated in black and red decoration. Fig. 39:15 has a pinched rim and flat, pressed, bar handle. Bar handles are known since the Late Bronze Age24 and appear on a small number of examples in the Iron Age I throughout Israel and Lebanon.25 The bar handle remains common during the Iron Age II. Sinclair argued that such handles did not appear prior to the 11th century B.C.,26 yet the examples from the Late Bronze Age, and from the tomb at Madaba, are earlier. This type of handle was rare, however, throughout the Iron Age I. The examples from Tell Qasile (including Sub-types BL 2b, BL 14a, Photo 26. Bowl Type BL lc (Fig. 39:15). Photo 27.

Stratum XI: Fig. 26:4. Stratum X: Fig. 45:5-8. Under Type BL 2 and its sub-types, we include a few bowls which are quite similar to Type BL 1, except for their rounded base. Rim sherds of such bowls are almost undistinguishable from those of Type BL 1. Fig. 26:4 is an exceptional form. The other three bowls, from a single locus in Stratum X, are red slipped and heavily burnished. Their base is slightly concave - almost an omphalos base. They are close to Type BL 15, discussed below. Parallels can be found at various Iron Age I sites,27 yet they are not exactly identical. The type continues from the late 11th century B.C. to the 10th century B.C. Sub-type BL 2a. The same as Type BL 2, but with horizontal handle (Photo 28). Stratum XI: Fig. 18:19. This bowl is red slipped and decorated with a black spiral and concentric circles. The single horizontal handle is similar to those on Type BL la. 24.

The four bowls of the last two sub-types were found in Temple 200, together with similar bowls classified as Type 15. They are small bowls (diameter 15 cm), with unburnished red slip and black decora- tion including concentric circles, spirals and short lines on the rim. In Fig. 18:18, the bar handle is pierced by a narrow suspension hole. These two sub-types are unparallelled. Type BL 3. Small offering bowl with rounded body (Photo 30). Stratum XII: Fig. 11:15-18. Stratum XI: Figs. 19:4-30; 22:8; 28:1-4. Stratum X: Figs. 33:25-27, 29-33. This group of small bowls (8-9 cm in diameter, 4-5 cm in height), usually has a flat or somewhat high, unworked base, bearing traces of string cut. Only a few examples have a ring base. The bowls lack any surface treatment. They were found in concentra- tions in the various temples, and thus may be regarded as offering vessels, produced specially for this function. The same is true of Type BL 10. A general discussion of such small offering bowls appears in Tell Qasile 1, pp. 117-118. Type BL 4. Deep rounded bowl Stratum XII: Fig. 11:12. Stratum XI: Fig. 27:1, 16 (?). This group includes several rounded bowls distin- guished by the relative deepness of the body. They lack slip or decoration. Type BL 5. Rounded bowl with grooved rim. Stratum XI: Fig. 22:2. Stratum X: Fig. 46:3. These are two fragments of rounded bowls with some shallow grooves on the outside of the rim. The two sherds are red slipped and burnished: the one from Stratum XI has a single line of burnishing (!), while that from Stratum X is well burnished on both inside and outside. This type is common in the South during the llth-lOth centuries B.C., as indicated by the finds at Ashdod Stratum X, Tel Shera4 Stratum VII, and tombs at Tell el-Far'ah (S), Lachish and Tel Masos.28 The examples from Tell Qasile are among the earliest in this series.

Stratum XI: Fig. 22:23, 25:5 Fig. 43:16 is a large rounded bowl with a rim slightly everted; Fig 45:11 is a single example of a large bowl (24 cm in diameter), with a rim folded out at a sharp angle. No parallels have been found. Compare also Figs. 16:11, 17, probably chalice rims. Type BL 7. Rounded bowl with thickened rim. Stratum X: Figs. 44:9; 45:12. Stratum IX: Fig. 52:2; 53:1-3. Stratum VIII: Fig. 55:5. The feature common to these otherwise differing fragments is a thickened, usually inverted rim. All are red slipped and burnished. The thickened rim appears only toward the end of the 1 1th century B.C. and continues to be common through the 10th cen- tury B.C. A similar phenomenon can be seen at Gezer, where such rims appear only from Stratum XI on.29 FAMILY C. CARINATED BOWLS Type BL 8. Carinated bowl with "cyma" profìle and simple rim (Photos 31-34). This is one of the most common bowl types, and can be divided into two sub-groups according to size. The first group includes bowls with a diameter of 15-25 cm: Stratum XII: Figs. 11:7-8; 12:9, 12, 14-19,21-22,24- 25, 28-29; 15:27-29; 16:2-4, 15-16.

Bowl Type BL 8 (Fig. 28:20). There are numerous variations in detail, yet the varia- tions are of no significance in establishing sub-types. At Tell Qasile the number of such bowls diminishes toward Stratum X. A clear development can be observed in the surface treatment: in Stratum XII, 13 out of 25 examples have a white slip (or wash), but neither red slip nor burnish. Many examples have a red stripe on the rim, and in seven cases there are black and red concentric circles on the white slip, in a technique very close to decorated Philistine pottery. In Stratum XI the white slip almost completely disap- pears, and the number of red slipped bowls increases. Some of these bowls are slightly burnished, and some are decorated with black concentric circles. Other bowls from this stratum, specially from Pit 125, are decorated with red or red and black bands on the plain body, with no slip. In Stratum X the red and black decoration still appears, yet most of the bowls are red slipped, and some are burnished and deco- rated with black decoration. Similar development can be observed in the bowls of Type 1. Table 4 summarizes the changes in decoration. Similar bowls begin appearing at the end of the Late Bronze Age, from the Valley of Jezreel south- ward,30 and become very popular throughout the Iron Age I throughout the country.31 They still Photo 34.

There are almost no exam- ples elsewhere of such bowls with red slip, and there are no parallels whatsoever for burnished bowls with black decoration. This phenomenon emphasizes the dominancy of this decoration technique at Tell Qasile during the 11th century B.C. Sub-type BL 8a. Carinated bowl with an horizontal handle. Stratum XII: Fig. 11:6. Stratum XI: Fig. 28:18-19. Sub-type BL 8a 1. The same, with depleted horizontal handle. Stratum X: Fig. 44:5. Sub-type 8a is similar to Sub-type BL la: a hori- zontal handle was added to a bowl of common type (see the discussion above, p. 36). The bowl in Fig. 11:6 is the earliest example of the appearance of red slip with a black decoration of concentric circles. It was found in Temple 319 of Stratum XII, and thus heralds the appearance of this new technique, so common in Strata XI-X. Fig. 44:5 is one of the few examples of a degenerate horizontal handle at Tell Qasile (see also Fig. 45:10). Similar bowls have been found on Iron Age I sites in Philistia and the inner Shephelah, mostly limited to the 11th century B.C.34 Similar degenerate handles, on other types of bowls, continue to appear during the 10th century B.C. in Philistia and the northern Negev.35 The rarity of this type of handle at Tell Qasile indicates a regional variation rather than a chronological development.36 Sub-type BL 8b.

This is in contrast to Gophna who claims that, since such handles do not appear at Tell Qasile Stratum X, they should not be assigned to the 11th century B.C. and appear only in the 10th century B.C.

Stratum X: Fig. 33:36-39. This is a group of small bowls (diameter not exceeding 20 cm), with two loop handles, resembling miniature kraters. All are red slipped, two of the examples in Stratum XI and one in Stratum X are hand burnished. Two of the bowls in Stratum XI have a black decoration of small lines on the rim and a "branch" motif on the handle. Fig. 22:26 has, in addition to the two loop handles, two vertical knob handles. The four bowls in Fig. 33, all from Locus 188, are of uniform size and appearance (diameter 13 cm). There are few parallels elsewhere: one bowl from Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum B2 and a bowl from Ash- dod Stratum XII.40 Photo 36. Bowl Type BL 9 (Fig. 33:38). Type BL 10.

Stratum X: Figs. 33:20, 28 (miniature); 43:15. All these bowls are deeper than those of Type 8, and have carinated body and almost vertical rim. Yet the group is not homogeneous, and displays differen- ces in details. Some examples are close to the bell- shaped Philistine bowls (cf. Fig. 43:15), and could be regarded as their variants. Two of the bowls have a red stripe on the rim, and one is red slipped. Parallels have been found at Megiddo Stratum VI, Tell el- Far'ah (S) (Cemeteries 500, 600 and 200), and Beer- Sheba Stratum VIII- VII.41 Type BL 12. Thin carinated bowl with thickened rim. Stratum XI: Figs. 19:38; 22:19, 22. Stratum X: Figs. 44:19, 20. This is a small group of fragments of thin carinated bowls, more delicate than the other types. Their diameter is 15-20 cm, and in most cases the rim is slightly thickened, sometimes bearing a red stripe on the outside, but no other decoration or slip. There are almost no parallels to this type, besides a few bowls from Tell Deir 'Alia.42 Type BL 13. Carinated bowl with three loop-feet. Stratum X: Fig. 40:2. This is a complete carinated bowl (from Temple 131), having three loop-"handles" attached to the base. A similar bowl was found in Area A at Tell Qasile.43 A similar bowl from Megiddo Stratum VI is decorated with a rich red and black decoration, recalling Philistine decoration.44 The concept of sim- ilar "loop-feet" appears at the end of the Late Bronze Age (though in an obscure context) at Tell el-Far'ah (N), during the Iron Age I at Gezer, Beth-Shan Stra- tum VI, Tell el-Far'ah (S) and Tel Masos, and in a 10th century B.C. tomb at Lachish.45 A similar fea- ture can be seen at Hama (Period II of the cremation cemetery) and on Cyprus, during the Cypro- Geometric period.46 40.

Flat carinated bowl with thickened or everted rim. Stratum XII: Figs. 11:9; 12:11, 13. The sharp carination and vertical upper part of the body characterize these otherwise varied bowls from Stratum XII. Fig. 11:9 is a large bowl, decorated inside with black and red concentric circles on a white slip. A similar decoration appears on Fig. 12:13, which has a slightly different rim. These bowls are rare during the Iron Age I. A parallel for the shape of Fig. 11:9 was found at Megiddo Stratum VB and Tel Masos Stratum III,47 while Fig. 12: 13 has a parallel at Afula Stratum IIIA.48 Sub-type BL 14a. As Type 14, with bar handle. Stratum XII: Figs. 12:10; 16:6. The complete bowl in Fig. 16:6 lacks slip and deco- ration. It is similar to Type 14 except for the bar handle, formed of three knobs. The fragment Fig. 12:10 is probably of a similar bowl. Type 14 has been found only in Stratum XII and should be regarded as characteristic of that phase. Type BL 15. Flat dish with carinated body. Stratum XI: Fig. 18:21. Stratum X: Fig. 33:34. Sub-type BL 15a. As Type 15, with bar handle (Photo 38). Stratum XI: Figs. 18:22; 29:9. Stratum X: Fig. 33:35. This is a group of small, flat dishes, 13-14 cm in diameter and of 2.5 cm maximal height. They have an angular body, vertical sides, and a slightly protruding rim outside; the base is flat or slightly concave. In one case there is a shallow ring base. All have red slip; an example from Stratum XI and one from Stratum X are burnished. Most bear a black decoration which includes small lines on the rim and on the bar handle and, in one case (Stratum XI), concentric circles. The type recalls bowls of Types 2 and 2a. Similar bowls, decorated with a lotus pattern, are defined by T. Dothan as Type 13 of the Philistine ware; she notes the relation between these bowls and ivory bowls from the Megiddo treasure.49 Photo 38. Bowl Type BL 15 (Fig. 33:35). FAMILY E. Type BL 16.

The four bowls from Stratum XI were found in Pit 125 and Temple 200. They are of buff clay, similar to the local clay from which other bowls and vessels at Tell Qasile were made, and they are similarly fired. Neutron-activation analysis has also shown that they were made locally (see p. 113). The diameter of these bowls is 12-17 cm, and they are 6 cm in height. The body is slightly rounded with a flat base; the simple rim is decorated on the outside with a red band with a row of punctures below, made with a sharp tool. Sub-type BL 18a.

They are 10 cm in diameter and 5.5 cm in height; the base is flat, the rim simple, and the decoration similar to that of the bowls. The single preserved handle is painted red. These bowls and cups have no parallels elsewhere. They were probably produced locally, during the span of Stratum XI, as offering vessels for use in the tem- ple. The single cup from Locus 188 - the repository of Temple 131 - may have originated in Stratum XI. An exception: Fig. 34: 12 (Stratum X, Locus 188). This is a unique, hand-made bowl, 8 cm in diameter and 3.5 cm in height. The rim is emphasized by a slight groove on the outside. The base is flat. It is of black clay, and the body is decorated with a series of vertical grooves on the outside. These two features are unparallelled anywhere in this country during the Iron Age I and are foreign to the local ware at Tell Qasile. The bowl may have been imported, but no close parallels have been noted abroad. There is a possible relation to a group of small, black incised bowls from Cyprus, which appears during the Late Cypriot III period and at the beginning of the Cypro-Geometric period, which some scholars seek to associate with contemporaneous hand-made pot- tery in Greece.51 The tree motif (Photo 42) In addition to the decorative elements of stripes, concentric circles and spirals which appear on var- ious types of bowls, we should mention a small body fragment of a bowl from Stratum XII (Fig. 15:17), decorated with a tree motif painted in black and red, in addition to concentric circles. This is an important addition to the meagre corpus of bowls bearing the continuation of the tree motif throughout the 12th century B.C.52 Summary The bowls - about 50% of the total pottery corpus in Area C - are divided into 18 types and several sub-types, yet most are of Types 1 and 8 and their 51.

Bowl with "tree" motif (Fig. 15:17). variations. A few shapes appear only in specific strata. Thus, Type 14 appears only in Stratum XII, and there are a few shapes which are characteristic solely to Strata XI-X, as can be seen in the distribu- tion table on p. 106. Some of the shapes (Types 2b, 4, 6, 18) are unique to Tell Qasile. The main chronological development, from Stratum XII to Stratum X, is in decoration technique, rather than in form. In the two main types ( 1 and 8) there is a transition from red and black (or just red) decoration on a white slip to a red slip (Stratum XI) and a burnished red slip (Stratum X). This transition is not sharp: already in Stratum XII we can see a few examples of red slip, while in Stratum XI there are still some white slipped bowls and already some hand burnished bowls on a red slip. This is a slow yet consistent development. The tech- nique of black decoration on a red slip, or on a burnished red slip, is most characteristic of Strata XI-X. The gradual appearance of a red slip, and of hand burnishing and black decoration on a red slip, throughout the 12th-l 1th centuries B.C. at Tell Qasile is an important contribution to the develop- ment of pottery decoration during the Iron Age I. This is a regional development, for in the northern part of the country red slip and hand burnishing appear regularly only from the beginning of the 10th century B.C. on (Hazor Stratum X, Beth-Shan Stra- tum V, Megiddo Stratum VB, Taanach Stratum IIA). Of the scores of bowls from Megiddo Stratum VI, only four are burnished - on the buff clay with no red slip. Even at Gezer, the best stratigraphically excavated site in the northern Shephelah, the red slip first begins to appear only in Stratum XI (end of 1 1th century B.C.), while irregular burnishing appears only in Stratum VIII, of the 10th century B.C. It thus would seem that the appearance of the red slip and burnishing at Tell Qasile is a local development, char- acterizing the region of northern Philistia during the Iron Age I (see also the discussion on pp. 83, below). B. KRATERS The kraters are divided into four types, some of which are further divided into sub-types. Type KR 1. Carinated krater with two loop handles. Stratum XII: Figs. 14:2, 5; 15:26; 16:8; 17:1, 17. Stratum XI. Figs. 24:15-16; 27:7-9; 29:24-26. Stratum X: Figs. 40:3-4; 46:12-14; 47:3. Stratum IX: Fig. 53:4, 6, 13, 14. Stratum VIII: Fig. 54:14. Sub-type KR la. As type KR 1, with horizontal handles. Stratum XI: Figs. 22:29; 29:23. Variation: Fig. 40:6 (Stratum X), with vertical knob handle. Sub-type KR lb. Krater of the former two types , but with painted spirals (Photos 43-45). Stratum X: Figs. 40:7; 46:9; 8, 11; 47:1 (Type 18 of the Philistine pottery). These kraters have a carinated body; the wall above the carination is vertical or slightly inverted, while the rim is either everted or flanged, and flat on top. Occasionally the rim is oblique. There are many variations in shape, and there are almost no two identical rim fragments. Thus, the definition of this type is very general, and it was found useless to develop a further typological division of the group. The surface treatment of these kraters develops in a manner similar to that of the bowls. In Stratum XII all the fragments are undecorated, except one, which has a white slip, and another, which, has a red decora- tion on the rim. In Stratum XI most of the kraters lack decoration, yet two fragments from Pit 125 (Figs. 29:24-25) are decorated with vertical black lines, painted on the body (without slip), and one fragment (Fig. 27:8) has a red slip and a red band painted along the rim. In Stratum X there is a group of complete or almost complete kraters decorated with black spirals on a red slip (Type lb) or a bur- nished red slip, as well as fragments of similar kraters without the spiral decoration. The kraters with the spiral decoration were defined by T. Dothan as Type 18 of the Philistine pottery, one of the two types which comprise the third phase of the Philistine pot- tery, according to her classification (see below, p. 45</page><page sequence="52">Photo 43. Krater Type IB (Fig. 40:7). Photo 44. Krater Type 1B (Fig. 46:11). Photo 45. Krater Type 1B (Fig. 46:8). 105). 53 Here we include this group of Stratum X deco- rated kraters as a sub-type of the larger group with similar profile, which appears in all the Iron Age I strata at Tell Qasile. The origin of the type and its place in the development of Philistine pottery have already been discussed by T. Dothan. Among the decorated kraters, we may note Fig. 40:7, a complete example found in the temple of Stratum X. It has two loop handles and two horizon- tal handles, arid is decorated with eight spirals painted in black &lt;Wer an uneven red slip. The handles are decorated wit^ small black lines and there is an obscure black decoration below the handles. A similar fragmentary krater from Building 225 appears in Fig. 46:9.' Two other kraters from the same building (one complete and another fragmentary) have only two loop jhandles; Fig. 46:8 has black "tri- glyphs" between the spirals. In a small probe exca- vated in 1971, at the eastern end of Area A, we found a fragment of a similar krater decorated with a human figure in a very simple, schematic style, in addition to spirals and a ladder pattern.54 Similar kraters were found in Area A at Tell Qasile, as have been discussed in detail by T. Dothan; they are char- acteristic of Tell Qasile, with no close parallels else- where, except for fragments from close-by Tell Jerisheh, which may have originated in the same workshop. Even at major sites in Philistia, such as Ashdod and Tel Shera', such decorated kraters are lacking. Dothan has noted the similarity to a krater from Megiddo Stratum VI, yet it is not identical to the Tell Qasile examples and was probably made in a northern production centre, perhaps at Megiddo itself. Isolated spirals appear also on bell-shaped kraters (see below, pp. 92 and Fig. 46:6). The black spiral decoration on kraters of Types 1 and la is thus a local development in the pottery workshop at Tell Qasile, Stratum X. Type 1 a is defined mainly on the basis of Fig. 46: 10, a complete krater with two horizontal handles at- tached to the body. The vessel is red slipped and there is black decoration on the rim. The other fragments are either of similar kraters or of kraters of Type lb. Kraters with similar profiles appear from the 13th century B.C. on,55 and are very common in Iron Age I sites throughout the country (Megiddo Strata VIIA- VIA; Beth Shan Stratum VI; Tel Keisan Strata 1 l-9c; Gezer Strata XIII-IX; Tel Masos I-III, and many other sites).56 At Gezer, such kraters appear with a red slip in Stratum XI; red slip and hand burnishing appear on a krater from Ashdod Stratum XII (12th century B.C.) and on kraters from Stratum III at 53.

This is indicative of the appearance of the red slip and bur- nishing in Philistia and the inner Shephelah already by the beginning of the 1 1th century B.C., while in the northern part of the country this technique was not yet known. No development could be observed in the morphology of these kraters, the only development being in the decoration. The group of kraters from Stratum X, with spiral decoration on a red slip (Type lb), is a hallmark of this stratum. Type KR 2. Bell-shaped krater. See Type 2 of the Philistine decorated pottery (below pp. 90-92. Type KR 3. Krater with cannateci body and simple vertical rim. Stratum XII: Figs. 14:3; 17:15. Stratum XI: Figs. 25:15; 26:19. Stratum X: Figs. 44:10; 50:15 (cooking pot?). Exceptional: Fig. 22:24. This group of fragmentary kraters, without slip or decoration, is characterized by the carinated body, the inward tapering siioulder and the simple vertical rim. Fig 22:24 has three knob handles and an excep- tionally high carination. Parallels can be found in the northern part of the country: Megiddo Strata VIIA-VB; Beth-Shan Stra- tum VI, Taanach Period II, Tell Keisan Stratum 9a and one of the cist tombs at Tel Zeror.57 Sub-type KR 3a. As Type 3, with a thickened rim. Stratum XI: Fig. 27:10 (cooking pot?). Stratum X: Figs. 44:29; 45:21; 47:4. These kraters are similar to the previous types, but the rim is thickened and rounded, formed by folding its upper edge outward. The average diameter is 24- 26 cm; there is no slip or decoration. This variant is also parallelled only in the northern part of the country: Megiddo Strata VIIA-V; Beth- Shan Stratum VI; Afula Strata IIIA-B; Taanach Period I (12th century B.C., where it is common); Tell Keisan Strata 11-9 and in a tomb at Geba on the Carmel, no earlier than the 10th century B.C.58 The popularity of this type at Megiddo and Taanach indi- cates its northern origin, yet it is impossible to deter- mine whether the examples from Tell Qasile were imported from the north. Type KR 4. Krater with rounded thickened rim. Stratum IX: Fig. 52:22; 53:7-12, 16 (?). Stratum VIII: Fig. 54:8-13; 55: 6-7. These kraters are the hallmark of Strata IX- VIII, the main criterion for defining the pottery of these strata. Only fragments of such kraters were found in Area C, yet complete examples from Area A and parallels at other sites show that they are deeper than the kraters of Type 1, with carinated body, vertical or slightly inverted upper part, and two loop handles. There are many variations, and it is almost impossi- ble to find two identical rims. Most of the examples are covered with a thick, dark red slip which differs from the thin, uneven slip characteristic of Strata XI-X. The irregular hand burnishing is more dense and intensive than that of Stratum X. No black deco- ration appears on these kraters. There are few published parallels to these kraters: at Megiddo (only one fragment, attributed to Strata I-IV), Taanach Period IIA (an unsure parallel), Gezer Strata VIII and VII, Lachish Stratum V, Beth- Shemesh Stratum IIa, Ashdod Stratum X, Tel Esdar Stratum II, Beer-Sheba Stratum IX(!) and Arad Stra- tum 12. 59 The rarity of this type precludes judgment as to its history. The example from Gezer might raise the possibility that such kraters began appearing already in the 11th century B.C., yet there is no confirmation of this at Tell Qasile, where the type is not found prior to Stratum IX.

Krater (Exceptional) (Fig. 47:2). decorated with red and black bands (a black line between two red lines at the centre of the body and a red line below the rim). It resembles the bell-shaped kraters (see discussion, p. 92), yet in fact it is excep- tional in both shape and decoration. Fig. 47:2 (Stratum X; Photo 46). A krater with a profile reminiscent of a cooking pot. It is covered with a white slip (wash?) and decorated with a net pattern in red. The white slip does not reach the rim, ending slightly below the net pattern. There are no parallels to this form. Fig. 54:2 (Stratum IX). A fragment of a krater rim, with a thick, hand burnished red slip. The compli- cated profile of the rim is unparallelled, though in general the shape may be seen as a variant of Type KR 4. Summary. This group of krater fragments well represents the development of this vessel through the Iron Age I and 10th century B.C. Types 1 and 2 are characteristic of the 12th-l 1th centuries B.C. Almost no inner development could be observed throughout this period. A red slip appears on kraters of Type 1 during the 1 1th century B.C., and hand burnishing is added toward the end of this century (Stratum X). Kraters of Type 3 are relatively rare, and appear mostly in the northern part of the country. During the 10th century B.C. (Stratum IX), kraters of Type 1, dominant during the previous strata, are almost totally replaced by kraters of Type 4, while Type 3a continues in use. Multiple handled kraters, character- istic of various sites during the Iron Age I, do not appear at Tell Qasile. C. CHALICES Type CH 1. Chalice with inverted rim. Stratum XI: Figs. 14:6; 27:19. Stratum XI-X: Fig. 32:6. These three chalices have an inverted, sharp rim. The diameter of the bowl is 12-17 cm. Fig. 32:6 has a simple trumpet foot, while on Fig. 27:19 the foot is stepped. The latter chalice has a red band decorating the rim and the rim of the foot. The type originates in the Late Bronze Age.60 Sim- ilar, yet not identical chalices appear at various Iron Age I sites (Megiddo Strata VIIA-VI, Afula Stratum IIIA, Khirbet Tuleil (in Upper Galilee), Tel Eitun, Beth-Shemesh and Tell Deir-'Alla),61 as well as in southern Lebanon (Joya).62 This rim type, however, appears on a minority of Iron Age I chalices, and disappears during the 10th century B.C. Type CH 2. Chalice with carinated, flaring rim (Photos 47-48). Stratum XI: Figs. 24:18; 26:9. Stratum XI-X (Shrine 300): Fig. 32:4-5. Stratum X: Figs. 40:8-9; 43:22; 47:9. Stratum IX: Fig. 52:15.

The diameter of the bowls is 1 5- 19 cm, except Fig. 40:9, from Temple 131, which is 39 cm in diameter, and which was probably a ritual vessel. The rim is carinated, flaring and usually turns obliquely upward (Figs. 24:18; 26:9; 52:15), though sometimes it is everted horizontally, creating a ledge rim ("splayed rim") (Figs. 32:5; 40:8; 47:9). The foot is usually stepped, though sometimes it is plain (Figs. 40:8; 47:9).The chalices from Stratum XI have a shallow bowl and the rim is turned upward, while the examples from Shrine 300 and from Stra- tum X have a deeper bowl and sharply everted rim. In Stratum IX, the bowl becomes even deeper. This may signify a chronological development, though the examples are too few to be certain. Most of the chalices are undecorated, yet some bear a red band on the rim (Figs. 15:31; 24: 18; 32:5) or the rim is painted entirely on its upper part (Figs. 40:8; 43:22). In Fig. 40:8 the rim is decorated with small black lines on the red background. The foot fragment Fig. 30:1 is red slipped. Among the undefined sherds, Fig. 14:11 is proba- bly part of a chalice or bowl of unusual type. Figs. 16:11, 17 and 17:10 are probably also parts of chali- ces, though smaller than usual. Fragment Fig. 40:10 from Temple 131, is probably the foot of a large chalice or some other large cult vessel. It is ridged horizontally its full height. Chalices of Type 2 were found at Area A at Tell Qasile, in both Stratum X and Stratum IX.63 They have been found throughout the country in contexts of both the 11th and the 10th centuries B.C., as at Megiddo Strata VI-IVB-VA; Taanach Period IIA-B; Beth-Shan Strata VI-Lower V; Tel Amai Stratum III; Tell Keisan Stratum 9c; Tell el-Far'ah (N) Stratum III; Tel Zeror Tomb I; Beth-Shemesh Strata III-IIa; Gezer Tomb 58; Lachish Stratum V and 10th century B.C. tombs there; Tell Esdar Stratum III; Tel Masos Stratum II and Tell Deir-'Alla.64 Similar chalices only rarely appear after the 10th century B.C.: at Ashdod Stratum VIII, Tell Keisan Stratum 8 and Beth- Shemesh Stratum He.65 Outside Palestine similar chalices have been found in Lebanon (very similar to our Fig. 43:22) and in Cyprus (Cypro-Geometric II).66 D. GOBLETS (Photos 49-52) Stratum XII: Fig. 11:22. Stratum XI: Figs. 19:43; 30:2. Stratum XI-X (Shrine 300): Fig. 32:7-11. Stratum X: Figs. 34:16; 40:13-14. Base fragments: Figs. 14:7-8; 23:5-7; 34:17: 40:12(7); 44: 8, 30. These vessels have a high trumpet foot, sometimes stepped, like chalice bases. The body is hemispherical (in two cases the body is carinated). The high neck ends in a flaring rim, usually plain but in one example (Fig. 32:9) moulded. Some examples have a ridge on the neck (like Fig. 32:8). Four goblets (from Strata XI-X) are covered with an unburnished red slip (Figs. 19:43; 32:8; 34:16; 40:14). One of these (Fig. 40:14) has a decoration of black horizontal bands on the red slip. Other goblets are decorated with horizontal red or red and black bands (Fig. 1 1:22 from Stratum XII and Fig. 32:10 from Stratum XI; see also the frag- ments, Figs. 14:7-8; 23:6-7). In one case there are "triglyphs" in Late Bronze Age tradition, as appears also on Philistine pottery (Fig. 32:9), while one goblet from Shrine 300 (Fig. 32:7) bears a pure Philistine decoration including the bird motif (see p. 101 below). 63.

Goblet (Fig. 34:16). Photo 51. Goblet (Fig. 40:14).</page><page sequence="57">Photo 52. Goblet (Fig. 40:13). Three base fragments, probably of similar goblets, are decorated with a row of triangles (degenerate lotus motif), a clear Philistine motif (see p. 101 below). A similar goblet, decorated with bands, was attrib- uted in the first seasons to Stratum VII, which was dated to the 8th century B.C.67 This goblet was found in the small cells above Building L - which should be dated either to a late phase of this building or to a phase later than the building itself. This would be parallel to our Strata IX-VIII, dated to the 10th century B.C. Yet even such a date seems too late for this vessel, (see also p. 57 below). The prototype of these goblets appears during the 13th century B.C.68 While the Late Bronze Age goblets have low necks, the Iron Age I ones have a tall, narrow neck. Examples are known from Beth- Shan Stratum VI, Megiddo Strata VIIA (on the floor of Temple 2048), VIB-VIA, and (one example) VB; Taanach Period I (12th century B.C.), Beth-Shemesh Stratum III and Ashdod Strata XII-X.69 Most of the known examples are from Megiddo, while at other sites there are only isolated examples. At Megiddo and the other sites, as at Tell Qasile, there is no uniformity in the shape of these vessels: each example has its own characteristics. The Megiddo goblets, like those from Tell Qasile, are variously decorated: one example from Stratum VIB has a burnished red slip; others are decorated with painted bands or bands and metopes (cf. Fig. 32:9). One example from Taanach is decorated with red bands, while one from Beth-Shan has a series of painted triangles. The goblet with high neck thus became a common shape during the 12th-l 1th centuries B.C. in the Val- ley of Jezreel and in Philistia. In three cases (Megiddo, Beth-Shan and Tell Qasile) these vessels were found in cultic contexts, and thus it may be assumed that their main use was in a cultic context, as it had been during the 13th century B.C. The addition of Philistine decoration to such goblets at Tell Qasile is of significance for the understanding of the mecha- nism of local Philistine pottery production (see below, pp. 104-105). E. COOKING POTS Cooking pots were not among the large groups of vessels in the various temples; this is understandable, for cooking pots were not used as offering vessels in the temples. On the other hand, many fragments of cooking pots were found in the temple courtyards, evidence of the cooking activities which took place there, in connection with the sacrifices. Only two complete cooking pots were restored: one from Room 261 (from Stratum XI or X; Fig. 25: 13) and the other from Building 225 (Fig. 47:5). All the cooking pot sherds are made of characteristic ware: dark brown clay with many white lime inclusions, with dark grey or black core. The cooking pots from Tell Qasile can be divided into two main types; the first type can be further divided into four sub-types. One single example represents a third type. 67. Mazar (1951), p. 199, Fig. 10: a and p. 131, Fig. 5: 2 (called a "jar" though it is part of a similar goblet). Amiran (1969), PI. 68: 22, included this goblet in the Iron Age IIC pottery plates, but such goblets should be dated no later than the 10th century B.C. See Rast's remark, in Taanach , p. 14, and our remarks concerning the date of "Stratum VII" in Area A in Tell Qasile 1, pp. 10-11. 68. Hazor II, Pl. CXVIII: 26-29; Hazor III-IV, Pl.

Cooking pot with shallow , carinated body and inverted rim. Type CP la. As Type CP 1, with triangular, short and straight rim. Stratum XII: Figs. 11:20; 14:9, 10, 16-20; 17:26. Stratum XI: Figs. 25:14, 16; 27:12, 20. Stratum X: Figs. 44:27; 47:8. The short, triangular rim, which appears in several variations, continues the Late Bronze Age tradition of cooking pots, as well as some of the Iron Age IA cooking pots (as prominent at Taanach Period IA, Giloh and other sites).70 But whereas the rims of the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age IA are everted, most of our rims are inverted (for an exception, cf., e.g., Fig. 25: 16). They are the link between the traditional Late Bronze Age cooking pot rim and our Type lb, which is the most common during the Iron Age I. The rim in Fig. 14:26 (Stratum XII) is transitional between Type CP la and Type CP lb. The type is most common in Stratum XII and becomes less frequent in the following strata. The sherds from Strata IX-VIII and even Stratum X may be stray, for they are quite small and come from open areas. A similar development was observed at Gezer, where the short triangular rim appears down to Stra- tum XII, and then disappears.71 Other parallels to our type can be found in various Iron Age I contexts, mostly in strata dated to the 12th or early 11th cen- tury B.C. (Hazor Stratum XII; Beth-Shan Stratum VI; Afula Stratum HIB; Tell Keisan Strata 9c- 10- 11; Shiloh; Ai; Tell el-Fûl Periods I-II; Tell en-Nasbeh; Giloh; Gezer Strata XIV-XII; Beth-Shemesh Stra- tum III; Ashdod Stratum XII and Tel Masos Stratum III.72 This type of cooking pot is handleless. Type CP lb. As Type CP 1 , with elongated concave rim. Stratum XII: Figs. 14:12, 14, 15, 21; 16:12. Stratum XI: Figs. 23:8-15; 24:17; 25:12-13; 27:14. Stratum X: Figs. 40:15-17; 43:18; 44:1 1-13, 25;45:14; 47:5-7. Stratum IX: Fig. 53:19, 21, 22. Stratum VIII: Fig. 54:16, 18-22. Variants: Fig. 54:1, 3. The common feature of this type of cooking pot is an elongated rim (about 1-1.5 cm long), concave at its upper part. The lower part of the rim is usually sharp, and below is a groove. There are several variations of this type, the most common throughout Strata XI- VIII. Some examples are close to Type la, and it is sometimes impossible to distinguish sharply between the two. Some of the rims in this group continue the line of the body, while on others there is an angle between rim and body. The most characteristic exam- ples are the complete cooking pots in Figs. 25:13 and 47:5. The variants appear in all the strata, and there is no possibility of establishing an inner chronological development. Parallels for this type are common in all Iron Age I and 10th century and even 9th century B.C. contexts throughout the country. Examples can be found at Hazor Strata XII-VIII (though in Strata IX-VIII there is a sharper carination of the body), Khirbet Tuleil in Upper Galilee; Megiddo Strata VI-IVB-VA, and probably also IVA; Taanach Periods IB and IIA-B, Beth-Shan Strata VI-V, Afula Strata IIIA-B; Tel Amai Stratum IV; Tell Keisan Strata ll-9a; Samaria Phases I-VI (!); Ai; Gezer Strata XIII-XII; Beth-Shemesh Strata III-IIA and early Stratum IIB; Ashdod Pit 2001 (Philistine pit in Area C); Beer- Sheba Strata IX- VII; Tell Deir-'Alla.73 The type also appears in Lebanon.74 The long range of this type, almost 250 years, was emphasized in the excavation reports of Beth-Shemesh, Samaria, Hazor and Taa- nach. Franken claims that the type appears at Tell Deir-'Alla at the end of the Late Bronze Age and characterizes the early phases of pits, dated to the 12th century B.C. Thus he claims that the type made its first appearance in Transjordan. But prior to the publication of the Late Bronze material from Tell Deir-'Alla, it is impossible to accept this claim. At the other sites the type appears only from the second half of the 12th century B.C. on, and even then it is rare. 70. For these, see Taanach , pp. 13-14, Figs. 2; 14: 1 1; A.

During the 1 1th- 10th centuries B.C. it became the dominant type of cooking pot. In the early 9th cen- tury B.C. the type still appears, though largely replaced by new types, with shorter rims. It is almost impossible to follów an inner chrono- logical development of this type. The variations of the type appear within a single stratum, as can be seen at Tell Qasile. The main criterion for a chronological development is the appearance of handles, which are almost completely absent prior to the 10th century B.C. At Tell Qasile there are no examples of handles on cooking pots prior to Stratum IX (see further below). The height of the rim may also be an indica- tion for chronological development: the rim is rather short in Strata XII-XI and becomes taller in Strata X-IX, though the details of the profile remain unchanged. Type CP lc. Cooking pot with inverted, elongated flat or grooved rim. Stratum XII: Fig. 14:25. Stratum X: Figs. 44:24, 26, 28; 45:20, 22. Stratum IX: Fig. 53:20. The common feature of this group is the thickened rim, which continues the line of the upper part of the body. The rims included in this group vary in shape, though all of them are thickened and are either flat or slightly grooved on the outside. There are few paral- lels for such rims at Iron Age I sites, in the northern part of the country (Megiddo Stratum VI; Beth-Shan Stratum VI).75 Type CP Ici. As Type CP lc, with handles. Stratum IX: Fig. 52:3-4. As mentioned above, there are no examples of cooking pots with handles in Strata XII-X at Tell Qasile. This contradicts the finds at other Iron Age I sites, where there are some examples of handles already during the 1 1th century B.C. (Beth-Shemesh Stratum III; Tel Esdar Stratum III; Tel Masos Stra- tum II; Tell Deir-'Alla Phase C on; Gezer Strata XIII-X; Megiddo Stratum VIA; Tell Keisan Stratum 9c; Tell el-Fûl Period II, and Ai).76 Thus, the lack of handles on cooking pots at Tell Qasile Strata XI-X may have been either accidental or a local pheno- menon. The two cooking pot rims with handles from Stratum IX are variants of Type lc. Parallels for Fig. 52:4 are known from Tel Esdar Stratum III and Tell el-Fara'h (N) Stratum III.77 The fragment in Fig. 54: 17 has a short concave rim, rounded body and two handles. The stratigraphie attribution of this fragment is not certain: it could be attributed to "Stratum VII", like similar rims from that stratum. Type CP Id. Cooking pot with rounded, convex rim. Stratum XII: Figs. 14:23, 24; 15:30, 31. Stratum XI: Fig. 27:13. Stratum IX: Fig. 53:15, 17, 18. These fragments are another variant of the open, shallow cooking pot, with a slightly convex rim. A few parallels can be found at Iron Age I sites.78 Type CP 2. Deep cooking pot with rounded, inverted rim. Stratum XII: Fig. 17:14, 16, 22. Stratum XI: Fig. 26:11. Stratum VIII: Fig. 55:8 (shallow). The best example of this type is Fig. 26:1 1: a deep cooking pot with rather narrow neck (narrower than the widest part of the body), rounded rim and two handles. The type is rare: a contemporaneous exam- ple was found at Taanach Period IIA (12th century B.C.); most other examples are from llth-early 10th centuries B.C.

The open, shallow cooking pots with short, inverted triangular rim (Type la) characterize Stratum XII, together with the deep pots with han- dles (Type 2) which appear in the same stratum. In Stratum XI the shallow cooking pot appears with concave, elongated rim (Type lb), which continues as the most common type until Stratum VIII. Type 2, however, continues to appear in Stratum XI. In Stra- tum X, Type lb becomes dominant, and several of its variants appear as well (Type lc). Type 2 disappears in this stratum. In Stratum IX a new variant, Type Id, appears together with Type lb, which is still the dominant type. Handles appear for the first time, on variants of Type lb (Type lcl). The long, straight rim, which characterizes 10th century B.C. strata in the north (such as Megiddo Strata IVB-VA), is almost entirely absent at Tell Qasile. F. STORAGE JARS Most of the storage jars at Tell Qasile were discovered in storage rooms of Stratum X, with only a few examples from earlier strata. Most of them are of a single main type (Type 1), with only a few of other types. There are also two imported Egyptian storage jars. Type SJ 1 (Photos 53-55). Stratum XI: Figs, 26:13; 30:3-4. Stratum X: Figs. 34:18-19; 41:2-3; 43:19-21; 47:10; 48:2-8, 10-15. (22 additional similar complete jars and 35 bases of such jars were found in Room 168 in addition to those shown in Fig. 48.) Stratum IX: Figs. 52:9-14; 54:4. Stratum VIII: Fig. 54:23. Pierced bases of similar jars: Fig. 41:5; 44:31 (Stratum X). The characteristic jar of this type is 50-55 cm high, 24-27 cm wide (in the shoulder), and has a capacity of 13-20 litres. It has an elongated egg-shaped body, the inclined shoulder is rounded yet slightly emphasized by a light carination, the short vertical neck ends in a simple, rounded rim, which in a few cases is slightly thickened and in other cases is cut diagonally (as in Fig. 41:3). The rounded loop handles have an oval section and lack any ridges. The base is usually rounded; in some cases it can be seen that the base was made separately on the wheel and added to the body. The jars are made of light brown clay, and usually have a grey core in section. Dçzens of these jars were found in the storerooms of Tell Qasile Stratum X in both Area A and Area C (Building 225, Room 168). Yet they started their appearance in Stratum XI and continued to be common in Stratum IX, where they were found in both Area A81 and Area C (Loci 270, 123, in which mainly bases of such jars were preserved). In Room 168 of Building 225 were found 35 restorable jars as well as fragments of additional jars, among which 35 bases were counted. Many of these jars were arranged along the southern wall of the room (see Fig. 10 and Tell Qasile 1, PI. 26:1-2), while the others were found smashed in a heap almost 1 m high. The jars were probably arranged on shelves along the southern part of the room. Many fragments of similar jars were found in the various loci of Strata XI-IX. Most of them have not been included in the pottery Figures, though they are mentioned in the catalogue (p. 133). Similar jars are common in 11th century B.C. contexts in the central and southern parts of the country. Typical examples can be found at Shiloh, Gibeon, Beth-Shemesh Strata III and IIA; Tel Sippor Stratum I; Tell Eitun; Ashdod Stratum X; Tell el- Faťah (S) (Cemeteries 500, 600 and 200), Tel Esdar Stratum III and Tel Masos Strata I-II.82 Jars of this type are rather rare in the northern part of the country, specially at such sites as Megiddo, Taanach and Beth-Shan, where an oval form with ridged neck and moulded rim is the most common shape. A varia- tion of our jar type, with an emphasized base, is common at such Phoenician sites as Tell Keisan and Tyre, from the 12th-l 1th centuries B.C. until the 9th century B.C.83 Several jars of this type reached Cyprus and were found at Enkomi.84 81. Mazar (1951), p. 139, Fig. 8 (Stratum IX); PI. 35: A (Stratum VII, wrongly attributed to the 8th century B.C; these two jars should be attributed to Strata IX-VIII, 10th century B.C). 82.

Storage jar Type SJ 1 (Fig. 34:18). 55</page><page sequence="62">The inner development of this type is difficult to follow, though an early stage in its development can possibly be seen in Fig. 26: 13 (from Stratum XI), ajar with an everted rim, recalling Late Bronze Age tradi- tions. A similar jar was found at Ashdod Stratum XIII (early 12th century B.C.).85 The latest appear- ance of Type 1 jars is at Beth-Shemesh Stratum IIA, parallel to Stratum IX at Tell Qasile (first half of 10th century B.C.). The fact that these jars appear in both Strata IX and VIII at Tell Qasile, with no other new types appearing in these strata, is an indication of early traditions in these strata; even the 10th century B.C. as a whole, ascribed to these two strata, would seem to be too late, in considering these jars. It thus seems that at Tell Qasile this type continued to exist longer than at any other site. Type SJ 2. Jar with four handles and a stump base. Stratum XI or XII: Fig. 26:14. The general shape of this jar recalls Type 1, yet it has a wider body, four loop handles and a thickened base with triangular section, recalling Late Bronze Age storage jars. The neck and rim of our single example are not preserved. The stratigraphie location of this jar would attribute it to either Stratum XII or XI. Its base is on the Stratum XII floor, while its upper part is at the Stratum XI floor level. Either it had been sunk below the Stratum XI floor level, or its upper part was cut away by the builders of Stratum XI and thus it should be attributed to Stratum XII. Some similar jars are known from 12th and early 1 1th century B.C. contexts in Philistia and the inner She- phelah, as at Beth-Shemesh, Tel Eitun, Ashdod Stra- tum XIII, and a tomb at Nitsanim.86 This jar is a clear indication of the continuation of Canaanite tradition in Philistia, disappearing during the 11th century B.C. Type S J 3. Jar with carinated shoulder (Photo 53, right upper corner). Stratum X: Fig. 48:1. This is a jar with a sharply carinated shoulder, elongated body, emphasized thickened base made separately and attached to the body, narrow vertical neck and simple rim. The height of the vessel is 65 cm and its diameter at the shoulder is 33 cm. This single jar was found in Room 168, together with jars of Type 1. Another example of this type was found in Area A, in Stratum X.87 It is thus a rare type, known only in Stratum X. It is the last survival of a type well known in the Late Bronze Age II,88 which appears in the Iron Age I in isolated examples at several other sites (Megiddo VI, Tell Qiri, Ai, Tel Masos II, Tyre Stratum XIII).89 Type SJ 5. Egyptian jars . Two jars of Egyptian types were found in Area C, joining two Egyptian jars found in previous seasons. A. Fig. 48:9 (Courtyard 225, Building 225, Stratum X, Photo 56). Height 67 cm; maximum diameter 29 cm; capacity 26 litres. The sack-shaped body widens toward the lower part; the neck is high and vertical, and the rim is slightly thickened. This jar is made of reddish-brown clay, differing from the buff ware of which the three other jars are made. The body is covered with slight horizontal incisions, probably traces of the ropes which bound the jar during transportation. An inci- sion on the lower part of the body, made prior to firing, shows an undetermined sign. A cross was incised on the handle after firing. A similar jar was found in Area A,90 yet it differs from our example in its neck which directly continues the line of the body. Similar jars are unknown at other Iron Age I sites in Palestine. In Egypt, the type is known in several examples from the 21st-25th dynasties.91 B. Fig. 47:13 (Building 225, Stratum X, Photo 57). Height 39 cm; maximum diameter 35 cm. This jar has a vertical narrow neck, wide rounded shoulder, short body and rounded base, and lacks handles. A similar jar, but with an open upper part, was found in Area A,92 again in Stratum X. Similar jars were found in the Philistine tombs at Tell el-Faťah (S)93 and at Tel Esdar Stratum III.94 This is a characteristic Egyp- tian shape, retaining New Kingdom traditions.95 85.

Three other jars of this type were discovered in Area A (one complete vessel and two complete rims). The examples from Tell Qasile can be divided into two sub-types: a. Rounded and everted, or thickened rim. 1. Fig. 45:16 (Stratum X). 2. An example from Area A: IEJ 1 , p. 199, Fig. 10:c (attributed to Stratum VIII). 3.

Stratigraphically it should be attributed to either Stratum XI or Stratum X. b. Thickened inverted rim. Stratum X: Fig. 41:4. Stratum IX: Fig. 54:5. An example from Area A: IEJ 1, p. 203, Fig. 12: f (No. QI 635, Square 44A3, level 24.25 m). The rim and body fragments of the latter jar were found on a floor west of the "cells" above Building L. The floor was attributed to Stratum VII, but the stratigraphy here is problematic, and the 8th century B.C. date given to this floor is probably wrong. It might be attributed to Stratum VIII, of the second half of the 10th century B.C.96 VI, London 1915, PI. 38, Group 504. 96. See already Gibeah , p. 16. The floor on which this jar was found (Mazar [1951], p. 70, Fig. 2) can be attributed to the final phase of use of public building L (for its plan see ibid., p. 201, Fig. 11). The small "cells" in Square 45B1 can be attrib- uted to this last phase of the building. 57</page><page sequence="64">All these rims are about 20 cm in diameter and are of pithoi, of the "collared rim" type, about 1.20 m tall. These jars have been discussed at length in archaeological literature, for they characterize the Israelite settlement sites of central Palestine as well as the Valley of Jezreel and Transjordanian sites (spe- cially Sahab).97 The few examples found at Tell Qasile show that the type is foreign to the site, and that they were probably brought there by trade, despite their huge size and weight. They are made of grey clay, with many chalk grits, a ware not known among the local pottery of Tell Qasile. Group (a) at Tell Qasile is known throughout the Iron Age I and is the most common rim type in this class.98 Group (b), which appears in Strata X-IX, represents a later development of "collared rim" jar rims, from the second half of the 11th and the 10th centuries B.C. Parallels can be found at Tel Mevo- rakh Strata VIII- VII (late 1 1 th- 10th centuries B.C.), and at Megiddo Stratum VB.99 These jars disappear during the 10th century B.C. and are seldom found during the second half of that century, exceptions being known at Taanach Period IIB and Tell Qasile Stratum VIII. In both cases these pithoi could have survived from earlier times. Our views on the ethnic attribution of these pithoi, as well as other related problems, can be found in the discussion of similar pithoi found at Giloh,100 the abundant vessels there resembling our sub-type (a), though with many variations in the rim profile. Our type (b) was not found at Giloh or at other sites at the central hill-country, and should be considered a late Iron Age I and 10th century B.C. type, characteristic mainly of the coastal plain and the Valley of Jezreel. Exceptional jars (all from Building 225, Stratum X). Fig. 47:12. A body fragment of a jar of Type 1(?), decorated with horizontal black and red bands. This is a rare example at Tell Qasile of a decorated storage jar (compare the rims in Fig. 23:20-21). Parallels for this feature can be found at Tell Keisan Stratum 9a-c, and in the Iron Age I tomb at Nitsanim, as well as at Tyre Stratum XIII (11th century B.C.),101 where jars were painted with red bands only. The tradition of painted jars can be found in the Late Bronze Age.102 Fig. 47:11 (Photo 58). Upper part of a small jar with thick vertical sides, angular shoulders and sim- ple vertical rim. The thickness of the walls (3.5 cm) recalls industrial vessels, such as crucibles. This unique jar may have been used, e.g., in smelting, though no such traces were found within it. Fig. 47:14. A fragment of a jar with a "juglet stand" spout. This is one of the earliest examples of this element in the Iron Age pottery of Palestine. Jars with "juglet stand" spout were also found in 11th century B.C. contexts at Beer-Sheba and Tel Masos, and at Arad Stratum 12 (10th century B.C.?).103 Figs. 14:27-28 are two jar rims from Stratum XII. The diameter of the rim (20 and 27 cm) fits the size of "collared rim" pithoi, yet the shape is not character- istic to these pithoi, and thus the typological identifi- cation of the two sherds remains obscure. Summary. The most common jar at Tell Qasile was Type 1, of which many examples were found, spe- cially in Stratum X. It began to appear in Stratum XI (when it sometimes still retained the everted rim of Late Bronze Age tradition) and continues in Strata IX-VIII, of the 10th century B.C., when at other sites it was already replaced by other jar types.104 Types 2 and 3, represented by single examples, retain Late Bronze Age traditions. All three types are character- istic of the southern part of the country, and appear only rarely in the north. The two Egyptian jars are evidence of Egyptian imports during Stratum X. Egyptian jars are rare in this country during the Iron Age I, the few known examples coming from the south. The "collared rim" pithoi are probably foreign to Tel Qasile and are evidence of trade with the interior. The few examples 97.

The rim from Tell Qasile published in Mazar (1951), p. 199, Fig. 10: c was attributed to the 8th century B.C., but the entire Stratum VIII should be dated to the 10th century B.C.

The Tell Qasile jars thus show both chrono- logical and regional developments. G. AMPHORAE AND AMPHORISKOI Various vessels are assembled under this section, dif- fering from one another in many details; thus, it is impossible to arrange them in a homogeneous type- series. We divided them into three major groups: Type AM 1. Amphoriskos with two handles on shoulder and ring base. Stratum XI: Fig. 30:8 (Photo 59). Stratum XI-X: Fig. 32:13. Stratum X: Fig. 47:15. These three vessels have a widening body (rounded or angular), with two loop handles attached to the upper part of the body or to the shoulder, and a ring base. Fig. 30:8, which is 25 cm high, is carinated at the central part of the body, a shape which recalls "biconical" vessels of the Late Bronze Age. It has a narrow, cylindrical spout attached to the lower part of the neck. Similar vessels were found at Megiddo Stratum VI, Beth-Shan Stratum VI, ant Tell Keisan Strata 9a-9c. 105 Similar vessels, though different in the details of the profile, are also known on 10th century B.C. sites in the Valley of Jezreel, as at Megiddo Stratum V, Tel Amai Stratum IV and Taanach Period II.106 In a detailed ethnographic research, S. Avitzur has shown that these vessels were used as churns for producing samneh , a typical Middle East- ern dairy product, and that the small narrow spout allowed for the escape of air during production.107 Fig. 32: 13 has a rounded body (the neck has not been preserved). A similar vessel was found at Gezer Stra- tum VIII (10th century B.C.).108 Fig. 47:15, an amphora 28 cm high with rounded shoulder, has a diagonally cut rim, similar to some of the store-jar rims of Type 1. We should mention in this context an amphora from Area A, attributed in the preliminary publica- tion to Stratum VII and dated to the 8th century B.C.109 It has two loop handles attached at a ridge running around the centre of the high neck. It is slipped and hand burnished, and decorated with a Photo 59. Amphora Type AM 1 (Fig. 30:8). 105.

Amphoriskos Type AM 2 (Figs. 34:21-22). striding horse in a "reserved slip" technique. In addi- tion, black stripes decorate the body. This vessel can be parallelled at Megiddo and Beth-Shemesh Stra- tum IIA,110 in contexts no later than the 10th century B.C. The hand burnishing, as well as the fact that a Type 1 jar was found with the vessel, show that it should probably be attributed to Stratum VIII (like other vessels attributed to Stratum VII in Area A), which we date to the second half of the 10th century B.C. Type AM 2. Amphoriskos with rounded base. The four vessels in this group can be divided into two classes: (a) Small jars Fig. 26:17 (height 29 cm) is a small jar with ovoid body, narrow tall neck and diagonal rim. It has a red slip and is decorated with horizontal red bands. Sev- eral vessels resembling this one were found at Hazor Stratum XI and Megiddo Stratum V111 though they are not exact parallels. Fig. 30:9 (Stratum XI) is a small jar (30 cm high) with narrow, elongated body, carinated shoulder and stump base. It is a sort of miniature version of Type 1 jars, and no parallels are known. (b) Fig. 34:21-22 (Stratum X, Photo 60). Two miniature amphoriskoi from Temple 131, 13 cm high and 9.5 cm in diameter, with rounded body, narrow, vertical neck, simple rim, rounded base and two com- paratively large loop handles. They are decorated with red and black bands, and one of them has a black zigzag line on the body. An identical vessel from Area A is decorated in a manner characteristic of the "Bichrome" group of the Iron Age.112 The general shape is known in the Late Bronze Age, where the vessels are larger. 113 Similar yet not identi- cal vessels were found at Megiddo Stratum VI and Beth-Shan Strata VI- V, 1,4 as well as in early Phoeni- cian tombs in Lebanon, including one of the earliest tombs at Khaldeh (near Beirut), probably contem- porary with Tell Qasile Strata X-IX.115 The relation to Phoenician traditions is emphasized by the exam- ple from Area A, which is decorated in the Phoeni- cian "Bichrome" technique. Type AM 3. Vessel with two handles attached to the rim. The four items in this group, too, are dissimilar, but have been grouped together on the basis of a common feature: the two handles attached to the rim.

The maximum diameter of the body is 22 cm. The comparatively narrow, high neck ends in a moulded rim; the body is decorated in red and black bands. The manufacture and decora- tion recall bowls and jugs from Strata XI-X (e.g., Figs. 30: 10, 49:2-3). The upper part of a similar vessel is known at Megiddo Stratum VIB, though the body there is not carinated, as on our example.116 The type is very rare in this period.

Fig. 41:6 (Stratum X), a small amphoriskos (8.5 cm high) with rounded body and low neck. Three red Photo 62. Amphoriskos (Type AM 3) (Fig. 34:20). bands decorate the body. The last two miniature vessels are unparallelled. Fig. 34:20 (Stratum X, Photo 62) is a unique vessel with a broad, low body (7.5 cm high, 1 1.2 cm wide), sharply carinated, and has a sharply everted rim, large strainer spout and two double loop handles. It is red slipped, and the rim is decorated with short black lines. The body is slightly burnished. No parallels are known. H. JUGS There are few fragments of jugs in Strata XII-XI, though a large group of jugs was found in Stratum X. The jugs are heterogeneous: there are almost no two identical jugs, and they show a wide variety of shapes. Therefore, as in the previous group, the typological classification can only be in wide terms, on the basis of certain common features. Type JG 1. Jug with high neck and handle from rim to shoulder (Photos 63-64). Stratum XI: Figs. 27:15; 30:10. Stratum X: Figs. 36:3; 41:9; 44:32; 49:2-4, 8, 9, 11. These jugs are 20-25 cm high with a diameter of 15-17 cm. They have a rounded body, wide and high neck, and an everted rim which is either simple or slightly moulded. Five of these jugs are decorated with red and black bands on the body. In Fig. 30:10 from Stratum XI the handle is also decorated. The jugs lack a slip, except Fig. 49:8 (Stratum X), which has red slip; this jug also differs from the others in its narrow neck, which recalls Type 2. Similar jugs are known since the Late Bronze Age II,117 and variations are known throughout the Iron Age I. Examples can be seen at Hazor Stratum XII (similar to our Fig. 27:15), Megiddo Strata VII- VI, Taanach Period I (a rim identical to our Fig. 27:15) and Tell el-Far'ah (S), Tomb 542. 118 A similar jug from Beth-Shemesh Stratum III is decorated with Philistine decoration, and therefore was included by T. Dothan among her 17 types of Philistine ware.119 However, since this is a unique phenomenon, it should be defined as a common Iron Age I shape decorated with Philistine decoration, just as occurs with other vessels from Tell Qasile (see below, pp. 100-101). 116.

Jug with high neck, handle from middle of neck to shoulder and ring base (Photos 64-65). Stratum X: Fig. 41:7, 8, 14; 49:5, 6, 7, 14. This group of seven jugs from Stratum X ranges in height from 14 to 30 cm. The body is rounded or slightly carinated, the neck is usually high and nar- row, and the everted rim is usually simple or slightly thickened. One of these jugs has a ridged neck (Fig. 41:14); it is also smaller than the others and differs in shape. All the jugs except one have red slip, and three of them are burnished. In Fig. 49:7 the burnishing is vertical and irregular. Three of the jugs are decorated with black bands painted on the red slip, in a tech- nique characteristic of Strata XI-X. Fig. 43:24, a neck fragment, is painted in black, red and white bands, a technique characteristic of the "Bichrome" group of the Iron Age. It may be part of a jug of our group. Similar jugs appear at Megiddo, Temple 2048 (Stratum VII or VI; see below, p. 1 19, n.2) and Stratum VI, Beth-Shan Stratum VI, Azor (11th century B.C. tombs) and Tell el-Far'ah (S) Tombs 552, 236 and 242. 120 Some of the jugs at Megiddo Stratum VI and Beth-Shan Stratum VI have a burnished red slip, like some of our group, while others are painted in red and black bands. The ridge on the neck of Fig. 41:14 is still rare in the 1 1th century B.C., becoming more common during the 10th century B.C., as can be seen on jugs of similar form from Megiddo Strata IVB- VA, Taanach Period IIB, Tel Amai, Tell el-Far'ah (S), Arad Stratum 12 and Beer-Sheba.121 Similar jugs appear also in Phoenicia during the 10th century B.C. 122 Thus the type began its appearance during the second half of the 11th century B.C. and became common during the 10th century B.C. and may be related to a Phoenician tradition which began spread- ing during this period. Type JG 3. Jug with short and wide neck , hemispherical body and ring base. Stratum XI: Fig. 25:17 Stratum X: Fig. 49:10, 12, 13. These four jugs have a globular body, low and wide neck with slightly thickened rim, loop handle from rim to shoulder and ring base. The body is plain, as is characteristic of the southern type: parallels can be found at Tel Sippor Stratum I, Beth-Shemesh III, Tell el-Far'ah (S) Cemeteries 500 and 600, Tel Esdar Stratum III and Tel Masos Stratum II.123 The distri- bution of these jugs is thus limited, both chronologi- cally (late 1 2th- 11th centuries B.C.) and geographically. Type J G 4. Jug with trefoil rim. Stratum X: Fig. 41:10. An exceptional vessel ("jar-jug"): Fig. 49:1. Fig. 41 : 10 is the single example of a jug with trefoil rim in the present excavations at Tell Qasile. It is 25 cm high and has a wide, low neck, a handle stretching from rim to shoulder, a ring base and a plain body. Various jugs with trefoil rim are known in the Iron Age I,124 yet they are rare at Megiddo Stratum VI, Photo 66. "Jar-jug" (Fig. 49:1). 120.

On the other hand, such jugs are more common in the south during the same period. Fig. 49:1, from Building 225 of Stratum X (Photo 66), is a unique vessel, 51 cm high. It has an ovoid body with pointed base, narrow neck ending in a trefoil rim, two loop handles attached to the body and another handle from rim to shoulder. The loop handles are marked with small depressions on their upper part. This vessel, which is a unique combina- tion of jar and jug, is unparallelled elsewhere. Type JG 5. Strainer jug. The strainer jugs from Area C can be divided into the following sub-groups: (a) Jugs with Philistine decoration. Figs. 24: 19; 35:1 ,51:1. See discussion on pp. 95-97. (b) Jug with handle from rim to shoulder. Stratum X: Fig. 50:1. The shape of this jug is similar to Class 6 of the Philistine pottery as defined by T. Dothan (see below, p. 95), yet here it is decorated only with horizontal red bands. Similar, undecorated jugs are known in the Northern Negev in 1 1th century B.C. contexts, as well as in tombs in Lebanon, where they are either deco- rated with red bands or in the Phoenician "Bich- rome" technique.125 (c) Jug with basket handle, red slip and black decoration (Photos 67-68). Stratum X: Figs. 35:2-3; 36:1; 50:2-3. These jugs are characteristic of Stratum X. On the basis of the finds from Area A, T. Dothan included similar jugs in her Type 17 of the Philistine pottery, attributed to her third, depleted phase of this ware.126 However, two jugs from Stratum X, as well as the famous "Orpheus Jug" from Megiddo Stratum VI, are examples of such jugs decorated in rich Philistine decoration, and they were thus classified by us as Type 6A of the Philistine Ware (see below, pp. 95). Fig. 35:3 is 21.5 cm high, and has a carinated shoulder, narrow neck, and everted, diagonally cut rim. The spout is long (6.5 cm). The body is decorated with black bands and a frieze of a net pattern painted in black. The neck is painted with a single spiral line (executed while being turned on a tournette). The handle is decorated with short black lines. Almost 125. Tel Esdar , p. 31, Fig. 13: 14; Chapman (1972), p. 62.

The shoulder is carinated, and the neck is narrow; the rim and handle have not been preserved, though Fig. 54:25 seems to be the rim of a similar jug. The neck and body are decorated with horizontal black lines arranged in groups of three or four lines. The shape is almost Photo 69. Jug Type JG 5 (Fig. 35:2). identical to Fig. 51:1 which is decorated with a rich Philistine decoration; in shape, both recall the fa- mous "Orpheus Jug" from Megiddo Stratum VIA.129 Fig. 35:2 (Photo 69), a unique vessel, is a strainer jug without neck; instead, the upper part of the body ends in a wide opening to which an unusual handle is attached: a basket handle composed of four parts and an uppermost part recalling the "false spout" of stir- rup jars. The vessel has a red slip and is decorated with black lines. The body shape recalls Late Bronze Age jugs from Megiddo Stratum VIIB;130the unusual handle has an interesting parallel at Troy Stratum V.131 Most of the eleven jugs of this family brought by Dothan are from Stratum X at Tell Qasile, to which all our examples are safely attributed. Thus these jugs should be taken as characteristic of the workshops of this particular stratum. One jug from Megiddo Stra- tum VI is decorated with a net pattern, like our Fig. 35:3, 132 though the technique of black paint on red slip (discussed below) is generally lacking at Megiddo. Dothan discussed the appearance of sim- ilar jugs on Cyprus, at the beginning of the Cypro- Geometric period, precisely the timespan of our Stratum X. Yet it is not clear whether this type is the result of Cypriot influence on the local pottery at Tell Qasile (as Dothan suggests) or whether the influ- ence was in the other direction. (d) Strainer jug of the "Bichrome" group. Stratum X: Fig. 41:12 (Photo 70). This is a single example of a jug which can be attributed to the Phoenician "Bichrome" group, to which other vessels at Tell Qasile can also be attrib- uted (see discussion, p. 84). It is 25.5 cm high, with rounded body and ring base; the neck is narrow and tall with a handle stretching from the middle of the neck to the shoulder. A ridge ("collar") appears at the line connecting body and neck. The decoration on the body includes a characteristic pattern: a wide red band between groups of two narrow black lines with white band separating them. The neck is decorated with a similar group of bands. The shoulder is divided by triglyphs of three vertical black lines each; the metopes are filled with pairs of rhombs filled with diagonal lines. A Maltese cross, painted black and red, appears above the strainer spout. Though rhombs and Maltese crosses appear among the Philistine decorative motifs, this vessel should not be attributed to the Philistine ware. The style of decoration, and specially the combination of lines, the use of white colour, and the manner of filling the rhombs with diagonal lines, are all charac- teristic of the Phoenician "Bichrome" group.

Other examples are known at Megiddo Stra- tum VI and Tomb 1 101 B, Tell Keisan Stratum 8, Tel Mevorakh Stratum VIII,133 at the Phoenician ceme- tery at Khaldeh and in other tombs in Lebanon, and at Tyre Strata XIII-IX. 134 Some of the examples from Lebanon are decorated with rhombs, as our jug, yet none of them is decorated with a Maltese cross which, in our case, is probably a result of Philistine influence on one of the more southern production centres of "Bichrome" ware (possibly in the Acre Plain). All the examples from Lebanon are from tombs which can be dated to the second half of the 11th century B.C. Similar jugs appear in Cyprus in the "Bichrome" I-II group (according to Gjerstad's terminology).135 (e) Miniature strainer jug. Stratum X: Fig. 36:2. This miniature jug is 6 cm high, and has a strainer spout and remains of a loop handle. It is decorated with black horizontal lines. (f) Jug with basket handle and a cylindrical spout. See Type 7 of the Philistine pottery, below, p. 97. Summary. T. Dothan has demonstrated that the origin of the strainer jug should be sought in the Mycenean UIC pottery of Rhodes and Cyprus, where it precedes its appearance in Philistine pottery. This is in contrast to the opinion of Furumark and Gjerstad, as well as Chapman, who suggested that the type originated in Palestine.136 Chapman emphasized the contemporaneous appearance of these jugs in Phoe- nicia and in the Cypro-Geometric I-II period.137 The finds from Tell Qasile well illustrate the development 133. Megiddo II, PI. 75: 22-23; Megiddo Tombs , PI. 8: 12 (deco- rated with rhombs, like our example). Dothan included these jugs in her Type 6 of the Philistine pottery ( PMC , p. 137, Figs. 27: 4-5) while Amiran included them in the Bichrome group (Amiran [1969], PI. 91: 2); Tell Keisan , p. 187, Fig. 51: 1 (dated to the first half of 9th century B.C.; this date may be too low); Tel Mevorakh , p. 69 and Fig. 20: 15 (dated to ca. 1000 B.C; possibly a local variant, on the border between true "Philistine" ware and Phoenician Bichrome ware). 134.

At Tell Qasile we find three different techniques of decora- tion on similar profiles: rich Philistine decoration (below, p.95 ff.); red slip with black decoration, and "Bichrome" decoration in Phoenician style. The appearance of strainer jugs in the "Bichrome" group seems to be limited only to the second half of the 1 1th century B.C., since there are no examples of similarly decorated jugs in 10th century B.C. contexts. During this latter century, strainer jugs with a long spout, and a handle attached to the middle of the neck, appear with red slip and burnish.138 Type J G 6. Globular jugs (Photo 71). Stratum X: Figs. 41:11, 13; 45:15. The three examples (two complete vessels and one body fragment), all from Stratum X, are decorated in typical Phoenician "Bichrome" technique. Fig. 41:13, from Temple 131, is 17 cm in diameter. It is covered with a thick creamy-yellowish slip, con- tinuously burnished. The ridged neck ends in an everted rim; the loop handle is attached at the ridge on the neck. The jug was made of two hemispherical shells joined to one another along the vertical axis (parallel to the handle); the neck was later attached to the body. Each of the two parts is decorated with two groups of concentric circles, each of a wide red band flanked by groups of two narrow black lines with a white line between. A black "star" design appears below the handle, while on the opposite side there are two rhombs, filled with a net pattern. The handle is decorated with a row of X-motifs, and the rim is painted with short black lines. This jug is a superb example of the Phoenician "Bichrome" ware of the 11th century B.C. A similar jug was found at Megiddo Stratum VI.139 Fig. 41:11, also from Temple 131, is 15.5 cm in diameter. It is made of reddish clay and has a red slip. The body is squat and slightly distorted; the rim is funnel shaped, with the handle attached at the rim. The decoration consists of two concentric groups on each side, very similar in composition to those on the 138. Lachish III, Types 363-364; Tell en-Nasbeh II, Nos. 620- 622; Tel Zeror II, Pl. X: 8. An interesting problem calling for special study is the relation between Levantine strainer jugs and those of Phrygia and Sicily (see Chapman [1972], p. 179, n. 333). 139.

An X-motif below the handle is painted in white; there are no other fill motifs or handle decoration. Fig. 45:15 is a body fragment of a large jug, the approximate diameter of which is 30 cm. The frag- ment has a yellowish-creamy slip and is decorated with a concentric circle composed of a wide red band and two narrow black lines. A double X-motif is painted in black on the shoulder. Fig. 52:16 from Stratum IX is 17 cm in diameter; it has a double handle which attaches the centre of the neck. The rim is not preserved; the body is slightly distorted and is undecorated.140 These jugs, which represent the earliest group of Phoenician pottery, have been widely discussed in the literature.141 Recently published examples provide data for more precise dating of this group and its inner development. Globular (or "spherical") jugs with black, red and sometimes white decoration appear at Megiddo Stra- tum VI, Tell Abu-Hawam Stratum IV, Tell Keisan Stratum 9a, Tel Masos Stratum II and Tyre from Stratum XIV - all contemporaneous with Tell Qasile Stratum X. 142 The only exception is a jug from Stratum IXB at Hazor which, if correctly attributed to this stratum, could be dated to the end of the 10th century B.C. It differs from the other examples in its wide neck.143 Globular jugs with red decoration alone appear over a longer range: 12th or 11th to 10th centuries B.C. (Hazor Stratum XII, Beth-Shan Stra- tum VI(?) and parallel tombs, Ai, Tell el-Far'ah (N) Stratum III and Tell Qasile Stratum VIII).144 Other globular jugs which appear during the same period (11 - 10th centuries B.C.) are red slipped, burnished and decorated with black decoration (Tel Masos Stratum II, Megiddo Stratum V).145 In Lebanon, globular jugs appear in the earliest Phoenician tombs (at Khaldeh, Joya, Khirbet Silm, Tell Ghassil and the Beqeah), usually with "Bichrome" decoration, some- times with the addition of white paint, as on our jugs. 146 Some of these jugs are very similar to our Fig. 41:13, and they appear together with lentoid flasks. These tombs should be dated to the second half of the 11th century B.C. and the first half of the 10th cen- tury B.C., prior to the appearance of the next Phoeni- cian pottery group - "Red Slip" ware. A similar jug from Nebesheh (in the eastern Delta) comes from an llth-lOth century B.C. context.147 In Cyprus such jugs appear both as imports from the Levant and in local ware (local "Bichrome" ware and White Painted ware) from the beginning of the Cypro- Geometric period on (Salamis Tomb 101, together with Proto-White Painted ware, as well as in Amathos and Lapithos).148 According to Birmingham they continue to appear as imports in Cyprus until the beginning of the 9th century B.C.149 "Bichrome" jugs 140.

Oren suggests that these jugs originated in Anatolia, but this is unfounded. The examples from Boghazkoy, Mersin and Tarsus, cited as parallels, differ in many details from the Phoenician jugs, and there is probably no connection between them. 142.

Birmingham (1963), p. 37, claims that similar jugs appear in the Levant until the 9th century B.C., yet it appears to me that globular jugs of this type (without ring base) no longer appear after the beginning of the 10th century B.C. 68</page><page sequence="75">with ring base (above p. 65) appear from the late 1 1 th century B.C. on. During the 10th century B.C. they appear with a decoration resembling the globular jugs, though they were made on the wheel as one unit, unlike the globular jugs (which were produced like flasks, from two separate units). It is occasionally impossible to distinguish in publications between true globular jugs and the same jug with a ring base, when the bottom of the vessel has not been pre- served.150 The true globular jugs, made as flasks, reached the peak of their appearance during the timespan of Stratum X at Tell Qasile and Stratum VI at Megiddo. Their main distribution was in Phoeni- cia, inner Lebanon and northern Israel. Further south they are rare (note their absence at Tell el- Far'ah (S) and Tell Jemmeh), though their sporadic appearance on southern sites and in Egypt (Tel Masos and Nebesheh) is evidence for trade with the north. Among the examples from Tell Qasile, at least Figs. 41:13 and 45:15 were imported from Phoenicia, while jugs such as Figs. 41:11 and 52: 16 were proba- bly made locally. Various jug fragments. Various jug fragments, their full shape unknown, appear in the pottery Figures. Among them we should mention the following: Fig. 20:2. A body fragment of a jug with vertical sides and carinated shoulder. Unparallelled in other Iron Age I contexts. Figs. 15:5-7; 16:13; 17:4, 25; 44:14. Rims of jugs from Stratum XII (except Fig. 44:14, which is from Stratum X). They are one of the few forms which can be attributed solely to this stratum. Parallels can be found at Beth-Shan Stratum VI, Taanach Period I, Shiloh, Beth-Shemesh Stratum III and Tel Esdar Stratum II.151 Other rim fragments from Strata XII-XI are Figs. 11:21, 14:30, 15:2, 17:2-3, 23:20-21 and 30:6, 7, of various shapes. The last six may be attributed either to large jugs or to storage jars. Figs. 30:5 and 44:15 are upper parts of small, closed vessels with short and wide, everted neck. They may be either jugs or small jars. Figs. 15:3-4; 17:5 (Stratum XII); 20:4-7; 23:19 (Stratum XI) and 50:17 are various rim fragments of vessels with narrow necks, either jugs or globular goblets. Some of these rims are painted. Fig. 15:3 has a plant design in black, and Fig. 23:19 is decorated with black triangles on a red slip. Among the jug handles we should mention the following: Fig. 23:26 (Stratum XI) and Fig. 52:6 (Stratum IX), double handles, similar to the one on the globu- lar jug, Fig. 52:16. Fig. 23:27 (Stratum XI), a triple handle made of three attached clay coils. There are several parallels for such handles on Iron Age I sites and in 10th century B.C. contexts.152 Figs. 15:13, 14 (Stratum XII); 23:28 (Stratum XI), twisted handles, again parallelled at several Iron Age I sites in southern Palestine.153 Summary . The group of rim fragments from Stra- tum XII indicates the existence of certain types of jugs in this stratum, which disappear in later strata. Stratum XI is characterized by jugs of Type 1 with red slip and black decoration. Type 3 starts its appear- ance while strainer jugs are still rare (see the chapter on decorated Philistine pottery). In Stratum X, jugs of Type 1 continue their appearance with either a red slip or black and red decoration, and Type 3 jugs, which are characteristic of the southern part of the country, become common. Strainer jugs appear with rich Philistine decoration (see p. 95 below) and with a red slip and black decoration. This decoration char- acterizes two new types which appear in this stratum: Types 2 and 5c. The globular jug (Type 6) also begins appearing in Stratum X, and is an indication for relations with Phoenicia, as is the strainer jug of Type 5d, in which the relationship between the Philistine decorative style and Phoenician pottery is illustrated. The various jugs thus illustrate some of the most characteristic features in the pottery of Tell Qasile: (1) Continuation of Late Bronze Age traditions in shapes and decoration. (2) Local variations of the decorated Philistine pottery. (3) The development of a local style, characterized by the use of a red slip and black decoration. (4) Relations with Phoenicia are indicated by both the imported Phoenician jugs and their local imitations. 150. See the examples from Hazor, cited above (n. 143); and Tel Mevorakh, Fig. 18: 15.

JUGLETS Eleven complete juglets and twelve large body frag- ments were found in the various strata. All are 12-13 cm high, and the mouth, where preserved, is trefoil. The juglets can be divided to two types according to body shape. Type JT 1. Juglet with elliptical body and pointed base. Stratum XII: Figs. 11:24; 15:9. Stratum XI: Figs. 20:9; 30:16-18. Stratum X: Figs 36:4-5; 42:9 (exceptional: Fig. 36:6). Stratum VIII: Fig. 55:9. This shape continues the most characteristic Late Bronze Age dipper juglets.154 The type appears in various Iron Age I contexts, until the 11th century B.C.,155 and disappears during the 10th century B.C. Fig. 42:9 (Photo 72) has a unique decoration of three parallel vertical lines of impressed decoration (made with a pointed tool) on the handle. Fig. 36:6 is larger than the other juglets: 21.5 cm high (ill fact it could be defined as a jug), with flat- tened base. A parallel to this rare form is found at Megiddo Stratum VI.156 Photo 72. Juglet Type JT 1 (Fig. 42:9). The juglet from Stratum VIII in Fig. 55:9 is close in form to the juglets of Type 1, though here the base is not pointed. Type JT 2. Juglet with sack-shaped body. Stratum XI: Figs. 20:8, 10, 11; 23:17. Stratum X: Figs. 42:1-8; 43:23; 50:4. Stratum IX: 52:5 (?) The body of these juglets widens toward the bot- tom, making it "sack-shaped". The size and shape of the rim are similar to the previous type. There are many variations in the degree of the widening of the body and in the details of shape, yet the group can be classified under a single type. This juglet shape begins appearing already at the end of the Late Bronze Age,157 but becomes common throughout the coun- try, in Trans-Jordan and in Phoenicia, only during the Iron Age I.158 It continues appearing during the 10th century B.C.,159 but later it disappears and is replaced by the cylindrical juglet with rounded rim. The dipper juglets from Tell Qasile well reflect the development of this vessel throughout the 12th- 11th centuries B.C. The lack of rounded juglets with high narrow neck, with a black or brown surface, should be noted. Such juglets have been attributed to several 11th century B.C. contexts, as were three from tombs at Beth- Shan, at Tell Deir 'Alia Phase J, Beth-Shemesh Stra- tum III, Tell el-Fûl, and Tel Masos Period II,160 but at Megiddo they begin to appear only in Stratum VB.161 The lack of such juglets in rich assemblages such as at Tell Qasile Stratum X and Megiddo Stratum VI shows that the few juglets of this type attributed to 11th century B.C. contexts signify the emergence of this important type ca. 1000 B.C. Fig. 50:5, a juglet or a small jug with a ring base, cylindrical body and a handle, should be mentioned separately. The neck was not preserved. The body is painted in black (?) horizontal lines (the vessel was found burnt, and determination of the colour is difficult). 154. Amiran (1969), PI. 46: 16, 23; Megiddo II, Pis. 58: 6; 63: 4-5. 155.

FLASKS The 35 complete or almost complete flasks can be divided into five groups. Type FL 1. Small lentoid flask (Photo 73). Stratum XII: Figs. 11:23; 15:10. Stratum XI: Figs. 20:12, 14(?); 25:20(7). Stratum X: Figs. 37:2-6, 8-15; 42:12-16; 50:11, 19. In two cases such flasks were found as groups of offering vessels in the temples: 14 flasks were found together in Room 188 of Temple 131 (Stratum X), and 4 others were found in Locus 134 of the same temple. The average height of these flasks is 13-14 cm, and the average diameter is 9 cm. The lentoid body was made of two separate parts; the narrow neck, made separately and attached to the body, ends in a simple everted rim, though in two cases (Figs. 25:20 and 37:2) there is a "funnel shaped" rim. Two diago- nal handles are attached to the body and to the Photo 73. Flask Type FL 1 (Fig. 20:12). Photo 74. Flask Type FL 5b (Fig. 37:7). bottom of the rim. The clay is usually brown and rough; the walls are comparatively thick and the firing usually left a grey core. In Strata XII-XI these flasks are decorated only with concentric red circles on the plain body, and in one case (Fig. 16:29) the decoration is on a white slip. In Stratum X seven of the flasks are decorated with concentric red circles, in one case on white slip. One flask from this stratum is decorated with red and black circles, one with only black circles, and another black circles on a red slip; 8 examples are undecorated. These flasks are among the most common vessels throughout the Iron Age I throughout the country (except at hill-country sites).162 Most known exam- ples are decorated with concentric red circles; other decorations are rare, but one example from Ashdod Stratum X, and another from Tel Masos Stratum II, have black circles on a red slip, like our Fig. 37:2. During the 10th century B.C. such flasks became extinct (there is one example at Megiddo Stratum VB, another in Strata IVB-VA there and several from Tell 162. There are many examples, only a few of which are cited here: Megiddo II, Pis. 67: 2; 70: 8; 80: 5; 86: 7; Beth-Shan NC, discussion on p. 113 (Types la and lc, common in many tombs, are parallel to our type); Ashdod II-III, Fig. 74: 15-16; Tel Eitun, PI. 2: 25; Nitsanim, Fig. l:'0'Madeba, Fig. 15: 79-81, 84-86; Tel Masos, PI. 156: 14; 159: 7; Tell Keisan, Pis. 62:1; 76:2-4. 71</page><page sequence="78">el-Far'ah [S] Cemetery 200. 163 The latter lack decora- tion and show the decline of this type). Similar flasks appear in Egypt, Lebanon and Cyprus. In Egypt they seem to appear in contexts of the 18th-19th dynasties, that is, earlier than their appearance in Palestine - a situation which led E. Oren to conclude that the type originated in Egypt.164 A group of lentoid flasks from a tomb at Quraya, Lebanon, has a red slip and black decoration, like the two flasks from Tell Qasile and Ashdod, while others from the same tomb are decorated with concentric black circles, like one example from Tell Qasile.165 The Quraya tomb is thus contemporaneous with Stratum X at Tell Qasile. Other flasks from Lebanon are decorated with concentric red circles, yet most of them have a globular (rather than lentoid) body.166 On Cyprus such flasks appear from the mid-1 1th century B.C. as an import from the Levant (e.g., at Salamis) and continue appearing during the Cypro- Geometric I-II period.167 Gjerstad differentiated between flasks with a simple everted rim (which he attributed to Period I) and those with a funnel shaped rim (which he attributed to Period II), yet in Tell Qasile both types appear contemporaneously, and thus this division is meaningless. The appearance of such flasks on Cyprus is further support for limiting the Cypro-Geometric I-II period there to the second half of the 11th century and beginning of the 10th century B.C. (see below, p. 125). Type FL 2. Lentoid flask with metope decoration (Photos 75-76). Stratum XI: Fig. 24:20. Stratum X: Figs. 36:10-11; 37:1. These lentoid flasks are similar in shape to the previous group, yet they are usually larger (average diameter 19 cm) and differ in the details of shape. They are decorated on either side by two groups of concentric red lines with black painted triglyphs between them. In three cases the triglyphs are made of two straight lines with a wavy line between, like the triglyphs on Philistine pottery, and in three cases there is a black and red Maltese cross at the centre of the body. The handles are painted in short black or black and red lines; the rim is painted red. This decoration can be defined as pure Philistine: its style and technique are similar to the design on decorated Photo 75. Flask Type FL 2 (Fig. 37:1). Photo 76. Flask Type FL 2 (Fig. 36:10). 163.

Composite flask (Photos 77-78). Stratum X: Figs. 42:10, 11. These two composite flasks from the Stratum X temple should be regarded as cult vessels, and thus we mentioned them among the cult vessels in Part One. Fig. 42:10 is a double flask, 11:5 cm high. Fig. 42: 1 1 is a triple flask, 13 cm high. The body of these flasks is wheel-made as one unit, finished in a manner leaving the impression that several flask bodies had been attached to one another. The necks and handles were made separately and attached to the body. Similar composite flasks are known in Egypt, where at least one example is dated to the New King- dom.170 One such flask was found in Tomb 219 at Beth-Shan, dated to the Late Bronze Age.171 Several composite flasks with 2 to 7 necks, were found on Photo 78.

This provides another link between Cyprus and Palestine during this period. The triple flask has a buff slip and is slightly bur- nished, like such Bichrome jugs as Fig. 36:8. The double flask (Fig. 42:10) is decorated with black paint on a buff surface, without slip. The basic design is composed of concentric circles. In Fig. 42: 1 1 a spiral appears at the centre of the circles, and a "branch" motif decorates the zone below the handle. In Fig. 42:10, radial lines create metopes between the concentric circles. This technique of decoration, in black paint over a light background, is found on a group of flasks from an 11th century B.C. cist grave at Achzib,173 on a group of flasks from tombs in Lebanon,174 and on flasks found on Cyprus, in Cypro-Geometric I-II contexts, where they are consi- dered as imports from the Levant.175 Ms. Chapman defined this technique as "Black Painted", and it should be regarded as characteristic Phoenician ware, related to the "White painted" technique on Cyprus. Type FL 4. Flask with lentoid body and spoon- shaped neck (Photo 79). Stratum XI: Fig. 20:13; 30:19. Stratum X: Fig. 50:8. The only complete example of such a flask is Fig. 20:13, 22.5 cm high and 14 cm in diameter, with a lentoid body and a high neck ending in a shallow spoon; there are two small horizontal handles on the shoulder. It has a red slip and is decorated in black, with concentric circles on each side, with a huge spiral at their centre. Similar flasks are known from various Iron Age I contexts, such as Megiddo (Stratum VI and Tomb 39); Beth-Shan Strtum V temples; Tell Keisan Stratum 9a; Gezer Tombs 84-85; Beth-Shemesh Stra- tum III; Tell el-Far'ah (S) Cemeteries 800, 500 and 600 (but not 200!). 176 Most of the parallels have a Photo 80.

At Tell el-Far'ah (S) Beth-Shemesh and Tell Keisan, some of the flasks have loop handles instead of small horizontal handles or lug handles. Such flasks become extinct during the 10th century B.C., though a few examples can be found at Tell en-Nasbeh and Samaria Period 1. 177 Our example is the only one decorated with black decora- tion on a red slip.

The few examples of such flasks are divided to two sub-types according to their size, though both sub-types include examples decorated in the charac- teristic Phoenician Bichrome decoration side by side with examples decorated in local style. Sub-type FL 5a. Large globular flask (Photos 80- 81). Fig. 36:8 (Locus 188, Temple 131, Stratum X). The diameter of the body is 16 cm; the height is 25 cm. The neck is shaped like a deep funnel, and the two loop handles reach the middle of the neck. The surface treatment and decoration are similar to those of the globular jug in Fig. 41:13 (see p. 67 above), but instead of the lozenges below the handle, there is a "star" motif. The two vessels are so similar that they must have been made by the same potter; both are excellent examples of the Phoenician "Bichrome" group. The flask, like the jug, finds a parallel at Megiddo Stratum VI.178 Fig. 36:9 (Stratum X). A flask of similar dimen- sions, though its body is not fully globular, but rather a transitional shape between globular and lentoid. The neck and rim are identical to those on flasks of Type 2 (diagonally cut rim). The black and red deco- ration includes concentric circles with a black "star" motif at the centre. The decoration, however, is in a local style and technique, which differs from the typi- cal Bichrome technique in which the previous flask is made. Similar flasks were found at Tel Keisan, Phase 9c (ca. 1100 B.C.).179 Sub-type FL 5b. Small globular flask (Photo 74). Stratum X: Figs. 37:7; 50:9, 10. Fig. 37:7, 9 cm in diameter and 14 cm high, is made and decorated in the typical Bichrome technique. It has a buff slip and the decoration includes concentric circles. The other two flasks in this group are deco- rated in local style, with black or red concentric circles and a spiral in their centre. The Bichrome flasks find parallels at various Iron Age I sites: Hazor Stratum XII; Megiddo (Temple 2048 and Stratum VI); Achzib ( 1 1th century B.C. cist grave), Tell Abu-Hawam Stratum IV; Beth-Shemesh Stratum III;180 and various tombs in Lebanon,181 178.

Cyprus182 and Lower Egypt.183 The few flasks deco- rated in true Phoenician "Bichrome" technique found south of Phoenicia proper were probably imported (as were the few examples from Tell Qasile, Megiddo, Beth-Shemesh and Egypt). These "Bi- chrome" flasks are characteristic of the 11th century B.C., and the few examples which seem to be earlier (Hazor Stratum XII and Temple 2048 at Megiddo) should probably be redated accordingly (see below, pp. 119-125). Ms. Chapman has argued that such flasks continued into the Iron Age II, basing on a few cases: Hazor, Tell Abu-Hawam Stratum III and a tomb on Mount Carmel. 184 Yet the data from Hazor, at least, is inadequate: the few published fragments could be attributed to globular jugs with ring base - which definitely appear during the 10th century B.C. Sim- ilar flasks appear on Cyprus in the Bichrome II group; the high date suggested for this group by Van Beek (contra Gjerstad's lower date) fits the date established at Tell Qasile. (For the Bichrome group see further below, p. 84.) The other flasks in the group, those made locally and decorated in either red and black, or only red decoration, find parallels at various Iron Age I sites, although the examples are not numerous (Beth-Shan Stratum VI; Afula Stra- tum IIIA; Megiddo Stratum VI; Tell el-Far'ah [S] Cemeteries 500 and 600. The latest example is from Tell Abu-Hawam Stratum III).185 In Phoenicia sim- ilar flasks appear with either red or black decora- tion.186 The black decoration is considered by Chapman as typical Phoenician style; it also appears on flasks found in Cyprus (Cypro-Geometric I-III contexts), where they are considered as imports from the Levant.187 Summary. The rich group of flasks from Tell Qasile includes all the variants in shape and decoration of this vessel known in the Iron Age I in Palestine. Our typological subdivision is based on shape and size, regardless of technique of decoration. As we have seen, various decorative techniques appear on almost identical shapes. The most common decorative motif is of concentric red circles painted on the plain body, without slip. Most of the lentoid flasks of Type 1 are decorated in this manner, as are some of the small globular flasks (Sub-type 5b). Local black and red decoration appears on some of the flasks of Types 1 and 5, while a few large flasks are decorated in rich geometric designs which can be defined as Philistine decoration. The black decoration on a red slip, a most common technique at Tell Qasile Strata XI-X, appears on flasks of Types 1 and 4, which may be taken as typical local products. Two decorative tech- niques can be related to the Phoenician world: the Phoenician "Bichrome" decoration on two flasks of Type 5, and the "Black Painted" flasks with creamy- buff slip (one or two examples in Type 3). These were probably imported to Tell Qasile from Phoenicia. The following represents the development of flasks throughout the different strata at Tell Qasile: Type 1 appears in all three strata (XII-X) without any inter- nal development; Type 2 is characteristic of Stratum XI and to the early days of Stratum X (Locus 188); Type 4 appears in Stratum XI; while Types 3 and 5, which are related to the Phoenician world, appear in Stratum X only. 182.

The evidence from Tell Abu-Hawam Stratum III and Tell el-Far'ah (S) shows that undecorated lentoid flasks continued to appear during that century, while a few examples of "Bichrome" flasks may indicate contin- uation of such flasks in the north of the country during the 10th century B.C., though the evidence for this is still too meagre. K. PYXIDES One complete pyxis and several additional fragments can be divided to two types according to the shape of the base. Type PX 1. Pyxis with rounded base. Stratum XI: Fig. 27:21. The body widens toward the bottom and is cari- nated at its lower part; the base is rounded; two small horizontal handles are on the shoulder. The neck and rim were not preserved; the body has a red slip and is decorated with black horizontal bands. This shape is known since the Late Bronze Age II,188 and there are many parallels in Iron Age I sites throughout the country,189 as well as during the 10th century B.C., when the type gradually grew extinct.190 Type PX 2. Pyxis with ring base (Photo 82). Stratum X: Fig. 42:17. This complete vessel, 12 cm high, has an elongated body, carinated at its lower part, narrow neck with everted, diagonally cut rim and two small horizontal handles on the shoulder. Iron Age I parallels for this pyxis can be found at Megiddo Strata VIIA-VI, Tel Eitun, Tell el-Far'ah (S); it continued to appear dur- ing the 10th century B.C. at Megiddo and Tell el- Far'ah (S).191 A similar vessel was published among the finds from Area A at Tell Qasile Stratum X.192 The three fragments of pyxides are not attributable to either of the two suggested types. Photo 82. Pyxis Type PX 2 (Fig. 42:17). Fig. 30:20 (Stratum XI) is part of a pyxis with carinated body, its upper part slightly concave. It has two lug handles on the shoulder and is decorated with red bands. Parallels for the shape are found at Beth- Shemesh Stratum III and Tell el-Far'ah Tomb 649. 193 Fig. 50:18 (Stratum X). A body fragment of a rounded pyxis, possibly similar to a vessel from Tomb 562 at Tell el-Far'ah (S).194 Fig. 52:7 (Stratum IX). An upper part of a pyxis with rounded body and two lug handles on the shoulder, high neck, simple rim and decoration of vertical black lines painted on the plain body. The stratigraphie attribution is not sure. A parallel can be found among the pyxides of Megiddo Stratum VI.195 The sparsity of examples prevents discussion of the typological development of this vessel. The two base types appear side by side during the entire Iron Age I, and both continue during the 10th century B.C. when they were sometimes made of burnished black clay. 196 188.

Iron Age I and 10th century B.C. tombs in Lebanon also contained pyxides with either rounded or ring base.197 L. LAMPS (Photo 83) Seventeen complete or almost complete lamps were found in Area C. Stratum XI: Figs. 20:15-18; 25:1-3; 26:12; 31:3-5. Stratum XI-X (Shrine 300): Fig. 32:14. Stratum X: Figs. 36:7; 43:1-3. Stratum IX: Fig. 52:8. All the lamps have a rounded base and body, the rim continuing the sides, though emphasized by a minor carination. The rim becomes more distinct in Stratum X, where in two cases (Figs. 36:7 and 43:2) it is horizontally flanged. Fig. 43:2, with its flat base, is almost identical to 10th century B.C. lamps and should be taken as the first appearance of this new type. In contrast, the single lamp from Stratum IX still maintains charac- teristics of the Iron Age I lamps in its rounded shape and indistinct rim. The appearance of lamps with emphasized, almost flanged rim side by side with lamps with almost indis- tinct rim characterizes many Iron Age I contexts. At Hazor Stratum XII a lamp with a red slip and flanged rim was found; almost half of the lamps at Beth-Shan Strata VI-V, and especially those in the "coffin tombs" there, have a flanged rim; a similar combina- tion appears at other sites.198 The development of lamps towards the 10th century B.C. is gradual: most of the lamps in the earliest Iron Age II tombs at Lachish (early 10th century B.C.) and at Tell en- Nasbeh Tombs 5, 29 and 32 are similar to our Figs. 20:15, 17; 25:2, 3; 31:5; 36:7 and 52:8. On the other hand, most of the lamps from the second half of the 10th century B.C. and from the early 9th century B.C., like those from Tel Amai Stratum III, Megiddo Strata IVB-VA, and even later contexts such as Samaria Strata V-VI, and Ashdod Stratum VIII, are similar to our Fig. 43:2 which appears in our Stratum X.199 It thus seems that each of the two main types of lamps appeared over a 250 year span. The second half of the 1 1th century B.C. and the first half of the 10th century B.C. saw the transition from the rounded lamp with rim continuing the side of the body to the new type of a lamp with flanged, horizontal rim. M. VARIA Cup and saucer. Fig. 45:2 (Shrine 300, Strata XI-X). Diameter 19.5 cm. The bowl has a pinched mouth; the cup has an everted rim and is connected to the bowl by a small hole. Cup and saucers are known since the Late Bronze Age II. Iron Age I examples are known from Megiddo Strata VIIA-VIA; Beth-Shan Strata VI- Lower V; Afula Stratum HIB and Gezer Stratum XIII. The type continues to appear during the Iron Age II (at Hazor Strata X-IX, Samaria and Tel Mevorakh).200 197. Chapman (1972), p. 164. 198.

Some scholars think it was used as a lamp (J.W. Crowfoot; J. Kaplan)201 while others explain it as a cult vessel for burning incense (R. Amiran) or libation (M. Dothan).202 Our vessel was found at the entrance to Shrine 300, together with a low cylindri- cal stand (Fig. 45: 1 ), and thus it could have served for cult purposes. On the other hand, the pinched mouth, which was found blackened from fire, shows that our vessel could have served as a lamp, though not in the manner suggested by Kaplan. The fact that other cup-and-saucers were found in cultic contexts (i.e., the Fosse Temples at Lachish, Installation E 207 at Samaria) tend to show that the vessel is related to cult practices, yet at other sites such vessels are found in various structures, and thus no definite judgment can be made. The fact that other cup-and-saucers lack the pinched mouth, or the connecting hole between the cup and the saucer, indicates that there might be a variety of uses for this kind of vessel. Strainer. Fig. 31:11; 43:6. Two fragments of strainer vessels with carinated body. A complete vessel of this type was found in Area A, and is identical in shape to bronze strainers found on Iron Age I sites in Palestine.203 Similar pottery strainers are known from Megiddo Strata VIIA-V; Beth-Shan Stratum V temple and Gezer, as well as on Cyprus, where they appear in the Plain White I and White Painted I groups.204 Funnel Fig. 31:12 (Stratum XI). The upper part of the funnel is made like a cari- nated bowl of Type 8, the upper diameter of which is 13 cm; its base is like a funnel, 5.3 cm in diameter. A loop handle is attached to the rim. This funnel was found in Pit 125 near the anthropomorphic vessel ( Tell Qasile 1, p. 79, Fig. 18). The diameter of the funnel fits the opening of the anthropomorphic ves- sel, and the rim of the latter is worn with use; it is thus probable that this funnel served for filling the anthro- pomorphic vessel during cult ceremonies. Similarly shaped funnels are known among Myce- nean pottery205 and we can regard our vessel as being reminiscent of Mycenean tradition, as are some of the most distinct shapes in the Philistine repertoire. Pot- tery funnels of various shapes are known during the Late Bronze Age, continuing to appear during the Iron Age II, though they are not a common feature during that period.206 Tripod vessel. Fig. 31:6 (Stratum XI). A fragment of the lower part of a vessel with con- vex bottom with remains of three elongated legs. The vessel is 13 cm in diameter, with an orange-red slip, and a continuous, well executed burnish. Both the colour of the slip and the technique of burnishing are foreign to the local ware of Stratum XI, and thus this vessel was probably not locally made. It is impossible to guess the complete shape of this vessel, but it might have been similar to a vessel from Tell el-Far'ah (S).207 Baking trays. Stratum XI: Fig. 26:20. Stratum VIII: Fig. 54:24. Two fragments of baking trays, made like an up- side-down, shallow bowl with nail and reed impres- sions on the upper side. Similar trays were found in Iron Age I contexts (Megiddo Stratum VI, Beth- Shemesh Stratum III, Tell Keisan Strata 9c-9a and Afula Stratum III)208 and they continued to be a common type during the Iron Age II. Fragments of unusual vessels. Fig. 16:14. The pointed base of a red slipped and burnished vessel, the complete shape of which is unknown. Fig. 23:18.

According to Kaplan, the wick floated on the oil in the centre of the vessel. This is based on the hypothesis that the central part and the outer bowl were connected by a hole, but no such hole exists in many cases, and even when present, the use of the vessel as a lamp remains obscure. 202.

In Room 168 of Building 225 two clay troughs were discovered, one of them was reconstructed. It is made out of unfired rough clay, mixed with straw. It has a flat thick base and low side walls on three sides. The fourth side was left free, perhaps to enable the flow of some liquid or dough which was prepared in these troughs. The complete trough is 53.5 cm long and its height is 11 cm. The two troughs were found broken among the large group of storage jars in this room. Nearby, in Courtyard 225, a grinding installation was found. It was suggested to us by Mr. R. Grafman that the place could have been a brewery; the troughs were used for preparing dough which was then put into the jars for the fermentation process. Clay loom weights (Photo 85). Clay unbaked loom weights were found in various loci, as follows: Locus Stratum No. of weights 127 X 2 168 X 3 171 X 3 174 X 16 187 X 5 204 X 10+ The weights are usually hemispheric and pierced in the centre. They are made out of local rough clay mixed with straw; they measure 7.5-9 cm in diameter and 4.2-5.9 cm in height. Similar weights were found in the past in large numbers in most of the dwellings at Tell Qasile, Area A. They point to the location of 80 Photo 84. Doughing trough. looms in these houses. In Area C, the number of such weights in each building was not large. In Building 225, 10 weights were scattered in the various rooms. A concentration near the doorway of Room 204, the "kitchen" north of Temple 131 of Stratum X, may indicate weaving activity in the temple compound, perhaps in relation to the cult practices (see p. 157 for description of textile impressions from Temple 200).

CYPRIOT AND CYPRO-PHOENICIAN IMPORTS Only a few fragments of Cypriot and Cypro- Phoenician "Black-on-Red" ware were found in Area C, apart from the Phoenician "Bichrome" ware, which was included in the previous typological discussion and which will be discussed below as a group (pp. 00). White-Painted Ware (WP) (Photo 86) Fig. 27:4-6. These three fragments and an addi- tional rim fragment (Fig. 45:18) are the only exam- ples of Cypriot White Painted Ware from Area C. They include a rim and two bases made of light, well-levigated, well-fired ware, covered with yellowish-creamy slip and decorated in black decora- tion. The rim (Fig. 27:4) is decorated with a 1.6 cm wide black band on the outside and a 2.4 cm wide black band on the inside. On the inside paint has dripped on the surface of the vessel. The rim is 2.5 mm thick. The base in Fig. 27:6 is probably of the same bowl. Its diameter is 3.7 cm; at the centre there is a conical depression. The base is decorated on the outside with a wide, black band reaching the bottom of the body. Within, the bottom of the bowl is painted black, while traces of a black band are seen on the outside. The third fragment (Fig. 27:5) is a trumpet base of a larger bowl; its diameter is 8.8 cm. It is painted on the outside with a black band 2 cm wide, with a black circle decorating the bottom of the bowl, within. The stratigraphie position of these three fragments is not entirely clear. They were found together in Locus 174, south of Temple 131 of Stratum X, in a level which would match a Stratum XI floor. Yet no floor was found at this spot, and a pit sunk down from Stratum X has probably intruded here. It was impossible to determine whether the fragments should be attributed to Stratum XI or X, though they are probably no later than Stratum X. Fig. 45:18 is a small rim fragment of asimilar bowl, found in Locus 326, a Stratum X building at the north-western corner of Area C. Photo 86. Cypriot White-Painted Ware (Figs. 27:5; 45:18). Similar bowls are known on Cyprus, in both Proto- White-Painted and White-Painted I-II wares; our fragments should probably be attributed to the latter group.209 Such bowls were found at Megiddo Stratum VIA, Tell el-Far'ah (S) Tomb 506, and at Tell Jeri- sheh, as well as at Tyre Stratum XIII (11th century B.C.).210 The Tell el-Far'ah (S) tomb is probably con- temporaneous with Tell Qasile Stratum X and Megiddo Stratum VIA, since it includes a jug of the latest phase of Philistine pottery. The bowl from this tomb was identified by Gjerstad as White-Painted I, as might be the case with our fragments. Barrel-shaped juglets of White-Painted I-II ware are more common than bowls among the imports to Palestine during this period. Such juglets have been found in clear contexts of the late 1 1th century B.C.211 These finds show that White-Painted ware was exported to Palestine during the second half of the 11th century B.C., though in limited numbers. For the chronology of this group, see below, pp. 125. 209. Salamina, PI. 39: 199, 201, 205. 210. Megiddo II, PI. 78: 20; Beth-Pelet I, PI. XXXI: 325 (CPP, 29 Q2; Amiran [1969], PI. 97: 1-2); Tyre, p. 53, PI. XXXIV: 2-4. The bowl from Tell Jerisheh is in the collections of the Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University, Jerusa- lem (unpublished). 211. Examples are known from Achzib, Tel Zeror, Azor, Tell Jemmeh and Tell el-Far'ah (S). Fragments of White Painted vessels were found at Tell el-Fûl, Beth-Shemesh (Tomb 1) and Beth-Shan Strata VI and IV. A body of a White Painted juglet with hemispherical body was found in Area A at Tell Qasile (unpublished); see CPP , 86 A-D, F-J; Tel Zeror II, Pl. X: 3; Azor, Pl. 34:5; Gibeah, p. 24. For a general discus- sion of the group, see Tel Mevorakh, pp. 57-59. 81</page><page sequence="88">Black-on-Red I (III) juglets.212 Only two neck fragments of Black-on-Red juglets were found in Area C. Fig. 57:30, a fragment of a neck, was found above the top of Wall 511, the northern wall of Temple 131, and above the destruc- tion layer of Stratum X, in a level matching a Strata IX-VIII floor north of the building. The fragment is made of well-levigated, well-fired clay (with no black core). The other fragment, the upper part of a similar juglet (not included in the pottery Figures), was found in an unstratified wash, close to the surface. The fact that the only fragment of this ware was found in a context later than Stratum X, and that the ware is absent among the vast number of vessels (including Phoenician import) found in Stratum X, is an important indicator for establishing the date of this group. A similar situation exists at Megiddo, where Black-on-Red ware is missing in Stratum VIA, yet appears in Stratum VB.213 This contradicts Albright's conclusions, based on his excavations at Tell Beit Mirsim, where he attributed two fragments of Black-on-Red juglets to a house of Stratum B2, in which decorated Philistine pottery was also found.214 Albright thus dated the appearance of this ware to the 11th century B.C., and in this he was followed by Wright, who attributed such a juglet to Beth- Shemesh Stratum III.215 Van Beek agreed to this early date for the Black-on-Red group, basing on further evidence from Beth-Zur, Ashkelon and Gezer Tomb 59, which led him to assume that Black-on-Red juglets appeared together with Philistine decorated pottery.216 Yet the stratigraphie situation at these three sites is even less clear than that at Beth-Shemesh and Tell Beit Mirsim. In fact, most of the juglets and bowls of this ware were found in 10th century B.C. contexts. Some may be dated to the early part of the 10th century B.C. (such as those of Megiddo Stratum VB, some of those at Tell el-Far'ah (S), Tel Zeror (Tombs III-IV), probably a juglet from Beth-Shan Lower Stratum V and some of the juglets at Lachish and Tell el-Ajjul),217 while others are from the latter half of the 10th century B.C. (Megiddo Strata IVB- VA, Tell Abu-Hawam Stratum III, Tell Keisan Stra- tum 8, Tel Amai Stratum III, Tell en-Nasbeh tombs and a tomb at Lahav). During the 9th century B.C., the juglets with one handle became scarce, as can be learned from the few examples at Samaria and Al- Mina Stratum VIII (and not later!).218 The finds on Cyprus were discussed by J. Birmingham, who claims that the peak of distribution of such juglets on the island was in the 10th century B.C.; however, they continued in smaller numbers until the 7th century B.C.219 The origin of this group, its region of manufacture and its significance for study of the process of Phoeni- cian colonization in Cyprus are problems outside the scope of this study.220 SUMMARY OF THE DECORATIVE TECHNIQUES AT TELL QASILE The above discussion of the pottery was based on a typological classification based on the criteria of form. Though the various decorative techniques were explained in the discussion of each type, they should be surveyed in a more systematic manner. a. Red painting on buff background . This decorative technique, not very common, is found on some of the bowls and on most of the lentoid flasks, decorated with red spirals or concen- tric circles. 212.

The two examples are from Loci 1707 and 1710, which predates Palace 1723 and thus can safely be attributed to Stratum VB. At Tell Keisan, black on red does not appear in the rich assemblages of Stratum 9 (11th century B.C.), but in Stratum 8 (10th century B.C.); see Tell Keisan , pp. 194-195, PI. 56: 1-2. 214.

The origin of the Black on Red group is disputed. Joan du Plat-Taylor suggests that it originated in southern Phoeni- cia, while Suzan Chapman and P. Bikai regard it as foreign to Phoenicia proper (Chapman [1972], pp. 142-143; 170- 171; 194; Tyre, p. 53). Thus, the origin of this group remains a mystery. Could it have originated in the Acre Plain and the Carmel region? In any case it must be Levantine in origin, passing to Cyprus with the massive Phoenician immigration there during the 10th century B.C., as sug- gested by Birmingham. The continuation of production of Black on Red ware in Cyprus later than the 10th century B.C. was the result of this massive Phoenician colonisation. 82</page><page sequence="89">b. Black and red decoration on buff background. The decoration is applied onto the surface without a slip. This is the most common Late Bronze Age decorative technique, and it continues in the Iron Age I, specially in the Valley of Jezreel and along the Coastal Plain. At Tell Qasile it appears in Strata XII-X. For Stratum XII, see Figs. 12:20; 15:27; 16:4, and a tree motif within a bowl, Fig. 15:17. For Stra- tum XI, see the bowls in Figs. 18:5, 10; 22:1 1; 29:2, 5; jug, Fig. 30:10; deep krater, Fig. 30:12. For Stratum X, see the amphoriskoi, Fig. 34:21-22; flask, Fig. 36:9; jugs, Figs. 41:9; 49:2-4; and jar, Fig. 47:12. The technique disappears in Stratum IX. A similar devel- opment can be observed at Megiddo, where red and black decoration is common until Stratum VIA. c. Red slip , hand burnish and black decoration. The technique of black decoration on a red slip is most characteristic of the pottery of Tell Qasile Strata XI-X. The earliest example appears already in Stra- tum XII (Fig. 11:6), but in Stratum XI it became common. Various vessels of this stratum are so deco- rated: bowls, jugs or goblets (Figs. 20:5-6; 23:19); flasks (Fig. 20:13); small jars (Fig. 26:17); pyxis (Fig. 27:21); bottle (Fig. 30:21) and the unique vessel in Fig. 31:6. Some typical Philistine shapes are also decorated in this manner: bell-shaped bowls (Figs. 25:1 1; 29:14-15) and a bottle (Fig. 30:22). The unique small amphoriskos (Fig. 19:42) is decorated in the same technique, yet with the unusual addition of concentric semi-circles in Philistine tradition. The treatment of the surface of this pottery in Stratum XI includes an uneven red slip in various dark shades (Munsell colour charts: 2.5YR 5/4 "reddish brown"; 5 YR 4/4 "reddish brown"; 2.5 YR 4/4 "reddish brown"; 2.5 YR 6/8 "light red"; 2.5 YR 3/6 "dark red"). In Stratum XI, the red slip usually remained unburnished, yet in a few cases there is a slight hand- burnishing on the bowls. In Stratum X the appearance of a red slip is more consistent; the black decoration is very common and the hand-burnishing becomes most common. The slip is in many cases darker than in Stratum XI, and the burnishing is done in a characteristic technique, defined as "chordal burnishing" by Albright. Where possible, the burnishing follows the contours of the vessels: thus it is horizontal on the outside and inside of bowl rims (but never executed on the wheel!), and vertical on jug necks and bodies. On the lower parts of bowls, both inside and out, the burnishing becomes irregular, sometimes very dense and other times sparse (Photos 20, 22, 25, 27). Examples can be found on various bowls (including a bell-shaped bowl, Fig. 29:19), on jugs of Type JG 5c (Philistine jugs of Type 1 6, according to Dothan's classification; Figs. 35:2-3; 36:1; 50:2); kraters of Type KR lb (Dothan's Type 17); globular goblet (Fig. 40: 14) and spout (Fig. 43:7). Some of the vessels lack the black decoration, yet are red slipped and hand burnished. In Strata IX-VIII we have only a red slip and hand burnishing, while the black decoration disappears, so far as could be judged from the small amount of pottery there. The red slip in these strata is thick and dark, and the hand burnishing consistent and dense. The best parallel for a similar development in decorative technique is found at Gezer, where the red slip begins its appearance in Stratum XII, the second Philistine stratum, parallel to Stratum XI at Tell Qasile.221 In the final report, the excavators of Gezer attribute the appearance of hand-burnishing to Stra- tum VIII, the Solomonic stratum at Gezer.222 This late date contradicts the evidence from our excava- tions, yet examination of the pottery Figures shows that hand burnishing can be found already in Strata XII and XI, corresponding to our Strata XI-X.223 At Megiddo Strata VIA-B there are several examples of a red slip and hand-burnishing on jugs and goblets, yet it is lacking on bowls. At Beth-Shan Stratum VI there are a few closed vessels with red slip, but none is burnished, and there is no red slip on bowls; in Lower Stratum V, however, there are many red slipped and burnished vessels, which should be parallelled to Strata X-IX at Tell Qasile. The technique of black decoration on a red slip in unknown in the northern part of the country. At Taanach the red slip and burnishing is completely lacking in Period I (12th century B.C.) and appears for the first time in Period II (10th century B.C.). Rast suggested that the tech- nique of burnished red slip originated in the Aramean culture of Syria, and that it was brought to Israel during the period of Israelite hegemony over Syria, under David and Solomon.224 This suggestion cannot be accepted in the light of the development traced at Tell Qasile, which illustrates the popularity of the burnished red slip in the central Coastal Plain of Palestine already during the 1 1th century B.C. Yet it should be emphasized that at Ashdod, the only major 221. Gezer 2 (. HUC ), p. 56. 222. Gezer 1 (HUC), p. 61; Gezer 2 (HUC), p. 59. 223. Ibid., Pis. 25: 18; 28: 15-17; 30: 3, 16. 224. Taanach, p. 21. 83</page><page sequence="90">site excavated in Philistia proper, red slip and black decoration appear already in Stratum X, in which decorated Philistine ware ceases to appear. It seems that this stratum corresponds with the end of our Tell Qasile Stratum X and Stratum IX. But whereas at Tell Qasile the black decoration disappears in Stra- tum IX, it became popular in the Iron Age II strata at Ashdod.225 At Tel Masos, a red slip appears on three vessels from Stratum III (unburnished), while in Stratum II among the published pottery there are nine vessels with red slip but not burnished, 23 vessels with a burnished red slip and four examples of burnished red slip with black decoration, resembling vessels from Tell Qasile.226 The last four were found in Tel Masos Area H, where imported Phoenician vessels were also found; they may have been imported from the region of Tell Qasile. The relatively large number of vessels with red slip in Stratum II at Tel Masos indicates the popularity of this technique in the southern part of the country in the late 11th century B.C., and emphasizes the close relationship between the pottery assemblage of Tel Masos and the assem- blages of Philistia, including Tell Qasile. The technique of black decoration on a red slip is known on a few vessels in the Phoenician tombs at Lebanon. Chapman defined these vessels as local imitations of "Black-on-Red ware", yet there is no connection in form between the two and these few vessels are probably evidence for relations with cen- tral Palestine, just like the Phoenician "Bichrome" vessels found at Tell Qasile.227 The relationship between the technique of black decoration on a red slip and the origin of the Cypro- Phoenician Black-on-Red group should be consi- dered. It might be argued that the former technique is the predecessor which led to the development of the distinctive Black-on-Red technique, probably some- where along the southern Phoenician littoral. d. The Phoenician Bichrome group .228 The decorative technique of this group has been explained in the descriptions of the various vessels (above, pp. 65-69, 75). Most characteristic is the combination of a wide red band between two nar- rower black lines. The combination appears both in horizontal bands and as concentric circles. Addi- tional motifs, such as lozenges and Maltese crosses, appear below handles, on shoulders and in metopes. In the discussion of the jugs of this group we noted the two qualities among the vessels of this group: those with yellowish-creamy slip, continuously bur- nished; and those lacking such a slip, where the deco- ration is applied straight onto the plain body. While the first is definitely a Phoenician technique and the vessels must have been imported, the latter may be a local imitation. In principle, the Bichrome vessels appear only in Stratum X, yet one bowl from Stratum XI (Fig. 18:9) has the typical group of bands charac- terizing our group, and thus may be regarded the earliest example of this decorative technique. The examples from Stratum X are as follows: Globular jugs: Figs. 41:11, 13; 45:15 (above p. 67). Strainer jug: Fig.41 : 12 (above, p. 65). Globular flasks: Figs. 36:8; 37:7 (above, p. 00). A jug or goblet neck: Fig. 43:24. A fragment of a goblet (?) base: Fig. 23:6. A body fragment: Fig. 23:24. The chronology and geographic distribution of the various types in this family have been discussed in the typological discussion (above, pp. 65-69, 75-77). It should be emphasized that while in Phoenicia, its country of origin, the Bichrome technique appears already in the 12th century B.C. (Tyre Stratum XIV and Stratum XV), in Israel (including such a clearly Phoenician site as Tell Keisan) it does not appear before the 11th century B.C., and its main distribu- tion was from the mid-1 1th century B.C. on. We have outlined above (p. 69) the inner chronological devel- opment, based on the change from true globular- shaped jugs, made as flasks, to jugs made on the wheel as a single unit, with a ring base. This change took place during the first half of the 10th century B.C. The distribution of this group is along the Phoeni- cian coast, from Tell Sukas in the north to Tell Keisan and Tell Abu-Hawam in the south,229 as well as in the Beqeah (Horns region) and the Amuq.230 Vessels of this group were exported from the Phoenician coast 225.

Black decoration on light background. Two composite flasks (Figs. 42:10, 1 1) are decorated in black on a buff slip. A similar technique is known in a group of 1 1th- 10th century B.C. Phoenician vessels, such as some of the flasks from Achzib, a few vessels from Lebanon, and Phoenician flasks from Early Geometric tombs on Cyprus. This is a Phoeni- cian technique, accompanying the Bichrome tech- nique,232 and should be related to Cypriot White Painted ware. Quantitative analysis of decoration techniques in Strata XII-X The following tables provide quantitative analysis of the distribution of decoration techniques in Strata XII-X. The analysis is based on the data in the cata- logue (pp. 133 ff), including 390 complete vessels and 2787 sherds. Complete vessels and sherds have been treated separately to prevent distortion as far as pos- sible. In some tables the data have been divided into major groups, such as 'open vessels' (bowls, kraters, chalices, goblets) and 'closed vessels' (jugs, juglets, amphoriskoi, etc.). In each of the tables the lower line in each horizontal row gives percentages. The tables were compiled and prepared by the author together with Mr. I. Sharon. These tables demonstrate the possibility of using a computerized pottery catalogue as a data base in achieving accurate results concerning various pheno- mena in pottery development. The results clearly demonstrate the complexity of the inner development of decorative treatment on pottery during a compara- tively short period of 150 years, in which three differ- ent occupation levels could be traced with no clear-cut break in development of the material cul- ture. In such a case, only a quantitative analysis based on a large, stratified sampling can provide a signifi- cant picture concerning the trends and fashions of the potters. In our case, the tables reveal the changing figures (in percentages of the total sample analyzed) concerning the development of some important phenomena in the decorative treatment of pottery in these three strata. The mere outward criteria of "appearance" or "lack" of such features as red slip, 231. Birmingham (1963), pp. 36-39, with earlier bibliography. 232. Chapman (1972), pp. 159-160. hand-burnishing, etc., are insufficient for minute analysis of the chronological development. The pro- portion between these features must be analyzed; such analysis reveals continuity of traditions during the entire period, yet changing proportions demon- strate tendencies during the specific period under survey on our site.

This detailed analysis of form and decorative mo- tifs provides an excellent starting point for a discus- sion of similar ware found at the sanctuary of Tell Qasile. We have thus prepared the following chapter as a straightforward continuation of Dothan's dis- cussion, using the same terminology and type numbers.1 The numerous references to this book are cited within the text, prefixed by PMC. Dothan's division of the Philistine pottery into three successive phases {PMC, pp. 94-96) was based, to a large extent, on the results of the earlier excavations at Tell Qasile, especially in Area A. The numerous decorated vessels found at Area C now provide an opportunity to review that division and, as we shall see, our finds contradict some of the basic results of the excavations in Area A, specially concerning the appearance of Philistine vessels in Stratum X. The 18 types defined by Dothan can be divided into two major groups: (a) Types 1-12 (Groups I-III), vessels with foreign shapes, either of Mycenean, Cypriot or Egyptian derivation; (b) Types 13-18, vessels of common local Iron Age I form, usually preserving the Late Bronze Age tradi- tion. While vessels of the first group are characteristic of Philistine ware and seldom appear without Philis- tine decoration, vessels of the second group com- monly appear without Philistine decoration, and only sporadically, in those cases mentioned by Dothan, were they decorated in the Philistine style. This latter group, it appears to me, is not organic to the Philistine ware: it rather illustrates the diffusion 1. It should be noted that the type numbers in the English edition, cited in our discussion, slightly differ from those in the Hebrew edition. of traditions during the Iron Age I, where local shapes were occasionally utilized by the Philistine potters. In Area C we found some additional local shapes decorated in the Philistine style: a globular goblet (Fig. 32: 7); flasks (Figs. 24:20; 36:10, ll),anampho- riskos (Fig. 19: 42) and a cylindrical cult stand ( Tell Qasile 1, p. 91, Fig. 25). Two other important additions to the repertoire of Philistine shapes should be mentioned: Fig. 11:26 from Stratum XII, a composite "pyxis-flask" with concave body, relating it to the pinched-body juglet (Type 8 in PMC); Figs. 35: 1 and 51:1, jugs with strainer spout and basket handle, previously known only as Dothan's Type 16, attributed to the third phase of the Philistine pottery, and now appearing with rich Philistine decoration in red and black; these can be considered as prototypes of Type 17. Neutron activation analysis carried out on a sam- ple collection of sherds from Area C (Chapter XXI) has shown that both local undecorated ware and Philistine decorated ware were made of the same local clay, and probably both classes of pottery were produced in the same workshops at Tell Qasile. Table 8 (on p. 88) summarizes the distribution of Philistine vessels represented in the Pottery Figures (including all the complete vessels and a selection of sherds) amongst the major architectural units of Strata XII-X. DISCUSSION OF TYPES The following discussion of the types follows the order of Dothan's classification; here, only additions to or divergences from Dothan's discussion are noted. Type 1.

Out of 61 complete Philistine vessels which appear in the Figures, 23 are such bowls. Most of the bowls are 18 cm in diameter and their average height is ca. 10 cm; the bowls from Room 188 are smaller: 10-12 cm in diameter and 7-8 cm average height; these latter may have been offering bowls produced especially for this purpose. 2. Bell-shaped bowls with red slip appear at Ashdod Strata XII-XI; see Ashdod II-III, Fig. 74: 2-3. 88 According to the results of the previous excavations such bowls should not appear in Stratum X. However, we have found a large group of such bowls in Room 188, the repository of Temple 131; in other words, at least early in the life of Temple 131, such bowls were in use. The fact that they were not found on the floor of the Temple or in Building 225 shows that they perhaps went out of use within the span of Stratum X. A less plausible probability is that the bowls from Room 188 were originally produced in the previous stratum. A development in the treatment of the surface can be observed. Most of the examples from Stratum XII are white slipped. A similar slip continues in Stratum XI on some of the bowls, while other bowls from this stratum are either left without slip or have an unburnished red slip with black decoration.2 Only a few of the bowls from Stratum X still have a white wash. Dothan emphasized the fact that most of these bowls outside Tell Qasile are decorated in only one colour, yet many of the examples from Strata XII-XI</page><page sequence="95">Photo 87.

Such a table can give only a general impression and should not be regarded as a statistical presentation.) Of the three decorative groups of bowls as defined by Dothan, the dominant one in our excavation, as at other sites, is Group 2 (pairs of spirals), while bowls of Group 1 (horizontal bands only) are almost entirely absent. Note four examples of complete bowls with true antithetic spirals (Figs. 19: 1; 22: 28; 24: 13; 43: 13), rare in the Philistine decorative style (Group 3); in most of our examples the spirals turn in the same direction, as is common in this style. A star within a circle (Fig. 17: 11) and a ladder pattern connecting two spirals (Figs. 22: 28; 43: 13) are variations unparallelled elsewhere. Dothan has argued for a morphological development of these bowls, from the elegant, rounded bell-shaped bowl to a later, clumsier and heavier shape, appearing during the 11th century B.C. Such a development does not find justification among our finds. The bowls from Stratum X do not differ in shape or decoration from their predecessors. It appears that the heavy, clumsy body is a geographical rather than chronological distinction, for it is known mainly in Northern Palestine.4 An important new feature is the appearance of red- slipped bell-shaped bowls with black painted spirals, already in Stratum XI (Figs. 25: 11; 29: 14, 15) as well as in Stratum X. A few bowls are variants of this form: Figs. 29: 18-19 (Stratum XI) and 46: 5 (Stratum X). Bowls with rounded, low carination and vertical rim. In two cases the carination is emphasized by a slight curve and the bowl is decorated with horizontal bichrome bands, while in the third (Fig. 29: 19), red slipped and decorated with black thin lines, the carination is almost unfelt. All three bowls are local variations, unparallelled elsewhere. Fig. 34: 10 (Room 188) is a bowl with sharply carinated body and two horizontal handles. It is red slipped and decorated with a black star design and small black lines on the handles. This form is a mediate form between bell-shaped bowls and carinated bowls of Type BL 8. Fig. 34:11 (from Pit 125, Stratum XI) is perhaps a "bell-shaped" bowl with red slip and horizontal burnish. Fig. 46:5 is another variant of the "bell-shaped" bowl. Here the rim is vertical, two horizontal handles are attached to the body above a sharp carination. The bowl is decorated in horizontal black and red bands; this shape is unique. Fig. 45: 10 from Stratum X is the only example of a degenerate horizontal handle on a rounded bowl, and may be considered a variation of the bell-shaped bowl. Among the pottery not included in the Figures, there is only one additional degenerate horizontal handle. This shows that the distribution of the degenerate horizontal handle is a regional development rather than chronological (see above, p. 41). Type 2. Bell-shaped Krater {PMC, pp. 106-115); our Type KR 2. These kraters can be divided to two major classes, according to the shape of rim: a. Kraters with thickened rim (Photo 88). Stratum XII: Figs. 13: 15-16, 18-19, 24-28; 14: 1; 15: 23-25; 16: 22, 25; 17: 18. Stratum XI: Figs. 23: 2, 4; 27:11. Stratum X: Fig. 40: 5. b. Krater with everted rim.

Stratum X: Figs. 44: 23 (variant); 46: 6, 7 (two complete kraters from Building 225). 3. Almost half of the bowls of this type from Ashdod are decorated in two colours; Ashdod I, Fig. 28: 7, 13, 14; Ashdod II-III, Fig. 101: 8. 4.

Most of the examples are fragments, except two complete vessels from Stratum X. The number of sherds decreases from Stratum XII to Stratum X. The two examples from Stratum X show a degeneration of the decoration. Since most of the material is sherds, it is impossible to analyse the decoration of many of them. Stylistic attribution following Dothan can be applied only in the following cases: Group 1: Krater decorated with painted bands only. Fig. 16: 10 (Stratum XII); Fig. 44: 23 (Stra- tum X). Group 2: Metopes. Fig. 17: 18 (Stratum XII). A fragment decorated with triglyphs made of vertical lines. The sole pre- served metope is decorated with a geometric motif, quite rare in Philistine pottery; examples are known on a jug from Beth-Shemesh {PMC, p. 134, Fig. 22: 1, PI. 50), a krater from Megiddo ( PMC , p. 77, PI. 19: 5) and two fragments from Ashdod.5 The Beth-Shemesh jug was attributed by Dothan to the first phase of the Philistine pottery, which parallels our Stratum XII. Fig. 27: 11 (Stratum XI). A large fragment of a krater decorated with a frieze, of which a triglyph and parts of two metopes are preserved. The triglyph is made of 14 parallel vertical lines, one of the metopes is filled with a Maltese cross and the other with an exceptional bird, with a head turning backwards. The wing is much larger than usual on Philistine birds, and it has an unusual central vertical line. The back leg starts in the area of the tail instead of at the central part of the body. These unique features are probably results of clumsiness in execution of the decoration. Fig. 46: 7 (Stratum X). The decoration of this krater demonstrates the degeneration of the triglyph and metope motif in Stratum X. The triglyphs are made of groups of three or four vertical lines, and the metopes are filled with a simple geometric design. A parallel to this concept can be found in a krater from Azor (PMC, p. Ill, PI. 16). Group 3: "Freestanding Facial". Fig. 16:9 (Stratum XII). The decoration is com- posed of two spirals divided by a rhomb with a loop above it (compare PMC , p. 110, PI. 10; an exact 5. Ashdod I, Fig. 29: 2, 5; Ashdod II-III, Fig. 73: 2 (stylized). 91</page><page sequence="98">parallel is lacking). Fragments of other kraters deco- rated with spirals can also be attributed to this group; see: Figs. 13:17, 18, 21, 23, 25; 15: 24; 16:22 (Stratum XII); Fig. 26: 18 (Stratum XI); Fig. 40: 5 (Stratum X). Group 4: The decoration of the krater in Fig. 46: 6 (Stratum X) is the only example on Philistine kraters of this type of a frieze of isolated spirals painted in black (compare PMC , p. 108, Fig. 11). It is important as a link between pure Philistine decoration and the deco- ration on the Kraters of Type 18 (see above, p. 45). Type 3. Stirrup Jars {PMC, pp. 1 15-125) (Photos 89- 90). Fourteen complete or almost complete decorated stirrup jars were found in Area C. This doubles the number of such stirrup jars known from previous excavations in the whole Philistine repertoire. Stratum XI: Fig. 21 (two jars from Temple 200). Fig. 31: 2 (a jar from Pit 125). Stratum X: Fig. 37: 16, Fig. 38 (6 jars from Room 188, Temple 131). Fig. 51: 2-6 (5 jars from Building 225, four of them found in Room 171; the last in Room 187). The average height of these jars is 18 cm; the spout is high, reaching the top of the false spout. The jars of Stratum XI and some of those of Stratum X (in Room 188) have a globular body, while others from Room 188 and all those from Building 225 have a piriform body. All the jars have a ring base and a knob at the top of the false spout. The workmanship is very homogeneous. Fig. 37: 16 is of outstanding shape, and is smaller and narrower than the others of this group. Some of the jars, including those from Build- ing 225, have a whitish-grey slip which sometimes peels off. The decoration of our jars is in accord with the definitions of Dothan {PMC, p. 123). A spiral, usu- ally in red, decorates the top of the false spout. The handles and spout are painted in short horizontal black lines (except in Fig. 21: 1, where the lines are in red). The zone between the handles is usually deco- rated with two groups of concentric half-circles, flanking the spout and connected by a wavy line (Figs. 38: 3, 4; 51: 3), a wavy line combined with horizontal lines (Fig. 51: 4), horizontal lines only (Fig. 51: 6) or a plain area. The zone between the handles, opposite the spout, is decorated with two groups of concentric half-circles connected by a chev- ron pattern (Fig. 21: 1), parts of concentric circles (Figs. 38: 1; 51: 6), horizontal lines (Fig. 31:2) or horizontal lines with wavy lines between them (Fig. 51:2, 4). The half-circles are usually in black with a red fill. The central decorative zone on the body of the stirrup jars is bordered on either side by 3-4 parallel lines in red paint. Their decoration is as follows: Fig. 21:1. Triglyphs made of groups of vertical lines with a regular or elongated "B" pattern between them, creating square metopes containing "hour- glass" patterns. A similar pattern also appears on krater Fig. 17: 18 from Stratum XII, yet there it is stylized, similar to the decoration on a cylindrical stand from Shrine 300, 6 and on the stirrup jar in Fig. 38:1. Similar triglyphs appear on a stirrup jar from Azor {PMC, p. 117, Fig. 15: 1). Fig. 21: 2. The decorative frieze is almost totally lost. One of the metopes contains a bird with its head turned back, similar in detail to a bird on a stirrup jar from Beth-Shemesh {PMC, p. 118, Fig. 16: 1). The details of the bird's body are unusual for the Philis- tine style; the poor state of preservation precludes a sure reconstruction. The other metope shows remains of a net pattern. Fig. 31:2. The upper part of a stirrup jar; only part of the main frieze is preserved, including triglyphs of vertical lines and a "B" pattern. One metope includes a net pattern and two others include a lozenge filled with net pattern, with black half-circles filled with red paint in the corners (compare PMC, p. 213, Fig. 70:6). Fig. 38: 1. The triglyphs of the main frieze are of vertical lines with a central line of zigzag, creating triangles. Most of the metopes are filled with isolated spirals, yet the two metopes at the centre of the body, below the handles, are decorated with an "hour- glass" pattern in black, with two of the triangles filled in red. The handles are decorated with short alternat- ing black and red lines. Fig. 38: 2. Most of the decoration has disappeared except one triglyph of vertical lines, and horizontal wavy lines bordering the frieze above and below. Figs. 38: 3; 51:3. The main frieze of these two almost identical jars is composed of groups of vertical lines, a "B" pattern and a ladder pattern, with no clear division into metopes. A similar decoration appears on a jar from Beth-Shemesh {PMC, p. 118, Fig. 16: 5). 6. Tell Qasile 1, p. 91, Fig. 25. 92</page><page sequence="99">Photo 89.

The main frieze of these two jars is composed of groups of black diagonal lines creating zigzags, with red filling in the triangles above and below the frieze. A similar decoration appears on two stirrup jars from Tell el-Far4ah (S) and Beth- Shemesh. The former (PMC, p. 119, Fig. 17: 1) was attributed by Dothan to the first phase of the Philis- tine pottery (12th century B.C.); in her analysis of the motifs, however, Dothan claims that this design reflects a late development in Philistine decoration (PMC, p. 214), as indeed fits the rather late date of our two jars. The motif appears on stirrup jars of Mycenean UIC war , as well as on Cypriot stirrup jars of Proto- White Printed Ware.7 Figs. 37: 16; 51* 2, 5, 6. The main frieze of these four jars is filled with a net pattern. In two cases the pattern is in black only (Figs. 37: 16 and 51: 5), while in the other two it is in black and red. Parallels for such a use of the net pattern are found on two jugs from Megiddo and Tell el-Far'ah (S) (PMC, p. 136, 7. Opuscula Archeologica 3 (1944), p. 241. 94</page><page sequence="101">Fig 26), on a double pyxis from Megiddo Stratum VI {PMC, p. 126, Fig. 18:8) and on a body fragment from our excavations (Fig. 19: 41). A continuous net pat- tern also appears as part of a more composite decora- tion, as on the "Orpheus Jug" from Megiddo (PMC, p. 136, Fig. 28: 1). Most of the parallels are from Megiddo Stratum VI, and are contemporaneous with our jars. A similar decoration appears on two addi- tional fragments from our excavation: Figs. 30: 15 and 43: 10, probably jug fragments. Fig. 51:4. The main frieze is decorated with a row of reversed, elongated triangles, alternatively in black and red. Such a use of this pattern is known only on the "Orpheus Jug" from Megiddo Stratum VI (PMC, p. 136, Fig. 28:1); in our excavation it appears also on three base fragments of goblets (p. 101). Above we noted the development in form from Stratum XI to Stratum X; we should append to this the development in decoration: in Stratum X the main frieze tends to be filled with repetitive designs, occupying the entire field (net pattern or triangles), and the bird motif disappears. The rather large number of stirrup jars in Stratum X decorated in good Philistine* style is surprising, especially in the light of the few such vessels in the rich assemblages of Stratum X in Area A. Dothan assumed, on the basis of the previous excavations, that stirrup jars ceased to be in use during what she defined as the third phase of the Philistine ware. It may be claimed, theoretically, that the jars from Room 188 are heirlooms from the previous temple, yet this explanation cannot be valid when we consider the finds from Building 225, where the jars were found in the final destruction level of the dwelling, on the floor of a living room. There is no reason to assume that the five jars of this type found in Building 225 were all "heirlooms", and thus we tend to con- clude that such jars were still produced during the span of Stratum X. Type 4. Pyxis (PMC, pp. 125-131). The assemblages from Area C did not contain decorated pyxides, except for one from Stratum IX (Fig. 52: 7), decorated with a few red lines. Its strati- graphic context is not clear and it could be attributed to Stratum X. For the hybrid vessel in Fig. 1 1: 26, see p. 98, below. Type 6. Strainer-spout jugs with handle from rim (PMCt pp. 132-155; our Type JG 5A, see pp. 64, above). These jugs, which are common in the Philistine pottery, were almost unrepresented at Tell Qasile. One fragment from the previous excavations was published by Dothan (PMC, p. 142, PI. 55, p. 149) and only a few fragments from our excavations ^)uld be attributed to this type: Fig. 15: 19, 32 (the latter with a checkerboard pattern), both from Stratum XII, and Fig. 26: 8, a body fragment with a bird motif, from Stratum XI. In the previous chapter we mentioned two strainer jugs from Stratum X (Figs. 41:12 and 50:1, above pp. 64, 65), one decorated solely with red stripes and the other, which has a handle attached to the middle of the neck, decorated in the Phoenician "Bichrome" style. Type 6A. Strainer jug with basket handle. Trude Dothan included strainer jugs with a basket handle in Type 17, which includes mainly red-slipped jugs attributed by her to the third phase of the Philis- tine pottery, as well as one of the jugs discussed below Photo 91. Strainer jug (Fig. 35:1). 95</page><page sequence="102">Fig. 35:1) and probably also the "Orpheus Jug" from Megiddo (PMC, pp. 149-153). We prefer to include these last vessels, as well as another jug from Stratum X, in a sub-type of the Philistine strainer jugs, for they are decorated in the pure Philis- tine style, unlike most of the vessels included by Dothan in Types 17-18. The "Orpheus Jug" from Megiddo Stratum VI (PMC, pp. 149-153) should be added to this small group, as the only other example of such a jug found outside Tell Qasile. Fig. 35:1 (Photo 91). A jug from Locus 188, Tem- ple 134, Stratum X (PMC, p. 194), one of the superb examples of Philistine vessels found at Tell Qasile. It is 31 cm high; the funnel-shaped rim has an inner strainer at the neck.8 The basket handle, attached to the rim, is decorated with black lines and a spiral at the top, the latter drawn as if extending beyond the outer lines of the handle. The rounded body, conical neck and large spout are painted in Philistine style. The main frieze, bordered above and below by dense groups of horizontal red lines, is divided into seven metopes by triglyphs made of groups of vertical lines. The central metope includes the strainer spout, deco- rated with black lines and below it vertical black lines. The two metopes flanking the strainer are deco- rated with a vertical motif of black and red elongated triangles, explained by Dothan as a degenerated form of the stylized lotus flower motif (PMC, p. 215). There is no parallel in the Philistine repertoire for the vertical arrangement of this motif, as on our vessel, though the motif itself is well known on other Philis- tine vessels (PMC, p. 105, Fig. 8: 1-2; p. 116, Fig. 16:1; p. 158, Fig. 34:4; and below, p. 105). The next two metopes contain checkerboard motifs in red and black; in one metope the arrangement is parallel to the frieze, while in the other it is oblique, creating a net of lozenges (PMC, p. 214). The metope opposite the strainer spout contains five diagonal bands of chevrons in black. Though chevrons are quite com- mon in Philistine ware (PMC, pp. 212-214) there is no parallel for a similar use of this motif as a filler of an entire metope. The frieze is bordered above by a band of concentric half-circles, covering the join between the body and the neck. This jug is outstanding among the Philistine pot- tery in both its shape and the unusual use of its motifs, which are otherwise well known in the Philis- tine style. The fact that it was found in Stratum X Photo 92. Strainer jug (Fig. 51:1). (though in an early phase of this stratum, represented by Locus 1 88, where the jug was found) illustrates the flourishing of the Philistine style in Stratum X, at least early in its span. Fig. 51:1 (Locus 168, Building 225, Stratum X) (Photo 92). This jug has a rounded, slightly elongated body with a prominent shoulder; the neck and rim have not been preserved, but there must have been a basket handle, for there is no trace of any attachment of a handle to the body. The shape is similar to the "Orpheus Jug" from Megiddo Stratum VI (PMC, p. 138, Fig. 28), which is also lacking its neck but which probably also had a basket handle (PMC, p. 150, n. 75).9 Like the "Orpheus Jug", our example had a rich Philistine decoration painted on the plain, unslipped body. Three red bands on the central part of the body, and three parallel bands at the join between the body and the neck, bound a frieze of four metopes 8. A similar rim appears on a jug from Beth-Shemesh III; Beth-Shemesh IV, PI. LX: 18. 9. A red-slipped jug from Building 225 is of similar profile (Fig. 50: 2). For additional parallels, see CPP , 67 P(Tell el-Far'ah, Tomb 523) and 67 S2 (Tell es-Safi). 96</page><page sequence="103">and four triglyphs (each of seven vertical lines). One of the metopes contains the strainer spout, while the others are divided by black horizontal lines into two panels, the upper one with a row of black and red triangles, and the other with three concentric half- circles in black, their centres filled in red. Seven such half-circles decorate a band above the frieze, at the lower part of the neck. The spout is decorated with black and red lines. This decoration recalls the pre- vious jug in many aspects, and the two were probably painted by the same artist. The division of the metopes into two panels is parallelled on only a few other Philistine vessels (PMC, p. 107, Fig. 8: 1-2; p. 118, Fig. 16: 1), all of which include the triangles motif. The red filling of the centres of the concentric half-circles is unparallelled elsewhere. An unusual strainer jug: Fig. 24: 19, Locus 244 (Stratum XI) (Photo 93). Only the lower part of this jug was preserved, and thus the shape of the neck and handle are unknown. The body is carinated low down. The diameter of the vessel at the carination is 17.5 cm. The part of the body above the carination is wavy: three horizontal depressions all along the body form two rounded ridges, each decorated with a band of chevrons, one half of which is painted black and the other red. Red lines separate the chevrons into two and separate between the various chevron bands. A small piece of the neck is still preserved, decorated with a net pattern in red and black. The use of chevrons as the main motif on the body of a vessel is unknown in the Philistine style. There are only a few vessels (two stirrup jars and a jug, PMC, p. 119, Fig. 17: 3-5; p. 175, Fig. 47:1) where the Photo 93. Strainer jug (Fig. 24:19). Photo 94. Spouted jug (Fig. 30:11). chevron appears as a central motif. However, at Tell Qasile itself there is the "conch shaped" cult vessel from Stratum XI, decorated in the same manner.10 Body fragments of another vessel with wavy profile and chevron decoration in a similar style were found in Pit 125 and in its vicinity (not included in the Figures). These three vessels were probably produced by a local artist during Stratum XI. Type 7. Jug with basket handle and cylindrical spout {PMC, pp. 155-157). Fig. 30: 11 (Pit 125, Stratum XI) (Photo 94).A jug with rounded body and basket handle. Though the spout was not preserved, traces of it show that it was rounded and narrow. Similar jugs were found in Area A at Tell Qasile, as well as at Ashdod Stratum XIII and Beth-Shemesh, (PMC, p. 39, PI. 4; p. 153, Fig. 32). Like most of the other jugs in this group, this example is also decorated with horizontal bands; yet it is the only one in this group which is decorated in both red and black. In addition to the discussion of the type presented by Dothan, we should mention its appearance in Ashdod Stratum X (beginning of 10th 10. Tell Qasile 1, p. 115, Fig. 45. 97</page><page sequence="104">century B.C.) with a burnished red slip.11 A jug from Azor {PMC, Fig. 32:4) may be dated to the 10th century B.C.12 It is difficult to accept Dothan's argu- ment that the fusion of this type with strainer jugs of Type 6 resulted in the appearance of Type 17, at a later date. As we have seen (above p. 96), the two decorated strainer jugs with basket handles from our excavations (discussed above as Type 6A) can now be regarded as closer prototypes for this latter type. A number of cylindrical spouts found in Area C (Figs. 31: 9; 45: 4)may be attributed to such jugs. One of them (Fig. 43: 7) is red slipped and decorated with a "branch" motif in black.13 Type 8. Juglets with pinched body {PMC, pp. 157- 160). No examples of such juglets were found in Area C, though one example is known from Area A {PMC, p. 158, Fig. 33: 6). Fig. 11:26. Temple 319, Stratum XII (Photo 95). This is a unique vessel, which can be defined as a hybrid of a flask and a pyxis. The neck and handles are those of a flask, the body like that of a pyxis or jug, yet the central part of the body has a depression reminiscent of the pinched juglets of Dothan's Type 8. This vessel is 14.2 cm high and 1 1 cm in diameter. It is self-slipped (i.e., slipped with an emulsion in the colour of the clay itself) and decorated with a Philis- tine decoration including a group of horizontal bands on the central part of the body and a frieze on the neck composed of two half-circles, each fitting one half of the vessel, between the handles. Each half- circle has a ladder design at its top and an inner motif of alternating red and black triangles (see also PMC, p. 159). This vessel can be regarded as a"missing link" between Mycenean tradition of pyxides with concave body14 and the later Philistine "pinched" juglets.15 A vessel from Tell el-Faťah (S) {PMC, p. 158, Fig. 33:5), with a neck and rim recalling our vessel, is the only closer link between the latter and the pinched juglets. Type 9. Cylindrical bottles {PMC, pp. 160-168). Fig. 30: 22-23. Pit 125, Stratum XI. Both these bottles have vertical walls, rounded shoulder, flaring Photo 95. Pyxis-flask (Fig. 11:26). 11.

The jug from Azor was defined by M. Dothan as a Cypnot White Painted jug. It was found with a Cypro-Phoenician Black on Red juglet, and thus should be dated to the 10th century B.C.

Bottle (Fig. 17:27). rim, two horizontal handles and flat base. A fragment of a similar bottle (?) was found in Stratum XII (Fig. 17: 6). Our Fig. 30: 22 is 16.5 cm high, and 6 cm in diameter. It is red slipped, but unburnished, as is common in Stratum XI. The decoration is composed of horizontal black lines on the body and rim. The other bottle (Fig. 30:23) is 17.5 cm high and 6.5 cm in diameter. Horizontal black lines decorate the body, which was not slipped. The list of such bottles presented by Dothan can be augmented by three examples from Tell Keisan.16 These are fragments of similar undecorated bottles. In shape, our bottles recall vessels from Gezer (PMC, p. 161, Fig. 34: 3, 7, 13). A few of the bottles cited by Dothan have a red slip {PMC, p. 162, Fig. 35: 3-4), but none of them is decorated in black. Fig. 17: 27, from Locus 199, Stratum XII (Photo 96). This shape is unique in the Philistine repertoire: a Photo 97. Horn-shaped vessel (Fig. 31:1). bottle with a wide body (diameter 9 cm), horizontal, carinated shoulder, and high narrow neck. The base is not preserved and there are no traces of handles. It is thus a new variation of the Philistine bottle. Its buff surface is decorated with a frieze divided by triglyphs of seven vertical lines, but most of the frieze is missing. Type 10. "Horn-shaped vessel " {PMC, pp. 168-172). Fig. 31: 1, Pit 125, Stratum XI (Photo 97). Length 25 cm, maximal diameter 6.5 cm. This vessel, 16. Tell Keisan , PI. 61: 13; 62: 7; 65: 14. 99</page><page sequence="106">found in the rich deposit in Pit 125, is the most complete and most elaborately decorated horn- shaped vessel known in the Philistine repertoire. The elongated body is slightly convex, and there are two lug handles. The neck is long in comparison to those of the only other complete vessel of this type found in Israel (from Beth-Shemesh). Our vessel has a buff slip and is decorated with five groups of parallel red lines (each group is of four lines), bordering four registers of geometric motifs. The top and bottom registers have a frieze of triangles painted alternatively in red (outlined in black) and black. The two middle regis- ters have a frieze of elongated, narrow lozenges and concentric half-circles with red centres. The central motif of elongated lozenges should be regarded as a variation of the triangles motif, fitted to this particu- lar vessel - which was probably used horizontally. The bottle was probably intended to be used as a libation vessel in cult ceremonies, and could be hung horizontally by a cord tied to the pierced lug handles. The origin of the "horn-shaped" vessel in Cyprus during the Late Cypriot III and Cypro-Geometric periods, and its transfer to Greece in the Geometric period, have been discussed by Dothan ( PMC , pp. 171-172). One vessel from Ugarit hints at the appear- ance of this type already in the Middle Bronze Age there, but this is a unique example.17 Type 11. A gourd-shaped bottle {PMC, p. 172). Fig. 30: 21*,Pit 125, Stratum XI. Height 13.5 cm; maximal diameter 9.5 cm. This vessel has a rounded body and base, high and narrow neck, simple rim and two suspension holes near the rim. It is covered by a dark red slip (unburnished) and is decorated with a black net pattern. It recalls two bottles from Azor, included by Dothan among the Philistine pottery {PMC, Type 1 1, p. 174, Fig. 44). These are similar to ours, yet they have a flat base and are decorated with red and black decoration on a white slip. Like our vessel, they have suspension holes. As concluded by Dothan, this is a rare type, the origin of which has not been determined. Type 12. Jugs with Egyptian affinities {PMC, pp. 172-185). No clear examples of such jugs were found at Tell Qasile. However, two fragments from Stratum XI (Fig. 30: 13-14), decorated with elongated triangles in red and black (stylized lotus pattern), might be attrib- uted to necks of such jugs. Two similar fragments were found in Area A {PMC, p. 183). Type 13. Flat bowls with bar handle {PMC, pp. 185- 188). Flat bowls with a bar handle, defined as Type 12 in Dothan's classification, are represented in Area C, though none bears Philistine decoration (see above, p. 43, Type BL 15a). The stylized lotus motif decorat- ing the bowls cited by Dothan appears at Tell Qasile on chalice or goblet bases (Figs. 23: 5; 44: 8, 30). Type 14. Jug with handle from rim to shoulder {PMC, pp. 188-189). None of the jugs of this type from Area C is decorated in Philistine style (see above, p. 61, Type JG 1), though some do bear horizontal red and black bands (Figs. 30: 10; 41: 9; 49: 2-4, 11, Strata XI-X). Type 15. Juglet {PMC, pp. 189-191). Fig. 19: 41 (Stratum XI). A body fragment of a juglet, decorated with a black pattern band between horizontal red lines. Fig. 50: 5 (Stratum X). This juglet is reminiscent of one from Tell el-Far'ah {PMC, p. 192, Fig. 57: 1), though our example is decorated only with stripes. Type 17. Jug with basket handle and strainer spout {PMC, pp. 191-194). See the discussion above, p. 64, Type JG5c, and p.95 (Type 6A of the Philistine pottery). Type 18. Red-slipped kraters decorated with black spirals {PMC, pp. 197-198). See the discussion above, p. 45, Type KR lb. Other shapes. Actually, only the first eleven types in Dothan's clas- sification are characteristic Philistine shapes, with a clear foreign derivation; Types 12-15 are regular, local Iron Age I shapes, to which, in some cases, Philistine decoration was applied. At our excavations Philistine decoration was found on additional shapes. One of the cylindrical cult vessels from Shrine 300 bears a frieze of concen- tric half-circles painted in red.18 Four pilgrim flasks (Figs. 24: 20; 36: 10-11; 37: 1) are decorated in a pure Philistine style, and should be added to this group of local shapes with Philistine 17.

We should add to this group two globular goblets and an amphoriskos: Globular Goblets (above, p. 49). One of the goblets, from Shrine 300 (Fig. 32: 7; Photo 49), bears a rich Philistine decoration which, however, has almost completely disappeared: a decorative frieze, bor- dered by three horizontal red lines, contains three triglyphs (of groups of vertical parallel lines), with one of the metopes containing a black and red check- erboard pattern and the other a bird motif. The bird has an elongated body, with its head turned back, resembling the birds attributed by Dothan to the first phase of the Philistine ware {PMC, p. 201, Fig. 61: 9-10, and p. 140, PI. 49; p. 175, Fig. 46; p. 180, PI. 85 - all attributed to the first phase of the Philistine pottery). The appearance of such pure Philistine decoration on a goblet from Shrine 300 is most interesting, since this shrine was founded in Stratum XI and continued without change in Stratum X. No other examples of the bird motif have been found in Stratum X, and it thus appears that our goblet originated in Stratum XI and probably remained in use for an extended period in the shrine. Another goblet from Shrine 300 (Fig. 32: 9) is decorated with five groups of horizontal bands; between two of them there is a frieze divided by triglyphs made of vertical lines and a vertical wavy line, as is common in the Philistine style; the metopes themselves, however, were left free of any decoration. The neck was decorated with a wavy line. Such a decoration retains the Late Bronze Age tradition and appears also in Megiddo Stratum VIA. It is closely related to the Philistine style but cannot be defined definitely as such. Figs. 23: 5 (Stratum XI) and 44: 8, 30 (Stratum X) are fragments of decorated goblet (?) bases (Photo 98). They are decorated with a rosette of alternating black and red triangles (degenerated stylized lotus motif) arranged along the edge of the base. This is a characteristic Philistine motif which appears on a number of vessels in Stratum X (Fig. 51: 1, 4); no complete examples of goblets decorated in this manner are known, however. Amphoriskos. Fig. 19: 42, Stratum XI. Height 12.5 cm, diameter 1 1 cm; with carinated body, high neck, and two double handles. This vessel is red slipped and has a black painted decoration, including concentric half-circles on the shoulder and three bands on the Photo 98. Goblet bases (Fig. 23:5; 44:8). body. The handles also bear short painted lines. This vessel is unique in both its shape and decoration. The use of a Philistine motif in the common black paint- ing on a red slip - a technique common in Stratum XI at Tell Qasile - is an interesting local innovation. Our vessel may be taken as a prototype of an amphoriskos appearing in Cyprus in the "Red Slip" group, dated to the 10th-9th centuries B.C. 19 Our amphoriskos was restored from fragments found in two widely sepa- rated loci: Locus 227, within Temple 200, and Locus 242, a courtyard floor outside the temple. This is an indication of the distribution of the pottery at this time. At the end of Stratum XI, pottery vessels were smashed and partly cast outside the temple structure. Rhyton or a cup.

The lower part has not been preserved; it might have been a cup or an animal-shaped rhyton (compare the rhyton published in Tell Qasile 1, p. 101, decorated in pure Philistine style). The decora- tive frieze is composed of six triglyphs of vertical black lines, creating seven metopes filled with groups of diagonal black lines. The triangles created at the corners of each metope are painted red. ANALYSIS OF THE DECORATIVE MOTIFS Table 10 is based on analysis of the decoration motifs on the Philistine pottery as prepared by Trude Dothan (PMC, pp. 198-218).

The table shows that motifs of clear Mycenean or Egyptian derivation are almost entirely absent at Tell Qasile. The only motifs of these classes are the bird (which is quite rare), the antithetic spirals (mostly the "false" spirals, where both spirals are in the same direction), the concentric half-circles and the trian- gles. The other motifs are taken from the Canaanite tradition of the Late Bronze Age, which continued to exist during the Iron Age I at such Canaanite centres as Megiddo and Beth-Shan. The table demonstrates the limited number of motifs used by the Philistine potters at Tell Qasile, and the continuity of most of the motifs throughout the three strata, XII-X. Only the bird motif is limited to Stratum XI. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of the development of the Philistine pot- tery shows, in our opinion, that the earliest phase of Philistine ware is missing at Tell Qasile. To this phase we would attribute a few vessels which retain clear elements of the Mycenean UIC painting tradition, as well as clear Egyptian traditions. Such are the bell- shaped bowl from Ashkelon {PMC, p. 103, PI. 3), the jug from Tell Eitun {PMC, p. 145, PI. 62), jugs from Tell el-Far'ah (S) and Azor, and fragments of kraters bearing the fish motif {PMC, p. 109, Fig. 12; p. 174, Fig. 45; p. 176, Fig. 48). This group lacks the sche- matization and simplification which characterize the 103</page><page sequence="110">rest of the Philistine pottery, and thus it should be dated to the earliest phase of Philistine pottery pro- duction, following a short phase of use of pure or locally-made Mycenean UIC pottery. The Philistine pottery from Stratum XII at Tell Qasile marks a later and more advanced phase or, alternatively, is peri- pheral geographically to the "core group" of the earliest Philistine pottery as defined above. It seems to me that in our case the development is chronologi- cal rather than regional, and that our Stratum XII Philistine pottery marks an advanced phase in the settlement of the Philistines in Philistia. A thick white wash characterizes the Philistine pottery of Stratum XII, while it decreases in Stratum XI and almost disappears in Stratum X. Bell-shaped kraters are a common shape in Stratum XII, and decreasing almost to extinction in the following strata. The fact that no examples of the bird motif were found in Stratum XII is probably incidental, for the quantity of pottery in that stratum is limited. We may define the pottery from Stratum XII as a second stage in the first phase of the Philistine pottery as defined by Dothan. In Stratum XI the white wash on the Philistine pottery tends to disappear; there are five examples of the bird motif, and Philistine motifs in black over a red slip appear for the first time. The findings of our excavations, concerning the appearance of Philistine pottery in Stratum X, con- tradict the results of the previous seasons in Area A, which served as Dothan's basis for defining the third phase of the Philistine pottery. The two types used by Dothan to define this phase (Types 17-18) indeed appear in our excavations only in Stratum X, yet they are accompanied there by various Philistine vessels decorated in the pure Philistine tradition. The only motif which disappears from Stratum X is the bird motif. Due to the comparatively large number of Philistine vessels from Stratum X, the lack of this motif would appear to be the outcome of stylistic development. It may be argued that the appearance of well deco- rated Philistine vessels in Stratum X at Area C is due to the nature of this area as a cultic centre, where votive vessels could be preserved for a lengthy period and even be passed on as heirlooms from one stratum to the other. This may be true concerning the temple itself, for Philistine vessels were found there only in the repository Room 188 of Temple 131, but not on the floor in front of the raised podium. Yet several complete Philistine vessels were found in the final destruction level of Building 225 - a dwelling, south of the temple area. This house was built in Stratum X, over a previous building of different plan; it would be hard to believe that all the Philistine vessels found within it were heirlooms from the previous stratum, even if we assume that the house served the temple priests. Furthermore, some of the Philistine vessels of Stratum X show a stylistic development of their own. The strainer jug in Fig. 51:1 is identical in form to the "Orpheus Jug" from Megiddo Stratum VIA, and this shape is unparallelled in other Philistine vessels; the strainer jars of Stratum X are elongated and more pear-shaped in comparison to the rounded shapes of the Stratum XI jars; and the bird motif disappears in Stratum X. It thus appears to us that the evidence from Area C, in contrast to that from Area A, indi- cates that the production of Philistine ware continued at Tell Qasile at least into the early days of Stratum X. The reason for the lack of Philistine ware in Stratum X in Area A could be explained variously: production of decorated pottery may have decreased in this period, and such vessels were now limited to the temple service and to the upper class in town; or by the time of Stratum X the population of Tell Qasile may have become heterogeneous and that groups of Canaanite-Phoenician traders, sailors or artisans settled in the southern part of the site, and these elements may have avoided the Philistine pottery used by their neighbours. In any case, we may con- clude that the potters of Stratum X continued to produce pure Philistine decorated vessels, besides introducing the new local fashion of painting spirals in black on kraters of traditional Canaanite shape, to which they sometimes added horizontal handles. These are local developments, almost unparallelled elsewhere. A quantitative analysis shows a decline in the number of Philistine vessels in relation to non- Philistine ware, from Stratum XII to Stratum X (see Table 11). For comparison we may cite the results of the excavations at Gezer, where Philistine ware repre- sented 5% of the pottery assemblages of Strata XIII- XI. From this data the excavators there concluded that Gezer remained settled mainly by a local popula- tion, and that the Philistines were merely a ruling minority.20 Neutron-activation analysis (see Chapter XXI) has indicated that the Philistine pottery from Tell Qasile was made locally. It appears that our Philistine deco- 20. Gezer 1 ( HUC ), p. 26; Gezer 2 ( HUC' p. 55, n. 26. 104</page><page sequence="111">Table 11.

At this workshop, the artistic tradition passed through several generations, which would explain the homogeneity of the motifs, shapes and colours throughout the period. Minor develop- ments which we have distinguished were due to stylis- tic development in the production of this same workshop. Thus, the black painted kraters of Stra- tum X (Dothan's Type 18) are the product of the last generation of this local Philistine pottery. On the basis of minute details, selection of motifs and appli- cation of Philistine motifs to local shapes, this work- shop can be distinguished from other Philistine workshops, active further south. However, in its gen- eral approach to shape and decoration, the Tell Qasile workshop integrates well with other Philistine production centres. 105</page><page sequence="112">Summary Tables Table 12.

In Figs. 55:10-57, we present a selection of pottery sherds found in this deposit. The sherds shown represent all the types in this deposit. Since no buildings or clear floors could be observed, one cannot be sure whether this pottery is homogeneous, yet the nature of the material shows that it can be considered an homo- geneous group. Fig. 58 shows a group of vessels found together in Locus 313, a rock-cut installation on the western side of the mound, which appears to be contemporaneous with the sherd collection from "Stratum VII" ( Tell Qasile 1, p. 59). We publish this collection of pottery here though it is not related directly to the main subject of this volume, in order to complete the picture of the Iron Age pottery at Tell Qasile and to establish the chronology of this period in our site. Most of the forms represented in Figs. 55:10-58 are characteristic of 8th-7th century B.C. assemblages. Few distinct forms provide a closer dating in the last decades of the Iron Age. The bowls are mostly rounded bowls with thick- ened rim (created by folding out the rim). This type (Fig. 55:11-24) is characteristic of Iron Age II in general, in various parts of the country, both in the south as well as in the north.1 Most of our examples were either left bare of any slip or burnish, while some have a buff slip, similar in its colour to the clay of which the bowl was made, and then lightly burnished horizontally. Red or brown slip appear rarely. Similar treatment of bowl surface was found in the rich assemblages of Tel Batash Stratum II, of the late 7th century B.C., though there thickened rims are quite rare.2 Figs. 55:26, 28 are fragments of bowls in Assyriam shape probably from local production. The fragm- ents published here are the only ones found so far at Tell Qasile. Similar bowls are well known from vari- ous 8th-7th century contexts in the country.3 Fig. 55:25 is a unique shape, most probably a Phoenician bowl of a type known in the Achzib ceme- tery, yet almost unknown from publications. In sim- ilar bowls from Tell Keisan the rim is outurned in a sloping angle.4 Another unusual shape is Fig. 55:14 which finds a parallel at Hazor Stratum Va.5 The "mortaria" bowls (Fig. 56:5-6 and Fig. 58:3-4) appear in the 7th century in various sites and con- tinue to appear in the 6th century and during the Persian period. The complete examples from Locus 313 find close parallels in Ashdod Strata VIII- VII, Tel Batash Stratum II, Tell Keisan Stratum 4, Arad Strata VII- VI and Mesad Hashavyahu.6 Fig. 55:29-30 are large bowls or kraters with thick- ened rim. The shape fits an earlier date than the 7th century; the form could fit Strata VIII-IX, except that No. 29 is wheel-burnished, a technique which is lack- ing in the latter strata. Fig. 56:3, an unusual shape, may be included in the same category. Fig. 57:4 is perhaps a part of a deep krater of a type known from Beer-Sheba Stratum II.7 The cooking pots in Fig. 56: 10-15 are mostly of the open shallow type, with thickened grooved rim. This type appears throughout the bulk of Iron Age II throughout the country, though in Judah it disap- peared during the latter half of the 7th century, according to the analysis of Y. and M. Aharoni.8 In coastal sites like Ashdod, however, this type appears until the end of the Iron Age.9 The examples shown in Fig. 56 vary in the details. At Hazor similar cooking pots appear in Strata VI-IV; there, close parallels to our examples can be found. Thus, the rare shape in Fig. 56:13 is parallelled at Hazor Stratum VI10 and our Fig. 56:14 is parallelled at Hazor Stratum V.11 1. Numerous examples can be cited. For example: Amiran (1969), PI. 64: 16-17 (stratified material from Hazor); Tell Keisan, PI. 41:2 (similar to our Fig. 55:21); Ashdod''-''', Fig. 52: 26 (similar to our Fig. 55:24; the two latter examples are from 7th century B.C. context); M. and Y. Aharoni, BASOR 224 (1976), p. 85, Fig. 6: 1, etc. 2. A selection of pottery from this stratum is to be published by G.L. Keim and the author in a forthcoming issue of BASOR Supplement. 3.

The ridges on the neck are an important chronological factor; they appear in 8th century contexts, and are replaced by one protruding ridge on most late 7th century examples.12 The storage jar rims in Fig. 56:18-22 may be parts of several jar forms of the 7th century B.C., found at Judah as well as at coastal sites (Ashdod, Tell Kei- san).13The complete jar from Locus 313 in Fig. 58:11 finds close parallels in northern sites, and is charac- teristic of the 7th or early 6th centuries B.C., as at Tell Keisan Stratum 4. 14 Figs. 57:5-6 are rims of northern storage jars which appear in late 7th century context at Tell Kei- san.15 The ridged-rim hole mouth jars in Fig. 57:7-13 are common in the southern part of the country, both in Judah and the coast, throughout the Iron Age II.16 The "decanter" jugs in Fig. 57:16-19 are also typical of this period; the body form in Fig. 57:19, as well as its exterior treatment (horizontal burnish on orange red slip) are characteristic to Judean pottery of the 8th-7th centuries B.C. 17 The juglet in Fig. 57:21 is also a typical Judean form.18 Fig. 58:5-6 are most probably jugs of a type known particularly from Philistia and the northern She- phelah. Examples are known from Ashdod, Tel Miqne and Tel Batash, where they are characteristic of the 7th century rich assemblages (Stratum II).19 The jug in Fig. 58:7 is probably also a coastal form, found at Ashdod (Stratum VIII).20 The bottle in Fig. 58:12 is a form found in various variations, particu- larly in the north (Tell Keisan Stratum 5, Tell el- Far'ah, Tel Amai, Yoqneam), yet it appears also in the south; one example is known from Tell en- Nasbeh and a number of such bottles were found in Stratum II at Tel Batash.21 The form is inspired from Assyrian shapes, and is most probably characteristic of the 7th century B.C. The flask form in Fig. 58:8 is unusual in Iron Age contexts. The lamps with high heavy foot (Fig. 57:23- 25) are important both as pointing to Judean origin, and for establishing the date of our group; such lamps are characteristic of the last decades of the Iron Age in Judah.22 This brief discussion shows that our group is com- posed of forms characteristic of various regions of the country: Judean, Northern and Coastal. This variety of regional forms is unusual and perhaps reflects trade activity with various parts of the^ountry during the late 7th century B.C. This late date in the Iron Age II is suggested by various diagnostic forms as the "mortaria" bowls, the "Assyrian" bottle, the "torpedo"-shaped jar and the high-footed lamps. Only a few shapes fit an earlier date, perhaps in the 8th century B.C. (as the kraters in Fig. 55:29-30 and the cooking pot in Fig. 56:16). While the group from Locus 313 appears to be an homogeneous late 7th century coastal group, the sherds from the wash lay- ers on the mound may represent a longer time span. Yet a long time span can hardly be explained due to the lack of any building activity from this period. In spite of the few earlier sherds, we tend to date the bulk of the material to the 7th century B.C. The Judean forms may hint at some Judean activity on the site, perhaps during the time of King Josiah, whose activ- ity on the coast is most probably attested by the finds at Mesad Hashavyahu. 12.

Yellin and J. Gunneweg Institute of Archaeology The Hebrew University of Jerusalem INTRODUCTION Pottery from Tell Qasile Strata VII (7th century B.C.), X (up to 1000 B.C.), XI (1100-1050 B.C.) and XII (1150-1100 B.C.) was analysed by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). Among the pot- tery analysed were decorated Philistine wares, cult vessels, Phoenician Bichrome, red slipped and black painted and plain wares. The bulk of the pottery analysed, 69 specimens in all, came from Strata X and XI (52 pieces) with five pieces coming from Stratum VII and seven pieces from Stratum XII. One piece was analysed from Stratum IV and four pieces were of uncertain strata. The study was undertaken with the following objectives in mind: 1. To determine whether local wares from Tell Qasile can be distinguished chemically from other Philistine sites and whether any of the finds represent trade with other Philistine sites. 2. To determine whether the few fine decorated Philistine wares ana- lysed and the cult vessels were of the same origin as the bulk of material analysed. 3. To determine the origin of the Bichrome ware and imported wares. The method of analysis employed is based on that reported by Perlman and Asaro1 with appropriate modifications required by differences in instrumenta- tion and some operational procedures. A discussion of the reliability of INAA as a method for pottery analysis and how analysis done with the system employed compares with analyses done with the Perl- man and Asaro system is given by Yellin et al.2 We have taken advantage of the intercomparability of analytical results obtained in Berkeley and Jerusalem in the present study. By means of INAA the abundances of a large number of trace as well as a few major elements are measured for each piece of pottery analysed. The measuring process is tailored so that the errors of measurement are much smaller than the spread in composition exhibited by man-made pottery that is manufactured from the same raw material. For many elements the measuring errors are smaller than the spread in composition due to the natural homoge- neity of the clays. Potteries that analyse similarly are grouped together. The group is characterized by a mean value and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for each element measured. The RMSD is a measure of the spread in composition exhibited by the group. Typically, the RMSD of pottery groups is about 5% while the measuring errors for most ele- ments are less than about 3% and for many elements well under 1%. The high precision attainable with INAA makes it possible to distinguish pottery from different sources on the basis of chemical composition. Provenience is assigned to a pot when its chemical composition matches that of a chemical group known to be local to a particular site. The question of when a pot sherd composition can be said to match a group is a statistical one. Roughly speaking, we expect that for each element the difference in compo- sition between the pot sherd composition and the group mean composition be less than or equal to the RMSD for 2/3 of the elements if the sherd belongs to the group. For 95% of the elements we expect the difference to be less than or equal to 2 x RMSD if the pot sherd belongs to the group. 1. I. Perlman and F.

Ill</page><page sequence="118">The purpose of the study undertaken was to throw some light on the extent of foreign influence on Tell Qasile as may be evidenced by the occurrence of pottery with non-local chemical compositions. When non-local chemical compositions are exhibited the object is then to determine the source of the imports by matching the composition of the imports to local compositions of other sites. The success of such a venture depends on the extent to which other sites have been analysed. The more sites that are analysed, the greater is the likelihood of assigning provenience on an objective basis. Thus, the chemical signature of Tell Qasile local wares is of importance in itself if for no other reason than to provide a reference point in the study of Philistine trade. The underlying assumption to this chemical method of determining provenience, is that chemical compositions with the greatest frequency of occur- ence represent locally made pottery, unless local manufacture can be ruled out, e.g., if the site in question was not a habitation site. Other criteria for determining whether pottery is of local manufacture include the composition of kilns, kiln wasters, clays, and mud bricks. Pottery of local manufacture can be expected to fall into one or a few chemical groups. If in a given period of a site a single potter's workshop produced all the pottery from the site according to a fixed prescription with clay coming from the same source, we would expect a single chemical group to characterize the site. If clays from different sources were mixed to achieve specific functions or clays from the same source were treated differently in some fashion, e.g., by the addition of different amounts of temper, we would expect more than one local chemi- cal group. If more than one potter's shop existed, the number of local pottery groups could be correspond- ingly larger. Local pottery groups can be expected to be similar when contrasted with imports from other geological regions since local groups share clay sour- ces of a common geological region. In order to obtain an accurate representation of the chemical composition of local pottery from a given time period of a site it is imperative to analyse a large number of vessels and the sample must be representa- tive of the pottery actually dug up. This is often not the case. Pottery available for chemical sampling is but a very small part of what is actually dug up and that part that is retained for study by the archaeolo- gist may be highly biased. From Tell Qasile an attempt was made to obtain a representative sample of pottery from the pottery population retained by the archaeologist for study. Since chemical analysis was contemplated early in the excavation, the popu- lation retained for study is hopefully less biased than it might have otherwise been. For purely practical reasons it was not possible to analyse a large number of specimens. A preliminary chemical survey only was undertaken with the view that, depending on the outcome, more analyses may be done at a later stage. Table 9 gives the pieces analysed and a brief descrip- tion of the material. LOCAL WARES FROM STRATA X, XI AND XII Nine of the 22 specimens analysed from Stratum X form a chemical group whose composition is given in column 2 of Table 10. The group consists of a deco- rated krater, plain krater, two storage jars, chalice, plain carinated bowl, decorated jug and a red slip bowl. One of the 13 specimens not included in the group - a decorated carinated krater - has a com- position which is a variation of the group composi- tion. This variation is due to dilution effects which cause a depression or enhancement of the element concentrations in relation to the group. Common dilutants are quartz and calcium. The variant compo- sition can be brought into agreement with the group composition by applying a dilution factor and this is generally taken to mean that the variant shares a common clay source with the group.3 Of the remain- ing specimens from Stratum X, two - a burnished red slip bowl QASI 50 and a plain bowl QASI 51 - have compositions suggestive of sites south of Qasile and may represent imports from the region of Qasile where, as we shall see below, the compositions are quite similar. Four specimens have compositions which are different from the bulk of the material analysed and of these, three (QASI 58, 68, and 69) represent imports from distant lands. One specimen QASI 41 will be treated in Table 12. The last six specimens are cult vessels from Temple X and these will be discussed separately. Nineteen of the 30 specimens from Stratum XI form a chemical group whose composition is given in column 3 of Table 10. The group consists of a mug, 3. F. Widemann, M. Picon, F. Asaro, H.V. Michel and I. Perl- man, "A Lyons Branch of the Pottery Making Firm of Ateius of Arezzo", Archaeometry 17 (1975), p. 50. 112</page><page sequence="119">trefoil jug, three storage jars, carinated red slip bowl, red painted Philistine bowl, two Philistine bowls with red and black decorations, Philistine decorated krater, stirrup jar, carinated bowl, Phoenician Bi- chrome jug, plain bowl, carinated bowl, decorated jug, Philistine bowl, a vessel in the shape of a bird's tail and a bowl with black and red concentric circles. Eight of the remaining 11 specimens are dilution variants of the group. They are a hand-made bowl, buff red decorated chalice, white washed Philistine bowl with painted bands, Philistine krater with cream slip and design, storage jar and three juglets with black and red bands. One of the remaining specimens - an everted bowl (QASI 38) - has a chemical composition which is similar to that of a group of pottery from Tel Mevorakh which was previously judged to be local to the region Tel Mevorakh-Tel Megadim (see Table 12). Another specimen, a Philistine pilgrim flask (QASI 15), has a composition which is reminiscent of pot- tery on the coastal plain, south of Qasile. Finally, a Philistine stirrup jar (QASI 63) with a design in red paint showed a chemical composition that is grossly different. The group G(X) and G(XI) are statistically indis- tinguishable and together with the 1 1 pottery sherds showing variations in composition due to dilution effects represent the bulk of material from Strata X and XI. In column 5 of Table 2 we have combined the chemical groups G(X) and G(XI) into a single group G(X-XI) which includes the four cult vessels from Temple X. Two other cult vessels from the temple are compositional variants of the group. In addition to the 52 pieces from Strata X and XI, seven specimens were analysed from Stratum XII. The average composition of four of these pieces is given in column 4 of Table 10 and is statistically the same as the groups from Strata X and XI. The four pieces from the group are three bowls and a Philistine jug. Two of the remaining three pieces (QASI 9 and 56), a storage jar and pyxis flask, have compositions matching reference groups from coastal sites south of Qasile and the last piece (QASI 59), a flask, has a composition that is much different and will not be discussed here. Four specimens analysed were of uncertain strata and of these, one (QASI 67) a kernos, analysed like the bulk of the material represented by the chemical group G(X-XI), and two specimens, a collared rim jar (QASI 61) and a Philistine krater (QASI 62), are compositional variants of the group. One unstratified specimen (QASI 60) is of a composition that is much different and will be discussed elsewhere. Thus, of the 69 specimens analysed 36 have compo- sitions represented by the group G(X-XI) and 17 are variations of this composition due to dilution. The sherds that analyse like G(X-XI) are given in Table 9 by the letter G and those sherds that can be brought into the group by an adjustment for dilution are indicated in Table 9 by the letter V. Ten sherds that analyse like pottery from coastal sites in the region south of Qasile are indicated in Table 9 by the letters SR. As will be seen below, the origin of two sherds can be placed in the coastal region north of Qasile and these are indicated by NR. The 12 sherds that analyse differently than the group G(X-XI) represent imports and these are discussed below. STRATUM VII The five specimens from Stratum VII whose compo- sition is given in Table 10, column 1, analyse differ- ently from the bulk of the material that is shown in columns 2-5. In Table 1 1 are shown compositions of local wares from four coastal sites south of Qasile, and these have been compared with the Qasile VII group in column 6. The sites are shown on the map. The local reference groups from Tell el-Ajjul, Ash- kelon and Ashdod were previously published,4 so was that from Deir el-Balah.5 In Table 11, columns 5 and 6, it is seen that Qasile VII does not match the local chemical profile of Qasile XI. It is also seen that Qasile VII shows a better fit with the chemical compositions of the four southern coastal groups (in Table 11) and hence our assertion that the specimens from Stratum VII represent imports from some sites in the region south of Qasile. As already mentioned above, five specimens (not shown) from Strata X-XII analyse as pottery south of Qasile, which is based on comparing these specimens with the reference groups shown in Table 11. 4.

Chemically, the two sherds differ grossly which means that they do not have a common clay source. The latter might mean that the clay sources represent different origins. Columns 1 and 2 in Table 12 show one Phoenician Bichrome vessel (QASI 41) and a reference group from Mevorakh respectively.6 It is seen that the match is quite good except for two elements (La and Th) which are grossly different. This composition has not been found in the southern coastal region or in the entire South for that matter. This leads us to conclude that if an origin for QASI 41 has to be found, it should be to the north of Qasile, along the coast. CULT VESSELS Four of the six cult vessels which were analysed (QASI 1-6) belong chemically to the local group G(X-XI). The analytical data are shown in Table 12, column 4. It is easily seen that this composition matches that of the reference group of Qasile wares in Column 3 of Table 12. The chemical composition not shown here of two other cult vessels, a bowl (QASI 3) and a stand (QASI 6), do not match the Qasile reference group. On the contrary, this composition matches that of the Qasile VII group which was thought to originate somewhere along the southern coastal strip of today's Israel. One may, therefore, draw the conclusion that cult vessels were either made locally at Qasile, or imported from Philistine sites, south of Qasile, as their chemical composition suggests. SUMMARY The largest single group at Tell Qasile XI-X of decorated and undecorated Philistine pottery was probably made locally on the Mediterranean coast. The pottery from various coastal sites to the north and to the south of Tell Qasile reveals a basically common chemical pattern. However, the chemical compositions for pottery from each site are easily distinguishable with the aid of Neutron Activation Analysis. The chemical profile of Tell Qasile XI-X is typical for Tell Qasile alone and, thus, was probably manufactured locally. The question, as set forth in the Introduction, whether the cult vessels had the same origin as the fine decorated Philistine wares, can be answered posi- tively. Also these cult vessels were made locally. It becomes now clear that the Philistines produced locally their own pottery as has been established at Ashdod and Tell Qasile'. The most interesting issue which was enlightened in this study concerns the locally produced Philistine pottery at various sites. It becomes clear that there are minute differences in chemical compositions of Philistine pottery among various coastal sites in Philistia. Perhaps these differ- ences in chemical composition correspond to minute stylistical differences within the Philistine repertory, so that one might build a new typology of Philistine wares. The small group of plain ware from Stratum VII was believed to have originated from sites in the region south of Tell Qasile because the Qasile VII group does not analyse like the local group of Stra- tum XII-X. Little can be said conclusively about the origin of Qasile VII plain wares. It will not be surprising that in a coastal site as Tell Qasile foreign imports have been found. Among the pottery which has been analysed, some are imports from outside Israel. One piece, a White Slip I bowl, coud be traced back to Cyprus because of its chemical composition which matched that of Cypriot ware. This means that there were relations between the Philistines and Cyprus and other peoples from abroad. This and some specific stylistical problems concerning Philistine ware shall be, hopefully, treated in a future report.

THE BACKGROUND OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TELL QASILE: THE APPEARANCE OF THE "SEA-PEOPLES" AND THE IRON AGE IA The establishment of a Philistine port town at Tell Qasile should be seen as part of the wider process of Philistine expansion, following the initial phase of their settlement. This initial phase is reflected by the appearance of Mycenean IllClb material in the early 12th century B.C. strata at Ashdod and Tel Miqne (Ekron).1 Elsewhere we have discussed in detail this first phase of the Philistine settlement, which pre- ceded the foundation of Tell Qasile.2 The main con- clusions of that discussion may be summarized as follows: Mycenean IllClb pottery appeared in Palestine over a well-defined time span, contemporaneous with the final phase of Egyptian domination in Canaan. A terminus post quern for this phase is the reign of Tausert which, according to the finds at Tell Deir- 4 Alia, is a terminus ante quem for the Mycenean HIB pottery. The latest date for this phase is the reign of Rameses IV (or possibly even Rameses VI). This date is suggested by examination of several archaeological contexts which indicate the existence of a clearly defined archaeological phase succeeding the appear- ance of Mycenean HIB and Cypriot imports and preceding the appearance of the Philistine Bichrome ware. The following contexts mark this phase:3 Megiddo Stratum VIIA; Beth-Shan Stratum VI; Tell Keisan Stratum IX; Tell Abu-Hawam Stratum IVA; Aphek Stratum 11; Gezer Stratum XIV: Tel Miqne, yet unnumbered occupation level containing Myce- nean IIIC1 b pottery; Tel Mor Strata 5-6; Ashdod Stratum XIII; Lachish possibly Stratum VI and Tomb 570; Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum Bl; Tel Shera' Stratum IX; Tell el-Far'ah (S) most of Cemetery 900. This group of sites provides a sound basis for the definition of the Iron Age IA. This phase is contem- poraneous with the final phase of Egyptian control over Canaan, during the days of Rameses III- VI. According to our analysis, the Philistine Bichrome ware postdates this phase. The Mycenean IllClb pottery found in this phase can be divided into two groups: (1) scattered, isolated vessels, probably imported (Tell Keisan and Beth- Shan); (2) comparatively large assemblages of such pottery, found so far only at Ashdod and Tel Miqne. These latter finds should be attributed to the Iron Age I A phase defined above, and they probably mark the first phase of Philistine settlement in the main cities of the Philistine pentapolis. This initial phase should be dated from the 8th year of Rameses III on, probably until the time of Rameses IV or VI. This period, of some 40 years, enabled the long exposure of the Philistine artists to local Canaanite and Egyp- tian traditions, resulting in the appearance of the Bichrome Philistine style. Two vessels which demon- strate this transition in pottery making are the bell- shaped bowl from Ashkelon and the jug from Tell Eitun, which are very close to Mycenean UIC lb ware in their design yet are already painted in the Bi- chrome manner.4 The identification of the makers of Mycenean IIIC1 pottery at Ashdod and Ekron as Philistines is of great importance for evaluating the origins of the Philistines and other "Sea Peoples", as well as under- standing their role in the cultural development of the Levant during the 12th century B.C. The similarity of the Mycenean IIIC1 pottery found in Philistia and that found in Cyprus early in this same century would ascribe the makers of these two pottery groups to the same ethnic movement. This pottery in Cyprus is described as reflecting the "Achaean" immigration to the island, that is, the immigration of Greek- speaking people from Mainland Greece, actually refugees from the declining Mycenean culture.5 The 1.

Since the following list of sites is discussed in ibid., the refer- ences are omitted here. These sites are discussed in detail in PMC , pp. 25-91, yet Dothan's chronological conclusions concerning the first appearance of Philistine Bichrome ware in the time of Rameses III differ from ours. 4.

Dikaios, in Enkomi, pp. 519-523. 119</page><page sequence="125">"Sea Peoples" are, however, described in modern Cypriot historiography as invaders who caused only destruction and who left behind them almost no posi- tive evidence.6 Such an interpretation contradicts the picture in Philistia, where the Philistines (one of the "Sea Peoples") not only produced Mycenean IIIC lb pottery similar to that attributed to the "Achaeans" in Cyprus, but were also responsible for continuation of intensive urban life during a period of decline and destruction of such important Canaanite cities as Hazor and Lachish. The use of clay figurines made in Mycenean tradition, and the use of a linear writing system,7 also emphasize the Greek background of these "Sea Peoples". Thus the distinction between "Sea Peoples" as raiders and devastators, and "Achaean" immigrants who brought Mycenean cul- tural traditions to the Levant seems to me artificial.^ The Philistine immigration to Philistia should be regarded as the extreme eastern end of the wave of Aegean immigration which settled in Cyprus, as well as on the Syrian coast (as is attested by the finds at Ras Ibn Hani)8 in the early 12th century B.C. This settlement took place in Philistia following the battles against the "Sea Peoples" in the 8th year of Rameses III. The first phase of this settlement, characterized by the local production of Mycenean IllClb pottery, lasted some 40 years, until the end of Egyptian domi- nation in Canaan. The second phase of the Philistine culture included the development of the local Bichrome Philistine pot- tery style, the rebuilding of cities (e.g., Ashdod, where Stratum XII was built and fortified) and the estab- lishment of new cities in various parts of Philistia - Tell Qasile being one of them. This phase must be dated to the later Ramesides, probably after Rameses VI. The few scarabs and other objects of Rameses III and IV, found together with Philistine pottery, should be regarded as providing a terminus post quem for this phase. Thus, a date in mid-12th century B.C. is most probable for the beginning of the Philistine pottery, and thus also for the establishment of the town at Tell Qasile. B. THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SETTLEMENT AT TELL QASILE The foundation of Tell Qasile is an indication of the activity of the Philistines as settlers, city builders and navigators. The town was built on a previously unsettled western hill, part of the westernmost kurkar ridge north of the Yarkon River. This displays a superb site selection, exploiting the Yarkon River as a well-protected haven for maritime activity along the Mediterranean coast. The location of the site also suited agricultural activity in the vicinity, as well as exploitation of the nearby marshes. The choice of the site and the establishment of the new town indicate the vigor of Philistine settlement in the period imme- diately after the end of Egyptian domination over the country. This activity, and the urban traditions reflected in the development of the settlement, stand in strong contrast to the occupational gap and de- struction of the more important Canaanite centres, such as Hazor and Lachish, and emphasize the trend towards continuation of urban culture among the Philistine settlers. It must, of course, be taken into account that the Philistines themselves were probably only the leading, most active settlement group, and that they were probably accompanied by local ele- ments of Canaanite origins which may well have influenced to some extent the character of the eclectic culture which thrived at Tell Qasile during the 12th- 11th centuries B.C. A similar picture - of a thriving Philisto- Canaanite urban culture - emerges also at other contemporaneous towns in Philistia, though in most cases such Philistine towns were built over earlier, Late Bronze Age towns. Examples are Ashdod Stra- tum XII and Gezer Stratum XII (contemporaneous 6. H. Catling, in Cambridge Ancient History 3, vol. II/2, pp. 207-213; V.R. d'A. Desborough, in ibid., p. 668; P. Aström, SCE IVD, 1972, pp. 778-781. C.F.A. Schaeffer differed in his views. See, for example: Alasia I, Paris 1971, pp. 505-564. 7. For the clay figurines, see PMC , pp 234-249. Evidence for a Philistine linear writing system is found in two seals from Ashdod; see PMC, p. 45, Pis. 6-7. 7a. See also: J.D. Muhly, "The role of the Sea Peoples in Cyprus during the LCIII Period", in: V. Karageorghis and J.D. Muhly (Editors) Cyprus at the Close of the Late Bronze Age, Nicosia 1984, pp. 39-55. In this paper, which reached me during the proof reading of this volume, Muhly also suggests the identification between the so called 'Achaeans' who pro- duced the Myc. UIC lb pottery in Cyprus and the 'Sea People' settled in the Levant. However, he denies any Aegean origins to this group of peoples. According to his suggestion, the Myc. UIC lb pottery developed locally in Cyprus from the previous period, and any suggested Aegean origin for the Sea Peoples should be denied. However, in his argumentation Muhly ignores important data, such as the Mycenean tradi- tion reflected in the Philistine 'Ashdoda' type figurines, as well as the similarity between the Myc. UIC pottery found in Cyprus and the Levant to that known from Greece itself. 8.

In contrast, large parts of the Shephelah and northern Coastal Plain were only poorly settled. Thus, Lachish lacks any Philistine settlement; at Tell Beit Mirsim the Philistine level (B2) is very poor and only partly settled; at Tel Shera' there was probably a gap between Stratum IX and the Philistine town of Stra- tum VIII, while the situation at Tell Halif is not yet clear due to the small scale of the excavated area.10 In the Yarkon region the few sites excavated indi- cate a decline in this period. Thus, the Iron Age I settlements at Jaffa, Tell Jerisheh and Aphek were rather poor, hardly reflecting a thriving urban cul- ture. At Tell Jerisheh there was probably a gap dur- ing the 12th century B.C., and the late Iron Age I settlement, parallel to Tell Qasile Stratum X, was limited to a small part of the mound. At Aphek the Iron Age I remains include some building remains yet mainly pits and open areas.12 At these three sites detailed information concerning possible inner devel- opment during the Iron Age I is lacking. The most important Philistine site in the Yarkon region is Azor, where a rich Philistine cemetery has been disco- vered, probably covering all the phases of the Philis- tine culture; yet the character of the nearby settlement is as yet unknown. Thus, as far as is known today, Tell Qasile was the only thriving urban centre in the central Coastal Plain during the Iron Age I. Actually, no important contemporaneous site is known in the Sharon Plain north of Tell Qasile, up to its northern part, where Tel Zeror, east of Hederah, is the most important site.13 Tel Zeror is perhaps to be ascribed to another of the "Sea Peoples", the tkr, centred at Dor, where there is by now slight archaeo- logical evidence for a vast Iron Age I urban centre.14 Tell Qasile, then, was perhaps the most important Philistine town and port between Ashdod/Tel Mor in the south and Dor in the north. This pattern of urban culture, connected with the maritime and settlement activities of the "Sea Peo- ples", continues farther northward where it was also related to the emergence of the Phoenician culture. The cities of the Jezreel Valley (such as Yoqne'am, Megiddo and Beth-Shan), as well as the cities of the Acre Plain (such as Tell Keisan and Achzib), 15 pro- vide the best evidence of this process, which is in sharp contrast to the situation further inland. The evidence for a thriving urban culture asso- ciated with the settlement of the "Sea Peoples" must be compared to a similar process in Cyprus during the 12th-llth centuries B.C. The prosperous urban culture of the southern and eastern coasts of Cyprus in that period is well known from the excavations at Enkomi, Kition Kouklia (Palai-Paphos), and Hala Sultan Tekke.16 As mentioned above, we tend to connect the phenomena at Cyprus and in the Levant (particularly coastal Palestine) and regard them as part of a related cultural process, associated with the migration of peoples from Mycenean Greece to the east, their settlement and absorption there of local traditions, but retaining much of their own tradi- tions. This common process explains the interesting and peculiar relationship between Cyprus and the Philistine culture (see below). We may mention in this context Professor Yadin's suggestion that the first settlers at Tell Qasile should be identified with the dnn (Danuna) rather than the Philistines.17 This suggestion is based on a new inter- pretation of the Biblical word Dan and on the Greek legends which connect Mopsos with Ashkelon. Yadin thought that Stratum XII at Tell Qasile was built by the dnn, while the following Stratum XI was settled by Philistines. This has not found sufficient support 9.

Its walls are constructed of mud bricks laid on bedrock, without stone foundations; in the following strata, however, stone foundations are always found beneath the walls. There is evidence for a rebuilding of the entire town in Stratum XI, after a destruction of the previous buildings, yet there is no evidence for a sharp cultural break. The pottery of Stratum XI largely continues that of Stratum XII, though there are some changes, revealed only by using quantitative methods. Stratum XII at Tell Qasile reflects an initial phase in a long process of urban development. The basis for some of the ele- mentary features in the future development of the town was laid during this phase, such as the founda- tion of the sacred area, the location of the temple, and the erection of the long east-west wall south of the sacred area. These features of town-planning con- tinued during the subsequent Philistine levels, though the buildings themselves were modified. The structures of Stratum XII so far excavated show that the area around the temple (west and south of it) was densely settled, while Area A, in the south- ern part of the mound, was not fully built up, large parts of it remaining open. It appears, therefore, that the town developed from a core situated close to the sacred area, and slowly spread out toward the edges of the site. The lack of any Mycenean IIIC1 or related monochrome Philistine ware at Tell Qasile shows that the settlers of Stratum XII probably arrived on the site from further south in Philistia, bringing with them the already developed Bichrome Philistine style, combined with local Canaanite pottery and perhaps also architectural traditions. The initial phase of settlement, Stratum XII, prob- ably spanned about 50 years, in the second half of the 12th century B.C. The brick buildings of this first town were destroyed, though it has not been possible to define the causes of this destruction. There is no evidence for a short, violent destruction, for there are no large accumulations of finds on the floors and there is no evidence of fire. Perhaps a slow process of disintegration led the inhabitants to replace the old buildings with new ones. Such an explanation would suit the erection of Stratum XI walls immediately over the Stratum XII walls in some cases, though in other cases new walls were built on a new line. Stratum XI, the middle of the three Philistine strata at Tell Qasile, shows development in both 122 architecture and pottery making. The temple was rebuilt on a larger scale, and with stone walls, but the location of the holy-of-holies and the major outer outline of the structure were retained from the pre- vious level. The large courtyard east and north of the temple continued to be in use, though its level was raised and new rooms were erected within it. The foundations of the small shrine west of the major temple also reflects development of the cultic centre. The buildings excavated south of the temple show that the town was now densely occupied. This is also reflected in Area A, where some of the dwellings were probably first built in Stratum XI. The pottery of this stratum also shows continuity from the previous phase, with several prominent changes, the most important of which is the initial appearance of the red slip decorated with black painted decoration. This new technique appears on various vessels, and con- tinues in the following stratum. Comparison with other sites shows that this technique probably emerged at Tell Qasile itself, where its earliest appear- ance occurs; later it would spread both northward and southward. The cult objects and other small finds found in the temple and its surroundings reflect local arts and crafts which to a large extent represent a continuation of Canaanite and Egyptian traditions. These, as well as the traditional Canaanite vessels in the pottery repertory, reflect the character of the population on the site - probably an admixture of Philistines, apparently the upper class and the dominant factor in the city life, and the autochtonous population. The transition from Stratum XI to Stratum X is also a result of development rather than catastrophe. This transition could have been gradual, each archi- tectural unit having a development of its own. Some of the units, such as Shrine 300, continued in use in Stratum X without change. The manner in which the Stratum X temple was erected best illustrates the peaceful transition from Stratum XI to Stratum X. Yet the architectural development of the sacred area and its vicinity in Stratum X included important changes, such as the closing of the sacred area by a well-constructed stone temenos wall, the enlarge- ment of the temple and its renovation, and the found- ing of Dwelling 225 south of the temple. In Area A, this stratum represents the full development of the residential-industrial quarter excavated during the first seasons at Tell Qasile. The pottery and other finds from Stratum X show a straightforward contin- uation and development of the previous local cul- ture. The term "Post-Philistine", applied to this</page><page sequence="128">phase by B. Mazar,18 is unjustified in the light of the finds in Area C. Philistine pottery is still abundant during this phase, but it is accompanied by new forms and decoration techniques on different vessels, the most prominent of which are the black painted spi- rals on kraters. These kraters, as well as the accom- panying jugs, were the basis of Trude Dothan's definition of the third phase of the Philistine cul- ture. 19 Yet, as we have seen, the technique of painting in black on a red slip appeared already in Stratum XI, and continued in use in Stratum X, when the spirals were added for the first time. Thus the black painted spirals are no more than a detail in the local decora- tive technique, unparallelled at other Philistine sites, and representing an innovative motif of the local potters. Neutron Activation Analysis of the pottery samples from Tell Qasile has shown that both the Philistine painted pottery and the other pottery were produced locally, possibly in the same workshops. Thus the local potters probably painted the black spiral motif on local kraters side-by-side with the more sophisticated motifs in the traditional "Philis- tine" style. The fact that no painted Philistine pottery came to light among the rich assemblages of the Stratum X dwelling quarter in Area A needs explanation. This difference between Area A and Area C may derive from some compositional variation of the popula- tion. By Stratum X, much of the population of Tell Qasile may well have been non-Philistine, including Canaanite (now possibly better called "Phoeni- cians") traders and craftsmen. Thus, this southern residential suburb in Area A may have been settled by inhabitants who did not use Philistine decorated ware. In any case, both Area C (with its temples and Dwelling 225, where much Philistine ware was found) and Area A (where such ware was not found) were destroyed in the same conflagration, which left behind it thick layers of burnt debris. Another important development in Stratum X was the revival of international trade connections, lead- ing to the appearance of imported wares. Such imports are completely missing in Strata XII-XI, while in Stratum X there are a few Egyptian storage jars, imported Phoenician vessels, and Cypriot sherds. The span of Strata XI-X at Tell Qasile covers the entire 1 1th century B.C. This is the time of the great expansion of Philistine activity as recorded in the biblical narratives concerning their struggle with the Israelites under Samuel, Saul and David. W.F. Albright spoke of a Philistine trade empire which controlled the coastal routes along the eastern Medi- terranean coast, as well as the inland routes to Trans- jordan,20 and B. Mazar has dubbed this period as "Pax Philistea".21 There is no doubt that the Philis- tines reached a peak in their development during this century, achieving economic wealth and political power. Other sites in Philistia also reflect this period of prosperity. At Ashdod, Strata XII-XI parallel Tell Qasile Strata XII-XI, yet it is not clear whether Tell Qasile Stratum X parallels Ashdod X, or whether it predates it.22 Ashdod Stratum X displays a lack of Bichrome Philistine ware and the presence of red-slipped, well- burnished pottery, sometimes painted in black. This decorative technique appeared at Tell Qasile already in Stratum XI, but at Ashdod shapes and techniques are quite different, showing a high level of workman- ship. The city of Ashdod developed considerably during the period of Stratum X, expanding to several hundred dunams in area. This dramatic development in the material culture of Ashdod took place most probably toward the beginning of the 10th century B.C. The destruction of Tell Qasile Stratum X appar- ently corresponded more or less to the rise of Ashdod Stratum X. It thus appears that, while the Philistine port town of Tell Qasile was thoroughly razed (most probably by the Israelite conquests under David), the heart of Philistia continued to flourish, representing a new phase in its material culture. This phase is also represented by the establishment of many small set- tlements, characterized by red-slipped pottery and degenerate horizontal handles.23 In Philistia, other levels parallel to Tell Qasile Strata XI-X are Tel Shera4 Stratum VIII, Beth Shemesh Stratum III, Tel Batash (Timnah) Stratum V and Gezer Strata XII-X. On most of these sites (except Gezer) an inner devel- opment of the Philistine town and material culture could not be observed. At Gezer, where detailed stratigraphie development was observed, Philistine pottery continues into Stratum X without displaying any features reminiscent of Tell Qasile Stratum X. Thus we can observe here a phenomenon of regional 18. B. Maisler (Mazar), IEJ 1 (1951), p. 128. 19. PMC , pp. 191-198. 20. W.F. Albright, Cambridge Ancient History* , Vol. II/2, p. 516. 21. B.

In the northern part of the country, Beth-Shan Stratum V (Lower) and Megiddo Strata VIB-VIA are the two best examples of northern cities flourishing during the 11th century B.C.24 A series of common features relates this region with the culture of Tell Qasile, including temple architecture, cult vessels, pottery forms and decorative style, and metal imple- ments. It appears that both Beth-Shan and Megiddo prospered during this period, with mixed populations of Canaanites and "Sea Peoples" who perhaps were the overlords in this region. Trade relations with Cyprus and Phoenicia, prominently in evidence at these two sites, were part of the more general cultural relations which developed during the 11th century B.C. in certain regions of the country, particularly including the Coastal Plain and the inner valleys. The economic prosperity of Beth-Shan and Megiddo at this time resembled that of Philistia. A similar picture emerges in the Acre Plain, where Tell Keisan was a flourishing city throughout the Iron Age I.25 Tell Abu-Hawam and Achzib are other examples of the emergence of the Phoenician culture during this period. Both sites (but particularly Tell Abu- Hawam) have interesting parallels to the pottery finds at Tell Qasile. Although all these northern sites provide numerous parallels to the pottery repertoire at Tell Qasile, many regional differences could be observed. The red slip, black decoration and hand burnishing so common at Tell Qasile is lacking in the north, and there are some vessel forms which differ totally from the southern ones (such as the storage jars). The area of Israelite settlement in Upper Galilee, the central mountains and northern Negev is outside our present scope, since a totally different material culture was prevalent there, in terms of pattern of settlement and architecture, as well as in the pottery repertoire. The "collared rim" jar, a hallmark of the central hill-country sites, is represented at Tell Qasile only by a few isolated examples. One exception is Tel Masos in the Arad-Beer-Sheba basin; this outstand- ing site is not only much larger than any other Israel- ite settlment site of this period, but it also differs in its pottery assemblage. Its pottery is very close to the coastal assemblage; and its similarity to the assem- blage of Tell Qasile Stratum X is prominent and must be emphasized (though Philistine painted pottery is only sparsely represented at Tel Masos).26 This brief review emphasizes regional factors in the development of the material culture of Iron Age I Palestine. The main regions which can be distin- guished are: Philistia, the Phoenician coast, the northern valleys, the Upper Galilean Israelite area, the central hill-country Israelite area, the northern Negev, and Trans-jordan. There were strong cultural relations between these various regions, yet the inde- pendent development in each of them can be well defined. C. FOREIGN RELATIONS IN THE 12TH-11TH CENTURIES B.C. The excavations at Tell Qasile have contributed new data concerning the foreign relations of Palestine during the Iron Age I. Cyprus and the Aegean. The continuous direct trade relations with Cyprus, from the Middle Bronze Age on, ceased at the end of the 13th century B.C. Excava- tions in Philistia now enable interpretation of the special relations with Cyprus during the 12th- 11th centuries B.C. The first phase in these relations is represented by the appearance of Mycenean IllClb ware in Philistia and more-northern sites, as dis- cussed above (p. 119). This phase, we have noted, is related to the immigration and colonization of the Levant by the "Sea Peoples", the Philistines among them. The second phase, beginning in the mid-12th century B.C. and continuing until the mid-1 1th cen- tury B.C., is more complex: though there is no longer any evidence for direct relations with Cyprus, deep cultural relations with that island are apparent, as expressed in pottery forms ("horn-shaped" vessels and cylindrical bottles), in temple architecture (the temples at Kition vis-à-vis that of Tell Qasile, dis- cussed in Tell Qasile 1), in cult objects (the common popularity of kernoi and kernos bowls) and in metal- lurgy (cf. the ax-adzes from Megiddo and Tell Qasile, and the iron knife with ivory handle and bronze rivets. Cypriot influence can also be felt in glyptic art and in the writing system of the Philistines, both known only in a few examples.27 24. Beth Shan IA, pp. 149-153. 25. Tell Keisan, loc. cit.

VI V IV These common features are perhaps the outcome of cultural relationships between Philistia and Cyprus, maintained since the immigration of "Sea Peoples" (Philistines among them) in the early 12th century B.C., through or from Cyprus to the Levant. We may thus define a "cultural axis" through Philis- tia, the Levant coast and Cyprus during the 12th-llth centuries B.C. A third phase in relations with Cyprus began with the revival of direct trade with the island in the mid-1 1th century B.C. Besides the above, we now have also a small quantity of imported Cypriot White Painted I ware, present in Tell Qasile Stratum X and Megiddo Stratum VIA. The dating of the start of the Cypro-Geometric period (and thus of White Painted I ware) to 1050 B.C., as suggested by Gjer- stad,28 well suits the finds at Tell Qasile, where White Painted ware begins appearing in Stratum X. This chronology places Strata XII-XI (where no Cypriot pottery was found) in correlation with the Late Cypriot HIB period, while Stratum X (as well as Megiddo Stratum VIA) corresponds with the Cypro- Geometric I period. This chronology contradicts that suggested by Van Beek, which raises the beginning of the Cypro-Geometric I to 1100 B.C.29 Such a high Mazar (1951), Pl. 36: c.

Relations with the Aegean world are less obvious and direct. The recent excavations at Tell Qasile have not supplemented the data on this subject, as pre- sented by T. Dothan. There are, however, two new features within the cult objects from Tell Qasile which are relevant to the subject, concerning the lion-shaped "rhyton"30 and the lack of "Ashdoda" type figurines. Following T. Dothan, I suggested in Tell Qasile 1 that the group of pottery lion-shaped rhyta from Palestine retains Aegean prototypes, though the chronological gap was emphasized, since the Aegean prototypes are from Late Bronze Age I contexts. In the meantime, two similar vessels from Ugarit have been published, one containing a Canaan- ite dedication to the god Resheph.31 A third similar vessel from Ugarit was published long ago, but its definition as a vessel was not clear from the publica- tion.32 It thus now appears that the Iron Age I lion- shaped vessels found in Palestine are direct developments from Canaanite Late Bronze Age II cult vessels. The latter could have developed under Aegean influence, as there are Aegean prototypes from the 15th century B.C. The subject as a whole has been discussed by U. Zevulun33 who has noted the incorrect use of the term "rhyton" for these zoomor- phic vessels. As for the lack of "Ashdoda" type figurines, such figurines (as well as "mourning women" figurines) are the best evidence for Mycenean traditions in the Philistine cult,34 and their absence at Tell Qasile raises the possibility of major differences in cultic practices at this site in comparison with those in the Philistine heartland. In recent seasons of excavations at Tell Qasile (1982-84), however, both types of figurines were indeed found. A fragment of apparently a "mourning woman" figurine was found on the sur- face,35 and a fragment of a unique "Ashdoda" figu- rine, holding a baby in the traditional Mycenean manner, was found on a Stratum X floor. 36 These two figurines, though not from the temple area, change the picture entirely, and indicate that the inhabitants of Tell Qasile probably did retain Mycenean tradi- tions, as did their relatives in the major cities of the Philistines. Egypt. Four Egyptian storage jars found in Stra- tum X at Tell Qasile are evidence of direct trade with Egypt during the second half of the 1 1th century B.C. Such jars are very rarely found in this country, and even in the Late Bronze Age, when Canaan was under Egyptian domination, they are hardly found. The story of Wen-Amun attests shipments of Egyptian goods as payment for the cedar from Lebanon,37 and it may be postulated that Tell Qasile played some role as a port town in such trade, as well. Few Egyptian objects have been found in our exca- vations. The two alabaster vessels raise a problem, since they appear to date from the New Kingdom. If this dating is correct, it shows that during the 12th- 11th centuries B.C. there was some trade in non- contemporaneous Egyptian artifacts, which may have been derived from tomb robbing in Egypt. Egyptian influence on local craftsmanship is indi- cated in other objects from Tell Qasile, such as the two scarabs with hunting scenes (parallelled by a group of similar scarabs found in Philistia), as well as some of the cult objects (the "Naos", bird-shaped bowls and pomegranate-shaped vessels), though these latter elements could have reached the Philis- tine culture through Canaanite influence. Phoenicia. Clear direct relations with Phoenicia are found in Stratum X at Tell Qasile, with the appear- ance of Phoenician Bichrome ware, of the earliest types known in Lebanon. The appearance of similar vessels at Tel Masos in the northern Negev, in the Egyptian Delta and in the earliest Geometric tombs in Cyprus indicates the beginning of wide-scale Phoenician trade in the second half of the 11th cen- tury B.C.

THE TENTH CENTURY B.C. The violent destruction of the flourishing Stratum X city at Tell Qasile, at the beginning of the 10th cen- tury B.C., was part of a series of destructions in various parts of the country. Beth-Shemesh Stratum III was similarly destroyed, as were Tel Masos Stra- tum II, Tell Jerisheh and Megiddo Stratum VIA.38 At all these sites the destruction appears to be contem- poraneous, and a major earthquake could be postu- lated as the cause of this series of destructions. At Tel Masos the excavators indeed found evidence for earthquake damage at the end of Stratum II, yet such evidence is lacking at Tell Qasile and Megiddo. It thus seems more probable that Tell Qasile Stratum X (as well as Megiddo Stratum VIA) was burnt during a violent conquest, most probably an Israelite invasion under King David.39 There is only one biblical refer- ence to a conquest in Philistia by David (2 Samuel 8:1; cf. 1 Chronicles 18:1), and it is generally agreed that most of Philistia remained independent during the period of the United Monarchy.40 It is also agreed that David conquered a small part of the coast around Jaffa, including the Yarkon region. During this period the region was resettled to some extent, but it did not regain the prosperity known then in Philistia itself, as revealed at Ashdod Stratum X, Tel Shera' Stratum VII and from surveys in southern Philistia (which point to the foundation of many new sites during this period).41 As already noted in Tell Qasile l,42 we tend, to condense both Stratum IX and Stratum VIII into the 10th century B.C. Both strata are characterized by the same pottery, the most prominent feature of which is the heavy, thick, red hand-burnished slip appearing on kraters and bowls, the occasional appearance of black painted stripes on the red slip, and the total lack of other painted decoration. Some of the forms are characteristic to this period (particu- larly krater rims), while others (such as storage jars) continue previous traditions almost without change. The building remains in the temple area show that the temple was partly reconstructed in both strata: the outer walls were rebuilt and a new floor was laid. The poor preservation of the remains, however, precludes judgement of whether the temple was roofed, whether the entire structure was utilized, or whether it was only partly reconstructed and hence used as a semi-open cult place. A large lime-paved courtyard surrounded the temple structure in both strata, cov- ering over all previous auxiliary structures there. The architectural development in Area A points to large scale changes in town planning, including the dimin- ishing of the settled area, though the dwellings in use during this period were built on the outer walls of Stratum X structures, thus showing some continuity or architectural traditions. Public Building L has been ascribed by the excavators to these strata,43 yet its stratigraphie position is not entirely clear and there is evidence, based on both stratigraphy and the finds, that this building actually was founded in Stra- tum X. B. Mazar defined Strata IX- VIII as an Israelite town built over the ruined Philistine town.44 Accord- ing to him, it was an Israelite administrative centre during the 10th-8th centuries B.C., until the destruc- tion of the town by the Assyrians. Reducing of the time span of Strata IX- VIII, and the cancellation of Stratum VII (as resulted from our excavation results),45 enable us to conclude that both these strata represent a period when Tell Qasile was a port of the United Israelite kingdom, most probably serving the maritime connections of this kingdom with Phoeni- cia. Yet we doubt whether the population of the site was totally Israelite at this time. The reconstruction of the temple area shows that the sacred site con- tinued to function during the 10th century B.C., and the rebuilding of dwellings on the same lines as in the previous stratum also point to some continuity. We postulate that, though the town was conquered by the Israelites and governed by them, some of the previous population survived there. The Israelites probably made use of these people as sailors and navigators in their maritime enterprises with the Phoenicians. As at Tell Qasile, other settlements along the coast also flourished during the 10th century B.C. and, as at Tell Qasile, some of them were deserted after the fall of the United Kingdom.

Other sites along the coast, such as Tell Abu-Hawam Stratum III, Shiqmonah and Tel Mevo- rakh, were perhaps destroyed in the same invasion. The gap in the settlement at Tell Qasile, after the 10th century B.C., is probably the result of the break- up of the United Monarchy, resulting in the retreat of both Judah and Israel further inland. The history of the region during the Iron Age II is not entirely clear. Ashkelon governed the Jaffa area in the days of Sennacherib, as is related in his annals. The region north of the Yarkon probably remained unsettled during this period. The citadel of Tell Qudadi, at the mouth of the Yarkon River, is the only indication of a possible Israelite stronghold in this region, but the exact dating of the several phases at this site is elusive, for lack of published data.52 It thus appears that, while the Philistine city-states in the Philistine heart- land flourished during the Iron Age II, most of the port towns near Jaffa in the south up to the Carmel in the north did not survive the destructions at the end of the 10th century B.C., disappearing during the Iron Age II. At Tell Qasile, there is pottery evidence for a par- tial, brief revival of settlement in the late 7th century B.C. This phase, denoted "Stratum VII",53 has been isolated only as deposits of pottery in washed earth layers, found only in part of Area C and in two rock-cut installations at the western foot of the mound. The Judean features in the pottery of this phase raise the possibility that it marks a Judean expansion to the coast during the days of Josiah.54 46.

The god of Ekron in the 8th century B.C. was Ba'al Zebub (or Zebul?). But it is not clear whether these names indicate a religious synchretism in which non-Semitic gods of the "Sea Peoples" were identified with local gods, as happened later in Hellenistic times, or whether the Philistines accepted and worshipped local deities. We have no direct data concerning the identification of the deity worshipped at Tell Qasile. Indirect evidence may be found in an ostracon found on the surface of the mound, reading: u; pn mn1? nax nrrr Gold of Ophir to Beth Horon ... thirty shekels In the publication of this ostracon, Professor B. Mazar suggested that the name Beth-Horon may refer to the city on the road from the Shephelah to Jerusalem. But he also suggested an alternative: "It is, however, possible that the inscription alludes to the house (temple) of the great Canaanite god Horon, the more so as in the Greek Delos inscription of the second century B.C. Auronas is mentioned as the god of Yamnia (Yavneh), whose cult had apparently con- tinued to exist in the coastal part of Israel until the Hellenistic period; this interpretation supports the assumption that in Tell Qasîle or somewhere in its vicinity there existed a temple of the god Horon, worshipped by the Phoenician mariners".2 It is tempting to identify the temples discovered at Tell Qasile with the supposed temple of Horon suggested in the above passage, published in 1951. However, there is a serious chronological gap between the latest phase of the temple and the earliest date which could be ascribed to the ostracon. As we have seen, the latest reconstruction phase of the temple was that carried out in Stratum VIII. This stratum was dated by B. Mazar to the 9th century B.C. However, renewed analysis of the rather small quantity of pot- tery which could definitely be attributed to this mea- gre stratum led us to conclude that it should probably not be dated later than the late 10th century B.C. This conclusion is somewhat reserved, however, since it is based on limited stratified material, preventing defin- itive judgment. We have also concluded that there was a long gap between Stratum VIII and the Late Iron Age occupational phase of the site ("Stratum VII"), dated to the late 7th century B.C. If our con- clusion is correct, we must determine whether the ostracon pre- or postdates the occupational gap. If the former, it can be related to the last phase of the temple and may enable identification of the deity. On the other hand, if it postdates the gap, it would have little if any relation to the temple. This question is thus dependent upon paleographical analysis. Only a few inscriptions from Israel can be dated to the end of the 10th century and the 9th century B.C. A compari- son of the script shows that most of the letters in this ostracon cannot serve as chronological criteria. Only the alef, which has two parallel horizontal strokes on the vertical stem, seems to be of any chronological significance. The earliest appearance of this type of alef is in the mid-8th century B.C., on the seal of Abiyo servant of Az' . Thereafter it became common. In inscriptions of the 9th century B.C. , such as the Mesha stele, the storage-jar from 4 En-Gev and the inscriptions from Kuntilet 'Ajrud, the alef always has a triangular head.4 A date earlier than the 8th century B.C. for our 1.

Another problem concerning the "Gold of Ophir" ostracon is the letter bet , which displays two horizon- tal lines at the top. This is otherwise unparallelled, and the lower line is probably merely a continuation of the upper horizontal line of the letter alef ' as suggested by J. Naveh (orally). Although there is a gap of almost one hundred years between the latest date of the temple and the earliest date of the ostracon, the possible connection between the two should not be excluded a priori. Our knowledge of the paleography of the late 10th-9th centuries B.C. is still meagre, and there is still a possibility of a connection between the "House of Horon" mentioned in the ostracon and the temple at Tell Qasile. The god Horon is a well-known Canaanite deity, worshipped also in Egypt during the 18th- 19th Dy- nasties; he is mentioned on Egyptian monuments and in Ugaritic mythology, as well as in several 1st millennium B.C. sources.5 The possibility that this god was accepted and worshipped by the Philistines is possible, as hinted by the Greek inscriptions from Delos, of the Hellenistic period. Yet it cannot confi- dently be decided whether Horon was definitely the god worshipped at Tell Qasile. THE NATURE OF THE CULT The archaeological data alone are insufficient to reconstruct the details of the Philistine cult at Tell Qasile. Additional data concerning the Philistine cult is known from a few remarks in the Bible. The most important source is the story of the destruction of the temple at Gaza by Samson (Judges 16: 23-31). This is a literary description containing several significant details. The mention of "the pillars whereupon the house resteth" (Judges 16: 26) recalls Temple 131 at Tell Qasile, the roof of which was also supported by two pillars. It is possible that the temple at Tell Qasile Stratum X was built on a plan similar to that of the temple at Gaza. However, the basic temple concept in the ancient Near East is a building containing the image of the deity, into which the god's servants could enter. The common people usually remained in the courtyard outside. The description of the event at Gaza, on the other hand, states: "Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport" (Judges 16:27). This seems to describe a large structure within and on which a large crowd had assembled for the cultic ceremonies. If this is a realistic description, it contra- dicts the evidence at Tell Qasile, where the actual temple was a rather small building, no larger than a private dwelling in the same stratum. There are other possible explanations for the description in the Book of Judges, e.g., that it relates to an acropolis complex containing several public units, or that the two pillars which Samson brought down were situated in the portico of a large building. A third and most proba- ble possibility is that the literary tradition reflected in the Book of Judges was based on oral traditions, and should not be expected to reflect detailed reality. The description of the temple of Dagon at Ashdod (I Samuel 5) is very general. It can be learned that the statue of Dagon stood on a raised platform, before which the captured Holy Ark was placed. The temple threshold seems to have had an important role in this story. The details of the Philistine cult are even less known. The Bible mentions "priests and diviners" (I Samuel 6:2), as well as images of "golden emerods" and "golden mice" (I Samuel 6:4). These may have been figurines or other cult objects. This evidence is hardly sufficient for a reconstruction. During the cult ceremonies at Tell Qasile, most of the population of the city, or at least the male popula- tion, was probably assembled in the temple court- yard. The population can be estimated by multiplying the area of the site, 16 dunams (4 acres), by a density factor of 40-50 persons per dunam, a maximal number in ancient population estimations.6 Accordingly, the population of Tell Qasile could have comprised about 640-800 persons, including about 200 male adults. This number could have been assembled in the courtyards of the temples at Tell Qasile, even in the closed courtyard of Temple 131 of Stratum X. The accumulation of grey ash, bones and 5. Y.

On the other hand, the modest dimensions of the tem- ples, and the installations within, indicate that these, as with the other temples of the Near East, were considered principally as the abode of the deity, and probably also served as the city's treasury. The physical aspect of the cult at Tell Qasile, as far as can be defined from the archaeological remains, basically does not differ from that known at the Canaanite cult centres of the Late Bronze Age. The Philistines apparently accepted local deities, as well as adopting local cult practices, which may well have been assimilated into their own traditions. The existence of two adjacent temples in Strata XI-X, a major temple and a minor shrine, are, how- ever, unparallelled in Canaan, while it finds parallels in the Mycenean world and in Cyprus (at Mycenae, Melos and Kition). Such an architectural layout of a sacred enclosure may hint of Aegean cultic traditions retained by the Philistines, yet amalgamated with local Canaanite concepts, which can be defined both in architectural design and in the variety of cult objects. 131</page><page sequence="137">APPENDIXES 1. SEDIMENT ANALYSIS AT TELL Q ASILE Arlene Rosen The Geological Survey of Israel Mudbricks Mudbricks from several different structures at Tell Qasile were analyzed by grain size analysis in order to determine the textural characteristics of the bricks, their durability, and possible differences in brick type between strata, or within different structures of a single stratum. The method used for determination of grain size was the hydrometer technique for silt and clay, and mechanical separation through nested sieves. The results of these analyses are listed in Table 1, and each sample is plotted on a ternary graph (Fig. 1) by percentage of clay, sand, and silt. This graph shows that the bricks from the 12th century Temple 319 (Q81-2, Q81-3), the 11th century Shrine 300 (Q81-4, Q81-5, Q81-6), and Building 225 (Q81-7, Q81-8) from the 11th century, are all quite homo- geneous. Homogeneity in the composition of bricks from different periods was also noted by Goldberg (1985). This should not be surprising due to the continuity of a single cultural group at Tell Qasile. It is logical, then, that mudbrick material was collected from one location near the site from generation to generation. This contrasts with the pattern at certain other sites such as Tell Lachish, where the source material for bricks changed with each succeeding cultural occupa- tion (Rosen 1983). Although the majority of the mudbricks are ho- mogeneous, there are some exceptions. These are the bricks from the 12th to 11th century Public Building 330 (Q82-1, Q82-2, Q82-3 Q82-12). Some of the bricks from this structure, represented by sample Q82-2, fall within the normal textural range, but others, represented by samples Q82-1, Q82-3, and Q82-12, have a great deal more sand. Another variant comes from Building 147, Wall 615, a public building from the 11th century. The bricks of this wall, as seen from sample Q81-10, are also different, this time as a result of a higher clay content. The two samples of mud plaster (Q81-9 and Q81-11) also stand apart from the majority of mud- bricks. In the case of the mortar there may have been a structural purpose to using mud plaster with differ- ent properties from the mudbricks. This situation was also true for mortar from Tell Lachish (rosen 1983) and Tell Batash (Rosen in press). According to modern building standards for sun- dried adobe bricks, the bricks at Tell Qasile are of low quality due to the very high sand content. In stress tests, Fathy (1973:225-6) demonstrated that bricks with greater than 20% sand were not able to with- stand as much stress as those with 20% or less sand. The percentage of clay is also important to brick quality. Schwalen (1935) suggested that bricks can be made with from 9% to 28% clay, but the Modern Uniform Building Code (Boudreau 1971) states that sun-dried bricks should contain from 25% to 45% clay. The majority of the bricks tested at Tell Qasile average between 20% to 25% clay. The low quality of the Tell Qasile bricks is in part due to the fact that the site itself is located near the coast. In such a situation, sand forms a very large component of most sediment. Since, for convenience, brick is usually made from material close to the build- ing site, it would have been impractical to import more clayey sediment from further inland. During excavations at Tell Qasile there were at least two instances (Wall 615 and Shrine 300) in which the excavators uncovered remains of walls which had collapsed (Mazar 1980: 14, 20, 30). According to the results of these textural analyses, it seems likely that the collapse was due to the internal weakness of the bricks themselves. It is very possible, then, that the Philistine inhabitants of Tell Qasile were plagued by the need to make constant recon- structions and repairs to the walls of their structures. 133</page><page sequence="138">Microarchaeology Sediments from the floors of two structures were examined in order to find microscopic artifact remains of past activities which had been trampled into the accumulating debris on a surface. The surfa- ces examined were from Public Building 330 (12th to 1 1th century) and Temple Courtyard 1 10, also of the same time period. Sediments from the floor of Build- ing 330 were collected from a shallow (6.0 cm) accum- ulation of approximately seven layers. Each layer was analyzed separately. Procedure The sediments were dried and weighed, then washed through a set of six nested sieves of 2.00 mm, 1.00 mm, 0.55 mm, 0.210 mm, 0.125 mm, and 0.063 mm. The remaining sand-sized particles were exam- ined under a stereo-binocular microscope, and per- centages of components were estimated using percentage charts (Fitzpatrick 1974: 76-83). The results are listed in Table 2. Discussion The total percentages of components for each sam- ple are lasted in Figs. 2 and 3. From this it is evident that the major components of the sand-sized sedi- ment are kurkar and quartz. Samples Q82-9 and Q82-10 both differ from the other five samples. In Q82-10, there is a greater amount of quartz, as well as a much higher percen- tage of silt and clay. In Q82-9, the sediment is primar- ily composed of platy fragments with straw impressions which may have resulted from the prepa- ration of sediment for the original floor. These two samples also differ in color from the upper five. Q82- 9 and Q82- 1 0 are both light gray ( 1 0 YR 7/2, dry), and the others are pale brown (10YR 6/3, dry). Thus, it is likely that these two levels are prepared floor, rather than natural sediment buildup on the surface. Sample Q82-10 appears to be bricky material laid as a foundation, and Q82-9 is perhaps a prepared surface. The fact that there is bone, some charcoal, and a trace of flint in sample Q82-10 should not be surprising since a similar analysis of mudbrick showed that brick sediment often contains secondary 134 refuse such as bone, charcoal, and sherds. If the above suggestion is true, then the artifacts in samples Q82-9 and Q82-10 are secondary refuse, and thus not reflective of activities. The main feature shown in the graph of artifactual remains (Fig. 3) is the positive relationship between bone and charcoal. With the increase in charcoal, there is a corresponding increase in bone for samples Q82-4, Q82-5, Q82-6, Q82-7, and Q82-8. The correla- tion coefficient of this relationship is r=0.85. Thus it is likely that burning of animal flesh and bone was one of the activities conducted within this structure. The bone/charcoal relationship throughout the floor sediments indicates that this activity was conducted throughout the history of the room. Furthermore, since the charcoal was derived from wood only, with no trace of charred seeds, it is unlikely that the fireplace was used for general pur- pose household cooking. This contrasts with sample Q81-12, which comes from Temple Courtyard 110, and contains the remains of bones and charred seeds. The evidence from the surface of Building 335 suggests the possibility that some sort of animal sacri- fice took place there. However, this analysis was experimental and samples were only taken from one small area of the floor. A more complete analysis should include samples from several locations on a particular surface. Conclusions From sediment analyses at Tell Qasile it was con- cluded that most of the mudbrick used at the site was homogeneous, and probably came from a single source close to the tell. The very high percentage of sand indicates that the bricks were of poor quality and unable to withstand structural stresses. The microarchaeological analysis of floor sedi- ment from Building 335 showed a positive correla- tion between bone and wood charcoal which existed throughout the period of sediment accumulation upon the floor. This suggests that a major activity in this portion of the room was the burning of animal products and may be indicative of animal sacrifice. In contrast, the microscopic remains from the surface of Courtyard 1 10 showed evidence of cooking for more general domestic purposes.</page><page sequence="139">Table 1.

MICROMORPHOLOGY OF TELL QASILE SEDIMENTS AND MATERIALS Paul Goldberg Institute of Archaeology Hebrew University Jerusalem A series of samples consisting of brick and wall, plaster and gray "ash-like" material was collected from Tell Qasile. Their location and stratigraphie context are presented in Table 1. The descriptive terminology employed here follows that of Brewer (1976) while quantitative estimates are based on vis- ual comparisons with charts given by Fitzpatrick (1974). I. PLASTER (Samples QAS-2 and QAS-10) QAS-2. This sample consists of subangular to sub- rounded, moderately sorted quartz and (20-30%), traces of angular quartz silt and rounded grains (2 to 25 mm) of kurkar. As well, there are traces of shell fragments and charcoal. The matrix is dark brown calcareous clay that is probably mixed with some ash and contains several large voids, most likely the impressions of straw or other vegetal material. QAS-10. This sample is similar to the above and is composed essentially of quartz sand and silt, and abundant kurkar grains in a calciasepic matrix. General comments on plaster. Both samples are basi- cally the same, with minor exceptions. The darker color in QAS-2, for example, is apparently due to the presence of more clay and organic matter, as well as its being from a burned level. Both plasters are made from materials locally available in the vicinity of the tell. On the basis of microscopic examination, gypsum appears to be lacking. 137</page><page sequence="142">II. BRICK and WALL The three unburned bricks from Stratum X (QAS-5, -7, -8) and the one from Stratum IX (QAS-9) are quite similar, and one description will suffice for all. Sam- ple QAS-6, the burned equivalent of QAS-7, is de- scribed separately. The unburned bricks are composed of moderately sorted subangular to subrounded quartz and (20- 30%) in a clay-rich calciasepic matrix. Additional coarse material is represented by traces of kurkar grains, shell fragments and one piece of pottery. The long, interconnected voids, as with the plaster samples, seem to represent former traces of vegetal matter, some of which, however, may be due to recent root activity. The sample of burned brick (QAS-6) shows basi- cally the same features as the unburned samples although certain elements are more prominent. Large, smooth, elongate and ovate chambers are bet- ter preserved. As well, the matrix takes on a red- brown colour that represents oxidation of the iron-rich clay. As with the plaster samples, those of bricks and the wall contain materials from a local source. The bricks seem to have been put together from quartz sand and silt, and mixed with fine calcareous silt, clays, and held together with a vegetal binder, presumably straw. It is interesting to note that there is no apparent difference in composition between the Stratum IX brick (QAS-9) and that from StratumX (QAS-5 to 8). III. MISCELLANEOUS SAMPLES QAS-3 ("gray material"). This is not unlike the other samples and contains the typical recipe of quartz sand, silt, shell and kurkar fragments, and even bone. The most significant and striking feature is the matrix which contains an abundance of calcareous ash (Folk 1975), not seen in such abundance in the other sam- ples. It most likely accumulated as a result of hearth cleaning or perhaps tidying up after destruction. QAS-4a. This sample is somewhat unique. While the granular components (skeleton) are typical, the matrix is quite clayey and calcareous. Moreover, the clay tends to be concentrated in clumps. The local reddening, found particularly next to voids, suggests that this sample was burned, although perhaps only slightly. The fine, almost dusty and calcareous nature of thé matrix is quite similar to the ashy deposit of QAS-3. IV. CONCLUSIONS The micromorphological analysis of plaster and brick samples from Tell Qasile indicates that all the materials used to produce these items were locally derived and were probably fabricated at the site, or not very far away. The two gray samples (QAS-3-4a), while generally similar to the brick and plaster, con- tain substantial amounts of ash.

Waisel Tel Aviv University Botanical material gathered in Tell Qasile Area C included one charred log and two samples of charred pieces of wood. Two of the wood samples came from the floor of Temple 131 of Stratum X. Samples of about 1-1.5 cm3 were taken for botani- cal analysis. Cross sections as well as tangential and radial longitudinal sections were prepared by the usual technique (Liphschitz and Waisel 1973). The sections were described and the wood was identified. Samples taken from live trees of known species were used for reference. Results are given in Table 1. Table 1 Basket Wood Locus No. No. identification Temple 131, Room 106 (on floor) - Cedrus libarti- log Temple 131, Locus 127 (on floor) 1463 Cedrus libani Building 225, Locus 193 3528 Quercus ithaburensis All the three samples came from the destruction layer of Stratum X. As can be seen from the results, the wood was made out of two tree species, i.e., Cedrus libani - Cedar of Lebanon and Quercus ithaburensis - Mt. Tabor Oak. The two samples of cedar came out of Temple 131 of Stratum X, one from the entrance room, and another from the main hall (perhaps a remain of a wooden pillar). Cedrus libani occurs today in the East Mediterra- nean in Turkey, Cyprus, Syria and Lebanon. In Lebanon well developed stands occur near Ain Zahalta, Jebel Baruk and further north there is another centre of cedar forests in Hadeth, Besharri and Ehden (Zohary 1973). The wood of Cedrus libani is of a high quality and has a pleasant scent, and from the earliest history it was highly esteemed and used for special construc- tion purposes. The Egyptians imported cedar wood for residential buildings and ships. King Cheop's royal ship was built mainly of Cedrus libani (Jenkins 1980). Both the First and the Second Temple in Jerusalem were con- structed of cedar wood, and Hiram, King of Tyre, sent cedar wood to King Solomon for the building of the Temple. Cedar wood was used also in the construction of the Palace in Lachish (Liphschitz and Waisel 1974- 1981). Cedrus libani logs were also used in the con- struction of the roof of the El-Aqza Mosque (Lev-Yadun, Liphschitz and Waisel 1983). No doubt that the precious timber of Cedrus libani was brought especially from Lebanon for the build- ing of the Temple in Tell Qasile. The wood of Quercus ithaburensis found in the excavation was probably brought to Tell Qasile from the Yarkon sources district. The coastal association of Quercus ithaburensis was in the past a forest which covered the area from Lod up to the slopes of Mt. Carmel (Eig 1934). The forest still existed during the last century. In the PEF maps (Conder and Kitchener 1880) one can find two big blocks of oak forests which reached the environs of the sources of the Yarkon River. 139</page><page sequence="144">References Conder, C.

FOOD REMAINS FROM TELL QASILLE with special reference to Lathyrus sativus/ cicera Mordechai E. Kislev Department of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan Maria Hopf Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum, Mainz During the 1972 excavation season directed by A. Mazar, several litres of legume (especially Lathyrus) seeds along with some other vegetal food remains were uncovered. All of the charred samples were found in Stratum X, dated to the 11th century B.C., in destruction debris, inside the Philistine Temple 131 and adjacent Building 225. In addition, a large sam- ple, found in 1951 in Area A, Stratum X, Building O, is included in this research (Table 1). Only part of the legume seeds unearthed was available for this study, as the remainder is on permanent exhibition at the Tell Qasile Museum. Tell Qasile, now within the city of Tel- Aviv, is surrounded by light soils typical to the Sharon Plain. However, just a few hundred metres to the south, along the Yarqon River, heavy alluvial soil is found. The plant material contains: six-rowed, hulled bar- ley ( Hordeum vulgare , rmvu?) (Table 2) admixed with darnel ( Lolium temulentum, "DtPö pT) found in an undamaged pyxis (Reg. No. 1380, Locus 134); hoise bean ( Vicia faba , *71D) (Table 3) and mainly grass pea (. Lathyrus sativus, "»main riDlü) mixed with dwarf chickling (L. cicera, Ytifön nDlü), found in two con- centrations: in a storage jar from Room 6, Building O (Area A) and in a silo, found in Room 168, Building 225 (Area C), both from Stratum X (Tables 4 and 5). In the results represented in the Tables, the deviation 140 to the right of the ± sign was computed from the formula 1 .96 x the standard deviation/ VN, where N is the sample size. The sum of the mean and this quantity is the upper bound of an interval, whose lower bound is the difference between the mean and this quantity. This interval, called a confidence inter- val, contains the true value of the population mean with 95% confidence (corresponding to a P-value of 0.05). The biology of the two cultivated species of Lathyrus (including agricultural practice and nutri- tional aspects) is not well known, with meagre data being scattered in very specific books or journals. Therefore, most of the available information is sum- marized in this chapter. Also, seed coat characteris- tics useful for distinguishing between the two legumes with the aid of the scanning electron microscope are suggested. The Linum seeds ( nnWD), about 4.5 mm in length, were identified as the cultivated species because of their shape, as well as the fact that they were found as a pure sample, without any other remains of crops or weeds. Pulse grains are especially important in countries where diets are mainly vegetarian. In such areas, including much of the Near East, pulses are the pre- dominant source of the high-grade protein consumed by man and beast. The importance of pulse cultiva- tion in a particular agricultural society varies with the</page><page sequence="145">extent to which the people depend on vegetables. In areas where milk is scarce, owing to limited herds of milking stock, we find the highest proportion of leguminous crops are grown; where grazing is more plentiful and milk more abundant, the proportion of leguminous grains decreases. To cite an extreme case, in parts of India, like the Bombay area, pulse grain crops account for over 17% of the cereal acreage, whereas in Turkey, where more milk is available thanks to "oasis cultivation",1 pulses represent only 5.5 to 8% of cereal acreage (Mann, 1947). Out of the seven legumes which were common in the ancient Near East - lentil (D^uny), bitter vetch (nruHD), broad bean (ViD), pea (pDX), chickpea (ölöin), grass pea (THinn riDlü) and dwarf chickling (TiXön JlDlü) - the latter two exhibit some special common features. These two Lathyrus species are no longer used in this region for human consumption, and their cultivation as fodder crops is rapidly disap- pearing. They are therefore no longer mentioned in regional textbooks of agriculture, or included as ingredients in cookbooks. On the agronomic scene, they are not being investigated as thoroughly as are other legumes. Practically, the only regions in which Lathyrus serves as a food until today are N.E. India and C. Ethiopia. In other countries, as in the Near East and the Mediterranean area, they may be found either as a minor or occasional crop, chiefly fed to cattle. Whereas a rather clear biological picture may be sketched for grass pea, the literature on L. cicera is sparse, probably because the plant has for many years ceased to be grown for food and its use as a feed crop has been in decline at least since 1900. Moreover, the two species are sometimes grown in conjunction, and they cannot be distinguished from one another by the farmer or animal husbandman (Townsend and Guest, 1974). The information pre- sented below is drawn from Kay (1979), Padmanaban (1980) and Townsend and Guest ( 1974) but not all the details they give may accurately reflect the situation in ancient times even in the Near East. Lathyrus sativus has many agricultural and eco- nomic advantages. It is a hardy crop that survives adverse agricultural conditions; it is not subject to serious insect prédation and is easy to handle and cheap to cultivate. In fact, there is no alternative crop that grows as well in semiarid climates. The seeds contain a high percentage of protein rich in lysine, the essential amino acid which is found in minimal con- centrations in cereals. For this reason, Lathyrus has become a mainstay of some Indian diets, particularly under famine conditions. World production is esti- mated in recent years to be over 1,000,000 tons. Names: The common and local names of L. sativus are numerous: blue chickling, blue vetchling, chickling pea, chickling vetch, grass pea, grass peavine, Indian vetch, Khesari pea, lathyrus pea (English); gesse blanche, g. chiche, g. commune, gesette, lentille d'Es- pagne, pois carré (French); Platterbse (German); cicerchia coltivata, pisello bretonne, p. cicerchia (Italian); almorta (Spanish); fovetta (Cyprus); julban (Levant); tofah (Hebrew); hurtman (Iraq); (in the Indian subcontinent, Kesari dal is used in scientific literature, whereas each Indian language has its own name; Hartman et al ., 1974); sabberi (Tigrinia) and gwaya, shimhera (Amharic). Apparently, some of the common names are built from two words, indicating that L. sativus is less common than the other legumes which have a simple name (pea, bean, lentil). Other names indicate that it is grown for fodder, such as vetch, but that it was less common (e.g., Indian vetch, blue vetchling, etc.). The diversity of names may well indicate that L. sativus was grown locally in many areas, but was not signifi- cantly traded between countries, as tea, for example. Morphology : L. sativus and L. cicera are related species belong- ing to section Cicércula. The flowers of L. sativus are bigger, 15 mm or more, blue, lilac or white in colour, while those of L. cicera are smaller, up to 13 mm, brick- or purplish-red, rarely pink. Both have a short, flat pod which contains usually 3 to 5 smooth, sub- quadrate, slightly compressed seeds, 3-15 mm long (the longer seeds occurring only in L. sativus). The pod is wider in the upper (ventral) part than in the lower, developing carinated margins at the upper suture, which are pronounced as distinct wings 1.5-2 mm broad, in L. sativus. Some cultivars of L. sativus have globular or subglobular seeds, but most varie- ties have seeds with an approximately triangular cross section. On the broad face of the seed facing the upper suture (in the corner closer to the style), there is a small, oval pit (the hilum); on the opposite corner is a "lens", a small protuberance which develops in place of the chalaza of the ovule. The seeds are wider at the face of the hilum and lens, and taper 1 The term "Oasis cultivation" is used by Mann to describe communities in which crops are grown in close proximity to the village and the surrounding uncultivated area is utilized for grazing. 141</page><page sequence="146">towards the opposite side at the dorsal suture. The hilum length is about 1/15 of the circumference of the seed. The size and shape of the seeds in a single pod vary considerably according to their location in the pod, which abruptly narrows at both ends. In this respect, the plant retains a feature more common in wild species - heterogeneity. As the pod has four seeds on the average, the number of terminal seeds equals that of the intermediate ones. The intermediate seeds are truncate at both ends and broader than long, while the terminal ones are flat at the end towards the middle of the pod and more or less rounded or bluntly pointed at the other end. These terminal seeds are wedge-shaped, generally longer than broad (the length of the seed is measured parallel to the length of the pod and its breadth, to the breadth of the pod). Their breadth as well as their thickness narrow towards the end of the pod. The seed near the base of the pod is longer and more wedge-shaped than the opposite one (near the style). It is also possible to distinguish between the two according to the position of the radicle tip which touches the hilum at the side opposite the "lens". The radicle is always found at the face of the seed closer to the style; therefore the seed near the style is the only one which has a radicle not located at a truncate face. Also, the style- proximate seed is intermediate in a shape between the other two types - the clearly wedge-shaped seed which is located at the base of the pod and the inter- mediate ones. However, in charred seeds - which are deformed, have no testa and often are missing part of the radicle - it is more difficult to distinguish between the basic seed and the stylar one. In Table 5 the two terminal types were grouped together and no attempt was made to distinguish between them. However, to characterize accurately a sample of charred seeds, it is necessary to measure separately the three types - the basic terminal, the interme- diate, and the stylar terminal seeds - but this is not always possible. There are many contemporary cultivars of L. sati- vus that may be characterized by the seed morphol- ogy despite the large variability in size and shape of each type of seed, even within the same plant. Seed size and shape of small seed varieties of L. sativus may overlap those of L. cicera. The similarity between the two in ancient times was even more pronounced because the seeds of L. sativus were probably smaller than they are today. Therefore it is difficult to distin- guish between them in archaeological material. Climate and Soil : In the Mediterranean region, the Near East, Ethio- pia and India, the grass pea is a cold-season legume; but in central Europe it is grown as a summer crop. Grass pea is a very hardy plant that will germinate and grow on land far too dry for more popular pulses or wheat, i.e., in areas with an annual rainfall less than 320 mm. In India it is often grown under extreme drought conditions and is sown following failure of the October rains. Despite its successul growth under drought conditions, grass pea is like- wise not affected by excessive rain and can be grown on land subject to flooding. Grass pea grows well on almost all types of soils, producing good seed crops even in poor soil. Black deep retentive soils, however, are considered best. The plant is sensitive to acidity and requires lime treatment for acid soils. Grass pea can be cultivated from about sea level up to 2000 m. In India the seeds are often sown via broadcasting without any further treatment and left to take their chances for survival. By the time the plants flower, the crop completely covers the ground in a dense carpet of vegetation. When the first pods are ripe, the plants are uprooted, carried in bundles to the threshing-floor, and allowed to dry before the seeds are beaten out (Mann, 1947). When grown as a mixed crop it can be sown broadcast in a standing crop of rice, or together with barley, linseed and chickpea seeds. It is also found as a quite common weed in wheat and barley fields. Uses : Both L. sativus and L. cicera were used for food in Mediterranean countries from the earliest of times up until the last generation and perhaps in some remote places even today. Unfortunately, nearly all literary sources available deal with L. sativus - the plant having bigger seeds and apparently also more abun- dant fruits. It is still grown and used on a large scale in N.E. India and C. Ethiopia, particularly in times of food shortage, and especially among the rural populations. In India the seed is frequently used for adulterating the more expensive legume seeds. The dry seeds may be boiled in water and eaten whole, split or used as "dhal" (groats boiled to a porridge-like dish), or ground into flour and made into unleavened bread (chapaties), paste balls, or curries (a highly spiced stewed dish). In other places of India they are dehusked and parched before use. In Ethiopia, seeds are consumed roasted or are used for the preparation of "wot" (spiced boiled whole grains). The seeds, 142</page><page sequence="147">being consumed as a somewhat inferior chickpea, may be also used in soups (Lindley and Moore, 1870). They may be eaten as green seeds like peas, they are less preferred as dry seeds but are always used as puree (Bois, 1927). Young leaves of the plant are sometimes used as a pot herb, and occasionally, immature pods are boiled and eaten as a vegetable. Today, the plant is more often grown for fodder. It can be reaped and fed green, though it is capable of one cutting only, or the standing crop can be grazed. It cannot be used to produce silage, but in India it is preserved as hay under mild climatic conditions. In Egypt, as in Europe, the crop is never made into hay (Foaden and Fletcher, 1910). The dry store is of little value for feeding, and when fed alone, fresh young plants are reported to be harmful to horses, but not to sheep, cattle or rabbits. The dry seeds may be fed to poultry or livestock. Except for its noxious components, the seed com- position is more or less similar to that of other legumes. One hundred grams of edible portion include moisture, 10 g; protein, 25-28 g; fat, 1 g; total carbohydrate, 58-61 g (fibre, 15 g); and ash, 3 g (see also Hartman et al., 1974). The percentage of essen- tial amino acids is: arginine, 7.8; histidine, 2.5; leu- cine, 6.6; isoleucine, 6.6; lysine, 6.9; methionine, 0.4; phenylalanine, 4.1; threonine, 2.3; tryptophane, 0.4; valine, 4.7. The approximate composition of hay is: moisture, 15%; crude protein, 10%; fat, 2%; fiber, 36%; N-free extract, 31%; and ash, 6%. Toxicity : Human beings regularly consuming seeds of L. sativus or L. cicera , as well as L. clymenum, may develop a disease called lathyrism or more precisely neurolathyrism. It may also affect horses consuming these seeds. The disease generally appears whenever L. sativus comprises one third or one half of a human diet for a 3-6 months' period. It occurs particularly in times of famine and affects mostly young men between the ages of 20 and 29; with the incidence among females less frequent. The symptoms are mus- cular rigidity, weakness, and paralysis of leg muscles, and in extreme instances death. In most cases on record, the onset of the disease is sudden and seems to be precipitated by exposure to a wet environment and overwork. In milder cases, there is bending of the knees and difficulty in running. People with more advanced cases walk on their toes and require a stick for support. As the disease progresses bilateral sup- port is required and finally patients are reduced to crawling. In India, the only country today in which L. sativus is grown for human food on a large scale, the disease is a public health problem. A 1958 epidemio- logical survey indicated that in a particular district with a total population fo 634,000, there were as many as 25,000 cases of neurolathyrism. As yet, no cure is available for the disease. There are indications that the neurotoxin ß-jV-Oxalyl-L-o&lt; , ß- diaminopropionic acid (ODAP) is the chief factor responsible for the disease. However, attempts to produce the disease in small experimental animals by feeding the L. sativus seeds have not been successful. This may be due to rapid excretion and/or detoxifica- tion in the animal species tested. Besides L. sativus , L. cicera and L. clymenum , ODAP is also found in L. ochrus , L. sylvestris, L. tuberosus and other wild spe- cies of Lathyrus. Its concentration in L. clymenum and L. ochrus (of section Clymenum) is larger than in the other species (Bell, 1964). Experiments in food processing have revealed sev- eral ways of removing or at least reducing the neurotoxin: (a) cooking the pulse in an excess of water followed by draining off the water; (b) soaking over- night in cold water; (c) steeping the dehusked seeds in hot water; and (d) roasting the seeds at 150° for 20 minutes. These methods result in considerable, some- times almost complete detoxification. Steeped seeds can be easily dried in the sun, and the grains ground into flour. However, the use of the preprocessed flour in preparing various dishes and the effects of the procedures on palatability and nutritive quality remain to be investigated. The second approach for reducing the toxin con- tent is via genetic manipulation. A number of types have been identified with low concentrations of ODAP (less than 0.1%, compared with 0.5% of many commonly grown types). The propagation of such a variety, if suitable from the agricultural viewpoint, would perhaps be the ultimate method of eliminating the disease. The Lathyrus plant is not mentioned in the Bible, but it is recorded several times in the Rabbinic litera- ture (Roman period) as a food. They prepared groats from its seeds as they did with horse bean (Tosefta, Terumoth, 6, 11), and they cooked it with water in ways similar to lentil (Mishna, Tebul Yom 1,2). Two names of apparently cultivated Lathyrus - tofah and purkedan - are mentioned in the Mishna (Kilaim 1,1) but we are not sure about their exact meaning. It is generally accepted that one of the two refers to L. sativus and the second to L. cicera (or its relative L. sessilifolius). But it may also be that they refer to two different types of L. sativus. The plant is mentioned 143</page><page sequence="148">also in Columella ( 1 1 , x, 35): "In taste, at least, it (the chick pea) differs not at all from the chickling vetch". Archaeobotanyģ. L. sativus is reported from Neolithic sites as well as from later periods in the Near East and Europe (e.g., Helbaek, 1964) and in India (Vishnu-Mittre, 1974).2 However, as it is difficult to distinguish between charred seeds of L. sativus and L. cicera, one cannot always be sure whether the former or the latter, or perhaps both species are present in an archaeological find. A recent attempt to find a reliable character that can be used to distinguish between charred seeds of the two species in Neolithic Dimini (Greece) has been made by Kroll (1979). He ascribes the large, thick and rounded seeds to L. cf. sativus and the smaller, angu- lar ones with flat faces to L. cf. cicera. However, the author himself, by adding the word "confer" to the epithet, admits that this determination is not always conclusive. Admittedly, according to the data hitherto accum- ulated, except for taxonomy and morphology, no difference between the two species with respect to agronomic, economic, culinary or nutritional factors could be identified. Also, L. cicera , found rather frequently in smaller quantities within fields or stores of L. sativus, may be considered by the farmer as a variety of the more heterogenous L. sativus. In order to meet modern scientific requirements, one has to look for a safer method to distinguish between the seeds of L. sativus and L. cicera than measuring their size. Therefore, it was decided to use seed coat pat- tern for species identification. Magnifications of xlOOO and x5000 best exhibited the characteristic features. In order to study the two species, two seeds of 5 landraces of L. sativus andA of L. cicera were examined. L. sativus : Iran, Damaq, 1952-4, H. Kuckuck; Cyprus, (Figs. 3, 4); Greece, Peloponnesus, Supena, 1942; Bulgaria, Sofia, Centr. Inst. Agrie. Res.; Hungary, Tapioszele, Agro-Bot. Inst. (Figs. 1, 2). L. cicera: Israel, Shefela, Lahav, 26.4.67, A. Danin (HUJ); Greece, Joanina, Agrie. Res. Sta., 1941 (Figs. 9, 10); Peloponnesus, Aehlado- kambos, 1942 (Figs. 7, 8); Crete, NW Kiropetra, 1942. Landraces were kindly sent to us via Dr. H. Hanelt from ZI für Genetik und Kulturpflanzen- forschung Gatersleben, GDR, as well as Estaçao Agronomica Nacional, Portugal, via Prof. U. Plit- mann, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. No no- ticeable differences could be observed between the two seeds of each landrace. According to Lersten (1981), in most leguminous seeds the only useful distinguishing patterns occur near the hilum. At a certain distance, microscopic structures either become attenuated, completely obli- terated or, occasionally, they take a different form. In the tribe Vicieae and Trifolieae the pattern is papil- lose. The papilla is a protrusion from the tip of the individual epidermis cell (sometimes a membrane covers the papillae and prevents their observation, see Fig. 7). Even if a seed looks smooth to the naked eye, under the stereomicroscope (x50 magnification) the papillae may be seen as minute dots (Lersten, 1981). However, L. sativus and L. cicera show no particular difference in different regions of the seed coat. In charred legumes the seed coat is most often absent, because the heat loosens its bond to the coty- ledons. Even on that rare occasion that a rather small piece remains with the seed, its papillae (which are apparently more sensitive to heat and mechanical friction) are generally obliterated. Even careful han- dling in the laboratory may destroy the delicate struc- ture. However, shiny pieces of seed coat have better chances for showing the papillae under the scanning electron microscope. Here, too, coating with gold, and observation, may damage samples and prevent a clear image. About half of the seeds from Tell Qasile, however, retained at least a small piece of epidermis and about a third of the latter shows the seed coat pattern (Figs. 5, 6, 11, 12). Photographs (xlOOO) taken from above show that papillae of L. cicera are generally more dense but they project individually from the epidermis. The combi- 2 Additional archaeological finds of L. sativus/ cicera are reported for example from Egypt (P.E. Newberry in W.M. Flinders Petrie: Ha wara, Biahmu, and Arsinoé. 1889, p. 53 - Xii Dyn.

Magnifications x5000, photographed half from the side, show in L. sativus low, wide and more rounded papillae (sometimes high and conic) with blunt sum- mit (sometimes pointed) and long, rather radial, prominent ridges which descend from the summit and interconnect with neighbouring papillae (Figs. 2, 4) Seed coat of L. cicera shows higher and conic papillae with a pointed (sometimes rounded) summit and short, not so prominent ridges which do not reach the summit and are not connected to those of the neighbouring papillae (Figs. 8, 10). Size and shape of papilla is more variable in L. sativus than in L. cicera. It seems that there is some correlation between size of seed and density of papillae. The smaller seeds have more dense papillae. In the samples checked (06 and 168/2043) both L. sativus and L. cicera could be identified, but no quan- ta tive estimation has been made (Figs. 5,6 and 1 1 , 12). There is as yet no contemporary evidence of lathy- rism in ancient human populations. However, since it has recently been demonstrated that five out of two hundred patients with chronic neurolathyrism exhibit skeletal changes similar to experimental osteolathyrism (Cohn and Streifler, 1983) human remains of the period might be revealing in this respect.

THE LARGE MAMMAL BONES Simon Davis Department of Zoology, University College, University of London The following is a report on the large mammal bones found at the Early Iron Age site of Tell Qasile just north of Tel-Aviv. Most of the faunai remains are derived from layers XII-IX. The following animal species are represented: sheep, goat, cattle, pig, don- key, fallow deer, hippopotamus and camel. Sheep, goat and cattle were the most frequent and undoubt- edly provided the inhabitants of Tell Qasile with the bulk of their animal products and meat. A count of the total numbers of isolated lower third molars and posterior mandible fragments are as follows: sheep and goat 212, cattle 35, pig 4 and fallow deer 1. Cattle bones are probably over-represented since sieving was not undertaken in the excavations. A distinction between sheep and goat bones is difficult for most skeletal elements. If a separation is attempted the numbers which remain indistinguisha- ble are too large. Metapodia are however easily separated (see Payne 1969, for example). The numbers of sheep and goat metapodia were 25 and 12 respectively, and this may be used to estimate that the inhabitants of Tell Qasile slaughtered twice as many sheep as goats. This may reflect a preference for mutton, but does not neccessarily reflect the ratio of sheep to goat in their flocks or in the flocks owned by pastoralists from whom the animal purchases were made. Until data are available from more sites in the region, it is not possible to understand just what these figures represent. For example, in the Late Bronze Age levels at Tel es-Sharia in the northwest Negev, goat bones are more frequent than sheep. The differ- ence between the latter site and Tell Qasile may represent a cultural change through time or may reflect geographical or climate differences. Goat are better able to withstand the desert environment. The coastal plain was until recent historical times marshy, and this is borne out by the presence in Tell Qasile faunai assemblage of hippopotamus. Hippopotamus bones were first described from earlier excavations at Tell Qasile by Haas in 1953. Since then they were also found at other biblical sites: at Tel Aphek east of Tell Qasile and at Tel Dan just 148 north of the old Huleh lake. They were no doubt part of the wildlife endemic to these wet areas. The pres- ence of cut marks on at least one of the Tell Qasile hippo bones (a metacarpus) indicates they were prob- ably butchered for meat. In Table 1 the age breakdown of the sheep and goat mandibles from the 1972 season's excavation is given. Age classes are according to Payne (1973). The high frequency of older individuals indicates that sheep and/or goat were perhaps kept for their secondary products such as milk and wool as well as slaughtered for meat, although these older age groups may be somewhat over-represented in the absence of sieving. A single camel astragalus was found at Locus 168 (Stratum X). Camel is reported from an earlier pre- historic period, the Mousterian at Fara in the north- ern Negev (Grigson, in prep.). The camel is well adapted to arid conditions (Schmidt-Nielsen 1964) and this find represents an occurrence outside the desert region. It may therefore indicate the presence of a domestic camel. According to Van Beek (1969) the camel was an important means whereby frankin- cense and myrrh were transported from southern Arabia to the Levant in the first millennium B.C. Tables 2 to 6 give measurements in millemetres for various sheep, goat, cattle and other species' bones. Table 1. The sheep and goat mandibles from the 1972 excavation only.

DYED TEXTILE IMPRESSIONS FROM TEMPLE 200 Avigail Sheffer Tel Aviv Impressions of dyed textile were discovered in the north-western corner of Temple 200 (Locus 200), among fallen brick material, above the floor. No actual remains were preserved, yet traces of dye and impressions of fabric within the brick material pro- vide certain data. The textile had been woven of undyed, S-twisted yarn. Both warp and weft had 10 to 12 threads per cm. Most linen textiles found in Israel are of equal density in warp and weft.1 (Woollen textiles here generally have a denser weft.2) Traces of a light blue pigment were observed among the impressions. Blue is the only colour found dyeing linen in ancient textiles in Israel (as well as in Egypt) prior to the Roman period, for it was most difficult to dye linen fibres in any other shade.3 Among the impressions there were also small blobs of red pigment, perhaps indicating that there had also been some wool present as well, for wool can readily be dyed in many shades, and red was widely popular for dyeing that fibre.4 In Mesopotamia in the Neo- Babylonian period, statues of deities were occasion- ally dressed in costly garments of linen, colourfully ornamented with woollen threads.5 At the Iron Age II cultic site of Kuntillet Ajrud, an undyed linen textile was found, with coloured decoration of blue-dyed linen and red-dyed wool (the latter, as often found, led to the decomposition of the woollen fibres).6 1 Avigail Sheffer, "Comparative Analysis of a 'Negev Ware' Textile Impression from Tel Masos", Tel Aviv 3 (1976), 86. 2 Louisa Bellinger, "Textile Analysis: Early lechniques in Egypt and the Near East", The Textile Museum Workshop Notes , Paper No. 2, Washington 1950, 2. 3 Elisabeth Riefstahl, Patterned Textiles in Pharaonic Łgypt, Brooklyn 1944, 28, 29; Louisa Bellinger, "The Bible as a Source Book for the Study of Textiles", The Textile Museum Workshop Notes , Paper No. 18, Washington 1958, 4. 4 Ibid. ; Y.

The pottery in this catalogue is registered according to the strata and loci, in the same order as in the lists of loci published in Qedem 12, pp. 19, 31 and 48. The number after the class refers to the type number according to our Type Series. The numbers in the right side of each column refer to the number of complete or almost complete examples, while the numbers in brackets refer to sherds. The lists contain both the pottery published in Figures 1 1-51 as well as pottery which has only been registered. Comparison between the Figures (references are given under each locus'number from which pottery is published in the Figures) to the lists in the catalogue provides an idea concerning the quantities of published and unpub- lished pottery in each locus. As explained above (p. 24), the following is an abridged form of the detailed catalogue, which can be consulted at the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
