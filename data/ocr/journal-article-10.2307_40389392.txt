Norman Published online: 25 September 2009 O Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009 Abstract Situated along the "Slave Coast" of West Africa, the international coastal trading entrepôt of Ouidah is infamous as the point of embarkation for hundreds of thousands of people spirited into the Middle Passage. Accordingly, scholars have looked to it and the surrounding region as a font of culture and history for diasporic groups. In scholarly narratives, the larger Gbe-speaking region surrounding Ouidah is characterized as the homeland of Vodun, a religious tradition that influenced diasporic religions throughout the Atlantic world. This paper explores early Huedan Vodun at a local level and works to bolster, and at the same time problematize, the project of addressing Vodun at increasing geographic scales and temporal depths. It builds on longstanding research which recognizes that context is critical for interpreting possible ritual or religious significance of archaeological material.

Nonetheless, it provides a point of intellectual departure and highlights the unambiguous religious and symbolic importance of holes and excavated spaces in modern Vodun landscapes (Blier 1995a: 38). Moreover, the composite nature of the definition, which brings together elements of Ewe and Yoruba, speaks to the amalgamative aesthetic that underpins the ever-emerging character of modern Vodun (Drewal 1996; Rush 1999, 2001). The role of Vodun as "messenger" is also an unambiguous one, yet at times the news can be good, at times bad. Vodun nonetheless always posits a "link, a mutual interdependence" between the physical and cosmological worlds (Bay 2008: 5). In attempting to deepen our temporal understanding of the material, spatial, and socio-cultural dimensions of Vodun, this paper investigates a series of 1 7th- and 18th-century offering locales that I argue were used by Huedan3 initiates in efforts to channel and concentrate the cosmological forces of Vodun. In the historiography of the region, scholars often subsume explorations of Vodun into their discussions of the intersection of Atlantic economic and political 2 E. Kofi Agorsah, pers. comm., Jan. 2009, suggested that Gilli's translation of the Ewe word vo may need further fieldwork to confirm. I use Hueda (or Huedan as an adjective) to describe the 17th- through 18th-century coastal polity located in the modern Republic of Bénin also known as Fida (Dutch), Ajuda (Portuguese), Whydah (English), Ouidah (French), Xueda, Quedah, Quittah, etc. I use Ouidah to describe the orthographical ly ambiguous Huedan coastal trading center known locally as Gléhué.

In turn, they each attempted to avoid domination and loss from wholesale regional warfare spurred by political, economic, social, and personal contests. After a tumultuous period in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Dahomey emerged- victorious following a campaign of conquest between 1724 and 1727, whereby its king, Agaja, ordered Dahomean troops against first Aliada, and then Hueda. In so doing, Agaja consolidated political control over an area between the Abomey plateau and the coast (Law 1991). During the early documented history of the region, towns, often with palaces near their centers, served as locales where international transactions were negotiated. To feed the soaring demand for captives, local kings and elites relied not only on local raids, but also on longstanding trading networks that linked the Dahomey Gap region to the forest zone located to the east and west, and the Sahel region to the north (Brooks 1993; Law 1989a). The cosmopolitan character of the 17th- and 18th- century trading towns of the region is exemplified by markets containing fine items drawn from throughout the region, and the far reaches of the emerging globalized world (Phillips 1732: 227). Based largely on European travelers' accounts of such regional and international processes, the historical narrative of the Hueda kingdom provides rich details of how local people living in and around the Huedan palace complex at Savi5 parlayed trade It is beyond the scope of this paper to present an atlas of the historiography of the region or Hueda. For reviews, see Akinjogbin (1967), Bay (1998), and Law (1989a, b, 1990, 1991, 2004). This paper builds on efforts (e.g., Bay 2008; Blier 1995a) to explore and foreground the material culture of Vodun and specifically describe the active role that such objects played in mediating and producing cultural processes. 5 Kenneth Kelly first used archaeological and ethno-historic techniques to identify the historically known Huedan palace at Savi.

This paper shifts discussion away from the meta-issues of the Atlantic and the political economy of regional polities, to the level of house compounds archaeologically recorded in the town of Savi and its surrounding countryside. It argues that archaeologically recovered material from 17th- and 18th- century ritual spaces relates in a direct way to the sacred mixed media used in religious rituals today, as well as to the objects recorded in the historical accounts of European travelers. However, this paper does not view ritual and religious practices in modern Atlantic Africa as conservative relics of static cultures. Rather, it seeks to highlight the historically unfolding dynamics and processes of ritualization materialized in the archaeological record (Stahl 2008), and underscores ritual spaces as longstanding locales where dislocation and flux associated with the emerging globalized world, and later the slave trade, were negotiated (Baum 1999; Comaroff and Comaroff 1993; Goody 1957). Part of this fluidity relates to the unselfconscious accumulative aesthetic associated with Vodun. Paul Mercier argues convincingly that below the surface of apparent conservatism in Vodun lies innovation and the need to assimilate such that: On the one hand, these people who today seem to be so conservative - at all events in the religious sphere - have always displayed an innovating spirit, even in that very sphere. Their religion and their cosmology undoubtedly have composite origins; up to quite a recent date they have borrowed, and more or less completely assimilated, a number of very diverse elements. (Mercier 1 960: 212) Suzanne Blier (1995a: 62) similarly characterizes the organizing principle or "primacy of assemblage" in Vodun arts and material culture as mixed media, where many different parts work together to form a single entity. Henry Drewal (1996: 308) echoes such a classification when he notes that devotees of Marni Wata take exotic objects, interpret them according to indigenous precepts, invest them with new meanings, and then re-represent them in inventive ways to serve their own devotional and social needs. Edna Bay (1998: 22) adds a historical dimension in describing Dahomeans acquiring "new" vodun during the precolonial period: Dahomeans were always on the alert for deities of proven capability. A vodun that worked well for another community would be welcomed. Immigrants, including war captives, often carried their vodun with them and installed them in Dahomey. Dahomeans were sometimes sent to neighboring areas to be trained as priests of new gods. Vodun even arrived as spoils of war. The remainder of this paper discusses such dynamism with the goal of more thoroughly contextualizing the material dimension of early Vodun in the region surrounding Ouidah. In so doing, it argues that a consideration of context- cultural, historical, and spatial - is critically important for interpreting the ritual or religious significance of an artifact (Insoll 2004). Early Huedan Vodun David Eltis (2009) and his associates estimate that between 1650 and 1726, 183,702 captives were spirited from Ouidah beach, the vast majority of whom would never return. For this period, the Huedan palace complex at Savi was the primary point of Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 18 191 trans-Atlantic exchange between European traders and Huedan elites, as well as local social and political processes (Law 1991, 2004). This paper presents recently collected archaeological data from the town, rural villages, and outlying palace centers (Fig. 3) surrounding Savi (Norman 2008). The principal occupation of these sites is between the mid- 17th century and March of 1727, when troops from the nearby polity of Dahomey defeated Hueda and burned a majority of the sites found within 5 km of the palace (Kelly 2001; Law 1991; Norman 2008). Alain Sinou (1994) characterizes the Huedan trade entrepôt at Ouidah, and the post- 1727 Dahomean Ouidah, as the cradle of Vodun. This depiction is echoed by Suzanne Blier (1995a, b), who suggests that the larger region encompassing the modern Republic of Benin is the place where Vodun was born. Some of the earliest documentary accounts of Vodun address religious practices in the Kingdom of Hueda dating to the mid- 17th to early 18th century. This period was a time of punctuated economic prosperity as well as extraordinary intra-regional and regional inter-polity conflict (Law 1991). As for religious life in 17th-century Hueda, Mawu is chronicled as the supreme deity who was too distant for individuals to approach Fig. 3 Archaeological sites investigated during the 2005-2006 field season Ö Springer</page><page sequence="6">1 92 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 1 8 through direct worship (Greene 1996: 131). Willem Bosman (1705: 368), a Dutch trader who visited Hueda between 1697 and 1699, recorded that Huedans ascribed to Mawu, ...attributes of Almighty, and Omnipresent; they believe he created the Universe, and therefore, vastly prefer him before their Idol-Gods: But yet, they do not pray to him, or offer any Sacrifices to him; for which they give the following Reasons. God, say they, is too high exalted above us, and too great to condescend so much as to trouble himself or think of Mankind: Wherefore he commits the government of the World to their [secondary gods] ... On those vodun falling beneath Mawu in the hierarchical Huedan pantheon, late 17th- and early 18th-century European travelers described with virtual unanimity the python deity Dangbe as a primary, and the tutelary, deity for the kingdom. Bosman (1705: 369) notes that "They invoke the snake in excessive wet, dry, or barren seasons; on all occasions relating to their government and the preservation of their cattle, or rather in one word, in all necessities and difficulties, in which they do not apply to their new batch of gods." Bosman's notation of "their new batch of gods" provides a line of evidence suggesting both that the accumulative principle in Huedan Vodun was practiced early on, and that Huedans amassed new deities from the multi-ethnic and international communities found around the coastal trading entrepôt at Ouidah and the palace at Savi.6 Yet, another example of a regional appropriation is Yoruba Ifá divination practiced in Hueda by the early to mid- 18th century and apparently transferred from there to Anlo territory in the southeastern region of modern-day Ghana (Greene 2000: 98, cf. Thornton 1998: 240-241). The early trade towns of Hueda were points of confluence for deities of African and Atlantic origins and socio-religious crucibles, where the accumulative aesthetic of local religious tra- ditions annealed newfound vodun onto the Huedan pantheon. Bosman (1705: 368) estimated that the Huedan pantheon contained 120,000 deities, a figure that should be viewed more as hyperbole than an actual census of cosmological actors. Nonetheless, numerous deities inhabited the Huedan pantheon. English slave trader Thomas Phillips (1732: 223-225), after his 1694 visit to Savi, described several public temples and points of personal worship around Savi. However, there were, in the eyes of some European traders at least, common material and spatial themes used to represent at least some vodun. After his c. 1680 visit to Hueda, French merchant Jean Barbot recorded that: "The fetishes of the king, like those of the people, are all made of wood or earth, and are large and white, and shaped like puppets. An infinite number of them is placed in special places on the roads..." (Hair et al. 1992: 638). Phillips (1732: 224)7 noted similarly that "I have often seen little figures of clay about their houses, with oil, rice, corn, and other offerings before them ..." Fortunately, both accounts posit links between the ritual process linking the palace center at Savi to houses in surrounding nearby towns and villages. 6 For a discussion of the multi-ethnic community at Ouidah, see Law (2004). If modern Vodun practices can be used as a guide, such features may relate to Legba shrines. 5&gt;ee section below. &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="7">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 18 1 93 Unfortunately, along with a few other documentary accounts, these few written sketches presented earlier represent the extent of our knowledge of the material dimension of 17th-century Huedan religious life. The remainder of this paper works to expand our understanding of early Huedan Vodun through contextualizing a series of archaeological structures, features, and finds with spoken accounts and documentary sources. First, it is important to explore the objects that most aided in the interpretation of archaeological ritual settings: modern examples of hand-built, low-fired ceramic vessels and statuary. "Pottery Does the Things of Vodun" Suzanne Blier (1995a: 302) recorded the earlier mentioned quote from a modern Vodun practitioner in the Abomey area, and it seems an apt characterization of the active role that ceramics play in framing ceremonies, marking sacred spaces, and serving as offering receptacles in Vodun shrines. Indeed, research among modern Vodun practitioners indicates that discrete collections of ceramics can serve as signal referents relating a shrine to a particular deity (Kelly and Norman 2004; Norman 2000). The production, installation, and consecration of such vessels, sometimes taking the form of effigy statuary,8 are governed by a series of ritual restrictions. Today in southern Benin, the creation of ritual ceramics among Gbe-speaking groups is strictly the purview of post-menopausal women; they begin supervised training in forming such vessels at an early age, but only fire ritual vessels after menopause (Adandé 1987: 47; Beier 1980: 48; David 1983: 132-133; Norman 2000; Savary 1970: 36). One reason given for the social restrictions associated with Vodun ceramics is the power and potentiality surrounding the vessels as receptacles of the aesthetic elements of the four physical realms that vodun inhabit (Norman 2000). Earth, fire, air, and water are combined through the process of transforming moist clay to hardened earthenware by open-air firings (Djidiohou-Agba, pers. comm. July, 1999).9 The clay used to create such pottery is considered a gift of the rainbow serpent, Dan Wedo (Adandé 1987: 40). Yet the products of mixing cosmological and material elements, namely modern ritual ceramics, are available for purchase in local markets without restrictions. Often, ritual specialists prescribe what ceramics and other items are needed for a given shrine or ceremony and their clients then acquire the necessary items from the market (Norman 2000: 69). The act of consecration by a ritual specialist is considered the transformative event that activates the inert collection of ceramics and other items into charged sacred spaces (Cudjoe 1971: 190). The act of transformation involves role-inversions where ceramic objects at use in mundane aspects of daily life are used to underpin the most sacred spaces in the Vodun world (Bay 2008; Norman 2000). Accordingly, Claude Savary (1970: 48) is correct to 8 See Aronson (2007: 81) and Norman (2000). 9 For a technical and morphological discussion of ritual ceramics in southern Bénin, see (David 1983) and Norman (2000). For a similar discussion of smithing, see McNaughton's (1979) discussion of Nyama, the Bamana term for energy in action which blacksmiths use to transform billet into usable tools, but a force that can also become unstable and dangerous during such acts of transformation. &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="8">1 94 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 1 8 point out that context of use rather than formal morphological characteristics should be considered the defining qualities of ritual ceramics. During modern ceremonies, religious officiates often use calabashes to convey offerings to the shrines, but it is ceramic vessels placed before the shrine that commonly hold offerings for vodun (Savary 1970: 43). Shrines with consecrated and dedicated collections of ceramics are found throughout modern house compounds in southern Benin. Vessels for holding sacrifices to Legba, the trickster deity who serves as messenger within the Vodun pantheon and also between humans and vodun, are arranged near points of access and egress in house compounds (Argyle 1966: 188). Although there are distinctions between du-Legba shrines dedicated to communities and a-Legba shrines associated with families and specifically male members of the family, both types have ceramic offerings, and at times human burials, positioned beneath their aboveground, mounded, unfired clay avatars (Cudjoe 1971; Gilbert 1982). Roof overhangs shield shrines from torrential seasonal rain. Also under the house eaves and near to the doorway are found shrines with bridged, twin vessels dedicated to the twin deity Hoho (Fig. 4). Inverted pots are used to cover shrines to the family deity or Aiza, which is located centrally within house compounds. At the foot of baobab trees and in free-standing shrines just beyond the house compound, danzen10 (Fig. 5) or dangbezen ceramics can be found with small snake appliqués that indicate an affiliation with the serpent deity, Dan (Herskovits and Herskovits 1933: 69-74; Norman 2000). At times, initiates use ceramic vessels from these shrines as receptacles for offerings in socially binding ceremonies that mark, sanction, and guarantee economic transactions, family relations, and other promises to be kept (Hazoumé 1956). Adjalalazen (Fig. 6), perforated ceramics jars,11 are found in numerous modem shrines variously associated with ancestral deities and other cosmological actors (Herskovits and Herskovits 1933: 69-74; Norman 2000). There appears to be a larger theme in the region of using perforated ceramic vessels in ritual settings. Leonard Crossland and Merrick Posnansky (1978: 84-85) record that perforated ritual pots are used by the Mo and Panteras in Western Ghana. The Igbo of Eastern Nigeria use large perforated vessels with similar formal characteristics (Fagg and Picton 1970: 27). On the subject of Akan funerary customs witnessed in the early 20th century, Robert Rattray (1927: 164-165) writes that 5 days after a death, family mourners created a hut on the outskirts of the village into which they placed a mortar, "strainer," cooking hearthstones, a new pot, and a spoon. Then, a figurine constructed to represent the deceased was placed on a pot filled with hair from living family members and other offerings such as blood. Olalekan Akinade (1995: 118-119) notes the ajere perforated vessel used by the Yoruba in and around the village of Ogga, where only prepubescent or post-menopausal women are able to create this vessel type because of its ritual significance. 10 In the Gbe language cluster, the suffix -zen indicates ceramics (cf. Savary 1970: 36). Thus, danzai translates literally as ceramic for/of the serpent deity, dan. David (1983: 170) suggests that perforations on adjalalazen represent the pocked scars of smallpox. These vessels are common in modern shrines to Sakapata, the deity of smallpox (Norman 2000). In the 19th century, Richard Burton noted a "perforated pot" in the same shrine that contained a "Bo-doll" (Burton 1966[1864]: 178-79). ^Springer</page><page sequence="9">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 18 1 95 Fie. 4 Modern hohozen vessel Following the common ritual media of perforated ceramics, there appears to be a structural theme of female potters throughout modern West Africa creating ceramic vessels and figurative objects which are primarily destined for ceremonial or ritual contexts. From research in Nigeria, Maria Berns (1993) argues that through constructing such objects, women have long served as producers and transmitters of symbolic repertoires, and thus actively participate in the construction of social and cultural meaning through the materiality of ceramics. Indeed, in the modern religious practices of the region, locally produced earthenware vessels channel meaning, attract the attention of cosmological actors, and frame ceremonies that ensure balance.

While conducting research in the Yoruba region, Robert Farris Thompson (1969: 130-131) records that altars for Eyinle are domestic clay platforms set within one room of the house compound and contain a diverse array of objects and ritual paraphernalia. Thompson suggests that Eyinle shrines must have a wrought-iron staff for the medicine-god or to honor the river-god's own considerable powers of healing. He argues that, above all, each house shrine must hold an earthenware, lidded vessel, filled with fluvial water and stones. Thompson characterizes these vessels as one of the very few objects that form the "irreducible unit of the cult paraphernalia" (Thompson 1969: 131). Alongside their utility in marking points where members of one's pantheon is venerated, earthenware vessels in the region also serve as markers for points on the landscape where patriarchal and matriarchal figures are venerated. John McCall (1995) notes that among the 25 villages in the Igbo-speaking Ohafia region in Nigeria, female ancestors are memorialized with pots called ududu which are embedded in, the kitchen hearth, and ancestors are memorialized with pots known asfiu mon. General trends can be identified among the formal characteristics of modern ritual ceramics in southern Benin, which can be used alongside depositional contexts to interpret archaeological features in the Savi countryside. Modern ritual ceramics are expediently constructed and low-fired, barely having made the transition from clay to ceramic. They often exhibit thick and uneven rims and shoulders. These findings point to their creation specifically for use in shrines, a zone of the house compound where potters suggest objects are not subject to intense daily use (Norman 2000). l2 Modern ritual ceramics are rarely decorated with rouletting, incisions, or burnishing common on utilitarian wares (David 1983: 169; Norman 2000); however, exceptions in southern Benin include awogbãn and lebezen vessels (Figs. 7 and 8) which have burnished "x" pattern in their interiors. In the broader region, Yoruba diviners use bowls with circular and linear appliqués that divide the interior of the bowl into five 12 Nonetheless, modern ritual ceramics are subjected to the elements, children at play, and curious livestock. &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="11">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 18 1 97 Fig. 7 Modern awogbãn vessel, note dark lines burnished onto vessel's interior sections to contain the materials of divinations, such as string and palm nuts (Fatunsin 1992: 63-65, Plates 61-63). The punctate "x" motif within a circle decorates the exterior of otun osun vessels, used in modern times by barren women in ceremonies that aid in conception (Fatunsin 1992: 63-64), not to be mistaken for the incised marks on the exterior and interior of Yorubaland vessels used in modern times as maker's marks (Fatunsin 1992: 74). Throughout the Bight of Benin region, anthropomorphic or zoomorphic appliqués and decorations are diagnostic features of modern ritual ceramics.13 It is important to note, however, that when building shrines, ritual specialists often place vessels otherwise used for cooking or storage alongside the single-use ritual ceramics as described above (Norman 2000). As Anthonia Fatunsin (1992: 54) notes for the broader region, it is highly likely that the use of hand-built earthenware ceramics in ritual settings deeply predates the emergence of trans-Atlantic exchange. The challenge thus emerges to work backwards from the wealth of documentary, spoken, and material sources outlined earlier to the more opaque - in evidentiary terms at least - archaeological past (Stahl 2001). Fortunately, it appears that modern ceramic vessels for sale in the ritual market at Ouidah appear to relate in a direct way to a series of ceramics used in sacred settings dating to at least the 19th century. An illustration from Les Missions Catholique, 1875 (reprinted in Blier 1995a: 1 19) portrays a vodun shrine containing a vase-like gozen (Fig. 9) vessel in the background of the image. In the foreground, we can see a representation of a lisazen (Fig. 10) vessel consisting of two parts: a 13 For a similar characterization see Fatunsin (1992: 32) , who argues that in Yoruba religious veneration, the design on ritual ceramics often reflect some of the attributes of the divinity the pot is used to venerate.

Locally produced ceramic vessels apparently played an important religious role during the Huedan era, ca. 1650-1727, as well. Dutch geographer Olfert Dapper (1970 [1686]: 307) noted after his trip to Allada in the mid- 17th century that principal family shrines in Aliada were covered with a "pot percé" or perforated vessel similar to the modern adjalalazen described earlier. Dapper reports that Alladan families conducted ceremonies at 6-month intervals during which a hired ritual specialist offered beer, food, and other gifts to a shrine. Thereafter, the ritual specialist made requests and inquiries of the shrine on behalf of the family. This account is supported by 17th-century Capuchin missionaries to the area who recorded shrines at Aliada containing ceramic vessels with blood, feathers, and roots that served to materialize prayers, requests, and devotion (Labourct and Rivet 1929). In a similar fashion, an anonymous European (translation of the account in Bay 2008: 43-44; cf. Law 1991: 107), who visited Savi ca. 1714, noted that the "somewhat higher-ranking" Huedans: ...each have in their home their own God, not including the general one, these are pieces of iron in the form of bells on which there are different relief figures, these bells fit on branches of iron that they stick in the ground; some clay pots and other similar things, it's on these iron fetishes that have a bit of iron or a £} Springer</page><page sequence="13">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 18 1 99 Fig. 9 Modern gozen vessel stone inside to make noise and on these pots that they pour the blood of animals that they sacrifice in their houses. What emerges from this brief review of the historical literature of the region is a clear affinity between modes of Vodun worship and locally produced ceramics. Fortunately for archaeological study, such ceramics are numerous in the archaeological record of the region (Kelly 1995: 139-161; Norman 2008: 279-348). Indeed, locally produced ceramics are the most durable material legacy of the international trading entrepôt that was Savi. Yet, the challenge remains to discern in the archaeological record, the utilitarian ceramics from the religious ones and the quotidian spaces from the sacred ones. The two following sections present archaeological material from a recent field campaign in the region surrounding Savi. The discussion starts with a description of the largest and most elaborate structures and features interpreted as religious spaces and then proceeds to use spatial and formal qualities of those areas to interpret more ephemeral ones. Each of the archaeological contexts described below exhibited evidence of catastrophic burning in the early 18th century, most likely related to the aforementioned raid by the nearby polity of Dahomey in March of 1727. Datable Dutch trade pipes and the terminus ante quern of the burning lens indicate that the primary occupational range of the sites described hereafter was between ca. 1650 and 1727 (Norman 2008).

Shrines were points in and around the house compound where family members would have £l Springer</page><page sequence="14">200 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 1 8 Fig. 10 Modern lisazen vessel worshiped in private or as part of semi-public ceremonies often led by heads of the family and hired ritual specialists (cf. Bay 2008: 15-41). Such shrines are mentioned in historical accounts of the palace at Savi. After his ca. 1680 visit to Hueda, French trader Jean Barbot noted that "The prince [Agbangla?] is very superstitious and a slave of his fetishes, of which the palace is full" (Hair et al. 1992: 638). Given the political tension in the region as well as within the polity of Hueda, it is not surprising that the Huedan king was earnestly communing with cosmological actors who were considered to bring both wealth and balance (Law 1991: 109-110). Beyond framing subjective acts of individual worship, the historical record suggests that these locales were theaters of social action for broader household and community rites. It is equally clear that those supplicants who worshiped before shrines in the late 17th to early 18th century in Hueda provided offerings and sacrifices. In a sense, the structure of the ceremony resembled acts of feasting, used widely in other spheres of Huedan political negotiation. In these ceremonies, officiates and ritual specialists installed offerings of food and blood in the shrine in a manner that rendered it impossible to use otherwise or return. Historical sources indicate that a portion of such sacrifice in the region was reserved for the ritual specialist performing the ceremony and the host family (Dapper 1970[1686]: 307). Thus, the act of immolation, consumption, and contribution was shared by the various participants of the ceremony. Michael Dietler (2001: 66) argues that such feasts are "theater[s] of political relations" where people create, maintain, and contest positions of power and authority within a structured system in pursuit of their conflicting interests and at times transforming the systems themselves. There can be little doubt of the close relationship between organizing ceremonies aimed at attracting the attention of cosmological actors, restricting precious items from networks of circulation, and the successful exercise of political authority. Within the Huedan social world, it appears that such feasting lavished on cosmological actors involved not only organic foodstuff but also hard currency and trade items. â Springer</page><page sequence="15">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 18 20 1 At a site (Locus 2) interpreted as an outlying settlement approximately 2 km south of Savi, excavators dug a test unit (Unit 1) to sample the highest concentration of Hueda-era local ceramics recorded during an archaeological survey of the region (Fig. 11). The unit explored the central portion of a collapsed structure ca. 3 m in diameter, adjacent to the main wing of a collapsed house compound. Spatially, this small free-standing structure was constructed between a boundary ditch/borrow pit and the interior of the house compound. The form of the structure and its spatial placement vis-à-vis the other elements of the house compound is similar to historically known Dahomean "spirit house" or djeho, literally translated as a "bead house" (Blier 1991: 45). The opening layer of the unit revealed Hueda-era local ceramics, and contemporary imported items including a yellow-and-black-striped trade bead, iron fasteners, imported pipe fragments, and perforated local ceramic vessel (adjalalazen) fragments.14 Extrapolating from larger sherds, these perforated vessels were globular in shape and the potters who created them used a circular reed or other organic stylus to pierce the base, shoulder, and body of vessels. A majority of the perforated vessel sherds exhibited sharp edges on the interior of their perforations, indicative of vessels not used in daily cooking or food processing activities. Early on in the excavation of the unit, excavators recovered a round vessel similar in construction and form to a ritual vessel, or golizen (Fig. 12) - used in modern times to contain offerings (Norman 2000: 80-82) - along the southern edge of the unit within a wall matrix. Apparently this offering vessel was cached in the wall at the time of its construction. At approximately the same depth (60 cm below the opening level of the unit), excavators noted the edge of a shallow bowl in the northern wall of the unit. After expanding the unit to explore this bowl, the excavation team recorded that the vessel contained a fragmentary human cranium (Fig. 13). Nearby, the excavation team recorded another fragmentary cranium with mandible. Both crania were disarticulated from post-cranial material prior to deposition and located in primary context: the cranium and mandible were recovered encased within local ceramic storage jar fragments and the other fragmentary cranium was recovered on the aforementioned shallow bowl. Apparently, both vessels were placed on a rammed earth surface or floor as were the associated imported and local offering items. From historical accounts of the region, shrines containing skulls normally relate to two, though not necessarily mutually exclusive, commemorative events: the memorialization of patriarchal and matriarchal figures, and the celebration of military victory (Law 1989a, b). In the first, it was common to remove the skull of a prominent family member, often after months or a few years of internment, and install it in a place of religious prominence for veneration.15 European visitors to the Hueda kingdom noted that in the 18th century, captives taken by Huedan soldiers 14 Earlier in this paper, 1 argued that in the modern religious practices of the region, there appears to be a regionally reoccurring preference for perforated ceramic vessels in ritual settings. It appears from excavations at Aseye rocksheiter, Ifife-Ijumu in southwest Nigeria (Allsworth-Jones 1996: 320) and Old Oyo by Willet (1961: 76), and Crossland and Posnansky (1978) at Begho in Ghana that perforated ceramics were common in archaeological assemblages dating to the 1 7th and 1 8th century. In both the Ghananian and Nigerian examples, the authors used modern rites to interpret the archaeological material as having ritual significance. 15 David (1983: 174) notes that large ceramic cooking vessels are used by the Gun in southern Benin to contain the skulls of family members &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="16">202 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 1 8 Fig. 1 1 Locus 2 planview, 2005-2006 excavations belonged to them as did heads collected after battle, which were placed in their households.

This practice extended to those royals beyond the immediate battle, as Dahomean kings would often not consider the conquest of an area complete until the head of the rival king had been collected and positioned in a shrine or other prominent place in the Dahomean palace at Abomey. On this topic, Robin Law (1989a, b: 413) writes that by collecting the skulls of their enemies' kings, Dahomean conquerors: ...ruptured the dynastic continuity of the vanquished communities (thus, presumably facilitating their incorporation into Dahomey) and deprived them Fig. 13 Excavated shrine, locus 2 unit 1 Ext £) Springer</page><page sequence="18">204 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 1 8 of the supernatural support they would normally anticipate from a deceased king. In the Dahomean social world, skulls serve as symbols and dynamic elements of ceremonies that reinforce the notion that life springs from death (Suzanne Blier, pers. comm., March 2009). The possession of a king's skull would be a powerful source of authority over a conquered population as well as means to call forth the demographic regeneration ofthat polity after a decimating war. There is good evidence to suggest that the skulls of fallen adversaries held a prominent, perhaps even revered, place within the Dahomean palace. Slave trader and would-be historian Robert Noms (1791: 134-35), after his visit to the area in the 1770s, recorded that King Kpengla of Dahomey preserved the head of a claimant to the royal stool in 1775, in the palace complex at Abomey "lying on a china [basin]..." Noms recounts a conversation with Kpengla, where the king commented on the aforementioned skull that, "I am a warrior myself, and if I should fall into the enemies [sic] hands, could wish to be treated with the decency, of which I set the example" (Norris 1791: 134-35, italics in original). As for the archaeological vessels containing the skulls, the interior of the base of the shallow bowl has an incised decorative pattern. The sharp edges of the incised lines suggest that the vessel was not used in grinding or other abrading activities. The form of the interior decoration is an incised quatrefoil "x" pattern highlighted as it stands in negative relief within a cross-hatched or lozenge-incised field (Fig. 14). The entire "x" pattern is enclosed within an incised circle. The rim of the vessel was slipped with red slurry evocative of the blood offerings probably presented to the shrine. Taken together, the symbolic composite is similar to the Dahomean cosmographie marker or weke applied to thrones, drums, and bas reliefs in the Abomey area. The weke represents the four directions and the four main vodun associated with them (cf. Blier 1991: 49).16 Paul Mercier (1960: 220-4) gives a similar description of the Dahomean universe and its successive stages of organization. The universe is a sphere which may be compared with two halves of a calabash, the edges of which match exactly; the join is the line of the horizon. The surface of the earth, which is flat, lies on this horizontal plane. The first sphere is enclosed in another large sphere, and between the two are the waters... Dan set up four iron pillars at the cardinal points to support the sky. When Lisa traversed the earth as the dispenser of civilizations, he made four halts in the four quarters of space, thus distributing men over four countries. Similar ritual vessel forms- shallow bowls- with a burnished and encircled "x" can be purchased in the modern ritual markets of Ouidah and Abomey.

At another site (Locus 4) in the Savi countryside interpreted as a settlement center, ca. 1.5 km north of the palace, excavators recorded a possible temple or ritual complex: a structure with a central courtyard where several of the surrounding rooms, the courtyard, and outlying buildings each contained shrines and offering spaces (Fig. 15). At this site, excavators placed a test excavation (Unit 5) centered on a collapsed wing of the complex. The unit itself sampled a burned interior room that had been sealed by a collapsed wall. The unit contained a cache (/?= 12) of faceted colorless trade beads alongside fragments of a large non-utilitarian vessel known in modern times as a gozin (Norman 2000: 80-82). With the gozin fragments (Fig. 16), excavators recorded carbonized oil palm nuts and six knapped siliceous mudstone flakes, all of which apparently originated from the same core. The vessel is unique in the archaeological assemblage in that it exhibits horizontal applied cordons, or ribs - diagnostic features of modern gozin vessels- along the neck and shoulder and multiple openings with individual rolled rims along the body of the vessel. Modern Vodun practitioners use gozin, though without the secondary openings along the neck and shoulder, to mark shrines associated with patriarchal or matriarchal figures and royals, or as offering vessels for sacred water, such as the annual ceremony to water the pythons in Ouidah (Akindele and Renaud 1953; David 1983: 153). £} Springer</page><page sequence="20">206 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 1 8 Fig. 15 Locus 4 planview, 2005-2006 excavations In apparent accordance with the archaeological finding of cordon-applied ceramics from ritual settings alone in the Savi countryside, Peter Garlake (1977: 88) argues that from excavations at ïfé domestic and ritual vessels can be distinguished by form, finish, and decoration: utilitarian ceramics are decorated with cord, roulette, and blade while ritual ceramics are decorated with painting, stylus, and applied cordon. Similarly at Komenda in Ghana, David Calvocoressi (1975: 127-128, Fig. 4) recorded an assemblage of small pots, some of them containing cordons around the neck. Alongside this collection of small pots, which Calvocoressi interpreted as a ritual setting, were placed several grinding stones, one with a hollow on the top for cracking oil palm nuts. Calvocoressi records vessels similar to gozin with raised cordons on the neck recovered in a burial context. He argues that their closest regional analogs come from the sites of Twifo Hemang and Ahinsan, Ghana, where they were recovered with terracotta heads alongside numerous burials that contained a heavy lense of 18th- and 19th-century material. Likewise, Leo Frobenius (1980 [1913]: 215), after his 1910-1912 work at Ifé, documents a large gozin-like vessel with openings on the neck and shoulder. In the Savi countryside, the archaeological recovery of gozin fragments alongside imported offering items indicates a ritual context, as does the recovery in the nearby Unit 6 of a highly friable ceramic anthropomorphic figurine along with river-smoothed cobbles. Such cobbles are used in modern times by post-menopausal women as offerings to various shrines (Antoine Agomadje, pers. comm., November 2005). The unit itself sampled a small freestanding structure located between the interior of the structure and the steep slope of a Ö Springer</page><page sequence="21">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 1 8 207 Fig. 16 Archaeologically recovered vessel (gozin) the first example described in text, the following example presented for comparison nearby ditch segment. This structure appears to be another freestanding shrine similar to the aforementioned one at Locus 2. The ceramic figurine is slightly cone-shaped with a flat base and applied stylized breasts (Fig. 17). The figurine's head was broken prior to deposition, yet extrapolating from similar statuary recovered nearby by Kenneth Kelly (1995: 157-1961) in contemporary deposits, it is probable that the head would have exhibited elongated facial features including the eyes, nose, and mouth. Kelly (2001: 91) notes that such figurines had a possible ritual significance, an interpretation supported by the context in which the current figurine was recovered. It is unclear whether these figurines relate to a class of more personal deities represented by bo and bocio figures (Blier 1995a), anthropomoiphic ceramic effigies used in modern times to represent more corporate deities (e.g., Mawu, Dan), or other forms of religious expression. For example, little is known of terracotta figurines paraded by the Huedan kings' wives as part of the processions Ô Springer</page><page sequence="22">208 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 1 8 Fig. 17 Archaeologically recovered statue to the temple of the python (Labat 1730: 62). Based on its depositional context and form, it is likely, however, that Huedans used the figurines described earlier as well as the archaeologically recovered ones in a manner similar to "empowered cadavers" of bo and bocio. These figurines were apparently part of Huedan religious expression, as Suzanne Blier argues that one of the most complete historically recorded sculptures of the bocio type is the Agoye or "God of Councils" recorded in the 17th-century town surrounding Savi. Blier writes that the Agoye statue of "black Earth, or clay" shares with bocio, "...not only markedly expressive features which are defined by the massing of diverse materials on the surface but also a concern with averting danger from the community and those living in it."17 Notably, there is an extensive body of literature in the nearby Yoruba area addressing the ceramic figurines recovered in burial and other ritualistically charged spaces. However, there remains a debate over whether such ceramic figurines were recovered from primary or secondary contexts (Eyo 1970, 1974; Garlake 1977; Schmidt 1983: 67; Wille« 1961). In the Yoruba region, older artifacts are known to have been incorporated into newer shrines; for example, between ceremonies, figurines were placed in newly prepared pits within sacred forests for safe keeping (Frobenius 1980 [1913]: 89-94). From archaeological and ethno-historical investigations in Ghana, it is clear that ceramic figurines are recovered in primary ritual settings. In reviewing the archaeological finds of ceramic figurines and terracotta heads, Brian Vivian (1992) 17 Phillips (1732: 224) claims to have shot a "wooden" figure, presumably the Agoye, after waiting several hours for it to speak and give a pronouncement. Based on archaeological research at the house, compounds of Huedan elites where ceramic figures similar in depositional context and form to modern wooden bo or bochio figures, it appears Bay (2001: 52) has further cause to argue that elites in the Dahomey Gap zone used such figures in religious rites. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="23">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 1 8 209 explores five sites in Ghana containing figurines and pots that were poorly fired along with pots decorated in relief with human figures, swords, spears, brass/bronze bracelets, and crocodiles. Vivian records that some of the ritual contexts, recovered from 17th- and 18th-century deposits, contained terracotta heads along with pots and pot stands. Roy Sieber (1972) describes terracotta heads recovered at Kwahu in Ghana and notes that such heads, along with pots and other offering, were placed directly on graves. Another line of evidence supporting the close connection between ceramic figurines and burials comes from Bosman (1705: 223) who notes that along the 18th- century Gold Coast: "At Axim and other places, they place several earthen images on the graves, which are wash[e]d 1 year after the funeral when they renew funeral ceremonies in as expensive a manner as at the interment..." Excavations in the Savi countryside at Locus 4, Unit 9 revealed a collapsed room in the same complex that contained the gozin, and near the structure containing the figurine. In this unit, excavators recovered case gin bottles and Hueda-era wine bottle fragments. From the Hueda-era deposits, this unit revealed several imported pipe fragments and two fragmentary human molars. The teeth were not deciduous and most likely related to a highly fragmentary skull or skulls around which the imported offerings were arranged. Unit 4 sampled another room in the same complex and revealed a dense concentration of Hueda-era local ceramics as well as imported pipe fragments and a metal object similar in form to an asen, an umbrella- like metal object (Fig. 18) used from at least the 19th century to the present to commemorate ancestral figures (Bay 2008). Excavated levels approximately 50 cm below the metal object revealed a living surface, and subsequent excavations revealed a subfloor pit feature containing a collection of ceramic jars. The finding of a prepared pit below a- collection of ritual items fits with descriptions of shrine construction in the early (Herskovits and Herskovits 1933: 36-38) and late 20th century (Cudjoe 1971: 190-191; Norman 2000; Savary 1970: 43). Commonly, ritual specialists construct shrines by preparing pits in or around house compounds. In modern times, a mixture of consecrated water, hard alcohol, leaves, and herbs are placed inside small golizin vessels which are in turn covered by a larger cooking vessel. Depending on the ancestor being commemorated or deity venerated, myriad permutations of other objects (e.g., animal skulls, small metal representations of tools, sea water, and beads) can be included in the pit, but almost without exception, some form of locally produced ceramic is part of the ritual mix. Only after the pit is filled and tamped down, or prepared into a low mound, is the visible, outer collection of objects put into place. While the religious spaces described earlier were - during the Hueda era - above-ground and visible, the offering locales described in the following section were more private, hidden from Fig. 18 Archaeologically recovered metal object £) Springer</page><page sequence="24">210 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26:187-218 prying eyes, and arguably related to more personal acts of supplication and protection. Bracing the House In modern times, Vodun ceremonies often take place in intense secrecy. Although Ouidah contains an impressive array of large temples, the latter often serve a largely symbolic function to their associated adepts and lay congregations (cf. Sinou 1994: 292). Similarly around the house compound, larger family shrines are often the locale for annual ceremonies to negotiate births, deaths, and other special events. Yet it is the smaller points of worship where daily cosmological dialogs take place (Bay 2008: 14-41, passim). Given archaeological findings from the Savi countryside assemblage, it is probable that Huedans living in the 17th- and 18th-century communities surrounding Savi created and used a range of both public and private religious spaces as well. At one outlying settlement center (Locus 2) near the freestanding shrine containing human skulls described earlier, excavators encountered an exterior wall of a wing of the house compound in Unit 5, at 84 cm below the opening level. After excavating through several levels of compact and culturally sterile clay-wall fill, excavators recovered a small low-fired golizen earthenware jar at a depth of 237 cm. The jar was placed on a prepared clay surface, and the wall was constructed on top of this offering (Fig. 19). The context is similar to offerings in modem Vodun practices where low-fired vessels are placed within the wall matrix or under the wall of structures as construction is underway (Norman 2000: 109-119; Kelly and Norman 2004). Noting a similar phenomenon in the Abomey region, Paul Hazoumé (1956: 24) recorded that the Dahomean court official, or Agbadjigbeto, was charged with creating offerings in foundations and holes in and around the palace to keep enemies at bay and prevent symbolic and direct attacks on the palace's inhabitants. From his excavations at I fé, Leo Frobenius (1980 [1913]: 295) illustrates formally similar vessels to golizen described earlier. In a similar fashion from later Fig. 19 Locus 2 unit 5 £* JpKilglftf</page><page sequence="25">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 18 211 excavations at Ifé, William Fagg and Frank Willett (1960: 26-28) interpreted a series of small low-fired earthenware vessels as offering vessels for palm wine. They base these interpretations on ethnographic analogy from formally similar ritual vessels created in the region in the 1950s when they conducted their fieldwork. It is remarkable that while investigating small golizen-like vessels in Ghana, David Calvocoressi (1975: 163) notes that local information was "not helpful" because his informants recounted that these small expediently constructed vessels must have been "made by dwarfs." In the Hueda area today, golizen vessels are used to venerate deities associated with "dwarves" or tohosu, so an interpretation that these vessels are closely associated with, or perhaps created by, little people might have more interpretive traction than Calvocoressi suggests. In the 17th-century Gold Coast region, locally produced earthenware ceramics were used to hold salves and anointing smears (De Marees et al. 1987: 68, 102) they were also used to contain offerings at crossroads (De Marees et al. 1987: 71) and as emulsion pots at the king's court (De Marees et al. 1987: 77, fn. 2). In the Savi countryside, ritual ceramics in associated shrines were similarly used at various scales of the settlement system. At the settlement center (Locus 4) containing the ritual compound, Unit 8 sampled the interior of a room overlooking a nearby ditch. Excavations revealed grinding stone fragments, local pipe fragments, a knapped quartz cobble, and human molars recovered at 65 cm below the opening level of the unit. This archaeological context is consistent with offerings cached inside a pit or other prepared surface just below a living surface. At another secondary palace complex (Locus 7) some 3 km northwest of Savi, excavators sampled the interior of another collapsed structure with Unit 2. In this unit, European gunflint fragments, lead "dust" shot, colorless faceted trade beads, and numerous local and imported pipe fragments were recovered, all near an almost complete large jar at 100 cm below the opening level of the unit. This jar and related offerings were recorded beneath the main living surface in a prepared pit. When the solidified contents of the jar were subjected to flotation, it revealed shallow bowl fragments (the same form as that containing the cranium at Locus 2) along with 11 large cranium fragments (8 g), eight molars, and four premolar and incisor fragments (Fig. 20). 18 This jar apparently represents a burial similar to ones reported by Jean Barbot witnessed in late 17th century (Hair et al. 1992: 640), where Huedans "... bury their dead with many signs of mourning, but after the funeral they keep open house for 5 or 6 weeks. The dead are usually interred in the hut where they died, because they have no cemeteries." Barbot noted that the residential graves were marked with a large pot of water alongside offerings prepared from a black bird. In modern times, the honor of being interred within or around one's house, normally under one's sleeping chamber, is reserved for illustrious family members, usually patriarchal or matriarchal figures. These cemetery rooms serve as points where deified members of the family are installed, taking up permanent residence in the structure. The set of rooms where members of the family line are buried often surround courtyards where family- wide ceremonies are held. Alain Sinou (1994: 18 See Ogundiran's (2002b: 46-47) description of a 13th-century burial at Iloyi of a decapitated skeleton, with a grinding stone, quartz stones, jar, and bowl fragment, possible food offerings, the skull of a sheep/ goat and a land-snail shell. ô Springer</page><page sequence="26">212 Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 1 8 Fig. 20 Regional polities, ca. 1700 after Law 1991:232 294) notes that families in Ouidah, "...pool their resources to maintain the sacred sites, that is, the worship rooms and cemetery rooms, and generally take little interest in the dwelling areas" which are often left unoccupied. Often the dead "occupants" of these house compounds outnumber the living and the structures may appear abandoned, except for the few times during the year when family members converge at the house to perform ceremonies reaffirming the family line. Apparently and not surprisingly, the dead during the Hueda era occupied prominent and proximate, though at times out of sight, positions in both the spaces where ceremonies took place and the social fields which made these ceremonies possible. Given the role public and private shrines played in tethering Huedans to their ancestral past, celebrating economic gains and regional prominence, shaping the future, and mitigating the conflict and political intrigue ever-present in early 18th-century Hueda, the violent dislocation of Huedans in 1727 should be viewed not only as a political and geographical diaspora, but also their removal from the places where cosmological actors were rooted to the landscape. Conclusions Archaeology is by nature of its methods an incomplete endeavor as is any written attempt to portray a religious tradition as decentralized, multifaceted, geographically dispersed, and historically shifting as Vodun. In marrying these two enterprises, this paper has undoubtedly resulted in tenuous connections between the present and the past and generalizations that invite countervailing interpretations. Nonetheless, through this initial effort, we have archaeological evidence that presents continuities with modern Vodun practices as well as further dimension to the brief accounts of early European chroniclers of the Hueda region. Some reoccurring artifactual, and more importantly, contextual themes can be outlined from a synthesis of archaeological, documentary, and oral sources. Seventeenth- and 18th-century Hueda-era house compounds contained several levels, or stages, of sacred spaces. Huedans constructed the first and largest freestanding shrines between the interior house compound and exterior barrier structures such as ditches. With modern and ethnohistorically observed practices as a Ô Springer</page><page sequence="27">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 18 213 guide, it is probable that residents of house compounds placed offerings at shrines to charge barriers cosmologically, protecting the socialized space within the house compound from the more liminal space found outside. Both the shrines found within the house compound and those located near the ditches were within the flurry of daily life as it unfolded in the interior of the compound. Within the Hueda social world, these shrines worked to connect the respective families with their past, secure stability in the present, and shape negotiation with cosmological actors over the nature of the future. Such cosmological dialogs also took place within the interior structures where small offerings placed inside walls provided protection against physical or cosmological threats. Enclosed room spaces within the house compound served as locales for subfloor interments, most likely the living abode of ancestral figures, as ancestors in the region are rarely described as being at rest. If so, Huedan houses were built quite literally on the ancestors who played an active role in the lives of those living above-ground. In terms of material culture, these sacred spaces attracted regional finery: locally produced smoking pipes, ceramic vessels, oil palm nuts, various stones, and offerings of meat and vegetables. Shrines also pooled items from throughout the Atlantic world: imported smoking pipes, trade beads, wine bottles, and collections of nails. The few cowries recovered in and around these sacred spaces speak to many more that did not survive the acidic soils that predominate in the project area (cf. Ogundiran 2002a). Moreover, the recovered cowries raise the possibility that other fragile items (e.g., cloth, metal, and fauna) were once included in this sacred mixed media and are now archaeologically unrecoverable. The total artifact assemblage from excavations (i.e., 50 units sampling seven sites, for a total of 123 m or 268 m of material excavated) contains striking regularity in the spatial arrangement of imported artifacts. Excavators recorded 14 of the 24 recovered imported nails/spikes from units also containing ritual ceramics. In modern times, such collections of metal fasteners often indicate an offering to the deity Gu. Likewise, excavators recovered a fragmentary English or Dutch "Onion" wine bottle (c. 1680-1715, Noël Hume 1970: 60-71) from a unit also containing ritual vessel fragments. Similarly, 16 of the 34 archaeologically recovered trade beads were unearthed from archaeological contexts also containing ritual ceramics. The concentration of costly trade items near religious spaces in the Savi countryside suggests that Huedans who profited directly or indirectly from trans-Atlantic trade in war captives, lavished a portion of these gains on vodun and ancestral members, who for this period were described as keeping the flows of Atlantic affluence possible by sanctioning, monitoring, and encouraging exchanges (Law 1991: 109- 10). Despite these connections and continuities, much work remains both to chart the trajectory of vodun entering and presumably exiting the Huedan pantheon, as well as exploring the active social role that material culture and architectural features played in the history of the polity (cf. Stahl 2008). One preliminary finding from the present project that might aid in the future exploration of this issue is the increased number of dedicated ritual ceramics available in the markets of Ouidah when compared with the relatively few types currently identified in the archaeological record (Norman 2000, 2008). Many of these modern vessels represent deities relatively new to southern Benin (e.g., Marni Wata and Dan). Quite probably, the apparent increase in &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="28">214 A fr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 1 8 the ceramic representations of the newer entrants into the Huedan pantheon relates in a direct fashion to the ever-growing accumulation of vodun in and around Ouidah. As Dana Rush (1999: 2) succinctly states: Vodun is a testament to the strength and flexibility of a belief system that perpetually adapts, invents, re-invents, and modifies itself. Within the religious system of Vodun, there exist endless sources which ultimately form, re-form, and transform Vodun arts and religious consciousness. As long as Vodun is on the move, its transformation is forever unfinished. Apparently, the vodun welcomed into this accumulative and emergent structure have been on the move since at least the mid- 17th century. The archaeological material interpreted as part of the Huedan ritual assemblage includes ceramic empowerment figurines; quatrefoil "x"-incised ritual ceramics; and collections of metal fasteners, trade beads, smoking pipes, and river cobbles. In this discussion, I have focused on Huedan Vodun and have drawn similarities between it and the ethno-linguistically, historically, and politically intertwined polities of Aliada and Dahomey. I firmly believe that fruitful parallels can be made between the material dimensions of 17th- and 18th-century religious life in the polities of the Gbe-speaking region of the Dahomey Gap zone. Moreover, there appear to be strong material similarities between ritual items used throughout the Bight of Benin. A greater understanding of the fluid currents linking regions of Atlantic Africa is a critical step before moving on to broader scales and doing the difficult work of confirming and calibrating the material signatures and social processes that characterize Huedan Vodun as it might have existed in the wider-diasporic world. As demonstrated earlier, similar material repertoires and symbolic/decorative motifs are recorded in the archaeological and historical records of contemporary large-scale polities in the coastal and forest zone regions found in modern Benin, Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria. In terms of the archaeology of the African Diaspora, such a finding should give pause to researchers investigating sites in the Americas who would assign ethnic, cultural, or regional affiliation based solely on formal characteristics of artifacts. To paraphrase Leland Ferguson (1999) and build on his work, the cross is a magic sign on at least some vessels recovered from riverine settings in the Lowcountry of South Carolina, and a sign used to mark ritual spaces across a broad region of the West and Central Africa (cf. Eglash 1999). Accordingly, this paper ends with a plea for researchers in the Americas to explore deeply the dynamic human landscapes of Atlantic Africa (Ogundiran and Falola 2007). Specifically, there is a need for archaeologists of the African Diaspora to steep their interpretations of diasporic spaces with an understanding that both the practice of incorporating seemingly quotidian objects in sanctified spaces alongside the practice of freely borrowing encountered deities, practices, and ritual objects did not begin in the New World. Furthermore, as is hopefully clear from the earlier discussion, depositional context of artifacts trumps their formal and decorative characteristics as an indicator of religious significance. 19 Georgina Beier (1980) suggests that in Nigeria, certain types of ritual pottery have died out including ritual pots, and relief sculpture made for the shrines of orisa, in particular for Sango and Erinle. Beier argues that this decline relates to the rise in popularity of modern mass-manufactured ceramics in a sinusoidal relationship with the declining popularity of locally produced ceramic ones. &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="29">Afr Archaeol Rev (2009) 26: 1 87-2 18 215 With notable recently published exceptions (e.g., Ferguson 1992; Leone et al. 2003; Samford 2007), however, context has received little attention when compared with the ever-growing body of research on decorative elements as they relate to regions of Africa. In terms of materiality, perhaps it is exactly this flexible, fractal, regional, and accumulative dimension of the Huedan Vodun20 that researchers should consider when interpreting influences from Bight of Benin groups on the ceramics, cosmographie markings, and subfloor spaces found in diasporic contexts.
