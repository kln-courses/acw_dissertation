<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gender and International Security: Feminist Perspectives. Edited by Laura Sjoberg (Oxon: Routledge, 2009, ix-xiv + 286pp. £22.99 pb) This edited collection addresses the subordination of gender in both the theory and practice of international security. It seeks to highlight the value of a gendered analysis of international security and the importance of expanding the feminist research programme in this area. As Sjoberg explains in the introduction, 4 the omission of gender from work on international security does not make that work gender-neutral or unproblematic' (p. 5). It is an eclectic collection that broadens our understanding of 'what is meant by se- curity but also who merits security' (p. 4) . Each chapter approaches international secu- rity from a different feminist perspective. All, however, 'share a normative and empirical concern that the international system is gender-hierarchical' (p. 3) . According to Susan Wright, feminist approaches to international relations (IR) ask the following 'epistemo- logica! question: From whose perspective is IR knowledge constructed?' (p. 194). The answer we are given, across the various essays in this collection, is that IR is a man's world and, as such, it has been constructed from a male perspective. Each chapter follows a similar format: each critiques and reconstructs mainstream discourses of international security through a gendered lens by acknowledging the multiple and complex roles women occupy within the security arena, both as combatants and as peace builders in various contexts. The essays in this collection demonstrate that gender is crucial for understanding international security and the reader is left in no doubt that gender matters in complex and diverse ways. Essays range from exploring the 'links between war, security and what people, see, feel, hear, smell and even taste when they are confronted with violence in International Rela- tions' (p. 24); to questions relating to the anthropomorphism of the state and perform- ances of hegemonic masculinity within the field of security; to criticisms of state-centric approaches to international security; and empirical studies on women's involvement in conflicts in Northern Ireland and Sierra Leone. Additional chapters cover topics as var- ied as power transition theory, environmental security, women, militancy and security in South Asia, feminist theories of arms control and peace building in Rwanda and Côte d'Ivoire. Out of the 13 chapters, certain essays stand out - it is these that I will refer to in this review - while others leave less of an impression. It is this diversity that speaks to both the book's strength and its weakness. Readers may benefit from the breadth and depth of the topics covered (thereby gaining an insight into the scale of the problem); however, 1195</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS this does mean skipping from one issue to the next. This may leave readers feeling slightly disoriented and wanting to know more about a particular area. I would suggest treating this collection as a starting point for further exploration into this field. That said, there are certain themes that stand out across all of the contributions. These include: the dicho tomous structuring of gendered norms and how they are main- tained and reproduced in security studies; gendered discourses of protection and secu- rity; the marginalization of women from such discourses; and, finally, hegemonic masculinity. Picking up from Jonathan Wadley's discussion of the states' performance of hege- monic masculinity, Jennifer Maruška provides an interesting discussion of the transfor- mation of American hegemonic masculinity into hypermasculinity following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. We are told by Sjoberg in the introduction that state hypermasculinity is a relatively new area of theorization in IR. This has echoes, however, of Sparks's article, 'Masculinity and Heroism in the Hollywood Blockbuster Movie', which considers hypermasculinity and the action movie of the 1980s. During this time, we witnessed 'a . . . more dramatic per-formative re-enactment of what went before', when '[m]asculinity becomes hyper-masculinity' (Sparks 1996: 356) . This response to the crisis of masculinity was depicted on the muscular bodies and the violent actions of the 'action hero'. Maruska's analysis explores America's re- sponse to a security crisis. For me, this chapter reminds us that power relations operate not only at the individual level, but also 'at the family, association, state and interstate levels' (p. 237). The contributors of this collection argue convincingly that gender is indispensible for the study of international security on four levels: ethically, conceptually, empirically and operationally. In the first chapter, Judith Stiehm explores people's 'ethical respon- sibility to know and engage with militaries and militarism from a feminist perspective' (p. 6). This theme is then picked up by Jennifer Lobasz in her chapter on human trafficking in which she argues that human trafficking represents a violation of victims' human rights and that, ethically, states are obliged to prevent human rights abuses. Chapters Seven and Eight by Sandra McEvoy and Megan MacKenzie, respectively, are empirical studies of women's involvement in Loyalist paramilitary organizations in Northern Ireland and their participation in the disarmament, demobilization and re- integration process in Sierra Leone. These chapters complement one another. Both provide a 'deeper more thoughtful look at the threat that women combatants pose to security' (p. 129) and both ask 'where are the women in peace negotiations?'. Con- ceptually, these chapters challenge 'stereotypes of women and girls as exclusively pas- sive victims of . . . conflict' (p. 154) . More broadly, they highlight 'socially constructed ideas about the roles and place of women and men during war' (p. 154). Indeed, within discourses of international security, there is a gendered assumption that 'female soldiers are not a security concern in the same way that male soldiers are' (p. 152). I found this particularly interesting, since this reading of female soldiers runs counter to the prevailing risk assessment and criminalization of female offenders by the criminal justice system. Finally, Lobasz addresses the impact that gender stereotypes have on an operational level. Her essay demonstrates how socially constructed ideas about women's involvement in the sex industry informs policies of international security. 1196</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS The obvious thing to do is to recommend this book to students and scholars of critical security studies, gender studies and international relations. Indeed, this is precisely what the publishers have done. However, I think this might be slightly short-sighted. I suggest adding criminology students to the list of potential readers. I believe that the subject of international security would benefit from an exchange of ideas between and across a variety of disciplines. Increasingly, criminologists are turning their attention to the study of war and conflict. Ruggiero (2005), for example, discusses the criminalization of war and the peace-making capabilities of criminology. Incorporating the issues raised in this collec- tion regarding gender 'could make peace building processes more representative and more effective' (p. 274) . In addition, attempts to understand how and why states declare war on one another (see Steinert 2003) may benefit from a gendered understanding of this process. The chapter by Lauren Wilcox, which analyses the offence-defence theory through a gendered lens, would be of particular relevance for criminologists wanting to better understand the dominance of state offensive strategies. This is a solid collection and I enjoyed reading it. There are two minor critical points I would like to make. First, I felt that readers would have benefitted from prior knowledge of IR or security studies in order to place the book in some sort of context. This would help readers to fully appreciate and understand the aims and objectives of the book and the assortment of topics covered. Second, given the progress made within criminology of challenging sexist constructions of female offenders, and the qualitative material that has been produced on female sex workers, pernicious stereotypes of female fighters and sex workers within IR discourses are slightly discouraging. Overall, however, this is a valu- able collection of essays on gender and international security. For me, Chapters Seven and Eight were by far the most interesting and engaging. Drawing upon women's per- sonal narratives seemed to address the heart of the problem: the 'systematic and histor- ical omission of women' (p. 151) from security studies. What is clear is that in an era of globalization, terrorism, international and domestic security threats, this book creates opportunities for new and timely conversations be- tween a variety of scholars from an array of disciplines on the subject of gender and international security.
