<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Course Design UWP 011: Popular Science &amp; Technology  Writing Sarah Perrault Course Description UWP 011: Popular Science &amp; Technology Writing is a sophomore-level  course designed as an introduction to rhetoric of science at UC Davis, a  science-focused land-grant university. The course fulfills the general educa- tion requirements for written literacy and for topical breadth in arts and  humanities. The catalog describes the course as investigating the “position- ing of science and technology in society as reflected and constructed in  popular texts” (University of California, Davis, General 521). A main goal  of the course is to foster students’ critical scientific literacy and ability to  read texts rhetorically. Institutional Context UWP 011 was created in the context of needs that, while especially strong  at UC Davis, generalize to writing programs across the country. First, the  course is intended to help define the University Writing Program’s disci- plinary identity, a perennial issue faced by Writing Studies programs of all  kinds.1 Second, the course addresses UC Davis’s need for increased scien- tific literacy (SL) among graduates. The University Writing Program (UWP) at UC Davis is an independent  academic unit within the Division of Humanities, Arts, and Cultural Stud- ies (HArCS). UWP separated from the English department in 2003, and  since then our mission has shifted from an exclusive teaching focus to a  shared teaching and research focus. This shift has taken two forms. First,  the composition of the faculty has broadened. Prior to independence, all the  UWP faculty were lecturers, mostly full time, with teaching appointments,  whereas today the faculty also includes five professors (three full and two  assistant) who have combined teaching/research appointments. In addi- tion, we also have gone from having no minor, major, or graduate degree  to having an undergraduate minor and a graduate Designated Emphasis in  Writing, Rhetoric, and Composition Studies. We are working toward having  a major and a Ph.D. Despite these changes, we are still mainly focused on composition with  the required lower and upper division writing courses making up over 90%  of the program’s offerings. As this figure suggests, we are in the early stages  of defining what kind of department we will be and what kinds of degree  programs we will develop. In creating courses, therefore, we are not only  Composition Studies 40.2 (2012): 112–133 </page> <page sequence="2"> expanding our curriculum, but making early steps toward deciding and sig- naling to others what our disciplinary identity or identities will be. We are  especially working to complement our existing composition focus by adding  courses on theory, history, and research methods, and UWP 011 is our first  rhetorical theory course at the undergraduate level. As we add courses, we also are thinking and talking about the future  stability of the program. Our success so far as an autonomous unit springs, to  a great deal, from our program’s Writing the Disciplines (WID) and Writing  in the Professions (WIP) focus and the visibility this gives us across campus,  and we know that to continue growing while maintaining the support these  courses bring us, we need to heed Richard Young and Edwin Steinberg’s  advice that an academic program is most stable when it is “responsive to  durable needs of society” (395). As Young and Steinberg point out,  in the case of rhetorical studies, the durable social needs are obvious.  Rhetoric has long sought to address the need for literacy and the need to  participate reasonably and effectively in the social conversation; that is,  rhetoric has always been concerned with the use of language in communi- ty-sustaining action. (395) I would amend this only to say that Rhetoric today concerns itself not with  literacy, but with literacies; indeed, our emphasis on WID/WIP reflects the  diversity of discourse communities students are expected to visit or to in- habit professionally. These courses meet university and social needs by  teaching disciplinary and professional rhetorics, and in doing so they also  provide the UWP with a stable institutional mission and standing. How- ever, as much as students need literacy in particular discourses, they need  broader literacies as well, including one that UWP 011 is designed to ad- dress: critical scientific literacy.  UC Davis was founded as the University Farm School (an extension of UC  Berkeley) in 1908 and has focused on sciences, especially applied sciences  such as plant biology and agricultural engineering, from its earliest years.  In 1959, it became a “general campus,” separate from UC Berkeley, with  the understanding that it would maintain a focus on teaching and research  in agriculture. In this context, it makes sense that concern for scientific lit- eracy (or SL) is stated clearly in the UC Davis “Revised General Education  Requirement” document: The objective is to create graduates who understand the fundamental  ways scientists approach problems and generate new knowledge, and who  understand how scientific findings relate to other disciplines and to public  policy. (University of California, Davis “Revised”) But SL is not just important to science students or future scientists. One of  the most common arguments for SL—that it enhances citizens’ decision- making abilities—applies to everyone, regardless of their career paths.  Thus, SL matters as much in a humanities-focused program or campus as  UWP 011: Popular Science &amp; Technology Writing   113 </page> <page sequence="3"> it does in an agricultural school like UC Davis. This is especially true of the  second aspect of SL, the understanding of “how scientific findings relate to  other disciplines and to public policy.”  The problem, at Davis and elsewhere, is that science classes teach stu- dents how to solve scientific problems and create scientific knowledge, but  many do not address the sciences’ relationships to other areas of study and  to society as a whole. Even when science classes do address this broader  scope, they necessarily do so from an internal perspective. However, to truly  understand these broader issues, students need to look at science from van- tage points outside of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math),  vantage points provided by Science and Technology Studies (STS) disciplines  such as sociology, history, philosophy, and rhetoric of science.  Even science educators agree that SL often is not, and cannot be, ad- dressed solely within STEM disciplines. Science Education professor Jonathan  Osborne writes in a 2010 issue of Science focused on SL that “[a]rgument  and debate are common in science, yet they are virtually absent from science  education” (463), and that Typically, in the rush to present the major features of the scientific land- scape, most of the arguments required to achieve such knowledge are  excised. Consequently, science can appear to its students as a monolith of  facts, an authoritative discourse where the discursive exploration of ideas,  their implications, and their importance is absent. Students then emerge  with naïve ideas or misconceptions about the nature of science itself...  (464) Although it is understandable that many science courses emphasize con- tent over critique—it is, after all, the point of “the programmatic goals of  disciplinary classes—to become familiar with the content and issues that  are salient in a given field” (Greene &amp; Orr 149)—critical depth is exactly  what is needed if students are truly to become scientifically literate—that  is, if they are to attain a critical, not just an instrumental, scientific literacy. At this point it is important to distinguish between different aspects of  SL. The first, Instrumental SL, is a knowledge-centered approach character- ized by most undergraduate science classes. As Bryan Brown, John Reveles,  and Gregory Kelly explain, knowledge-centered perspectives on SL “value  students’ developing scientific knowledge, practices, habits of mind, and  ways of using knowledge as citizens or individuals acquiring literacy for  some extrinsic purposes” (780). Instrumental SL includes the kind of learning  described in the first half of the UC Davis General Education requirements:  how to “approach problems, pose questions, gather data, make conclusions,  and then generate new hypotheses for testing” (General 3).  Instrumental SL, which is “confined to a surface-level recognition of  scientific vocabulary and principles” (Zerbe 91), is good as a starting point.  However, Zerbe points out that much science education stops here: “By and  large, the contemporary curricular structure of science education leaves  114   Composition Studies </page> <page sequence="4"> little room for studying science as more than learning its experimental and  observational methods” (91). Returning to Brown, Reveles, and Kelly, in  such an outlook “scientific literacy remains abstracted from experience and  ultimately disconnected from the lives of people engaged in their world”  (780). To go beyond Instrumental SL,2 it is necessary to situate science in  its broader epistemic and social contexts by engaging in critical scientific  literacy (CSL). This second approach, CSL, is rooted in a sociocultural-centered perspec- tive that “seeks to situate any definition of scientific literacy in the actions  of accomplishing everyday life” and in so doing, “considers how literacy is  relevant to particular tasks at hand in some relevant social context” (Brown,  Reveles, and Kelly 780). They continue: The task of using knowledge to accomplish a particular undertaking re- quires consideration of the modes of interaction and sociohistorical con- texts brought into play in the construction of the literacy event. (780) Although it is possible to go into more depth about variations within so- ciocultural-centered SL, such fine-grained taxonomy is less important here  than the general concept of distinguishing instrumental from critical SL.  Therefore, for the purposes of this article, I lump together the various as- pects of the sociocultural-centered perspective—critical, epistemic, and  ideological SL (see Zerbe 93-96)—under the heading Critical Scientific  Literacy, or CSL. What these different aspects of CSL have in common is  attention to knowledge-making processes in science, to the construction of  scientific authority, and to the interplay of science and society.  Explaining why CSL matters does not explain why I think Writing Stud- ies is well positioned to foster CSL. Here I offer two reasons, one general  and one specific. First, on a general level, much of what is touted as CSL  is actually critical thinking, an area where Writing Studies curricula have  long excelled. In 2010 Science article, P. David Pearson, Elizabeth Moje, and  Cynthia Greenleaf acknowledge the overlap when they write that “Science  and literacy use many of the same reasoning processes: setting purposes,  asking questions, clarifying ambiguities, drawing inferences from incomplete  evidence, and making evidence-based arguments” (460). Similarly, Osborne  suggests that students need not only “explicit teaching of how to reason” but  also “a knowledge of the meta-linguistic features of argumentation (claims,  reasons, evidence, and counterargument) to identify the essential elements  of their own and others’ arguments” (466)—curricular needs that clearly  fall within the domain of Writing Studies. Second, more specifically, Writing Studies is uniquely suited to foster  CSL because of its interest in critical literacies. The National Science Educa- tion Standards (NSES) state that scientific literacy “includes understanding  the nature of science, the scientific enterprise, and the role of science in  society and personal life” (Center for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering  Education 21). A rhetorical approach can help reveal the discursive nature  UWP 011: Popular Science &amp; Technology Writing   115 </page> <page sequence="5"> of science and the role that texts play in mediating knowledge in and about  science. In addition, as Zerbe notes, Rhetoric has a tradition of question- ing dominant discourses and “a constant dedication to keep a close eye on  powerful discourses” (2). He adds that in the early centuries of Rhetoric, the  powerful discourse was the law. Later, religious discourse came to dominate,  and rhetoricians focused their attention on the church. Today, science is one  of the most powerful discourses—if not the most powerful discourse—in the  world, and as such merits our scholarly and pedagogical attention. Theoretical Rationale I designed the curriculum with three main goals. The first goal was for stu- dents to see science as a sociocultural phenomenon,  to see how it shapes  and is shaped by the larger culture of which it is a part. The second goal,  specific to rhetoric of science, was for students to recognize the discur- sive nature of science-related texts, and to be able to identify and critique  the rhetorical moves in those texts in terms of how those moves construct  popular understandings of science. The third goal, not specific to CSL, was  for students to engage in scholarly practices: engaging in intellectual in- quiry, seeking out and questioning evidence, understanding and question- ing their own and others’ perspectives, and articulating their findings and  positions in clear and coherent prose. In approaching the first goal, to help students see science as a socio- cultural phenomenon, I was aware that a truly critical scientific literacy is  interdisciplinary, characterized by knowledge and understandings not from  the sciences but also from sociology, history, and philosophy of science (to  name the most established science studies disciplines). Given the science- and-technology-oriented nature of the UC Davis student body, I could as- sume that most students had already begun acquiring instrumental scientific  literacy. However, because UWP 011 is a lower division elective I could not  assume students had any previous exposure to science studies. Therefore, I  needed to provide some Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspectives,  which I did during the first two weeks. To place our guiding questions in a  historical context, I spent half of each class session explaining the history  of science writing and of science popularization. I also introduced the two  models of science popularization we would be using all term, models based  on STS scholarship in Rhetoric, Communication, and sociology.  The first model goes by various labels, including the “deficit” model, the  “Public Understanding of Science and Technology” (PUST) model, or in my  own coining, the “Public Appreciation of Science and Technology” (PAST)  model.3 In this model, science communication is characterized as a one-way  flow of reliable information from the scientific sphere to the public, with  that public viewed as a “blank slate of ignorance on which scientists write  knowledge” (Myers 266). The model is characterized by an uncomplicated  view of science that promotes a “positivist view of the inexorably rational and  progressive nature of scientific knowledge” (Taylor 115). It is also based on  116   Composition Studies </page> <page sequence="6"> “a pervasive but outdated and overly simplistic model of communication as a  simple linear process” (Hansen 107) in which scientists produce knowledge,  the knowledge is packaged in language, and the packages are opened by the  public and the knowledge in them absorbed in its original form.  One especially problematic aspect of the PAST model is the way it fails  to distinguish between hot and cold science. Cold science (a.k.a. “textbook”  science) is certain. It’s the knowledge that has stood the test of replication  and peer review and time. Hot science (a.k.a. “frontier” science) is much less  certain; it is science in the making. This distinction was important in UWP  011 for two reasons. First, it helped students see the difference between  what happens in classrooms and what happens in reality. Science classes,  especially foundational undergraduate classes, teach cold science. Reduc- ing science literacy to this level tends to promote “a damaging illusion that  real science is somehow like school science” and so risks “communicating  naively inductivist and empiricist misunderstanding of how science creates  knowledge” (Turner 63). Second, it circumvented a miniature replay of the  science wars by acknowledging all the ways that science has contributed  solid understandings of the world while also admitting that not all science  is equally reliable. In other words, it gave us a way to talk about science as  both certain and uncertain, a key element of the second model of SL.  The second model, dubbed the “Critical Understanding of Science in  Public” (CUSP) model by Peter Broks, focuses on both of the “twin duties” of  science communication: “to inform and educate the public about science on  the one hand, but also to probe and criticize it on the other” (Russell xiii).  In contrast with the deficit-minded PAST model, the CUSP model evaluates  popular science texts in terms of how well they bring to discussions of sci- ence a much-needed set of “citizen views, which bring in notions of equity  and access, ethics, control and sustainability” (Einsiedel 181). Given the  importance of understanding hot science, a primary aim in UWP 011 was to  help students see science and its institutions in context, and to begin think- ing about how many aspects of science are socially constructed. Becoming  aware of the constructedness of knowledge “changes the geography of all  previous categories; it denatures them as heat denatures a fragile protein”  (Haraway 157). This denaturing, or denaturalizing of what seems natural  and inevitable, opens up texts to critical questions about demarcation (e.g.,  What is science? What distinguishes science from other knowledge-making  endeavors?) and about science in society (e.g., What is the role of science in  society, and the role of society in relation to science?). Asking such questions  helps to break down a monolithic view of science and allows students to  build more complex understandings of science as a set of practices, institu- tions, and relationships. In other words, the CUSP model of SL eschews the  reductive distortions of the PAST model and offers a more useful framework  for critical engagement. The two models of scientific literacy informed how I approached the  second goal—for students to be able to identify and critique the rhetorical  UWP 011: Popular Science &amp; Technology Writing   117 </page> <page sequence="7"> moves in texts about science—in terms of my text choices and the rhetorical  lenses we used to analyze those texts. The main course text was The Best American Science and Nature Writ- ing 2010 (BASNW 2010), a collection of 27 essays and articles edited by  renowned physicist Freeman Dyson. A few supplemental articles from other  sources were provided via the course SmartSite. I focused the course on  popular science texts because these texts serve as “important components  of the perception and practice of the contemporary cultural institution of  science” (Zerbe 105) and therefore offer relatively easy insights into that cul- tural institution. Also, in contrast with primary scientific literature, popular  science texts often show scientific issues in their social contexts while also  being more accessible than scientific journal articles. As Zerbe argues, “in  many ways, efforts to achieve a culturally informed, meaningful scientific  literacy can be recognized and realized more quickly in popularizations than  in original research” (106). Popular science texts allow students to engage  with texts at the rhetorical level more readily than they would if they were  struggling to learn the background science first.4  To teach a CSL-specific approach to rhetorical analysis, I introduced  five analytic lenses5 that are useful for identifying where popular science  texts fall on the PAST/CUSP continuum. These lenses, in the order used in  class, were demarcation, expertise, modes and stases, ethos and persona,  and certainty/uncertainty and risk.  • The demarcation lens looked at how texts create a relationship be- tween science and society. Using this lens, we looked at whether  a given text supported the dominant view of science as something  apart, or a critical view that situates science in its sociocultural con- text. • The modes and stases lens illuminated how texts create subject po- sitions, that is, the relationship between readers and science. This  lens looks at what kind of stance readers are invited to take toward  science.  • The expertise lens built on the modes and stases lens by showing  how texts create a narrow or broad scope of participation in science- related decision-making. • The ethos lens looked at how the relationship between the writer  and science, that is, how a text creates the writer’s technical cred- ibility on science topics. Balancing this is the “persona” lens, which  looks at how the writer creates a relationship with the reader.  • The certainty/uncertainty and risk lens revealed a writer’s use of  hedging, identified when hot science is being presented as more cer- tain than it is, and helped students judge socioscientific issues such  as the costs and benefits arising from particular courses of actions. 118   Composition Studies </page> <page sequence="8"> Explaining all five lenses would take more space than I have here, so I will  focus on expertise as an example.  A PAST depiction reduces expertise to a binary in which scientists have  it and non-scientists don’t. In contrast, a CUSP depiction represents exper- tise as coming in different forms, with formal scientific training being one  among several legitimate ways to learn about the world. Drawing on work  by H. M. Collins and Robert Evans in sociology of science and Beverly Sauer  in technical communication, I presented six categories of expertise. The first  four come from Collins and Evans: • Contributory expertise: The ability to do something well, or add to a  body of knowledge. Researchers have contributory expertise within  their research areas. • Interactional expertise: The ability to use the language of a domain,  but without “practical competence” (Collins and Evans 14). For ex- ample, a software project manager might not know how to program,  but will know how to talk about programming well enough to com- municate with programmers. • Meta-expertise: The ability to judge others’ expertise without having  it oneself. An NSF grant committee includes members who do not  have knowledge in the specific area of any given grant proposal but  can still evaluate the quality of the proposal.  • Referred expertise: The “use of an expertise learned in one domain  within another domain” (15). A student who learns good study hab- its in one discipline can apply those habits to another discipline after  changing majors. From Sauer, who argues for a greater understanding of “the interdepen- dence of scientific knowledge and local experience, and the rhetorical pres- ence of tacit knowledge” (20), I drew two additional concepts: • Local expertise: The knowledge of “interested citizens” (79). Many  California students have developed local expertise regarding the  state budget and education funding. • Experiential expertise: “Tacit or craft knowledge” (79). Many labora- tory skills—for example, pipetting, preparing slides, and adjusting  microscopes—require hands-on experience that cannot be provided  via lectures or textbooks. In deciding how to identify a text’s representation of expertise, we asked  questions such as: Who gets quoted? Are different kinds of experts quoted  and critiqued in the same way? For example, whose contribution is giv- en a positive label? A negative label? Whose assertions are weighted for  their soundness, and whose are accepted as given? Authority comes in part  through use of a specialized vocabulary. Who has one? Only scientists?  UWP 011: Popular Science &amp; Technology Writing   119 </page> <page sequence="9"> Others as well? Whose vocabulary is quoted? We asked these questions  in class about Trevor Corson’s “Stalking the American Lobster,” a text that  contains several kinds of expertise, then students applied them in their re- sponses to a similarly broad-minded article, Burkhard Bilger’s “Hearth Sur- gery.” Asking such questions helps support SCL by looking at how “writing  works in the world and how the ‘tool’ of writing is used to mediate various  activities” (Downs and Wardle 558) and thereby encouraging readers to  consider not only what a text says about its topic, but also how it construes  scientific authority, and what kind of relationship between science and so- ciety it presents as normal. Students responded to texts using the different lenses in classroom  discussions and in their written assignments, the latter also supporting the  third course goal: for students to engage in scholarly research and writing.  Students wrote six responses and a research paper. The response assignments  included three parts: a summary, a response, and an analysis. The 200-300 word objective summary of the popular science text  encouraged students to read for the writer’s point of view, and it allowed  them to practice summarizing, a foundational skill on which more critical  skills are built.6  The 200-300 word response asked for their subjective reaction to any as- pect of the text. Education experts suggest that good teaching helps students  “see connections between what they are learning and their personal goals”  (Glynn, Aultman, and Owens 164) or interests, and this part of the assign- ment was intended to help students make those connections. Additionally,  the responses helped foster the critical aspects of scientific literacy. Given  that science classes often train students to passively accept information, it  was important to create a space in which they could break the sometimes- tacit rules of academia by saying whatever they wanted to about a text or an  idea. I wanted to break them out of a passive reception mode and encourage  opinions, no matter how subjective.  The 200-300 word rhetorical analysis gave students a chance to use that  week’s theoretical lens in practicing critical reading and analysis. Through  this part of the Summary/Response/Analysis (SRA), students “become much  more used to critical maneuvers with texts” (Downs and Wardle 572) such  as asking about the writer’s possible motives. For example, in the SRA using  the expertise lens, students not only identified what kinds of expertise were  represented in an article, but also speculated about why the writer might  have chosen to cite those particular experts and about what effect those  choices had on readers’ perceptions of the scientific enterprise described  in the article. The overall idea behind the SRAs was to give students repeated oppor- tunities to practice taking different stances toward texts, and to do so in a  relatively low-stakes manner. Therefore, the grading criteria were geared  toward clarity of expression, and I dropped the lowest of the six SRA grades. 120   Composition Studies </page> <page sequence="10"> The research paper included all three aspects of the SRA and added a  research component. Each student chose a text from BASNW 2010, used one  of the lenses to identify PAST elements in the text, and wrote about how the  author could have made that aspect of the text more CUSP. This involved  research, as the student had to find information the author had not included.  Beyond requiring that students consult a range of sources and discuss them  with me and with my TA, I wanted to leave open as many parameters as  possible because “[w]hen students have the opportunity to help design  their educational activities... they are more likely to benefit from them”  (Glynn, Aultman, and Owens 158). Allowing students to choose any text,  any aspect of that text, and any lens allowed them to pursue whichever of  their own intellectual interests were sparked by the texts they had read and  the concepts they had learned. The 27 pieces in Dyson’s collection offered  students a wide range of texts to choose from, while limiting their choices  to those pieces ensured that students’ workshop peers were familiar with  the piece that any one student wrote about. The assignment included four  stages—proposal, research report, draft, and final revision—with feedback  at the proposal and draft stages. I had two specific goals for this assignment. First, I wanted students to  see texts as rhetorical, as being the result of a series of decisions the writer  made. Looking at texts in terms of what the writer might have done differ- ently really brought home to them that writers leave things out. Articulating  those decisions in terms of the rhetorical concepts made students connect  those textual decisions to social dynamics beyond the text. Thus, they be- came more able “to recognize texts not as information but as the words of  real people” (Downs and Wardle 572). I also wanted the assignment to help students see science, in Zerbe’s  words, “as more than learning its experimental and observational methods”  (91). In the research paper, each student delved more deeply into a specific  aspect of science. Those who chose to look at texts in terms of demarcation  learned more about how texts create expectations about what the relation- ship between science and society is or should be. Those who chose to look  at texts in terms of modes/stases, or in terms of certainty/uncertainty and  risk, learned more about knowledge making in science. Those who chose  to focus on textual representations of expertise, or on ethos and persona,  learned more about constructions of scientific authority and of its relationship  to other forms of knowledge. No matter which lens they selected, students  had to find out more about the broader epistemic and social contexts for  the science in their chosen articles. Critical Reflection  Based on changes I saw in students’ work and in class discussions, I think  the class met its two main pedagogical goals—to increase students’ CSL  and their rhetorical understanding of texts—quite well. Although I don’t  have IRB approval (which I did not think of getting) and so cannot quote  UWP 011: Popular Science &amp; Technology Writing   121 </page> <page sequence="11"> directly from student writing or evaluations, I can talk about the kinds of  changes I saw.  The first major change was that students started asking critical ques- tions about the readings and about science such as: What is the author’s  background? Where was this article first published? How might that have  affected the writer’s focus? Where was the scientific study published? Has the  study been replicated? Has it been refuted? And what is the “n” on this study? These kinds of questions are essential for critical literacy in general, but  especially for scientific literacy. The NSES, whose definitions of SL I quoted  earlier, also defines SL in terms of “being able to read with understanding  articles about science in the popular press and to engage in social conversa- tion about the validity of the conclusions... [and] to evaluate the quality  of scientific information on the basis of its source and the methods used to  generate it” (Center for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Education  22). As a group, the class moved from a generally one-dimensional view of  scientific studies as either right or wrong, to a more nuanced understanding  of science as a process in which there are varying degrees of accuracy that  must be judged in context. The second change was that students grew comfortable using the lenses  as a heuristic and approaching texts analytically. For example, when reading  an expert’s comment on a topic they would ask questions like “Is the scientist  being quoted on a topic a contributory expert in that area? If not, does the  scientist have some other kind of relevant expertise (e.g., metaexpertise or  referred expertise) that makes the scientist credible on this topic?”  They also learned to read rhetorically, considering authors’ choices  and asking questions about a text’s composition. They also, in the words  of Downs and Wardle, “became much more likely to recognize texts not as  information but as the words of real people” (572). Their research papers  were especially revealing on this front as, in searching for answers to some  questions, they sometimes found answers to questions they hadn’t thought  to ask. In a few cases, those unexpected findings turned out to be more in- teresting to them than their original queries had been. One student, looking  for information on the research methods used in a study, was surprised to  learn that the research team included not just Americans, as the BASNW  2010 article had implied, but people from several other countries as well.  This discovery prompted an interesting discussion of nationalism (or pro- vincialism) in science popularization and a new look at other texts to see if  they did the same thing. As they grew more comfortable looking at science critically and at texts  rhetorically, students also increased the complexity of the views they adopted  and expressed during class discussions and in their writing. Specifically, their  textual analyses grew more nuanced as they moved from blanket reactions  to texts, labeling a given text as PAST (bad) or CUSP (good), to discussing  texts in terms of a combination of PAST and CUSP elements.  122   Composition Studies </page> <page sequence="12"> The writing assignments helped students develop a critical stance toward  texts and toward science. With the weekly SRAs, I showed students that any  thoughtful, well-supported claim was acceptable by playing Elbow’s “believ- ing game” as I read and responded. In one early SRA, a student talked about  how little he cared about the topic, a comment I considered just as valid as  other students’ more enthusiastic responses. Allowing students to express  themselves freely in the “response” sections, and making sure to respond  positively to any response, reinforced the message that challenging dogma  was acceptable, and even favored. The SRAs also helped students learn and/or practice foundational skills  such as summarizing texts and conducting rhetorical analyses. This practice  was helpful when they wrote their research papers because they were already  in the habit of thinking about texts in terms of the writer’s choices. The  research paper then built on this foundation by having them do an inquiry- driven investigation into what writers weren’t saying. The stages described  above—proposal, research report, draft, and final revision—worked well.  None of the students had trouble choosing an article, topic, or lens, and  collectively they chose the full range of lenses. For example, some students  selected highly epideictic texts and explored the forensic detail that the  author might have included. In some cases, the students showed how that  detail would have supported the author’s claims; in other cases, the students  showed how the epideictic prose was hiding some unsavory facts. Other  lenses were similarly used to guide students’ research and to help students  critique the primary texts.  I will make changes in the concepts I cover when I teach the course  again. Shawn Glynn, Lori Aultman, and Ashley Owens suggest that faculty  engage students’ interest “by introducing them to concepts that are mod- erately novel and moderately complex... [to] pique the students’ curiosity,  while avoiding boredom or anxiety” (164). In designing the course, I had  tried to aim for a middle ground between boredom (too little complexity)  and anxiety (too much), and at the end I felt I had aimed too far toward the  anxiety end of the spectrum. There were a few reasons I felt this way. First,  on a purely subjective level, I felt rushed. Perhaps in response to this feeling,  during the course I found myself merging some concepts that seemed close  enough to warrant their not being taken separately. More importantly, many  students didn’t quite grasp a fundamental concept of the course, a rhetorical  understanding of genre in which texts are viewed as “mediating artifacts  rather than things in themselves” (Bazerman and Russell 1). It was clear  in retrospect that I need to slow down and give more time to the concept  of genre. At the same time, I want to keep the course complex, not only to  hold students’ interest but also to accurately convey the complexity of the  popular science writing genre and of issues of science in society.  Ultimately, I have decided to maintain the basic framework of the  course, but to streamline it by removing one concept, merging two others,  and changing the order in which we use the lenses. The topic I removed  UWP 011: Popular Science &amp; Technology Writing   123 </page> <page sequence="13"> is the distinction between science and technology (not mentioned on the  syllabus but brought up in the initial lecture); we didn’t have enough time  to address it well, and the distinction turned out not to be germane for  the issues we discussed. As physicist and philosopher Gerard Fourez notes,  although science and technology are different, the importance of the differ- ence depends on the context; sometimes the differences matter and other  times the similarities matter (909). The topics I merged, in action last Winter and in the plan for this Winter,  are risk and certainty/uncertainty (week 6 in the syllabus). I also plan to  move these from the end of the course to near the start. That is, after the  opening material (sociohistorical context, the PAST and CUSP models, and  hot versus cold science, covered in weeks one and two), I will move directly  to talking about risk and uncertainty. Addressing risk and uncertainty to- gether makes sense as the two generally blur into each other—uncertainty  matters most when there is something at risk, and risk is harder to talk  about in conditions of uncertainty than when likely outcomes are known.  Addressing these first makes sense because in Winter 2011, these were the  concepts that really cemented students’ understanding that science is not  just something that happens in a lab but instead is an inseparable part of  our lives. Having that understanding come in week two or three, instead  of in week six, should result in more productive discussions earlier in the  quarter. If we can reach a level of critical understanding in week three that  last time came in weeks six and seven, we should be able to push the critical  reading and analysis aspects of the class even further.  Shifting the risk and certainty/uncertainty lens earlier also makes sense  because talking about risk and uncertainty immediately after introducing  the idea of hot and cold science will demonstrate why the distinction mat- ters when discussing science in society; distinguishing hot from cold science  lets us acknowledge the many contributions of science while maintaining a  critical perspective. Or, as Michael Ford puts it, seeing science in these terms  allows us to escape from the “positivist endeavor” that “casts the success  of science in terms of universal logic and scientific methods” (Ford 406),  while still realizing that the various sciences have, over the years, “resulted  in considerably reliable knowledge claims” (407). Along with changing the order of the lenses, I plan to change the order  of the readings. In Winter 2011, I started with some models of good (CUSP)  popular science writing, thinking they would provide a positive benchmark  against which students could measure other texts. That turned out to be  a mistake; until they saw the problematic aspects of popular science writ- ing in the PAST model, students were confused about why the PAST/CUSP  distinction mattered. When they did read an overtly PAST-model text, they  expressed immediate comprehension and they became more actively engaged  in exploring where other texts fell on the PAST-CUSP continuum. A quick illustration comes from the first article in BASNW 2010, Andrew  Corsello’s “The Believer,” which we read in week eight. Although we had  124   Composition Studies </page> <page sequence="14"> talked and read about the problem of popular science writing that describes  scientists in godlike terms, the class didn’t fully appreciate this problematic  trope until they read descriptions of the scientist-entrepreneur Elon Musk  that cast him in blatantly religious terms. For example, in his childhood,  when his siblings and cousins were afraid of the dark, six-year-old Musk knew  better, and Corsello shows the scene through the eyes of Musk’s aunt Maye: The light has mostly waned, but Elon, he’s so white, skin as pale as a fish’s  belly, and Maye Musk can see his face so clearly. Beaming. Euphoric. Be- cause he knows. Elon hasn’t been bickering with his sister and brother; he has been evan- gelizing. And now he raises both arms to make sure they can see, as well  as hear, the good news. “Do not be scared of the darkness!” Elon Musk calls out to them from the  wilderness. “There is nothing to fear—it is merely the absence of light!”  (3, emphasis in original) From his early years as miraculous child, “a child with freakish talent” (3),  to his adult mission “to give the human race its biggest upgrade since the  advent of consciousness” (5), Elon is shown as nothing less than godlike  in his abilities and his scope. Once students had read and discussed the  problems with this kind of presentation, including the fact that setting up  scientists as gods can easily lead to disillusionment when they fail to pro- duce miracles, they had a better sense of how other texts better served sci- ence and readers of popular science texts by presenting scientists in more  measured, reasonable, and human terms. In Winter 2012 I plan to use a  similarly blatant example from the Best American Science Writing 2011,  assigning it during week one so I can refer to it while explaining the PAST  model of scientific literacy. Having narrowed the course’s conceptual breadth and reordered the  readings should let me add a few secondary sources to the mix. Not having  taught this kind of class before, and being new to teaching lower division  courses at UC Davis, I was initially unsure about what kinds of secondary  texts would be appropriate, or whether they would fit into a quarter already  stuffed full of reading popular science texts. After teaching the class, I think  that my initial instinct to focus on primary texts was sound, but that I can  work in some secondary sources. In particular, I plan to add two articles. The first article is Kelly Dirk’s 2010 “Navigating Genres” article from  Writing Spaces: Readings on Writing. Unlike more theory-heavy genre texts  I considered and rejected as being at too high a level for UWP 011—for  example, Carolyn Miller, Amy Devitt, and Anis Bawarshi and Mary Jo  Reiff—Dirk’s article introduces the concept of genre in terms suitable for  an undergraduate course. It also uses easily grasped examples to illustrate  how genres function socially and epistemically (without ever resorting to  the word “epistemically”!). I also plan to use “Science’s New Social Contract  UWP 011: Popular Science &amp; Technology Writing   125 </page> <page sequence="15"> with Society,” a short (four-page) Nature article in which physicist Michael  Gibbons argues that scientists need to be more concerned with how their  work affects others, and should “ensure that scientific knowledge is ‘socially  robust’, and that its production is seen by society to be both transparent and  participative” (C81). While the article by Dirk should help students better  understand genre, Gibbons’ article shows that scientists as well as humanities  scholars care about open communication between scientists and the public. UC Davis is on the quarter system, and the limitations of a ten-week term  meant I had to leave out assignments I would like to have included. If I had  more time, I would make three significant changes. First, I would add more  secondary sources. Second, I would add some scientific research articles.  An ideal text for this is A Century of Nature: Twenty-One Discoveries that  Changed Science and the World (Garwin and Lincoln), which brings together  21 original articles published in Nature during the twentieth century with  commentaries written on them today. The book would be excellent because  it reflects “a relatively common popularization goal... of promoting a more  holistic view of science and highlighting its inextricable connections to culture  at large” (Zerbe 109). And third, I would add a stylistic imitation exercise. I  have done this in previous creative non-fiction classes, and it is immensely  effective for helping students understand the way that tone and stance are  created at the level of word choice. Basically, an imitation piece would do  at the micro level what the research paper does at the macro level—show  students how different decisions create different textual effects. In terms of disciplinary identity, I would like to say that UWP 011 has  helped establish the writing program as a disciplinary unit that is dedicated  to but goes beyond its service function in teaching required composition  courses, but I know better. Even the most well-received class is a fraction  of the curriculum needed to create and sustain disciplinary status, and the  struggle for recognition is much bigger than one class, or one professor, or  even one program. That said, UWP 011 does complement and support our  existing curriculum by adding a theory course that dovetails nicely with a  WAC-based view of writing as always rooted in a particular context. Over all, despite the bumpy aspects in Winter 2011, and the new bumps  I am sure I will encounter in Winter 2012, I think that UPW 011 and courses  like it are well suited to meet important social and academic needs for critical  and rhetorical scientific literacy. Even though students in UWP 011 did not  fully grasp a central concept of the course (genre as social action), they did  learn to view texts as rhetorical artifacts, and to see science as embedded  in and influenced by its sociohistorical context. And while I initially resisted  paring back what seemed like an overly narrow conceptual toolkit, review- ing student papers to write this Course Design has reminded me that the  goal is not to teach students to do everything. Rather, it is to broaden their  understanding of what can be done, and to teach them to do some aspects  of it well in the hope that they will maintain and build on those skills.  126   Composition Studies </page> <page sequence="16"> Notes 1.  I use “Writing Studies” as an umbrella term that includes Writing, Rhetoric,  and Composition Studies. 2.  As Brown, Reveles, and Kelly note, valuing sociocultural-centered SL does not  devalue information-centered SL, and vice versa. Thus, my emphasis on CSL  does not reflect a desire to get rid of instrumental SL, but rather a recognition  of its limitations.  3.  I started out referring to it as PUST, but changed the label to the more ac- curate “Public Appreciation of Science and Technology” (PAST) after explain- ing for the umpteenth time that the “understanding” part of PUST was really  about appreciation. 4.  Zerbe does discuss ways to use scientific texts in first-year composition, and I  refer interested readers to his excellent book. 5.  Other concepts introduced during the course included: anthropomorphism  and mechanomorphism, eugenics, the Mertonian norms, and various kinds  of scientism (axiological scientism, epistemic scientism, existential scientism,  ontological scientism, and political scientism). 6.  Roger Ochse notes that “Single system reasoning is prerequisite to higher  level reasoning, since reading comprehension and understanding of texts is  the very basis of forming judgments and assessments in a multi-system rea- soning environment” (4).
