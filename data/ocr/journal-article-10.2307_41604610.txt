<plain_text><page sequence="1">AL-HWARAZMI ON THEOLOGY AND SECTS : */ THE CHAPTER ON KALAM IN THE MAFÂTÏH AL-ULÜM BY C.E. BOSWORTH (University of Manchester) I. INTRODUCTION Abü 'Abd Allãh al-Hwârazmï is an obscure figure, and what little we know of his life connects him not with Hwãrazm, which may have been only the home of his forebears, but with Transoxania, where he seems to have been a secretary in the Sãmãnid bureaucracy at Buhãrã. He was, so far as is known, vir unius libri, and his "Keys of the sciences", which aimed at providing a reference work for the compleat secretary, was dedicated to the vizier of the Sãmãnids Abü 1-Hasan 'Ubayd Allãh b. Ahmad al-ťUtbI. The date of the book's composition is accord- ingly fixed at 367/977, the beginning of al-eUtbI's vizierate, or shortly afterwards. An analysis of the Mafãílh al-ulüm and a general account of its position in the develop- ment of the minor Islamic genre of dictionaries of technical terms and classifications of the sciences has already been given by the present author (1). Virtually all of the second discourse of the book, which deals with the non- Arabic, 'Agami, sciences (in effect, the Greek ones of philosophy, logic, music, medicine, and the natural and mathematical sciences) has been translated into one or other western language, above all, by the German historian of science, E. Wiede- mann. By contrast, much less has been translated of the first discourse on the traditional Islamic sciences; these comprise only some partial translations of the sixth chapter on history and a virtually complete translation, with detailed commentary, of the fourth chapter on kitãba, again by the present author (2). There is now offered here a translation of the second chapter of this 1) C.E. Bosworth, "A pioneer Arabic ency- clopaedia of the sciences : al-Khwárizmťs 'Keys of the Sciences' ", Isis , LIV/1, No. 175 (March 1963), 97-111. 2) Idem , "Abü "Abdallah al-Khwãrazml on the technical terms of the secretary's art : a contribution to the administrative history of medieval Islam", JESHO, XII/2 (1969), 113-64.

Sabra.</page><page sequence="2">86 C.E. BOSWORTH discourse, that dealing with kalãm. This includes not only a vocabulary of the technical terms of the theologians and an enumeration of the great theological problems discussed by them, but also a fairly detailed exposition of the sects of the Muslims, with some note of those of the Christians and Jews as well. It is, in this respect, in the line of the great Muslim heresiographers, some of whom, like Abü 1-Iiasan al-As'arï, were slightly older contemporaries of al-Hwärazml, and others, like eAbd al-Qãhir al-Bagdãdl and Ibn IJazm, somewhat younger ones. It has not seemed that this chapter on kalãm requires the detailed annotation which that on kitãba, for instance, demanded, for there the technical terms were often little-attested elsewhere or not attested at all, or alternatively al-Hwärazml was using them in a special sense or context. Al-Hwârazmï' s theological terms and names of sects are almost all well-kaown and are used in their familiar meanings and situations. Hence what follows is a straightforward translation. It may, however, be worth while to make a few prefatory remarks about the author's attitude and approach in this chapter of his book. Like most of the heresiographers, al-Hwârazmï is quite unhistorical in his attitude towards classification of the sects. Religious groups which had totally disappeared by his lifetime, such as the early Sfï Kaysãniyya and the Hašabiyya (the Kãfir-kubãt of al-Muhtär's rebellion), and indeed, the greater part of the Hawarig, are listed by him as still extant, in his zeal for complet- eness and for the construction of neat pyramids of sects and sub-sects. This desire for neatness and organisation probably explains the inclusion of the 'Abbãsiyya as a division of the Sfa rather than as a parallel sectarian development which did, it is true, cleverly exploit nascent Šťl sentiment in the later Umayyad period. On the whole, as befits the classifier rather than the critic or polemicist, al-Hwârazmï is dispassionate in attitude. Only a very few groups are condemned by phrases of the type Allah ta'älä eammã yaqülün, sc. the Qua&lt;iä'iyya among the anthropomorphists and the assertion of all the Mušabbiha that God has a corporeal body, the òamãmiyya of the ôãliyya or extremist Šfa, and the Christians for their doctrine of the three hypostases of the Godhead. Equally strange is al-Hwârazmï's belief that the Melkite Christians stemmed from a religious leader named Malkä (on analogy with the Nestorians and Jacobites, named from their leaders), especially as the Christianity of Hwãrazm in his time seems to have largely Melìkite in its theology, from its trans-continental connections with the Byzantine Church in the Black Sea coastlands (3). His fourth section on the Jews mentions the adherents of various of the Messianic movements which affected Rabbinical Judaism in the 8th and 9th centuries A.D.; the Karaites appear as the eAnäniyya, sc. the adherents of eAnan ben David. The story of the Septuagint is retailed, with the probable motivator of this work, King Philadelphus, the second Ptolemy (285-247 B.C.) appearing as "one of the kings of the Greeks", baed mulük al-Rüm. Doubtless because of his own Iranian origin, al-Hwârazmï displays a particular interest in the religions of older Iran; in his time, Zoroastrianism probably still survived in Transoxiana, 3) See A.Z.V. Tog an, The Khorezmians and their civilization, preface to facs. edn. of the glossary to al-Zamahsari's Muqaddimat al-adab (Istanbul, 1951), 20-1.</page><page sequence="3">THE CHAPTER ON KALAM IN THE MAFÂTÏH AL-'ULÜM 87 and Buddhism cannot have been long dead. Hence in his fifth section he shows himself well- informed about the Manichaeans and Mazdakites, and about the Zoroastrian cult, its priesthood, its creation myths and its cosmology. Of the Indian world, however, he was no better-informed than most of his contemporaries in the pre-Blrünl period; what little awareness there was went back, it was surmised by Minorsky, to an envoy sent by the BarmakI Yahyã b. Hälid to India ca. 800 (4). Al-Hwârazmï accordingly mentions here only the Brahmans and the Buddhists (al-Sumaniyya/al-Šamaniyya &lt; Sanskrit šramana "ascetic"), and connects Büdäsaf (&lt; Bodhi- sattva, from legends of the Buddha communicated to the Islamic world via Central Asian Manichaeism) with the Sabians of Harrãn and with Hermes Trismegistus, as does al-Bïrûnï following him a generation or so later (5).

However, in his chapter on historical information, the sixth one in the first discourse, al-Hwârazmï has a few lines on "The classes of people in India", mentioning the Brahmans again, the Südariyya (sc. the Südras), the Baysiyya (sc. the Vaisyas) and the Sandãliyya (sc. the Candãlas), and also the ethnic group of the Zutt or Jhats (ed. van Vloten [see following note], 123). 6) Ed.

It is also said that al-Mawgüd is what can only be described negatively ( al-muntafï ) and which has no being or permanent existence. al-Qadim ("the pre-eternal, the eternally-existent") is what has always existed. al-Muhdat ("the created") is what is now in existence after formerly not being. al-Azalï ("the eternal") is what has always been and always is. al-Gawhar ("substance") is what may be invested with various states (, ahwãl ) and modalities (kayfiyyãt) in differing quantities and combinations (al-mutadãddãt ealã miqdãrihã ). According to the speculative theologians of the Mu'tazila, corporeal entities (agsãm) are composed of indivisible particles ( agzã 5 lã tatagazza), and in their opinion, these are substances. al-Hatt ("linear extent"), is, according to them, what is made up of substances as to length alone. al-Sath ("plane surface extent") is what is made up of substances as to length and breadth alone. al-Gism ("corporeality"), is, according to them, what is made up of substances as to length, breadth and depth. al- Arad ("accident") is the quiddity of substance, like movement in something moving, whiteness in what is white and blackness in what is black. But in the parlance of the philosophers and geometricians, these terms have different meanings from those which I have mentioned in this chapter; if God wills, I shall deal with them in the appropriate chapters on their technical terminology. Ays is the opposite of laysa ("it is not"). Al-Halll b. Ahmad has said, " Laysa is only lã plus ays; they have omitted the hamza and elided the lãm and yã' The proof of this is that the Arabs say, 'Bring me so-and-so, the whole of it ( min hayt ays wa-lays )' ". al-Dãt ("essence") is the very heart and distillation of a thing. al-Tafra ("abrupt change") is a high leap. You say, tafartu l-šay*a atfiruhu tafr an when you jump over it, and al-tafra means "the single act of jumping". al-Ragc a ("return") is, according to some of the Sfa, the re-appearance of the Imäm after his death, or, according to some, after his occultation (gay ba). al-Tahkïm is the slogan of the IJarüriyya, "No arbitration except by God"; these people are called al-Muhakkima ("those who declare, 'No arbitration except by God' "). Section 2 concerning the names of the various schools of thought and belief amongst the Muslims These comprise seven schools of belief. The first is the Mutazila, also called "the People of Justice and God's Unity". They have six subdivisions.

The sixth school of belief is that of the Murgia ("those who suspend judgment on the question of grave sinners"). They have six subdivisions. Firstly, the Gaylãniyya, followers of</page><page sequence="6">90 C.E. BOSWORTH Gaylãn b. Haraša al-Dabbî. Secondly, the Sãlihiyya, followers of Sãlih b. eAbd Allah, known as Qunna.

Fifthly, the Šamiriyya, stemming from Abü Šamir Salim b. Šamir. Sixthly, the Gahdariyya, followers of Gahdar b. Muhammad al-Tamlml. The seventh school of belief is that of the Sta. They have five divisions. The first division is that of the Zaydiyya, and they in turn have five subdivisions. The first is that of the Abtariyya, stemming from Kutayyir al-Nübl, who had the name al-Mugïra b. Sa' d and the laqab al-Abtar ("the childless"). The second subdivision of the Zaydiyya is the Garüdiyya, stemming from Abu 1-Gärüd Ziyãd b. Abi Ziyäd. The third subdivision of the Zaydiyya is the Dukayniyya, followers of al-Fadl b. Dukayn. The fourth subdivision of the Zaydiyya is the Hašabiyya, also known as the Surhãbiyya, stemming from Surhãb al-Tabarï; they were called Hašabiyya because they joined al-Muhtãr5s rebellion against the state, having no weapons except wooden clubs (al-hasab). The fifth subdivision of the Zaydiyya is the Halafiyya, followers of Halaf b. eAbd al-Samad. The second division of the Šťa is that of the Kaysãniyya. Kay sãn was a freedman of eAlI b. Abï Tälib's, peace be upon him. They have four subdivisions. The first is that of the Muhtãriyya, followers of al-Muhtãr b. Abï eUbayd, who received his doctrine from Kay sãn. The second subsdivision of the Kaysãniyya is the Ishãqiyya, stemming from Ishäq b. eAmr. The third subdivision is the Karibiyya, followers of Abü Karib al-Darïr. The fourth subdivision is the Harbiyya, stemming from eAbd Allãh b. £Umar b. Harb. The third division of the Šfa is that of the c Abbãsiyya. They trace their origin back to the house of aWAbbãs b. 'Abd al-Muttalib, may God be pleased with him, and have two subdivisions. The first subdivision is that of the Hallãliyya, followers of Abü Salama al-Hallãl. The second subdivision is the Rãwandiyya , followers of al-Qãsim b. Rãwand. The fourth division of the Šfa is that of the Gãliyya («extremists»). They have nine subdi- visions. The first subdivision is that of the Kãmiliyya, followers of Abü Kãmil. The second is the Sabďiyya, followers of eAbd Allãh b. Saba5. The third is the Mansüriyya, followers of Mançûr al-Tglï. The fourth is the Gurâbiyya; they have that name because they say that eAlï, peace be upon him, resembled the Prophet more closely than one raven ( gurãb ) to another. The fifth is the Tayyãriyya, who hold, the doctrine of the transmigration of souls ( tanãsuh ); they stem from Ga'far al-Tayyãr. The sixth is the BazTiyya, who stem from Bazť b. Yünus. The seventh is the Ya'füriyya, who stem from Muhammad b. Ya£für. The eighth is the Gamãmiyya ; they are called thus because of their assertion that God, He is exalted, comes down to earth in a cloud {gamam) every spring and travels about the world. But God is exalted above what they say ! The ninth is the Ismailiyya, that is, the Bãtiniyya. The fifth division of the Šfa is that of the Imãmiyya, that is, the Rãfidiyya ; they are so- called because of their rejection ( rafd ) of Zayd b. £AlI, may God be pleased with both of these. The include the following. The Naüsiyya, who stem from eAbd Allãh b. Nä'üs. The Mufaddaliyya, who stem from al-Muf addai b. eUmar, and who are also called the Qata'iyya,</page><page sequence="7">THE CHAPTER ON KALAM IN THE MAFATÎH AL-'ULÜM 91 because they make a break ( qataü ) [in the line of Imams] at the death of Müsä b. Gaefar b. Muhammad. The Šamtiyya, [so-called] because they stem from Yahyä b. Ašmat. The Wãqifiyya, so-called because they stop ( waqafü ) [the line of Imams] at Müsä b. Ga'far and say that he is the seventh [Imam] and that he is still alive and not dead, so that he will eventually rule over both eastern and western ends of the earth. The Mamtüra. That name arose because a certain one of them was once disputing with Yünus b. eAbd al-Rahmãn, one of the Qata'I sect, and Yünus said to him. "You are more contemptible, in my opinion, than rain-drenched (mamtüra) dogs". So this nickname stuck to them. The Ahmadiyya stem from their Imam Ahmad b. Müsä b. Gaefar. The epithets which the Twelver ŠVa give to their Imams ÇA li, al-Murtaclã ("he who is approved by God"); then al-Hasan, al-Mugtabä ("the chosen one"); then al-Husayn, Sayyid al-Šuhada5 ("lord of the martyred ones"); then 'Ali, Zayn al-eÄbi- dln ("ornament of the believers"); then Muhammad, al-Bãqir ("the patient one"); then Ga'far, al-Sãdiq ("the veracious one"); then Müsä , al-Kãzim ("the forbearing one"); then eAll, al-Ridä ("the well-pleasing one"); then Muhammad, al-Hâdï ("the one who guides"); then eAU, al-Sãbir ("the long-suffering one"); then al-Hasan, al-Tähir ("the pure one"); then Muhammad, al Mahd! ("the rightly-guided one"), the one who will carry out God's command, the awaited one, who has not died and who will not die, according to their assertion, until he has filled the whole world with justice, just as it has been filled with injustice. He is Muhammad b. al-Hasan b. 'All b. Muhammad b. eAlï b. Müsä b. Ga'far b. Muhammad b. eAlI b. al-Husayn b. eAlï b. Abl Tãlib, peace be upon them all. Section 3 on the various Christian sects and their technical expressions They comprise three divisions. The first is that of the Malkďiyya (Melkites). They stem from Malkä and are the oldest of them. The second is the Nastüriyya (Nestorians), who stem from Nastüris. He propounded a new view in religion, so they banished him from the kingdom of Byzantium, and [now] there are none of them there. The third is the Ya'qübiyya (Jacobites), stemming from Mär Ya'qüb. They are few in number; the people of Byzantium are all Melkites. [The technical expressions of the Christians include the following:] al-Uqnüm ("hypostasis") is what they use for the term "attribute" (sija). They assert that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit ( ruh al-quds) are three hypostases of God, He is blessed and exalted above what they describe and say ! al-Ittihãd ("unity") is a word derived from al-wahid ("one"). al-Näsüt ("humanity") is a word derived from al-nãs ("mankind"), just as al-rahamüt ("the quality of mercy") is derived from al-rahma ("mercy"). al-Lähüt ("divinity") is derived from the name of Allah, He is exalted. al-Haykal ("place of worship") is a house of images in which there are images of prophets and kings.</page><page sequence="8">92 C.E. BOSWORTH I have mentioned the various religious offices which the Christians possess, together with the names of their various dignitaries, in the chapter on historical information (7). Section 4 on the various Jewish sects and their technical expressions The Jews have numerous subdivisions. Amongst them is that of the e Anãniyya , who stem from eÃnI, just as the followers of Mani are called al-Manãniyya. The e Isawiyya stem from £Isã al-Içfahãnl. He climed to be a prophet among the Jews of Isfahan, although he was actually from Niçibln. The Qariyya are one of their subdivisions; their chief item of diet is vegetables and pumpkins (al-qar), and most of their vessels are [hollo wed-out] pumpkins. The Maqãriba are a sect of them who diverge from the majority of Jews in that they reject anthropomorphism (&lt; al-tasblh ). The Raiyya stem from a certain member of the Jewish community who made a claim to prophethood and who was called al-Rai ("the Shepherd"). The Sãmiriyya are the Samaritan people, so-called after a town in Syria called Sãmiriyya. [The technical expressions of the Jews include the following :] Ra's al-Gälüt ("Exilarch"). He is their chief. Al-Gälüt means al-gãliya, i.e. those who have migrated ( galau ) from their homes in Jerusalem. The Ra5s al-Gälüt has to be from the stock of David, peace be upon him, and the majority of the Jews assert that he may not become chief until the span of his arms is wide and he can touch his knees with his fingertips when he stretches them downwards. al-Kãhin is their Imam; the plural is kahana. al-Habr ("rabbi, scholar") means "learned man". al-Sifr means "book". Every one of the prophets of the Israelites has a book, there being twenty-four books altogether; five of these belong to the Tõrãh, and the rest to the prophets who came after Moses, peace be upon him, each book being attributed to the prophet who came with it. Tawrãt al-Tamänln ("Tõrãh of the Eighty"); it is also said, "of the Seventy". This is the translation made by eighty rabbis for one of the kings of the Greeks. He set them apart and divided them off from each other and then commanded them to translate the Tõrãh. This was so that he might guard against their altering any part of it. They did the work, and it is the most faithful translation of the Tõrãh. But God knows best. Section 5 on the names of the adherents of the various religions and sects The Dahriyya are those who speak of the pre-eternalness of time (&lt; qidam al-dahr). The Mu aitila are those who do not affirm the existence of the Creator ( al-Bãri ), He is exalted and praised. 7) Sc. in section nine of the chapter on historical information, called "Concerning the words which are frequently encountered in the history of the Byzan- tines ( al-Rüm )" (ed. van Vloten, 128-30).</page><page sequence="9">THE CHAPTER ON KALAM IN THE MAFÃTIH AL-'ULÜM 93 The Açhãb al-tanãsuh are those who speak of the transmigration of souls from one body to another, just as a document is transcribed f yunsah ) from one copy to another. The Sumaniyya are the followers of Suman. They are idol-worshippers, who hold the doctrines of the pre-eternalness of time and the transmigration of souls, and who hold that the earth is perpetually settling downwards. In the early times, people were all Sumaniyya and Kaldänfyyün, and the Sumaniyya were idol-worshippers. The Kaldãniyyãn are those who are called Säbiün and Harnäniyyün, and their remnants live at IJarrãn and in Iraq. They assert that their prophet is Büdäsaf, who arose in India, although some of them say he is Hirmis (sc. Hermes). As for Büdäsaf, he lived in the time of the king Tahmürt, and brought a scripture in Persian. These people were called Säbi'ün in the time of al-Ma5mün. But as regards the true Säbi'ün, they are a sect of the Christians. The remnants of the Sumaniyya are in India and China. The Barãhima (Brahmans) are the religious devotees of India; the singular is Brahml. They deny the possibility of prophethood. The Dayçãniyya stem from Ibn Dayçãn, and are dualists ( tanawiyya ). The Marqiyüniyya (Marcionites) stem from Marqiyün, and are also dualists. The Manãniyya (Manichaeans) are the Mãnawiyya, stemming from Mânï. I do not know why they have formed this nisba without analogy, but [in the same way] the Harnãniyya are connected with Harrãn, and the Jewish sect of the 'Anãniyya are connected with eÂnï. The Zanãdiqa are the same as the Mãnawiyya, and the Mazdakiyya used to have that name also. Mazdak was the person who appeared in the reign of Qubãd. He was the Mõbadãn Mõbad, that is, Chief Qãdl of the Zoroastrians, and he claimed that possessions and wives should be held in common. He produced a book called the Zend, and asserted that it was an interpretation of the Avesta, the holy book of the Zoroastrians, brought by Zoroaster, their alleged prophet. So Mazdak's followers were linked with the Zend, and such a one was called a Zendï. Then the word was arabised, and one said Zindlq for the singular and Zanãdiqa for the plural. The Bihãfarldiyya are a kind of Zoroastrian group stemming from a man called Bih-Äfrld b. Farvardïnân. He arose after the appearance of Islam, in the time of Abü Muslim, in one of the rural districts of Nlsäpür, that of Hwãf, in its market town of Sarãwand. He introduced his own scripture, and opposed the Zoroastrians in most points of their religious prescriptions. One group of the Zoroastrians followed him, but the majority of them opposed him. The Harãbida are the servitors of the sacred fires; the singular is Hirbad. Yazdãn is, according to the Zoroastrians, the originator of good. Ahriman is, so they assert, the originator of evil. al-Humãma is, according to the Mãnawiyya, the spirit of chaos ( lulma ), that is, in their opinion, smoke. Kayümart is, according to the Zoroastrians, the first man. Masã and Masäyana are, according to them, like Adam and Eve. They assert that they were created from a sorrel-bush (ribas) which sprang up from a drop of Kayümart's semen.</page><page sequence="10">94 C.E. BOSWORTH The Süfistaiyyün are those who refuse to affirm the essential nature of things ( haqaiq al-asyď ); it is a Greek word. As for the terms of the philosophers, I have mentioned them in their appropriate chapters.

Section 7 on the basic questions of religion which the speculative theologians talk about The first is the topic of the creation of corporeal substances {hudüt al-agsãm) and the refutation of the Dahriyya who talk about the pre-eternalness of time. [Then there is] the proof that there is an originator (muhdit) for the world, that is, God, He is exalted, and the refutation of the Mu'attila. [Then the proof that] He, He is exalted and praised, is pre-existent, knowing, powerful and endowed with life. [Then the proof that] He is one, and the refutation of the dualists among the Zoroastrians and Zanãdiqa, of the Christians who assert that God is three, and of the others who speak of a multiplicity of creators. [Then the proof that] He does not resemble [created] things, and the refutation of the Jews and other anthropomorphists. [Then the proof that] He is without corporeal body, whereas many of the anthropomorphists among the Muslims have said that He does have a corporeal body. God is exalted far above what they assert! [Then the proof that] He, He is exalted, is knowing, powerful and endowed with life by His own essence, whereas the majority of people, with the exception of the Mďtazila, say that He is knowing through his knowledge, endowed with life through His quality of being alive and powerful through His power; and that these attributes existed pre-eternally with Him. Then the topic of prophetic vision ( al-ruyã ), whether it is to be denied or whether it can be authenticated. [Then the topics] whether His will is created in time or pre-eternal, or whether His word is created or uncreated. Then as regards the actions of God's servants, whether they are originated by God, He is praised and exalted, or by the believers themselves; and whether the power of initiating actions (al-istitď a) precedes the action or accompanies it. [Then the topic] whether God, He is exalted, wills evil deeds ( qabaih ) or not. Then whether a person who dies in the state of having committed grave sins ( kabair ), without having repented, will be everlastingly in Hellfire, or whether God, He is exalted, may perhaps have mercy on him, overlook his transgressions and let him enter Paradise. The Mu'tazila say that those who are guilty of grave sins are evil-doers ( fussãq ), neither believers nor unbelievers, and this is an</page><page sequence="11">THE CHAPTER ON KALAM IN THE MAFÄTlH AL-eULÜM 95 intermediate stage between the two ( manzila bayn al-manzilatayn). Other, however, say that people are either believers or unbelievers, and that intercession does not extend as far as evil- doers; whereas yet a further group say that it does extend as far as them, and that it is meant for evil-doers, though not for anyone else. Then the proof of the reality of prophethood, which forms a refutation of the Barãhima and others who ridicule its possibility. Then the proof of Muhammad's prophethood, and the question of the Imãmate and who is and who is not suitable for it. These are the basic questions of religion which the speculative theologians talk and dispute about. All the rest are either secondary to these or else are preliminary points and premises ( muqaddamãt wa-tawtiyãt) to them.</page></plain_text>
