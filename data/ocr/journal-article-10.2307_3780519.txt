<plain_text><page sequence="1">70 Book reviews A.C. Esmeijer, Divina Quaternitas: a preliminary study in the method and application of visual exegesis. Assen (Van Gorcum) 1978.* Dante, in his Convivio, showed that he was familiar with the interpretive model of the fourfold exegesis, which he also believed was necessary for a proper understanding of poetry: "namely, that writings can be comprehended and have to be interpreted according to, at most, four senses. The first sense is known as the literal ..., the second is the allegorical, the third the moral, the fourth the anagogic ..." This passage, and the underlying exegetic tradition, led Hans von der Gabelentz to postulate that "even those paintings, whose subject is Holy Writ [acquire] a far more profound meaning then could be given to them by a strictly historical [i.e. literal] interpre- tation."1 Hans Sedlmayer uses the exegetic model of the four sensus fairly systematically in his later "iconological" studies of works of art. He believes that paintings can also be interpreted ac- cording to the exegetic sensus, given the emancipation of painting in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and the value placed on the maxim "ut pictura poesis." He uses this ap- proach to explain Bruegel's Parable of the blind, Velazquez' Hilanderas and Vermeer's Allegory of painting.2 Gombrich was probably referring to this kind of contro- versial approach when he wrote that the temptation is great for the iconologist to emulate the technique of exegetics, which was used so extensively in the middle ages and in the Renais- sance, applying it in his turn to the works of art of the past. Gombrich goes on to say that he knows of "no medieval or Renaissance text which applies this doctrine [of the exegetic model] to works of pictorial art." Although he admits that "such an argument ex silentio can never carry complete con- viction," he rightly points out that the question needs further examination.3 A.C. Esmeijer, in her Divina Quaternitas, attempts to break through that "silentium", at any rate for the early middle ages. Her argument, which is fairly convincing, leads to the conclusion that the multiple exegesis played an unequivocal role in the art of the middle ages, and that there are clear *Review translated from the Dutch by Michael Hoyle.

For his grounds for believing that certain representations and repre- sentational programs really were intended as pictorialized exe- gesis, and can thus be read according to several sensus. Esmeijer's point of departure is the legitimacy of the visual arts, which was recognized even in early Christian times and was based on the analogy between the functions of image and word. The Christian equivalent of the classical "ut pictura poesis" was the "pictura quasi scriptura"-a concept which played a not inconsiderable role in discussions about the validity of Christian art. The advocates of the image argued that it had a didactic and pedagogical function, in which respect it was considered to be equal to the word, and a mystical function, which actually made it superior to the word. Esmeijer feels that the analogy of "scriptura" and "pictura" was of paramount importance for the origin and development of what is known as visual exegesis: "a kind of exposition of Holy Scripture in which the customary roles of word and image have been reversed, so that the representation or pro- gramme provides the Scriptural exegesis in very compressed picture form" (p. ix). Biblical exegetics evolved in the early centuries of the Christian era from an interpretive model on two levels (history and allegory) to a model with three and even four levels (his- tory, allegory, tropology and anagoge). This fourfold scrip- tural exegesis became a more or less standardized system, notably in the works of Augustine, Cassian and Gregory the Great. History usually represents the literal meaning of the reality of the Old Testament type, and allegory the New Testament antitype, or exposition in terms of Christ, the church or the sacraments, tropology is the moral interpre- tation, and anagoge the eschatological interpretation. This model for interpreting the Bible was current throughout the middle ages, and was still being used long afterwards. There are indications that there was a flourishing exegesis based on the fourfold patristic model, particularly in the Carolingian period and in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Esmeijer's examination of early Christian scenes and pro- grams which may have a visual exegetic element leads to the conclusion that there was not, at that time, any "application of interpretation of Vermeer's Allegory oJ painting see "Jan Vermeer: der Ruhm der Malkunst," in Festschrift fur Hans Jantzen, Berlin i95 , pp. I69-77.

The available evidence, chiefly in the form of surviving tituli, shows that visual programs were used to place Old Testament scenes in a typological relationship with New Testament scenes, but there is little to indicate that any more than the two sensus of history and allegory were involved. Early Christian visual pro- grams, such as those in baptisteries, can be interpreted in several sensus, but according to Esmeijer there is no evidence that this was the intention, or even that they were interpreted in this way. It is only when we come to the Carolingian period that we find the first clear indications of a deliberate attempt to provide a more comprehensive visual exegesis. One major factor which stimulated the development of pictorial exegesis, and was even, in a sense, a precondition for that development, was the realization of the value of visibilesfigurationes as a didactic tool. The image came to be appreciated not just as an element grafted onto the text, but as a valuable entity in its own right. It was found that schemes and diagrams could be used to explain complex material in a comprehensible way. The schematic figurae date back to the educational practice of late classical times, and they were retained when the classical school system of the artes liberales was adopted as the basis for Christian education, as propaedeutics for the study of theology. Esmeijer argues that schemata and diagrams from this classical system were used for instruction in scriptural exegesis, since they made it possible to present the multiple interpretation of the Bible clearly and systematically. The most suitable form for this purpose were the fourfold cosmic harmony schemata. Various biblical images and symbols, such as the four rivers of Paradise, the four-sided city of heavenly Jerusalem, and the cross extending to the four points of the compass, were easily grafted onto the quadripartite harmony schemata. An excellent example of the Carolingian adaptation of school schemata for visual exegesis is the Majestas Domini formula, which was expressed in a number of variants in this period. This visual formula was based on the quadripartite cosmic harmony scheme, with a marked emphasis on the center, and an orthogonal or diagonal system of axes. This made the image suitable for expressing various familiar meanings laid down in the patristic exegesis of Genesis 2 and Ezekiel --history: the four rivers of Paradise fed by a single source, the four cheru- bim and the four rotae; allegory: the four evangelists, or the four gospels spread over the world, and the four mysteria Christi; tropology: the four cardinal virtues; and anagoge: the Throned Being amid the four living creatures. 4 B.

Caplan, "The four senses of scriptural interpretation and the theory of preach- The Carolingians may have been the first to embark on visual exegesis, but according to Esmeijer its apogee came in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Not only was there a quantitative increase in the use of visual exegetic scenes and programs, but they became richer and more complex in their content. Art historians have traditionally spoken of an increase in typological works of art, but Esmeijer believes that it is better to speak of visual exegetic works. The last three chapters of the book, entitled "Paradisus quadripartitus and Paradisus quadruplex," "Hierusalem urbs quadrata," and "Crux quadrifaria and Concordia discordan- tium," deal with a number of predominantly twelfth-century works of art which can be characterized as visually exegetic on the basis of the schematic composition and the figures and scenes depicted. Esmeijer has backed her fascinating discussion of a putative method and use of visual exegesis with a wealth of documen- tation covering every possible piece of information which might enhance our understanding of the relationship between word and image in the early middle ages. She repeatedly in- troduces interesting and problematical allied topics, such as the possible role of the ars memorativa, and identifies areas which would repay further study. However, the mass of material and the welter of problems which she raises do not make the reader's task any easier, and certain issues remain unclear and even questionable. Esmeijer is the first scholar to undertake a determined at- tempt to relate the history and methods of written exegesis to the history of the visual arts as a form of pictorialized exegesis. Since study of the history of pictorialized exegesis ne- cessitates an understanding of written exegesis, the author gives an account of the origins and evolution of the latter form. The impression one receives is of a development which led at a fairly early date to a widespread and stable interpretive model involving three or four sensus. Although the studies by Smalley, Spicq, Caplan and de Lubac have demonstrated that multiple interpretation played a considerable role in exegetic practice and in its use in the ars praedicandi,4 I feel that de Lubac's statement that the four sensus interpretation can be seen as "the tenor of Christian literature and art" shows too great a trust in this system for it to serve as a reliable guide to the history of medieval exegesis.5 De Lubac's work, to which Esmeijer repeatedly refers, is highly erudite and is extremely valuable on a number of counts, but from the historical point of view it does have its shortcomings. ing," Specullm 4 (I929), pp. 282-90; H. de Lubac, Exegese medievale: les quatre sens de l'eiriture, 2 vols., Paris I959-64. 5 De Lubac, op. cit. (note 4), vol. i: i, p. 17. 71</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS De Lubac himself admits that his aim was not to provide a historically precise reconstruction of the origins, development and ramifications of methods and models of biblical exegesis, but that he was concerned with a sort of "sociology of thought." His guideline was "the awareness of a faith shared both by himself [i.e. de Lubac] and those whose thought he studies." The primary and almost dogmatic focus on "average represen- tatives of a tradition" of exegesis tends to obscure differences of opinion on what was evidently the commonest, fourfold method of biblical exegesis, as well as variants in the inter- pretation of certain biblical passages.6 Questions regarding the degree and orthodoxy with which different authors applied the four sensus in different periods and environments have not yet been answered satisfactorily. Many of the relevant tracts, for instance, have not yet been published.7 There are indications that the tradition of multiple biblical exegesis led to appeals being made for a more literal interpre- tation, or at least elicited warnings about the dangers of excessive licence in metaphorical interpretation. At the be- ginning of the twelfth century, for example, the early scholas- tic exegetes of St. Victor argued that the main emphasis should be on the literal meaning of the scriptures, and that a certain restraint should be observed as regards libertas tropologiae. The differences of opinion on this point, or apparent differen- ces of opinion, have not yet been clearly delineated. It is evident from de Lubac's discussion of this issue with his colleagues, which is to be found in the first chapter of the second volume of his work, that the "scholarly" arguments about this exegetic "war of methodologies" are still far from settled. Perhaps this is no more than a reflection of the situa- tion in the middle ages.8 The outsider merely notes that there are still many gaps in the history of medieval exegesis. Scholars are all too ready to emphasize that there was a continuous, unbroken tradition, or to assume it as a self-evident truth. Esmeijer, too, is convinced that the history of medieval exegesis is one of a "continuous tradition." It is true that one can see a certain continuity as regards the exegetic elements she discusses in her book: the Throned Being among the four living creatures, Paradise with the four rivers, the heavenly city of Jerusalem, the cross extending in four directions. In other words, the interpretations formulated on these points by the church fathers are also found in the Carolingian period and in the twelfth century. This, though, does not resolve the 6 See M. Cappuyns's discussion of de Lubac's work in Bulletin de Theologie Ancienne et Mediveale 9 (1962), pp. 67-68. Cappuyns speaks of a "wealth of documentation which is however so fragmented that there is a risk of it distorting the picture and turning the middle ages into a kind of a 'night of a thousand years"' ("documentation extremement riche mais dont l'emiettement risque de fausser quelque peu les perspectives et de refaire du moyen age une sorte de 'nuit de milles ans"'). question of whether the full, traditional exegesis applies in each individual pictorialization of certain themes. To put it another way: is it possible, in every case, to use the traditional written exegesis following the model of the four sensus as our source for interpreting works of art ? This, of course, is inextricably bound up with the question of a "method of visual exegesis," or an evolutionary process culminating in such a method. One of the linchpins in Es- meijer's argument on the development of visual exegesis is her hypothesis that linear school schemata were used as an in- structional aid for multiple exegesis. I feel that this calls for some comment. The classical school schemata were undoubtedly used in Christian education, not only in their original form and with the original didactic content, but also as an illustrative frame- work for other subject matter. However, although there are numerous instances of schemata with a traditional profane content, as well as examples of schemata with Christian sub- ject matter, it is noteworthy that there are hardly any un- questionable examples of (non-figurative) schemata with in- scriptions showing that they were used for instruction in multiple exegesis, either for explaining the method, or as exercises in the use of the method. This is in no way to deny that in many cases school schemata determined the markedly schematic composition of scenes, or that elements from the profane school schemata were integrated in Christian scenes. These facts are virtually beyond dispute. One only has to call to mind schematic scenes in which part of the original content of the scheme was transmigrated along with the scheme itself, a case in point being the IN initial in the Bible of St. Hubert (fig. 21). However, I do not believe that there is sufficient evidence to support the suggestion that multiple exegesis was taught and practised using fourfold cosmic harmony schemata. As regards the significance for medieval iconography of the adap- tation of school schemata, I feel that this assumption (and its consequences for a possible method of multiple visual exe- gesis) should be used with the greatest caution until more evidence is forthcoming. According to the author, one interesting step on the road to multiple visual exegesis was the Majestas Domini formula de- veloped in the Carolingian period, which arose from an adap- tation of quadripartite cosmic harmony schemata. This adap- tation was brought about chiefly by Irenaeus's exegesis of Ezekiel i, in which he compared the four evangelists to cosmic quaternities as the four principal winds. The ingredients of the 7 As noted for instance by H. Freytag, "Quae sunt per allegoriam dicta.

(note 4), vol. 2: I, pp. 9-I4. 72</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS Carolingian Majestas Domini representations were borrowed from the exegetic speculations of the church fathers on Gene- sis 2 and Ezekiel i, in which a connection was made between the four rivers of Paradise, the tetramorphic cherubim (his- tory), the four gospels/evangelists, the four mysteria Christi (allegory), the four cardinal virtues (tropology), and the four living creatures around the Throned Being (anagoge). Accord- ing to Esmeijer, the Majestas Domini representation, as it took shape around the time of the Carolingians, is "the graphic reproduction of this [extremely varied exegesis] in a concen- trated form" (p. 49). The emphasis on one or more of these exegetic sensus depended on the schematic framework selected. A scheme with a marked accent on the center and an ortho- gonal or diagonal system of axes referred chiefly to the four gospels emanating as rivers from a single source (Christ) and flowing to the four corners of the world. An example of this is the Majestas Domini in an evangelistary in the treasury of Trier cathedral, which was executed at Echternach around 730 (fig. 36). In other cases the choice of a scheme with four circles at the corners of a rectangular frame highlights St. Jerome's interpretation of the four evangelists as a quadriga. This is found in another evangelistary at Trier, dating from the first quarter of the ninth century (fig. 38). The equivalence of the quadriga of the four evangelists and the quadriga of the four rivers of Paradise as vehiculum to the kingdom of Christ or the Lamb, is expressed in the well-known copper book cover in the Musee de Cluny at Paris, which dates from the twelfth century. There the rivers of Paradise are grouped in a quadri- partite scheme around the Lamb of God. The exegetic source of Genesis 2 and Ezekiel i also provides the concept of the quadriga virtutum. Ambrose associates the four living creatures with the motions of the human soul. Similarly, compositions in which the four cardinal virtues are related to the Majestas Domini formula are to be seen as a sign of harmony and as vehiculum to higher things. According to Esmeijer, a harmony of virtues can be interpreted on several levels: referring to Christ or the church (allegory), and to man (tropology), while the anagogic sensus is implicit in the idea of the quadriga as vehiculum to the realm of Christ. All the examples cited by the author in this context involve elements from the detailed exegesis of Genesis 2 and Ezekiel i made by the fathers of the church, each in his own way. This patristic exegesis is reflected in the exegetic literature of the Carolingian period and of the twelfth century. However, as regards the visual exegesis of the Majestas Domini formula and related representations put forward by Esmeijer, I feel that there are a number of basic questions which still require an answer, or which have been answered inadequately. First and foremost, is it possible to regard the general schemes for the Majestas Domini and related representations as being potential bearers, in themselves, of this "extremely varied exegesis," and if so, to what extent are they the medium for that message? The presumed use of quadripartite cosmic harmony schemes for school practice in multiple exegesis is clearly important here. Or are exegetic meanings only high- lighted when seen in conjunction with the figuration within the scheme ? If that is the case we have to ask whether each and every quaternity selected as an illustration from the approp- riate exegetic arsenal can serve as a peg for the complete, four sensus exegesis of Genesis 2 and Ezekiel i. If it is merely a question of emphasizing one or more elements of the exe- gesis on the basis of the schematic framework selected, to what extent are we intended to recognize the other elements and sensus ? Esmeijer's argument is unclear on these points. Occasion- ally (pp. 47-50) she gives the impression that the Majestas Domini representations and related images always have the same multiple, visual exegetic function, and that the only differences are ones of emphasis. Elsewhere she suggests that the exegetic message of the representation is, in fact, more limited. For example, when used as the frontispiece to an evangelistary or as decoration on a book cover, the Majestas is apparently a visual exegetic scheme of the patristic expositions on the unity of the four gospels (p. 49). Is that the only exegetic function of the representation, or is the viewer also meant to consider the entire exegetic arsenal? In short, the connotation of the visual exegesis of this sort of scene remains rather hazy. In some cases the author suggests that the schematic frame- work, or parts of it, has an autonomous significance. For example, Esmeijer regards the pictorial formula of the Ma- jestas Domini pages at the beginning of each of the four gospels in the Trier evangelistary, where the figure of Christ appears above a square with circular medallions at each corner contain- ing the symbols of the four evangelists, as a depiction of the exegetic quadriga, due to a certain similarity to "a bird's-eye view of a vehicle with four wheels" (p. 5 i). However plausible this interpretation may be, it is not a meaning which can be deduced directly from the quadripartite cosmic harmony schemata which may also form the basis of this composition. Here it is a question of a certain "figurative" treatment of such schemes. Another example of a geometrical pattern which may be independent and contain a meaning of its own is seen in Ca- rolingian Majestas Domini representations in which the figure of Christ appears in a double circle, as in the Codex Aureus of Lorsch (fig. 44). The double circle apparently stands for the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, in accor- dance with the exegesis of the rota in medio rotae (Ezekiel i :i6). The grounds for this assumption are found in a similar composition in a twelfth-century lectionary in the Musee Conde at Chantilly, where the two circles are inscribed "sub 73</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS lege" and "sub gratia" (fig. 45). The question here, of course, is whether the Carolingian miniaturist's geometrical pattern was intended as a pictorialization of the same exegetic idea. Although some compositions for visual exegesis very probably were derived from popular school schemata, I think that it is less certain that a meaning or meanings associated with those schemes persisted in every case. For instance the IN initial in the Bible of St. Hubert with its personifications of the four elements can rightly be associated with the schematically allied figura solida of Isidore. The fact that a similar scheme is found in other IN monograms points to a certain tradition. And yet, because the figurative staffage is generally of a more narrative kind, one wonders whether and to what extent the meaning of the elements scheme of the figura solida is still present, and how much of the associated meaning of the creation in pondere, numero et mensura is still involved. As regards the significance of school schemata for medieval art, I feel that Esmeijer's study pays too little attention to another important aspect. She cites examples of the integral or almost integral adoption of school schemes, together with their profane content, in another medium and another context (such as the elements scheme in the crypt of Anagni cathedral), but there are various other instances of such schemes embodying obviously Christian elements in the representations. They in- clude the Ewaldi-Decke in Cologne, and the Genesis tapestry in Gerona.9 The Annus side of the Ewaldi-Decke displays close similarities to the miniature in the Fuldense sacramentary in Gottingen, which Esmeijer describes and reproduces (fig. 6). She groups this miniature with a number of school schemata which were used for visual exegesis. As far as the actual rep- resentation is concerned, the school scheme is certainly para- mount. However, one can justifiably ask whether the new context in which this Annus scheme appears, as a miniature in a sacramentary, does not impart to the representation a new meaning or meanings dictated by that context. The same applies to the Ewaldi-Decke. Admittedly, we are not entirely sure of its original function, but it was very probably con- nected with the liturgy in some way. I think it is by no means impossible (and I hope to be publishing a few notes on this question in the near future) that these are instances of the use of school schemata in a Christian liturgical context on the basis of an interpretatio christiana of motifs which were originally profane. The Gerona Genesis tapestry is an ingenious in- tegration of a school scheme, cosmic data derived from it, and a Genesis cycle (further combined with a series of scenes detail- ing the discovery of the cross-a combination which has still 9 For the Ewaldi-Decke see exhib. cat. Rhein und Maas: Kunst und Kultur 80o-1400, Cologne 1972, nr. A 10, pp. 167-68. For the Genesis tapestry in not been explained satisfactorily). These and other examples might well suggest that Christian allegorization and the in- corporation of classical school wisdom in the world of Chris- tian representations was an important trend which influenced the geometrical system of many medieval works of art, and that it was responsible for the echoes of the subject matter of school schemata in those works. This slightly different viewpoint on the effects of schemata on medieval works of art and their meaning does not necessarily invalidate Esmeijer's assump- tions on this point, but it should be borne in mind in future research. However numerous the indications thatfigurae were valued as a didactic tool and that they were used for instruction in scriptural knowledge and interpretation, and no matter how clearly the four sensus of a particular biblical theme were in- cluded in certain single representations or programs, it should nevertheless be pointed out that there is hardly any explicit mention in the didactic literature (in both the narrow and slightly broader senses) of a multiple (four sensus) visual exe- getic function of the figurae. Only a few of the texts which Esmeijer studied on this point make any allusion to this. Two which do are the Speculum Virginum and the Zwiefalten lec- tionary. Moreover, representations and programs outside the strictly educational sphere are often liberally sprinkled with explan- atory inscriptions, but nowhere do those texts make any reference to the proposed method of visual exegesis. Esmeijer also considers the thorny question of typological compendia which might also have a visual exegetic basis. Research in this area has been relatively unfruitful, certainly for the period up to ca. 1200. Even after reading about Es- meijer's investigations one is forced to conclude that later compendia contain hardly any precepts expressed in terms of the expositio quadrifaria. Only the Pictor in carmine mentions multiple exegesis, but there the main emphasis is on repre- sentations which are typologically related. The third sensus is only mentioned occasionally, which may well have something to do with the fact that visual exegesis was past its prime by the end of the thirteenth century, when the Pictor was written. No compendia or comparable writings have yet been found from the heyday of visual exegesis which contain explicit statements supporting assumptions about the method and its applica- tions. Esmeijer proposes a systematic enquiry into possible con- tacts between centers and regions of visual exegetic activity, and into the part played by schools and religious orders in Gerona see, in particular, P. de Palol, "Une broderie catalane d'epoque romane: la Genese de Gerone," Cahiers Archeologiques 8 (1956), pp. 175-214, and 9 (I957), pp. 219-5i. 74</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS disseminating those ideas. Such an enquiry might well bring to light new facts on the "practice" of visual exegesis. I am unconvinced, however, by the author's suggestion that eleventh and twelfth-century works of art from the Meuse region, in particular, should be regarded as "visually exegetic" rather than "typological," which is how they have always been described up until now. Esmeijer unfortunately fails to test this group of works against her proposed method of visual exegesis. This is all the more to be deplored because these works, which are closely related in time and space, display features (as the author rightly recognizes) which might point to a systematic treatment of several interrelated exegetic mean- ings. In my view this is an ideal area for putting visual exegesis to further test. The miniatures in the Floreffe Bible, which Esmeijer also mentions in this context, would be an excellent point of departure, given the rich theological and exegetic content of the representations and the explanatory role of the inscriptions. An added advantage is that it would probably be possible to make a good reconstruction of the theological en- vironment in which this bible was executed, along with other works of art from the same period and region. The lack, or virtual lack, of any references to a multiple, visual exegetic function of representations in the appropriate didactic literature, in the inscriptions on relevant works of art, or in compendia which might be expected to have something to say on the subject, does not automatically mean that there was no tendency in the middle ages to devise representations and programs from exegetic and theological subject matter, and to incorporate in them one or more of the appropriate sensus. Several of the works of art which Esmeijer analyzes in this respect show clear evidence of such a tendency, notably the Paradise scenes in the Speculum Virginum and in the Laudes Sanctae Crucis (figs. 55a and b, 56a and b). The representations in both works rely heavily on the ac- companying text. Esmeijer, citing the many basic differences between the Paradise schemata in the two works, believes that the view that the Laudes derives from the Speculum is no longer tenable. The Paradise scheme in the Laudes not only differs from that in the Speculum as regards the composition and arrangement of the various quaternities, but also in its relation- ship with the miniatures immediately preceding and follow- ing: a crucifixion scene, a ladder scheme of the Homo totus, and a tree scheme with syndesmos ideogram and Ecclesia, all of which suggests a broader visual exegetic instruction than is the case in the Speculum Virginum. Each representation (and this is a very plausible argument) can be interpreted on four levels. They also form four paraphrases of the cross, each accenting one of the four sensus of the multiple cross exegesis: history- the crucifixion; anagoge-Christ as the judge of the world with the Paradise quaternity at his feet; tropology-Homo totus ascending the ladder; and allegory-the figure of Christ incorporating the cross as the image of recapitulatio at the end of time. The decorative programs grouped around the theme of "Hierusalem urbs quadrata" are to my mind less convincing as an expositio quadrifaria following the model of the appropriate exegesis. The heavenly city of Jerusalem is generally depicted in quadripartite vault paintings in funerary chapels. Analysis of various decorative programs employing this city quaternity, together with study of the context in which they originated, shows that these programs, which are generally complex and only comprehensible to the initiated, have to be "read" from the spot where the coffin lay during the funeral service, or from the final resting place of the deceased. It is from these locations that one surveys the heavenly city of Jerusalem. That is the case in S. Pietro in Monte near Civitate (fig. 64), St. Chef (fig. 67), Priifening (fig. 69), Matrei (Nikolauskirche) (fig. 74), and Schwarzrheindorf (fig. 73). The underlying concept in each case is of the soul's ascent to heavenly Jerusalem, the beata pacis visio. The scenes on the walls and other secondary ele- ments of the building indicate a sort of portal from which one sees the vision of heavenly bliss on the vault. The question posed by decorative programs of this nature is the extent to which one is meant to read the various sensus of the Jerusalem exegesis (history: the historical city of Jeru- salem, allegory: the civitas Dei or Ecclesia, tropology: Christ's place in man's soul, and anagoge: the future, heavenly city of Jerusalem). In practically every case, as the author rightly observes, the emphasis is on anagoge, the visio pacis of heav- enly Jerusalem. Nevertheless, Esmeijer believes that the other three sensus are "always more or less latently present." A fourfold interpretation is perfectly possible in the case of the urbs quadrata scene in Civitate, where the scene itself contains indicators pointing to such an interpretation, and given the context of the remainder of the program. However, the com- parable decorations in St. Michel d'Aiguilhe and St. Chef (figs. 65 and 67) contain far fewer elements which point to an expositio quadrifaria of the urbs quadrata. The emphasis in the decorations in southern Germany and Switzerland is clearly on anagoge, and there is little justification for perceiving any other sensus. Of course, it is perfectly conceivable that the artist or patron left open the possibility of a multiple interpretation, even when several sensus were not depicted. And even if that was not the intention, the viewer could still allow his thoughts to take an exegetic direction which went beyond the "literal" repre- sentation. These questions must necessarily remain moot where the contemporary literature is not explicit on the inten- tions of the artist and his patron and/or the attitude of the viewer. The same applies to the syndesmos figure in the anthropo- morphic schemata discussed by Esmeijer. In a number of the 75</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS examples cited, Christ encompasses the mappa mundi, or a cosmic harmony scheme. Here the syndesmos attitude can be interpreted as a cosmogonic gesture, referring to the harmony imposed on creation by the Creator. The syndesmos figure in a cruciform posture could refer to the re-establishment of order after it had been overthrown by sin. And finally, it could be a gesture of recapitulatio, the gathering of the faithful from the four corners of the earth at the end of time. For example, the late thirteenth-century manuscript of Thomas of Cantimpre's De naturis rerum in Munich contains two miniatures based on the anthropomorphic scheme (figs. 84a and b). In one, Adam Vetus is the central figure, and in the other it is Christ as Adam Novus. The latter scene, in which Christ embraces the mundus (scheme of elements and winds) in a syndesmos pose, can be regarded as a visual exegesis of the harmony of creation (his- tory), the power of the cross to restore harmony (allegory), and the recapitulatio (anagoge). The four cardinal virtues which have been added to the scene represent the tropological sense. The question that arises with these and similar scenes is how far such a system of meanings was intended, and how im- portant the meanings of the syndesmos figure are in relation to the other, more factual visual information provided by the scene. In cases such as the Ebstorf map (fig. 8oa), the enclosed mappa mundi dominates the marginal syndesmos ideogram to such an extent that one wonders how much importance should be attached to the possible visually exegetic function of that ideogram. This also applies to a group of miniatures where the syn- desmos figure incorporates a schematic arbor consanguinitatis. Esmeijer is the first scholar to provide a clear exposition of these schemes. There are other examples of such schemes which contain more than purely factual information about the degrees of blood relation, which were so important in canon law. A miniature in a manuscript of Isidore's Etymologiae in Munich (fig. 97) shows Adam Vetus as the bearer of the scheme. The representation and the accompanying text make it clear that the arbor consanguinitatis is being associated with the history of the human race within the framework of the history of salvation. Adam Vetus should be seen as type of Adam Novus. The succession of human generations is com- pared to the successive aetates of the history of salvation. The text advocates the imitation of Adam Novus, and the syn- desmos posture, given the ideas expressed in the text, refers to the recapitulatio at the end of time. These meanings can cer- tainly be classed on the separate levels of multiple exegesis, but the explanatory text is essential. In a wider sense, the association of the syndesmos figure with the scheme of the arbor consanguinitatis illustrates the idea of concordia discordantium. That concept, which is derived from musical theory and is also applied to the actual function of exegesis, is mainly associated exegetically with the creation, with the death on the cross, and with the recapitulatio. There is an intriguing scene which forms the introduction to Peter Lombard's commentary on the Psalms in a twelfth-century manuscript in Dublin (fig. Io6), in which David is shown as type of Christ, incorporating a schematic rendering of the psalterium decem chordarum. Esmeijer gives a highly detailed and meticulous analysis of all the exegetic meanings in this miniature-meanings which can indeed be classed according to the four sensus. However, without the detailed inscriptions there would be no way for either the contemporary or the modern viewer to decipher all the exegetic subtleties of the scene. To my mind this is not a direct case of visual exegesis. It is my belief that the term "visual exegesis" can lead to misunderstandings in the historiography of medieval art which has been discussed by other authors in the same or similar terms (see p. 31, and p. 137, note 5). In most cases the quali- fication amounts to little more than a general classification applied to representations whose content is more theological and exegetic than historical and narrational. As evidenced by the structure of her argument and its application to works of art, Esmeijer mainly applies the term to the fourfold nature of the exegesis, i.e. the pictorialization of the expositio quadri- faria. And yet, the limits for the use of the term in this sense are not entirely clear. For example, a miniature in a tenth-century Boethius manuscript in Selestat, which shows the personification of Philosophia derived from Boethius, is regarded as a visual exegetic scheme. Originally the rungs of the ladder on Philo- sophia's garment stood for the artes liberales, by which one ascended from the practica to the theoria of philosophy. In this particular case, though, they are identified by the inscriptions as the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost. The scene would then represent the idea of spiritual growth from vita activa to vita contemplativa and insight into true wisdom, the sapientia Dei. This is clearly an adaptation and interpretatio christiana of the ladder scheme, but to refer to it as visual exegesis, assuming that one wishes to restrict the term to "pictorialized" exegesis, is, I feel, not entirely appropriate. Furthermore, on various occasions the author speaks of visual exegesis where there are explicit or implicit grounds in one particular scene for "reading" the exegetic sensus around a single biblical theme, such as the representation of heavenly Jerusalem in S. Pietro in Monte (p. 79). Elsewhere she speaks of visual exegesis when the various components of a represen- tation or program can be arranged by levels of sensus without it being possible to relate those components clearly to a well- defined biblical or exegetic theme, as in the case of the de- corative program of the Chapel of All Saints in Regensburg (pp. 88-89; fig. 71). The applicability of the term "visual exegesis" is, of course, 76</page><page sequence="8">BOOK REVIEWS very closely tied to the existence or otherwise of a "method of visual exegesis," which is the central issue dealt with in Esmeijer's book. I feel that there are, as yet, insufficient grounds for speaking of a method of visual exegesis observing more or less strict rules analogous to those of written exegesis, which was ar- ranged according to three or four sensus. I agree with the author when she says that her carefully formulated hypothesis will "have to be subjected to further tests involving comparison with sources and art historical material from the periods dis- cussed" (p. xi). Esmeijer's study identifies many valuable areas which merit further art-historical research. As she herself points out, addi- tional basic research could expand this new approach to the history of medieval art. For example, it is desirable that there should be a systematic study of the origin, tradition and use of the various types of school schemata, both within educational practice and outside it. Another area for further research is the possible role played by scholarly centers, such as Regensburg, where there was a sophisticated approach to the relationship between word and image. It is here, I believe, that the book does its greatest service. Esmeijer set out to answer an impressive array of far-reaching and interrelated questions, and she displays considerable cre- ativity in putting forward possible solutions and making sug- gestions for further study. This book, with its wealth of new facts and insights, will be an indispensable guide for the time being for those who wish to extend the exploration of medieval art as "visual exegesis." Finally, a few remarks on Divina Quaternitas as a book. I think many people would agree with Ellen Kosmer's observation that Esmeijer has unfortunately failed to present her research findings in a clear and readable text.10 One's grasp of the often complex material is occasionally hindered by a tortuous pre- sentation of the argument. The relatively large proportion of typographical errors is anything but "ad ornamen[t]um" (p. 7) of the book. Origen, for example, is accorded an age which may be proportional to his importance for multiple exegesis, but which is still on the generous side, even for a church father: ca. I85-ca. 354 (p. I ). The rather mean dimensions of the illustrations place a very heavy demand on the sensitivity of the eye-a faculty which was valued so highly by many medieval authors.

Johannes Zahlten, Creatio Mundi: Darstellungen der sechs Schopfungstage und naturwissenschaftliches Weltbild im Mittelalter (Stuttgarter Beitrage zur Ge- schichte und Politik, vol. 13), Stuttgart (Klett-Cotta) I979.* With his decision to collate the largest possible number of medieval representations of the hexaemeron and to confront them with contemporary Genesis commentaries the better to elucidate the prevailing scientific cosmology, Zahlten has taken a path that would not have suited everybody. In par- ticular, it demands familiarity (which is not readily obtained from available anthologies) with the history of medieval thought and an ability, if not to master all the cognate disci- plines, at least to deal with them expertly one at a time. This task also calls for perseverance in the search for relevant works of art and in the ensuing correspondence with the appropriate administrative departments, whose bureaucratic gods tend increasingly to place administrative sweat before successful research. Finally, the collated material must be easily retriev- able under various headings, that is, sensibly classified. The demand made by J. van der Meulen in his pioneering article "Schipfer, Schipfung" (Creator, Creation)1, namely that the interpretation of the medieval exegesis of Genesis be based on a comprehensive study of representations of the Creation, most of which are found in illuminated manuscripts, has been met by Zahlten with admirable consistency and applied to a previously neglected or, at least, far less trenchant formulation of the problem in hand. Zahlten directs our attention to the medieval view of nature and of its manifes- tations, and treats this amalgam of theological arguments, tra- ditional intellectual schemata, everyday experiences and the quest for scientific understanding as an essential part of the *Review translated from the German by Arnold Pomerans. i E.
