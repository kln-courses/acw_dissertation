Space restrictions require that I be selective in assessing his work. I shall concentrate on three interrelated facets: Veblen's status in eco- nomics, his conception of the economy and his role in démystification. Perhaps this last is the central theme- its challenge to orthodoxy, its role in social science and the conditions of its use. John Diggins (1978a, b) is exceedingly perceptive in focusing on the role attributed by Veblen to status emulation in the legitimation and reinforcement of power and the hegemony of established institutions and systems. This is Veblen's central thrust: the humanmade and con- tingent nature of society, power, démystification and dereification. These themes suggest much about the reception and modern treatment given Veblen and the possible uses of his work. They may constitute the heart of Veblen's contribution to social science. Veblen's conception of the economic system was not devoid of meth- odological individualism, but it was principally methodologically col- lectivism He studied individual behavior (for example, conspicuous con- sumption), but he was more interested in seeking knowledge in terms of group processes, problems, forces and phenomena. Veblen's analysis was marked by holism, evolutionism, conflict and power. He was inter- ested in the economy as something much more than the market per se. It was to be viewed as a whole - all the factors and forces (and their evolutionary origins, to be sure) which govern, in part through individ- ual choice, economic performance. He was interested in the evolution of humans, human beliefs and behavior, institutions and the system. Mean- ingfulness to Veblen was in part rendered by knowledge of being and the concatenation of forces at a point in time (statics), but it was in larger part rendered by knowledge of becoming and the interplay of 1 1 wish to express my indebtedness and gratitude to Paul Strassmann for many conversations concerning Veblen and institutional economics, and to Elizabeth John- ston and him for comments on an earlier draft.

Society, including polity and economy, is largely produced by those forces. In this connection Vehlen stressed the anthropomorphic origins and continuities and the anthropological characteristics of the "modern" economy; he emphasized the historical if not archaic bases of contem- porary power relations (Diggins, 1978b: 154), however much the modern economy also evidences the cultural incidence of the machine process. There is thus a complex interplay and tension between the forces of ideology, ceremony and institutions, on the one hand, and the drive of technology and industrialization, on the other. Veblen was a theorist of conflict, not of consensus or harmony (Diggins, 1978a: 228-29). History is a progression of conflicts over continuity versus change. Change is Darwinian, open-ended and evolutionary in comparison, for example, with the Marxian conception. Similarly, Veblen's analysis of power was more akin to Weber's than to Marx's. Instead of a regime of exploitation (or of equilibrium distribution of marginal products), Veblen, as did Weber, basically envisioned a generalized contest over output or income. But Veblen shared with Marx and Weber a tripartite conception of the economy as formed by (1) power structure, (2) belief system and (3) allocative mechanism. With them, Veblen, and for that matter Pareto, among others, penetrated to the question of power. As did they, he saw, for example, (1) the market "mechanism" as giving effect to the power structure (the real allocative mechanism is the power structure formed by institutions), (2) market phenomena and performance as expressions - sometimes symbolic - of power and ( 3 ) the use of government for status and economic ends, however masked by ideology. Veblen has not been, to put it mildly, fully appreciated by modern economists for reasons that stem from the man himself and the rather different interests of modern orthodoxy. To mainstream economists, Veb- len's work is considered largely not economics (and otherwise often mis- guided if not incorrect). They have a different conception of the central problem of economics and have been mesmerized by technique. They often work with hypothetical utility functions and seek maximizing equi- librium solutions assuming given preferences and other static conditions. Moreover, Veblen was an easy target for his critics: he often was hostile and perverse, and typically remote and withdrawn. His positive side was often obscured and he appealed to those who liked his satire and who were critics of the system. He also was deemed unsafe by those who learned enough to see how deeply Veblen revealed the tenuous condi- tion or foundations of modern society. The subsequent rise of constrained maximization economics would have been to Veblen a demonstration of economics' ceremonial adequacy and service as ideology as well as a pointer to its cultural origins. He would have viewed this economics as part of the status emulation system, an opinion which inevitably would</page><page sequence="3">456 Social Science Quarterly sit uncomfortably with orthodox practitioners of the discipline. Econom- ics as the ideology of the dominant economic system could not blend with Vehlens demythicizing, and economics as formalist technique in maximization analysis could not blend with Veblen's conception of the economy as an evolving cultural whole marked, for example, by power, conflict and, inter alia , status deprivation. Veblen was the consummate heterodox thinker. He was not a member of the dominant sect or school, and he did not take as given, work within or give unexamined expression to the self-images of his society. The former is obvious; the latter is so important an aspect as to consti- tute, along with the depth and importance of his subject matter and analysis, the key to his perennial significance. (The two are quite related; see below.) For Veblen, orthodoxy, as both explanation and rationaliza- tion of the existing system, necessarily involved the reification of the symbols with which the society understood itself; conversely, his ap- proach to understanding - his heterodoxy - required démystification. In a sense, Veblen was principally a student of ideology, and a most pro- found one indeed. As Allen (1978:32) has said in a review of Diggins's book, Veblen, as did Marx, Nietzsche and Freud (as well as, I might add, Pareto), "saw the history of mankind as the history of self -deceiving ideology." Moreover, Veblen recognized that ideology is the greatest barrier to the objective, scientific study of man and society. This is an insight not typically or readily accepted by any orthodoxy (which sees its own belief system, or ideology, as Truth). It is a view more often held by the heterodox (and, as Pareto stressed, is found in the minds of the manipulators of ideas, power and people). Veblens self-anointed role, one which stands for the ages, was to de- mystify and dereify, to reveal the hypocrisy of order. He refused to accept and interpret the system on its own terms. He felt the need to penetrate the veil of its ideology. He raised fundamental questions - such as whose morals, whose manner and whose power - and argued the humanmade and contingent status of the answers given by the status quo in any society. As for economics as knowledge (it also being social control and psychic balm), Veblen argued, as Diggins (1978b: 152) stresses, that the price system (rather, the idea of a price system) was but one fetish of capitalist ideology. He thereby questioned in still an- other way the meaningfulness of the idea of the allocative role of the market. Without elaborating a point which is well known and amply discussed by Diggins throughout his book, I would mention that Veblen's attitude toward society was one of great distance, perhaps to the point of aliena- tion. ( Distance is distinguished here from alienation; Diggins does not so differentiate.) This raises the important question of how necessary dis- tance is, as a functional nihilism, or a social agnosticism, in order to do two things. The first is to penetrate the veils of society, polity and econ-</page><page sequence="4">THORSTEIN VEBLEN, HETERODOX ECONOMIST, IN RETROSPECT 457 omy to learn what really is going on.2 The second is to escape the status emulation (reward and incentive) processes of both one's larger society and one's professional discipline (as a functioning part of the larger society). Diggins (1978a: 232), indeed, concludes his book with this query: "Must we analyze the sources of his 'discontent,' or should we accept his alienation as the necessary condition of consciousness in the act of per- ception. 'The world owes its onward impulses," advised Nathaniel Haw- thorne, 'to men ill at ease.' " The question applies not solely to Veblen. It may point, and not only logically, to a fundamental condition of in- tellectual advance; that is, the greater the depth and range of the emo- tional distance, the greater the potential productivity of heterodox anal- ysis. This is likely to be true independent of which body of knowledge is "correct," for one era's or society's orthodoxy may be another's hetero- doxy. The functional role of démystification founded upon intellectual and emotional distance leads us to two ironies. First, the seemingly greater facility for démystification in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries may be a product of the bourgeois world view. Diggins (1978a: 227) aptly qoutes Bell's characterization of this world view as being, in part, "ratio- nalistic, matter-of-fact, pragmatic; neither magical, mystical, nor roman- tic." Capitalism, as Schumpeter also recognized, thus has been the source of its own critique. Second, Bell's characterization rather easily applies to Veblen himself, for example, his emphasis on the matter-of-fact mode of reasoning. May Veblen not be considered a child of the system, or a vehicle, as it were, of the system's own world view turned on itself? Thees ironies lead me to consider the obvious (and not so obvious) and instructive tensions within Veblen's analytical system. Understand- ing these is, I think, critical to the comprehension and application of Veblen's work a half century after his death. First, there is in both society and Veblen's analysis of it a fundamental tension between tech- nological change and power structure. Both govern societal performance, that is, the determination of whose interests are going to count. Techno- logical change has imperative aspects, but concentrated power is able to choose between extant technological alternatives. Second, Veblen's analysis clearly posited evolution and change. But it also emphasized atavistic continuity: Modern society has roots in and is but an extension of ancient culture.3 The present is based upon and, 2 Penetration ( or attempted penetration ) of the veils of society always has atten- dant threats to order, as order is currently perceived: To inquire into deep things is to open them to question and doubt and make them susceptible to change; thus a defensive response to people like Veblen is not unexpected. 3 In Veblen s writings capitalism does not so much break with the past as con- tinue, in modified form, feudal status relations and barbarian survivals of prowess and esteem. From this perspective the market economy did not so much 'tame the passions' of glory and power as rechannel them." Diggins, 1978b, p. 152.</page><page sequence="5">458 Social Science Quarterly indeed, is a continuation of its archaic past at the same time that it undergoes modification, for example, through the discipline of the ma- chine process or industrialization. Veblen's Darwinian open-ended evo- lution is constrained by the barbaric past. There is both change and continuity. In relation to this tension I would note two further points. First, Veb- lens satire should be viewed in the light of his role as démystifier (as well as in respect to his personality and professional status anxieties). Second, Veblens positive analysis should be appreciated on its own terms, notwithstanding the absence from it of some "vision or ideal that transcends the immediate present" and his emphasis on "the Darwinian idea of endless change and struggle" (Diggins, 1978b: 141, 138). Veblen, much more than Marx, and more like Weber (and Pareto), was inter- ested in knowing what is going on in society wtihout using architectonic and prefiguring metaphysical systems of history and ethics. (This is not to say that there is no ideological element in Veblen s work.) Third, Veblen, having accomplished at least some démystification (the unclothing of the emperor), was faced with the problem of what to rec- ommend. If I understand one possible variant of professionalism, it is not necessary for the positive analyst to reach recommendatory conclu- sions, especially if the analyst is interested (as a scientist) solely in understanding what is going on and/ or finds that the reality of normative decision making is "Darwinian," that is, a composite of choice, random changes and interactions as well as "natural selection." In the latter case, there is the further tension between one's understanding and appreci- ation of the normative element in society and one's inescapable choice predicament. It may be too much to seek policy recommendations from Veblen and, especially, to evaluate his positive analysis according to them. Let me state the following in conclusion. First, the meaningfulness of Veblens ideas and analysis must be self-consciously comprehended in terms of both strength and weakness as his work is measured by us by our criteria. Second, we should recognize, as does Diggins (1978a: 213-26), that the cyclical attractiveness of Veblen's work is a function of the orientation of our times, specifically, its consensus-harmony or conflict mood. Veb- len's demythicizing becomes attractive during periods of dissent from and rebellion against established modes of thought. Third, Veblen's economics, as I see it, is a supplement to, not a substi- tute for, resource allocation economics. Although Veblenian institutional and neoclassical economics are rivals in terms of how long a chain of analysis is required to explain specific allocations, among other things, they most fundamentally focus on different central problems. Institution- alists consider the organization and control, and evolution, of the eco- nomic system as including more than the market (with a special em-</page><page sequence="6">THORSTEIN VEBLEN, HETERODOX ECONOMIST, IN RETROSPECT 459 phasis on power structure), v/hereas neoclassicists focus on resource allocation through constrained maximization behavior in markets. Vehlen did not call for an "alienated economics." Economics can and to some extent does include the central problems of both neoclassical and insti- tutional economics. In addition, Veblens career does call for a (presum- ably diverse) body of critical theory, one that does not accept the sta- bility and continuity of institutions and values and their propriety and functional character (Diggins 1978a:225 and passim), that is, one that does not interpret the system on its own terms but with whatever démys- tification seems necessary. (In law and jurisprudence the same function has been performed by legal realism and, more recently, the Conference on Critical Legal Studies.) Fourth, one should carefully differentiate between individual pathol- ogy and social reality in evaluating ideas (Diggins, 1978a: 223 and pas- sim). Reality is too recondite and ideology too persuasive to discard or denigrate analysis on the basis of the analyst's personal idiosyncracies (which Veblen had in abundance). Fifth, Darwinian evolution (including cumulative causation) is a rather sensible framework for a positive evolutionary economics. Sixth, there has been too much reiteration and rehearsal of Veblens ideas as a finished product, and too little amplification, extension, revi- sion and application. Myrdal and Galbraith have been too much alone as innovators. Veblens is a powerful approach to social science, and its further use would likely be enlightening. No greater tribute could be paid to Thorstein Veblen than to use his analysis and perspective. He long has been looking over the shoulders of all economists, reminding them of evolutionism, holism and the operation of fundamental institu- tional and technological factors in producing economic performance. Orthodox economists largely have neglected these considerations, but heterodox-institutionalist economists largely have failed to develop and extend Veblen's analysis. Perhaps the younger generation of Veblenians, many of them students of Ayres's students, will correct this dismal rec- ord. As Diggins (1978a: 232) says, Veblen "gave us the ideas and in- sights with which we now know better the subtle cultural forces, social pressures, and power realities of modern industrial society." But there is more to learn and know. REFERENCES Allen, James Sloan. 1978. Book Review. New Republic , April 1: 30-31. Diggins, John P. 1978a.
