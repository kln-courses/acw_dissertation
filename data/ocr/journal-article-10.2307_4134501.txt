<plain_text><page sequence="1">The human being is this night, this empty nothing, that contains everything in its simplicity-an unending wealth of many representation, images, of which none belongs to him-or which are not present. This night, this interior of nature, that exists here-pure self-in phantasmagorical represen- tations, is night all around it, in which here shoots a bloody head-there another white ghastly apparition, suddenly here before it, and just so disappears. One catches sight of this night when one looks human beings in the eye-into a night that becomes awful. -G. W F. Hegel, "Jenaer Realphilosophie" In his "Critical Dictionary" entry on the "Eye" in the September 1929 issue of Documents Georges Bataille notes the seductive quality of the eye, only to add that "extreme seduction is probably at the limit of horror."' As an example of such horror, he cites the eye-slitting scene from Luis Bufiuel and Salvador Dali's recently completed film, Un Chien andalou: In this respect, the eye could be related to the cutting edge, whose appearance provokes both bitter and contradictory reactions; this is what the makers of Un Chien andalou must have hideously and obscurely experienced when, among the first images of the film, they determined the bloody loves of these two beings. That a razor would cut open the dazzling eye of a young and charming woman-this is precisely what a young man would have admired to the point of madness [deraison], a young man watched by a small, sleeping cat, a young man who by chance holding in his hand a coffee spoon, suddenly wanted to take an eye in that spoon.2 Bataille, of course, shared the Surrealists' fascination with the eye, but what is interesting here is the ambiva- lence he identifies in the eye-the proximity of seduc- tion to horror-and its relation to the image. Indeed, this passage could easily pass as an example of Surreal- ism that transposes the shock of the lacerated eye from Un Chien andalou to the image of a spoon enucleating an eye. The proximity of seduction to horror is also evident in the illustrations that accompanied this entry: for instance, Bataille juxtaposes an engraving by J.-J. Grandville, First Dream: Crime and Atonement (1847), with a photograph of the Hollywood starlet Janet Flynn. The juxtaposition of these images recalls the eye-slitting scene in Un Chien andalou, particularly the episode in the lower left corner of Grandville's etching, where the eye approaches a collapsing column. Bataille's discussion of the eye seems to allude to an element of abyssal negativity that not only transforms the seductive look into the threatening gaze, but provokes acts of unprecedented violence-violence also evident in the illustration of the sensational magazine L'CEil de la police (The Eye of the Police) and Dali's Blood Is Sweeter than Honey. Despite his aversion to idealist philosophy, there is a distinctly Hegelian aspect to Bataille's discussion of the eye, particularly what Hegel called the "night of the world"-a night glimpsed "when one looks human beings in the eye."3 Slavoj 2izek, in a discussion of the phenomenological tradition from Immanuel Kant to Martin Heidegger, has recently addressed this aspect in a fasci- nating account of the deadlock of the transcendental imagination, "the abyss of radical subjectivity announced in the Kantian transcendental imagination."4 2i ek Raymond Spiteri Envisioning Surrealism in Histoire de I'ceil and La femme 100 totes I would like to thank Alyce Mahon for the oppor- tunity to present an earlier version of this paper at Body and Soul 2000, the annual conference of the Association of Art Historians in Edinburgh in April 2000, and Robert Lubar for inviting me to present it at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York.

Whereas traditional accounts describe the imagination as an agency that either passively receives images from the senses or actively posits images, the transcen- dental imagination cannot be located fully within this structure: it is both active and passive. These two aspects are present in Kant's phenomenology, which nonetheless places the accent on the imagination's power of synthesis, the three-step passage from the diversity of pure intuition to conceptual cognition through the synthetic power of the imagination. However, for Zilek, "Kant's notion of imagination silently passes over a crucial 'negative' feature": that is, "imagination qua the 'activity of dissolution.' " Kant downplays the imagination's destructive potential to focus on its constructive, synthetic power. Hegel, by con- trast, acknowledges the violence of the primordial "presynthetic imagination," which contains a negative, disruptive feature that gives it the power to dismem- ber immediate perception into a series of partial objects. At any moment the imagination may open onto an experience of abyssal negativity that would dissolve the ontological consistency of the world into a series of spectral images: as Hegel notes, "here shoots a bloody head-there another white ghastly apparition." 6 WINTER 2004</page><page sequence="4">Page from Georges Bataille, Documents I, no. 4 (September 1929), 217: L'CEil de la police and Salvador Dali, Blood Is Sweeter than Honey, 1927.? 2004 Salvador Dali, Gala-Salvador Dali Foundation/Artists Rights Society (ARS), NewYork. e Crime d'une Brut pu~- -- L'(Eil i d la Police, pages de la couverture en coulurs. -- 1908.

What do these questions have to do with Surrealism, a movement that seems far removed from the ontological subtleties of Kant or Hegel? The connec- tion is found in Surrealism's valorization of the imagination.5 The primordial "activity of dissolution" of the presynthetic imagination is operative in Surreal- ism, not only in the so-called dissident Surrealism commonly associated with Bataille, but also, albeit to a lesser degree, in the practice of orthodox Surrealists associated with Andre Breton. To demonstrate this point I will discuss two works: Max Ernst's collage-cycle La femme ioo tetes (The Hundred-Headless Woman) and Georges Bataille's erotic narrative Histoire de l'ceil (The Story of the Eye).' Immediately, it will appear that I have selected examples of so-called "orthodox" and "dissident" Surrealism, inevitably recalling the Breton-Bataille polemic that has assumed a pivotal role in recent accounts of Surrealism.7 However, my intention here is not to rehearse arguments about Bataille's materialism and Breton's idealism, the uncanny, or the role of the informe; rather, I want to focus on the deadlock of the 2.

Bataille adds in a footnote: "This film can be distinguished from banal avant-garde productions, with which one might be tempted to confuse it, in that the screen- play predominates. Several very explicit facts appear in successive order, without logical con- nection it is true, but penetrating so far into hor- ror that the spectators are caught up as directly as they are in adventure films. Caught up and even precisely caught by the throat, and without artifice; do these spectators know, in fact, where they-the authors of this film, or people like them-will stop? If Bufiuel himself, after the film- ing of the slit-open eye, remained sick for a week ... how then can one not see to what extent horror becomes fascinating, and how it alone is brutal enough to break everything that stifles?"

Georges Bataille originally published The Story of the Eye in 1928 under the pseudo- nym Lord Auch in a limited edition of 134 copies, with eight lithographic illus- trations by Andre Masson. The first-person narrative recounts the lugubrious erotic adventures of two adolescents-Simone and the unnamed male narrator- and their erotic obsession with a series of pale globular objects: a saucer of milk, eggs, bull's testes, and the eye.9 The narrative is broadly divided into two sec- tions: the first section, set on the Normandy coast, culminates with the death of Marcelle, a young friend of Simone and the narrator. The narrative opposes the impure and debauched Simone to Marcelle's innocence and piety, qualities that are corrupted through contact with Simone's and the narrator's anarchic desire: Marcelle is first interned in an asylum, then driven to suicide after becoming entwined in Simone's and the narrator's erotic obsessions. The second section takes place in Spain, where Simone and the narrator flee after Marcelle's death, aided by Sir Edmund, an English libertine. After a bullfight in which the famous toreador Granero is fatally wounded, his right eye enucleated by the bull's horn, the narrative culminates in a violent orgy in a Spanish church: here the male nar- rator, Simone, and Sir Edmund kidnap, rape, and murder a priest.Yet these events are merely the pretext for the notorious final tableau: not yet satiated, Simone demands the eye of the unfortunate priest, which Sir Edmund calmly excises and presents to her; the narrator then forcefully copulates with Simone while Sir Edmund rolls the eyeball between their bodies: Simone finally left me, grabbed the beautiful eyeball from the hands of the tall Englishman, and with a steady and regular pressure from her hands, she slid it into her slavering flesh, in the midst of the fur. And then she promptly drew me over, clutching my neck between her arms and smashing her lips on mine so forcefully that I climaxed without touching her and my come [foutre] spat all over her fur. Rising to my feet, I spread Simone's thighs so that she lay stretched on her side; I then found myself before what-I imagine-I had always been waiting for, as the guillotine awaits a neck to slice. My eyes, it seemed, were standing erect from horror; I saw in Simone's hairy vagina, the pale blue eye of Marcelle, watching me, weeping tears of urine. Threads of fuck in the steaming fur managed to give this lunar vision a final character of disastrous sorrow. I held Simone's thighs open and burning urine streamed out from beneath the eye, falling on the lower thigh ... " It is difficult to know what to make of this scene, which seems to confound the conventional Freudian narrative of fetishism and sexual difference. " It repre- sents the culmination of the accelerating violence of the preceding narrative, staging an encounter with the real, the flesh from which all life originates, by 8. The Breton-Bataille polemic is conventionally interpreted on a theoretical level as a conflict between Breton's idealism and Bataille's "base" materialism; I would suggest, however, that the polemic needs to be understood on a sociological level, in which the principal cause was less theo- retical differences than Breton's and Bataille's proximity within the cultural avant-garde. This strategy would allow a more nuanced reading of the polemic. 9.

In the accompanying illustration, Masson has restaged the scene to focus the beholder's attention on Marcelle's eye. He depicts the baroque interior of the church with four figures (Simone, the narrator, Sir Edmund, and the dead priest); the recumbent Simone is flanked by the standing figures of Sir Edmund and the narrator, who lean back in spasms of ecstasy so that their heads are cropped at the eye; the only full head that appears in the image is that of the dead priest, a thin stream of blood flowing from his empty eye-socket, while the only eye that appears is that of the priest, relocated to Simone's vagina, now animated by the memory of Marcelle. The stream of urine that flows from Marcelle's eye, which echoes the emissions of Sir Edmund and the priest, emphasizes the phallic character of the eye motif. Yet there is also something reticent about the eye's phallicism; whereas the phallicism associated with the male characters is highly visible and localized in the central third of the compo- sition, thus emphasizing the horizontal axis of the composition, Simone's phal- lus is reduced to the oval of an eye. Perhaps the best way to describe this effect is as an instance of anamorphosis, in which the (male) beholder misperceives the size of Simone's phallus because of his position directly in front of the scene; yet, equally, this eye "ejaculates" when the beholder acknowledges its gaze. It could be argued that Bataille's conflation of eye and female genitals is the con- summate operation of the informe, but this operation does not escape a certain economy of meaning.'3 To establish this point I want to introduce an image from Ernst's The Hundred-Headless Woman: Germinal, my sister, the hundred-headless woman. (In the background, in the cage, the Eternal Father). There is a subtle parallel between this image and the final tableau in The Story of the Eye: the figure plays with the eye of a head, placed in her lap over her genitals. Now, admittedly, there is a striking difference between the two images, but both establish an equation between the eye, castra- tion, and the female genitals, a logic reinforced by the figure's exposed breast in Ernst's image. A comparison with Masson's illustration also reveals opposed com- positional strategies. Whereas Ernst's collage is structured around the central fig- ure of Germinal, who occupies a large proportion of the composition and looks out at the beholder, Masson's illustration is structured around a central void, with the figures pushed out toward the edges of the composition. Masson depicts the scene as a play of mechanical forces, seeking to render the event in its actuality, while Ernst relies on a psychological reading of the figure as a malevolent girl-child. At this point it would be easy to object that, rather than establishing any affinity between Bataille and Ernst, this comparison merely reinforces the dis- tance between their respective positions. ~ For is not Ernst's collage an example of the type of poetic transposition that substitutes the idea for material reality that Bataille would criticize in Surrealism? Had not Bataille called for "a direct and explicit questioning of seductiveness, without taking into account poetic con- coctions that are, ultimately, nothing but a diversion," and stated: "A return to reality does not imply any new acceptances, but means that one is seduced in a base manner, without transpositions and to the point of screaming"?I Even if this point is conceded, what is interesting here is the degree to which The Story of 12.

To illustrate this point it would help to draw out some features of the final tableau in The Story of the Eye, particularly its perverse reworking of the Freudian scenario of castration anxiety and fetishism. According to Freud, the basis of a fetish lay in the disavowal of castration: "The fetish is a substitute for the woman's (the mother's) penis that the little boy once believed in and ... does not want to give up."'6 Bataille's tableau reworks three aspects of this definition: i. Simone first demands the priest's eye, in effect symbolically "castrating" the priest's corpse; then she literally substitutes this phallus for the narrator's penis. If her desire is related to castration, it is a desire for the severed organ, detached from the order of nature; that is, her desire is expressed on the symbolic level. ii. Whereas the goal of fetishism is to disavow the absence of the maternal phallus, here the narrator witnesses the return of this phallus. However, this return is as traumatic as its initial absence. This trauma is registered in a peculiar way: what the narrator sees lodged in Simone's vagina is not any eye, and certainly not the eye of the priest-but rather Marcelle's eye. Indeed, the imagination intervenes at this precise moment, transforming the dead eye of the priest into Marcelle's living eye. iii. This scene also contravenes another convention of the text. On the first page, the narrator signals his preference for the word cul (arse) to describe Simone's genitals: "le plus joli des noms du sexe."'7 Cul represents an infan- tile confusion between vagina and anus, a confusion absent from the more explicitly gendered con (cunt). 8 Like the fetish, cul disavows sexual differ- ence.Yet in the scene of Marcelle's eye the narrator substitutes the descrip- tive term vagin (vagina) for cul. What Bataille stages here is precisely the deadlock of the imagination. The eye functions as a speculum that not only holds open the abyss of the visceral flesh of the preontological void, but simultaneously returns Marcelle's gaze. The imagination does not simply intervene at the point where the visceral truth of feminine jouissance is about to be unveiled, but it is precisely this intervention that preserves the fantasy of feminine jouissance. Marcelle's eye exists for the narrator; it is how the maternal phallus-if this is what it is-appears to him, not for Simone (for whom it does not appear but is experienced on a tactile level). Indeed, the narrator knows nothing of Simone's jouissance, which remains as opaque as a dead priest's eye.'9 Here Bataille stages the proximity of seduction and horror: the horror of the gaze returned by the eye in Simone's vagina, and the seduction of that gaze being identified with Marcelle's subjectivity. In 1929 Ernst published The Hundred-Headless Woman, the first of three "collage-nov- els" he would complete during 1929-33. Like The Story of the Eye, the "narrative" of The Hundred-HeadlessWoman revolves around the circulation of a series of circular objects like eggs, eyes, spheres, and wheels.20 Images of blindness and symbolic castration also abound in The Hundred-Headless Woman, but for Ernst they are related 16. Sigmund Freud, "Fetishism," 152-53. 17. Bataille, Histoire de I'oeil, 13. 18. The English translation renders cul as "cunt" rather than "arse," thus sacrificing this aspect of the French text. 19. Is this not the significance of Marcelle's eye, since when Marcelle succumbed to herjouissance, she rapidly descended into madness and suicide? 20. Ernst not only used repetition to confer a degree of unity to the cycle, but the eye-motif lay at the very heart of Lo femme 100 t6tes, its spherical shape the nexus of an extended chain of metaphors. The motif of the eye appears in the globe in Crime ou miracle: un homme complet (pl. I), the masked face in L'immacul6e conception (pl. 12), the globe-fant6me (pl. 72, 75, and 76), the spherical object ( pl. 108), and the eggs (pl. 132 and 133). This list is by no means comprehensive. On the role of circular objects in The Story of the Eye see Barthes, "The Metaphor of the Eye." 12 WINTER 2004</page><page sequence="10">Max Ernst.

Seven of the chapter's eighteen plates were based on the theme of "She keeps her secret," which revolves around images of physical blindness and poetic insight.2' The plate The eye without eyes, the hundred-headless woman keeps her secret establishes the basic topos: a female figure places her outstretched hand over the eye of a male figure, who is flanked by a child and animals. This basic motif is repeated against different backgrounds in subsequent plates: an egg floating on the ocean, a nat- ural landscape, and a bedroom, suggesting different historical periods. The ges- ture of enucleation, which first appeared in Germinal, my sister, the hundred-headless woman, represents an obvious allusion to castration anxiety; yet this anxiety plays an ambivalent role in the collage cycle. One difficulty with The Hundred-Headless Woman is related to the role of ambiguity 21. This is a recurring theme in Ernst's work; see, for instance, Les hommes n'en sauront rien (1923). See Elizabeth M. Legge, Max Ernst: The Psychoanalytical Sources (Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 1989), and M. E.

Ernst carefully constructed the cycle of images to frustrate interpre- tation-what Breton called the "will towards complete disorientation" in the book's preface-so that the act of interpretation would continue the process of creation.22 An example of this strategy is evident in The eye without eyes, the hundred- headless woman and Loplop return to the savage state and cover [recouvrent] the eyes of their faithful birds with fresh leaves, which provides an important clue to the significance of the "She keeps her secret" theme. This plate depicts a male and a female figure surrounded by several gigantic birds, against a backdrop of lush vegetation. The plate repeats the enucleation gesture of the previous plates, yet reverses the gender of the protagonist: the female figure languidly rests amid the vegetation, while the male figure, whose head has assumed simian features, averts his eyes as he extends one hand toward the bird's eye, and places his other hand in the bird's open beak. Although both these gestures recall the threat of castration, the title provides the key to the image, particularly the double meaning of the verb recouvrent, which is the third person plural of both recouvrir (to cover) and recouvrer (to regain).23 Thus, in the first case the title would read: "The hundred-headless woman and Loplop return to the savage state and cover the eyes of their faithful birds with fresh leaves"; in the second case it would read: "The hundred-headless woman and Loplop return to the savage state and regain the eyes of their faithful birds from the fresh leaves." The eye-motif in The Hundred-Headless Woman functions as an image of both revelation and concealment, vision and blindness. If the blinding of an eye is interpreted in a strict Freudian sense in terms of symbolic castration and sexual difference, then the image establishes an equation between vision and the phal- lus, on the one hand, and blindness and the absent phallus, on the other hand.24 Thus the first interpretation suggests a scene of castration and blindness: the figure's gesture is one of enucleation, the bird is about to bite his hand, and the title suggests that he covers the bird's eye with leaves.Yet this oedipal gaze is itself a form of blindness that drains the world of mystery and enigma, reducing it to an object of rational knowledge. The second interpretation suggests a scene of poetic revelation: in this context the male figure recovers the bird's eye from the leaves, in effect restoring sight to the blind.2s This interpretation not only suspends the Freudian allusions to castration, but suggests the existence of other forms of knowledge capable of challenging the proportion and ratio of bour- geois culture.26 A number of themes in The Hundred-Headless Woman converge in the following plate, again entitled The eye without eyes, the hundred-headless woman keeps her secret, which depicts a female figure with a large eye in her abdomen looking at an ambigu- ous, anthropomorphic form set in an industrial environment. The workers in the background carry out their labors oblivious to the foreground, where the female figure contemplates an anthropomorphic form, placing her hand over its head in a repetition of the enucleation gesture. Yet this figure lacks eyes; it is simply an inchoate texture almost devoid of human physiognomy. Once again the signifi- cance of the anthropomorphic figure is ambivalent: on one hand it may have been blinded and transformed into stone; on the other hand, its evocative texture recalls Ernst's frottages, suggesting another site of poetic revelation.27 Furthermore, the association of the eye with the woman's abdomen conflates eye and womb, suggesting the matrix of the female body as the site of poetic revelation, a theme 14 WINTER 2004 22.

Ernst has collaged a beaklike protuberance on the left-hand corner of the eye, so that the eye motif also suggests the figure of a bird emerging from the woman's skirt, like the famous vulture hidden in folds of drapery in Leonardo's Madonna and Child with St.Anne discussed by Freud.28 Ernst had earlier alluded to this vulture in the paint- ing The Virgin Mary Punishing the Infant Jesus before Three Witnesses (AB, PE, and the Painter).29 Indeed, in this context the collage exemplifies Ernst's description of the mecha- nism of collage: by grafting the eye-motif onto the woman's figure, Ernst pro- duces a "fortuitous meeting" between these elements: woman and eye engage in a "pure act like that of love," which engenders the bird.30 The sexual character of the image is highlighted by the nude female figure swinging from the rafters, who approaches the bird's phallic beak. 28.

Although it is easy to characterize Ernst's use of collage as an example of poetic transposition and contrast it with the uncompro- mising character of Bataille's writing, to do so would sacrifice what is truly radi- cal in the travail of the image in Surrealism. The key to a profound reading of both the The Story of the Eye and The Hundred-Headless Woman is to recognize the eye as an image of the imagination in its disruptive and constructive aspects, of seduc- tion and horror. The eye is a highly charged object, and the beholder experiences assaults against it viscerally-something readily evident to any spectator of Un Chien andalou. In Surrealism, however, it functions as a veil over the preontological realm of part-objects, the Hegelian "night of the world." Any attempt to rend this veil only results in blindness and castration; yet as a veil the eye also acts as a screen upon which fantasies can be projected, as in the example of Marcelle's eye in The Story of the Eye or in the final chapter of The Hundred-Headless Woman. Bataille would repeatedly attempt to take the impossible step beyond con- ceptual thought to disclose the mechanism behind symbolization, the place where the image emerges from the abyss of nothingness.3' In keeping with the dualistic character of Bataille's thought, he opposes rational knowledge to the immediacy of experience, discovering in the latter something that exceeds the limits of reason (and thus representation). Yet Bataille is unable to articulate this experience directly without recourse to the agency of the imagination, albeit as thk. "tt A "7if disNsolution"l tfhat 7ivekr diceqrn-s in th~ dead rlk - ~f th tranoCen- dental imagination. In The Story of the Eye, he renders this deadlock through the figure of Marcelle's eye, and it is at this point that Bataille's work is closest to Surrealism. Similarly, in The Hundred-Headless Woman Ernst turns to the image of the eye to render the deadlock of the Surrealist imagination through the theme of vision and blindness. Yet in place of Bataille's attempt to arrest the process of symbolization, Ernst reconfigures the eye on a thematic level as a symbol of revelation, transforming blindness into illumination. Finally, what does this reading contribute to our understanding of the Breton- Bataille polemic? I believe it demonstrates an underlying affinity between Bataille and Surrealism, the degree to which his thought was consonant with Surrealism. Since the late i96os discussions of Surrealism have repeatedly emphasized the distance between Bataille and Surrealism.32 What these accounts share is the assumption that Breton was automatically and innately hostile to anything trans- gressive. Indeed, it is commonly assumed that Breton rejected The Story of the Eye as an example of the base materialism to which he was constitutionally adverse.33 Yet, surprisingly, Breton was an enthusiastic reader of the book upon its publica- tion, as recorded in a letter to his wife, dated August 1928: Just published, in the same collection as Aragon's book [i.e., Le con d'Irane], is a book by Bataille, by Georges Bataille: Histoire de I'oeil, par Lord Auch.

There are clear parallels here with the role of repetition in the work of Lacan: as the missed encounter in which the automaton of representa- tion encounters the tuch6 of the Real.

The principal cause behind this reading lay in the polemics on Surrealism in Tel Quel during 1968-73, which valorized the writings of Bataille and Antonin Artaud against those of Breton. This reading would significantly influence the reception of Bataille in the English-speaking world. On Tel Quel, see Philippe Forest, Histoire de Tel Quel, 1960-1982 (Paris: Seuil, 1995). 33.

This is 1928, the year Maurice Nadeau described as the "year of achievements": Breton had just published Le Surrealisme et la peinture and Nadja, Louis Aragon had published Traite du style, Ernst and Joan Mir6 had just held successful exhibitions.35 Yet against these achievements, Breton still describes The Story of the Eye as "absolutely marvelous" and "the intellectual event of the year." If nothing else, this letter underlines the proximity between Bataille and Surrealism. 36 Many themes in this paper recall recent discussions of the uncanny in Surrealism, but I want to distance my interpretation from these readings. It is not that these readings are incorrect, but rather that they do not go far enough; they succeed in transposing Surrealism from an aesthetic context to a psychoanalytical context, yet evade the socio-political dimension that was always central to the Surrealist enterprise. Nor do I claim that my interpretation escapes the uncanny, since it undoubtedly revolves around failure and repetition. What I'm attempting to do is simply open the terms of the debate, to identify the articulation between the aesthetic, the social, and the political in Surrealism, and, more important, to suggest that Surrealism's failure was as much sociological as psychological. In practical terms this means engaging with the minutiae of historical experience, recovering the contemporaneity of the Surrealist enterprise: that is, to encounter the deadlock of the Surrealist imagination anew with the hope that its promise will one day be redeemed.

It is worth noting that Simone Breton shared her name with the protagonist in The Story of the Eye, which may have colored Breton's perception of the narrative. Furthermore, Breton's acrimo- nious divorce from Simone in 1929 contributed to the polarization of the Surrealist movement into antagonistic factions, since the Surrealists who sided with Simone would also form the nucleus of the "dissident" Surrealist group (Max Morise, Raymond Queneau, Robert Desnos, Jacques Baron, Roland Tual) who would gather around Documents after the publication of Breton's Second Manifesto in December 1929.
