<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK LIST 575 widely recognized, although many still believe that they have a stronger historical core than Lemche acknowledges. Yet more controversial are his arguments for dating the Pentateuch in the post-exilic period, especially late in that period. There are strong arguments for dating at least parts of it much earlier. Whatever may be thought of such questions, readers will value the book and find it interesting. To end on a lighter note, Scottish readers are unlikely to welcome the description of James Barr in the penultimate sentence of the book as "der englische Alttestamentler und Theologe". [J.A. EMERTON] Y. MAORI, The Peshitta Version of the Pentateuch and Early Jewish Exegesis (Hebrew). 408 pp. The Magnes Press, Jerusalem, 1995. $23. This book is based on Maori's dis- sertation at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which was noted in VT 27 (1977), p. 256. The published form differs from the original in that the treatment of a number of subjects has been expanded, and more recent publications have been taken into consideration. The chapter headings are listed in English as well as Hebrew, but the book lacks the English summary of the dissertation. A translation into English would be welcome. [J.A. EMERTON] E.

The tenth anniversary of the Werkgroep Informatica, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, was made into an oppor- tunity for representatives of a number of research groups to meet and report on their work. This volume includes the text of the reports on VU Amsterdam (E. Talstra, F. Postma), Maredsous (R.-F. Poswick), Westminster Seminary, Philadelphia (J. Alan Groves), Jerusalem (E. Tov, B.A. Nieuwoudt), Bethel-Bielefeld (C. Hardmeier), and Tubingen (H. Schweizer), and a short response by H.M. Vroom which drew attention to the contribution of formalized computer-based research on the biblical text to reflection about hermeneutical questions. The volume provides a valuable progress report on projects which were under way in the late 1980s before the massive devel- opment of "computer Bibles" on microcomputers in the past few years provided the wished-for "scholar-friendly" tools that are now in widespread use.

Contributions to Biblical Exegesis and Theology 21. 271 pp. Uitgeverij Peeters, Leuven, 1997. BEF 1240. In his intro- duction, the editor stresses the importance of iconography in the study of religion in Israel and elsewhere in the ancient Near East rather than almost exclusive reliance on texts. He notes the view of some scholars that images of Yahweh were used in temples in Israel. The present book "offers... a representative and well-informed survey of the available data, both textual and archaeological, on the role of divine images in the biblical world" (p. 18). The articles are all in English. I. Cornelius surveys iconography in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Urartu, and Syria-Palestine. He finds five ways of representing a deity: "as an anthropomorphic being;... a theriomorphic being; ... a mixture of the two;... in inanimate form (by symbols such as a lightning fork or a weapon"); and "by a materially emphasized empty space" (pp. 41-2). Angelika Berlejung describes and discusses the Mesopotamian ritual of the mouth-washing of images "to establish perfect purity and to enable con- tact between the earthly and the divine worlds", after which the "image became 'charged' with positive powers" (p. 45). H. Niehr "collects and discusses the evidence for a YHWHi statue in the First Temple" (p. 74). He believes that, given the widespread use of cultic images in the ancient Near East, the onus of proof is on those who deny such use in Israel and Judah, and who are thus involved in difficulty in explaining some passages in the O.T. For example, in 1 Kings xii 28-9 "The calf, as YHWH'S divine image, is not only a pedestal for an invisible deity... but is itself a theriomorphic cult image" (p. 82). Further, Niehr holds that cultic statues of Yahweh were found in Jerusalem no less than in the Northern</page></plain_text>
