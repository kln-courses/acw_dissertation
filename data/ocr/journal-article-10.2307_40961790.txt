<plain_text><page sequence="1">the current economic climate and its resultant effects on research funding and development-led archaeology, it may be of interest to the Irish archaeologist that there is one corner of the world with a thirst for qualified, experienced field staff. The sparsely populated state of Western Australia generates a large proportion of the nation's wealth, predominantly through mining ventures. It is also home to vast tracts of intact archaeological landscapes. In accordance with the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972, archaeological surveys must precede all ground works. The current exponential rate of exploration and exploitation of the state's mineral wealth is therefore dependent on the satisfaction of the Heritage Act. This has led to a seemingly unending backlog of surveys to be undertaken. For the most part, archaeological work in Western Australia consists of pedestrian surveys encompassing large blocks of land that have been proposed for development. The work is often conducted in remote locations and can involve hiking up to 20km in one day. The closest parallel to these surveys in an Irish context would be systematic field-walking. Owing to the extreme rarity of stratified deposits in open-air sites, subsurface testing is uncommon. Such investigations are usually only undertaken in caves where there is a substantial deposit. Archaeological surveys are just one element of the heritage management process. An ethnographic survey of the project area is conducted by an anthropologist and representatives from the relevant Traditional Owner Group. It is also standard practice for Traditional Owners to take part in archaeological surveys. The objective of the archaeological survey is to identify sites and cultural material with a view to furnishing the developer with spatial data that act as an exclusion zone under the Heritage Act. The major site types have correlations to Irish examples. Large lithic scatters, standing stones, coastal fish-traps and shell middens are common site types in the northern part of the state. Extensive rock engravings and grinding patches occur on suitable rock outcrops in certain areas. Quarries and blade factories also proliferate. Correlations can equally be seen between Irish and Aboriginal artefact assemblages. Analogous technologies arrived at independently by peoples separated by time and geography is attested to across many cultures. A pertinent example is the woven Neolithic bag (IA: 1967. 115) found in County Westmeath, on display in the National Museum of Ireland, and its remarkable similarity to the woven Aboriginal bag (1902:189) acquired by the Museum in the early twentieth century. Many artefacts in Western Australia will, similarly, be recognisable to the Irish archaeologist, though in transmuted form. Flake scrapers, blades, adzes, points and gravers are common in artefact scatters. Choppers, hammer stones, hand axes and ground-edge axes also occur. Grinding stones, sometimes strikingly similar to European saddle querns, are frequently found both on open-air sites and in rock shelters. Owing to the extremely slow rate of soil accumulation, caused by constant erosion, Aboriginal habitation sites and stone quarries have lain exposed on the surface for centuries, if not millennia. It is not unusual to find dense concentrations of flaked stone artefacts 26 Archaeology Ireland Winter 20 1 0</page><page sequence="2">Left: View from within rock shelter, Central Pilbara. Below.

Such material has likely been flaked from in situ cores and will often display a dull patina (caused by exposure to aeolian sand and the leaching of minerals) that suggests considerable antiquity. It is quite an experience to come across artefacts that have remained, on the surface, undisturbed by human agency since the day they were created. The processes involved before, after and during an archaeological survey in Western Australia will be familiar to the Irish archaeologist. Prior to the undertaking of a survey, preliminary desktop research is conducted in much the same way as in Ireland, using the Department of Indigenous Affairs database Archaeology Ireland Winter 2010 (AHIS). This is an excellent resource, similar to the on-line Monuments Database in Ireland but linking sites to relevant reports and surveys undertaken in a given area. Ethno-historical accounts and early explorers' journals are also important sources of information. Interpretation of sites is very much present in the mission brief. This is landscape archaeology in its purest form. Owing to the aridity of the Australian environment, water was a determining factor for human activity. As a result, the occurrence of (semi-)reliable water sources very often entrains at least some archaeological material. The identification of site locations can be augmented by targeting certain landforms and geological features. Sites are viewed and interpreted in the context of their surroundings, with large block surveys bringing to light multiple sites over wide geographic areas. The relationships between landforms and differing site types provide much research potential.</page><page sequence="3">Clockwise from top: Conducting a survey, Central Pilbara.

The grand scale of the Australian landscape allows most sites identified during these surveys to be avoided by development. In some cases, however, the archaeological material and the resource deposit intersect. If permission to disturb a site is granted by the Department of Indigenous Affairs under Section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act, a full site salvage and extensive recording are usually undertaken. Upon completion of fieldwork, a final report is submitted to the client. Again, the format of the report would be familiar to the Irish archaeologist and contains historical background, project description, environmental details, method statements, survey results and recommendations. One element with which the Irish archaeologist will not be familiar, however, is the fraught political entanglements that can potentially lie at the heart of any job. Owing as much to history as to the immense sums of money involved in resource development projects, there is a lot of vested interest in the results of heritage surveys. The archaeologist can occasionally end up caught in the middle of disputes between mining companies and Traditional Owner Groups. In some instances, archaeological results can be used as leverage in negotiations by either developers or Traditional Owner Groups. For one accustomed to the role of objective data- recording, the interplay of archaeology and politics in Australia can be quite unsettling. Politics aside, there is something quickening for the archaeologist in identifying field monuments and having a Traditional Owner on the team to offer hitherto unimagined insights into the nature and function of the archaeological material. It must be remembered that in certain parts of the state the indigenous people were living a traditional existence, unaware of modern society, until the 1960s. All things considered, the heritage industry in Western Australia offers the possibility of a very rich professional experience. Exposure to thousands upon thousands of lithic artefacts is certain. The recording of petroglyphs and stone arrangements is very likely, and there is also potential for excavating cave deposits as old as the Pleistocene. Archaeology is often only one part of the job description. In Australia one also has to be something of a geologist, botanist, diplomat, explorer, mechanic and off-road driver. The isolated locations, the extremities of climate, the long hours and physical nature of the work require a degree of dedication and inconvenience which is reflected in the very favourable pay rates. For graduates and vacillating, unemployed field staff, there are worse ways of putting in a year or two. â–  Acknowledgements All images used with the kind permission of the Nyiyaparili Native Title Claimant Group.
