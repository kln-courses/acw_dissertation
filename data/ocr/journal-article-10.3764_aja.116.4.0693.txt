Scott, University of Bristol, reports:  The 2011 Wadi Yutm Archaeological Survey (WYAS)  is a component of the Great Arab Revolt Project based  at the University of Bristol and undertaken in affili- ation with the Al-Hussein Bin Talal University. The  focus of the initial fieldwork was to gather archaeologi- cal information on World War I and the Great Arab  Revolt of 1916–1918 and to address an archaeologi- cal data gap in the Wadi Yutm region (fig. 27) for all  time periods. Thirty-five locations of ruins and cultural material  concentrations were documented and combined into  14 sites. Four of these sites had been previously re- corded; three were Roman-Nabataean fortifications,  and the fourth was a late (1900) Ottoman garrison. All  four (Khirbet al-Khalde, Khirbet al-Kithara, Khadra,  and Merced) were substantially updated by the WYAS.  Fig. 26. Latrine ( foreground ) and piscina (above), Humayma.
