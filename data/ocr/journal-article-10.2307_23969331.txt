<plain_text><page sequence="1">DRIVING APHRODITE FROM THE WORLD: TATIAN'S ENCRATITE PRINCIPLES OF SEXUAL RENUNCIATION The motives Tatian had for advocating sexual renunciation in the early Christian encratite movement remain largely unexplored and need to be better understood.1 Though not the first Christian encratite on record, his stature as an advocate of Christian sexual renunciation eclipses that of his predecessors and contemporaries in Greco-Roman society.2 Tatian, who converted, as he phrases it, from Greek learning to the 'barbarian' learning of the Septuagint,3 Paul's letters, and the Gospels, went on to become one of the more provocative, influential, and sexually alienated Christians in the second century. He ardently supported the encratite idea that Christians must renounce all sexual activity in order to gain salvation and immortality. This prohibition extended to all acts of sexual intercourse, including sexual relations within marriage. Tatian further believed that only Christians would be saved. His encratite stance would make human beings extinct were it to be adopted universally, yet his way of thinking was hardly unique in second-century Christianity, and he helped give added momentum to the Christian pre ference for sexual renunciation. The encratite way of life had become popular enough by Tatian's time and later, partly under his influence, that it alarmed a number of church fathers and incited them to denounce Tatian as the leader among 1 Tatian's reasons for living by and advocating sexual renunciation remain unexplained, though previous scholars have motivated his ascetic outlook in various ways, G. Gasparro, Enkrateia e antropologia (Rome: Institutum Patristicum Augustinianum, 1984), pp. 32-56, 368-71; A. Voôbus, A History of Asceticism in the Syrian Orient I (Louvain: Peeters, 1958), pp. 11-12; P. Brown, The Body and Society (New York: Columbia University Press, 1988), pp. 92-6. 2 Many church fathers beginning with Irenaeus regarded Tatian as the leading figure among the encratites in Greco-Roman culture and Syrian Christianity, W. Petersen, Tatian s Diatessaron (Leiden: Brill, 1994), pp. 61-4, 79, n. 138, and 78-83. I am concerned with his role in Greco-Roman Christianity, where his Oratio was especially well known, Eusebius, HE 4.29.7. 3 Or at. 43.9—12. For Tatian's use of the Septuagint, see Petersen, Tatian s Diatessaron, p. 69 and A. Sperber, 'The New Testament and Septuagint', JBL 59 (1940), pp. 193—4.

Tatian's encratite ideas were also pivotal as a catalyst for more authoritative ecclesiastical sexual norms. By provoking church fathers such as Clement and Jerome to react against his advocacy of sexual encratism, he challenged them to formulate alternative notions of Christian sexual morality that allow for marital inter course and reproduction.5 To better grasp early church sexual ethics, then, it is worthwhile to know where the church fathers thought Tatian went wrong and what they thought he got right. On one major point, as we will see, the church fathers strongly agree with Tatian. They abhor Aphrodite,6 though they do not accord her the all-embracing range of power that he does in light of popular Greek religion. Their antipathy to Aphrodite as a seductively alien demon reveals a hitherto unrecognized motive behind early Christian sexual asceticism. Tatian, moreover, interprets the conflict between God and Aphrodite in terms of the Stoic idea that the gods are elemental components of human beings and the world. Stoic cosmology, he thinks, is a wicked but partially true science about the Olympians as immanent gods, and it reveals why sexuality is a diabolical invention that Christians must reject in order to worship God alone. This theological factor in Christian sexual asceticism has gone unappreciated in recent studies on sexuality in antiquity. Foucault, for example, leaves the gods out of his studies on sexuality from classical antiquity through the second century CE, which the ancient Greeks and early Christians never did.7 The encratite rationale of Tatian and his followers, 4 Eusebius, HE4.28.2, Jerome, Adv.Jov. 1.239, Comm. in Amos 6.247, Comm. in Titum 7.686, and Petersen, Tatians Diatessaron, pp. 61-4, 78-83. 5 Clement of Alexandria, Strom. 3.49.1-6, 3.79.1-86.1, and Jerome, Adv.

Foucault overly downplays the idea that a sharp difference separates Christian sexual principles from their counterparts in Greco-Roman philosophy and society. 'We are not talking about a moral rupture between tolerant antiquity and austere Christianity ... ; the codes in themselves did not change a great deal... [and] the themes are the same.'

Foucault</page><page sequence="3">30 KATHY L. GACA however, reawakens our awareness of Aphrodite's once for midable sexual presence and makes her former prevalence unforgettable. With the above concerns in mind I will explicate Tatian's reasons for thinking that Christians must reject sexual activity altogether in order to be saved. Toward this end, I use the extant fragment from his On Perfection according to the Saviour (fr.5) and his Oratio ad Graecos.8 Tatian's speech and fragments provide the only sustained and direct testimony of encratite thought avail able today. We must give first priority to explicating his argu ments and presuppositions to understand his advocacy of sexual renunciation.9 Tatian, however, nowhere provides an explicit apologia or manifesto in favour of his encratite position. He pre sumes this norm in his extant writings and leaves significant clues here and there indicating why he supports it. Some detective work is thus needed to elicit his religious and philosophical motives for doing so. As I argue below, Tatian demonstrates that he does in fact sup port sexual renunciation through two exegetical stratagems—his striking interpretation of Paul's ideas about uncontrolled sexual fornication in 1 Corinthians 7, and his explanation of why is able to promote that an austere continuity unites the sexual morality of Greek, Roman, and early Christian writers largely because he ignores the conflicting theological grounds of Greco-Roman and early Christian sexual morality. His continuity theory has been influential. Dale Martin, for instance, accepts it as true, The Corinthian Body (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995), pp. 200, 289, n. 3. I set forth my counter-argument to Foucault's continuity theory here insofar as it pertains to Tatian. 8 I use M. Whittaker, Tatian : Oratio ad Graecos and Fragments (Oxford, 1982) and cite the page and line numbers common to her and E. Schwartz's editions, TU 4.1 (1888). M. Marcovich's edition (New York: De Gruyter, 1995) has too many conjectural emendations, but contains valuable information. On the Oratio's likely date range, see Marcovich, pp. 2-3, but cf. R. Grant, 'The Date of Tatian's Oration', HTR 46 (1953), pp. 99—101. 9 It is unenlightening to adopt the piecemeal method of labelling Tatian's sexual encratism as Gnostic, Hermetic, Syrian Christian, and/or Judaeo-Christian Baptist based on this or that passage from his writings. R. Grant ('The Heresy of Tatian', JTS ns 5 [1954], pp. 62-8) and G. Quispel (Makarius, Das Thomasevangelium und das Lied von der Perle [Leiden: Brill, 1967], pp. 65-113) associate Tatian's encratite stance with Gnosticism. A. Voobus (A History of Asceticism, pp. n-12) suggests that Tatian was a naturally born ascetic because he was Syrian, but F. Millar ('Porphyry: Ethnicity, Language, and Alien Wisdom' in J. Barnes and M. Griffin [eds.], Philosophia Togata II [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997, pp. 242-4, 261-2) shows why it is misguided to assume that there is an ethnically Syrian way of thinking. P. Beatrice ('Apollos of Alexandria', ANRW 2.26.2 [1995], PP· I25I-7I) studies apostolic or Judaeo-Christian Baptist encratism that antedates Tatian. The possible connections between it and Tatian's encratism remain an open question.</page><page sequence="4">DRIVING APHRODITE FROM THE WORLD 31 Adam fell from paradise according to Genesis. The motives behind his encratite position, though, he reveals more indirectly. Tatian's underlying rationale depends on a heady mix of Greek and biblical ideas that he harbours about several subjects: the Greek gods and their powers, the gods' origins and Stoic ground ing in nature, and the human condition under the control of the immanent gods. These ideas further reveal his combined cultural background in Greek religion and education, Stoic natural philo sophy, and Greek scriptural teachings.10 We can comprehend Tatian's fervent desire to eliminate sexual activity altogether only if we grasp his Stoic-based cosmology and its physical drama of gods and mortals. His argument also helps uncover the conflicting theological ideas that helped motivate early Christian sexual asceticism in Hellenistic culture. I. Tatian's Encratite Position as Indicated in his Exegesis Tatian is the first known Christian writer to have seen the prac tical need to explain the significance of Paul's ideas about uncon trolled sexual activity. Paul suggests in ι Corinthians 7 that if married Christian couples were to try to renounce sexual relations within marriage, they would put themselves at risk of succumbing to Satan because most persons are too weak for life-long sexual abstinence. Due to their 'state of being uncontrolled [άκρασία]' with respect to sexual activity (1 Cor. 7:5), they would give into sexual temptations forbidden by biblical law. To Paul's mind the gravity of such uncontrolled sexual activity is very severe, as he indicates in 1 Corinthians 5 by his summary condemnation of a man who had sexual relations with the wife of the man's father. Through some unstated procedure, Paul declares, the man must be surrendered to Satan for an extreme punishment, for by sexually fornicating he has succumbed to Satan and defected from obeying God's Pentateuchal sexual regulations,11 which Paul continues to support as binding on Christians. Thus the man puts his Christian community at grave danger of God's retributive wrath, which his community should deflect by 10 Though born in Syria, Tatian identifies himself as Greek by education and culture prior to his conversion (Orat 2.9-10; 43.9-12), and see A. Vôobus, A History of Asceticism, pp. 32-3, 37 and M. Elze, Tatian und seine Theologie (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, i960), pp. 19-27. 11 For Paul, sexual fornicators succumb to Satan, for he maintains that married Christians must make love with their spouses in order to help each other avoid Satan and his enticements to sexually fornicate (1 Cor. 7:2-5).</page><page sequence="5">32 KATHY L. GACA punishing him.12 As Paul puts it, the man must be handed over for 'the destruction of his flesh' (i Cor. 5:1-5). Majority scholarly opinion favours that Paul calls for actual death to befall the man through supernatural agency, such as by cursing him.12 It cannot be ruled out, though, that Paul's judgement aims to stir up zealous devotees in the community to take matters into their own hands and kill him.14 Regardless which type of death-bearing agency Paul has in mind or whether the Corinthians would have carried out either sentence, Paul commands that the man meet his mortal demise because he has egregiously put the Christian community in harm's way by sexually fornicating. Thus the many early Christians who sought to live by Paul's dictates, as Tatian did, had a compelling motive to learn what kinds of sexual activity constitute uncontrolled fornication. With this knowledge they could avoid the kinds of sexual activity that would make them succumb to Satan and to the punitive outrage of their community. Paul, however, nowhere neatly itemizes which sex acts are fornicating as opposed to permissible, ι Corinthians thus leaves two questions open to interpretation: What kinds of sexual activity must Christians avoid practising 12 For Paul's belief in God's violent wrath against sexual fornicators and the community that negligently condones them, see ι Cor. 10:7-9 and 1 Thess. 4:3—6. I address this matter more fully below, in connection with Tatian's notion of retributive mortality. 13 W. Schrage, Der erste Brief an die Korinther, vol. 1 / Koi,1—6,11 (Zurich: Benziger, 1991), p. 376, n. 51, cf. Deut. 27:20. See too P. Tomson, Paul and the Jewish Law (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1990), pp. 101—3; C. Senft, La première épitre de saint Paul aux Corinthiens (Geneva: Labor et fides, 1990), pp. 73—4; W. Meeks, The First Urban Christians (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1983), p. 130; W. Orr and J. Walther, 1 Corinthians (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1976), pp. 188-9; and C. K. Barrett, First Corinthians (London: A &amp; C Black, 1968), p. 126. 14 Paul formally cites Deuteronomic precedent to deliver his condemnation. 'Eliminate the wicked man from your midst [ϊξάρατε τον πονηρον βξ υμών]' (ι Cor. 5:13), which follows Deuteronomy's formula 'you will eliminate the wicked man from your midst [eÇapeïs τον πονηρον ϊξ υμών αυτών]' (Deut. 17:7; Ι9:Ι9&gt; 22:2ΐ; 22:24; 24:?)· Εξαίρω in this formula of condemnation is a euphemism for putting sexual apostates to death by human agency and as such is synonymous with capital punishment, such as θανατώσαι and λιθοβολησουσιν αύτην.,.και άποθαν€Ϊται, (Deut. 17.7; 22.21, cf. 22:24) and ά.7τοθαν€Ϊται (Deut. 24:7). Jubilees likewise insists that a man who makes love to his father's wife must be put to death through stoning by the community (33:13), which is precisely the case Paul addresses in 1 Cor. 5:1-5. Jubilees would have the woman put to death as well (33:10). Philo too urges that persons he deems to be sexual apostates should be put to death in order to keep the community safe from the Lord's retributive wrath, Spec. 3.11, 38, 49-50, 51, 58. T. Seland explores this question about Hellenistic Jewish vigilantism, but he abstains from any verdict about 1 Cor. 5:1-5, Establishment Violence (Leiden: Brill, I995)&gt; PP· 267-8.</page><page sequence="6">DRIVING APHRODITE FROM THE WORLD 33 in order to remain free of fornication, Satan, and community punishment? Second, what kinds of sexual activity, if any, are safe for Christians to practice without distress? Paul's early exegetes stood to quell community fears about this sexual danger if they provided their fellow Christians with clear rules to follow. Tatian was among the first to venture an answer these questions for his and their own apparent good. By Tatian's understanding of Paul's meaning, no sexual activity is safe to practice. He interprets ι Corinthians 7 to mean that all sexual activity is uncontrolled and Satanic fornication, includ ing sexual intercourse within Christian marriage.15 Paul's phras ing indicates to Tatian that sexual relations unavoidably enslave sexual agents to the devil, as he states in a fragment from On Perfection according to the Saviour. On Tatian's view Paul does not really mean it when he says in χ Cor. 7:2-5 that he allows each man to have a wife and each woman a husband, so that the couples may engage in marital sexual intercourse. Paul only seems to permit sexual relations within Christian marriage, but he is so reluctant in his wording that he actually teaches that such practices are forbidden fornication in bondage to Satan. 'Paul permits them [viz. Christian marital sexual relations in ι Cor. 7:2—5] in so disapproving a manner that he in effect pre vents the practice. By agreeing that [Christian married couples] after their prayers may come together in the union of sexual cor ruption because of Satan and their lack of self-control [ακρασία], Paul has revealed that the one who would follow this advice is enslaved ... to a state of being uncontrolled [ακρασία], to fornica tion, and to the devil.'16 Thus, by Tatian's understanding of ι Corinthians 7, Paul asserts that even sexual activity within Christian marriage is devoted to the devil. Christians therefore have only one way to gain proper control over their sexuality so as to avoid being an acratic pawn of Satan. They must renounce any and all sexual activity as the 'union of sexual corruption'. Tatian's position that γάμος is nopveia is characteristic of encratite thought, U. Bianchi, xxv and C. Aloe Spada, 'Un' omelia greca anonima "sulla verginità" (1985), p. 604, n. 3, both in U. Bianchi (éd.), La tradizione dell'enkrateia (Rome: Edizioni dell'Ateneo, 1985). It is also well established that Tatian considered marital sexual intercourse to be fornication, G. Gasparro, 'Motivazioni proto logiche dell' enkrateia' in U. Bianchi (ed.), pp. 157-8 and R. Grant, 'The Heresy of Tatian', p. 64 and his 'Tatian and the Bible', Studia patristica 1 (1957), pp. 300-1· 16 On Perfection, fr.5=Clement Strom. 3.81.1-2. Jerome adds that Tatian found 'all sexual intercourse to be filthy [omnem coitum spurcum]', Adv. Jov. 1.239, and 'every sexual union of the male with a woman to be unclean' and 'a corruption', Comm. in Gal. 7.526.</page><page sequence="7">34 KATHY L. GACA Tatian's interpretation of ι Corinthians 7 differs significantly from the more straightforward interpretation of Paul's meaning. Paul states that Christians who wish to be sexually active should marry Christians, and then engage only in marital sexual rela tions.17 To his mind Christian marriage serves as a preventive from falling into biblically forbidden practices of sexual fornica tion, such as incest or adultery, not as a forum in which to sexually fornicate.18 'Due to acts of sexual fornication [δια δέ ras πορνΐίας], let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband. Let the husband render the sexual duty to his wife and let the wife behave likewise for her husband' (1 Cor. 7:2-3). Paul 17 Paul assumes the norm of Christian religious endogamy in ι Cor. 7:1-39. He regards only these fully Christian couples in a more honorific way as 'the married [οί γ£γαμηκότ€;]' in Christ. They are forbidden to break their holy matrimony through divorce. Other couples, whom he groups together as 'the rest', are in origin Gentile religious aliens whose marriages have become religiously mixed by one spouse converting to Christianity before the other. These couples are free to separate if need be, for they are not fully in Christ and hence to Paul are not fully married. When Paul urges that Christians who need to be sexually active must 'marry [γαμ(ίτωσαν]\ he means that they should marry persons who are already fellow Christians or who agree to convert to Christianity so that the newlyweds may join the ranks of the Christian 'married [ο! γίγαμηκόres]'. He makes this teaching explicit in his recommendation that Christian widows who marry must to do so 'in the Lord'. Paul also takes it for granted that single Christians who marry will engage in activities that require both spouses to be Christian, such as conducting Christian prayer together (1 Cor. 7:5, 10-15, 3*&gt;&gt; 39)· He does not condone Christians marrying Gentiles who are unreceptive to converting. 18 Sexual fornication in Paul's sense consists of sexual intercourse that is beyond the boundaries of marriage religiously permissible for Christians. This includes extra-marital sexual relations for both the husband and wife, sexual intercourse in devotion to gods other than or in addition to God, such as religiously alienating marital sexual relations, and sexual transgressions of the Septuagint sex laws, such as incest. Sexual fornication is specific to sexual intercourse between women and men, not a generic designation of sexual immorality. This is seen in the Septuagint, such as the rape of Dinah by Shechem, the sexual relations between Judah and Tamar, and the woman who makes love to another man before her marriage (Gen. 34:2, 31; 38:1-30, esp. 21, 24, 26; and Deut. 22:21). Paul, by urging Christians to 'flee sexual fornication' (1 Cor. 6:18), expressly prohibits Christians from practicing sexual intercourse in devotion to alien gods, incest, and extra-marital Christian sexual activity, such as adultery (Rom. 1:22-27; 1 Cor. 5:r; 5:9-13; 2 Cor. 12:20- 21 ; Gal. 5:19-21; 1 Thess. 4:3—4). The Septuagint, which is Paul's source for his sexual prohibitions, similarly forbids God's people from engaging in idolatry (Exod. 20:4-6; 34:10-16; Lev. 26:1-39; Deut. 5:13-15; 8:19-20; 17:2-7; and 2 Chr. 28:1-5). Under this anti-idolatry rubric it prohibits the people from engaging in sexual intercourse in worship of other gods, which includes marriages that encourage religious diversity (Exod. 34:15-16; Num. 25:1-5; Deut. 7:3-4; 23:18). Other types of sexual fornication that both Paul and the Septuagint prohibit include incest and adultery (Lev. 18:6-30; Exod. 20:13; 20:17; Lev. 20:17; Deut. 5:17; 5:21, 22:20-3).</page><page sequence="8">DRIVING APHRODITE FROM THE WORLD 35 pointedly contrasts Christian marital sexual intercourse with fornication. Christian marital sex is a conjugal 'duty [ocpeiA-tj]' or obligation (i Cor. 7:3), and this duty functions as a kind of sexual guard against Satan. Christian couples must make love per iodically in order to help each other keep Satan's temptations to sexually fornicate at bay. Hence, according to Paul, the Christian conjugal duty keeps the devil at a distance in his prowling. Tatian, however, interprets Paul's prepositional phrase 'because of fornicating acts [δια ras wopveias]' to mean that Christians who marry do so in order to sexually fornicate under the falsely safe cover of being married. By this understanding of 1 Corinthians 7, if Christians cannot refrain from sexual intercourse completely, which is what they must do in order to be saved, then they must marry so as to give their sexual fornication a façade of legit imacy. Everything about this façade is spurious, however, for the institution of Christian marriage does not rehabilitate the sinfully fornicating nature of their marital sexual relations. Rather, mar riage wrongly makes this egregious transgression seem normal and permissible. Tatian is not fooled by this specious normalcy. Christian marital sexual intercourse is still sexual fornication, as he declares in On Perfection, and sexual fornication deserves nothing but antipathy. Ί loathe sexual fornication [nopveiav μ€μίσηκα]\ he declares in his Oratio (11.27-8). Tatian recoils at the vile prospect of married Christians making love to each other because he supports Paul's assessment that sexual fornica tion is a Satanic threat that Christians must 'flee from' altogether (1 Cor. 6:18). Unlike Paul, however, Tatian advocates fleeing from sexual intercourse under any circumstances, even to the point of declaring that sexually active married Christians are for nicating slaves of the devil, and he is convinced Paul agrees with his assessment. For Tatian, therefore, exegetes of 1 Corinthians 7 would be reprehensibly negligent to teach that Paul allows Christians to engage in marital sexual activity, for the gist of this doctrine would be that Christians are not only free but duty-bound to sexually succumb to Satan, so long as they are married. Paul's true intention rules out such reckless exegesis. Even though he pretends to allow Christian marital sex, the dis approving scowl Tatian imagines him making indicates that Paul disallows it. Tatian corroborates his striking conviction that sexual inter course is a kind of devil worship in his interpretation of Adam's sin and fall. Adam, he states, fell and became alienated from God because he engaged in sexual intercourse with Eve, who is Adam's wife and sexual mate joined as 'two into one flesh'</page><page sequence="9">36 KATHY L. GACA (Gen. 2:24).19 Tatian thus denies that the primordial biblical couple can make love together without defecting from God. If he believed that sexual intercourse were religiously permissible among couples devoted to God, he would not have banished Adam from paradise for making love with his wife. Tatian does expel him, however, for this wicked sin. Here too, then, he sets marital sexual intercourse in the same league of fornicating danger as the one posed, for Paul, by a Christian man making love with his father's wife. Had the man made love with his own wife, to Tatian his sexual sin would have been as heinous. The next important question is what makes him reinterpret ι Corinthians 7 so remarkably, what drives him to expel Adam from paradise for making love with Eve. II. The Olympians and their Hostile Takeoverof the World In this section I explore the Greek ideas that motivated Tatian to declare that sexual activity is entirely antithetical to the way of God. I begin with his conception of the Olympian gods, which is indebted to Greek popular theology, and then explore the pantheistic world of Stoic physics in which he situates his battle of the gods. Tatian believes that the Greek gods tangibly exist and that they have the powers traditionally associated with them in Greek religion, Homer, and astrology. Central among the gods is the Olympian pantheon. For example, Tatian states in his Oratio that Athena is a warrior goddess, Poseidon a power of the sea, Aphrodite of sexual relations, Apollo of healing and lyre music, and Zeus their leader negotiates with fate."0 In addition to the prominent Olympians, there are numerous other Greek gods, such as Gaia and various Titans. All these gods are real on Tatian's view. They are made of matter and spirit, though they do not have human flesh properly speaking (13.15-17; 15.14-15). Their corporeality is substantial and subject to pain, for God destines the Olympians to eternal punishment because of their sinful manipulation of the Greeks (15.7-16.2). The 19 Tatian presumably denies salvation to Eve along with Adam because of this marital sexual fornication, though Epiphanius's testimony does not say as much, Haer. 2.215-18 and see A. Vôôbus, A History of Asceticism, p. 36. Vôôbus (pp. 42-3) thoughtfully suggests additional ways in which Tatian's Diatessaron imparts the message of sexual renunciation. 20 8.21; 9.4; 10.23; II·1· These and further citations by number only refer to Tatian's Oratio.</page><page sequence="10">DRIVING APHRODITE FROM THE WORLD 37 Olympian gods have also shaped the human condition of mortal life within the constraints of fate, and they still embody and con trol this zodiac domain.21 Tatian thus regards the gods as genuine superhuman beings whose awesome powers are still at work in the zones traditionally associated with them.22 Their forces are reflected in astrology, and the Greek people who worship them are ruthlessly under their control. In Tatian's estimation, the Greek gods are not the bona fide deities that they are in popular Greek theology. The Olympians are rebellious angels who committed high treason against God, and they became outcasts from God's presence after he disowned them. Once upon a time, as Tatian tells the story, 'An angel who was more cunning than the rest of the angels by virtue of being first born revolted against God's law and then was proclaimed as God by his mortal and immortal followers. Then the power of God's word banished the arch-leader of the rebellion and his followers', divine and mortal alike (7.24-9). The mortals who rebelled with the Olympians then became the renegade gods' subjects. Tatian's new myth about the fallen Olympians is a vari ation on the theme of fallen angels as told in the Book of Enoch, where the unnamed sons or angels of God in Genesis 6 defect from God and come to dwell on earth.23 In Tatian's twist on the narrative, however, the head of the rebellion against God is 'the leader Zeus' (8.18-19).24 Because the people who defected from God turned to worship Zeus and his fellow Olympians, they too are culturally identifiable. They are the early Hellenic ancestors of Tatian's Greek contemporaries. As Tatian would have it, then, the Greeks have been in wanton rebellion against God ever since their ancestors abandoned him and took to worshipping the Olympians.25 21 tj.23-10.5, and see also 8.4-8, where the Olympians as zodiac powers have unjustly subjected the Greeks to birth under the regime of fate and mortality, and see H. Wey von Schwarzenbach, Die funktionen der bosen Geister (Winterthur: Keller, 1957), pp. 68-70, 191-202. 22 For the physicality that Tatian attributes to the gods, note H. Wey, Bosen Geister, pp. 70-3. 23 H. Wey, Bosen Geister, p. 15, n. 40, and for the myth in the Book of Enoch 6:1-11:2, see E. Schiirer, G. Vermes et al., History of the Jewish People (Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1987), vol. 3.1, p. 252. In addition to Aphrodite, Tatian names, as co-conspirators of Zeus, Artemis, Apollo, Hephaestus, Athena, Poseidon, Dionysus, Demeter, and Persephone, as well as some non-Olympians, such as Gaia, Cybele, Cronus, and Asclepius. 24 Tatian's teacher Justin similarly identifies the Greek gods as demons, 1 Apol. 5.1-4, H. Wey, Bosen Geister, pp. 186-90. 25 Tatian also infers from Romans 1:18-32 that the Greeks within Paul's Gentile Israel are in apostasy from God, K. Gaca, 'Paul's Uncommon Declaration to the Greeks', HTR 92 (1999), pp. 171-7, 181-3.</page><page sequence="11">38 Κ Α Τ H Y L. GACA Since that time the Greeks have been outrageous dupes of the rebellious angels, such as Aphrodite, Athena, and Zeus their ringleader (7.29-8.3; 8.18-9.23). The Greek gods are thus are a very dangerous collective of God's adversaries, the Satanic gang of twelve, and the Greeks are culpable fools for defiantly worshipping them. Tatian accordingly deplores his Greek contemporaries for continuing to revere the Olympians. The religious festivals by which the Greeks conduct their civic and spiritual lives are corrupt to the core.26 The celebrations wrongly serve to honour 'evil demons' (24.18-21), not 'the blessed gods [μακάρεσσι θεοϊσι,νΥ, as Homer thinks (8.12). Hellenic practices of this sort are not a respectable religious heritage, but proof of how badly the Greeks went astray when their ancestors turned their backs on the god of Abraham and followed the gods of Agamemnon. For Tatian, then, nothing could be more wrong than to believe, as the Greeks and Stoic philosophers did, that Zeus is 'the best and greatest of the gods' and that his fellow Olympians are second only to Zeus as deities worth worshipping for their various powers.27 Tatian deploys Stoic physical cosmology to produce a demono logy in which the Olympians are elemental principles in the world.28 He shares the Stoic position that the world is com prised of two cosmological principles, matter (ΰλη) and psychic or immanent spirit (πνεύμα). He further agrees with the Stoics that the human soul and body are a human-specific composite of these elemental components (5.2-5; 5.10-12; 12.18-22). Tatian's summative definition of spirit in relation to matter reveals his debt to Stoic thought. Immanent spirit, he expressly states, is 'spirit extending throughout matter [πνεύμα διήκον δια της ίίΑηΐ]' (5-2, ίο). This is the standard Stoic conception 26 The culture that Tatian castigates is Greek, not a Gentile culture of mixed ethnicity, as shown by his repeated address to 'Greeks' and 'men of Hellas' ('Έλλψ€ς and ανδρες "Ελληνες throughout his speech (1.2; 4.20; 14.10; 15.8; 23.5; 30.26; 31.9-11 ; 43.9). 27 Hymn.

In Stoic physics, an immanent divine 'spirit extends throughout the cosmos [πνεύμα διήκον δια του κόσμου] ... and moves through the changing facets of matter [SA^s]'.29 This creative involvement of divine spirit with matter shapes all entities in the universe and lends them their distinctive characteristics, including the gods, human beings, and the souls that make mortals alive, sentient, rational, and sexually active. Tatian's conception of the physical human body also adopts a Stoic framework. Human bodies as he describes them are an 'intricate succession of sinews and bones' (19.2-3). The Stoics similarly call the human body an intricate system (?£ι?) of 'sinews and bones'.30 Tatian, however, superimposes the biblical idea of God on Stoic physics and theo logy. God is a transcendent spirit and he produced mutable immanent spirit and matter. God then used these two elemental principles to create and structure the world and everything in it, including human beings (4.29; 3.5). In Stoic thought, no trans cendent creator or deity stands separable from the world. The primary deity and principle of rational order is Zeus as immanent spirit in its pantheistic and elemental diversity.31 Tatian, by situ ating God over the Stoic cosmos as its creator, is able to radically re-evaluate the Stoic pantheistic principle of spirit. In Tatian's remake of Stoic physical cosmology, the world and the immanent spirit that informs and shapes it were good and orderly when created by God. In its origins, 'the construction of the cosmos is good' (21.11-12, cf. 13.8-11). Ever since the Olympians defected from God and instituted the regime of Zeus, however, the primordial order of cosmic spirit and matter has changed drastically for the worse. Zeus and the gods infiltrated immanent spirit like squatters, threw it into wicked disorder, and have yet to be removed. From their strongholds in immanent spirit, the gods 'rage like bacchants in their wicked habits', 'wallow in filth', and plunge the Greeks down to their level and away from God (17.19-24; 24.15-17). The Greek gods thus func tion like toxins polluting the world's immanent spirit, dripping 29 SVF 2.1027.

Long ('Soul and Body in Stoicism', Phronesis 27 [1982], 42-5) aptly refers to the Stoic conception of the physical body as 'the flesh and bones body". The Stoics, though, describe the body as a system of 'sinews and bones' (Diogenes Laertius [=DL] 7.139), just as Tatian does. 31 M.

GACA evil where goodness and purity once suffused the cosmos and human nature.32 The world has therefore been reconfigured and contaminated due to the gods' freeform perversions of immanent spirit. Despite his debt to Stoic cosmology, Tatian's evaluation of the world and its immanent spirit is radically anti-Stoic in its tenor. As he sees it, nothing about the world as imbued by Zeus and his fellow gods can possibly be rational, for the Olympians are evil fallen angels who hold much of it in their crazed possession. This anti-rational condition holds true of people too, and especially of the lunatic philosophers, who teach depraved ideas, such as the Stoic view that Zeus is the pantheistic bearer of rationality and good order. 'The human being is not a rational animal, receptive to mind and knowledge, as those squawking [philosophers] teach' (14.16-21; 16.10-n). Tatian's views here are diametrically opposed to Stoic cosmology and psychology. In Stoic natural philosophy, the gods make the world rational, holistic, and beauti ful by their presence. 'All that exists coexists and is unified since it has a spirit extending throughout it, by means of which the entirety coheres, is continuous, and is entirely of concordant feel ing with itself'.33 Zeus shapes the primary identity of immanent spirit, for he forms its seminal logos and his guiding will makes the spirit rational.34 The other gods, in obedience to him, help make living creatures be sexually active, mortal, and subject to the unavoidable and natural constraints of fate. Adult human beings, further, are the rational animal par excellence,35 for the structure of their souls is inherently rational, though they need Stoic philosophy to learn to behave sagaciously. If men and women attain their disciplined best, which they should strive to do, they are consummate agents of right reason thanks to Zeus foremost as indwelling spirit of reason.36 Thus, where the Stoics 32 Tatian is not a hard-line Gnostic, for he does not denigrate matter as such, even though he urges that one must 'reject matter' to the extent that it is tainted by Olympian spirits, 17.29-18.4. He maintains that matter is good but infected with hot spots of Olympian spirit evil, which the power of the biblical God can and should cleanse. 33 SVF 2.473=LS 48C (Alexander of Aphrodisias, Mixt. 216.14). 3* DL 7.134. 3 'This animal, which we call the human being, endowed with foresight and quick intelligence, complex, keen, remembering things, full of reason and counsel, has been created by the supreme god with a particular distinguished status' (Cicero, Leg. 1.22). 36 For human beings as agents of right reason and Zeus's formative role therein in early Stoic thought, see B.

As go the demonically corrupted elements of the physical world and human nature, so goes human society. Tatian finds the Olympian gods responsible for tainting everything about Greek culture and the arts in the civic institution of Hellenic society (21.11-12). Greek theatre, painting, and sculpture disclose the cosmic problem that keeps the Greeks in bondage to the Olympian conspirators against God. So too do the avid faces in the audience, captivated as they are with deranged desire for Greek theatre (26.8-10). The Olympians both produce and view the obscene show of Greek culture, and they laugh at the mayhem they bring to mortal lives (8.10-12; 24.18-25.15). The lewdness and violence of Greek arts reflect the chaotic and debased world run by the gods, far beyond the city walls and deep beneath the city foundations. Tatian is especially provoked by popular allegorizing about the Olympians, which Stoic and other philosophers offered. In such allegory, matter and immanent spirit become more openly poly theistic, rather like a surrogate Mount Olympus on a cosmic scale. Matter and spirit provide a home for all the Greek gods as elements and forces, not exclusively for Zeus as immanent spirit and Hera as matter. Zeus as king of the gods remains the primary spirit element and ordering principle, but the other gods are physically with him in the spirit, just as they are on Olympus. Their diverse elemental powers, in compliance with Zeus's guidance, keep the world and human beings well ordered.37 In Tatian's day and earlier, allegory provided a method more sophist icated than myth for conceptualizing the presence of the gods, for it transformed the anthropomorphic and largely amoral gods of Greek myth into constructively good elements and forces. The Epicurean Metrodorus of Lampsacus, for example, regarded the Olympians as the very 'grounds of nature' and as 'the order ing patterns of the elements [στοιχεία]'.38 Tatian denounces Metrodorus's allegorizing worldview as an arrogant fraud, because the Greek gods bring derangement, not order, to the spirit that informs the cosmos, and they have enslaved mortals to their 37 For the Stoics, the gods are an integral part of the spirit that pervades the cosmos, SVF 2.1027 (Aëtius, Placita 1.7.33), SVF 2.1055 (Plutarch, De def. or. 29). 38 24.9-10.

Tatian thus attacks the philosophical allegory of the gods for being a scandalous whitewash. Tatian suggests that Paul supports his anti-Stoic agenda against the Olympian spirits. Paul in Galatians ominously warns that there are evil 'elemental principles of the cosmos [στοιχεία τού κόσμου]', with which Christians must not associate (Gal. 4:3, cf. Col. 2:8, 20). These principles are dangerous spirit powers in the world.39 Though Paul does not more specifically identify these spirit forces as Olympian or other gods, the Greek term he uses to describe them, 'elemental principles [στοιχ€ΐα]', signifies in Stoic physics the divine components of the physical world and their pantheistic order and movement.40 Tatian, given his Stoic background, interprets Paul's warning about the elemental prin ciples of the world as the apostle's codified message to beware of the fallacious portrayal of the gods as good in Stoic cosmology and allegory. The gods, Tatian states, manipulate and function as the 'elemental principle [στοιχ^ιωσυ]' of life and wickedness.41 Contrary to the philosophers' false teaching, Paul corrobrates that Zeus and his Olympians are anti-rational and evil elemental forces. Tatian develops a plan to restore the immanent spirit of the world and human nature to its once pristine state, in accordance with God's original purpose: the Olympians must be driven from their strongholds.42 The powerful gods cannot be taken down all at once, however, and they are not equally pernicious in their In Hellenistic philosophy, such as Stoicism, the elemental principles (στοιχεία) are the divinely inspirited physical elements that constitute the world, such as air and fire. In the broader religious thought of this period, the elements as divine forces were also believed to be powers holding sway over human lives, such as the zodiac forces. Paul (Gal. 4:3, cf. Col. 2:8, 20) harbors a strong hostility to them. As H. D. Betz observes, Paul regards the στοιχεία as 'demonic forces which constitute and control "this evil aeon" ' and oppress human beings unless Christ liberates and saves them, Galatians (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1979), pp. 204-5, with bibliography at nn. 30-31. J. Martyn (Galatians [New York: Doubleday, j997L PP· 393-402) further explicates the Greek philosophical background of στοιχεία, as does R. Tanner as well, 'St. Paul and Stoic Physics', Studia Evangelica 7 (1982), pp. 481-90. On Stoic elemental principles, see SVF 3.4i3=LS 47A (Stobaeus 1.129), DL 7 i35_6=LS 46B. Cicero (LS 4~C-ND 2.23-5, 28-30) and Augustine (SVF 2.423, Civ. dei 8.5) also discuss the divine substratum of Stoic elements, and see further LS, vol. ι (1987), pp. 266-72. 41 Tatian indicates this implicit assumption at 9.23-4 and 19.2-8. 42 To Tatian, the divine creation is like the letters of words that God meant to express pure meanings, 18.26-19.25. The defiant Olympians have changed the meanings into obscenities and Tatian strives to regain their expurgated significance.</page><page sequence="16">DRIVING APHRODITE FROM THE WORLD 43 effects on human lives, even though they are all malicious for commandeering immanent spirit. Christians need to choose their battles, to follow some order of priority in expelling the gods. The first to go should be the gods chiefly responsible for imposing a finite life constrained by fate and laden with miseries. Mortality is not natural, as the Greeks foolishly think it is. It is a wicked trick played on humanity by the gods, all so that they can howl their Homeric 'quenchless laughter [άσβεστος yéAajy]' at our expense (8.11-12). Mortals are meant to be immortal, blissful, and one with God.43 III. TaTIAN AND THE EARLY CHRISTIAN Dilemma Between Choosing God or Aphrodite Tatian finds human sexuality sharply in conflict with God's intended world order. Aphrodite in her diabolical cunning, he assumes, has turned the dirtiest Olympian trick of them all, the seductive lure of sexuality built to perpetuate the unnatural condi tion of human mortality. She stands as the Olympian Satan who inhabits and constitutes the dark finitude of sexuality, while God is asexual purity and immortal light. The severe biblical teaching that sexual idolatry elicits death-bearing punishment from God plays a significant role in Tatian's reasoning. Tatian strongly believes the popular Greek doctrine that Aphrodite prevails over human sexuality and represents the very nature of sexual desire, activity, and pleasure. He regards it as obvious that the sexual domain belongs to her. 'Aphrodite', Tatian asserts, 'takes pleasure in the embraces of sexual union' that she stimulates through her powers (8.24). Here he reflects the Hellenic belief in her erotic power. As in Tatian's comment, so too the goddess provokes and vicariously enjoys her erotic power of pleasure over humans and animals alike in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite. 'Cyprian Aphrodite provokes sweet desire' in them, and they are all subject to her rule. 'Each and every mortal being is attentive to the works of Aphrodite with the shapely crown' (Hymn. Aphr. 5.1-6). In Greek ideas about the Olympian gods and their powers, which Tatian and the Homeric hymns share, Aphrodite embodies the particularly compelling and domineering force of eroticism and its feverish excitement in the human spirit or soul. The Greeks reaffirm this belief through their common names for 43 G. Gasparro (Enkrateia e antropologia, pp. 32-56) explores Tatian's express conviction (e.g. 7.6-10) that mortals are meant to be immortal.</page><page sequence="17">44 KATHY L. G AC A sexual activity, 'the works of Aphrodite ['έργα Αφροδίτης]' or, more simply, αφροδίσια. Aphrodite is so inseparably a part of human nature for the ancient Greeks that she is 'inborn in their joints [έμφυτος αρθροις],' as Empedocles states.44 From a Greek perspective Aphrodite's sexual gifts to humanity are a prob lematic blessing, given the deep torment and suffering she often brings along with the excitement of falling into passionate love and arousal.45 The Greeks, as Tatian would have been well aware, also put these beliefs into practice ritually and in their religious art. In pre-Christian antiquity they used to worship Aphrodite as the pre-eminent deity in the erotic domain, build and maintain temples to her, sculpt statues embodying her presence, and compose hymns, poetry, and other writings explor ing her powers.46 From this perspective, which Tatian takes for granted as true, humans are living sexual beings thanks to Aphrodite's universally applicable power. To be sexually active means showing her the requisite worship. For the Greeks, mortals thus must give Aphrodite her due respect, not dismiss her from mind and body. For Tatian, however, there is nothing sweet or shapely about the desire and pleasure that Aphrodite provokes, as there is for the Greeks. True life and immortality rest with God, while death lies with Aphrodite. Tatian has a potent biblical motive for associating the sexual worship of Aphrodite with death. By the strict letter of Pentateuchal law, peoples devoted to the biblical God inevitably suffer retributive death if they worship gods other than or in addition to him (Exod. 20:3-5; Deut. 5:7-9). The Lord's people must especially avoid the sexual worship of alien gods, for the biblical God vows to destroy his people if they negligently allow Fr.25/1720-22, Β· Inwood, The Poem of Empedocles (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001 ). 45 There are numerous examples of this and related popular Greek tenets about the human experience of eros under Aphrodite's power, spanning from the archaic period into the Hellenistic period and beyond, Hesiod, Theog. 120-2, Archilochus, fr.191, 193, Ibycus, fr.286, 287, Anacreon, fr.376, 428, Sappho, fr.i. 19-24, 47 (Page), Pindar, fr.123, Aeschylus fr.44, TrGF, vol. 3, Euripides, Hipp. 447-50, 1268-81, Callimachus, G-P 4, 8, Plutarch, Amatorius 752a-b, 759e, Athenaeus, 599 f, and Meleager G-P 20. The sexual power of Aphrodite is also a cosmological principle of erotic attraction in Presocratic and other philosophical poetry, Parmenides (fr.12, 13), Empedocles (fr.25/17, ed. Inwood), Aeschylus fr.44, TrGF, vol. 3, and Lucretius 1.1-20. References are to standard editions given in the OCD\ 46 Even a highly intellectual Greek such as Plato shared these beliefs. In Laws 84ia9-b2, citizens serve 'their mistress [δέσποινα]' Aphrodite through sexual activity, as she compels them to do until they reach old age. Plato encourages them to worship her with greater propriety through acts of sexual moderation.</page><page sequence="18">DRIVING APHRODITE FROM THE WORLD 45 sexual idolaters in their domain.4' The apostle Paul strongly reaf firms this doctrine as a Christian teaching in ι Corinthians, which Tatian respected as inviolable truth. 'Do not become idolatrous, and let us not sexually fornicate as they [the idolatrous Israelites] fornicated'.48 Paul tersely adds that the Israelites died en masse when they defied God and sexually worshipped Baal with Moabite women. This teaching could hardly be more blunt and force ful. Stay away from sexually fornicating idolatry. Christians who fail to do so are doomed to die, severed in perpetuity from God. Since Tatian thinks that sexuality is inherently devoted to Aphrodite, he sees but one way to escape her fornicating power. Christians must renounce their sexual nature to gain salvation and immortality, or else God will see to their demise. Christians who took Paul's warnings to heart against sexual idolatry, as Tatian did, would especially shun Greek gods with sexual powers. This task would have been relatively easy to carry out for some of these gods. To avoid the phallic and wine god Dionysus, for example, Christians simply had to stay home and remain sober when the Bacchic revels came around. Aphrodite was far more problematic, however, because of the widespread and enduring power accorded to her. Christian baptismal waters would not readily wash away the ingrained Greek idea that the very nature of sexuality manifests Aphrodite's formidable power. Christians with a Greek or Hellenized background were imbued with the belief that there can be no αφροδίσια without Aphrodite, just as Tatian believed. They also learned through Christian conversion and catechism, however, that God obliterates agents of fornicating sexual idolatry. This perceived danger placed Aphrodite near the top of the list among Olympians to overthrow and made sexual encratism seem the only fully guaranteed way to escape the death shroud of fornication. Tatian's loathing of Aphrodite's deadly powers comes through with unmistakable clarity in his abhorrence of Sappho, the 47 Exod. 32:26-9; Deut. 13:6-11. In the biblical narrative this danger is a genuine threat, given its putative precedent in the genocidal fate God dealt out to the Canaanites and others (Exod. 23:31; 34:11; Lev. 18:24-5; Deut. 8:19-20; 9:4). God's people are invincibly protected in their dominion only if they obey his laws, the sexual laws foremost (Exod. 23:23-33; 34:11-16; Lev. 20:11-27; Num. 25:1-13; Deut. 4:25-31; 7:1-9:29; 9:4-14; 29:10-28; and Ezek. 20:27-39). 48 Paul is referring to the incident in Numbers 25 (1 Cor. 10:7-8). In 1 Thess 4:3-6 he similarly asserts that in order to avoid 'the avenging Lord [ckSikos κύριος]', Gentiles must become Christian and refrain from fornicating sexual intercourse in honour of other gods.</page><page sequence="19">46 KATHY L. GACA goddess's most compelling poet. Sappho, in songs of great sensu ous force, draws her erotic and poetic inspiration from 'immortal Aphrodite on the iridescent throne [ποικιλόθρον άθάνατ Άφροδίτα]' (fr.i.i), as the Greeks fully appreciated. 'Cypris and Eros together nurtured Sappho', the poet Antipater of Sidon aptly notes. So attuned was she to Aphrodite that she became the Greeks' tenth Muse, 'the Muse mingled with Aphrodite'.49 Her poetry thus contains extremely dangerous words for Tatian, none of them worth hearing, for Sappho colludes with the dominatrice devil by revering eros and stimulating this adoration in others. Eroti cism is central to the 'death-bearing mores [θανάτου επιτηδεύματα]' that the defiant Olympian gods have precipitated through their counterfeiting of nature (15.15; 14.10-16). To help keep eros at bay, Tatian calls Sappho a demeaning string of obscenities, rather as though he would blot her poetry out by scribbling ugly graffiti on her persona. 'Sappho, the sex-mad and cheap little whore [γύναιον πορνικον ερωτομανές] sings licentiousness [άσελγεια] about herself (34.20-21). Tatian thus further divulges his hostility toward Aphrodite in the special loathing he reserves for Sappho and her poetry. Tatian was not the only Christian in his day to consider erotic writing like Sappho's to be a baneful lure to enter the erotic trap of Aphrodite. Christians in his religious community, as he proudly observes, worked hard to keep 'licentiousness [άσελγεια]' of any kind 'far from their circle of purity [πόρρω κεχώρισται]'. The women were especially diligent in the cleansing (34.20-3; 33.10-11). Greek and Hellenized Christians, like their Greek compatriots, realized that erotic poetry aroused readers to explore Aphrodite in her iridescent depths. Sappho in particular 'speaks words truly mixed with fire', and her poetry 'brings up heat from the heart', as Plutarch acknowledged.50 From an encratite Christian viewpoint, however, the heat has become fiery damna tion, for by sharing in the works of Aphrodite human beings cast themselves from God, jumping to their deaths for the 49 G-P Antipater 11-12, Anth.

Hence Tatian and his community had a strong motive to vilify Greek erotic literature for promot ing Aphrodite at the expense of God.51 If such literature were left uncondemned, captivated readers would fall back into Aphrodite's bondage, with eros shackling the left ankle and retributive death the right. Christians in Tatian's community thus strove to dispose of the works of Sappho and the like in their effort to escape the works of Aphrodite and attain salvation with God. Tatian's project to drive Aphrodite from the world discloses an urgent new motive in Greek society for alienating people from erotic experience. Prior to the rise of Christianity, no Greeks thought it possible or desirable to eliminate the powers and effects of Aphrodite. Though pre-Christian Greeks had their own reasons for being sexually inhibited, the Greeks never aspired to eliminate sexual activity altogether, let alone eradicate the gods responsible for human erotic behavior.52 Once Greeks and Hellenized persons start to convert to Christianity, however, they as a matter of principle are required to stop worshipping the gods of eros as well as other deities. The premier biblical imperative is to worship the Lord alone, and this rule encom passes human sexual and reproductive behavior, for the sexuality of God's worshippers must be devoted to the Lord alone and leave all other gods behind. But to leave Aphrodite behind would have had a deeply unsettling effect on this cultural group of Christians, as the example of Tatian indicates, for in the Greek tradition Aphrodite unavoidably goes with sexual activity, reproduction, and children. Unlike Tatian, many of them nonetheless continued to marry, give in marriage, and procreate, for the social demands to raise a family have an enduring normative force that far ante dates Greek Christian concerns about whether it is possible to 31 What disturbs Tatian is not the homoerotic element of Sappho's poetry but its erotic element, regardless of the sex of the partners. On his view, Sappho is professionally heterosexual, for he regards her as a prostitute (eraipa), and a love-mad one as well (34.10; 34.20-21). 52 The ancient Greeks had their share of sexual aversions, but the desire to deny Aphrodite through sexual renunciation is not among them. Ancient Greek men, for instance, faced severe censure if they showed unreserved enthusiasm for sexual activity, especially if they were eager to be penetrated anally, K. J. Dover, Greek Homosexuality (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 19892), p. 23, and D. Cohen and R. Sailer, 'Foucault on Sexuality', in J. Goldstein (ed.), Foucault and the Writing of History (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Blackwell, 1994)» pp. 40-1. Conversely, Greek women were pressured not to be sexually aggressive or 'masculine' rather than docile, B.

GACA make love without breaking the first commandment to worship no other gods but the Lord. Encratite Christians like Tatian, however, sought to cast Aphrodite from her throne by treating sexuality as the idol to destroy. They were ardent in this effort, for they believed Christians would scale the heights of immortal ity by trampling sexuality underfoot. Tatian's reasoning in sup port of this view was simple, potent, and gained its share of attention: mortality is the punitive death brought about through Aphrodite's devices, so the goddess must be overthrown in order for Christians to be eternally one with God. The 'demonic gods do not die easily', though, as Tatian grudgingly admits (15.14), for eros and mortality are not readily overthrown. This attempted iconoclasm of ancient Greek eros has no precedent in Greek culture prior to the development of Christianity. Though it appears most acutely in Tatian's encratism, other patristic writers are similarly hostile toward Aphrodite, such as Clement of Alexandria. They differ from Tatian only in that they believe that it is possible to eliminate Aphrodite without sacrificing marital sexual intercourse and reproduction in the Lord, as I now explain more fully in relation to Paul. IV. Tatian's Motive for Reinterpreting i Corinthians 7 Tatian reinterprets 1 Corinthians 7 so strikingly because of his unshaken Greek conviction that Aphrodite wields absolute power over sexuality. All sexual agents are fornicators in her thrall, much like Paris and Helen whom Aphrodite imperiously drove into the marriage bed under strict orders to make love. Being married is surely no escape from her, for the Greeks do not allow for a special matrimonial category of αφροδίσια without Aphrodite. They accord her a special role in matrimonial sexual relations.53 This is why Tatian believes that even Christians who make love to their spouses are 'enslaved to ... fornication and to the devil', according to Paul (On Perfection, fr.5). Aphrodite is Tatian's 53 Aphrodite is a θαλάμων άνααοα, TrGF, vol. 2 (ed. R. Kannicht and B. Snell). Likewise Musonius asks, 'Where does Aphrodite [along with Hera, and Eros] more fittingly belong than presiding over the lawful sexual intercourse of a man and woman?' 94.20-32 (ed. C.

Married Christians make a fatal error to assume that their marital sexual relations are an escape from fornicating servitude to the goddess as sexual evil incarnate. Paul's religious ideas about the divine power of sexual activity differ markedly from Tatian's. Paul, raised as he was on the Pentateuch and Prophets, does not share Tatian's Greek identi fication of sexuality with Aphrodite. He assumes the biblical opposition between permissible sexual relations, which are marital and devoted to God alone, and sexual relations in forbidden devotion to alien gods. Only religiously alien sexual relations are fornicating servitude to Satan, such as making love in worship of Aphrodite. To Paul's mind, the divine power of human sexual ity is a matter of fighting fire with fire. The pure blue flame of Christian marital sex in the Lord stops the deadly black smoke of sexual idolatry from burning its way into Christian commu nities, bedrooms, and future generations. For Tatian, however, all erotic fire is smoke kindled by Aphrodite. Tatian and Paul thus harbour conflicting religious notions, one Greek and the other biblical, about the link between human sexuality and divine power. Tatian houses sexuality entirely in Aphrodite's temple, while Paul places marital sexual activity devoted to God in a biblical sanctuary set apart from idolatrous fornication. They both agree, though, that deities rule over sexuality and that the Lord must prevail against alien gods who lay competing claim to the sexual and reproductive capacities of his people. V. The Conflict Between Tatian's Stance and Core Biblical Teachings Tatian, with his persistent belief in Aphrodite, is not at odds with Paul alone. He undercuts the entire biblical tenet that fertility falls within God's domain. In biblical theology, there is no genuine god but God, and his power extends to ensuring and promoting the physical regeneration of his people. Genesis, the New Testament Pastoral Epistles, Hebrews, and Ephesians strongly encourage God's people to marry and multiply in his honour.54 Even the New Testament passages promoting sexual asceticism leave this mandate intact. Both Paul and Jesus' other 54 God's command 'Grow and multiply' presupposes that his people can and should make love and bear children in devotion to him, and Adam and Eve are the prototype couple to do so (Gen. 1:28; 9:1). In 1 Tim. 3:2-5 bishops should be married and have children. Ephesians 5:22-33 and Hebrews 13:4 likewise favour the practice of Christian marriage.</page><page sequence="23">50 KATHY L. G AC A celibate followers in Matthew concede that marital sexual intercourse is permissible for Christians, even though they favour sexual renunciation as their higher calling (i Cor. 7:7—9; Matt. 19:11). Pragmatically speaking, further, it makes good sense for the biblical God to issue a procreative dictate. If the power of sexual regeneration were left to alien gods, and yet the first commandment required God's people to worship no gods but the Lord, his people in principle could not reproduce and their deity would be short-lived and impotent in his religious influence, a lonely eunuch in the kingdom of heaven. God's normative influence, however, has been far-reaching largely because of the biblical imperative to grow and multiply for his glory. As far as Tatian is concerned, however, though the power of the biblical God is absolute (5.19-20), sexuality is an alien and malevolent divine force from which God is entirely removed. Aphrodite's invention of sexuality is not beyond God; it is beneath him. Tatian also overturns the biblical motive for distinguishing between sexual relations in the Lord and sexual fornication in worship of other gods. This distinction functions much like a negative advertisement campaign. It promotes biblically mono theistic sexual relations and reproduction by making the religious competition look bad—the wicked work of the devil, not the good work of God. Members of God's people who are sexually active must adopt the marital sexual behavior that allows them to remain within their denominational portion of the monotheistic circle.55 The campaign backfires, however, in the encratite Christian thought of Tatian, where Aphrodite still holds such sway that God neither has nor wants any share in the human procreative market and its fornicating method of reproduction. Clement of Alexandria criticizes Tatian precisely for failing to recognize that the permissible marital sexual relations of Christians are 'as far from fornication as God is from the devil' (Strom. 3.84.4).56 For Tatian and his fellow encatites, however, Christian marital sex is as far from God as Aphrodite is from God. The biblical terms for denigrating the religious competition as sexually fornicating idolatry come to absorb and define human sexual activity as a whole. 55 The respective circles, of course, are open to new members. Persons who convert and join a denomination in the Lord are welcome and they are generally eligible as spouses if single. 36 Clement has Tatian in mind here, for he mentions him by name at Strom. 3.81.1 and 3.82.2, and pointedly criticizes his encratite argument at Strom. 3.82.2 and 3.84.4.</page><page sequence="24">DRIVING APHRODITE FROM THE WORLD 51 VI. Conclusion Tatian's argument that Christians must renounce all sexual activity in order to follow God and become immortal develops from the turbulent encounter between two deeply rooted religious convictions about sexual activity. The first is the Greek belief that Aphrodite wields and embodies the power of sexuality, with human beings as her eager yet tormented slaves. The second is Paul's adaptation of the Pentateuchal teaching that Christians must avoid sexually fornicating idolatry or else fall away from God and suffer punitive death. For Tatian and his fellow encratite Christians, these two beliefs combine or, one might even say, collide to produce the innovative stance that sexual activity as a whole is unconditionally forbidden as idolatry and brings retribu tive mortality in its wake. Because Aphrodite's power is universal, all sexual activity is irretrievably idolatrous and deadly, including the fornicating ways of marital sexual intercourse. Tatian pro jects this encratite viewpoint onto Paul in his interpretation of ι Corinthians 7. Tatian reinforces his advocacy of sexual renunciation through his innovative use of Greek mythology and Stoic cosmology. In his religious myth, the Olympians long ago rebelled against the biblical God in order to infiltrate and infect the world and humanity. The gods have hitherto succeeded in their project of corruption because of the avid compliance of the Greeks, who abandoned God and championed the gods' rebellious cause. Since that time human beings have become mortally sexual rather than, as they ought to be, immortal and asexual—angels impervious to Aphrodite's whips of sexuality and death. To restore human nature to its eternal form, the gods must be overthrown, Aphrodite primarily. Tatian deploys Stoic natural science to describe the material process by which Aphrodite and the other gods carried out their coup against God. Zeus and his fellow Olympians took over the immanent spirit that informs matter constituting the world and human beings. Through their pre sence, they have inflicted bacchic disorder on God's good cosmic creation. Aphrodite with her lure of eroticism is the most cunning elemental maenad of them all, for she has brought countless human beings to the grave through sexual arousal, sexual activity, and reproduction. Christians must now fight back. To free them selves from the unnatural constraints of mortality, they must do away with αφροδίσια. Tatian's principle of sexual renunciation has not, of course, become the dominant mode of Christian sexual mores. Christianity</page><page sequence="25">52 KATHY L. GACA has built much of its religious populace through Christians marry ing and reproducing in various branches of the faith, just as Paul and other New Testament writers allow or encourage. In the second century ce, however, Aphrodite was still too vital a deity for there to be a painless transition in Greek Christian culture to believing that her sexual works can plausibly belong to God alone. Tatian and Christian encratites of like mind concurred with the Greeks that human sexuality was the goddess's counter part to Zeus's lightning bolt, not a biblically monotheistic proced ure to ward off the devil and produce children for God. While the Greeks felt compelled to surrender to her power with fervent trepidation, Tatian's encratite group felt equally driven to cast her down in order to avoid God's death-bearing wrath against sexual idolaters. Longing for immortal restoration with God, they attacked Aphrodite and everything about her fatal gift of erotic fire to humanity, including erotic poetry, lovemaking, and reproduction. Like a fanatic Diomedes, Tatian took the lead in this assault.37 Τ/ Τ Kathy L. Gaca 57 Many thanks to Jonathan E.
