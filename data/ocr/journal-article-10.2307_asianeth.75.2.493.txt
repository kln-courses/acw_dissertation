But what is it that is being recon- structed when we put the different fragments being put back together again? Now  Domenig is certainly aware that none of these societies existed outside of time—he  does aim to reconstruct a developmental sequence both of house design and of  religious belief. This can lead to some interesting suggestions about how people  respond to their own material culture. For example, he speculates that the tavu of  Tanimbar, in southern Maluku, an elaborately carved structure that often resembles  a person with outstretched arms, was not originally anthropomorphic. Rather, he  proposes that poles that had once been used for holding ceremonial cloths (an idea  he obtains from distant Borneo) came to be seen as resembling arms. This resem- blance led Tanimbarese to take the structure for a human figure, so when new ones  were carved, faces were added (300–22). Whether this is correct may be subject  to debate—but even that possibility reveals that people are always responding to  the affordances their material surroundings offer them, and on that basis they are  elaborating spandrels, producing skeuomorphs, and otherwise engaged in continu- ous invention and reinvention. If people are now constructing new worlds from the  fragments of prior ones, why should we assume this was any different in the past?

One MigHT think that Intimate Distance: Andean Music in Japan is a mono- graph on musical adoption and localization along the lines of the phenomenon  of western music in Japan (GaLLianO 2002), jazz in Japan (ATkinS 2001), or  reggae in Japan (STeRLing 2010), to give just three examples in a world of rapid  global flows and complex musical identities. However, with this book, Michelle  Bigenho offers a perspective that explores not only such localization and adoption  from different locations, but also an ethnography of touring Bolivian musicians  </page> <page sequence="2"> 494 | Asian Ethnology 75/2 • 2016 to Japan. For Bigenho, central to such modern-day social and musical movement  are the ways that intimacy is produced between two cultures that are geographi- cally distant.  The book is structured with seven chapters. The main discussion in found in  chapters 2 to 6, which explore topics such as indigeneity, otherness, work, value,  intimate distance, and gringa (female foreigner in Latin America). In chapter 1, the  author outlines her role in the book: author and subject in terms of being a per- former in the Bolivian musical band, Música de Maestros (Music of the Masters),  that tours in Japan. For the author, Professor of Anthropology and Latin American  Studies at Hampshire College, the book’s main aim is to comprehend what it means  to play music that “is a mere crumb in a musical smorgasbord” (12) of consumed  global styles in Japan that is not necessarily one’s own, for Bolivians, Japanese, or  the author: “that pull of desire toward difference and the contrasting distance that  one still maintains while taking on the cultural trappings of an Other, about the  multiple and contrasting stories of intimate distance” (2).  Bigenho includes much discussion on the theme of indigeneity throughout the  book. Noting that 62 percent of Bolivians claims to be indigenous, the author ex- plores links between notions of indigenous between Japan and this South American  nation. However, the subject of indigeneity is given special attention in chapter 2.  Particular regard is given to the idea that through a “Bolivian-Japanese nexus of  Andean music” where music “is mediated through Western frameworks,” “both  Bolivians and Japanese represent cases of non-indigenous people staging Bolivian  indegeneity” (34). In this chapter there is a discussion of some of the pathways  that Andean music has taken to reach Japan, including Simon and Garfunkel’s bor- rowing of “El condor pasa” in the 1960s. Bigenho explores indigeneity from many  angles, such as in Bolivia and as it is staged in Japan.  The author’s ethnographic account of touring in Japan is continued in chapters  3 and 4 with a discussion of work and value in performing musical otherness,  which includes intimate distance through transnational exchanges and a context of  a flourishing musical economy where difference is at the core (albeit with Andean  music comprising just a fragment of this). Chapter 4 provides a fascinating account  of how a Japanese enthusiast of Bolivian music came to be so engaged with the  field that they eventually joined a band in Bolivia, recording there and in Japan.  Here, the author explores the notion of identity, both in Bolivia and in Japan.  Chapter 5 is about intimate distance—“the way both Japanese and Bolivians  claimed closeness with and distance from the others with whom they engaged in  a musical intersection of transnational music performance” (123). The discussion  of cultural flows and identity in the chapter is extremely interesting and offers the  reader a glimpse into some of the complexities of a micro music in Japan on the  one hand, yet at the same time having much meaning and significance that offers a  case study on aspects of transnationalism.  The last main chapter before the conclusion offers a study of gringa in Japan,  reflecting on the author’s fieldwork and experience in the study. This chapter mixes  theory, ethnography, and reflection, and serves as a case study on what the author  calls “inter-area ethnography” (166).  </page> <page sequence="3">  ReviewS | 495 Intimate Distance is very much an exploration in the anthropology of music.  The ethnography offered by the author includes a multidimensional approach of  participant observation as a performer with study of different locations, society,  and culture in Japan and Bolivia, as well as a reflexive analytical research method  that entwines the text within many personal perspectives on the subject matter.  The book includes some useful black and white photographs, as well as endnotes,  bibliography, and index. Overall, Bigenho has produced an intriguing study in  musical ethnography that takes the field to new heights in the contemporary era. It  will be of interest to ethnomusicologists, cultural anthropologists, and those with  an interest in Japan and/or Bolivia more broadly.  ReFeRenceS ATkinS, E.

YOSHikO KawaSHiMa (1907–1948) is one of the most interesting characters to  evolve during the brutal years of the 1930s and 1940s when Japan invaded China  and sought to become the new powerhouse in East Asia. Born Aisin Gioro Xianyu,  she began her life in Beijing at the tail end of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). She  was the fourteenth daughter of a Manchu prince whose ultimately failed goal was  to stage a coup d’état to restore the Manchus to power. He had thirty-eight chil- dren, so he sent his daughter to Japan to be raised by a Japanese political fanatic,  Naniwa Kawashima, who promoted his causes. As Yoshiko Kawashima she settled  down in her adopted country, but throughout her life she could never really decide  whether she was really Chinese, Manchu, or Japanese. Naniwa Kawashima raised Yoshiko as a young Japanese girl, but he never listed  her in the family register which would have given her Japanese citizenship. Yoshiko  </page> </plain_text>
