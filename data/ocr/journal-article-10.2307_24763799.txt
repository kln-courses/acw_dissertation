<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE GREEK ENLIGHTENMENT TO THE INTELLECTUAL QUEST FOR RELIGION J,P. MOSTERT It is generally agreed that the cradle of an autonomous Religionswissensehaft can be located in that imposing palace of reason erected tcwards the end of the nineteenth century (sate adding that the location was in its "left wing"), the legitimate child of the eighteenth century Enlightenment. Certainly reason was moving in its own "fulness of time". Having attained full autonomy after emancipation frcm all authoritarian entanglements, it was putting - by means of the scientific method - the injunc tion of Galileo Galilei into practice : "Measure everything which is measurable and reduce the things which will not admit of measurement to indirect nveasursr*ant."(l) A strategic position was assumed by the reflective consciousness in which the totality of existence was brought within the confines of rational explanation. Intellectual inquiry was probing the massive structure of religion, secretly maintaining that empiri cal scrutiny will eventually reveal it as a purely human reality, a cultural expression or a constitutive element of human con sciousness . That something tremendously important happened to man's conscious grasp of religion under these circumstances is abun dantly clear. Even if the charge of the desire for outright rational explanation were discounted, there still rsnains the new venture of verstehen initiated by Dilthey, Spranger and Weber as applied in phencmenolgy to religion. The decisive intellectual thrust of the nineteenth century regarding religion cannot be denied. Hcwever we must not be hypnotized to such an extent by the intellectual giants of that time that we fail to grasp the truth that their efforts were in a certain sense an inevitable fruit of an earlier mutation in the history of human consciousness which determined a structure of existence in entoryo. The aim of this article is to illustrate the connection between that earlier mutation and the nineteenth century intellectual quest for religion leading to the rise of the Science of Religion. The development of consciousness in highlighted by a fw decisive mutations in history. These mutations must not be 66</page><page sequence="2">67 confused with the results of an evolutionary process. They are rather each by themselves original existential awarenesses assuming such central positions in man's consciousness that they serve as bases for structuring existence in a unique way, issuing in new approaches to reality. According to Ratzinger these mutations are responsible for anancipating man frcm the universal grasp of the archaic (primitive) religious mentality.(2) He mentions the monotheistic revolution and mysticism as the two decisive mutations in human religious consciousness. Each of these are separate ways along which man departed from under the mythical firmament which enveloped his existence, each inspired by its own Central Religious Awareness structuring the totality of his existence in a specific way. The same emancipation was, however, also effected by a third novum in the history of consciousness. Strictly speaking, this does not form a part of the history of religions, as Ratzinger indeed remarks. On the contrary, its intention is precisely to make an end to that history as something which has been made transparently redundant. By way of introduction it can be stated that the origin of this emancipation lies in the super seding or transformation of a specific ethos, expressed as religious existence, by a new intercourse between consciousness and reality. It is based on intellectual inquiry at a remove frcm inmediate experience, which I would call a new strategy of rational consciousness, making its first appearance in ancient Greece. Discovering in the reflective consciousness a lumen naturale with which it could illuminate reality, it presses on wards to the point of achieving total conceptual transparency. As such it was a strategy which would not find its completion in Greek thinking, but would imperialistically spread its pcwer or grip until it could "enlighten" everything - also the Central Awareness or religion as it understood it. It is within this context that the anthropologization of religion must eventually be understood. This historic novum can in a certain sense also be charac terized as a "central awareness", but only if understood as an awareness of consciousness itself, the pcwer of Gnome, reflective thought. I have called this new point of orientation over against reality Logon didonai,(3) the principle of rational ex planation. Although in origin this new orientation is usually connected with the Ionians Thales, Anaximander and Anaximines, finding its locus standi in the Logos doctrine of Heraclitus of Ephesus, its roots go back much further. Gusdorf remarks that the fascination astrobiology held for ancient Middle Eastern societies shows a movement in the otherwise rigid archetypal world-view: life was scmshow connected to experience.(4) Hesiod's theogony shows a type of causal thinking and Hater recounts nyths as interesting stories and not as ritual re</page><page sequence="3">68 enactment. There is thus something in these thinkers of the mytho-poeic age which is already straining against the grip of the mytho-poeic mind. Hie way they "go behind" the contingent world with its hierophanic qualities and construct an order in that background goes a bit further than pure nythology, althouc^i in their expressions they still remain firmly within the rt^thi cal horizon. Myth is, of course, an expression of rational man. It is the way ancient man answers inescapable ontological and existen tial questions. But once again, it reveals a very specific node of thinking: thought patterns and endeictic expression which reflect an intimate involvement in the life of the cosmos and the nystery confronting man. In the Greek thinkers of Miletus and their inxnediate successors there appears a radical break with the node of thinking which prevailed in the ancient world.(5) In than, there occurred a remarkable mutation - one of only a few - in the consciousness of the human species, the birth of what has been mentioned before: the Logon didonai principle. 1 THE LOGON DIDONAI PRINCIPLE The dynamic of this principle is perhaps best illustrated in the way it enabled the Ionic physikoi, as Aristotle called them, to escape frcm that cosmic coercion which characterized the life of ancient societies. They dispassionately started to assume a removed position frcm the grip of the nystery of the world of contingent things and interested thanselves in origins. Going behind the world of contingent happenings they questioned their phusis and their arche, their nature and their ground.(6) The answers they produced were furnished by reflective con sciousness functioning abstractly and on the basis of the cold logic of the rational process. Furthermore, these answers also built on the faith or conviction that the order of reality corresponds to rational principles which can be fathomed by the h\anan intellect. "It transforms the problem of nature frcm the realm of faith in poetic intuition to the intellectual sphere."(7) The few phrases left to us of the thought of Thales, the first of these thinkers, via Aristotle, already indicate clearly the new strategy of consciousness. "There must be", he declared, "seme natural body (phusis), one or many frcm which all things arise." And Thales, according to Aristotle, called it water.(8) The novum in this statanent is not only that the origin is expressed unrnythologically (water) , but that it is logically deduced, the abstraction being inherent in the words: "there</page><page sequence="4">69 must be". This spells out a new strategy in determining the origin and essence of things. This is borne out by the irrmediate successors of Thales - Anaximander and Anaximines. On perfectly logical grounds, Anaximander, grasping the incon sistency in Thales" statement,(9) cams to the conclusion that the arche should be boundless. And he calls it Apeiron. Quite consistently too, he ascribed no origin or genesis to this Apeiron, deducing frcm the idea of ultimacy that it must enccm pass "all worlds" and that it mast be "eternal and ageless". Even at this early stage it is clear that the nystery of the origin has been superseded by the autonomy of thought. The Logon didonai principle raises consciousness up above concrete reality, driven by an appeal for consistency. Herein lies the origin of a new universe of meaning: the principle of explain ing reality in terms of a known, conceptionally transparent entity by force of logical consistency. "Once a theory is adopted," comments Frankfort, "it is followed up to its ultimate end, irrespective of its conflicts with observed facts."(10) The new strategy of consciousness would quickly strengthen its hold on Greek mentality. With Heraclitus, it already attains classical expression. With him, as is well known, the substance or arche which is the cause of everything, is Eternal Fire (panta rei) , and its dynamic principle is the Logos. "Everything," he stated, "happens according to this Logos."(11) This Logos is eventually nothing else than the cosmic law, an all-directing rational principle. Reality has a Logos-structure, an intelligible foundation. In man himself there is a spark of this Eternal Fire, the psyche, or soul, and the psyche is essen tially identical with this World Reason. Thus man can have true knowledge about the arche. "Wisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all thoughts through all things are guided."(12) Man, therefore, does not have knowledge as a result of his ccnmunion with contingent things (anpirical ex perience) , but as a result of that with which he has the most constant intercourse - the Logos in man himself. Man is still, as the archaic structure painted him, a microcosmos but now, on the basis of identity which rests in the intellect, the mystery has departed in a transparent intelligibility. With that the Logon Didonai principle has won a ccnmanding position for man in relation to reality. What the man of archaic society experiences as kratophany, what is bestowed on man in the nonotheistic structure as gift, the man of the Logon didonai principle makes accessible and transparent for himself in rational explanation. In this way man is emancipated from the coercion of the archaic structure. He has been freed from the grip of myth. In fact, what it amounts to is nothing less than what the Sophists somewhat later would preach: that man is the measure</page><page sequence="5">70 of all things, also of religion. 2 TO THEION - THE DIVINE Anaximander provides us with a typical exanple of the change which the new structure of meaning creates in the language it employs. A statarent attributed to him reads: "The Apeiron itself seems to be the first principle of all other things and to surround all and direct all ... There are no other causes besides the Apeiron but that it is itself divine, for it is inmortal, and indestructible."(13) It is important to note carefully the language Anaximander uses. "God" (Ho Theos) becomes "the divine"(To Theion). Not that the word was unknown until that time; it was certainly known and currently used. But the important fact is that the divine was given a profile by reflective consciousness by means of logical deduction and that this profile coincided with that of religion. In another saying he starts with the material world and develops on the basis of rational deduction the idea of an arahe as Eternal Fire and then he ends by saying: kai tout' einai to theion ("and that must be the divine"). The operative word here is "must", showing that Anaximander arrived at the idea of an arohe through a process of rational deduction. But what anounts to an even more epoch-making intellectual exercise is the fact that he transfers the predi cates which Hesiod and Hcmer attributed to the traditonal deities to the first principle of Being. Anaximander's Apeiron beccmes "imrortal", "indestructible", "divine". Ascribing predicates to God or the gods is an inherent dimension in the expression of religious relationship and exper ience. This is apparent in the myths and symbols in the archaic structure as well as the testimonies in the Judaeo-Christian structure. But within these two structures the source and the direction radically differ from those in the philosophical approach. In the monotheistic structure, for example, the source is the historical Word and Deeds of God and the Name translates itself in terms of an historical and social framework. Yahweh is King, Saviour, Shepherd, Judge, etc. Van Elzwijk says: "The divine action is always an act of majesty, autonomy, of power; it controls and directs everything."(14) It calls men to worship and witness. With the Milesians and their successors the process goes in the opposite direction. Man with his profiling mechanism, the ratio, occupies the primary position. Through the activity of the Logon didonai principle, predicates are attributed to the arche by the ratio relying on its inherent rational dynamic and</page><page sequence="6">71 the strategic position man had acquired over against reality. This strategic position is characterized by man's withdrawal fran presence and mystery into autonomous thought. Of course man remains fascinated by the riddle of existence but his ccrrmitment or his relationship to it has been contained within the horizon of intelligibility. 3 THE EXPLANATION OF RELIGION In principle the Apeiron of Anaximander already liquidated the traditional anthropomorphic representations in religion as Hesiod and Homer conceived than. As "infinite" and "boundless" the arohe could not be contained in the form of an individual god. Neither was the solution within the archaic structure, namely a multiplicity of gods, an adequate answer. The Milesians, however, left us no records to allow the deduction that they themselves militantly opposed the existing religious representations. Soon, however, the critical side of the new philosophy would show itself in its theological implications. The newly designed cosmology of the Ionians takes on a destructive role with reference to religious representations in Xenophon's thought. Xenophon realized that if Anaximander were correct, then Hesiod and Hcmer's anthropomorphisms should be recognized as nothing else than "projections". He applies his own brand of satire on these analogies: "If oxen and lions had hands and could paint with their hands and fashion images as men do, they would make pictures and images as men do; they would make pictures and images of their gods in their own likeness: horses would make them like horses and oxen like oxen." (15) This satire was not meant, however, as an attenpt to intro duce a form of atheism, or to abolish religion. The status of the polis gods shews very little change under the onslaught of philosophy. Xenophon understood his own critique in a sense as a defence of the godhead. When the Sophists and the Atcmists appeared on the scene, however, the situation would change dramatically. Religion and with it the existence of the gods as such would fall prey to the probing light of the Logon didonai principle. Jaeger says: "In its final phase the rise of philosophical religion leads to the problem of religion itself - the problem of accounting for the universal dispersion of the idea of God and of discovering its sources." (16) I want to illustrate this by way of two examples: that of the atcmist Democritus and that of the sophist Critias. Democritus, one of the phusikoi, wrestled with the problsn</page><page sequence="7">72 of God on epistemological grounds. Reality, for him, is the interplay of countless atcms in space ruled by the power of chance. This obviously put paid to any idea of an arche which could be connected with a religious object. Therefore Dgno critus had to furnish an explanation for the religious ideas of mankind - which no one could deny. He offers two types of explanations: a "physiological" one and a "psychological" one. The physiological explanation can prises the existence of physical images (eidola) . These eidola arise frcm sensory stimulation by fine particles of physical objects. These stimulations cause the dreams and the visions of the ancients and the spirits which appeared in them. According to Democritus this was the origin of the gods which gave rise to religious practices. The operation and power of the Logon didonai principle mani fests itself here in the explanation given regarding the existence of gods. But it goes further. It is significant that the origin of religious objects is explained in terms of man - in this case as a result of a physical process in man. It is true that the existence of gods is not denied altogether, or that religion is not rejected as meaningless. But, Jaeger puts it, "the gods were relegated to a twilight realm of materialized psychical phencmsna". (17 ) A theme is thus intro duced into the history of religious thought which would later be taken up with far-reaching effect. It is well to remenber that the doctoral dissertation of Karl Marx covered the thinking of Democritus and Epicurus. Democritus was also the founder of a theory of religion which would later beccme a keystone in the work of psychologists, name ly that fear is the seed of religion. According to his second theory cosmic powers which man has to face in his everyday struggle for existence could either have a benevolent or des tructive effect on him. Man therefore naturally reacts to them in terms of respect, dependence and fear. Furthermore, these pcwers are not always external to man; he also has to contend with internal forces like a bad conscience, fear of retribution, etc., which create a conscious and unconscious anxiety. All these lead man to dependence on those powers and the taking of protective measures against them, which is what religion is about. Fear is the creator of the gods - a position which is not much different frcm that of Freud seme two thousand years later. The Sophists approached the problem of religion frcm another angle although Prodicus also gave a naturalistic explanation of religion, like Dsnocritus. Their point of departure was anthropological frcm the very beginning. With them man stands squarely in the centre. The spirit of their philosophy is best expressed in their well known statement: "Man is the measure</page><page sequence="8">73 of all things; of things that are as they are and of things that are not as they are not." In this light Critias saw religion as a humanly-devised instrument which helps to curb man's inherent pleasure-seeking and pain-avoiding nature. He makes his "Wise Man" spell it out in the following way : "There exists a demon who abounds with deathless life And he will hear all things that mortals speak, And he can watch all things that they may do, And if you plan sctne secret devilry This will never escape the gods ... Such were the consternating fears he sent To man, and such the means by which the gods Were settled in their proper place. (A pretty trick accomplished in a word); And thus he quenched out lawlessness with law." (18) Functionally religion has a place in society, namely to "quench out lawlessness with law", but essentially it can lay no claim to truth. Even if we take the view of Critias as an exception, then it must still be acknowledged that the Sophists relied on their intellect for their pronounced scepticism regarding religion. Protagoras proves this well in the follow ing quotation: "With regard to the gods, I do not knew whether they exist or not or what they are like. Many things prevent our knowing." (19) Before the end of the classical era, the Logon didonai principle would manifest itself in many explanations of religion. Specially to be mentioned is that of Euhanerus (C330-260) who offered a pseudo-historical explanation in The Sacred Scripture. According to him religion goes back on the influence exerted by great kings and heroes after their death on their erstwhile subjects. The aim of these remarks, however, is not to give a ccmpre hensive revise of such interpretations - which in any case are well known - but simply to indicate the course of development which the Logon didonai principle, as strategy of reason, would follow. In the history of thought this would beccme a well trodden highway. If I have created the impression in the foregoing that the thinking of classical antiquity emancipated the ancient world fran the grip of religion, or that Greek religiosity died an early death at its hands, I hasten to correct that impression. The negative attitude of the Sophists contrasted, for example, with the nore positive spirit of Platonic philosophy. In a sense "God", interpreted by Plato as the Idea of the Good, was</page><page sequence="9">74 meant to attain a central position in the life of the canmunity. But even in terms of a positive approach, the Logon didonai prin ciple took its toll. For the Platonic "God" is a construction of reason. The important result of all this is that while the intelli gible nature of ultimate reality had been established in this way, all the possible links with this reality could also be subject to rational illumination. Religion which professes a relationship with ultimate reality as envisaged by these philosophers, could not escape this implication. And this, to ray mind is what links the fourth century B.C. to the nineteenth century A.D. The spirit of the nineteenth century was developing a strategy established by the early Greek philosophers. Even when the wiser spirits of the century realized that the Logon didonai principle was no simple key to unlock the ultimate mystery of religion, the radical limitation of the study of religion to its empirical elements in the Science of Religion betrays the seductive power of that principle. To eliminate all misunderstanding, it must be made clear that a scientific interest in religion concentrating on the empirical elements in religion - the roots of which are to be found in the fourth century Greek enlightenment - is both possible and neces sary. It is possible in so far as there exists an empirically manifested Welt der Religion which can be studied even by the non-participant. It is also necessary because an approach to religion is needed in which the antoncmous character of religion and its non-reducibility can be illustrated rationally and therefore critically. Hcwever it must always be kept in mind that such scientific interest cannot, in Heiler's words "do justice to the experiences of transcendental realities".(20) A methodology which builds on the empirical in religion cannot exhaust the religious phenomenon in its complexity. In that sense both the Greek enlightenment and its nineteenth century projection were wrong. REFERENCES 1 H. Hoffding, A Brief History of Modern Philosophy, Tr. B.E.

These words are subject to much dis cussion and difference among classical scholars. Jaeger insists that the term phusis as it appeared in the Milesian heritage has the meaning of "origin" (also "development"). The Greek verb phuomai is thus taken to mean : "to bring forth" or "to grew". Cf. W.Jaeger, The Theology of the Early Greek Thinkers, Oxford, CUP, 1945, p.198. Burnet, on the other hand, relying on Aristotle, who called the atcms phusis, thinks that it meant "nature" (of things). J.Burnet, op.cit., p.27. Arche is just as problematical. It is possible that the Milesians did not use the term at all. The Neo-Platonist Simplicius mentions Anaximander as source of the term; then the meaning would most likely have been ground or substance. He relies however on Aristotle and in that case the meaning should be principle. 7 H. and H.A.Frankfort et.al., Before Philosophy, Baltimore, Penguin Books, 1971, p.251. 8 Aristotle, Metaphysics, I, 3, 983, b, 6. 9 The arche could not be a substance of a single nature, because then the obvious plurality in the world could not be accounted for. 10 H. and H.A.Frankfort, op. cit., p.253. 11 C.M.Bakewell, Sourcebook in Ancient Philosophy, Narf York, Scribner, 1909, p.28. 12 Ibid., p.30. 13 Aristotle, Physics, I, 4, 187,(a), 19. 14 H.C.van Elzwijk, "Het Godsdienstig Denken in de oudste Filosofie" in R.W.Thuijs (Ed), Mens en God, Utrecht, Bijleveld, 1963, p.118.</page><page sequence="11">76 15 Ibid., p.58. 16 W.Jaeger, op.cit., p.176. 17 Ibid., p.180. 18 Ibid., p.187. 19 C.M.Bakewell, op.cit., p.67. 20 Cited by J.Waardenburg, Classical Approaches to the Study of Religion, The Hague, Mouton, 1973, p.474.
