STEPHANIE BARB? HAMMER 153 Within a broadly competent framework, this essay sketches a revisionist reading ofFriedrich Schiller's dramas against a cluster of concerns: the nostalgia for childhood, the obsession with return, history as repetition, and the paradoxes of homosocial masculinity. A discussion of Die Riiuber, Die Ver- schwisrung des Fiesco zu Genua, and the Wallenstein trilogy, in conjunction with Russell Hoban's science fiction novel Riddley Walker and the Terminator films, yields a new understanding of Schiller: he was both a quintessentially modern writer, whose use of time foreshadows the temporal preoccupa- tions of 20th-century Western culture, and an important critic of history as a violent and violently gendered masculine construction. "Fortunati Wtinschhtitlein und Gliucksstickel" in neuem Gewand: Adelbert von Chamissos Peter Schlemihl ..... ANNEMARIE WAMBACH 173 In selecting Schlemihl's seduction by "Fortunati Gliickssaickel" as the central event in Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte, Chamisso reintroduces a theme of the much earlier novel Fortunatus. A con- trastive juxtaposition of these two narratives reveals a sociological and psychological emphasis in Cha- misso's work. Because of his idealism, Schlemihl's attempt to fit into society by acquiring the "Sackel" is doomed to failure. He overcomes his inner conflict by adopting a realistic approach to the problems of society and abandoning the "Saickel." Unlike him, the more pragmatic Fortunatus learns to live with his "money bag." A comparison of the two works, from this perspective, provides a broader understanding of Peter Schlernihls wundersame Geschichte. In Defense of Narcissus: Lou Andreas-Salom6 and Julia Kristeva ...................... KARLA SCHULTZ 185 The elusive figure of Narcissus plays an emancipatory role in key writings of both Lou Andreas-Salom6 and Julia Kristeva, bridging the gap between turn-of-the-century vitalism and contemporary psycho- linguistic theory. Each writer, in the discourse of her time, rehabilitates a psychic structure that questions, through its pre-oedipal ambivalence and free play ofthe imagination, assigned identities and fixed subject positions in language. Utopian Visions: Bloch, Lukaics, Pontoppidan ....... LILIANE WEISSBERG 197 Despite the prominence of its author-Pontoppidan won the Nobel Prize in 1917-and the prominent place of the discussion of this work in Lukcs's study, little attention has been paid to the relevance of Lykke-Per to Lukcs's Theorie des Romans. This essay argues that Lykke-Per served, indeed, as a kind ofblueprint for Lukics's book, which seems to follow the novel's structure. Pontoppidan's work was also influential for the early writings of Ernst Bloch, with whom Lukcs corresponded and discussed his work at that time. Following the traces of Pontoppidan's novel in the pre-Marxist writings of LukAcs</page><page sequence="6">iv THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Spring 1994 and Bloch, the essay finally produces a constellation of texts that may mark their authors' early definitions of "utopia." Kiamotten: Reading Nietzsche Reading Kafka .......... LINDA C. HSU 211 This paper discusses the intertextual connections between Franz Kafka's Das Schilop and Friedrich Nietzsche's essay "Uber Wahrheit und Luge im auBlermoralischen Sinne." When one approaches Kafka's text as an enactment ofNietzsche's ideas on metaphor, truth, and lies, Kafka's"poetics ofsurface"becomes apparent. In particular, his use of the metaphor of clothing demonstrates Nietzsche's understanding of language as inescapably anthropomorphic. Further, the referent of"clothes" establishes the significance of the relationship between K. and the "HerrenhofWirtin" for a reading of Kafka's novel. Hoffmann's Das Fridulein von Scuderi and Siiskind's Das Parfum: Elements of Homage in a Postmodernist Parody of a Romantic Artist Story ....... R. G. WHITINGER AND M. HERZOG 222 Patrick SUiskind's Das Parfiim is not the random cannibalization of earlier texts that many reviewers and critics ofpostmodernism have taken it to be. Nor does it simplistically ridicule the E.TA. Hoffmann story to which it alludes so frequently from its opening sentence onward. Rather, its parodic dialogue with Das FiWiulein von Scuderi entails a strong component of deference and homage to that Romantic artist story. This essay credits Hoffmann for developing a parodic and self-conscious view of the potentials and limits of art that Siiskind acknowledges and then carries to postmodern extremes. Zwei glatt, zwei kraus: Revolutionaire (Un)Geduld und La durde. Stricken in der Literatur als Ausdruck bestimmter Seinsmodalittiten . . . IRMGARD ELSNER HUNT 235 This article situates images of knitting women in literary depictions within Henri Bergson's philosophy of existence. Just what kind of "Lebensgefiihl," modes of being, and experiences of time are expressed in the activity of knitting? A traditional woman's role, patience and self-sacrifice, is shown by the knitter in Virginia Woolfs view; revolutionary patience or impatience stirs the knitting women in works linked to the motif of the French Revolution (Charles Dickens, Georg Biichner, Georg Heym, Heiner Miiller, Urs Jaeggi); Gunter Grass portrays calm endurance in a knitter who sustains her own as well as her partner's existence in one novel, and revolutionary (im)patience in a group ofknitting feminists seeking their utopia, in another. All these modes ofbeing are based on a specific experience of time and, thereby, of the self in its flowing through time, as described in the Bergsonian philosophy of la duree.
