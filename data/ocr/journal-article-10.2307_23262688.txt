<plain_text><page sequence="1"></page><page sequence="2">HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS Volume 21:1—1995 INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY, POSTMODERNITY AND ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY Arne Naess THE HUMAN CONDITION It is a trait which belongs to humans, and only humans as far as we know, to try to get a kind of survey of their existence, to sort out what is of primary value and what is more or less indifferent; what they basically need and what are just whimsical wishes. On their way to decrease their own whimsicality and thoughtlessness, people in industrial societies like to see what problems others in other kinds of cultures have been or still are grappling with. This leads inevitably to rather broad and general talk, not only "small narratives"—a much cherished term in "deconstructive postmodernist literature." It leads to investigations which are immense in their breadth of perspective and to results that are always open to doubt and correction. What follows reflects some thoughts by two sorts of humans, those that for many years lived in a non-industrial country and those that have spent many years together with tiny living creatures in grand mountains. Both are, in a sense, products of modern Western industrial societies—but not mere products. Because the reflections cover a vast terrain, they lack the elaboration and concreteness which we need in our attempts to understand and modify our behavior in concrete situations. Comparing non-industrial with industrial societies, including the fate of local communities, it seems clear that many of the non-industrialized societies have shown a continuity and strength that the industrialized societies 131</page><page sequence="3">132 Industrial Society, Postmodernity.. cannot hope to achieve because industrial societies are unsustainable ecologically. The industrialized societies also seem unable to stop ethical erosion, and the increase of criminality, including those of the age group between 8 16. Surveying the situation today, the attraction of material richness and technical smartness of the industrial societies among the young people in non-industrial societies is overwhelming. This situation is tragic for at least two reasons: it would be ecologically catastrophic to have five billion people on the way behaving like people in the industrial societies. And it is unrealistic to expect that substantially increasing material affluence can be reached without unacceptable levels of criminality and the erosion of the feeling of fellowship and mutual dependence. Using the term "modern" to relate to the emergence of the culture of the industrial countries, one may still hope that the present non-industrial societies will make a development from premodern to postmodern cultures. The development of the industrial societies has brought humanity into a blind alley. The postmodern state of affairs implies satisfaction of the vital economic needs of the total population, but not affluence. Key slogan: enough is enough. When vital economic needs are satisfied there is enough in terms of material richness. But, of course, there are other forms of richness—in principal limitless richness. The near future of the industrial countries, let us say, the period from 1995-2045, should be colored by stopping the increase of the use of energy, and of material production, until a level is reached that might be reached by the total human population without the danger of gigantic catastrophes. The next is to reach full ecological sustainabiiity. In the years after World War II, a mighty slogan asked for a vast increase (mostly material) in production. When production and productivity in the richest countries soared as never before, a new powerful slogan appeared: "Consume! Consume!" because of overproduction. Today this reason is replaced by an appeal to consume in order to overcome unemployment. The notorious appeal of the retail analyst Victor Lebow promoted consumption to relieve overproduction, but otherwise it provides an amusing picture of the strange sort of economy prevalent HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1-1995</page><page sequence="4">Arne Naess 133 in the highly industrialized countries. Lebow asserted, "Our enormously productive economy...demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption...we need things consumed, burnt up, worn out, replaced, and discarded at an ever increasing rate" (Duming 1991:153 169).1 The contribution to the ecological crisis by a minority of half a billion people has been of such an order that an acceptable level of interference in the ecosystems by 10 times as many people must be very much smaller per half billion. In the near future, "the total unecological product" created yearly by the industrial countries should be of an order such that multiplied by 10, it would not point toward gigantic catastrophes. If we call the sum total of unecological consequences by production "iPJ and that of consumption "iC^" and the number of people N, the total unecological consequences of policies "zU" may be put into a form looking like an equation: EU = (zPu + iCJ + N The sum U may be that of a local community, a region, a country or that of humanity in general. Applied to the industrial societies, their iU should not be greater than 10 percent of the total iU. Without substantial progress occurring each year in the industrial societies towards that goal, it will be difficult to accomplish.2 As a firm supporter of the deep ecology movement, I hold that a decrease in consumption and a slow decrease in population will not necessarily result in a decrease in quality of life. There will be a transition period where some people living according to the slogan "enough is never enough" will have difficulties, but provided the down-scaling is effectuated with a strong sense of justice, one may not see major uprisings. It is an indication of narrow time perspective when people reject the idea of a slow decrease in population because there will be too many old, unproductive people compared to younger productive ones. The undesired ratio will only make itself felt for a short time of transition and the perspective we need covers hundreds of years. HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1—1995</page><page sequence="5">134 Industrial Society, Postmodernity.. DISRESPECT OF ONE'S OWN NON-INDUSTRIAL CULTURES Since World War II, the general disrespect in the West of non-industrial cultures has changed into deep and serious respect among an increasing minority. But in the same period disrespect in the non-industrial cultures of their own culture seems to have increased formidably, especially among the young. It has to do with an equally formidable increase of tourism and smart sales campaigns, which are among the other factors contributing to this. Depreciation is often expressed in front of representatives of the West. In Beding and other Sherpa communities of Garwal Himalaya, monks had libraries of old Tibetan scripts, for instance prayers directed to Tseringma ("the long good life's mother"), a formidable 7,146 meter high peak directly above the village. The villagers in the 1950s and 1960s showed reluctance to admit that they had such things. People hid such documents as shameful signs of backwardness. They were ashamed of their many hundred- (or thousand-?) year old tradition of a cult of holy mountains. Their daily prayers to the mountain were beautifully written down and until this century regarded as treasures. How were scholars able to obtain such old documents? Buying them? No—by living among the families and showing respect. Then they could get the old scrolls as gifts. Otherwise, the scrolls might be destroyed. Depreciation of one's own local or regional culture may be a worldwide phenomenon among young people, but nothing known in human history can be compared to what is happening in our days. Traditional cultures everywhere are under severe pressure—mostly with fatal results. Disrespect of one's own culture includes disrespect of the land. The forest was respected and no living tree was cut down for fuel in the Beding area and other Sherpa areas of Nepal. Each tree was looked upon as something that had its own life, its own interest, and its own dignity. With the breakdown of customs, this deep ecology attitude vanished. The enormous expeditions increased the mobility of the Sherpas who were hired in the thousands to carry—and often to heat water using wood—for daily hot showers for the sahibs. It generated completely different HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1-1995</page><page sequence="6">Arne Naess 135 attitudes toward mountains and forests. Disrespect of holiness, purely instrumental attitudes toward "timber," "wood," and "fuel." Deforestation above 9,000 feet started in earnest. Without trees as cover, erosion started on a grand scale. Now practically nothing is left. Nepal started as an "export country": exporting hundreds of millions of tons of soil to India. The rivers brought much of the soil to the Indian big dams largely built through misguided efforts at "development," filling them with silt. With no cultural restraints combined with little Western scientific knowledge, the destruction of Nepal gradually reached gigantic proportions. Immigration from the countryside to the city of Kathmandu accelerated. The young were not willing to walk all day for fuel. They would rather live without dignity in Kathmandu. A young, exceptionally gifted Sherpa who had been with many expeditions got the opportunity to start a sports shop in Canada, but went back to his own country after a while. He expressed in a few words the reason for going back: "Here we enjoy peace with ourselves." So many of the people he met on expeditions, and in Canada evidently had no peace within themselves. Peace with others, perhaps, but not inside themselves. They wished to be different from what they were; they worked hard to develop, achieve, succeed, and be better. They could not let time flow. Unfortunately, very few young people have the necessary faculty of independent judgment, and have the opportunity to compare Western quality of life with their own in their "poor" countries. I am not referring to the half billion people in non-industrial countries who are desperately poor, who lack the most basic means to live a decent life. WESTERN BELIEF THAT WE PROJECT PERSONAL TRAITS INTO NATURAL OBJECTS In traditional, non-industrial societies we find more and stronger "personification" of natural forces and non-human living beings. The tendency to personification is often said to be "archaic," meaning that it precedes the great religions and cultures. The term "anthropomorphism" is often used in a pejorative sense for erroneous attributing traits which are specific for humans to entities which are not human, HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1—1995</page><page sequence="7">136 Industrial Society, Postmodernity.. or not even capable of sense experience. Before starting to drink beer together, the Sherpas threw a little beer in the direction of Tserigma—beer for her. If a big mountain precipice may be spontaneously experienced as dark and evil it is, in an important sense, dark and evil. But if this experience motivates us in the West to throw a stone at the mountain as a punishment for being evil, we have succumbed to a mistake. In a non industrial culture throwing beer or a stone is meaningful—or was meaningfut—but not within our conceptual framework. Animals, plants and some non-living things may be experienced as evil or good. Or, they may be experienced as arrogant, proud, insolent, self-domineering or humble, sheepish, crestfallen, etc., just to mention one other dimension of personal attributes. Education in industrial countries is strongly centered on a subject/object cleavage: some traits of animals are the real and objective attributes, others we are said to project into the animals. They are merely subjective. In practical life application of the distinction is a plus, but it downplays spontaneous experiences with its richness, intensity and depth. It favors thinking in terms of abstract relations and structures of reality, not in terms of the content. When we depart and decide to meet again on a mountain, the mountain must be defined in terms of our society and culture, defined as an object we have in common. But this does not mean an object "in itself." Our vast abstractions are momentous cultural achievements specific to Western culture. Contemporary mathematical physics is an example. Here the link to spontaneous experience is extremely indirect and spotty, but strong because of the high level of mathematical deduction. Because of its severe limitation of modelling abstract structure, it expresses an intercultural type of knowledge. That is, intercultural only if one does not rely on popularization but sticks to the severe mathematical form of what is asserted. In that case the cultural background disappears! The equations are intercultural, but any interpretations in terms we are acquainted with in our daily life depend on specific cultures. Communication among experts are compatible with deep cultural differences among the participants. HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1—1995</page><page sequence="8">Arne Naess 137 There is no physical world with specifically physical content. There is a reality, the content of which we have direct contact with only through and in our spontaneous experiences. It is a reality of infinite richness. No dichotomies of fundamental character seem to be adequate to describe it. At least not that between physical and mental "worlds," or between a subjective and objective reality. The philosophical reaction against taking the latter distinction as fundamental has increased in strength since the 1890s. Should we, mused A.N. Whitehead, stop admiring the beauty of a rose and instead admire the poet who admirably sings about it? Would not that be reasonable if the rose in itself is neither beautiful nor ugly? "Objectivity" only in electrons and similar colorless items? The beauty of the rose itself is spontaneously experienced and is as real as anything can be. WESTERN SCHOOLS AND EUROPEAN UNITY The school systems of the industrial states are all adapted to their common, very special way of life. Unawareness of this makes reforms widening the perspective difficult: schools remain provincial. A main difficulty in schools which try out less one sided perspectives is a concern for the future of the children: How do they get a job when their knowledge does not fit in with the established order? If the parents are economically rich, they can help the young get along in the unique and strange world of the industrial growth societies—in spite of "far out" schooling, but otherwise the young tend to get into trouble. Therefore, educators often to give up the most radical sorts of reform. Let us look at some of the curricula children now have to leam, starting with mathematics. It is today completely Westernized and utilitarian. No trace of Chinese or Indian old mathematical culture, and with the typical Western emphasis on proof. Little about bold mathematical conjectures, for instance those in the theory of numbers; little about endless fractions and orders of the infinite. With more adequate mathematic education, children get to love mathematics and tend to continue to relish mathematics after leaving school. And mathematics are an ecologically very innocent hobby! Masses of excellent paper are wasted HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS—VOLUME 21:1-1995</page><page sequence="9">138 Industrial Society, Postmodernity.. every day in schools, but some could be used to build geometrically interesting buildings. Proper mathematical education should, of course, not lack instruction about the existence of proofs and, in later years, of axiomatic or formal systems in general. But only basic notions, "axiomatic thinking," not complicated applications. Perhaps three or four different proofs of the Pythagorean, and a couple of other simple proofs, would suffice to make them understand the miracle of proofs and—later—make them grasp the essentials of deduction systems. What about chemistry? Children love to play with (more or less) innocent chemicals. Let them see how two "colorless" liquids, brought together, may create fantastic colors. Miracles! In organic chemistry they may leam about the long series, like CH4, C2H5, C3H8 and enjoy building molecules. Isomers of C4H10! Very inexpensive and elegant colored tools are available today. They may learn about colors used by Rembrandt and others. Children appreciate crystals, and with a magnifying glass they may enjoy learning about some of the most beautiful forms. They can combine this with some mineralology and petrology. The joy of finding stones. Leam to enjoy natural things of which there are enough for all. At the university level there should be opportunity to go deep into modem, theoretical "hard" chemistry. Let me then mention history. A main guideline is to focus on the local (bioregional) and the global, less emphasis on the national. More about interlocal movements, less about internationalism. More emphasis on cultural diversity and on the fourth world. The distinction between "global" and "international" is important for many reasons. One of them is that few nations have much power, while the great global corporations have more than most, shaping economic life everywhere. It is now more than half a century since the school textbooks of the Scandinavian countries were "adjusted" to each other. Before that, a war between them was, as a matter of habit, described systematically with each participant reporting and ethically judging what happened, according to their own extremely one-sided propaganda. There is no hope of establishing peaceful, green societies as long as conflicts are described in a way that HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1-1995</page><page sequence="10">Arne Naess 139 fosters prejudice and hatred. What is equally pernicious is the underestimation of social and political calamities due to the destruction of their own land. The tentative history of ecological calamities is now available and the material should be integrated in school textbooks (Ponting 1991).3 Until recently "world history" for children—at least in Europe—has been atrociously anthropocentric. History of the planet, and history of life, should be in focus, as part of the global perspective. History of bioregions takes care of the local perspective. Social and cultural anthropology cannot be completely absorbed in textbooks of history, but there is room for some of the subjects. The outlook of economic anthropology is relevant: children should know that the economic system they are part of in the West is an extremely special kind. General cultural, and especially religious, institutions have been stronger in comparison to the economic. In the industrial countries the history of capitalism since the 15th century tells us a lot about our successes and our failures. It is not the place here to go through the curriculum of schools and colleges. Wide differences of approach are needed, but the state of affairs today is deplorable: Pupils aged six to sixteen (what I call herein "children"), are in the rich industrial societies, on the whole, imbibed with ways of thinking adapted to a kind of society that hopefully will disappear in their own lifetime. But, as has always been the case, schools mirror society, and the transition to green societies must occur simultaneously at many sections of the long frontier of change. When our children and grandchildren learn history in the schools of the next century, they may be confronted with sentences like the following: "The productivity of industry and agriculture increased exponentially in the richest industrial countries in the last half of the 20th century. A wild consumerism threatened not only the conditions of life on our planet, but was accompanied with an impoverishment of the relation between people, degradation of fellowship and increase of asocial attitudes. (New phenomenon: criminal careers of children between eight and sixteen years of age.) The economy of a country was not expected to adapt to its culture, but the culture to the economy." HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1-1995</page><page sequence="11">140 Industrial Society, Postmodernity.. People in the Third World do not seem to realize that the consumerism of the West is doomed. They don't have the chance to see that there is no future for the kind of life they observe the tourists living. Here is one of the great challenges in the years to come: what can be done to change the picture those people have of our common future? What can be done to assist a transition from the pre-industrial to the post-industrial? The combined focus on the local and global is impossible under conditions of economic globalization, as the latter term is now used. The term "economic globalization" is to some extent a misleading term. A better term might be "globalization of the four freedoms," referring to the so-called "four freedoms" of the Treaty of Rome which was the basis of the European Common Market and which is still the core of the present day European Union. The Rome globalization means successive expansion of its "four freedoms" until it also covers the trade between the three giants, the European Union, the US (and Canada) and Japan, and reluctantly over the rest of the globe. The term "four freedoms" refers to free (duty free) crossing of goods through borders, freedom to compete for jobs anywhere, freedom of capital to flow across any borders. The four freedoms imply four prohibitions, the violation of which will be punished by the authorities, namely strong, adequate protection for social, medical, ecological or other reasons of cultural relevance, against import of certain goods or services, or against certain kinds of flow of foreign capital into a local, regional, or any other limited area, for instance the arctic coast of Norway. Representatives of the EU tempt politicians and the public in the four new countries that now (1994) have expressed a wish to join, by emphasizing transition periods with less strict negative rules. But in the long run, the overall tendency is to prepare for tighter and tighter economic unions—like that of the United States of America. The outlook: a world of consumers getting more and cheaper products than ever before through wider mobility. Only a diversity of cultures compatible with the supreme rules of a free world market! Norway is the only Nordic country with family farms, and there is a definite agriculture, not only agribusiness. But to protect this culture, and also to make it possible HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1-1995</page><page sequence="12">Arne Naess 141 economically to survive, Norway "subsidizes" her agriculture. That is, there is a transfer of income so that the farmers can offerthe publictheir products at low prices, prices which are not high enough to cover farm expenses. In an important sense, it is not the farmer, but the public that is subsidized, and also are protected against further increase of urbanized youth. The public have to pay more for milk, bread, etc., than they would on the world market. We are asked to destroy the farm culture in favor of city culture. The Norwegian market today is not completely made part of the cheap world market. But what Norwegians pay for their food is absurdly little, usually about 15 percent of their average income. That is, expenses for transport (private car, etc.) and other expenses are much greater. We must expect that food calculated in percent will cost us substantially more than today in future green societies. One may say, in general, that the cost today to satisfy vital needs is, on the average, only a small fraction of the cost of satisfying wants. Or, to be more exact, a small fraction of the cost of satisfying wants which are "normal" in the rich industrial countries. The economy of Norway is capitalist, but closerto a mixed economy than that, say, of the United States. As a mixed economy, one may, very roughly, class an economic system with free market within a framework which permits fairly strong rules governing the operation of the market. Rules which make Norway, for instance, capable of protecting certain activities, agricultural, industrial or others, from foreign competition, that is, ultimately, from the world market. The government has recently said yes to GATT and this turns Norway into a more streamlined capitalist country, distancing herself from ideals of a mixed economy. (Unhappily, the term "mixed economy" is sometimes used for any capitalist system which has one or more rules protecting the environment. This makes the US and every other industrial country mixed economy countries. But, hopefully, this erosion of the terminology will not continue too long.) What is now the status of green economy in relation to all this? If a country can sell products cheaper than certain others because they have a higher degree of irresponsible ecological policy, the four freedoms prevent HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1-1995</page><page sequence="13">142 Industrial Society, Postmodernity.. the more responsible country from keeping the products out. It cannot be expected that the consumers keep account of the ecological atrocities in other countries. It is therefore unlikely that a green economy, at least in the near future, will suddenly be established in a single country. In the short run, countries with the most irresponsible policies will profit from export, but in the long run, other states will presumably introduce economic sanctions in favor of their own export. From the point of view of the Treaty of Rome, the individuality, or "personality," of local economic activity cannot be ideal because of the lack of fierce competition and not consistent with the maximization of profits. The machinery of economic activity as conceived by supporters of the Treaty of Rome is taken to be universalizable, common to all possible cultures. That is, the introduction may always take place, it will change the culture. This way of describing the Treaty is, however, too simple for serious debate. Minor differences in the economic system may be tolerated, even supported, for instance because it favors tourism or belongs to simple cultural traits of which the population is particularly proud. At the moment the applicants of membership in the European Union will, as mentioned, be permitted to continue for a time particular activities inconsistent with the Treaty of Rome. The time is mostly longer than the interval between political elections. This makes it easier for governments to join the Union because many negative and controversial consequences of membership get manifest only after their own time in power. Concluding, we wish to admit that centralization of power today is furthered by more benevolent people than ever before—people and institutions interested in fostering more trade, and letting people consume and travel more than ever. Until recently it was widely held that capitalist competition leads to war. Today it may lead instead to systems of tacit and explicit agreement between corporations in orderto keep pieces from falling. In Japan and the US it is now widely held that wars of trade between the two giants are not, in the long run, in the interest of industry. It would be better, it is said, for both to have a free market comprising Japan, the US and Europe, but with mutual agreements between leaders of the HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1-1995</page><page sequence="14">Arne Naess 143 corporations avoiding undesirable kinds of competition. We might end up with a culture, including education, getting adapted to the world market rather than adaptation the other way around. Because of the central idea of "the more trade the better" combined with vastly increased mobility of persons and goods, the ecological problems cannot but increase. OUR WAY IS BACK TO SUSTAINABILITY, NOT TO OLD FORMS OF SOCIETY It is tempting to see "us"—members of the rich industrial countries—as "moderns," more or less disregarding nine tenths of humanity. They also live today, they belong to the contemporary scene, but are considered relics of the past. As to the exact delimitation of modernity in terms of age, one proposal is to think of the time from the European Renaissance to the present, another proposal is to only include the period from the start of the industrial revolution, at least covering about two centuries. Not without some arrogance many of us now look forward to the creation of "postindustrial" societies. The reflections that follow are colored by personal experiences and result in an urge to examine industrial society in the light of values established in non-industrial, "traditional" societies, and in the light of life that is ecologically, fully sustainable.4 Such life has been the life of humans for long periods of time. Alaska was inhabited by people of ecologically sustainable, diverse cultures through thousands of years. In Norway people followed the retreat of the ice 8,000 years ago. As soon as reindeer could prosper, humans prospered. Ecological sustainabiiity was only one characteristic of traditional societies, and it did to some extent reflect the small number of people. Many of them we would class as ecologically unsustainable if there had been millions of numbers. The reindeer-based, very loose societies were dependent to some extent upon the ratio between the number of reindeer and the number of humans. Of course, there is "no way back" in general, but it is important to remember that global unsustainability is something very new and that for a wide variety of stable HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1-1995</page><page sequence="15">144 Industrial Society, Postmodernity.. cultures our planet was a tremendously big, rich, eminently hospitable and benign world. Difficulties had to arise only when humans were pressed away by other humans from the areas where life was most easy or at least not a greater challenge than desired. It is to be hoped that an increasing minority views unsustainability as an undignified, stupid—if not plainly ridiculous—state of affairs. That an increasing minority expresses this attitude with increasing boldness, but without arrogance since very few activists can avoid making use of the facilities offered in the industrial societies. In short, there is no way back to societies which belong to the past, but there is a way back to ecological sustainability. Not only one way, but many ways resulting in widely different sustainable cultures. There is no lack of valuable contributions to the study of these ways, but they are, on the whole, unknown to the public. Unavoidably, great sections of the public get the feeling that "environmentalists" want to turn back time. When some of them announce, "Back to Pleistocene!" that suspicion is well founded. The indication of ways to go does not, of course, amount to elaborate plans and blueprints. Such absence of detail has been the rule, not the exception in all new major human undertakings. It has never stopped those who have the proper motivation to work for change. There are not only rough plans of how to solve some of the most serious ecological problems, and there are even tentative—very tentative—estimates of the costs in money and labor. A dollar estimate was published in The State of the World 1988 (186).5 An updated 1994 rough estimate could be—let us say—250 billion dollars yearly. Here I shall only mention some theoretical aspects of such an estimate. Due to the lack of institutional infrastructure necessary to use such a large sum rationally, the sum of 250 billion dollars may be reached ten years from now, that is, from 2005 and onwards. The sum, both in money and in work, would almost entirely be paid by the rich countries. The vast activity within the rich countries in preparation for the undertaking would demand workers in great numbers with a great variety of skills. With present levels of unemployment there is no sign that the necessary number could not be mobilized. Production, in the wide sense of HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1-1995</page><page sequence="16">Arne Naess 145 theoretical economics, would increase. It would be registered as increased GDP—gross domestic product. Carrying through the undertaking, mostly inside non industrial countries by people in those countries, but in close cooperation with people from the industrial countries, would only be accomplished through substantial mobilization of people and capital. As an example, consider reforestation. Today several hundred million people lack fuel for cooking their food or cleaning their drinking water—the distance to the nearest wood is simply too far. Under such circumstances, planted trees are normally used for fuel as soon as they are as big as bushes. Therefore, the people must be offered other kinds of fuel for at least 20 years. Even then, a great number of honest people must act as protectors of the growing plants. In short, reforestation is a socially complex, labor-intensive undertaking, and the economics of both the industrial and non-industrial countries would be highly stimulated. Inevitably the consumption, not the production, of the rich countries would decrease. The increased consumption would be in the non-industrial countries and would not interfere with the increase of GDP in the rich countries. It is not a measure of domestic consumption, as it is often thought to be. If Norway produces 1,000 tiny hydroelectric plants for use in poor countries, it decreases its unemployment and reduces poverty among others. Global reforestation will not, of course, mean complete reforestation, but reforestation in so far as it both ensures ecological sustainability and meets the vital needs of the people. But, as already mentioned, not much can be done in the next years even if money and work force were available. It is not like mobilizing in times of war in a country where military institutions are prepared for this a long time in advance. Large scale rational and ethically responsible reforestation is a new sort of undertaking that requires highly educated, corruption-resistant people. And it will take a long time. One generation? Three generations? Nobody knows. There is, however, no "point of no return." Compared to the investment of life, work and money in a great war, the investment needed to overcome the ecological crisis is very small. And the work of a determined minority could get the work started in earnest. HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS-VOLUME 21:1—1995</page><page sequence="17">Industrial Society, Postmodernity...
