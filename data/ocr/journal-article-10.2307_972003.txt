<plain_text><page sequence="1">Iconographic studies often provide evidence to interpret ritual activities of archaeologically known cultures. Recent excava- tions at the site of Conchopata nearAyacucho, Peru, led to a re-analysis of the ritual behavior of Middle Horizon (A.D. 750-1000) Wari society. The identification of a hallucinogenic plant design, Anadenanthera colubrina, depicted on Conchopata offering pottery contributes a crucial understanding of a previously unknown artistic icon. This icon was discerned as depicted in var- ious abstract renditions on Middle Horizon textiles, snuff paraphernalia, ceramics, and stone sculpture, including the Gate of the Sun at Tiwanaku, Bolivia. Based on historic and ethnographic evidence, the plant's prehistoric use as a hallucinogen is dis- cussed with regard to suggested chicha drinking ceremonies, and the transitional role of Wari leaders from shamans to priests. Los estudios iconogra'ficos proporcionan a menudo evidencias que permiten interpretar actividades rituales de culturas conoci- das desde el punto de vista arqueologico. Las excavaciones recientes en el sitio de Conchopata, cerca de Ayacucho, Peru, condu- jeron a un nuevo analisis del comportamiento ritual de la sociedad Wari durante el Horizonte Medio (750-1000 D. C.). La identificacion de un diseno de la planta alucinogenaAnadenanthera colubrina, representada en una of renda ceratmica Conchopata contribuye al conocimiento crucial para interpretar a un icono artistico anteriormente desconocido. Este icono fue reconocido en diversas ve rsiones abstractas sobre textiles, parafernalia pa ra rape, ceramica y escultu ras liticas pertenecientes al Ho rizonte Medio incluyendo a la Puerta del Sol en Tiwanaku, Bolivia. Basado en evidencias historicas y etnograficas, se discute el uso pre- historico de esta planta alucinogeno en relaciona al consumo de chicha en ceremonias rituales y se discute el papel transicional de los lideres Wari de curanderos a sacerdotes.

Icons are artistic symbols that are representative of, or interpreted as, sources of authoritative knowledge, usually political or reli- gious. By analyzing the patterns of their use on politico-religious artifacts, we may be able to dis- cern the activities of prehistoric leaders, such as shamans and priests, in controlling and managing their society. Such analysis may help to explain social processes such as the development of a complex society. Since the 1940s,Andean archaeologists have investigated and analyzed the prehistoric remains that define the Wari culture of Middle Horizon (A.D. 750-lOOO)Andean prehistory (Bennett 1953; Isbell and McEwan 1991; Lumbreras 1960; Tello 1942). From an architecturally impressive, 250-hectare urban center 10 km north of Ayacucho, theWari col- onized several diverse populations of the Andes. The evidence of colonization is imposed, standardized architectural buildings that suggest a complex social system and political control by the Wari as they expanded (Anders 1991; Isbell et al. 1991; McEwan 1991; Schreiber 1992;Topicl991). Within Wari art is an elaborate religious iconography that incorpo- rated coastal Nasca and highland Pukara art from the Early Intermediate Period (A.D. 0-750). This iconography pertains to the Conchopata style from the site of the same name, located in the eastern sub- urbs of Ayacucho, and to the Robles Moqo style from the Pacheco site on the south coast (Menzel 1964) (Figure 1). In 1997, Jose Ochatoma, professor at the Universidad Nacional de San Cristobal de Hua- manga, conducted excavations at Conchopata. He recovered more pottery in this ceremonial style, including a stylized plant image. In this paper, I sug- 387 WARI RITUAL POWER AT CONCHOPATA: AN IN lliKPRETATION OF ANADENANTHERA COLUBRINA ICONOGRAPHY Patricia J. Knobloch </page><page sequence="2">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 1 1, No. 4, 2000] 388 In previous studies of Wari art, the iconography has been interpreted as representing a religious cult "around which the political system was built" (Men- zel 1968 :93), religious symbols of "control and a pre- text for conquest" documenting a "proselytizing ecumenical religion" (Lumbreras 1974:163, 177), or an evolving ideology of a developing hierarchy "with subordination established by natural attributes of authority and power" (Isbell and Cook 1987:32). Thus, the iconography is both political and religious with little, if any, research suggesting that Wari reli- gion and politics were separate social processes. One pattern of iconographic use is that numerous Wari tapestry tunics display the iconography of the sub- ordinate attendant icons in which dozens are arranged in columns of vertical panels. I suggest that Wari leaders might have worn these tunics to symbolize themselves as deity-like by being the focus of these subordinate attendant icons that are purposefully arranged to face toward the tunic's vertical central line or the wearer. In Wari society, the wearer would appear empowered by these religious symbols and elevated to a higher social status (Knobloch 1986, 1988). Thus, as sources of power such politico-reli- gious iconography may document some of the activ- ities by leaders in controlling and managing a society, especially in the case of Wari as its society is pre- sumed to have expanded into a complex conquest state or empire. Another activity that focuses on this Wari iconog- raphy was a curious tradition of burying large, col- orfully decorated ceramic vessels, usually urns (Anders 1990; Cook 1979; Menzel 1964, 1968; Ravines Sanchez 1968). Since Julio Tello's 1942 dis- covery of a possible burial of ceramics or ceramic offering of such urns at Conchopata, the iconogra- phy of the decoration has been identified as similar to the iconography displayed on the Gate of the Sun at Tiwanaku, Bolivia and suggests that these two ancient populations from highland Peru and Bolivia possibly shared common religious activities (Ben- nett 1953:99; Menzel 1964: 19-23; Spielvogel 1955; Tello 1942: 11&gt;111). The Gate of the Sun may date to Tiwanaku IV (A.D. 450-750), previously described as an example of the Tiwanaku Classic Phase stone sculpture (Bennett 1934:474). The pottery burials are even more curious in that the Wari smashed these beautiful vessels prior to bur- ial. Perhaps, the smashing was symbolic of sacrifi- cial death or, once the content was gone, the vessels Figure 1. Areas of Peru, Bolivia and Chile with archaeo- logical sites of the Wari and Tiwanaku cultures. gest this plant image is the first identification of a Wari-style icon of a well-known hallucinogenic plant, Anadenanthera colubrina. I will describe the Wari religious iconography, the method of identify- ing this plant as an icon, the previously unknown ren- ditions on other artifacts, and the plant's hallucinogenic properties. Then I will discuss its use in chicha drinking ceremonies, and how it may be an important ritual icon indicating the social devel- opment of an ancient priesthood. Within the Wari iconography, the principal icons are typically images of deities and subordinate atten- dants. The principal deity icon is usually depicted standing in a frontal pose, grasping a staff in each hand by its sides. The attendant icons are drawn in profile. They are depicted in either a standing pose or positioned horizontally as though flying. If stand- ing, then they appear to be genuflecting on one bent knee. One hand grasps a staff in front of them; if the other hand is depicted, then it is sometimes holding a trophy head or club. The attendant icons are also referred to as "angels" or "winged spirit men" (Men- zel 1977:61) that combine animal and human fea- tures with a dorsal-wing motif. When combined the attendant icons occur on either side of the deity icon facing the deity icon.</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS 389 Figure 2; Ceramics from Ochatoma 1997 excavation at Conchopata, Peru: images of the A. colubrina plant icon, with</page><page sequence="4">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 11, No. 4, 2000] 390 were too sacred to be ever used again. Along with destroying sacred icons, the extensive amount of labor involved in production and decoration could have enhanced the value of the sacrifice. To support this theory of sacrifice there was one excavation in which humans appear to have been sacrificed in this ritual (Isbell and Cook 1987). Another possible ceramic offering of large urns was discovered at the Pacheco site on the Peruvian south coast. Some urns display variants of deity icons and others display stylized images of plants, such as potato, olluco, mashua and oca. The plant images were identified by Yacovleff and Herrera ( 1 934:Figure 28). Though stylized the plant identification was possible because the Wari artists distinguished primary attributes of the plants, such as the flowers, leaves, branches, fruit, or vegetable. Wari depictions of plants were highly simplistic as two-dimensional, flat shapes symmetrically positioned rather than naturally ren- dered like a photograph. Recently at the site of Con- chopata, salvage excavations by Jose Ochatoma unearthed fragments of a large jar that also displayed stylized plant images (Figure 2). The artistic tradi- tion or rule of symmetrical simplicity is also evi- dent in the plant image on this Conchopata vessel. Following artistic rules of symmetrical simplic- ity, the Wari artist drew this plant image with only two flowers at the top of a central branch, with two leaves below the flowers, one on either side, and with two seedpods hanging down below the leaves, one on either side. The image appears so unnatural that no initial identification was possible. By taking into account that the image was stylized according to Wari artistic convention in which only primary attributes are rendered, I was able to match the image with a natural plant based on those stylized attrib- utes rather than expecting a natural appearance. The match was facilitated by the prior, extensive research of Yacovleff and Herrera (1935:4243). Their natu- ralistic drawing of an Anadenanthera plantdisplayed all the primary attributes of the plant image. Specif- ically, the Anadenanthera is a mimosa tree with hang- ing bean-like pods and belongs to the Leguminosae family, thus the plant image displays oblong lobes with black dots. The tree grows to 20 m in height with a dark, spiky trunk whose diameter reaches 60 cm, and multi-paired, bipinnate leaves, thus the leaves are drawn as ovate shapes and almost feather like. The flowers cluster into white, hairy spheres like the flowers of a dandelion gone to seed. When viewed Figure 3. Natural drawing of A. colubrzna indicating spherical flowers, bipinnate leaves and leguminous seed- pod (after Yacovleff and Herrera 1935:Figure 51). in photographs the centers appear dark with the lighter white around the center, thus the black cen- tral dot and lighter colored circle of the circled dot design elements that represent the flowers. One species of Anadenanthera, A. peregrina, has a thick corky bark with acacia-like foliage and grows in the llanos region of the Orinoco basin of Colum- bia and Venezuela, as well as savannahs and light forestsofnorthernAmazonia(Schultes 1972:27-28; Schultes and Hofmann 1979: 119,1980: 145). Three other species referenced in the literature as A. macro- carpa, A. excelsa, andA. colubrina may have grown in northern Argentina, southern Peru, and Bolivia (Stafford 1992:316). A. colubrina grew in the val- leys of tropical climates, and A. macrocarpa in the highlands of Peru and Bolivia (Yacovleff and Her- rera 1935:4243) (Figure 3). At the time of their research Yacovleff and Herrera labeled the genus Piptadenia, which has since been recognized as the genus Anadenanthera, founded in 1923 (Schultes and Hofmann 1980: 140-141). Moreover, the A. macrocarpa species is now referred to as A. colub- rina and as such is "morphologically very closely related to A. peregrina" (Schultes 1972:29). A very detailed botanical description of Anadenanthera can be found in Schultes and Hofmann (1980:149-152) who add thatA. colubrina "occurs in eastern Brazil . . . Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru and several local-</page><page sequence="5">REPORTS 391 ities in southeastern Brazil." Since the A. colubrina depiction on the Conchopata sherds illustrates the plant's primary attributes, as an icon its various ren- ditions can be identified on other Middle Horizon artifacts. For purposes of future identification, the pri- mary design attributes of the plant icon are: 1) cir- cled dots, usually two, at the top of the icon representing the spherical flowers; 2) two, symmet- rically positioned ovate or rectangular shapes with interior lines representing the leaves, usually posi- tioned below the circled dots; and, 3) oblong or rec- tangular shape with interior dots representing the seedpods. Also potentially useful are two secondary design attributes that are added to this list from other renditions described below. The wavy band repre- senting the plant's trunk is appended to a curved band of a simple interlocking fret design (see Fig- ure 2). Such bands of interlocking fret designs are common in Wari art to outline stylized human heads. Thus, the entire image was possibly of a plant that appeared to have grown from an anthropomorphic head. This association is found on other renditions of this plant icon in which the icon is appended to a design band outlining a head motif or just a head motif (see Figures 4, 5a, 5b, 5c, 6b, 6d, 7, 8a, and 8b). Another attribute that occurs on renditions of this plant icon is a small triangle or rectangle design ele- ment located between the leaf-design attribute (see Figures 5a, 5c, 6d, 7, 8a, 8b, 9b, and 9c). In analyz- ing Wari and Tiwanaku iconography, I observed these primary and secondary attributes on possible exam- ples or renditions of the plant icon and often found that the renditions combined only two attributes. When only one attribute occurred, I qualify the ren- dition as very speculative requinng further analysis. I argue that the recent Conchopata rendition is so precise that there is little, if any, doubt about the botanical identification. Thus, the identification of this plant icon provides the first example of a Mid- dle Horizon Wari artistic representation of a well- known, hallucinogenic plant. With this discovery the following research furthers our understanding of the Wari ceramic offering ritual at Conchopata. Iconographic Examples of Anadenanthera Colubrina A rather unique image of a Wari-attendant icon on a tapestry tunic with unknown provenience has proven crucial in the identification of other exam- ples (Lavalle 1984:76-77) (Figure 4). This textile Figure 4. Lavalle textile with unknown provenience: A. colubrina plant icon appended to staff, arm, legs, head- dress, and beak design elements and winged-eye motif (after Lavalle 1984:7S77). displays attendant icons with bird-like attributes including one clawed hand holding a staff. At the bottom of each staff is depicted a stylized head motif. At the top is the plant icon. The plant icon has two circled dots for the flowers and two, sym- metrically positioned half ovate shapes with lines that look like combs for the leaves. The seedpods are drawn independently of the other primary attrib- utes. There are two seedpods that hang down to one side of the staff, at the top and at the bottom and a third seedpod hangs down from the beak. There are narrow bands running centrally within the attendant icon's arms and legs that also end in the plant icon. The plant icon is also depicted in the headdress and appended to the eye motif. The eye motif includes a wing design element and will be referred to as a winged-eye motif. This textile example is crucial in identifying other examples because it depicts all three primary attributes, flowers, leaves, and seed- pods. With these attributes this textile rendition is the closest example to the Conchopata version that links to the identity of the plant, thereby providing a transitional version to examples with fewer plant icon attributes.</page><page sequence="6"> LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 11, No. 4, 2000] 392 the bottom of the staff is appended a stylized head motif. This deity icon's staff shares the structural layout wiffi ffie plant icon of the attendant icon's staff depicted on the Lavalle textile. A snuff tablet from Tiwanaku depicts a row of four stylized renditions (Torres 1995:Figure 6); only one is shown here (Figure Sb). The plant icon is rep- resented by a circled dot forthe flower, and two, sym- metrically positioned sets of simple diagonal lines for the leaves. Two plant icons are appended to the top of a head motif. On another snuff tablet the plant icon is stylized and simplified (Lavalle 1984:184, left) (Figure 5c) to only two plant icon attributes. In this rendition the flowers are depicted by the two, circled dots. The leaves are represented by two, sym- metrically positioned bands of diagonally intersected lines known as chevron designs. Textiles I suggest the following example is a very simplified rendition with only one plant icon attribute of the leaves as two, symmetrically positioned, vertical bands of chevrons atop a staff (Lavalle 1984:87) (Figure 6a). These chevrons might represent raptor feathers. However, the chevrons point upward. If they represented raptor feathers, then these chevrons should point downward to represent the feather barbs along the shaft as the feather's pith would be attached to the staff. This example is more speculative than others, but I suggest warrants a possibility. One textile, from Pachacamac, is a very frag- mented tapestry depicting rows of attendant icons grasping staffs (Eisleb and Strelow 1980:Figure 328) (Figure 6b). The plant icon is very stylized, com- bining its primary attributes on the chest of each attendant icon. The flower is a single band with a cir- cled dot hanging from the design band that outlines the attendant's head. The leaves were depicted by two, symmetrically positioned rows of diagonal lines. The seedpod is below as a rectangle with two dots. Another rendition of the plant icon is associ- ated with two "unique profile figures (human?)" on atunic with no provenience (Bergh l999:Figure 95). These two standing human figures have their faces and feet in profile yet their two hands hold staffs on either side of a body facing to the front (Figure 6c). The plant icon is appended to the top of the staff held by one human figure and hanging from the belt of the other. The staff version has two circled dots for the flowers and two, symmetrically positioned short b Figure 5.

Snuff Tablets On a snuff tablet from San Pedro de Atacama (Tor- res l995:Figure 11) (Figure Sa), the entire image consists of a deity icon holding two staffs.

The two plant icons hanging from the belt have only one circled dot each for a flower with two, symmetrically positioned short chevron bands for the leaves. With these images, the only other plant icon attribute is that one staff with each figure is atop a stylized head motif. From a Pisagua grave lot in Chile, a Tiwanaku headband displays a row of "mythical figures," pos- sibly pumas (Conklin 1983:Figure 23, 24). Conklin dates this textile to the middle of his Tiwanaku sequence, contemporary with the Gate of the Sun (Conklin 1983:Table 1, l991:Figure 7). Appended to the headdress and front claw or foot are short bands ending in the plant icon. Only the headdress</page><page sequence="8">lVol. 11, No. 4, 20001 394 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 7. Textile with unknown provenience: A. colubrina plant icon appended to headdress of a deity icon (The Textile Museum, Washington, D.C., no. 1972.27.1). example is presented here (Figure 6d). In this rendi- tion, the plant icon retains the leaves as two, sym- metrically positioned sets of diagonal lines, a triangle design element between the leaves, but the circled dots are replaced by three squared design elements on bands to represent the flower attributes. Conklin refers to these latter as "tail feathers" because he suggested the motif represented headless birds. This rendition does appear bird-like but I argue it follows the conventions of the plant icon's attribute combi- nations more logically. Also, other Tiwanaku carved stone examples discussed below indicate a prefer- ence for the flower and seedpod attributes to be rep- resented by three design elements rather than two. Thus, this rendition may be a stylization with a Tiwanaku design rubric. Another tapestry tunic with no provenience dis- plays several attendant icons with bird-like attrib- utes (LaFarge 1981:94) (Figure 6e). Only the winged-eye motif has the plant icon appended in a similar manner as the Lavalle textile. This rendi- tion depicts the plant icon with two circled dots for the flowers appended to two, symmetrically posi- tioned sets of diagonal lines for the leaves. Another partial textile tapestry displays a very complex scene of a deity icon flanked on either side by two small human figures, attendant icons, and small, mythical creature icons (Conklin 1971; Rowe 1974:Plate 50). The plant icon occurs appended to the headdress of the deity icon, one on either side just below the top corners (Figure 7). This rendi- tion has two circled dots for the flowers and two, symmetrically positioned sets of diagonal lines for the leaves. A triangle design element occurs between the leaves. Ceramics In addition to the Conchopata example, described above, a second example from this site occurs on large urns from Tello's 1942 excavation pho- tographed by Anita Cook (Isbell and Cook 1987:3(}31). On these large urns, a deity icon is flanked by two attendant icon variants. The plant icon is appended to the top of the headdress on one of the attendant icons (Figure 8a). In this rendition, only two plant icon attributes are present. On either side of a triangle design element there are two, sym- metrically positioned half ovate shapes with three curved lines to represent the leaves. With all rendi- tions taken into account, the absence of the flower attribute is veIy rare. A third example comes from the 1999 excavations at Conchopata directed by Anita Cook and William Isbell. The sherd is badly damaged in various areas as indicated by dotted lines in the illustration (Figure 8b). The plant icon is appended to the headdress of an attendant icon. The flowers are represented by two promlnent circled dots. As with the Tello example, there are two, sym- metrically positioned half-ovate shapes with three curved lines to represent the leaves. The design ele- ment between the leaves appears to be a rectangle rather than a triangle. From the Cuzco area of Pomacachi, another stylized rendition was found depicted on a Wari-style tall cup (San Roman Luna 1983) (Figure 8c). There are two circled dots for the flowers and two, symmetrically positioned short chevron bands on either side for the leaves. Without the known plant icon attributes this Pomacachi exam- ple could be mistaken for an insect, perhaps butter- fly, image.

Stone Sculpture lwhe most interesting example of the plant icon thus far discovered is displayed on the famous Gate of the Sun at Tiwanaku, Bolivia. For generations, the iconography of this stone doorway has been inter- preted as religious symbolism or as a calendrical device (Posnansky 1945, 1957). Everyminutedesign element has been labeled based either on logic (e.g., eyes, wings, steps, staffs, humans) or conjecture (e.g., sun, birds, gods, angels). Few if any of the stylized design elements or motifs on this famous stone sculp- ture are known beyond reasonable doubt to repre- sent anything real and natural. I^hus, the plant icon identification may be a significant breakthrough in deciphering the meanings of the sculpted iconogra- phy. The plant icon is appended to the winged-eye motif of the attendant icon with bird-like attributes (Figure 9a). This rendition has three, rather than two, circles for the flowers and, like the Conchopata ceramic examples, has two, symmetrically posi- tioned half ovate shapes with three curved lines to represent the leaves. I^his rendition is mirrored by the Lavalle textile (see Figure 4); both of the winged- eye motifs have a short curved band in front of the eye, small rectangular design elements atop the eye, and two filler dots below the eye. This rendition is also similar to the LaFarge textile example (see Fig- ure 6e). The plant icon is also carved into a grinding stonefromTiwanaku (Ponce Sangines 1964:Figures 23, Plate 11; Rowe 1974:Figure 403). This cylindri- cal stone is about 15 cm thick and 47 cm in diame- ter with a shallow circular depression on top. I^he stone was carved all around the upper half of its outer surface and around a wide border on the top. I^he outer surface is covered with an interlocking pattern of deity icons, although the tops of their stylized heads are worn off. Around the top border a scroll design of interlocking head motifs displays the plant icon appended to the headdresses (Figure 9b). There are three circled dots for the flowers and two, sym- metrically positioned rectangles with two lines for the leaves. Between the leaves is a small rectangle design element. Another stone bowl was located on the Lake Titicaca island of Taquiri (Ryden 1947: Fig- ure 147). Unfortunately, photographs are not pub- lished for this "cube shaped" object, but only drawings of three sides of the cube that may not rep- resent the correct details of the plant icon. This ren- dition depicts the plant icon in the shoulder straps, and hanging from the belt and neck of a deity icon (Figure 9c). These design elements appear like the headless birds of Conklin's Pisagua textile descrip- tion in that the flowers are represented by three rec- tangular design elements rather than circled dots. Two, symmetrically positioned rectangles with three lines represent the leaves. Between the leaves is a triangle design element. I^he deity also grasps two staffs atop head motifs. Another stone sculpture carved in great detail and dating to Tiwanaku IV or the Classic Phase may also have a representation of the plant icon. Known as the Bennett Monolith, this free-standing statue represents a mythical being cov- ered with symbols and icons (Bennett 1934:Figure</page><page sequence="10"> lVol. 11, No. 4, 2000] LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 396 b a c Figure 9.

This mythical being appears to be wearing pants rather than the typical highland tunic. Thus the figure follows the stylized depictions of the attendant icons with discernable arms and legs exposed rather than of the deity icon whose body is covered by clothing, such as a tunic. Two arms are depicted bent at the elbows and held against the chest. One hand holds a kero or cup, and the other possible snuff paraphernalia (Berenguer 1987) (Figure 9d). Though structurally unlike other renditions, the plant icon still retains one primary and one secondary attribute: 1) hanging seedpods with the Tiwanaku preference for three circles rather than two, and 2) a staff atop a stylized human head. To summarize, the Tiwanaku stone sculpture and Pis- agua textile renditions are most similar in that they display three design elements to represent the flow- ers. Thus these artifacts may be temporally associ- ated or signify a cultural distinction from Wari renditions. Most of the associated attendant icons dis- play bird-like design elements. The plant icon is often appended to a staff with a head motif on the bottom. The leaves are always represented by two symmetrically positioned design elements that are either diagonal lines, curved lines, or chevrons. The frequent lack of the seedpod attribute is curious since the hallucinogenic properties of the plant come from the seeds. Perhaps the icon was simplified to mask</page><page sequence="11">REPORTS 397 such information from common view and, therefore, such icons could have been understood only by a knowledgeable elite. The Hallucinogexiic Properties of Anadenanthera Colubrina The hallucinogenic properties of A. colubrina are due to the production of tryptamine alkaloids in the plant's seeds. Constantino Manuel Torres (1995, 1996; Torres and Repke 1996) has written exten- sively on the use of A. colubrina in South America. Recent analysis indicates that a specific tryptamine known as bufotenine (5-hydroxy-N, N-dimethyl- tryptamine) "is solely responsible for the observed central activity of these preparations" by the Wichi shamans of northwestern Argentina (Torres and Repke 1996:53-54). To activate this tryptamine and acquire the hallucinogenic experience, the seeds are ground and ingested as snuff, enema, or smoke. Ingestion of the seeds by eating or drinking is not as effective because the stomach produces monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme that deactivates some tryptamines. The plant's genetic cousin, A. peregrina, is also well known in northern South America and used as snuff, called yopo (Schultes and Hofmann 1979: 11S119). Within theWari andTiwanaku soci- eties, the ceremonial activities are often limited to descriptions of ceramic offerings, burials, trophy heads, and temples. The social behavior by the par- ticipants is poorly understood. With the evidence of the A. colubrina icon, I suggestthatceremonial activ- ities can be enriched by references to chicha drink- ing rituals and shaman or priest behavior due to the many ethnohistoric and ethnographic examples of the use of this hallucinogen. Discussion Along with its well-documented hallucinogenic properties, the presence of the A. colubrina icon on Wari and Tiwanaku artifacts brings to the discussion of politico-religious phenomena several new and interesting areas of further research into under- standing iconography and associated ritual activities. Staffs of Authority The wood of the A. colubrina tree is ethnohistori- cally documented to have been made into beautiful staffs that are highly polished: "Su madera dura y pesada se emplea de preferencia para la fabricacion de bastones de lujo, los que despues de barnizados presentan jaspes de bello aspecto" (Yacovleff and Herrera 1935:42-43). Currently the wood of this tree is commercially harvested and exported because it is very durable and extremely rot resistant (Eco- Timber 20C)0). Several examples show the plant icon positioned atop a staff held by Wari and Tiwanaku anthropomorphic icons (see Figures 4, 5a, 6a, and 6c). Depictions of mythical icons holding staffs are ubiquitous throughout the Andes since the Early Horizon (800-100 B.C.) with the north highland Chavin culture. Individuals may have used such sym- bols of authority to validate themselves as leaders in the minds of the Andean populations they tried to control. With a staff made from the A. colubrina wood, a leader might be more closely associated with the plant's ritual power and icon references thereby enhancing an authoritative social position. No Wari staffs have yet been found. Conchopata Vessels The Conchopata ceramic offerings may represent a ritual activity that ended with the smashing and bur- ial of ceremonial vessels. I suggest that the presence of the A. colubrina plant icon may help to describe the ceremonial activities preceding the burial. The current literature compiled by Torres indi- cates that snuffing paraphernalia are the best indi- cators for the use of the plant since "psychoactive plants are rarely represented in Andean Pre- Columbian artifacts" (Torres 1995:295). Indeed, analysis of snuff powder (Torres et al. 1991) indi- cates that the plant was known in the San Pedro de Atacama area associated with Tiwanaku occupation and numerous examples of snuffing implements. Snuffing implements have not been found in the Wari area, perhaps due to poor preservation of wood. However, the ethnohistoric literature offers another possible explanation of the plant's use. Yacovleff and Herrera (1935:43) provided an important reference to Polo de Ondegardo's sixteenth- century descrip- tion of this plant, referred to by the Inka as vilca. The vilca was made into a juice and added to the quin- tessential Andean beer, chicha. As a drink, the effects of A. colubrina's tryptamine might not be as effec- tive due to the stomach's deactivating enzyme, monoamine oxide. However, a similar situation occurs with an Amazonian drink known as ayahuasca. Ayahuasca consists of several plants that provide the tryptamine alkaloids (Ratsch 1992: 49-51). To allow the tryptamines to take effect</page><page sequence="12">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 11, No. 4, 2000] 398 another plant, often Banisteriopsis caapi, is added that contains an alkaloid known as harmine. Harmine will inhibit the stomach's MAOs and allow the acti- vation of the tryptamine. Thus, the combination of A. colubrina with another plant having harmine would allow activation of the tryptamine. I can only assume that the Wari may have discovered the use of a harmine additive to improve the potency of the vilca. Or the vilca was simply potent enough for some of the tryptamine to be activated. There are also ethnographic accounts of drinking vilca in the com- munities of Chuschi (Isbell 1978:151-158) and Choque Huarcaya (Quispe 1969:35-38) where it is consumed in an alcoholic drink or trago during the herranza or cattle-branding rituals. Thus A. colub- rina could be used in a drink rather than a snuff to attain the desired hallucinogenic condition. As a pos- sible drink additive, I suggest that the plant icon on Conchopata pottery supports a similar use with the most likely candidate for drinking being chicha. The numerous large urns and jars found at the site would have been suitable for holding great quantities of chicha, especially in a ceremonial context that might entertain a large audience. Wari-style ladles and cups could have been used to dip into and serve the chicha. Thus, large ceremonial pottery vessels might be another indicator of the use of this hallucinogen. If A. colubrina or vilca was used in chicha at the Con- chopata site, then there are further questions of why it may have been preferred over snuff and who might have controlled its use. Chicha and Snugff As the references to vilca suggest a social behavior of drinking an A. colubrina concoction in the Wari area, so do the references to snuff paraphernalia sug- gest a social behavior of snuffing A. colubrina in the San Pedro deAtacama areas. These behavioral activ- ities may indicate distinct cultural differences between the two highland populations even though they shared a similar religious iconography. I will refer to these distinct social patterns as the "drink- ing complex" and the ''snuffing complex," respec- tively. In the "drinking complex," chicha is important in ceremonial activities with ethnohistoric docu- mentation as a "drink of the dead" as well as an offer- ing to deities and "huacas" (Bastien 1978: 178-1 81). As the herranza and Conchopata ceramic offerings may indicate, chicha could also be emptied into the ground as an offering. In a ''snuffing complex" the use of A. colubrina does not lend itself well as an offering, but may provide a more personal relation- ship to the supernatural world. Hundreds of snuff- ing implements have been found with individual mummies. Based on analysis of such artifacts from the San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries, Torres and Repke estimated that the "size and chronology of the sample indicates that approximately 20 to 22% of the adult male population was using psychoactive snuffs c. 200 900A.D." (Torres and Repke 1996:43). The ''snuffing complex" could allow for large num- bers of individuals to participate, but they could do so independently to the extent that each person owned their own snuffing implements. In contrast, I would argue that the numerous large vessels at Con- chopata represented a "drinking complex" that sup- ported a large participation at one event. Thus, the Wari "drinking complex" may have allowed for group participation that involved the elite, com- moners, and the supernatural in Andean ritual activ- ities with numerous large vessels to embrace an enlarging citizenry. I suggest that the Bennett statue from Tiwanaku may document a synthesis of these two complexes during Tiwanaku IV. Below the plant icon, the statue depicts a deity holding a cup in one hand and snuff paraphernalia in the other (see Fig- ure 9d). Who Used Anadenanthera colubrina? The A. colubrina plant icon occurs on ritually smashed ceramic vessels that also depict finely dressed Wari elites who may have been shamans or priests. To determine which, I refer to Gerald Weiss's ( 1973) description of an Amazonian culture, Campa, in which the use of a hallucinogen can change the anthropological reference of shaman into priest depending on how this individual is perceived by his participating clientele. He provides the following useful details to distinguish shamans and priests according to ethnographic research: We think of a shaman as obtaining his powers primarily from direct contact with spirits, of a priest as one who earns his credentials primarily through special training (Lowie 1954:179). We think of a shaman as an independent practitioner operating on a part-time basis, of a priest as a member of an organization consisting of full- time specialists (Beals and Hoijer 1965: 585-586; Hoebel 1966:482; Jacobs 1964:281). We see a shaman as one who focuses his profes- sional skills on individuals, particularly for pur-</page><page sequence="13"> REPORTS 399 b a Figure 10. Wari priests depicted on Conchopata ceramic urns; a: priest is positioned between an attendant icon and a deity icon (after Isbell and Cook 1987:31). Note: round mirror is depicted in priest's right hand; b: Note: the beak of another bird is depicted to the right of the face image. poses of curing, a priest as one who leads group activities of a ceremonial nature (Beals and Hoijer 1965:586; Norbeck 1961 :103). We see the activity of a shaman as characterized by posses- sion, trance, and frenzy, while we see a priest conducting routine propitiatory acts of adoration, prayer, and offerings (Casanowicz 1925: Lowie 1940:3 10-3 11 ; Norbeck 196 1: 103-105; Shirokogoroff 1923; Wissler 1938:201-206) [Weiss 1973:4041]. For example, the Nino Korin or Callawaya are known as shamans rather than priests because they travel great distances in the Andes as curers or "med- icasters" forindividuals (Posnansky 1945:109; Isbell 1983:199-202). During the curing ritual the shaman uses hallucinogens in order to attain a state of com- munication with his sources of supernatural power. The ''snuff1ng complex" would include such indi- vidualistic behavior. Weiss argues that the transition from shaman to priest occurs to the spectators dur- ing such a shamanistic performance or seance. This point of transition occurs between the spectators' perception that one who communicates spiritual advice is a shaman and the spectators' perception that one who guides the worship of the spirits is a priest. In the "drinking complex" the bringing together of a large group of spectators would be advantageous to a priest in order to command their attention and participation in a religious ceremony with a hallu- cinogenic drink aimed at reinforcing the priest's authority over supernatural power. Thus, the dis- tinction between the two complexes may represent a cultural distinction between societies with shamans, such as San Pedro de Atacama and Callawaya and societies with priests, perhaps, Wari and Tiwanaku. On the Conchopata urns from the Tello excava- tion associated with the plant icon (see Figure 8a) there is an image of a person depicted with a verti- cal band of x's on his cheek (Figure 10a), and was positioned next to the image of a deity, not shown here. I suggest that the person was depicted per- forming a priestly role in a ritual involving the spirit world. This person wore a four-cornered hat that rep- resents Wari elite (Menzel 1977:31). He is also depicted holding a round, white disk in the palm of his hand that I interpret as representing a mirror (see Lavalle 1984:171, 185). Such a device implies the ability to control the rays of sunlight, thereby adding a powerful symbolic action to the ritual being depicted and possibly observed by numerous par- ticipants. On another Conchopata um, this person is depicted with stylized images of raptors positioned in flight above his shoulders (Figures 10b and 1 1). Such raptors are assumed to represent symbolic power. These raptors were depicted with large, robust bodies, stout legs with large talons, heavy beaks, beady eyes, distinctive yellow ceres, and feather col- orations (Figure 1 1).

Finally, group participation in a chicha drinking ceremony and association of super- natural symbols with an individual suggests that the Wari developed the role of priest to manage the increasing social complexity of their expanding polit- ical system.

He also commented that the crest was not drawn as in illustrated handbooks (De La Pena and Rumboll 1998:Plate 24) due to the normal behavior of these eagles. The crest only appears when the eagle is startled (James Clements, personal commu- nication 1999). I suggest that the Wari artist painted an unalarmed pose of Crested Eagles due to taming. In other words, they were controllable. With this per- son's image positioned next to a deity, his elite dress, the clever use of a mirror for ritual effect, the possi- ble control of powerful raptors, and the association with the hallucinogenic plant icon on chicha urns, I argue that this person was a Wari priest. In conclusion, iconographic study is useful for interpreting archaeologically known societies. In this paper, the identification of a hallucinogenic plant icon within the context of a religious iconography was interpreted to represent the communal behavior of drinking chicha and the ritual behavior of shamans and priests. The numerous renditions of the plant icon on other Middle Horizon artifacts suggest a pan- Andean cult or religion. When applied to the artifact evidence from the Wari site of Conchopata, the analy- sis of the plant icon suggested that the ceramic offer- ing ritual was the culmination of a ceremony involving chicha drinking by a large group of par- ticipants and controlled by an authoritative person. The person's authority might have been demon- strated by controlling the birds of the sky and the rays of the sun a probable deity. This person might have n - - j Figure 11.
