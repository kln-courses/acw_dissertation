<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEDIEVAL E U RO P E Lunette Spearhead British Bronze Age, ca. 200o-800 B.c. Copper alloy L. i5A in. (39.5 cm) Gift of Peter Sharrer, 1998 1998.540.1 The lunette-shaped spearhead is a masterful work of the British Bronze Age. Its elegant ogival outline, imposing size, and superb condition make it an outstanding addition to the few Bronze Age works in the collec- tion. The spearhead was almost certainly found in the mid-nineteenth century as part of the Selbourne/Blackmoor hoard from Hampshire, since related spearheads from that site are in the British Museum and all, including the present example, come from the collections of George Roots (I807-I891) and, subsequently, General A. H. Pitt-Rivers (I827-1900). CTL I4 ; . ., . It</page><page sequence="2">Celtic Sword Iron Age, La Tene III, mid-ist century B. C. Iron blade with copper alloy hilt and scabbard L. I93/ in. (5o cm) Rogers Fund, I999 1999-94 This magnificent anthropomorphic Celtic sword is also one of the best preserved. The beautifully modeled head that terminates the hilt is one of the finest surviving images of a Celtic warrior. The human form of the hilt-appearing as a geometric reduction of a classical warrior-must have had the function not only of enhancing the power of the owner but also of bearing a talismanic significance. The face is emphatically articulated with large almond eyes and the head with omega-shaped ears and finely drawn hair. Although the scabbard has become amal- gamated to the iron blade, affecting parts of the surface, its ornamentation and the exqui- sitely worked hilt make the whole an evoca- tive statement about the technical ability of the Celts, the powerful conquerors of ancient Europe. The sword is of a type associated with the La Tene culture, named after the impor- tant archaeological site on Lake Neuchatel in present-day Switzerland and eastern France. Other related anthropomorphic swords from diverse finds in France, Ireland, and the British Isles demonstrate the expansion of the Celts across Europe. As the first such object in the Museum's collection, the sword is a superb and singular example that richly adds to a select group of Celtic works of art. CTL u Crossbow Fibula Provincial Roman, 2nd half of the 4th century A.D. Gilt copper alloy with silver inlay L. 3/ in. (8.8 cm) Rogers Fund, 1999 1999-42 The sophisticated construction and elegant design on this aristocratic cloak fastener are probably an indication of the rank or wealth of the owner for whom it was made. The fibula is constructed of both solid and sheet elements riveted together: for example, the three onion-shaped terminals are hollow and are riveted to the main body, upon which are attached solid C-shaped volutes. The primary upper surfaces are decorated with similar repeating designs of arcs within circles, but each section is executed in a different silver inlay technique. Reportedly from the vicinity of Trier, the Provincial Roman capital of the Rhineland, this fibula can be related in type and tech- nique to others found throughout the Late Roman world. In addition, it complements a small group of crossbow fibulae made of cop- per alloy or gold in the collections of the Greek and Roman department as well as the Medieval department at the Metropolitan Museum. CTL I5</page><page sequence="3">Head of a Bearded Man French (Abbey of Saint-Denis), 1160-70 Limestone H. 6in. (i cm) Purchase, Rogers Fund, Ronald R. Atkins and Levy Hermanos Foundation Inc. Gifts, and funds from various donors, 1999 1999.97 The finely carved head is a fragment of the Porte des Valois at the Royal Abbey of Saint- Denis. The importance of this monument in the art and architecture of twelfth-century France cannot be overstated. The Porte des Valois, carved about II60-70, was not erected in its present location on the north transept until the thirteeth century. The relief carvings of the portal depict the martyrdom of Saint Denis. This fragment appears to have come from the lintel, which illustrates the judg- ment of Saint Denis and his companions before the Roman prefect. Removed during the French Revolution, the head illustrates the high quality of the sculpture produced at Saint-Denis a generation after the famous Royal Portal of the west facade. As the scholar Willibald Sauerlander has noted, the Porte des Valois holds "a key position at the phase marking the transition from the aus- terely restrained figure-conception of the royal portals to the more relaxed sculptural style of the last years of the century." Other fragments of the portal are in the Musee du Louvre. The Metropolitan Museum also has the only column figure to survive from the cloister of the abbey (acc. no. 20.I57), roughly contemporary in date with the Porte des Valois. PB</page><page sequence="4">Enthroned Virgin and Child French (Paris), ca. i260-8 Elephant ivory with traces ofpolychromy and gilding H. 7? in. (18.5 cm) Purchase, The Cloisters Collection and Michel David-Weill Gift, I999 I999.208 Few representations in ivory of the Virgin and Child can match this example, noble in conception and sensitive in execution, pro- duced in medieval Paris, the principal center of ivory carving during the Gothic era. The exquisite face of the youthful Virgin generates a tender aura. (The head of the Christ child is a more recent replacement.) The finesse and control of the carving, the soft treatment of the forms, and the maternal presentation of the Virgin can be related to the ivory Virgin of Groeningen (now in the Church of Saint Michael in Courtrai [Kartrijk], Belgium), a work possibly from about I285 by the same carver. Both works pay indirect homage to the earlier exquisite Virgin and Child from the treasury of Saint Denis now in the Taft Museum, Cincinnati. The interrelationship of these three ivory carvings is especially evident in the sensitive handling of the composition and similar attention to detail, such as the cord of the mantle and the necklace with a medal- lion. Here the focus of the work is on the human and loving mother rather than the Queen of Heaven. The statuette was probably set into a small architectural tabernacle, and functioned as a devotational object for lay own- ers, probably women, or for nuns in a convent.

Wixom, I998 1998.538a The leaf illustrated here typifies the decora- tion of "University" Bibles produced in Paris, primarily during the thirteenth and four- teenth centuries, in the regular cadence of its Gothic script and in its palette of red and blue accented with gold, combining delicate leafwork with charming imaginary creatures. One of three leaves recently acquired as gifts, the page represents the opening chapter of the Book of Nehemias. In the historiated initial illustrating the beginning of the book that bears his name, Nehemias, cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, kneels before the king and receives permission to make the journey to Jerusalem to oversee the rebuilding of the city walls. Complete codices as well as individual leaves from University Bibles survive today in relatively large numbers, the volumes having been disbound in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries by bibliophiles, dealers, collectors, and educators. It was the inten- tion of Otto Ege, a previous owner of the Metropolitan's leaves and a self-proclaimed "Biblioclast," to increase awareness of the history of the book through the dissemina- tion of individual pages to schools, libraries, calligraphers, and printers. BDB i8</page><page sequence="6">Double-Sided Pendant Cross Middle Byzantine (Constantinople), late Ith-early i2th century Gold, red, white, blue, and turquoise cloisonne enamel H. 18 in. (2.7 cm) Rogers Fund, 1998 I998.542 The elegant double-sided pendant cross is representative of the finest objects for per- sonal devotion produced for the elite of the Byzantine empire. Both faces of the exquisite miniature cross are decorated with intricate floral patterns worked in multicolored cloi- sonne enamel. The quatrefoil and palmette patterns are so similar in style and delicacy to the Museum's Middle Byzantine temple pendant (acc. no. I990.235ab) and pointer tip (acc. no. I997.235) that the cross may be from the same workshop, one argued to be an imperial workshop of the capital, Constan- tinople. Like the Museum's double-faced pendant icon (acc. no. I994.403) with images of Christ and the Virgin, also attributed to the same workshop, the elaborate cloisonne enamel decoration of the two faces of the cross is worked on a single sheet of gold, a tour de force of the enameler's art. HCE The Last Judgment, from a Book of Hours French (Paris), ca. 1400 Tempera and gold on vellum 33/ x 2/2 in. (.5 x 6.3 cm) Gift of Max Falk, in honor of William D. Wixom, I998 I998. 79 This miniature from a Book of Hours illus- trated a section of special prayers in French known as the "sept requetes a nostre Seigneur" (seven requests of our Lord). With its tessel- lated ground of red, blue, and gold, its figures set in a shallow landscape, and the precious- ness of its execution, the miniature typifies Parisian manuscript painting of about I400. Two angels herald the Last Judgment, while Christ, seated on a rainbow, extends his hands toward the dead. People from all walks of life-men, women, a crowned king, and a pope-emerge from their earthly tombs and raise their hands to him in supplication. Imploring Christ on their behalf are the Virgin, one breast bared, and Saint John the Baptist(?), posed at left and right respectively. BDB I9</page><page sequence="7">? f ,?t;l? i. .

Strassburger Werkstattgemeinschaft (Lautenbach Master) The Man of Sorrows and The Mater Dolorosa German (Swabia), ca. 1480 Pot-metal and colorless glass, silver stain, and vitreous paint Each 19' x I6Y in. (49.5x 41.6 cm) The Cloisters Collection, 1998 i998.2i5ab About 1480 Peter Hemmel and his Strassburger Werkstattgemeinschaft-a loose association of glass-painting workshops that had been founded three years earlier and that all worked in the master's style-were commis- sioned by the dean and chapter of the Cathedral of Constance to glaze the chapter house. Of the original eighty-one panels, only nineteen, including the present two, have survived. The Cloisters' panels came from the upper-center apertures in the second window of the eastern elevation. On a stylistic basis they can be attributed to one of Hemmel's closest associates; known only 20 1I</page><page sequence="8">r; . ; , ? i ' ;E l J i ~I fii's I :1 ' l I FI .^I. 1. 1. as the Lautenbach Master, after the parish church that houses his most extensive glazing program, this exceptionally gifted painter can be identified by document as either Hemmel's son or his son-in-law. The inimitable Hemmel style is typified in The Mater Dolorosa by the delicately 'A modeled features of the figure's fleshy, rounded face and by the dramatic exuberance of the drapery, its broad planes juxtaposed with tubular folds and deep crevasses. The lush Astwerk, essentially a translation of canopies and tracery from an architectural to a vegetal vocabulary, set against a rich dama- scened background, is an innovative hallmark of the Hemmel manner. The head of Christ is a mid-nineteenth-century replacement.

(47.6cm) The Cloisters Collection, i999 I999.206 Exceptionally large and elaborate, this reli- quary is one of the finest to have survived from the flowering of Iberian goldsmiths' work during the reign of Ferdinand II and Isabella of Spain (I479-S116). Drawing freely on the rich vocabulary of flamboyant Spanish Gothic architecture, the reliquary is concep- tually monumental and visually dazzling. The raised, pierced, cast, and engraved elements provide a variety of reflective values, while the architectural components create exceptional Man of Sorrows South German, ca. i5oo Ivory with polychromy and gilding H. 38 in. (8 cm) The Cloisters Collection, I999 1999.227 dimensionality and a dynamic interplay of voids and solids. The sheet silver, although regilded, retains the vibrant modulation of its original worked surface. On each of the long ends of the foot is a circular bosse in translu- cent and opaque enamel, one representing the Pelican in Piety, signifying Christ's sacrifice on the cross, and the other the Lion Breathing Life into His Cubs, symbolizing the Resurrection. As both images related directly to the Redemption of mankind through the Crucifixion, it is likely that this monstrance held a relic pertaining to the Passion. The silver is unmarked, but the con- cave zone capping the central vessel and the relatively small spire appear to be peculiarities associated with workshops in Zaragoza and, to a lesser degree, Daroca; the treatment of the architectural vocabulary, on the other hand, finds close parallels in Burgos goldsmiths' work. TBH This finely carved and well-preserved plaque sensitively depicts the quintessential late- medieval devotional image of the Man of Sorrows. The half-length figure of Christ, unclothed above the waist, appears between the mourning figures of the Virgin and Saint John the Evangelist. Christ is bearded, wears the crown of thorns, and is portrayed with his arms crossed over his chest, revealing the stigmata on his hands. The composition of the lower portion of the ivory relief closely follows Martin Schongauer's engraving of the Man of Sorrows of about I475 (acc. no. 5I.516.1) in details such as the finely rendered hands and fingers of the figures and the treatment of the drapery folds. Specifically, the depic- tion of Saint John's gentle hold on Christ's elbow, the sorrowful gesture of the Virgin's left hand at her cheek, and the manner in which the straight folds of the Virgin's cloak frame her figure suggest that the print was an important source for the carver. In addition, a painting of the Man of Sorrows of 1457 from the workshop of Swabian artist Hans Multscher (d. I467) and late fifteenth-century bronze plaquettes derived from it were the source of the angels holding the drapery in the upper part of the composition. PB 22</page></plain_text>
