George Perec produced a body of work unrivalled by his contemporaries; not since Joyce, perhaps, has a literary artist displayed such inventiveness or written with such versatility. But what, exactly, made his so great? Attempts to quantify creative genius should inspire mistrust, if not outright mockery; nonetheless, certain qualities do stand out. In addition to his other gifts, Perec had a singular knack for transcending false dichotomies. Early on in her monograph, Constraining Chance: George Perec and the Oulipo, Alison James lights upon this aspect of his fiction: wedding the experimental verve of the sixties, an expert eye for detail, and all the magic of a natural-born raconteur, "[h]is narrative works are most successful in bringing together formal experi- mentation, realist scope, and aesthetic achievement" (17). No one succeeds quite like Perec in establishing this nexus, even if to amateurs like myself the latter two qualities tend to outshine the first. To take but one example: the monomaniacal quest of Bartlebooth, the sad history of the Gratiolets, the mystery and melodrama surrounding Lorelei - such romans as these, rendered all the more vivid by the detailed richness of 11 Rue Simon-Crubellier, so engross the reader, that the constraints which inspired them may go wholly unperceived. In gathering into a single volume all the instances of chance, be it as a theme, a narrative device or a compositional operator, James has thus done us all a great service, for as she demonstrates with considerable aplomb, this token of human powerlessness underlies Perec's most diverse experiments with form. More impressively still, she gives us a sense of the writer's inner need, that special blend of optimism and angst that lead the author of Wto declare himself "97% Oulipian." Before proceeding further, we must first ponder the meaning of the word, "chance." Readers who dread a brief history of statistics may rest assured. James does not parse the old "subjectivist/frequentist" debate, or assay Kolmogorov's clever solution. Why should she? Her definition of randomness remains intuitive and malleable - now denoting "arbitrary," now "unpredictable," now "heteronymous," now "het- erogeneous," now "discontinuous," etc. We should commend her lack of gratuitous rigor, as it reflects the ambiguity allotted to the word (as well as to the phenomenon) by George Perec himself. Her introduction, however, does MLN 125 (2010): 980-1000 © 2011 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">MLN 981 advance a typology of sorts, one which subsequent chapters will exploit to great advantage. 1.) In locating chance at the juncture of multiple teleologies, Aristotle's Physics effected "a rupture between the order of efficient causes and the order of final causes" (6); Antoine-Augustin Carnot would later tweak this definition, placing chance at "the intersection of two independent causal series" (8). 2.) Anticipating chaos theory by several decades, Henri Poincaré detected between initial fluctuations (imagine the iconic butterfly) and their disproportionate consequence (think now of the resulting tempest), the handiwork of chance. 3.) More recently, Clément Rosset has observed two properties inherent to reality, "being-anyhow" and "being-somehow," which form between chance and necessity a fatal pact. The future, he argues, seems to hold endless possibilities - even a coin toss has two potential outcomes - though only one configuration of events can exist at any given moment; and so, as the future hardens into the present, we are left with the tautology of the way things are. 4.) Finally, Henri Bergson offers an attractively simple account of chance: whenever, behind the automatism of the universe, we fail to discern an anthropomorphic will, the mind shouts "randomness!" Of course, if we did not reflexively seek out causes of human significance, we would not find them lacking. It follows, does it not, that rather than abolish the supersti- tious mindset, the modern notion of chance reflects its negative image. The concept of randomness qua randomness lapses into incoherence - though skeptics of animism cannot dismiss it for all that. This, as James points out, leaves us in something of a bind: " [c] hance [ . . . ] marks a limit of thought and of representation. As such, it is at the crux of a specifically modern dilemma: the inability either wholly to believe in a meaningful universe or wholly to reject the quest for meaning" (9). Bergson 's view of chance may appear incompatible with, say, that of Clément Rosset - and indeed it is; Poincaré and Aristotle similarly fail to congrue. James, however, does not masquerade as a theoretical physicist; her object of study does not oblige her to advance a unified theory of randomness. Instead, she permutes her typology, arranging its constituents into a variety of combinations. The method serves her well, as "chance" in Perec appears under several guises. It appears, for instance, as a historical force, though Perec's views on the matter do evolve. James reads, so we don't have to, the early "theoretical" essays published in La Ligne générale. Dogmatic in his optimism, the young Perec banishes from history the merest taint of chance, a feat that we may admire for its sophistical dexterity; for as chance both confounds our powers of pre- diction, and leaves us helpless, its categorical rejection must entail a certain ambiguity. Thus, taking his cue from Lukacs on the one hand, Perec espouses a rigid determinism; and taking his cue from Sartre on the other, he affirms the freedom of individuals to act as they see fit - a coincidentia oppositorum if ever there were one, recited like the Nicene Creed. Already in Les Choses, however, Perec's faith begins to falter. Indeed, as if to repudiate his stated views, he muddles the very categories of which he once availed himself: the</page><page sequence="3">982 REVIEWS lïberum arbitrium, for all its transcendence, turns out to be a child of historical circumstance; and meanwhile the protagonists wait around for chance - that despoiler of human agency - to free them from their bourgeois existence. By the end, the three entities become so intertwined, one hardly knows what to think of them: as James remarks, "the tension between chance, freedom, and determinism is never fully resolved" (31). Not in any case until Un homme qui dort, where the significandy named "Grégoire Simpson" tries and foils, via a series of rule-governed systems, to spurn the gods of chance. Throughout the following decade, Perec's views seem to have become increasingly dour. As evidence, we may point to La vie mode d'emploi, where "the connection between individual destiny and collective history is represented as unstable, uncertain and in many cases devastating for the individual" (36) . The qualifiers "uncertain" and "unstable" smack of randomness, as well they should. History here evokes Aristode ("the word history serves to designate a complex causal chain that has unpredictable consequences, from the point of view of the individual," 36), Poincaré ("Chance here is not the absence of cause - viewed individually, all of the events narrated have explicable causes - but rather a term that designates the individual's lack of predictive power over events, resulting in a discrepancy between intention and result," 36) and Rosset ("A chasm opens up between the individual and history, but also between our sense of infinite possibilities and our powerlessness to determine which of them will be realized," 38) in equal measures. Its clout, moreover, seems matched only by its wanton destructiveness; for whenever History wields its grande hache - chance - it produces a catastrophe. And while we're on the subject of catastrophe. . . . Chance-cum-history assumes its most sinister form in W, though in a sense, Perec's autobiography renews the bivalent scheme of his youth. Deployed for maximal harm, chance becomes irrefragable law - thus matching determinism for determinism. Lest we absolve its victims of all responsibility, however, Bergson comes along to confuse us: once his "type" is implicitly mobilized, we grow uncertain even of our own uncertainty; maybe the Athletes are complicit in their doom - maybe, despite their frailty, they exercise some freedom of choice. As James observes, "chance has an ambigu- ous status in this context, standing as both a pretext for avoiding responsibility and a true limit to human possibilities" (52). We have, in short, come round half-circle, beginning with the best of all possible combinations, and ending with the worst. A writer of Perec's stature will not merely state his themes. As James observes, "the author's causal construction of events into a story necessarily implies a particular vision of causality, determinism, and chance" (65) - and surely the obverse holds true as well. How, then, does Perec alter narrative structure to accommodate his vision of chance? As a storyteller, he concedes nothing to the oligarchy of W., concocting the same dystopian blend of randomness, fate and uncertainty. On the one hand, he stages a depressing overhaul of Aris- totle. Pewpeteia and anagnorisis abound, but unlike the climaxes most praised by the Philosopher, these reversals do not suggest a higher concordance.</page><page sequence="4">MLN 983 In fact, such novels as La vie mode d'emploi seem less inspired by the Poetics than by the Physics ("In the cases of Hortense, Dinteville, and Beyssandre, the peripety results from an intersection of circumstances," 71), though Poincaré has his say as well ("these events are not necessarily surprising or unpredictable in themselves, but only in relation to the individual's reaction to them: the disproportion between cause and effect is a powerful motor of narrative," 71). On the other hand, local accidents propel the story forward, on to an end determined long in advance. The hidden telos of chance, like the inscrutable law of W., thus appears both imprévisible et inéluctable. Sudden in its twists and unyielding in its arc, La disparition embodies this synthesis. In this tale of gratuitous slaughter, digressions and reversals mask the final- ity to which Perec has condemned his characters: "the narrative can sustain its multiple digressions and twists while still emphasizing the doom that will strike everyone. In this sense, chance and destiny cease to be contradictory" (91). Nevertheless, Perec denies us the grim comfort of fatalism. "The officials of W," James observes, "deliberately cultivate the ambiguity between chance and design so that it is impossible to tell the difference between 'le choix du hasard' and 'un hasard de leur choix'" (95) - and in Perec's fictional worlds, a similar dynamic obtains. The unfinished 53 jours, for example, thwarts any attempt - either on the part of the hapless Veyraud, or on that of the reader - to distinguish between actual coincidence and the machinations of destiny: "Veyraud 's dilemma is troubling because it undermines the usual boundary that separates valid interpretations - of texts and of events - from paranoid or superstitious overinterpretations" (100). Have we, like the Athletes of W., grown a bit too servile? Do we too readily accept the author's Diktat? "What are the limits of interpretation, and on what level can aspects of the text be attributed to chance?" (102). We will never know, so deftly does Perec weave together chance and narrative. As in Bergson 's account, we can neither reject nor accept the hypothesis of randomness. Both as a historical force and as a narrative device, then, chance bodes disaster: clearly its prospect, whatever the theory used to explain it, remained for Perec a source of considerable angst. For this reason, chapter five (titled "A Challenge to Chance: The Poetics of Oulipo") marks a pivotal juncture, both in James' study and in Perec's artistic development. That the group's motto (anti-hasard) might appeal to one with such anxieties seems only natu- ral. To her credit, however, James refuses to take Queneau and company at their word. Does Oulipo abolish chance, or do its rules - as detractors have alleged - promote a form of automatism, one redolent of the very traditions (Romanticism, Surrealism) it claims to reject? By way of a helpful analogy, James negotiates a compromise between these contentions. Pierre Boulez, who works in a medium more amenable than language to mathematical "play," figures as a precursor. Having developed the serial technique to its stultifying extreme, our composer then invoked the privilege of alea, in other words chance, "defined as an absence of authorial intention" (116). Situating his afea within strict parameters, Boulez established "a dialectical relationship</page><page sequence="5">984 REVIEWS between form and openness" (116). In so doing, he sought neither to abolish chance nor to let it run amok, but rather to harness its considerable energy, to shape its outcome to his own "intentional" ends: "Boulez argues that chance is acceptable if directed and 'absorbed' by the work, and if it is used to cre- ate a mobile and renewable form of musical complexity" (120). According to James (and it must be said that she argues her point persuasively), craftsmen of the famous Workshop use chance in much the same way - tapping it as a powerful if somewhat volatile resource. Georges Perec, as mentioned above, deemed himself "97% Oulipian." Given what we now know, one might expect him to convert his despair into inspiration, thus dimming the apocalyptic aura of chance; and one's surmise would prove correct. In work after astonishing work, Perec erects randomness like a hurdle, and then proceeds to clear it. La Disparition serves as the most obvious example. Due to the purported arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, Perec's injunction against the letter ¿"randomly" restricts his lexicon. Rather than reduce him to silence, however, the grotesque rule prompts a bound- less (and at times irritating) prolixity; it also, as James reminds us, inspires more than one dizzying subplot. This impressive feat notwithstanding, La vie mode d'emploi represents the greatest triumph both of Georges Perec and of the movement he did so much to promote. James documents how - rather than passively accept their results - Perec used his constraints as a creative spur, accepting or rejecting them at will. "Perec's retrospective integration of the accidental results of the constraint," she concludes, "is precisely the dialectical movement that I defined as 'anti-chance' in the previous chapter [i.e., chapter 5], and an example of what Paul Valéry calls the genius's abil- ity to take advantage of the figures thrown by chance" (151). Sublimated by the act of creation, chance here manifests itself not as a catastrophe but as a kairos, or stroke of good luck. Perec's association with Oulipo did not vindicate the optimism of his youth, and James does not contend as much. Rather, she chronicles the taming of a corrosive force; she shows us how, in the laboratory of literature, Perec experimented on chance and with it, the better to probe the mysteries of life. Consider the domain of "infraordinary" experience, a matter of considerable interest to Perec and the subject of chapter eight. Perec coined this term to denote those fixtures of the mundane which, as a general rule, we fail to notice. How, as Perec would have it, does one "dig them out"? Circumstances may throw them into stark relief: though I crossed it a dozen times, I never noticed that fire hydrant . . . until it burst and flooded the sidewalk. But in thus attaining to the status of event, the "infraordinary" has morphed into his opposite; it has, in a word, become extraordinary. The "infraordinary" thus eludes us at the very moment it stands revealed. Though the dilemma seems intractable, Perec hits upon a handy solution. As James observes, "The insig- nificant and extraordinary incidents of the novel [i.e., La Vie mode d'emploi] are situated on a continuum, and it is, precisely, chance that represents the</page><page sequence="6">MLN 985 point of contact between the two domains" (210). If chance in the sense of Rosset - a violent disruption both imprévisible et inéluctable - elevates the "infraordinary" to significance (thereby negating it as such), chance in the sense of Poincaré - a discrepancy between the effect and its cause - allows us to extrapolate backwards, and thus to imagine its incipience: "The notion of chance concerns not so much the event in itself as this disproportion between the human significance of the cause and that of the effect. It is from this gap that the story emerges, as a sudden fracture in daily life" (210). No matter how it casts the die, Ou'vpo jamais n'abolira U hasard - but then, as we have seen, its greatest affiliate does not intend to. Instead, he turns le hasard to productive ends; and failing that, he learns to accept the random- ness of life, however dire his forebodings. Such is the message imparted by La Vie mode d'emploi. As James points out, Perec performs a running meta- commentary on his work by means of symbolic motifs - most prominently, labyrinths and jigsaw puzzles (see chapter 7). Correctives to the chaos of the real, these systems annul the world only to resurrect it as an orderly fragment, ceding total control to the monomaniacal "user." Of course, things do not work out for Grégoire Simpson, and for Bartlebooth they go spectacularly awry. The latter, having contrived the most elaborate zero-sum game in the history of literature, may be deemed the consummate Oulipian, one too purist and austere to admit of dinamen or alea. Accordingly, on the view of Jacques Roubaud, Winckler's final triumph marks the failure of rule-based constraint (176). The name "Winckler," moreover, cannot help but evoke that catastrophe wrought by chance and malice, the disappearance of E(ux); and given this resonance, its incompatibility seems fitting: after all, a world where W works as literal description must forever remain unintelligible. Having traced her itinerary from anguish to empowerment, however, James defends a more hopeful reading: "The gap in Bartlebooth 's puzzle is generally inter- preted in terms of lack or loss. In leaving Bartlebooth's puzzle incomplete, however, Perec carries out the positive gesture of opening a closed space" (223). Ultimately, if rigid systems end in collapse, the opposite also holds true: in opening oneself to the random mess of life - in tinkering with one's mode d'emploi as it were - one may at last find happiness: "What survives [. . .] is the possibility of finding happiness in a purely personal version of classification that does not claim to establish a universal order" (223). Thus ends James' remarkable conversion story. In relating how "Perec's anxiety about the destructive aspects of chance has as its positive counterpart a continual effort to explore its creative possibilities" (226) , Constraining Chance tallies several accomplishments - any one of which would suffice to make it a major contribution. As mentioned above, it uncovers a dominant motif, one which Perec's many gifts may nonetheless conspire to hide. Thanks to its exhaustive scope, moreover, Constraining Chance unifies an œuvre notori- ous for its baffling diversity. Finally, it offers a wealth of insight into Perec's major (and minor) work.
