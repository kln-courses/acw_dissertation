<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARTICULATED DIADEMS WITH TRIANGULAR ENDS FROM IBERIA : CHANGE AND PERSISTENCE Alicia Perea Dpto. de Prehistoria IH, CSIC, Madrid This is a journey through time that will take in four centuries, from the 7th to the 3rd century BC through the southern half of Iberia. The production of complex luxury gold artefacts emerged in the Tartessian area of influence reflecting the demands of a society with a highly developed hierarchical structure. Amongst the great variety of sumptuary objects, found as grave goods, one is of particular interest for us : the 14. C.

The oldest example comes from Aliseda (Cáceres), a casual find without an archaeological context, associated with other artefacts that indicate the composition of one or more typically Tartessian grave groups (Perea 1991, p. 163). It comprises 280 pieces of gold, including the diadem and a series of personal adornments. The silverwork includes a ritual brazier, and numerous fragments of other containers. There is also a bronze mirror and, finally, a glass bottle that, together with a gold patera, would have been used for the libations of the funerary rite. The Aliseda diadem (Perea 1993, p. 25; 1991, p. 153) (fig. 1) fixes the standard type that would remain unchanged for three centuries: a - a rectangular, articulated body, consisting of small rectangular plates attached to each other by means of tubular hinges; b - a triangular terminal at each end of the body, attached by the same system of hinges, usually decorated with different iconographie motifs from those of the body; c - pendants hanging from the lower edge of the diadem. A second articulated diadem with triangular ends from Cortijo de Ebora (Cádiz), a settlement in the centre of the Tartessian area, can be dated to around the second half of the 6th century BC (Perea 1991, p. 153, 162). It is exactly the same type as that described above, with technical and iconographical differences. The body consists of double sheet-gold elements showing geometrical and anthropomorphic images which have been identified with Tanit-Astarté. In contrast, the decoration of the triangular pieces at either end consists of zoomorphic motifs. We now find ourselves on the eastern coast of the Peninsular Levant, towards the end of the 5th century or early 4th century BC, in the heartland of the Iberian culture at the time of its greatest splendour, when vast quantities of Attic pottery were reaching the Iberian coasts. These Greek luxury products were sought after by the highest echelons of an aristocratic and warrior society headed by a prince who we would suspect to be relatively Hellenized (Santos Velasco, 1989). The Jávea (Alicante) hoard was a casual find made in a clay jar which contained a diadem with triangular ends (fig. 2), a round fibula with a chain, a bracelet and three necklaces of plaited gold wire, as well as silver semi-finished material and discarded pieces (Perea 1991, p. 225-226, 236; 1992, p. 252). The diadem is of the type created by the Aliseda workshop in the 7th century BC but is unusual in that it is not articulated. The body is made up of a very flexible, continuous and extremely thin piece of sheet-gold. The triangular terminals are attached to the body by hinges, which give the whole a certain amount of articulation. The decoration suggests the repertory of Greek themes from the classical period. These particular features formed the basis for three hypotheses : a - it is an imported Greek product; b - it is the work of a Greek goldsmith living in Iberia; c - the diadem is an entirely Iberian product (Perea 1991, p. 265; 1993, p. 27). In order to look at this question more closely, it is necessary to consider the techniques used. These motifs are defined by filigree worked wires filled with granulation of two different sizes, small granules soldered to the base sheet of the upper frets and larger granules soldered to the lower ones. The whole of the lower part of the diadem consists of three-stranded plaits. The piece as a whole displays a subtle grading of elements and decorative techniques of gradually increasing size, from the ova at the upper edge to the great scrolls of the bottom. Finally, the base sheet was opened with a chisel to make some of the ornamental features stand out. In my opinion the Jávea diadem must have been produced by an Iberian workshop, in which the presence of Greek goldsmiths should not be discounted. The social sector that could afford these sumptuary goods acquired other products and images, particularly Attic pottery, and with</page><page sequence="3">Bulletin de la SFAC 179 i 1.

They adopted the formal Hellenizing language as a badge to demonstrate their membership of a particular social class, but retained the traditions of the ancient symbols, which were still relevant. Another leap forward on this journey through time brings us to the 3rd century BC. We are again in the Guadalquivir valley. Two other diadems with triangular ends from two other hoards can be dated to this period, and their characteristics, in terms of association of pieces, are very similar, although we have no information whatever concerning the context (Fernández 1985, 1989). The hoard from Mairena del Alcor (Seville) consisted of a diadem, a belt, two snake bracelets, a torque of interlaced wires, a fibula, a finger ring, a hoop earring and two pendants, all of gold; there were also two vessels and a goblet made of silver. The hoard from La Puebla de los Infantes (Seville) is very similar and contains aproximately the same type of personal adornments, including the diadem, a fact that seems to indicate the standardized composition of a particular collection, perhaps a woman's dowry. If we now remember the composition of the Jávea hoard, it also contained a diadem and three necklaces of interlaced wires, as well as a fibula. Both diadems are made up of the same elements as the one from Aliseda, but the technique has now been simplified to its purest form. The plates of the body comprise very thin sheets stamped with a geometrical or anthropomorphic design, and the hinges have been made by folding over the edges of the sheet-metal. From the iconographie point of view, La Puebla is very interesting. Half of the rectangular plates show a female winged figure that could once again be interpreted as representing Tanit-Astarté, and the other half are stamped with acorns. The trian- gular terminals show a scene in which a male figure is flanked by a boar and a dog. When these two diadems are compared, it is clear they are two pieces of quite different quality, one very carefully made and heavier than the other. This same difference in quality can also be seen in the torques. The diadems would now appear to be subject to the laws of the market. A market which reflects a sufficiently broad and diversified demand to include different qualities and production costs. Why this morphotype should survive, practically unchanged, for four centuries ? The symbols of power are as mutable as power itself. The explanation can only lie elsewhere, in a suffi- ciently universal meaning to be understood over a long period of time, and beyond political and economic changes. If we look at the iconography, we see that all the images systematically allude to fertility, from the rosettes, whether in orientalizing language as in Aliseda, or hellenized as in Jávea, to those depicting the female deity, the Tanit-Astarté. The secondary ornamental elements also suggest fertility, for example the pendants in the shape of an acorn. The iconography of the triangular elements is very difficult to interpret, but seems to be based on the juxtaposition of opposites: the rosettes on the body of the Aliseda diadem contrast with the lotus flowers on the terminals; the image of the female deity on the piece from Cortijo de Ebora contrasts with quadruped animals that are difficult to identify; the same female deity on the diadem from La Puebla de los Infantes in contrast with the male figure between the boar and the dog, perhaps a late despothes theron, lord of the animals. It is tempting to see in this subject matter a semantic code that alludes to female fertility and the vigor and power of male insemination. A more obvious interpretation of these collections is as the dowries of high-ranking women that at some point in time renounced their wealth, probably as sacred offerings to propiciate what was most highly valued in a woman, her capacity to procreate.</page><page sequence="5">Bulletin de la SFAC 181 BIBLIOGRAPHY Fernandez Gomez, 1985 F.
