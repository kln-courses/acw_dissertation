<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Self-containment and self-sufficiency played, I believe, no small part in saving the Pueblos from the spiritual and material decadence that has overtaken so many other Indians. But they possess very little spirit of inter-Pueblo solidarity, which in earlier times might have allowed them more successfully to have resisted savage enemies. The same lack of cohesiveness today causes much difficulty to those who try to bring Pueblos together for common betterments of one sort or another. The archaeologist seems compelled to admit that in these vanished people there was possibly some "inner defect." It may not be scientific of him to regret this; but it is mightily human. Concerning the contributions of other archaeologists who also worked at Pecos or in related areas, Kidder is most generous. However, he observes and tactfully rectifies their mistakes, as for example, Bandelier's early description of South Pueblo (p. 109). Concerning his own mistakes, Kidder is not so gentle, and records them in precise detail: Not yet having learned, as I did later, that the Pecos were forever working over their kivas, laying new floors, renovating firepits, and remodeling deflectors, I failed to take up what was presumably only the latest floor, probably missing sundry alterations. And there are other confessions of fumbling. How- ever, it is clear enough that these self-reproaches are no indulgence; they are educational, cautionary, politely in- direct, but meant for us. Pecos, New Mexico stands as a unique report. There will never be another quite like it. But all future books of this nature will, it is hoped, be enriched by it. Cer- tainly, as an example to young students in whatever field, it will be a lasting challenge - in its clarity of scientific intent, precision of observation, pattern of un- foldment, and natural, readable and yet authoritative style. Also, it is a lesson in patience, as well as proof of the value of a powerful imagination to the study of archaeology. EMIL W. HAURY University of Arizona Tucson, Ariz. Digging into History. PAUL S. MARTIN. Chicago Natural Museum, Popular Series, Anthropology, No. 38, 1959. 157 pp., 1 fig., 10 drawings, 39 pl., 1 map. $1.50. Archaeologists who are seeking books to be used in courses and who are frequently asked if there is a book about prehistoric life in the Southwest suitable for a lay audience must be fully aware that there is not a single adequate publication on the archaeology of the South- west as a whole. The few such books that do exist are hopelessly out of date. This book does not fill this need; it does not attempt to. It does, however, provide an excellent account of one of the groups that occupied the Southwest in prehistoric times, the Mogollon. Without distorting facts and adding false glamour Martin has attempted to put some flesh on the bare bones of archaeological knowledge and tell something of the way in which these ancient people lived and how cultural changes occurred, instead of concentrating wholly on that portion of the artifact assemblage that has survived the passage of centuries. He has also provided information that will answer many of the questions of laymen about how ruins are found and how they are studied. Surely no archaeologist has been able to avoid the ubiquitous questions: How do you know where to dig? How do you know how old it is? What's the use of Archaeology? Surely everyone will agree that it is not easy to give clear and simple answers. Basically, this is an account of the knowledge gained by Martin and his associates in the 12 seasons during which they excavated Mogollon sites in west central New Mexico that covered a time span of some 4000 or 5000 years. Under the headings, "The Time of Limited Wandering, Emergence of Small Sedentary Communities, The Beginnings of Town Life," is given a concise account of the information gathered regarding the obtaining and preparing of food, the construction of houses, the making of tools and pottery - the general material basis of Mogollon culture. There are also conjectures regarding non-material elements such as social organization, cere- monies, and beliefs. Anyone teaching a course in Southwestern Archaeol- ogy will find this attractive and well illustrated book very valuable. The discussion of a variety of cultural factors should also make it useful in introductory courses in anthropology, and it can be recommended to inter- ested laymen. H. M. WORMINGTON Denver Museum of Natural History Denver, Colo. Reports of the University of California Archaeological Survey, Nos. 1-45. University of California Archae- ological Survey, Department of Anthropology, Uni- versity of California, Berkeley, 1948-1959. The Reports of the University of California Archae- ological Survey are many and varied. The UCAS was established in 1948 as a permanent activity of the Uni- versity of California at Berkeley. In 1958 another office of the UCAS was opened at the Los Angeles campus of the University. The purpose of the UCAS has been to "study and make known to the general and scientific public the prehistory of California." The reports in- dicate that the UCAS is succeeding admirably in its stated aim. Since 1948, 45 reports have been issued. Their range is extremely broad. There are accounts of surveys and site excavations, discussions of methods and techniques, and papers on ethnographic matters of inter- est to the archaeologist. There are articles which deal intensively with the description, distribution, and signifi- cance of items of material culture and there are reprints and translations of hard-to-find articles. The physical type of prehistoric Californians has not been neglected. Very useful bibliographies have been included. The sub- jects range from early man to Russian and Spanish re- mains in California. All areas of the state are included in their scope, from north to south, from the Farallon Islands in the west to central Nevada in the east. The 282 [ VOL. 25, No. 2, 1959</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS reports range from a two-volume synthesis of Central Californian archaeology to the short Papers on California Archaeology, several of which may appear in the same volume. The reader will be impressed with the extensive bibliographies that each paper includes. Every paper is further characterized by the most careful referencing. The research of these California scholars has been most thorough. Along with the reports on the archaeology of an area they include a wealth of information on the ethnography of the historic aboriginal inhabitants, on physical type, on natural history, on whatever may be pertinent. Volume 31 is an index through 1955, which further adds to the usefulness of the series. Though this series is invaluable to the student of California archae- ology its value does not end there. Students of the Great Basin will profit by the interest the University of California has had in that area. Those concerned with the problem of the antiquity of man in the New World will find several provocative articles. All archaeologists will be interested in the papers dealing with methodology. It is difficult to choose specific articles to draw to the reader's attention. The few mentioned are illustrative of the range of the series. A Bibliography of Ancient Man in California, No. 2, 1948, compiled and edited by Robert F. Heizer, is the first of several excellent bibliographies in the series. A thorough discussion of the whole problem of early man in California precedes the bibliography. The author concludes that although the existence of early man in the area is probable and some finds seem to indicate it, no completely authenticated, unquestionable discovery of early man has yet been made in California. The bibliog- raphy, which is complete through 1948, lists the refer- ences for each site together, and gives annotations when comments are helpful to clearer understanding. Molluscan Species in California Shell Middens, No. 13, 1951, by Robert E. Greengo, should be of interest to all who have ever dug in shell middens. Greengo has shown by quantitative analyses of refuse deposits that there are variations through time in the proportions of different molluscan species in the San Francisco Bay shellmounds. He has further suggested that this variation may well be correlated with a rise in sea level. Samples having a constant volume were taken from each mound on a vertical plane. These were sorted and weighed and the proportions of the components calculated. This analysis revealed the changing proportions of molluscan species. Gravel Pictographs of the Lower Colorado River Re- gion, No. 20, 1953, by Michael J. Hamer, is an example of one of the shorter papers of the series. Harner takes up a discussion of the curious anthropomorphic and theriomorphic alignments of gravel occurring along the Lower Colorado River. The location of all known sites, their description, reports of earlier observers, ethnog- raphic information, speculations as to their purpose, drawings, and photographs are all included. Temporal and Areal Relationship, in Central Cali- fornia Archaeology, Nos. 24-25, 1954, by Richard K. Beardsley, is the longest article in the series and in many respects the most central. It is an ambitious attempt to synthesize the archaeology of Central California. By Central California the author means the area around San Francisco Bay, Marin County to the north, and the Sacramento Valley to the east. Three cultural horizons, the Early, Middle and Late, are established for this area, which is divided into two areal zones, the Littoral and the Interior. The archaeological remains are divided into Components which represent human occupancy at a single location at a specific time. Components are grouped into Facies, which are vaguely defined as groups of intimately related components. Facies are grouped into Provinces, which are geographic units. I found this classification to be somewhat cumbersome. However, the material remains are carefully described. Sonoma Mission - An Historical and Archaeological Study of Primary Constructions, 1823-1913, No. 27, 1954, by James A. Bennyhoff and Albert B. Elsasser, sum- marizes excavations within the quadrangle area at Son- oma Mission. The remains of a structure were unearthed. A complete description of the finds and a reconstruction of the original appearance of the Mission, illustrated by easily read charts and drawings, forms the bulk of the report. Included are a discussion of all previous references to the Mission and early drawings and photographs of it. The recollections of the Mission by an early resident of Sonoma appear as an appendix. Archaeological Radiocarbon Dates from California and Nevada by Robert F. Heizer and Gordon L. Grosscup; Some Archaeological Sites in Western Nevada by Nor- man L. Roust, Martin A. Baumhoff, and Albert B. Elsas- ser, No. 44, 1958. Part I of this number is composed of two articles. In the first Heizer lists and discusses radio- carbon dates from California. Grosscup does the same for radiocarbon dates from Nevada. A discussion of the context and significance of questionable dates makes this report much more useful than the usual unannotated date list. Part II contains three short articles describing three sites in Western Nevada. The Aboriginal Population of the Great Basin, No. 45, by K. A. R. Kennedy, 1959. This report, the most recent of the series, deals with the physical anthropology of this area. Kennedy has brought together published data on skeletal material and on living subjects. To these he has added a description of the Great Basin skeletal material in the Museum of Anthropology at Berkeley. Space prevents an adequate review of the whole series. All students of archaeology, whatever their spe- cialties, will profit from a perusal of these Reports. MARY ELIZABETH SHUTLER University of Arizona Tucson, Ariz.
