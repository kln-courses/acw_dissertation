New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 195 pp. THE Judaica Series of the Yale University Press has just added a notable volume to its already impressive list of mediaeval Hebrew classics. In its effort to provide authentic English translations of the most important sources of Jewish mediaeval literature, the following books have thus far been published in the series: the philosophical work, The Book of Beliefs and Opinions by Saadya Gaon (882-942); four volumes of the fourteen books of the Halachic Code, Mishneh Torah by Maimonides (1135-1204); the Falasha Anthology, translated from the Ethiopic by Wolf Leslau; and now the Karaite Anthology by Leon Nemoy, curator of Hebrew and Arabic literature in the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale. Students of Jewish religion, both Jews and non-Jews, have, for the most part, concentrated their inquiries on those Jewish sects which existed during the period of the Second Commonwealth. Christianity came into being at that time; and in order to obtain a satisfactory understanding of the causes which led to its rise, the investigation of all material relevant to the sects of that period was imperative. Relatively less attention is given to the sects of later times; first, because they were of less consequence to world history, and second, because information about their origin and development is shrouded in obscurity. Dr Nemoy himself, after careful study and investigation of this problem, had arrived at the same conclusion. Dr Nemoy emphasizes that the inception of the Karaite inovement was occasioned by ' . . . a long and continuous ferment of anti-traditional schisms and defections going back almost to the time of the Arab conquest of Syro- Palestine, Persia, and the frontier provinces to the Easy and North, in the middle of the 7th century.... the leadership and the personnel of these pre-Annanite dissident movements were supplied not by urbanized Iraqi Jews, but by self- reliant and adventurous Jewish emigrants (and their descendants) who had left the autonomous metropolitan Jewish community in Iraq and had made new homes for themselves in distant provinces like Khurasan, Jibal, and Armenia, where they were out of reach of both the metropolitan Jewish officialdom and of Babylonian scholarship which, while highly diversified, yet perforce remained generally orthodox and conformist.... in their new homes they preserved the memory of the compelling motives which had moved them to emigrate, partly no doubt the vestiges of ancient opposition to, and deviation from, rabbinic law and custom, and partly the social and economic pressures exerted upon them by the Exilarchic and Gaonic authorities and by the property-owning upper class of landlords and merchants" (JQR, XL, 3[January, 1950], 308 f.). The revolutionary character of Karaitic activity was the inevitable outcome of</page><page sequence="2">602 Reviews the very existence of these Hebrew dissidents. They made their influence felt by their stubborn resistance and refusal to vanish from the world's scene. They remained a living witness to an anti-Talmudic Judaism. Some of their arguments against the Rabbinites - such as the assertion that the sages of the Talmud had an anthropomorphic concept of God - were later reiterated by anti-Jewish Christian scholars of Europe in their anti-Jewish controversies. Considerable interest in the Karaite sect and its writings was evinced during the period of the Reformation. Protestant scholars of the seventeenth century regarded the Karaites as Jewish Protestants. A scientific expedition to the Polish Karaites, to study their history, literature, and customs, was initiated by King Karl XI of Sweden at the end of the seventeenth century. Anti-Talmudic writings of the Karaites also brought into motion currents of heresy and rationalism among the Jews of Italy and Holland during the seven- teenth century. The rise of Bible criticism can also be traced to that period. The mere existence of the Karaites, the general awareness that there were Jews who denied the authority of the Talmud, encouraged men like Uriel da Costa and others to pursue their heretical philosophies. This transpired at a time when the Karaites themselves had, for some time, ceased to be creative and had abstained from critical investigations. A vital question which for the last few years has become the center of contro- versy in the scholarly world is the problem concerning the effect upon the Karaites of the sects which existed during the time of the Second Common- wealth. This question gained prominence recently in connection with the dis- covery of the so-called Dead Sea Scrolls. These manuscripts as well as the one discovered by Solomon Schechter in the Cairo Genizah and identified by him as Zadokite Fragments, or Damascus Covenant, were known to Karaitic scholars of the ninth and tenth centuries. It is well known that most scholars are of the opinion that the scrolls represent the writings of the sects which flourished during the period of the Second Commonwealth, and which accidentally fell into the hands of the Karaites. A small minority led by Solomon Zeitlin, however, believes that the scrolls are of mediaeval origin. It is obvious that these sectarian manu- scripts had a profound spiritual influence upon the Karaites after circulating among them. This is especially true of Benjamin Al-Nahawandi, successor to Anan, reputed father of the Karaite movement. The discovery of these manuscripts has, therefore, heightened the interest in the study of the Karaites. It is to be presumed that as a result of this renewed interest, the ever recurring problem as to the origin of the movement will ulti- mately be solved. Dr Nemoy once deplored the ' . . . abysmal ignorance of the true history of early sectarianism and early Karaism' (Semitic Studies in Memory of Immanuel Low [Budapest, 1947], 248). The present publication of the Karaite Anthology is, therefore, of timely importance. A concise summary of the contents of this work will bring out its salient features. There is a short but compact and informative introduction which traces the rise of opposition to the Oral Law. This is followed by excerpts from the works of fourteen of the most prominent Karaite authors, historians, poets, and religious</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 603 philosophers who flourished between the eighth and the fifteenth centuries - the most productive period of the Karaite movement. Dr Nemoy, however, has omitted the works of the latter Karaite authors of the Polish-Russian center. Chapter xv is devoted to excerpts from Karaite liturgy. Dr Nemoy's task was an arduous one indeed, especially when we consider the difficulty inherent in grasping and comprehending Karaite literature, a difficulty encountered even by experts of mediaeval Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic. Karaitic Hebrew, specifically the Halachic portions, presents a problem to the translator. This perhaps accounts for Dr Nemoy's omitting the writings of the eminent Karaite scholar, Judah Hadassi (twelfth century, Constantinople), and his im- portant book Eshkol Hakofer. Each chapter of the anthology is prefaced by an introductory section providing essential biographical data about the author as well as relevant facts about the translated work which follows. Copious notes help to clarify and remove obscurities. Dr Nemoy is the first scholar to have unlocked for the English-speaking scientific world the hitherto sealed portals of the literature of an important Jewish sect. The history of the Karaites has not yet been sufficielntly investigated nor has the influence of this sect been evaluated. Scholars the world over are indebted to Dr Nemoy for a splendid achievement in making available this anthology of Karaite writings.
