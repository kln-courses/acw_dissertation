(Plate I) The following dedications are for the most part written in Greek, and made to a god who bears apparently a Greek name; but their value lies mainly in the light that they throw upon the circumstances and fate of a Roman colony in a land where the educated spoke Greek, though the uneducated rural population long retained the use of the Phrygian language. Various writers have spoken about the inevitable fate of such a smiall settlement of colonists originally speaking Latin.2 They melted gradually into the surrounding population. After a certain lapse of years they lost the Latin language, and adopted Greek. The evidence for this formerly was fragmentary; but in the series of dedications at the Sanctuary an opportunity is offered of studying the process as it evolved itself through the centuries. At first the Roman colonists, still using the Latin tongue, paid their devotion to the god of the country and the city where their colony was established. As time passed they adopted more and more completely the Greek speech and gradually lost their distinguishing character. The native free population of the city (incolae) attained rapidly to the Roman citizenship. Probably before the end of the second century it was rare to find any incola of the colonial city who 'had not attained the Roman civitas.3 This Greek-speaking population of the Roman colony clung longer to the Roman names than to the Roman language, but they lost correctness in the use of the complicated system of personal nomenclature, and gradually adopted during the fourth century that type of personal names which may be called Byzantine for want of a more suitable term. The stages in this process are exhibited in these dedications, if they could only be investigated with full advantage, but to do so it would be necessary to begin by arranging the dedications in chrono- logical order, and this is involved in much uncertainty. The religious aspect of the dedications, however, is also not unimportant, and this side needs to be studied as a preliminary. ?i.

I9I2, pp. III-I50 gives a good picture of the situation and general character of the hieron of the god Men over against Pisidian Antioch (or, as the population and Strabol called that Phrygian city, Antioch-towards-Pisidia). Her article, being the result of a preliminary and hasty investigation of the surface conditions, was exposed to errors in detail (for which Professor Calder and myself are equally responsible with the authoress). On the day that she and Mr. Calder first visited the site they brought back with them four inscriptions, and reported that many others were almost wholly concealed under the ground. We had no permit for excavation, but we could uncover an inscription which appeared in part above the ground; and Lady Ramsay and I with a few men accompanied them next day, and cleared away a little of the surface earth around the outer wall of the sanctuary, in order to disclose such dedications. We also had to roam about exploring the large complex of buildings which occupy the wide summit. Sometimes we returned to the central sanctuary, and made copies of the stones as they were dis- closed. The eye requires time to grow accustomed to the appearance which the script on this kind of coarse limestone presents. More- over, the letters were filled with the dry dust of the earth, which made them difficult to detect. Often one of us was called from other work to help with, or to criticise the interpretation of, some dedica- tion; and the conditions generally made it difficult to attain perfect accuracy. In order to avoid suspicion we considered it wiser to do nothing more at the time, but to leave the place immediately and endeavour to get money and official permission for proper excavation of the Sanctuary in the following year. It was, however, necessary to publish at once a preliminary account in order to attract the attention of scholars and to gain support for the work of the following year; and the duty was discharged well by Mrs. Hasluck, who published seventy dedications. As an example of the difficulty of attaining accuracy amid the many calls on our interest which were pressing simultaneously on us throughout the day's work, I find the same inscription copied twice in my notebook. I was called from other work to express an opinion about it, and the reading suggested then is no.

From time to time I have quoted in the text or in a footnote examples from my own notebook of similar errors in order to show how the interpretation progressed, how near the original error came to the true reading, and how the true reading was so easily distorted into the error. 2 In 1912 we3 had the opportunity of prolonged study. Our eyes became habituated to the forms which the badly cut letters assumed in this hard stone. We also had the advantage that the rain had *washed the surface clean and no dust remained in the letters. Experience of the practical difficulties which encumber the archaeo- logical traveller's way shows how important this matter sometimes is; but to the scholar accustomed to work in a museum and in his own study it seems a matter of slight consequence. The stones which he sees in a museum are almost always marble; and the dust has already been cleared from them, so that the stone is presented in its purity to his eye. Moreover, dust is easily distinguished from marble; and does not deceive the eye; but in coarse stone like limestone or volcanic rock the dust is often hardly distinguishable from the stone. I give one example from my own early experience. One of the tombs of the Phrygian chiefs not far from the great Lion-Tomb, which we discovered in November I88I, was almost entirely covered up by the accumulating soil. It seemed probable that an inscription might be found at the side of the monument (just as at the side of the Midas tomb), if the ornate surface was cleared; and we employed six men to do this work. We found no inscription; the rock seemed never to have been engraved; and, when I published the old Phrygian inscriptions, there was nothing to say about this monument. When Sterrett and I re-visited the tomb in I883, the first thing that struck our eyes was an inscription on the side, just where we had hoped to find it, written in the large, deeply cut Phrygian letters. The rain had now washed the letters clean, and made them as conspicuous as they are on the Midas tomb: the soil here is simply the disintegrated volcanic rock in which the monument is cut, and the dust is of exactly the same colour as the rock. At first, when the perpendicular surface was 1 There is no room to restore wp. Mrs. HIasluck by a slip prints X [pJ, but there is only I on the stone (as her epigraphic text shows).

Professor A. Koerte has published this inscription, 1 which he naturally con- cluded to be a discovery of his own (as I have never re-publishedc the Old-Phrygian texts as a whole).' First, a brief statement as to the locality, supplementing Mrs. Hasluck's excellent description written when the discovery was fresh in her mind, although at the same time she was hamperedc by the inadequacy of our examination.. The building which in I9II we regarded as a theatre proved to be a small stadium of which only the rounded western end was built, while the rest was left very much in its natural condition, merely shaped a little in the side of a narrow glen east of the sanctuary without construction in stone.2 The more complete examination which we made in I9I2 showed that the sacred summit extended much further to the south than we thought, and that buildings, either destroyed or covered up completely, had escaped attention on our first brief visit, when we had not time even to walk completely over, much less to search thoroughly, the large plateau on the summit. We may use the term hieron to denote the entire complex of structures which cover the south-eastern peak, the sacred mountain proper. The central sanctuary is the special home of the god, a peribolos c. I40 ft. by 236,3 containing near the'centre the ruins of a small temple. ?2. The Buildings at the Hieron and the date of their construction.- The basis of the accompanying plan of the Hieron of Men, including the central Sanctuary and the adjoining group of buildings. scattered over the wide surface of the mountain, lies in a survey made by Mr. E. R. Stoever of Princeton University, who kindly- gave us a few days of his time in I9I2 after the excavating work at- Sardis was finished for that year. The contour shows an approximate: rise of iO feet. The zero point' is taken at the lowest level visible from point Y. The distances were paced, and the azimuth was taken with prismatic compass. The error of closure was ioo feet and 6?. I have made no attempt to distribute the error in the rough. plan now published. The outlines of the excavated buildings are put in on Mr. Stoever's plan, the situation of the buildings except about R and Q was indicated by him from surface appearance. The margin of error is slight around the Sanctuary and the Stadium,, but naturally increases in the wide strength of mountain-top, with. 1Athen. Mit. I898, p. Io8. 2 It is easy to complete Mrs. Hasluck's description and correct it in certain points: e.g. on p. I2, 11. 6-7 it would be necessary to read ' to approach the stadium' instead of ' to pass round the theatre '. 3 Measurements vary, and no wall is exactly parallel, or at right-angles, to another.</page><page sequence="7">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. I I the various buildings scattered over it, to S. and S.E. The " Priest's House" ought to be cleared of the fallen large stones and fully excavated. None of the other buildings seemed to deserve more attention than the probing which we gave them, except the one marked T, which deserves to be fully excavated, as it appeared to have some unusual features. Every scrap of marble, except the small fragments of dedications, has been removed either in Byzantine or in Turkish time. At' the north end of the summit and nearest to the city, on a lower level than the pagan sanctuary, is a church (mentioned by Mrs. Hasluck), together with a monastery attached to its southern side, constituting an interesting example of the permanent attach- ment of religious awe to ancient sacred sites. Four periods at least in the history of this church could be traced. The abandonment and desolation of the present day are the last period. In the third period a wretched little church and a few cells were rudely established in the earlier and larger church, doubtless under Turkish domination, when a small group of monks or devotees maintained the religion of the old sanctuary, being protected by the respect which the Moslem population of the new town Yalowadj felt for an ancient religious establishment.1 The original church, built probably soon after the pagan sanctuary was wrecked (c. A.D. 400), and a reconstructed edifice after ruinl during the Arab wars, dating perhaps in the ninth century, belong to the first and the second period. Near the church was a little spring of good water sacred to the Nymphs (Nyphai, as in a dedication found in the church). The remarkable features at the east end of the nothern aisle are perhaps due rather to the form of the rock foundation than to any intentional plan. There is a corner on the outer wall correspon- ding to the apse, and the northern aisle is carried forward to the east distinctly further than the southern aisle, and causes the exterior line of the apse wall to be deflected from the circular shape. The inner wall of the apse is circular. Expert examination is needed here. The monastery attached to the church was not excavated. The depth of soil was too great, and the results were likely to prove -unremunerative. There was reason to think either that the monastery -was later than the first building of the church, or that the entrance into the narthex through the southern door was later than the actual monastery, made through an extension of the monastery, so as to afford a passage for the monks and to include this southern door within the monastery. It ruins the architectural appearance and hence is 1 The Moslem population of Asia Minor con- tinue to feel marked veneration for the old sacred places, and sometimes actually participate in Christian religious festivals. [This statement, true until recently, may have ceased to be so as mutual goodwill was destroyed gradually.] It is recognised by most if not all travellers in Asia Minor that the so-called Turkish population is in large degree the old Anatolian people turned Mohammedan.</page><page sequence="8">112 STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. not- likely to have been part of the original plan of the church: but it would be convenient for the monks resident in the monastery during the very inclement weather which lasts for many months at this height, about 5,ooo feet above the sea. Continuing southwards up a short narrow glen in the sacred summit, we reach the stadium (west of which is the central sanctuary and beyond it the hall of initiation). Between the stadium and the sanctuary is a large building, which may perhaps be the official residence of the priest, containing many rooms. South of the glen is a broad plateau, over which are scattered various constructions and one large empty peribolos, all of obscure purpose. Above the top of the little glen to the east rises the loftiest peak of the summit, and in its flank just above the stadium, two buildings, the northern being perhaps a small temple of the goddess as Aphrodite, the other of the goddess as Cybele. The former is mentioned in Mrs. Hasluck's plan. We took it at first as a tomb, and this is possible. In the plan the doorway is wrong: it is a simple door in the wall of the naos. With regard to,the age of the buildings little can be at present established. I assume the conclusion arrived at in my article in the Annual o/ the British School at Athens, I912, p. 38, viz, that the sanctuary of the god Men near the city was built along with the city, at the beginning of the third century B.C. This sanctuary came into existence for the convenience of the city, remained in close relationship with it, formed the centre of the hereditary ritual of the state, and was supported as a matter of municipal glory and dignity. It remained, however, apart from the city, under the control of the hereditary priestly family or families who ruled the estates of the god as his representatives on earth, except in so far as a part of those estates was taken by the kings in order to establish the Seleucid colony. The whole arrangement was made by a com- promise or bargain between the intruding victorious monarch with his soldiery and the priests representing the old system (who were still strong enough to maintain an independent attitude over against the nominally supreme conqueror). The conquerors could not but feel awe of the god of the country.. They must propitiate him and avert his wrath. They did not consider that he was hostile; but they knew with perfect certainty that he was all-powerful in his own land, and that he could do them infinite harm if he were not properly respected. In the Annual loc. cit. it was also inferred from the entire absence of articles that could be assigned to the pre-Seleucid period that this hieron over the city was established after the Greek colony was planted here. This therefore gives an almost certain date. It was necessary as a mark of respect to the god of the land that he should have a lhome close to the city, in order that the citizens might have easy opportunity of showing their devotion to the god and making</page><page sequence="9">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. I I 3 due acknowledgment of every favour which he showed them, and finally of appealing to him in case of danger or trouble. Thus there came to be two hiera of the god, one on the mountain above the city and one in the country of which Antioch formed the metropolis and centre. The exact site of the other and older sanctuary is un- certain, but there is considerable probability that it was situated either at Saghir high on the outskirts of Sultan Dagh (Mount Olympos) or somewhere in the rocky ridge called the Snake which runs far out into Egerdir Lake (Limnai), dividing that lake into two unequal parts.1 No one has examined this extensi e ridge except in two very small excursions which we have made into it; but there is considerable probability that much remains to be discovered there. I should think it is more probable that the two columns now at Gondane, inscribed with lists of Tekmoreian contributors, were brought from some point in the Snake, than that they were carried down from Saghir. Inside the S.W. wall of the Sanctuary there is a large cistern about II 5 ft. long, cut out of the rock of the hillside to a depth of about 8 ft. The bottom of the cistern is rounded, not square. The cistern runs parallel to the wall, and is certainly later than it in construction. It might perhaps be nearly contemporary; but there is equal possibility that a considerable time may have elapsed between the construction of the wall and the cistern. It is true that no permanent sanctuary was possible here without some means of storing water, for the little spring gives an utterly inadequate supply and is situated at some distance. But it is also quite possible that in the early years of the Greek city this sanctuary was not a permanent seat of worship served by resident priests. It may have been simply a home of the god, which was visited from time to time by his servants and ministers. Already, however, during the Hellenistic period the step was taken to organise this sanctuary as a permanent hieron of the god Men, ranking in dignity along with the older sanctuary in the region of which Antioch became the administrative centre during the Roman period. This change had occurred before Strabo's time. There already existed two fully established hiera of Men, associated more or less closely with Antioch, when he wrote; and he does not speak as if this were a novelty that had come into existence during his lifetime. 2 One branch of the priestly family seems to have lived at one of the two hiera, and another branch in the other. The estates of the god were perhaps divided between the two hiera, but every- thing with regard to that early organisation is a matter of mere speculation and hypothesis: evidence is entirely lacking. Such an 'On the name and situation see f.H.S. I9I8, PP. I44-6. 2 Strabo evidently ranked both equally among the great ancient Anatolian religious centres.</page><page sequence="10">114 STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. establishment meant a residential priesthood, and necessitated the construction of a great cistern to store water for the use of the residents. Nearly parallel to the south-west side of the central sanctuary, at a much lower elevation and about 30 or 40 ft. distant, there was built at some later date which cannot as yet be determined, in most part constructionally, but in some degree cut on the upper side (N.E.) from the native rock, the large chamber which we call the Hall of Initiation. 1 For the purpose of the ritual service in this ball a supply of water was required. No new cistern was constructed, which proves that water for the Hall was not needed in great quantity, and was probably only used in some occasional services. The water was derived from the great tank in the central sanctuary. A hole was made under the S.W. wall of the sanctuary and mechanism was introduced 2 whereby from time to time a supply of water could be drawn off from this cistern. In the middle of the broad wall there was a little bell-shaped chamber into which it is easy to descend. On the one side this chamber communicated at the bottom with the cistern) and on the other side there ran out a conduit of terra cotta conducting the water towards a point close to the upper corner of the Initiation Hall. Here there was some kind of construction in mortar forming a sort of distributing centre. Unfortunately when excavating this part I was absent at the moment when the workmen came to it. The work was going on at several different points in the large complex of buildings, and I went about from one to another. Being called away to another point I left instructions with the foreman in charge, a Turkish Hodja of some education and our best builder, that he was to trace carefully the line of the conduit from the point where it issued out of the central sanctuary and follow it up to its con- clusion. I came back some time later, and listened with horror to his account of his duty. He had in a few minutes traced the conduit' to a point where there was a considerable construction in mortar close to the nearest corner (north) of the wall of the Initiation building. This he had completely destroyed in the hope of finding within it some treasure. The only idea even of the most educated Turk is that excavations are conducted for the sake of finding gold, and a small mass of masonry seemed to him to have come into existence only for the sake of concealing gold. Everything was destroyed, but the position of this construction shows without doubt that it was intended to lead from it one or more, pipes to supply the Initiation Hall. One of these must have gone along near the top of the N.E. wall which runs almost exactly parallel to the side of the central sanctuary. Thence it was conducted down the S.E. wall of the lIt is described in Annual B.S.A. 1911-2, pp. with photographs. 2 It was destroyed along with the sanctuary.</page><page sequence="11">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. II5 hall until it issued over a sort of trough in the extreme opposite corner (south), where some process of cleansing or purification was evidently performed. At what date the Initiation Hall and the construction to supply it with water were formed remains entirely uncertain. It may have been shortly after the formation of the central sanctuary, or it may have been at a long interval; but it is doubtless older than Strabo's time. Parallel to the south-east side of this hall another building was constructed, probably in the imperial age. Thereafter a pronaos to the hall on the same side was constructed, and the space between the two is so narrow that they cannot have been planned or built at the same time. The pronaos was a later idea,' crowded into a narrow space in the gradual elaboration of the hieron. Another stage in construction was marked by the formation of the little stadium. About the date of this addition we are reduced wholly to conjecture; as yet no evidence has been discovered; but it is probably quite late. After the stadium was made, a small exit from the central sanctuary near the north corner, overlooking the stadium, was cut1; and a sort of gallery was built out, evidently to accommodate distinguished spectators. We may naturally suppose that the gallery was built with a sloping tier of seats on the steep hillside, and out of the narrow exit from the central stadium came priests and priestesses and favoured guests to take their places in the gallery. The gallery looks over an intermediate building, possibly the house of the chief priest. The excavation of this house was carried out to a certain point, but then the great weight of the stones with which it was in considerable part filled up prevented further progress; and some mechanism for moving the stones must be applied, if the excavation is to be continued. We assume, therefore, that the entire complex of buildings originates with the central sanctuary, a roughly oblong space about 227 by 135 ft. in inside measurement,2 which is surrounded by a wall. This simple drystone wall compensated by breadth for its want of stabilising material. Mrs. Hasluck states the breadth of the wall as 5 ft. but this requires elaboration in detail, as the breadth varies in different parts. Roughly speaking 5 ft. is the breadth of the three upper walls, N.W., N.E., S.E,3 but the lowest wall S.W. was very much broader in order to form a support on the sloping hillside for the rest of the building. At first this wall seemred to us to be 1 Two inscriptions of very late character (Ander- son, 7.H.S. 1913, p. 28I f.) are built into the coarse reconstruction of the wall beside this little exit. 2 The building is rough and uneven, and measurements vary considerably. The N.E. wall is not straight. 3 The N.E. wall varies from 3 ft. 8 in. to 6 ft. 2 in.; it is by far the most irregular.</page><page sequence="12">I I6 STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. about 5 ft. thick like the rest, but in the process of excavation we found that it was really a double wall consisting of two built exterior parts, each being about 5 ft. in thickness, between which was a great mass of rubble. Thus the whole wall on this lowest side was about 20 f thick. The great breadth was intended to counteract the downward. thrust caused by the situation on the sloping hillside. The wall was originally loftier than the modern remains, which are still about 8 ft. high in parts. The N.E. wall of the Sanctuary is on one edge of the ridge the N.E. wall of the little temple is on the other. The temple and the S.W. wall of the Sanctuary are on the slope; and the slope continues and becomes more marked at the Initiation Hall and beyond. The contour lines were drawn before excavation began. The principal entrance of the central Sanctuary was in the S.W. wall. The doorway here is i8 ft. wide, and is approached by steps from the Sacred Way. Processions and single visitors coming from the city entered by this gate, and the dedications are so placed as to catch the eye of these visitors. The slope on this S.W. side is steep and it was a matter of difficulty to find or make room for the series of buildings which are crowded together on it. Immediately below this gateway there was a stoa, now almost entirely destroyed, and a narrow flight of steps leads down from the main stairway into the space in front of the stoa. There is a bounding wall of very rude construction beyond the stoa and the open space. This bounding- wall merges towards the north ini the outer wall of the Initiation Hall. Near the middle of the S.E. wall there is a door 4 ft. IO in. in width, leading out through a much destroyed portico, whose front was supported by two columns : the portico was covered with stucco, except that two slabs of marble adorned the entrance, one right and one left. This portico was slightly below the level of the outer rock, over which paths radiated in the direction of various buildings. or enclosures which are dotted over the high plateau to the south; but ultimately the central path led to Gemen, a name which is the modern form of rJ M'vok (Gda Mannou). This village was the central abode of the leading priestly family connected with the Hieron: assuredly this family did not reside permanently on the exposed peak beside the Sanctuary. Gemen lies in an extremely fertile opening among the foothills in front of Sultan Dagh, about five miles by road from Yalowadj ; and even apart from the name one can feel no doubt that this was the land of the god. Its fertility and sheltered position commended itself to the priestly rulers as their abode. Antioch, the Greek foundation, while possessing great military strength, has no other recommendation. It is far from a water supply and depe'ndent on a long aqueduct; it is bare and exposed: but Gemen is the ideal home of a rich priestly family. High on the</page><page sequence="13">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. I I7 peak above it resided the necessary establishment for maintaining the ritual of the Hieron, and doubtless there was a temporary home for the high priest when his presence was needed; while his health would be improved by climbing from time to time up the steep slope from Gemen to the Hieron summit; and, even if he were carried, the air is invigorating. 1 The N.E. wall of the Sanctuary is at once the most irregular and the thinnest. Great part of it is only 3 ft. 8 in. in thickness, but when a little door was constructed near the north end to give access to the Spectators' Gallery the wall was widened on the inside so that it is about 5 ft. 8 in. in thickness. 2 This widening gives a bulge and is done quite irregularly. At the other end of this N.E. wall, I4 ft. 4 in. from the inner corner, the wall suddenly is widened at a right angle and is 6 ft. 2 in. in thickness as far as the east corner. Here there was a slight platform on which were placed two statues, male and female, of rather over life size. The male statue has been almost entirely destroyed: the statue of the lady was left uninjured, when the rest of the Sanctuary was wrecked. We found her lying on the ground, but probably she remained standing for years, until there was a certain accumulation of dust over the platform on which she stood, so that, when she fell on her face, she did not injure it much. Had she fallen when the stone was bare, the injury to her face would have been more serious. These statues perhaps are a priest and priestess. The lady's name is engraved on the basis, Cornelia Antonia; but this basis (about 4 inches thick) was not intended by the artist to be exposed, as it is uneven and does not permit the statue to stand safely on'a flat surface. Evidently the statue with this narrow basis on whose edge the name is-engraved was originally let into the top of an erect (doubtless square) pedestal, on which it could stand quite safely. In that position the name on the edge of the basis was hidden within the pedestal. Basis and statue one piece of marble, 7 ft. 2 in. high. The statue, therefore, was used anew, probably about 290-3Io, and was made into a portrait of Cornelia Antonia'; but the sculptor probably intended it to represent an empress or some distinguished Roman lady, about A.D. I60-200. The art of A.D. 300 in Antioch was incapable of such work: the people of the Pagan reaction were certainly rude and inartistic, as the many monuments now known conclusively prove. Near her we found a pedestal, bearing the name TI BEPEINOC, and some scanty fragments of a statue (little more than a right fore-arm holding a broken staff, perhaps sacerdotal). Tibereinos was not 1 In C.R.

The walls were of dry stone laid without mortar. 3 See especially Anderson loc. cit. ; also my paper in Annual B.S.A.

This is proved by another dedication, made later by the same family (no. 202): XXv CLv CLITOXXAOHVSV CVXX jI LV CLV PRISCOV ETTAVRO L V S Here the forms of A, J, and XX, are indubitably late: the other letters are modelled on old forms. Perhaps Clitomachus put up the first dedication at his marriage, and the second along with his two sons after the death of Antonia. The latter may have been related to Ulpia Cornelia, sister of the high-priest Ulpius Baebianus, c. 300- 3IO (Anderson 1. C. p. 287). Why Antonia was spared, when the priest was broken so completely that only his right fore-arm and hand holding a staff (perhaps sacer- dotal), so much broken that no interpretation of its character can be hazarded, remains a problem. Did there remain a tradition among the Christians that she was not Antonia Cornelia the priestess but some friendly empress or other lady ? Did they mistake the statue for an angel, though there is nothing to suggest angelic character ? One thing is certain; it was not chance, but design, that left this statue standing perfect and alone in a wilderness, whose very gates were blocked, so that no one could enter, and where nothing else remained unbroken. 1 The last point which calls for attention at the Sanctuary is a little chapel at the southern corner cut in the thickness of the S.W. wall. This chapel seems to have been intended as a recognition of the 1 Not a scrap of the Temple, above the stylobate, was found, except two or three blocks of the lowest course.

The Sanctuary as a whole was dedicated to the god, and every monument or memorial found in it is dedicated to him: but in this little chapel several represen- tations of the goddess Cybele were found. The old religious belief did not permit total neglect of the goddess, and gave her this small chapel. This goddess, called Selene by Strabo, and Luna in a Latin inscription of the city Antioch (C.I.L. iii. 6829), enjoyed the honour of a festival (diebus festis Lunae) ; but the scanty monuments of the Sanctuary prove that to the initiated she was a form of Cybele. At the other hieron of Men 'in the Antiochian region,' she was in public called Artemis; but the reliefs are sometimes of Cybele type, and her priest was an Archigallos, showing that she was the Phrygian goddess, as recognized all over Phrygia. No clear evidence was found to suggest a date for the strange complex of buildings between the central Sanctuary and the Stadium. It is, however, evident that an approach diverged from the Sacred Way to enter this series of constructions. The large half-excavated building which we called the Priest's House, and which may have contained records of the Sanctuary, seems earlier than the Stadium The space between the Stadium and the Priest's House is so narrow as to make it improbable that both were planned together. The Stadium could not be large, because the little glen is not wide enough. On the other hand it is equally true that the space for the Priests' House is bounded by the very steep side of the hill on which the central Sanctuary is built. We may assume that the Priest's House was built first, and that it was not so crowded up as was the case after the construction of the Stadium and the complex of buildings towards the Sacred Way. The approach from the Sacred Way to the Priest's House is of course coeval with the latter ; and there was then an open glen in the hills with two small temples on the hills opposite the Priest-'s House. Later, the Stadium was constructed. There were no artificial seats for the spectators, who sat on the sloping hillside. The interposed Priest's House led to the construction of the high Spectators' Gallery, presumably for priests and priestesses belonging to the Sanctuary. These came out through the little door, constructed for this purpose. Then a pretentious but shapeless and ugly structure was built on both sides of the approach from the Sacred Way to the Priest's House. The shape is dictated not by any artistic idea, but simply by the exigencies of space. There was evidently an outer wall, very coarsely and rudely built, which gradually fades away towards the west and exists mainly for the purpose of furnishing a gateway by which processions might enter. The strange little construction, triangular towards the north and trapezoidal towards the south, excited our curiosity before it was excavated, on account of the tall, square monoliths of the native rock which stood</page><page sequence="16">120 STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. out clear from the soil; but excavation revealed nothing with regard to its purpose. The heights as taken by aneroid from Ak Sheher (assumed 3,274 ft) are: Pass over the mountains by araba road 5,564 ft., Yalowadj 3,550 ft., Antioch mean level 3,730 ft., Sanctuary 5,104 ft., Peak over hieron 5,230 ft., church 4,974 ft. The walls of the central sanctuary are roughly built, without mortar, of rough-hewn small blocks of the coarse limestone which forms the mass of the peak; they are not quite straight; and especially the long north-east wall bends a good deal from the straight, and in one place (not far from the east corner) turns inwards at a right-angle for 21 feet. Externally the divergence from the straight line of the wall is not so marked; and this illustrates the roughness of the work. The breadth varies, and hides the divergence. Mrs. Hasluck on p. 2II describes the stones of the sanctuary wall, on which most of the inscriptions are engraved, as ' soft '. This is hardly the correct term. She is referring to the fact that the stone splinters easily; and ' brittle', the adjective which she employed in another place, is more correct. The injuries from which the stones have suffered are the result much more of splintering, either when the dedications were incised on them by the chisel, or during sub- sequent bad -usage, than of the wearing action of weather. There is, however, one stone at least which may rightly be called soft: it lies in front of the north-west side, and bears an enigmatic inscription mentioning a number of persons (no. 9A). This stone has suffered much from weathering, being worn away apparently by rain, so that the lines of the letters have been widened and broadened. An inscription of this character is in my experience the most difficult of all to decipher, because the old lines change their look and character, new lines are worn by the rain in the softest parts, and the result is to present a text where guesswork must hold far too great a place in the interpretation. It is remarkable that on the sacred summit hardly any traces of the Hellenistic period were found. One inscription certainly is older than the Roman period and may belong to the second century B.C. Another may be pre-Roman, but is equally likely to be of the time of Amyntas. Pottery of the Hellenistic age is rare; most of it is distinctly of the Roman age. It would therefore appear that the hieron was not much frequented by the population of the Greek city in the third and second centuries B.C. No coins earlier than the first century B.C. were found at the hieron or in the city. On the other hand the coins which are found prove conclusively that after the destruction of the central sanctuary the summit was not much visited by the people of the city. No coins later than -the fourth century were found anywhere except in the church,' 1 If any visitor finds one Byzantine coin lying on the ground a little north of the central sanctuary he may understand that this wvas brought to me from the lower town, and was accidentally lost.</page><page sequence="17">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. I2I although in other places, e.g. on the site of the city, Byzantine coins were much more numerous than those of the Roman or Greek period. It is quite probable that if the monastery were excavated Byzantine coins would be found there, as in the church. It was established with certainty in the course of the excavations in I9I2 that the main sanctuary was completely destroyed probably towards A.D. 400. The intention of the Christian destroyers who wrecked it was to leave it a howling wilderness into which no man could enter. 1 The entrance was deliberately blocked up, and almost all the votive stelai which were erected in great numbers in the open space of the sanctuary were broken in pieces with the intention of deliberate wreckage. In one case, at least, parts of the same stele were found remote from one another, inside and outside the sanctuary. I have grouped together not merely those inscriptions which stood actually along the Sacred Way and in the sanctuary wall, but also those that were found outside the sanctuary and a few in the adjoining buildings. They are all of the same general character and show only a small number of types, so that there is a wearisome monotony in the whole group. ?3. The Enduring Sanctity of the Holy Place.-Many of the in- scriptions were found in the large cistern about 8 feet deep and I I5 long, which extends inside the sanctuary parallel to the side B.C. between this and the little temple K.L.M.N.2 which stood near the centre of the open space. Into this cistern, which had been intended originally to contain water for maintaining the religious services throughout the dry summer months, fragments of architecture and sculpture were hurled with a savage desire to destroy everything and hide the remains, while at the same time the lack of water thus pro- duced made it practically impossible to live on the summit of the hill, for the small spring beside the Christian church carries only a slight trickle of water, good and cold, but so scanty that it takes several minutes to fill a small cup. The water may have been more abundant of old. In any case it is clearly indicated as a ' Huda- verdi '(God has given3), both by its position on the peak of a moun- tain, and by the excellence of the water.4 Mrs. Hasluck thought the water had some medicinal quality: the mountain certainly had some metallic character (see next paragraph). The sacredness of this peak was indicated in various ways. The mere presence of a spring on this lofty point was an obvious indi- ISee Anderson, 7.R.S. I9I3, p. z68 f. 2 The letters are those used in Mrs. Hasluck's plan. 3 The name is given only to springs of potable water. At Apameia-Kelainai there is only one Huda-verdi, for the water of all the other springs is undrinkable: see C.B. Phr. ii, p. 400. 4 In Cont. Rev. I912, Sept., p.372 f. the view and scenery and fountain are described as dictating the choice of this home for the god. Perhaps also the new bieron had some resemblance to the old Phrygo-Pisidian theocratic centre.</page><page sequence="18">I22 STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. cation of divine power, and it was interesting to find among the numerous inscriptions which had been employed in building the church one dedicated to the Nymphs, the only certain exception to the otherwise universal rule that all the inscribed dedications on the peak are to the god Men. It also probably contributed to the sacredness of the spot that haematite ore is found there. Among the scraps of limestone which are broken from the main rock of the hill there lie scattered here and there a number of fragments of a different stone, very heavy. I submitted one of these for examination to my friend Mr. Edwin Whittall in Constantinople. suspecting that these fragments were pieces of ore of soine kind it was pronounced to be haematite of good quality. There is no appearance on any part of the hill which we saw to show that the rock of which the hill is composed is anything but the ordinary brittle limestone of which all the buildings are constructed, but the presence of so many pieces of haematite prove that in some part of the hill there must be a body of haematite. I add that the Turkish Kaimmakam showed' me a piece of what I took to be lignite. It looked black, like very bad coal, and he told me that it burned. It disintegrated easily in water, and the piece which I carried away for examination either disintegrated or was lost. This mineral was said to be abandant at some point not far away from Antioch, and the possibility may be suggested that iron was worked there in old time, though I do not know whether iron was extracted from haematite by the ancients. A long interval elapsed between the thorough-going destruction of the central sanctuary and the foundation of the modern town of Yalowadj. The old city of Antioch continued to be inhabited probably until the Turkish conquest, and it was only when the aqueduct broke down and the supply of water failed that the ancient site was deserted. The result therefore was that no fragments have been found in the modern town which could be identified as certainly brought from the sanctuary. Every piece of marble in Yalowadj may be regarded as brought either from the actual site of Antioch or from the tombs in the neighbourhood or from the site of Gemen, where there was apparently some sacerdotal establishment connected with the estates. Even the inscriptions mentioning the chest of the sanctuary and its administration are to be regarded as brought from graves connected with the city, and not from the actual site of the central sanctuary. At the sanctuary no sepulchral inscription has been found, with the solitary exception of one which belongs to the Hellenistic period, when probably the great complex of buildings had not yet come into existence and the single central sanctuary was the only construction at the site. It is true that numerous graves were made on the sides of the sacred mountain. We ex-</page><page sequence="19">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. I23 cavated a certain number of them, but found nothing to reward the investigation. They were the graves of poor people containing nothing valuable or interesting and no written epitaph. It is, however, certain that the old Anatolian custom was practised here to bury the dead around and near the sanctuarv. The dead were brought back to the divine home. Just as in the Christian period the habit persisted of burying the dead ad martyres, so it was in the old Anatolian custom: the temple of the local deity was the centre of a gradually extending cemetery. In the Hellenistic period, when the establishment on the mountain peak was still small, graves were probably constructed closer up to the sanctuary, and thus the solitary example of a sepulchral stele may have been brought into the sanctuary when the orgy of destruction was carried out and stones were tossed about hither and thither and in manv cases deliberately broken. One inscribed stone of the outer wall was found inside the sanctuary, having been transported fully 50 ft. Another was found in. the great cistern. Besides this Anatolian custom there also existed the Greek habit of burying the dead along the roads which led out from the city. This class of tombs extends far out, and is usually more imposing architecturally. The graves on the sacred mountain make no appearance aboveground. ?4. The Sacred Way from the City to the Sanctuary, and the Dedications along its course.-Along the Sacred Way leading from Antioch to the central sanctuary there was formerly a series of dedications to the god Men, sometimes inscribed with writing, sometimes only showing the stereotyped outline of a naiskos (aedicula) with pointed gable, without inscription. Frequently a set of two to seven naiskoi form one single group dedicated by a family, or by some company of individuals. The limestone of the rocks along the Sacred Way is very brittle, and in the course of our experience, I9II-I3, several of these dedications disintegrated and disappeared (see no. i). After our first visit the natives began to go more frequently to the summit in search of valuables, and when we established ourselves there in I9I2 the feet of men and. pack-animals formed a path ascending from the modern town, which did harm to the remains of the old Sacred Way. Mrs. Hasluck describes correctly the scanty traces of the ancient Sacred Way, which winds up round the shoulder of a mountain overhanging the left bank of the Anthios," and crosses a ravine to ascend a higher peak to the south-east on which the group of buildings 1 Antioch was situated on the right bank of the river, which runs in a deep, narrow gorge. The rocks on the left side (south-east) are higher than on the right; but they are equally precipitous.</page><page sequence="20">I24 STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. constituting the hieron was placed. In the very brief time which we could devote to these buildings in I9II, it was impossible to obtain a correct idea of their relation to one another ; but in I9I2 and I9I3 we learned a little more about this extensive group of buildings. In the Annual of the British School at Athens, I912, I have described one of those buildings, which was entirely concealed by super- incumbent soil when we first visited the spot, and which well rewarded complete excavation. We regard it as the Initiation Hall. In the present article or elsewhere I hope to publish the whole series of dedicatory inscriptions found on the Sacred Way, and in the central sanctuary, the Initiation Hall and the neighbouring buildings. Where the Sacred Way passes under the east end of the church the rocks were formerly covered with dedications none of which had any writing that could be deciphered, and it is hardly possible now to be quite certain that any of them were inscribed. South of the church, not far from the stadium, the Sacred Way turns up towards the right (west), and then bends back southwards round low rocks about the point where in Mrs. Hasluck's plan the word 'buildings ' is inscribed. On these rocks also dedications were incised, but only one of them could be read (no. z). Then the Sacred Way reached the western corner B of the central sanctuary and passed close along the south-western wall to the point H, 1 where it entered by a flight of steps and a broad gateway. A large series of dedicatory inscriptions was inscribed on this south-western wall between B and H. A few were inscribed on the north-western wall near B and a few also on the south-western wall between H and c. It is obvious that, as Mrs. Hasluck rightly per- ceived, the inscriptions clustered most closely in places where they would catch the eye of visitors to the sanctuary, as they passed along the Sacred Way. They line the Way, yet they are distributed sporadically. Probably the visitors made their dedication at any point where the spirit moved them : either something occurred externally (especially a sign in the air, as the flight of a bird or some phenomenon in the heaven), or some inward prompting revealed the exercise of divine power; and there by the Sacred Way the dedication was made to the god Men, who had manifested his power. One thinks of the method of Epimenides in purifying Athens: wherever any of the sheep, black and white, which he turned loose, lay down to rest, he, with the 8'py,ua2 'EyLuEZ4EaoP, saw the hidden god, and built an altar r"c IpOO-4KOZYTtJ 86X, to the local mani- festation- of divine power. On the sacred mountain there was no I The letters of Mrs. Hasluck's plan are adopted. 2 Corrupted to 8' a in Souidas, a meaningless saying, although there are some scholiastic ex- planations of it. The correction, which is con- vincing, was made by Calder: the 'glance of Epimenides' was needed in the case of hidden mysterious things (dri T7v aiwoOe'-rv): Ramsay in Qssarterly Review, I919, p. 389.</page><page sequence="21">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. 125 cUnknown God,' as was once at least the case at Athens: on the holy hill there could be no god but Men himself. 1 In a number of cases the outline of the dedicatory naiskos traced on the stone shows in the middle of the lower side what is evidently intend-ed to be the picture of a projecting spike. These evidently imitated a common form of free-standing dedicatory stelai with a spike at the bottom by which to stick them into the earth. This form of cheap and easily handled stelai was very widely used in Anatolia. At Nakoleia I found in I883 a considerable number of them inscribed (according to my view) at once as epitaphs to the dead man who has become a god, and as dedications to the god himself in heaven, with whom the dead man is identified. These I have published in 7.H.S. I884, p. 257; and we have seen a con- siderable number of similar rough stelai elsewhere, all having a spike at the bottom intended to stick into the earth and hold the stele upright. ?5. Age to which the Dedications belong.-It is a difficult and probably insoluble problem to determine the exact date, or even the chronological succession, of all the dedicatory inscriptions.2 The form of the letters furnishes no sufficient criterion, for there is very little variety: sometimes the letters are more rudely formed, but this might be due to awkwardness and inexperience in the stone- cutter. In some rare cases the shape of the writing differs from the ordinary custom, and these must be noted. In general there is one style of writing, viz. the ordinary round form, which was usual and which lasted for centuries; at what period it began in Antioch is difficult to state; probably it was in regular use in the first century. This form suited the stone) which is hard and brittle and splinters easily; the letters are therefore not deeply cut. On the whole the general impression given at first by the whole series was that they are late; but, while starting with this theory to investigate the problem as a whole, I have regarded it as merely a guiding hypo- thesis; and after careful study I conclude that the dedications begin not very long after the foundations-of the Roman Colonia, and that our first impression was not fully correct. This first impression was well stated by Mrs. Hasluck, ' Their general appearance would place them in the second or third century A.D. They are for the most part so roughly engraved on the poor, friable limestone that they lack more definite characteristics; but no. 68 which is engraved on marble is more decisive. It could not "I cannot doubt that the dedication 'an Un- known God' (Acts xvii, 23) was attributed to Epimenides: the speech of Paul to the Council of Areopagus is full of the spirit of Athens and of Epimenides, and a verse from a poem attributed to the Cretan prophet is a marked feature in Paul's argument, as Rendel Harris detected: see my paper in Quarterly Review, 9I 9. 2 The dedications on marble, found mostlyinside the central sanctuary, can be dated with much greater confidence than those cut on the wall, and often furnish a norm for the latter.</page><page sequence="22">126 ITUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. be placed earlier than A.D. 3co, and with it must go all that contain a strange word TEKuOpEV'o-a. 1 These can hardly be dissociated from the group of inscriptions of the Tekmoreian Guest-friends which have been placed on indisputable evidence in the period A.D. 250-320. A distinction must be made. There are some inscriptions which must almost certainly be placed in the nfrst century. They bear the marks of antiquity, and some are connected with families which probably spring from the original coloni, possibly in the second-fourth generation after the foundation of the colonia. The dedications form a series from the first to the fourth century; but they were far most frequent in late time. Thus, in the mass, the evidence once more forces me to much the same conclusion as Mrs. Hasluck has stated, with certain exceptions. One objection to this late date is mentioned and correctly discussed byher, 7.H.S. I9I2, pp. 147, I48: ' If this dating be correct, how can the utter lack of names containing the pseudo-praenomen Aur. be explained ? Elsewhere it has been regarded as an unfailing characteristic of a group of third- century inscriptions that a certain number of names with Aur. as a sort of pseudo-praenomen are sure to occur among them. Here, among nearly IOO names,2 none of that type occur. The reason however, has been already foreshadowed. The pseudo-praenomen was, as Sir W. M. Ramsay suggested in 7.H.S. 1883, p. 30, assumed very widely as the mark of Roman rank, when Caracalla about A.D. 2I2 conferred the full civitas on all peregrini and Latini domiciled in the Roman Empire. The name Aurelius, therefore, could not occur except by accident and very rarely among the citizens of a Roman colonia, who possessed the civitas independently of Caracalla's gift and had their own Latin nomina and praenomina- They and their liberti are the dedicants, and we have inferred from the situation that they usually had nomina (though many of these are not engraved). On the other hand, with a few rare exceptions, the people who belonged to the religious association called the " Tekmoreian Guest-friends " 3 were the cultivators of imperial estates,4 who occupied a very inferior position before the law of Rome, and whose families rarely'had the civitas before Caracalla. 'The contrast between the nomenclature in these two con- temporary groups of documents, though striking, is quite natural. ' All that is here said is, as must be repeated, provisional. It is difficult and often impossible, to distinguish between Roman freedmen and Greeks who had received the civitas, or to decide whether a name like the simple Lyciscus is to be regarded as the purely Hellenic name of an incola of Antioch, or the cognomen, used I That this word indicates quite late date may be taken as certain. 2 The number is now very much greater, but Aur. as a pseudo-praenomen is still almost as rare as ever. 3 The inscriptions of this society are collected in Studies in the Eastern Provinces, p. 300 ff. Annual, 9rz, loc. cit. 4 On imperial estates in the East the pseudo- praenomen Aur. is almost universal.</page><page sequence="23">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. 127 alone, of an incola civitate donatus. Excavation, by revealing more inscriptions, may facilitate distinction and give more certainty regarding date. If we could attain certainty as to the time when. all incolae received the civitas, this would be an important step.' One criterion of date is correctly recognised by her, and has been fully confirmed by many subsequent discoveries. All dedications containing the verb TEKUOpEVELV are quite late; and these form a considerable body which give a good foundation to work on. Mrs. Hasluck knew only one instance of this formula in a dedication. There are now approximately Ioo (many, however, being so broken as to be valueless). Mrs. Hasluck has stated correctly the general principles which must be followed in regard to the interpretation of the names; but naturally, with the greatly increased number of dedications, it is possible now to carry out these principles more completely. ?6. Occasions on which the Dedicatiotns were made.-In all probability such dedications were not made without some deftnite reason and special occasion: e.g. in no. 6o a duumvir makes his dedication probably to celebrate his election to the supreme office, and to express his gratitude for the consummation of his career. In general the dedication was due to some important event in the life of the cLedicator or his family. Unfortunately details are rarely mentioned. Neither the occasion of the vow, nor the object prayed for, nor the nature of the vow are, as a rule, stated. In one case (no. 204) five slaves or foster- children in a Roman family dedicate an altar (0v,uE)X-q) in common on the occasion of cutting their hair when they attained manhood, but this record is exceptionally complete. It may, however, be taken as typical of the sort of events which commonly formed the occasion : some incident in the family life was connected with the prayer and the dedication. Men was the guardian and patron and helper of all his people alike in sickness and in health, and in every vicissitude of the family. The special Men, to whom these dedications were made, was the god of the city and the citizens, first of the Hellenic polis and later of the Roman colonia; but he was in origin the old Phrygo- Pisidian god Mannes, probably ancient Anatolian or Hittite. The lack of details in the dedications is due probably to two causes. (i) The brittle limestone in the wall on which the majority of the dedications are engraved was hard to cut, and the inscriptions were therefore made very short. It is in the dedications on marble, found mostly inside the sanctuary, that details are more freely given. (2) As a rule the worshipper stands here face to face with the god in making his dedicatioii. The god sees him and knows him. He merely indicates himself without describing himself, and trusts to the god.</page><page sequence="24">128 STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. Accordingly it seems safe to infer that when any description of the situation of the dedicator is given it relates to his prayer and is a statement of the reason for his prayer. No words were wasted in dealing with the god; the dedicator either left himself entirely in the hands of the god, or stated only some slight indication of the situation in which he was. placed and on account of which he hadc recourse to the help of the god. Considering the circumstances of ancient society it is probable that in many cases the reason why a worshipper appeared at the sanctuary and recorded a dedication was connected with health. The analogy of inscriptions inAsia Minor generallyshows that salvation(oConrpta) was what people ordinarily were praying for.1 They understood salvation largely in a material or physical sense: they desired good health, prosperity, and so on; though there are not wanting some indications that to some of them salvation had a wider connotation and included some idea of a moral kind. The probability that physical health was a frequent object in the pilgrimage of citizens to the shrine, and the prayers and vows that they made, is indicated by the fact that one enterprising physician named Hygeinos per- ceived in this custom a good opportunity for advertisement; and he inscribed on the outer wall a vow of the usual kind for himself and his household. This dedication stands out conspicuous by the size of the letters so that the eye of every one who passes is attracted to it. The very situation in which it is placed suggests that the aim of the dedicator was to be conspicuous at the proper moment. It is on the right side of one of the projecting buttresses, which support the south-west wall, and help to withstand the downward thrust on the slope, so that it faces worshippers as they are returning from the sanctuary. They have made their prayer to the god, and as they are returning home the advertisement of Hygeinos strikes them, as it were, in the face; but they cannot see it as they go from the city towards the sanctuary gate. From the writing in some cases it might be thought that the dedications are of the natare of graffiti engraved by chance visitors to the sanctuary along the wayside or on the outer walls, but study of their character shows that they were not the product of chance: they were engraved by persons of religious or superstitious character who visited the sanctuary for some definite purpose, viz. to discharge (according to the language of the inscriptions) their vow. The inscriptions are generally expressed in the ordinary form as the payment of a vow: the dedicant had prayed for something and. besought the god to grant the vow, and when his prayer was granted. he paid and recorded the payment. One exceptional case is sig- nificant. In- no. 237 a dedicant calls his offering a thank-offering, 1 See on this the Teacbing of Paul in terms of the present day, pp. IO, I22, 285.</page><page sequence="25">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. I 29 and says that it is made in accordance with a dream. He had not prayed and vowed, but some success or good-fortune happened to him; and in a dream he was warned to thank the god, and probably his thank-offering included a tithe of the. gain1 which had been granted to him if the good-fortune was in the nature of a monetary success. Compare 230, and perhaps 218. On this analogy several other dedications may be explained in wvhich there is no mention of any vow. There had been no prayer and vow; but after the event occurred, the dedicant acknowledged the intervention and the power of the god. ?7. The Makers of the Dedications: the, Deisidaimones.-The inscriptions which remain in or outside of the central sanctuary or in the church2 represent fairly the total number of dedications. There was little temptation to carry away to the modern town of Yalowadj for building purposes any stones of the wall; they are not fine material, and also their size made them awkward to transport over the intervening miles of steep, difficult, rough mountain side. 3 As to the numerous marble stelai inside this sanctuary, while the material was good, yet the size and shape was often not tempting for building purposes. Moreover, the ruins of Antioch were quite close to Yalowadj and at most only 250-300 ft. above the level of the modern town. Here there was abundant material to serve as a quarry from which building stone of excellent character could be extracted and transported at a small cost and with little trouble. It may fairly be supposed that the more religious or superstitious part of the city population, the 8Eco-c8a4tovE', constituted the class in the community which made the dedications to the god. In many cases the same individual or the same family made several dedicationis. These probably were not placed there at the same time; they ie- present different episodes in the life of the dedicators. The religious frame of mind, and the tendency to visit the sanctuary and make vows, worked itself into action on several occasions. Such deisi- daimones made vows and prayers repeatedly to the god for certain objects of their desire, and returned to the sanctuary to make dedications. It was their habit and character to beseech the god for certain advantages, and to record the fulfilment of the vow which accompanied the prayer. To the ancient mind the prayer was of the nature of a bargain. The supplicant asked for something and promised a certain payment if the prayer should be granted. When the prayer was granted he was thereby bound, so to say condemined, 1 The Roman custom of dedicating a tenth of their gains to Hercules probably springs from an old Aegean and West-Asian custom. 2 The church was built mainly of stones from the sanctuary. So perhaps was the monastery, which has not been excavated. 3 Many stelai were destroyed, as the small fragments prove. Some may yet be restored. A certain number of dedications may be found in the monastery and elsewhere. Still those already found adequately represent the probable character of the whole series.</page><page sequence="26">I30 STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. to pay to the god the price as promised. He was damnatus voti, and to neglect the payment of the vow was an act involving severe punishment from the god who was defrauded. While a single dedication rarely gives any indication of the reason and object that lay behind the prayer, yet when the same person more than once makes a dedication a comparison between them suggests more readily the sequence of the family life e.g. take nos. 76 and 78. In them the same person, Gamos, appears as the head of the family. In one case Gamos with his wife and two children pays a vow; in another case Gamos with three children records his vow. It is natural to understand that the omission of the wife in the second case is significant. She had died in the interval and a new child appears. The conjecture is so natural as to be convincing that the occasion of these dedications lay in the family life. The wife of Gamos died, but a third child was born to the family. In the Commentary this is connected with the statistics of family life in the Roman world, collected by the late Dr. W. R. Macdonell.1 The attempt must be made in each individual case to specify any indications that occur with regard to the occasion when the dedication was made. It would not be safe to assume that because dedicants must be ranked in general to the superstitious or deisidaimones that therefore they are of the lowest class in society. It is true that there are a number of freedmen and slaves who make dedications, but on the other hand there are also persons who are distinctly of the highest order in the state. There are priests, a duumvir, and perhaps a provincial governor. It must be remembered that the word ' super- stitious ' is not a correct rendering of the Greek adjective, for it introduces modern elements into the idea which it tries to represent. Any person was called deisidaimon who seemed to a philosophically minded man to be more inclined to recognise divine action than a philosopher should be. As used by the ancient Greeks it is rather a term of comparison, and it may be, and occasionally is, employed in a honorific sense, although the depreciatory intention is distinctly more common than the complimrentaryr intention. In conclusion it may be pointed out that the Deisidaimones who were most likely to frequent the sanctuary were also those who were most likely to be attracted to any new religion. They were of a religious cast of mind, and they were on the outlook for revelations or indications of the will and power of the gods. It is highly probable that persons of this class would turn towards the Jewish religion, and would be numbered by Juvenal among the metuentes sabbata. i Biometrika, I913, pp. 366-386: he proves that the expectation of life for young women was less, for elderly women greater, than for men. The reason is obvious. See Bearing of Research on N.T. p. -8o.</page><page sequence="27">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. 13 I They would tend to be attracted in manv cases to the austere and lofty religion of 'the Hebrews; they would enter into the outer circle of ' them that feared God' (or ' the devout') ; and many of this class would be likely to appear among the Gentile congregation that crowded the synagogue when Paul first spoke there, and- to whom after a little experience he turned: cp. Acts xiii, 46-48. In regard to the standing cf the dedicants a distinction may probably be made between the inscriptions on the outer wall and the dedications usually on marble stelai inside the sanctuary. The latter were, of course, more expensive, and restricted to a richer class of the community. In later time marble tablets were often inserted in the outer wall, regardless of older dedications. Mrs. Hasluck's opinion that most of the dedications originate from a rather humble class of the population is probably true of the earlier inscriptions on the outer wall of the sanctuary. In the early centuries A.D. it was on the whole the class of freedmen and the humbler citizens that practised most the native custom of dedi- cations. On the other hand we can say that in the later time, especially during the alliance between the imperial policy and the native worship-an alliance which was close andc strong at Antioch -citizens of very high standing' inscribed their name on the outer wall, because it was an old and sacred custom. There was then a fashion of resuscitating the ancient cults and customs in the struggle against the new religion. At this time the epithet ' hereditary' (a C7p0o) was commonly applied to the god. He had been of course) always the old god of the district from time immemorial, but it became now cust6mary to lay emphaiss on his antiquity: precisely because the cult was ancient, it suited the feeling of the time. Standing' and rank in the city, however, was an accident, and not' essential to this- investigation of the causes which produced these dedications. The fact was religious, and the reasons for it were religious, and not social. Conclusive proof of this last statement lies in the practice that obtains in the later third and the early fourth century. In this time the worship of Men seems to have revived and to have been cele- brated with enlarged and more magnificent ritual as a device of imperial policy,' and the custom of making dedications to Men was practised much more freely by citizens of more distinguished family and even of the higher education. Philosophy allied itself with and tried to impart' a new interpretation to the ancient worship in the Eastern provinces, and at this period the dedications on the wall and in the sanctuary can rarely be attributed 'to mere slaves or humbler families, while quite frequently they are evidently the proof of the piety of the nobler and more distingaished citizens of the State.

The Religious Facts and Principles revealed in the Dedications. -The ded cations give very little information of a strictly religious character, but leave this aspect to be understood as self-evident. The situation as between the god and the dedicator was clear, and there was no need to explain what was in the mind of every wor- shipper at the shrine. 1 Still, in order to complete these introductory remarks before studying the inscriptions themselves, an attempt must be made to elucidate the religious facts involved. One in- scription, even taken alone by itself, throws much light on the religious situation; and it is expressed in abbreviation. It is remarkable that this should be the case, and that one single dedication should be put in this cryptic form. Only after completing the entire religious study which follows did the reason occur to me; yet I mention it first of all, though it was the last step in the discovery of the underlying religious facts. The reason why a cryptic form was given to one inscription lay in the fact that it alone touches on the relation to the Mysteries. There still was felt at the time when this dedication was made that reluctance to speak openly about anything connected with the mystic ritual which e.g. appears in the pages of Pausanias, when any topic of this kind comes up. This dedication requires and rewards very careful study. It was found in a heap of stones which were lying in front of the large gateway with its broad flight of steps in the south-west wall of the sanctuary. It must have fallen from a point in the wall close to or actually on one or the other side of the entrance. This prominent position probably implies a special character, and both the language and the name of the dedicator suggest that he was a member of the priestly family and probably himself a priest. The words show clearly that there was some relation between the mystic ceremonial and the dedication, perhaps generally, perhaps only in this special case. Just as in no. 237 the dedication is made in accordance with a revelation conveyed in a dream, so here the dedication is made ' in accordance with the mystic initiation.'2 The name of the dedicator cannot be restored with certainty, but in all probability it is connected with the word Ionia or Ionian. In 7.H.S. I9I8, pp. I3I, I46, I49, I69, i8i, it is pointed out that a number of personal names used in the great Anatolian families were grecised through some analogy with Greek mytho- logical heroes. One of these old priestly and dynastic names was the Anatolian form of Yavan. The Sons of Yavan were the Old- Ionians, who became known to the West Asiatic tribes and races 1 It is different in the case of ' Confessions.' Their purpose was to serve as 'exemplaria ' and warnings of the god's power and man's duty.

Various Greek personal names, most of which are probably or certainly hieratic, appearing in the inscriptions are connected with Yavan or some derivative of that name. The feminine name Ia, the name Jason, and so on, are examples. Among these may be reckoned the name of the dedi- cator in the inscription now before us. This name is in itself uncertain. It begins Ion, but whether this is complete or not remains uncertain. Probably it is an abbreviation like all the other words in this in- scription. Possibly it may have been the priestess Ionia, or lone, or [onis who made the dedication along with her children, but more probably the dedicator was the priest Jonios, Yavan himself grecised: it is even conceivable that this name was expressed without abbrevia- tion as Ion, literally corresponding to the old Yavan.1 io6.

This outstanding and exceptional inscription must be given here prominently, though it is numbered io6 in the topographical order according to which publication is made in the following pages, It is attributed to the period of the pagan revival, which was strongest between A.D. 250 and 3I5, but which began in the Antonine period, and was already influential and fashionable in a form not definitely and avowedly anti-christian, but rather aiming at an alliance and synthesis between paganism and christianity, under Julia Domna and Alexander Severus.

Delegates came from many foreign cities and countries to the oracle at Klaros, often accompanied by a chorus which sang a hymn in honour of the god. The delegations came to seek an oracle; they were ' questioners of the god' (theo- propoi); and, when they returned home, the oracle was recorded in a public dedication.2 At Klaros, also, inscriptions3 recorded the names of the delegates and the chorus of hymn-singers (hymnodoi, 1 It may be taken for granted that o and co were interchangeable in late dedications.

In several cases the delegate or delegates are stated to have received initiation in the Mysteries ; and these are the cases which interest us at present. The terms in which the initiation of the delegates is recorded vary. Sometimes the delegate ' joined also in the mystic ritual' (in addition to consulting the god). From such a bare record we learn nothing regarding the rites. Two cases, however, are more in- structive. In one it is stated that two inquirers, ' having been initiated, set foot' on - -' (/tv 60 Ercr EvE/3ctrEv-cav). The other case is specially instructive: an inquirer ' having received the mysteria set foot on - '(rTapaXa/3&amp;wv ra&amp; Ivur jptcLa evEP/aEvocEv). The general term, which is used in the one case, ' being 'initiated', is defined in the second case more particularly as ' receiving the mystic things ' (i.e. from the hierophant, the officiating priest). The correlative term, TapE'3&amp;KE rTa pvo-r49pwa, ' he (the hierophant) handed over the mystic things', is also technical in the language of the Mysteries. The two phrases both indicate the initiation ritual as a whole (as M. Ch. Lecrivain points out): both phrases include the showing of the mystic objects (8EtKvv'pEva), the performance of the mystic acts (8p&amp;4kEva), and the utterance of the mystic words (XEyo0'pEa). Accordingly, the term 'tradition ', or ' re- ception, of the mysteria ' denotes the entire mystic ceremony, all that is given by the priest or received by the initiated, words, enlightenment, etc. One typical act is by Synecdoche used for the entire series of ritual act&lt;. So, likewise, the verb ' set foot on --' (44ih,8arElctv) was used at Klaros to indicate one act as representative of the whole ritual, It does not concern us at this point to discuss the meaning; it suffices to have established the fact that a term denoting some- one part or act of the ceremonial may be used to denote the entire Anatolian mystic ritual. 1 One remarkable inference may be drawn from the recorded facts. The mystic ceremonial was performed at Klaros (and presumably in Anatolia generally), not annually (or biennially), on one great regu- larly recurring occasion (as became usual in Greece proper), but frequently from time to time as religious needs required.2 There is evidence that even at Athens the marriage ceremony involved the performance of at least some part of the mystic ritual. Putting together the various separate details mentioned at Klaros, and interpreting them to suit the Initiation Hall at Antioch, the full record is-' receiving the sacred objects (including at Antioch the " crescent" ? as a principal part), he set foot on the divine I Treated in the writer's article in the Annual B.S.A. 19I2, p. 46.

This inter- pretation assumes the truth of that theory of the Anatolian ('Phrvgian') Mysteries which is stated in the Annual, I9I2, Lc. cit. Two steps, not one, in the ritual are here specified. The reception (7rapacX-pts) was followed by the entrance into the divine presence over the mystic threshold. 1 These two successive stages are a summary of the entire ceremonial (in which there were manyr other actions). Accordingly it may be taken as certain that the Telete or initiation which is mentioned in the present inscription led up to the vow and the dedication. In many dedicatory record of vows found elsewhere the order of the good (Kar&amp; EITL c ayYV NODV), or the dream con- veying the instractions of the god (Kaa&amp;a o'vap), is mentioned as the occasion which led to the religious act and the dedication. 2 ?9. Introduction cr Emphasising of the Acti0n called TEK0OpEVELV.- At Antioch during the third century a certain act in the mystic ritual was emphasised (or perhaps a new act was introduced) in the dedications to the god Men. This was called 'Tekmoreusis', if we may coin a word for the sake of brevity: this noun does not occur, but only the verb in the first aorist participle TEKUWpEv'oas (or plural), also the noun TEK/Op simply3 either with verb omitted, or once with the verb TotEiV. The word does not occur anywhere except at Antioch and in the country to the north and west, which was not part of the territory of the city, but was connected with it in imperial administration and was also devoted to a cult of the same origin and character.4 In that region the word became common, indicating that the rite denoted by it assumed importance in Antiochian religious society. This implies that, for some reason and in some unknown way, one particular act or part of the mysteries, as performed in the Antiochian country generally, was selected as typical of the whole, and the entire ceremonial was described by the word which indicated strictly this part. The evidence is practi- cally conclusive that this development or change or addition was made somewhere about the middle of the third century. The word occurs frequently at the hieron over Antioch, and 1 And through the mystic entrance way, shown in the photographs, Annual, plate i, I and 4. 2 Examples need not be quoted: Ka7-&amp; 6eap below in no. 237. 3 T7KLOp is a false form instead of rKApCOP. It cannot be taken as an abbreviation of eiKAOpe6rCYaT as it is once used with srot(4)Tag. Moreover, there is no reasonable justification for abbreviating the word. The use of o for co is common in the late Phrygian inscriptions. The omission of a verb is common in dedicatory inscriptions ; and in fact with ev 'x^ the omission is almost invariable. This archaic and poetic word was re-vitalised by readers of epic poetry at school, and after some tentatives a verb reK/JOjses)w was coined. On the meaning of 7roteFv used with Tekmor see below on p. I s8 4The religion on these estates took the form of a cultus of Artemis and Men. Strabo, p. 557, mentions only the hieroi of Men in the region of (subject to) the Antiochian State. In the local inscriptions of the TekmDreian Guest-friends Artemis takes first place, and M&amp;n is not men- tioned under that name, but as Zeus Euruda- menos, or Ourudamenos, or the more strictly Pisidian form Mannes or Manes Ourammoes (Orumaios). See J.H.S. i91i, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="32">1I36 STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. rarely in the inscriptions of the rustic district north and -west of the city territory. I could hardly trust my eyes in I905, when I read the first solitary example of TEK1LOPEv'oacS on a Tekmoreian list (for the writing was so bad that I feared an error). In i886 Sterrett had found the ,oi rEVOEKpTOKpOL, and had interpreted this as a geo- graphical name, being followed in this by Judeich and Ziebarth,l who pointedly dissented from the religious interpretation which I had maintained and published H.G.A.M. p. 410 in a tentative form (emphasised in Studies in Eastern Roman Provinces, p. 3I8). The occurrence of the verb was the conclusive proof that the Tekmoreioi were not a racial, but a religious group. Then from I9II onwards we found the verb in numerous inscriptions, both at Antioch and rarely on the estates with which the Tekmoreioi were connected. 2 This territory to the north and west of Antioch was a vast imperial estate or series of estates. The population of culti- vators, was, as in many other cases, organised in the form of a religious association. The magistrates were also officials in the service of the god and goddess. The imperial procurator in charge of the estates was ex officio the chief priest of the ritual, which implies that the worship of the emperor was closely associated with the native ritual, and that the emperor was regarded by the population of the estates as the impersonation in human form on the earth of their own supreme deity. The old constitation of the people on the estates which had once belonged to the god continued in the form that the god-emperor is the supreme lord of all. This lord rules tbrough his priests and prophets, and the transition or connexion between the emperor at Rome and the native priesthood is arranged through the custom that the procurator for the time being is the supreme priest who manages the conveyance of the divine imperial orders to the subject population. The oldest document does not mention any title or name of the association of cultivators (coloni) on the estates. It was copied by me in I886, and sent to Sterrett for publication in W.E. no. 382: also in Studies in the Eastern Roman Provinces, p. 332, no. 9, it was republished and improved in 7.H.S. I9I2, p. i58. Towards the- middle of the third century, however, a name of the Association emerges, which is obviously connected with the ceremony of Tekmoreusis: the association is called the Tekmoreian Guest- Friends. The period is assured definitely (i) by the occurrence of a date, viz. the consuls of the year 237 A.D. in one of the earlier documents3; and (2) by the chronological relation of the whole set of documents bearing on the history of this association. The selection of the name ' Guest-Friends ' is remarkable : it implies See note on p. 138. 2 Subsequent literature: Ramsay, Y.H.S. I912, pp. 151-170: Annual B.S.A. I9II-2, p. 63: M. M. Hardie (Mrs. Hasluck, loc. cit., p. 123). 3 See Annual, p. 63, but the name Tekmoreian does not occur. It may be restored in the mutilated beginning.</page><page sequence="33">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. I37 the idea of inter-relation between different districts or countries. The inhabitants travelling from other quarters founi as guest-friends a welcome at this Tekmoreian centre through the common perform- ance of a certain ritual, part of which was connected with a Tekmor. A verb TEK1OpEvEtV was invented (also a word vTpwTaVaKXrq1;)1; and the name of the association on the estates, Tekmoreioi, is con- nected with it. The whole system is purely artificial and pseudo- Greek. The use of such words is characteristic of a quite late period, when old epic terms like -TEKfkwp and 8ao3 were re-introduced owing to the customary system of education, in which great stress was laid on the reading of Homer and other ancient poets. Connected with this invented word is the evident inter-relation between persons in different districts or countries, which is implied in the idea conveyed by the word and in the variety of origin of the Xenoi. 2 Something after the nature of Freemasonry is implied, and it is certain that this inter-relation must have a religious character and that it must have been opposed to Christianity. The Christians had already their own system of interrelation; and the very life of the church consisted in constant communication between its scattered parts (as Avircius Marcellus in the end of the second century stated in his epitaph); they recognised one another everywhere through their common ritual; they always met friends wherever they went, and joined in the Eucharist. In this con- stant inter-communication lay the basis- of Christian unity; they all held together, because they were always helping one another and showing hospitality to one another in the process of mutual visiting and intercourse. There was, of course, notbing to be gained in any way for the Christians by forming a new bond of unity; in forming a new bond, they would have disowned the basis and holiest symbolism of their faitb ; the Eucharist persisted with slight change from the life of the Founder onwards. The Tekmoreian association on the same analogy is likely to have merely emphasised some single act in the Phrygian ritual and not to have invented the act; and at that period such emphasis was necessarily anti-Christian, arising out of the union of Imperial policy with paganism. The performance of this act was a sign of common purpose and of unity. Xenoi were recognised and received because of it. No Christian could perform the act, except by disowning his faith. It was therefore a test of loyalty to the empire in the religious conflict. Such an act was, as is evident and necessary, a part or stage in the mystic ritual, which was the highest religious ritual achieve- ment of the later paganism (see A-nnual, p. 52 f.). Among the many ways in which the final struggle, A.D. 250-3I5, I On this remarkable title,' he who reclines first at the Table,' see Annual loc. cit. p. 153. 2 See the growing list of homes (Sterrett, W.E. p. 271), complete to i905, Stud. in E.

This process was carried to its completest extent under Maximin, but it can be traced from the time of Decius onwards. The hypothesis was suggested in Studies in the Eastern Roman Provinces, p. 3I8, that the institution of the Tekmor was connected with the great religious struggle and the combination between the adherents of the old paganism in different regions. They knew one another by the Tekmor or secret sign. Already in H.G.A.M. p. 4IO ff, it was suggested that the secret sign (Tekmor), ' a poetic term not unnatural in the artificial Phrygian Greek' of the late third century, was the origin of the adjective (anrd the verb), and that some association or brotherhood (such as was common in all periods of Anatolian society, see C.B.Phr. I, p. 97, ii, p. 359) was called the ' Tekmorian guest-friends'; but the intimate relation to the great war of the religions; and the fact that the guest-friends were the population of colo'ni on the imperial- sacred estates, were not there observed.' The cultus as practised on the imperial estates is instructive in respect of the original form of Men-worship at Antioch. It has been shown in the article above mentioned (Annual, I9I2, p. 38), that, when the cult was changed by the institution of a second centre close to the new Helleno-Seleucia garrison city and colony Antioch, the religion of the latter developed in accordance with municipal and political sentiment, becoming more devoted to public and municipal ostentation, and laying more stress on the male element in the divine pair, while the goddess made little show in public ritual, although in private, and especially in the Mysteries, the old fashion persisted with little alteration, whereas on the estates the cultus was more conservative and continued to lay emphasis on the goddess. The noun Tekmor seems to be used earlier than the verb TEK/JLOpEVELV; at any rate it is used as a noun with a ritual verb in one dedication, where the expression occurs TEKVOP oto-a3 (no. 205), and clearly TOLEZV must here be understood in its ritualistic sense. It refers to religious performance, and the whole phrase means 'offering' to the god the Tekmor.2 In one other case at least, no. 12, perhaps also in no. I25, the noun Tekmor seems to stand alone; and there we may understand that the verb 'offering' is omitted according to a frequent and recognised usage of language, especially in hieratic formulae. Finally the verb TEKLOpEV'EtV was in-ented. 1 Sterrett in a Prelimn. Report, followed byZiebarth, Gr. Fereinwesen, p. 67. and Judeich, Alt. von Hierapolis, p. Izo, regarded Tekmoreioi as a topo- graphical term. Later Sterrett, W.E. p. 432. 1men- tioned my interpretation, apparently preferring it. Pagan Revival in Pauline and otber Studies, p. 103 ff. 2Lep&amp; 7roLe?v, or p'4etv, is perhaps a sufficient defence, for the Tekmor was a sacred object. Compare also Ouv-f ap 7rote?v. This sacrificial or ritual use of 7roLelv became commoner in the later period, and particularly among the Christians.</page><page sequence="35">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. I39 The ceremony called Tekmoreusis was therefore an ordinary part of the mystic ritual performed by every initiated person. It was not in its origin a mere test of a Christian, but it was a complete proof of paganism. This is the position that I have always taken up on this subject. In the Studies in the Eastern' Provinces, p. 347, where this theory was first advanced, the words are used 'We may confidently say that the action called TEKILOpEVEwV was made a part of the mystic ritual on the estates which had formerly belonged to the god and now belonged to the emperor; but the god and the emperor were one'. This action of Tekmoreusis incorporated in the mystic ritual ' certainly must have had some relation to the conjoint deity the emperor'. In other words the Tekmor was a most solemn sign and pledge of the loyalty of the celebrant to the emperor and his service, the emperor being identified on the estates with the hereditary and ancient god, the hearer of prayer. The initiated person in pledging himself to the god was also pledging himself to the emperor who is the god present on earth. Such was the spirit of the alliance made between the imperial policy and the paganism, which it hoped to revive in the interest of the war against the common enemy, Christianity. It may, of course, be taken for granted that the use of the Tekmor was part of a certain ritual. It was suitable as a test and proof of adherence to the old faith, because it was an impressive act in the ritual of paganism. There can be no doubt that this local ritual was a development of the mystic celebration, and was closely con- nected with the old Mysteries, which had existed from a remote period. The mystic celebration varied in different countries, but yet had features of strong similarity everywhere, and in the gradual development during the later Roman period the general similarity was increased by the adoption in one district of features from other countries, not in the way of substitution for previous ritual, but in the way of addition to it. In each place the old remained and the new was grafted on, and thus was produced community or even identity of character everywhere. There is no reason to think that the Tekmoreusis was devised as a special test to be applied in the case of Christians. It would be as rational to say that the celebration of the Eucharist was devised by the Christians as a test of anti- paganism. The Tekmoreusis was a pagan ceremony performed by the Mystai, and the performance of it was in itself a test of religion, because no Christian could perform it except in the process of a public recantation. The very fact that a Christian was in circum- stances where the Tekmoreusis could be performed showed that he was abjuring his faith and taking part in the most characteristic ritual of paganism. 1 b7KOO0, a common epithet of the supreme Anatolian god or goddess.</page><page sequence="36">140 STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. It is -implied in this account of -the Tekmor that the term and all inscriptions which use the term belong to the period later than A.D. 250. The Tekmor is instinct with the spirit of that long final struggle between the two rival faiths. When the inscriptions in which the verb or the adjective occur are studied individually with regard to date and period, it is found that a few of them contain no certain indication of their age, being dedications on the outer wall of the sanctuary, where the character of the stone imposed a certain similarity of script and a general type, quite consistent with almost any date in the first three centuries A.D. ; yet even among them features sometimes occur which are markedly late; In no case of Tekmoreusis is there any sign of early date, whereas in many cases there are signs of late period, as is shown by the use of a somewhat more elaborate phraseology than is customary in. earlier dedications, or by the employment of epithets of the god which are wanting in the dedications that are certainly early. In short, fully half are certainly later than about A.D. 250 and the rest are not marked with any definite sign of date. From these facts, therefore, the conclusion seems certain that -the entire body of in- scriptions alluding to the Tekmor must be grouped together as late, and studied in relation to one another. ?io. The Tekmor: what was it ?-A speculation may be permitted in conclusion as to the Tekmor itself. In studying these dedications as a whole one is struck with the fact that the crescent in a large majority of cases bears some relation to the dedicant or dedicants. Where there is one dedicant there is one crescent; where there are more dedicants than one the number corresponds. To this rule it is true that many exceptions occur: these can often be explained readily (as will be found in the commentary) ; but still there remain some cases which elude our insufficient knowledge, and can be ex- plained only by vague conjecture: e.g. it may be supposed that the dedicant purchased in a mason's shop a tablet which did not exactly suit his purpose. It has long ago been pointed out, and the evidence is complete, that an analogous class of cases is found in sepulchral epitaphs. The number of figures represented in relief on a tomb- stone does not always correspond to the number of persons indicated in the epitaph. -S. Reinach remarked many years ago on this dis- crepancy as an unexplained feature in the ancient sepulchral reliefs; but his bibliography is so vast that the precise book and page escapes the present writer's search.1 I have pointed out in a review of Reinach's book in the Classical Review that this was to be explained by the natural supposition that there was in the stock of the stone- cutter a certain series of types ready for sale; there were stones 1 I think it was his re-publication of Lebas's Monuments Figures.</page><page sequence="37">SIUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. I4I with one figure, stones with two; stones suitable to a small family, husband and wife and children; but the number of types was narrowly circumscribed, and the shop might at any time be wanting even in a specimen of the commonest type. The purchasers of tombstones could not always find a stone exactly suited to their purpose; but they evidently were not very particular, and when they could not find one exactly suitable they took whatever could be got at the moment. Possibly, according to the custom of the market, the shop- keeper would offer an unsuitable stone at a cheaper price in order to bring about a sale. This explanation would perhaps suit the marbles dedicated in the sanctuary, but it would not suit the dedications inscribed on the outer wall. It is, however, on the outer wall that we find the clearest cases of correspondence between the actual number of the dedicants and the number of crescents, and in some monuments even the size of the crescent seems to vary according to the age or importance of the different members of the family; a row of crescents diminishing in size suggest the idea of a sort of procession of the family -ith the father at the head and the youngest and smallest child at the other end, such as is found in various ancient reliefs and in the famous Holbein at. Dresden. Already in I9I2 Anderson, surveying the wall with the numberless crescents which form by far the most conspicuous element in the great series of dedications, remarked that the crescent must be the Tekmor. At the time this suggestion did not appeal to me, as my mind was possessed with another idea; and the suggestion escaped my recol- lection completely. In writing the present study I was gradually brought to the same idea, unconscious that I was plagiarising. It was only after the preceding and following paragraphs were actually printed that I found out that I was merely confirming Anderson's suggestion, which I now distinctly remember. The Tekmor then was most probably the crescent-shaped object which is represented on practically every dedication. This crescent- shaped object is usually represented inside a pointed Naiskos, as we may interpret the reliefs. The action which was called' Tekmoreusis was the offering (sci . 7rotJLv), or holding up of the crescent-shaped Tekmor before the god. This obviouslytook place when the Mystes passed through the entrance way between the sacred stones which still stand in the Initiation Hall, and entered into the presence of the god ( q3arEv'Etv).1 In other localities no allusion occurs to this crescent-shaped object in the celebration of the Mysteries; but there is no doubt that there were certain local differences in the conception of the divine nature corresponding to the different character of the population in various localities, and this crescent- shaped Tekmor played a part in the worship of Men far greater than 1 See Annual, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="38">I42 STUDIES IN TIIE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. in any other known Anatolian ritual. All the peculiarities of the Antiochian ritual seemed to be connected with this Tekmor, and the special fashion of the ritual is fully explained by the theory which has just been advanced. This cresce-nt-shaped object is ordinarily taken as a symbol of the crescent moon. The subject is discussed by Mrs. Hasluck in ,7.H.S. I912, I, and I have nothing certain to add to her remarks. It is far from certain that the crescent, which seems to stand out on the shoulders of the god in reliefs representing him, really meant originally the crescent moon. Mrs. Hasluck points out that there are cases at the hieron in which the ' crescentt' is unmistakably shown as the horns of a bull's head; and there are also many cases in which there is a mere crescent with no trace of the bull's head. In this latter class of cases sometimes the two ends are more like horns, and sometimes the appearance is more of a crescent without any re- semblance to a pair of horns. The types then are (I) horned bull's head; (2) horns with vanishing head; (3) horns without head; (4) crescent having no resemblance to horns. 1 But whether the bull's head preceded the crescent in the order of development or vice versa, there is nothing to determine; and these new monuments contribute little further knowledge. They only make more evident how confused were the ideas of that period regarding the emblems of the god, a confusion already well known to us from coins and other monuments; cf. especially the relief published by Sir Cecil Smith in the Bull. Corr. Hell. I899, pl. i. (5) There have also be'en found since Mrs. Hasluck wrote two or three cases in which there are distinct and unmistakable knobs at the extremities of the horns or the ends of the crescent. These do not suit either a crescent-moon or the horns on a bull's head; and conjecture is both permissible and necessary. Mr. Hill suggests that this symbol is a torc. It seemed to me to resemble rather a horseshoe of the modern type as used in this country, the knobs at the ends representing the down-turned ends. These are mere conjectures; but (6) another case seems to be clearer. There. is a fair number of cases, especially on the wall, in which the symbol is distinctly not a crescent moon, but is elongated and resembles markedly the style of horseshoe which is found at least once in Scotland in the excavations at Traprain. Only half the horseshoe remains, but if I am right in restoring the second half (which is slightly smaller) from the part preserved and so obtaining a complete crescent, the resulting form lends itself to be repeated either in the shape of (5) or (6). Another half horseshoe has been found at Traprain which is of different character2: the ends do not 1 No. (3) is practically identical identical with no. (4)- 2 'Ilhese horseshoes are described in the Pro- eedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 1914-I51 p. i98, with figure 45, 9, and i9i5-i6, p. izi: see also Pitt Rivers, Excavations in Cran- borne Cbase, iv, plate z58, fig. 24.</page><page sequence="39">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. 143 taper to points, but are broad like the modern horseshoe, and in this case four holes in the preserved half are intended for the nails, by which the shoe was fastened to the hoof. While the shape of the horseshoe in the second case at Traprain is different from that in the first, they both lend themselves to our hypothetical explanation of many forms on the Antiochian dedications. In the earlier Roman period the horseshoe seems to have been different in shape and was tied on; but the Scottish examples are oval and quite unlike the crescent moon. The modern Turkish horseshoe is a nearly complete circular metal plate covering the whole of the horse's hoof with only a small round hole in the centre; but there was certainly in use in Roman Scotland, and probably in Asia Minor, during the third and fourth centuries (if not earlier), a type of horseshoe, or perhaps two types of horseshoe, approximating much more closely to the modern European form. The older type of Roman horseshoe probably originated in Gaul. The question may be asked whether this nearly complete oval shoe employed in the later time originated in Asia Minor and West Africa, and whether it was carried by auxiliary cavalry to the West. There are other traces known of the direct influence of Asiatic customs on northern Britain. Considering the wide variety of shapes of the objects represented in the dedications it is probable that they are not all indications of the same article. The word crescent may be used roughly in the following list to describe the whole class of objects, omitting the circular discs which often occur in the pediments; but, whether or not any of thes'e objects represent the crescent moon, it seems quite certain that many of them do not. It is possible that (5) may be intended as a picture of the shoes used on oxen, though I know no proof that oxen were shod in ancient Asia Minor, as they are at the present' day in Southern Europe. The confusion of symbols and ideas is characteristic of the mixture of religious and religions ideas in the period to which the majority of the dedications belong, viz. the third and the early fourth centuries. The conjecture is permissible, and almost obligatory, that in all these symbols the underlying idea is simply good fortune. The object indic'ated, whether horseshoe or torc or something else, is added to the dedication as being lucky. It represents some form of popular superstition, with some special bearing on productivity and fertility. The prayers of many dedicators included as the whole or part of their desire the birth of children; and anything approxi- mately rounded was taken as symbolic of birth. A circular symbol with an entrance meant good fortune. The horseshoe or the oxshoe was made of iron, and it is not impossible that the numerous pieces of haematite iron scattered over the surface of the sacred peak may have some connexion with this. The use of iron was of course a comparatively late discovery; but,</page><page sequence="40">I44 STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. when it was discovered, it had to be brought into relation with current religion or superstition; and thus arose hieratic legends and religious or superstitious rites showing the influence of the divine power, or of daemonic power, on the discovery and use of the new metal. It was once suggested by the writer that this symbol as it appears projecting behind the shoulders of the god Men is really a mistaken representation of the wings which frequently appear on the shoulders of the god in old Hittite monuments. Whether this hypothesis can ever be justified or proved is quite uncertain, but it remains still possible, and there is at least one case on a Phrygian relief of the Roman time in which the horns of the crescent stand so upright as to be evidently not intended to indicate the crescent moon. This uncertainty with regard to the meaning and exact form of the ' crescent ' may seem to constitute an argument that the crescent is not the Tekmor. One would expect that the Tekmor should be some sacred object of ancient character and well-defined form. This, however, is by no means certain. The religion of the time was mixed, fluctuating, full of varieties and uncertainties and new ideas only half reconciled with the old. On the wall of the sanctuary the Naiskoi are quite as conspicuous as the crescents. In the old Anatolian religious dedications accom- panied by symbolism (either incised or in relief), the Naiskos is common and specially characteristic of the ritual. It is pictured as the shelter of the deity, who sits under it: in fact, the Naiskos is the shrine of the divinity. At the Antiochian sanctuary this is not the case; there is no representation of the god Men or Mannes in human form under the shrine. Often, however, in Anatolia (e.g. on coins of Perga, etc.), there is not in the shrine any representation of the divinity in a form human or approximating to human. So it was at Antioch. In the older form of the religion, before Hellenic anthropomorphism triiumphed completely, the god, if represented at all to the eye, 1 was represented only by some symbol. This symbol at Antioch was what we speak of as the " crescent " (whatever was its real nature). In the later Roman period, when symbolism was varied and modified, the " crescent " ass'umed various shapes, but it is always considered to be the symbol of Good Fortune. The anthropomorphised repre- sentations of the god Men in the Roman period with its great number of connected symbols, such as the crescent horns on the shoulder, the pointed cap, the bull's head, Nike on a globe carrying a trophy in her left hand, which rests on a column, the sceptre in his right hand and the cDck standing beside him on the ground, shows how complex the divine idea was at Antioch. The artist attempted to bring together into one representation all the prominent 1 The empty divine throne is common: see The Thousand and One Churches, p. 505 ff.</page><page sequence="41">STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCE GALATIA. 145 features and characteristics of the divine power. Hs is not simply representing a moon-god, but the divinity in all its varied character. Personally I have never been inclined to the view that the god M&amp;en is the moon-god. He is associated with the goddess the moon, but he himself is not a male impersonation of the moon-god. The goddess Luna is mentioned in an Antiochian inscription, and as Anderson pointed out, 7.R.S. 1913, P. 272, Men is mentioned by Strabo as associated with the moon-goddess-. He is rather the sun- god keeping company with the moon, so far as he represents any astronomical idea ; but his nature is mach wider. He is the great power of the divine nature as affecting the life of man in all ways. His Anatolian name was Mannes, as is proved fully in 7.H.S. I9I8, PP. I48 ff. A fuller title is given in an inscription of Akmonia, which is dated A.D. 3II-2, and which belongs to the revival of paganism when ancient names and antique customs were re-introduced with an ideal sense attached to them and were used as a weapon against the hostile religion of Christianity. The god is there called Manes Daos Heliodromos Zeus. These various names are brought -together to sum up a complex divine nature. The god is the old Anatolian Manes, and he is the Hellenic supreme deity Zeus; he is the sun- god who runs his daily course through the heavens; and finally he is Dawos (perhaps a Pisilian god, wolf, Hesych, s.v. 8Uog). 1 1 Mdos has been taken as the analogue of Gdr.
