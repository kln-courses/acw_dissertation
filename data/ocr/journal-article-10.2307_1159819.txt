<plain_text><page sequence="1">Africa 57 (2), 1987 SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY: TRADITIONAL IRON SMELTING IN MALAWI Nikolaas J. van der Merwe and Donald H. Avery Iron smelting was still widespread in Africa at the beginning of the twentieth century and was recorded in a number of areas by missionaries, administrators, travellers and the like. A wide variety of technical pro- cedures and associated magic was observed in the process. The quality of these early accounts varies depending on the technical expertise of the observers and their interest in (or bias against) the ritual aspects. Reviews of the early literature, both technical and ritual, have been provided by Cline (1937) and others and no attempt in this direction will be made here. It will suffice to say that magic associated with smelting appears to be universal in sub-Saharan Africa, as are certain themes. These include the following: 1. For iron smelting to be successful, the smelters must be technically expert and a variety of supernatural forces must be propitiated. This propitiation takes the form of ceremonies and ritual and involves the application of special materials or medicines. The combination of ritual and medicines is referred to here as magic. 2. The iron smelters, especially the leaders, command the knowledge to carry out both the technical and magical components of smelting. This makes them more than ordinary craftsmen and gives them special status, usually high; alternatively they may be outcasts. 3. Sexual symbolism and taboos accompany smelting, often expressed through the exclusion of women from smelting in progress, compulsory celibacy for the smelters, or female anthropomorphic details added to smelting furnaces. Explanations for magic associated with smelting or other metallurgical procedures are as varied as their observers. These range from simple dismissals of superstition to elaborate functional explanations. An example of the latter is Bronowski's analysis of the Shinto ritual which accompanies the making of samurai swords. The chants and movements are explained as devices for recipe recall and timing (Bronowski, 1973: 171). When you have no written language, when you have nothing which can be called a chemical formula, then you must have a precise ceremonial which fixes the sequence of operations so that they are exact and memorable. The case in question involves forging, not smelting, but the same principle could well apply. As yet nobody has produced such a functional explana- tion for African smelting magic; nor has anyone suggested that the medicines have a chemical function. Dismissing smelting magic as unim- portant is more common. Thus Kjekshus (1977: 91) believes that the 'ritualist school of research into ... ironworking' has tended to see 'the manufacturing of iron as a by-product of the magico-religious needs of the East African peoples'.</page><page sequence="2">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY Kjekshus reviews iron production in Tanzania at the turn of the century, emphasising that people in the lakes region (e.g. the Fipa) were able to supply their own needs and also export iron, usually in the form of hoes. He rejects as misplaced emphasis the observation of Wyckaert (1914: 374) that Fipa smelters 'seem to attach greater importance to the supernatural influences than to their own work', Robert's (1949: 20) characterisation of the master smelter as a magician and Wise's (1958: 232) contention that, for smelting to be successful, 'the living and the dead, the spirits of the air, wood and rock must work together'. Instead, Kjekshus sides with those who describe smelting ritual as of secondary importance, at most 'a type of trade-union secrecy aimed at maintaining monopoly over an important economic enterprise' (Kjekshus, 1977: 91). He explains that the demise of the local iron smelting industry after its traumatic contact with colonial technology resulted in 'the decline of chemical/technical knowledge and the rise of the magical element as a substitute explanation of the metallurgical process'. If this is interpreted to mean that those not familiar with smelting technology are likely to emphasise the ritual aspects in their accounts of it, we would tend to agree. This is hardly an alternative explanation, however. The problem with this debate, in any case, is that the opposing explanations have been produced from two antagonistic European ideolo- gies. Neither side need be entirely right or wrong: they may simply be missing the point of an African ideology. It is appropriate, therefore, to accept Kjekshus's challenge to contemporary anthropologists to provide a more satisfactory explanation of the magical element in iron smelting. This we have attempted to do by working with iron smelters in Malawi, not far from the area about which Kjekshus writes. In our reporting we should admit to a bias towards technical explanations. The authors are, respectively, an anthropologist of the archaeological persuasion and a metallurgical engineer; both are metallurgical historians. Our interest at the start of this fieldwork was essentially technical, focused on the problem of how iron could be smelted by natural draught in furnaces that seemed incapable of producing enough draught. It is doubly significant, therefore, that our perceptions of the importance of the magical element in smelting increased substantially as we were progressively introduced to its mysteries. The investment of time and effort in smelting magic is large, and the expertise required is extensive. It is a technology in its own right, with its own body of knowledge and network of personal and commercial relations. We did not find that magic has a scientific contribution to make to iron smelting technology, but nevertheless concluded that smelting could not be conducted without it, because it is too important to the smelters. What follows is essentially an empirical account of the technology of smelting magic, with as much scientific identification of the medicines as could be mustered. The symbolism of smelting is also commented on, but this was not a subject we could pursue outside the confines of the smelting camp. The ethnobotany of smelting magic has already proved to be a study in itself; the wider symbolism will have to wait for another day. 144</page><page sequence="3">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY IRON SMELTING IN MALAWI: A RECONSTRUCTION In 1982 and 1983 we reconstructed traditional iron smelting at two sites in Malawi. One of these reconstructions was at Chulu village, near Kasungu in central Malawi, the other near Phoka Court, in the vicinity of Livingstonia in northern Malawi. The two sites are some 255 km apart in map distance. Chulu is a sizable village with a courthouse and is the seat of a chief or traditional authority. The village lies on the edge of Kasungu National Park, a wildlife refuge established by the British colonial authorities (Fig. 1). Many of the people of Chulu village, or at least their parents, lived in Kasungu Park before it was proclaimed, or had access to the area for purposes of agriculture or hunting. Chulu also lies on the periphery of the urban culture of Kasungu, the nearest town (50 km away), and Lilongwe, the capital city of Malawi (200 km away). A daily bus connects Chulu with these population centres. The people of Chulu are Cewa speakers, members of the largest linguistic group in Malawi (Tew, 1950), which is also dominant politically. When asked, they are likely to identify them- selves as Cewa, but are unlikely to belabour the point. Loyalties to their village government, the Malawi Congress Party and the nation cross-cut this linguistic identity. They are also matrilineal and matrilocal; thus many of the men of Chulu come from outside the village. Chulu is, consequently, subject to a mix of rural influences and traditions, as well as being poised between rural and urban (Western) lifestyles. To avoid any ambiguity the term 'Chulu' is used here to refer to the village, its people and its ways of doing things. It would be a mistake to project Chulu onto a larger canvas as representing, say, the traditions of a tribe or all Cewa speakers. The mixture of rural tradition and Western urban values in Chulu can be observed in their most basic activity, agriculture. Subsistence farming is the major occupation here, but cash cropping of tobacco and maize also occurs. Flue-cured tobacco is produced on fully mechanised estates in the vicinity, and some of this mechanisation has been adopted by successful small farmers. Traditional hoe agriculture is still very much in evidence, however, although hoes are imported from British factories and not locally made. The hoe has a thick shovel-shaped blade, is mounted at right angles to a handle which stands about chest height, and is used in a chopping sidestroke, like a pick. A variety of iron tools are produced by local blacksmiths from scrap metal (primarily axes and adzes for woodworking, but also some spears, arrow points and knives), but no iron smelting had been done in the area since about 1930. Due to the expressed interest of President Banda, who grew up near Kasungu, local interest in iron smelting was revived around 1980. One of our informants built a non- working example of a smelting furnace at this time, while another wrote an account of smelting procedures based on interviews with Vujomo, legend- ary chief smelter of the district. Vujomo died in 1980, and with him much of the local tradition of smelting. In reconstructing iron smelting at Chulu, it was difficult to assess how much of this tradition we were able to recover, especially since the men came from various villages and there were some differences of opinion about procedures. 145</page><page sequence="4">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY Scale 1: 2000 000 0 20 40 o o lo 00km TANZANIA *Kasungu MALAWI LILONGWE FIG. 1 Map of Malawi showing locations mentioned in the text 146</page><page sequence="5">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY The Phoka of northern Malawi are a subgroup of Tumbuku speakers (Tew, 1950). They identify themselves by speaking the Phoka dialect, although they can all speak 'normal' Tumbuku, and by reminding the observer at all times of their Phoka identity. The region they live in comprises the steep escarpment slopes and foothills on the eastern and southern sides of the Nyika mountain massif, which is considered inacces- sible by most non-Phoka. This eccentricity is commented upon by the Phoka, usually when looking at their glorious view of mountains, hills and Lake Malawi. Who would want to trade all this for the overpopulated flatlands? Many of the Phoka used to live farther up the Nyika slopes, some on top of the Nyika plateau at altitudes as high as 2500 m. The centre of the plateau, largely unpopulated, was proclaimed as a wildlife refuge in colonial times. Under the current Malawi government Nyika National Park was enlarged to take up the entire plateau and to spill down the escarpment sides. This proclamation involved the destruction of some 10,000 houses and the removal of their owners, many of them Phoka. In many ways this was a re-enactment in reverse of some recent Phoka history: in the latter half of the nineteenth century they survived the Nguni invasion of Malawi by moving higher into the mountains. The Phoka are not very numerous but are stubbornly independent. They tend to live on the ridges in independent family homesteads, with their terraced fields on the steep slopes in between. A young man or woman who feels like being independent may choose to move to his/her own ridge and build a house there. Thus the Phoka tend not to have villages of any size, just a few concentrations of houses at the homes of headmen or sub- chiefs (sub-traditional authorities, or STAs in the new government structure). Since the Phoka are so insistent on their own ethnic identity, we will use the term 'Phoka' here to refer to the people we worked with and their traditional ways of doing things. It will be noted that both the Phoka and the people of Chulu live on the edge of a national park in which they used to own land. Both parks contain a kind of museum of their past activities in the form of village remains, old fields and especially well-preserved iron smelting furnaces. Here the resemblance between the two groups ends, for the Phoka are much farther removed from urban culture. A Scots Presbyterian mission has been active near them at Livingstonia since 1896 and the level of literacy is fairly high. The Phoka, however, seem to have been pre-adapted to Scots Calvinism; they added the new religion and value set to their own, instead of replacing one with the other. They are widely regarded as the most traditional of Malawi's peoples. The basic livelihood of the Phoka is still subsistence hoe agriculture, with minor cash cropping of coffee beans to provide clothes and a few extras like sugar and soap. A few of their chief iron smelters were still alive in 1981 when this project started - very old men who could contribute advice but not much active assistance. Iron smelting had ceased here in the 1930s, but there is still considerable interest in the process. In our reconstruction the smelting was led by men in their late sixties who had been apprenticed to their smelter fathers in their youth. The organiser of this smelting team was the son of another well-known chief smelter, the 147</page><page sequence="6">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY late Khaura Msiska; the son had also written an account of smelting and kept a collection of smelting memorabilia in an empty hut in his com- pound. The survival of Phoka tradition was particularly evident in the ritual associated with smelting. All the participants were familiar with the procedures and were keen to instruct us in them. Since they had grown up together there was also near unanimity on what was appropriate. An extensive collection of medicines (animal, vegetable and mineral) was employed; it was firmly based on the local pharmacopoeia and formed part of their daily lives. The smelters were also regular users of the full range of traditional hand tools made out of scrap by local blacksmiths. These included brushhooks, knives, axes, adzes, spears with digging chisels hafted to the tail, arrow points, etc. A few hoes made from locally smelted iron were proudly displayed as historical items, as were some hoes traded in from Tanzania many years ago. Hoes for everyday use have to be purchased at the farmers' cooperative, however; in 1982 these cost K2-70 (about US $2.50), the price of a live chicken or two days' wages for a skilled labourer. We interviewed a large number of people in both the Chulu and Phoka areas who had, or claimed to have, some knowledge of smelting. At Chulu, the interviews took place in the courthouse and were a public event. The selection committee comprised one of us (N.J.vdM.) on the bench, flanked by Traditional Authority Chulu (the chief of the area) and his secretary on one side, and by two park rangers and an archaeologist from the govern- ment department of antiquities on the other. The leaders of the smelting team were selected after a committee assessment of the candidates, based on their knowledge of smelting and tradition. With the Phoka the Malawian assessors included only the local sub-chiefs and a research assistant from the National Parks Department who was a Phoka himself. The selection was much easier here, since knowledge of smelting was more current. CHULU AND PHOKA IRON SMELTING The iron smelting practised by both the Phoka and the people of Chulu is characterised by a two-stage process employing two furnaces. A large, primary furnace (ng'anjo in both Cewa and Tumbuku) operates by natural draught and produces a sintered (incompletely melted) sponge of slag with small pieces of iron in it. The slag is a glassy material, consisting mostly of melted rock and other unwanted material from the ore, in which are suspended the bits of iron that need to be recovered; the whole lot is sintered together into an irregular, sponge-like mass which also contains ash and charcoal. This product is re-smelted in a small secondary furnace (chiramba in Cewa, kathengu in Tumbuku) which is bellows-driven and produces an iron bloom. The bloom is a solid chunk of iron, so called because it 'blooms' when red hot, and contains some trapped slag. Much of this slag is squeezed out when the blacksmith reheats and hammers the bloom during forging, but some slag is always present in bloomery iron (wrought iron) as a useful impurity which imparts some hardness. The furnaces of the two areas differ in the details of shape, size and 148</page><page sequence="7">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY operating characteristics (especially the draught and potential tempera- ture), but the basic process is the same. The tall, natural-draught furnaces (ng'anjo) used in the first stage are particularly unusual. Most iron bloomeries, i.e. furnaces which smelt iron in its solid form, are pumped with bellows. Smelting by natural draught (also called induced draught) is an unusual process, confined almost entirely to Africa. Its distribution extends from West Africa, where it is most prevalent, through the Congo basin to Zambia and Malawi. Little is known about the origins and development of this process; the general impression (for which there is no archaeological evidence) seems to be that it was invented in West Africa and that it spread from there to Central Africa. It is, in fact, very difficult to distinguish between natural-draught and forced-draught furnaces in archaeological sites. The rule-of-thumb is that small furnaces with few tuyere (ceramic airpipe) holes had forced draughts, and big ones with many holes had natural draughts. Exceptions abound in the ethnographic record, especially in the case of large furnaces with many bellows pumpers. The only rule that clearly holds is that a furnace needs to be tall enough to induce a draught if it is to work without bellows. As the Phoka case demonstrates, a height of 1-5 m is tall enough, which does not make things easy for the archaeologist. In Malawi examples of natural-draught ng'anjo can be seen in both Kasungu and Nyika national parks, having been built there during the last century or so by the ancestors of the modern-day people of Chulu and the Phoka respectively. Although iron smelting is nearly 20d0 years old in Malawi (Mgomezulu, 1981), it is unlikely that induced-draught smelting is that old. The Cewa speakers of Malawi are associated with an archaeologi- cal tradition of the Later Iron Age (second millennium AD), which may provide an indication of when natural-draught smelting appeared on the local scene. There is no direct evidence for this suggestion, however. The Tumbuku-speakers in northern Malawi are thought to have arrived there after about 1500 AD (Derricourt, 1979), but knowledge of their smelting technology at the time is also lacking. The few iron-smelting furnaces of Early Iron Age times (first millennium AD) that have been excavated in West, Central and Southern Africa seem to be of the smaller, forced- draught variety, but this is difficult to prove. The antiquity of natural- draught smelting in Africa remains unexplored archaeological territory which will not be easy to penetrate. Our experiences with natural- and forced-draught furnaces in Malawi and elsewhere (Avery and Schmidt, 1979; van der Merwe and Avery, 1982) have heightened our awareness of how difficult it is to distinguish between the two on the basis of fragmen- tary remains. Natural-draught furnaces have probably been overlooked in many places, both in Africa and in other parts of the world. They have been observed in historical times in Upper Burma. Archaeologically there is a strong suggestion that they were used at Early Iron Age sites like Noricum in Austria, which may mean that they occurred elsewhere in Europe as well. These disconnected bits of evidence provide tantalising threads which needs must be left ravelled. In 1864, when David Livingstone travelled through the area that is now Kasungu Park, he noted that 'at every third or fourth village, we see a kiln- 149</page><page sequence="8">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY looking structure ... for smelting iron. No flux is used ... and yet capital metal is produced' (Livingstone, 1865: 536). Many such furnaces can still be seen in the park, some of them attributed to known smelters, now dead, who lived near Chulu village in their later years. The same is true for the Nyika mountain massif: there are a few well-preserved furnaces in the national park on the plateau and several more in the foothills now occupied by Phoka. The furnaces that can be seen in Kasungu Park (Fig. 2) vary somewhat in design, but the ng'anjo of this area is generally a cylindrical chimney about 2-3 m tall and 1-5 m in outside diameter, tapering to about 0-7 m at the very top. The internal diameter is about 1 m, tapering to about 0-5 m at the top and also constricted at a point about one third of the way up from the floor. The furnace thus has two internal chambers, the upper one about twice the size of the lower, with the internal constriction helping to support the weight of the charge in the stack. The smelting zone is in the lower chamber, which has six or more holes for the insertion of one tuyere apiece, spaced evenly around the circumference near the base, plus a doorway which is plastered shut during smelting. Some of the furnaces are also waisted on the outside at the same height as the internal constriction (Fig. 3). The furnaces still standing on or around the Nyika are a good deal smaller than those of Kasungu (Fig. 4). Here the ng'anjo is shaped like a cone with the point cut off, tapering from about 1-8 m in outside diameter at the base to 0-8 m at the top; the height is 1-5 m or less. On the inside the diameter tapers from about 1-3 m at floor level to 0-7 m at the top, the wall being thickest at the base. A dozen or more tuyere holes penetrate the wall near the base (three tuyeres per hole), as does a doorway, which is plastered shut during smelting after the insertion of six tuyeres. The floor is simply the soil, which is dug so that it slopes towards the door; the same is true for the Kasungu furnaces. The secondary smelting furnaces used in both research areas are much less substantial than the ng'anjo. An archaeological survey of Kasungu Park by David J. Killick (personal communication) has failed to turn up a single chiramba and none was known to survive at Chulu village. Near Phoka Court, the seat of STA Kachulu, one kathengu built in 1910 by Khaura Msiska still stands (Fig. 5). The chiramba used in 1982-83 by the Chulu smelters was a simple cylinder, about 0-75 m in internal diameter and height, with four tuyere ports; four pumpers with four goatskin-bag bellows operated it. The kathengu used by the Phoka is an oval-shaped beehive about 0-5 m long and 0-4 m wide and high, with a chimney hole of 0-2 m diameter in the top. It has a rakehole in one side, which is plastered shut during smelting, and tuyere holes at the ends. Two pumpers, each with one goatskin bag, operate the furnace. It is not the intention here to give a full technical description of the smelting procedures we observed, (see Avery et al., in press). It is more important to gain an impression of the amount of work involved and the wide economic network required for smelting. At Chulu and with the Phoka the full cycle of charcoal preparation, mining of ore, building the furnaces, gathering medicines, making tuyeres, brewing beer and, finally, smelting took about three months (July-October). This was done in the dry season, between harvest and preparation of the new fields for planting. 150</page><page sequence="9">\ , - II i i I 7' iirj -* / FIG. 2 Two views of ng'anjo (induced-draught furnace) in Kasungu Park, built by an unknown smelter.

The chiramba built by the Chulu smelters (top) is pumped with four goatskin bellows; the kathengu used by Phoka smelters requires only two At times only half a dozen men were involved, at others as many as fifty people, including women and children. The latter case was vividly demonstrated by the Phoka in 1982, when they built their furnaces against a steep mountain slope at 2000 m (6000 ft) altitude, about 1000 m (3000 ft) above the nearest road. This inaccessible site had been chosen to be near a ready supply of the right tree species for charcoal making, but primarily to be near the house of the chief smelter. Iron ore had to be mined on the Nyika plateau and carried to the site over several mountain ridges, about a day's walk for the very fit. Building the furnaces required 6500 kg (14,300 lb) of wet clay to be carried up about 600 m (2000 ft) of steep mountain slope. A metric tonne of charcoal was consumed in the smelting, requiring the felling of 88 m3 of wood. The maximum yield which could be expected from this prodigious effort was about four hoes and some smaller tools; this was the unanimous opinion of many informants over a wide area. In the past participants were rewarded with shares of the iron, but primarily with the food which is its real end product. In reconstructing the process we paid government-approved wage rates; this provides a rough measure of the labour involved. On this basis a hoe could be calculated to be worth about US $250, i.e. 100 times the price of one imported from the UK, or the value of about eighteen goats. These data should not be interpreted to mean that a traditional hoe cost eighteen goats or that the relative values of local and imported hoes were 100 to 1. At wage rates of 154</page><page sequence="13">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY $1-50 per day for the smelting team and 70 cents per day for helpers, however, it gives a useful indication of the labour costs. Smelting in the Chulu ng'anjo consisted of starting a fire on the floor, plastering the door shut, and then feeding charcoal through the chimney until the furnace was half full. Pellets of lateritic iron ore were then poured in, alternating with more charcoal, until the furnace was full. As the fuel was consumed, more charcoal was added to keep the furnace full. After twenty-four hours the fire had travelled through the stack and a pale blue plume of carbon monoxide flame erupted from the chimney. Temperatures inside the furnace were monitored by inserting thermocouples at intervals through the walls and by sighting through the tuyeres with an optical pyrometer. An attempt was made to measure the draught through the tuyeres using a water manometer, but it was insufficient to register; the draught could literally just ruffle a feather. By holding a wet finger in front of a tuyere, the sailor in our midst (D.H.A.) estimated the airflow as less than 1 knot. Nevertheless the temperature in the zone in front of the tuyeres rose to about 1250?C, a workable smelting temperature, and finally reached a maximum of about 1350?C. Fuel was added for ninety hours, some 1450 kg of charcoal being consumed in the process of smelting 75 kg of iron ore. When the furnace door was broached 114 hours after the fire had been started, 91 kg of sintered sponge was extracted. This material was broken up and the heavier pieces selected for re-smelting in the chiramba. The latter did not work very well, reaching at best 1250?C for short periods. This was insufficient for draining the slag away from the small pieces of iron in it, so as to allow the latter to come together in a bloom. Sufficient reduction of the ore had taken place in the ng'anjo, however, for us to see how the full smelting cycle would have worked if the smelters had been more technically expert. Smelting in the Phoka ng'anjo was more difficult than in the Chulu furnace, because the former is shorter and has even less draught (about half a knot). Manipulating it to a workable temperature of about 1250?C requires careful adjustment of a number of variables, particularly the particle size of fuel and charge (fine particles choke the furnace). The Phoka load the entire charge into the furnace at the tuyere level, cover it with a heavy cap of wood made from half a cross-section of a big tree trunk, start a fire with burning coals around the charge, and then fill the ng'anjo with charcoal. This procedure makes it doubly difficult to heat up the charge and seems technically inexplicable. It was clear, however, that this was the proper, traditional way of going about it. On the other hand, starting the melt in the furnace was made easier by mixing the ore with an equal amount of discarded slag from previous smelts collected at old smelting sites. On the second try in 1983 all these variables meshed and a 75 kg lump of sintered sponge was produced from 55 kg of charge. To achieve this required about 100 hours of smelting and 1000 kg of fuel. The sponge was broken up and the most promising pieces re-smelted in the kathengu. The latter worked quite effectively: two pumpers ex- pending heroic amounts of energy could keep the temperature above 1300?C. Provided the amount of charge was kept small, the product of the ng'anjo could be consolidated into usable lumps of iron. With more 155</page><page sequence="14">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY expertise and practice the Phoka smelters could produce a larger bloom in this manner. In both procedures described here the ng'anjo is designed to process a relatively large amount of low-grade iron ore into a form which can be re-smelted in a smaller furnace. This provides a technical solution to the problem of dealing with low-grade ore, but is very demanding of labour and fuel. After making due allowance for knowledge lost over the fifty years when smelting was not carried out, we still find these smelting processes fraught with difficulties and open to failure on many counts. It was not surprising, then, to hear many accounts of furnaces that failed in the past, and what one has to do when this happens. Explanations of failure can be technical, and it was clear that the experienced smelters had a considerable knowledge of how to correct such problems. The explanation was just as likely, however, to involve medicines, ritual or witchcraft. The amount of attention directed at these items in the course of smelting easily equals that expended on technical problems. CHULU RITUAL AND MEDICINES In the absence of a recognised chief smelter at Chulu, the required rituals and placement of medicines were conducted by three members of the smelting crew who had knowledge of such things. One of these was an elderly man with considerable gravitas; the second a man of middle age who had written up the reminiscences of the late chief smelter, Vujomo; and the youngest a grandson of Vujomo. There were some differences of opinion among them about proper procedure and a definite reluctance to discuss medicines in front of others. This information had to be elicited in private interviews. The medicines involved in smelting are called msinkho or mtsiriko in Cewa. A full list of the items employed are provided in Appendix 1, with botanical identifications wherever possible. A total of twenty-seven items are listed, of which twenty are specific to the smelting process only. The other seven have additional uses. Two are used to counteract bad dreams, considered to be due to the influence of evil spirits. A third is used to help cure the 'dancing disease', a disorder with symptoms of fever, headache, shouting and generally carrying on in a disturbed manner; its ultimate cure is a night of energetic drumming and dancing. Yet another is used to treat children subject to epileptic seizures. This group of medicines can be classed as cures for spirit possession, i.e. actions by malevolent ancestor spirits. For protection against the living, poles cut from the chimphakasa tree are incorporated at intervals in the fence of a cattle enclosure to protect the livestock against evil spells from jealous neighbours. The multipurpose musambamfumu tree not only provides medicines against ancestor spirits, but its boiled bark is used to anoint the body of a chief before important meetings to enhance his authority; more mundanely, it also cures Newcastle disease in chickens! A final item worth noting is a piece of the nest of the katawa bird (Scopus umbretta, hamerkop), a solitary wader usually seen standing motionless in shallow water, waiting to catch a frog. Known as the 156</page><page sequence="15">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY lightning bird to many Africans, it is believed to bring rain and, while staring into water, to see the future. None of our three informants claimed to be expert on the wider uses of medicines, their knowledge having been acquired in connection with smelting. There may be some hidden information in the list of msinkho as a result, but enough information is available to observe that the medicines are aimed at increasing the capabilities of the smelters and counteracting the malevolent influences of others, both living and dead. The beneficence of the medicines is furthermore combined with sacrifices, the keeping of sexual taboos, and prayers to God and the ancestors. The first ceremony takes place when the foundation trench for the ng'anjo is dug. A site is chosen on the western side of a large termite hill which can provide good refractory clay for building the furnace. The prevailing wind in this area is from the east, but during the dry season it is in fact quite variable, so that the choice, although traditional, appears arbitrary. A wooden peg is placed in the ground, a circle drawn around it with the help of string, and the foundation trench dug. The mtsiriko ceremony ('protecting the furnace', but also a word for the medicines) then followed. Two pegs were placed to outline the position where the door of the furnace would be, and two more directly opposite them on the circumference. Of the five pegs, the central one is not considered to have additional importance, but the four on the circumference are and must be cut from the chimphakasa or msindira chulu tree. The first of these, one notes, is of the species used in the fence of cattle enclosures to protect the cattle against witchcraft. After the placing of the pegs, medicines were placed in the foundation trench between the two areas outlined by the pegs. These included pieces of seventeen items listed in Appendix 1 plus some maize flour. The latter had been pounded and ground in the village by an old woman with no husband, i.e. a woman both infertile and celibate. As the leader of the ceremony (the oldest smelter) placed these items, he chanted quietly: 'We are building this ng'anjo here and we do not want evil to befall it, or the jealousy of a person. We want peacemakers only. We are building this ng'anjo because we are poor. We pray for success to God, through the ancestral spirits.' The leader then ran away for a short distance, to signify the departure of evil spirits, and returned to brush the foundation trench with a green branch, representing the creator and purity. These actions consecrated the furnace, protecting it from witchcraft. A day went by, to ensure that the foundations of the furnace are not disturbed in any way, then building commenced. Four days later, with the furnace half finished, it was found in a collapsed state with human excrement in four places around the periphery. Unscrupulous enemies? A cover-up of a botched construction job? We never found out, but the dedication ceremony was repeated with better medicine, and building was restarted with renewed energy and by a different method. About a week later the furnace was finished and the smelting team held a party, 157</page><page sequence="16">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY consuming maize porridge, chicken and beer. The furnace was left to dry out for a month or more. For a new furnace a religious ceremony, open to anyone in the village, is held on the evening before smelting begins. This was held at the shrines (kavuwa) to three deceased chiefs of Chulu village, through whom prayers were directed to God (Mphambe) to bless the smelting and counter evil influences. Each shrine is a small timber hut with a pot inside, into which libations of freshly brewed beer were poured. They are located outside the village, on the side away from the road. Prayers were conducted by a senior man from the village, one of the protectors of the shrine, with responses of Pepa ('Forgive us') from the participants. They then sang Hymn No. 1 from the hymnal of the local Christian church: Mzimu wanga wabwera, 'My spirit has come'. This song, which everyone knew by heart, is taken to mean that an ancestor spirit is present to intercede with God, a fact which may come as a surprise to the missionaries. After the ceremony at the kavuwa most of the congregation went home, but some elderly members accompanied the smelters to a musolo tree near the furnace, which was similarly located outside the village away from daily activities. One of the elders, a village headman, led the group in prayer again, repeating the pleas made at the kavuwa. Led by one of the smelter leaders, the same prayers were repeated a final time at the ng'anjo itself. The head of a white rooster was then cut off and its blood spilled over the inside and outside of the ng'anjo. The insides of the rooster, plus its head, lower legs and feet, were placed under the musolo tree as an offering, along with a small pot of fresh beer from the large supply in the smelting camp. The villagers who were not smelters all left at this point and the smelters' camp was sealed by lowering a boom over the path to the village. A font consisting of a bowl of tree bark in a forked upright stood next to this gate. Pieces of bark, wood and leaves were placed in this font and water added to them. In all, twenty-two items of mtsiriko were used (Appendix I), but only six of these were compulsory - without them the smelting could not proceed. Upon lowering the boom over the path each member of the smelting team (including the two authors, who were accepted as full members) washed his hands in the font; this serves as both an act of purification and also one of distancing the smelters from the people outside. The few visitors who were subsequently allowed inside the smelting camp (Chief Chulu, for example) had to wash their hands in the same manner. Finally the sacrificial rooster was roasted and shared out among us with beer; a pot of beer was sent to Chief Chulu and one to the village. Smelting could now commence and the smelting team undertook to observe the required taboos for the duration: isolation from outsiders, especially women, celibacy, and no washing of the body. Before lighting the furnace a small hole (chitewerende) was dug in the middle of its floor and three items concerned with the fire-setting placed in it (Appendix 1, items 23-5). Some kindling was added. A flame was kindled by twirling a hard stick on a piece of soft wood, a method now practically extinct in the village. Drifted grass (Appendix 1, item 23) was ignited from the flame and the fire started. Small pieces of the full list of msinkho, twenty-five items in all, were added to the fire and the doorway 158</page><page sequence="17">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY (chilema) plastered shut. The furnace was now fed through the chimney from a scaffolding until half full with charcoal. The ore charge was added and all the leftover bits of msinkho thrown in after it, whereupon the furnace was filled with charcoal. No further ceremonies took place during smelting, which is a week-long, tiring and dirty business. A great deal of beer was consumed and many songs sung to keep up morale. The songs, like the religious ceremony before the smelting, were an interesting mixture. The most popular was in Tumbuku and concerned the many Christian denominations striving to lead their adherents to the Kingdom of God, ending with a rousing chorus: 'Rush! Everybody rush to register your names, so that you may enjoy the fruits of the Kingdom of God'. Many of the other songs came from the men's nyao secret society, in which most of the smelters held membership; they were raucous, bawdy and far from feminist. After the furnace was broached villagers were allowed to come into the camp and the taboos were lifted. No special ritual was attached to the operation of the secondary furnace, the chiramba. The smelters were not successful at producing an iron bloom but, had they been, they would have carried it to the chiefs house and a celebration would have followed. Villagers are allowed to see the bloom, for a fee, at the party and may place orders for hoes. PHOKA RITUAL AND MEDICINES Phoka ritual associated with smelting is more elaborate and more firmly grounded in tradition than that observed at Chulu. Two defined personas lead the smelting: the murungu or chief smelter, who pronounces on technical matters, and the msofi or medicine man, who leads in ritual and deals with medicines. Murungu is the Tumbuku word for 'prophet', not to be confused with musungu, a 'white man'. Farther north, among the Fipa of Lake Tanganyika, irungu (plural marungu) is the word for a primary iron- smelting furnace (Wyckaert, 1914); the word rungu has a wide distribution in Central Africa in connection with iron smelting. During the Phoka iron smelting of 1982 the murungu and msofi were two different men; in 1983 one man assumed both offices. The latter case is the general rule: a chief smelter is usually a man who knows about medicines, for which one must have a calling. The metaphor for Phoka smelting is fertility and, in a more restricted sense, human reproduction. This is reflected in the words applied to the primary furnace, ng'anjo, in whole or in part. While it is being built it is simply chimpani, a pot. When the basic structure is complete, but before holes have been cut in it for the doorway and tuyeres, it becomes mwali, a young woman ready for marriage. From this point on, until the furnace has dried and is readied for smelting, it is protected every night by encircling the top with a knobbly sapling from the kowi tree (a cypress) thus 'tying it together'. This sapling, which is eventually incorporated into a protective wooden skeleton around the furnace, is called nkhwamba (Tumbuku) or khwamba (Phoka), the belt a woman uses to hold up her underwear. When smelting is under way, the smelters refer to the furnace as 'our wife'. 159</page><page sequence="18">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY The tuyere holes near the furnace base are called mapaa or feet, and the doorway is chilema, which means lame or crippled. The implication of the latter is obscure - no informant could explain it. It is noteworthy that the words ng'anjo and chilema are used in both Tumbuku and Cewa. Ng'anjo is widespread in Cewa throughout Malawi and northwest Moqambique (Price, 1963); farther west, in Zambia, the Cewa call a primary furnace mucelo and it is of a quite different design (Phillipson, 1968). In the course of smelting the Phoka make use of an extensive list of medicines, called sepo. Items of animal, vegetable, as well as a mineral nature are involved. Some originated from Lake Malawi, others from the Nyika plateau, two places separated by 40 km (25 miles) in map distance and 2500 m (7500 ft) in altitude, with some formidable mountain ridges in between. Collecting the sepo was, therefore, a lengthy process. As a result of the proclamation of an enlarged Nyika National Park, and due to the enforcement of Malawi's game laws, some items were difficult or impossi- ble to acquire locally. While the entire list of sepo is not required for smelting, a few items are considered essential, the most important being a piece of hippo hide: it had to be flown in from South Africa. The sepo are listed in Appendix 2: they include thirty-six plants, fifteen animals, fish or insects, four minerals and three artefacts. Most of the plants have medicinal uses other than that of assisting with smelting and so do some of the animals and minerals. They constitute most of the Phoka pharmaco- poeia for dealing with witchcraft, diseases caused by witchcraft and spirit possession, epidemics that threaten a community or venereal diseases that reduce fertility. Other items are clearly symbols of fertility and plenty: millet, peanuts and other edibles, schooling fish, a termite queen, a fish net, a beer strainer and the like. The final group symbolises the desirable qualities of strength, toughness, hardness, wiliness and speed - qualities one wishes to impart to the smelting and its product. While our informants tended to classify the sepo as animal, vegetable or mineral, they clearly also understood the symbolism involved. The power of the sepo is combined with ritual, prayer and the keeping of taboos. A terrace had to be constructed for the smelting and its position was chosen for purely practical reasons. Whether the choice was appropri- ate, however, was determined by divining. Several divining methods can be used, depending on the practitioner. The basic procedure is to manipulate an object and to ask it questions while suggesting answers: it stops at the right answer. The objects which can be used for divining include a decorated tortoiseshell which descends on a vertical string between forefinger and big toe; a bell-rattle under an upturned dish rubbed in circles on a flat basket; or a maize pounder stick rubbed back and forth on the ground. A positive answer having been received, the terrace was levelled and a small hole was dug at the centre of the proposed furnace; the roots of the shrubs m'pinga viwanda ('chases off evils') and kawinga wa zimu ('chases away ancestor spirits') were placed in it. These are both medicines used against afflictions like bad dreams and the dancing disease which are associated with spirit possession. The site of the ng'anjo was now protected against interference by malevolent spirits. A stick was placed upright on the spot and the circular foundation trench dug around it. The 160</page><page sequence="19">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY central medicine hole is called chihikiriro and it becomes the receptacle for all the medicines associated with the furnace. When the foundation trench is complete, a brown rooster is sacrificed by cutting off its head and dropping the jerking body in the middle of the circle. Where it eventually flops into the foundation trench will be the doorway of the furnace. Since the doorway has to face the downslope edge of the terrace, the choice is actually fairly limited: a wrong result could involve further ritual. The killing of the rooster is accompanied by the following prayer: 'At this place, allow that this pot produce a wealth of good iron. Many people did not want this pot to be built here, but all places belong to you.' Various items of sepo were now placed at intervals in the foundation trench, with strands of bopa makala grass and mwambula (maidenhair creeper) completely circling it. The body of the rooster was wind-dried for later use, while its head eventually wound up in the chihikiriro. When the furnace walls are standing, the ceremony of kughoghora ng'anjo ('we are pleased with the furnace') is held, involving the smelters and women and children from the village. Nsima - the stiff, white maize porridge which is the local staple - was prepared and the sacrificial rooster was roasted. The murungu kneaded some of the maize porridge into a sausage around a cooking stick and stuck bits of chicken meat in it. This stick was held out to the participants by the murungu as he walked around the ng'anjo, so that each could take a small amount to eat. The murungu then started a song and led his chorus in a circling dance around the ng'anjo, while everyone chewed their small portion of the communal food offering. The song has two verses, which alternately use Tumbuku and Phoka dialect for'the words 'be pleased', and translates as follows. Leader: Kaghogho [Phoka] Be pleased Chorus: Kaghoghora ng'anjo Pleased with ng'anjo Leader: Ine kaghogho I am pleased Chorus: Kaghoghora ng'anjo Pleased with ng'anjo Leader: Sekerera, sekerera [Tumbuku] Be pleased Chorus: Eeh eeh eeh, eeh eeh eeh, [Give] with love Henyani chanthemha [Phoka] from our hearts Leader: Sekerera mwali withu [Tumbuku] Be pleased with our young woman Chorus: Eeh eeh eeh (repeat) (repeat) The elders were very pleased to be able to teach the children the words to these songs and to have them participate in the ceremony lest they lose touch with the traditions of their people. At its conclusion the participants separated into groups of men, women, or children, and ate the rest of the maize porridge and chicken from separate serving dishes. Shortly thereafter a ceremony took place in preparation for the opening of the furnace door (chilema), the tuyere ports (mapaa) and the observation hole (jojo), which is situated about 0-2 m from the top. The msofi and some of the senior smelters knelt at the furnace and sprinkled millet from a 161</page><page sequence="20">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY basket and water from a pot in front of them. The msofi prayed: 'Accept this millet; if it sprouts, our furnace will be a success'. The millet was then sprouted and beer made from it, a process that takes several days. Some of this beer was carried in a calabash by the murungu to the Nyika plateau for his personal use during mining of the ore. A libation of beer was poured on the furnace wall at the place where the doorway was to be cut, immediately prior to doing so. The smelters then drank the rest. In contrast to the elaborate ceremonies associated with the ng'anjo, no ritual attended the building of the small refining furnace, kathengu. The culminating ceremony took place when everything was in readiness and smelting about to begin. By this time the performance of various younger assistants had been evaluated over months of preparation and a final smelting team of eight men was chosen. In general spectators had not been encouraged at the smelting site, but there had been a constant stream of people from nearby houses to carry building materials and supplies. In 1982 the smelting camp was about 2 km from the nearest house, but in 1983 several houses were within easy shouting distance, screened from the smelting camp by dense shrubbery. The msofi now closed the camp by barring the footpaths to it and burying three items of sepo (see Appendix 2) in the paths and at intervals around the perimeter. From this point on nobody could leave or enter the camp until the smelting was complete. Surprisingly, two women were included in the team to cook and fetch water. The cook was an elderly woman, hence not fertile, the other a nursing mother with an infant, hence not sexually available by local custom. A fertile woman, especially a pregnant one, is considered detri- mental to the smelting process. Everyone in the camp, including the women, participated in the ceremony which followed. The audience was subdued and various prayers were offered for the success of the smelting. The women had pounded together the leaves of all the plants on the list of sepo and mixed them with water into a green mulch. A portion of this mixture was placed in a bowl and the rest poured into a wooden trough. The msofi now called each participant, the authors included, to squat in turn in the doorway of the ng'anjo and to drink from the bowl. The young mother held her infant to have some poured in his mouth. Again, each participant was called forward to the trough, where they anointed face, forearms, lower legs and feet with the sepo. By these actions the team dedicated themselves to the ng'anjo and undertook to observe the vows of celibacy, isolation, peaceful conduct with their fellows, and abstinence from washing their bodies for the duration. Loading of the ng'anjo now commenced, timed to end at sundown. The msofi prepared the sepo by laying out all the items on flat baskets, adding pieces of root and bark as they were chopped from the available materials. The bulk of the sepo, especially rare items, was stored in two small gourds for future use. A yellow chihimo tuber, fist-sized, was hollowed out and most of the sepo placed in it. The remaining items were arranged around it in the chihikiriro hole in the furnace floor, which the msofi reached by crawling through the doorway. The hole was then capped with charcoal and a heavy piece of slag placed over it. The furnace was now ready for loading. 162</page><page sequence="21">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY The murungu loaded the furnace, first placing tuyeres through the doorway and plastering it shut, then climbing in through the top and supervising the placement of the other tuyeres. As charcoal, ore and even live coals were handed to him, he poured them around his feet and climbed on top of the furnace contents. With the furnace nearly full, he climbed out. All leftover bits of sepo were picked up and tossed on top of the charge. No further ceremony attends the smelting. When the furnace was broached some hundred hours later, the smelters were released from all taboos and went home to wash and see their families. In 1982 this was a glum occasion as the smelting had failed; a divining ceremony was held the next day to determine the cause. The answer was entirely technical, having to do with the type of ore used. This problem was corrected in 1983, when jubilation greeted the fact that 'our wife' had produced a large chunk of sponge which could be re-smelted in the kathengu. To operate the kathengu requires two bellows, which are made from goatskins. The goats were killed by smothering, holding their mouths and noses closed, and the skin was pulled off like a garment, starting from the head end to keep it whole. The skin of a hind leg is fitted with a tuyere and becomes an air outlet. Before firing up the kathengu three items of sepo were placed in a small hole in the floor, also called chihikiriro, but no further ritual was involved and women came to watch. Teams of smelters vigorously pumped the bellows in relay, each group trying to outdo the other and shouting encouragement to their men. As flames shot rhythmi- cally into the night sky, women ululated their applause in high keening voices, and even the two observing scientists found themselves atavistically leaping about and shouting at the top of their voices. DISCUSSION It is clear from our Malawi field data that the magical component of iron smelting is complicated and very important to the whole enterprise. The following observations follow from the data: 1. The smelters at Chulu were far less expert in the area of medicines than the Phoka. In the rural-urban continuum the Phoka are much further from the city than are the Chulu smelters, hence their knowledge of traditional practices is more secure. Our conclusions therefore lean heavily on information obtained from Phoka smelting magic. 2. The knowledge required to assemble the full range of Phoka medicines for smelting is extensive, particularly regarding plants. The effort required to obtain everything is equally large. This component is a technology in its own right. 3. Ritual and medicines associated with smelting are not secret in the sense that they form a separate, compartmentalised segment of knowledge. Many of the medicines have other uses, the prayers are simply appropri- ate words for the occasion, and the villagers participate in some of the rituals. The 'secrecy' results from the fact that medicine per se is a specialised area of knowledge, which requires a 'calling' and appren- ticeship, and is not lightly discussed in public. The exclusivity of smelting further contributes to this apparent secrecy. 163</page><page sequence="22">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY 4. The sexual taboos associated with smelting are elegantly exemplified by the Phoka case. The metaphor for smelting is fertility, conception, birth. The furnace is a woman going through the stages of puberty, marriage, reproduction. Women may participate in the smelting only if they are post-menopausal or sexually unavailable due to breast feeding. The men remain celibate during smelting and do not wash off the medicines with which they anointed themselves or the layers of grime associated with the furnace, their wife. The prevalent explanation about women being a contaminating force does not fit this situation very well; the symbolism appears rather to be that of fidelity in marriage to ensure successful reproduction. According to Marwick (1965: 66 ff.), such regulation of sexual behaviour among the Cewa is shaped by the concepts of 'coldness' and 'hotness'. Their belief is that a prospective mother and her unborn child is 'cold'. Her husband must avoid adultery during pregnancy as it will make him 'hot' and kill the child when he enters the hut. Translated into the symbolism of smelting, the furnace and the prospective bloom are 'cold' (an interesting contradiction of the reality), while sexual activity would make the smelters 'hot' and cause the smelting to fail. (This explanation comes after the fact and we did not check its applicability with either the Phoka or the smelters at Chulu.) 5. The technology of smelting is difficult and insufficiently understood to guarantee success, especially with raw materials that vary considerably in composition. Much of this lack may be due to a loss of knowledge on the part of the smelters during the past fifty years, but it is also our independent assessment of the smelting process, and of the information that furnaces often failed when smelting was in its heyday. At the same time, we know that both the Tumbuku and Cewa produced substantial amounts of iron: their marginal technology worked well enough to invite constant repetition. 6. For smelting to work, both the metallurgical and magical components must work. Failure in smelting is likely to increase ritual activity, but the diagnosis of the problem may be technical or magical. 7. If it is not obvious from the data, we unequivocally state that none of the rituals or medicines has any direct or indirect metallurgical or chemical function. This does not mean that they do not have practical value: they do, but it is of a different kind. We return now to Kjekshus's contention that the ritual component of smelting is of secondary importance, at most a type of trade union secret, but that it has become an alternative explanation for the smelting process due to the fading of technical knowledge. This viewpoint is simply not supported by the facts. The amount of knowledge and effort involved in smelting magic is a substantial portion of the total effort. An alternative explanation is provided by Wyckaert (1914), a missionary of the order of White Fathers. Writing of the Fipa, he reflects: No doubt the reader must have noted with surprise the purism the smelters affect through the whole process. ... All this is rather surprising, especially for one who is acquainted with these smelters and who knows the ordinary laxness 164</page><page sequence="23">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY of their morals. ... It is proof simply that even the most depraved natures recognise perfectly the beauty of purity, suspect its happy influence, and even understand its necessity. It proves that these sad natures know very well that sin displeases the God, attracts punishment, causes many failures even in temporal affairs. Wyckaert has a degree of insight into the problem, since he is providing explanations from one system of religious beliefs for behaviour shaped, in part, by the tenets of another. The concept of sin does not fit too well in the African context, however. Thus we find neither the materialist nor the missionary position entirely appropriate. Malinowski's functional analysis of 'productive magic' (Malinowski, 1948: 1-71; Firth, 1958: 129) fits the Malawi case in several instances. He notes that magic may serve to throw a cloak of sanctity over a technical process, buttressed by a system of rewards and punishments, thus increas- ing the seriousness of the performers. This is an idea similar to Wyckaert's 'purism' and is certainly evident in the Malawi smelting rituals. Magic may also provide an organising force, since a sequence of rituals may order a technical process. This element was not observed in the smelting magic: the rituals merely punctuate the successful completion of various prepara- tory phases. Particularly apt is Malinowski's observation that magic produces confidence in those who have to cope with the unknown. The smelting technology used by our informants was not very effective, at least not to the point of being able to predict the results. It is not necessary to conclude that they had lost this knowledge during the past fifty years; even when the collective technical expertise of their fathers was at its peak, the magical component played its indispensable role. It is not necessary, of course, that one have a scientific understanding of the solid-state reduction of iron in a fluid-slag medium in order to be able to smelt iron. It is a fact that metallurgy did not become scientific in Western industrial economies to the point of producing guaranteed compositions until the latter half of the nineteenth century. The vagaries of producing steel before such understanding was achieved are illustrated by Nordic sagas about rare magical swords which brought their owners victory in combat and conferred on them the position of leader or king. In the same vein Excalibur was probably an exceptional blade of just the right grade of steel, accidentally produced. A technology which is based on sufficient knowledge to make it work but not enough to predict the outcome falls in the same category as agriculture, hunting, fishing or love. One does one's level best, but it may still not be enough. There are too many forces at large in the world that may cause failure: God, the shades or your jealous neighbours. Iron smelting, which produces implements for agriculture and defence, is as vital to survival as food procurement or reproduction. Under these circumstances it is rational that the practitioners should see iron smelting in a metaphor of sexual reproduction and that they should enlist the aid of a sizable pharmacopoeia to ensure fertility. Magic is as much a component of smelting as it is of life. One could not consider undertaking one without the other, since, as Damon Runyon puts it, in the affairs of man the odds are always six to five against. 165</page><page sequence="24">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY APPENDIX I MTSIRIKO OR MSINKHO (MEDICINE) USED AT CHULU FOR IRON SMELTING This information was obtained in private from two informants, who differed on some of the details; comments were obtained from a third informant. The twenty- seven items are categorised, first, according to their use. Twenty-two of them are used in connection with ng'anjo, the primary furnace, either in the foundation trench during construction or in a hole in the middle of the floor (chitewerende). These are subdivided under the headings 'Plants' and 'Other'. Three items used exclusively for setting the fire in ng'anjo form a separate category, as do two items used only in the font at the gate which closes off the smelting area. Items in each category are arranged alphabetically by their Cewa names; scientific identifications and English equivalents are given as available. The symbols preceding each numbered item indicate its use during smelting in accordance with the key. Other uses of mtsiriko items are noted; the absence of such notes mean that usage is restricted to smelting.

Gate font Twenty-two items of mtsiriko were placed in a font at the gate which barred access from the village to the smelting area. The font was simply a piece of curved tree bark resting on a forked upright. To the pieces of bark, roots and leaves in the font, water was added. All the smelters washed their hands in this water, as did the few visitors (like the chief) who were allowed entry. Of the twenty-two items mentioned, only six are compulsory. Four of these were also involved at ng'anjo (Nos. 1, 3, 15 and 20), but two are exclusive to the gate font. % 26 Mtengo wa vihanda. 'Tree for spirits.' Leaves, stems and roots used. Herbalist rubs leaves in hands, chews them, and spits around you on ground to prevent evil spirits troubling you with bad dreams. % 27 The sixth charm, which is compulsory for the gate, 'has no known name'. It was not clear whether this item was actually present and its name unknown, whether it was absent, or whether its name was being withheld. The first alternative appeared most likely. APPENDIX II SEPO (MEDICINE) USED BY PHOKA FOR IRON SMELTING This information was obtained during the 1983 smelting cycle and is much more extensive than that obtained in 1982. In a few instances additional information from 1982 has been added and so noted. Although the core of the smelting teams 167</page><page sequence="26">SCIENCE AND MAGIC IN AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY remained the same, there was some change in membership between 1982 and 1983, hence the small differences. The items of sepo are arranged alphabetically in Tumbuku or Phoka vernacular, categorised as plants, animals, or minerals and artefacts. Where available and appropriate, the names of each item are provided in Tumbuku (Tu) or Phoka, Cewa (C), scientific Latin and English. The portion or part of each item used for sepo comes next, followed by notes on its uses other than for iron smelting. The symbols which precede each numbered item indicate the places where and occasions when it is used as sepo, according to the key provided. For trees and shrubs the general rule is that roots, fruits and bark are buried in the furnaces or along the perimeter of the smelting area, while leaves are pounded and mixed with water. The resulting green slurry, or infusion, is ceremonially drunk by the smelters and used to anoint parts of their bodies. Exceptions to the rules are noted.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Dr Gadi Mgomezulu (Malawi Department of Antiquities) and Dr R. H. V. Bell (Malawi National Parks) provided invaluable support in getting this project going. Many other Malawians helped us: the smelters, traditional authorities, government employees, private citizens, too many to name. Our sponsors were the National Science Foundation (USA), the Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa), the Explorers' Club and Roberts Construction Company (Malawi). Plant identifications were made by Mr Matthew Matemba and his staff at Nyika National Park. Ms Sharma Saitowitz did the drawings. We thank them all. REFERENCES Avery, D. H., van der Merwe, N.

Resume Science et magie dans la technologie africaine: fonderie du fer traditionnelle au Malawi Les pratiques de fonderie du fer en Afrique preindustrielle ont survecu au XXeme siecle en maints endroits. Differents procedes de fonderie ont ete decrits, ainsi que les tabous, les rites et les medicaments qui s'y associent. II existe des analyses scientifiques de la fonderie, mais la magie qui s'y associe n'a pas ete aussi bien 6tudiee. Nous avons participe a la totalite du cycle de fonderie de deux groupes Malawi: les habitants du village de Chulu dont la langue est le cewa, pres de Kasungu et les indigenes dont la langue est le phoka (dialecte de Tumbuktu) pres de Livingstonia. Les deux procedes comprennent un grand fourneau primaire qui fonctionne par tirage naturel et recueille une vaste quantite de minerai de fer de faible teneur en scories riches en fer. Les scories selectionnees etaient alors refondues dans un petit fourneau de rafinage dont l'air etait pompe par une soufflerie en peau de chevre. Cette technologie s'avere difficile et imprevisible et necessite une manipulation soigneuse de nombreuses variantes pour reussir. La magie qui s'y associe est egalement complexe et requiert beaucoup d'efforts et de connaissances. Les Phoka ont fourni la plus grande somme de renseignements a ce sujet. Leurs medicaments comprennent plus de soixante plantes, animaux, miner- aux et objets fabriques. La plupart d'entr'eux ont ete identifies scientifiquement et leur utilisation a ete etablie. Ils comprennent la pharmacopee locale qui traite des possessions d'esprit, de la sorcellerie et des epidemies et comprennent egalement les symboles pour la fertilite, la force, l'endurance etc. - caracteristiques desirables pour le procede de fonderie et son produit. La metaphore utilisee pour le cycle de fonderie est la reproduction humaine et les fondeurs appellent leur fourneau 'notre femme'. Les tabous sexuels associes ont pour but la fidelite. La magie de la fonderie ne possede aucune fonction chimique ou metallurgique, mais favorise le succes selon le concept de magie productive de Malinowski. 172</page></plain_text>
