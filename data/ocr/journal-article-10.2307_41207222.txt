<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science, Poetry and ^Human Specificity" An Interview with J. Bronowski GEORGE DERFER At a recent meeting of The American Scholar's editorial hoard, it was proposed that we make an effort to publish interviews with sci- entists about the work that they are doing, how they began it, and the direction that they see that work taking. This interview was taped at the Salk Institute, whose Council for Biology in Human Affairs J. Bronowski directs. George Derfer, a philosopher at the University of Redlands, has been a Visiting Fellow at the Salk Institute. George Derfer: Dr. Bronowski, over the years I have followed your thinking and as you know I am writing a book that includes your work as one of the major chapters. It is a privilege for me to interview you now because I would like to clarify some themes. So let me start with this first question. What is it that you are doing now? J. Bronowski: I have been forming a new topic in biology and behavior during the ten years that I have spent at the Salk Insti- tute in America. And since it does not have a name, I have called it human specificity. I mean by that an attempt to characterize the human species by those biological and behavioral expressions which are unique, or almost unique, to human beings. Derfer: Can you give me some examples of this? Bronowski: The moment you pose the question, what makes any animal unique? you get a variety of answers. The primates, by and large, are unique mammals in not being able to oxidize uric acid in the individual cells; and one could go through a spec- 386</page><page sequence="2">INTERVIEW WITH J. BRONOWSKI trum of such examples. The traits that are specialized in human beings are fairly straightforward. There are special biological pe- culiarities of the human brain, such as the great development of the frontal lobes, the fact that the two halves of the brain have separate functions in many details, the fact that the human brain has special speech centers. Other specifically human traits are the upright gait; the face-to-face attitude in communication (which we are using now), and in sexual intercourse (which is a hu- man cultural universal). Derfer: When did you get interested in human specificity? Bronowski: I can put the particular moment precisely. On a day in 1950 I happened to run into an old friend of mine in Ox- ford - the great physical anthropologist, Wilfred Le Gros Clark. At that time a dispute was raging between classical anthropologists and those who were using statistical methods. The dispute cen- tered on new finds in South Africa of a fossil skull called Aus- tralopithecus. Were the teeth that had been found more like hu- man teeth or more like ape teeth? The moment I looked at them I realized that the statistical methods used were foolish, because they took account of the measurements of the teeth without in- serting the additional subtleties that were required to estimate differences in shape. So I asked Le Gros Clark to measure some human and some ape teeth; and a colleague of mine, William Long, and I published quite short papers in Nature and in Amer- ican journals, and the issue was settled. From that day we have known that Australopithecus is either an ancestor of man or a closely related species which has become extinct; but that the line of man had begun by that time. I was carried away by this. It was exciting for someone who had done only abstract geometry until then - whose first practical use of mathematics had been during the war - to see this wonderful illumination of the past history of man. These teeth have since turned out to be well over two million years old. So I never turned back. That is the incident which made me aware that there is something in individual animals - what animal behaviorists call "species-specific" characters - which one should 387</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR look for in human beings in order to understand their uniqueness. Hence my human specificity. Derfer: But surely that single incident in 1950 could not have been responsible for changing your whole career. There must al- ready have been some connections in your own mind which were fused on that day? Bronowski: Yes. It is easy to remember a spectacular occasion like that dark November afternoon in Oxford. But when I search my mind, I realize that there had been two catastrophes that had prepared me for this change into the human field. Almost twenty years before that day, Hitler had come to power in Germany in 1933. And that entirely changed our conception of what constitutes a sufficient function of new knowledge. People immersed in scholarship, like me, realized that scholarship is not enough. We realized that a great, culturally advanced people like the Germans could not have been hoodwinked and brutalized by a man like Hitler if we had done our share in making new knowl- edge familiar and homely to them. The second catastrophe which had also prepared me arose di- rectly out of that: the dropping of the atomic bombs in Japan. I happened to be intimately connected with that because I was the scientific deputy on the British Chiefs of Staff Mission which went out to Japan to survey the damage at the end of 1945. Derfer: You are saying that it is not simply the nature of knowledge - its contents - but the human context out of which particular contents are created, that you were exploring. I would ask, what was the preparation before Hitler? For instance, you were already exploring the context of knowledge in The Poet's Defence; you were talking about the nature of criticism. It seems to me right there you were already concerned with anthropology. Bronowski: That is very subtle; I had not thought of that. It is perfectly true that two things about the nature of knowledge had been much in my mind. If your first book is about poetry, as mine was, then you are not inclined to mistake knowledge for the ability to solve problems. And secondly, if you have grown up, as I had, in a time when the gossamer nature of scientific connections 388</page><page sequence="4">INTERVIEW WITH J. BRONOWSKI became more and more apparent (the great time of quantum physics around the year 1930), then you also realize that knowl- edge does not mean simply what can be written down in a table of facts. So it would be quite right to say that all my life I have been preoccupied with the special character of knowledge. (I mean hu- man knowledge - in our sense there is no other kind.) And I have been closing in more and more in the last ten years on the constitu- ents of the human being that give the capacity to create knowledge. Two hundred years ago, when Immanuel Kant in Königsberg first proposed something on these lines, it could only be lip service to the intangible. But now we know a great deal about both the biological and functional connections of the mind. And I think we stand nearer to an understanding of knowledge, and ultimately to human self-knowledge, than we could ever have done until al- most the last generation. # Derfer: As I hear you link knowledge to human specificity, I realize why you speak of two catastrophes. Not only were the Germans guilty of a misunderstanding; but also, in creating the bomb, we did not appreciate the context out of which knowledge is created. This introduces an outstanding book you wrote called Science and Human Values. Would you comment on that? Bronowski: As you know from the opening page, it was exactly my riding into Nagasaki that turned my thought to Science and Human Values. I saw the reality which hitherto I had only seen in aerial photographs, and it made me conscious of the gap that existed between the practice of science and the demands to which we allowed it to be a servant. Science and Human Values has had a great influence. It is re- sponsible, for instance, for my being in this country at all, and so for my being able to work at the things I want to do, instead of things that are already written in university programs. I will say something about it and the position we have reached. Science and Human Values was delivered as a series of lectures 389</page><page sequence="5">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR twenty-one years ago, so it has a historical patina by now. At that time it was supposed that science could be exhibited as an opera- tional calculus in which the symbols were simply defined by their actions, and that nothing else was scientific knowledge. In the dreadful phrase then current, everybody talked of 'Value free" science. "Value free" is a ghastly translation of the German wert- frei, meaning "devoid of values" or "unloaded by values." That was how science was thought of then. Going to Japan, thinking over the years that had passed before that, made me conscious that that was a misconception. Derfer: Was this when you realized that it was important for you to establish a functional relationship between science and human values? Bronowski: Yes. You see, "value free" is a particularly comic phrase since the least valuable freedom in the world, and the great- est slavery, is "value freedom." Derfer: What had gone wrong, then, with the understanding of science and the nature of values? And how did you refute the misconception? Bronowski: It was a misconception on two grounds. First, it confused the exposition of science with the way in which it is ac- tually invented. That is an old fallacy. Ever since Euclid formal- ized Greek geometry, people have behaved as if science is really discovered as a set of axioms and formal propositions. But, of course, the process of discovery is exactly the opposite. Francis Bacon knew that, and has been misunderstood ever since as a re- sult. We were at it again. So in the early part of Science and Human Values I talk about "imagination"; and I make what are now obvious remarks. I say that inventing a scientific hypothesis is as imaginative an act, as inexplicable an act, as inventing the theme and the personae of, let us say, John Keats's "Ode on a Grecian Urn." The second point is that I take issue with the "value free" idea. In particular I take issue in Science and Human Values with what I think used to be called "the resolution of the naturalistic fal- lacy." Namely, the insistence that there is no relation between the З90</page><page sequence="6">INTERVIEW WITH J. BRONOWSKI "is's" that science finds - the facts - and the "oughts" that our conscience demands. My first proposition about the imaginative character of scientific invention has generally been accepted now. But my second point has not been grasped. Derfer: Tell me more about your second point. Didn't G. E. Moore say that from an "is" you cannot derive an "ought"? Bronowski: Yes, and it is nonsense. There is an intimate rela- tion, not between what "is" and what "ought to be," but between what we regard as knowledge and how we ought to behave to ob- tain it. No amount of philosophic sleight of hand can get rid of this relation. Derfer: Will you elaborate on that? How does our search for knowledge shape our conduct? Bronowski: It is very simple. There are no such things as "is's"; there are no such things as complete facts. I look at my hand. It seems to me pink, and the cuff of my shirt at the edge of it is purple. Is that true? Ask a bee or a dog or a giraffe to look at them, look at them under X-rays or infrared light, and a multi- tude of different realities emerges from the facts. You may wish to delude me by saying, "But that is all right. It is explained if you put the atoms in." What atoms? Am I to take something which is only a partial view of reality - namely, how I see my hand and my shirt cuff - and be persuaded that the whole of reality can be con- structed from it by inventing an entirely new set of entities called "atoms"? That is just a trick. Yes, a constituent of our world is now the atomic structure of matter. And we believe in that constituent because it unifies the ways of looking at my hand. And that is knowledge. But it will turn out to be wrong in a hundred years' time, because knowledge is in a constant state of re-creation and flux. Knowledge is a sys- tematization of those aspects of reality which we catch at the edge of our vision so that they form a coherent set of explanations. How do we do that? How do we get this knowledge? By behav- ing in a certain way; by adopting an ethic for science that makes knowledge possible. Therefore, the very activity of trying to refine and enhance knowledge - of discovering "what is" - imposes on 391</page><page sequence="7">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR us certain norms of conduct. The prime condition for its success is a scrupulous rectitude of behavior, based on a set of values like truth, trust, dignity, dissent, and so on. As I say in the book, "In societies where these values did not exist, science has had to create them, to make the practice of science possible." # Derfer: You perceived that values are an inherent condition for working in the field of science. I know from my own studies of your life and writings that you are also very much involved in poetry and literary criticism. How were you affected in this by the general mood about the nature of science, the underlying need for value, the procedures that were viable and not viable? Bronowski: That is a crucial question. It is pointless to think about knowledge and keep on talking all the time about science. The activities of the arts are just as profoundly ("characteristi- cally/* in the professional word), as specifically human, as the ac- tivities of the sciences. Let me begin that with a word about lan- guage, which is appropriate if we are going to talk about poetry. Human language is, among other things, a record of knowl- edge. It is characterized by a number of peculiarities, which rep- resent special faculties of the human mind. I will pick out three. Firstly, ours is the only system of communication in which we make up new sentences by manipulating parts of old sentences as if they were either parts of the real world outside us, or its images in our heads, which we are arranging in new patterns. Linguists call this the "productivity" of language. I call it reconstitution . It is unique, yet universal, in our languages, and it characterizes scientific language just as well as poetic language. Secondly, we use language so that it predicates - that is, it makes neutral statements about either real or imaginary states of affairs. That is not possible in the symbolisms of animal languages, which unite command with emotion. But when my father said to me, "If somebody makes you angry, count to ten before you an- swer," he was asking me to separate my emotion from the predica- tive content of the sentences. 392</page><page sequence="8">INTERVIEW WITH J. BRONOWSKI Predication is the clue to scientific language, and one is in- clined to stop there. But we have a third feature of language which is also unique to humans, so far as we know. We have a vocab- ulary of synonyms that enables us to make what appears to be the same statement, but to give it a different emotional tone. In other words, we can color the predication - and I use the word ' 'color" in the best and most beautiful sense, the sense of the arts. This third feature of language makes poetry possible, just as my second feature makes science possible. And as soon as you have said that, you realize that poetry is as species-specific an activity as science. Moreover, they are inseparable because of this link be- tween the two facets of language. Derfer: You also linked poetry and science at another level in The Identity of Man, which was the sequel to Science and Hu- man Values. There you characterized them both as modes of knowledge. Bronowski: Yes. There are two modes in which human beings understand what goes on outside themselves. First there is the poetic mode by which we know what other people feel because we have shared these feelings. The excitement of literature is that we can share a hundred and one emotions of which we have, in ourselves, the makings but not the development. Literature is the unfolding in each of us, when we relive it, of the potential - good and bad - which has not come to fruition. Science is the other part of human consciousness. It is the pleasure that we derive from unfolding the impersonal processes of nature. Magic, anthropomorphic science, tried to think of na- ture as a great human creature; and current mysticism does, too. But science is a more humble enterprise, of saying: How does nature work? How does nature do it? Knowledge is a creative endeavor by which we constantly see the world afresh and make more complex, more subtle analogies using the two facets of human imagination. And imagination is tied to the will to knowledge, to the belief that by knowing we are fulfilling our place in the world. Derfer: You are saying, then, that our two modes of knowl- 393</page><page sequence="9">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR edge - science and poetry - are specifically human attributes? Bronowski: Yes, and both modes of knowledge owe their be- ginning to the gift of imagination. I want to define " imagination " quite exactly here because it was an unfashionable concept until recently. The human animal is distinguished from others in being able to remember what is out of sight much longer than even such very able animals as the chimpanzee or the gorilla; and incomparably longer than lower animals. This ability to hold the past in mind - not by habit, but literally in mind - has an obvious correlative, which is that there must be an apparatus for the manipulation of imprints or images in the mind. So an apparatus which serves to reconstruct a past from the present must also be able to reconstruct other imaginary situations - in particular, the future. Both of those abilities I define as "imagination." Derfer: I am led to ask another question now that comes im- mediately to mind. Are there biological foundations for imagining? Bronowski: As I said, the idea that we actually manipulate images in the mind has been unfashionable in psychology for the past generation, when operationism and functionalism and be- haviorism have taken over. The current mode of behaviorism wants to disregard everything between stimulus and response. However, we have experimental evidence that whatever sym- bols or images the mind operates with are powerful. And they are operated with in ways which are indistinguishable from those that we would require if the images really were concrete objects. For instance, Roger Shepard at Berkeley has measured the time that it takes a person to rotate an unsymmetrical object in his mind so as to confirm whether or not it is a mirror image of another object that is shown to him. The time is directly proportional to the angle of rotation that is required; and is therefore directly propor- tional to the time taken if he actually held the object in his hand and moved it around. Derfer: I am fascinated by what you are saying. Which leads me to say that in your life I have never seen you separate poetry and science as most people seem to. How do you account for that? 394</page><page sequence="10">INTERVIEW WITH J. BRONOWSKI Bronowski: I think I have been fortunate in two ways. I have had two endowments which are in no way miraculous but whose combination has meant a great deal to me. One is an environmental one. At the age of three, I was taken from Poland as a small boy speaking Polish and learned German. At the age of twelve, I was taken from Germany to England and learned to speak English. I have forgotten all the Polish I knew, though I speak German and some other languages very well. But the fact is that I had to change my mother tongue twice before I became a writer. And I think that act of struggling to learn about Goethe as a boy, and then struggling to learn about Dickens as an adolescent, had a great effect on me. It has made me very happy whenever I read a good piece of thinking and writing. The other gift is that I have a vivid pictorial imagination. That is, I work by manipulating complicated symbols in my head. When I used to do geometry, I had no problem visualizing multidimen- sional figures and manipulating them mentally in ways it is im- possible to do in a three-dimensional space. I see even statistical problems in graphic and, so to say, active configurations. # Derfer: I am interested in your own exploration of the bio- logical foundation of knowing and of valuing. I see it historically: you have been antivitalistic, and you have also been antireduc- tionistic. What are the implications for you - as a man who is involved in science and poetry? Bronowski: You are quite right. What does all this detail about biological and behavioral features of the mind amount to when one thinks about grand themes like "vitalism" or "reduc- tionism"? Let me begin with a simple definition. "Reductionism" sup- poses that all intellectual activity is mechanical, like problem solving. I think that is wrong. At the other extreme, "vitalism" supposes that it is impossible to explain anything rationally for which we cannot set up equations. In other words, I interpret "vitalism" as a claim that if something cannot be reduced, then 395</page><page sequence="11">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR it must be magic. You only have to look at these two sides of the coin to see that they share the same fundamental fallacy, which is that rational thought consists only of problem solving. Poetry is a wonderful topic constantly to bear in mind when talking about scientific ideas, because it reminds you that you can communicate truth in a way which carries intellectual conviction without setting up equations about it. Derfer: And you are saying that both modes of knowledge stem from man's ability to use his imagination? Bronowski: Yes. Remember, I mean by "imagination" the holding of images in the mind, identifying them with constituents of reality, and rearranging them into imaginary situations. On that projection all human intellectual activities depend - poetry as much as science. In that sense man is "a foreseeing animal." There have been many definitions: man as a speaking animal, a tool-making animal. What we need to focus on now, in asking about knowledge and values, is man as the animal that can project imaginary choices - the planning animal. We are the creature that forms plans. Derfer: As I understand you then, the essence of planning is the imagination anticipating, whereby it begins new knowledge? But how does it create values? Bronowski: The gift of foresight implies that we are inter- ested in how we should conduct ourselves in the future. But the future is not fixed, and some of the possible choices that we must allow for cannot be measured now. For instance, if you build a bridge, you calculate what loads and wind factors to allow for, and you set up equations from which you can fix certain dimensions. But it is not possible to foresee all the forces which will bring quite different pressures to bear - unheard-of earth and wind pressures, and also the imponderables of risk in lives, needs and costs, and future concerns with what you now hold light. So you must be content to say, "Let's throw in a safety factor of ten." But that very phrase means that you wish to formulate a policy which, as it were, will fail to safety - moral safety as well as physical safety. З96</page><page sequence="12">INTERVIEW WITH J. BRONOWSKI We conduct our lives with the aim of satisfying not only the criteria of today and tomorrow, but those of five, ten and twenty years' time. And whether you are playing the stock market, or on the emotional market of yourself and your wife, you would be foolish to think that calculating for tomorrow will make a policy for twenty years. You must have a moral imagination. Derfer: How do you then conceive the nature of ethical con- duct? Bronowski: I call calculations "tactics." But I call the general ways in which one shapes one's conduct "strategies." And strategies for one's long-term conduct are intended in advance to mute the conflict of loyalties which every step in life will bring. Values are not commensurable. The value of saving your chil- dren instead of your wife, if faced with sudden disaster, is some- thing which you will have to decide on the spur of the moment. No amount of premeditation will cope with it. If you are actually faced with a clash of loyalty between your family and your coun- try, or loyalty to your principles as against your country, you go through agonies. Value systems are strategies in which one tries to build in advance a general mode of conduct that will lead to a satisfactory overall life, by forestalling such irresolvable conflicts of loyalties. Derfer: You believe in scientific humanism, and you offer a real alternative to the way we have previously looked on the nature of man, and the nature of society, modes of knowledge, and values. But I see all around me now a revolt against the rational values. How do you see the place of a rational ethic in your own life and work? Bronowski: In my own experience, when I have lived a purely professional life (as I did before 1933), I found it not enough. And this although I lived a rich life as a research mathematician at Cambridge, where I was also the editor of a literary magazine called Experiment. I did not feel that I was close enough to what at that time it became fashionable to call "social responsibility." If I look back now on the forty years that have passed since then, I would say that I have been wrestling with the problem 397</page><page sequence="13">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR of discovering how social responsibility arises from a much deeper ideal: human responsibility. "Social responsibility" means respon- sibility to society. "Human responsibility " means responsibility to the human race or, as a collective idea, to the human personality - the human specificity. That is why I began this interview by saying that we are enter- ing a phase of human self-knowledge. And the examples of human specificity I gave are all means by which man has found a home in a world for which he was fitted by nothing but his adaptability. Man has found a home by nesting in knowledge. That is hu- manism, or what I tend now to call "scientific existentialism/' It is a patient search to avoid all such shortcuts as saying, "Immu- table laws were laid down" - in the Bible, or in psychological or social prescriptions. I want to answer the question "How should human beings behave?" without saying "I can give you no sup- port for my answers except the Hammurabi code or some modern dogma." I do not think that the religion of Moses, the religion of Freud, or the religion of Marx are without force. I think they were all made by men of great imagination. But I think that they are all attempts to take dogmatic shortcuts to the evolution of knowledge which is still going on in man. * Derfer: I am interested that you account for the human sense of self against the background of the species. It seems to me in your book, Nature and Knowledge, you rely very much on your understanding of evolution. What is evolution? Does it have a plan or a purpose? What alternatives can one give to the answers given by older institutions, for instance the church? Bronowski: I cannot think about human specificity without constantly having an evolutionary picture in mind. What char- acters distinguish each animal species? How has its evolution medi- ated these characters? And was evolution designed to reach what appears to be its present apex - the human species? I do not think that evolution can be conceived as having been З98</page><page sequence="14">INTERVIEW WITH J. BRONOWSKI designed for anything. Does it have a purpose? Does it follow a master plan? These are anthropomorphic questions which derive from our self-recognitiön of man as a planning animal. They go with a picture of God in the image of man that dates at least from the Old Testament, and so is over three thousand years old. Derfer: Are you holding its age against it? Bronowski: Yes. Pictures as old as that cannot be right now because they are too simple, rudimentary and undeveloped. Let me explain that with an easier example. I think that, say, the Iliad is a marvelous poem. If I had to choose whether the Iliad should survive or whether D. H. Law- rence's Women in Love should survive, I would plump for the Iliad. But Women in Love is a much more subtle analysis of hu- man relations than the Iliad is. And it could not have been written when the Iliad was written, because the explicit awareness of those relations - the self-awareness of people in it - was not a part of literature or, so far as we know, a part of explicit thought in the Greece of Homer. New cultures are able to interweave themes which once were held apart, and thereby to make them more sensi- tive and deeper. Derfer: So you see both cultural and biological evolution inextricably woven into the fabric of human knowledge? Bronowski: Yes. Evolution is the great creator of novelty. And evolution has taken place in the natural process of time. To sup- pose it following a plan, supposes a planner; I see no way out of that. Instead, evolution follows a statistical pattern. It is a strange statistical pattern, because it runs counter to what is usually called the second law of thermodynamics. But it is explicable. The com- plexity and richness that evolution produces are explicable. Derfer: You must elaborate on the relation between evolu- tion, statistics and the question of accidents. If you appeal to sta- tistics, are you not reducing human specificity itself merely to an accident? Bronowski: On the contrary, it is those who appeal to God and special creation who reduce everything to accident. They as- sign to man a unique status on the ground that there was some 399</page><page sequence="15">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR act of special creation which made the world the way it is. But that explains nothing, because it would explain anything: it is an explanation for any conceivable world. If we had the color vision of the bee combined with the neck of the giraffe and the feet of the elephant, that would equally be explained by the " theory " of spe- cial creation. Yet we do not have those features, and we do not believe that they are biologically compatible. Therefore, our criterion of what is compatible sets a limitation on an acceptable explanation. That is why I say that to call in a special or miraculous act of creation reduces every conceivable world to accident. Derfer: Then how does your new statistical pattern substi- tute for God? Bronowski: The puzzle of evolution is not that things change, but that living things and their products become more complex. There is nothing to explain nowadays except the evolution of com- plexity* What does a theory of evolution have to explain? That by and large, natural processes destroy any order that they meet - like breaking an egg. By contrast, the egg in evolving grew more complex in time - it has the arrow of time written on the eggshell. All I provide, therefore, is a statistical theory to show how such a structure can become more complex in time. Derfer: Are you not still using ' 'statistics' ' as another name for "accident"? You cannot persuade me that the eggshell was made by accident! Bronowski: We need to understand the word "accident" cor- rectly. Nonliving matter has a hidden potential for forming many combinations. Some of these combinations in their turn can com- bine to form entities which can copy or reproduce themselves - that is, which can begin life. The accident happens when some of this hidden potential is realized and the combinations become actual. But it was there, unrealized, in hiding, from the beginning. It would be an inconceivable accident if the structures we • Dr. Bronowski's "New Concepts in the Evolution of Complexity" appeared in the Scholar in two parts, the first in the Autumn, 1972 issue and the second in the Winter, 1972-73 issue. 400</page><page sequence="16">INTERVIEW WITH J. BRONOWSKI know, the eggshell say, had been created in one leap from a hand- ful of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and so on. Evolution works by a different statistics. It builds up complexity as it were in strata, one after the other. It starts when the encounter of atoms makes small molecules. Some of these naturally are more stable than their separate parts. They in turn begin to assemble other chemicals, some of which are more stable than their con- stituents. And so it goes up a ladder of strata in which the struc- ture at each level is more stable than its constituent parts in the level below. And "stable" simply means that it is less likely to break down under environmental disturbances. This is, of course, exactly where the direction of evolution aims. It is what life is about: an organi- zation of matter which is less likely to break down under environ- mental disturbances than its parts are. And that is how it runs against the second law of thermodynamics, which is a constant breaking down under environmental disturbances. I call that the evolution of complexity, and it works by what I call stratified stability. As a statistical concept it holds water, and I am confident that it will become the fundamental account of evolution. # Derfer: You have discovered, it seems to me, a principle or strategy that is in nature herself. What is the relation, Dr. Bro- nowski, between your act of discovery and that which is discov- ered? Does it not suggest that there is some kind of anthropomor- phic or plan-like strategy in evolution as a creator? Bronowski: I will illustrate how I interpret the achievement of evolution in shaping the human mind to seek for knowledge and creative ideas. Supposing, as Arthur Eddington suggested, that we really did set down a battery of monkeys at typewriters in the hope that they might type, not the works of Shakespeare, but a single couplet - say, the sonnet which begins, "Shall I compare thee to a summers day?/Thou art more lovely and more temper- ate." Then I once calculated that in the fifteen thousand million 401</page><page sequence="17">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR years that the universe has existed, the monkeys, even with con- siderable mechanical aid, would not yet have typed by chance the sequence of words, "Shall I compare thee to a sum" - which, you observe, fall far short of Shakespeare. The fact is that the evolution of man is the quickest way to write a sonnet. The human mind is a new step, which has opened up a new wealth of creation. Derfer: You have shown that when the mind turns creatively and critically on itself, it discovers why knowledge is species- specific to man. And are you saying that with knowledge begins a new level of creation? Bronowski: Yes, there lies the deep question: What is the place of knowledge in the future? And there it is crucial to under- stand the unique status of knowledge. Knowledge is our element. Our ability to turn knowledge into action has made us able to cope with the hostile environments of the past, starting with the first Ice Age. And more than that, knowl- edge is what we take pleasure in. Insofar as poetry gives us plea- sure, it is a pleasure in that mode of knowledge - in the identifica- tion with aspects of the personality of others which are only dimly represented in ourselves. Insofar as science gives us pleasure, it is in finding the way that nature can be rationally decoded, like solving the impersonal plot of a detective story. Derfer: Yet rational and impersonal knowledge do not com- mand respect now. There is a revolt against science, and a return to mystical experience. You must have met it among students as I have. Bronowski: Criticism of science that I hear comes from people who have really made no attempt to grapple with it. So I think as little of it as I think of Jeremy Bentham's disdain for poetry, since I know that, though he was a great man, he did not understand what poetry is about. If a man criticizes science, and it turns out that he does not know a quantum from a quantifier, I am bound to say, "When your guru has taught you how to solve linear dif- ferential equations, I will listen to you." I am sorry if that sounds high-handed. But man did not get where he is by cutting out the 402</page><page sequence="18">INTERVIEW WITH J. BRONOWSKI hard intellectual work, and drawing his judgments from the pit of his stomach. If I make a generalization about man's place among the pri- mates, I do not support it by merely asserting that "I do my thing, and the chimpanzee does his thing, what more is there to say?" (as a student once said to me). Why is that not enough? Because it is exactly what Hitler asserted when he shouted, Blut und Boden. Hitler also "knew" in the pit of his stomach that the student and I (he was a Negro, and I am a Jew) were both to be classed not with humans but only with chimpanzees. And yet, and yet, whenever the words "rational argument" are uttered, there is a feeling that there is a limited way of looking at the world: where is the imagination? This is the primordial misconception about knowledge that raises its head at least once in every century. The misconception is that science or any intel- lectual activity is done - or understood - by rational thought with- out imagination. That is just not true. Derfer: You are returning to the first theme of your work, which is the role of the imagination as a foundation for knowledge. Bronowski: Yes, exactly. Whenever in the past I have proved a new theorem in geometry, I always had a good idea - an intui- tion, if you like - how the theorem would go. Sometimes I was right. Sometimes I was wrong, and I proved a more interesting re- sult: the opposite theorem. And sometimes I was neither right nor wrong, but it turned out that no such theorem could be proved. And that was the most searching result of all, because that is where the frontiers of knowledge lie. Progress is made in any intellectual field by starting with in- tuitive hypotheses. Such a hypothesis was Tolstoy's idea that you could make a vivid story of the unity of the Russian people by put- ting together the Napoleonic war and the mishaps of several aristo- cratic families. Tolstoy did not write by a constant miracle of in- spiration, from page to page, from day to day. He conceived how such a novel would go, then he made drafts; he tried out how the parts would fit, and he changed things. And that is exactly how you prove a theorem. 403</page><page sequence="19">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Then where does rational thought come in? The rational pro- cess is the verification of the intuition by steps which can be com- municated to others. That is what distinguishes science from non- sense, philosophy from mysticism, and the inspired work of Watson and Crick on the double helix from Hitler raving at Nuremberg. Derfer: So rational procedures are the means by which we confirm and communicate the working of our imagination? Bronowski: Yes. Human knowledge consists of the casting into rational form of the proof or disproof of what one may call intui- tions - that is, hypotheses - in such a way that they can be shared with other people. That is the new discovery by nature. Indeed, I want to guess something rather outrageous about that. In the evolutionary picture of, say, ten million years from now, I believe that we shall find that the coming of man was a new turning point. Before man (or, at any rate, the primates) evolu- tion had invented only one way to make an animal fit its environ- ment: natural selection, which simply kills off those that do not have the right automatic responses. We are the first creatures in whom automatic adaptation to the environment has been largely replaced by a process of planned response. And "planned response" means precisely imagination tested by rational examination. That has worked brilliantly; we have evolved at a fantastic pace, and dominate all other creatures. I do not think that evolution is going to stop with us. I think that over the next ten million years, the animals that continue to rely on automatic accommodation to the environment will not be able to cope with other new species in which the element of plan and rational verification begins to develop as in us and to override the stock response. We are not the climax of evolution, except for a moment. But we are, I think, a new gate into evolution, and a turning point. 404</page></plain_text>
