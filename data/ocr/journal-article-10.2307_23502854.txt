<plain_text><page sequence="1">AL-QIRQISANÏ'SAL-QIRQISANÏ'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS AND CHRISTIANITY By LEON NEMO Y, Yale University Library, New Haven, Conn. OUT of the work-rooms of the State Public Library at St. Petersburg the great master Harkavy published in 1894 the first introductory part of a large legal work entitled "Book of Lights and Watch-Towers" by the Karaite scholar known as al-Qirqisànï. Harkavy was himself the first to state that the newly found work is one of the earliest and most trustworthy of all the accounts of the Jewish sects of Saadiah's time; we might safely add: also the most detailed, accurate, and as far as it was possible in the tenth century, the most impartial. At the outset, this edition was doomed to ill luck; Harkavy's immensely valuable introduction and notes were written in Russian, and the reviews published in "some periodicals devoted to Jewish science were, therefore, limited to the Arabic text. Poznanski, who published another fragment of al-Qirqisànï's work in the Kohut Semitic studies, and who prepared a masterly report on the al-Qirqisânï-manuscripts in the British Museum for the Festschrift Steinschneider, touched upon Harkavy's publica tion only en passant. In various subsequent works minor refer ences to Harkavy's publication have been made from time to time, but no full translation of it has, as far as I know, ever been made. My interest in al-Qirqisànï's work was originally purely linguistical and was due to the fact that it is one of the earliest specimens of the Eastern branch of the Judaeo-Arabic dialect, as distinguished from the Western branch exhibited in the works of Maimonides (who is, of course, two centuries later than al Qirqisànï) and characterized by strong influences of the Egyptian and Maghrebine vernaculars of the Moslem-Arabic. But in the course of my study I had, volens nolens, to refer every once in a while to the contemporary Jewish sources, as well as to make 317</page><page sequence="2">318 LEON NEMOY [2] excursuses into the field of Jewish law and ritual, especially in those chapters of the Book of Lights where al-Qirqisànï criticises the Rabbanite law and lists a series of differences between the Palestinian and the Babylonian rituals. Nevertheless, the present translation lays claim to little more than a more or less faithful rendering of the Arabic text. In my notes I have paid special attention to the philological aspect of al-Qirqisânï's language and also to matters of a purely Moslem nature. As far as my knowledge of Jewish literature goes, I have given references to Talmudic, Midrashic, and later sources, and have tried to explain the legal part of the text to the best of my understanding. It goes without saying that the references can be multiplied a thousandfold; a comparative study of the Book of Lights and the later Karaite literature is also a desideratum ; but for this I have neither the necessary erudition nor space.1 The chief sources for the bio-bibliography of al-Qirqisânï are the following: M.

Chapter I FOREWORD . . . [(The Rabbanites say:) "I do not recognize either Anan or] Benjamin (al-Nahàwandï)2 or any other man of this class since they are dissenters who have gone over to the Gentiles.3 But I do recognize the School of Hillel and the School of Shammai, for they are the basis (of true religion), inasmuch as they adhere closely to (the books of) prophecy and have received (their 2 See below, Chapter XIV. 3 אד הם נוארג באנו באלאמם the author had in mind the Moslem Khawârij ; there is no need to emend באלאפה, as Bacher does.</page><page sequence="4">320 LEON NEMO Y [4] teaching) directly from the prophets; they are the foremost authority in the (Hebrew) language, and they are the prevailing majority." If someone should say that this is a better way than the way of those who consider Anan as one of the Rabbanites, and his teaching as essentially identical with theirs, he, too, is in the wrong. The true procedure should be this: laws should be made along the lines of research and speculation only; whatever is proved by research and speculation to be necessary and logical should be accepted as dogma, no matter who adheres to it, be it the Rabbanites, or Anan, or anyone else. Yea, if scholars engaged in research and speculation should arrive at some new doctrine which none (of the former authorities) had heretofore professed, its acceptance should be obligatory, inasmuch as it is (logically) correct and unassailable. There are other so-called Karaites, for example, those of Persia, especially those of (the city of) Tustar,4 who, notwithstanding their assertion that they are in favor of speculation, revile those who engage in rational speculation, i. e. in some of the secular sciences, especially dialectics and philosophy. What makes them averse to this (speculative method) is this: first, they are too lazy to learn all about this matter, and it is also too difficult (for their minds); therefore, they seek to be relieved from this fatiguing pursuit. Secondly, some of them erroneously think that rational specula tion does harm to him who engages in it by leading him to heresy; in fact, they assert that they have seen some men who have been engaged in this pursuit and have become heretics. This opinion of theirs, however, is the very cause5 of (all heretical) doubts and suspicions, inasmuch as it makes the listener believe that rationalism is averse to religion and is directly opposed to it ; if this is so, then religion is assailable (as something irrational), but this is utterly absurd. They certainly ought, therefore, if they would only try to be just, to refrain from accusing rational ism of being the cause of heresy for the mere reason that some men who have been engaged in speculation went astray (in their faith), since a great many scholars have been pursuing the same ■י Tustar, or, as the Persians pronounced the word, Shustar, was the capital of Khuzistan; cf.

Neither should they assert that renunciation of speculation is the cause of added strength of faith, inasmuch as there are a great many people who have never done any speculation by means of (pure) reason and have no idea of it, and yet they are dissenters and believers in all sorts of heresies. We shall show further on the absurdity of the views of these people, and we also shall prove that intellect is the foundation upon which every doctrine should be built, and that all knowledge should be derived by means of reason only. I do not think there is any devotee of speculation more sincere than Daniel al-Qumisi, or one more conscientious in giving (the method of) speculation its just due. Whatever he derives by means of speculation, or is led to by research or (logical) reason ing, he accepts and recognizes. In fact, it is his habit to write to his pupils who had copied his writings (for their personal use) and to inform them of everything that recently appeared to him to be true, in case it is contrary to what he had formerly written down in his works, with the request that they should insert it into (their copies of) his works. Nevertheless, he is dissatisfied with rationalism to such an extent that he reviles both it and its devotees many times in his works. Although he is an excellent scholar in the Scripture and in philology, there is one thing which greatly injures his prestige among some of our coreligionists, namely his dislike of the sect of Anan, whom he assails very strongly. At first he used to esteem Anan very highly; he men tioned him in many places in his works with the epithet "Chief of the learned men;"6 subsequently, however, he began calling him "Chief of the fools."7 For a man of such learning and piety this is certainly very shameful. Another great misfortune which handicaps our coreligionists is their opposition to one another, and the dislike and hatred they bear towards each other, although it is only the desire and lust for power which incites them to this. The above mentioned considerations prompted me to compose this work. I desire to record in it some of the opinions of (various) .ראש המשכילים 6 .ראש הכסילים ל</page><page sequence="6">322 LEON NEMOY [6] scholars concerning the laws (of the Jewish religion) and the reasons they give (for their opinions). Some of them are already included in the works of my predecessors; some are such as I have heard in several assemblies (of scholars) which I personally attended; and some have been reported to me, namely such as I have not heard myself (from their authors). Such questions and answers as I think to be right I shall designate as such; likewise I shall disapprove of such as I believe to be wrong. Where in my opinion the matter is doubtful I shall leave it as it is; perhaps someone else, upon further examination, will find out more than I could. I shall try to make my account neither too long nor too short, neither too detailed for the scholar, nor too concise for the student. Upon the Most Exalted Creator I rely for help in this and in all other praiseworthy undertakings; to Him do I direct my humble prayer for all the things which his servant and beloved friend David—to whom be peace—prayed for when he said [Psalms 119.18f.] : "Open my eyes so that I may see the wonders of Thy Torah; a stranger am I in this world, do not conceal Thy precepts from me." Chapter II CHRONOLOGICAL ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 1] Jeroboam was the first who introduced differences in religion and sowed rebellion in Israel after the establishment of the kingdom8 by making changes and alterations in the laws, as the Scripture says about him in more than one place [1 Kings 14.16, etc.]: "He who made Israel sin," referring to the "two golden calves" which he introduced; also his speech to the people [ibid., 12.28]: "Enough of your going up to Jerusalem!", etc. What prompted him to do this was, according to the Scripture, his wish to persist and remain in rebellion . . . [because he feared] lest the people should conceive a longing9 for their (legitimate) king of the seed of David, should they continue going up to 8 The lack of the modifying pronoun ("his") with the word "kingdom1' shows that this is merely a general statement, i. e., after Israel had become a monarchy, in other words, after Saul. י Read תוק\</page><page sequence="7">[7] AL-QIRQISÂNÏ'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 323 Jerusalem; in such a case the kingdom might slip out of his hands, as the Scripture says [ibid., 12.26-28]: "And Jeroboam said to himself: 'Now the kingdom may return to the house of David ; if this people will go up to offer sacrifices in the house of God in Jerusalem, the heart of this people will turn back to its rulers, to Rehoboam the king of Judah.' And the king took counsel and made two [golden calves] and said to them: 'Enough of your going up to Jerusalem! these are thy gods who have brought thee out of Egypt!' " Some of our coreligionists have said that he introduced these two calves only as substitutes for the two Cherubs ; this suggestion is not improbable, because his only intention in introducing these differences was to imitate that which had already been enjoined (in the Torah) ; this is proved by the fact that he substituted for the (Aaronite) priests men from the common people, as it is said [ibid., 12.31]: "And he appointed priests from the common people, who were not from the children of Levi;" likewise, he instituted a pilgrimage in the eighth month, instead of the seventh, as was the custom in the temple (of Jerusalem), for it is said [ibid., 12.32]: "And Jeroboam established a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that was ob served in Judah." It is possible that he was making the people believe that the year was a leap-year, as some of our coreligionists have suggested.10 This is what the Scripture reports concerning the differences and innovations introduced by Jeroboam. It is possible that he did differ in many other laws, changing and altering them, but the Scriptural account is limited to the enumeration of the most important and grievous differences. But the fact is that Jeroboam did not deny the Glorious Creator nor abrogate Him, nor did he worship idols, as some people imagine. This is evident for two reasons: First, as we have shown above, he (invariably) issued new regulations instead of (such of) those already in the Scripture (as he wished to change) ; had he renounced the entire faith, he 10 Al-Qirqisânï means to say that Jeroboam evidently did not break with the principles of the faith, but introduced only minor changes in order to make the Ephraimite church independent of the Judean, although by no means less orthodox.</page><page sequence="8">324 LEON NEMOY [8] would have abolished the whole code of law, having no need to change (some of) it; nothing else but his fear lest the kingdom should be lost to him was, as we have shown, the (real) cause of his innovations and alterations. The second reason proving that he had neither renounced the faith nor worshipped idols, is (the following) : we read that Jehu destroyed the idols and killed their Israelite worshippers; as it is said about him [2 Kings 10.28]: "And Jehu destroyed the Baal from among Israel;" and yet later on the Scripture says that he was persisting in the sins of Jeroboam, as it is said [ibid. 10.24]: "But as to the sins of Jero boam ben Nebat that he made the Israelites sin, Jehu did not desist from them." This is the clearest proof that he" introduced the two calves not in order to worship them as heathen people worship idols." If, however, someone should say: "But does not the Scripture say that he used to sacrifice and burn incense before them, since it says [1 Kings 12.32]: 'To sacrifice to the calves that he made?' And does it not say in another place: 'To burn incense before the calves that [he made]' . . .?"13 . . . "He will be brought to Assyria" [Hos. 10.6], etc.: we learn that that which is said about Israel in the captivity [2 Kings 17.22]: "And the children of Israel walked in all the sins that Jeroboam had committed" means the (very same) licentious customs which he had invented and introduced in place of the true laws. Afterwards the people of Judah followed them in this deviation, as it is said [ibid. 17.19]: "And Judah did also not observe;" and [ibid., ibid.]: "And they walked in all the sins that Israel had sinned." Thus they all went into exile persisting in these customs, and they spread all over the world transmitting them (generation to generation) down to the present time. Perchance someone reading this paragraph will disapprove of 11 i. e. Jeroboam. " Al-Qirqisànï means to say that even after having destroyed the Baal Jehu is charged with imitating the evil ways of Jeroboam,—a clear indication that these "evil ways" were not Baal-worship. 1ג There is no such passage in the Old Testament; al-Qirqisànï seems to have combined the above quotation from 1 Kings 12.32 with the word להקטיר which occurs in the following verse.</page><page sequence="9">[9] AL-QIRQISÂNÏ'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 325 the verbosity that appears in it, since my aim in this work is to report (only) the cause of the change in the (true) laws. Let him, then, to whom this occurs, know that I have done it only for a reason which will not be hidden from him who earnestly seeks to examine the matter. 2] Next after Jeroboam came the Samaritans, whom the (Jewish) people call "Cutheans," and of whom it is said [2 Kings 17.24]: "And the king of Assyria brought from Babylon and Cutha." It is they of whom it is said [Ezra 4.1] that they are "The enemies of Judah and Benjamin," for the Scripture tells us that they approached the chieftains of the children of Israel at the time the latter were building the second Temple; as it is said concerning them [Ezra 4.2]: "And they approached Zerub babel and the chiefs of the families and said to them: 'Let us build with you!'"; and they said (also) [ibid., ibid.]: "And to Him do we sacrifice from the days of Esarhaddon king of As syria." It is said that down to the present time they mention14 Sanballat the Horonite who had been their chief. 3] After the Samaritans appeared the chiefs of the Assembly, i. e., the (chiefs of the) Rabbanites, namely at the (time of the) second Temple. The first of them who is mentioned is Simeon, whom they call Simeon the Righteous. They say that he was one of the epigones of the Great Assembly.15 As for those whom they call "fellows of the Great Assembly," they say that they were at the time of Ezra and Nehemiah.16 The Rabbanites acknowledged the authority of (the members of) the Assembly17 merely because they, too, were following the licentious customs inherited from Jeroboam. Therefore, they confirmed and approved these customs, defended them by argumentation, and composed the Mishnah and other books in explanation of them. When occasionally one or another (member) indicated the true meaning of some law they removed him and persecuted him. This was 1יי In their prayers? 15 A literal translation of Ab. 1, 2. 14Sic! /&lt;■ //&lt;■ / , /* / 17 ראם, probably weakened in the colloquial pronunciation to ראס or even /V" /.' /m/ ראם ; a teshdid, if preserved, would turn the word into רוס.</page><page sequence="10">326 LEON NEMOY [10] the case with Gamaliel who fixed (the time of) feasts by the appearance of the new moon ;18 likewise with Eliezer ben Hyrcanus who disagreed with them in the question whether vessels the construction of which has not been completed should be con sidered unclean; they excommunicated him and kept away from him notwithstanding his display of miraculous proofs of the correctness of his opinion and the direct testimony of God concerning this (question). God forbid that we should agree with their opinion about this matter; it is only they who profess to think so. We shall mention (later) the whole story as they relate it in the Talmud.19 4] After the Rabbanites appeared the Sadducees; their leaders were Zadok and Boethus. They were, according to the Rabbanites, pupils of Antigonus who succeeded Simeon the Righteous and received instruction20 from him. Zadok was the first who exposed the Rabbanites and disagreed with them; he discovered part of the truth and wrote books in which he strongly rebuked and attacked them. He did not adduce any proofs for anything he said, but limited himself to mere statements;21 excepting one thing, namely the prohibition of (marrying) the daughter of the brother and the daughter of the sister, which he inferred by the analogy of the paternal and maternal aunts.22 As for Boethus, he used to say that the feast of Pentecost must fall on Sunday23 only, which is also the opinion of the Ananites and of all the Karaites. 5] Thereupon appeared the teaching of a sect called Mag harians; they were called so because their (sacred) books were 18 Qirqisànï refers here to the deposition of R. Gamaliel reported in b. Ber. 27b.

One of them is the Alexandrian24 whose book is famous and (widely) known ; it is the most important of the books of the Magharians. Next to it (in importance) is a small booklet25 entitled "The Book of Yaddua,"26 also a fine work. As for the rest of the Magharian books, most of them are of no value and resemble mere tales. 6] Next appeared Yeshua, of whom the Rabbanites say that he is (the same person as) "The Son of Pandera;"27 he is known as Jesus son of Mary.28 He lived at the time of Joshua ben Peraljiah,29 and it is said that Joshua was his uncle. This happened at the time of (the) Caesar, the king of Rome,50 i. e. at (the time of) the second Temple. The Rabbanites plotted against him until they killed him and crucified him.51 7] It is said that there is on (the shores of) the Nile of Egypt, twenty parasangs from the town of Fustat, a sect called Qara'ians. They are called so because they use vessels of gourds52 and of nothing else. Some theologians say that they claim to be descendants of Johanan ben Korah.55 24 Harkavy thinks that this is Philo, and Bacher accepts this identification. But Philo wrote more than one book, and his works were hardly "famous and widely known" among the Arabic speaking Jews in Western Persia; we have nothing to show that an Arabic translation of any of Philo's works was ever made. .כתיב צגיר 25 26 i. e., either "The Book of (a man by the name of) Yaddua," or "The Book of the Known," or, by a figure of speech widely used in Hebrew, "The Book of the Unknown;" I think the latter meaning is the most probable. 27 Cf. Tos. Hul. 222, Sanh. 67a and Shab. 104b [L], The true meaning of this name is as yet subject to controversy. 28 The Arabic form is 'Isa ibn Maryam. 2' Cf. Sota 47a and Sanh. 107b in uncensored editions [L]. 30 The Arabic form is Rum; this is, strictly speaking, the name for the Byzantine empire. 31 Sic! (קתלוה וצלבוה). 32 Arabic קרע (gar'). 33 Probably the Jewish general in the retinue of the governor Gedaliah ben Ahikam (Jer. 40.8). Harkavy (p. 262, note 3) brings a quotation from the dictionary of the Karaite Daud al-Fâsï, to the same effect; "Down to the present time the people who follow the teaching of Johanan ben Korah are called Qara'ians."</page><page sequence="12">328 LEON NEMOY [12] 8] Thereupon the Rabbanites broke up into two parties, the School of Hillel and the School of Shammai. The people of Babylonia accepted the system of the School of Hillel, while the people of Palestine accepted that of the School of Shammai. Hillel and Shammai received (instruction) from Shemaiah and Abtalion. The controversy between the School of Hillel and the School of Shammai took place on the third of Adar, and several people from both parties were killed.34 (9) After the above-mentioned (sects) appeared Obadiah, known as Abu 'Isa al-Isfahânï. He pretended to be a prophet. This happened at the time of (the caliph) 'Abd al-Malik ibn Marwân.35 It is said that he was the leader of a rebellion against the (Moslem) government; some people followed him until he had an army, but he was overcome in battle and killed. Some of his followers say that he was not killed, but entered a hole in a mountain and was never heard of (again). The most wonderful thing about him in the opinion of his followers is the fact that although he was, as they say, an illiterate tailor and could neither write nor read, he produced books and pamphlets without having been instructed by anyone. In Damascus a group of his followers are known as Isunians. 10] After Abu 'Isa appeared Yudghân, called by his followers "The Shepherd," meaning that he was the shepherd of the people (of Israel). It is said that he was a pupil of Abu 'Isa Obadiah and that he also pretended to be a prophet. His pupils assert that he is the Messiah. 11] After Yudghân appeared the exilarch Anan; this was at the time of (the caliph) Abu Ja'far al-Mansur.36 He was the first to explain the whole truth about the laws. He was learned in the doctrines of the Rabbanites, and there was not one among them (who would dare) to make light of his learning. It is said that Hai, the president of the academy,37 while translating with 34 Cf. Yer. (ed. Krotoschin) Shab. 3c. (However the correct meaning of והיו הורנין is "they would have killed" (L]). 33 A.

They did not know where he took it from, until they found it in the elegies3' of Yannai.40 The Rabbanites did all they could to kill him, but God let them not get hold of him. 12] After Anan appeared Ismâ'il al-'Ukbari; this was at the time of (the caliph) al-Mu'tasim Billâh.41 Most of Ismâ'ïl's sayings resemble the ravings of a madman, and any judicious person who heard him laughed at him. Yet notwithstanding his ignorance he thought very much of himself, for he makes light of Anan and reduces him to nothing. It is said that when about to die he ordered his followers to write upon his tomb "The chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof."42 13] At the time of Ismâ'il al-'Ukbari lived also Benjamin al-Nahâwandï. He was also learned in the doctrines of the Rabbanites and strong in the Scripture. It is said that he was judge for many years. In much of what he said he struck upon the truth, but in some places (of his works) he did not pursue the (right method of) reasoning,43 rather deviated from it greatly. What he says indicates that he was strongly in favor of both following the (Holy) texts (literally) and deducing from the (Holy) text or (from) what proceeded (naturally) from reasoning by (building up) two premises and (deriving) a con elusion; (all of) which was (a method) intermediate between (pure) reasoning and (following) the (Holy) text (literally). We shall mention this method in the second part. 14] A younger contemporary of these men was Musâ al-Za'frânï, known as Abu 'Imrân al-Tiflïsî; he was (a native) 3« אלארמאני(!). 3' חזאנה ; the Moslem-Arabic does not know this meaning. 40 Yannai, one of the earliest payyetanim and the teacher of the great Eleazar ha-Qalir; he lived in the seventh century.

Some people accepted his teaching and they believe in it down to the present time.44 The followers of Ismà'ïl al-'Ukbarï say that Abu 'Imrân was a pupil of Ismà'ÏÏ's and received (instruction) from him. 15] 15] In Ramla lived Malik al-Ramlï. His followers are known down to the present time as Ramlites, or Malikians. 16] In 'Ukbara, after Ismâ'îl, lived Mishawayh al-'Ukbarl. He was very weak in speculation ; in addition to that, according to what is said about him, his mind was always wandering; we shall explain it later. His followers in 'Ukbara are known down to the present time by the name of Mishawayhites; there are no scholars or theologians among them. 17] The last one who professed a true doctrine and composed books and was followed by some people, was Daniel al-Dama ghânï, known as al-Qumisi. We have already spoken about him in the first chapter. These are the more generally known sects, as far as we could procure information about them. As for the Karaites of to-day who belong to sects other than those mentioned above, it is impossible to find two of them agreeing in everything; rather, one differs from the other in one thing, while the other differs from the former in another thing. We shall mention some of these (differences) later. Now we shall proceed to enumerate the differences of each sect.

We have already mentioned the account of the Scripture about that in which he differed, and we have shown that the people persisted in his practices at the time of the (Babylonian) exile and continued to hold on to them after they were scattered all over the world, and transmitted them one to another down to the present time. These are the licentious practices of the Rabbanites. We shall begin with their idea of the Creator. They attribute to Him (human) likeness and corporeality, and describe Him with most shameful descriptions ; (they assert) that He is composed of limbs and has a (definite) measure. They measure each limb of His in parasangs. This is to be found in a book entitled "Shi'ûr qômâh," meaning "The measure of the stature," i. e., the stature of the Creator. This, as well as other tales and acts, etc., mentioned by them in the Talmud and their other writings, does not suit (even) one of the (earthly) creatures, much less the Creator. We shall mention a great many things of this sort later. They say that the Torah which is in the hands of the people (of Israel) is not the one brought down by Moses, but is a new one composed by Ezra, for, according to them, the one brought down by Moses perished and was lost and forgotten.45 This (assertion) is (equivalent to) the abrogation of the entire faith. If the Moslems only knew about this assertion of theirs, they would not need any other thing to reproach us with and use as an argument against us. When occasionally some of the Moslem theologians attack us, saying: "The Torah which you have is not the one Moses had brought down," we declare them to be slanderers and liars, and we assert that they say this merely because they are pressed for an argument and have no other to produce. But if they only knew about this assertion of the Rab banites—may God forgive them (what they are saying)—they 45 This is wrong; it is maintained throughout the Jewish literature that the Pentateuch in its present form was given to Moses on Mount Sinai. As Harkavy points out, al-Qirqisânï's statement is rather a misinterpretation of the passage Suk. 20a: כשנשתכחה תורה מישראל עלה עזרא סבבל ויסדה חזרה ונשתכחה עלה הלל הבבלי ויסדה וכו'. Cf. also Sanh. 21b.</page><page sequence="16">332 LEON NEMOY [16] would be greatly relieved by it and would need nothing else (to use against us).46 For prayers (consisting of citations) from the book of Psalms they substitute some composed by themselves, contrary to what is enjoined in the Scripture [Ezra 3.10]: "To praise the Lord by the words of His servant David." Yet they say in the beginning of their prayer: "Who chose His servant David and graciously accepted his sacred hymns," etc.47 Thus they admit by this phrase that the praise and the exaltation and glorification of God must consist of (citations from) the sayings of David. Also, they do not perform it as it should be performed, but merely say it being seated, in the manner of mere reading aloud.48 We shall complete the argument about this matter in its (special) place. They forbid touching the ground with the face when bowing down (in prayer). This is contrary to the passage of the Scripture [2 Chron. 7.3]: "And they knelt with their faces to the earth and bowed to the ground."4' At the end of the prayer they bow to the right and to the left,50 imitating the way of the Christians; they say that this bowing is (intended) for the two angels in charge of each person, of which one stands to the person's right and the other to his left. More strange than this is that they bow first before these two (angels), and (only) afterwards they bow straight forward before the Creator. Aside from that, they entreat the angels to forward their prayer to the Creator so that they might let Him hear their entreaty and imploration. This (is contained) in their saying: "The bringers of mercv brought51 our (imploration for) mercv 46 Apparently, al-Qirqisànï means to say that by making such statements the Rabbanites furnish the Moslem theologians with a powerful weapon for use against the Jews. 47 אשר בחר בדוד עבדו ורצה בשירי קדשו. Probably a phrase in the prayer-book of some local rite in al-Qirqisânï's time; the prayerbook now in general use does not contain this phrase. 48 עלי נהה אלקראה ואלדכר; does he mean that prayers should always be chanted? 49 Cf. Meg. 22b, Ber. 34a. The reason for this prohibition may have been the fear lest there be a mosaic image on the floor and it would seem that the worshipper bowed to it [L], 5° Cf. Yoma 53b [L], 51 The correct translation is "Ye bringers of mercy O bring, etc." [L].</page><page sequence="17">[17] AL-QIRQISÂNÏ'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 333 before the Lord of mercy."sa They interpret accordingly the saying of Solomon [Eccl. 10.20]: "Even in thy thought do not curse the king,"—they say that the Creator is meant by it,53 and that the passage [ibid., ibid.]: "Because even a bird may carry the word" means the angels,34 of whom it is said that they have [Isa. 6.2]: "Six wings everyone," and that the Creator obtains His information33 (about all that happens in the world) in such a way. But our God is exalted far above this, as He has described Himself in His own words [Jer. 32.27]: "Behold, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh; can anything be unknown to Me?"; (compare) also the saying of His prophet [ibid., 32.17]: "Nothing is unknown to Thee!" It is He of whom it is said [Dan. 2.22]: "He hath revealed the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness." Is it necessary, in the presence of this descrip tion of Him, that any word or speech should be forwarded to Him? They allow a person to ask from another a jar of wine or a jar of oil on the Sabbath. This is contained in their saying:36 "It is allowed to ask from one another jars of wine or oil, only without saying 'Lend me;' likewise, for women to ask one from the other loaves of bread. If one does not trust the other, the other may leave his cloak (as security) and settle the account after the Sabbath." But this means selling and buying on the Sabbath, only by means of a subterfuge, as it is said [Jer. 9.5]: "Fraudulently, they refused to acknowledge Me, saith Yahweh." Also what they say about "mingling"37 is known and familiar to everybody. They allow the writing of a letter or two on the Sabbath, provided that it does not make out a complete name or word; e. g., if one would write דן, meaning the name Dan, it would be unlawful, since this is a complete name; but if he would write n, s2 In the selihah of Eleazar ha-Qalir, cited in Zunz's Synagogale Poesie, p. 148. 53 Cf.

First, the excitement and the exhaustion which is contrary to [Ex. 20.10]: "Thou shalt not do any work." Second, the contrac tion of impurity, which is contrary to the holiness to be preserved during the Sabbath. Third, the ejaculation of the sperm, which is contrary to the passage [ibid., 34.21]: "Thou shalt rest from ploughing and harvesting."62 They permit these things, although it is clear and evident that they should be prohibited, but prohibit other things for which (common) sense63 gives evidence contrary to what they say about it. Thus, (they say) that nobody should prostrate himself on the Sabbath, lest he should ask some favor of the Lord. But there is no prayer which they or others pray in which there is no request for favors. And on what (Scriptural) authority should it be allowed to ask a favor of the Lord standing or sitting, and not allowed to ask for it being prostrated? If one is allowed to say in his prayer: "Remember Thy mercy and suppress Thine anger, and abolish pestilence and wrath and the sword from among us and from among all the children of Thy covenant," which is a prayer both for his personal and for common needs, why should he not be permitted to ask his Lord for a particular need of his own? .בעץ 38 59 Shab. 12.3; the Gemara, ff. 103-105 undertakes a long discussion about this question. 60 Cf. Shab. 13.1.—(In both cases Qirqisânl confuses פטור with מותר. The rabbis do not allow it. They merely say that one is not subject to punishment for it. There are many instances in the sabbath laws which are פטור ולא מותר IL]).IL]). 61 Ket. 62. 62 This objection is wholly based on the Arab usage of חרת (literally : plough ing) as a regular technical term for cohabitation.—(Cf. ibn Ezra ad 10c.

What fool66 will ever believe such a thing?! Also, they forbid a person to carry his spittle in his mouth for four cubits (of way).67 I would like to know what about urine and faeces! Is there any custom more foolish than this?! It is strange that they forbid us to put straw in a sieve on the Sabbath lest crumbs of the straw should fall through the sieve so that it would be as if one has been sifting on the Sab bath.68 But they allow us to bring in a litter, if a plank in the roof of a house has been broken on the Sabbath, and to place the litter under this plank to support it.6' Is there a greater contradiction than prohibiting an involuntary thing and allowing one that is manifestly voluntary? They allow cooking on the Sabbath, provided that the pot (with the food) is prepared before the Sabbath and placed in the oven, so that (the food) is cooked and eaten on the Sabbath.70 They require the circumcision of the dead, which is extremely abhorrent to reason.71 .אלהלכה *6 65 The Mishnah ('Ab. Zarah 3.6) speaks here only of trees which are planted by Gentiles in order to make from them asherah's; any general prohibition of every seed of Gentiles, like wheat and rye, is not found here at all.—(Qirqisânï apparently mistook עכו"ם which stands for עבודת כוכבים ומזלות for עובדי כוכבים ומזלות IL]). 6666 Literally, blind-hearted person (עמי אלקלב). 67 Nothing of this sort is found in the Talmud, though it may very well be some local custom. 68 Shab. 20.3. 6» Shab. 23.5. 70 There has been a great controversy between the schools of Shammai and HillelHillel in this matter; cf. Shab. 36b ff. 71 Cf. Tur Yôreh Dê'âh 263 ; circumcision is required only in case of a child who died before reaching the age of eight days.</page><page sequence="20">336 LEON NEMOY [20] They assert that the laws of uncleanliness are no longer binding upon all who are living in exile ; this is contained in their saying: "Since the day when the Temple was destroyed there is neither uncleanliness nor cleanliness." They assert that no un cleanliness can be contracted from a leprous person, and that no purification is necessary after contact with a dead body. In such a way they deny all impurities, because if there is no purification (necessary even) after contact with a dead body, which is the most impure object, then, according to their way of thinking, all of the people are impure at the present time. They pay no attention to any other impure things that they draw near to or touch, because if they do not admit of the possibility of purifica tion from the major impurity, much more so in case of the minor impurities. Nevertheless, they are in constant contact with holy texts and sacred objects, although this is unlawful according to their own laws. As a matter of fact, they have spoken about this question in reply to the above accusation. Namely, they say that they have permitted impure persons to approach holy texts because holy texts are (often) written on impure leather taken from animals slaughtered by Gentiles. But it has been said to them: "Wherefore, then, did you allow holy texts to be written on (leather taken from) animals slaughtered by Gentiles, inas much as by such a permission you cause impure and holy to be mixed together?" They replied that they did it only with the purpose of multiplying72 holy texts among the people; and that if they would allow holy texts to be written on (leather taken from) animals slaughtered by Jews only, there would be hardly found a holy text or a scroll of the Torah, so that reading (of the Torah) would become rare and scarce among the people. Dost thou not perceive this evident lie, inasmuch as we know that in a single city one could find enough leather from animals slaughtered by Jews for all the holy texts and scrolls in the world? It has even been said to them: "Is it not true that among the holy texts there are some that are written on leather taken from animals slaughtered by Jews? Why, then, do you treat them all גל Or: on account of the great number of holy texts in the hands of the people; תכתר can have either an active or a passive meaning.</page><page sequence="21">[21] AL-QIRQISÂNÏ's ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 337 alike; and why do you not distinguish the one class from the other, and keep away from the clean, since you have not been keeping away from the unclean?" By disregarding the impurity contracted through contact with a dead body on the supposition that no purification from it is possible at the present time they have fallen into contradiction with themselves also from another aspect. Namely, they forbid the priests to approach the dead and to carry the [biers]73 . . . into the tombs ... no impurity and no . . . all the (other) people . . .74 yet (immediately after this) they pray and read in the scrolls (of the Torah) and holy texts, without being deterred from it by (the thought of) the impurity which they have just contracted. Yet what about the special care which is prescribed for the priests in regard to this prohibition? And why should it be necessary (to think) that they must abstain from approaching graves, but not from approaching their dead? If they adduce as an excuse the passage [Lev. 21.2]: "But for his kin," the reply should be (as follows) : This permission was given at a time when purification was possible; why, then, did you allow that at the present time, when no purification is possible? Another strange thing is that they assert that a dead body of a Gentile does not inflict impurity ;7s but this contradicts the statement of the Scripture that the children of Israel were ordered to purify themselves from the impurity of the people of Midian; as it is said [Num. 31.19]: "And do ye abide without the camp seven days." They adduce as a reason for this assertion the saying of the Scripture [ibid., 19.14]: "When a man dieth in a tent;" they say: " 'man' means only a Jew, for it is said [Ezek. נ' The letters preserved read : אלננא. Harkavy suggests אלנגאסאת, impurities, but this would hardly make good sense. I think it is fairly certain that the word is אלננאזאת, biers, coffins. 74 As the context shows, the lacuna contained the statement that priests used to attend the funerals of their relatives, but did not go farther than a certain distance from the tombs. 75 At any rate, this view is quoted as a personal opinion of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai (Yeb. 61a beginning); legal power is not given to it; besides, not dead bodies, but graves of Gentiles (קברי גויס) are spoken of.</page><page sequence="22">338 LEON NEMOY [221 34.31]: "And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men!" Is there any stupidity and foolishness76 greater than this?! Likewise, they say that a person cannot become unclean by coming in contact with a broken bone of a dead man, for it is said [Num. 19.16]: "Or a bone of a man." Woe to him who said so! Look (at him)! He does not know that a part of a bone is bone, even if it is only a splinter from it, just as the smallest particle of flesh is flesh. They say: "A menstruating woman may take care of all the needs of the household;"77 and they say in the Talmud: "Every work that a wife does for her husband (at other times), she may do while menstruating,"78 i. e., everything a woman is allowed to do for her husband (at other times) she is also allowed to do while she has her menses, as cooking and baking, approaching clothes and vessels, etc. Then they made an exception for three things which they do not allow her to do, namely, she must not prepare his bed, nor light his lamp, nor fill his glass.79 Thus, they allow her to cook and bake what he will eat, but do not allow her to light his lamp, in which there is no harm or advantage or impurity to affect a man.80 They say with regard to the "Seven which are pure"81 such things as God had never commanded. In the question of suppuration82 they hold the extremely faulty opinion that only the priest can decide in this matter and that a woman having noticed blood, must bring it to him to decide whether it is blood of menses or blood of suppuration.83 6י Literally: blindness of heart. " Nid. 10.7. 8י Ket. 4b beginning.

They say that a suppurating person is not positively suppurating until the pus has been seen (at least) three times,85 which was never ordered by God. Likewise, if the impure is mixed with sixty times as much of pure, the pure (according to them) does not become impure and is not to be forbidden. Thus, according to them, if a dead mouse or (a piece of) swine-flesh falls into vinegar or wine of a sixty times larger volume and then is taken out and destroyed, the eating and drinking of that into which it has fallen is not for bidden. On the authority of this saying they eat things decidedly forbidden. Likewise, (in case of) worms found in fruits, meat and fish, or flies found in vegetables, or similar cases, they allow us (to eat these foods). This is as disgraceful as the above, or even more so. They allow (the eating of) the fat-tail, although it is defined (in the Scripture) as tallow; also the kidney and the caudate lobe of the liver.86 The same applies to their permission of the (eating of the) foetus87 and their saying that even if it has been ploughing in the field for five years, the slaughtering of its mother makes it clean.88 According to them, if a sheep or a cow was slaughtered at the time of giving birth, then her belly was cut open and her offspring was taken out of it (alive) and continued to live(even) for a period of five years, this offspring may be freely eaten without being slaughtered (in the prescribed fashion). In such a way they permit seven forbidden things: first, the dead; second, the blood; third, the fat; fourth, the member of the live 81 Read סקים. 8s Zab. 1.1. 86 זיאדה אלכבד; cf.

Even if the slaughtering of its mother had made it clean and allowable for food, it necessarily follows that the death of its mother must have made it impure and forbidden. They themselves say a thing which necessarily makes obliga tory upon them what we have just said. Namely, they say that if the foetus extended its front or hind paw out of the womb before the slaughtering of its mother and died during the slaught ering of its mother, the outstretched limb is forbidden, i. e., it must be cut away, but all that which is inside (the womb) is permitted and may be eaten, after the projecting limb has been cut away.91 Thus, they permit all this, but forbid things which God did not forbid and which are not listed (as forbidden in the Script ures). Such are their regulations concerning forbidden animals that are recognized by means of an examination of the lungs; also their rules for slaughtering (listed) in the "Rules for slaught ering," which are (as follows): delay, pressing, digging, slipping, and tearing.92 Thus, they completely contradict (the saying of the Scripture) [Deut. 13.1]: "Thou shalt not add thereto nor diminish from it." The same applies to their affirmations concerning the purity of meat which is declared to be impure by the Scripture,93 e. g., in case of wholesale sacrifices at times like when, as the Scripture 8י Al-Qirqisànï possibly has in mind a case when the cow was slaughtered by a Gentile; according to the Mishnah, the young, if it is subsequently slaughtered according to ritual, is כשר, although its mother is "carcass." According to Shulhân 'Aruk, Yôreh Dê'âh, 13, the young must be at least 9 months old and alive at the time the mother was slaughtered. י° Sic !

Another strange thing is that they forbid throwing meat into a pot with cold water, and insist that the water must first be made to boil, because, they say, if the meat is thrown into cold water and then the whole is boiled, the blood dissolves in the water and is subsequently consumed ; but if the water is made to boil first and then the meat is thrown in, the blood does not dissolve in the water.96 This saying of theirs indicates that the eating of the blood in the meat itself is allowed, but in the gravy it is forbidden ! The same applies to their prohibition of cooking the liver and the spleen, although they allow eating them raw. Likewise, they think that it is lawful to broil or cook an uncut fish with its blood and eat it; but if the blood leaks out of it, although no incision was made in the body of the fish, the blood is forbidden to be eaten.97 Also, they allow the eating of floating dead fish, although it is defined (in the Scripture) as "carcass;" they even say that if a dead, unclean fish is caught and a (young, living, and) clean fish is found in its belly, the clean fish is allowed to be eaten. They permit this, although they forbid (consuming) meat (cooked) in milk.98 They say that the bones and the hide of the "carcass" and of that which is "torn in the field" are not forbidden to be eaten (and used respectively), and that only the eating of the flesh is .עקל עאקל 99 95 The translation of this phrase is rather free, since the Arabic can hardly be rendered literally. 96 Cf. Tûr Yôreh Dë'âh, 69; Maimonides accepts this opinion as a law, but the other authorities reject it. 97 There is no direct prohibition. 98 The meaning of this juxtaposition is, probably, that the blood of the young unborn fish is theoretically a portion of its mother's blood; therefore, the case of this young fish cooked with its blood is exactly alike to the case of the kid cooked in its mother's milk.</page><page sequence="26">342 LEON NEMOY [26] forbidden, since it is said [Ex. 22.30]: "Neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn in the field."99 But then it would be incumbent upon them to permit the eating of the bones and (the use of) the hide of the swine, since the Scripture has forbidden only the eating of its flesh. The same would apply to the fat, the liver, the spleen, the lungs, and the marrow (of the swine), since all these (parts) are not flesh, while only flesh has been forbidden as food. Now if all these (parts) should be forbidden by the analogy of the flesh, then the hide and the bones should also be forbidden by the same analogy. Likewise, in regard to the Scriptural saying [Deut. 16.4]: "Neither shall there any thing of the flesh which thou sacrificest the first day at even remain all night, etc.", they should allow the above-mentioned things100 to remain until the morning, since they are not flesh, while only what is left of the flesh is forbidden to remain. The same (in the case of) all the peace offerings; also, in regard to the passage [Lev. 6.20]: "Every one that toucheth its meat shall be holy,"—consequently, who ever touches these things101 should not be subject to (the com mand) "he shall be holy." They contradict the clear statement of the Scripture that the feast of Pentecost must fall on Sunday and not on any other day of the week, while they fix it on other days (as well). They admit that the beginning of months should be fixed by the appearance of the new moon, but they contradict themselves by adopting the intercalation based on "Not on the second, fourth, or sixth,"102 which has no foundation whatever. It is the system invented by Isaac Nafha; the president of the academy Hai mentions it in one of his books. People explain this (system of) intercalation and the reason for (the rule) "Not on the second, fourth, or sixth" in two ways: some say that they introduced it in order that the feast of the willow-procession103 midit not »Hub 9.1. 100 i. e., bones and hide. 101 i. e., bones and hide. 102 A chronological formula, meaning that the first day of Passover must not fall on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday.

Others say that they did it in order that the day of atonement might not fall on a Friday or a Sunday,104 so that if a man should die on a Friday, the day of Atonement, and Sabbath should be the next day, or if he should die on a Sabbath and the day of Atonement should be next, the dead body would have to remain over two days and two nights and would become fetid. They say that [Num. 33.3] "The morrow after the Passover" on which the children of Israel departed from Egypt was the sixteenth of Nisan, contrary to the statement of the Scripture [ibid., ibid.]: "And they departed from Ramses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the Passover the children of Israel went out, etc." Also, they say that the remnant of the Passover must be burned on the sixteenth of Nisan,105 contrary to the passage [Ex. 12.10]: "And that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire." To their inconsistencies belongs also their assertion that whosoever has in his house uncircumcised persons is not allowed to partake of the Passover ;106 and yet they say that the children of Israel were offering the Passover in the desert for forty years, although their houses were full of uncircumcised persons, namely those born in the desert; for it is said [Jos. 5.7]: "For they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way." They permit leavened bread to be brought during the seven days of Passover into the house of a Jew provided that it107 does not belong to him; i. e., if there is in his house a man not from the people of the (Jewish) faith, this man is allowed to bring 4" Cf. R. H. 20a. 10s Pes. 7.10; if the 16th falls on a Sabbath the remnant is to be burned on the morning of the 17th. 106 Cf.

But in this assertion there are two faults: first, it contradicts the Scriptural passage [Ex. 12.19]: "There shall be no leaven found in your houses;" secondly, they con tradict themselves, for they forbid us to possess leaven deposited in the houses of others,10' notwithstanding the expression of the Scripture: "In your houses." Now if the expression "with thee" means that it is forbidden "with thee" and not with someone else, then, analogously, the expression "In your houses" should be understood as forbidding only what is in our houses, not in houses of others. They acknowledge the (custom of) searching for the young ears and fixing (the date of) Passover according to it, but they contradict it by adopting■ a (fixed system of) intercalation. I shall quote later some passages from their own books proving the sacredness of (the custom of searching for) the young ears, namely in the seventh part in which we shall deal with the begin ning of the months and with (the custom of searching for) the young ears. They explicitly contradict the holy text in the case of an ox certified to have killed a man, in which the Scripture prescribes that his owner also should be put to death; (as it is said) [Ex. 21.29]: "The ox shall be stoned and his owner also shall be put to death."

Also, they introduced an unknown prayer, called the Ne'ilah prayer, which they recite at the close of the day (of Atonement).

Then they contradict themselves by saying in the Mishnah that leprosy cannot be discerned at daybreak, at noon, or at twilight, but only during the seventh, eighth, and ninth hour; but this means that these hours do not belong to the twilight time, yet at the same time they say that it extends from noontime until the approach of the evening! They do not permit (reciting) two or three Mussaf prayers on the same day, e. g., on the New Year's day falling on a Sab bath; three Mussaf prayers are necessary in such a case: the Mussaf of the Sabbath, the Mussaf of the first of the new month, and the Mussaf of the New Year's day. They allow (reciting) only one prayer, and they mention in it all the three festivals112 together. But if this should be allowed, then it should also be allowable to mention these (three festivals) in the Tamid prayer, and then there would be no need for any other prayer."3 Yet they reject these necessary prayers and introduce (instead) a superfluous prayer, called Minhâh. The Scripture says [Lev. 23.40]: "And ye shall take you on the first day," and commands to take material for the building of the booth,"4 as it is explained and described in (the book of) Ezra.115 But they say that this refers only to the Hôsha'anôt,"6 and that "taking" means only taking by hand."7 The Scripture commands to make "a holy convocation" one day on every festival, but they make it two days.

I should like to know what is the difference between a minor and an adult (daughter) as far as inheritance is concerned?! Is not this law nothing but [Hab. 1.4] "perverted judgment." The people of Syria prescribe depucelation120 by means of a finger. Those who undertake to argue in favor of this (custom) say that it serves to prevent a man from committing a sin, inasmuch as he cannot know whether the woman he desires to beget children with is pure and clean or has been defiled; for if she has been defiled, and he has intercourse with her, the co habitation is unlawful; but if he proves her by the means of a finger to be clean he is safe from sin. It should be said to him who adduces these reasons: Now if this is necessary, pray tell us, does this not make it incumbent upon every man, whenever wishing to cohabit with his wife, to examine her by "the water of the untrue one," since he cannot be sure that she has not been defiled (since the last cohabitation with him)? But then all the Israelites will either have to bring their wives every day to the examination-chamber (?)12I (of the courthouse) and cohabit with them only after (their innocence has been established), or they will have to watch them day and night. Nay, what we say is more sensible and binding than what they say and prescribe; namely (we say) that a man who desires to beget children with a woman should ascertain her purity or impurity at the first cohabitation before the close of it; then, if he should believe that the matter is wrong, he will be able to prevent (the completion "י Ket. 8.6-8. 120 The assimilation of a fatha to the preceding and following kesra is quite the rule in Judaeo-Arabic of any period; it is also widely practiced in the modern Moslem Arabic vernaculars. 121 Literally, furnace (אלכור)[!?].</page><page sequence="31">[31] AL-QIRQISÂNÏ'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 347 of) the cohabitation.122 As for a man who wishes to have inter course with his wife, with whom he has cohabited previously, (and doubts her faithfulness), he has no other way of ascertaining her purity than the one just mentioned.123 Is not their opinion in this matter most short-sighted?124 We dealt here with the refutation of this opinion because we do not wish to deal with it in another place, as it is not included in the laws.125 This applies also to all other things of this sort which we have refuted here; we have done so because we will not mention them in any other place (of this work). As for such things as require detailed discussion and are not included in the laws,126 we will postpone the examination of them till the second and the third part where we will deal with each one of them in its own place. Some of them say about the penûyâh, i. e., the unmarried woman, that if men have secluded themselves with her she may marry them; others do not allow her to marry them, meaning (close) relatives ; if one of them went in unto her and she brought forth a child, the child is considered a bastard, provided that she herself says that the child comes from forbidden relatives. . . .

Now if God Himself says [Psalms 89.35]: "My covenant will I not break," could anyone else be allowed to do this? And if it is said [Zech. 5.4]: "I will bring it127 forth, saith the Lord," etc., will anybody doubt that a person disobeying it is as sinful as a person renouncing God? 122 1. e., the conception. 123 i. e., by the "water of the untrue one."

Yet if they would make a thorough study of them they would no longer need to employ speculation and dialectics to refute the Rabbanites.129 Only of late have some of them begun to study this, and these absurdities and contradictions became evident to them. They say that one who has just consummated marriage is not allowed to repeat the cohabitation until the expiration of seven days, lest together with the blood of virginity there should also appear the blood of menses, so that he would have cohabited with a menstruating woman. It was said to them regarding this: If this is so, then everything she comes near to during these seven days should be considered unclean, since we cannot determine whether she is menstruating or not; namely, everything subject to doubt should be treated in the most rigorous way. Likewise, they should require that everyone who came near his130 bed should bathe himself and wash his clothes. In general, they should require that the bridegroom should be treated during these seven days in the same manner as the bride, on account of the passage [Lev. 15.24]: "And if any man lie with her and her impurity be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days. י ' Y et they do not require this, but contradict themselves. The same applies to their permission of (marrying) the daughter of the brother and the daughter of the sister, although there is no difference between them and the paternal and ma temal aunts, since (people with sound) minds do not make any distinction between the paternal uncle and the paternal aunt or between the maternal uncle and the maternal aunt; that is, the relation of the paternal uncle to the daughter of his brother is the same as the relation of the paternal aunt to the son of her brother.'31 The same applies to the maternal uncle and aunt. Also, they allow a man and his son to marry a woman and her "8 Read אקאוילהם.

What is more strange than a person pronouncing a blessing over the Sabbath-eve lamp and saying in the blessing that God commanded it? Likewise, over the lamp of Hanukkah. Another strange thing is their opinion about pittûm ha Ketôret,Ketôret, i. e., the mixture of incense,133 which consists, according to the Scripture, of four things, namely rosin, acanthus, gal banum, and incense. But they add to that several other things, namely, balsam, musk, sandal-oil, and caper-syrup. Again, the Scripture says that it should be composed of an even number of ingredients, but they make it sometimes of seven,134 sometimes of nine, and sometimes of three. Even more mistaken is their opinion that urine is very good for it, but since it could not be brought into the Temple they substituted for it caper-syrup. But their assertion that urine is very good for it, because God had first ordered it, although they135 subsequently substituted for it (caper-syrup), cannot possibly be true; for had it been ordered (in the first place) no substitution would have been lawful in any case. And if the Creator did not order it, then what is the idea of mentioning it and what reason is there to believe such a thing? Is not this idea (foolish) to the utmost degree?136 Dost thou not see what is better for it, urine or amber gris and camphor? Is there any limit left for them who say137 such shameful and foul things? May God protect us against such foolish and utterly stupid people! They have so many other shameful and obviously wicked customs that it would take too long to describe them. I am not going to list all of them, as I wish to shorten (my account), since my aim is to deal with strictly Scriptural laws (only).

Now, in the following chapter I will quote some of their sayings concerning matters other than law, such as aim to abrogate the entire faith and to affirm heresy and apostasy, for in this also there is a warning against their (corrupt) ways and a refutation of their claim to be recipients from (men of) prophecy. Chapter IV ACCOUNT OF THESE THINGS We have already mentioned at the beginning of the preceding chapter what they say about the corporeality and human form (of God); also what they say in (the book entitled) "Measure of the stature (of God)" about the measurements and the dimensions (of God) from the toes to the head. They say, moreover, that (the archangel) Michael places phylacteries on His head every day, and that His height from the sole of His foot up to His entire stature comprises 236,000 parasangs. This contradicts the saying of the Scripture [Job 11.7]: "Canst thou by searching find out God?" and the saying [Isa. 40.18]: "To whom then will ye liken God?!" They say in (the book entitled) "Alphabet of [Rabbi] Akiba" that the Creator said: "I have taken Enoch son of Jared and raised his high rank above you all among those high of rank;138 I have made his throne seventy thousand parasangs higher than My throne, and I have made his dignity greater than Mine."

They say also that the Creator sits upon His throne, while he141 stands upon his feet; nevertheless he142 cannot tie the phylacteries143 unless he stretches himself and lifts his foot. They say in the Talmud144 that the Creator prays, referring to the passage [Isa. 56.7]: "I will make them joyful in My house of prayer," and that His prayer is as follows: "May it please Me that My mercy should overcome My anger so that I may deal leniently145 with My creatures." May He be blessed to whom prayers and glorifications are directed, and may He be elevated and exalted, our God, our Creator, above (all) that which dirty heretics ascribe to Him!

The Scripture says that on the day when the Temple was destroyed mourning, weeping, and similar actions were prescribed on account of the disobedience (of Israel) ; as it is said [Isa. 22.11]: "But ye have not looked unto the Maker thereof," etc., (and) [ibid., 22.12]: "And in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping and to mourning," etc. But they say in the (books entitled) "Order of the Gehenna"151 and "Repentance (?) of Ahab"152 that this mourning, weeping, plucking out153 of the hair, and coarse clothing134 were instituted by the Creator for Himself only. Will God ever make Himself truly known to people who assert that he weeps and mourns and covers Himself with hair cloth?155 They say in the Talmud156 that God has a place called "Secret places," where He weeps; as it is said [Jer. 13.17]: "My soul shall weep in secret places." They say in the same passage that He says: "Woe unto Me, for157 I have destroyed My house and exiled My people." They say that the angels weep with Arabic meaning of נמאן־ ("nonsense").

They say that He plucked out some of His hair with His own hands, and that up to this day no one has been allowed to see Him.158 All this contradicts the saying of the Scripture [Job 26.14]: "How little a portion is heard of Him!" They say in the Talmud159 that when the children of Israel neglected the (holy) laws the enemy of the Creator became destitute. They use the expression "His enemy" as a metaphor for the Creator Himself; it is the same as if a man, asked about (the health of) his child, would say "his enemy is sick," lest he should mention sickness in connection with his child. They refer to the passage [Eccl. 10.18] : "By much slothfulness the building160 decayeth;" they say that "building" means God, as it is said [Psalms 104.3]: "Who layeth the beams161 of His chambers in the waters." They say in their Aggadah, which is known as "The Talmud of the children of Rabbi"162 that the Creator learned from Moses three things. The first (appears) from the story of the (golden) calf, when He wished to destroy the children of Israel; as it is said [Ex. 32.10]: "Now let Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them and that I may consume them." Moses, however, said to Him [Num. 14.13]: "Then the Egyptians shall hear it, for Thou broughtest up this people in Thy might," etc., (and they shall say) [ibid., ibid.]: "Because the Lord was not able." Thus the Creator was reminded of this (circumstance), and He said to him: "Thou hast revived Me with thy speech:" they infer it from the passage [ibid., 14.21]: "As truly as I live." 158 i. e., to disturb His solitude? The text has לים תתקדר מערפתה literally, "knowledge of Him has not been made possible (?)"; the phrase is not clear to me, and the interpretation I have given above is no more than a conjecture. 159 Ta'an. 7b. .הקןזקךה המקרה "י י". !6תלטוך בנ, רב, נ ; Harkavy's suggestion that this is the Palestinian Talmud is probably wrong, as such a story, at least as it is quoted here, is not found there; some similar stories are found in the Midrashic literature.

Thus, the Creator learned this (wise and cautious policy) from him and applied it thereafter (in the Torah); as it is said [ibid., 20.10]: "When thou comest nigh unto a city," etc. I think this story is from the Talmud. Are there any other stupid and low things left that they do not attribute to the Wisest of the wise who [Dan. 2.21] "Giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them who know under standing," who granteth power to every mighty one, of whom it is said [Psalms 37.23]: "The steps of man are ordered by the Lord;" [ibid., 147.5]: "Great is our Lord and of great power;" [ibid., 147.10]: "He delighteth not in the strength of the horse." What a multitude of sayings of theirs of this sort one might be able to enumerate! But I have limited myself to the enumeration of the above few in order to make clear their impiety and heresy, as well as the insolence of those of them who consider themselves men of tradition and defenders of God('s true faith) inasmuch as (they think that) they are recipients from (men endowed by God with) prophecy. It will be sufficient for thee (to learn) what they say in the Talmud about Eliezer ben Hyrcanus:163 A com pany of scholars was debating the question as to what vessels become impure by coming near to an oven made of single pieces (of stone) and rings in such a way that the rings are laid one upon another, and between every two pieces there is a lump of clay, and between every two lumps of clay there is a gap; the question was, does such an oven cause impurity or not? All the scholars decided that it must cause impurity, but Eliezer did not think so. Whatever arguments he adduced they did not accept, until he had to perform miracles to prove (the correctness of) his opinion. In the first miracle the water that was running downwards turned back and ran upwards, but they did not 1גי B. M. 59a end and 59b.</page><page sequence="39">[39] AL-QIRQISÂNÏ's ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 355 accept it. In the second miracle a carob-tree moved several cubits from its place, but they did not accept that either. In the third miracle the walls of the college164 building inclined, but they did not accept even this. When he saw this (obstinacy) on their part he called upon the heavens to bear witness in his behalf, and a heavenly voice,165—they mean by this the voice of the Creator—, resounded and said: "What have ye to do with Eliezer, the truth is with him!" Thereupon Joshua ben Hanan iah166 stood up and beckoned to heaven . . . . . . [Cant. 7.6]: "The king is held in the curls (?)."167 Eliezer168 used this word in that sense in the elegy which they recite on the day of Atonement in (the prayer beginning with) "Thine is the earth and its inhabitants." This is evidenced by his expression: "And the exalted hand held in the curl(?)."16' Perhaps ,the expression used by him and by the Jews "The hand of God is manacled"170 (originated in this way) : this verse occurred to his mind and he derived therefrom his expression. What is more shameful than their saying in the Talmud:171 "Whosoever is overcome by passion let him put on black clothes and cover (his face) with black cloth and let him go to a place where he is unknown, and let him satisfy there his desire, lest he should profane the name of Heaven publicly." By this saying they allow lewdness and adultery if one has only put on black (clothes) and gone to a place where he is unknown ! They say in the Talmud17' that Metatron is the "little Lord" and that his name is like the name of his Master.173 Before him is an altar, the spirits of the righteous dwell near him and the souls of the scholars of the Talmud are sitting around him, while 16« Read אלמדרסה (Bâcher). 16s בת קול. 166 The text has erroneously : ben Levi. .ברהטים י16 168 ha-Qalir? 14רהט י, Eliezer apparently interpreted the word as meaning "chain."

(At one time) they continued to study until they disagreed over the passage of the Scripture [Lev. 13.4]: "If the bright spot be white." They said that it is clean,174 whereas the Creator said that it is unclean, but these souls around Him did not agree with Him. So He sent an angel to fetch the soul of Rabba ben Nahmani, as this Rabba was a learned and eloquent man. The angel, however, was not able to take his soul, for he heard him studying the Talmud; so he returned to his Sender and told Him the matter. The Sender said to him: "Appear before him unawares and set the trees around him in motion by means of a stormy wind, and as soon as he pauses take his soul." He did so, and his175 soul ascended (to heaven) calling "clean, clean," thus nullifying the Creator('s decision) and supporting (that of) His opponents. Then the Creator said: "They have prevailed over Me." This resembles the story of Eliezer ben Hyrcanus which we have quoted above, (especially) the Creator's words: "My children have prevailed over Me;" it contains just as many shameful and insolent things as that (story), or even more. They say that out of consideration for the soul of this Ben Nahmani176 his body was not left for the dogs, but a leaflet was thrown down from heaven to the college of Sura (?)177 in which there was written that Rabba ben Nahmani had been called away to direct the heavenly college. (The students) went around in the brushwood and thickets and in (other places covered with) vegetation until they [saw]178 birds and beasts of prey (watching) over his body. They lifted it up and went with it (to the burying place) and mourned for three days. But when they wanted to depart another leaflet fell down from the clouds in which there was written: "Whosoever will depart shall be anathematized;" so they resumed the mourn ing for seven days more ; then a third leaflet fell down (reading) : "Depart in peace," and they left him and went away.

Then he181 began to reprove the Creator saying: "Thou hast created Ben Nahmani and Thou hast taken his soul; wherefore, then, desirest Thou to destroy the world?" Thereupon the wind ceased. Thus, in the beginning of (this) story we are told that Ben Nahmani declared the Creator's opinion to be wrong and void, and that the Creator admitted that He was silenced by him and agreed that Ben Nahmani's opinion is the right one and His, i. e., the Creator's, the wrong one. In the latter part of the story we are told that the Bedouin quarreled with the Creator and reproached Him for wishing to do an unjust thing, and that the Creator desisted from doing what He wished to do! They say that the Creator observed a seven days' mourning for Methuselah; for it is said [Gen. 7.10]: "And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood," etc. They say182 that a man (of the heretics) asked Rabbi Ab bahu183 (a question) saying: "Your God is a priest, since he said [Ex. 25.2]: 'They shall bring Me a tax;' if so, where did he submerge for ablution after He had buried Moses? If thou sayest that He washed Himself in water, then is it not said [Isa. 40.12]: 'Who had measured the water in the hollow of His hand?' Therefore the water (of the entire universe) would not cover Him up."184 Rabbi Abbahu replied: "He submerged in fire,"185—they infer it from the passage [ibid., 66.15]: "For the Lord will come with fire,"—"and this is (a kind of purification) allowed by the Torah, as it is said [Num. 31.23]: "Every thing 1'י i. e., Rabba ben Nahmani? 180 i. e., his body? 181 i. e., the Arab. 18j Sanh. 39a. 183 The text has erroneously "Rabba." 181' And ablution requires complete submersion. 185 Qirqisànï, perhaps purposely, ignores the most important sentence in Abbahu's answer.

They surpass in nonsense and lying even the Christians. As a matter of fact the Christians rely in many of their doctrines upon nonsense and insolence, since persons who acknowledge and admit the truth of the Jewish religion never profess these doctrines. Therefore, when it became evident to them186 that in their187 translation of our (holy) books many changes and alterations have been introduced, their insolence prompted them to assert that the Syriac (!)188 language is the earliest one. This is asserted on the authority of Cyprian189 and others of his kind. But many of them argue that no changes or alterations have been introduced in the translation because the king Ptolemy190 gathered seventy Jewish elders, placed every two of them in a separate room and commanded them to translate for him the twenty four books (of the Old Testament). After they had done so he collected the translations (of each pair), but found no differences between them. This is what they call "The translation191 of the seventy." The Rabbanites confirm192 their193 story about it and call the king who sponsored it Talmai; only they say that the Creator instructed all of them to write the same, and that they (purposely) altered only ten passages and translated them not as the literal translation should be. Namely, (they translated) : "God created in the beginning;"194 "I will make man in an image and in a likeness;"195 "Male and female created He them;"196 "And God finished on the sixth day and rested on the seventh;"197 "In their selfwill they destroyed a feeding trough;"198 "And Moses took his 186 i. e., the Christians. ז" Read להם. !88 אלסריאני!

Now here is one of the arguments that should be adduced against the partisans of anthropomorphism:204 if it had been the Creator who did it because the passages he caused to be altered were of a misleading205 appearance and because He knew that this king would loathe these passages, if they should be translated for him literally, and would calumniate their (divine) author, then He would necessarily have changed all passages of this kind. For instance, if He had changed (the passage) [Gen. 1.26]: "In Our image and after Our likeness," because it implies anthropo morphism, then He would necessarily have changed everything similar to this, e. g., [Gen. 9.6]: "For in the image of God made He man;" also [ibid., 5.1]: "In the likeness of God made He him." Yet they do not assert that they206 changed these (passages, too). Likewise, He would necessarily have changed all Scriptural passages describing (God as a person) with limbs, like hand, eye, ear, and mouth. Which is more sensible, to alter (the passage) [Gen. 1.1]; "In the beginning God created," in which there is absolutely nothing disgraceful or shameful, either in its exterior or in its interior, or the passage [Num. 12.8]: "With him will I speak mouth to mouth," which implies that God spoke to Moses with His mouth?

This is like what they say about the "Correc tions of the scribes;"207 we will mention it later. Furthermore, their lying is evident from the fact that we find these very passages, which they mention as having been changed and altered, (in the translation current) among the Christians in (a form) contradicting their assertions, i. e., in a form agreeing exactly with our (text), without any alteration. The proof for this is the fact that the Christians adduce against us this (very) passage of the Scripture [Gen. 1.26]: "In Our image and after Our like ness" in defense of their anthropomorphic doctrines. We shall mention this (again) in the course of our account, namely in our refutation of the arguments of the Christians. Likewise, the beginning of their (version of the) Torah reads: "In the beginning God created."208 The same applies to all that they say about them.20' Is there any lie more weak,210 absurd,211 and useless? This is what prompted us to mention these opinions of theirs : Some of them, when asked about any of the things mentioned above, call it a slander; others assert that not all of the Rab banites hold these opinions, but only a few of them do so. I have even been told that some of them assert that none of these things belong at all to the teaching of the Rabbanites, but that only (their) opponents manufactured them and shoved them in212 among the doctrines of the Rabbanites. But from now on, when they deny it before you and call you liars and impose anathemas and curses upon him who says so213 and upon him .תיקון סו3רים 7" בקדמין ברא 08־; but this is the Targum!

It was my intention to refute here (at length) some of their above mentioned doctrines such as do not belong in the discourse on the laws, e. g., their belief in anthropomorphism, (their assertion) that the Torah (in its present form) is not the one brought down by Moses, etc., as well as to prove the falseness of their assertion that their doctrines are approved by the consensus of authorities, and that they are recipients (from men of prophecy). But I am postponing it until I shall dispose of the account of the differences of individual sects, so that the réfuta tion of their doctrines and of the doctrines of the other sects may proceed without interruption. They revere the Targum of the Torah so much that they assert that Onkelos the proselyte recited it from the mouth of Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi;215 they join it to the Torah of God and recite it with the Torah verse after verse. It contains absurdities which cannot even be imagined: e. g., he interprets (the word עילה) in [Gen. 49.11]: "Binding his foal unto the vine" as meaning "his city;" he translates [Deut. 23.18]: "There shall be no whore" as if it was meant by it that no woman of the daughters of Israel should marry a slave and no man of the children of Israel should marry a female slave; he translates [Ex. 12.48]: "No uncircumcised person shall eat thereof" as "No renegade216 shall eat thereof;" he translates [Gen. 28.21]: "Then shall the Lord be my God" as "Then shall the word of the Lord be my God." Nevertheless, he contradicts the Rabbanites in more than one thing: e. g., he says that Enoch died, while they all agree that he ascended to heaven and lives; he says that תורים means turtle doves, whereas they assert that it means a domestic fowl. 21 « Read 'כאבר. 215 This is not true; Onkelos is said to have recited his Targum from the mouth of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua; it is Jonathan ben Uziel, who made the Targum Jonathan, who recited it from the mouth of these three prophets; see Meg. 3a. 214 משומד; our text of the Targum has כל בר ישראל דישתמד.</page><page sequence="46">362 LEON NEMOY [46] Chapter V ACCOUNT OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE SAMARITANS WHICH ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE DOCTRINES OF THE ENTIRE PEOPLE (0F ISRAEL) The Samaritans do not recognize any prophet except Moses and Joshua and do not acknowledge any book of prophecy except the Torah and the book of Joshua.217 They do not recognize (the sanctity of) Jerusalem and their prayer is (directed) towards Shiloh (!).218 They offer sacrifices down to the present day. They have a priest who does not mix among them and does not inter marry with them,219 according to what we have been told. They do not mix with, nor come near to, any person (of another faith), and if any person who is not one of them comes near to them they wash themselves. It is said that they reckon the beginning of months by a (system of) intercalation which is supposed to be the "intercalation of Jeroboam." It is also said that when a garment of theirs becomes (ritually) unclean, they put it in a vessel, e. g., an earthen jar, close the vessel and submerge it in water; thereupon they consider the garment clean, although the water never moistened it ; they think that in such a way they carry out (literally) the command of the Scripture [Lev. 11.32]: "It shall be put into water."220 They consist of two factions, one called Kushan, the other Dustan.221 One of these factions does not believe in future life.222 They have altered some words in the text of the Torah,223 e. g., they read [Ex. 20.18]: "And all the people heard the voices;" they read [Gen. 4.8]: "And Cain said 217 Of course, the Samaritan book of Joshua has nothing to do with the Biblical book of the same name. 21» Sic!

As for other things (of this sort), we shall mention some in our account of the doctrines of Ismâ'ïl al-'Ukbarï. Chapter VI ACCOUNT OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE SADDUCEES, WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS For example, they prohibit divorce, although it is declared (by the Scripture) to be permissible. Also they make all months of thirty days; perhaps they rely in regard to this upon the story of Noah.224 They exclude the Sabbath from the number of the days of the feast of Passover, and observe the feast for seven days in addition to the Sabbath; likewise, in regard to the feast of Tabernacles. They probably imagine that it necessarily follows from the passage of the Scripture [1 Kings 8.66]: "On the eighth day he sent the people away;" here the eighth day can be only the twenty second (of the month), but if the Sabbath is excluded from the number of eight days, the eighth day becomes the twenty third. Daud ibn Marwân al-Muqammis225 treats (in one of his works) of some of their doctrines; we shall mention them at the end of the following chapter. Chapter VII ACCOUNT OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE MAGHARIANS The Magharians fix the beginning of months by the appearance of the new moon. They adduce certain reasons in support of this (method) ; we shall mention them when we come to the discourse on the beginning of months and its indications. It is said that there are among them some who think that laughter is unlawful. Their interpretations of some passages in the Scriptures are altogether improbable and resemble foolish talk. Daud ibn Marwân al-Muqammiç says in one of his books that the Sad ducees ascribe corporeality to God and understand all the 22 4 The comparison of the passages Gen. 7.11; 8.3;and 8.4 seems to prove that five months made out ISO days, or 30 days a month. 225 About him see below, Chapter VIII.</page><page sequence="48">364 LEON NEMOY [48] Scriptural descriptions of Him which imply anthropomorphism in their literal sense. The Magharians are said to be opposed to this, i. e., they do not profess anthropomorphism; yet they also do not take these descriptions (of God) out of their literal meaning, but assert instead that these descriptions refer to one of the angels, namely to the one who created the world. This (opinion) is similar to the view of Benjamin al-Nahâwandï which we shall explain later. As for Boethus who was, as we said above, the companion of Zadok,226 he used to say that the feast of Pentecost must fall on Sunday only, just as our coreligionists say. Chapter Villa ACCOUNT OF JESUS, AND exposition OF THE TEACHING OF THE CHRISTIANS, including THAT WHICH DAÛD AL-muqammis SAYS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THEIR teaching The Jews differ greatly in regard to Jesus. Some say that He claimed to be a prophet, and some deny it. As for the Rabbanites, they mention this in the Talmud (section) "Hëleq ;"227 they admit that he performed miracles, but assert that he did it by means of magic and by (invoking) the secret name (of God).228 As for Benjamin (al-Nahâwandï), I was told that he said that five Jewish men (fraudulently) claimed to be prophets, one of them being Jesus. He said: "To them refers the passage of the Scripture [Dan. 11.14]: 'Also the rebellious sons of thy people will lift themselves up to establish the vision, but they will stumble.' "22' As for some of the Karaites,230 they say that Jesus was a righteous man and that his way (of teaching) was the same as that of Zadok and Anan; but the Rabbanites went 226 Cf. Àbôt de-Rabbi Nathan, chapter 5. 227 Cf. Sanh. 107b in uncensored edition. 228 For the alleged acquaintance of Jesus with magic cf. Shab. 104b, and Rashi ad locum. See also Herford, Christianity in Talmud and Midrash, pp. 54-56. 22' The well-known Karaite scholar Japheth ben Eli, in his (MS.) commen tary to this passage (quoted by Harkavy, p. 258), refers this passage to the pupils of Jesus. 230 So MS. A; MS. B reads: As for the opinion of (all?) the Karaites.</page><page sequence="49">[49] AL-QIRQISÂNÏ's ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 365 after him until they killed him, just as they sought also to kill Anan, although they could not do it. This is their way with everyone who attempts to oppose them. Jesus forbade divorce, just as the Sadducees did. As for the religion of the Christians which they profess to-day, it was Paul who introduced and established it. He was the one who invested Jesus with divinity, and he claimed to be a prophet ordained by his lord Jesus. He231 did not make any (new) laws at all, and he did not declare anything to be obligatory. He asserted that religion consists merely of humility. Therefore, they assert that their fasts and prayers are not obligatory, but are only a matter of free will. He did not prohibit any kind of food at all; on the contrary, he permitted all animals, from the gnat to the elephant. As for the religion of the Christians which they profess to-day, it is outright heresy. E. g. they say that the Creator is one substance in three hypostases; that He is one in three and three in one, for, according to them, He is living and knowing; but life and knowledge are two qualities of the substance, therefore the substance is one hypostasis and the two qualities are two hypostases, together three hypostases. They assert that Jesus is the Messiah who was predicted by the prophets and whose advent was promised by them; that he is one of the three hypostases, and that the three hypostases are Son, Father, and (Holy) Spirit; the Son is Jesus who is divine and human, for the Creator who is the substance personified Himself in him. This is all that they say, though they differ among themselves in particulars.232 They assert that the Temple referred to by the prophets as going to be built and restored, i. e., the one seen by Ezekiel (in his vision), is the one built by Zerubbabel, and there will be no other; also, that all the announcements made by the prophets have (already) been carried out and have come to pass. The modern Christian philosophers assert that the laws of the Torah were given to the children of Israel only because of (God's) wrath ; and that they have chosen these laws for themselves only 231 Probably Jesus, not Paul. 2והם אלטכתלפין פי אלחפציל 2ג; the translation is uncertain.</page><page sequence="50">366 LEON NEMOY [50] on account of their resemblance to the laws of the Sabians. This was due to the fact that they became accustomed to the ways of the Egyptians during their sojourn with them, these ways being akin to the ways of the Sabians. According to them, the doctrine of the Creator being a substance in three hypostases was a secret not revealed by God to anyone of the predecessors (of Jesus), since the minds of men at that time were unable to comprehend it ; but when Jesus came and there arose (a generation of) men able to comprehend it with their minds, this doctrine was revealed and taught to them. They assert that the word of God is as old as He is; here is one of their main arguments in support of this: John says in his Gospel, which is one of the four Gospels: "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and God is the word."233 Aside from this, they base their claims upon some ambiguous passages in our Scripture;234 we shall mention their arguments, together with our refutation of them, later, namely after we will have refuted their doctrine from the point of view of pure reason. Here is what Dafld ibn Marwân al-Raqqi235 relates about the origin of the Christian religion. Daud ibn Marwâm al-Raqqï, known as al-Muq&amp;mmis, was a philosopher. Originally a Jew, he was converted to Christianity in Nisibis through the agency of a man named Nànâ. This Nana was greatly honored among the Christians, for he was an accomplished philosopher and practiced surgery. Daud al-Muqammis was his pupil for a great many years; he learned thoroughly the origins of Christianity and its mysteries and mastered philosophy. But (afterwards) he com posed two books against the Christians in which he attacked them; these two books are well known. He also translated from among the books and the commentaries of the Christians a commentary on Genesis, called "Book of creation"236 and a commentary on Ecclesiastes. Daud ibn Marwân says: When the Christians could not find in the Gospels any decisive regulations about certain things, they 33־ An exact translation of John 1.1. 134 i. e., the Old Testament.

They made decisions and passed judgments according to these laws (for some time). At the time, however, when the regulations laid down by Paul and Peter were no longer sufficient to provide for their needs, (a company of) bishops assembled in the city of Nicea and laid down for them (new) regulations in addition to those of these (two men). These new laws were accepted and became the standard authority; but there is no mention of them either in the Torah, or in the Gospels, or in the Canon of Peter and Paul. The Christians believe them to be the laws of God and pass judgment according to them, yet there is no (divine) authority back of it.339 (Daiid) says: Whoever examines them knows it. Nor was it only these three hundred and eighteen bishops who laid down for them such regulations; on the con trary, various authorities had made similar prescriptions; and they340 took their direction from whichever of them they wished. He says : The reason for this is that their Gospels ... to accept the opinion of anyone who has his own opinion, even without (requiring) any proof from the Gospels. These bishops were at the time of Constantine the Leprous,341 son of the innkeeper Helena.343 It was he who introduced the (symbol of the) cross and built (many) churches; he killed Arius because the latter asserted that the Messiah is created. These are the men who established the (Christian) religion.

They say that . . . . . . [Mark?]244 mentions his ancestors but does not give his (full) genealogy; so also John; they (both?)245 mention the ancestors listed by Matthew and those listed by Luke. But this reveals an enormous discrepancy between these four (Evangel ists). Namely, Matthew counts from the earliest to the latest and says: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Perez, Hezron (and so forth), in a natural line, until he comes to David; then he omits Nathan, to whom Luke traces (the lineage), and continues: Solomon, Rehaboam, Abiah, Asa, Jehosaphat (and so forth), listing the part of the earlier lineage mentioned by Luke,246 and the genealogy of Joseph who sought the Mother of Jesus in marriage. Luke, however, lists the Biblical247 line, i. e., from Joseph to Adam, and then also Hailai son of Matath son of Levi son of Malki son of Joseph son of Matetha son of Amos son of Nahum son of Kislai son of Nagid son of Maat son of Shimei son of Joseph son of Judah, and the further lineage. Thus, Matthew traces his genealogy from Solomon son of David to Jacob, whereas Luke traces his genealogy from them248 to Nathan son of David. In such a way this lineage in both Gospels is not that of Jesus but that of Joseph who sought the Mother of Jesus in marriage. So here are three discrepancies: first, the disagreement of the two lineages; second, both are of Joseph (not of Jesus); third, according to the Gospels, the Mother of Jesus was engaged to Joseph and he did not come in unto her, but found her to be pregnant from the Holy Spirit, as Matthew and Luke say. On 24ג The translation is free; the Arabic is very clumsy; perhaps some words have fallen out. 244 The translation of this paragraph is uncertain in many places, due to the lacuna at the beginning. 245 דאכרון is plural, but it cannot possibly refer to anyone except Mark and John, as far as it appears from the context. Plural for dual in colloquial Arabic is, of course, quite common. 246 מתי is apparently a lapsus calami for לוקא. 247 אלנאמוסיה. 248 i. e., from the above line: Hailai son of Matath, etc.</page><page sequence="53">[53] AL-QIRQISÂNl's ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 369 the other hand, we cannot find any mention whatever of Hailai, Jacob, and Matath, either in the twenty four (books of the Old Testament), or in the Jewish tradition,249 and they are not known in genealogy. But the Christians fraudulently assert that Hailai was a man of them and the son of Nathan son of David, and that he was an (uterine) brother of Jacob son of Nathan, who was born to his250 mother from Solomon;251 that Hailai died without issue, so that his uterine brother Jacob came in unto his wife to establish an offspring for him. Thus came Joseph who was in such a way a son to both men: to Jacob by nature, and to Hailai by the law of the establishment of an offspring (for the dead brother). This is the statement of Daud ibn Marwân al-Muqammis; I have quoted it literally252 in order that the absurdity and weakness of the doctrines of the Christians might become clear, in fact too clear and evident to require any detailed explanation. Chapter VII lb REFUTATION OF the doctrines OF THOSE who CLAIM that JESUS son OF MARY was INVESTED WITH PROPHECY and performed MIRACLES As for the followers of Jesus and those who believe in him, i. e. the Christians and no others, they attribute to him divinity, according to the information that reached us. The master of the Moslems,255 at the time he announced his claim to prophecy, had his attention drawn to the unanimous belief of the Christians in the miracles of Jesus. But since he was no person accustomed to research and speculation, who would investigate the origin of Jesus's history, he acknowledged his miracles so as not to injure his own plans; for he feared lest he, too, should be called an impostor, if he should disavow it, as it happened in the case of 2 49 אשפעת (so MS. B ; MS. A has the arabicized form סטעת), literally hearsay (פפאע) is the Talmudic שפעתתא. 250 i. e., Hailai's. 251 by levirate? .עלי נהתה 2*2 2s3 i. e., Muhammad the prophet.</page><page sequence="54">370 LEON NEMOY [54] Abu 'Isa al-Isfahânï, whose story we have mentioned above. Therefore, although he did not yield to the Christians in regard to the recognition of Jesus's divinity, he, too, invested him with prophecy and also agreed with the Christians that he was born of no (mortal) father. In arguing in favor of Jesus's prophecy the Moslem theologians say: "We see that the Christians are so enormous a multitude that their number cannot even be computed; is it not reasonable that we should agree with them? Now, they assert that they have a tradition from their ancestors to the effect that Jesus son of Mary performed miracles, like reviving dead and restoring the sight of blind, etc., the like of which cannot possibly be performed unless by the direct inter cession of the Lord of the worlds and by the hand of a (true) prophet. If this is so, then it is evident that Jesus was a (true) prophet sent from God." They say furthermore: "If someone should object to this, saying: 'But all those who have transmitted the traditions about Jesus's miracles have also transmitted (the doctrine) that he is divine and is one of the hypostases which constitute God, and that God personified Himself in his body; if they are to be trusted in regard to their tradition about his miracles (they are to be trusted also in regard to their traditions about Jesus's divinity),'—we shall reply: Thy objection is null and void, inasmuch as it234 has no connection with our argument. Their tradition about Jesus's miracles is based solely upon the accounts of eye-witnesses, whereas the doctrine of (Jesus's) divinity is merely a matter which they derive by reasoning, analogy, and arguments produced by speculation. Thus the latter doctrine is not of the same nature as a fact ascertained by the testimony of eye-witnesses. Therefore, when we ask the Christians what is the proof (for their assertion) that Jesus performed signs and miracles they answer: '(It is true) for we have received it by tradition from our ancestors, generation after generation, to the effect that those who lived in his253 time witnessed him performing it in their presence.' But if we ask them to prove that this236 is one of the attributes of God (and 2s־• Read ועארצת. 255 i. e., Jesus's. 256 i. e., performance of miracles.</page><page sequence="55">[55] AL-QIRQISÂNl'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 371 that Jesus is for this reason divine), they do not mention any tradition or any testimony of eye-witnesses, but derive this doctrine merely by analogy and reasoning." To this I wish to answer thus:257 Verily, you have misinterpreted the objection and diverted it from its (real) meaning, since that which you have just mentioned is not the (actual) objection proffered against you. But what was (really) said to you (is this) : All those who have handed down the traditions about Jesus's miracles, i. e., the Christians, assert that the four disciples, i. e., Matthew, Luke, Mark, and John, were also prophets and have also performed signs and miracles. They claim the same also for Paul, namely that he was a prophet and that Jesus invested him with prophecy, furnished him with signs and miracles and sent him out (to preach) ; that it was he who converted the majority of the peoples, e. g., the Greeks, and others, to the Christian faith. Now those who witnessed the miracles of Jesus (are merely a very small group, since) Jesus lived only in Syria, whereas Paul visited the land of the Greeks and made a circuit of many (other) lands inviting the people (to become Christians) ; he used to perform miracles wherever he came, bringing the people under his influence in such a manner that they embraced the religion he was preaching to them. The traditionists of Paul are more numerous than the traditionists of Jesus. In fact, it was Paul who proclaimed the doctrine of the Trinity and announced that the Creator is one substance in three hypostases, Father and Son and the Spirit of God, and that Jesus is the Son of God and His sign, being one of the hypostases. Therefore, if the tradition of the Christians about Jesus's miracles is correct and they are to be trusted in it, then they are necessarily to be trusted also in their tradition about Paul's miracles. Moreover, the (tradition about the) miracles of Paul should, then, be (considered) even more trustworthy, since, according to the above statement, the number of the traditionists who handed it down is twice the number of those who transmitted the tradition about Jesus's miracles. It this is so, then the prophecy of Paul is beyond doubt and what ever he said is true; but then his doctrine about the Trinity and רקאל להם "ג ; something like מאלף אלכתאב is to be understood.</page><page sequence="56">372 LEON NEMOY [56] about God being one substance in three hypostases is also a true and good doctrine ! If, however, they say: "But how is it possible that the doctrine of the Trinity should be true, as long as it is contrary to reason?", we shall answer: If so, then the man who taught it could not have been a (true) prophet or have performed miracles; it is also evident, then, that those who have transmitted these traditions about him are men upon whose testimony one cannot base any arguments; also, that those who assert that many people have witnessed these miracles and that the argument is based upon their testimony are evidently not speaking the truth. But if it is evident that those who attribute performance of miracles to Paul are liars, it is even more evident that those who attribute the same to Jesus are also liars, since they are much fewer in number. Thus we have shown that the doctrine of those who attribute prophecy to Jesus is false; but if the prophecy of Jesus and of others whom Abu 'Isa al-Isfahânî invested with it is proved to be false, then his own claims to prophecy must also be unfounded. If, however, the Moslems will let alone258 the traditions of the Christians, while arguing in favor of Jesus's prophecy, and will return to their statement that they believe in it merely on the basis of the words of their master, whose own prophecy is beyond doubt,259—in fact, the modern Moslem theologians assert even in regard to Moses that they believe in his prophecy on the sole basis of the statements of their master, but not at all on the basis of the Jewish and Christian tradition, although this is in contra diction with the opinion of their older theologians, like AbO '1-Hudhayl al-'Allâf260 and Ibrahim al-Nazzâm261 and others. 258 The text seems to be corrupt ; something like תרך אלמסלמץ אלאחתנאג must have stood in the original. 2s« Al-Qirqisânï does not finish the phrase. 260 Abu '1-Hudhayl Muhammad ibn al-Hudhayl al-'Abdï al-'Allàf ("the fod der-merchant") was one of the foremost thinkers of the Mu'tazila school, ca. A. H. 135-226, i.e. A. D. 752/3-840/1. 261 Abu Ishâq Ibrahim ibn Sayyâr al-Na??am ("maker of pearl-strings"), a contemporary of the above thinker, died A. D. 845. Cf. Horten, Die philos. Système, 1912, pp. 189-241.</page><page sequence="57">[57] AL-QIRQISÂNÎ'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 373 There were two reasons which forced the modernists to seek refuge in this theory. First, their reluctance to engage in dispute with the Jews, who insist that if they262 admit that the Jewish traditions ought to be studied and can be adduced as authority for arguments, they must also admit that their263 tradition about the perpetuity of the Torah264 is also true, granting in such a way that the statement of their master (in this respect) is false. Secondly, their master asserted that he is mentioned in the Torah and that Moses foretold his coming. We all, however, say that this is not true, since we do not findjit in the Torah. This forced them to deny the fact that he265 himself recognizes (the holiness and authority of) the Torah, since he calls it and its people266 to witness in his behalf in more than one place of his book.267 We have dealt with this question in detail in our book which we have written against them. They even say: "The Torah which you have268 is not the genuine original Torah, and the man Moses in whom you believe is not the same man as the one in whom we believe." When we ask them : Why do you think so? they answer just as we expect them to, their reply consisting of the very thing we blame them for; they say: "Because the true prophet Moses is the one who foretold (the advent of) Muhammad, and the true Torah is the one in which this is written. As soon as you say that in the Torah which you have this is not written, and that the man Moses in whom you believe has not foretold it, we learn that this Moses and this Torah are not the (true) ones." Yet in such a way they contradict, as we have shown above, their own principles and make their own master a liar, inasmuch as he declared this Torah to be true and called its people to witness in his behalf in many places (of the Koran). In addition so that they reject the evidence of 262 i. e., the Moslem theologians. 263 i. e., the Jews'. 26יי Muhammad and later the Moslem theologians asserted that the Jews have made changes in the original text of the Torah as given on Mount Sinai, and that therefore the Torah is no longer authoritative and is superceded by the Koran. 265 i. e.

Some of them are thereby compelled to assert that (during that time) people used to guide themselves in religious matters by their own judgment only. But we have already shown in the fourteenth chapter of this part that this doctrine is false and that it leads to (complete) abrogation of prophecy. We have also shown in the preceding chapter, in a way that will convince anyone who would examine our arguments, that the prophecy of their master is untrue from more than one aspect. In regard to their assertion that "Moses in whom they269 believe is not the true prophet Moses," the following story that has been told to us on their own authority ought to be recited to them: We have been told that a company of people was present at a reception held by one of the caliphs, say al-Ma'mun270 or any other, and the caliph issued in their presence a certain order; later they went out and separated. After a while they met in a certain place in a certain country and some of them said to the others: "Do you not remember that we have been on such and such a day of such and such a month in the year so and so in Bagdad at a reception held by the commander of the faithful 'Abd Allah al-Ma'mun, son of Hârûn al-Rashïd, father of Mu hammad al-Amin son of Zubayda, and that he issued such and such an order?" The others, however, said: "We certainly have been present on that day, as you say; but as for the order which you assert he issued, he never did so; moreover, he issued an order exactly to the contrary, namely thus and thus." Is it to be inferred from this answer and from the fact that the 6נ' i. e., the Jews. "» A. H. 198-218. i. e. A.

Or2'2 is it rather merely evident .that one of the parties is wrong, attributing to him something he never said? Even if they should assert that this case is not the same as the case (of Moses), the matter is so perfectly clear, that there is no need whatsoever to argue with them, since there is no one else (but Moses) known on earth whom all these facts and descriptions would fit. If, however, they should admit that both cases are alike—in fact it cannot be otherwise—and that the only trouble is that one of the parties attributes to him something he never said, we would say: This is what we also say, namely: there was at such and such a time, during the reign of (king) so and so a man from the descendants of Jacob, who was also called Israel, and from the tribe of Levi, called Moses son of Amram; his brother was called Aaron, and his sister Miriam. God spoke to him from the thorn tree and sent him to Pharaoh and to the children of Israel with wonderful signs, e. g., the transformation of his staff into a snake, the whitening of his hand, the transformation of the water (of the Nile) into blood, the crossing of the (Red) sea, and all the other miracles mentioned in the Scriptures. God com manded him to2'3 enjoin upon the children of Israel the observ ance of the Sabbath and abstinence from work on that day, the eating of unleavened for seven days, the (rite of) circumcision, etc. All these particulars (of the story of Moses) you grant us without contradiction. Then, we say that he laid down a perma ment (code of) law ; you assert (in addition to that) that he foretold the advent of a certain man. Now does this assertion (of yours) imply that the one we were speaking about is not the same as the one you believe in? Or does it rather imply that one of us is attributing to him something (which is not true), either we or you? There is no other way out of this, and in this very fact2'4 : Read צד טא. "a Read או.</page><page sequence="60">376 LEON NEMO Y [60] lies the destruction of this newly invented doctrine and the confirmation (of the fact) that Moses in whom we believe is the same man as the one they acknowledge, and that one of the two parties has been ascribing to him something which is not true. Now it is impossible that we should be the ones to make the false statements, since we are dispersed and scattered from the East to the West, and it is impossible that we all should (secretly) agree to deny that which is (supposedly) recorded in our (Holy) books.275 If they say: "But it is the same case with ourselves,for we also are scattered from the East to the West, and it is im possible that we all should be liars," we shall answer: You do not lie in quoting the words of the man who said so; it is only that you quote the words of a person who made it up himself to impress (upon others) the truth of his own affair. If they turn again to false and artificial interpretations (of passages in the Old Testament), there has been enough of it already, so there is no need to add to it any more. Thus, the doctrine of Abu 'Isa al-Isfahânï and his claim to prophecy have been shown to be false, as well as the (claims to) prophecy of the two men276 whom he acknowledged (as true prophets). As for Yudghân, i. e., the (so-called) "shepherd,"277 who also pretended to be the Messiah, there is no reason to bother with him, since his affair is too clear and evident to need any mention. We shall now turn to the refutation of those of the followers of Anan who believe in metempsychosis. Chapter IX ACCOUNT OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE QARA'lANS The only thing we know positively about their doctrines is that they use utensils of gourds. We do not know what their reason for it is. But judging by some other things that we have heard about them we think that it is possible that they agree with the Samaritans in regard to the impurity they may contract by 275 i. e. the advent of Muhammad. 276 Jesus and Muhammad. 277 Read אלראעי; cf.

What confirms this conjecture is the fact that some theologians say about them that they never put anyone not of their creed in charge of anything pertaining to their sowing or harvesting; this is strange, too, and we do not know what their reason for it is. It is also said about them that they rest both on Sunday and on Saturday; this indicates that they incline to some extent towards the doctrines of the Christians. This is all I could find out about their doctrines ; I have seen some of it in a book by one of the theologians, containing an account of (various) religious systems. I used to think that the Qara'ians appeared after Jesus and the Christians, until I had my attention drawn to a book by Daûd ibn Marwàn al-Muqammis, entitled "Book of fierce attack,"280 in which he says that the religion of the Christians is a combination of that of the Sadducees and that of the Qara'ians; this indicates that the Qara'ians existed before the Christians. Inasmuch as I thought that the Christians appeared first I let the account of them precede the account of the Qara'ians. Chapter X ACCOUNT OF the differences BETWEEN the RABBANITES OF SYRIA and the RABBANITES OF babylonia The things in which they differ are about fifty in number; it is unnecessary for us to mention all of them; we wish only to mention the most important of them, such as cause each party to accuse the other of heresy, because it follows a different rule, 278 Apparently they thought that all non-Qara'ians are as unclean as a dead body. 27מי נדה י. 280 כתאב אלצראה ; the above is Bacher's translation. Professor Torrey suggests the translation of the title as "Book of earnest purpose."</page><page sequence="62">378 LEON NEMOY [62] since the differences existing between both parties are not inferior (in importance) to those existing between them both on one side and the Karaites and Ananites 011 the other. This also refutes their assertion that they are holders of the (true) tradition and that their customs come down directly from (the men endowed by God with) prophecy. Before we list their differences we shall mention their own words about it. The School of Hillel and the School of Shammai differed in (many) things; in some cases whatever the School of Shammai made weighty the School of Hillel made light, in others whatever the School of Shammai made light the School of Hillel made weighty. The Rabbanites say281 that whoever practises according to the aggravations of the School of Shammai and the alleviations of the School of Hillel is a sinner; so is also a person who practises according to the alleviations of the School of Shammai and the aggravations of the School of Hillel; but the right way is to practise according to one of these systems (only), both in its aggravations and its alleviations, and whosoever inclines entirely towards one of these systems is praiseworthy. Even if their wickedness were evident from this passage only, it would have been sufficient; for they declare two contradictory systems to be both true and say that whoever adheres to (either) one of them pursues the right course! One of their differences is that the School of Shammai forbids the killing of insects on the Sabbath,282 whereas the School of Hillel permits it; the later (authorities), however, say: "The rule is according to the School of Hillel." They differ also in the interpretation of the expression [Ex. 22.4]: "The best of his field:"283 some say that this refers to (the field of) the one who suffered the damage, and that it is said "The best of his field" for the reason that in the fields and vine yards there are found thorn-trees as well as (good) crops, many plants of the kind of fire-wood and alfalfa-grass as well as good ripe fruits. Therefore, it is ruled that if anyone lets his cattle go free, and it "eats up" the choice of it he should be obliged to 381 'Er. 8b below. 282 Shab. 12a. 288 B. K. 6b-7a.</page><page sequence="63">[63] AL-QIRQISÂNÏ'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 379 refund284 the exact equivalent of what it ate up285 and damaged. In such a way the expression "the best" should be connected with the preceding, i. e., "If it eats up the best of his field," "he shall pay" being an independent sentence. Others say that it refers to (the field of) the one who (se cattle) caused the damage. Another difference between the people of Syria and the people of Babylonia is that the people of Syria require for a virgin two hundred dirhems as dowry, and for a widow one hundred dirhems. The people of Babylonia fix the dowry at twenty five dirhems.286 It necessarily follows that the people of Syria should consider the marriages of the people of Babylonia unlawful, since the latter do not furnish the required dowry in full. Or, if such a marriage is lawful, there should be no fixed amount of dowry; then what is the meaning of "two hundred dirhems?" In fact what they say in the Mishnah contradicts the dowry regulations of both parties, namely: "One may betroth a wife with a small coin or an equiva lent of a small coin."287 Now if it is allowed to betroth a wife by a single small coin, is it not clear that any dowry is thereby abol ished, whether of twenty five (dirhems) or of two hundred, or any amount whatsoever? The people of Babylonia do not allow a woman, whose husband died while she was nursing at the breast, to remarry before the expiration of two years; the people of Syria allow her to remarry after the expiration of eighteen months. It follows, then, that a child born to her288 should be considered illegitimate by the people of Babylonia, since she had married unlawfully. We have said above that the people of Syria consummate marriage by means of a finger; in the opinion of the people of Babylonia this is equivalent to fornication. Also, the people of Babylonia forbid a newly wedded man to repeat the intercourse before the expiration of seven days, whereas the people of Syria make no restriction whatsoever. Now if a child is born of such a »84 □,יעלם = יסק, a peculiar Jewish-Arabic usage. »8s = בער, also a peculiar Jewish-Arabic usage. *8' In both cases?

On the other hand, if a woman has conceived on her wedding night the people of Syria have to consider her child illegitimate, since the consummation of marriage must be performed, according to them, by means of a finger only. The people of Babylonia think that it is lawful to place a pot (with food) into the oven before the approach of the Sab bath289 so that the food may get cooked during the Sabbath; the people of Syria forbid it; thus, in the opinion of the people of Syria, the people of Babylonia are deliberately profaning the Sabbath. The people of Babylonia do not perform any ablutions after a nocturnal pollution or sexual intercourse, whereas the people of Syria wash themselves after these actions even on the day of Atonement, when no ablutions whatsoever are allowed; thus, in the opinion of the people of Syria, the people of Babylonia are forever unclean. One of the elders of the community290 told me that he had seen some people in the Maghrib who never perform any ablutions after sexual intercourse. I am listing all this merely because they completely deny it when they hear it, although it is true. The people of Syria relieve themselves in water, whereas the people of Babylonia do so upon the (bare) ground.291 We have said above that the people of Babylonia allow a menstruating woman to do all the housework, like cooking, baking, etc.; the people of Syria forbid it; this is like the two preceding differences. The people of Babylonia allow (carrying plain) myrtle( leaves) on the Sabbath of the feast of Tabernacles, but forbid (carrying) them (inserted) in the lulab; the people of Syria do the contrary. The people of Babylonia permit a person to weigh meat on a holiday, whereas the people of Syria absolutely forbid (so much as) putting it on the scales, be it even with the purpose of preserv 28י Shab. 3.1,—not a direct permission. 2,0 אלנסאעדו; it may be either the community of the Rabbanites, or that cf the Karaites; probably the latter. ?9I Literally : stone,</page><page sequence="65">[65] AL-QIRQISÂN1'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 381 ing it from rats. According to that, the people of Babylonia profane the holiday, from the point of view of the people of Syria. The people of Babylonia dispose of the prepuce2'2 in water, whereas the people of Syria bury it in sand ;2'3 thus, in the opinion of each party the circumcision of the other party is unlawful. The people of Babylonia distinguish between a forbidden ewe and an allowed one2'4 by examining the lungs, whereas the people of Syria examine the head.2'5 One of the elders of Raqqa told (me) that he had been in Jerusalem and that a ewe was examined there first at the head and declared to be forbidden, then at the lungs and declared to be allowed, and that with another ewe the case was (exactly) to the contrary. Thus, in the opinion of each party the other party is eating forbidden food. Likewise, the people of Babylonia do not allow a person to slaughter an animal until eight days after it has been born, whereas the people of Syria slaughter such an animal (even) on the very same day; thus, in the opinion of the people of Babylonia the people of Syria eat food absolutely forbidden. The people of Babylonia do not allow one to betroth a woman during the Jubilee year, whereas the people of Syria allow it; thus, if a woman of the people of Syria marries during such a year her marriage is in the opinion of the people of Babylonia unlawful and her children (from this marriage) illegitimate. The people of Babylonia think that it is lawful to carry money on the Sabbath, whereas the people of Syria forbid one (even) to come near to it ; thus, according to the latter, the people of Babylonia profane the Sabbath. The people of Babylonia observe (each) holiday for two days, whereas the people of Syria observe it one day only; thus, in the opinion of the people of Babylonia the people of Syria profane the holidays and transgress the commandment "Thou shalt not diminish [from it]," whereas in the opinion of the people of Syria the people of Babylonia observe feasts not enjoined by God and transgress His commandment "Thou shalt not add thereto." 392 After circumcision. 2« Cf.

One of them collected all this in a special work, and from this book we have taken our information about it. So do ye not pay any attention to their insolent denials. Chapter XI ACCOUNT OF THE DOCTRINES OF ABÙ 'ÏSÂ, I.I. E., OBADIAH, AL-ISFAHÀNÏ We have said above that Abu 'Isa pretended to be a prophet and that the miraculous thing about him was, according to his followers, the fact that although illiterate and unable to write or read, he produced books, which is impossible unless through (the gift of) prophecy. As for his teaching and doctrines, he prohibited divorce as do the Sadducees and the Christians. He prescribed seven prayers daily inferring this from the saying of David [Psalms 119.164]: "Seven times daily do I praise Thee." He also prohibited meat and intoxicating drinks, not on the authority of the Scripture, but asserting that God commanded him to do so by direct revelation.2'6 He greatly esteemed and honored the Rabbanites, until he made them stand on an equal footing with the prophets. According to the Rabbanites, he asserted that God commanded him to pray the eighteen (benedic tions) and the Shema'-prayer. He did this only with the purpose of drawing to himself the hearts of the common people and the general body (of the sectarians?); for this reason the Rabbanites and the general body (of the sectarians?) do not repudiate the Isunians and do not look upon them with the same eyes as they look upon Ananites and Karaites. I asked Ya'qub ibn Ifrâ'ïm al-Shâmï: "Why do you favor the Isunians and why do you intermarry with them, although you know that they attribute prophecy to men who had nothing to do with it?" He replied: "Because they do not differ from us in the observance of holi days." This answer of his indicates that, according to them,2'7 manifestation of (complete) unbelief is more pardonable than display of (petty) differences in the observance of holidays which 26י Literally, by way of prophecy. 297 i. e., the Rabbanites.</page><page sequence="67">[67] AL-QIRQISANÏ'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 383 they themselves invented. Abu 'Isa acknowledged the prophecy of Jesus son of Mary and of the master of the Moslems; he asserted that each one of them was sent (by God) to his own people, and he enjoined (upon his followers) the reading of the Koran and of the Gospels and the study of their commentaries. He said that the Moslems and the Christians should each observe the religion they now adhere to, just as the Jews should observe the religion they now profess.298 It was merely the preservation of his own affair and the protection of his own teaching that prompted him to recognize the prophecy of these two men, as well as the safeguarding of his own claim to prophecy ; for had he disavowed these two men, the people would very soon have disavowed him, too; thus, he hoped that by recognizing these two men he would bring his own affair to perfection. But he was disappointed in his hope and his expectation was frustrated. We will show the falseness of his claims later. Chapter XII ACCOUNT OF THE DOCTRINES OF YUDGHÂN, CALLED "THE SHEPHERD' YudghanYudghan also pretended to be a prophet; his followers assert that he was the Messiah and that he did not die; they expect him to return (any moment). The Yudghanites prohibit meat and intoxicating drinks and observe a great many prayers and fasts. They assert that Sabbaths and holidays are at the present time no longer obligatory, but (should be kept) only as memorial days. Some of the Karaites share with them the same opinion; we will mention it later. Chapter XIII ACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCES OF THE EXILARCH ANAN AND HIS FOLLOWERS He allowed the carrying of light loads on the Sabbath; this is contained in his saying: "Burden299 means only that which is 3»י Probably meaning that all religions are true, and none is better than the other. .מן1א</page><page sequence="68">384 LEON NEMO Y [68] carried on the shoulder;" such is his saying as it stands. Some of his followers, however, assert that he meant by it the carrying (of loads) inside of houses, that is to say, he meant that people should not be permitted to carry (anything) on their shoulders inside their houses. But the virtual meaning of this saying does not imply that which these men assert; we shall comment on it in its (proper) place. He did not allow any recitation of prayers except in a special place that he called "courtyard."300 He asserted that whosoever eats during the seven days of Passover unleavened wheat bread is just as (sinful as) if he had eaten leaven.301 He required that circumcision should be performed with scissors only; he ordered (his followers) to use at the circum cision two strips of linen, a large one and a small one, (soaked) with walnut oil. Whoever differed in any of these things was considered by him uncircumcised. Likewise, he thought that a man circumcised by a person who had not been operated upon in the same manner cannot be considered circumcised, and has to undergo a second operation. He required that circumcision of adult persons302 should take place on the eleventh day of the month only, and not on any other day; likewise, that a woman who wishes to embrace the (Karaite) faith should do this on the eighth day of the month. He required that the searching for the young ears should be done on the fourteenth day of Shebat, and asserted that Shebat is the month of intercalation, and not Adar. The literal meaning of one of his sayings indicates that he allowed a person (to marry) the paternal aunt and the maternal aunt, i. e., the one who is not on the father's side; his followers, however, completely deny this (regulation).303 He permitted marrying the daughter of the father's wife, 304 provided that the father has no children from her, i. e., from the mother. He asserted that the passage of the Scriptures [Lev. 18.18]: "A .חצר 3°° 301 As Harkavy remarks, Anan apparently thought that wheat bread, even if unleavened, is too luxurious a food to serve as a symbol of the "bread of poverty" that the Jews had eaten upon their departure from Egypt. 302 Apparently proselytes. 303 Literally, they flee from it with a hasty flight. ?°4 i. e., the daughter of the step-mother.</page><page sequence="69">[69] AL-QIRQISÂNÏ's ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 385 wife to her sister" means a woman and the daughter of her sister. He asserted that the passage [ibid., 15.8]: "And if he that had the issue spit upon the clean one" (implies) that women are made thereby an exception, so that if he that had the issue spit upon a (ritually) clean woman she does not become unclean.305 He established a fast of seventy days, from the thirteenth day of Nisan to the twenty third day of Siwan ; he also established a fast every seventh day of a month, also during both days of Pu rim.306Pu rim.306 He prohibited cohabitation during daytime; he also forbade having more than one cohabitation in a night and a day. He forbade cohabitation with a pregnant woman before the expiration of three months after the childbirth. When the fifteenth of Nisan fell on a Sabbath he used to transfer the celebration of the feast (of Passover) to Sunday, i. e., the sixteenth; likewise, in the case of the feast of Tabernacles. He did not acknowledge any impurity as regards fluids. He asserted that a vessel cannot contract impurity from another vessel. He denied any impurity contracted through contact with a dead body at the present time, and he did not acknowledge impurity due to nocturnal pollution. He asserted that if rats or (any of) the other eight307 (kinds of similar impure animals) get killed, their (specific) impurity should be considered less important than their impurity as dead bodies. He asserted that a dead corpse of (each of) these eight (kinds of animals) has a "resting place"3 08 which should be treated in the same way as the couch of a menstruating woman. He made impurity valid only in case of persons who purposely draw near to (the impure object). He asserted that a rat running about upon the ground does not inflict any impurity. He asserted that an unclean person performing the ablution not from a vessel does not become clean. He allowed menstruating women to stay in the "camp,"309 to throw vegetables in a cooking-pot and to 305 Anan apparently inferred this from the masculine gender of "the clean one" in the verse referred to. 306 Literally, of (the reading of) the Scroll (of Esther). 307 Rather seven; cf. Lev. 11.29-30. 308 i. e., the place on which such a corpse lies becomes unclean also and must be cleansed. 30אלסחנה י, probably in a general sense: he did not require any severe isola tion of menstruating women.</page><page sequence="70">386 LEON NEMOY [70] kindle the fire beneath it. He did not consider a man clean accord ing to the full requirements of the law, if he differed from him even in a single regulation. He asserted that some impurities can affect only persons (at least) twenty years old, whereas others may affect even children five years old. He asserted that the young of clean cattle, having died before it became eight days of age, does not inflict impurity. It is said about him that he believed in metempsychosis and composed a book about it; besides, we have seen some of his followers who also profess the same belief. We shall mention the sayings of those who believe in metempsychosis and in repeated existence310 and refute them later. Chapter XIV ACCOUNT OF THE differences OF BENJAMIN AL-nâhawandï He asserted that the Creator created nothing but a single angel, and that it was this angel who created the entire world, sent out the prophets and commissioned the messengers, performed miracles and issued orders and prohibitions; and that it is he who causes everything in the world to happen, without (the interference of) the original Creator. He asserted that levirate is obligatory only in regard to a female slave.3" He asserted that the passage of the Scriptures [Deut. 21.15]: "And if the first-born shall be of the unloved wife"3" means that even if the favorite wife has given birth first her son must not be considered the first-born, but the primogeniture must belong to the son of the unloved wife, whether he is born first or not, for in either case 3תכריר °". 3" Harkavy (p. 268) overlooked the particle אנמא and construed this phrase as meaning that levirate is obligatory also in the case of a female slave; no wonder that he had to say that he does not understand what Benjamin meant by it. But the meaning is quite clear: since the Jj.alisah is a more or less humiliât ing ordeal for the brother of the deceased (cf. Deut. 25.5-10, and especially verse 9) he apparently thought it improper to have a free man suffer humilia tion from a bond-woman ; on the other hand, theoretically, a widow whom her brother-in-law refuses to marry becomes through the halisah ordeal free to marry whomsoever she pleases, which would be impossible in the case of a slave-woman. 3" Read here and below שנואה.</page><page sequence="71">[71] AL-QIRQISÂNÎ'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 387 they are both first-born313 children (to their respective mothers). He asserted that the passage of the Scripture [Ex. 22.1]: "If the thief is found in a hole314 and is beaten and dies" means in any kind of a hole, even if it was an old hole in a ruined building, which he did not dig out himself. He asserted that the passage of the Scriptures [Deut. 23.16]: "Do not surrender a fugitive slave" means that even if a slave belonging to one of the children of Israel has fled from him to thee, thou hast no right to surrender him to his master. He prohibited marriage with a woman nursing at the breast. He made (all) the laws obligatory upon children as soon as they begin to talk. He allowed (his followers) to fix the beginning of all months by calculation, with the exception of the months of Nisan and Tishri, the beginning of which he permitted them to fix only by the appearance of the new moon. He thought that the killing of birds should consist of both slaughtering and wringing (the neck).315 He asserted that if a female slave has had intercourse with a man in a deserted place(?)place(?) 31־ she shall not be put to death, even if it happened with her consent. He asserted that a dead (foetus) coming out of the womb does not inflict impurity, since impurity can be inflicted only by that which dies in the open air. He asserted that only a grave situated outside (of a house317) inflicts impurity upon anyone who comes near to it, whereas a grave situated inside of a house does not inflict impurity upon anyone who draws nigh to it. He asserted that in case of a garment of a menstruating woman which served her as night-clothes or day-clothes, a man coming near to it while it is not on her becomes unclean and must (bathe and) wash his own clothes; if, however, he comes near to it while it is on her he must only bathe, nothing more. He asserted that the time of twilight does not receive impurity, i.e., during this period of time a person cannot become unclean. 3!33 ■ג Literally, rupting the womb. 31 34' This is how al-Qirqisânï understands the Hebrew word מחתרת, as is proved by the following נקב and עקבה; the interpretation now accepted is "act of breaking in." 3'3 Lev. 1.15 requires wringing of the neck only. .פי אלצחרא 3,63,6 3'' In a broad sense, including the courtyard.</page><page sequence="72">388 LEON NEMOY [72] Chapter XV ACCOUNT OF THE EVIL DOINGS OF ISMÀ'ÏL AL-'UKBARÏ Ismâ'ïl al-'Ukbarï denied the Ketîb318 and the Qerî and asserted that the Scripture must be read just as it is written; a contra dictory saying, however, is attributed to him to the effect that he asserted that some things in the Scripture were not (originally) as they are now written. For instance, the passage [Gen. 4.8]: "And Cain said to Abel," he said that after this there was written: "Come, let us go out in the field;" (also about the passage) [Ex. 20.18]: "And all the people saw the voices," he said that it was (originally written) "heard the voices," since voices can only be heard and not seen. We have said above that this opinion is held also by the Samaritans, so perhaps he heard it and took it over from them. He said that the passage [Ex. 16.35]: "And the children of Israel have eaten the mannah" should be read "will eat," since at the time of this passage they had not yet eaten it for forty years. Also about the passage [Gen. 46.15]: "The number of his sons and daughters was thirty three," he said it (really) was thirty two, so that this is a mistake of the scribe. According to him, the time of the birth of the new moon, which is the time of its separation from the sun, should be considered the beginning of the (new) month and at that time the prayer and the sacrifice319 should begin, even if it precedes the sunset by an hour.320 He allowed consuming on the Sabbath foods prepared on the Sabbath by people of other faiths, e. g., roasted egg-plants, or fruits plucked on the Sabbath, etc. He is the author of many (other) sayings that are harmful, shameful, and absurd to the utmost degree. Yet in his writings he treats Anan in the most insulting manner, attributing to him the stupidity of an ass. We have said above that he commanded his followers to write upon his tomb: "The chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof." 318 Read כתיב. 3,9 Of the ritual of the first of the new month. 320 The Semitic twenty four hours beglin with sunset.</page><page sequence="73">[73] AL-QIRQISÂNÏ'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 389 Chapter XVI ACCOUNT OF ABU 'IMRÂN AL-TIFLÏSÏ AND MALIK AL-RAMLÏ We have said above that neither one of them composed any book of laws. They differed from the general body (of the sectarians?) only in a few (minor) things, e. g., the (fixing of the) Pentecost on Sunday, the prohibition of the fat-tail and of the root of the tail321 and (the prohibition of marrying) the daughter of the brother and the daughter of the sister, etc. As for al-Tiflïsï, he also considered the time of the separation (of the moon from the sun to be the beginning of the new month), just as Ismâ'Il (al-'Ukbari) did, but he differed from him inasmuch as he fixed the beginning of the month on the beginning of the day on which the separation takes place. He is the author of (a book of) replies to questions submitted to him, as he asserted, by Hayyawayh;322 he is also the author of a pamphlet323 on the admissibility of (eating) meat. As for Malik al-Ramli, it is said that he stood up on (the location of) the Temple (in Jerusalem) and took an oath to the effect that cocks used to be sacrificed upon its altar, i. e., the altar of God. This is an action of a stupid person. Chapter XVII ACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCES OF MISHAWAYH This is also one of the stupid dissenters. He permitted (the con sumption of) the fat of the daily sacrifices; I, as well as other people, thought that he was the first to hold this opinion, but one of the elders of the Ukbarites informed me that he took it over from some of the people of Jibâl;324 this is not improbable, for many (absurd) things are invented among the people of Jibal; "נ Read ואלעכוה (Rosen). 322 This is probably the correct pronunciation of this name ; it occurs in the Jewish sources in a shortened form ,חיו.

Mishawayh used to assert that Pentecost must fall on Sunday, but he did not know on which Sunday; this is also the opinion of some of the people of Basra, but he differed from them inasmuch as he celebrated the feast on the same day with the general body (of the sectarians?). He asserted that the feast of Passover must always be(gin) on Thursday, so that the day of Atonement might fall on the Sabbath, since it325 is called [Lev. 23.32]: Shabbât Shabbâtôn, meaning, according to him, a double Sabbath, one the (regular) Sabbath, and the other the (Sabbath of) Atonement. He was in doubt as to how to fix the beginning of months, since he could not decide what system to adopt. It is said that he used to say to his followers: "All money is unreliable; stick, then, to the counterfeit coin that you have on hand!"—he meant the festivals of the general body (of the sectarians?). He asserted that no sacrifices whatsoever should be offered during the Sabbath, and that the passage of the Scripture [Num. 28.10]: "The burnt offering of each Sabbath on its Sabbath," 326 means "for its Sabbath," so that it was offered before the Sabbath for the Sabbath. He asserted that everywhere the direction (for prayer) should be towards the West, excepting those who are in Egypt and in the Maghrib, who should turn during prayer towards Jerusalem.327 Chapter XVIII ACCOUNT OF the DIFFERENCES OF daniel AL-damaghânï First, he was opposed to speculation by means of pure reason, and he despised its devotees ; this is to be found in more than one place in his writings. He did not have the same idea of the angels as the people of Israel have, that is to say, that they are living beings endowed with the gift of speech, who are being sent out on missions in the same way as the prophets.

He prohibited the blood of fish, and he did not allow (the eating of) any locusts, except the four kinds mentioned (in the Torah) by their (special) names. He forbade sexual intercourse during (the latter part of?) the night, lest one should miss the (morning-) prayer. He admitted that (the laws concerning) contraction of impurity through contact with a leprous person are still in force. It is said about him that he used to say that laws are obligatory (only) upon persons (at least) twenty years old. He prohibited some things during the Sabbath,328 e. g., washing the hands with alkali, etc. He forbade (lighting) lamps during the nights of holidays, just as329 the general body (of sectarians?) forbid it during Sabbath-nights. He asserted that the passage of the Scripture [Lev. 1.15]: "And he shall wring its neck" refers to an action posterior to the slaughtering (proper). 330 It is said about him that he used to accept the testimony of Moslems concerning the appearance of the new moon. These are all the doctrines of the dissenters who appeared (among the Jews) down to the present time, according to the information which we have received. Some of these sects have disappeared, e. g., the Magharians and the Sadducees; likewise, there are left no more of the followers of Ismâ'ïl al-'Ukbarï, and at the present time no person versed in speculation inclines towards his teaching. As for the Ananites, they are now very few in number, and their number is constantly decreasing. Of the followers of Abu 'Isa al-Isfahànï only about twenty persons are left in Damascus. A small number of the Yudghanites still remain in Isfahan. On the other hand, among our coreligionists disagree ment has greatly increased.

Some of them forbid one to bring in trays (with food) or to make the bed on the Sabbath; when anyone (of them) wishes to eat he goes to the place where the food is kept. Others allow the bringing in of trays and the making of the bed on that day, but forbid one to remove them, as the serving of a tray (with food) and the making of the bed are necessities of the Sabbath, whereas their removal is not a necessity (which cannot wait). Some of them think that it is unlawful to put on a trousers-band on the Sabbath. Some allow one to prepare on the Sabbath for use after the Sab bath all that which is allowed to be prepared on the Sabbath for use on the same day, e. g., cooling water, etc.; this is the opinion of some of the people of Bagdad. Some of them do not allow keeping food hot until the approach of the Sabbath, but let it get cold before the Sabbath comes in ; they assert that if it is left hot some (internal) changes, expansion and contraction, take place in it during the Sabbath ; this is the opinion of some of the people of Tustar, but others deny it and even allow the preservation of hot food in straw for use on the Sabbath. Some do not allow cooking or baking on any of the holidays with the sole exception of the feast of Passover; they assert that the exception applies to this feast only, and not to any other. I have been told that there appeared in Tustar some people who allow on holidays only that which is allowed on the Sabbath; they assert331 that the passage of the Scriptures [Ex. 12.16]: "Only what is to be eaten for every one" corresponds (exactly) to the passage [ibid., 16.25]: "Eat it to-day." 332 Some of them 333 begin 331 Read ויזעמון. 332 The first passage concerns the feast of Passover; the second deals with the mannah gathered on Friday which is to be preserved and eaten during the Sabbath. Apparently from the similarity of the expressions they inferred that the same laws govern the Sabbath and the holidays. 333 Evidently, the Palestinian Karaites.</page><page sequence="77">[77] AL-QIRQISÂNÎ'S ACCOUNT OF THE JEWISH SECTS 393 the "(month of the) fresh ears" (with the appearance) of (any kind of) green herbage, whereas others do not begin it until (fresh) garden-cress is found all over Palestine; others begin it only when (at least) one piece of ground becomes ready for harvest;334 still others begin it even when only a handful of corn is ready for harvest. Some of them think that it is unlawful to go out of one's dwelling during the Sabbath, others think that it is unlawful to remove even an inanimate object333 from the place where it lies to another place (during the Sabbath), even if there is no separation or distance between the two places ; some, however, allow it. Some of them allow putting on a seal-ring on the Sabbath, others forbid it on the Sabbath as well as on holidays. Some of them allow the acceptance of even a single person's testimony concerning the appearance of the new moon, others do not receive the testimony of less than two witnesses. Some of the people of Bagdad fix the time of the "month of the fresh ears" on the basis of (the growth of grain in) a certain place in Bagdad ; they assert that it336 was tested and was found to be the same as (the time of the growth of grain in) Palestine. 337 Some of them (fix the beginning of the new month in the following manner:) if they look out for the new moon on (the night of) the twenty ninth and do not see it, but then see it in the (following) daytime, they fix the beginning of the (new) month on that day;338 others think that this is unlawful.

Some of them see nothing unlawful in a person's failure to eat any unleavened bread during the seven days (of Passover), provided that he has not eaten any leavened either, whereas others think that it is obligatory to eat it each day (of the feast). Some of them assert that the twilight time belongs entirely to the (preceding) daytime, whereas others insist that it all belongs to the morrow; still others assert that it belongs both to the (preceding) daytime and to the morrow, as Anan says. Some of them think that the Sabbath expires with the sunset, whereas others assert that the Sabbath ends only with the disappearance of daylight. Some of them allow one to read on the Sabbath any writing other than Hebrew, others forbid it. Some of them allow the consumption in the exile of meat of sheep and cattle, others forbid it. Some of them allow us to eat fish that had died in the hands of people of different creed, others forbid it. Some of them allow us to consume a whole boiled kid, others forbid it, for they assert that its fat gets cooked with it. Some of them allow us to consume (meat of) animals slaughtered by members of the general body (of sectarians?), whereas others forbid it. Some of them allow poultry, some forbid it, and some say that they do not know whether it is lawful or not. Some of them allow us to consume eggs of clean birds, others forbid it. Some of them forbid (the use of the fat of) the belly340 and of the anus,341 i. e., the hind parts. 3 42 and also the fat of the lungs; all this in addition to all the kinds of fat (forbidden by the Torah) ; this is the opinion of some of the people of Basra and Fars, but others do not forbid it. Some of them allow a person to receive medical treatment from people of different creed, provided that the treatment takes place in the presence of the patient;3 43 others forbid it.

Some of them require a daily noon prayer, others require such a prayer on fast-days only. Some of them assert that if (the first night of) Passover falls on a Sabbath night the feast should be transferred to the next month. Some of them think that it is unlawful to use hot water in ablutions from impurity, others think that it is lawful.344 Some of them allow the performance of ablutions from impurity only with stagnant water, whereas others do it only with spring-water. The above mentioned Karaites of Basra assert that the feast of Pentecost must fall only on Sunday, but they do not know on which Sunday; some of them assert that it is no longer obligatory, others assert that all the holidays are no longer obligatory, but ought to be kept merely as memorial days. Some of the Karaites of Syria assert that on a self imposed fast-day one may abstain from a single kind of food only. Some of the Karaites of Khorasan do not recognize the Ketib and the Qeri and read (the Torah) just as it is written; some of these Karaites do so even with the (Holy) name which is written yod-hë ; they assert that whoever reads it as (if it were written) alef-daleth3 45 is a heretic. Among the Karaites of Khorasan and Jibal there are some who assert that the promised Messiah had already come and passed away, also that the temple (which the Jews hope to build) is the one built by Zerubbabel and that there is going to be no other. Some of these Karaites also deny the resurrection of the dead and assert that whatever the Scripture says about it (really) means the restoration of the (Jewish) people from the captivity and humilia tion. Some of the people of Bagdad assert that Enoch and Elijah died, for it is impossible that they should have ascended to heaven. Among the people of Basra and Tustar there are some who assert that it is unlawful to put on sandals or boots on the Sabbath without any (urgent) need, also to put on more than a single shirt or an over-cloak3 46 or any other piece of clothing for which there is no urgent need, like a girdle, etc. Some of them allow one to extinguish a fire on the Sabbath if one had forgotten tr&gt; rlr&gt; sn hpfnrp thp Sahha th in fart־ thpv think thai it is nhlicratnrv • נ«« One לא is to be expunged. 3« i. e., איך. 3 4' Xhe second אלנעל seems to be a dittography.</page><page sequence="80">396 LEON NEMOY [80] likewise, they assert that a person must stop the water which irrigates the fields on the Sabbath if he had forgotten to stop it before the Sabbath; for the same reason they allow to stop the mills347 on the Sabbath, lest they should be grinding on the Sabbath. Strangely enough, they allow, in fact they require, working and moving about during the Sabbath and forbid any recreation and rest. In some doubtful things they disagree, some prescribe them and some do not. They disagree in regard to the question whether a major impurity absorbs a minor one, some think it does, and some think it does not. They disagree in regard to the question whether a dead body renders a house unclean, some think it does, and some think it does not. They disagree in regard to the case of a man who failed to perform an ablution at the time prescribed for it by the Scripture: some allow him to perform this ablution at any time, whereas some allow it only at a corresponding time (of the day). They disagree concerning the duty of the proselyte to sit in the booth, 348 some think it is obligatory, others think it is not. These are the differences that I could remember. The matter becomes worse day by day. Perhaps some of our coreligionists, upon reading this, will blame us for mentioning these differences, since some of the Rabbanites may use them as a counter-argument whenever we blame them for the differences between the people of Syria and the people of Babylonia. But let it not trouble your hearts, neither should you pay any attention to it. For it is they whom this accusation of contradiction fits, since they assert that all they have on hand had been received from (men of) prophecy. But were it really so, no controversy whatsoever should have arisen; thus, the very fact of this controversy contradicts their assertion. We, however, arrive at our knowledge (of the laws) by the mere deduction of our reason: since this is so, it cannot be denied that controversy may possibly arise. We will mention later the proofs adduced by various dissenters both for and against the necessity of speculation of this kind. Now let us conclude this part with (the help of) the might and power of God. Blessed be the Lord forever. Amen.

To note 38.—The correctness of this statement has been questioned (cf. Ginzberg, Geonica, I, pp. 158-9; Davidson, Mahzor Yannai, pp. xliv—xlv) on the following grounds: 1. the Karaite Yûsuf al-Bàsir, in his Kitab al-Istibsar, quoting this very passage, reads "from the Nabatean into the Arabic;" 2. a Rabbanite gaon would hardly try to popularize a Karaite work; 3. the Jews at that time understood Aramaic as well as, or even better than, Flebrew. The first objection is meaningless, since it is fully nullified by the second; besides, a Karaite would hardly call the Aramaic language Nabatean. The second and third objections presume that Fiai and his father prepared their translation for publication broadcast, and not as a mere source-book for their own private use and study; there is no ground for such a presumption, espe cially as such private source-books were widely used by scholars and students of the Moslem world. To note 39.—Harkavy (Studien und Mitteilungen, V, 1891, p. 108, note 4) thinks that חזאנה is an arabicized form of חזנית, which he explains as equivalent to פיוט, without, however, giving documentary evidence of such a usage. Until such evidence is furnished it is safer to accept the obvious derivation from the Arabic חזאנה ;חזן is, then, a sad, melancholy poem, an elegy (Latin triste, pl. tristia). To note 335.—Since this translation was made, I have had an opportunity to examine the use of the word מסבת in the fifth part of the Book of Lights, dealing with the Sabbath laws. There can now be no further doubt of the meaning of this word, as used by al-Qirqisànï; it means a person, a thing, or a place subject to the laws governing Sabbath. The translation of the passage should, accordingly, read as follows: Others think that it is unlawful to remove (anything) from one place to another, also (situated within the area) governed by the laws of Sabbath, even if there is no separation or distance between the two places.</page></plain_text>
