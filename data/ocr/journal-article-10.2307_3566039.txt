From a priori reasoning and the integration of many experimental observations, a new, ecologically hased scheme is derived to explain the way in which plant growth and resource partitioning is broadly controlled by external environmental conditions. We suggest that the partitioning of resources between below- and above-ground plant parts is jointly controlled by the absolute amounts of below- and above-ground envi- ronmental stress, by the below-/above-ground environmental stress ratio, and by the growth potential of the species itself. Under particular conditions, any shortfall from the species's innate growth potential may be explained in terms of the total of, and ra- tio between, below- and above-ground stress. Hyperbolic relationships link the vari- ables under consideration. Though the equations ultimately derived are not open to straightforward experimental validation, they are likely to be of value in predicting 'perceived stress' both above- and below-ground, as an experiment involving three contrasted species indicates.

Introduction It has been known since Roman times that the total growth achieved and the relative sizes of the above- and below-ground parts of plants are both strongly influen- ced by external environmental conditions (Crist and Stout 1929). They also depend upon innate properties of the organism. For partitioning, in particular, ecologi- cally meaningful variation has been observed when sam- pling natural vegetation (Bray 1963, Monk 1966). Ex- perimental evidence clearly confirms that changes in many individual external conditions, or levels of re- source, have a consistent and predictable influence on the allocation of plant size (however defined) into above-ground parts ('shoot') and below-ground parts ('root'). Ledig and Perry (1965) and Hunt and Burnett (1973) listed many references and reviews in this field. The general picture which has emerged is that any growth limiting condition or resource (in the classical sense of being one which will bring about a sustained in- crease in plant performance if it alone is alleviated arti- fically) will also induce a change in the resource parti- tioning of the plant. This will result in proportionally in- creased allocation of linear size, number or mass in favour of that part of the plant which draws most upon the growth limiting part of the environment. As plain examples: nutrient limited plants commonly become more rooty, shaded plants, more shooty. One benefit of plants' plasticity in this respect is that over an often wide range of growth limiting environ- mental conditions all species thus far examined appear able to achieve a relatively 'damped' variation in the balance between their internal constituents. The car- bon:nitrogen ratio and the dry weight concentration of certain mineral elements, for example, show this kind of stability. This form of partial homeostasis arises because rates of assimilation or uptake per unit of plant mate- rial, when lowered as a result of externally imposed lim- itations, can be compensated (sometimes wholly) by in- creases in the size of the affected section of the plant relative to the remainder (Davidson 1969, Hunt and Burnett 1973, Hunt 1975, Hunt et al. 1975, Richards 1977, Richards Goubran and Collins 1979). Formal, dynamic, deterministic models of the gross physiological processes which determine such patterns of growth and partitioning already exist (Thornley 1972, 1976, Cooper and Thornley 1976). Also, the adaptive significance of variation in growth potential has been discussed by Grime and Hunt (1975) and the wider eco- logical relevance of plasticity in root-shoot partitioning was explored by Grime (1974, 1977, 1979) in connection with his C-S-R concept of plant strategies. The present contribution is intermediate between these levels of ap- proach. It formalizes a general and ecologically based hypothesis for the way in which root-shoot partitioning in herbaceous plants appears to be influenced simulta- neously by the below-ground/above-ground balance of external environmental conditions and by the growth potential of the plant itself. It also assesses the influence of these on the growth achieved over all. 2. Definition of concepts 2.1. Root-shoot partitioning The instantaneous ratio between root and shoot size (however defined) in any individual plant is simulta- neously subject to genetic, ontogenetic and environ- mental control (Ledig and Perry 1965, Hunt and Burnett 1973). In many ecological studies, therefore, the most useful broad measure of partitioning is not this instantaneous ratio but the ratio of mean relative growth rates over an extended period of time, the al- lometric coefficient. For mass, this is the ratio between the mean values of the rates (1/Rw) (dRw/dT) and (1/Sw) (dSw/dT) where Rw and Sw are root and shoot dry weights respectively and T is time (notation follows Evans 1972 and Hunt 1982: capitals for primary vari- ables, bold if derived). The allometric coefficient is commonly evaluated as the slope of the linear regres- sion of In Rw on In Sw over the whole period under study. Pearsall (1927) and Troughton (1955) pioneered allometric analysis in plant science; a full, modern ex- planation and review has been given by Causton and Venus (1981). If root and shoot mean relative growth rates are nota- ted RR and Rs, respectively, then the root-shoot al- lometric coefficient for the plant may be defined as Kp = RR/RS. Thus constituted, Kp is relatively stable, often sufficiently so to represent the whole of the vegetative phase of growth with serious loss of information - yet it remains responsive to genetic and environmental influ- ences. Kp is thus a convenient partitioning ratio. 2.2. The balance of external environmental conditions The environmental control of plant growth may be viewed either positively or negatively. In the positive mode, external conditions (such as meteorological vari- ables) and resources (such as substances which enter the plant) - both 'factors' in the sense used by Lockhart (1965) - promote whole-plant growth to a degree de- pendent on their 'availability'. Viewed negatively, the same external factors inhibit the plant, to a greater or lesser degree according to their level, by preventing it from achieving its optimal performance. In many ways, the latter view is more apposite when considering envi- ronmental influences on Kp, provided that the concept of an optimal performance is acceptable. Provided, too, that the concept of environmental stress can be taken as representing a deviation in either direction from the 'ideal' combination or combinations of factors which would be non-limiting in all classical respects. In this sense, the environment promoting the maximum long- term plant performance (however defined) would be an environment of zero stress in respect of that perform- 150 OIKOS 47:2 (1986)</page><page sequence="3">ance. Here the concept of stress concurs with that of Grime (1977): 'the external constraints which limit the rate of dry-matter production of all or part of the veg- etation.' Stress is thus a negotiable quantity of value to the present theoretical scheme. Further, it is undeserving of Harper's (1982) lampoon: 'what I don't think I would like if I was a buttercup ... etc.', with its unnecessarily anthropomorphic overtones. But it is important to re- member that there can be no simple proportionality be- tween this stress and the measured levels of external factors, since all of these can be shown ultimately to op- erate on a continuum which induces sub-optimal, opti- mal and supra-optimal responses from the plant - though many (for all practical purposes) display only two of these three. Interactions also operate (how much stress is implied by a particular level of a particular fac- tor will depend partly upon the current levels of other factors) and the position of zero stress is species-de- pendent (different species will find the same combi- nation of factors unequally stressful). There are at least two ways of modelling these con- cepts. One is to map a stress axis rigidly onto the con- tinuum for each external factor being studied, perhaps defining this as the mean derived from data for all avail- able species. This is close to the engineering concept of stress (e.g. Gordon 1968). Any particular non-zero value of stress will then have different influences on dif- ferent species, each's reaction being analogous to an en- gineering strain. Further, a modulus or index of stress- tolerance (again an engineering concept) can then be defined for each species, the ratio stress:strain. How- ever, this method falls foul of the very considerable in- teractions between the effects of different factors in the plant environment. These are too numerous and com- plex to be taken into account as in the simple engi- neering experiment of making (say) Young's modulus dependent upon (say) temperature. A second method of quantifying reactions to particu- lar environmental experiences is to assume that all spe- cies have a modulus of exactly one. Under these special conditions, stress and strain become equal and effec- tively synonymous. Stress, which is now impossible to predict directly from the external environment, can be inferred from strain, which can readily be assessed pro- vided it causes a diminution or other change in plant performance. In this method, different species will still find identical external conditions unequally stressful, which is in agreement with expectation. The first approach, despite being a close analogue of a pre-existing treatment and yielding a modulus of po- tentially great value is difficult or impossible to imple- ment in the context of plant-environment relations. The second approach, which also has the advantage of in- volving fewer terms, is thus the one followed here. Archer (1979) has pointed out that the concepts of stress and strain have, either singly or together, been used by biologists in ways which are variously analo- gous, reversed or different from their usage by engi- neers. Here they are used analogously, but with the spe- cial local conditions of (a) being measured in identical units (as proportional departures from an optimal con- dition) and of (b) having a modulus of unity. Deviation from optimality is clearly an interesting index of stress in the plant environment. In passing, it can be recalled that the broad difference between stress and disturbance in Grime's analysis is that, though both are deleterious to the production of biomass, stress operates prior to, disturbance subse- quently to, this production. Only stress is part of our scheme at present. If RSI and Ss, are artificial stress indices of the root and shoot environments respectively, then an environmen- tal stress ratio may be constructed: KE = Rsi/Ss,. Like Kp, this is a root-shoot ratio, and may again be consid- ered as operating over substantial intervals of time, the degree of approximation involved being linked to the degree of temporal variability of RsI and/or Ss~. A stress total, S, may be defined as Rsi + Ssi. 2.3. The growth potential of the plant Relative growth rate (in whole-plant dry weight, W, where W = Rw + Sw) is an index of the functional effi- ciency of the plant which allows equable comparisons of growth (a) between species of differing absolute size, (b) within the life-cycle of a single species, and (c) be- tween different environmental treatments applied to the same species. Instantaneously defined as (1/W) (dW/ dT), the relative growth rate has a mean value, R, over a period of destructive harvesting which may be evalu- ated as the slope of the linear regression of In W on T. The value of R under zero stress is the plant's growth potential, Rmax, a parameter conceptually indistinguish- able from the r of r-K theory (MacArthur and Wilson 1967, Pianka 1970). However, it is technically distinct since the basis of calculation is different. For an envi- ronment in which the plant achieves a mean relative growth rate of R, the ratio R/Rmax may be termed the at- tainment ratio. 3. Interlinkage of concepts 3.1. The principal hypotheses These are that (a) the partitioning ratio is controlled jointly by the environmental stress total, by the balance of stress between the above-ground and below-ground environments and by the species' own growth potential, and that (b) the attainment ratio also is regulated by the first two of these. A combination of a priori reasoning and the experimental observations cited in Sect. 1 sug- gests the following collection of assumptions as the starting-point for a formal model. OIKOS 47:2 (1986) 151</page><page sequence="4">3.2. Assumption in words (1) At zero stress total the species' partitioning ratio is characteristic of its growth potential and lies near unity (Grime and Hunt 1975). It does not necessarily equal unity since most vascular species have evolved an internal composition the creation of which does not require equal deployment of mass in the exploi- tation of the above- and below-ground environ- ments. The attainment ratio is unity since there is no stress. (2) Under a finite stress total, but with a stress ratio equal to unity, the partitioning ratio assumed by (1) is also achieved, since opposing stresses have a coun- teractive effect on partitioning (Hunt 1975); how- ever, the attainment ratio is reduced (Hunt and Burnett 1973). (3) If the stress ratio departs from unity in either direc- tion then the partitioning ratio moves in the same di- rection (Hunt and Burnett 1973), and to a degree controlled by the species's growth potential (Grime and Hunt 1975). (4) Uniformly changing stress ratios, moving in either direction, produce less than proportional changes in the partitioning ratio; for all practical purposes the stress ratio may become infinitely large or small but, a priori, the partitioning ratio may not since the phe- notype is not infinitely plastic. (5) The influence of stress ratio on partitioning ratio is, also a priori, greatly diminished as stress total ap- proaches zero since high ratios between negligible stresses are irrelevant. (6) The attainment ratio is regulated by the stress total, but is also diminished by departures from unity in the stress ratio on the premise that near-optimal per- formance requires factors to exhibit a finely-balan- ced set of levels, as well as contributing an abso- lutely adequate set of conditions. 3.3. The same assumptions in mathematics (1) When Rs, = Ss, = 0: KE = 1; Kp = f, (Rmax) - 1; R/ Rmax = 1. (2) When Rs, = Ss, #0: KE = 1; Kp = f, (R,ma) - 1; R/ Rmax = f2 (S). (3) When Rs, i Ss,; Kp = f, (Rmax) and f3 (KE). (4) f3 (KE) is an hyperbolic function. (5) effective KE = f4 (KE, S). (6) R/Rmax = f2 (S) and f5 (effective KE). 4. Implementation of the model 4.1. Partitioning First, consider assumptions (3) and (4). Neglecting the influence of Rmax, the centre of the theory is that Kp is controlled by KE; these lie in the range 0 &lt; Kp, KE &lt; + oo, with a 'principal zone of operation' near to 1.

(1): the dependence of the root/shoot partitioning ratio upon the environmental root/shoot stress ra- tio, seen in relation to three levels of total environmental stress (S) and three (standardized) values of growth potential (Rmax). logarithms standardizes this range to -oo &lt; Kp, KE &lt; + co, with most activity around zero. In this transformed state, f3 could be any of a number of mathematical func- tions which satisfies the assumption: for greatest parsi- mony the hyperbolic sine, sinh, has been selected. The equation log Kp = sinh-1 (log KE) produces the appropri- ate type of curve (see the central curve in Fig. l(b)). For natural logarithms this simple relationship may other- wise be written Kp- 1/Kp = 2 In KE, or (RR/Rs) - (Rs/RR) = 2 In (Rs/ISsi). Second, this relationship must be modified to remove an anomaly. Large KE is irrelevant at very small Rs, and Ss,, but becomes increasingly important as either or both of the stress levels rises. Some linkage to total stress, S, is therefore necessary by way of f4. Since the range 0 &lt; S &lt; + oo has no clear 'central zone', the hyper- bolically-transformed range 0 &lt; tanh S &lt; 1 provides an appropriate modifier of the control of Kp by KE. This may now be written In Kp = sinh-' (In KE - tanh S). The central curve of each group of three given in Fig. 1 (a)- OIKOS 47:2 (1986) 1  152</page><page sequence="5">(c) shows, in sequence, that as S declines Kp becomes progressively less responsive to KE. Third, the function f1 (involving Rmax) can be expected to influence both the value of Kp at KE = 1 and the slope of the curve at this point. These two influences may be subdivided f,a and fb. The screening experiments of Grime and Hunt (1975) provide the largest available body of data on intrinsic rates of growth of herbaceous species for, neglecting woody species and those not grown from seed, values of R for growth in a standardized, productive environment over the period 2-5 wk after germination are available there for 114 temperate herbaceous species. While not universally equivalent to Rmax, because of the likelihood of slight above-ground stress (principally suboptimal light and temperature), these values of R are believed to remain broadly acceptable to the present exercise. Re- calculated from Grime and Hunt's example of 114 spe- cies, the bivariate principal axis (Sokal and Rohlf 1981) may be used to construct the function fa,: In Kp = -0.089 + 0.212 In Rmax (week-1). This regression accounts for only 9.1 percent of the variation, but is significant at P &lt;0.001. The grand mean of Kp (back- transformed) is 0.930, attained at an Rmax of 1.088 week-' The simple assumption that the slope of In Kp versus In KE is steeper for slow-growing species than for fast- growing ones leads to the choice of 1/Rmax for fl.b But of course, this will be linked to stress totals and instances may be found in which fast-growing species exhibit the steeper slope because their 'perception' of stress is more sensitive (see later). Combining f, (parts (a) and (b)), f3 and f4 we may write sinh-' (In KE * tanh S) ln Kp = a + b ln Rmax x Rmax (1) The slope parameter, b, may be taken from the fore- going 'large sample' regression of In Kp on In Rmax (at In KE = 0), and a may be given the value of -0.072. This is an adjusted intercept parameter from the same regres- sion, after standardizing the sample mean Rmax to 1.0 (producing a very small change, given the original units of measurement). Specimen solutions of Eq. (1) for plants of average, fifth-average and twice-average growth potential appear in each part of Fig. 1. 4.2. Attainment First, departures from unity in KE can, at high S, be ex- pected to influence R/Rmax markedly. But, taken alone, high KE will never entirely extinguish R; function f4 will operate, too. The hyperbolic secant, sech (= 1/cosh), thus provides the simplest possible foundation for f5.

(2): the dependence of the (stressed/ unstressed) attainment ratio upon total environmental stress, seen in relation to six levels of environmental root/shoot or shoot/root stress ratio (absolute values of In KE). The equation R/Rmax = sech (ln KE * tanh S) yields a bell-shaped curve symmetrical about KE = 1. Second, f2 (the separate influence of S on R/Rm,) is most straightforwardly incorporated as 1/(1 + S), which -&gt; 0 as S -&gt; oo. Combining f2, f4 and f, we may write sech (In KE · tanh S) RRmax 1 + I+S (2) Eq. (2) is illustrated in Fig. 2 where curves are given for five values of abs (In KE). In summary, appreciable values of S are required be- fore the control of R/Rmax by KE can operate, and high S of itself also diminishes R/Rmax. 5. The model and its properties It is clear that Eqs (1) and (2) together provide a suc- cessful first representation of assumptions (1)-(6). The three hyperbolic relationships, though arbitrary in de- gree, are correct in kind. They provide biologically plausible linkages between cause and effect since they incorporate in several places the important principle of diminishing returns, yet do not constrain any of the plant variables to finite limiting values or to intercepts which are not abundantly self-evident. The combined behaviour of the two equations in re- spect of the five variables R, Rmax, S, KE and Kp is illus- trated in Fig. 3. The units of total stress, S, are ulti- mately arbitrary and are defined in terms of the meas- ured variables Kp, R and Rmax; Kp is a dimensionless ratio, similarly derived. In respect of Kp, this illustration encompasses and transcends, without instability, the known limits of plant adaptation (values in the range of 0.1 &lt; &lt; &lt; 10 appear in Fig. 3, whereas real examples outside the range 0.3 &lt; Kp &lt; 3 are uncommon).

The attainment ra- tio, R/R,maX was derived from the experimental R and from the values for Rmax given by Grime and Hunt (1975). Estimates of the standard error for this ratio were obtained using Fieller's Theorem (Finney 1964). These estimates of attainment ratio and partitioning ra- tio were substituted into Eqs (1) and (2) to provide es- timates of stress, stress total and root-shoot stress ratio. Details of the solution of these two equations are given in Sect. 6. 8.

The influence of the reduced nutrient concentration on the partitioning and attainment ratios was very clear. The partitioning ratio increased as the level of nutrient stress increased; associated with this there was a reduc- tion in attainment ratio. In the slow-growing D. flexu- osa, a clear optimum for attainment was achieved at the second nutrient level, i.e. at 20% of the 'full' concen- tration. At the lowest nutrient concentrations, 0.8 and 0.16%, the attainment ratios in the two faster-growing species, P. annua and H. lanatus, were lower: 0.4-0.5 compared with values for D. flexuosa in the range 0.6- 0.8. Progressively declining light levels produced less clear sequences of lowered attainment and increased partitioning (to the shoot). The light series was plainly less stressful to all three species than the nutrient series, with attainments declining to little lower than 0.7.

However, at full light and full nutrients, P. annua perceived near-zero stress, while for H. lanatus there was no combination of light and nutrient treatments that gave values of stress very close to zero. Variation among treatments and spe- cies was roughly constant between root and aerial pha- ses of the environment. The pattern of estimated environmental stress ratios was similar for each species, with reducing nutrient con- centrations in full light showing progressively higher ra- tios, thereby indicating greater stress in the root than in the shoot environment. In contrast, the declining light levels in full nutrient solution showed values of KE for H. lanatus which were less than unity, thereby indica- ting greater stress in the aerial environment, though the serial effect was not strong. Values of KE close to unity appeared for D. flexuosa, with P. annua showing values in between. 9. Discussion onse of all species to the 'diagonal' series of treat- Two important questions may be asked: first, is the mo- ts, where light and nutrients were reduced together, del successful in providing a realistic set of estimates of tended to depend upon the nutrient effect more S and KE from these experimental data; second, do the light. Again, a more complex pattern of re- these estimates assist in the ecological interpretation of ises was displayed by D. flexuosa, which at first species responses to environmental conditions or in an ved a reduction, not an increase, in the partitioning interpretation of innate differences between species? ) relative to the full-light, full-nutrient treatment. The first question addresses the validity of the model. he levels of 'perceived stress' were very different for Clearly it is not possible to achieve a wholly formal val- three species (Figs 4 and 5). For D. flexuosa in the idation by conducting a comparison of predicted and onal series, the maximum stress total (root plus measured estimates of all of the variables in the study. )t) lay near 0.6 units, compared with values around Stress, even accepting Grime's (1979) viewpoint, is not a measurable variable against which predicted values can be compared. The estimates of S and KE obtained s units for the experiment using the model proposed here are thus products of the assumptions, both explicit and im- plicit, on which the model is based. In contrast, the es- (a) (b) timates of Kp and R/Rmax are derived from the perform- ance of the species under the environmental conditions experienced during the experiment and are not depend- o &gt;°_ ent upon the model itself. Validation, therefore, rests upon whether or not the predicted values of S and KE _~~~~/ // _ are credible in relation to Kp, R/Rmax and the nature of the experimental environments. _- // _ The trends in Kp described here follow the expected X/yI~ /O/ t.^ pattern: conditions that imposed a stress within the root - G° ^ A ^ / environment (i.e. reduced nutrient concentration) stim- g 0: ^ / ^ ^° ^ulated a greater allocation to the root components in all - 8O - species.

Predicted levels of (a) stress in the aerial environment experimental data confirmed that the attainment and (b) stress in the root environment shown in the same ar- partitioning ratios achieved by these plants were influ- ry units for the 'diagonal' series of treatments.

However, the levels of KE predicted from the series 156 OIKOS 47:2 (1986)</page><page sequence="9">of nutrient treatments (Fig. 4) showed an additional im- portant feature. The levels did not increase linearly as the level of nutrient decreased, as might perhaps be ex- pected. Clearly, even a geometrically-increasing nu- trient gradient was not capable of inducing commensur- ate increases in stress ratio for any of the three species, with the response of P. annua (innately the fastest-grow- ing) falling particularly short of a linear increase. This underlines the difficulty, noted at the outset, of map- ping stress axes exactly onto continua of environmental variation. Perhaps the degree of this non-linearity in re- sponse may ultimately be related to environmental vari- ables and species type, but many more than three exam- ples would be necessary for this to be attempted with any certainty. Here the model produced credible results in broad terms, but requires further refinement. Decreases in attainment ratio, R/Rmax, with increasing stress total were virtually linear throughout. In addi- tion, the three species perceived differences in stress to- tals, S, within their common environments which were clearly inversely related to their growth potential. This provides strong support for assumptions (3) and (5). In all, the wholly realistic prediction of S allied to the less than satisfactory outcome for KE indicates that the balance between these two terms in the model is in need of adjustment. In default of any prior information or as- sumptions, the model weighted the two equally. But on the evidence of the present test, the calculation of KE should have been more steeply biased, perhaps as the ratio of the squares of root and shoot stresses. Al- ternatively, the hyperbolic function relating Kp to KE could be adjusted to secure more response in Kp to low KE. In answer to the second question, concerning ecologi- cal relevance, the experimental data reported here, al- beit on the basis of a sample of only three species, pro- vide clear ecological guidelines as to the behaviour of contrasted species undergoing a common series of envi- ronmental experiences. Fig. 4 plainly illustrates that the slow-growing D. flexuosa under conditions of high total and imbalance of stress both partitioned and achieved relatively more than did the fast-growing P. annua un- der the same conditions. It is entirely possible that the former's relatively undepleted attainment was sup- ported, in part, by the high degree of partitioning which occurred in the treatments supplying the highest totals of stress. Holcus lanatus occupied an intermediate posi- tion: partitioning was high, but not so high as in D. flex- uosa, while attainment was lowered, but by less than in P. annua. Assessing proportional shifts both in attain- ment and in partitioning - by comparing the optimal performance with, say, the extreme diagonal treatments - it seems that the 'efficiency' of return for effort, or at- tainment for partitioning, is greatest in D. flexuosa and in H. lanatus. at 1024 and 987 arbitrary units respec- tively, while P. annua lies considerably lower at 780 units. It is possible that other variables from plant strategy theory may be of value in discriminating between D. flexuosa and H. lanatus, which appear to share the com- mon feature of efficient return for partitioning effort while occupying quite different positions on the con- tinuum of innate growth potential. In the C-S-R theory of plant strategies (Grime 1977) the three species used in the present study occupy positions which are some- what typical of, but are by no means extreme variants of, each of the three primary strategies: D. flexuosa is a 'stress tolerator', evolutionarily adapted to high stress and to low disturbance; H. lanatus is a 'competitive rud- eral', adapted to low stress and to moderate disturb- ance; P. annua is a 'ruderal', adapted to low stress and to high disturbance. Though it is perhaps dangerous to generalize from so small sample, even though these spe- cies were deliberately chosen with these contrasted strategies in mind, it seems possible that a high effi- ciency of attainment for partitioning has become a trait which facilitates survival in relatively undisturbed habi- tats, whether environmental stress is high or low. In dis- turbed habitats, any intermittent stresses that are en- countered are likely to be catastrophic, and thus insu- perable by any degree of plasticity on the part of the individual. Other means, such as prompt flowering, may then be employed to increase genetic survival (Grime 1977). Acknowledgements - We are grateful to A. M.
