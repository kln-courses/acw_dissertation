I delivered earlier versions at the Centre for Seventeenth-Century Studies in Durham, England; at the University of Vermont's Faculty Interdisciplinary Seminar; and at the San Francisco MLA session entitled "Canonization and Its Discontents." I am grateful for criticism and comment I received at those talks, and particularly to Joanna Tinker, Alan Bewell, Dick Burt, Phillipe Carrard, Huck Gutman, Jean Howard, Nigel Smith, and Robyn Warhol. Stephen Greenblatt kindly read a draft and made several helpful suggestions. i. I will not attempt to provide a critical overview of new historicism.

In this essay I sometimes link critics with important differences between them and differentiate critics with important links. I do this because I want to trace a certain debility I see arising from the new historicists' tendency to totalize culture prematurely by way of Foucault's concept of power. But it is important to note that there are new historicists and cultural materialists who have tried to break down this notion of power. David Norbrook focuses on oppositional literary and nonliterary writings throughout his wide-ranging and splendid Poetry and Politics in the English Renaissance (London, 1984). Nancy Armstrong and Leonard Tennenhouse's The EVEning of the Renaissance: Milton and the Making of Modern Culture (forthcoming) examines a literary struggle between competing models of family government. Even those works I criticize are by no means utterly dominated by the premature totalization I focus on, and I will feel free to use one new-historicist argument against another without apology. Greenblatt himself, in a brilliant essay entitled "Filthy Rites" ( Daedalus , 3, No. 33 [1982], 1-16), criticizes Bakhtin's premature totalization of early modern culture on the basis of a reading of Rabelais - an argument analogous to the one I will direct toward Foucault and the new historicism. I should also note that my own recent book, A Rational Millennium: Puritan 189</page><page sequence="2">i√ßo English Literary Renaissance extraordinary intellectual interchange. It has established itself in de- partments of literature, in the catalogues of university presses, in new journals like Representations and older ones like ELH and English Literary Renaissance, in cross-disciplinary dialogues with anthropolo- gists and cultural historians, and in transatlantic alliances with British proponents of a "cultural materialism." This institutional description isn't a critique in disguise, for as the new historicists themselves have argued, intellectual movements never float free of institutional life. At the center of new historicism lies a claim that simply could not have been made in the United States twenty years ago with much safety or analytical rigor: that literature does political work. It does not rise above social life to a timeless aesthetic realm, nor does it simply reflect a coherent and hierarchical world view. Rather, it cre- ates models of human identity, gives voice to competing political factions, and works to produce and contain political subversion. In this, literature does not differ in kind from other political practices, but because it forms a material part of that array of verbal and nonver- bal practices we call culture, neither can it simply be reduced to a function of some other practice. I find these arguments quite persuasive, and in fact, they form the theoretical horizon for any sort of literary study I can imagine want- ing to read or write. But new historicist practice is a different matter, and I will criticize it obliquely by posing what might seem at first a rather simple and irrelevant question: why has the new historicism spent so little time examining the radical pamphlet literature of the English Revolution? On the face of things, the writings of the radical republicans, Fifth Monarchists, Levellers, Diggers, Ranters, Quakers, Seekers, and Muggletonians (and other radical writers more difficult to classify) seem like naturals for new historicists - the most striking instance of discursive subversion in early modern England. Several explanations for the neglect come quickly to mind, but they will not stand up. We might say that these pamphlets are not literature in the post-Kantian Utopias of Seventeenth-Century England and America (New York and Oxford, 1987), suffers from many of the weaknesses I discuss in the following pages. Although it does examine noncanoni- cal works (John Eliot's missionary tracts, James Harrington's republican writings), and although it discusses a distinctly nonmonarchical model of political sovereignty, it too implies that the history of the early modern West is a narrative of oppressive, state-administered discipline, and it pays very little attention to the resistance this discipline provoked.</page><page sequence="3">James Holstun 191 sense of noninstrumental imaginative writing, but then again, from a new historicist perspective, neither are Utopia, Astrophil and Stella, and The Tempest . We might say that there has been an academic division of labor between the subject matters proper to departments of literature (humanist writings, courtly literature, drama) and to departments of history and political science (political philosophy, parliamentary rec- ords, pamphlets). But the new historicism argues that such formal distinctions cannot ultimately hold and that the very attempt to draw them produces a compartmentalized academy blind to the interpre- tive methods it applies to its seemingly stable and discrete subject matters. We might see the new historicists' historical /canonic exclu- sion of the English Revolution as a mere fluke: when a group of scholars trained in the conventions of Renaissance literature wish to formulate a program of radical political reinterpretation, they natur- ally turn to the texts with which they are most familiar. But the new historicists (like the old ones, and like idealist critics) are more than willing to stretch forward to Andrew Marvell's poetry of the 1650s and even to Milton's prose and poetry of the 1640s- 1670s, sometimes with nothing more than a brief contextualizing aside to connect them with Donne, Jonson, and Shakespeare. In Voice, Terminal, Echo : Post- modernism and English Renaissance Texts, Jonathan Goldberg promises "a reengagement with the materiality of texts in all their historical contingency, " but finds his key texts (by Spenser, Shakespeare, Her- bert, Marvell, and Milton) contingent only on each other and on a post-structuralist problematic they thematize, not on nonliterary writings and the social history of early modern England. Alan Sin- field's Literature in Protestant England, 1560-1660 also moves from Spenser to Milton, but while he pays some attention to nonliterary writings and to social history, he also tends to read those writings as the vehicles of Calvinist doctrine we can see at work in literary texts. Here, Sinfield comes surprisingly close to conservative American "Protestant poetics," the main difference being that he sees radical English Protestantism as an internally divided and contradictory ide- ology rather than a serenely unified and self-confident world view. The editors of a recent collection (with the promising title of Politics of Discourse : The Literature and History of Seventeenth-Century England) acknowledge the need for a "broader and more comprehensive dis- cussion" of all modes of literary and nonliterary discourse. But they decide to focus on "high culture and poetry . . . because here the</page><page sequence="4">192 English Literary Renaissance most innovative work is currently in progress which may elucidate these broader concerns," and their contributors focus on Donne, Carew, Lucy Countess of Bedford, Shakespeare, Marvell, Milton, and Dry den. 2 This is not to say that the new historicists do not turn to nonliterary texts, but these works typically appear in the traditional role of con- texts for the central literary works, or as emblems introducing some interpretive problematic that a literary text captures in a more com- pelling and self-conscious fashion. Just as an epigraph from Heideg- ger at the opening of a deconstructive essay augurs an aporia right around the pli, so a longish quotation from an exploration narrative, an Elizabethan diary, or a treatise on rhetoric at the opening of a new historicist essay predicts with fair certainty that an analysis of the perplexities of power in some canonical literary work lies ahead. If we bracket new historicist studies focusing on More, Sidney, Spenser, Milton, and the Elizabethan and Jacobean lyric poets and playwrights, only a handful of books and articles remains. The pamphlet wars of the 1640s and 1650s are, for all practical purposes, unreconnoitered territory. In this essay I want to examine this peculiar non-intersection of the new historicism and the radical pamphlet literature of the English Revolution. First I will examine the new historicists' tendency to claim a premature totalization of early modern culture on the basis of an immanent analysis of canonical literary works. Then I will turn to the problems created by their reliance on Michel Foucault's concept of power and their rejection of Marxist concepts of class and history from below. I will then argue that we should supplement our new his- toricist study of individual and high cultural literary self-fashioning (which typically discovers the oppressive social construction of sub- jectivity beneath literary assertions of imaginative autonomy) with a study of popular collective self-fashioning (which would see persons creating an oppositional identity for themselves through collective 2.

In a familiar but regrettable ellision of the Interregnum, the editors of the last volume see "the languages of Stuart England" as a synonym for "seventeenth-century [English] discourse" (p. 3).</page><page sequence="5">James Holstun 193 self-fashioning in language). As an example of such a study, I will conclude with a brief look at the writings of the Ranters, a radical "antinomian" group that flourished in a small way from 1649 to 1651. More generally, my argument is that the new historicism should stop policing so vigilantly the borders between itself and Marxist crit- icism, and should start examining more carefully the voices of popu- lar resistance that become more and more audible at mid-century. To reduce my thesis to a vulgar and typically self-contradictory Ranter slogan: Down with Foucault and Up with Christopher Hill; or, Hill and Foucault One. II I want to begin with a new historicist negative self-definition so frequently repeated that it has become a sort of methodological trope. Louis Adrian Montrose gives a lucid and compressed version: "This emphasis [that of the new historicism] involves a rethinking or wholesale rejection of some prevalent alternative conceptions of liter- ature: as an autonomous aesthetic order that transcends the shifting pressure and particularity of material needs and interests; as a collec- tion of inert discursive reflections of 'real events'; as a superstructural manifestation of an economic base."3 Or in other words, the new historicism rethinks or rejects idealist, old historicist, and "vulgar Marxist" literary criticism. We will begin with the old historicism and return to idealist and Marxist aesthetics later on. New historicist criticism of the old histor- icism (for example, E. M. W. Tillyard's obligingly titled The Eliz- abethan World Picture) has typically focused on its premature con- struction of a deceptively orderly social totality - as Montrose puts it in the same article, on "the nostalgic commentary that misrecognizes the dominant ideology of Tudor-Stuart society - the unreliable ma- 3.

But Tillyard and the new historicists come together at two crucial points. First, both see the familiar canon of English literature as the appropriate place to center a study of early modern culture, no matter how useful "nonliterary" sources may be. Second, both practice what we might call a synecdochic aesthetics. Tillyard sees in The Faerie Queene a universally felt system of order threatened by mutability, while the new historicist sees an oppressive and hierarchical totality governed by the circulation of power and threatened by actual social disorder. But both believe that the work reveals something very like a cultural totality. Despite the new historicists' recurrent claims that we cannot conceptualize culture as an "expressive totality," as a social substance informed by a single idea, they reproduce this model of culture by finding inside the canonic work of art all social distinctions worth describing, all modes of social criticism imaginable. At the end of Renaissance Self-Fashioning, Stephen Greenblatt pauses for a moment of self-reflection and underlines a significant ambiguity in the title of his book: does it focus on the way writers fashioned themselves during the Renaissance, or on the way the Renaissance fashioned selves? "In all my texts and documents, there were, so far as I could tell, no moments of pure, unfettered subjec- tivity; indeed, the human subject itself began to seem remarkably unfree, the ideological product of the relations of power in a particular society. Whenever I focused upon a moment of apparently autono- mous self-fashioning, I found not an epiphany of identity freely chosen but a cultural artifact. If there remained traces of free choice, the choice was among possibilities whose range was strictly deline- ated by the social and ideological system then in force."5 The only choice seems to be between seeing humans as free and sovereign 4.

And seemingly, with some existential regret, we must settle for the latter. Like Uberai humanism, the new historicism has trouble focusing on categories of collective social being that might mediate between free individuality and cultural totality, although unlike lib- eral humanism, it judges totality the victor. The possibility never arises that collective categories such as religion, gender, class, region, and political alignment might be something other than the oppressive construct of a dominant system. Jonathan Goldberg offers another example of the same sort of cultural totalization in James I and the Politics of Literature, although in keeping with his more deconstructive approach, he feels less regret for the loss of the humanist illusion of free subjectivity.6 In this wide- ranging study Goldberg promises to investigate not just Jacobean court life, but Jacobean culture. One might assume that any study of a culture would take as its object not some totality unified from an informing power center, but a material array of dominant and subor- dinate elements - not just the dominant subculture, but also those subordinate subcultures that lie outside its reach, or even resist it. Otherwise, such a study risks allying itself with the totalizing fan- tasies of the dominant subculture by producing a unifying "world picture." But Goldberg works from a different hypothesis, one that we might call "neo-Tillyardian": because the dominant subculture al- ways already anticipates all possible opposition and inscribes that opposition within itself, a cultural study may focus on the dominant alone. Although Goldberg sees a radically different sort of cultural totality than Tillyard's, he does not deny that canonical works and figures capture this totality. Ben Jonson, we read, is a "representative voice - perhaps the representative voice - of Jacobean culture, creat- ing its language and being created by it, the voice that most fully reproduces his society" (p. 230). The court subculture swells to fill the cultural universe, while oppositional subcultures remain beneath the threshold of visibility. Goldberg analyzes intracourt rivalries between Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots, but not the Marprelate Contro- 6.

He comes closest to acknowledging a concrete oppositional collec- tive in English classical republicanism, which had a long and complex early modern history as a nonabsolutist political rhetoric and practice. But he insists that the opposition between republican and absolutist is only apparent, for both have some idea of authority (but what politics doesn't?) and both look to Rome for precedents (but what learned early modern writers didn't?) (pp. 78-79). Goldberg argues that Jaco- bean drama does not just argue but reveals the corruption in republi- canism. In Volpone, Ben Jonson unmasks the republican "myth of Venice" by showing the absolutist scheming at work in republican Venice (pp. 72-76). In Catiline, Jonson's Cicero "is a familiar form, the mask of republicanism covering absolutism." But "despite appear- ances, his consulship bears no genuine republican meaning" (pp. 96- 97). And in Coriolanus Shakespeare presents us with the image of a state "engaged in a deadly struggle in which each part would be all" (p. 190) - all this despite the fact that Coriolanus is Shakespeare's most overtly republican play, ending as it does with the would-be tyrant Coriolanus assassinated by the Volscians and with stable republican Rome triumphant.7 Goldberg sees the antiabsolutist arguments of early modern republicanism as no more than an ideological ruse of would-be absolutists sour with ressentiment because they lack the courtly savvy to acquire power in the customary fashion - a highly absolutist argument, and one not unknown to the monarchist oppo- nents of the Commonwealth republicans. Whenever republicanism rears its oppositional heads, in politics or drama, Goldberg argues that it is already contained inside the universe of absolutist discourse. In Jacobean literature more generally, Goldberg sees absolutism containing all instances of apparent subversion: "Employing royal language, poets turned the tables on the monarch, appropriating power against power by engaging the most radical potential that resides in language, its own multivalent, self-contradictory nature. 7. For a reading of the play as an aristocratic and republican satire of absolutist tragedy, see my "Tragic Superfluity in Coriolanus ELH, 50, No. 3 (1983)¬ª 485_5¬∞7-</page><page sequence="9">James Holstun 197 This does not make the king's poets subversives or revolutionaries; on the contrary, royalists all, they followed the king's prescriptions, pursuing his sustaining contradictions" (p. 116). These subversive/ conservative powers engage not the particular powers generated by a determinate system of absolutist discourse, but the generative core of language itself, its "most radical potential." The world of absolutism begins to seem disquietingly analogous to the universe of discourse, and one begins to suspect that in Goldberg's Jacobean England abso- lutism is the only game in town. Opposition, if it exists at all, flickers impotently and mutely in a prelinguistic limbo: "To imagine the overthrow of the present state of things and to make a revolution would seem to involve the destruction of the very limits in which thoughts and actions occur, and there would seem to be no way to express this - and perhaps therefore no way for revolution to occur" (p. 264, n. 4). Like Greenblatt, Goldberg is unable to imagine any mediation between subject and system: all oppositional collectives, all rhetorics of political resistance and revolution presuppose some sort of romantic and metaphysical individualism, and thus fall prey to a deconstructionist critique. Goldberg's deconstructive new historicism is by no means com- pletely representative, but this model of a dominant social order that reproduces itself by producing and containing its own controlled subversion appears in many new historicist studies: Stephen Orgel on the Jonsonian masque, Don Wayne on the country house poem, Arthur Marotti on the aristocratic coteries in which Donne's poetry circulated, and recent collections of essays on patronage relations and the construction of gender identity in early modern Europe.8 Even 8.

The last book includes a number of essay s that try to show some of the sites for women's collective self-fashioning inside a dominant pa- triarchal order. Generally speaking, feminists and feminist new historicists have been interested in uncovering concrete strategies of resistance to dominant patriarchal culture, suggesting a natural alliance with the analysis of radical political opposition I discuss below.

Jonathan Dollimore emphasizes the difficulty of finding true opposition, suggesting that "we can never find in a repressed subculture that most Utopian of fantasies: an alternative to the domi- nant which is simultaneously subversive of it and self-authenticating" (pp. 14-15). But this is a fantasy dreamt by a straw man. To begin with, the very concept of subversion is unsatisfactory for describing resistance or revolution. "Subversion" is more likely to be the fantasy of someone inside a dominant subculture, whether he is eager to "identify" it and root it out, or to identify with it as a resentful and unrealizable dream of individual conquest from within, or somehow painfully to com- bine the two. In a sense, the debate over subversion and containment is a nondebate, since "subversion" is already contained inside "con- tainment." Actual early modern radicals more typically define them- selves in a positive, even traditional role: they are the protectors of the king from evil counselors, defenders of England's ancient liberties against "Norman" usurpers, God's allies against Antichrist, etc. Sec- ond, the concept of a "self-authenticating" oppositional practice hardly covers the whole field, and may not cover any of it, since oppositional groups typically arise not by pointing at themselves, but by forming alliances with certain groups and distinguishing them- selves from others, invoking the authority of certain texts and at- tacking others, segmenting themselves, and adapting themselves to changing circumstances. "Self-authenticating opposition" is a roman- tic concept that would be hard to find at work in the writings of an early modern (or even any Romantic) radical group. My point here is not that the new historicists' concentration on the canon utterly compromises their political analysis, not even that a quick turn to Gerrard Winstanley and John Lilburne will produce a complete model of early modern literary culture in England. Nor do I wish to claim that the new historicists' will-to-totalization necessarily indicates some unrecognized and debilitating metaphysical impera- tive, for I cannot conceive of any sort of moderately ambitious crit- icism of culture that does not explicitly or implicitly work from some model of cultural totality. I simply wish to argue that the new histor- icism totalizes prematurely by arguing that all cultural conflicts, all exercises of power and resistance necessarily register themselves in- side canonical cultural artifacts. This sort of argument assumes that</page><page sequence="11">James Holstun 199 culture is a logical structure that can be captured by an artwork form- ing a structure homologous to it. A view of culture as a material entity, on the other hand, studies the relation between the way a subculture articulates itself and the way it is articulated by another subculture. When we assume that these two ways are identical, we slip into a high-tech version of the Elizabethan world picture. Again and again, the new historicists pose an important (if by now somewhat rhetorical) question: are early modern cultural differences (of blood, gender, class, ethnicity, virtue religion) natural and essen- tial, or cultural and constructed? "Cultural and constructed," they respond consistently and rightly, and then go about discovering the social system producing and integrating these differences. But by posing this question so insistently, they drown out another important question that might also be addressed: how did early modern women and men, circulating in this field of socially constructed differences, manage to create new sorts of differences and even (at rare moments) to affiliate themselves with oppositional collectives that challenged the system of differences prescribed by the dominant social order? When it insists that we must choose between a foredoomed notion of sheer transcendant individuality and a monolithic cultural system that regulates the production of subjectivities and anticipates all possible subversions of itself, the new historicism stacks the deck against a political analysis of the complex relations among cultural collectives. Gazing at the poems, pageants, and plays of early modern English literature and elaborating their increasingly complex model of the relation between this canon and absolutist sovereignty, the new his- toricists take on some of the Weimar melancholy of Max Weber, as he contemplates the modern world's iron cage of bureaucratic domina- tion.9 They return us gently but firmly to the canon - a canon no longer defined as a green world of imaginative freedom, but as a gridded network of domination and discipline. As a result, Utopian collective analysis becomes a futile impossibility, and the image of oppositional collective life melts into air. Ill When studying the systematic production of human subjectivity, the new historicists draw considerable theoretical support from the writ- 9.

In a late essay Foucault calls his work "a history of the different modes by which, in our culture, human beings are made subjects," and this might also serve as a capsule summary of the new historicism, which examines (as Foucault seldom does) the literary modes of this making.10 Foucault's master concept for dis- cussing this disciplinary formation of subjectivity is power. In the first volume of The History of Sexuality, he formulates his non-Marxist definition: power is neither a grouping of oppressive institutions, nor a mode of oppressive governance, nor a property owned by one group and coveted by another. Rather, it is the "multiplicity of force relations" in a society.11 Relations of power of any sort are both the "internal conditions" and "the immediate effects" of all social life (p. 94). Power cannot be located, for it is "the moving substrate of force relations" (p. 93). In a much-quoted aphorism, Foucault ob- serves, "Power is everywhere; not because it embraces everything, but because it comes from everywhere" (p. 93). Foucault attempts to move the discussion of power away from the heading of repression (of primal energies, or human nature, or the proletariat) and toward the heading of production (the manufacture of subjectivities, the reversal of power relations through local strategies, and so forth). But this doesn't solve all problems. Although Foucault's concept of power remains unproblematized in the writings of the new histor- icists, it has come under fire from other quarters for failing to examine adequately the question of resistance. 12 We might assume that, for Foucault, "resistance" would simply be one determinate locus of power among others. Instead, it appears as either a transgressive spirit of pure negation, or as an effect that a dominant power structure simply inscribes inside. In Discipline and Punish, for instance, Foucault frequently gestures toward the possibility of resistance, but he turns only briefly to two concrete cases: first, to the urban crowds that gathered around the scaffold, making heroes of those who assaulted "the king's body" and creating a public tumult; and second, to an 10.

He concludes the book by saying, "In this central and centralized humanity, the effect and instrument of complex power relations, bodies and forces subjected by multiple mechanisms of 'incarceration, ' objects for dis- courses that are in themselves elements for this strategy, we must hear the distant roar of battle."13 But this roar never becomes much more distinct, and one searches Foucault s writings in vain for a detailed analysis of the dynamics of resistance. In an interview of 1977, Foucault attempts to develop his theory of resistance by way of the concept of the "plebs," which he calls "the permanent, ever silent target for apparatuses of power." The plebs would seem at first to suggest a class outside of all power, and thus to violate his concept of a universal and culturally immanent scheme of power. But he saves himself - not by studying actual instances of "plebeian" resistance, but by recoding such resistance as an effect of structure: The plebs is no doubt not a real sociological entity. But there is indeed always something in the social body, in classes, groups and individuals themselves which in some sense escapes relations of power, something which is by no means a more or less docile or reactive primal matter, but rather a centrifugal movement, an inverse energy, a discharge. There is certainly no such thing as "the" plebs; rather there is, as it were, a certain plebeian quality or aspect (' de la' pl√®be). There is plebs in bodies, in souls, in individuals, in the proletariat, in the bourgeoisie, but everywhere in a diversity of forms and extensions, of energies and irreducibilities.14 We might best read Foucault 's indefinite pronouns and multiple over- lapping metaphors as symptoms of his frustrated desire to provide a material ground for resistance to power without speaking of classes or struggles between dominant and subordinate groups - concepts that might contaminate his genealogical project with a Marxist vocabulary of historical totalization. Paradoxically, though, Foucault 's critique of a Hegelian or Marxist totalizing history leads him to a totalization of his own on the level of power - a power that tends to be, de facto if not de jure, an instrument of state domination. His historical analyses and theoretical studies proliferate a series of quasi-thermodynamic terms 13. Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, trans.

As a result, Foucault's power comes to resemble a somewhat politicized version of Derrida's differance: an analytical term derived from concrete social and linguistic relations, reified as an agency, and transformed into the principle generating and governing all "apparent" oppositions between those relations. Also like differance, Foucault's power has become an extremely useful tool for literary critics who repeatedly discover it as the theme of the works they examine. Foucault's concept of power and resistance has opened up one avenue of development for the new historicists and closed off another. First, it has freed them to examine in detail the literary discourses and other symbolic systems that produce early modern human subjects. But it has also allowed them (even encouraged them) to remain within the literary canon, even though their stated principles prac- tically require them to consider the various modalities of power at work in early modern literature, including the rhetorics of radical popular resistance. If, as Foucault says, "Where there is power, there is resistance," and "These points of resistance are present everywhere in the power network," then it is only a small step to claim that, for instance, a Jacobean masque contains within itself not just a partial model of monarchical power, but all ofthat power and all conceivable kinds of resistance to it. If, as Foucault assures us, a "certain plebeian quality" of resistance is everywhere present and present in very much the same form, and if it is "formed right at the point where relations of power are exercised," why not examine it inside the literary canon, where it is in closest proximity to the voice of sovereign power?15 15. Foucault, The History of Sexuality, I, 95, and Power/ Knowledge, p. 142. For an example of the mixed blessing of Foucault's influence on the new historicism, see Stephen Greenblatt's Shakespearean Negotiations: The Circulation of Social Energy in Renaissance England (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1988), in which "social energy" assumes much the same function as "power" in Foucault - indeed, Greenblatt credits Foucault with the phrase "dynamic circulation" (p. 166, n. 12). The concept of "social energy" disrupts the search for an "originary moment" in Renais- sance cultural production and concentrates instead on its definition by "a subtle, elusive set of exchanges, a network of trades and trade-offs" (p. 7), and Greenblatt establishes Shakespeare's drama admirably among other Renaissance discourses on colonialism, hermaphroditism, and witchcraft. But despite Greenblatt's claim that "the circulation of social energy by and through the stage was not part of a single coherent, totalizing system" (p. 19), it does tend to become a noumenal but all-determining agency underlying and connecting all classes and all apparently diverse aesthetic and nonaesthetic phenomena (p. 6). And it too leaves individuals "the prod-</page><page sequence="15">James Holstun 203 Even though we have replaced an "order model" of the Elizabethan world picture with a "power model," each canonical cultural artifact remains a cultural synecdoche. IV This leads us to one of the primary appeals of Foucault's work to the new historicists: it allows them to do political criticism without using a Marxist vocabulary. The new historicism not only distinguishes itself from the old historicism and idealist criticism; it also allies itself with them against any criticism that, in Montrose's terms, would define literature "as a superstructural manifestation of an economic base."16 This Marxism, we presume, is one that would see the transi- tion from feudalism to capitalism dramatized in the rupture between the first two scenes of King Lear, and also, no doubt, everywhere else it looks in early modern literature. Only recently have we been freed from the (typically unnamed) practitioners of this mechanistic or "vulgar" Marxism by Louis Althusser's antihumanist structural Marxism, by the post-structuralist critique of Marxism's vestigial Hegelian idealism, and by Raymond Williams' critique of a simplistic "superstructural" model of culture.17 This new historicist critique appears so frequently that a reader unfamiliar with the history of postwar American literary criticism might reasonably take it as an act ucts" of a system of dynamic circulation (p. 12) who can gain power only by their membership in various "joint stock companies" and by entering into complex social "negotiation" (p. 7) - metaphors that tend to occlude radical opposition and revolutionary action. 16. Montrose, "Renaissance Literary Studies," p. 8. One may argue that, just as the Yale school of deconstruction blunts the radical political edge of Derrida, so new historicism discards the genuinely radical potential of Foucault's writing for the sake of a tame, anti-Marxist literary critical project. But in both cases we have something more than a falling-off from original purity. See Foucault's remarkable claim (in a 197 1 interview with two Maoists) that "to imagine another system is to extend our participation in the present system. This is perhaps what happened in the history of the Soviet Union" (Language, Counter-memory, Practice: Selected Essays and Interviews, ed. Donald F. Bouchard [Ithaca, N.Y., 1977], p. 230). 17. Raymond Williams, "Base and Superstructure in Marxist Cultural Theory," in Problems in Materialism and Culture: Selected Essays (London, 1980), pp. 31-49. Superficial readings of Williams' essay too frequently assimilate it to a comfortably idealist rejection of the economic. In fact, his central argument - that "the base" as well as "the superstructures" consists of human practices, not a determining structure - aligns him squarely with the humanist Marx of the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts and the Theses on Feuerbach. Of course, since most new historicists read Marx through Althusser, this young Marx remains unread, anathema, or (most frequently) both.</page><page sequence="16">204 English Literary Renaissance of heroic resistance to some lusty native Marxist tradition. However, in the self-policing world of the post-McCarthy academy, no such tradition exists. Why this continuing exorcism of a dispossessed house? Where are the vulgar Marxists? If we attempt to locate them by looking outside the American academy to the history of twentieth-century Marxist criticism of culture, the answer we get is no more satisfying. Anyone browsing through the pages of Telos, New Left Review, or the works of the great Marxist culture critics (say, Luk√°cs, Adorno, Benjamin, Gramsci, Bloch, Brecht, Thompson, Marcuse, Williams, Jameson) is unlikely to come away with the impression of a cowed materialist orthodoxy prostrating itself before the economic base. Indeed, a more likely impression might be that a nonreductive theory of culture has been one of the great achievements of twentieth-century Marxist thought, and that the central question addressed by this theory has been the relation of economic base and cultural superstructure. Frequently, the Marxist answer has been to drop this spatial model altogether, as we can see in Williams' brilliant essay. But even Wil- liams presents his essay not as a manifesto directed at earlier mech- anistic Marxism, but as a contribution to long-standing, wide- ranging, and ongoing debate. And his argument leads us to a key problem in the new historicism's anti-Marxist methodology: the cri- tique of a mechanistic or "vulgar Marxist" theory of causality too frequently becomes a critique of causality itself, leaving us with either a static system assimilated to the order of language, or a Foucauldian or Althusserian conjunctural analysis that never moves far beyond the stage of simply asserting that there is a structure. Williams comments: "For if we come to say that society is composed of a large number of social practices which form a concrete social whole, and if we give each practice a certain specific recognition, adding only that they interact, relate and combine in very complicated ways, we are at one level much more obviously talking about reality, but we are at an- other level withdrawing from the claim that there is any process of determination" (p. 36). Too often, the new historicists' critique of mechanical causality becomes a hymn to the indeterminacy of power relations rather than an analysis of human interventions in those relations. At times, the new historicists' embrace of "power" √†-la- Foucault and "structural causality" √†-la-Althusser comes perilously close to "texture" √†-la-John Crowe Ransom.</page><page sequence="17">James Holstun 20$ As Russell Jacoby argues in The Last Intellectuals: American Culture in the Age of Academe, academic anti-Marxism did not disappear with McCarthy.18 It has been internalized and lives on in the form of a general reluctance to ask questions about relations of class and art, and in a willingness to label anyone who talks about literature's relation to social history, in however mediated and subtle a form, as a "vulgar Marxist" (is there any other kind?). The result is that unlike British or Continental criticism, American literary criticism has simply had no space for a strong oppositional Marxist tradition, and that anyone wishing to do sociological criticism of any sort must attack "vulgar Marxism" first as the ticket of admission to the order of academic discourse. Literary critical Althusserianism, which adapts itself much more readily to the philosophical critique of the bourgeois subject than to the historical analysis of collective resistance, is the Marxist exception that proves the anti-Marxist rule. The new historicists' self-innoculation against this sort of critique is by no means craven or unmotivated, as we can see in Edward Pech- ter's "The New Historicism and Its Discontents," a recent exercise in genteel red-baiting.19 Pechter argues that because the new historicists see "history and contemporary political life as determined, wholly or in essence, by struggle, contestation, power relations, libido domi- nandi," they must be seen as practitioners of "Marxist criticism" (p. 292). That this definition suggests Nietzsche rather than Marx (where are class, economics, the state?) is beside the point: the triumphant discovery of a Marxist agenda as the hidden truth of all varieties of sociological criticism, even when that agenda does not exist, will retain a considerable force so long as the academy is dominated by an idealist aesthetics. Despite the new historicists' declarations (sometimes repetitious to 18. Russell Jacoby, The Last Intellectuals: American Culture in the Age of Academe (New York, 1986). 19. For a less genteel but probably even more influential statement, see the conclusion of David Lehman's article in Newsweek on the De Man affair: "What's next? Berkeley professor Frederick Crews sees the rise of 'the new militant cultural materialism of the left.' That school prescribes the study of books not because of their moral or esthetic value but because they permit the professor to advance a political, often Marxist agenda. Crews contends that there's more than a trace of deconstruction in 'the new historicism' " ("Deconstructing de Man's Life, " Feb. 15, 1988, pp. 63-65). One thing that makes Marxists and their fellow travelers so per- nicious is their methodical propensity for agendas: "(1) Deny damaging connection with de- construction (2) Attack literature's moral and esthetic value (3) Establish dictatorship of pro- letariat."</page><page sequence="18">2o6 English Literary Renaissance the point of tedium) that literature is always a constituent part of the society it reflects on and not a mere reflection of it, Pechter returns to the old comfortable binary: the new historicists' "whole endeavor is to situate the literary text in social history and thus to see it in a determined or secondary position" (p. 295). A world of bad argument resides blandly in that "thus." Against this "determinism," Pechter proposes (what else?) freedom: we need to maintain the "free space" of literature and remain alive to "the potential power of the text - the power to open up new areas of experience, unfamiliar ways of being in the world" (pp. 300, 301). This freedom even extends to the process of doing historical criticism: "We decide what history is, and then put history into the text, rather than the other way around" (p. 298). So why keep dwelling inside this depressing model of literature as sub- jectification? Winston Smith has become a liberal, and he wants to feel good about himself. In response to such a critique, the new historicism might simply continue to pursue its immanent, canonical analyses of power, elab- orating even further its claims about the complex mediations between literary and nonliterary history, until it finds itself back inside some- thing disconcertingly like that idealist aesthetics it set out to escape, yet paradoxically still subject to criticism for its vestigial "Marxism." But it has another option - one suggested by Jonathan Dollimore's description of early modern "aliens": "The demonised elements in Elizabethan culture - for example, the masterless men - are, quite precisely, identified as such in order to ratify the exercise of power, but once identified, they are also there as a force to be self-identified" (p. 12). In the short term, there are worse things to be than a vulgar Marxist (a patrician Marxist, for instance), and it is one of the few identities safe from accusations of masking a secret Marxist agenda. In the long term, the new historicism might best prosper by embracing the demonizing critique and getting on about its business - if not by explicitly identifying itself as "Marxist," then by refusing to police itself so scrupulously and by reflecting more carefully on its relation to Marxist history and criticism, and socialist culture more generally. Carlo Ginzburg's The Cheese and the Worms offers a suggestive model for the sort of analysis of popular resistance to a dominant subculture that the new historicism promises but seldom delivers. Ginzburg reconstructs the story of Domenico Scandeila, or Menoc- chio, a sixteenth-century Italian miller who formulated an alternative</page><page sequence="19">James Holstun 207 cosmology for himself by reading printed texts according to a radical scheme of interpretation based in heretical popular traditions. Far from having to imagine what Menocchio "must have" thought, Ginzburg moves skillfully between a variety of texts: textual traces of ongoing early modern heretical traditions, the texts that Menocchio claimed to have read, accounts of other contemporary readings of these texts, and the records of his two trials for heresy - themselves polyvocal texts including the voices of the accused, his accusers, and various witnesses. Ginzburg reconstructs a materialist and heretical peasant subculture that existed in a circular and reciprocal relation with dominant culture - neither utterly foreign to it nor a mere reflec- tion of it. Although the Inquisition finally executed Menocchio, Ginzburg's analysis is finally more an elegiac study of his resilient self- fashioning than a lament for his tragic subjectification. Menocchio emerges from Ginzburg's book not as a mere effect of structure, but as an early modern hereti c-bricoleur who cobbles together an original identity for himself.20 We face an analogous situation on a much larger scale in the years of the English Revolution. Before and after the Revolution, we have the same relatively scanty records of popular heretical traditions and peasant rebellions. But during the Revolution, in the place of records of isolated inquisitorial trials such as those Ginzburg examines, we have an astonishing flood of radical pamphlet literature - the product of the social tumult, religious toleration, and relaxed censorship of the period. Christopher Hill has long argued that the interest of this literature lies not simply in the number of radicals it implies nor in the permanent parliamentary reforms it effected, but also in its ability to help us piece together the narrative of popular resistance to dominant authority that had such difficulty becoming vocal before and after the revolution.21 This is not to say that Hill's own historical practice is without its problems. While his erudition is incomparable, he too often tries to 20. Carlo Ginzburg, The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller, trans.

Because he seldom moves from the level of the individual excerptable state- ment to the level of the tract, oeuvre, or genre, his analyses of the formal or stylistic qualities of seventeenth-century prose typically limit themselves to appreciative quotation.22 Here, I think, we can begin to see the real attractiveness of combining the new historicism and the social history of oppositional groups - of making Foucault and Hill one. For all the criticism I've directed at the new historicism, it can help us see that oppositional language is not just a window on revolution, but one of its media: that identity is not just revealed by language but created in it. The new historicism typically conducts this sort of analysis in order to deny phenomenological priority and independence to the speaking subject and to show that the political concerns of early modern culture "speak" early modern writers, rather than the other way around. But if we apply this analysis to radical writers, it acquires an unexpected Utopian function. When confronted with radical writers, conservative seventeenth-century historians have typically practiced a technique of individuation by calling them interesting but sociopathic deviants who do not speak for any well-established or coherent group and by excluding them from the master narrative of British religious and constitutional history. Prose stylistics, the most common literary critical approach to seventeenth-century prose, typically works in much the same individuating way. But if we follow the new histor- icist (and post-structuralist) argument that any speech act implies an origin outside of and not completely under the control of the speaking subject, and if we allow that the utterances of the radicals do not originate in a system of absolutist rhetoric, then we cannot read any radical pamphlet as simply the inspired musings of some rawboned stylist naif. We cannot relegate a passage of Gerrard Winstanley's prophecy, John Lilburne's agitation, or Abiezer Coppe's ranting to the level of a merely individual utterance, but must see in it the trace of a larger collective identity that we can reconstruct (at least partially) from that passage itself. In this way the post-structuralist critique of 22.

Furthermore, despite the criticisms I have directed against Fou- cault, there is nothing in his approach that precludes such an analysis of oppositional collective discipline, and much that encourages it. Whereas deconstruction, for instance, typically aims to produce a critique of the subject by reintegrating it into the fractured totality of the Western tradition of logocentrism, Foucault has typically ab- stained from such terms of premature historical totalization, focusing instead on the diverse subjects produced by diverse social formations. If we avoid the complementary temptation to premature canonic totalization and look for concrete social junctures of dominant and resistant power, then a new area of literary and historical inquiry opens up: the analysis of oppositional collective self-fashioning. V I would now like to sketch one direction such an analysis might take by turning to the writings of the Ranters, perhaps the most extreme of the oppositional groups to find their way into print during the In- terregnum. They appeared on the scene after Cromwellian troops crushed the Levellers in 1649. Conservative and liberal historians have typically ignored the Ranters, but in the writings of A. L. Morton and Christopher Hill, the Ranters appear as an authentic force of popular resistance, playing the mystical anarchists to the Leveller-democrats and the Digger-communists.23 Morton and Hill have argued that Ranters such as Abiezer Coppe, Laurence Clarkson, Joseph Salmon, and Jacob Bauthumley rejected all versions of hierarchy and all con- cepts of a punishing and rewarding afterlife. Like the Diggers, they attacked private property in favor of economic community, but un- like the Diggers, they advocated sexual community as well. With 23. My analysis of Ranter rhetoric is indebted to the discussion of the Ranters' biographies and political activities by A. L. Morton in The World of the Ranters: Religious Radicalism in the English Revolution (London, 1970); and by Christopher Hill in The World Turned Upside Down: Radical Ideas during the English Revolution (New York, 1972). Jerome Friedman's Blasphemy, Immorality, and Anarchy: The Ranters and the English Revolution (Athens, Ohio, 1987) does not add much to their arguments, but provides a useful gathering of information and long quotations from and summaries of hard-to-obtain tracts. I regret that Nigel Smith's Perfection Proclaimed: Language and Literature in English Radical Religion, 1640-1660 (Oxford, 1988) appeared too late for me to benefit from it in writing this essay.</page><page sequence="22">210 English Literary Renaissance considerable justice, they were widely believed to center their religion upon eating, drinking, smoking, orgiastic sex, and boisterous blas- phemy. In 1650 Parliament began repressing them: passing a Blas- phemy Act aimed in part at censoring their doctrinal pronounce- ments, imprisoning them, and forcing them to write recantations as a condition of release. Bauthumley suffered the worst punishment. After he published The Light and Dark Sides of God, the Army court- martialed him for blasphemy, bored through his tongue with a hot iron, and burned some (not all) copies of his tract before his eyes. For a few months, the presses issued lurid accounts of Ranter outrages. But because of this judicial repression, the Ranters seem to disappear as a group of any sort after 1650. Compared to the Separatists, Levellers, Diggers, Fifth Monarchists, Quakers, and Muggletonians, they were a remarkably short-lived radical group.24 Because of the insistence of leftist historians like Hill and Morton, the Ranters have become harder to ignore. To protect the unified narrative of seventeenth-century religious and constitutional history from such radical encroachments, conservative historians have tried to psychologize the Ranter phenomenon. In The Pursuit of the Millen- nium, Norman Cohn compares them to the medieval Brethren of the Free Spirit as instances of group psychosis. In an essay of 1970 he calls them crazed fanatics and compares them to the Manson Family (al- though the Army's method of punishing blasphemy seems more like Manson's style). What seems to leftist historians like genuine popular resistance becomes no more than a psychological abnormality.25 Christopher Hill traces Cohn's sort of psychohistory to the rhetoric of the cold war era, "when ideologically motivated historians (how- ever unconscious the ideology) wanted to play down the significance of principles, whether religious or political, to proclaim 'the end of ideology.' . . . The underlying assumption was that opposition to 24.

He takes care to innoculate himself with scriptural precedents: "They are named the mad crew: mad to the Heathen, mad to the Christian carnal, and seemingly spiritual, mad to the Gentile, mad to the Jew; mad, so was David accounted one of the mad men, one of the vain base fellows; so was Lot in his time, so was Paul a mad man, one that turn'd the world up-side down, so was Christ a Devil, yea the Prince of Devils. It is a common thing for God in the many and several appearances of himself to be called of men, mad, a fool, a drunkard, a vain person" (p. 141). At a time when psy- choanalysts are turning more to history and politics to chart out the limitations of their discipline, a facile appeal to "collective psychosis" loses its aura of clinical rigor. Conservative historical accounts of the Ranters have taken a more interesting turn in the 1980s because of the work of "revisionist" historians of seventeenth-century England. In response to the leftist historians who have brought the Ranters into the spotlight, the revi- sionists have fabricated a more sophisticated sort of psychohistory. Where Cohn sees the Ranters as a radical psychotic phenomenon, J. F. MacGregor sees them as a conservative neurotic projection. The Ranters are "largely the product of the Puritan heresiographer's meth- odology." What written records the "Ranters" have left behind "re- flect the unsophisticated religious understanding of transient, proba- bly semiliterate sect members rather than the conscious commitment to Ranter doctrine."27 Apparently, there can be no collective identity with commitment to a rigorous doctrine - no consciousness at all, in fact, without "full literacy." J. C. Davis' recent book, Fear, Myth, and History, takes MacGregor's argument one step further. The Ranters were merely "the projection of an image inverting all that true godliness should represent" - a 26.

Davis finds scant evidence for arguing that the Ranters formed a coherent group with leaders. In fact, "The Ranters" come into twentieth-century focus only because of a left-wing mythmaking that mirrors the right- wing anti-Ranter frenzy of the seventeenth-century: leftist British historians (he singles out the Communist Party Historians' Group) set out to fabricate evidence for popular revolt within and against the Pu- ritan Revolution so they could find precedent for twentieth-century proletarian revolt. Hill and Morton's dream of doing history from below falls on its face. There are several problems with this revisionist argument. Even if we grant Davis' reading of the Ranter tracts (and I will argue that we should not), and even if we grant that there is no evidence of unity among the Ranters (and there is considerable), it is difficult to see why we should assume that group cohesion must rest on doctrinal una- nimity. We would do better to follow Milton's Areopagitica and admit that certain doctrinal disputes are intrinsic to the unity and life of any group, not a sign of its fundamental incoherence. How would such "alleged groups" as the Bolsheviks, the Anglican Church, and the Modern Language Association fare under Davis' stringent criteria for collective existence? Similarly, since the Ranters are such avowedly antiauthoritarian radicals, there is something perverse in his insistence that they have some sort of leader if we are to consider them a coher- ent group. Hill himself has admitted that they had no single theoreti- cian or organization, but this is not to say that they had no sense of collective identity. Second, it is difficult to see why we should make the jump from acknowledging that conservative hysterias exceed the threat posed by their objects to claiming that these objects do not exist. One principle of such hysterias is their rational economy: they simultaneously create mythologies that help solidify a dominant group in a persecuting frenzy and repress actual persons. Certainly we can speak of the mythic dimensions of Jesuit scares and anti- Semitism, but this is hardly to deny the repression of real Jesuits and Jews. These revisionist arguments in the domain of history have some rather surprising affinities with new historicist arguments in the do- main of literature, as David Norbrook has suggested. Both emphasize the personal struggle for patronage and individual advancement within a relatively stable social framework rather than collective ideo-</page><page sequence="25">James Holstun 213 logical struggles (p. 257). As the new historicists argue that literary "radicals" are secretly controlled by the conservative ideology they claim to subvert, so the revisionists attempt to argue that the Puritans fundamentally agreed with a hierarchical and conservative Jacobean ideology and wandered into revolution and regicide more or less by accident. Barry Coward says, for instance, that "everyone was a royalist before 1642."28 Both new historicists and revisionists focus on the ways in which a dominant social order in fact generates and contains those subversive forces that seem to be opposed to it. And both tend to eschew "history from below" and any historical explana- tion smacking of class struggle or political revolution. For revisionists such as Davis, Christopher Hill typically person- ifies this sort of history writing. Davis attacks Hill and other radical historians for attempting "to sustain the twin notions that the people have persistently attempted to make their own history and that such a potential history has been, in essence, the negation of capitalist culture and the Protestant ethic" (p. 136). The cultural materialist Jonathan Dollimore is only slightly more hospitable to such a project: "Of course one can, sometimes, recover history from below. But to piece together its fragments may be eventually to disclose not the self- authenticating other, but the self-division intrinsic to (and which thereby perpetuates) subordination" (p. 1 5). And in a review essay on the new historicism, Jonathan Goldberg presents Christopher Hill as the diehard proponent of "the all but disproved notion of the English Revolution as a class war" - an interesting comment, both for the cavalier way in which it ignores Hill's voluminous efforts to show the religious and political dimensions of the conflict, and for its charm- ingly old-fashioned and "revisionist" invocation of an empiricist his- tory capable of disproving certain "notions."29 Consequently, although the new historicists have not discussed the Ranters (the authority of the canon being so much stronger in literary studies than in history), we may take the revisionists as proxy new historicists, and insert the Ranters in a new historicist problematic of absolutism and subversion. Such an argument might run something 28.

Goldberg, "Politics," p. 15.</page><page sequence="26">214 English Literary Renaissance like this: by attempting to place themselves utterly outside the estab- lished social order, the Ranters fall prey to idealist fictions of subjec- tive autonomy and absolute originality - fictions that ultimately un- dercut themselves and reintegrate the Ranters more thoroughly inside the political and discursive closure of Commonwealth Britain. Now such an argument has some limited relevance to other radical groups. The Fifth Monarchists, for instance, would seem to fit nicely inside the paradigm of a "subversive" force that simply reproduces or inverts the hierarchy it attacks, for their conception of a millennial rule of the demonstrable saints sounds like a vengeful double of the more staid Presbyterian or Protectorate oligarchies they attack.30 But we face a much different situation with the Ranters, whose rhetoric attempts to fabricate a new human collectivity by criticizing received binary oppositions between rich and poor, man and woman, the sacred and the blasphemous, the elect and the damned, God and the Devil, and ultimately, good and evil. In his attempt to deny the existence of the Ranters, J. C. Davis conducts an argument something like the fictional new historicist argument I've invented above. He searches through works attributed to alleged Ranters looking for what he calls the two doctrines most frequently attributed to them: a mystical pantheism, and a radical antinomianism that would require all believers to act out whatever the orthodox deem sinful. These radical theologies would seem to place the Ranters utterly outside the established rhetorics of seventeenth- century England, and in fact he finds them almost nowhere present in their pure form. Consequently there is no such thing as a voice of radical Ranter opposition. For instance, of the anonymous Ranter tract entitled A Justification of the Mad Crew, he says simply, "The pantheism of the work is curiously ambivalent, and its call is to purity of heart, not to the liberation of practical antinomianism" (p. 58). But when we turn to the tract itself, which Davis reproduces in an appendix to his book, we find the following: Every creature that moves in the Earth and under the Earth, in the Sea and in the Firmament above, is the seat of God, contains him, hugs him, embraces him, nay is really and truly God, even the living God. . . . [The] holliness of man and unholiness of man are both one to him. ... he loves and delights in one as well as the other. . . . [The] Sons of God when they eat, eat God, and 30. B. S.

Lord, whether shall we go from thy presence?

When we go to a Whorehouse we meet thee, and when we come away thou comest away with us, and there thou takest. (pp. 139. 140) If this isn't pantheist antinomianism, it is hard to imagine what would be. More important, though, the very labels are misleading, since "pantheism" and "antinomianism" seem to imply an ethical and re- ligious order utterly alien to the rhetoric of mid-seventeenth-century England. However, what makes Ranter rhetoric so powerful, what allows it to engage a Puritan audience, is that it presents itself not as the utter negation of Protestantism, but as its ultimate development. Its "antinomianism" extends the Protestant theories of indwelling grace and the Calvinist belief in redemptive predestination for an elect minority to the entire social order. The favorite Ranter text for this argument is Titus 1.15: "Unto the pure all things are pure." Similarly, Ranter "pantheism" might just as easily be seen as a radical Protestant attack on the vestigial "polytheism" of icons and sacraments. The author of A Justification accuses others of creating two gods through a sort of anthropomorphic projection: "And thus you change God into a lie like your selves, sometimes gracious to you, and at other times cruel," creating one God who is god of some few saints, and another "who acts in the wicked, one called a Devil." The Ranters, on the other hand, are true (and hermaphroditic?) monotheists: "But now these men (that are male and female) hold one onely pure and indivisible, simple and uncompounded God, who is not withholden from any thing" (p. 142). Jacob Bauthumley attacks the idea of a localized God with an "intire being circumscribed or confined in a place above the Starres and Firmament, which the men of the World call Heaven" (p. 232). And he compares the purgatory of the "carnali Papist" to the hell of the "carnali Protestant" - both of them means to extort money from the poor by fear (p. 247). The author of A Justification in fact accuses all others of being polytheists, calling them "a worshipper of many Gods. ... I could tell all of you that money is your God" (p. 142). Ranter "pantheism," surprisingly enough, is the radical offspring of good Protestant monotheism, which turns around and reproaches its parent for vestigial polythe- ism. The Ranters were - first, last, and always - practitioners of a the-</page><page sequence="28">21 6 English Literary Renaissance ocratic rhetoric, and one might try to deny them their oppositional status by arguing that they are caught within the closure of a Christian world view or a logocentric language. Davis tries something of the sort with Abiezer Coppe and Laurence Clarkson (pp. 53, 62). But to characterize a seventeenth-century political rhetoric as theocratic (that is, as drawing its authority from an interpretation of Scripture) is finally not to say very much, since the Scriptures form something like a conceptual and practical horizon inside which both seventeenth- century orthodoxy and opposition must fashion themselves. We need to abandon sterile taxonomies of intellectual traditions and concen- trate instead, as Carlo Ginzburg suggests, on reconstructing lost modes of reading and efforts to appropriate received printed authori- ties and turn them to new radical uses. Abiezer Coppe captures the Ranters' violent efforts to break free of received interpretive traditions and fabricate a new way of reading: Better schollers they, that have their lessons without book, and can reade God (not by roate) but plainly and perfectly, on the backside, and outside of the book, as well as in the inside: that can take this Primer in their hands; and hold it heeles upward, and then reade him there: that can spell every word backwards, and then tell what it is: that can reade him from the left hand to the right, as if they were reading English , or from the right to the left, as if they were reading Hebrew: that can read, God as plainly in the Octavo of a late converted JEW [one of Coppe's aliases], as in a Church Bible in Folio: that can reade him within book, and without book, and as well without book, as within book: that can reade him downwards and upwards, upwards and downwards, from left to right, from right to left: that can reade him in the Sun, and in the Clouds, and as well in the Clouds, as in the Sun. (p. 61) Coppe attempts to break down distinctions between English and Hebrew, Scripture and commentary, dans le texte and dehors texte, the book of God and the book of the Creature. In a quieter but still radical mode, Jacob Bauthumley proposes a distinction between the outward Scripture and the inward Scripture, with the latter as an appropriate guide to follow in the age of the Spirit. Of course, this rather familiar claim leaves him open both to seventeenth-century accusations of libertine enthusiasm and to twentieth-century accusations of idealist phonocentrism. But he guards himself: "If any man shall say, that I may be deceived, and take that for a discovery of God which is but a fancie of my own Brain: I answer, I may mis-interpret the outward Scripture, and so run as</page><page sequence="29">James Holstun 217 great a hazard that way, and as soon fall into errour, because it speaks of and to men in variety of Estates and conditions, and so if I take that part of it, which doth not speak to my condition, I shall then make a false construction of it, so that I conceive the safest and surest rule to walk by, is that law of the spirit" (p. 261). The "law of the spirit" is not a delusive theological vision of self-presence, but an awareness of the polyvocal and layered quality of Scripture - the way it speaks to several conditions at once, so that any reader wishing to impose a single interpretation on all conditions must invoke a false textual totality. As Nigel Smith says in his excellent introduction to A Collection of Ranter Writings, we might think of Ranter rhetoric as a negation of the Puritan rhetoric that subjects any and all subject matters to a rigorous Ramist binary analysis (p. 33). Ranter rhetoric aims rather toward pure serial generation: vatic tables of contents, series of oracular one- sentence paragraphs, rapid shifts of identity (Clarkson becomes Christ becomes the Ranters becomes the world). We can see this anti- Ramism in the very title of Laurence Clarkson's tract, A Single Eye, All Light, no Darkness; or Light and Darkness One , and in the address of A Justification "To all, even to those that impatiently, as well as to those that patiently read, and try the things that folio weth" (p. 140). Blasphemy becomes a key tool in the Ranters' effort to attack received binaries and fabricate a new social collective. Christopher Hill has shown the political dialectic of blasphemy, noting that the Puritans forbade it in order to attack aristocratic irreligion, while the Ranters and other plebeian radicals rejected the ban as a means of rejecting Puritan domination.31 This rejection is implicit in Coppe's claim that God "had rather heare a mighty Angell (in man) swearing a full-mouthed Oath . . . then heare a zealous Presbyterian, Indepen- dent, or spirituali Notionist, pray, preach, or exercise" (pp. 91, 92). We can trace certain blasphemous catch-phrases from tract to tract - ‚Ä¢ several Ranters describe God's love as "ramming and damning" man into himself. And blasphemy seems to have formed part of the Ran- ters' daily discourse, as we can see in the letter that Joseph Salmon wrote in April 1650 to Thomas Webbe, radical parson of Langley Burrell in Wiltshire. In the body of this letter he refers to a Ranter collective, speaking of Abiezer Coppe as "Cop, my, thy, own hart" 31. Christopher Hill, The World Turned Upside Down, p. 162.</page><page sequence="30">21 8 English Literary Renaissance and evidently alluding to Bauthumley when he mentions "a Souldier who was burnt through the tongue for a business of the same nature" (p. 201). Then in a postscript he attempts to reinforce the Ranter collective through violently indecorous language: "Ten thousand sa- lutes, alias holy kisses to thy dear wife, with whom is my heart; my tender respects to thy Uncle, my Father, his Spouse, my beloved my dear Mary, your maid: Eternal plagues consume you all, rot, sink and damn your bodies and souls into devouring fire, where none but those that walk uprightly can enter. Sirs, I wish you damnable well, because I dearly love you; the Lord grant we may know the worth of hell, that we may forever scorn heaven: For my own part I am ascended far above all heavens, yet I fill all things, and laugh in my sleeve to think what's coming" (pp. 201-02). Salmon's speech is a pastiche of indecorums: whatever the interrelation of persons in his first, sloppily punctuated series, its typical Ranter effusiveness breaks down familial and legal relationships and builds up new ones in an erotic extended family. His move into blasphemy is more than a startling outburst. By implicating blasphemer and audience alike in the performance of a proscribed act, blasphemy becomes a sort of Ranter eucharist. Indeed, this very letter (reprinted in a pamphlet hostile to the Ranters) seems to have been one of those intercepted by Parliamentary agents, acknowledged by Salmon, and used as evi- dence both in Salmon's trial for blasphemy and Webbe's for adultery, sodomy, and pandering his wife.32 Davis has suggested that accusations of libertine Ranter sexuality were cooked up by the conservative editors of the scandal sheets, and in fact, the Felliniesque dimensions of some of the orgies they narrate and crudely illustrate suggest a fictive hand at work. But sexual community does seem to have been a unifying bond among the Ranters.33 Abiezer Coppe compares himself to King David dancing naked before barren Michal, and artfully combines "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife" and "Love thy neighbor as thyself': "Yet I can if it be my will, kisse and hug Ladies, and love my neighbours wife as my selfe, without sin" (pp. 106-07). Even in his post-Ranter spiritual autobiography, A Lost Sheep Found, Laurence Clarkson re- veals the erotic dimensions of the Ranter collective. The printer Giles 32. Davis, pp. 28-29. On Webbe, see Friedman, pp. 217-35. 33.

The author of A Justification scorns those who commit thousands of internal adulteries, but rather than proposing chastity of heart for the virtuous and marriage for those who burn, he calls God "the Whore and the Whoremaster" (p. 140) and depicts the Wedding Feast of the Lamb as a millennial orgy: These creatures are married all, to every woman is their wife, not one woman apart from another, but all in one, and one in all: There is not this voice heard at the feast, whose wife is this woman, and whose that? and whose husband is such a one? For there is but one Husband, and one Wife: and this man and wife, though made up of many thousands, ly with one another every night, the bed is large enough to hold them all; it is not such a bed that you have heard to be at Ware, where twenty can lie in it, but a sweet bed made of Roses and Spices, large enough, where millions of millions can all stretch themselves on it, and yet it is but one stretching, one stretched, one loving, and one loved: the same kissing, and the same kissed, and all crea- tures are singing and dancing at this wedding, (pp. 147-48) Now we need not take Ranting as an explosion of Dionysian truth breaking free of the Puritans' grim repression of libidinal energies, but neither should we go so far as to deny the oppositional function of eroticism. We see here a prose hymn which takes the antilibertine calumnies directed toward the Ranters, admits their justice, and uses them as an incitement to embrace Aphrodite Pandemos with all un- due speed. John Carey sees the Ranters as harbingers of D. H. Law- rence,34 but I think we have to go to William Blake and Walt Whit- man to find such a colloquial and collective fusion of biblical cadences and democratizing erotic content. This is a Ranter Song of Ourselves. The evenhanded critique of wifely and husbandly possessiveness points to another characteristic Ranter development of currents at work in more traditional forms of Protestantism. Keith Thomas has shown that the Civil War sects slightly weakened the claims of tradi- tional patriarchy by insisting on the spiritual equality of all true believers.35 In A Fiery Flying Roll, Coppe reproduces a letter sent to him by a Mrs. T. P. She addresses Coppe as "My true love in the spirit 34. John Carey, foreword to Smith, A Collection of Ranter Writings, p. 3. 35.

She then recounts her dream of a pan-species orgy: "And all these beasts, wormes and Fishes, living, and recreateing themselves together, and my selfe with them." When she attempts to separate one of the beasts "and brought it in my bosome away, from all the rest, " it turns wild and struggles to get away (p. 65). When introducing her account of this dream, she seems to be preparing us for the familiar distinction between woman the analysand and man the analyst: "To one is given a revelation; to another an interpretation" (p. 64). But afterwards, she interprets it herself, saying her dream reveals her "weaknesse" - not in being a woman, but in "taking one of them from all the rest (as dis- tinct,)" (p. 65) - undercutting her own distinction between dreamer and interpreter (and between Coppe and her husband, if she has one?). Coppe responds by attacking the image of woman as the weaker vessel and says, "I know that Male and Female are all one in Christ, and they are all one to me." He follows with an extraordinary inver- sion of the metaphors of gender hierarchy: "I am your eccho, in that which followeth in your Letter" (p. 66). And in fact the interpretation he produces of her dream does echo hers, elaborating and working variations on it rather than explaining and dominating it (pp. 66-72). Ranter rhetoric is radical not simply because it attempts to invert social and ethical hierarchies, but because it attacks the very binary principle determining hierarchy and ethics. Admittedly, the Ranters sometimes seem to be practicing a mere inversion, as in the title of the fifth "principle" of A Justification: "That the Righteous shall never be saved, that the Godly shall go to Hell, the Wicked to Heaven." But the author immediately adds that this is only because the godly have made a hell for themselves on earth by creating a heaven "in a place above the skies" (p. 146). They are free to abandon this internal infernal fiction whenever they like. Stephen Greenblatt has argued in Renaissance Self-Fashioning that the figure of the sixteenth-century literary self typically takes shape against the ground of an alien other, a demonic figure (Jew, woman, Jesuit, atheist, homosexual) who threatens to subvert all order, and who can thus be used to externalize and distance a subversive principle in the orthodox self (p. 9). The Ranter self, on the other hand, typically arises out of an attempt to</page><page sequence="33">James Holstun 221 destroy this fiction of alienation. The author of A Justification says that God "loves all with an everlasting love, the theif that goes to the Gallows as well as the Judg that condemns him, and the Judg with a love of and from eternity as well as the theif: He loves as dearly with an infinite unchangeable love the Cavileer as the Round-head, and the Round-head as the Cavileer: the Army as abundantly as the Levellers, and the Levellers as the Army. For with him is no distinction. He pulleth down the mighty from their Throne, and sets up men of low degree" (p. 145). The Ranters' commutative rhetoric - this mirrored conjunction of terms - attempts to overcome even the subtle hier- archy implied by the copula and the "as well as" construction, while maintaining the radical image of a world turned upside-down. The Ranters' most daring critique of binary oppositions, however, is their supremely monotheistic attempt to remove the theological foundation of binary thought. Laurence Clarkson begins the poem prefacing his A Single Eye with an antibinary couplet: "Behold, the King of glory now is come / T'reduce God and Devil to their Doom." A familiar promise of the imminent millennium leads immediately to a radical negation of the received millenarian plot. In the next couplet Clarkson admits that this reductive King (Christ? Clarkson? both?) has been active in history as "God" but cannot be reduced to that concept alone: "Though called God, yet that is not my Name, / True, I be both, yet am I not the same" (p. 162). He embraces the principles of God and the Devil, yet is not the "same" as either or both. The awkwardness of "am I not the same" reverses Jehovah's transcenden- tal self-identity ("I am who am") and figures the Ranter quest for an identity governed by nonidentity - for a speaking voice that can avoid identification and prosecution in the present, and that can join an emerging collective in the future. The Ranters also conduct this critique of the opposition of God and the Devil at the level of scatological humor. The author of A Justifica- tion says that "the devil is but a part of Gods backsides" (p. 139), and A. L. Morton quotes from a seventeenth-century pamphlet reporting on a journeyman shoemaker who, when in his "Ranting mood, " proclaimed that "the Devil was nothing but the backside of God, and that it was but a scarecrow" (pp. 76-77). Even here, however, the Ranters seem to be working with Scripture, bringing out the full comic potential of Exodus 33.22-23, where God tells Moses, "And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:</page><page sequence="34">222 English Literary Renaissance and I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts; but my face shall not be seen." Gerrard Winstanley argues that the birth of social inequality and private property was not a response to the Fall, but equivalent to it. In their attempt to go beyond good and evil, the Ranters go one step further. Clarkson reads Genesis as an allegory about man's fall into binary ethics, for "sin hath its conception only in the imagination" (p. 169). The author of A Justification develops the same argument: "Man, innocent, holy upright man, tasting of the tree of knowledg of good and evil, comes to divide and separate that which God has joyned together, and thereby became accursed, calling one holy an- other unholy, this a good man, that an evilman, and so hates the one and loves the other, joyns to the one and separates from the other" (p. 144). The Ranters take the disturbing name of the tree literally: man does not sin against binary ethics - he ingests them and is poi- soned by them. Of course, these attempts by Ranters to solidify an oppositional collective were finally unsuccessful, as we can see from the oeuvres of Coppe, Clarkson, and Salmon, which follow a similar pattern. Each moves from early pamphlets of high ranting, to a period of arrest, imprisonment, and examination, to late pamphlets of recantation: Coppe's A Remonstrance of The sincere and Zealous Protestation and Copp's Return to the way es of Truth, Clarkson's The Lost Sheep Found, and Salmon's Heights in Depths. Bauthumley is the exception that proves the rule here, since the Army's iron had already probed his blasphemous tongue and shocked him into silence. And we can see a stylistic as well as a doctrinal alteration: whereas the early pamphlets are full of typographical and stylistic experimentation and are gov- erned by a fragmented speaking voice that hints at a radical collective in a state of becoming, the late pamphlets are governed by a more conventional "I" busily at work relating a straightforward spiritual autobiography, or refuting imputed heresies. Punishment produces an acceptable model of authority. But two important reservations. First, this shift of rhetoric was the product of a determinate encounter between a dominant subculture (Cromwell and Parliament) and a subordinate subculture (the Ran- ters), not the inevitable self-subversion of "allegedly subversive" dis- course. This shift was the Ranters' response to a specific act of repres- sion - a concept that Foucault's critique of "the repression hypothesis" in psychoanalysis has made almost unspeakable within new historicist</page><page sequence="35">James Holstun 223 discourse, as if any critical account of beastly official repression neces- sarily requires the critic to celebrate that which is repressed as a presocial, unconstructed, primal force. But we might characterize the history of the Ranters as precisely a dialectic of determinate repression and resistance. A particular act of repression - Parliament's crushing of the Levellers in 1649 - was one of the conditions for the Ranters' existence. In response, the Ranters avoided the Levellers' juridical and legislative rhetoric of resistance and attempted to appropriate their martyrdom in the name of an alternative resistance. Speaking in the voice of Christ, Abiezer Coppe prophesies a Night of the Living Levellers: "You have killed Levellers (so called) you also (with wicked hands) have slain me the Lord of life, whom am now risen and risen, indeed, (and you shall know, and feele it with a witnesse) to Levell you in good earnest. . . . The blood cryeth in mine eares, Vengeance, vengeance, vengeance, vengeance is mine, I will recompence" (p. 94). And the Ranters were repressed again in turn. In this dialectic of repression and resistance we need not see the Ranters as the autoch- thonous embodiment of self-authenticating resistance, but neither do we need to purge their repression of all its human and political reality and turn it into an inevitable effect of structure. And second, as Hill and Morton have argued, these Ranter recanta- tions were not absolute.36 Even inside these tracts written under duress, we can hear a familiar voice of Ranter resistance, and the Ranter dream of an erotic, materialist collective. Coppe's Remon- strance takes as its epigraph a favorite Ranter text - the passage from Luke 7.34 describing Christ as "a gluttonous man, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners," to which Coppe hopefully adds, "and Harlots" (p. 119). In Copp's Return, he defends himself against the imputations that he has denied God's superiority to his creatures, but he does so with eloquent deviousness. He instances God's capac- ity to contradict himself as the surest sign of his power. But this emphasis suggests the Ranters' own tendency to contradict received binary oppositions. And it works against the very point it ostensibly supports: just as God can contradict himself in Scripture, so Coppe in his recantation can contradict his earlier opinions, and yet remain his Godlike self; creature merges with creator. Furthermore, the specific scriptural contradiction Coppe points out - that between God's for- bidding fornication in Paul's epistles and directing Hosea "to take a 36. Hill, The World Turned Upside Down, p. 168; Morton, p. 108.</page><page sequence="36">224 English Literary Renaissance wife of whoredomes" - works obliquely to justify the Ranters' liber- tine sexuality (p. 140). Even imprisonment and the threat of banish- ment do not altogether erase the Ranters' impulse to prophesy and construct a new materialist collective. VI By now, I hope that my own attraction to the Ranter spirit of non- binarizing and nondemonizing polemic, and the indebtedness to new historicist practice implicit in my discussion of the Ranters have made my title a little clearer: to rant at the new historicism is not to attack it as flawed in its very being and rotten to the core.37 Rather, it is an attempt to get the new historicism to stop enforcing so rigorously its own self-policing binary codes, and this on both the level of canon (by ceasing to ignore radical literature or to imply that the canon already implies it) and on the level of method (by ceasing to lock horns with a largely specular vulgar Marxism). There is nothing radically incom- patible between new historicist practice to date and what I am propos- ing. Indeed, the new historicism has given us a knowledge of the political function of early modern literature and the symbolic invest- ments of early modern politics that we might have found utterly fantastic two decades ago. It has shown (with an analytical rigor and grace I have slighted) how systems of literary subjectification operate, revealing political turmoil where we once saw a coherent world view, constraining systems of social signification where we once saw a space of humanist freedom, and the production of hierarchized hu- man subjects where we once saw a benevolent Renaissance reflection of "the" modern self. It is the most powerful form of ideological analysis available for the study of early modern literature. And given the hardiness of idealist literary criticism, this ideological analysis must surely continue. Yet it is not too early to ask if this negative or anti-ideological hermeneutic is enough - to ask if we don't need to complement it with a positive or Utopian hermeneutic.38 To repeat my slogan with 37. See, for instance, Marguerite Waller's fierce but attenuated assault on the "racism" and "sexism" of Greenblatt's Renaissance Self-Fashioning, in "Academic Tootsie: The Denial of Difference and the Difference It Makes," Diacritics, 17, No. 1 (Spring 1987), 2-20. This is a familiar sight on the American left: while waiting for the Revolution, progressives keep themselves in fine fighting trim through a regular regimen of sorori- and fratricide. 38. I draw my distinction between ideological and Utopian analysis from Fredric Jameson,</page><page sequence="37">James Holstun 22 s some new variants: Christopher Hill as well as Michel Foucault; Ernst Bloch as well as Louis Althusser; Coppe and Clarkson as well as Sidney and Spenser. If the alternative to a metaphysical and trans- historical conception of the sovereign self is to be something other than the specter of sheer instrumental domination, or the inversion and celebration of that specter as the "decentered subject," then it seems to me it must be a vision of a new, more humane collective life. The appeal of early modern literature is not simply that it comes from a time when "the subject" has not yet thoroughly dissimulated the traces of its own social production, but also that it can reveal to us, springing up inside a linguistic and social order at least as oppressive and debilitating as our own, an oppositional vision of more humane collective life. Jacob Bauthumley gets the next-to-last word. In "The Epistle to the Reader" beginning his The Light and Dark Sides of God, he creates the image of an organic but only semiarticulate collective: "I know by experience, that there are some with whom my spirit sweetly closed in the Unity thereof, and that travell with me in the same birth; yet are not able to bring forth their conceptions, for so much as many times, the Truth suffers by a weake delivery; and for their sakes have I held this Glasse before them, that so they may be the better able to describe themselves to others; and to help them to bring forth that out of their mouths, which perhaps may lye in the bottome of their hearts" (p. 229). Bauthumley combines womb, heart, and mouth; childbirth, silent thought, and writing. He appropriates the role of the female midwife, but not as one who will hold permanent authority. Rather, he describes himself to others "so they may be the better able to describe themselves to others." This reflection he offers enables not self-recognition but a self-articulating chain of discourse. The literary study of oppositional and collective self-fashioning might aspire to a similar liberating dialogue with the oppositional collectives of the past and present.
