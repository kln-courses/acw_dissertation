The rich Early Bronze Age finds from the area, and its central position in the Aegean, made this lack all the more surprising. The abundant finds of Melian obsidian from the earliest Neolithic levels of Thessaly, Southern Greece, and Crete demonstrated at least that Melos was visited as early as the sixth millennium b.c. But it was the stray find near the village of Sangri in Naxos (Cook, 1946, 1 15) of a marble figurine of Neolithic type, a fat seated woman, which at last gave grounds for hoping that further discoveries would be made. Then in i960 the cemetery of Kephala in Kea, excavated by Professor J. L. Caskey, produced pattern-burnished pottery and other goods assignable to the end of the Neolithic period (Caskey, 1962; Caskey, 1964). There are signs, however, that the Kephala culture may be contemporary in part with the Grotta-Pelos culture of the Cycladic Early Bronze Age, and its discovery did not therefore solve the problem of the Cycladic Neolithic. The recognition in 1963, amongst surface finds from the islet of Saliagos, of Neolithic painted pottery and a sophisticated lithic industry thus held promise that ex- cavation might be rewarding, and might help to fill a serious gap in the knowledge of Aegean prehistory. Saliagos was first visited in 1959 by Mr. N. Zapheiropoulos, Ephor of Antiquities for the Cyclades, and the existence of prehistoric remains on the site was indicated by him in his annual report (Zapheiropoulos, i960, 247). His attention was apparently drawn to the site, together with a number of other sites of later date, during the course of his excavations at the Early Cycladic cemetery at Zoumbaria on Dhespotikon. It had been overlooked, perhaps on account of its curious position, by such earlier workers in the region as J. T. Bent, Tsountas, and Duncan Mackenzie. In 1963 the site was visited by Colin Renfrew, in the course of a systematic site survey for prehistoric settlements in the Cyclades. The quantities of worked obsidian, including tanged points, among the surface finds, together with distinctive white-painted pottery, made it clear that excavation would be worth while. Largely through the encouragement and co-operation of Mr. A. H. S. Megaw, Director of the British School of Archaeology at Athens, this idea became a practical possibility sponsored by the British School, and it was at this early stage that Professor J. D. Evans joined the project. Both Mr. Zapheiropoulos and Mr. Ch. Doumas, Epimelete of Antiquities for the Cyclades and a leading authority on Cycladic prehistory, generously waived their prior claim to the site, and . permission to excavate was obtained from the Greek Archaeological Administration. The excavations in 1964, which ran from 7 July to 14 August with an additional week for further study of the finds, had as their principal aim the recovery of a complete cultural assem- blage from the Cycladic Neolithic. Naturally it was hoped that structures would be recovered, and that a secure and complete sequence for the occupation of the island would be established. It was the intention also to set this cultural assemblage in the background of its environment. For this reason a project for underwater survey of the region was initiated, in the hope of understanding why Neolithic remains are found in so bizarre a situation, now an islet 100 metres in length. The aid was obtained of a geologist and palynologist, and arrangements were made for the specialist study of the animal bones, fish bones, mollusc shells, and grains recovered. The staff of the excavation in 1964 comprised Miss Jane Bagenal, Miss Linda Beigel, Miss Barbara Bender, Mr. Ian Clegg, Mrs. Evelyn Evans, Mr. Dino Gallis, Mr. Ian Morrison, Mr. Bill Phelps, Mrs. Jane Renfrew, and Mrs. Cressida Ridley, with the assistance of Mr. Martin C 4316 Β</page><page sequence="11">2 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Hartmann, Miss Judith Turner (palynologist) and Mr. John Dixon (geologist) . The under- water survey (for which a special permit was issued by the Greek Archaeological Service), using aqualung equipment, was conducted by Mr. Frank Irving, Mr. Mike Gee, and Mr. Bob Ward of Imperial College, London, and Mr. Robin Crump and Mr. Mike Hassell of Cambridge University. Twenty workmen from Antiparos were employed with Mr. Petros Frangiskos from Naxos, under the supervision of the foreman Mr. Vassilis Adamachos. Mr. Petros Petrakis restored the vases. Miss Iphigeneia Dekoulakou, representing the Ephor, was a frequent and welcome visitor to the site. Excavations were continued in 1965, from 5 July to 7 August, with a further two weeks for study of the finds, in order to complete the picture obtained from the results of the previous season. Particularly necessary was a further investigation of the stone building remains, and the excavation of a greater area in the deeper levels. The staff in 1965 were: Mrs. Evelyn Evans, Mr. Andrew Fleming, Mr. Sven Gram, Mr. Ian Kinnes, Mr. Ian Morrison, Miss Stephanie Page, Mr. Fred Petersen, Mr. Bill Phelps, Mrs. Jane Renfrew, Mrs. Cressida Ridley, Miss Ann Stoves, Mr. Ken Wardle, and Miss Gayle Wever with the assistance of Mr. N. J. Shackleton (shells). During this season the final plans and drawings for the report were prepared by Miss Ann Stoves (pottery and figurines), Miss Gayle Wever (pottery and obsidian), Mrs. Jane Renfrew (small finds and obsidian), Mr. Ken Wardle (sections), and Mr. Ian Morrison (plans), who was responsible throughout for the planning, undertaken by photogrammetric methods. Mr. Fred Petersen was responsible in 1965 for the photographic record. Twenty-five workmen from Antiparos were employed with Mr. Petros Frangiskos from Naxos under the direction of Mr. Stelios Karathanasis. The vases were restored by Mr. Petros Petrakis and Mr. Stavros Kasandris. Miss Anna Kontsa, the representative of the Ephor, made a number of welcome visits to the excavation. The village school was again made available for the study and storage of finds by the Greek Ministry of Education, through the courtesy of the Headmaster, Mr. Vassilis Kaloudas. The excavation was supported financially by grants from the British Academy, the Wenner- Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, the Faculty Board of Classics of the Uni- versity of Cambridge, the Seager Research Fund of the British School of Archaeology at Athens, the Childe Bequest Fund of the London University Institute of Archaeology, and the Crowther- Benyon Fund of Cambridge University. The cost of publication has been met by a generous grant from the Faculty Board of Classics of the University of Cambridge. The Radiocarbon samples were analysed by the Radiocarbon laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Pennsylvania, through the kindness of Dr. E. K. Ralph and Dr. Robert Stuckenrath Jnr. Professor R. J. Hopper has kindly seen the publication through the press. To all those colleagues and helpers, who were responsible for the solution of many problems and for the successful completion of the enterprise, and to the generosity of these institutions, our thanks are due. We are very grateful to our many friends in Antiparos who made the two seasons of excavation in their lovely island so very agreeable an experience. March 1966 J. D. E. A. C. R.</page><page sequence="12">I THE SITE AND ITS LOCATION Antiparos, the ancient Oliaros, an island some n kilometres long lying immediately to the west of Paros, was best known in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for its cave, cele- brated by Wordsworth (1850) : As when a Traveller hath from open day With torches passed into some Vault of Earth, The Grotto of Antiparos, or the Den Of Yordas among Craven's mountain tracts; He looks and sees the cavern spread and grow. . . . Here it was that in 1673 the Marquis de Nointel, ambassador of Louis XIV to the Sublime Porte, spent Christmas sleeping in the cave with his entire entourage of 500 persons, and cele- brating mass at 'le grand autel', formed by stalactitic and stalagmitic accretions (Tournefort, 1 741). Traces of occupation of the island go back, however, to a much earlier date, and the museums and private collections of Europe are the richer for quantities of goods from the Early Cycladic cemeteries: the British Museum from the finds of J. T. Bent (Bent, 1884), the National Museum at Athens from the excavations of Tsountas (Tsountas, 1898) and numerous collec- tions from the finds of less scrupulous workers, signs of whose recent researches are still visible in many parts of the island. At its north end Antiparos is separated only by a narrow passage from the promontory of Pounda on Paros (fig. i). This is the strait which the British Admiralty chart for 1889 calls the 'Fourteen Foot Pass of Kastro'. It is shallow and remains a difficult passage for shipping. In this channel lie three small islands, now known to the Antipariotes as Epano, Mesaio, and Kato Nisaki, but formerly termed Magrines, Saliagos, and Remmatonisi respectively. The second of these, barely one hundred metres in length, was the site of our excavations. The small islet of Saliagos rises today to a height of less than 5 metres above the present sea level (plate i). Buffeted in summer by the brisk Meltemi, the prevailing north wind, and in winter by the stronger south wind, its rock, a conglomerate of marble set in a calcareous matrix (Appendix III), has been cut at the north end to give sheer cliffs some 3 metres in height, falling to the sea. It is remarkable that any soil-cover should be left on the island at all, for like so many low prominences in the Cyclades, the neighbouring islets of Magrines and Remmatonisi are almost totally without soil (cf. Appendix V). Yet although the highest part and much of the north-east and north-west sides are eroded almost to the bare rock, leaving a thick scatter of obsidian, there is, at the south, a considerable area where soil is preserved to a depth sometimes exceeding two metres. This soil is covered and held in place by a thick thorny scrub which provides a home for the many land snails, the Σαλιγγάρια from which the island takes its name (cf. Appendix IX). It is clear that the area of settlement was originally rather larger than the present islet, for building remains project and are being constantly eroded in the cliffs at the northern and southern ends, while there is a thick scatter of obsidian exposed on the bare rock at the east and west sides. The area of occupation was, however, localized, for only very scanty traces of human</page><page sequence="13">t^s^zz^Svros^a^MAVRI S Ρ IL I A^i^, I asos τ-λ ÎW^AGRlLIAp^L^^^Kalimïïos^è^^Tç i=k τ-λ ;f Melos?ÇP J^ÇrKerost1 - ^-&lt;^^5,^ V ^&gt; · ; &lt;J- ÇJ^ i ^ :^i Q/ ; 25 E; 250 ; , ^500/1 ι il ' Τ ι ι ill Km 5 10 15 K"y/ - ANTIPAROS « i^_k^ ~ WEST PAROS Paroikiassr 25°E -^ !

It was to investigate the original configuration of this area that a project of underwater survey was conducted by divers from Imperial College, London, and Cambridge University, together with Mr. Ian Morrison of Edinburgh University. They made a systematic topographical survey of the sea bed in the neighbourhood of Saliagos and collected a considerable body of evidence for sea-level changes in the Antiparos area. Among the indications discovered was a partially submerged system of trenches, cut in the rock of Paros, Antiparos, and Remmatonisi in Helle- nistic times, probably for viticulture. These trenches were the subject of a subsidiary excavation on Antiparos itself in 1964, and the results of this excavation together with a detailed account of the underwater survey will be published separately. For the present it is sufficient to state the principal conclusion resulting from this work : it is probable that the level of the sea in relation to the land is at present some 6 or more metres higher in the Antiparos area than it was in Neolithic times. In consequence Antiparos would then have been linked to Paros by an isthmus, from which a promontory, surmounted by the low hill of Saliagos, projected to the north (fig. 24 (lower)). The evidence upon which these conclusions are based is summarized in Appendix I. In the light of this information the occupation of Saliagos in Neolithic times becomes more understandable. The site was then a low hill at the tip of a short promontory projecting north- wards into the magnificent and sheltered bay of Paros-Antiparos. It commanded the causeway linking Antiparos with the main body of Paros, and had bays suitable for the beaching of ships both to east and to west. Fresh water was perhaps locally available, for there is today an under- sea fresh-water spring off the west side of Remmatonisi whose location would then have been above sea level. In short, the site was a very attractive one. The same changes that subsequently separated Antiparos from Paros, and reduced the fertile land, still used in Hellenistic times for systematic viticulture, to barren and rocky slopes, cut the causeway and promontory in several places, forming the small islands of Saliagos and Remma- tonisi, together with many shallows dangerous to shipping. Until 1964, when excavations began, Saliagos was used only for the occasional grazing of a few undernourished sheep.</page><page sequence="15">π THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EXCAVATIONS Before any excavation work was begun in 1964 the material lying exposed on the surface was studied. A grid of 10-metre squares covering the whole of the island was laid out, and surface material was then collected systematically from a sample selection of these in 1 -metre squares in two main areas. In practice the material collected was chiefly chipped stone, since polished stone objects were rare, and materials other than stone, including pottery, disintegrate rapidly once exposed to weathering. A considerable quantity of obsidian was recovered by this means, and comparison of this in detail with the material recovered from the excavations has yielded useful results. After the completion of the surface collecting, the first task was to determine the depth of soil in various parts of the island and to decide on the most fruitful areas for extensive investigation. Beginning at the north end a 1 -metre- wide trench, Z, was cut southwards across the island, leaving 1 -metre baulks every five metres. The object of this was to test the soil-cover over the whole island and to give a complete section of it (fig. 3). At the same time, since, from surface inspection, the southern part of the island seemed to promise the greatest depth of soil, Squares L and K, whose western sides lay on the line of the western edge of Trench Z, were laid out and excavation was begun in them (see fig. 2). In Trench Ζ bedrock was met with everywhere at a very shallow depth (except for occasional irregular pockets in the rock) . Archaeological material was found in all the sections of this trench, but no traces of structures apart from the amorphous ccairn' of small stones which lay near the highest point of the island. It was abundantly clear that the whole centre of the island had very little soil-cover (fig. 3). This was true also of the extreme north, but it was nevertheless decided to open an area here because surface material was relatively abundant, and the ex- posed section of the north cliff indicated a greater depth of soil at certain points. Area Y was therefore begun by incorporating Zi into a Square Yi and the area was later extended by the addition of Squares Y2, 3, and 4. Very little in the way of structural remains was found in this area, and the soil proved to be very shallow over most of it (fig. 13 and plate xiv). However, near the eastern end of it a deep hollow in the rock was found which was filled with occupation deposit rich in archaeological material. In the southern part of the island Squares L and Κ formed the nucleus of a grid of 10-metre squares, which were each divided for excavation into four 4-metre squares with 1 -metre baulks between. The baulks left between each of the large squares were also 1 metre wide. Aligned originally on the north-south trench, Z, the squares of the southern grid have sides which correspond roughly to the four cardinal points, and for the purposes of this report such corre- spondence will be assumed to be exact. Several of the squares forming this grid were later joined up by the removal of baulks, and these will be referred to in what follows as 'the Main Area'. Operations in the Main Area were at first somewhat impeded by the presence of a partially wrecked cist-grave of megalithic character which was christened the 'dolmen' (fig. 4 and plate iv, b). Before removal, this 'dolmen' was carefully examined. The small cairn of loose stones around it was excavated on the quadrant principle, and the deposit in the chamber itself was carefully sectioned. The monument proved to contain only the remains of a disturbed burial,</page><page sequence="16">5 METRES 4 ! ' S ** ^y^S^ BEDROCK o~s^~$fi^j'^&gt;^ ^ ^ ? ? * ' * 7 ? ?

Several of the 4-metre squares (R4, Li and 2, P3, Q2, Ki and 2, and Ni) were then joined up into a single area by the removal of the baulks between them in order to facilitate the recognition of any lines of wall foundations. The stone spread was then examined by removing first the smaller and looser stones, keeping a close watch for the appearance of any indications of stones deliberately set in line. By the end of the 1964 season it was clear that we were in fact dealing with building-remains in the central, or Main Area (plate m, é), though their interpretation remained highly problematical. Two long stretches of wall, running south- west and south-east respectively, had been identified, and these seemed to join in the extreme north of Square K3. Abutting on the north-east face of the second were several small rectangular spaces, and elsewhere, too, within the space enclosed by the long walls, rows of stones, evidently deliberately laid, could be seen in puzzling profusion, (plate xi, a). Meanwhile, to the south of the Main Area, in Squares K3 and Oi, excavations were carried down to bedrock through a maximum of rather over 2 metres of deposit (fig. 5, plate iv, a). In 0 1 an irregular pit, Pit B, was found in the bedrock, which proved to be very rich in well- preserved fragments of pottery, some of which were later found to be partially restorable. Squares K4 and N3 were also excavated to bedrock, but the deposit in these proved to be considerably shallower, except for one area in the south-west corner of K4 where there was a deep hollow in the bedrock. In both K3 and N3 were found traces of building-remains at a lower level than the stone spread of the Main Area (plate viu, è), and these raised hopes of the existence of an earlier building level extending over much of the southern area. Work was resumed in 1965 with two main objects in view, the further elucidation of the structures in the Main Area and the exploration on a larger scale of the deeper levels. A number of new squares (S4, R3, T2, Qi, T4, and Q3) were laid out at the beginning of the second season to the west of the Main Area (fig. 2), this part being chosen because it seemed likely from surface indications that there might be a considerable depth of deposit here. Square R3 proved to be of great importance to the study of the structures in the Main Area, since it was shown to contain a corner of what could now be regarded as a perimeter wall surrounding the whole of the structures uncovered in the Main Area in the previous season. This corner proved to be a massive circular bastion-like structure, and traces were observed of at least one remodelling of the building at this point. The north-west section of the perimeter wall was picked up here by means of Trench Ri /R2 and was followed for a few feet. However, all traces disappeared as the soil became shallower on the higher ground to the north-east. An attempt to locate the north-east wall of the perimeter by means of Squares Ui and U2 (see fig. 2) was also unsuccessful, nothing having been preserved in the very shallow deposit in this area. Some further work was also carried out in 1965 within the area enclosed by the perimeter wall with the object of clarifying the plan of the internal walls. In addition, Squares L3 and Ki and the northern half of K3 were excavated down to the rock, which in fact proved to be only a little below the level of the building foundations, except in K3, where the rock was found to dip sharply on the southern side. Squares S3, S4, R3, T2, Qi, and T4 also provided important evidence about the earlier phases in the habitation of the site. The deeper levels which were found in these, as also in Squares K3 and Oi, only existed in a fringe around the edge of the sloping platform of rock on which the central large rectangular building uncovered in the Main Area was set. This platform fell away sharply on the west and south, and it was beyond this step in the rock that the deep deposits had accumulated. In several of the squares mentioned traces of small structures were</page><page sequence="25">10 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS found below the level of the tumble from the collapse of the main central building. The most important examples were two small rectangular buildings in S4 (fig. 6 and plates v, b' vi), and a curious circular structure in T2 and T4 (fig. 7 and plate vii) which lay at approximately the same depth and which showed, like the rectangular buildings, traces of having been more than once altered and renewed. In R3 traces of a wall and floors (plate iv, c) were found at an even deeper level, not far above bedrock. These were the earliest structural remains identified. On the basis of the stratigraphy and building-remains in the deep squares it was possible to distinguish three main phases (Strata 1, 2, and 3) in the deposit, and the material from three of these squares (R3, S4, and Qi), in particular the pottery and obsidian, was selected for intensive quantitative study, the results of which are set out below in the relevant sections. In addition to the work just described in the Main Area and the squares to the west of it, the eroded section of the deposit on the south and south-west sides of the island was trimmed back to expose the stratigraphy more clearly (fig. 2) and this long section was duly recorded. In the course of this work various finds of interest were made, especially the built hearth (fig. 14 and plate xv, a), the marble fiddle idol (plate xliii, i), and Pit A (plate v, a), a second irregular hollow like Pit B, whose contents, embedded in the sticky clay filling, made notable additions to our knowledge of the diet of the Saliagos people (see below, p. 79). The separation of the often fragile remains from the matrix presented a delicate problem, and was achieved by sieving the entire contents of the pit in baskets, which, when filled with the material from the pit, were held in the sea and gently agitated. In this way the soil-particles were gradually washed away, leaving behind all other material in the bottom of the basket. At the end of the excavation work in 1965 the excavated areas were left open, but a certain amount of work was done with the object of helping the conservation of the excavated struc- tures. The west half of R3, which had been excavated to bedrock, was filled in to the level of the base of the perimeter wall to stabilize the position of the 'bastion' and its buttress, and to prevent them from collapsing into the western half of the square, which they must otherwise soon have done. The south and west sides of the circular structure in T3 and T4, which lay right on the edge of the deposit, were protected by laying fresh stones around as a protection against wave- damage, while the whole structure was covered up with brushwood and soil to give some pro- tection against winter storms. The processing of the material found was carried on during the excavations in both seasons, and completed immediately after the cessation of work on the site. All pottery was sorted and described as it came in, while in the 1965 season that from the three selected squares mentioned above was analysed in detail, every feature sherd being counted, sometimes more than once if it displayed a number of distinctive traits. A detailed record was also kept of the weight of pottery from the various levels in all areas. All the obsidian found was subjected to a detailed analysis, special attention being paid not only to finished pieces, but to the waste also. Again a detailed record was kept of the weight of material found. All feature sherds and all obsidian with secondary working as well as a systematic selection of the waste material of both categories were preserved. The sheer bulk of the remaining waste material made its disposal imperative, and it was returned to the island and discarded in the deep pit in Square K4, already mentioned. Small finds were also recorded and classified, while non-artefactual materials such as bone (including fish-bone), shell, grain, etc., were studied by a variety of specialists. Drawing and photography of the material kept pace with the other work, so that by the end of the second season, after nine weeks of excavation and three devoted exclusively to the study of the finds, the whole material was ready to be deposited finally in the Paros Museum.</page><page sequence="26">Ill MATERIAL Ι ν the concluding stages of the excavation it proved possible to make a stratigraphie division into three strata in the deep deposits west of the Main Area. Stratum ι is the earliest. These were necessarily somewhat arbitrary divisions, but they were made with due attention to the building levels, and they rest upon a sound stratigraphie basis (see figs. 3 and 5), reliably extrapolated for the Squares R3, S3, S4, Qi, Q3, Q4, T2, and T4. It proved possible also to carry these stratigraphical divisions to Squares K3 and Oi. In Squares N3 and K4, however, it was not possible to distinguish between Strata 1 and 2. In the Main Area, in Area Y to the north, in the long series of trenches Z2 to Z9 and in Vi it was not possible to make a correlation with the strata defined for the deep squares west of the Main Area. Finds from these un- differentiated squares, most of which have only a limited depth of soil, are thus classified as belonging to Strata 1, 2, or 3, and are catalogued in a separate section. In the account which follows, the principal finds are listed by stratum in the catalogue sections following the description of the building-remains. Further details of find spots will be found in the sections devoted to the finds, and in the notes to the figures. To give an over- all quantitative impression of the finds from the site, a careful count was made of all the excavated material, including waste material of every kind, from a chosen 4-metre square, Square S4. The results are summarized in Table 1 where an estimate of the volume of soil in each excavated level is also given. Although there was naturally variation in the density of finds between squares, and S4 was one of the deeper squares, the results may be taken as broadly typical of finds for the site as a whole. STRATUM 1 The base of Stratum 2 is defined by an over-all spread visible in Square S4, doubtless corre- sponding to a habitation level, and overlaid by considerable quantities of potsherds. The level could be traced in adjoining squares. Materials below it are classed as belonging to Stratum 1 (see Sections, figs. 3 and 5). Building remains were few in the excavated deposits of Stratum 1. More typical were remains of hearth areas, which were found in both Squares S3 and S4, associated with or underlying a clear and thick white floor in Square S3 (see Section, fig. 3). The white material from which this floor was made was in fact the decayed limestone (see Appendix V) which is the bedrock over much of the site. The many declivities in this bedrock, observed over much of the excavated area, may be due to the deliberate excavation of the material by the original inhabitants for constructional purposes. In Square R3 was a declivity, cut through the earlier levels of Stratum 1 which were preserved in the north half of the square. In this hollow were remains of a floor with an associated wall, Wall C, of which only a short length was preserved (fig. 6; plate iv, c). It was formed by a double row of stones, with only a single course now preserved, running in a north-west /south- east direction. At the north-west end it ran beneath the buttress belonging to Stratum 3, while at the south-east end it disappeared beneath the baulk dividing Square R3 from Square Qi.

No evidence was found for the nature of the superstructure of this wall. In Square Çh, to the east, no building-remains were found, but three whole pots were recovered, resting upon scanty traces of a floor, immediately above bedrock. In general, below the traces of floors of Stratum 1, deposits of waste material were found, often blackened by fire. These deposits often lay within hollows in the bedrock, some of which appeared to have been made by human action. Such hollows and scoops frequently contained large quantities of stones. In Square S4 they clearly underlay the main floor level. Stratum 1 in Squares K3 and Oi was likewise represented mainly by deposits lying in hollows in the bedrock. Of these, the most important was Pit A (see fig. 2 and plate V, a)9 lying slightly to the south-west of Square Oi. It was found in cleaning the low cliff along the southern shore of the island, in order to produce a vertical section. Pit Β was similar in nature, and occupied much of the area of Square Oi. Both were filled with a rich sticky deposit, waterlogged as a result of their proximity to the sea. The fill showed localized tip levels of sticky black appear- ance, which were sampled for radiocarbon determination (Appendix XII). It contained very large quantities of potsherds in exceptionally good condition, together with food refuse of various kinds in excellent preservation. These pits were very irregular in outline, undercut in places. They contained no natural and sterile silting deposit, which suggests that they were humanly made. They may have been dug to provide the natural white marl which was used on the site for floors and sometimes for the packing of wall foundations. In K3, as elsewhere, the Stratum- 1 deposits lay immediately upon bedrock, with little or no intervening soil or humus of natural formation. This circumstance would suggest that the pro- montory of Saliagos had, at the time of its initial occupation, no very deep covering of soil. CATALOGUE OF PRINCIPAL MATERIAL FROM STRATUM I.

STRATUM 2 The base of Stratum 2 is defined by the over-all spread in Square S4, representing a habi- tation level (Square S4 Lio). This spread and the whole pots lying on it belong to Stratum 2. The top of Stratum 2 is defined in Square R3 by a habitation-spread on the floor level running up to the rounded corner or 'bastion' of the principal edifice in the Main Area, which belongs in its present form to Stratum 3. In Square S4, remains of a wall (Wall D), of which five stones were preserved, run west- south-west from the east baulk of the square. Only a single course of this wall was preserved. Its width was about 30 cm. (fig. 6). To the north-west of the wall lay a small, roughly circular hearth area, about 1 metre in diameter. This hearth formed part of a general habitation-spread seen in most of Square S4 and running up to Wall D. Upon this spread, about 1 metre to the north-west of the hearth, three whole pots were found. Some 22 cm. above the top course of Wall D lay the foundations of a room, Structure E, roughly square in plan, also belonging to Stratum 2. The original floor of this room was a very</page><page sequence="31">l6 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS hard pebble and clay mixture, which could be seen overlying the top of Wall D in the east section of the square. It was not well preserved in the northern part of the room. Resting upon this floor was a tumble of stones with some black earth and traces of burning. About 30 cm. above the original floor level of Structure Ε and level with its third course of stones was a second floor, 2 cm. in thickness, of hard clean white plaster. It was clearly visible only in the south-east corner of the square, and was not preserved up against the walls of the structure. The ~S4 · · · * ^Ί Γ~ Γ7 rT 1 1 1 im. _J I.A.M. P^ Ql Fig. 6.

Wall c of Stratum 1 in Square R3 is shown in black find of a tumble of stones, with traces of burning, as described, between these two floors, presumably represents a collapse or destruction, at least in part, of the edifice. The east wall of Structure Ε was clearly visible in Square R3, although not in such good preservation as the remains in Square S4. The north-east corner doubtless lay beneath the baulk between the squares, and indeed only the corner of the structure at the north-west was exposed during the excavation. However, part at least of the south wall was uncovered during the partial removal of the baulk between Squares R3 and Qi, so that the approximately square plan was reliably established by the exposure of at least part of all four walls (fig. 6; plates v, b; vi, a. Lying 1 metre to the west of the west wall of Structure E, and parallel to it, ran Wall F (plate vi, b) . This was similar in structure, although made with slightly larger stones, packed with white marl. If it enclosed a room, the other walls were not preserved (unless perhaps the south wall, possibly below the baulk between Squares S4 and T2). The general appearance of the wall, and its parallel orientation to Structure Ε nearby, suggested that the two might be contemporary.</page><page sequence="32">MATERIAL 17 A small partition wall within the space enclosed by Wall F was represented by a small line of stones, running west-south-west at right angles to it. They were embedded in a clay floor which had an underlying foundation of large flat stones. An earlier structure was indicated beneath this layer of flat stones by a short stretch of wall on the same lines as the partition wall. I.A.M. ° &gt; o ΠΙ. li ι ι ι Fig. 7. Structure G showing the three successive floors The top of this wall, which again was preserved only to a single course, was on a level with the flat stones described, while below the wall lay remains of a second, earlier floor. Beneath a curved stretch of wall of Stratum 3, Wall H, located in Squares T2 and T4, a well-preserved circular structure, Structure G, was uncovered. This structure was very well built, and bounded by a circular wall of diameter 4 metres. It was partly destroyed by the action of the sea at the south-west side. The circular wall, preserved to a height of two courses, was formed by two lines of stones, lying together to give a width of some 40 cm. The area enclosed was floored with carefully laid stones, several times renewed (fig. 7 ; plate vii) . C 4316 C</page><page sequence="33">l8 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS The earliest floor was of rather large, rounded, flattish stones, up to about 25 cm. in length. Immediately above was a very well laid second floor of similar character. The stones of this second floor were much blackened by fire, and patches of burnt material, which included at least 100 grains of barley and emmer wheat (Appendix X), lay upon them. Immediately above, again with no intervening depth of deposit, came a regular, well-laid spread of smaller stones, up to 10 cm. in size. They were mainly irregular in shape, and of quartz, while the larger ones below were principally of schist and were of more regular and rounded form. The uppermost floor was overlaid by dark soil. The sherds in this area were not particularly numerous : the finds included a broken terra- cotta figurine (fig. 77. 1 ; plate xlv, i). The function of the structure was not clear. It was surely rather small for habitation. The burning of the stones, and the burnt material, might be taken to indicate the deliberate use of fire, perhaps for some specialized purpose. There was no evi- dence to establish whether the superstructure, if it existed, was of stone or clay. But had it been of clay, traces of burnt and baked clay would surely have been found. The drying of grain is perhaps made unlikely by the rather large size and by the absence of superstructure. It could perhaps have been a grain storage silo, in which case the observed burning would have been accidental. Similar structures, apparently for that purpose, were found in the Chalcolithic levels at Mersin (Garstang, 1953, Pis. m and iv). No building-remains of Stratum 2 were found in Square S3, but in the north-west corner a hearth area together with a great quantity of pottery was recovered, occupying some depth of soil. They appeared to belong chiefly to Stratum 2, although it is possible that the build-up began in the later part of Stratum 1. A marble figurine of schematic form (fig. 76. 1 and plate xliii, 1) and another of red stone (fig. 78. 2 and plate xliv, i) also came from this deposit. Deposits of Stratum 2, but no structures, were also found in Squares K3 and Oi. CATALOGUE OF PRINCIPAL MATERIAL FROM STRATUM 2.

STRATUM 1 OR 2 In Squares K4 and N3, deposits anterior to Stratum 3 were identified, but it did not prove possible to allocate them specifically to Stratum 1 or Stratum 2 with any confidence. Both squares contained a great deal of obsidian, and in K4 in particular the deposit contained a heavy spread of pottery, including some reconstructible vessels, lying close to bedrock. In Square N3 were two stretches of curved wall lying upon bedrock (fig. 8; plate viii, b).

STRATUM 3 The top of Stratum 3, in those squares where a division into strata was feasible, was deter- mined by the formation of the topsoil on the site. Its base was defined in Square R3 by the floor- spread running up to the circular corner or 'bastion' of the impressive wall in that square. This round corner forms part of a large building complex, rectangular in plan, which covered much of the Main Area of the excavation (fig. 10; plate ix). At least two phases of construction were identifiable at the corner, of which the earlier is contemporary with the floor-spread at the base of Stratum 3. The corner seems indeed to belong to the earliest identifiable phase of the central building complex. This structural complex represents almost the sum-total of the building-remains assignable to Stratum 3. Outside the complex in the Main Area no structural remains of importance of this period were found, although there was a widespread stone tumble, to be related to the de- struction or collapse of the central building complex. This lack of structural remains of any kind in its immediate vicinity was very striking. The building complex appears to have been enclosed by a roughly rectangular wall, portions</page><page sequence="38">líj í s I La ' ! jl S - ι i-^- R -- Lj - L 1 - Ρ 3 4 3 14 3 ; 4 3 ' Ι ι ' . .

The area enclosed had a breadth of 15 metres, and a length of at least 1 7 metres. No trace was found of the north-east wall, which lay outside the excavated area. Efforts to recover the eastward continuation of the south-east wall, sought for in squares in Ui and U2 met with no success. Bedrock was found very close to the surface, at a depth of 20-40 cm., in these squares, and it seems unlikely that it was very much deeper further to the north-east (see section YY1, fig. 3). Any building-remains so close to the surface could well have been seriously disturbed. The portion of the south-east wall which fell within the excavated area consisted of a single row of large stones, up to a height of about 50 cm. and a thickness of 30 cm. Although there was no packing of smaller stones between, these large stones formed an impressive row (plate iii, b). There were, however, some gaps in this long row of stones: they may perhaps have been caused by the robbing of the wall for the 'dolmen' in historic times. It was not possible to determine whether this section of the outer wall may originally have had a greater thickness, since no other stones of comparable size were found in the area. The southern corner of the complex, formed by the intersection of this wall with the south-east wall, was notably less well preserved than the corresponding western corner. We were not able to follow the face of the south-east wall clearly at all points here, and indeed the character of the walling changed, since the south-west wall is constructed of smaller stones. A short line of stones of an earlier date which ran eastwards from below this corner is probably to be assigned to Stratum 2. The south-west wall was more complex. The southern stretch was built of relatively small but well-laid stones, becoming thicker towards the south. It stood in places some three or four courses high. Further north these stones became larger and the interpretation was less easy since they were not so regularly laid. The western corner of the building and the stretches of wall adjoining it were, on the other hand, the most impressive portions, and the best preserved, of the whole complex. Here indeed it was possible to distinguish at least two constructional phases in the masonry (fig. ii). The projecting buttress and a stretch of wall intersecting it at right angles on the south-east side, but running within the line of the earlier south-west face (fig. ι ι ; plate χ) were clearly later modifications. The original corner was circular in shape, and extremely massive in con- struction, somewhat resembling a bastion. The adjoining portions of the south-west and north-west walls were equally impressively built. The whole character of the masonry at this corner might reasonably be held to suggest a defensive purpose, though the remaining lengths of the perimeter wall certainly have no such character in their present condition. The north-west wall could be followed only over a short distance, owing to the shallowness of the soil further north. The remaining stretch, however, about 6 metres long, was well preserved. Like the western corner itself it showed traces of two phases of construction, where a new outer face was added at a slightly different angle. All these modifications suggest the repair or reconstruction, on at least one occasion, of the western corner. A few stones in Square R3 which lay upon the floor-spread which was taken to define the base of Stratum 3 and the original construction of the circular corner, were overlaid by a later floor-spread, running up to the projecting buttress. These may well be evidence of a partial collapse of the corner preceding the restorations, and the addition of the supporting buttress. The position of the new outer face of the south-west wall within the original line of the outer face suggests that these reconstructions were on a large scale, involving the complete rebuilding of a considerable part of the wall.</page><page sequence="55">ΊΓϊ Ι r^ it ^^ ι ι iml c&gt;^ 1-A.M. ^^ ^o( Fig. ii. The western corner of the perimeter wall with buttress and 'bastion*. The rebuilt parts ARE SHADED</page><page sequence="56">MATERIAL 25 When first uncovered, the upper part of the central building complex presented an amorphous mass of stones (fig. 9). One or two lines of larger stones were at once apparent at several points. The smaller stones were cleared away wherever they did not appear to have been regularly and intentionally laid. The result of this process of clearing tumbled stones and of interpretation is seen in the plan, Fig. 10. The interpretation of the lines of stones within the perimeter wall presents a number of difficulties, since they were never observed to stand more than two or three courses high. Certain points are at once apparent. The lines in some areas (for example Squares L3 and L4) lie so close together that they could not possibly all have been wall foundations (plate xi, a). Perhaps they supported a floor structure, possibly of wood, in this area. In other areas (for example in Square Q2) the lines are evidently the foundations of walls of some kind, but the small size of the areas enclosed and the absence of entrances suggest that they were substructures - cellars or storerooms - with the main living floor situated at a higher level (plate xi, b). We are thus forced to recognize two patterns of arrangement, corresponding to at least two constructional functions, in these lines of stones. The lines serving as wall foundations are most clearly seen near the south-west perimeter wall, against which they abut, forming small com- partments. In one of these traces of a white plaster floor was found, but the small size of the compartment and the absence of an entrance suggest that this was not a living area. The peri- meter wall itself must have formed one side of these rooms. Further to the south the walls of the structures are no longer at right angles to the perimeter wall, nor do they intersect with it clearly. Further east, towards the centre of the building complex, the remains have been much dis- turbed by the construction of the Roman 'dolmen5, so that it was not possible to form a clear impression of the original nature of the remains in this area. In the northern part of the Main Area, principally in Squares L3 and L4, lines of stones of the other pattern, perhaps floor supports, were found. Lines of very small stones ran parallel, rarely more than 40 cm. apart (plate xi, a). Some ran in a north-east to south-west direction, while others intersected with them, approximately at right angles. The area immediately behind the 'bastion' showed some rather special features. There was a roughly square space, of length one and a half metres, adjoining the north-west and south- west portions of the perimeter wall inside the corner. At the north-west, and possibly at the south-west, the sides of this space are formed by the original internal faces of the perimeter wall, which here stands to a height of several courses. The dry-walling is neat, and at the south-west is formed of rather flat stones (plate xii, a). A tumble of such stones, still in their courses, but fallen and standing vertically upon the ground, was found a little to the south (plate xii, b). It would certainly appear to be a fallen portion of a wall of similar character. There is, in general, little evidence for the nature of the construction of the main building complex above foundation level. Insufficient traces of superstructure were found to allow of any certain conclusion. Quantities of stones were indeed found as tumble over much of the site, but were not sufficient to account for walls of any considerable height, had the entire building been constructed of drystone walling. It is of course possible that stones were removed from the site at a time when it was still a peninsula. It seems likely that any raised floor levels, for which substructures were indeed found, were made of wood. But the complete absence of any remains of solid wood charcoal was a striking feature of the excavations. Wood may then have been a precious material in the Cyclades, as it certainly is today, and it is not inconceivable that it was removed after the abandonment of the settlement. But it remains surprising that none was burnt on any large scale during the life of the site.</page><page sequence="57">26 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Both burnt and unburnt clay were found in small quantities at various points. A single small wattle impression was also recovered. In Square Ki burnt clay was found associated with walling, but several of the fragments were shaped, suggesting that they may have formed some structure such as a hearth abutting on the wall, rather than part of the wall structure itself. There was no evidence of mud brick, but in two cases small areas of rather clean clay were seen in section, and might have derived from a wall structure of pisé or of unbaked mud brick.

The circular scoop (right) of Stratum 3 in Square S3 One of these deposits, indeed, lay against the foundations of a wall in the west face of Square K3 (cf. Appendix V), but the small quantities of clay observed seem to preclude its being a major component in the structure. On balance it seems that a construction basically of stone is the most probable. Outside the south-west wall near its southern end were several lines of stones, doubtless foundations of some small structure, whose interpretation is not clear. These were the only traces of any construction at all close to the perimeter wall and lying outside it. Further to the west, however, in Squares T2 and T4, two short stretches of wall were identified. One of these lay above and just within the circular Structure G of Stratum 2, and was itself apparently curved. In Square S3 was a striking circular scoop, lined with small flat schist slabs, lying at an angle of about 45o to the horizontal and apparently set into the tumble derived from the collapse of the main building (fig. 12 and plate xiii, a). This and one or two circular patches of stones of</page><page sequence="58">MATERIAL 27 doubtful interpretation (plate xiii, b) are the only signs of continuing occupation after the abandonment of the main building. The only evidence for later occupation of the site is a thin scatter of rather nondescript Hellenistic and Roman sherds and the Roman burial, with its associated clay lamp (fig. 22; plate xli) from the 'dolmen'.

OTHER MATERIAL (STRATUM 1, 2, OR 3) This section is devoted to constructions and finds which could not be included in one of the three main strata distinguished. Areas of deposit remote from those in which the division into strata was made could not be related to it directly, although they are doubtless contemporary. In the Main Area the absence in many squares of deposits recognizably of Stratum 1 or 2 does not imply a lack of occupation during those phases or of finds from them. There is simply no way of assigning this material with confidence to a specific phase. All this material presents the same characteristics as that from the better stratified deposits, and there is no reason to believe that any of it is later in date than the period occupied by Stratum 3. The most important area of excavation outside the main (southern) area was at the northern extremity of the island, in Squares Yi to Y4. Over almost all this area the bedrock was found close to the surface, and although the entire area had clearly been inhabited, very little was found by way of recognizable structures. The area had suffered from erosion by the sea as well as from denudation of the soil, and it was impossible to tell how much of the site on the northern side may have been removed in this way. The remains of structures identified are limited to two lines of stones running east to west in the north part of the area (fig. ι 3 ; plate xiv) . The more easterly of these had a corner formed by another line of stones at right angles. But this orthogonal line has been almost entirely de- stroyed by the collapse of the cliff through erosion. Below the eastern stretch of the wall was a deposit some 1-50 metres in depth, in a hollow in the rock. This was clearly stratified and contained much blackened material, including well-preserved sherds and a small figurine of burnt bone (plate xliv, 3). In Trench V, at the south-east of the island, deposits 1 -metre deep were found. Below a spread of stones, probably a tumble, was a stretch of well-made wall foundation (fig. 14). At a lower level, just above bedrock and near the sea-edge of the deposit, was a small, square, stone-built hearth of length 1 metre (plate xv, d). This contained a mass of black material, some of which was sampled for radiocarbon analysis. CATALOGUE OF PRINCIPAL MATERIAL FROM STRATUM I, 2, OR 3.

The last-named category included all objects of some par- ticular interest, excluding pottery and chipped stone, but including worked bone and worked shell. A description of the unworked bone, fishbone, and shell, is, however, excluded from the account which follows, since these categories and the cereal grain found are dealt with in Appendixes VII to X. All the finds described below are now in the Paros Museum or its reserves, where pottery and obsidian are preserved in containers labelled with the number of the square and excavated level. Small finds were allocated serial numbers, and well-worked obsidian was similarly listed on a separate inventory. The original inventories and card indexes, together with the bone identification registers and the site notebooks, will be deposited in the library of the British School of Archaeology at Athens. Further details of the conventions used to mark the finds are to be found on p. 145. THE POTTERY Conditions at Saliagos were not favourable to the preservation of whole pots. In fact, the only vases to be found complete, or reasonably complete, were a few simple cups (e.g. fig. 35. 1-9 and fig. 36. 8), though ultimately it proved possible to restore either wholly or in part over sixty vases. Almost all the pottery, therefore, was found in the form of sherds, which were often very much comminuted. Approximately three and a half tons (3,500 kg.) of potsherds were unearthed during the course of the work. All of these were sorted and recorded,1 though the material from three squares dug in the 1965 season, R3, S4, and Qi, was selected as a sample for more intensive study. The total weight of this material was about four-fifths of a ton (812 kg.). All the feature sherds in this sample were sorted according to the traits they displayed and the numbers of each trait were recorded level by level. The traits selected for recording covered the range of shapes (as indicated by the fragments of rims and bases), lugs and handles, decoration, and certain rim forms. The aim of this work was to present in quantitative terms as full a picture as possible of the ceramic equipment of the Saliagos people, but it was also hoped that in this way some evidence might emerge of changes occurring during the life of the site. The frequency of occurrence of traits was measured in two main ways: first of all by relating them to the weight of pottery found in each stratum, and secondly, where possible, by ex- pressing them also as a percentage of a group of related traits. A standard unit of 100 kg. of pottery was used in assessing the frequency by the first method, but the actual weight found in each stratum is given in the histogram (fig. 15). The correlation between the figures arrived at by each of these methods was found to be in general very good. The fabric of the Saliagos pottery is extremely uniform. The paste is stone-gritted and in- cludes a fair amount of mica. There is a more or less continuous range in the size of the grits, 1 The cleaning and sorting of this formidable mass of material was undertaken by Mrs. Evelyn Evans.</page><page sequence="69">THE FINDS 35 but even in the finest wares they are quite obvious to the eye. There is often a différence in colour between the core and the parts near the inner and outer surface, though quite frequently an even firing has been achieved right through. In general the material can be divided into coarse household pottery and finer table wares, but the division was not always very clear and Wt.(kg) 400 300 ^^^^^^^B 200 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H 100 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H Ä Ä stratum 1 2 Ä 3 Ä Fig. 15. Histogram showing the weight of pottery (in kilograms) from each of the three strata in squares r3, s4, and q.i no absolutely reliable criterion could be found for settling doubtful cases. The shapes are com- mon to both and the paste is continuously variable. Perhaps the most significant feature is the surface treatment. Fine wares are usually burnished, often quite highly, while the surface of the coarse wares is generally only smoothed or at most given a light 'scribble-burnish'. Thin- walled vases whose paste is comparatively fine are, however, sometimes unburnished and were evidently meant for ordinary household use, while conversely examples of thick, coarse-gritted wares are also found which have a quite respectable burnish. In the squares which were sub- mitted to detailed analysis fine sherds account for only one-eighth of the total weight of pottery, though, as might be expected, fine-ware rim fragments outnumber coarse ones, the proportion being roughly three to two (63 per cent to 37 per cent).</page><page sequence="70">36 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Saliagos pottery is chiefly dark-faced, though the colouring may range from full black through shades of grey and brown to buff and even yellow. Burnishing, as is well known, deepens and darkens the surface colouring, so that while black or dark-grey or sometimes brown or red-brown is the normal colour of the burnished wares, the unburnished ones are usually light-grey, or sometimes buff or yellow. Special varieties of the normal ware, due mainly to differences in firing, perhaps deliberate, occur from time to time. One of these varieties in par- ticular is very distinctive, having a bright orange surface and a light-grey core. Small quantities of this type of sherd were found at all levels in the deposit. Apart from its colouring, it seems to be identical with the normal Saliagos fabric, and the shapes, where identifiable, seem also to be identical. Another less immediately striking variety is fired to a uniform pink right through, and is rather brittle. Again the different appearance is probably due chiefly to a difference in firing. This ware also was found at all levels. The shapes of the vases are on the whole simple, with a great preponderance of open over closed forms. In the counted squares 92 per cent of the rims belonged to open bowls or chalices and only about 8 per cent to closed shapes. These figures need some adjustment to arrive at the true proportions, since it is obvious that the mouths of jars would be smaller than those of bowls and so would tend to produce a lesser number of sherds per vessel. Even giving full weight to this, however, it is evident that jars and closed forms accounted for only a very minute pro- portion of the total pottery output. A number of different shapes could be recognized in both open and closed forms, but the line of distinction between one and another was not always clear; while the majority of examples tended to cluster around certain norms, variability between related shapes was in fact continuous, so that a fair number of relatively arbitrary decisions had to be taken in sorting. Rims were generally simple (figs. 40 ; 48 ; 49) ; the chief elaboration was the provision, in some coarse wares, of a raised platform on the exterior just below the rim for the impressed decoration which was often applied (figs. 39. 6; 40. 15, 16; 42. 9 and plate xxvi, a). One of the most striking features of the Saliagos pottery is the elaborate decoration which it often carries, and which may be painted, applied, or impressed. With very few exceptions (most of which are clearly imports) the painted patterns are in white. Bands of red incrustation, however, also occur in addition, often running over the white patterns, and there are very rare examples of red pigment used alone for the decoration of local fabrics. The white-painted decoration is characterized by a richness and variety of patterns which is unusual among the white-painted wares of the Aegean and West Anatolia. Painted decoration is found chiefly on fine wares, but it is sometimes, though not very commonly, applied to coarse vases. Conversely, the impressed and applied decoration is almost entirely confined to the coarse wares, exceptions to this rule being very rare. The few examples of incision are distributed among both coarse and fine wares : pointillé ribbons on the fine wares, plain incisions only on coarse wares. Despite the appearance of great uniformity in the pottery in use in the settlement throughout its entire duration, it has, as already mentioned, been possible to discern some differences in the ceramic content of the different strata. Marked fluctuations were observed in the popularity of certain features, though there is hardly any trait which cannot be found occurring in all levels. In what follows, the characteristics of the pottery will first be described in detail, after which the evidence for changes in the popularity of features from stratum to stratum will be set out. SHAPES As already mentioned, over 90 per cent of the rim sherds found belonged to open vessels, but it is noteworthy that closed shapes occurred much more frequently in coarse than in fine ware.</page><page sequence="71">THE FINDS 37 For the open shapes the proportion of fine to coarse is 65 per cent to 35 per cent whereas for the closed forms this proportion is almost exactly reversed, so that we have only 36 per cent of fine-ware fragments to 64 per cent coarse. All pots which did not stand on a high foot seem to have had flat bases. The open shapes can be divided into rounded, straight-sided, everted rim, flaring, and cari- nated bowls, though, as already indicated, one form tended to pass over almost insensibly into the next, so that the dividing line cannot be clear-cut. The straight-sided and flaring categories were by far the commonest, accounting for 75 per cent to 90 per cent of the total in all strata. Rounded bowls were also present in appreciable numbers, though they were much less common than either of the first two categories. The percentage of rim fragments of this type present increased steadily from Stratum 1 to Stratum 3. Everted-rim and carinated bowls were both very rare at all times. The commoner shapes were represented in a wide range of sizes. Bowls Rounded bowls (figs. 32. 1; 35. 1, 3-6, 9, 10, 13, 16, 18; 36. 12-14; 40. 1-4; 48; 57. 19). As already mentioned, the number of these, though never very large in comparison with the straight-sided or flaring bowls, was never negligible and rose steadily from 8 per cent of the total of bowl-rims in Stratum 1 to 19 per cent of the total in Stratum 3. (See Table 9.) Straight-sided bowls (figs. 35. 2, 7, 21; 40. 5, 6; 47. 1; 49. 1, 3, 7-10; 50. 1, 4-7, 9-12; 55. 22). This was one of the best represented categories throughout. The figures show a slight increase in the later strata, but this does not seem very significant. (See Table 9.) Everted-rim bowls (figs. 50. 13, 15-17). Examples of this shape are rare throughout all strata, and the proportion of fragments present is steady. (See Table 9.) Flaring-rim bowls (figs. 31 ; 32. 4; 35. 11, 12, 19; 38. 2; 40. 3; 42. 1-3; 51 ; 52. 1-4). This elegant shape is very characteristic of the site, and is, with the straight-sided bowl, the commonest form. However, the figures do show that it was declining steadily in popularity in Strata 2 and 3. (See Table 9.) Carinated bowls (figs. 35. 15, 17; 52. 5-8). These are extremely rare. No example was recorded from Stratum 1 in the counted squares, and only two each from Strata 2 and 3. The equally great rarity of body-sherds which show a carination demonstrates that the slight incidence of rim sherds with this feature is not mis- leading. (See Table 9.) Jars The closed shapes are all jars of one sort or another. They can be divided into hole-mouth jars (fig. 40. 13, 14, 17, 18), constricted-neck jars (figs. 40. 10-12, 15, 16, 19; 53. 5), conical- neck jars (fig. 39. 6), cylindrical-neck jars (fig. 53. 4, 6, 8) and funnel-neck jars (fig. 53. 7). Of these the only types that occur in any appreciable quantities are the hole-mouth and constricted-neck varieties. Between them these two shapes account for over 98 per cent of the jar fragments found in each stratum. However, the figures show that while in Strata 1 and 3 there are about twice as many fragments of constricted-neck jars as of hole-mouth ones, in Stratum 2 the numbers are about equal (Table 10). Cylindrical- and funnel-neck shapes never exceed 2 per cent of the total jar rims, while the conical-neck jar did not occur at all in the squares counted, though there were rare examples from other parts of the site.</page><page sequence="72">38 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Bases As mentioned above, bowls and jars seem normally to have had flat bases. There is no evi- dence at all for rounded bases, and ring-bases are extremely rare (Table 1 1). On the other hand, a very considerable proportion of the bowls must have stood on high pedestals. The overall proportion of bases to rim fragments is ι to 3-5, and there is relatively little variation in this proportion from stratum to stratum. The establishment of this proportion permits us to obtain a very rough estimate of the proportion of the total number of bowls which stood on pedestals. Calculating the proportion of bowl-rims which should have belonged to pedestalled vessels, taking into account the number of pedestal fragments found, we arrive at a figure of 39 per cent of the total. So about two-fifths of all bowls were probably pedestalled. When the value is calculated for the various strata separately, however, there is appreciable variation, from 31 per cent, or a little under a third, in Stratum 3 to 47 per cent, nearly a half, in Stratum 2. Stratum 1 falls midway between these two extremes with a figure of 37 per cent, very near the average. Before leaving the question of shapes entirely, certain exceptional forms must be mentioned. There are a number of examples of spoons or ladles, mostly small. These are often represented by the triangular handles alone, (fig. 59. 9-12). Another very special form is the little three- or four-lobed stand, sometimes with a little conical pedestal, whose use is very problematical, though it may have been intended to support a small pot. There are four examples of this form (fig. 36. 1-3) ; some other rather similar vessels may have been lamps (fig. 36. 4-6). There is one example of a roughly made conical vase with a large number of perforations in the sides; this is evidently a portion of a vase of the well-known type known as a 'cheese-strainer'. Handles There is a considerable variety of types of handle present, the most common being varieties of string-hole lugs and lug-handles. In the counted squares these greatly outnumbered all others, accounting for 63 per cent of the total number of handles of all kinds. There was a considerable discrepancy between the numbers of handles of coarse ware and those of fine ware. Taking all types of handles together, 76 per cent were of coarse ware, as against 24 per cent of fine ware, just over three to one. For lugs and lug-handles alone the proportion of fine-ware examples was slightly higher, 26 per cent - while for other types it was markedly lower, 20 per cent only. String-hole lugs and lug-handles (figs. 37. 2; 44; 45. 1, 2, 7, 9, 10; 46. 1-4; 53. 5, 8; 57 and plates xxix and xxx). Lugs ranged from tiny pellet-handles to the large tubular lug-handles of large storage jars. Many of the string-hole lugs were also tubular in form, but another type which occurred fairly frequently was triangular in section (figs. 44. 4; 53. 8). This type seems to have been used on necked jars. String-hole lugs could be either vertically or horizontally pierced. It was sometimes difficult to be sure which way up the lug was intended to be on small sherds, but the proportions of each were probably more or less equal. On the other hand, very few lug-handles were set vertically - only about 1 per cent in the counted squares! The horizontal ones were mostly simple in form, though a small proportion of them displayed waisting or 'saddle' effect (fig. 44. 10-13 and plate xxx, 0, bottom left). Some of the small string-hole varieties also display waisting, approximating in form to the 'trumpet' lug (fig. 57. 14, 15, 18). There were a few</page><page sequence="73">THE FINDS 39 examples (nine to be precise) of small unperforated lugs in the counted sample, but only one example of a larger unperforated lug. A number of unperforated lugs of various sizes were found in other parts of the excavations, but this type was certainly not common. Two examples of ordinary lug-handles had knobs (apparently decorative) at each of the four corners (fig. 45. 9, 10). Strap handles (figs. 45. 3-55; 57. 19; 58. 1 and plate xxx, a, middle row and bottom right, and b bottom right). These were the next most common types after ordinary lugs, though the total number from the counted squares came to only just under a quarter of the total number of ordinary lugs. Occasionally two or more pellets are set at or near the top of these handles (fig. 45. 4 and plate xxx, 0, end of middle and bottom rows) . In the counted sample only two examples were found with this feature, both in Stratum 1, but examples from late contexts come from other parts of the site. A small proportion of the examples of strap handles display the 'saddle' effect (plate xxx, b, bottom right) . It is not possible to say precisely what types of vessel the strap handles were attached to, since they were not found attached to sufficiently large pieces of pot. Ledge lugs (fig. 46. 6-17 and plates xxx, a, top row, b, top row right, and xxxi, 0, bottom right). Less common than the strap handles, but still reasonably well represented, are ledge-lugs. Normally they are semicircular, triangular, or trapezoidal in shape, but there is also a horned variety which occurs rarely (3 examples out of a total of 34 ledge lugs in the sample). Ledge lugs are quite often perforated (13 out of the total of 34). Crescentic lugs (figs. 47; 58. 2 and plate xxxi, b). The crescentic lugs are really a special variety of ledge lug and they may also be perforated or unperforated; occasionally also they are double-perforated. The examples found in the test areas were all unperforated, however. Crescentic lugs seem to have served as handles exclusively for the coarse household wares, and some of them are extremely large (fig. 47. 1, 11). The numbers of these lugs found on other parts of the site suggest that they are perhaps rather under- represented in the test area. Tab handles (fig. 58. 3-10 and plate xxxi, a). Tab handles occur in various forms, corresponding to those of the ledge lugs. They may be semicircular, triangular, trapezoidal, or, occasionally, horned. The triangular ones may some- times have occurred in pairs. They, like the last two types, may be either perforated or un- perforated. Specialized handles The types of handle discussed above occur fairly steadily throughout the deposit and there- fore throughout the life of the settlement. But there is also a series of related varieties of handles which are of relatively rare occurrence, and which seem to be chiefly characteristic of the latest phases. These have been classified as nose-bridge (figs. 44. 4; 58. 18 and plate xxxii. 9), horned (figs. 57. 9 558. 1 9 and plate xxxii, 5), pillar (fig. 58. 16, 17, 20 and plate xxxn, 3, 4) and rudder handles (fig. 58. 21, 24 and plate xxxii, 6). Of these the first is the only type which occurs at all in the lower levels of the test area. There is one example from Stratum 1, two from Stratum 2 (both from fairly high up in the deposit), and three from Stratum 3. Stratum 3 also produced one</page><page sequence="74">40 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS horned, one pillar, and four rudder handles. These are very small numbers, but the pattern of occurrence is interesting, especially as an examination of the pottery found in the rest of the site does not reveal any of these specialized types in an early context. One pillar handle was indeed found in a Stratum 2 context in the test area, a particularly fine example (fig. 58. 15 and plate xxxii, 5), but it does not seriously damage the case, because it comes from the very top level of that stratum. There is also a remarkable strap handle from a Stratum 1 context (Pit A), from the upper part of which projects a conical prong (fig. 45. 8 and plate xxxii, 8), but it is not really closely related in form to any of the special types of handle just dealt with, although it is the expression of a similar idea. On balance, therefore, the horned, pillar, and rudder handles may perhaps be provisionally thought of as types belonging to the later part of the occupation of the Saliagos site. It is noteworthy that the pillar handles are all of fine ware, though they have sometimes been so badly weathered that the surface has been completely destroyed. Unfortu- nately, we have at present no clue to the kind of vase to which they were attached. The even more remarkable rudder-handles seem to occur in both fine and coarse ware. Spouts A number of tubular spouts were found (fig. 59. 13-19). Two (fig. 59. 13 and 16) are fitted with a small, horizontally perforated lug beneath, at the point where they join the wall of the pot. In one case (fig. 59. 13) there is enough of the vessel left to show that it was a bowl. There is also one small spout with a painted decoration consisting of simple bands (fig. 59. 18). Leg A well-modelled leg and foot (fig. 59. 22) was evidently part of a pot which was probably anthropomorphic. A small portion of the body of the pot is present, which serves to differentiate this from other fragments of legs found, which may have been parts of clay figurines. DECORATION As already mentioned, the chief kinds of decoration used on the Saliagos pottery are painted decoration, proper to the fine wares, but also used sometimes on coarse vessels, and impressed or applied decoration ; or a mixture of both, which is almost entirely confined to the coarse wares. Painted decoration (figs. 31 ; 32; 41 ; 48-55; 56. 1-7 and plates xx-xxiv, xvii). One of the chief hallmarks of the Saliagos pottery is the frequent presence of patterns executed in matt white paint. The painting seems to have been normally carried out after the burnishing of the pot. This can be demonstrated in many instances where the paint has partially or entirely disappeared, leaving the burnished surface below intact, but different in colour from the rest of the surface of the pot, so that the outline of the vanished decoration shows up clearly. This colour difference may be due to the different firing conditions of the surface below the paint, but the paint itself has frequently had an effect on the surface below it also, partially or wholly destroying the 'mechanical slip' produced by the burnishing process. Where this has happened the pattern is also clearly visible, defined by the limits of the damage to the surface of the pot. In the highest levels of the deposit most of the sherds have lost their surface entirely through weathering in the soil, so that the incidence of painted sherds cannot be known, but this con- dition affects only about the first 20 cm. of deposit acutely. Below this level badly worn sherds are indeed found sporadically (they occur in all levels), and painting is also sometimes difficult to recognize because of heavy incrustation of the surface of a sherd. Relatively, however, these</page><page sequence="75">THE FINDS 41 factors do not affect many sherds, and it is possible to regard their effects as random and con- sider that the counts for each level are roughly representative of relative frequency. This is an important point, because a very marked falling off in numbers of white-painted wares was observed in the test areas from Stratum 2 onwards, as can be seen in the following table : TABLE 7. WHITE-PAINTED SHERDS Stratum 3 Stratum 2 Stratum 1 No. of occurrences 100 547 ^257 Freq. per 100 kg. of pot 47 198 389 Now, while it can be argued that because of weathering in the topmost levels of Stratum 3, the figure for that stratum may be much too low, the same argument cannot reasonably be used to explain the very striking descrepancy between the figures for Stratum 1 and Stratum 2. Moreover, while white-painted sherds are twice as frequent in Stratum 1 as in Stratum 2, they are no less than four times as frequent in Stratum 2 as in Stratum 3. We could, therefore, at least double the figures for Stratum 3 to allow for loss due to weathering without impairing the picture of a steady decline in popularity of painted decoration throughout the life of the site. The painted patterns themselves are characterized by a fairly wide selection of simple ele- ments which are very freely combined in a great variety of different ways. The elements from which the painted patterns are made up may be rectilinear or curvilinear, and solid as well as linear motives are used. Rectilinear elements include straight lines or bands, zigzags, either single or multiple, triangles, squares, rectangles, and lozenges (plates xx, xxi); the basic curvilinear ones are swags and wavy lines, which, like the straight lines, may be either single or multiple (plates xxii, xxiii, a). A tight wavy line is popular for hatching (e.g. figs. 50. 8; 52. io, 11), though straight-line hatching also occurs (e.g. fig. 56. 1). The syntax of the Saliagos decoration is more difficult to reconstruct from the sherds, which are generally small. The mended pots which have painted decoration give valuable aid here, but the range of the combinations is evidently so great that many more complete painted vessels would be required to provide a complete conspectus. The patterns range from simple com- binations of bundles of straight lines or bands (plates xviii, a, left; b, left, and xx) to the most elaborate combinations of a number of different motives. Rectilinear and curvilinear motives are combined quite freely on the same vase. The most frequently used patterns are ladders, zig- zags, rows of triangles, lozenges, squares, etc., either horizontal, diagonal, or vertical, swags, concentric arcs, and parallel wavy lines. A combination of two opposed wavy lines with a single straight vertical produces the distinctive 'caduceus' pattern (fig. 31. 4 and plate xvii, b) which is of regular, though not common, occurrence. A similar though less striking variant which occurs consists of the wavy lines alone, without the straight central one (plate xxiii, 0, centre). Relatively rare is the chequer-board pattern (fig. 55. 7, 8). Chalice feet are often divided into panels by vertical and horizontal lines, some of which are filled with decoration, while others are left blank (figs. 54. 14; 56. 4, 7). Painted decoration is frequently present on the inner lips of bowls, usually bowls of the flaring type ; it generally takes the form of a series of double swags at set intervals (figs. 33. 1 ; 49. 2, 5, 6; 52. 4), though more elaborate decorations are also occasionally found (figs. 36. 7; 50. 6; 51. 7 and plate xxii, a). It is extremely difficult to estimate the proportion of vases on which curvilinear patterns appear. For while only about one-tenth of the white-painted sherds from the test areas had any</page><page sequence="76">42 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS curved lines, it is clear from the larger sherds and from the restored pots that the curvilinear nature of a design may be appreciable only when a fairly large area of the painted surface is available for inspection (e.g. fig. 31. 3). Nevertheless, it is safe to say that curved lines, in- cluding the curvilinear hatching of otherwise rectilinear patterns, appear only on a very small minority of painted vases, though the effect of these patterns is so striking as to make them seem the most characteristic feature of the Saliagos painted wares. Only 1 per cent to 2 per cent of the painted sherds from the test areas are coarse ware. It is possible that this somewhat under-represents the actual frequency of painted coarse pots, but certainly they were not very common. The style of painting employed is very different from that used for the fine wares. Generally the patterns are composed of simple combinations of broad, streaky bands of paint laid directly on the unburnished surface (fig. 41 and plate xxvii). Occasionally coarse wares were decorated with concentric circles (fig. 39. 1 and plate xxvii, 0, top left; b, left), and also occasionally painted decoration was combined with impressed or incised decoration (fig. 41. 7 and plate xxvii, &lt;z, bottom left). In a number of instances the white-painted decoration is combined with red crusting. This always takes the form of a broad red band around the rim of a bowl, or (in one instance only), the bottom of a chalice-foot (fig. 52. ι ι and plate xxiii, b, top left). The red band usually covers part of the white decoration, but is transparent, so that the white patterns show through as pale pink. These bands of red incrustation occur only on small and medium-sized bowls of fine ware. Since the fugitive colouring round the tip would scarcely increase their utility, it is perhaps possible to think of these vessels as ceremonial, perhaps even of the application of the red bands during a ceremony of some kind. In two instances red crusted triangles formed the sole decoration on sherds of smallish vessels (fig. 55. 4 and plate xxiii, b, bottom left), while there are three examples of real red paint having been used to decorate a pot which is obviously made of the local dark-faced fabric. One rather unusual sherd of a grey fabric, part of an open bowl, has a broad vertical stripe in orange (fig. 56. 19 and plate xxiii, b, bottom centre). Apart from the red-painted sherds just discussed there are just over a dozen sherds with a light fabric with patterns in red, brown, or purplish paint, which are almost certainly imports (fig. 56. 20, 21 and plate xxiv, b). Their closest analogies seem to be with the matt-painted wares of the mainland Late Neolithic (see below, p. 82 , for discussion) . A few other light-coloured sherds are present which bear no traces of painted decoration, but which nevertheless are closely akin in fabric to the painted ones and must evidently be classed with them. These sherds were found sporadically right through the deposit, and because of their special interest as probable imports a complete list is given at the end of this section. Plastic decoration (figs. 42, 43 and plates xxvi, xxvii, a). This type of decoration was, as already stated, used practically exclusively on coarse wares (it was found on rather under 2 per cent of the fine wares in the test areas). Impressed and plastic decoration was normally concentrated on and just below the rim, though it occasionally appeared also on other parts of the vase. The subjoined table shows the frequency of its occurrence in the various strata in the test areas. TABLE 8. IMPRESSED AND PLASTIC DECORATION Stratum 3 Stratum 2 Stratum 1 No. of occurrences 58 109 101 Freq. per 100 kg. of pot 27 40 32</page><page sequence="77">THE FINDS 43 These frequencies show no sustained trend, but instead a moderate rise in Stratum 2, followed by a fairly sharp falling off to below the original level in Stratum 3. Here, of course, there is no question of the decoration being effaced in the upper levels; even on very worn sherds it is still quite plain. The patterns are made up of a number of simple basic elements which may occur in a variety of different combinations. The simplest of these elements is scalloping or slashing of the rim of the vase; the slashing may be either at 90o to the line of the rim or diagonal (fig. 42. 10, 11). Scalloping and slashing may be the only decorative element, or may be combined with a variety of other types. Finger impressions are also a very common element, and these may be either on the rim itself, in place of slashing (fig. 42. 8, 9), or just below it (fig. 42. 13), or even on the outer edge of the rim, a sort of half-way position between the other two (fig. 42. 4). Up to three rows of imprints may occur below the rim, and they may be combined with other impressions on, or on the edge of, the rim (fig. 42. 8, 9 and plate xxvi). Where two or three rows of impressions occur they are sometimes carried on a raised platform or an applied strip below the rim (e.g. fig. 42. 9 and plate xxvi, a). Applied decoration most commonly occurs in the form of one or sometimes two rows of blobs set just below the rim, and taking the place of the finger impressions (plate xxvii, a, top right). Occasionally these rough blobs were replaced by pastilles (fig. 42. 3 and plate xxvii, λ, bottom right), or even by discs of a special form, rather button-like, with a slightly concave upper surface. These normally occurred, like the blobs, just below the rim, but are occasionally set directly on an everted rim (fig. 42. 1, 2 and plate xxviii, a, top left). These rows of 'buttons' sometimes call to mind rather strikingly the rows of suckers on the tentacles of the octopus, which itself is so common a sight in the village of Antiparos. Plastic decoration occurred only rarely on the body of the vase. There are, however, several examples of non-rim sherds with single applied blobs, discs, or ovals (fig. 43. 11, 13, 14) and there are five examples of fragments of rough, thick- walled vases which apparently had applied blobs set thickly all over the surface (fig. 43. 15 and plate xxviii, b, bottom right). A very few sherds show fragments of applied cordons, generally themselves decorated with slashing or finger impressions (fig. 43. 12). A small group of sherds which has a more elaborate type of plastic decoration is of consider- able interest. On these sherds applied knobs are combined with curved strips of clay, semi- circular in section, and usually tapering at the ends, which form graceful volutes (fig. 43. 3-8 and plate xxviii, b). There are only about a dozen of these fragments in all; they come from all levels in the deposit and all seem to have been parts of coarse vessels. OTHER DECORATION Incised decoration This was extremely rare on the Saliagos pottery; when it occurs the decoration was always made before the firing of the vase. Simple incision was almost unrepresented except on one sherd of a coarse bowl, which has been decorated with a rough repeat pattern of concentric lozenges (fig. 36. 10). Very simple incised lines also occur on three other sherds from the test areas, two of which, one fine and one coarse sherd, are from Stratum 2, while the third, a coarse sherd, is from Stratum 1 . Incision was equally rare on the rest of the site. Incised patterns formed of bands filled with dots (pointillé) and originally incrusted with white paste, are found on a number of sherds (plate xxv). Owing to their rarity these sherds were at first thought of as being probably imports from neighbouring islands, but the finding in 1965 in</page><page sequence="78">44 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Pit A of a large portion of a chalice or fruit-stand of typically Saliagos form and ware which bears a curvilinear decoration in the pointillé technique (plate xxv, b) seems to prove that vessels with this kind of decoration were made at Saliagos, although only rarely. In the test areas only two fragments of pointillé-decorated wares were found in Stratum ι ; there were nine in Stratum 2 and none in Stratum 3. The Stratum 1 pieces were both found in the same level of the same square, while the Stratum 2 fragments all came from adjacent levels in the same square (Qi, levels 6 and 7). Leaving aside the fragments of the chalice from Pit A, less than a dozen other sherds with this type of decoration were found on the other parts of the site investigated. Pattern burnish The use of burnish as a decorative feature is very rare at Saliagos. The few examples found display a considerable variety, however (fig. 56. 14-18. and plate xxiv, a, middle, right, and bottom row) . Perhaps most interesting are the two sherds on which it is combined with the use of white paint, the paint being used in thin lines to define the edges of broad bands of burnish (fig. 56. 17, 18 and plate xxiv, 0, middle row, right). In one case it is combined in a different way with white paint, to produce a chevron pattern in two different registers (fig. 56. 16 and plate xxiv, 0, bottom row, middle). Otherwise it is used alone (fig. 56. 15 and plate xxiv, a, bottom row, right and left). LIST OF FRAGMENTS OF DARK-ON-LIGHT PAINTED WARES I964 Two sherds of jar of yellow ware with dark grits.

THE CHIPPED-STONE INDUSTRY The Saliagos chipped-stone industry is unique in the Aegean. By the large proportion of carefully worked artefacts and the variety of the types, it is removed both from the blade in- dustry of the Early Bronze Age and from the seemingly rather rudimentary lithic traditions of the Greek Neolithic as seen at Dimini, Sesklo, Lerna, and Knossos. The most striking type at Saliagos is the tanged point, probably used as an arrowhead or leister. There are in addition other forms also produced by flat flaking, as well as many artefacts with a considerable degree of invasive retouch. The industry differs so markedly from that of the Early Bronze Age that it is possible to distinguish the two on the sole basis of their waste products of manufacture. Prehistoric sites in the Aegean are usually dated, in the first instance, by a surface collection, which of necessity consists chiefly of waste products so far as the lithic industry is concerned. For this reason a study has also been made of the waste industry at Saliagos, both from the surface finds, and from stratified deposits. MATERIAL The principal raw material used for the industry was obsidian, of which 1,176 well- worked pieces were recovered as against 45 of other volcanic stones, 9 of quartz, and 56 of various kinds of flint. The proportion of obsidian in the waste material was yet higher than among the worked pieces. The few worked pieces of acid igneous rock found do not show the glassy conchoidal fracture of obsidian. One (fig. 68. 10; plate xxxviii, 4) is a broad flake of large size, reminiscent of some Middle Palaeolithic flake tools. It is red in colour, and the stone is derived from the nearby island of Fira (Appendix II). The other illustrated example (fig. 71. 1) is again broad and without much secondary working : it is dark grey in colour. A very rough point of category Β IV was made of similar stone. The quartz artefacts were all somewhat irregular.</page><page sequence="81">THE FINDS 47 TABLE 12.

Most striking was a handsome dark red (or chocolate) flint or chert, certainly not local to Antiparos. Two examples both of category D III are illustrated (fig. 67. 9 and 11). Perhaps of greater significance was the occurrence, predominantly in Phase 1, of a fine honey-coloured flint, of which there were five examples. The contexts were as follows : Category Β II, Square Oi L16, Stratum 1. Category Ε I, Square S4 Lu, Stratum 1 (fig. 61. 6; plate xxxviii, 2 and 9). Category J III, Square S3 L10A, Stratum 1 (fig. 64. 7; plate xxxviii, 8 and 12). Category J III, Square VI Li, Stratum 1, 2, or 3. There was a single example of a very distinctive mottled flint of purple colour with greenish spots (fig. 66. 8; plate xxxv, 5). Some very white pieces (e.g. fig. 67. 10), and others of a greenish tinge, may not in fact be true flint, but an opalized silicate, probably of igneous origin. There were also several pieces of rather ordinary brown flint. All are of interest, however, since flint is apparently not native to Antiparos. The source of the obsidian used at Saliagos is discussed in Appendix IV. Essentially it is of Melian origin, with the typical pearly lustre seen in most of the obsidian from that island. Other pieces are found with the transparent striations also seen in Melos. Small lumps of Antiparos obsidian are found on the site, but only one artefact of the substance was recognized (fig. 68. 4).</page><page sequence="82">48 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS The presence at Saliagos, albeit in small quantities, of obsidian from Giali, is of great interest. But no well- worked artefact has been found, and it seems to be of no importance to the industry. The total lithic industry is thus composed of at least 95 per cent of Melian obsidian, and the remainder chiefly of flint. The existence in Melos of a site of the Saliagos culture (see p. 75) is of interest in this connection. TABLE 13.

Since most of the material was found in the form of waste flakes and blades, there can be no doubt that the obsidian was actually worked on the site. But, although obsidian is extremely abundant, the small size of the cores found (fig. 18) would indicate that it was not used waste- fully. Doubtless it was imported in the form of large cores. One such (fig. ι η. 2 1), found in square K3 L10B, was still partially covered with the original skin, or cortex. The two magnificent cores illustrated in fig. 60 are quite exceptional. They are the largest cores of Melian obsidian ever found outside Melos. They were discovered by Mr. N. Zapheiropoulos on the surface at Saliagos and are illustrated through his kindness. Core A weighs 1,345 gm., and core Β 1,085 gm· B°tri are seemingly blade cores, and they cannot be regarded as typical of the site. However, they certainly testify to the efficient trading contact with Melos enjoyed by the people of Saliagos.</page><page sequence="83">THE FINDS 49 TABLE 14.

It was therefore decided to classify and count all chipped-stone fragments found at Saliagos, whether waste or with secondary working. In selected squares the classes of waste were weighed as well as counted. The very laborious task of cleaning and sorting over 25,000 fragments of obsidian was undertaken by Miss Barbara Bender and Miss Stephanie Page. Artefacts with secondary working (both 'well-worked' and "slightly worked') were recorded on separate cards. It has been possible to illustrate only a proportion of the drawings made. The complete records will be deposited in the British School of Archaeology at Athens, and may be studied there. In the first instance the industry has been divided into two groups : waste, and artefacts with secondary working. In the latter category fall all those artefacts showing any signs of deliberate working after their detachment from the parent core, together with cores adapted for use as tools. The former category includes cores and rejuvenation flakes as well as large quantities of blades and flakes. It includes, too, any tools whose shape needed no further adaptation after detachment from the core. There is no objective criterion for distinguishing these from waste material. C 4316 Ε</page><page sequence="84">50 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Artefacts with secondary working have been termed 'well worked' if they show systematic working (defined as flat-flaking over at least half of one face, or retouch along at least one-sixth of the perimeter, or some other striking feature, such as a notch). 'Slightly worked' artefacts - those which, while showing some retouch, fall outside the above definition - are often very irregular, and could not be further classified. They are listed by phase in the catalogue. For artefacts with some fairly extensive secondary working a classificatory system has been devised which does not depend on the subjective recognition of types. Artefacts are classed by two criteria: class of working (whether flat-flaking, invasive retouch, etc.), and form. It is not difficult to be objective about the class of working. A distinction is made between flat-flaking, invasive retouch, and simple retouch. 'Flat-flaking' designates the secondary working of the artefact leaving shallow flat scars running along the surface of the artefact, which con- tinue some considerable way from the edge so that much of the surface is thus scarred (e.g. fig. 61. i; fig. 63; plate xxxv). 'Invasive retouch' (including 'steep retouch') describes working where flake detachment scars run regularly and consistently some way in from the edge, without, however, covering a notable proportion of the surface (e.g. fig. 64. 1, 2, and 4; fig. 70). 'Simple retouch' (including 'blunting retouch') refers to simple trimming along the edges which does not have an invasive character (e.g. fig. 67. 12; fig. 71. 10). The columns of the categorical table (fig. 16) are as follows: I. Artefacts worked with systematic flat-flaking over all or most of both surfaces. II. Artefacts worked with systematic flat-flaking over all or most of one surface. III. Artefacts with systematic steep or invasive retouch along one or more edges. IV. Artefacts with systematic simple retouch along one or more edges. The classification of form is a more difficult problem. The first principle has been to avoid terms which would imply a specific use, which today must be uncertain. Thus forms Β and C are termed 'points' rather than arrowheads, form Ε are 'slugs' rather than fabricators. The concept underlying the arrangement in the first instance is that of symmetry. The ovates of form A have three kinds of symmetry : lateral (end-for-end), as well as longitudinal symmetry and symmetry of section. The points of form Β and C have symmetry of section and longitudinal symmetry. Class D (points), Ε (slugs), and J (parallel-sided blades with thin section) have only longitudinal symmetry, since they are not similarly worked on both faces. The remaining classes apart from the discs of form O, have no symmetrical properties. These symmetrical properties are sufficient to set apart the ovates and points. For the unsymmetrical artefacts, the number of worked edges is an important criterion. The following form designations were adopted. It should be noted that they are descriptive rather than strictly typological. Any artefact of whatever shape can be included, provided it shows some systematic working. A. Ovates. Possessed of end-to-end symmetry as well as longitudinal symmetry and symmetry of section. They are thus of approximately oval shape. B. Points with barbs and tang. The term 'point' includes all those artefacts, other than ovals, with longitudinal symmetry and symmetry of section. They are all narrow, and taper to one end. A tang may be recognized by a pronounced constriction at the end opposite the apex. A barb is an acute prominence above the tang (acute implying an angle of less than 90o) . C. Points with tang but not barbs. D. Points with neither tang nor barbs.</page><page sequence="85">----Jtetouch |Flat,2 faceslFlat.1 face I Invasivel Simple Form ^^^_ | || ||| |V Β Point, tanged, barbed ΨΨ ®w*w ψ Ψ C Point, tanged if ψ Ψ Ψ If if Ε Slug | J ^J| Ρ 2 worked edges, |Α ff| Ρ ' less than 4 cm.

This classification is summarized in tabular form in fig. 16. It should be noted that not all the classes implied by the correlations of form and classes of working actually have members. Naturally the existence or non-existence of types becomes clearer with the use of such a classi- fication. But categories in the table do not themselves constitute types. The existence of types is discussed below. THE WASTE INDUSTRY The first operation at the site of Saliagos, before the beginning of digging, was the collection in certain areas of all the visible surface obsidian. Four 10-metre squares were chosen for this purpose - C9, G2, H2, H3 - on the surface grid established (fig. 2). These squares were chosen for their abundance of surface obsidian. In each of them the soil had been so eroded as to form only a very thin covering above the rock. The obsidian and other chipped stone was collected within them by 1 -metre squares, and a plot of density of finds (Table 12 for Square H3) gives a clear impression of the fairly uniform distribution and high density of obsidian in those areas where it had not been washed away by the action of the sea. The waste material from all the excavated squares was collected and counted, layer by layer. That from Squares K4 and N3 was selected for special study. All the soil from Square N3 was sifted through a sieve of o#8 cm. mesh. It is clear, however, from the figures in Table 13 that the only striking outcome of this sieving procedure was a higher proportion in the smaller waste flakes recovered. The result of these counts is summarized in Table 13. Naturally for the stratified squares a layer- by-layer count was made (cf. Table 1 on p. 12 for Square S4) but space does not allow the presentation of the results in such detail here. The waste material was first divided into the three broad categories of cores (fig. 17. 19-21), flakes (fig. 17. 15 and 16), and blades (fig. 17. 3 and 4) (length greater than twice the breadth). Parallel-sided blades were distinguished (fig. 17. 1 and 2), as were flakes showing blade scars (fig. 17. 7 and 8). Very thickly keeled blades were counted separately (fig. 17. 5 and 6) as were</page><page sequence="87">Γ 3 ^ 4 5 ^ 6 7 8 ^^ 9 ίο " 12 &lt;=3 13 C7 14 Ο κ &lt;C=3 16 c:=b17 Ö18 21 Fig. 17.

Typical examples of these different forms are seen in fig. ι y. Among the results, listed in Table 13, the flakes are divided into four categories by size. The smallest, below sieve size, was collected only in squares H2, H3, and Co.. The categories were weighed as well as counted. The number of well-worked pieces is also given. 15 25 35 45 Length mm. Fig. 18. Histogram showing the length of the obsidian cores recovered (from Squares Cg, G2, H2, H3, K4, and N3). Total: 78 It would seem that the waste collections from the surface squares, from the stratified squares, and from Vouni compare together rather well. The low proportion of large flakes at Vouni and the high proportion of fragmentary blades there and in the Saliagos surface squares is probably to be explained by breakage and damage through erosion, which was not suffered by obsidian in the stratified deposits. In terms of quantities recovered the Square N3, where the soil was sieved, is the most im- portant. The effect of the sieving seems to have been rather to increase the total quantities found than to alter the proportions in a very significant manner. It should be remembered that Squares N3 and K4 are, as dug, 4-metre squares, while the others are of side 10 metres. It is clear, however, from Table 1 2 that the action of the sea has removed at least 50 per cent of the obsidian which is likely once to have been in these surface squares. The total weight of obsidian in the 1 o-metre area may once have been in excess of 4 kg. Although it would be hazardous to make statements about the original soil-cover of these eroded squares on this basis, some con- siderable depth of soil, certainly (one would guess) over a metre, must have been present originally to harbour so much obsidian. A consideration of the level-by-level figures for Square S4 on the other hand (Table 1 on p. 12), where there was no striking concentration in the</page><page sequence="89">THE FINDS 55 topsoil, suggests that there, and perhaps over much of the site, erosion has not played so decisive a role. The cores were not in general of large size (fig. ι 8), and indeed most of those recovered had been completely worked out. Nor were large flakes numerous in the waste industry - few were longer than 4 to 5 cm. The category of parallel-sided blades is of particular interest in view of its possible chronological significance. Few were complete, but of those unbroken examples pre- served the average length was less than 4 cm. It is easier to be precise about the widths, and histograms for the width of worked (fig. 19, b) and unworked (fig. 19, a) parallel-sided blades are given below. 8 I ~i ■ α ■HIHI[HIIHIh_jh_ bL_ ■■HHHHIHHl·. 5 10 15 20 5 10 15 20 Width mm.

Widths of parallel-sided blades: (a) without secondary working (from Squares Cg, G2, H2, H3), total 123; (b) WITH SECONDARY WORKING (ALL SQUARES), TOTAL IO5 The whole unretouched blades were generally shorter than the parallel-sided ones, with an average length of about 2-5 cm. and a range from 1-5 to 4-5 cm. The mean length-breadth ratio was about 2-5 to 1. The whole flakes with blade scars were of about the same length, with a mean length-breadth ratio of just less than 2 to 1 . It seems clear therefore that the blades in the waste industry were not so much deliberate products as simply narrower waste flakes. A study of the waste industry thus confirms that of the finished artefacts in suggesting that the Saliagos obsidian assemblage is in no sense a blade industry. The great quantities of waste obsidian lying about the site at first give an impression of colos- sal profligacy on the part of the obsidian knappers. This impression is corrected, however, by the small size of the waste flakes and of the core rejuvenation flakes, rarely more than 3-5 cm. long. Despite one or two magnificent cores (fig. 60; plate xxxiv), the prevailing economy in the use of the material is emphasized by the very small size of the bulk of those discarded. A phase-by-phase study of the waste industry produced only one result which seems to be of significance. Parallel-sided blades were greatly more numerous in the third phase than in the preceding two periods. Taking all the phased deposits together, the parallel-sided blades form</page><page sequence="90">56 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS O-OO2 per cent of the total waste in Stratum i, 1-3 per cent in Stratum 2, and 2-9 per cent in Stratum 3. If only the well-stratified squares S4, Qi, and R3 are considered, the effect is yet more striking (cf. fig. 21, and table ι for S4). The effect here is enhanced by the high con- centration of parallel-sided blades in S4 itself. It is none the less a general one throughout the site, and is of considerable chronological significance. WELL-WORKED ARTEFACTS All the well-worked tools, including those from the surface squares, were classed on the system outlined above. A phase-by-phase synopsis of the complete industry is presented in Table 14, and a more detailed breakdown is given in the appropriate sections of the catalogue. It will be convenient to take the various categories in turn. AI to A IV. Ovates. Most of the artefacts of this form are in fact worked by flat flaking on one or both faces. This and the relative homogeneity in size and shape (fig. 20 a) suggest that cate- gories A I to A IV of ovates may in fact be taken as varieties of a single type. TABLE 15.

The sample of ovates from stratified and phased contexts is insufficiently large to allow of firm chronological conclusions. The type is already seen in Phase 1 (fig. 65. 5), but would seem to become more common in Phases 2 and 3. Although the ovates form a rather well-defined class, there are points in categories D I and D II which do approach them in shape. In general, however, the ovates are not narrower than 16 mm. in width. The length lies between 6 and 3 cm., with few exceptions. The length/ breadth ratio lies between 9:4 and 5:4 (fig. 20 a). The ovates form 4-8 per cent of the total well- worked obsidian. It is, however, the high quality of the workmanship which is so very striking, as an examination of figs. 61, 65, and plate xxxv makes clear. The function of these tools is not certain. If the points are to be interpreted as arrowheads, the ovates were probably spearheads. The larger ones could conceivably have been dagger blades. Points of Categories B, C, D I, and D IL The class of points has been divided somewhat arbitrarily into barbed and tanged (B), tanged (C), and tangless (D). At Saliagos none is hollow-based. These categories are certainly of some descriptive power, but the boundaries are not always clear. Thus fig. 86. 8 of Category CI is close to being barbed, while the tang on fig. 86. 10 of Category C I is scarcely perceptible. The dividing line between some of the points of Categories D I and D II (e.g. fig. 63. 9) and the ovates is not always very clear.</page><page sequence="91">Ί A * 70]B 60" 60- • · 50- · · ι ·· ' i i40 ::-&lt;■" · *« iK Β . ·: .· · g&gt; · V.· · &amp;S • · ·»· 20- 20- * · 0 10 20 30 0 10 20 30 Width mm.

It is apparent that for B, C, and D, the really neat pieces tend to be of Class I, with flat flaking on both surfaces, and that pieces of Classes II, III, and IV are sometimes simply hasty versions of them. The points of D III and D IV are not included in this discussion since, although falling within the definition of D, they are rather different in shape. Here is a case, then, where the classi- ficatory system proves useful for the recognition of type, without condemning all the objects of Form D to conform to a single type. In fact it seems reasonable to regard all of B, of C, and of D I and D II as variants of a single type. They are probably projectile points. Classes Dili and D IV must have had a different purpose.

While the ovates are rare in the early phases, the points are very well established in Phase 1, and actually decrease, as a proportion of the total worked industry, in Phases 2 and 3. Already in Phase 1 pieces of good workmanship are seen (fig. 62. 8; fig. 63. 2). Among the examples of Phase 1, the proportion of pieces of form Β (barbed) is high, suggesting that the barbed form was well established at the outset. The tendency to emphasize the tang in some cases in Phase 1 is seen in fig. 66. 2 and fig. 62. 8. The size of points of Class Β is seen in fig. 20 b, of Class C in fig. 20 g, and of Class D I and D II in fig. 20 D. They are fairy homogeneous, although two very striking long narrow points of Class C stand rather apart from the others (fig. 63. 1 and 3). The smaller points (e.g. fig. 63. 4 and 5) are often neat, and would make good tips for leisters or fishing spears as well as for arrows. The shape, even within the classificatory categories established, varies considerably. Among the finest and most regular examples those with a curved convex edge (e.g. fig. 62. 1 ; fig. 63. 7; fig. 65. 10; fig. 66. 8) may be contrasted with those showing a more markedly straight edge (figs. 62. 3, 7, and 8; 66. 11). This distinction, however, has no chronological significance. A further factor in terms of shape is the length /breadth ratio (cf. fig. 20). A number of arrowheads are distinctly squat and spade-like (fig. 66. 1 and 2) while the more slender occur principally in Phase 3 (fig. 62. 6 and 9; fig. 63. 6 and 8; fig. 66. 15). The slenderest of the points from Phase 1 is fig. 62. 2. Once again the excellence of the workmanship is in some cases truly remarkable (e.g. fig. 62. 1 and 7; fig. 63. 1; plate xxxv, 3-5). In some instances the regularity of the edge- working gives a nice saw-edge effect (fig. 66. 3; plate xxxvii, 20). A selection of the points from Saliagos is illustrated in figs. 62, 63, 65-67 and correlated by phase, and with the plates, in Notes to the Figures.</page><page sequence="93">THE FINDS 59 Categories Dili and D IV. Points. The remaining points are not to be considered projectiles. Often the noses are very blunt, and the shape is now triangular, showing a flat base rather than narrowing. Generally both edges are worked, and in D III the working is usually steep. There are two recognizable principal types in Category D III. The first has a trapezoidal section (fig. 67. 8) produced by removing a blade before the point was struck from the parent core. The second has a steeper triangular section (fig. 67. 7) generally only with a single work- ing edge. Category D IV is the counterpart of D III, but with simple retouch. The artefacts are usually thinner in section (or steep retouch would have been employed) and some are not far removed from parallel-sided blades (fig. 67. 12 and 13). Noteworthy in Category D IV are two beautiful tools of red flint (fig. 67. 9 and 11) and one of white flint (fig. 67. 10). The category increases slightly in frequency in Phases 2 and 3. Category E. Slugs. This distinctive category comprises only 7 members. The most striking and important are those of Ε II, all of which would have exceeded 7 cm. in length when unbroken. The entire upper surface is carefully worked, forming a nose at both ends (fig. 61.8; fig. 67. 14). The two examples of this shape of Category Ε II, with working also on the bulbar surface, are less than 4 cm. in length (fig. 61. 6 and 7). The former is of honey-coloured flint. Categories G III and I III. Flakes I blades, of length greater than 4 cm.; with steep retouch on two edges or one. The most striking aspect of the industry at Saliagos, after the beautifully worked flat-flaked ovates and points, is the high proportion of pieces with careful steep or invasive retouch. The classification places the various artefacts by categories according to working, shape, and size. The forms F, G, H, and I include, in fact, all those flakes and blades which lack other distinctive features, and therefore include a great variety of shapes. One group of pieces stood out, how- ever, among them, for both the exceptionally large size and the neatness of the edge working. All these pieces fall naturally into categories G III and I III, which contain a range of impres- sive tools possessing one or two sawing edges (see figs. 68 to 71). TABLE 17.

Both categories are more strongly represented in Stratum 3, however. The prominent saw edges are well seen in fig. 64. 2 and fig. 70. 9. Two well- worked pieces of igneous rock (fig. 68. 10; fig. 71. 1 ) are included in these categories. Categories G II, G IV, I II, I IV are much less clearly tools of importance. The examples with flat-flaking are very poor. Typical examples of the others are illustrated (fig. 69. 5 and 6; fig. 71.3 and 4) as is an exceptionally long blade, of length 9-5 cm. (fig. 71. 2).</page><page sequence="94">6o EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS CategoriesFandH. Flakes /blades, of length less than 4 cm. These categories include few pieces that are flat flaked. Only fig. 67. 16, of category F I, is a sophisticated object, with careful working on both faces, and a fine chisel edge, produced by a transverse blow. It is flat and thin. There is no other piece remotely like it at Saliagos, although a single parallel in white flint was found on the surface at Kephala in Kea, and a similar piece in obsidian was found on the slopes of the Athenian Acropolis by Mr. and Mrs. Timothy Mitford. The other tool types are not unlike the larger ones of Categories G and I. A distinction is possible between those of flat section (e.g. fig. 68. 2) and those with a keeled triangular section (fig. 68. 3). The percentages on Table 14 show the remarkable situation that while the pieces with working on two edges (F) are most common in Phase 1, those with one worked edge (H) are more common in Phases 2 and 3. This effect is seen, although less strikingly, among the larger pieces, Categories G and I. Category J. Worked parallel-sided blades. Blades (defined as of length greater than twice their breadth) are not common at Saliagos, forming less than 10 per cent of the waste industry. In any case they are to be regarded as no more than narrow flakes. Unworked parallel-sided blades form less than 1 per cent of the waste industry. Worked parallel-sided blades likewise are not strongly represented, forming 8*2 per cent of the well-worked assemblage (and hence about 0-4 per cent of the total assemblage). TABLE l8.

The effect is less striking for the worked blades, where they are less common in Phase 2 than in Phase 1 . The increase in Phase 3 is again a marked one, however. The length of the complete blades varies from 2*5 to 5*5 cm., with a mean value of 3-9 cm. Their widths are seen in fig. 19. The blades are usually worked along the entire length, often along both edges, and both steep and invasive retouch are seen, as well as the more common simple retouch. Categories Κ to Ρ Κ.

These are worked-out core-fragments and core rejuvenation flakes, generally circular and fairly flat, which show some signs of working on both sides. Thus they cannot be regarded as mere waste products. In fact there are several very neatly shaped examples (e.g. fig. 64. 3), and they must be taken to constitute a type. Doubtless they served as scrapers. They are pro- portionally most numerous in Phase 1. P. Fragments. These are pieces of undeniably well-worked artefacts. Generally flat-flaked, they cannot be classed more precisely. STRATIGRAPHIG CONSIDERATIONS The density of waste obsidian and of well-worked artefacts was so great over much of the island that it did not prove easy to recognize any specific localities which might have been used consistently for the actual working of obsidian. The surface concentrations in Squares G2, H2, H3, and C9 were the result, probably, of erosion upon some depth of soil and the consequent exposure of its included obsidian, rather than the result of localized human activity. None the less, it appears possible to make certain generalizations. Inside the main building complex the total waste obsidian per 4-metre square rarely amounted to more than 200 pieces. In squares outside this area, such as K4, N3, Qi, S4 (but not R), the waste might amount to between 1,000 and 2,000 pieces. In Squares Yi and Y3, at the north end of the island the concentration was also high, of the order of 600 to 700 pieces. The same generalization is true for well-worked obsidian. Table 13 gives the figures for several squares. 126 worked pieces were found in Square S4, 100 in Qi, and about 50 in Square Υ ι as against only about 10 in each of the squares within the central complex. It may, then, be possible to generalize and say that usually obsidian was worked outside the principal settlement area. This suggestion would be supported by a consideration of the de- posits inside and outside Room Ε in Square S4 (Table 1 ) . It may be supposed that the inhabi- tants of Saliagos, like those of Antiparos today, went with bare feet. Not surprisingly they may have preferred to leave the sharp chips and splinters of obsidian outside the houses. The stratigraphical table for Square S4 (Table 1) illustrates for a single square what is true of the site as a whole. The obsidian industry seems to have increased in quantity in Phase 3. Certainly the proportion of well-worked obsidian to waste increases during the occupation of the site (fig. 21 a). The industry is very homogeneous through the three phases of the site (Table 14) and does not undergo any radical or striking change. None the less certain trends can be distinguished. The proportion of unworked parallel-sided blades to the total waste increases significantly (fig. 21. b). The proportion of worked parallel-sided blades to the total well-worked obsidian like- wise rises in Phase 3. O vates are more numerous in the later phases. On the other hand the proportion of points (Categories B, C, D I, and D II) is highest in Phase 1 and decreases later. The effect is yet more marked if the barbed and tanged points (B) are considered alone. Discs (Category O) also decrease in relative frequency. It would seem</page><page sequence="96">62 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS therefore that barbed and tanged points were among the tool types favoured by the original settlers at Saliagos. In later phases less care was excercised upon the barbs, and the point became less important, while the ovate and the parallel-sided blade increased in significance. χΐθ-i 2 5- ^^^^H - MM 12 3 12 3 Well worked Parallel sided blades Fig. 2i.

(Squares R3, S4, and Qi only) These variations are minor in themselves, and some of them may be due simply to chance in the sampling (for instance, the very high concentration of parallel-sided blades in Layers 4 and 5 of Square S4) . None the less, taken together, they show that changes in the industry occurred during the occupation of the site, which must therefore have been of some length. The same inference arises from the quantitative stratigraphical study of the pottery. The possible implications of these changes, and the affinities of the Saliagos obsidian industry, are discussed in later sections. SMALL FINDS I. ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURINES AND AMULETS (FIGS. 75~8; PLATES XLII-XLV). An impressive range of figurines was found during the excavations at Saliagos. Although no type is represented by more than two examples, the variety of forms and the occurrence of types already known elsewhere give the series a considerable importance, in view of its Neo- lithic context. The most beautiful perhaps is the representation in marble of a fat woman, seated with crossed legs (fig. 75 ; plate xlii) . The marble is white and medium-grained, with a grain size up to about 1 mm. The appearance is rather rough, the effect of weathering. The head and right</page><page sequence="97">THE FINDS 63 shoulder are missing, and there has also been damage to the upper portion through weathering. The preserved height is 5-8 cm. The form corresponds in posture and in some details to a chance-find from Sangri in the island of Naxos (Weinberg 1951). The reconstruction of the missing parts would present no difficulty. The elbows are at the sides, with the forearms placed over the waist so as to allow the fingertips to meet at the middle of the body. The left arm only is preserved, and is clearly modelled at the front, with an incision at the back of the body to demarcate it from the shoulder. Below the arm at the front is a thick roll of fat. At the back two further incised lines are just visible before the weathering obscures them: they probably indi- cate rolls of fat at the base of the back. The upper parts, however, are almost slender in com- parison with the portentous buttocks, which protrude heavily at the back, while at the front the plump legs are crossed, right over left. This impression is contrived by modelling the right leg clearly, perhaps with some narrowing to indicate the foot. The left leg is not separately indi- cated by any detail. The buttocks are divided at the back by a deep incision which runs also right across the base of the figurine. At right angles to this incision on the base are two incised lines marking the distinction between thigh and buttock. The figurine was found at no great depth in Square Q3 Li. The weathered condition may be accounted for by its proximity to the surface, but it could equally be due to exposure during the life of the site. In this case the figurine might date from Phase 1 or 2 rather than Phase 3. Despite the much-damaged condition, the sense of bulging volume and the insistence on curving surfaces make this a very pleasing little work of sculpture. Such a find, of recognizably 'Neolithic' type, was less surprising than the discovery of a Violin figurine' of typically Early Bronze Age form (fig. 76. 1 ; plate xliii, i). Such schematic figurines are a prominent feature of the Grotta-Pelos culture, and it is important that their life can now be carried back to earlier periods in this region. The figurine is of fine grained white marble, blackened on one side by burning. It is 6-6 cm. in height. The find was made among hearth debris of Cliff Section 20, attributed to Phase 2 or the later part of Phase 1 . There is no modelling, and the figurine is thin and flat - a typical 'Brettidol' - although none the less plumper than some of the Early Bronze Age examples. The outline narrows at the waist, proceeds to arm-stumps, and then tapers markedly to indicate the neck and head. An unusual feature is the incised slit at the front, just below the top of the tapering prominence. This clearly shows the face or head (which is not distinguished by any widening of this prominence), marking the recession in the profile below either the nose or the chin. The reverse side is plain. The deliberate and austere simplicity is as pleasing in this figuration as the plump realism of the fat lady. The narrow neck of another figurine of this form was also found, in Square L4 L4, a deposit of Stratum 1, 2, or 3 (fig. 76. 2; plate xliii, 2). It is simply a narrow cylinder of white fine- grained marble, 5 cm. in length, tapering lightly at the tip. It may be recognized as a figurine by the incised slit near the top. The complete figurine would have been much larger than the previous example, and the neck and head much more rod-like and slender. The fourth figurine of marble, a surface-find from Square Y2, is again schematic in form, resembling in outline the example from Cliff Section 20 (fig. 76. 3; plate xlv, 2). It is larger (Length, ΐο·6 cm.) and much heavier and thicker (Thickness, 2-5 cm.). In its lower portions it resembles somewhat the waisted weights from the site (fig. 87; plate li). The asymmetrical shape and the resemblance to other schematic figurines make its classification as a figurine a reasonable one. A torso of baked clay was found above the circular structure in Square T2, in Level 6. It is broken at the neck and waist - the preserved height is 6*2 cm. - but the arm-stumps are clear</page><page sequence="98">64 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS and little damaged (fig. 77.1 ; plate xlv, i). The surface is rough, not burnished, and the grit filler is rather coarse, up to 1 -5 mm., with mica and marble grains. The clay is dark grey through- out. There is some thickening at the small of the back, probably for a prominence at the but- tocks. It is not clear, however, whether the complete figurine would have been rather flat for its entire length, as is perhaps most likely, or rather fat below the waist. Three terracotta legs were found, and it is possible that they may have been the supports for pottery vessels. One, indeed, from Cliff Section 4 (plate xlv, 6) showed an attachment for such a vessel at the broken end, and is described with the pottery. The second, from Square K3 L15B, changes direction markedly at the knee, above which it is broken. The foot is well defined and almost rectangular, with prominences at both sides indicating the ankle. The biscuit is black, burnished to dark brown at the surface, and there are traces of red crusted paint (fig. 77. 3; plate xlv, 5). The third leg is plump and round in section, a simple heavy cylinder (fig. 77.2; plate xlv, 4). It is from Cliff Section 2. The base is flat, with a prominence at the front to indicate the foot, while the shape suggests that this was the right foot. The knee is not indicated, and it is possible that the entire upper part of the leg is missing above the break. But probably there was never any distinction of the knee, so that the fragment represents almost the entire leg. The biscuit is dark red-brown, burnished to medium brown, with visible mica grains. There is a trace of red crusted paint at the foot. Pendants. The principal small find of the 1964 season was a schematic anthropomorphic pen- dant in beautifully polished bone (probably a bovid rib). Half the head is missing. The height is 4-4 cm. The head, arms, and legs are outlined simply by straightforward cuts from the flat bone surface, and the head was pierced (from both sides) to make a hole for suspension (fig. 78. 1 ; plate XLiv, 3). The figurine presents essentially the same appearance back and front. It is from Square Yi L25. A pendant of outline similar to the last was found in 1965 in a deposit in Square S3 L6, close to the violin figurine described above. Both were among the debris of a hearth of Phase 2 or the latter part of Phase 1. It is 4 cm. in length. The material is a soft red homogeneous stone of very fine grain, looking not unlike well-fired red clay. A thin flat piece of stone has been carved to outline legs, arm-stumps, and a head, which has two horn-like prominences probably representing ears. It has been pierced at the head and waist (fig. 78. 2; plate xliv, i). There are incised lines crossing diagonally at the waist at front and back, and an incision on the right leg at both front and back. This incision is difficult to explain, unless it was intended in some way to indicate a crossed leg. The horizontal incisions at the waist, however, may be compared with those on some marble figurines of the Early Bronze Age, where they seem to indicate folds of flesh. A very attractive pendant bead of translucent green stone, probably tremolite, was found in 1964, and may well have been intended to represent the human figure. Found in Square N3 1-4, it is 3-0 cm. in length. It is pierced at one end for suspension (from both sides), and incised rather irregularly right around the middle at a position which could indicate the waist. At the other end it divides in a manner perhaps indicating legs, which are further emphasized by incision. Significantly perhaps, these incisions meet a short incised horizontal line, forming what might, by comparison with marble figurines of the Early Bronze Age, be interpreted as a pubic triangle (fig. 78. 3; plate xliv, 2). The very attractive green stone takes on a browner tone towards the legs, and it is difficult to envisage so attractive a pendant as having a useful purpose. Perhaps, however, it was designed as a weaving needle.</page><page sequence="99">THE FINDS 65 Figurines are found in both Phases 2 and 3. Their absence in Phase 1 is probably fortuitous, and all the figurine types represented at Saliagos must be regarded as broadly contemporary. There is certainly insufficient evidence on the site for the construction of any kind of typo- logical evolution. 2. BEADS AND ADORNMENTS (FIG. 78; PLATE XLVl) Few items of personal adornment were found at Saliagos. Two anthropomorphic amulets of stone and bone are discussed with the figurines, as is a small pendant bead which may also be anthropomorphic. A variety of materials was employed, including bone, fishbone, shell, and various stones. The vertebra of a shark or ray was pierced to form a bead (fig. 78. 5; plate xlvi, 2). A bracelet was carved from the shell Spondylus gaederopus (fig. 78. 6; plate xlvi, i), and there were two orna- ments of Patella, as well as other shells, adapted for wear, which are described in the section on Worked Shell. Apart from a small ring of chlorite schist (fig. 78.7 ; plate xlvi, 3), green in colour, the stone adornments were in the form of beads. One, of green stone, was cylindrical in shape, and pierced along the axis (fig. 78. 4 ; plate xlvi, 7) . There was a tiny quoit-shaped bead of grey-black stone (fig. 78. 8; plate xlvi, 5) and a smoothed pierced pebble of black marble (fig. 78. 9; plate xlvi, 6) . The group is completed by a bead or button of red serpentine with what might be described as a V-perforation. The finds were insufficiently numerous to allow of any phase-by- phase comparison of their frequency. 3. STONE BOWLS (FIG. 22; PLATE XLV, 3) Only two fragments of carefully worked stone vessels were found during the course of the excavation. Both are of marble, and regrettably incomplete. Fig. 22. Marble bowl fragments. Left, no. 351 from Square VI L8; right, no. 394 from Square S4.C L7 One is a ring base, of diameter 3-5 cm., possibly the foot of an open bowl of circular shape. The ring stands ο·8 cm. from the level and is slightly hollowed on the inside. The marble is white, medium-grained (to 1 mm.) with a yellowish patina. It may well be of local origin (fig. 22. I ; PLATE XLV, 3). The second is a rim fragment of an open bowl or cup, of diameter about 20 cm. It is of greyish- white marble of medium-grain (fig. 22. 2). 4. AXES (FIG. 79; PLATE XLVIl) The stone axes from Saliagos are all rather small in size, all less than 6 cm. in length. Most are made of iron-rich emery ores, and a few are from related stones of schistose structure. It is C 4316 F</page><page sequence="100">66 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS of great interest that analyses by Dr. Martin Oosterom (Appendix II) have shown that these stones are not native to Antiparos, but derive from Paros or, more probably, Naxos. Nearly all of them are irregular in shape, even when unbroken, and in many cases a flattish pebble has simply been worked so as to give a cutting edge, with little other modification of form. Of 36 axes and fragments recovered, 32 are of the emery ores described, one of pyroxene, and at least one of serpentine. Many of the finds were from the surface, and only a small proportion was well stratified : 2 are from Stratum 1, 2 from Stratum 2, 1 from Stratum 1 or 2, and 4 from Stratum 3. They were clearly used throughout the life of the site. While most of the axes show some irregularity in shape, it is notable that the two completely preserved examples of unusual and softer stones (fig. 79. 14 and 15; plate xlvii, i) are more regular, and are polished all over the surface. It did not prove easy to divide the axes typologi- cally in a convincing manner. Four of the five examples stratified in Stratum 1 or 2 are parallel- sided and roughly rectangular in section (fig. 79. 1-3 and 5). The fifth (fig. 79. 4) is narrow and chisel-like. The axes stratified from Phase 3 include a very small and neat axe (fig. 79. 8) only 3-9 cm. in length, and another short example, with a splaying edge (fig. 79. 7). The unphased series includes examples which are very flat (e.g. fig. 79. 10). Of particular note are those made from irregular pieces of stone with only the slightest modification (fig. 79. 12 and 13; plate xlvii, 3 and 4). One unusually fat axe (fig. 79. 16) shows signs of having been reworked after breakage. With the exception of fig. 79. 4, there are no chisels, unless the smaller axes were used for this purpose. There are no adzes. 5. OTHER FINELY WORKED STONE (FIG. 88) Three very carefully worked pieces of stone with a flattish section were found. One is of white marble of medium grain (about ι mm.) with a carefully worked outer edge of circular form, 15 cm. in diameter. It is flat on both faces, and its use is not clear (fig. 88. 2). The others are of green stone, possibly chlorite schist, worked to give two almost parallel surfaces, with a rounded edge (fig. 88. 1 and 3). Both faces are well polished, as is the edge, but the purpose of these objects is not clear. Several small marble pebbles, all of which seem to have been shaped or polished with de- liberate intent, are illustrated (fig. 88. 4-6, plate xliii, 4 and 5). It is possible that they are of little more importance than polished pebbles, but objects of this kind have been found in cist graves of the Early Bronze Age, where they clearly served the same purpose as the more care- fully shaped figurines of marble. It would be a mistake to follow Bent, in this respect, who threw away several such objects (Bent, 1884, 49), which he had discovered in the cist graves of Anti- paros, before realizing their significance. Stone objects, less finely worked and with a practical function, are described below. 6. worked bone (figs. 8o and 81; plate xlviii) Bone tools formed only a limited part of the equipment of the inhabitants of Saliagos. Most of the bones when excavated were much encrusted by a concretion which could be removed only through soaking in acetic acid. It was during this treatment, and the study of the animal bones by Mr. Ian Clegg and Mr. Ian Kinnes, that most of the artefacts, which would otherwise have been overlooked, were in fact recognized. The identifications of species given below are</page><page sequence="101">THE FINDS 67 likewise due to Mr. Clegg and Mr. Kinnes. The results of their study of the bone refuse, inter- preted by Mr. E. S. Higgs, appear in Appendix VII. The total of 1 1 2 artefacts of bone collected during the course of the excavations is not a particularly large one. The limited range of types produced is a further sign that the working of bone was not a very important industry. In particular there were no pins or needles whatever, and the bone spatulae found in Neolithic Knossos (Evans, J. D., 1964, 236 and Fig. 55) and in the Cave of Za in Naxos were likewise absent. The commonest form is the bone point, with a conspicuously sharp end (fig. 81. 1-10). Some of these points taper markedly. Chisel-ended tools (or gouges), with a broader, bevilled, edge, are also common (fig. 80. 4-7) . The category 'narrowed tools' includes such artefacts as taper or narrow markedly without coming to a sharp point (fig. 80. 1-3). They have in general a narrow but somewhat blunt nose, and had surely a different purpose from that served by the points. There are five spatulae with very broad ends (fig. 80. 8-10). Perforated bones are classed separately. They are few, and being in most cases broken, they cannot be classed into types. The phase-by-phase comparison of the industry shows some variation in the relative fre- quency of types. It is notable that bone artefacts are most common in Stratum 1, while most other finds, including obsidian tools, were found in greater quantity in the levels of Stratum 3. TABLE 19.

With few exceptions they are long-bones, although the spatulae are from bovid ribs. A mandible was in one case used (fig. 81. 10) to produce a point. The commonest bones are metapodials * The distinction here between sheep and goat is a tentative one carried out in the field by Mr. Kinnes following the criteria of Boessneck, Müller, and Teichert (1964).</page><page sequence="102">68 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS (eg. fig. 80. 1; fig. 81. 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9) and tibias (e.g. fig. 80. 5 and 6; fig. 81. 12) of sheep and goats. Further details of the worked bone will be found listed in the catalogue for each phase. 7. WORKED SHELL (FIG. 82; PLATE XLIx) A great number of shells, worked principally to make spoons and scoops, was found at Saliagos. In many cases only a slight modification to the natural shape of the shell was required, and were it not for the systematic study of the shells, undertaken by Mr. N. J. Shackleton, principally to gain an insight into the Neolithic diet (Appendix IX), many of the worked pieces would have been overlooked. The identifications of species are also due to Mr. Shackleton. Patella coerulea, the limpet, was the species most commonly used for food. Not surprisingly in view of its concave shape it was frequently used as a spoon. In some cases the shell was smoothed with great care along the entire length of the circumference (plate xlix, i, 2). In a chosen stratigraphical sample eight such spoons were found in deposits of Stratum 1 and three in each of the second and third Strata, and they would thus seem to have been most commonly manu- factured and used during the first phase of occupation. A completely different type of working resulted in a notable length of straight edge at one side of the shell (plate xlix, 3), while the remainder of the circumference was unworn. This effect is probably the result of using the shell as a scraper. The other mollusc very commonly collected for food was the Top Shell, Monodonta turbinata. Its shell, however, was not worked. The use of the mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, for the manufacture of spoons is of great chronological interest. It was found almost exclusively in Stratum 1. The shell needed only a little grinding along the edge to produce a neat, flat lip to the spoon (fig. 82. 1-4; plate xlix, 15-18). No fewer than 18 examples were found in deposits of Stratum 1, with only 3 from Stratum 2 and 2 from Stratum 3. There was very little waste refuse of this shell, and most of that was restricted to Stratum 1. As observed in Appendix IX, it would seem that the shell was collected by the inhabitants of Saliagos exclusively for the manufacture of spoons : insufficient waste was found to indicate its use as a food of importance. While 12 of the spoons found in Stratum 1 were from two hollows in the natural soil, filled with rubbish, in Square S3, the others were distributed widely about the site, and the chronological conclusion seems so striking that it would be possible to use it to allocate to Stratum 1 or 2 the unphased deposits in Squares N3 and K4. The third form of shell artefact of frequent occurrence at Saliagos again has considerable chronological significance. It is oval in shape, rather flat, although always with some concave curvature, and distinctly cut to shape from a large univalve, generally Charonia sp., the triton or conch (fig. 82. 5-8; plate xlix, 10-13). The type is a prominent one in Stratum 3, from which 8 examples are known, while only 1 comes from Stratum 2, and none from Stratum 1. The restriction of finds to Stratum 3 could conceivably be connected with the similar concentration of mussel spoons in Stratum 1, for the 'cut to shape' would have made a suitable substitute for the spoon. There is, however, another possibility. The shape is identical with that of the pottery burnishers, made of cut and rounded potsherds, described below. They are common in Stratum 1, and notably less frequent later. These cut-to-shape shells may indeed have served the same purpose, as they are known to have done in later times in the Hebrides (Singer, Holmyard, and Hall, 1 95 1, 390). The chronological significance is brought out in the following table, (from which the limpets are omitted in view of the difficulty in deciding when a specimen has been worked) :</page><page sequence="103">THE FINDS 69 TABLE 20.

A gasteropod, Conus mediterraneus, from Stratum 3 has been pierced at the top and sawn through at the side in order to produce a hole directly in line with the first (fig. 82. 14; plate xlix, 7). Another, unphased, was similarly pierced at the top for suspension (fig. 82. 11; plate xlix, 9). Two very fragmentary cowrie shells, Cyprea physis, were found with signs of deliberate grind- ing at the end (plate xlix, 6 and 8). Although the remains are too fragmentary to allow us to be sure of the appearance of the finished product, it seems clear that the purpose of the grinding was to produce a hole for suspension. Probably any other method of piercing would have shattered the very fragile shell. The remainder of the worked shell falls less neatly into categories. An interesting fragment of a bracelet, carved from Spondylus gaederopus is described with the beads and adornments, above. Spondylus was also used in three cases to make shell scoops, not always very well fashioned. Other bivalves less commonly used for this purpose are : Venus verrucosa, Glycimeris pilosus, and Venerupis aurea. Two rather beautiful spatulae, one cut from Pinna nobilis (fig. 82. 9), the other from Charonia (fig. 82. 10) differ from the cut-to-shape ovals by their very flat surface. Three little cockle scrapers, formerly termed Cardium, but now classed as Cerastoderma edule were found. They had been smoothed along one edge. Two examples of the gasteropod Cymatium parthenopium, with signs of rubbing, perhaps from the working of leather, were recovered, and two prong-like fragments from the centre of the spiral of the same univalve. The latter, however, may not have been worked. Of doubtful purpose also are a burnt fragment oïCerithium vulgatum, and a broken piece of Ostrea stentina. 8. SHERD 'BURNISHERS' (FIG. 83; PLATE l) A large series of potsherds was found, carefully cut round, usually to form an oval shape, and smooth at the edges. The use of these objects is not clear, and the most likely explanation seems to be that they were used for the burnishing of pottery. Only three of this series of cut and smoothed sherds are not oval. One from Pit A, and thus belonging to Stratum 1 , is rectangular (fig. 83. 11). An example from Stratum 3 (fig. 83. 12; plate l, i) has two protuberances at the sides, not unlike stump-arms, and is broken at the top. It is surely significant that of the series of 37 examples, no fewer than 18 are from Stratum 1, with only 5 and 3 respectively stratified in Phases 2 and 3. Moreover of these 18, 6 are from Pit A, 5 from the pit in the SW. corner of Square S4, and 5 from Square S3. These are notable concentrations, and in a discussion of their use their predominance in waste pits of Stratum 1 must be taken into account. Among the examples attributable only to Phases 1, 2, or 3, five were found in Layers 2 and 4 of Square L2, again a notable concentration.</page><page sequence="104">70 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS The choice of potsherd to be carved again does not seem to be a random one. No fewer than three of the sherd 'burnishers' (two from Pit A and one from Square K3 L16B) are of the light fabric with dark painted decoration which is recognizably an import at Saliagos (plate lv, 4 and 5). Seven more are of the same imported white fabric, although without traces of paint, or of the orange-surfaced ware, grey in the biscuit, which is likewise extremely rare amongst the Saliagos pottery (e.g. fig. 83. 8; plate l, 3). The remarkably high proportion of imported wares among the sherd 'burnishers', seen in each phase, may perhaps be explained by their superior firing and hardness. 9. CLAY RODS (FIG. 84; PLATE l) Ten fragments of baked clay, in the form of long thin, rather irregular tapering cylinders, were found. They are distinct from the pillar-handles seen on some of the pots of Stratum 3, although some of the flatter of the rods do resemble closely the broken tips of the small vessels with flap-handles (compare the rods fig. 84. 15 and 18 with the flaps of fig. 36. 1-3 and fig. 59. 9-12). Three such flattened rods were found in Square Yi (fig. 84. 15, 18, 20). A notable concentration of three rods, one of them complete and 7-2 cm. in length, was found in the Stratum-2 deposit of Square Qi L8. Two of them taper markedly (fig. 84. 12 and 14; plate L, 18 and 19) while the third is more rounded at the end (fig. 84. 13; plate l, 14). A large, rather clumsy example from Square Vi, although damaged, is now 10-5 cm. long (fig. 84. 21; plate L, 13). There seems no good reason to suppose that the shape is intended as a phallus, and no satisfactory explanation is as yet forthcoming. 10. SPINDLE WHORLS (FIG. 84; PLATE Li) Spindle whorls were represented by a few examples in each phase. In general they are made from potsherds worked to a circular shape and pierced in the middle. In two cases (fig. 84. 3 and 5; plate li, 5) the piercing has been left incomplete. The outer diameter of the whorls lies between 4-0 and 5-5 cm. Two pierced discs of marble were also found (fig. 84. 4 and 8 ; plate li, 4) . Although of slightly smaller diameter they may have served the same purpose. It should be noted that none of the plumper biconical whorls, common in the Aegean Bronze Age, was found. 11. DISCS OF CLAY AND STONE (FIG. 85; PLATE Liv) Eleven discs of baked clay were found, and three of stone. They are notably smaller in size than the potlids described below. It is, however, possible that the two largest discs of clay, cut from potsherds and approximately 7 cm. in diameter, served that purpose. Six of the clay discs are cut from sherds, while five were deliberately formed in their present shape and fired. These are slightly concave, and may be described as dishes (fig. 85. 1-3, 5, 6; plate liv, 6). Such discs and dishes occur in all phases. They are all illustrated in fig. 85. 12. pot-lids (fig. 86; plate lui) Pot-lids, rather roughly worked discs of stone, were found in all three strata. They are almost exclusively of schist, which splits conveniently to give a flat piece of stone, and the shape is one that occurs naturally. Some of the series may indeed be natural products, but there is no doubt that many were used, perhaps as lids or as flat stands for pots. Included in this group is an example in pottery, cut from a large sherd (fig. 86. 7; plate lui, 2). Its large size, diameter 12</page><page sequence="105">THE FINDS 71 cm., sets it aside from the clay discs described above, which it otherwise resembles. A selection of pot-lids, including one of micaceous quartzite (fig. 86. 4) is seen in fig. 86. 13. WAISTED WEIGHTS (FIG. 87; PLATE Li) A series of rather flat pieces of stone, with deliberate indentations at each side, halfway down the length, stands out clearly among the heavier worked stone (fig. 87). In general the shape is an oval one, although one example from Phase 2 is rectangular (fig. 87. 1, plate li, 1 4). The materials used are schist and marble. The form is usually very flat, less than 2 cm. in thickness, but two of the examples from Stratum 3 are plumper (fig. 87. 2 and 4; plate li, 9 and 17). Four examples were found in Stratum 3, one in Stratum 2, and none in Stratum 1, while five were unphased. The scarcity in the lower levels could perhaps be significant. It is clear that in each case a natural pebble or stone has been adapted, presumably in order to fix a cord to it. Although the form is the same as that of waisted hammerstones, it seems more likely, in view of the absence of bruising, that they were used as weights. They would certainly have been suitable, for example, as weights for looms or fishing nets. 14. MORTARS, QUERNS, PESTLES, AND RUBBERS (FIGS. 89-92; PLATES LII, Liv) Five mortars were found, all of marble. Two are massive (fig. 90. 4 and 5; plate lii, 4) and the former may conceivably have been used as a door-socket. The other three are smaller, and indeed amount to very crude and unpolished stone bowls (fig. 90. 1-3; plate lii, 5-7). They would have made suitable receptacles for grinding, and may have been used in conjunction with the pestles described below. Several large stones, hollowed through use as querns, were found on the site. In view of their large size, not all of them were retained. One very large example, 60 cm. by 50 cm., was of marble. Others were of schist (fig. 89. 3) and at least one was of muscovite-biotite-gneiss (fig. 89. 1 ) . A third example illustrated could perhaps be a very heavy pot lid (fig. 89. 2 ; plate lii, 3) . There can be little doubt that these, together with some of the rubbers, were used for the grinding of grain. The use of muscovite-biotite-gneiss, an imported stone, suggests care in the choice of material. Seven pestles were found, narrow pieces of marble with signs of wear at the end (fig. 88. 9-13 ; plate LV, 1-3). They are probably natural water-rolled stones, adapted for use. In addition there is a further example made of red stone with a porphyritic appearance (fig. 88. 13). Several rubbers, notably two from phase 1 (fig. 92. 1 and 2; plate liv, 3) had also been used as hammerstones. They showed marks of wear and bruising in the middle of the flat sides. There were several stones which showed signs of being used as hammers, notably fig. 92. 6 and 8, both of quartz, fig. 92. 3, of muscovite-biotite-gneiss, and fig. 92. 5, of haematite-limonite. Several of the rubbers were of large size, and had clearly been used in conjunction with the querns (fig. 91, 1, 4, and 5; fig. 92. 7). They were usually of schist. Smaller examples included one of muscovite-biotite-gneiss (fig. 91. 2). 15. MAT-IMPRESSIONS (PLATE LV) In all six mat-impressions were found. Two, numbers 259 and 260 (plate lv, 10 and 11), were on the lower part of the bowl of high-pedestalled bowls, at the point where the pedestal had come away. Clearly the bowl was first placed on a mat to dry, before being set on its pedestal for firing.</page><page sequence="106">72 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS One impression, no. 247 (plate lv, 9), was on a piece of baked clay, the others were on the bases of pottery vessels. All were impressions of coiled matting. Dr. G. H. S. Bushneil, Curator of the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Cambridge, has kindly studied latex casts of the impressions, and written the following note : These are not very distinct, since the sherds themselves were evidently not well preserved. The measurements will give some idea of the fineness of the material, although it must be remembered that the width of the stitches is liable to vary in a single example. The main variations apart from this are in the way the sewing strip links the coils together, and the method may give some clue to the nature of the foundation. In the case of 259 and 260 the sewing strip appears to pierce the foundation of the previous coil, which would imply that it was soft, e.g. a bundle of grass (rather than a stick). The same may apply to 246, but I cannot be sure of this or of the remainder. Plate Serial No. Context Width of coils Stitches per cm. LV 6 246 Cliff 17, Pit A About 3-2 mm.

The frag- ments of 259 and 260 are so small that the width of the coils cannot be averaged over a number of them It may be observed that the mats on which were placed the two bowls, subsequently to be set on high pedestal bases, were of rather coarser stitching and perhaps softer than the others. Dr. Bushnell has pointed out that coiled matting is not unusual in the Mediterranean, several examples being found at the Early Neolithic site of Nea Nikomedeia together with examples of different technique. Mat-impressions are particularly common in the Cycladic Early Bronze Age. A large proportion of unbaked pots from Chalandhriani in Syros and else- where (Tsountas, 1898, pl. 9, 24) had been set to dry on mats before firing. A single impression of wattle in daub, from Square Oi L58, was recovered. 16. various A few finds were made which could not be classed in the above categories. Amongst these must be put the Roman lamp (fig. 23; plate xli, b) found inside the 'dolmen', in association Fig. 23. Roman lamp from the 'dolmen'</page><page sequence="107">THE FINDS 73 with a disturbed burial. It resembles in decoration numbers 129 and 130 in Miss Perlzweig's series from the Athenian Agora (Perlzweig, 1961), and should then date from the late first or second century a.D. It may thus give a closer date to the ribbed Roman sherds found in the 'dolmen' area for which Mr. John Hayes has suggested a range from the late second to the sixth century a.d. Of great interest is a piece of worked pumice from deposits of Phase 1 or 2 (fig. 88. 8; plate xlvii, 9). In shape it is not unlike an axe of rectangular section, but it must doubtless have been used as a rubber. Pieces of unworked pumice were found in all three strata, and it is likely that they derive from Santorin, of which the most famous eruption in the Late Minoan period was clearly by no means the first. The finds included also one small clay ball, which serves to underline the total absence of slingstones of clay. It is of course possible that round stones were used as slingstones, and many such were found. Only in one case, in Square Q3, were they sufficiently numerous to suggest that they had been deliberately amassed, and there is no good evidence for the use of the sling. Red ochre occurred in several deposits in very small quantities. It was doubtless collected and kept for use as a pigment.</page><page sequence="108">ν THE SALIAGOS CULTURE SITES OF THE SALIAGOS CULTURE The rich and characteristic nature of the obsidian industry of Saliagos makes possible the recog- nition of three other related sites in the Cyclades, known only from surface finds. At two of these there is little or no pottery, but at the third just sufficient potsherds have been found to confirm the relation of the lithic material with that from Saliagos. The distribution of these sites extends from the northern to the southern Cyclades, and seems sufficiently wide to justify our speaking of the Saliagos culture (fig. i). The finds from Mavrispilia in Mykonos have already been published, and likened to those of Saliagos itself (Belmont and Renfrew, 1964). The point is again the dominant type amongst the chipped stone, while such other Saliagos forms as the nose-ended flake of Class L (op. cit., pl. 125; fig. 4, 43 and 44) and the disc scraper of Form Ο (op. cit., Fig. 4, 30 and 33) support the equation. It is satisfactorily corroborated amongst the pottery, where there are thin-rimmed open bowls (op. cit., pl. 124; fig. 3, 5-9), high stand bases (fig. 3, 1-3), pierced lugs (fig. 3, 12-13), a hole-mouthed jar (fig. 3, 10), a pierced crescentic lug (fig. 3, 14) and a fragment of white ware in the Saliagos style (op. cit., 397; 111. 1). Only the bowl with horizon- tally pierced tubular lug (op. cit., pl. 124; fig. 3, 16) is not seen at Saliagos, and may perhaps indicate some later (Grotta-Pelos culture) activity at Mavrispilia. In Antiparos itself, the site of Vouni, discovered in 1964 by Mr. Ian Morrison, has given evidence of a closely similar chipped-stone industry, and clearly belongs to the Saliagos culture. The site is a high flat-topped hill on the west coast of Antiparos (cf. fig. ι ; plate lvi) dominating the western end of the fertile valley of Kambos, which cuts Antiparos from east to west. On its eastern side Vouni slopes steeply down to the valley, while on the west it falls abruptly to the sea in sheer cliffs some 40 metres in height. It overlooks the sandy bay of Leivadhi to the south-west, which although not very well sheltered would offer some protection from easterly and southerly winds. The location of the site is strikingly reminiscent of that of Mavrispilia in Mykonos. There is an excellent perennial freshwater spring about halfway down the hill to the sea. The chipped-stone industry may be compared with that of Saliagos on the basis of a surface collection made in 1964, and now housed in Paros with the Saliagos material. The waste industry is similar (Table 13 on p. 48). There are few parallel-sided blades. The proportion of simple blades is higher, however, and the size of the flakes is in general smaller. This last may be the result of weathering and of damage caused to the industry through exposure on the open hill at Vouni. The well-worked obsidian formed 4-9 per cent of the complete industry. A selection is illustrated in fig. 74 and in plate lvi, and the proportions by category are given in Table 2 1 . There was a single ovate of Category AI (fig. 74. 1) and several points of Categories Β and C (fig. 74. 2-5). Nose-ended tools, Form Κ (fig. 74. 13-14) and notch-sided tools of Form L (fig. 74. 15) are found. The absence of discs of Category Ο may not be significant. More striking is the absence of Categories G III, G IV, and I III, the larger edge-worked flakes. As noted</page><page sequence="109">THE SALIAGOS CULTURE 75 above, large flakes are fewatVouni, and it maybe that this marks a significant cultural difference rather than a mere disparity of preservation. In any case, the industry of Vouni shows many similarities with that of Saliagos, and it seems quite safe to relate them, even in the absence of ceramic finds from the site. TABLE 2 1.

There is, of course, no reason to suppose that Phylakopi itself was occupied at so early a date. It is planned that the surface-finds, again exclusively of obsidian, will be published as part of a study of the prehistoric sites of Melos. The industry is character- ized by points (Belmont and Renfrew, 1964, 399; 111. 3) and other familiar forms. Again, despite the absence of pottery, it may safely be ascribed to the Saliagos culture. THE CULTURAL ASSEMBLAGE In view of the uniformity of finds from all the known sites of the Saliagos culture, and the preponderant importance of those from the type-site itself, it will be sufficient here to give a brief summary of the Saliagos finds, which have already been listed at some length in this report. The houses were built on stone foundations, rectangular in plan, and at Saliagos enclosed by a perimeter wall. No burial of the Saliagos culture has yet been discovered, so that our knowledge of the cultural assemblage is derived entirely from occupation debris. The pottery was dark-faced, with the exception of a few imported sherds of pale fabric, which sometimes bear dark-painted decoration. Both coarse, unburnished ware and a finer, usually burnished, ware are found. The great majority of vessels were open bowls, of which about two- fifths were set on high pedestal bases. The remaining bowls had flat bases. Most of these bowls</page><page sequence="110">76 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS had straight-sided or flaring rims, while rounded, everted, and carinated profiles were less common. Closed shapes account for one-tenth of the total, and all were jars, principally hole-mouthed, or with constricted necks. The handles showed an interesting variety, lug handles predominat- ing. Also well represented were tab-handles, strap-handles, and ledge-lugs, while a variant of the latter, the crescentic lug, although less frequent, is a characteristic shape also found at Mavrispilia. The less frequent nose-bridge, horned, and rudder handles appear at Saliagos to be restricted to the later levels. A striking feature of the Saliagos pottery, and the most frequent decorative treatment, is the use of matt-white paint, applied on the dark burnished surface. The decoration is essentially a linear one, with a considerable range of motifs, both rectilinear and curvilinear, all of a geo- metric nature. This white-painted decoration, and the frequency of high pedestal bases, are perhaps the most notable features of the Saliagos pottery. In a few instances red-crusted paint was applied in a band round the rim. Incision, too, was occasionally used in the form of bands filled with pointillé dots. The few sherds of pale fabric with dark painted decoration are considered to be imports. Numerically more significant than these, however, were the vessels with some form of plastic decoration, whether as scalloping or slashing at the rim, finger impressions or applied blobs. None of these compares in importance with the white-painted decoration, which was most frequent in Stratum ι at Saliagos, declining markedly in the third stratum. The chipped-stone industry is predominantly of obsidian, and large quantities of waste are found. It was not a blade industry: parallel-sided blades form only a small part of the total at Saliagos, rising to 3 per cent in Stratum 3. The well-worked artefacts show a considerable variety. Numerically the most important form is the tanged point, generally worked by flat flaking on both surfaces. This is one of the most striking diagnostic forms of the Saliagos culture. Ovates form another important group exhibiting careful flat flaking, and there is a range of forms displaying invasive or simple retouch. Of the various other tools used, most are of stone, which in some cases was imported for the purpose. The axes are small and not very well worked. Bone tools are likewise not very im- pressive, either for their variety or their workmanship. The use made of shell is interesting, by contrast, and the mussel 'spoon' appears at Saliagos to be limited to the first Stratum, while the 'cut-to-shape' is predominant in the third. The sherd 'burnishers' form an interesting class, again limited principally to the first phase. The purpose of the clay rods (plate l, 10-19) has not been adequately explained. Waisted weights, spindle whorls, and clay discs were fairly common, and the usual complement of pot lids, mortars, querns, rubbers, and grinders was found. Two fragments of marble vessels were recovered, and a restricted variety of personal adorn- ments in stone and shell. Of considerable interest were the figurines. Both schematic and more naturalistic figurines of marble were found, a flat torso of clay, and two small, flat anthropo- morphic representations, which had been pierced, apparently for wearing. No metal objects came to light. The absence of such features, many common elsewhere in the Aegean, as animal figurines, stamp seals, fish-hooks, needles, shaft-hole axes and clay sling stones, as well as the restricted range of pottery shapes and decoration, is of note.</page><page sequence="111">THE SALIAGOS CULTURE 77 ENVIRONMENT AND LIFE The four known sites of the Saliagos culture are well situated, both for defensive purposes and for access to the sea. Mavrispilia and Vouni are both on the summit of steep hills over- looking broad bays, which is some weathers would make excellent anchorages. Saliagos was a promontory commanding the land bridge between Paros and Antiparos, situated in a large, northward-facing bay with the possibility of beaching ships both to east and to west. The existence of such ships is surely implied by the extent of the obsidian trade with Melos. Agrilia in Melos is likewise on the top of a hill, within easy reach of a suitable haven. Little is known yet of the climate of the Aegean in Neolithic times (Appendix VI). In the absence of pollen we are obliged to fall back on less sensitive climatic indicators. The presence of sheep at Neolithic Saliagos, in greater proportion than is seen today in Antiparos, might be taken to indicate rather better grazing. However, the lower relative sea level (Appendix I) implies more extensive lowlands, suitable for pasturage, so that a wetter climate need not be presupposed. On the contrary, the high proportion of barley to wheat (Appendix IX), a pre- ponderance persisting today, suggests rather a sunny and fairly dry climate not unlike that of the present. The soil samples (Appendix V, D) likewise suggest a dry climate. The islands in Neolithic times will none the less have presented a more fertile, less denuded aspect than that of today. Deforestation is thought to have proceeded rapidly in Classical times, and since then the grazing of the goat will further have reduced the vegetational cover and left the soil open to denudation. The elaborate system of Hellenistic vine trenches discovered on Paros and Antiparos during the 1964 season is a proof not only of the rise in relative sea level since that time, but of the erosion which has taken place on a large scale. Buildings of the culture have been recovered only at the type site. They had rectangular rooms with stone foundations, probably with stone walls and a light superstructure. Small dwellings and shelters of this kind are seen in the islands today. In Antiparos today the principal cereal product is barley, most of which is now sold to the national brewery. In the Cyclades in 1938, the ratio of barley production to wheat was 9 : 1 comparing well with the figure of 84 per cent of barley in Neolithic times (Appendix IX). There is literary evidence to suggest that this preponderance persisted in Classical and late medieval times. In Neolithic Saliagos, however, as elsewhere in Greece at the time, emmer and two-row barley were grown rather than the hexaploid wheat and six-row barley of more recent times. Querns and rubbers, used to produce flour from the grain, were found at the site, as were little shell spoons, perhaps used to scoop it up. No further plant-remains of significance were observed at Saliagos, but this may in part be due to the special conditions of preservation. The earliest grape pips yet recovered in Greece are of Early Bronze Age date (Mylonas, 1959, 39), but they are difficult to recognize and evidence may yet be forthcoming for earlier viticulture. Antiparos today, as in Hellenistic times, pro- duces both grapes and wine. Although the olive may prove to have been native to Greece, there have been no finds of olive stones earlier than the Late Bronze Age (Vickery, 1936, 58). A residue which on analysis apparently proved to be of olive-oil was found in an Early Cycladic vessel in Naxos (Stephanos, 1906, 88), and the important Cycladic product thus goes back at least to that time. There is as yet no documented proof that the olive was grown in the Neolithic period. Other vegetable foods such as beans, peas, lentils, millet, pistachio, almonds, figs, and acorns are all reported from Neolithic contexts in Greece (Renfrew, J. M., 1966). There is no</page><page sequence="112">78 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS sign of them at Saliagos, and it may be that with a diet already rich in protein, the inhabitants had no need of legumes. Mixed farming was clearly the basis of life, for there were abundant remains of sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs (Appendix VII). Caprini formed 83-5 per cent of the total. From the figures given in Appendix VII, the liveweight percentages may be calculated. TABLE 22. LIVEWEIGHT PERCENTAGES Modern Cycladic Species Animals % Liveweight Ib.

Today in the Antiparos island group there is an important herd of goats, but very few sheep. A preliminary examination in the field of the caprini bones by Mr. I. A. Kinnes, on the criteria of Boessneck, Müller, and Teichert (1964), suggested that over 90 per cent of the caprini were in fact sheep. A comparative study of the horn cores alone sets the figure at 50 per cent, and even by taking this more cautious value, the proportion of sheep is seen to be much smaller today in Antiparos than it was in Neolithic times. Sheep, of course, have the advantage of producing wool, while goats are better milk-producers. The high proportion of young animals found does not, however, suggest a wool-producing economy. There is no good evidence for hunting at Saliagos. No deer bones or antlers were found. Wild goats are still seen at Erimomilos and Gioura in the Cyclades and in Crete, but it is possible that these are a feral strain. In any case there is no good evidence of wild goat at Saliagos, and despite the large number of points found it must be concluded that game did not form a significant part of the diet. Large quantities of fishbones were found at Saliagos, and their scientific study has resulted in a remarkable and surprising insight into the diet of the prehistoric islanders. Nearly all the bones found were those of very large fish, although a more rapid deterioration in the bones of smaller fish, together with the practical difficulty in collecting them, could account in part for that. Ninety-seven per cent of all the fishbones identified were of tunny, often of very large size. The sieving in Pit A, Cliff 17, and Square N3 has allowed the comparison of animal bones, fishbones, and shell, and an approximate calculation of the meat weights involved. In Pit A, tunny represents 88 per cent of the total meat, in Square N3 28 per cent These are astonishingly high figures, yet there is no reason to suspect that they are not typical of the site as a whole. Pit A probably represents an accumulation over some length of time. The deposits in Square N3 certainly do, and the proportion of tunny is uniformly high both in Stratum 3 and in the deposits of Phases 1 or 2. It has been estimated that before 1939, the fish-consumption in Greece was 24 per cent of the total meat consumed. But tunny and other scombrid fish formed only 1 per cent of this fish- consumption, by far the greater part being made up of smaller sparids (maridhes), as well as sardines, anchovies, and red mullet. (Although such smaller fish were not preserved at Saliagos 1 Excluding donkey, quoted from Greece, iii (1944), 418.</page><page sequence="113">THE SALIAGOS CULTURE 79 they may in fact further have augmented the fish diet.) Indeed, the total catch of Scombridae in Greece in the year 1936 was no more than 400 metric tons {Greece, ii (1944), 91), only seventy times the quantity recovered from Pit A alone at Saliagos !

There were insufficient cephalopod remains preserved to allow of their incorporation in the table. We are here in face of a factor not hitherto considered in the prehistoric Aegean. These fish must have been deliberately caught, for stranding - an adequate enough explanation for the two whale vertebrae found - could scarcely account for such quantities or for so regular a supply. It may well be that the migration pattern of tunny was very different six thousand years ago from the present one. Tunny fishing was important in Classical times (Michell, 1957, 288) and Aelian refers to tunny fishing in Naxos {De Natura Animalium, xv. 5). In Etruria look-out posts for the shoals {Thunnoskopeia) have been found {RE vi. 719, s.v. 'Thynnos') and the annual catch was clearly an event of crucial importance, as is the case in Sicily today. The situation at Saliagos may have been the same. It is remarkable therefore that nothing in the cultural assemblage can be associated with fishing. No fish-hooks have been found, indeed there are few finds offish-hooks from the Neo- lithic Aegean; in the Cyclades they first appeared in the Early Bronze Age (Tsountas, 1899, pl. 10, 38 and 19). The waisted weights may conceivably have been net sinkers. Itis very possible, however, that the numerous obsidian points were not in fact arrowheads but spearheads and leister prongs. Should this be so, this characteristic trait of the Saliagos culture would indicate a marked specialization. It remains to be shown that tunny fishing was an important occupation at other sites of the culture, which were indeed recognized in the first instance by the typical obsidian points. There is, however, nothing inherently improbable in the suggestion. Tunny are usually fished from boats, which were undoubtedly available, and with the use of nets. The recent claim for flax at Early Neolithic Çatal Hüyük (Ryder, 1965, 176) raises the possibility that these were of linen. But if this were not available, vegetable fibres or thongs of goathide would have been used. The unusually shallow and narrow configuration of the bays at Saliagos (Map, fig. 24), both to north and south of the isthmus, may have been peculiarly</page><page sequence="114">8o EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS favourable to tunny fishing. Once inside either of these bays the fish could probably have been driven ashore with nets and boats, and then clubbed and speared. Clearly a single catch was enormous. It would be interesting to know how early was the origin of the Classical practice of curing the tunny (Thompson, 1947, 88). Shellfish were found in great quantities around the site, and 35 species have been identified (Appendix IX). Although representing a much smaller meat weight than the fish or livestock, the presence, in such large quantities, of limpets, which are difficult to collect, shows that they did not supplement the diet in a merely casual way. They were clearly more highly valued at Saliagos than in present-day Antiparos. The interesting find of a cuttlefish guard is a useful reminder that the cephalopods may also have formed a significant part of the diet, although naturally very little trace of them was found. Tsountas records (1898, 200, n. 4) that at the end of the last century the yearly catch of octopus in Antiparos was 25,000 kg. The inhabitants of Saliagos will scarcely have overlooked this savoury item of diet, and again the obsidian points may have served to tip the prongs used, in the modern manner, to catch the unwary octopus. The sea certainly played an important role, if not the dominant one, as a food source for the people of Saliagos. There is little evidence of weaving at Saliagos, and certainly no needles were found. But the pierced discs, classed above as spindle-whorls, may be taken as sufficient evidence that the wool from the sheep was being used. The waisted weights, mentioned above, may conceivably have been used as loom-weights. Although the date of the first use of flax is problematical, it is safe to assume that skins and hides were used. The production of basketry is attested by the find of several mat-impressions in the pottery (plate lv) . Such impressions are already well known for the Cyclades from the very numerous examples on the bases of pots from Chalandhriani in Syros, and other islands. The principal craft of the Saliagos people was the production of pottery. The only material bearing on its manufacture was the series of sherd burnishers and cut-to-shape shell burnishers, together with a lump of pumice, which probably served the same purpose. No traces of a kiln were discovered, but there can be no doubt that the pottery, with the exception of the very rare imports, was made locally. The obsidian industry was a local one, as the great quantities of waste testify. The worked artefacts are not likely to have been exported, however, since waste material is also found on most Aegean sites where obsidian artefacts occur. The obsidian was brought from Melos, and there is evidence that a few fragments in fact derived from the East Aegean source in Giali (Appendix IV) . The material for the axes seems to have come chiefly from Naxos (Appendix II), while the muscovite-biotite-gneiss used to make rubbers may have been brought from the same island (Appendix III, 3). With these exceptions the Paros-Antiparos economy of the time seems to have been a self-supporting one. There is no doubt, however, that sea travel had long been a practicable proposition (Ren- frew, Cann, and Dixon, 1965, 238), whether in long boats, as in Early Cycladic times, or on smaller craft. It is doubtful whether sea trade was already sufficiently established to make piracy a worth-while occupation. The apparently defensive nature of the perimeter wall, however, indicates that there was at any rate a risk of marauders, while a proportion at least of the points may have been destined for a human rather than a piscine quarry. Little is known of the social or religious life of the culture, or of the disposal of the dead. No signs of a cemetery were found, and the absence of objects of the Saliagos culture from the art markets suggests that none has ever been discovered. On the other hand, in the whole of the excavation, only very few and insignificant traces of human remains of Neolithic date were found</page><page sequence="115">THE SALIAGOS CULTURE 8l (in Square Oi, Pit B), and it would seem that human remains were systematically removed from the settlement. It is very possible that with the rise in the sea level since Neolithic times, some sort of cemetery, perhaps on the slopes of the promontory, has been destroyed and sub- merged. Certainly in view of the stratified find at Saliagos of a violin figurine of Early Cycladic form, it would cause no surprise to learn that burial customs similar to those of the Early Cycladic cultures were already in operation. Indeed, the find of a cist grave, partially submerged, off Remmatonisi, might lend support to the idea, were there any way of dating it. AFFINITIES OF THE SALIAGOS CULTURE SETTLEMENT Small village settlements of the size of Saliagos are of common occurrence in many regions in prehistoric times. Often circumstances do not allow of an accurate estimate of the size of the settlement. In this case also the task is made difficult by erosion and the action of the sea, but the size of the island itself at the present time gives a lower limit. In the Cyclades, settlements of this type situated on a low hill near the sea were fairly common in the Early Bronze Age. Excavated examples, of the Grotta-Pelos culture, are Grotta in Naxos (Kondoleon, 1959, i960, and 1961) and Pyrgos in Paros (Tsountas, 1898, 170). The Late Neo- lithic cemetery of Kephala in Kea (Caskey, 1962 and 1964) was attached to a settlement of similar scale, although this was set higher on a rather taller hill. The discovery of a perimeter wall at Saliagos is of considerable interest. Walls, usually with a defensive purpose, are known from the Near East as early as Pre-pottery CA' Jericho, Hacilar II, and Mersin XVI. In Greece, Dhimini is the earliest settlement for which such a device has been published (Tsountas, 1908, pl. II). In the Cyclades, comparable structures first make their appearance in the Keros-Syros culture, where the fortifications of the acropolis of Chalan- dhriani (Tsountas, 1899, ΓΙ8) may now be compared with the important site of Panermos in South-east Naxos, recently excavated by Mr. Ch. Doumas (1964, 41 1 ; fig. 2 and pl. 483). The small size of this 'kastro' - it is perhaps no more than a fortified farmstead - makes it suitable for comparison with Saliagos. The 'bastion' at Saliagos may not, in reality, have been a true circular tower constructed with a defensive purpose. If indeed it was such, it can again be compared with Chalandhriani and Panermos, and the much earlier example at Jericho, as well as the bastions of the Early Helladic II period at Lerna (Caskey, 1958, 125). For the stone foundations, with a superstructure of mud-brick or some other material, there are numerous Near Eastern parallels: the foundations at Jarmo (Braidwood and Howe, i960, pl. 13B) in particular are similar in appearance to those of Saliagos. In less stony regions, as at Çatal Hüyük, Nea Nikomedeia, or Karanovo, tauf 'or pisê was often used for the foundations as well, but this is hardly a significant cultural difference. It may be of interest that small irregular patches of stones, like those in the uppermost layers at Saliagos (plate xiii, b) were discovered at Mersin in Level XXIV, where they were inter- preted as silos (Garstang, 1953, pls. Ill and V). It is possible that the larger and more regular Structure G at Saliagos (plate vii) served the same purpose. THE POTTERY The pottery assemblage at Saliagos cannot at present be related closely to any other. Indeed its two most striking features, the frequency of open bowls often set on a high pedestal base, and C 4316 G</page><page sequence="116">82 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS the use of matt- white paint applied on a dark ground and with a great variety of motifs, cannot adequately be paralleled elsewhere in the Aegean. Pedestal bowls are certainly found in the Neolithic Aegean, although not in such a high proportion, and indeed they are common both in Eastern Europe and in Anatolia. They are not found, however, in Neolithic Crete, and are rather unusual in the islands of the Eastern Aegean (some rather short examples are illustrated by Heidenreich, 1936, pls. 31 and 64). Fruit-stands were not found in the Chalcolithic at Beycesultan, and in Anatolia it would seem that only the central sites such as Alaca and Alishar (Mellaart, 1962, 22) had high stand bases, while those in the west did not. Certainly the low bases of Troy, and the little footed cups of Poliochni make a poor parallel. The shape of the pedestal bases at Vinca and in theTripolye and Cucuteni cultures of Eastern Europe (Vulpe, 1957, 131 and 212) is strikingly similar, but the decoration is not, and indeed the only acceptable parallels close at hand for the Saliagos 'fruit-stands' are those of mainland Greece. In Thessaly the pedestal base has long been known as a prominent feature of the Dhimini culture (Tsountas, 1908, pl. 10), although at Saliagos the rim never rises to opposing points. The form makes its appearance in the Arapi (Dhimini I) phase (Milojcic, 1959, 15) although it is preceded in the Sesklo culture by more squat stand-bases (Milojcic, 1959, 42, fig. 12, 2). In Macedonia the form is a prominent one in the Late Neolithic (Heurtley, 1939, 161, no. 145). It is seen also further south: fruit-stands are found at Elateia in the bothros of Trench 3, in a variety of fabrics (Weinberg, 1962, 185) and similar shapes in Neolithic Urfirnis ware come from Corinth (Weinberg, 1937, 502) and other Peloponnesian sites. As in Chalcolithic Anatolia the stands are sometimes perforated in ajouré technique, but this is not always the case. Certainly no examples of this kind were found at Saliagos. Dark burnished ware, with white-painted decoration, is of comparatively late origin in the Near East and in Greece. There is no painted decoration on the dark-faced pottery of Crete, which has a very early inception. The earliest white-painted decoration in Anatolia would seem to be that of Late Chalcolithic Beycesultan (Lloyd and Mellaart, 1962, fig., p. 1 and p. 2) although surface-finds from further east might also be early in date (Mellaart, 1954, 194 f.). The rather scanty white decoration of Samos (Heidenreich, 1936, pl. 40), from Kalimnos (Furness, 1956, pl. XXIII) and from Emborio VII-VI in Chios may date from this time. This west Anatolian tradition of white-painted decoration, limited to a sparse open network of straight lines, persisted to the Troy I period (Lamb, 1936 a, pl. XXV). In Greece, white-painted decoration is a common feature of Larissa ware (Wace and Thompson, 191 2, 105, fig. 55). It is first seen rather earlier in the Dhimini I phase (Milojcic, 1959, 14 and 43, figs. 13, 9. 12; 14 and 16). At Elateia, like the fruit stands, it makes its appear- ance before the Late Neolithic mat-painted wares (Weinberg, 1962, 188, and pl. 62a, 2-5). It is common too in the Late Neolithic of Macedonia (Heurtley, 1939, 153, fig. 18) None of these examples can rival the Saliagos white-painted ware for its great variety of decoration - ladders, zigzags, rows of triangles, lozenges, squares, swags, arcs, parallel wavy lines, chequer boards, and caduceus motifs. Meanders and spirals, however, do not occur at Saliagos. Nowhere in South Greece or in West Anatolia is so rich a repertoire to be seen: indeed, for the entire Neolithic period in the Aegean, only Thessaly can provide a rival (e.g. Wace and Thompson, 191 2, 95, fig. 47 or 137, fig. 83). There is, however, no detailed resemblance between the two, and the analogy can go little further than to indicate a comparable exuber- ance of spirit. There are other parallels with mainland Greece among the pottery. The import sherds, for example, are painted with dark paint on a light ground, a fabric totally unknown in Neolithic</page><page sequence="117">THE SALIAGOS CULTURE 83 Crete, West Anatolia, or the islands of the eastern Aegean. The painted wares of Macedonia offer no good comparison. Indeed, although there are similarities with the painted wares of Thessaly, the closest analogy would seem to be the mat-painted ware of Central and South Greece (Weinberg, 1962, pl. 67; Weinberg, 1937, 513-14; Kunze, 1931, 38-44). The buff fabric at Saliagos has in several instances a greenish tinge which would seem to link it with the matt- painted ware of Corinth rather than with that of Boeotia and Phocis (Weinberg, 1962, 197). The finger-impressed and applied decorations likewise have parallels in Greece : the former is seen at Argissa in the Dhimini III period (Milojcic, 1959, 46, figs. 16, 19, and 25) and in the recent Neolithic finds near Kastri in Kythera (oral information from Mr. J. N. Coldstream), where a double row of impressions was set into a raised platform at the rim. Various sites show some kind of applied decoration : the closest in style to that of Saliagos is perhaps the moustache- like arrangement seen at Sesklo and at Dhimini (Tsountas, 1908, figs. 124 and 125). Applied blobs are seen at Knossos (Evans, 1964, pl. 46, 1-6) and at other Aegean sites. The repertoire of handle-forms at Saliagos contains several distinctive types, which can be compared with finds in the islands of the eastern Aegean. In particular, the horned handles (plate xxxii) find close parallels in Levels X-IX at Emborio and at A. Gala in Chios (Furness, 1956, 198, fig. 14, 9-10). Similar shapes are found at Tigani in Samos (Heidenreich, 1936, pl. 44A, 2). The type is common in Macedonia (Heurtley, 1939, figs. 19 and 30) and is found in Thessaly (Tsountas, 1908, 279, figs. 214-17). Other examples in Crete and Anatolia have been collected by Furness (1956, 204). The form, although a striking one, is thus widespread in its distribution. The pillar handle is essentially a variety of the horn handle, where the horn is accentuated ; better differentiated from the grip of the handle and more nearly cylindrical in shape. Again it is found in the islands of the eastern Aegean, although less commonly than the simple horned variety (Furness, 1956, pl. XVIII, 6). Similar examples occur in Crete (Evans, 1964, pl. 50 (2), 3). There is a notable concentration also in the Balkans, where pottery of the Bulgarian Vesse- linovo culture (Georgiev, 1961, pls. X and XI) and of the related Paradimi mound inThrace (cf. French, 1961, fig. 7) is often ornamented with a pillar handle. The tab handle again has eastern Aegean affinities: notable especially at Tigani (Heidenreich, 1936, pls. 45, 1 and 46, 4-6), and A. Gala (Furness, 1956, pl. XXII, 8 and 10), it is found also in the succeeding Troy I culture (Lamb, 1936 a, pl. X, 1 1 1 and pl. XI, 8). In these contexts it is often pierced, which is never the case at Saliagos. The saddle handle (plate xxx, a) is seen at Knossos (Evans, 1964, pl. 45, 1-2) where parallels are not otherwise very frequent, The crescentic handle, of which a fine example was also found at Mavrispilia in Mykonos, is surprisingly unusual in the Aegean, despite its simple shape. But similar handles are again found in the eastern Aegean (Furness, 1956, 202 and pl. XXII, 16 and Heidenreich, 1936, pl. 46, 1), notably in Levels IX and VIII at Emborio. They are found also in Thessaly (Tsountas, 1908, 264 fig. 172). The handles thus provide a number of links with the islands of the eastern Aegean, although none of the parallels is exclusive to that area. The predominance of dark-faced ware in the region from early times is another factor to bear in mind, but at Saliagos the heavy burnished bowls, often with rolled rim and horizontally pierced lug handles, are not seen. They develop at Emborio in Chios in Levels VII-VI, contemporary with Kum Tepe Ib in the Troad, and may thus be later than the Saliagos culture. Nor is pattern burnished ware of significance at Saliagos. One or two other aspects of the Saliagos ceramic assemblage are of interest. The carinated bowl, although rare, does occur (plate xvii, e). In Greece this form is not found until the Late</page><page sequence="118">84 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Neolithic, for example in the Dhimini I phase in Thessaly (Milojcic, 1959, 43, fig. 13) and widely in Macedonia (Heurtley, 1939, 148, no. 84; Rodden, 1964 a, pl. 5A). Red-crusted decoration is sometimes seen at Saliagos. Commonly supposed to be of Balkan origin the tech- nique was widely used in the Aegean, principally in the Late Neolithic of Greece, where it is commonest in the Thessalian Rakhmani ware. However, it is found also in the Late Neolithic of Phaistos in Crete, and occurs again on a vase of Pelos-group shape from Naxos (Âberg, 1933, fig. 106). Finally, the presence of a few incised sherds, chiefly with pointillé decoration, is interesting. Although pointillé decoration is found in Neolithic Thessaly (Milojcic, 1959, 46, fig. 16, 12 and 15), Macedonia (Heurtley, 1939, 146, no. 62), Attica (Theochares, 1956, 23, fig. 42), and Crete (Evans, 1964, pl. 46), it is commonest in the islands of the eastern Aegean. It is frequent in Samos (Heidenreich, 1936, pls. 28-30) and seen also in Kalimnos (Furness, 1956, pl. XX, 23). It persists in the West Anatolian region until the Early Bronze Age (Furness, 1956, 186). The affinities of the pottery thus fall into two groups, those relating to the islands of the eastern Aegean, especially Samos and Chios, and those connected with Thessaly and Boeotia, perhaps also with the Péloponnèse for the imported ware. The chronological conclusions to be drawn from these affinities are set out in the next section, 88ff. THE CHIPPED-STONE INDUSTRY It is not easy to set the Saliagos obsidian industry in its Aegean context, since no good and comprehensive description of a post-Palaeolithic industry has yet been published for the area. Indeed it is doubtful if an industry of any complexity, with the same range of well-worked tools as is seen at Saliagos, exists at all in the Aegean. The raw material used was imported from Melos. The identification of several pieces of obsidian from Giali in the E. Aegean (Appendix IV) is, however, of considerable interest. In the earliest Neolithic of Greece (Milojcic, Boessneck, and Hopf, 1962, pls. 18 and 19) and of Crete (Evans, 1964, pl. 63) there is a somewhat impoverished collection of parallel-sided blades and bladelets with some flakelets and a very few true microliths. To judge from the carefully collected industries of Neolithic date from Knossos, Phaistos, and Lerna, kindly made available for inspection by the excavators, the industries do not reach the complexity of Saliagos or of Çatal Hüyük. In mainland Greece only the bifacially worked tanged arrowhead stands out as a characteristically Neolithic form (Belmont and Renfrew, 1964, 399). It is not seen in Crete or West Anatolia, where the chipped-stone industries are exiguous in the extreme. In the Early Bronze Age of mainland Greece and the islands, a considerable industry in parallel-sided blades grew up, best illustrated by the numerous finds at Phylakopi in Melos or at A. Kosmas in Attica. With the parallel-sided blade itself go the conical blade cores and the two characteristic forms of core rejuvenation flake (Geroulanos, 1956). Parallel-sided blades are never common at Saliagos, although they increase in Phase 3, and neat blade cores are unusual. The dog-tooth rejuvenation flake is not found. At present, therefore, only the tanged point can be used as a basis of discussion, for of this form alone are sufficient examples published. The distribution has been discussed elsewhere (Belmont and Renfrew, 1964, 400). The form is common in the Saliagos culture of the Cyclades, represented, although infrequently, in the Late Neolithic of mainland Greece, but totally absent in Crete and West Anatolia. Examples of uncertain date have recently been found in Epirus (Dakaris, Higgs, and Hey, 1964, fig. 6). It is found in Neolithic Jugoslavia, where it is particularly well represented at Butmir, and in Italy. It is notable too in the early cultures of Spain and in Cilicia and the Konya plain, where the rich variety of forms make the only suit-</page><page sequence="119">THE SALIAGOS CULTURE 85 able comparison with Saliagos. Of these the richest is undoubtedly that of Çatal Hüyük (Bialor, 1962; Mellaart, 1964). It is closely related to those of Ilicapinar (Mellaart, 1958) and Mersin XXIX-XXVII (Garstang, 1953, 15), and has affinities with the industries of Phases A and Β in the Amouq plain of Syria (Payne, i960) and with Neolithic Byblos (Cauvin, 1962). With their pressure-flaked projectile points and javelin heads these differ somewhat from the early lithic industries of Jericho (Kirkbride, i960), which have a Natufian ancestry, and their origins are obscure. As Braidwood remarks (i960, 40) they are predominantly blade-tool industries, and perhaps they will prove to stem from an Upper Palaeolithic tradition in Syro-Cilicia. The Saliagos industry does show several similarities with this group of industries. In both cases the projectile points are generally tanged, never hollow-based, and sometimes barbed. The Anatolian examples, however, are generally longer and narrower, and usually have care- ful flat-flaking only on the non-bulbar surface (Bialor, 1962, 87; Mellaart, 1958, 87; Garstang, 1953, 11; Braidwood, i960, 85-86). The daggers (or lanceheads) at Çatal Hüyük are often of laurel-leaf shape, sometimes with end-to-end symmetry, and worked on both faces (Bialor, 1962, 87, fig. 6, 20). Although longer and more slender than the Saliagos ovates they constitute none the less the closest available parallel for the Saliagos form. Some certainly resemble the Saliagos examples more closely than do the Thessalian 'spearheads' (Tsountas, 1908, 326, and pl. 42, 14-18). The Saliagos 'slugs' also find an equivalent in the Çatal Hüyük fabricators (Bialor, 1962, 92, fig. 8, 10), while the piercers and borers there are the equivalent of the Saliagos nose-pointed blades and flakes. Burins are unusual at both sites although common in the Amouq (described as gravers). The absence of recognizable sickle blades at Saliagos and Çatal Hüyük is accounted for by the dominance of obsidian which does not show the sickle gloss which develops on flint through reaping. It is doubtless for this reason that Mrs. Crowfoot Payne omits the category of sickle blades among the obsidian artefacts at Tell al-Judaidah. The largest classes of artefacts with secondary working at Saliagos are, however, classes F to I. These are flakes and blades, rarely parallel-sided, generally with steep or invasive retouch on one or two edges. It would be conventional to class them as 'scrapers". Perhaps classes G III and I III, often with a prominent saw edge, can be considered to constitute a distinctive type, but in general the range and variety of form and working suggest that the group is atypical. In any case it does not correspond with Braidwood's dictum for the Amouq material that it represents a blade-tool tradition. These tools resemble rather the broader, less regular, and atypical tools of Khirokitia in Cyprus (Stekelis, 1953) although the Saliagos industry has otherwise few affinities with that site. The Saliagos industry is not essentially a blade one: there are only 3-1 per cent parallel- sided blades from Squares R3, S4, and Qi, as against 29 per cent sickle blades and 31 per cent dlade sections at Tell al-Judaidah and 65 per cent blades (in general parallel-sided) from the first season's finds at Çatal Hüyük. It would be wrong therefore to equate it too closely with the Syro-Cilician industries, which are presumably very much earlier. Already by the mid-sixth millennium at Çatal Hüyük West (Mellaart, 1965, 136) and Hacilar, the industry is a poor one, with very few projectile points (Bialor, 1962, 108), and the conclusion that in the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic of Anatolia a fine lithic industry is lacking (Mellaart, 1958, 92) is borne out by the scanty finds in the later Amouq, at Mersin, and at Tarsus (Goldmann, 1956, 255) as well as further west at such sites as Beycesultan, Iasos, Troy, and Poliochni. The Saliagos industry is thus rather isolated geographically and chronologically from those industries where the closest parallels are found. It does not follow, however, that they were of independent origin, and it may be that when an Early Neolithic predecessor in the Cyclades is</page><page sequence="120">86 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS found for the Saliagos culture, its obsidian industry will provide the link between that of Saliagos and those of the sixth millennium in Anatolia. THE SMALL FINDS The two most important single finds at Saliagos from the point of view of cultural affinities are the two undoubted figurines of marble. Both are well-defined types, previously known from other sites, and it is difficult to doubt that the manufacturers of the Saliagos and other examples were working in a common tradition. The seated figurine (plate xlii), although incomplete, can confidently be placed in a class of figurines already well known in the Aegean (Weinberg, 195 1). It compares most closely with the example from Sangri in Naxos (Cook, 1946). However, there are differences in detail: in particular the plump legs of the Saliagos figurine are too fat to be crossed neatly in such a way as to lie more or less horizontally and parallel to each other and to the ground in a Buddha-like posture. Instead they are set obliquely, western fashion, thus differing from most of the Aegean examples. Weinberg argued for an Early Neolithic date for the class and emphasized its Cycladic connections, then documented only by the Sangri find and by the uncertain attribution to Amorgos of the Brussels specimen. While the Saliagos find supports the Cycladic bias of the distribution, it scarcely substantiates the early date. In reality, however, not one of the seated marble figurines previously known is from a reliable context. In the past it has seemed reasonable to date the seated figurines by the analogous series of representations of a woman in a standing position, often with hands at the breast. These are known from the Péloponnèse (Caskey, 1956), Thessaly (Tsountas, 1908, pl. 32, 1 and 2) and Macedonia (Rodden, 1964 b, fig. 8) in Early Neolithic contexts, and are all in clay. An im- pressive variety of rather similar clay figurines, standing and reclining, has been illustrated from the Late Neolithic levels at Hacilar (Mellaart, 1961, pls. VII-XIII). All these can probably be set in the sixth millennium b.c. From the same period comes the beautiful marble figurine of a standing man from Knossos (Evans, 1964, pl. 66, 6). Those standing figurines which show a closer similarity to the seated lady of Saliagos are unfortunately not so well dated: there are two from Aegina (Welter, 1938, 7 and 10) - one of them, now in Munich, seems to be of Spondylus. Another is reputedly from Sparta (Wolters, 1 89 1, 52), and a further figurine similar in many ways to the Cycladic examples has recently turned up in Malta (Evans, 1963, figs. 1-2). However, most writers have concluded that the fat figurines of Greece are in general of Early or Middle Neolithic date (Ucko, 1962), while the thinner more schematic ones are from the Late Neolithic or succeeding periods. The Saliagos figurine must be recognized as falling within a well-defined class whose origins at least are certainly Early Neolithic. The other affinities at Saliagos are certainly later. The 'fiddle idol' (plate xliii, i) at Saliagos has parallels, paradoxically, in precisely the opposite direction chronologically. Schematic Brettidolen of this type have been well known since the excavations of Bent (1884) and Tsountas (1898), and they belong essentially to the Grotta-Pelos culture of the Early Cycladic (Renfrew, 1965). The closest parallel is perhaps the figurine from Pyrgos in Paros (Tsountas, 1898, pl. 11, 10) which has the slender tapering neck common in Early Cycladic figurines. The incision near the top of this prong, however, which at Saliagos doubtless indicates the face, is not seen on the Cycladic examples, although there are unpublished figurines in the Paros Museum from Drios where the face is indicated. Schematic figurines of marble are well known in West Anatolia, although none is yet known</page><page sequence="121">THE SALIAGOS CULTURE 87 from Iasos. The most common form, however, has a prominent disc head (Lamb, 1936 b, fig. 17. 2). At Beycesultan (Lloyd and Mellaart, 1962, fig. F. 1) prong necks are seen, but the arms are emphasized, and the examples in any case date from the Early Bronze Age levels. Close analogies for the schematic marble figurines of the Cyclades are not found in Crete. In Thessaly, however, there are schematic pieces of Late Neolithic date with interesting resemblances (Tsountas, 1908, pl. 37). Despite the Neolithic similarities, the only close parallels for the Saliagos figurine are the Early Cycladic examples, principally of Early Bronze Age date, although some of them could well be contemporary with the Late Neolithic of the mainland. It is clear therefore that the Saliagos figurine is a precursor of the Early Cycladic series, whose origin can now be placed well back in the Neolithic. The other figurines at Saliagos do not conform so closely to a recognized type. The bone pendant and the other of stone which resembles it (plate xliv) may be compared with similar figurines of bone from the Gumelnitsa and Salcutsa cultures of the Balkans (Georgiev and Angelov, 1957, fig. 60) although the resemblance is not a close one. The clay torso (plate xlv, i) is closest to figurines from the Neolithic at Knossos (Evans, 1964, fig. 64) although the form is not a specialized one, and similar fragments have been found in Thessaly (Tsountas, 1908, pls. 34-6). The little green bead (plate xliv, 2) has successors, although not anthropomorphic ones, regards as both colour and workmanship, in the graves of the Grotta-Pelos culture (Tsountas, 1898, pl. 8). The clay feet from Saliagos are of considerable interest, especially since one of them appears to be part of a pottery vessel. It was recently possible to reconstruct such a vessel from the late Middle Neolithic pit at Elateia (Weinberg, 1962, 191) and the excavator has indicated the close parallels in the Danilo culture of Jugoslavia (Korosec, 1964, pl. 8) where indeed other links with Elateia and Saliagos, such as fruit-stands and tanged points, are seen. Closer parallels with the cylindrical and rectangular legs (fig. 77), some indicating the knee and the foot, are seen in the anthropomorphic vases of the Middle Danube in the Tisza and Lengyel cultures (Dombay, i960, pl. XC). A single anthropomorphic vase is known from the Grotta-Pelos culture of the Cyclades (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, 1938, 727, unpublished). Although without separated feet, and of marble, it could be the successor in the area of a tra- dition seen already at Saliagos. Finally, before leaving the figurines, it is worth referring to the rather shapeless marble pebbles (plate xliii, 2-5). Such stones have been found in Early Cycladic graves (Tsountas, 1898, pl. 1 1, 2) ; indeed Bent found several in graves in South Antiparos (Bent, 1884, 49) although only after discarding them did he realize their importance. The possible significance of these pebbles has been discussed in some detail by Thimme (1965). Among the adornments, the use of Spondylus for a bracelet (plate xlvi, i) is of interest in view of the widespread use of the material in the Balkans (Galbenu, 1962, fig. 9). But perhaps it is really to be regarded as a maritime habit, and Aegean examples include pendants from Macedonia (Rodden, 1964 b, pl. 8a), bracelets from Thessaly (Wace and Thompson, 191 2, pl. 79 a, e-g) and a figurine from Aegina now in Munich (Welter, 1938, 10, fig. 8). Its occurrence at Saliagos, where numerous unworked Spondylus shells were found (Appendix IX) need there- fore occasion no surprise. The bead of red serpentine has a perforation resembling that of a V-boring, well known in the west Mediterranean. A similar example is known from Thessaly (Tsountas, 1908, pl. 43, 2). The perforation is in any case not a very neat one.</page><page sequence="122">88 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Two fragments of marble bowls were found at Saliagos, thus foreshadowing the magnificent industry of the Cycladic Early Bronze Age. Marble bowls are not found in Crete until the Early Minoan II period, and in West Anatolia also appear to be a feature of the Early Bronze Age, rather than of the Late Chalcolithic. In Greece, however, they have a high antiquity. Stone bowls have been found in early levels at Sesklo, and especially at Nea Makri (Theochares, 1956, 25, % 45)· The bone tools at Saliagos do not display great variety : similar forms are seen in Crete (Evans, 1964, pls. 60-1), the eastern Aegean (Brea, 1964, pl. CLXXVIII), and mainland Greece, where the spatulae (Tsountas, 1908, pl. 45, 17), chisels (ibid. pl. 45, 9-12), narrowed tools (ibid., pl. 45, 1), and points (ibid., pl. 45, 3-5) find their counterparts. The sherd 'burnishers' closely resemble some Hebridean examples (Singer, Holmyard, Hall, 1 95 1, 390), which confirms their use - it is interesting that pumice, used for this purpose, was also found in the Hebrides as well as at Saliagos. The spindle-whorls are all of the flat thin variety, as at Knossos (Evans, 1964, pl. 5) and in Thessaly. The double cone form would seem to have been a later innovation. Among the various stone tools there is little that need excite comment: waisted weihgts are of common occurrence, for instance in Macedonia (Heurtley, 1939, 138,fig. 6,j-k) and in the Eastern Aegean (Brea, 1964, pl. CLXXXVIII, 11, 13, and 14) and saddle-querns and grinders are a common feature on most Neolithic sites. THE PLACE OF THE SALIAGOS CULTURE The Saliagos culture is sharply distinguished from the succeeding Early Cycladic cultures by most of the finds, in particular the pottery and obsidian. The domestic pottery of the Grotta- Pelos culture (Renfrew, 1965, 72) is characterized by heavy slipped and burnished bowls, often with rolled rims (cf. Tsountas, 1898, pl. 9, 17; French, 1961, 112; Belmont and Renfrew, 1965, pl. 124, fig. 3, 16-18). The funerary wares are chiefly cylindrical or spherical pyxides, the latter sometimes on a high foot, often with herringbone incisions. None of these is seen at Saliagos. The other Early Cycladic funerary form is the jar with conical neck and four vertical suspension lugs (cf. Zervos, 1956, figs. 64 and 71). This is not unlike plate xviii, 6, right, but the Saliagos example is painted. There is no painted ware in the Grotta-Pelos culture. In the obsidian industry there is a complete division. The single striking characteristic of the Early Cycladic obsidian industry is the use of parallel-sided blades, together with the absence of artefacts showing secondary working. At Saliagos the wealth of well- worked artefacts is very striking. Admittedly, however, the proportion of parallel-sided blades increased in Phase 3. This may be a sign of movement towards the Early Bronze Age obsidian industry. Significantly, too, the percentage of sherds with white-painted decoration decreases markedly. The presence of worked marble vessels could also be interpreted as a link with the Cycladic Early Bronze Age. The only convincing connection with the Grotta-Pelos culture, however, is in the find of a fiddle-idol of marble which is unmistakably related to the Early Cycladic examples, although distinguished from these by the incision at the face. This find would seem in itself sufficient to indicate continuity of some kind, but the other and numerous dissimilarities show that it cannot be a close one. The relations of the Attic-Kephala culture have been summarized elsewhere (Renfrew, 1965, 46 f.) and will be published in detail by Mr. John Coleman. The striking and important finds of the Kephala cemetery (Caskey, 1964) have few parallels in the Cyclades. Only the marble rhyton relates it firmly with the Grotta-Pelos culture. There is little to connect it with Saliagos,</page><page sequence="123">THE SALIAGOS CULTURE 89 for the pattern-burnish decoration, 'coal scuttle' scoops, and clay figurine heads all point west- ward to Attica rather than to the islands. The full Aegean Early Bronze Age, as exemplified by the Keros-Syros culture in the Cyclades, by Early Helladic II, by Troy II, and by Early Minoan I and II, is yet further removed from the Saliagos culture. The pottery of the mainland and that of the Cyclades at this time show certain affinities, but together with the whole Early Minoan range, they are virtually without Saliagos parallels. Much the same is true for the Macedonian and West Anatolian Early Bronze Age, where the use of metal, the heavy black burnished ware, the presence of jugs and tripods, the use of pins and of shaft-hole axes and the absence of a sophisticated lithic industry serve to underline the distinction. These essential differences from the Aegean Early Bronze Age cultures suggest that the Salia- gos culture must be considerably earlier. It could hardly have persisted as late as 3000 b.c., by which date the Aegean E.B. 1 cultures were probably under way. While Saliagos has few affinities with the Early Bronze Age, it has equally few with the Early Neolithic in the Aegean. In particular, white-painted pottery and high-stand bases are not elsewhere seen in the Early Neolithic period. The several parallels with Early Neolithic Knossos probably have little chronological significance, for similar links occur with the later cultures of the eastern Aegean islands, and indeed between these and the Knossian Early Neolithic. Although the seated fat figurine would at first sight seem an Early Neolithic form, the Saliagos find is the only one of this type from a specific context. It would be unwise therefore to attach much chronological significance to it. The export of Melian obsidian to Early Neolithic sites in Crete, Thessaly, and elsewhere (Renfrew, Cann, and Dixon, 1965) at least shows that there may have been occupation in the Cyclades in Early Neolithic times. As suggested above, this may perhaps account for the affinities between the obsidian industry at Saliagos and those of Cilicia and the Konya plain, which are surely earlier. This process of elimination would therefore serve to place the Saliagos culture in the Middle to Late Neolithic period in the Aegean. It is precisely here that most of the affinities, discussed in the last section, fall. Indeed, the culture, although not closely resembling any other in the area, is instantly recognizable as a later Neolithic culture of the Aegean. The pottery and small finds are in no way exotic, despite the scarcity of really good parallels. A study of the pottery shows a certain bifurcation of parallels between east and west, with none the less a considerable degree of chronological consistency. In mainland Greece dark-faced wares with white paint, fruit-stands, vessels standing on legs, and tanged points all make their appearance at about the same time, late in the Middle Neolithic period (Weinberg, 1965, 40). The find in the bothros of Trench 3 at Elateia has been dated by Weinberg (1964, 208), using a somewhat circuitous argument, to about 4300 b.c. This first appearance in mainland Greece of features seen in the Saliagos culture should give us something like an upper limit for Saliagos, although if they are in fact of eastern derivation they could be rather earlier in the islands. The import of matt-painted ware, conceivable from the Corinth area, confirms that the Saliagos culture continued into the Late Neolithic period, and thus into the fourth millennium. The similarities with the east Aegean pottery are chiefly in points of detail, such as handle forms. But it must not be forgotten that dark-faced pottery may itself have originated in Anatolia. The find of obsidian from Giali at Saliagos (Appendix IV) may also be of relevance here. There is no good published sequence for the eastern Aegean at this time, but Mr. Sinclair Hood has kindly allowed us to refer to the unpublished material from his excavations at Emborio in Chios, studied with his permission by Colin Renfrew in 1964. There appears to be an unbroken</page><page sequence="124">go EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS succession at the site from Level X to Levels V-II, which are to be set in the Troy I- II period. The finds from Emborio X relate to the earlier of the remains at the A. Gala cave, and hence to the Late Neolithic of Hacilar (Mellaart, 1960 a, 89). The lunate handles of Levels IX and VIII at Emborio form a link with Saliagos, as do the strikingly similar horned handles and perhaps the lack of incised ware in Emborio X. The absence both at Saliagos and from the lower levels at Emborio of pattern-burnished ware and of heavy burnished pottery with rolled rims of Kum Tepe Ib aspect would seem to set them firmly before the latest Chalcolithic of West Anatolia. The Hacilar culture has radiocarbon dates in the later sixth millennium b.c., so that one would expect to place the Saliagos culture between that date and the inception of the Kum Tepe Ib culture. If the recently suggested and surely exaggeratedly early dates for Troy I (Mellaart, i960 b, French, 1961, 117) be rejected, it might be reasonable to set the inception of Kum Tepe Ib around 3500 b.c. The Saliagos culture would then fall somewhere within the range 4500-3500 b.c. The ceramic links with the east Mediterranean would thus accord broadly with the Greek ones. These conclusions were reached before the results of the Radiocarbon determinations re- ported in Appendix XII became known. They have been very satisfactorily confirmed by the coherent series of C-14 dates, which set the duration of the site between about 4300 b.c. and 3700 b.c. Using the 5730 half-life for C-14, these dates are increased to give a range from 4500 to 3900 b.c. And when the dendrochronological calibration of C-14 dates allows their more accurate expression in calendar years, the site may be set yet earlier by several centuries. At present, however, in order to make valid comparison with other C-14 dates, the range of c. 4300 b.c. to c. 3700 b.c., obtained using the 'Libby value' for the half-life (5568 years), is the most con- venient. The dates are in every way consistent with the parallels suggested above, confirming the contemporaneity of Saliagos with the transition from Middle to Late Neolithic in mainland Greece, and serving to corroborate the chronological equation of the site with Emborio phases IX and VIII. The duration of the occupation of Saliagos is statistically rather less sure. At the end of the excavation, a short occupation of 200 to 400 years was suggested. However, since the contexts from which the C-14 samples were taken effectively span the life of the site, from Stratum 1 to Stratum 3, the estimate resulting from the Radiocarbon dates of c. 500^120 years must be accepted as the best available. Such a duration certainly allows chronological scope for the rather minor changes which are observed in the lithic and ceramic industries. Taking a middle point of about 4000 b.c. for the occupation of the site, Saliagos may be seen as the contemporary of the early Vinca culture in Jugoslavia (cf. 4010 b.c. (Gro 1546), for late Vinca A), and between the Vesselinovo culture (cf. 4410 b.c. (Bln-158), for Karanovo III) and the early Gumelnitsa culture (cf. 3890 b.c. (Bln-136), and 3879 b.c. (Bln-151), for Karanovo V) in Bulgaria. There is a date of 368o± 150 b.c. (Heidelberg) for the Dimini culture of Thessaly, regrettably not yet published in Radiocarbon, and this, and the Danilo/Vinca affinities of the later Middle Neolithic at Elateia support the chronological equation of Saliagos with the Middle to Late Neolithic transition in mainland Greece. In Crete, Saliagos may be set in the period between Stratum VI (4260 b.c. (BM 273)) and Stratum IV (3730 b.c. (BM 279)) at Neolithic Knossos. Regrettably little is known of the Neolithic of Western Anatolia. But Saliagos may be con- sidered the contemporary of Late Chalcolithic Mersin (Mersin XV), of phase Ε in the Amouq,</page><page sequence="125">THE SALIAGOS CULTURE 91 of the earlier Ubaid period in Mesopotamia (4120 b.c. (H-138) for Warka), and perhaps of the Badarian phase in Predynastic Egypt (cf. 3794 b.c. (G 810), and 3627 b.c. (C 814) for the succeeding Amratian phase) . This was the time of the Lengyel culture in Central Europe. The Danubian Neolithic expan- sion was in progress further north, and the Impressed Ware Neolithic was already well under way in Spain and throughout the west Mediterranean. The C-14 dates of Saliagos thus place the culture firmly within the later Neolithic of the Aegean, preceding by more than a millennium the development of Aegean metallurgy and the full Aegean Early Bronze Age. They serve to substantiate the conclusions reached on purely typological grounds. The affinities of the Saliagos culture are not so marked in the case of any one culture as to single out the latter as a likely point of departure for the inhabitants of Saliagos. Certainly there are features besides the pottery which link it with Greece. The tanged points in particular are not known in West Anatolia or in Crete, although seen in Greece from the time of the Elateia bothros to the onset of the Early Bronze Age. Marble bowls too are known from the Neolithic of Greece, but not from West Anatolia or Crete. On the other hand, the obsidian industry has at present few parallels closer than Çatal Hüyük or Mersin. Indeed, were distance no barrier, a case could be made out for a link with Mersin XXIV, with its dark-faced ware, sometimes decorated in white (although with infilled incisions), flat-flaked obsidian arrowheads, flat spindle whorls (Garstang, 1953, fig. 18), and silo bases. However, it would seem better to view the Saliagos culture as indigenous, doubtless with local antecedents, sharing features in common with the ancestors of the Middle and Late Neolithic of Greece and the Chalcolithic of Anatolia. In this way due weight can be given to the unique features of the Saliagos culture, without denying the validity of those cultural affinities that are observed.</page><page sequence="126">APPENDIX I. RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL CHANGE IN THE SALIAGOS AREA SINCE NEOLITHIC TIMES Ian a. Morrison, University of Edinburgh As indicated in the main text, this Appendix is a preliminary note on a series of geomorpho- logical and archaeological surveys initiated to explore the possibility that relative sea level was lower in this area when the Neolithic site on Saliagos was occupied. This work proved most productive. Over twenty submerged or partially submerged archaeological sites were located. Besides wrecks and other 'marine' features, these range in character from wells and cemented walls to tombs; there is even an ancient stone quarry. The systems of rock-cut trenches mentioned in the main text were found to have a widespread distribution both above and below the present sea level, and appear to represent a Hellenistic field-system of vine trenches. A detailed description and analysis of this large and varied assemblage of new material will be published separately. The object of this Appendix is to draw attention to those aspects of our findings that relate directly to the present excavation report. The work took the following form. In 1964 Robin (Jack) Crump, Michael Gee, Michael Hassel, Frank Irving, Ian Morrison, and Robert Ward made a detailed survey of the submarine morphology of the part of the Antiparos Strait where Saliagos lies, and also started to investi- gate the rich variety of submerged antiquities that the Antiparos area was found to contain. In addition, Morrison made a geomorphological and site survey of the coastline of Antiparos and of part of West Paros, and visited sites relevant to sea-level change on neighbouring islands. In 1965, helped principally by Miss Ann Stoves, he consolidated the previous season's work by investigating further underwater antiquities and by making a comprehensive photographic record of the most interesting sites from both years' investigations, using a simple underwater photogrammetric technique. In both seasons William Phelps gave valuable help and discussion. The location of so many previously unrecorded underwater sites in the short time available was possible only through the spirited co-operation of the Antiparote octopus hunters, especially Iannis, Petros, and Peppino Marianos. Today Saliagos is a very small island indeed. Its maximum length is scarcely more than 100 metres, and the actual area over which land vegetation of any sort survives is equivalent only to a rectangle of about 40 by 100 metres. Of this area only about one-eighth stands even 4 metres above the present level of the sea, and on windy days sea-spray drifts right over the island. There is no source of fresh water. It is of course possible that the Neolithic villagers might have chosen such an incommodious islet in the interests of defence, but of itself the island site presents little to bafHe an attacker. The 'cliffs' are discontinuous, and at their highest achieve a meagre 3 ' metres in height. Lying but 370 metres distant from Antiparos, Saliagos is accessible to attack by competent swimmers or by any boatmen with the simplest of craft. Thus as soon as the scale and nature of the Neolithic settlement on Saliagos became apparent, it was clear that it would be worth exploring the idea that during the Neolithic the site presented a more sub- stantial basis for settlement. One possibility was that simple horizontal erosion by the sea had significantly reduced the size of the islet since the Neolithic. Certainly the freshness of the surfaces of the little cliffs around the island, and the way that Neolithic structures are being exposed and destroyed in these</page><page sequence="127">APPENDIX I. RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL CHANGE 93 cliffs, shows that quite vigorous erosion is going on at present. However, on Saliagos, and indeed in the area studied in general, it is notable that the present sea level does not accord with any particularly marked morphological discontinuity. Thus, although erosion is going on, there is no well-defined planation of the bed-rock related to present sea level. Neither is there anything to suggest that Saliagos might have been reduced to its present size by the stripping away of large quantities of more vulnerable material. Indeed, even well clear of the present reach of the sea the bed-rock is seldom overlain by any significant thickness of unconsolidated sediments. Thus it does not seem likely that simple horizontal erosion at the present level of land and sea could have altered the nature of the settlement site offered by Saliagos in any substantial way since the Neolithic occupation. Hence, if the possibility of a significant change in the size of Saliagos is to be considered, the case must depend rather on evidence of change of level. The best evidence of such a change in level would have been the presence of Neolithic land- built structures, such as house-foundations, running below the sea. However, the chance of finding any such early evidence was slim indeed. Certainly several structures, such as the hearth shown in fig. 14, were found very close to present sea level and various walls run off the cliff (e.g. in Squares T2 and T4, fig. 7). But the loose stone structures characteristic of the site proved difficult enough to recognize on land in the initial stages of the careful excavation possible there (see plan, fig. 9). Under water, and with permission only to explore, not to excavate, it would have been very difficult to prove anything from such material even if it were as well pre- served as that on land. The chance, however, of any trace at all of such structures surviving wave attack of the sort encountered round Saliagos was negligible. Even the quite substantial jetty constructed for the use of the excavation was promptly broken up by the sea, despite the fact that it had been placed with some care on the sheltered south side of the island. It is notable that although many submerged structures were found, these were all of a relatively durable nature, and nowhere was anything recognized as vulnerable as the structures of the Neolithic occupation of Saliagos. The sea bed was also searched for small finds and pottery, but with little success around Saliagos. Though a few wave- worn sherds were found, these all appeared to be late. Saliagos itself did, however, provide a pointer that suggests an over-all rise in sea level since the Neolithic occupation. This is pit A (see plate va) At was clear that the stratigraphy of this feature represents refuse accumulating over a period of time in a dry pit. Yet the base of the pit is now some 80 cm. below the salt-water table, which here corresponds directly with the present level of the sea. Conceivably, in this particular case, simple horizontal erosion without change of relative sea level could be invoked to explain away this difference from the conditions pre- vailing when the pit was filled. Of itself the pit proves nothing, but taken with the evidence of the area around Saliagos, it is suggestive. Before considering this evidence, the matter may be set in perspective by examining just how large a change in level would be necessary to make a real alteration in the environment at present offered by Saliagos. It was to throw light on this that a detailed survey was made of the submarine morphology of the part of the Antiparos Strait where Saliagos lies. Extensive reconnaissances of the sea bed were made. A major objective of these was to ascer- tain to what extent the present form of the bottom was due to accumulations of sand. Clearly the pattern of such accumulations might change through time, and measurements based on such features would have limited value in the present context. It was found, however, that the form of the bottom closely reflected the morphology of the rock head, and indeed in most of the critical shoal areas the bed-rock is either visible or covered by only a thin veneer of sand. One may thus feel confident that the figures given below, for the magnitude of changes in level</page><page sequence="128">94 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS necessary for certain alterations in the distribution of land and sea, are maximum figures. They refer to the actual configuration of the bed of the Strait where this is clear of ephemeral features. In practice, it seems realistic to believe that rather smaller changes of level would have the effect of linking the islands. There are several reasons why this is so. One reason is that our measured traverses were made along straight lines, whereas the shallowest courses between islands were curves. With the equipment available to us, it would have taken more time than we possessed to fix the complex curves of the shallowest routes along the submarine cols be- tween the islands. Another reason is that although the sand features of today were avoided in our measurements, these exist; and such features presumably also existed in the past. The con- figuration of this area is such that it seems not unlikely that sand bars would play an important part in linking the islands at slightly lower sea levels than that of today. Clearly if this be accep- ted, for given topographical changes one may postulate smaller actual changes of level than the measurements suggest. However, one cannot be sure of the ancient distribution of sand features, so the figures have not been modified. Similarly, no allowance for scouring since submergence has been incorporated in the figures. The way that the widespread vine-trench systems now below sea level have all been completely stripped of soil suggests, however, that widespread losses have in fact taken place. Such losses would again mean that figures rather smaller than our measurements would be realistic. These depth measurements were made from a boat, and all readings were duplicated. The instrument used was a Vexilar depth gauge. This was calibrated against an accurately marked vertical line by Jack Crump. He found that for the depth range with which we were dealing it was accurate to well within one-third of a metre. Present 'mean sea level' was taken as the nominal datum. The tidal range was so small as to be within the range of atmospheric effects, and was negligible for present purposes. The sounding stations were fixed by triangulation from stations on the islands. The measurements were compared with the various large-scale Admiralty charts of the Strait. The planimetry of the older charts is not accurate in detail, but the recent chart checked well with our surveys. Information from this chart is therefore incorporated in fig. 24, together with our own findings. Ten profiles are shown, together with the line of our traverse between Saliagos and Remmatonisi. The parts numbered 1/2, 3/4, 5/6 and the Saliagos/Remmatonisi traverse were measured in detail as controls. The diagram was drawn up at the end of the 1964 season, and the picture that it gives of the area received a comprehensive check in 1965 when a further extensive underwater inspection of the morphology was carried out and a number of supplementary depth measurements were taken in critical areas. It will be noted that the pro- files in fig. 24 are drawn with the vertical scale exaggerated five times in relation to the hori- zontal scale. It is worth pausing for a moment to consider the distortion that this entails. A man thus drawn, with his shoulders and waist at their actual natural width, would suffer an exagger- ation in height to thirty feet. This is the order of distortion that has been necessary to show these profiles as more than single lines on the diagram published here, for the principal result of our survey is that the Strait is very shallow indeed in relation to its width. Today, even where the Strait is narrowest, more than a kilometre of sea water separates Paros and Antiparos. However, if the sea level were lowered by a mere three metres it would be possible to wade across. A further fall of a metre and a half would enable one to go most of the way dry-shod : it would be possible to walk to either Paros or Antiparos from Saliagos, if one were willing to wade part of the way to Remmatonisi. With a reduction in sea level of five or six metres altogether, Saliagos would be a little hill at the end of a promontory running north from the isthmus linking the two main islands.

As suggested above, it seems realistic to suppose that rather smaller changes of level than those indicated by the figures would produce these results. There is much evidence of actual change. In brief, it seems fair to state that the geomorpho- logical and archaeological evidence agrees in showing that a change of level has indeed occurred here since the Neolithic and that this change has been of a sufficient order of magnitude to effect a marked alteration in the distribution of land and sea. The recorded change was in the right sense to resolve the archaeological improbability of the siting of the Neolithic village. The main points of the evidence run as follows. As noted earlier, though erosion is active today there is little sign of fresh planation related to the present sea level. This leads to the presumption that the sea has not been active at the present level for any great span of time. Other natural evidence also suggests that the sea has only recently reached its present level here. The sea does not appear to have been above this level in recent times in the area studied. There are Pleistocene marine deposits above present sea level (see Anastopoulos, 1963), but a careful search of Antiparos and West Paros revealed no evidence that the sea had been above its present level during the Holocene. There are no recent raised shoreline features, either erosional or depositional. Although it is possible that the swampy flat immediately south of Kastro might reflect deposition to a sea level slightly higher than at present, this is uncertain. Dr. Turner's pollen results from this site were also inconclusive (see Appendix VI). Certainly it is unlikely that the local sea level could have been higher than at present at any time since the Neolithic. The remains of the settlement on Saliagos, and various later sites, showed no sign that this might have been so. On the contrary the evidence encountered throughout the area points to recent submergence, after a substantial period when the land stood higher in relation to the sea. Just how recent this submergence was is not yet known. Several of the originally terrestrial structures found under- water could not be dated closely, and some of these could as well have belonged to medieval or even modern times as to earlier periods. This point is illustrated in a striking way by the com- plex lying off Ayios Yeorgios at the south end of Antiparos. Cemented walls and a beautifully preserved well-head stand on the sea bed there. Near by, on the rising ground near the shore, the present-day farmers of Ayios Yeorgios draw their water from a remarkably similar well. Indeed, such well-heads are in everyday use throughout the islands. Yet the sunken well and walls lie a full three metres below the present surface of the sea. It is difficult to believe that a well would be built with such care if it was to yield only brackish water, so one may assume that when it was in use the land stood higher in relation to the sea by more than the minimal three metres. That this phase of low relative sea level was not merely an ephemeral episode is shown by the variety of the other sites transgressed by the sea in the area studied. These range widely in date and suggest that the land stood higher in relation to the sea here for a considerable period. Indeed there is no evidence from the period that interests us that suggests that the local relative level of the sea had ever approached to within even three or four metres of its present level, prior to the final submergence. This possibility cannot be ruled out, but, as mentioned above, over twenty sites were investigated and between them these seem to leave little time since the Neolithic for hypothetical phases when the relative sea level might have stood higher than this. Some characteristic samples of the evidence will now be considered, by working back through time from the more recent towards the Neolithic. The well-head mentioned above and other undated but clearly late features imply a local sea level more than three metres lower than at present. Similarly, large parts of the system of Hellenistic vine-trenches would not have been</page><page sequence="131">APPENDIX I. RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL CHANGE 97 workable had the local sea level not stood at least three metres lower then. Indeed one may suspect that it was considerably lower than this, for it is difficult to believe that the enormous investment of labour involved in the cutting of such trenches in the bed-rock would have been contemplated for vulnerable areas of salty ground. It is equally difficult to believe that the now sunken parts of the trench system were set out in areas where the only soil was sea-sand left by some preceding Holocene transgression. Time is required for even thin soils to develop. The present flooding of a classical stone quarry, amongst other things, would appear to reinforce the evidence of the vine-trenches. Professor Kondoleon visited some of the sites in Antiparos in 1965 and told us that Mycenaean remains at Grotta on neighbouring Naxos, where he was excavating (Kondoleon, 1959, i960, 1961), show that relative sea level was certainly more than three metres below the present level in the area at that period too. Around Antiparos, there are at least four underwater sites with carefully built structures that seem to be Bronze Age cists, though of course without a permit for underwater excavation we could not prove this. One of these sites is off a small island between Ayios Yeorgios and Dhespotikon. Above the surface, this island bears a proved Bronze Age cemetery. The associated underwater site implies again that the land stood at least three metres higher relative to the sea then. Again, too, the implication is that the difference in level was rather more than this, for it seems unlikely that cists would be built below the marine water table, especially with the hill now represented by the island so near to hand. Thus there seems little doubt that for a considerable part of the period intervening between the present time and the Neolithic, the area under study has stood at a distinctly higher level than at present relative to the sea. How much the difference in levels was is not known, for none of the submerged sites found was of a sort that indicated an ancient position of the shoreline. Thus, for instance, no submerged port installations were found. Indeed, few of the submerged land-built features would have looked out of place anywhere inland. All that can be said with certainty is that the shoreline lay lower than these sites, and thus that the difference in levels certainly cannot have been less than three metres. Several lines of evidence seem to make it unlikely that the difference was as small as this. Three metres is the figure necessary to bring the surface of the sea to the level of various sites, not to clear them. It seems unlikely that people would go right down to the level of the sea's surface to start setting out vineyards or digging wells and graves. Even if only a minimum figure of, say, three and a half metres of change is accepted, prior to the recent submergence, Saliagos must for long have been over twice its present size. It would have been possible to wade from there first to a considerably enlarged Remmatonisi and thence to the extended shores of either Antiparos or Paros. Given the five- or six-metre change of level that on balance seems a more realistic interpretation of the evidence from our series of sub- merged sites, the distribution of land and sea would be that suggested in fig. 24 (lower). On this evidence, it seems likely that prior to the recent submergence the land stood high in relation to the sea in the area at least as far back as the Bronze Age. Because of the vulnerable nature of the Neolithic structures characteristic of Saliagos, we can neither prove nor disprove definitively that this was the state of affairs in the Neolithic. The submarine evidence of all sorts suggests, however, that this was certainly a distinct possibility. This possibility would seem to be converted to probability by the incongruity of finding such a major settlement on an island that is now so small. Even Pit A on Saliagos, however, fails to eliminate the possibility that the sea level might have been relatively high here during the Neolithic, then fallen away for the long period of our now sunken sites, to rise again at the present day. The relative changes in level in this area C 4316 H</page><page sequence="132">98 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS involve the interplay of eustatic (world-wide) changes of sea level and local tectonic movements of the land. The operation of each of these factors during the last six thousand years is still too much a matter of controversy to allow a balanced judgement of this possibility in terms of their interplay in this region. The degree of relevance of evidence from elsewhere will be discussed in the fuller report that is to follow. Certainly no evidence whatsoever was encountered that would support one in invoking such a double movement here. The conclusions may be summarized as follows. The smallness of Saliagos and its lack of fresh water makes the present islet seem a rather incongruous site for a permanent farming settlement, and indeed there is some evidence on the island itself which hints that the site stood higher in relation to the sea during the Neolithic. It was found that the configuration of the area around Saliagos is such that even a small change in relative sea level would have far- reaching effects on the distribution of land and sea in this area. Geomorphological evidence and the existence of numerous submerged antiquities together show that there has in fact been a submergence here since the Neolithic. This submergence was of the right order of magnitude to explain the apparent anomaly of the siting of the Neolithic settlement on Saliagos. Although the available evidence does not preclude the possibility of invoking an unproved double change of level to negate this conclusion, no support for this was found, and the simpler explanation is therefore favoured.</page><page sequence="133">APPENDIX II. MINERALOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS FROM SALIAGOS M. G. oosTEROM, Vening Meinesz Laboratorium, University of Utrecht The mineralogical compositions of some stone tools and other materials from the Saliagos excavations were investigated by microscopic and X-ray diffraction techniques at the Vening Meinesz Laboratorium of the University of Utrecht, as a result of personal contacts made with the excavators on Antiparos during our own field-work on that island. It seemed worth while to try to identify some of the materials used by the prehistoric islanders through comparison with rocks and mineral deposits in the Cyclades, investigated by our laboratory during the course of geochemical and mineralogical researches in recent years. This idea of combining the results from otherwise unrelated sciences has proved to be of some value. The most promising field of study proved to be the series of stone axes found at Saliagos. This collection included a few axes made of ultramafic1 rocks, which are commonly used elsewhere as a tool material, while others were of iron-ore, a material less frequently used. The majority of axes, however, were made of a dark-green schistose material of somewhat unusual appearance. Only one object (Small Find no. 9, plate xxxviii, 4) could readily be identified as a volcanic rock, from the island Kavouras (North Phira) in the vicinity of Saliagos. Macroscopic examina- tion proving indecisive for a petrological identification of the axes, it seemed advisable to take small chips, representative of each type of material, for further investigation in the laboratory. The results have been collected in Table 24. The principal result of the X-ray investigation of the axes is the detection of a similar mineral composition in the iron-ore and the schistose examples. At first, indeed, we had thought the schistose rock to be a highly altered fine-grained volcanic rock. In fact, however, both iron-ore and schistose axes are found to consist of the same minerals - diaspore, haematite, and chlori- toid2 - in varying amounts. The presence of chloritoid especially proved to be of diagnostic significance. Without doubt it can be said that both types of axe material originate from emery deposits. Considerable amounts of emery are found in the eastern part of the island of Naxos as inter- calations within a marble-schist formation.3 In plate lvii, a, the X-ray diffraction patterns of the rock material of the Saliagos objects (upper) are compared with those of emery ore samples from different localities. The dark-green schistose material used for the axes compares well with the diaspore- and chloritoid-rich type of emery from Naxos. Other emery deposits are richer in haematite and magnetite, diaspore being a more or less constant component. With sufficient knowledge about the individual emery deposits, it would probably be possible to trace down the different types of axe-material to a specific locality. In any case, emery ore seems to be an unusual but very convenient material for axes, being both hard and tough. Some examples of emery ore, for example the diaspore-chloritoid-rich types, also exhibit a pronounced lamination, resulting in a useful initial splitting. As is seen in plate lvii, b, this rock exhibits intergrowth of ore with the other transparent particles; grain sizes range from o-oi to 0*05 mm. This intergrowth and the fineness in grain-size contribute to the strength of this rock. 1 Rocks consisting mainly of olivine or pyroxene and their alterations, such as serpentinite, are generally called ultra- mafic. Usually they are light- to dark-green in appearance. 2 Compositions and properties are listed in Table 24. 3 Emery originates by the alteration of bauxite deposits during regional metamorphism. A small emery outcrop on Paros (not visited by the author) is indicated on the geo- logical map of Greece.</page><page sequence="134">100 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS The axes made of ultramafic rocks (also named ophiolites or roches vertes) consist of two different materials. The one (Small Find no. 54) is made of ordinary serpentinite rock; the other (no. 8) consists of a fairly fresh pyroxene-rock with interstitial ore particles (plate lvii, c). As may be seen in the photograph, this is also a fine-grained rock with grain-size up to ο·ΐ mm. It has a texture of interlocking grains which contributes considerably to its toughness. Serpenti- nized ultramafic rocks occur at several places on Eastern Paros and also on Naxos. But it is not entirely certain that the material for axe no. 8 originates in these regions. This investigation shows, in the author's opinion, that the inhabitants of Saliagos chose the raw materials for their axes with care, and took the trouble to go to Eastern Naxos, some 30 miles away, to provide themselves with raw materials. Efforts have been made to determine the nature of a few other mineral substances found during the excavations at Saliagos. A mineral-aggregate with black lustre (from Square R3 L6) consists entirely of calcite, containing as inclusions within the crystals so many particles of iron oxide (or manganese oxide) as to make it an opaque substance with black lustre. Similar calcite is found in the abandoned manganese mine of Agios Konstantinos on the eastern coast of Anti- paros. The mineral itself is a mineralogical peculiarity, and there is little doubt that the ex- cavated material originates from this particular source. Another sample (from Square T2 L3) consists of a light grey clayish material containing a mixture of finely divided materials such as feldspars, pyroxenes, and micas. Most probably it is a volcanic tuff from Antiparos. In any case it does not resemble kaolinite, bentonite, or white siliceous clays from Melos, as had been thought possible. In the author's opinion both the black and the white material have a low value as a ceramic or colouring material. TABLE 24. THE MINERALOGIG AL COMPOSITION OF THE ROCKS ANALYSED Sp.

THE GEOLOGY OF THE ANTIPAROS ISLAND GROUP (Based on Anastopoulos (1963) and the writer's own observations.) Geologically and tectonically the area forms part of the Attico-Cycladic Massif and consists mainly of crystalline and volcanic rocks. The more recent sediments of tertiary and quaternary age are very limited in extent. The crystalline metamorphic rocks predominate and comprise interbedded gneisses, schists, and marbles. The gneisses contain muscovite and biotite, are well foliated and grade into schists which may be micaceous, chlorite- or talc-bearing, or contain chlorite, epidote, and actinolite. The marbles, commonly white or grey, may be dolomitic or ankeritic and in places silicified. At the far north end of Antiparos is a series of small lenses of black to grey fossiliferous micro- crystalline limestone from which M. Reichel has described Productus sp. (Permian), Bryozoa (Fistulipora or Dybowskiella, Permian) and Foraminifera of the family Pachyploia (Permian). It is concluded that the whole metamorphic formation was originally sediments of Permian age. Some time between the Permian and the Pliocene they were subjected to fairly low-grade regional metamorphism, recrystallizing to the variety of rock types mentioned above. These rocks are cut by numerous quartz veins probably originating from silica mobilized from the surrounding rocks at the time of the metamorphism. The tertiary sediments are interbedded sandstones, marly sandstones, and conglomerates covering a very small area in the south-east of the Island. They contain Pliocene fossils. The igneous rocks are all volcanic comprising massive porphyritic or brecciated rhyolitic lavas, thin welded tuffs, and abundant pyroclastic debris (ashes, bombs, lapilli, etc.), together with subordinate perlite and obsidian. The latter are glasses formed by rapid cooling of a very siliceous lava: perlite is characterized by numerous concentric fractures and a higher water content than obsidian from which it probably forms by hydration. Both occur as blocks in the tuff or as lava flows of limited areal extent. Spherulitic de-vitrification is common. The lavas are alkaline in affinity and contain biotite : they overlie the Pliocene sediments and are overlain by the lowest alluvial deposit. They show in addition quite advanced weathering and degrada- tion of volcanic structures and are thus concluded to be of Pliocene age. They form the whole of the south-east peninsula of Antiparos and outcrop on Despotiko and Strongilo in the south- west and on Kavouras to the north. Alluvial and diluvial deposits - partly consolidated sands, gravels, breccias, and calcareous sandstones - occur over various parts of the island to a thickness of 50 metres. The marine terrace deposit described in Section 2 (below) has been assigned to the Pleistocene. Other less well consolidated representatives are undoubtedly younger still. Mineralization related to the late stages of the volcanic activity has given rise to various ore deposits notably: 1. Vein deposits of lead, zinc, iron, and copper-iron sulphides in the Prassovounia and A. Georgios regions.</page><page sequence="136">102 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS 2. Replacement deposits of manganese oxides in the marble at 'Manganies'. 3. Replacement deposits of iron oxides in the marbles of the Kaki Skala area. 4. A deposit of the zinc ore calamine, in marbles near A. Elias. These are all now effectively worked out but evidently provided quite a substantial supply of material in the past. The three islands Naxos, Paros, and Antiparos are closely related geologically, many of the rocks found on one could equally have come from either of the other two. Principal exceptions are the volcanics of Antiparos, the foliated granite mass of Northern Naxos, and the corundum- bearing emeries of East Naxos. 2. NOTE ON THE GEOLOGY OF SALIAGOS (FIG. 25) The island is composed of marble covered with a variable thickness of a heterogeneous calcareous deposit which in turn has a soil-cover. The marble is exposed all round the coast in a strip between about one and ten metres in width, and also to a very limited extent inland. Light-coloured marbles predominate (white, with light brown and greys, totalling c. 70 per cent), dark-grey and black marbles account for the remainder of the rock exposed. The marbles are commonly banded. Gentle flexures are present as indicated by the variable attitudes of the bedding planes shown on the sketch-map. Dips (estimated) never exceed about 20 deg. Some faults are undoubtedly present but their precise nature and trend were difficult to determine from the restricted area of exposure. The marble is evidently the same as that exposed elsewhere on Antiparos (including immediately opposite the island) and from the evidence of fossils found at the north end of Antiparos itself, is a metamorphosed Permian limestone. The upper surface of the marble is irregular, varying quite rapidly in places between just below and about one and a half metres above sea level. Except where mentioned above, it is covered with a calcareous 'breccia' composed of angular fragments of marble (and very rarely other rocks) set in a buff-coloured matrix of small calcite fragments, re-crystallized calcite and in places small fossils, principally non-marine gastropods. The rock may be all matrix in places. It is evidently a relatively recent terrestrial deposit (perhaps Pliocene or Pleistocene) laid down on an erosion surface of marble sub-parallel, and thus presumably related, to the present sea level. Similar deposits are common elsewhere in Greece, particularly in the Cyclades, forming coastal platforms on marble, or at the foot of hill-slopes of marble (e.g. North Syros). The pre- cise conditions of deposition are not clear : torrential rain producing rapid transport of eroded debris from higher to lower ground in an area of exposed marbles or limestones, followed by cementation of the resulting aggregate largely by the action of carbonate-bearing water, would be a reasonable explanation. The toughness of this rock seems to vary from that of a friable soil to that of concrete accord- ing to the conditions of exposure. Thus, when dry and exposed to sun and air permanently, it is hard; likewise where it is exposed to wave action and the sun intermittently, it is also tough. When freshly exposed beneath a moist soil-cover, however, it is quite soft. These observations seem to be in accordance with those on similar deposits in other parts of the world that have come to the writer's notice. The setting of this deposit involves exposure to water, probably necessarily hard, followed by prolonged drying out or perhaps, alternatively, exposure to highly saline water - or even repetition of these processes. One can safely conclude that at an earlier stage, in a cooler, wetter environment the deposit would quite likely have been much less tough than it is today. No direct inferences can be drawn from these suggested setting processes either about past climatic conditions or even about the past state of the deposits, merely that</page><page sequence="137">- 1 fe C t&gt; Ε F Gj H J - _^ J , ! , , ! , j- - _^ . 12- banded black, end white warble [ &gt; u veined «iartt^~N / ' X .

PETROLOGIGAL NOTES ON THE SMALL FINDS (a) Independent X-ray and microscopic investigation of the reddish-black rock M. 13, similar in appearance to axes 31, 233 and many others has confirmed the analysis of Dr. Oosterom. The writer is in complete agreement with Dr. Oosterom's interpretation of his results and his conclusions. (b) The rubbers 40, 56, 91, 145, 150, and 202-4 are all composed of a coarse muscovite- biotite-gneiss or foliated granite. This rock was not found on Antiparos where its equivalents are more schistose but can be matched with a large foliated granite mass exposed to the west and north of Naxos town. (c) τ5&gt; 59? and 167 are all flint or chert - cryptocrystalline silica. They could very probably have come from Antiparos itself or from almost any of the neighbouring islands. (d) The green pendant (no. 141, plate xliv, 2) has the specific gravity and appearance of nephritic jade, a pale-green compact variety of the amphibole tremolite (a silicate of calcium and magnesium). Its provenance is uncertain. The islands of Syros and Siphnos are more likely sources than the Naxos-Paros-Antiparos group. The material is sufficiently uncommon for it to have come possibly from a very much greater distance, even though the metamorphic rocks with which it might be associated occur not far from Antiparos. These observations are very tentative as it was not possible to make a thorough pétrographie examination. (e) 97 (plate xlvii, 9) is pumice, almost certainly from Thera, from where it probably floated. (/) I57? a rounded lump of quartz-felspar porphyry, and 129, fine-grained granite, almost certainly came from outside the island group, but from where is not known. (g) The various worked and unworked pieces of marble (e.g. 21, spindle-whorl, 109, sche- matic figurine, 170, polisher, etc.) could have come from any of the Cyclades with the exception of Mykonos and Milos, or from very many places on the mainland.</page><page sequence="139">APPENDIX IV. THE SOURCES OF THE SALIAGOS OBSIDIAN j. R. g Ann and j. ε. DixoN, Department of Mineralogy and Petrology, University of Cambridge, and a. c. Renfrew, Department of Ancient History, University of Sheffield There are four known sources of workable obsidian in the Aegean, two, at Adhamas and Dhemenegaki on the island of Melos, 60 km. south-west of Antiparos, one on the island of Giali near Nisyros about 180 km. east of Antiparos, and the fourth on Antiparos itself (Renfrew, Cann, and Dixon, 1965). Obsidian from the two sources on Melos is the most widespread in the Aegean region, being found already in places as far apart as Crete, Southern Greece, Thessaly, and even Macedonia in early Neolithic times. That from Giali, notable rather for the large size of its blocks than for its good quality, was used principally in Late Minoan times, and worked objects or fragments of the raw material have been found in Crete, in Kea (op. cit., p. 240) and in Naxos.1 In Neolithic times it was already being used in the Aspripetra Cave in Kos (Levi, 1925-6, 279). The obsidian found at the source on Antiparos is in the form of small rounded lumps, usually too small for the manufacture of tools, and thus it appears to have been little used in the past. A few pieces of obsidian of appearance and trace-element content different from that of any of the Aegean obsidians have been found in Crete. It is believed that these are from the source at Çiftlik in South Anatolia which also supplied Pre-pottery Neolithic Jericho, early Mersin, and the Levantine coast. This is the only source contributing obsidian to the Aegean from outside that area, and the quantity involved is very small. The characteristics which enable the Aegean sources to be distinguished from one another are discussed by Renfrew, Cann, and Dixon (1965). Briefly, Melian obsidian is characterized by its appearance, having a pearly-grey lustre, though some is distinctively mottled in red and black, and by its trace-element content, with high barium and low zirconium, which fits it into Group 1 of the classification. That from Giali is much more transparent and black in reflected light, while it always contains white spots (spherulites) that are very distinctive. Its trace- element content is similar to that of the Melian obsidian, making distinction on this basis not altogether certain, but in general barium is higher and strontium and particularly calcium lower than for the material from Melos. The small round pebbles of obsidian from Antiparos have a black shiny appearance and lack spherulites, while the trace-element content is quite distinctive, with low barium and low zirconium, which puts it into Group 3b. The obsidian found at Saliagos is almost exclusively of Melian appearance; out of 24,000 pieces examined fewer than 50 lacked the characteristic lustre. Two waste flakes with the typical Melian lustre were selected for trace-element analysis (cf. Cann and Renfrew, 1964), and both specimens (analysis nos. 208 and 209 of Table 25) were found to belong to Group 1, thus confirming their origin in Melos. Another specimen with the red and black mottled appear- ance occasionally found in Melos was also analysed (no. 351) and also proved to belong to Group 1 with a trace-element content typical of Melian obsidians. 1 A large lump of unworked Giali obsidian, weighing 4,350 gm., was found in 1965 by Mr. Petros Frangiskos on the shore by the Early Cycladic and Mycenean settlement at Grotta in Naxos. It is now in the Naxos museum.</page><page sequence="140">Ιθ6 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS A number of small round pebbles found stratified at the site had the black shiny appearance characteristic of obsidian from Antiparos, and there were also a few waste flakes and a single artefact with secondary working (fig. 70. 4) of similar appearance. Two such samples were analysed (nos. 210 and 211) and were found to fall within Group 3b, thus making their attribution to Antiparos certain, as no other source in the Mediterranean region has such a composition.

Two other specimens proved to have a trace-element composition appropriate for an origin in Antiparos (nos. 213 and 214). They were selected for analysis because of their very trans- parent, colourless nature which suggested that they might come from the South Anatolian source from which a few pieces reached Crete. However, they belong to Group 3b, not Group 2b, and thus they must certainly be ascribed to the Antiparos source. Three or four of the waste flakes examined had an appearance that suggested Giali as a source; they were fairly transparent and contained small white spherulites. One of these flakes was analysed (no. 212) and, while belonging to Group 1, proved to have a barium content higher and a strontium and particularly a calcium content lower than is usual for obsidian from Melos, another indication of origin in Giali. Taken together, the appearance and the trace-element content make it almost certain that these few pieces are derived from the Giali source. It should be emphasized in conclusion that an overwhelming majority of the pieces of obsidian found on Saliagos must be attributed to the sources of Adhamas and Dhemenegaki on Melos.</page><page sequence="141">APPENDIX IV. THE SOURCES OF THE SALIAGOS OBSIDIAN 107 The small number of pieces that can be ascribed to near-by Antiparos is convincing circum- stantial evidence that, as had been previously surmised (Renfrew, Cann, and Dixon, 1965), the source in Antiparos was insignificant in supplying obsidian for tool making. Of considerable interest is the recognition at Saliagos of obsidian from Giali. Although fewer than five such pieces were found in a total of more than 24,000 examined, the find is of importance, demon- strating as it does contact between the Cyclades and the islands off the Anatolian coast at the time of the Saliagos culture.</page><page sequence="142">APPENDIX V. SOIL SAMPLES FROM SALIAGOS From analyses and notes by i. w. Cornwall, Institute of Archaeology, London Twenty samples of soil were selected during the excavations at Saliagos as typical of the various levels encountered during the excavation. These were submitted to Dr. I. W. Cornwall of the Institute of Archaeology, London, and his comments, based on the results of his analyses, are given below following a description of the context from which each sample was taken. SAMPLES TAKEN FROM LEVELS UNDERLYING THE CULTURAL LAYERS A. Bed-rock from the lowest levels of Square K3. Hard greenish- white rock, matrix for the conglomerate (which contains marble, etc.). Comment: Travertine-like secondarily calcified limestone, almost pure. Only a small proportion of acid-insoluble siliceous residue. ? Subsoil, formed by percolation of calcium-bearing water and evaporation in summer? B. Bed-rock from the lowest levels of Square K3B. Reddish clay - such clayey deposit is un- common on the site. Comment: Typical limestone terra fusca, found in hollows and fissures where uneroded in ancient surface. Probably the product of weathering in and since the Tertiary, now relict. Mass of clay-iron colloids with only the residue of limestone included. C. Bed-rock from the lowest levels of Square S4. White, soft, and therefore not rocklike, seen over much of the site below the cultural layers. Comment: Decayed limestone? in situ with soil in cracks. Cf. Sample E. D. Red-brown soil overlying the bed-rock and between conglomerate stones in the Cliff Section and probably natural. It is often found in a very thin layer above the conglomerate bed-rock and immediately below the cultural layers. Comment: Calcareous red soil with needle- like crystals of infiltrated gypsum in quantity. Limestone bits. Considerable siliceous residue, mostly quartz and schist fragments. Much red clay but not colloidal - flocculated by the gyp- sum. Formed in sub-arid conditions, otherwise the gypsum would have been washed out. REMAINS OF FLOORING, ETC. E. From Square S4 L8. Chalky-looking crumbly white fragments along the line of a floor level, probably used for flooring and for bedding the stones of the wall. It appears whiter and more chalky than some earlier floors, e.g. Sample G. Comment: Chalky, limestone ccompo' Less than 30 per cent acid insolubles. Contains casts of grass-stems and leaves. Might be artificial, e.g. limestone wall-plaster of naturally secondarily calcified subsoil layer of rotten limestone. Less humus than Sample C, but basically the same substance. Both phosphate and sulphate (gypsum) present. F. From Square S4 L8. Chalky white fragments, hard and compact, forming well-defined floor 1-2 cm. thick. An extension of the same floor as Sample E. Comment: Harder than Sample E, with secondary cementing by infiltrated calcite. G. From Square S3 L8. Thick white floor level (5 cm.), within 1 m. of the present sea-erosion surface of the cliff. Comment : Much red clay in acid-insolubles, suggests weathered subsoil like Samples Ε and C. Lots of phosphate, with gypsum too. Occupied weathered surface?</page><page sequence="143">APPENDIX V. SOIL SAMPLES FROM SALIAGOS 109 H. From Square S4 L9. A deposit of small pebbles found within the area of House E, lying between the floor levels which mark the base of L8 and L9. Comment: Fine gravel /coarse sand of limestone, quartz, mica-schist particles. Fairly well rounded below 2 mm. diam., above 6 mm. quite angular. Stream-rolled. Imported or in situ? SUSPECTED PISÉ REMAINS I. From Square S4 L7. A large mass of brown soil with few stones or sherds. Collected as a possible weathering and decomposition product of unbaked mud-brick walling. Comment: Badly sorted, silty, strongly calcareous sand, with bits of calcium-cemented micaceous sand- stone and marine shell. There is only a small clay-fraction, i.e. the sample is not very cohesive. Plenty of root-holes, but only a slight humus content. No evidence, in masses, of foreign crumbs or flow structures, as to be expected in daub. Probably not brick or pisé, but rather clean, ? rainwashed subsoil or beach material. Phosphate present. J. From the west face of Square K3. Like Sample I. Comment: Almost identical with Sample I. SOIL FROM UPPERMOST LEVELS K. From Square S4 Li. Topsoil, soft, dark-brown, very fine with few stones, perhaps wind- blown, with many land snails. Comment: Calcareous (mostly shell fragments). Rootlets, crumb- structure, and much humus. Mostly quartz in the sand grades, but some grains with ferruginous cement. Modern soil ?, cf. meridional braunerde (Kubiena). Looks to have been weathered in situ and somewhat decalcified. L. From Square S4 L4. Below topsoil, dark-brown with many more small, often white stones. Harder. Fewer land snails, mostly crushed. Contemporary with tumble of buildings of Phase 3. Comment: Strongly calcareous. Redder. Crumb-structure due to shrinkage cracks. Much less humus than Sample K. The white stones are limestone. No foreign bodies such as charcoal. Phosphate present. Could be a habitation deposit, but looks much more like a natural soil with possible occupation at its surface. SOIL FROM LOWER LEVELS M. From Square S4 Lio. Ordinary medium brown soil below the floor levels at the bottom of Lg and Lio. Comment: Strongly calcareous, very like Sample I. N. From Square S4 Lio. Fine red soil below the base of L9, underlying House E. It exhibits the red colour which is rather common on the lower levels of the site. Comment: Natural soil of parabraunerde /terra fusca type, with root-holes. Product of secular weathering of the limestone in Mediterranean climatic conditions. Recent - not fossil or relict like Sample B. O. Square S4 L12A. Black soil, seemingly burnt, at the base of the section. Comment: Contains plenty of humus, of a dark-brown, not black colour. When this is removed with H2O2 the mineral residue is quite light in colour, without more than a few grains of charcoal. It is not burned at all. It looks like an immature rendsina soil, with acicular crystals of infiltrated gypsum (cf. Sample B). P. From the west face of Square K3. A greenish layer overlying the pit. and traceable along the whole length of the section. Comment: Heterogeneous: full of greyish clay crumbs in redder</page><page sequence="144">HO EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS matrix, ? pisé, daub. Very little humus reduces KMnO4 strongly, so probably ferrous iron present, indicating reducing condition of formation, i.e. exclusion of oxygen. This accounts for the colour in the field, although not now noticeably greenish (re-oxidized since collection) . Q. From the west face of Square K3. A reddish layer overlying that from which Sample Ρ was taken, and running along the section. Comment: Looks like the weathering in situ of Sample P. Some clay crumbs are visible, but also root- and ? worm-holes. Redder than Sample N, and speckled, which Ν is not, but basically similar. Strongly calcareous residual limestone pebbles. Much red clay in acid insolubles. BURNT LEVELS R. From Square T2 L9. Charcoal overlying the second floor of the circular structure G, in burnt deposit. Comment: Carbonized soil with casts and charcoals of plant-remains, ? grasses, and twigs (see Appendix IX). Fires brown when the carbon is burnt out. Daub material only partly fired? S. From the main-building level of Stratum 3 in Square K2. Baked clay, conceivably hearth- lining or house-walling. Comment: Fired clay. ? Daub. Full of plant impressions. One would expect it to have been originally a yellowish clayey material (cf. Samples I, J, M, etc.) with some natural organic matter in the form of humus and possible added chaff or grass. One piece, 2-5 cm. thick, looks like a sherd of a large storage jar; one face is lime-coated - perhaps therefore a water jar. The faces are not parallel, so it probably is not wall-plaster. T. From Square Ki Li 1 . Similar to Sample S. Comment: Fired clay. ? Daub, ? Hearth, ? Oven. Heterogeneous material, like Sample P, containing some clay crumbs fired before incorporation in the mix. Partly fired again since. CONCLUSIONS Dr. Cornwall adds the following general note. 'Nearly all materials are calcareous, some contain visible gypsum crystals, a few are phosphatic. The calcite and gypsum would probably make them harden up considerably on drying. The phosphate probably indicates infiltration of materials of human occupation, but it would need careful quantitative determinations of phosphate on occupation surfaces, compared with soil and bed-rock samples away from the site, to decide which were likely to have been floors and which natural strata. There may, indeed, be appreciable phosphate naturally present in the bed-rock.5 Dr. Cornwall's detailed observations, listed above, seem to lead to several more general con- clusions which are of relevance to our understanding of the site. In the first instance, the material of the bed-rock, essentially limestone and decayed limestone, is made clear. Its tendency to harden on drying is explained. The natural red soil, which in places overlies it, is identified as terra fusca, a limestone weathering product. Since this terra fusca immediately underlies the earliest cultural layers, the observation (in the comment to Sample D) that it was formed in sub-arid conditions is of the highest interest. In the absence of palynological evidence for the climatic sequence in Southern Greece, which will not be available until Dr. Turner completes her researches on the material from Lake Copaïs (cf. Appendix VI), this evidence is the best we have for the climatic conditions just prior to the occupation of the site. It must, however, be interpreted in conjunction with conclusions derived from the faunal remains recovered.</page><page sequence="145">APPENDIX V. SOIL SAMPLES FROM SALIAGOS m The hypothesis that the white flooring, found in many contexts on the site (Samples Ε to G), is simply the soft bed-rock, dug up and relaid at the habitation level, is confirmed. The patches of stoneless brown soil, which seemed during excavation to be the most likely decomposition product of unbaked mud-brick, if pisé was in fact used, do not seem to be the remains of pisé. The conclusion is important, since it seems to eliminate one possible building method, and only the hypotheses of dry-stone walls or of wattle and daub (for which Samples R to Τ perhaps provide evidence) remain. Colour variations in the lower levels are satisfactorily explained. The red colour (e.g. Sample N) is associated with terra fusca, the limestone weathering product. The green tinge in Sample Ρ was apparently the result of reducing conditions, while the dark colour of Sample Ο was due to the presence of humus, not to burning. The greater depth of soil on the site, however, was medium-brown in colour, exemplified by Sample M, as well as I and J. Here Dr. Cornwall points to the rather low humus content, and suggests that the deposit may be rainwashed sub- soil or beach material. However, while analyses may suggest that these deposits, like Sample L, could be natural soil, the stratigraphie circumstances would indicate rather that they are habitation deposits. Both the use of natural soil in house-construction and the clearing of organic material from the dwellings to rubbish pits, like Pits A and B, would tend to reduce the over-all humus content and the proportion of foreign bodies, while numerous sherds and other artefacts were in fact found in these levels.</page><page sequence="146">APPENDIX VI. POLLEN ANALYSIS IN THE GYCLADES: A PRELIMINARY SURVEY judith turner, Department of Botany, University of Durham No pollen diagrams have yet been published from the Cyclades. It would indeed be very interesting to know something of the development of their vegetation : whether, for example, they have always been as barren as they now are, or whether they were once extensively forested. And if the condition was different in the past, what role have climatic changes, and more particularly the early prehistoric cultures of the region, played in modifying the primeval vegetation? If the vegetational history can be elucidated, as it has been in NW. Europe, then the possibility arises of referring various culture layers to the stages in this sequence, thus pro- viding data on the changing environment during occupation of the area. And if critical vege- tational horizons like the celm decline' of NW. Europe were found, then one might be able to date the corresponding cultural horizons with an accuracy comparable to that of radiocarbon dating. It was with these possibilities in mind that sites with deposits potentially suitable for pollen analysis, in both the Cyclades and the near-by mainland, were visited in August 1964. 1. NAXOS Four small lagoons, all near the sea, were visited. 1 . At Akrotiri Ammitis, north-east of the town of Naxos. 2. At Kastraki. 3. At Aliko. 4. Three lagoons at Ayios Prokopls. Borings were made at each. None contained fresh-water deposits suitable for pollen analysis. 2. mélos Two lagoons at Livatholimni were visited, with the same negative results as at Naxos. 3. DELOS: THE SACRED LAKE This lake was covered with a metre of rubble earlier this century as it was then a mosquito breeding den. In the centre, however, is a narrow shaft, at the bottom of which, beneath a few inches of rubble, are soft muds. Samples of these were collected by means of a small Hiller borer to a depth of 80 cm. Below this the borer would not penetrate. On examination these samples were found to contain minute quantities of pollen. For example, the sample at 25 cm. contained: 2 grains of Pinus pollen. 2 grains of Cyperaceae pollen. 2 grains of Compositae. 2 grains of Plantago lanceolata pollen. 5 grains - unknown type A. 5 grains - unknown type B.</page><page sequence="147">APPENDIX VI. POLLEN ANALYSIS IN THE CYGLADES 113 The lake was revisited in April 1965 with heavier boring equipment. This again failed to penetrate deeper than 80 cm. There can be little doubt that the deposits are only 80 cm. deep and that they do not predate the construction of the Sacred Lake. The scarcity of pollen and the short period represented make this site unsuitable for constructing a general vegetational sequence, though it might contain pollen-grains of interest in relation to Delos itself. 4. ANTIPAROS The lagoon behind the village of Antiparos had no fresh- water deposits suitable for pollen analysis. 5. SALIAGOS Samples for pollen analysis were collected from the following layers : Y 1 : charcoal layer, L16. K3 L36A, overlying white bed-rock. K3 L36A, blue clay immediately above preceding. 0 1 L72 lower layer of infill of Pit B. 0 1 L72 upper layer of infill of Pit B. None of these samples contained pollen. 6. LAKE COPAÏS, BOEOTIA This extensive lake, near Thebes, reputed to have been drained in Mycenean times, is now productive agricultural land. In places, however, peat and lake-mud deposits are exposed in the banks of channels. These are suitable for pollen analysis and samples to a depth of 4 metres were collected for a preliminary investigation. Unless too much peat has been removed from the surface this sequence of samples should provide details of the vegetational changes of the prehistoric period. Critical levels could be radiocarbon dated. Lake Copais is a long way from Saliagos, but unless a nearer site is found in the future it should prove the best guide to the vegetational history of Southern Greece and the adjoining islands. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Dr. Colin Renfrew selected the sites to be visited and arranged many of the practical details. I should like to thank Mr. Dino Gallis and Mr. Charles Turner for their invaluable assistance in the field, Mr. Kouyeas, Professor Niavis, Professor Dimaliopoulos, and Mr. P. Papakostan- tinou for their kindness in helping to arrange the visit to Lake Copai's, and the Botany School, University of Cambridge, for travelling expenses to Greece. C 4316 I</page><page sequence="148">APPENDIX VIL SALIAGOS ANIMAL BONES ε. s. higgs, Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge, I. M. CLEGG, and I. A. KINNES In considering the animal bones from Saliagos it must be remembered that their identification is based upon a preliminary sorting carried out during excavations and that a comparative collection was not available for specific determination. The determinations therefore must be regarded as tentative, but the general conclusions are based upon a numerical analysis in which some confidence can be placed. The animal bones and bone fragments from the site numbered 16,427; 11,030 of these were of animals of cow size (3*5 per cent), of sheep or pig size (93*5 per cent), or of 'dog size5 (3 per cent). Of the diagnostic bones 3-5 per cent were determined as of bovines, 83-5 per cent of caprines and 12-1 per cent of pig; 0-9 per cent were bones of canids. It is therefore apparent that bone breakage did not materially affect the relative proportions of the animals represented by the diagnostic bones. The skeletal parts appear to be fully represented and there are no notable absences which might be accounted for by the use of a particular bone for a particular purpose. The femur is less well represented than it should be, but this is a usual occurrence in archaeological assemblages of all periods and is no doubt due to differences in durability. Dense bones and dense parts of bones such as the astragalus and the distal end of the humérus are as usual well represented. THE CAPRINI The sheep /goat bones could be of the wild bezoar (Capra aegagrus,) domestic goat, mouflon, or domestic sheep. Capra aegagrus is still extant in the Greek islands and the mouflon is still existing in Cyprus. In the past there have been unverified reports of the presence of mouflon on the Greek mainland and islands. Certainly at Saliagos there is a scimitar horned goat which may be of the bezoar or of the domestic goat group and also sheep horn-cores of mouflon type. Ibex, which has been reported from Greece, can probably in this instance be discounted. The ibex interbreeds with Capra aegagrus and the two species are unlikely to exist side by side. Such an occurrence has been postulated from the Lebanon but presumably here there may have been two different environments, a circumstance which is hardly likely to occur in the small area of these islands. The fragmented sheep horn-cores could be of mouflon or of a mouflon-type domestic sheep. The ages of the sheep /goat group at death, however, is informative. By the fusion of the epiphyses of the long bones and by the dentition 40-4 per cent of the ageable specimens were of immature animals. Epiphyseal fusion, however, takes place at different ages for different bones, for some as early as 10 months of age. In comparison, therefore, with other published collections where the proportion of immature specimens is assessed on the dentition only, where maturity is at 2 years, the figure of 59-6 per cent of mature animals is heavily weighted in their favour. The figure of 40*4 per cent may be compared with 60 per cent for domestic sheep at Shanidar and 25 per cent at Haua Fteah. The Haua Fteah figure is, however, owing to the presence of Barbary sheep, weighted in favour of mature animals. It may be taken that the figure of 40-4 per</page><page sequence="149">APPENDIX VII. SALIAGOS ANIMAL BONES II5 cent of immature animals at Saliagos strongly suggests the presence of domestic animals at that site. It would also appear that the high proportion of young animals killed indicates that the emphasis of the economy was on meat production, not on that of milk or wool. The only bones known to be from a wool-producing economy are those from medieval Upton (Higgs and Yealland, 1966), where there were only 3 per cent of immature animals in the collection. In this connection a comparison with Haua Fteah in Cyrenaica and Nea Nicomedeia in Greece is of some interest. At Saliagos the bones of the sheep /goat group are smaller than the similar group at Haua Fteah. This is shown in fig. 26 and fig. 27, which indicate the relative sizes of the calcaneum and the astragalus at these sites. It is evident that the measurements of the Saliagos bones are much closer to those of Nea Nicomedeia than to those of the North African specimens. This probably indicates a closer contact with the European mainland than with North Africa and that the regular interchange of breeding stock between Saliagos and North Africa was not taking place. It is possible to put forward the hypothesis either that the im- mediate origin of the North African flocks was different from that of the flocks of the European mainland, or that the human demands for sheep/goat products were, by reason of a different way of life of the people concerned, of a different nature. It would seem hardly likely that differences in the environment of these two areas would account for the observed osteological differences. In considering Saliagos and Nea Nicomedeia, the similarities are more informative. In spite of the time span between the two sites there is no evidence that specialized breeding had changed the conformation, variability, or size of the sheep /goats, or that a change in human demand, such as that shown later by the Athenians and in Anatolia, had as yet begun. THE BOVINES A recent report (Coles, Coutts, and Ryder, 1964) is a reminder that the presence of bison cannot be excluded as a possibility in the consideration of bones from Neolithic assemblages, and the same may be said of buffalo in sites from Eastern Europe. This is not an easy matter to decide in the absence of horn-cores but in recent years publications by Bibikova in Russia, Stampfli in Switzerland, and Olsen in America are of some assistance. On their criteria it can be said that in all probability the majority of the bovine long bones from Saliagos are either of Bos primigenius or of domestic cattle. One horn-core of Bos primigenius type was certainly present. In this connection the size of the bovine bones is of importance but unfortunately the measur- able specimens are too few to provide a statistical sample. The situation is yet more difficult owing to the large size of early domesticated cattle, and the fact that there is an overlap in size between the females οι Bos primigenius and the males of early domesticated cattle. Nor can it be inferred that at a later date cattle would have been domesticated, for Bökönyi has shown that domestication took place in Hungary up to the invasion of the Tartars, although Dr. C. W. F. Higham's1 evidence from Switzerland suggests that in colonizing a new area the Neolithic peoples took with them their cattle already domesticated rather than relying upon the domes- tication of indigenous stocks. In general Table 26 shows that the bovine bones are within the size range of Bos primigenius. On the other hand 68-6 per cent (24 specimens) of the total ageable bovine bones are of immature animals and some of the bovine bones are smaller than those of Bos primigenius. The most likely interpretation is that they are of cattle to some degree removed, but not very far, from their wild 1 Verbal communication based on data in an unpublished Ph.D. thesis.</page><page sequence="150">35 - 3O- ++ . .+ 2 ; . * €k ί -t-"1"*· "*" AMMOTRAGUS 2 25- . * Θ , + + + RANGE OF LENGTH z : 0 &lt;% · ® · · · 4. ι 1 " !

It is possible to consider that this may be an area which was being colonized by the Neolithic peoples and that the wild cattle were being incorporated into an existing herd : but unfortunately the data are not sufficient to pursue this further. PIGS Fifty-one per cent (101 specimens) of the ageable pig bones were immature in so far as the epiphyses were unfused and the dentition was immature. In addition there were no teeth which indicated any great age for the pig population. As at Nea Nicomedeia, the pig appears to have been of some importance at Saliagos in contrast to Haua Fteah where no pig-remains were in evidence until classical times. It may be that this difference is due to a different way of life of the Haua Fteah cave population from that of the people of Saliagos and Nea Nicomedeia with their house structures and at least partially sedentary way of life. The pig is sometimes herded by transhumant populations, but is not naturally adapted to a nomadic way of life. GANIDS There were some 50 specimens of canids but none could with certainty be attributed to dog. Nor has the dog been recognized at Haua Fteah or Nea Nicomedeia. It would appear likely that domestication had already gone as far as specialized breeding by Amratian times in Egypt. The presence of the goat makes it unlikely that a herding dog would be used. Goats usually withstand the dog and their presence commonly prevents sheep- or goat-herding in this fashion. There is, as we have seen, little or no evidence for hunting and the dog would hardly add a use- ful contribution to the abundant animal protein. There remains only the usefulness of the dog as a guard. WILD ANIMALS The mouflon, Capra aegagrus, and Bos primigenius may have been present but there is no certain evidence for them. No deer bones were recognized although these animals were almost certainly present on the island. The Canid bones contained fox. This appears to be the only wild animal certainly present.</page><page sequence="152">APPENDIX VIII. THE FISH-BONES j. m. Renfrew, New Hall, Cambridge, p. h. greenwood, and p. j. whitehead, British Museum {Natural History) During the excavations in the 1964 and 1965 seasons at Saliagos 2,945 fish-bones were recovered. These have been identified with the collaboration of Dr. P. H. Greenwood and Mr. P. J. Whitehead of the British Museum (Natural History), from photographs and notes taken in Antiparos by Mrs. J. M. Renfrew. The remains belong to four main families of bony fishes : Scombriodae (mackerel and tuna- like fishes), Sparidae (sea breams), Serranidae (sea perches), Carangidae (jacks and horse mackerel), and also include remains of cartilaginous fishes, either shark or ray. SGOMBRIODAE Remains of these fishes were the most numerous in the collection and accounted for 97 per cent of the fish-bones identified. Among these, vertebrae, hypurals (caudal finray supports), pterygiophores (finray supports), and a premaxilla were identified. The premaxilla, an articu- lated caudal fin, and a selection of vertebrae are illustrated in plate lix, 5, 6, 7. Table Β gives the numbers of each type of bone found. It is estimated from the size of the vertebrae found that these fish were from two to six feet in length. The size suggests that they were either tunny ( Thunnus thynnus) or albacore ( Thunnus alalunga) . The tunny is one of the most important food fishes in the Mediterranean, and has been known from the earliest times. The albacore, which may account to a greater or lesser extent for these bones, is less well known and regrettably we know far less about its biology. In all phases at Saliagos scombrid bones were the most numerous of those recovered. SPARIDAE Other fish were also used for food. The sparids are represented only by premaxillae (plate lix, 4) and isolated molariform teeth. These are typical of Chrysophrys aurata (Cuvier), the Gilthead. They probably belong to fishes from twelve to eighteen inches in length. At Saliagos they are represented in all phases except the second. SERRANIDAE The serranids are represented by vertebrae and a dentary (plate lix, 2) and the size of the bones suggests the largest of the Mediterranean serranids Epinephalus gigas (Brunnich), and may have come from a fish three to four feet in length. The serranids are the only fishes not repre- sented in the early well-preserved deposit in Pit A, but are found elsewhere in the Neolithic deposit in all phases, albeit in small numbers. GARANGIDAE The carangids are next in numerical importance to the scombrids and account for 1 -5 per cent of the total identified fish-bones. They occur in all phases (see Table 27) and are represen- ted by vertebrae, quadrates, and a dentary. The morphology and size of these bones suggest that</page><page sequence="153">APPENDIX VIII. THE FISH-BONES II9 either Seriola Dumerilii (Risso), the amberjack, or Lichia glauca is represented. The fishes were probably about four and a half feet long. SHARK OR RAY Vertebrae from a cartilaginous fish, either a shark or a ray, were recovered from Pit A and from a stratum of Phase 2. One of the two from Pit A seems to have been split, smoothed, and perforated to form a bead {vide supra, p. 14, and plate xlvi, 2). The largest of these vertebrae could have come from a fish four to five feet in length. Besides these remains of different fishes, traces of other marine animals came to light in the excavation. CETACEAN REMAINS From Square Vi L3 came a vertebra of a cetacean, and another larger vertebra was recovered from the Phase- 1 deposit in Square Oi L72. This larger one was thought to have belonged to pilot or killer whale, but Dr. Fraser of the British Museum (Natural History) writes that cit is impossible to give a specific identification, and so we have to leave it that it is certainly a ceta- cean but could have come from several different kinds of smaller whale, say 15-20 feet'. It is not possible to say whether these two vertebrae come from the same whale, but it would seem un- likely that two whales were stranded close to the settlement at Saliagos. It is improbable that the whale was actually caught, and the animal is much more likely to have been stranded close to the settlement and chopped up into pieces of manageable size and taken back for food. The absence of distinctive whales' teeth in the deposit at Saliagos supports this suggestion. TURTLE REMAINS Another unusual find is the femur of a loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) from Square T2 (plate lix, 8). This species feeds on molluscs and fish, and the female lays her eggs in sandy beaches which she visits at night. She is then most easily captured. There, is, however, no record of loggerhead turtle breeding in the Mediterranean. Both the turtle and its eggs are edible. DISCUSSION Several interesting points arise from the study of the fish-remains from Saliagos. Perhaps the most striking is the overwhelming preponderance of tunny fish. Since there are 39 vertebrae, excluding hypurals, in an individual tunny, it is possible on this basis to calculate roughly that the vertebrae recovered on this site are from a minimum of 65 tunny fish, 48 of them coming from Pit A (sieved deposits). They are between 2 and 6 feet in length, and if it is borne in mind that a five-foot tunny can weigh up to 800 Ib., this represents a substantial weight of food. Their numbers, their occurrence in all phases on the site, and the weight of food represented, all suggest that they were deliberately caught for food, and were not the result of fortuitous strandings as at first seemed likely. Fishing for tunny is not an easy occupation : nowadays they are caught off the Italian coast in specially designed nets, or angled for, often with two men to a rod strapped to the side of a boat. At Saliagos there was no evidence offish-hooks at all. A series of waisted weights, however, might have been used as net sinkers, and nets could have been made of leather to stand the strain of these heavy fish. The tunny are present, on migration, in the Aegean from January to April and may have been driven into shallow water by a series of boats and nets, and caught by clubbing or shooting with arrows tipped with obsidian points.</page><page sequence="154">120 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS The tunny would have been a seasonal food as they are difficult to preserve by drying, being rather oily. The scombrids are represented by vertebrae, hypurals, and finrays with only one premaxilla. The teeth are so small (illustrated in plate lix, 5) that they may have been missed in the course of excavation : they would pass through the mesh of most sieves. In seven cases articulated fins, especially caudal fins, were recovered (plate lix, 6). Tunny are known from other sites in the Aegean : Virchow identified tunny, shark, and ray from the fish-bone remains at Troy (Schliemann, 1884, 349; Vickery, 1936, 74). They formed an important part of the diet of Classical times in both Greece and Italy. The size of the other fish caught, quite apart from the tunny, is remarkable. The serranids (sea perches) were three to four feet long, the carangids (jacks and horse mackerel) four and a half feet long, and the shark or ray four to five feet long, suggesting again that the inhabitants of Saliagos were very skilful fishermen. There are few remains of smaller fish, with the exception of the sparids (sea bream), twelve to eighteen inches in length and recognized only from their premaxillae and large molariform teeth (plate lix, 4). This is probably due to the conditions of preservation, but it is interesting to note that the smallest bones which were recovered were the finrays, pterygiophores, and hypurals of tunny. TABLE 27.

This pattern persists through all phases of the site. There may have been extensive</page><page sequence="155">APPENDIX VIII. THE FISH-BONES 121 fishing for smaller fish of which we have found no trace, but it seems the inhabitants were using nets and arrows with which to catch their fish rather than fish-hooks. Their skill and success in fishing is shown by the number of tunny caught and by the over-all size of the fishes that have been identified from the site. Occasionally the diet was supplemented with turtle (though probably not with turtle eggs as there is no record of loggerhead turtle breeding in the Mediter- ranean) , and also a certain amount of whale meat from at least one whale stranded in the vicinity.</page><page sequence="156">APPENDIX IX. THE MOLLUSCA, THE CRUSTACEA, THE ECHINODERMATA N. j. shackletoNj Sub-Department of Quaternary Research, Cambridge introduction: method of study The Saliagos site has produced a large number of shells, about twenty thousand. In view of their importance they have been given rather more attention than is usual, and this Appendix sets out the more important findings. It was fortunately possible to study the material on the site, during the 1965 excavation season. Often it is necessary that the material be removed for subsequent expert examination, whether in whole or in part, and an understanding of its context and broader setting may be lost. It is hoped that the following comments, although not based on very considerable archaeo- logical experience, may bring the findings to life, so that others with further evidence will interpret them more fully.1 Over most of the site the shell and bone remains were collected, in one or more baskets, for each level of the square being dug. Later all the fragments were washed, and separated into bone and shell. The exception was Cliff 17, Pit A whose contents were washed in the sea in baskets as it was dug out. Fortunately, though the mesh of the baskets was quite coarse, the washing was not carried to excess. As a result the material contained some very small fragments of great interest which would not have been noted if the pit had been dug in the normal way. These fragments include our only record of Sepia and several fish-teeth. As work progressed a type collection of the species noted was built up, and the number of individuals of each type in each level was recorded. In 1964 only a limited number (12) of types was recognized, but most of the seemingly interesting untyped shells were preserved until 1965, so that on the whole the analyses made in the two years are comparable. Nomenclature As far as possible names have been used which are considered valid at present. In addition, without any pretence at a complete synonymy, alternative names are listed where they seem to be used in general works or where they are known to have been used in describing finds from other sites in the region. It is hoped that this will make comparison with other sites easier. Edibility So far as is known there is no objection of inedibility in any of these species, although some seem too small to be worth while harvesting for food. For general interest some evidence has been collected on those which are eaten now. Much of it is drawn from two works concerned with the Adriatic and not the Aegean, by R. Riedl (1963) and G. L. Faber (1883). 1 During the 1964 season the shells were systematically catalogued by Miss Linda Beigel, and the results of her work are incorporated here. We are deeply indebted also to Mr. N. Tebble for providing us with facilities for working at the British Museum (Natural History). Both he and the Revd. H. E. J. Biggs have offered much helpful advice, while the latter in addition was kind enough to identify the land mollusca. Dr. I. Gordon and Mr. R. W. Ingle, also of the British Museum (Natural History), have identified the crab frag- ments, for which we are very grateful. Among the many other people who have helped in this work we would especially name Mr. Peter Norton of the Dept. of Zoology in Glasgow University, who has answered a number of queries.</page><page sequence="157">APPENDIX IX. MOLLUSGA, CRUSTACEA, ECHINODERMATA 123 Utilization So far as was possible every shell was examined for signs of use. This has proved very worth while. We find that much of the abundant shell-debris was put to some use before being finally discarded. For example many Patella (limpet) shells were used as scrapers, perhaps to remove scraps of meat from bones or to clean skins. At least one species, Mytilus galloprovincialis, seems to have been collected exclusively for its decorative value. Furthermore some striking variations in shell-utilization appear during the occupation of the site (see Mytilus galloprovincialis and Charonia lampas below) . Although they may be attributed to a change of fashion in the neighbour- hood rather than to a general advance in culture or technology, they are still of interest and may aid our understanding of the site stratigraphy. In some cases comment has been made in some detail on the technique used in the working of a particular shell. The main generalization which may be made is that apart from hole- boring, most working consists in grinding the shell against a flat plane of stone. When looking around Saliagos today one wonders how anybody could reduce the edge of a mussel to such a smooth and level surface as is seen on the best of our examples from Phase 1. The answer surely lies with the flat schist pebbles, which abound on many of the beaches of Antiparos. SPECIAL DEPOSITS 1. Shells from Cliff 17 Pit A A glance at Table 29 shows that the refuse in this pit, assigned to Phase 1, differs from the remainder of the deposit in many respects. In particular the three most important food species, Patella spp., Monodonta turbinata, and Venerupis aurea, make up 96 per cent of the total, compared with 80 per cent over the rest of the site. It seems very likely that this pit was used as a rubbish pit and that on the whole the inhabitants of the site did not make a habit of throwing away their food refuse in the living area. This means that the bulk of the shell material that we have been considering consists in part of shells left behind during the clearing-up after a meal and in part of shells collected or used for purposes other than as food. At least as regards Phase 1, therefore, this Pit A material may be more representative of day- to-day eating habits. Limpets are dominant; they make up nearly 80 per cent. The site was evidently as rocky then as it is now, and the inhabitants must have spent a fair proportion of their time clambering around the rocks half in the water. Though searching primarily for limpets they collected Monodonta turbinata from the same habitat, and occasionally other species. This pit also yielded several crab claws, sea urchin fragments and spines, and a fragment of cuttlefish guard. All these are less durable than shell and we are fortunate in having found any traces of them. Though the species were probably all eaten it is impossible to estimate their importance in the diet. The Pit A material contains no trace of Area noae, Murex brandaris, Venus verrucosa or of either of the Charonia spp., all of which would be expected if this material were representative of the site as a whole. Area and Venus are very uncommon in Phase 1 in any case, but we must conclude that the other two had some special use. 2. Shell layer in L· L4, etc. On this part of the site a very strange feature emerged. A layer consisting almost entirely of shells covered several square yards. Though it was dug in 1964 it was possible, in 1965, to inspect a portion in section. Here the layer was about 5 cm. thick and consisted almost entirely of</page><page sequence="158">124 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Cerastoderma edule (cockles) . Apart from modern rootlets the soil around the shells was entirely barren, with no sign of animal- or fish-bones. Furthermore it can be seen that the shell deposits form lenses rather than a continuous layer. Each lens must represent the refuse from one meal. Quite a number are meals made of the two sand-burrowing species Venerupis aurea and Cerasto- derma edule. The fact that a 'shell heap' of Patella spp., specially collected by an excavator, should contain only four other shells among 150 limpets causes no surprise; this particular meal was collected from the rocks and not from the sand. In retrospect it seems conceivable that this layer could have yielded more information than it did. One hundred and fifty limpets represent about half a kilogram of meat. If we could have shown that this was typical of the various lenses of food refuse, we could make guesses at the number of people who ate together and at the variability of meals. In at least one deposit the presence of fish-bones very closely intermingled with shells strongly suggests that the meal consisted of both fish and shellfish. Socially these are exciting deposits because they can really be dug as days and not as decades or centuries. TABLE 29. PROPORTIONS OF THE DOMINANT SPECIES, EXPRESSED AS THE NUMBER FOUND PER THOUSAND SHELLS, IN EACH PHASE The last column gives the total number of shells examined in each phase.

Locard (1892) gives a depth range of 2-35 metres, and Riedl (1963) adds the information that it prefers a hard substrate. Riedl (1963) says that Area noae is found frequently in fish-markets around the Adriatic and that it is eaten raw. Faber (1883) tells us that it has a pretty disagreeable flavour and is only eaten by the poor.</page><page sequence="159">APPENDIX IX. MOLLUSCA, CRUSTACEA, ECHINODERMATA 125 Arca noae is often reported from archaeological sites. Tsountas (1899, 105) reports it from one tomb on Paros (Early Bronze Age). It is reported from Aghios Kosmas (Mylonas, 1959, 148) (Early Bronze Age), Thermi (Lamb, 1936 a, 216, Early Bronze Age), Molyvopyrgo (Heurtley, 1939, 89, Early Bronze Age), and Jericho (Biggs, 1963, Neolithic). However, despite its striking shape we have no evidence that the shell has any special significance, and probably we should count it as a source of food. Area (Barbatia) barbata Linné. Fringed Ark. Eight specimens. This species has similar habitats to the above but is less common; presum- ably it was eaten when it turned up but was not specifically sought. Glycimeris {Glycimeris) pilosus Lamarck. Orbicular Ark, Dog-cockle. Seven specimens. This species has rather strong almost circular valves. One has been definitely used and is described below. The others are on the whole in rather good condition though they may have been collected from the beach. It lives in quite deep water (Locard (1892) quotes 10-60 metres), and we have not heard of its being eaten today. Maybe the shells were collected on account of their usefulness. Glycimeris bimaculata (Poli), a rather similar species, is reported from Thermi in Lesbos (Early Bronze Age). Glycimeris sp. is reported from both Aghios Kosmas (Mylonas, 1959, 148, Early Bronze Age) and (as Pectunculus sp.) from Khirokitia (Wilkins, 1953, 438, Neolithic). Our species is reported (as Pectunculus pilosus) from A. Mamas (Heurtley, 1939, 89, Early Bronze Age). From Ksâr 'Akil (Altena, 1962, Lebanon Palaeolithic) are at least 75 specimens of one or other of these species, most of which van Regieren Altena (1962) considers to have been collected alive. From Jericho (Neolithic and Early Bronze Age) a number of the smaller species, Glycimeris violescens, are described (Biggs, 1963), being used as necklaces. This species is also reported from Ksâr 'Akil (38 specimens), again probably collected alive. The worked example, Small Find no. 546 is about 6 cm. in diameter. It has a hole in the umbo, of which the origin is not clear; it may be man-made or it may have already had a hole worn in the umbo when it was collected. All the area around the umbo has been ground down to quite a smooth surface, all traces of teeth having been removed. On the other hand the edge of the shell most distant from the umbo has been ground on a rather coarse rock, leaving deep striations across the edge. Lima lima Linné. Two specimens only (N3 L8, Cliff 4) . Depth range 2-40 metres ; quite a common species in the Mediterranean. Ostrea edulis Linné. Oyster. Twenty-eight specimens, or a few more ; this species was only partially separated from Spondylus gaederopus in 1964. This species lives in a depth range of 2-40 metres and is, of course, eaten today. Ostrea stentina Payraudeau. One worn valve.</page><page sequence="160">126 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Loupes lacteus (Linné). A very small circular bivalve with a thin shell. Three specimens only. Littoral to 600 metres; probably of no significance. Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck. The common mussel (in the Mediterranean) (plate lviii, 4). This is the most enigmatic species of all. A total of 144 specimens was found of which 47 proved to have been worked. This ratio is all the more remarkable if one considers that many of the remainder were too small to work, and others very probably had been broken. Table 30 shows that the species is almost entirely confined to Phase 1 . TABLE 30. OCCURRENCE OF MYTILUS GALLOPROVINCIALIS BY PHASES Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 1 or 2 Phase 3 Unphased Worked 19 2 5 2 19 Unworked 52 3 6 2 34 A typical unbroken example is about 5 cm. long and 1*50 cm. wide. It is of an attractive reddish-brown colour outside; the inside is covered with a good layer of mother-of-pearl. The working consists in grinding the shell on a flat surface so as to reduce the originally sharp edge to a planar bevel about 1 mm. wide all round. At the umbo this polished area may increase to perhaps 3 mm. and here the layers in the pearl are attractively revealed. A good example is really beautiful. Though many do not attain this perfection the best was certainly made of all those examples found which had a good coating of pearl. It is easy to dub these objects 'spoons'. But the truth is that if one simply wants to improve the suitability of a mussel shell as a spoon, this is not the way to set about it. One would round off the edges, as the inhabitants of our site did when making spoons out of limpets, tritons, or Spondylus shells. But the operation which has rendered the common mussel so beautiful on Saliagos leaves an edge which though more regular is just as sharp as the original. It seems indisputable that the intention was to make something beautiful. It would seem that there is no other record of early peoples discovering the potential of the mussel in this way. On the other hand there are parallel examples from other sites, of shells of a particular species being collected exclusively for decorative purposes. Perhaps the most striking are the Palaeolithic deposits at Ksâr 'Akil in the Lebanon. Here out of a total of around 1,600 shells, no less than 1,116 belong to either Columbella rústica or Nassarius (Arcularia) gibbo- sula, two small gastropods. Of these 779 have a hole in the last whorl, and many more have been ground down, This assemblage is described by van Regieren Altena (1962), whose paper is the only quantitative work known to the present writer on the Mollusca from a site in the East Mediterranean. Another site where several molluscs appear to have been collected for their decorative possibilities is Jericho (Neolithic and Bronze Age) . Reference may be made to the Revd. H. E. J. Biggs's paper (1963), especially to the section on Nassarius gibbosula. Pinna nobilis Linné. Fan shell. This is easily the largest Mediterranean bivalve, its average length being about 40 cm. The animal itself is disappointingly small, but still worth eating; it is certainly still eaten in Antiparos today, and Riedl (1963) tells us that it is to be seen frequently in the fish-markets round the</page><page sequence="161">APPENDIX IX. MOLLUSCA, CRUSTACEA, ECHINODERMATA 127 Adriatic. The shell is very thin and soon breaks up, so that only the thick end part is preserved. Even this is inclined to break into thin flakes so that counting is a problem. The minimum needed to identify the species is so much less than the minimum needed to be sure that two individuals are present, that the actual number recorded, 462 or about 2 per cent of the total shells, is probably an underestimate. However, if the Pinna consumption is computed by finding the average size of sample at which Pinna starts to appear, the result is not so different, perhaps 3 per cent. Two examples were found of worked Pinna shell, Small Finds nos. 61 and 69. The former is cut from a flat area of shell, but is broken, so that its original shape and purpose can only be guessed at. The other is a rather narrow spatula making use of the natural curvature at the centre of the valve. The Pinna shell is particularly fragile. Despite this, one might have expected to find at least a few fragments of the upper part of the shell, whereas all our fragments are from the lower and thicker end. A possible explanation lies in the fact that the upper part of the Pinna shell is rather inflammable. Pinna nobilis grows on sandy bottoms in a depth range of 4-40 metres. One can therefore find it by swimming from the shore. On the other hand if they were collected only in this way the larger individuals might soon become scarce : whereas throughout the occupation the fragments excavated have derived from rather large individuals. It seems likely, therefore, that they were collected from boats. The Pinna nobilis fragment reported from Thermi in Lesbos (Lamb, 1936 a, 216, Early Bronze Age) was also of a very large individual. From the same site comes another fragment bored as an ornament. Chlamys {Chlamys) pes-felis (Linné). One burnt fragment only. It is indeed puzzling that shells from the scallop group are not apparently found at all in excavations. Today it is not only a popular food and one of the few shellfish not confined to the tables of the poorer classes, but is also of great significance as a symbol. Spondylus gaederopus Linné (plate lviii, i). Well known to archaeologists because of its durability and its suitability for the carving of ornaments. This shell does not have much importance at our site. Many of the 178 recorded (about 1 per cent of the total shell count) are fragments. Perhaps this fact calls for comment in view of the strength of the shell : maybe brute force was used to break the shell in order to eat the animal inside. Most at any rate were collected alive. Some of the shells may have been utilized without any modification. One fragment of a bracelet οι Spondylus gaederopus was found, and is described in the catalogue of beads and adornments. In addition 4 Spondylus shells which might have been used as large spoons or scoops were found. One, Small Find no. 122 (from N3 L5, Phase 3) has been cut to a shape somewhat like the Charonia spoons mentioned below, and has been ground away at the back on a flattish stone. The others, Small Finds no. 438 (from S3 L7), no. 436 (from S3 L6), no. 434 (from 83a, L6-7), and no. 442 (from R3 L3) are only slightly modified or smoothed. Spondylus gaederopus lives in depths below about two metres, quite firmly attached to the bottom. Faber writing in 1883 said that in the Adriatic region it seldom came to market. Since then its consumption must have died out entirely as Riedl does not record it at all in the fish- markets of the same area. It is occasionally eaten in Crete.</page><page sequence="162">128 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Cerastoderma edule (Linné). Cockle (plate lviii, 6) = Cardium edule Linné (much better known by this, the old name). Still eaten today round the Mediterranean and indeed in England. This was quite an impor- tant part of the diet on Saliagos (see Table 29). Its habitat is quite different from that of the dominant food molluscs. It lives buried in the sand, from the littoral zone out to about 30 metres of water depth. On the whole the shells of this species are in excellent condition, and have certainly been collected alive. A few have, however, been used as scrapers, perhaps to clean leather or remove meat from bones. There is no indication of their being modified for use as spoons or for any decorative purposes. This is perhaps surprising. In other sites they are frequently found pierced and used as necklaces (Grave XX at Prosymna (Biegen, 1937, 458), Middle Helladic Period; Jericho (Biggs, 1963, Early Bronze Age); Servia (Heurtley, 1939, 65 and 78, Neolithic)). Callista chione (Linné). One shell (broken, though not worn). A larger bivalve, sold in the fish-markets of the Adriatic today. Of similar habitat to the last species, it would presumably have been eaten if it had been common in the region. Apparently not reported from other sites. Venus verrucosa Linné. A more or less circular bivalve, a little larger than the average cockle and with deep concentric markings. It inhabits the sediment, sandy or muddy, from the littoral zone down to 30 metres in the Eastern Mediterranean. It is often found in the Adriatic region fish-markets (Riedl, 1963) . On our site there were 31 specimens. What significance one can attach to the presence of only one in the first Phase it is hard to judge. These were probably collected fortuitously along with the other burrowing molluscs, and eaten at the same time. Venerupis aurea (Gmelin) (plate lviii, 7) = Tapes aureus (Gmelin). Golden carpet shell. A bivalve living, like the cockle, buried in the sand. The shell is smoother than that of the cockle and more oval, and it is usually larger. It is to be found in the fish-markets around the Adriatic. As Table 29 shows, this is the most important bivalve on our site, and makes up 10 per cent of all the shells found. Although quite a large proportion of the rather fragile shells are broken, their condition otherwise is excellent; in particular, the hinge teeth are almost invariably perfect so that these molluscs must have been collected alive. In one group it was noted by chance that two matching pairs of valves were present (note that the numbers quoted for all bivalves are of single valves, so the number of animals represented is half the number quoted) . The matching pairs were quite perfect, with no sign of having been prised open, and there were enough perfect single valves to suggest that in general the shells were not prised open. This is of importance since, if the shells are dropped into boiling water, the animals come away cleanly from their shells, so that we have at any rate a slight indication that these molluscs were cooked. The same is probably true of the cockles though the evidence is weaker, since, having a fragile edge, many of them are chipped. One shell of this species was found to be worked ; the curved edge of the shell was bevelled off neatly. The purpose was not clear. It occurred in S4 L2, in Phase 3. Curiously enough, this species does not seem to have been a popular food at other sites in the region, to judge from the rather scanty reports available.</page><page sequence="163">APPENDIX IX. MOLLUSCA, CRUSTACEA, ECHINODERMATA 129 Pharus legumen (Linné). A large razor shell which lives buried in the sand. One fragment only was found. Solen marginatus Montagu = Solen vagina Linné, from Thermi (Bronze Age) in Lesbos. A rather smaller razor shell, also living in the sand. It is to be found in the fish-markets around the Adriatic but with only nine specimens at Saliagos it would be rash to assume that it was eaten in Neolithic times : the shells could easily have been collected by children from a sandy beach. Barnea cândida (Linné). This wood- and stone-boring mollusc has a surface covered with rows of small spines and one might devise a use for it. However, only one fragment was found, which is probably not significant. GASTEROPODA Haliotis lamellosa Lamarck. Two specimens only (K3 L7, Cliff 17, Pit A). An attractive shell with a pearly inside. The shell has naturally several holes in it so that it could be used for decorative purposes without any additional modification. Littoral zone; found on beaches. Diodora (Diodora) graeca (Linné).

Since all the individuals were not in good enough condition to determine, it was in the end decided that no separation would be made at all. This seems reasonable on archaeological grounds since it is unlikely that the people who collected the animals would have discriminated between them. On the other hand it must be admitted that if studied in sufficient detail these shells might yield exact information regarding the place in relation to sea level where the bulk of them were collected, a matter which would not be without human interest. In fig. 28 (upper) a histogram is plotted of longest diameters for all limpets from an aliquot of the material from Cliff 1 7, Pit A. We see that on the whole people did not trouble to collect many with a large diameter less than 25 mm. The upper cut-off is less sharp since they would have taken any large ones which were available. By way of a contrast fig. 28 (lower) presents a similar histogram for all the patellae in a concentration of these species in Square P3 L6. Here more than half the specimens measured are smaller than 25 mm. This may represent a meal collected from a rather unfavourable spot, or perhaps a period of scarcity. These two species are eaten today by fishing people on Antiparos. Not a single limpet was recorded among the 500-odd shells from Khirokitia (Neolithic) in Cyprus though a few were recorded from Erimi (Wilkins, 1953, 439). They are noted from Thermi in Lesbos (Lamb, 1936 a, 216), one of the few other sites in the region from which abundant shellfish food refuse has been described.

It is suggested that these may have been used to make a necklace, though it is not stated how many limpet shells were found not broken in this way. The nature of the crystal structure of the shell facilitates this mode of breakage without any human intervention. Some were found in various Early Bronze Age tombs in the Cyclades by Tsountas (1898, 166; 1899, 105). Although he pointed out that there were not enough present in any one place to constitute a meal, and that they are there- fore probably there by chance, it does seem reasonable to suppose that they were derived from food refuse that was lying around rather than from a beach deposit. On Amorgos he did find quantities of limpets associated with remains of sheep /goat. Monodonta (Osilinus) turbinata (Born) = Trochus turbinatus. Top shell (plate lviii, io-ii). This is the next most common species after the limpets. Again among so many individuals there are varieties and possibly other species present which have been ignored.

Maximum diameter of last WHORL MEASURED from the table, this species is rather less frequent in the first phase of the occupation : not much over one-tenth of the total as compared with nearer a quarter for the last two phases. It should, however, be remarked that the increased overburden on the lower levels means that the pro- portion of shells broken increases as we descend in the excavation. It is not easy to devise a counting criterion which makes allowance for this. There may have been a change in eating habits as regards this species despite the above reservation.</page><page sequence="166">132 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS This species inhabits the rocky part of the shore in a habitat very similar to that of the limpets, though there is no effort involved in removing them from the rock surface. An examination of the numbers level by level suggests that, as one might perhaps expect, they were harvested together with limpets. What this implies is that at no time was food so plentiful that people could afford to take the easy path and collect the M. turbinata shells while not bothering to prise off the limpets. fig. 29 is a histogram to indicate the size-range collected. The dimension measured is the maximum diameter of the last whorl of the shell. There was no evidence to show any change in the size-range selected during the occupation of the site. The only site where large numbers of Monodonta turbinata have been recorded is Khirokitia (Neolithic) in Cyprus (Wilkins, 1953, 438). Here, of the 450-odd shells recorded, more than 90 per cent belonged to this species. The report notes that some are crushed, 'probably to extract the last morsel of food from the shell'. On the Saliagos site there is no indication that the crushing of shells is other than fortuitous. On the other hand, the fact that some are whole does not preclude the possibility that the others were broken intentionally : sometimes the animal will come out without too much difficulty; sometimes nothing short of breaking the shell to pieces will succeed in extracting it. One way of eating these animals is to roast them gently (alive), but there is no conclusive evidence that this was done by the inhabitants of Saliagos. Quite a large proportion of the shells are burnt, but not all. However, the minimum roasting needed to kill the animal and thus release its grip on the shell is probably not enough to char the shell; so that even if all had been roasted they might not appear charred at all. Lemintina arenaria (Linné). Bivonia trigueira (Bivona). A few pieces of the former, about a centimetre in diameter and resembling a contorted snake, were found. They were probably found on the beach. The latter lives encrusted on stones or on other shells and probably occurs fortuitously. Cymatium parthenopium (von Salis) = Cymatium olearium, (reported from Khirokitia) -Loterium olearium, (from Molyvopyrgo) . Practically all the 27 records of this species are fragments. Two, Small Finds nos. 441 and 548, are the curved and thickened lip of the aperture almost certainly picked up from the beach in this condition. (Their assignation to this species is not certain.) Another two, Small Finds nos. 448 and 549, are almost complete and show distinct signs of having been used for some rubbing or smoothing operation (the wear is too localized to be natural) . One, also, has two holes in it : though roughly made they are unlikely to be natural. The rest are all fragments, of such a size as to suggest that the shell was generally broken into two or three pieces to remove the animal. Tonna galea (Linné) =Dolium galea (Linné). One fragment of this rather fragile shell was found (Cliff 4). This species reaches a length of about 25 cm. (Carus), and inhabits the deeper waters in a similar habitat to Charonia. If, there- fore, the latter was caught alive for its food value, the same can be said for Tonna. Tonna galea is reported from Thermi (Lamb, loc. cit., Early Bronze Age), and in one grave (XVII) at Prosymna (Biegen, 1937, 458). Replicas of both Tonna and Charonia in bronze,</page><page sequence="167">APPENDIX IX. MOLLUSCA, CRUSTACEA, ECHINODERMATA 133 alabaster, and obsidian have been excavated at the palace of Phaistos in Crete (Boekschotten, 1 963)5 so that the possibility of a special significance for these species should be borne in mind. Murex (Trunculariopsis) trunculus Linné (plate lviii, 2). Making up nearly 5 per cent of all the shells recorded, this species must probably be counted one of the major sources of food. Most of the shells were between 40 and 70 mm. long. Quite a high proportion were broken and /or burnt. The shell of this species, which lives mainly on hard bottoms from the tidal zone down to a depth of 60 metres (Locard, 1892), is often colonized by sponges, algae, etc. while the animal is still alive. This gives shells the misleading appearance of having been collected on the beach. Murex trunculus is fairly impartially distributed through the deposits. The variations between phases do not appear to be significant, nor does a detailed examination of its distribution reveal anything striking. It seems to occur associated with other shells in a rather constant ratio. Nowadays caught by bait like the English whelk, this species is eaten around the Adriatic (Riedl, 1963) and much of the rest of the Mediterranean (Gruvel, 193 1). The Tyrian Purple of the ancients was extracted from Murex trunculus, Murex brandaris, and Thais haemastoma. The dye is found in the hypobranchial gland (for details, see Fretter and Graham, 1962, 127 and 51 1), so that the animal must be extracted from the shell. The Romans seem to have crushed the shells for this purpose (Boekschotten, 1963). Discussing the four Murex trunculus shells from Khirokitia (Neolithic) Wilkins (loc. cit.) says: 'Although this species is one of the group from which the purple dye was formerly extracted there is no sign of breakage of the shells for this purpose; no doubt they were also used as food and the shells discarded.' The implication is that one cannot extract the animal without breaking the shell. Cooking, however, frees the animal from its shell, and the find of unbroken shells would seem to indicate that it was eaten cooked. Murex (Bolinus) brandaris Linné (plate lviii, 5). Forty-three specimens, all in excellent condition, were found. The proportion is markedly higher in Phase 1 than in the rest of the deposits. The habitat-range quoted by Locard (1892) is 5-60 metres, or a little deeper than M. trunculus. According to Riedl it does not live so much on rocks as on sandy bottoms. Not all works refer to any difference in habitat, but the suggestion may explain the lack of correspon- dence between the two species on our site. Faber (1883) states that (in the Adriatic) M. brandaris is general and common and is eaten by the 'lower classes'. Making a similar comment regarding M. trunculus he adds that the latter is inferior as food. However Riedl (1963) notes only M. trunculus in the Adriatic region fish- markets. In the Neolithic of Crete Murex trunculus is reported (Vickerey, 1936, 76) but not Murex brandaris. In Cyprus we find Murex trunculus at Khirokitia but Murex brandaris at Erimi (Wilkins, loc. cit.). The fine condition of the rather elegant shells of this species seems to demand an explanation. If both Murex trunculus and Murex brandaris had been used for the same purpose, one would expect the shells to be found in the same condition.</page><page sequence="168">134 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Thais (Stramonita) haemastoma (Linné). Seventeen specimens were found, not enough to show any variation from phase to phase. Most of them show no sign of beach wear and were almost certainly collected alive. On the other hand, most are broken. Its habitat is similar to the Murex spp. though not ranging so deep. Reported (one) from Jericho (Bronze Age), and from Khirokitia (Neolithic) (one). Charonia lampas (Linné). ' ' Triton shell, Conch. Charonia variegata (Phil.) J - Charonia tritonis (Linné) from Erimi (Wilkins, loc. cit.). = Triton tritonis Linné from Paros (Tsountas, loc. cit.). = Charonia gyrinoides (Brocchi) from Crete (Boekschotten, 1963). - Tritonium nodiferum Lamarck (Locard). Some of these names have probably been used incorrectly; for example Charonia tritonis (Linné) is an Indo-Pacific species but the shell described is almost certainly one of the two large Mediterranean species. Although there are several fragments which can be definitely assigned to the first of these species, and a few which can be definitely assigned to the second, there are also quite a number which might belong to either. This applies to the many cut-to-shape 'spoons' which have been found in deposits mostly assigned to the Third Phase of the occupation (Small Finds nos. 430, 432, 437, 440, 445, 447, 449, 190, 68, 392, 60). The two species will therefore be considered together, bearing in mind that Charonia lampas is almost certainly the dominant member. In all there are 94 records distributed fairly impartially among the phases. None of the fragments has the appearance of having been collected off the beach as fragments - that is to say the edges are generally clean breaks. We cannot rule out the possibility that the shells were collected empty from the beach, though they are by no means common. In the recent record there is but one known example of their being found living around water level (between tides) (Kisch, 1949) . From the same source we learn that an individual measuring 23-5 cm. X 12*05 cm. weighed 1,100 gm. of which 430 gm. was shell, leaving the animal as a sizeable meal: Hidalgo (1870) quotes a depth-range of 20-40 metres for Charonia lampas, and Locard a range of 10-40 metres for Charonia variegata. Lacking any more detailed knowledge of the depth-ranges we may at any rate assume that no small effort was involved in collecting these animals. Charonia lampas is the Triton or Conch-shell and there is plenty of room for speculation as regards their use as vessels (as at Khirokitia) or as horns (Evans, 1901, 142). In connexion with the two specimens reported from Phylakopi (Atkinson, 1904, 201) it is noted that the modern Cretans use them as food. As regards our specimens there is no concrete evidence except in respect of their use as material for cut-to-shape spoons. Here we are on firm ground. Of the 1 1 small finds listed above 8 belong to Phase 3, 1 to Phase 2, and the other 2 not assigned. Typically they are of shell about 3 mm. thick and the piece about 8 cm. X4 cm., evenly rounded and with the edges carefully bevelled off. A careful examination of a representative example shows it to have been made by grinding on a largish flat stone (not by using a smaller stone in the manner of a file). Natica dillwynii Payreudeau. One specimen only.</page><page sequence="169">APPENDIX IX. MOLLUSCA, CRUSTACEA, ECHINODERMATA 135 Luria lurida (Linné). Cowrie. = Cypraea lurida Linné from Jericho (Biggs, 1963, Pre-Pottery Neolithic, 3 specimens), A. Mamas (Heurtley, loc. cit., Early Bronze Age), and Khirokitia (Neolithic, 5 specimens). = Talparia lurida (Linné) in Riedl (1963). One specimen only (Y3 Li). A cowrie about 3 cm. long. Probably collected from the beach dead, as the shell has lost its surface and coloration completely. Cypraea achatidea Sowerby. Cowrie. Two specimens, both of which have been worked. They may have been collected alive in view of the excellent state of their surface which is shiny and coloured. Each is the ribbed mouth of the shell, one side only, and they resemble the fragments of Cypraea erosa Linné which Biggs has called 'hook5 or 'buckle' fragments (his fig. 2 (g)). However, it is believed that the Saliagos fragments were not used in this form but that they have become broken subsequently. Both show definite evidence of having been pierced near one end by carefully grinding away of the surface. The shell is rather thin and the operation would have to be performed with some care, but these are probably the most beautiful shells in the area and worth a certain amount of trouble. It would be worth while examining fragments of cowrie from other sites with this in mind. The pierced examples of Cypraea lurida from Jericho (Biggs, 1963), in his fig. 2 (b), (c) (described on the figure-caption erroneously as Cypraea livida) are pierced at the side and not at the end, and so do not resemble ours. Columbella rústica Linné. 12 specimens. Columbella decollata. 5 specimens. This genus was not distinguished from Conus in 1964 so that the actual numbers should be higher. The total number οι Columbella or Conus recorded in 1964 was 22. When fresh the shells of these two species, which are rather similar, cone shells about one cm. long, are quite attractive and they might well have been collected for decorative purposes. They need not have been collected live as the shells washed up on the beach are often in good con- dition and retain their coloration. Biggs (1963), discussing the Mollusca from Jericho, states that Columbella sp. are frequent in excavations in the Near East. Fasciolaria [Tarantinaed) lignaria (Linné). One specimen. Cerithium (Thericium) vulgatum Bruguières (plate lviii, 9). As will be seen from Table 29 this is one of the more abundant species, amounting to about 2 per cent of all shells. This seems rather surprising as the animal is not large. A high pro- portion of the shells are broken, in fact only one perfect example was seen. Many had at least the lip of the aperture broken, which might happen while the animal was being prised from the shell. This does not necessarily mean that Cerithium vulgatum was not cooked; the animal may withdraw out of reach on being plunged into boiling water.</page><page sequence="170">136 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Faber (1883) states that this species was eaten by the poor in Venice, Trieste, and elsewhere. This is no longer so. It is common in the littoral zone on hard substrates, down to about ten metres depth. One example is included in the small finds: Small Find no. 435 (Cliffy. The shell is burnt, which confuses its interpretation, but it has certainly been worked. The surface has been so ground away that it is practically devoid of original surface ornament. However, closer exami- nation reveals that in the hollows that have not been obliterated the ornament is quite fresh, which would not be the case if the wear were due to wave action. There are two holes in the shell. The larger one was made by filing a groove ; the hole is larger than might have been anticipated as the smoothing operation had left the shell so thin at this point that it collapsed. Maybe the worker was so displeased that he threw his work into the fire. This species is recorded at Thermi (Early Bronze Age), and at Erimi (Late Neolithic) in Cyprus (3 specimens). Conus (Lautoconus) mediterraneus Hwass in Bruguières. Ten specimens (but see note under Columbella regarding numbers of this genus). There are two included in the Small Finds. One, Small Find no. 446 (Vi L2), is rather rounded and has a hole in the apex. Some of the inside is broken away and one can see right through (so that it is easy to imagine threading this shell on a string). The other one, Small Find no. 565 from K3 L8, is more interesting. There is the same hole in the apex - and considered alone this could in both cases be from natural wear. But in addition there is a slot filed near the small end of the shell, on the opposite side to the opening, which must surely have been made with an obsidian implement as a saw or file. This is deep enough to permit one to see light when looking through the hole in the apex (unlike the previous example the inner whorls have not been removed so that one cannot see from the apical hole through to the end of the natural opening) . It may be instructive to compare this find with the Conus shells from the Late Helladic Period tombs at Prosymna (Biegen, 1937, 464). From eight different tombs come a total of 58 shells of the genus Conus. Roughly one-third are unpierced, one-third pierced at the apex, and one-third pierced on the side. A few have more than one hole. Since there were no burials at Saliagos we obviously cannot draw any comparisons on this score, but what may be compared is the workmanship. As far as one can judge from the illustrations the side piercings in the Prosymna examples have been made by grinding the shells on stone. The result is a rather ragged sub- circular hole, quite unlike the neat slot in our example.1 Although there is only the one example from Saliagos it seems possible that it was a common form, in view of the rather sophisticated groove. It derives from the third phase. Conus coronatus Gmelin is reported both from Khirokitia and Erimi. It has not been possible to ascertain whether or not this is the same species, but probably it is. 1 This is a rather common technique for boring holes in shells. The illustrations in the Revd. H. E. J. Biggs's paper on the Jericho molluscs (Biggs, 1963) illustrates the point most excellently; for example, in his fig. 2 (b), (c), and (h) a ring around each hole can clearly be seen, since it is necessary to grind away a considerable area of shell before the surface breaks away at the thinnest point. His fig. 2 (h), the Cardium (now Cerastoderma) edule, especially should be borne in mind when examining shells of this species, as they are often found on the beach perforated near the umbo by a boring sponge. In this case the hole is small and circular as if made with a 1 /16-inch drill. Again the impact of stones either on the beach or during excavation can produce a hole, but in this case there will be no bevelled area around the hole. On the other hand, as noted above, the crystal structure of the Patella shell encourages it to break off to form a ring of shell neatly bevelled off almost as described above. It should be noted, however, that the bevelled area is not a plane (as it would be if made by grinding) but a wide-angle cone, and of course there will be no sign of the actual grinding.</page><page sequence="171">APPENDIX IX. MOLLUSCA, CRUSTACEA, ECHINODERMATA 137 THE TERRESTRIAL MOLLUSCA Eobania vermiculata (Müller). Helix (Pelasga) figulina Rossm. Helix {Helix) cf. ligata Müller. Clausilia (Albinaria) ? sp. Xenocrassa cretica (Fer). None of the land snails is of sufficiently frequent occurrence to justify our attributing their presence to human agency. Indeed, if one examines the data critically there are perhaps only two shells of terrestrial snails which certainly originate within the occupation levels of the site. Since they all have much thinner shells than the marine Mollusca they have of course a far smaller chance of being preserved. Even in the material from Cliff 1 7 Pit A, which might have a better representation, since it was never trampled underfoot, we find only half a dozen land snails, which could easily have found their own way there. The most useful point one can make in connection with the land Mollusca is that they provide a very simple and reliable way of distinguishing between the occupation and post-occupation layers. In the layer of soil which has accumulated in the centuries which have elapsed since the occupation of the site one can easily recognize virtually complete shells of Eobania vermiculata. By using a window 10 cm. X 5 cm. in a piece of card it was possible to count an average of 10 large pieces per 50 sq. cm. throughout this layer, working down a section. At the occupation layers this figure drops dramatically to zero. Within the occupation layers one can still distinguish minute white fragments of the same species in a section, though they are too small to be picked out by any normal method. This indicates, of course, that the site supported a large snail-population during the occupation just as it does today, but that most of the shells were crushed, presumably underfoot, before burial. CLASS CEPHALOPODA Sepia qfficinalis. Cuttlefish. One small fragment of cuttlefish guard was found in the material from Cliff 1 7 Pit A. This is not enough to make any deductions as to its importance as a food, though its presence in this particular deposit, which contains scarcely any Mollusca except the three dominant food species, is particularly significant. This is not the first time Sepia-remains have been found in the region ; they are reported from Thermi (Early Bronze Age). GLASS SCAPHOPODA It seems worthy of note that not a single Dentalium fragment has come to light on this site. The necklaces incorporating Dentalium found by Tsountas ( 1 899) in the Bronze- Age tombs on Paros, and those found at Khirokitia (Dikaios, 1953, 304, Neolithic), are so striking that one wonders whether their sole purpose was to accompany the dead. CRUSTACEA A total of 24 crab claws was found, but nothing which could be attributed to lobster. Although not all the claws were identifiable, at least three different species were present. All are quite common in the area today.</page><page sequence="172">138 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS Eriphea spinifrons (Herbst). Carcinus mediterraneus Czernavsky. Cancer pagurus Linné. Edible crab. All three are edible though it is the last-mentioned which is particularly known over a wide area as the edible crab. If we bear in mind that crab fragments have a much smaller chance of survival than shell and bone, this number is good evidence that crab formed a significant part of the diet. Ε G HIN ODE RM AT A About a dozen fragments of sea urchin were found. Nearly all were very small and only by chance survived the excavation and washing: for example one or two inside shells. In the Cliff 17 Pit A material several spines were also recognized. If one really wanted information on sea- urchin eating it would be necessary to sieve with a mesh of about one mm. One would thus collect individual plates, each bearing the boss for one spine. Meanwhile, it may be inferred that sea urchins were eaten, probably quite regularly. The species represented is probably Echinus melo (Lamarck). Sea urchins are eaten on Anti- paros today.</page><page sequence="173">APPENDIX X. THE CEREAL REMAINS j. M. Renfrew, Mew Hall, Cambridge During the excavations at Saliagos evidence for the cultivation of cereals was found in the form of fossilized grain and grain impressions together with two carbonized grass-seeds. The main bulk of the material came from a form of mud brick or pisé mud perhaps used in the con- struction of the houses. This mud contains straw doubtless used to help the drying out of the inside of the bricks to prevent their cracking, and in several cases the remains of grains were also found in it. The inhabitants probably used the sweepings from their threshing-floors in making this mud brick. The cereal grains are preserved in a fossilized condition; their glumes, lemma, and palea have been replaced by a silica deposit in the best-preserved examples, while the endosperm and embryo have been replaced by the mud-brick constituents. This is the first time in the author's knowledge that grain has been found preserved in this fossilized condition ab c Fig. 30. Grain impressions of (a), Einkorn; (b), Emmer; (c), Hulled barley in prehistoric Europe, and the find is thus an important one. Occasionally as in Square T2 and 4 L8 and L9 and in Square K3B L14 the grain was subjected to enough heat to carbonize the glumes, although the rest of the grain survives in a fossilized condition. This is the case with the material from Square T2 and 4 L8 and L9. Here the find of grain first suggested that the function of the circular structure with which they were associated was the storage of grain. But the fact that the grain is not carbonized and loose, but is embedded in the brick-like substance and is fossilized suggests that its association with this structure is not attributable to the storage of grain in the structure, but rather to the use of mud brick in its construction. The grains thus preserved are not easy to identify. In the majority of cases only the dorsal and lateral aspects are well preserved and the ventral side has been destroyed. This makes the distinction between two- and six-row barley quite impossible to draw, as it largely depends on the shape of the ventral furrow. Grains of barley are distinguished from those of wheat by being more flattened on the dorsal side, and in the case of hulled barley which is represented here at Saliagos, the caryopsis is completely hidden by the lemma and palea. The lemma which covers the dorsal side has five strongly marked nerves which can be recognized in these fossilized examples. Unfortunately the base of the grain is missing from these fossilized grains and so it is not possible to determine the type of ear from which they come. The fossilized barley is illustrated in plate LVii, d-e.</page><page sequence="174">140 EXCAVATIONS AT SALIAGOS There is comparatively little wheat preserved by fossilization. It is characterized by a more convexly rounded dorsal side, and is relatively narrow, and the ventral side of the caryopsis is flatter. Most of the wheat could be Emmer, although it is difficult to be sure of this without being able to examine the ventral aspect where the characteristic hollow in the middle of the ventral crease can be seen. From Cliff section i, there is a grain which must be Einkorn, being steeply rounded on its dorsal side and rounded also on the ventral side. The following table gives the number of wheat and barley grains identified from each sample of this brick-like material. TABLE 31.

Total 64 I 335 I 40 1 I 84% Besides the fossilized material a number of grain impressions were found (fig. 30) . Unlike the fossilized material, of which it seemed impossible to take satisfactory measurements, the extremities of the grain often being damaged or missing, the grain impressions have yielded a good series of figures. Barley is represented by two impressions of the ventral side, which probably belong to hulled two-row barley Hordeum distickum; the measurements are: length, 6-7 mm., average 6-5 mm.; breadth, 4-5 mm. The wheat seems to be mainly Emmer, Triticum dicoccum, with a length 5-0- 7-2 mm., average 6-2 mm.; breadth, 2-0-4-0 mm., average 2-8 mm.; and thickness 2-5-4-0 mm., average 3-1 mm. One of the wheat-grain impressions seems to have derived from a two-grained Einkorn, Triticum monococcum, as is shown by its relative narrowness and by the flattened ventral side. It measures 5-5 mm. in length and is 2-0 mm. broad. Thus it appears that Einkorn, Emmer, and two-row hulled barley were cultivated by the inhabitants of Saliagos. They may also have grown six-row barley but it is not possible to be certain of this. The absence of carbonized grain is interesting: despite the washing of numerous soil samples from likely places only two seeds were recovered in Oi L66, probably belonging to Lolium sp. They measured in length 4-9 mm., breadth 1-2 and 1-4 mm., and thickness o-8 mm. and ο·6 mm. The lack of carbonized material must be due in some way to the conditions of pre- servation on the site.</page><page sequence="175">APPENDIX X. THE CEREAL REMAINS 141 The proportion of barley to wheat is remarkable. In Neolithic Greece as a whole there appears to be a preponderance of wheat to barley (Renfrew, j.m., 1966). However, the chief part of the evidence comes from mainland Greece and more especially from the fertile plains inland. The modern crop distribution shows that the main wheat-growing regions are in Thessaly and Macedonia, and that in the drier south barley is grown more commonly than wheat, especially in the Aegean islands including Crete and the Cyclades. Tournefort wrote in 1718: 'Antiparos produces as much Barley as serves sixty or seventy Families' (Tournefort, 17 18, 144) and it seems that barley has long been an important cereal in these islands.</page><page sequence="176">APPENDIX XI. THE USE OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY IN THE EXCAVATION OF SALIAGOS IAN a. Morrison, University of Edinburgh Almost all the large-scale plans published in this volume were made by photogramme try. This term covers a variety of techniques for deriving plans from information recorded in photographs. The methods used on Saliagos in 1964 and 1965 had been developed during the preceding four years, in a programme of laboratory experiments and field trials carried out in Britain and Greece during other archaeological work of the present writer, who is grateful to Professor John Evans and Dr. Colin Renfrew for allowing him to use their dig to build up a range of photogrammetric material for further experiments with alternative combinations of photographic specifications and plotting methods. The details of the theory and practice of the procedures under development will be published separately in due course. The present short note is concerned with the general results of applying photogrammetry at Saliagos. The excavation disclosed extensive and complex spreads of stones, and it was often difficult to distinguish, say, tumbled structures from rough cobbling (see fig. 9) . With such problems of interpretation it was necessary to keep an especially objective and comprehensive record of the whole site, at every stage of the 'unrepeatable experiment'. To do this by hand-drawing in the field would have meant either holding back the digging and wasting the time of the paid work- men, or diverting the skilled personnel from their other work. The photograph offers an in- stantaneous detailed record, from which accurate plans can be drawn in retrospect. The time needed on the site for survey could accordingly be much reduced, from that required by tra- ditional methods of archaeological planning. Control markers made of card were first pinned to the ground in grid patterns (the density of the pattern depending on the programme of experiments), then a standard 35-mm. camera was used. Much of the work was done without further preparation. The photographs were simply taken from the top of a step-ladder with the camera held by hand at any convenient angle. This was fast and effective even when done by site supervisors with no previous training in such work. More work must be done at the plotting stage, however, to extract information from photographs taken at random angles than in the case of those taken under specially selected conditions. Several different kinds of controlled photography were therefore undertaken on Saliagos, so that their relative merits for different applications could be assessed. The necessary equipment was built on Antiparos, without workshop facilities. This consisted of an easily dismantled twenty-foot-tall tripod, bolted together from mild steel slotted angle. In use this straddled the area to be photographed. A simple tribrach mount, with a circular spirit-level of the sort used on theodolites, allowed the camera to be levelled for accurately vertical photographs and a plywood slide permitted stereo-pairs to be taken. The time taken to lift the tripod from place to place when covering large areas with strips or blocks of photographs was still very short compared with the time that it would have taken to record the same areas by the traditional methods. No full-time surveyor was in fact required on the dig. Each photogrammetric film was developed immediately, and the completeness of the record was checked. Then, to allow other specialist studies to go ahead with the limited time and personnel available (see Appendix I), the main plotting was left until the expedition had returned home.</page><page sequence="177">APPENDIX XI. THE USE OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY 143 This should not be taken to imply that the site supervisors were hampered in making field notes. Freed from the necessity of measuring-in every stone, they were able to make numerous stage-by-stage sketches on graph paper to illustrate relationships and aid interpretation. The same grid system was used for these sketch-plans and for the control markers that appeared in the photographs, so linking the two provided no problems. All Small Finds were also located in terms of this same grid. 'Rush' prints from the photogrammetric negatives were also used on the site by the directors, who marked these to record their interpretation of the various structures. As the individual stones belonging to each structure were identified they were marked by prick- ing through the photograph. This was quick in the field and left no scope for ambiguity at the plotting stage. For convenience a mosaic was assembled from vertical photographs of part of the site and this was annotated on a tracing-foil overlay. A mosaic cannot escape being a patchwork of many different perspective views, and to make one that even approaches planimetric accuracy can be a lengthy task. This was not attempted. The one used on Saliagos was made in an evening from rough prints at an approximately uniform scale, for use on the site the next day. Since archaeological interpretation relies on relationships rather than absolute dimensions, no problems were encountered in making field notes on this or on the individual photographs, and it was easy to transfer the information to the final plans. Postponing the definitive plotting until after the excavation was complete proved to be good policy. By using the speed of photography to make liberal provision for planning, and then waiting until the end of the dig, when the evidence could be viewed as a whole, before deciding just what in fact ought to be drawn, it was possible, firstly, to insure against the ever-present danger of losing information because its significance was not appreciated early on in the dig, and secondly, to avoid the wasted effort of planning stages of excavation that proved on further digging to lack sufficient significance for a separate plan. Thus, while photogrammetric cover of the more complex dig-squares was taken at three or even five stages of excavation, the plans presented here were selected and drawn with the advantages of hindsight. This is not the place to discuss the details of the experiments with different plotting procedures, but we may note two broad conclusions. Firstly, straightforward graphical methods, requiring no more expensive equipment than a pencil and straight edge, yielded plans that are as accurate as any ordinarily drawn in the field with tape and plumb-bob. Secondly, although the use of survey photography removes the primary time-pressure by allowing the planning to be done retrospectively, at leisure, without danger of holding back the digging, the work done on the Saliagos material has shown that an advantageous combination of speed with accuracy is in fact attainable in the plotting. By starting from inexpensive rush prints at random scales, and using a combination of purely graphical methods and others employing simple optical aids that allowed continuous tracing of detail, the manuscripts for the majority of the excavation plans were drawn in five man-days. The reader may judge how long it would have taken to draw these complex spreads of stones with equivalent fidelity using conventional methods. As noted above, the photogrammetric material from Saliagos is being re-used in comparative studies of different procedures. Similar use is also being made of the photocover of the submerged sites (see Appendix I), to develop corresponding underwater techniques. Throughout these and the previous experiments, the aim has been to develop methods of a sort accessible to the archaeologist himself. The survey requirements of the excavator are not particularly exacting, and if approaches are adapted specifically to these, it is unnecessary to employ techniques that require the equipment and training of the professional photogrammetrist in order to make use of photogrammetry to overcome disadvantages of the traditional methods of archaeological survey.</page><page sequence="178">APPENDIX XII. THE RADIOCARBON SAMPLES Based on determinations by Robert stuckenrath, jnr., Radiocarbon Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania Five samples, of those submitted, were dated by the Radiocarbon Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. One was of soil rich in organic matter, the remaining four from shells of the large bivalve Spondylus gaederopus. Dates are quoted in both the 'Libby value' for the half-life of Carbon-14, namely 5,568 years (as used in Radiocarbon), and on the longer half-life, 5,730 years, the recent and more likely value. Date on 5,568 Date on 5,730 half-life half life P-1393. (Shell 4). Two Spondylus shells from Square Li L4, level with stones of Phase 3 of the site. 3766^85 b.c. 3938^88 b.c. P-1368. (Shell 2).

The samples all fall within the time range 4500 to 3500 b.c., predicated on archaeological grounds. The results are consonant with the predicted duration of the site between 200 and 400 years. Moreover, the sequence of dates is in conformity with the stratigraphy. Shell 21 (P-1396) is from Stratum 1 of the site, and Shell 4 (P-1393) is from deposit, which, although not securely separated from Stratum 2, appears to be contemporary with the stone tumble of Stratum 3. Before the C-14 determinations were made, the excavators wrote of Shell 21: 'Ideally this sample and Shell 4 might give the duration of the site.5 This prediction has been satisfactorily fulfilled. Shell 11 (P-1333) is from the uppermost levels of Stratum 1. Shell 2 (P-1368) is probably from Stratum 2, although the transition from Stratum 1 to 2, and from Stratum 2 to 3, was not entirely clear in this square. Soil 15 (P-1311) is from a different part of the site, and levels in this trench could not be ascribed to a specific phase. The date suggests that Vi L11 is of Stratum 1, which is entirely possible. The Radiocarbon dates thus relate extremely well to the stratigraphy at Saliagos. They present no problems in interpretation.</page><page sequence="179">NOTE ON THE MARKING CONVENTION AND THE CORRELATION OF LEVELS For the convenience of those who may wish to examine the original material, now preserved in the Paros Museum and its reserves, an explanation of the marking convention used is now given. The original records, with many unpublished drawings, will be deposited in the library of the British School of Archaeology, Athens, where they may be freely studied and copied. It should be noted that the sheer bulk of material found made it inevitable that some of the undecorated pottery and unworked obsidian and shell be discarded. The division of the levels into phases is given in Table 32. Pottery. All feature sherds were retained, together with body sherds from Squares Oi, Qj, R35 S3, S4, T2, T4. Sherds were marked with an S, followed by the Square number and a triangle enclosing the level number, e.g. S.R3 ^. Not all body sherds were marked, however, and unmarked sherds were packed in clearly labelled wooden boxes. Drawn sherds were marked also with the serial number of the drawing. TABLE 32.
