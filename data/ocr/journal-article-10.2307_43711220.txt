<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hilaire Duesberg, Les valeurs chr√©tiennes de l'Ancien Testament (Tournai: Casterman, 1960). Third, revised edition. Pp. 144. 60 B. Fr. This book's third edition does not seem to differ in any important way from the second (1951). The book is a series of essays on the OT that were given originally as conferences at the University of Strasbourg 1946-47. The fact that these essays are not neatly interrelated does not detract from their indi- vidual excellence. D.'s analysis of the reasons why Christians in general sixteen years ago were rarely found reading the OT is undoubtedly close to the truth. Summed up, these reasons amount to the fact that an intelligent reading of the OT re- quires too much effort, mainly because of the number and size of prejudices that must be overcome. The first essay notes some of these prejudices: the reader's confusion when he comes up against the archaism of the OT, his embarrassment at the OT's appearance of immorality, an inherited childish idea of sacred history which tends to make him see Bible history as different from real history, a misunderstanding of the supernatural, a tendency to neglect the human side of the sacred writer's activity, a mistaken idea that the Bible should automatically edify its reader, an impression of the OT's insignificance when placed against the background of other literature of the ancient Near East, and finally a fear that reading the OT is liable to make him lose his Chris- tian faith. To what extent these and other prejudices still haunt the minds of Christians</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 321 who would otherwise take to reading the OT is hard to say. Certainly there has been some progress even on a popular level in the work of wearing down the size of some of these prejudices over the past years. The five essays which follow the opening one on prejudices are fine treat- ments of the various subjects taken up: (1) textual, literary, historical, and internal criticism of the OT ; (2) the leading characters of the OT ; (3) God, as known by the "fathers" of the Hebrew people; (4) the saints of the OT; (5) the action of God's people - this essay is mainly about their way of writ- ing history. D. seldom gets specific about the expressed purpose of the book, namely to point out the value of the OT for Christians. He does this well in chapter 4, the essay on God as He is revealed in the OT, which this reviewer considers to be his best, when on pp. 84-85 he relates the anthropomorphism of the OT way of speaking about God to the NT fact of the Incarnation of God as ant hro pos. In his short epilogue D. mentions the liturgical and prayer value of the OT for Christians, and he concludes by calling the whole Bible the daily revelation of God. This aspect of the OT, namely as a present (and not simply past) revelation of God to men, is mentioned often by D. The problem of the OT's this-world mentality, its almost complete ignorance about a happy future life, is treated well. But one does not find a clear con- frontation of this mentality with the NT doctrine of a happy future life in terms of the question of the OT's value for Christians who have the NT. It seems to this reviewer that an idea should have been explored, namely the idea that a this-world mentality within a larger next-world mentality (realized eschatology ?) is a vitally important part of Christian faith and a part that Christians learn mainly from the OT. This could have been done in D.'s chap- ter 5 on the saints of the OT. The reviewer was puzzled by a statement on pp. 67 and 97 to the effect that God, as He is revealed in the OT, is without jealousy. Later, on pp. 124 and 126, D. is in accord with the OT theme when he names Yahweh as "le Dieu jaloux." Also a bit strange, in view of the fact that the longer version of Tb 11,9 is found only in Saint Jerome's very free rendering of that book, is the fact that D. twice (pp. 121 and 138) makes something of a point about Tobias' dog wagging its tail. D.'s connecting of the Balfour declaration with the book of Genesis on p. 118, in as much as both were concerned about rights to the land of Palestine, seems uncalled-for. In spite of these few flaws, D.'s book is bound to help any Christian who reads it to judge that the OT is very worth while indeed. He writes with and communicates zest for his subject.
