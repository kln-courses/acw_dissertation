In simplified form, it is a story of rescue, salvation and fresh beginnings, with a filmic hero and great visual ap- peal: the weighty and protective boat, the paired animals, the father who listens to God, the God who speaks, the little dove that brings an olive branch back to Noah to show him that the water has receded. It's perfect for children's picture books, and there are lots of those on the subject of Noah's Ark. Perfect for visual artists of all kinds: Paul Richmond's painting, "Noah's Gay Wedding Cruise," has recognizable celebrity gay and les- bian couples- including Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi, the latter with her hands outstretched to receive an alighting dove- all floating in a folksy wooden ship. It could almost be a picture-book illustration. The painting has plenty to say about heavenly blessings and punishment. Various critics of gayness are shown drowning in the waters below, apparently exemplars of evil, to be swept away and annihilated. Richmond is not the only artist who sees the story through the filter of his own situ- ation. The story of the Ark is potent; a source of imaginative plenitude; a frame within which we may or may not picture ourselves. This paper explores some of the implications of the Genesis story, in particular in relation to animals. The way we think of animals- as, for example, docile breeding pairs under our command- has consequences for the actions we take and the stories we tell. To write about animals at all is to "see" them in ways that cannot be disconnected from a vital narrative in- heritance of stories about animals, and this paper explores ele- ments of that inheritance. In the traditional Noah story the emphasis is on evil and sal- vation. The corrupt world is overwhelmed; people and animals are gathered closely together. They ride out the currents that, without the protection of Noah's mighty ship, would turn them into things: corpses bumping without breath or direction in the sundered timber and terracotta of wrecked civilization. Divine instruction directs proceedings, but salvation is also due to the faith and enterprise of Noah himself. Above all, the story of the Ark reinforces human authority over animals. When Harp- er's Magazine commemorated the four hundredth anniversary of the King James Bible by publishing the response of various writers to the scriptures, Benjamin Hale took issue with Gen- esis 1:26 on the grounds that "God makes man in his image [. . .] and puts all mortal creation beneath his feet"- thereby creating an influential and destructive hierarchy. Given the fact that writers are currently conspicuously preoccupied with the relationship between human and the natural world- Franzen is an obvious example- this is worth exploring further, as is the whole flood story in Genesis. The pre-flood civilization is, we are told, too "violent" for God, its creator, to endure. In the King James Genesis the problem of the pre-flood civilization isn't just violent acts, which would be bad enough, it's a human preoccupation with violence: "the wickedness of man was great in the earth [. . .] every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually." The divine solution, it seems, is to extinguish life, to destroy everything except for the quarantined community of the "just" man Noah, his family, and the paired subordinate animals. After the Ark is beached on Ararat, God renounces destruc- tion of this kind. There will be no second flood. This is good news. The reason for his decision is not so good. He gives up the job of eradicating human evil, "for," as he says, or report- edly thinks, "the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth [. . .]" This is more distressing than an expression of the futility of setting up a perfect human society. Human vicious- ness is not an aberration, the result of impassioned impulses, or the persuasiveness, among the impressionable, of ideas like the current idea of jihad or in fact any other unusual criminal and regrettable calculation. According to the King James Bible we have bad ideas, we imagine evil, and it isn't going to stop. Of course the word "imagination" here is a translator's coin- age, but it is highly influential with historically authoritative reverberations. The narratives I will discuss later are attempts to mitigate human evil, particularly by questioning the subjuga- tion of animals. In recent times there has been an eruption in the world of Ark scholars, believers and general Noah obsessives. The Guard- ian reports that the translation of an ancient text contradicts the Biblical account of the structure of Noah's Ark, describing it as a circular raft rather than a ship. The Internet is a rich source of reactions to this. Some religious scholars are con- Antipodes ♦ 5</page><page sequence="2">cerned because they think that the shape of the Ark is beside the point. Some believers think that it is very much the point, because they have absolute confidence in the story as it appears in Genesis, in which Noah's ship is not a circular raft. For some believers Noah's Ark is not just a story inspired by earlier nar- ratives of other cultures. It's unique truth. Noah and his Ark must reverberate, for them, within the specific perimeters of Genesis and a particular religious tradition. From my point of view, the alternative shape of the Ark is a constructive addition to a story of human and animal rescue. A boat is structured to displace and cut through water. In heavy seas the boat's prow cleaves through waves. A raft can be made seaworthy and maneuverable, but it has less authority in the water, and I am deeply concerned with issues of authority in the Noah story. In my imagination at least, a raft has a kind of helplessness, it slides, spins and flips more readily than a boat. Ships took the Greek army to Troy, not rafts. When ships sink, the shipwrecked salvage timber so that they may stand above the water on a raft. A raft might be the thing you build when a ship lets you down. Since the circle is an old emblem of wholeness, the round shape of the ancient reed rafts of Iran and Iraq becomes for me a consoling emblem of entirety as well as survival. It is an egalitarian shape: there is no fore or aft on a circular raft, no sense of a superior position behind the wheel or at the prow. There is no deck and no space below the deck. Importantly, for my argument, people and animals are on an equal footing. The work of the novelist J. M. Coetzee and in particular his novel Disgrace may be seen as a response to Benjamin Hale's idea that "God [. . .] put all things beneath our feet"- an idea that is active in the Genesis story and contested by Coetzee. In Disgrace, David Lurie, once a self-serving Professor of Commu- nications, subsequently a father and animal welfare volunteer, struggles with the relationship between humans and animals. David visits his daughter Lucy on a farm in the Eastern Cape area, having left his job in Cape Town after a questionable re- lationship with a student. He is a proud man, even arrogant, at the outset. He is transformed by experience. In an argument with Lucy he insists "We are of a different order of creation to the animals. Not higher, necessarily, just different." This differ- ence may lie in the belief, which David recounts, that animals lack "proper souls"- unlike people. His relationship with ani- mals changes as he observes, prior to a local celebration, two sheep destined for slaughter and tethered out of reach of food and water as if they are expendable objects, small storehouses of festive meat rather than creatures with their own basic needs. David cares for them "suddenly" and "without reason." This marks a transition in his relationship with animals. A further transition occurs when he accepts the task of sooth- ing animals, especially dogs during the process of euthanasia, made necessary- to humans at least- by overpopulation among domestic animals in this part of rural South Africa. The eutha- nasia of unwanted dogs is described as a process where "the soul is yanked out of the body; briefly it hangs about in the air, twist- ing and contorting; then it is sucked away and is gone." The animal soul moves independently of the body and it vanishes after death, if we accept the sad poetry of Disgrace. This process refutes the convenient argument that animals are without souls. Significantly, he creates a role for himself that goes beyond the care of living animals. He becomes "a dog undertaker," as he ensures that the bodies of the animals he has assisted at the end of their lives are treated with all possible dignity. It is important that he cares for animals beyond the point where they can, in a way, reciprocate his care. The dog that seems to appreciate the music he plays on a banjo, that trusts him and attaches itself to him, is killed, just like the others, and- although this is not de- scribed in the novel- the body is presumably incinerated in the standard way. No exceptions are made. There is no hierarchy of benevolent master and pet. David specifically rejects the role of animal savior: "He may not be their saviour, the one for whom they are not too many, but he is prepared to take care of them once they are [dead and] unable, utterly unable, to take care of themselves." He has been unable to save his daughter Lucy from rape at the hands of intruders. At the end of Disgrace he is an Antigone figure, the agent of an ancient injunction to treat the dead with respect- an injunction he extends, without exception, to animals. He is not Noah. Nor does he live in a world where the police can solve wrongdoing by removing offenders- in ef- fect, clearing the earth of human evil, the strategy of the original flood. He inhabits rural South Africa, where rape and theft are to be endured and the anticipated marriage of his lesbian daugh- ter Lucy is a joyless political arrangement considered, pragmati- cally, for the safety of her unborn child and for the territory in which to raise that child. The story of the Ark in its most simple 6 ❖ June 2012</page><page sequence="3">and benign form: a fantasy of biological and cultural salvation and renewal, a small safe space of people and animals, is quite distant from the environment in Disgrace . However the larger, darker Genesis story is not. It is a story about a divine promise that destruction will never be universal, but it is also a story about accepting, finally, the difficult possibility that destructive- ness has a place in the human imagination: "the imagination of man's heart" in Genesis "is evil from his youth." In his great strange story The Unnamable, Beckett's narrator refuses to repeat the words: "Man is a higher mammal"- that is, he rejects the belief, conspicuous in the story of Noah's Ark, that we have a God-given authority over other living things. The slaughterhouse is never far away from the thoughts of this Beckett narrator, who, in an earlier incarnation as Molloy, tells us of "that violent raucous tremulous bellowing not of the pas- tures, but of the towns, their shambles and cattle-markets." If man is a higher mammal, those below him might exist for his benefit alone and Beckett- like Coetzee- contests this in his fic- tion. Conventionally, cruelty is acknowledged and sympathy is tacitly extended to animals. Cattle, donkeys, pigs, cab-horses, frogs and dogs suffer at human hands in the Beckett trilogy. Molloy describes an encounter with a donkey: Toiling towards me along the tow-path I saw a team of little grey donkeys, on the far bank, and I heard angry cries and dull blows. I got down, I put my foot on the ground the better to see the approaching barge, so gently approaching that the water was unruffled. It was a cargo of nails and timbers, on its way to some carpenter, I suppose. My eyes caught a donkey's eyes, they fell to his little feet, their brave fastidious tread. There is a creaturely kinship in "My eyes caught a donkey's eyes"- and anthropomorphism in "brave fastidious tread." Giv- ing human characteristics to the donkey not only elicits pity, it establishes human and animal on a similar footing- contesting the hierarchy of human exceptionalism. There are other meth- ods in the trilogy of overturning this old and apparently God- given hierarchy. At the end of M alone Dies , the second "novel" in the trilogy, Macmann, an asylum inmate, is taken from his cell, tied to his afflicted companions, and put in a wagon, then a boat, in order to have a cheerful picnic on a local island. Starving, confused, paranoid, anorexic and generally helpless, the asylum inmates are in no state to enjoy their "excursion." The trip is the initiative of a dim and worthy aristocrat who is quickly out of her depth. She has provided sailors to ferry the party to the island. The inmates themselves are under the con- trol of a calculating psychopath: Lemuel- a name that has been translated as "beloved of God." Lemuel kills the aristocrat and two of her servants and puts to sea with his prisoners. The boat drifts in the night. There is an assurance that Lemuel, like the God of Genesis, will never again commit an act of violent eradi- cation: "Lemuel is in charge, he raises his hatchet on which the blood will never dry, but not to hit anyone, he will not hit anyone, he will not hit anyone any more, he will not touch anyone any more, either with it or with it or with it or with or [. . .]" The story breaks into fragments, its conclusion presumably coinciding with the death of its narrator Malone. Of course, there are many ways of reading this, but I read it as a parody of the story of the flood in which Lemuel is a debased Noah, the animals are the helpless and hitherto caged humans- all of the one sex, because this is a story of annihila- tion, not repopulation- and the fate of the aristocrat and her servants represents the destruction of a civilization of chari- table outings complete with tea, sandwiches and buns. All the mysteries of the Genesis flood story- the endurance of ener- getic evil and helpless subjugation- are apparent in this parody and indigent, anguished humans board a ship in the place of potentially reproductive animals. The Genesis story is imitated in such a grotesque form that its foundational assumptions on the apparently well-intentioned authority of human command, the agency of surviving animals and the nature of rescue itself are challenged. There are no doves; there is no olive branch or landfall. The narrator of The Unnamable identifies, terribly, with animal, not human life: "I'm something different, a quite different thing, a wordless thing in an empty place [. . .] like a caged beast born of caged beasts born of caged beasts born of caged beasts born in a cage and dead in a cage [. . .]" The zoo, the circus, the menagerie, the holding-pen in the slaugh- terhouse-these are the places where animals are caged and he situates himself among them in his efforts to define what he is. An earlier character in the trilogy, Moran, has a happier af- filiation with creatures. He lives in his ruined garden after the collapse of all his professional objectives: Antipodes ♦ 7</page><page sequence="4">Michael Levine Genesis VIII In the evening Noah's dove brought back change of a dollar. That set the old man to worrying right off. And then Noah saw that the dove had an olive branch, And that on the branch was a worm. For the rest of his life (some nine hundred years) Noah couldn't figure out how the worm survived the flood, or how the dove came back with coin. After everybody left the ship, the worm and the dove set up house together. In the morning, from Noah's bedroom window, he could look out and see the Ark on the mountain like the broken back of some animal that didn't make it through the Flood. When his wife asked him what he was looking at, he told Her he was looking for the rainbow and that she should go back to bed. Many years later the Ark was turned into a dance hall, Then a restaurant, then a beer parlor. Nobody knows what to make of the holy ruins. They were lovely days. [. . .] My birds had not been killed. They were wild birds. And yet quite trusting. I recognized them and they seemed to recognize me. But one never knows. Some were missing and some were new. I tried to understand their language better. Without having re- course to mine. They were the longest, loveliest days of all the year. I lived in the garden. There is exquisite humility here: "I tried to understand their language better. Without having recourse to mine." Patriarchal authority is wholly rejected and watchfulness and trust are the basis for the connection between the birds and the character. E.M. Forster, after the death of his mother, is said to have begged her, aloud, to "Stop being dead. Give it up now. Give up being dead." Of course she was unable to answer him, much less comply. The bereaved commonly long for dialogue with the dead. Part of the appeal of C. S. Lewis's Narnia stories is that they satisfy an equally potent longing for conversation with ani- mais, which is not the same as communication with them. We are bereft of dialogue, except among our living human selves, as well as being heirs to a hierarchy that sanctions the sometimes callous use of animals. The dead and the animals may be spo- ken to, they may be spoken about, but they may not be spoken with. If they have a language, as Beckett's Moran suggests, we may need to lay aside our own language to approach it- an all but impossible task. Given all of this, how may a writer such as myself consider animals within her fiction? As strange beings, observed in passing, as private totems, as old symbols within an ancient system of narrative symbolism? I do not want to relin- quish the dove and the olive branch, but rather question old and more recent stories, and keep Moran and his birds close. The bird, after all, is the creature that springs free of the Ark, that troubling and beautiful story that seems to give us reassur- ance of salvation, mastery of all animals, and finally, sadly, an admission of the fallibility of humanity. □ Acknowledgment This essay was written with the assistance of an H.
