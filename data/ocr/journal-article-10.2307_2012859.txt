<plain_text><page sequence="1">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 267 THE PERMANENT CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE PRAGMATISTS T HE word pragmatism is familiar to all students of contemporary philosophy. So much has been written about it during the last ten years that even the uninitiated must have a pretty definite idea of its aims and assumptions. When, a few years ago, the word prag- matism was first heard in philosophical circles, its denotation was to most of us vague and indefinite. Now, however, after the new doctrine has enjoyed ten years of popularity, it is time to throw a retrospective glance upon the past, and to examine its claims to a permanent place in the history of philosophy. Let me state at the outset that I do not take the word pragma- tism to mean a definite, closed system, nor do I intend to draw a hard and fast line between it and its neighbors. No word in our language expresses a single idea, definitely separated from all others. All our vocables express currents of thought, some stages of which our dic- tionaries endeavor to stereotype. But the task is impossible. These currents of thought move on; and, in time as well as in space, reflect the instability of their nature. The word aya0o's which, among anci- ent Greeks, meant good, is now translated by their descendants as meaning good-natured, and no doubt it will soon convey the idea of silliness. Even if we confine ourselves to the present time, we are struck by the flowing character of our words. Dictionaries endeavor to take different views of the flow and to give to each word a number of different meanings. But the word itself is the moving unit which no photographic apparatus can represent. It is not, therefore, to be wondered that the word pragmatism should have embraced at the outset different, nay incompatible ideas. It is well known that the man to whom the paternity of pragmatism has been so repeatedly attributed, Charles Peirce, frightened at the apparent transformation of his child, refused to recognize him any longer, and enriched philosophical dictionaries with the name prag- maticism, which, in order to avoid confusion, he destined to the original-and, according to him, sole legitimate-form of his off- spring. William James himself, although less timid, did not fail to recognize the progress of the doctrine with which his name had been so gloriously associated. When Schiller, in his volume on Humanism, so developed the pragmatic ideas as to convert them into a complete philosophical system, William James, although he defended with all his main his English confrere, could not but see that there was an abyss between such a humanism and his own original, timid principles. Nor do I believe that a satisfactory list of pragmatic philosophers could be drawn. William James no doubt identified the word prag-</page><page sequence="2">268 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY matism with his own philosophical achievements. But it is a re- markable fact that none of the other philosophers we generally classify with him has done so. So far as I know, Professor Dewey has never called himself a pragmatist. As for Henri Bergson, it has been repeatedly asserted that he is not one: "M. Henri Bergson n'est pas pragmatiste," wrote Chaumeix, "on ne trouve chez lui ni le mot ni la chose." When, a few years ago, Mr. Pitkin pointed out, in this JOURNAL, some points of divergence between the doctrines of James and Bergson, the author of the "Evolution creatrice" came bravely to the rescue of his American confrere and the discussion was apparently closed. It is, however, significant that many students of philosophy were not convinced and obstinately refused to classify Bergson as a pragmatist. On the other hand, P. Neve, in a remark- able essay on the philosophy of Bergson, which appeared in the first volume of the "Annales de l'Institut superieur de Philosophie," sees in Bergson 's philosophy the definite, permanent form of pragmatism, the form which is destined to endure and to have a permanent place in the history of philosophy. The truth is that all classifications are creations of our mind, manufactured for practical purposes, and, therefore, they are to some extent untrue. Each philosopher is but his own self. He has his own philosophical system, more or less consistent, more or less pro- found; a system, however, which is different from all others, and, only for practical purposes, can be assimilated with neighboring cur- rents of thought. And this is why philosophers hate to be classified. They feel that an injustice is done to them. James lived and thought and had a conception of the universe. The same is true of Dewey and Bergson. Each one has his own system, differing, in many respects, from all others. Strictly speaking, pragmatism does not exist. When I speak, therefore, of the permanent contributions of the pragmatists, I simply mean some permanent contributions to philos- ophy made in modern times, and chiefly insisted upon by some phil- osophers whom we more or less arbitrarily classify as pragmatists. When William James began to popularize pragmatic ideas, he described pragmatism as being simply a method for judging of the truth of doctrines through their practical consequences. Pragma- tism stood for no philosophical system whatsoever, and the Italian Papini, bolder than his master, likened it to a corridor which opens into all systems of philosophy. Not long afterwards, Professor Lovejoy was able to describe thirteen forms of pragmatism. The essential character of pragmatism was, however, according to William James, its consideration of practical results. "The prag- matic method is primarily a method of settling metaphysical disputes that otherwise might be interminable. Is the world one or many?-</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 269 fated or free?-material or spiritual?-here are notions either of which may or may not hold good of the world; and disputes over such notions are unending. The pragmatic method in such cases is to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical consequences. "' And the principle that "the true is that which works" seemed at first to take the world by storm. But its glory soon faded away. At the Congress of Heidelberg, in 1908, prag- matic doctrines met with decided hostility. According to Dr. Itelson, pragmatism is the philosophy of those who are not philosophers "nur Laien kann der Pragmatismus gefallen." And at the same Congress, pragmatism was described as a kitchen-philosophy " Prag- matismus ist eine Kuichenphilosophie." More recently, at the Inter- national Congress of Philosophy of Bologna, there arose the general impression that Schiller was not even taken seriously. And now, only five years after the death of William James, who is not struck by the contrast between the noisy reputation he so rapidly acquired during his life and the silence which now reigns around his tomb? Let us frankly confess the truth. Of all the aspects of prag- matism, the one which James mostly emphasized, namely, the con- sideration of practical results, is precisely the one that is bound to disappear. It has been pointed out by a French philosopher, whom pragmatists occasionally classify as one of their number, Gaston Mil- haud, that the disinterested character of scientific speculation is an essential condition of its progress. As long as mathematics, in the hands of the Egyptians, were directed toward practical results, they remained stationary. When, however, the Greeks, neglecting prac- tical results, applied themselves to pure, disinterested speculation, gigantic progress was made, and seemed always to be in a direct ratio with the degree of disinterestedness and the purely speculative character of the scientific researches. Among the permanent contributions of the pragmatists, there are two which I regard as most important. One of them is the temporal character of reality, as contrasted with the eternal, immutable char- acter of the same described by the absolute idealist of the last cen- tury. The other is the human element in the building up of reality. The first of these contributions does not belong to pragmatism alone. It is a tendency found in all contemporary thought. No- body perhaps has pointed it out more clearly than Professor Wood- bridge, whom no one would classify as a pragmatist. According to Woodbridge, the theory of the absolute idealist was connected with the physical discoveries of Newton and the astronomical achieve- ments of Copernicus and Laplace. In virtue of these achievements, space was regarded as the real being, in terms of which all cosmic phenomena were to be described. Duration came to be regarded as 1 James, "Pragmatism," page 45.</page><page sequence="4">270 TfE JO URNAL OF PHILOSOPHY non-essential and dismissed from the philosophical platform. And there were written, inspired by such ideas, Kant 's " Kritik der Reinen Vernunft" and Addison 's hymn "The Spacious Firmament on High. " Now, on the other hand, since Darwin has turned the atten- tion of scientists toward the evolutionary character of reality, the conception of space has ceased to be a dominant conception and time has made a solemn entry into the realm of philosophy. It is the world as becoming, not the world as "all there," which philosophers are now found to consider. It is Darwin's picture which has re- placed Newton S.2 In point of fact, the theories of the absolute idealist can be traced back to a far remoter past. Since Parmenides drew a hard and fast line between the real world and the world of appearance, the conception of a permanent, immutable reality which persists behind the fleeting phenomena has found a place in the philosophical sys- tems of all ages and all nations. In ancient Greece, there appeared Plato with his world of ideas, and, during the Middle Ages, the schoolmen, developing Aristotle's theory of the pure act, rose to the conception of an eternal, immutable Absolute, which alone is, and in which all cosmic phenomena, all worldly changes, have their being and their ultimate cause. The Hegelians have a similar conception of the Absolute. But whereas the God of the Scholastics was knowable to the buman mind only to a limited extent, the Hegelians have come to the belief that, by analyzing the logical elements of thought, they can unfold the Divine Nature and discover its arcana. Nobody, by the way, has pointed out more clearly than Professor Dewey that such a subtle anthropomorphism is the stumbling-block of the He- gelian philosophy. Pragmatists have been unanimous in discarding the idea of an immutable Absolute and in directing their attention to the flowing character of reality. Bergson, in particular, has given, in his "Evo- lution creatrice," a philosophy of evolution of which the conception of duration can be considered as the backbone. This shifting of the philosophical point of view has wrought a transformation in our conception of thought and its relation to the rest of things. Since the days of Descartes, a chasm had appeared between the mind and the external world, which nobody had been able to span. And the ghost of solipsism was there, and nobody was able to drive it away. But now that thought has become an event in the world's history, to the same degree as a storm or an earth- quake, the problem of the bridge between the mind and the world is bound to disappear as meaningless. This is why Professor Dewey simply sketches the natural history of thought in its evolution, start- 2 Cf. Woodbridge, "The Problem of Time in Modern Philosophy, " this JOURNAL, Vol. VII., pages 410 seq.</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 271 ing with the antecedents of thought, then passing to the datum of thinking, ending finally with the content and objects of thought. The other permanent contribution of the pragmatists to philo- sophical thought does not appear upon the platform of any other system, and may, therefore, be regarded as its exclusive property. It is, as we have already hinted, the human element in the building up of reality. When, for the first time, our remote ancestors formulated the laws of nature, they believed they had deciphered a page of the eternal truth. For centuries they prided themselves upon having discovered the ideas of the Infinite. But, in the course of time, their joy was brought to an end. The laws they had formulated were rejected, and new principles advocated, more in harmony with recent scientific dis- coveries. TLe new laws partook of the same fate, and at last men, delivered forever from the presumption of their ancestors, came to consider scientific laws and formulas as hypotheses, which could be accepted only temporarily, as guides in the discovery of new truths. This is why pragmatists reject all descriptions of truth as eternal and immutable, and insist upon the part played by man in its creation. When we reject an old law and put a new one in its stead, we do not thereby affirm that the old law was false and that the new one is true. Both are true to a certain extent. Both have the same right to be considered as scientific, in so far as they account for established facts and lead us to the discovery of new truths. Both are only temporary in character, because there is always present the possi- bility of new discoveries which will make a new formula imperative. The Ptolemaic system of the universe was as strictly scientific as the Copernican system. By its means, the ancients accounted for the different positions of the planets. They did so by referring them to the earth as to a center. To-day, based upon the principle that the earth moves around the sun and that the sun is motionless, we account for the same positions of the planets by referring them to the sun. But the motionless character of the sun is only a fiction, and possibly some day a new cosmical theory will replace the heliocentric system, which, although more perfect than the Ptolemaic, is never- theless to a certain extent arbitrary. The same arbitrary character is found in all other sciences: in biology, in history, in philology. In them all we classify for con- venience sake, following the bent of our intelligence which could not otherwise embrace reality. In biology, we divide living beings into animals and vegetables. But we are bound to confess that between the animal and the vegetable kingdom no hard and fast line can be drawn. We are even at a loss when we want to formulate any essen- tial characteristic which distinguishes the one realm from the other.</page><page sequence="6">272 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY According to the scholastics, the animal is that which moves itself. But many beings endowed with motion are classified as vegetables. Without mentioning the insectivorous plants, which are able to get hold of insects and to digest them, we are all aware of the fact that many bacteria are endowed with free and spontaneous motion. And yet bacteriologists are unanimous in classifying them as belonging to the vegetable kingdom. Nowadays biologists have come to the conclusion that the most characteristic difference between the animal and the vegetable king- dom lies in the mode of alimentation. The vegetable is able to assimi- late simple elements, whereas the animal feeds upon organized bodies. But here again, many cases can be adduced in which the law does not hold. Although bacteria are able to obtain their nourishment from much simpler chemical substances than most animal cells, yet they can not use some of the substances which are assimilable by the green plants. Moreover, who ignores that the drosera, the dionaea, and the pinguicula can feed upon insects, and that mushrooms have the same mode of alimentation as animals. This arbitrary character of scientific truth is found not only in general laws. In all our perceptions we choose between images, we accentuate some, we neglect others, although they all possess the same interest in so far as pure knowledge is concerned. We thus more or less arbitrarily divide the material world into independent bodies. But their independence is fictitious and created by ourselves for practical purposes. And thus, as James puts it, the world is really malleable, waiting to receive its final touches at our hands. Man engenders truths upon it. The Italian pragmatist, Papini, enthusiastic at the sight of this newly discovered role of man in the building up of the body of scien- tific truth, grew dithyrambic over the view that it endows man with creative, divine functions. Bergson is more modest. According to him man, it is true, creates the world of science. But, in so doing, he deforms reality to a certain extent. And the function of phil- osophy is, therefore, to undo what science has done; and, forgetting that we are intelligent beings, to try to penetrate by means of in- stinct into the pure, virgin reality which the hand of man has not touched. Pragmatism has conquered a permanent place in the history of philosophy. Some of its early contributions are, in my opinion, destined to die; and I would place among these the belief that the truth of a theory is to be found by tracing its respective practical consequences. But the pragmatists will ever have the glory of hav- ing pointed out the human element in the building up of the body of scientific truths. To them belongs the honor of having accurately expressed the value of hypothesis in science. Moreover, they have</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 273 insisted upon the importance of time in all philosophical accounts of reality, and have thereby associated their name with the philosophy of evolution.
