<plain_text><page sequence="1">Animate Objects: Being, Obsolescence and the Limits of Citizenship in G6mez de la Serna Robert A. Davidson I. Introduction In The Vision Machine, Paul Virilio cites the painter Paul Klee's subtle, paranoiac phrase, "Now objects perceive me" as a means of introducing his closing arguments regarding the innovation of arti- ficial vision (Virilio 59). Klee's words are suggestive and germane to more than theories of telematics and speed phenomena; they apply also to a discussion of how "things" seemingly assumed a sense of self-a subjectivity of objects-within the rapidly evolving discourses of early twentieth-century modernism. This type of treatment of the inorganic is especially intriguing in the writings of Ram6n G6mez de la Serna (1888-1963), the Madrid-based "godfather" of the Castilian avant-garde.1 The works of Ram6n (as he was known), particularly those from the 1910s and '20s, abound with examples of "animate" objects, the list of which includes mannequins, chimneys, trains, and streetlamps, 'A self-declared "one-man generation," Ram6n brought futurism to the Castilian public in 1910 with his "Proclama futurista a los espafioles" (G6mez de la Serna "Proc- lama"). Regarding the timing of his appearance on the scene in Spain, Ugarte's insightful observation that "as one of the few canonical Spanish writers without a generation, ... he compensates for this temporal absence with the attention to space" helps explain the importance of the built environment to Ram6n (Ugarte 106).

While the ontological status of objects in Ram6n is the overall subject of my project, what I aim to do specifically is to push further than previous considerations of the material world in his work and consider not only how Ram6n's privileging of objects brings them to life-literally--as co-citizens alongside human characters but also look at how their innate obsolescence as things conditions a general understanding of the inanimate in Ram6n's work as a whole. I begin by establishing a theoretical understanding of "community" as it relates to the narrated built environment. This in turn allows me to pinpoint how Ram6n animates the inanimate and to explore such a being's case for citizen- ship within the precincts of the author's urban world. Having thus considered the animate object's "birth" and possible integration as a citizen, I engage the other finite extreme: the ostensible death of the object through obsolescence, a phenomenon that I read in the light of Ram6n's valorization of the flea market and his own status as Collector. Given the author's double treatment of the object-as co-inhabitant with humans on the one hand and as drained matter recuperated as a collectible on the other-the question arises as to what effect the object's innate, inescapable obsolescence in death has on the limited form of citizenship it claims in life. I. a) Ram6n G6mez de la Serna The eclectic writings of Ram6n G6mez de la Serna revolve around the modern city with Madrid and Paris serving as important, yet contrasting models. Early in his career, this interest in urban life manifested in subjects such as the circus and the Spanish capital's labyrinthine flea market, the Rastro. During the 1920s, his fascination for the varied spectacles of the city evolved into a more pronounced narrative exploration of the phantasmagoria associated with mod- ern consumerism and the experience of the European metropolis. Ram6n's short fiction and oft-ignored novels of the period are replete in this regard. In Ram6n, the city is exalted as a staging ground for modernity. Nevertheless, he reveals it as a place of potential alienation and neurasthenia also. This duality is remarkable across the range of 2 His novels from this period are witnessing a critical renaissance due to their treatment of gender issues as well as the rich material that they contain for cultural studies.</page><page sequence="3">276 ROBERT A. DAVIDSON narrative genres that he employed, from the concise gregueria, to the longer capricho, to the novel. G6mez de la Serna's narrators are almost exclusively urbanites and they explore the streets constantly aware of the minutiae of their built environment. This precise detailing is frequently both metaphorically and literally scattered. Critics almost universally attribute this effect to Ram6n's reliance on greguerias, the short, witty aphorisms that are the author's bread and butter." Throughout his career, he wrote thousands of greguerias and compiled them in various collections. While it is difficult to give a blanket definition for this mutable genre, a frequently cited formula has that the gregueria is the result of the addition of humor to metaphor. However, the type of humor can vary greatly; it can range from wry wit ("La gasolina es el incienso de la civilizaci6n" [Gasoline is the incense of civilization]) to visual plays on text itself ("La Xes el cors6 del alfabeto" [The letter X is the corset of the alphabet]) (G6mez de la Serna, Greguerias 121, 137). Surprise is often a crucial element. Through shock the gregueria succeeds in de- centering the reader's established perceptions of things and actions. This sudden rearticulation of signifier and/or signified is in keeping with the central tenets of the artistic avant-garde's aesthetic challenge to "traditional" art during the beginning of the twentieth century. Additionally, the frequent inclusion of technological elements and the artistic enshrinement in text of modern, everyday occurrences not only signal Ram6n's vanguard sympathies vis-a-vis the lyrical interpretation of modernity, but also his intense mania for the physical components that constitute and "populate" the modern environment. The gregueria remains essential in Ram6n's novelistic and shorter narrative production. It is a building block for his prose and often the base upon which the author expands core inspirations-frequently in what strikes the reader as a haphazard manner. That said, even if the gregueria is the lowest common denominator of G6mez de la Serna's fiction, rather than view it as an aspect of irremediable fragmenta- tion, I suggest that it is better considered as a minute manifestation of a predominantly urban reality in which multiple and simultaneous experiences defeat the possibility of a totalizing representation. This, I believe, is more in keeping with the overwhelming urbanity of the gregueria. Just as a multitude of elements combine, realign, disperse and collide to make up a city, the gregueria may be considered a fun- damental part of the accretive process of Ram6n's writings, a body of 3See Richmond 47-48.</page><page sequence="4">MLN 277 work that so often focuses on-and I suggest, reflects (although not exclusively)-the urban experience.4 So with this in mind, the next step is to move away from these minute elements of urban modernity and examine a larger stage, one where it is possible to consider the author's narrated universe in a more general sense so as to examine the existential status and actions of the denizens that compose it. II. Birth: Common Space and Community The detailed built environment that Ram6n presents via his narrators is of utmost importance to understanding the "life" of objects in his work. He pays particular attention to the ephemera of modernity; disparate objects, unique and banal city moments, as well as the entire gamut of urban sensorial experience become subjects. That Ram6n goes further than a simple geographic mapping of known built space is crucial to understanding his treatment of inanimate matter. He fills his universe to the brim with things and, at the same time, highlights specific experiences out of the countless possibilities that the city offers, thus creating a flexible and adaptable common space that, due to its basis in the utter variety of the urban, also resists being labeled any sort of homogenous totality. This flexibility relies also on the fact that the agency within the common space is not exclusively that of "animate" beings, that is, human characters. The very things that adorn and comprise the common, built space are liable almost at any moment to disengage from the commonality and manifest as characters or actors in their own right. While this imaginative form of privileging is an author's (or narrator's) prerogative, what is of interest here is the theoretical and philosophical machinery at work that permits this radical redefinition of being. In order to better grasp what Ram6n accomplishes when he elevates inanimate objects to the same ontological status as humans within the context of a common space such as the city, it is helpful to turn to the preliminary stages of Jean-Luc Nancy's theory of community 4 For a far-reaching analysis of the differences between "creation" and "accumulation" cities in modernist and post-modernist contexts, see Doevendans and Schram. In an observation that glides very close to G6mez de la Serna's fictional response to the city, the authors note that in Georg Simmel's impressionistic, sign-oriented, accumulation city (a category to which the urban context of Spain in the 1920s pertains), the only way that an individual could deal with the accumulation experience was by "the reduc- tion of urban reality to objective culture-a rational culture in which the urbanite's behaviour was increasingly reduced to playing 'roles"' (38).</page><page sequence="5">278 ROBERT A. DAVIDSON and power. In his book The Inoperative Community, the Frenchman asserts that "the political is the place where community as such is brought into play" (Nancy xxxvi). That is, power relations (and not just force) are dependent on community acting as the site or locus where specific existence occurs, what Nancy calls the existence of "being-in-common" (xxxvi). Individual beings, then, in addition to having the dimension of "being-self," manifest this "in-common" aspect of existence also. The "common," though, is not uniform; it does not level nor homogenize. One's appropriation of a self is thus part of a mode of existence in which a differential exposition to the in-common exposes the distinctiveness of the self in what is, in fact, its own isolation (xxxvii).5 It is interesting to note that in his articulation of the co-originary status of being-self and being-in-common, Nancy remarks that the appropriation of a self does not necessarily, nor exclusively, refer to an individual (xxxvii). He is doubtless thinking here of a State or Fatherland as a potential subject but I believe that it is also possible and productive to consider the object or thing that becomes animate in Ram6n according to the same criteria.6 My use of "common space" as the architectural and physical base from which Ram6n's objects and things are "born" is in keeping with Nancy's understanding of the "common" in that I see common space as being necessarily a multi-textured, diverse environment and as such, not uniform in its totality. What is more, the city in Ram6n is neither a space of immanence nor transcendence; as Nancy observes, "Being in common has nothing to do with communion, with fusion into a body, into a unique and ultimate identity that would no longer be exposed" (xxxvii). More precisely according to the philosopher: "Being in common means, to the contrary, no longer having, in any form, in any empirical or ideal place, such a substantial identity, and sharing this (narcissistic) 'lack of identity"' (xxxvii). In a word, being in common is to have finitude. Having reached what, at first glance, seems to be the paradoxical separation inherent in community, I can now identify the crucial rupture in the state of being that occurs in G6mez de la Serna. 5For Nancy, "'to be exposed' means to be 'posed' in exteriority, according to an exteriority, having to do with an outside in the very intimacy of an inside" (xxxvii). One's face is exemplary: "'my' face always exposed to others, always turned toward an other and faced by him or her, never facing myself (xxxvii-viii). 6 Mario Perniola's radical and thoroughly original Sex Appeal of the Inorganic moves along the same line but at a more fundamental level. By positing a theory of the "thing that feels" he proposes nothing less than a different, neuter sexuality; see Perniola 10-11.</page><page sequence="6">MLN 279 Ram6n takes the object out of the common space of the built environ- ment-what I see as the base of his urban cosmovision-and makes it in common, thereby exposing the object's finitude and singularity as a newly defined being. Joined to the subsequent narrative treatment of the thing-turned-subject, this move lays the groundwork for a reading of community and subsequently, "object" citizenship. III. Object Citizenship: Stages of Integration Even if one acknowledges and accepts the ostensible "being" of objects in Ram6n, in what sense is it possible or justified to make the con- ceptual leap between a reading of the author's formerly inanimate subjects as city dwellers to one of them as citizens? What form of citi- zenship could be extended to include these characters? An important first step towards answering these questions is to recognize that the common-space of Ram6n's world(s) is not held together by ethical imperatives of a common good but rather is based on a different social economy altogether: one linked intimately to the materiality of the modern urban center and the ontological value patent in the animation of the inanimate. In Ramon, animation adds value in the sense that it augments the sum of urban experience. This valoriza- tion is the opposite of the "inanimation" of the animate that leads to reification in Marx. From this perspective, I contend that a previously inert object's animation and manifestation as a being-in-common is participation enough to satisfy the fundamental integrative demands that citizenship makes. In Ramon's narrated world, the urban object's integration is brought about in different stages. First, there is the basic shift from inanimate to animate, a radical assimilation into a new category of being that incorporates the recognition of an individual's multiple societal roles-a notion that has come to be an integral part of meditations on the nature of cosmopolitanism, itself an expansive and encom- passing conceptualization of citizenship. Then, in specific cases, one sees a more direct engagement in urban society through forms of communication and interaction. In addition to the fantastic bring- ing into life of what was once inanimate, its finitude-no matter how slight-points to the possible elevation of the new city dweller to the status of an integrated "citizen." It is at this point that the potential for a new urban community is realized and an understanding of citi- zenship is articulated that revolves around both elementary praxis and a reconception of the material in the sense that constituent</page><page sequence="7">280 ROBERT A. DAVIDSON elements of the environment become charged with a radical poten- tiality heretofore unacknowledged. This potentiality is anchored in large part to the simple act of recognition. To quote Bill Brown, "as they circulate through our lives, we look through objects (to see what they disclose about history, society, nature, or culture-above all, what they disclose about us), but we only catch a glimpse of things" (4).7 When objects assume (or are granted) a state of being-in-common in Ram6n, they set themselves apart from the environment that they had helped previously to compose or mediate in a material sense.8 In that instant, they enter the realm of the city dweller even as-impor- tantly-wthey maintain their signifying power as object, an aspect that will regain prominence later in their "lives." As with human subjects, their existence is both that of being-self and being-in-common. Playing on this, the narrators' detailed attention to them makes the reader conscious that they are something extraordinary, that they are out of the common(-)place and thus, they assume the same recognition as a being that humans do within the diegesis. My exploration of object citizenship in Ram6n circumvents the issue of legal representation that often figures as a first litmus test; instead, Ijump to a reflection on the intricacies and subtleties of more integrated models that are more apt for an analysis of fiction than for example, legally or constitutionally defined thresholds of pertinence. This is not a gratuitous evasion; Richard Dagger, who refers to a form of republican liberalism that goes beyond Rousseau's individually based one, sees an ethically driven integrative model as being one way to supersede legalistic interpretations of citizenship.9 Dagger's insistence on integration is a compelling one and a useful guide-wire in navigating citizenship's multiple interpretations and constraints. That the trick lies in whether Ram6n's object citizens may fulfill any minimal ethical conditions does not disqualify comparison. What it 7Here, I do not distinguish necessarily between object and thing but deal with the larger categories of animate and inanimate. This is because the crux of my treatment of Ram6n lies more in the shift between ontological categories and less in the recep- tion of such. SThis recognition and additional attention to what was previously "transparent" is often predicated on the fact that basic elements of the object's very literal animation are not broached. How, for instance, do the animate streetlamps in Ram6n's El novelista move about? 9See Dagger 98-116. Nor, for that matter, are legal interpretations of citizenship limited to considerations of human subjects. Take for example, the various rights and liabilities of things, the representation of the environment and the personification of corporations documented by Miguel Tamen; see Tamen 87-90; 100-110.</page><page sequence="8">MLN 281 does entail is first a revaluing of participation as the principal consid- eration of what citizenship is-a lowest common denominator, so to speak-and second, an assessment of how the nature of obsolescence, which is particular to the life of the object, informs and challenges an overall interpretation of object citizenship within Ram6n. III. a) Chimneys and Streetlamps Two compelling cases in Ram6n's oeuvre are at the core of these thoughts. In the author's extended treatises on chimneys and gas streetlamps, he integrates two multitudinous and very visible elements of the European built environment of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries into his fiction as characters. In both cases, the objects come alive; they speak and interact. Ram6n's treatments of them are significant especially in that each involves a separate take on documenting subjectivity. The story of the chimneys verges on eth- nography, an expository style that has the dual effect of consolidating the being of the object in a quasi-scientific manner while revealing enough about the narrator so that a reflexive element emerges, which in turn underlines the object's being-in-common vis-f-vis its human counterparts in the city. The tale of a sentient streetlamp, on the other hand, offers a direct characterization of the object in question. The author anthropomorphizes it through narrative and in so doing confers on it a life beyond its existence as a simple inanimate thing. Then, he details its interactions with human society and members of its own "community." While the premises of these stories may sound surrealistic at best and absurd at worst, they contribute in an impor- tant way to the diversification of the treatment of the inanimate in Ram6n and provide the basis for the application of Nancy's concept of being-in-common to the writer's work. These two key pieces are more extensive than those for which the author was-and is-best known; they provide more space for devel- opment. When G6mez de la Serna turns his gaze and wit on objects and imbues them with human characteristics or tendencies in the one-line greguerias or shorter caprichos, for instance, the dual process of author-initiated anthropomorphosis and reader recognition is instantaneous and fleeting. There is no continuity as the surprising rupture effectuated by metaphor briefly illuminates the personified object. This is evident in greguerias such as: "Prefiero las maiquinas de escribir usadas porque ya tienen experiencia y ortograffa" [I prefer used typewriters because they already have experience and know how</page><page sequence="9">282 ROBERT A. DAVIDSON to spell], or "El tranvia aprovecha las curvas para llorar" [The tram takes advantage of curves so it can cry] (G6mez de la Serna, Greguerias 101, 82). Likewise, in the brief capricho, "Train Crash" the narrator ascribes the collision to the sensual desire of two locomotives fed-up with seeing each other only from a distance (Obras completas 91). The humorous pay-off in the punch-line may inspire some brief, retrospec- tive reflection on the nature of objects but not to the same extent as in G6mez de la Serna's longer narrative work, where the integrative aspects of their animation manifest to a greater degree and thus, address a more sophisticated ontology. Ram6n's collection, Greguerias (1917), includes various narrative "intermissions" that break up the litany of shorter works. Here one finds the first version of "Las dramiticas chimeneas," the detailed eth- nographic piece on rooftop chimneys.10 G6mez de la Serna's narrator begins by focusing on these objects' physical place in the common space of the city, the heterogeneous site of the narrator's imaginative fieldwork. But there is something more to these rooftop entities than meets the eye. Not only do they "survive" the elements rather than weather them, in a description that foreshadows a more active agency and reciprocal relationship in regards to their surroundings, Ram6n points out that they bestow "una extrafia y sincera realidad a la ciudad" [a strange and sincere reality on the city] ("Las dramiticas" 164). Gradually in the piece, the sense of physical location or site is inflected by a metaphorical place of belonging and specificity. In this way, the chimney's category of being is questioned through a subtle form of empathy, an effect that the ethnographic elements of the narrative stress. The narrator teases this thread by suggesting that the chimneys merit consideration as their own group or pueblo given that they are "la mais elevada categoria de la ciudad" [the haughtiest class of the city], a feature that distinguishes them not in terms of the common architectural space but now, rather, in direct relation to the humans who inhabit it, thus signaling a shift in the social referent (164). As "Las dramiticas chimeneas" progresses, the chimneys become more distinct. The narrator's detailed observations privilege them to such an extent that they separate irrevocably from their inanimate environment. A key moment in their movement towards being-in- common occurs when the narrator directly contrasts them to the other objects that are found on the "angled streets" of the roofs (167). '0Ram6n made important additions to the story in a later version from 1925, which I detail below.</page><page sequence="10">MLN 283 Specifically, when compared to the lively, "autochthonous" chimneys, the crosses, apses, telegraph poles, weathercocks and lightning rods merely make up a "blind still-life" of the rooftops (167). This ekphrastic description further consigns the chimney's former colleagues to the static-although varied-background of the common space and assigns the narrator's subjects to a different category. The pictorial metaphor contributes to their differentiation; it renders them in relief. Ram6n's narrator's qualitative treatment of the chimneys brings the reader into closer contact with the objects in question, lessen- ing the distance between the animate and the ostensibly inanimate. For instance, by using the impersonal Spanish "se" in the following, "Cuando se es de hierro no se tiene frfo ni calor" [When one is made of iron, one gets neither cold nor hot], Ram6n invokes a "one" of being that jumps across ontological boundaries, thus impelling the human subject to project towards a fictional condition and imagine a state in which he/she were made of metal (172). The line that fol- lows reinforces this displacing effect by referring to the reader's own condition as weak flesh and bone in an alienating manner. In the 1925 version of "Las dramaticas chimeneas," a chimney's own statement hints at an omnipresence rooted in their multiplicity as part of the streetscape. Its words present a problem, however. Speak- ing directly to the reader, the animate object says: "Somos unas y las mismas en todas partes .... Si aquif te despedimos alli te acogeremos" [Everywhere we are one and the same .... If we say good bye to you here, we welcome you there] (G6mez de la Serna, Caprichos 17). If, as the chimneys say, they are one and the same in all places, how then to reconcile this fact with Ram6n's assurance that they signal the differentiated essence of any one city in particular (Paris, Lon- don, etc.) (Las dramaticas chimeneas 170-71)? I would suggest that as with his earlier observations regarding foreign types, here one finds signification along both axes of these animate objects' being. On the one hand, they identify their respective cities; their distinctiveness as part of the common-space communicates a differential sense of place. This springs out of their being-as-object, of how they form(ed) part of the backdrop. At the same time, though, the author offers that these chimneys are "los mis sabios e imparciales interpretes de la ciudad" [the wisest and most impartial interpreters of their cities] (170). Here he provides an interpretive angle that alludes to a hermeneutic element that goes beyond mere signification as object and refers instead to their capacity to actively communicate meaning as subjects in addition to comprising it. This ability would point towards the idea of finitude</page><page sequence="11">284 ROBERT A. DAVIDSON in that it invokes again the question of what to do with the signifying aspect of the chimney-as-object that ties it to one specific place. The resolution to this apparent contradiction turns on their potentiality as animate subjects. If their own essence as objects does not change, then the variation must be found elsewhere-in their comportment, perhaps. That is to say, it lays in their behavior as finitudes, in the nature of their participation in modern urban life, a component that invites a qualitative consideration of their engagement. The chimneys' ground-level counterparts in Ram6n's world of potentially animate objects are the gas street lamps. These main- stays of nineteenth and early twentieth-century cities are frequently mentioned throughout his oeuvre. They receive marquee treatment in the author's metafictional novel, El novelista, a story in which the roving novelist of the title, Andr6s Castilla, partakes in what he deems to be a form of idolatry by developing a novel with a street lamp as protagonist. The eventual product of this desire, an engaging novella entitled Elfarol 185, is one of El novelista's many stories-within-a-story. Unlike "Las dramiticas chimeneas," both an implied narrator and an intradiegetic author mediate Ram6n's extended take on the Spanish capital's street lamps." This fact may temper its own ethnographic aspects but, because the characterization highlights both the rela- tionship between human being and animate object as well as the latter's condition as living thing, the story provides important clues nonetheless vis-a-vis the possibility of a more fully developed form of pertinence to one or more group. The first step in the process of extricating the street lamps from their urban background and integrating them into the realm of active city dweller is Castilla's authorial intention. A long-time admirer of the city's street lamps, the "finicos dioses que ha realizado el hombre" [only gods realized by man], he stakes his worth as a novelist on his ability to write a work about them (G6mez de la Serna, El novelista 139). Tellingly, in order to find and extricate the novel he sees within his surprising subjects, Castilla seeks a telepathic relation with one lamp in particular. Whereas this same tactic was employed by the anonymous narrator of "Las dramaticas chimeneas" in an ethnographic way, here, the pres- ence of a recognizable character in Castilla suggests the possibility of "I follow in Spires's footsteps when it comes to how to deal with the posited author of El novelista in that when I mention "Ram6n" in regards to that work, I mean "the image of the author created by his own text"--as does Spires in his article on the "New Woman" in the novel; see Spires 207.</page><page sequence="12">MLN 285 direct cross-communication between objects and human subjects in Ram6n's diegetic urban universe. That the communicative attempt proves impossible in the fully modernized Paris but manageable in a less-developed Madrid offers a tantalizing glimpse at the way in which the relationship between human and object in Ram6n is directly linked to urban geography and to technological development. As the reader learns, in contrast to the models in Paris that illuminate history proudly, the lamps in the Spanish capital stand out as being "more human," and with whom it is easier to talk (140-41). The intercalated novel that results from this dialogue marks the integration of a previously inanimate object into the animate sphere-its finitude. Being-in-common in the story is exemplified in the precise nar- rative treatment of one streetlamp in particular: 185. By focusing on a single example from the network of metal beacons in the city, naming "him," and then allowing the reader to hear his thoughts, Ram6n does the same for a seemingly inanimate object as he does for any anonymous human character that is plucked out of the urban maelstrom and defined by the text dedicated to him/her. The story of 185 takes place over some thirty years but given its fragmented presentation alongside the other novels of El novelista, the reader is only privy to certain parts of it and forced to assume the existence of unseen chapters of the manuscript. These gaps notwithstanding, the sense that this animate object ages like humans do is still palpable. The anthropomorphization extends also to the realm of sexual desire and a reader familiar with Ram6n's other male characters will recognize a familiar eroticization in 185's perspective on women. All in all, even though El farol 185's portrayal of the life of the inanimate is buried somewhat by the diegetic levels of El novelista, it remains Ram6n's most overt treatment of an animate object as a fully-fledged being existing side-by-side with humans. III. b) Communication and Participation Once Ram6n and his narrators have pulled objects out of the urban background, and granted them a narrative profile like that of a human character, linking systems between the finite "individuals" are described so as to lay the basis for the second phase of the integra- tive process: that which brings them into a social group that includes human characters as well. These links are their way of communicat- ing, both between themselves and the rest of the world. In the case of the chimneys, I have already mentioned that their form conveys</page><page sequence="13">286 ROBERT A. DAVIDSON meaning to both the city and the individual. At the same time, Ram6n identifies telegraph wires, birds, owls, and bats as delivery systems for the transmission of information between members of the group. The lampposts' community is laid out in more detail as the narrator reveals that they actually speak to one another and that they are surprisingly locomotive-to the extent that they are capable of gathering in groups when need be. These communicative aspects of the chimneys' and the lampposts' existences bear mention precisely because they contribute to an understanding of the individual object as a finite being. That is, the need for a communication system or an ability to articulate their own personal ideas suggests that within G6mez de la Serna's concep- tion of the urban, knowledge or experience is not immanent to all. In the absence of a totalized state of being-animate or not-then, participation, a defining feature of an integrated notion of citizenship, emerges as a key aspect. A closer examination of El farol 185 is helpful in understanding how this participatory element comes to the fore of any discussion of integration and citizenship. Ram6n does not begin the piece imme- diately with the individual lamp. Rather, in the same ethnographic vein as "Las dramiticas chimeneas," he offers some general observa- tions. These comments serve to position the lamps as city dwellers intimately connected to the lives of humans both through the physi- cal experience of the built environment and in their complex role in the maintenance of a shared civic memory as witnesses and unwilling protagonists. This relationship revolves around the fact that these urban subjects inhabit an alternate time of the city-the night-even as they occupy the same space as humans do and indeed, facilitate the sharing of that space through their use function: "El mundo de los faroles es un mundo vivo que goza horas que no vive nadie, que nadie ve .... Han tenido la suerte de vivir la hora mis fria y de mis p~nico del mundo en sus esquinas, plantados como guardias en la calle sin guardias. Son una clase de testigos presenciales admirables" [The world of the streetlamps is a lively world that enjoys a time of day during which nobody else lives, an hour that nobody sees .... They have been lucky to live the coldest hour, the hour of the most panic in the world on their corners, planted like guards on unguarded streets] (142).12 '2For detailed studies of lighting and night life in Europe, see Schivelbusch and Schl6r, respectively.</page><page sequence="14">MLN 287 The reader of Elfarol 185 quickly discovers that the range of interac- tion between humans and streetlamps is vast in Ram6n's mind. From the simple gregueria-esque way in which they read the newspapers over the shoulders of night watchmen, to the intimate relationship with the lamplighters who visit daily and effect repairs, their presence amongst us has led to a long history of dealings. The location of individual lamps appears to be key in terms of the way that they actively fit into a larger conception of what the city represents as a whole. In the descriptions of a Madrid rail yard, for instance, the reader detects an element of duty in the way that the lamps are said to contribute to the locomotives' "important mission" as part of a complicated urban transport system (144). Likewise, the streetlights that exist on the extreme limits of the city, standing guard and delineating the form of the metropolis as a territorial marker, are said to be the most "heroic" since they face their fears at the edge of the urban abyss, always more prone to being either forgotten or shattered (144). Here, one sees traces of Ram6n's Rastro-inspired vision of the city's outskirts com- bined with an ethically-infused conception of just what the limits of the metropolis represent politically. Even as he details the lamps' subtle, subjective interests on one hand and dutiful service as objects on the other, Ram6n moves to place them on equal footing and make them more than simple servants to the humans who run the city. He does this by ramping up their anthropomorphism in advance of his specific narrative treatment of 185. More precisely, Ram6n points out that the built environment in general, and streetlamps in particular, have often been victims of human uprisings and revolutions, collateral damage in a growing age of urban strife.'" As a result of this suffering, a rebellious spirit has taken hold in them and they are now "rebeldes servidores del Ayuntamiento con ideas propias" [rebel servants of City Hall with their own ideas] (145). Their attitude has important consequences in terms of their possible full integration into the legal and ethical framework of citizenship and is expressed in the basic terms of their franchise: "Ciudadanos que no votan a nadie porque han renunciado al envilecido sufragio" [(They are) citizens that don't vote for anybody because they have renounced the degraded suffrage] (145). What is more, the lamps are liberating objects, as evidenced by 185's conten- tion that: "Todo lo que esta iluminado en la noche por un farol como "'For an analysis of the phenomenon of lantern smashing, see Schivelbusch 97-114.</page><page sequence="15">288 ROBERT A. DAVIDSON yo, goza de su independencia, y para fortalecerse se da esa ducha de luz de gas que brota de mi" [All that is illuminated at night by a lamp such as I, enjoys its freedom, and so as to strengthen itself it bathes in the gaslight that springs from me] (154). Thus, while the reader sees hints of the streetlamps as possibly duty-minded citizens, Ram6n's extrication of them from both the common-space of the city and the shackles of their use value as objects undermines the service aspect of their being and even points to a rebellious streak. How then to characterize these denizens of the city? While it is true that through their use value (nocturnal illumination) they help to expand the temporal limits of day-to-day human activity, Ram6n's simultaneous portrayal of them as animate objects in their own right push them into a new category that is ultimately conditioned by their durability, a notion that leads to a discussion of obsolescence. The ability to persevere and withstand the ravages of time means that the lamp's role as witness has the possibility to expand to that of chronicler or even monument. Consider the narrator's words regarding human obsolescence in this light: "Nadie ni nada presencia la vida como un farol .... El solo guardarai un poco de nuestro tiempo del ayer para el tiempo de mafiana, cuando ya no estemos" [No one or nothing observes life like a streetlamp .... He alone will keep a little of our time of yesterday for the time of tomorrow, when we are no longer here] (261). Given such detailed behavior, it is tempting to assign Ram6n's animate objects a fully fledged position as urban citizen. The shadow of obsolescence does loom, however, exhorting consideration of the finality of an object's finitude as a being-in-common and how their material existence may or may not reassert itself and sabotage the continuance that is implicit in ethical civil society. To address these questions is to return to a work that Ram6n wrote at the beginning of his career and then-importantly-revisited some fifteen years later during the height of his meditations on the city and the object. IV. Death: Obsolescence and the Rastro A major component of Ram6n's treatment of the object has to do with its death. He begins his examination of this end phase of its life early on in a book published in 1914 called El Rastro. That he then revisits the theme in a revised edition in 1931 is significant in that it underlines a continued fascination with the inanimate through the most important and fruitful period of his career. An "anti-guide" of Madrid's sprawling market of the same name, El Rastro offers an eclectic</page><page sequence="16">M LN 289 inventory of the spent, lost, and stolen materials that the centrifugal forces of modernization and obsolescence have pushed to the outskirts of the metropolis. Given its suburban location and materialist "drama" as a concentrated collection of incredibly disparate objects, Ram6n presents the space as one of an alternate urban condition that exists outside the ken of the city center. Its status as a condition invokes an international connection between cities through their own versions of the Rastro and at once challenges locality even as a certain imprinting of Madrid's specificity appears to reinforce it. Critics who have studied El Rastro often cite Ram6n's use of the sea metaphor to describe its materialist dynamic and it is clear that the "continent" that surrounds this inner sea of objects is capitalist production (G6mez de la Serna, El Rastro 80). The passing of a thing into a state of disuse due to the relentless march of progress or its incidental damage entails its removal from active service or from the tension of use value.14 Through his concentration on Madrid's Rastro, Ram6n not only writes what he knows best but also invariably ties his treatment of the inanimate to Spain's experience of the material aspects of modernity. In this sense, the object's obsolescence and inevitable accretion-no matter its provenance-are linked to how humans interact with their built and manufactured environment in a context that is coded as Spanish. As much as Ram6n will succeed in animating the inanimate in his later works, the effects of modernization, fashion, and commodity fetishism that are on display in El Rastro indicate that the separation of the object from the common space is unsustainable or at least must be continually renewed. Thus, I would suggest that what one sees cast aside is more residue than detritus. That is to say, what is left after the process of animation is not any old thing in a precarious condition but rather, as Ram6n states in his prologue: "things at rest in their moment of peace and charity after the exodus from life" (81). Thus, the reader sees that even early on Ram6n was conceptualizing the inanimate not as a fundamental, fixed category but as a potentially mutable state. The finitude bestowed by being-in-common combined with the eventual obsolescence and/or disrepair of the thing simply as thing points us to the way in which latency (residue, trace, literally ser un rastro) is at play in Ram6n's depiction of the flea market and its role in the life cycle of objects that can and do come alive in his work. '4For a reading of El Rastro as a "field of vision," see Bush.</page><page sequence="17">290 ROBERT A. DAVIDSON So, just as "inanimation" is not static, the Rastro (understood here as an urban condition) is not an ultimate repository. Things disap- pear, they move on, degrade, vanish into thin air, and in some cases become eternal markers of the flea market space. Where and why they go, though, is crucial to understanding how Ramon's conception of the object's endgame influences the role of citizen that they assume during their lifetime. The first section of El Rastro, "Mont6n de cosas" [Pile of Things], goes straight to the heart of the matter and begins with an early variant of a gregueria. Ram6n's stilted contention that "nada pasa del suelo, nada caera en el cielo, ni en el del cenit ni en el del nadir" [nothing moves from the floor, nothing will end up in heaven, nei- ther in the zenith nor in the nadir] sets the tone for the rest of the chapters as well as for the way in which he will approach objects in general throughout his oeuvre (116). Once inside its orbit, objects in the Rastro are drained of any transcendence whatsoever-religious included-an effect that Ram6n describes in a way that anticipates Benjamin: "Productos de la industria modernisima .... Son ruines, no estain hechos naturalmente, sino en incubadoras faltas de sentido cordial y maternal y de la atenci6n suficiente, que da fondo e interes, que da viabilidad a las otras, cosas teratol6gicas sin arte ni romanti- cism .. ." [Products of the most modern industry .... They are ruins, they are not made naturally, rather in incubators lacking maternal and cordial sense and sufficient attention, which gives depth and interest, which gives viability to the others, teratological things without art or romanticismo .. .] (133). It is here, then, in the depths of the junk heap where the object's seemingly natural movement towards a more fully realized notion of ethical citizenship is stymied by its parallel advance towards obsolescence and a new existence. Here, it falls out of the relationship of being-in-common for want of the same sort of continuing social project that humans build and pass on in the form of institutions, traditions, and mores. Warranties, guarantees, and pat- ent protection-not to mention display as museum pieces-as forms of afterlife for the inanimate are no match for the inexorable march of human-driven progress. El Rastro of course, pulsates with the fetish- ism of the collector, with the chief fetishist being Ram6n himself, the creator of an urban common-space in which the inanimate becomes animate to varying degrees with such startling frequency. Understand- ingjust what type of actual and narrative collector Ram6n represents is key to bridging the gap that exists in his treatment of objects, the city, and their participation in his narrated society.</page><page sequence="18">MLN 291 I would suggest that in the strictest Benjaminian terms (and here I refer to the Arcades Project, which is fitting given Ram6n's style) he does and does not qualify as a Collector. Ram6n is a pack-rat; the collection for him is less "a devised historical system" and more an all-encompassing approach to the genus of all things (Benjamin 205). That said, one of Benjamin's last suggestions in the Collector Convolute is that the allegorist and collector are linked, perhaps diametrically opposed, but definitely linked for "in every collector hides an allegorist and in every allegorist a collector" (211). If one remembers my earlier assertion as to the primacy of the gregueria, an avant-garde, aphoristic relation of allegory, it is easy to see Ram6n as both. As allegorist, he can never have enough of things, as collector, he capitalizes on the impossibility of never being able to complete the collection and even muses on the act of divesting oneself of objects occasionally, so as to contribute to the material dynamic of the Rastros of the world: "Hay un momento aquf en que hacemos donaci6n al Rastro de todas nuestras cosas" [There is a moment here when we donate all of our things to the Rastro] (El Rastro 297). More persuasive and ultimately more useful for my present argument though, is an understanding of Ram6n as Collector based on the very manner in which he implicitly and explicitly animates objects in his fiction. This approach relies on a connection between his expression of the vast multiplicity of urban material culture on the one hand and collecting understood as a "form of practical memory, the profane manifestations of 'nearness' or presence," on the other (Benjamin 205). The notion of presence is especially compelling because it serves as a bridge concept that ties the object's return to base materiality in death to the very core of what makes the animate object stand out in "life": participation, presence, and visibility as a being-in-common. Consider Benjamin's Convolute [H2,3] in the light of how Ram6n grants objects finitude so as to extract them from the common-space and thus assume their being-in-common, a recognized presence among the animate: "The true method of making things present is to represent them in our space (not to represent ourselves in their space). (The collector does just this, and so does the anecdote.) ... We don't displace our being into theirs; they step into our life" (206). Presence vis-a'-vis the collection-as-memory binds the two ontological phases of the object that are visible in Ram6n to its inevitable fate in obsolescence and obliges us to meditate on the way that memory and legacy influence not only the possibility of ethical citizenship but also Ram6n's entire approach to the material.</page><page sequence="19">292 ROBERT A. DAVIDSON V. Conclusion What Ram6n is doing then, is writing a different type of materialist history-for not only does it deal with the impact of materialism and the fetishization of the inanimate on human society, it considers also the impact of human society on the lives of materials, on the existence and limits of animate objects. His narrative collection-as-memory of the fantastic elements of the modern metropolis captures the radical potential of all things and not simply that of the city's human deni- zens. He expresses this potentiality when he brings the inanimate to life, an action that invites reflection on the sense of urban commu- nity in Ram6n. But what of its capacity to sustain its place, its object citizenship writ over the long term? An examination of finitude and obsolescence in his work as embodied in the urban condition of the Rastro shows that an object's death is as patent as its various degrees of life. Here one sees a bridge between Nancy's power politics of being and the materialism critiqued by Benjamin; as the French philosopher observes: "Death is indissociable from community, for it is through death that the community reveals itself-and reciprocally" (14). The revelation in Ram6n is that objects may die but they don't disappear. In addition to landing in antique shops, they may be thrust out of the city proper to wash ashore on the suburban banks as junk, but they escape permanent oblivion through another rebirth, one that is this time predicated not on a being-in-common but rather on the thing's original existence of being-self: as an inanimate object, a simple thing. The object returns to this state by passing through the clearing house of the obsolete-the flea market-and by being resignified as some- thing collectible. It will then return to the city no longer the active participant that it was. From having helped to comprise a vibrant (exterior) city space, it will be consigned to the interior. The profane nature of the object as object erodes any sacred aspect of citizenship as it is shown to be extended to objects in Ramon's work. Thus, in the end, Ram6n, who does so much for the object in the sense that he animates it and gives it life beyond its use value (obliterating its commodity-like character) alas, cannot let go. He may well save the object from the so-called drudgery of being useful but through his empowering grasp he also empties it of any possible ethical dimension. Here is where the possibility of continuation, which is so central to ethical and liberal conceptions of citizenship dedicated to the common good, is eradicated and the limits of Ram6n's fictional explorations of ontology are reached.
