<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Colin McEwan, Cristiana Barreto and Eduardo Neves (eds.). Unknown Amazon: Culture in Nature in Ancient Brazil. London: The British Museum Press, 2001. 304 pp., 233 illustrations (166 colour), map and timeline, bibliography. ISBN: 071412558X. Â£19.99 (softback). This book was published in association with the exhibition of the same name, on display at The British Museum in 2000. The editors also curated the exhibition. These circumstances inevitably invite comparison with the BM's controversial earlier exhibition and book with a similar title, The Hidden Peoples of the Amazon (1985). I had therefore presumed that Unknown Amazon would be aimed at the general reader, intended for purchase by exhibition visitors. This impression is enhanced because the book is glossy and lavishly illustrated. On closer reading, I discovered a far weightier tome. Unknown Amazon is pitched at an academic level which would perhaps be too specialised for the general reader. That said, the book is perhaps over-illustrated for a specialist audience. 'Hidden Peoples' was criticised for romanticising Amazonian peoples and placing them in the 'ethnographic present', ignoring both their long history and contemporary political issues. Unknown Amazon is very different. The book is inter- disciplinary yet centred around an archaeological core. Its underlying aim is to uncover Amazonia's long and complex pre-colonial history, through all available methods - ecology, oral and written history, art history, linguistics, ethnography and archaeology itself. The book sets out to challenge the popular conception of Amazonia as an untouched natural paradise with simple, unchanging social systems. The 13 articles are written by leading archaeologists, curators and academics, with a foreword by John Hemming. The articles are organised into four sections, each centred around a disciplinary approach - loosely, these could be labelled ecology, archaeology, anthropology and history. These sections are arranged in an order with evolutionary undertones - from nature to archaeological societies, to living societies, to written history. However, each of these approaches feeds into an archaeological perspective and sheds light on the often forgotten prehistory of the region. Part 1, 'Economy and Subsistence', confounds expectations of an exhibition catalogue by discussing not artefacts but ecosystems. It demonstrates how the very fabric of Amazonian soils, flora and fauna provide evidence for long-term interactions between humans and their environment. Part 2, 'Archaeology and Society', provides case studies in ceramic styles, including impressive anthropomorphic polychrome funerary urns, as evidence of past complex societies. Part 3 makes more familiar reading for ethnographers - it discusses ideology and symbolism in visual and material culture, drawing on contemporary societies to illuminate the past. Part 4 draws on written, iconographie and oral histories, calibrating these with archaeological evidence to create a history of how the Amazon's past has been imagined, both by Westerners and indigenous people. Each article, based on brand new research, throws a fascinating new light on its subject. For museum ethnographers, the book adds great depth to the more recent and contemporary artefacts in our collections. The impetus for the 'Unknown Amazon' project came from the 500th Journal of Museum Ethnography 2003 133</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews anniversary of Europe's discovery of Brazil. Initially, the official celebrations in Brazil focused only on the last 500 years which, unsurprisingly, generated considerable protest. This book and exhibition help redress the balance, spotlighting the Brazilian Amazon's long history for millennia before this date. The book is a highly political object, working to publicise and protect the future of nature and culture in Amazonia through appreciation of its past. What is more, it makes an enthralling read.
