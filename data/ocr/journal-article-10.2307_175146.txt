<plain_text><page sequence="1">Swift's Historical Outlook The art and mind of Jonathan Swift have been the objects of ever greater critical attention for the last twenty or thirty years. So thoroughly have the commentators discussed Swift's attitudes and their origins that there would seem to be little left to discover about the Dean's views or why he held them or how he applied them. In respect to the role played in Swift's thought by his reading in his- toriography, however, and the importance of history in the con- ceptual bases of his writings, critics have assumed more than they have demonstrated. In spite of some useful published disquisitions - by Herbert Davis and Irvin Ehrenpreis - the implications of the importance of Swift's historical outlook have not been fully ex- plored, nor have the formation and configuration of his historically founded beliefs been clarified and documented. The present study will attempt to explain in some detail Swift's ideas of history, where he got them, and how they affected his non-historiographical com- positions.1 Swift's vital interest in historiography is now commonly ac- knowledged. The post in government he most actively tried to get was that of Historiographer Royal. Between 1714 and 1720, he devoted a good deal of time to composing his "histories" of political activities during the Tory ministry. He essayed a history of Eng- land. His letters as well as his other works are packed with refer- ences to a multiplicity of historians drawn from disparate ages and cultures. In his library, which numbered about five hundred separate works at the time of his death, at least three fifths were historical opera, including diaries, memoirs, and chronologies. He wrote marginal comments in the volumes by Bodin, Echard, Daniel, Burnet, and Clarendon that indicate Swift considered his histori- ographical principles superior to theirs. Even in those works of his 1. See Herbert Davis, "The Augustan Conception of History," in Jonathan Swift.

At first look, Swift indeed seems to belong with other eighteenth- century literary men who blandly averred the importance of his- torical knowledge. He was educationally indoctrinated much as the typical gentleman-scholar of his day. At Trinity College, Dub- lin, he got a thorough grounding in Greek and Latin historians; and later at Oxford and Moor Park he perused the standard authors, abstracting the works of Diodorus, Aeliani, Florus, Herbert, Sleidan, Sarpi, Camden, and Burnet5 Throughout his life he' was fond of citing historical precedents for contemporary events; his published works are filled with such allusions, from the early "Of 2.

The ferment of interest in historiographical theory, practice, and utility during the Restoration and Hanoverian eras, is shown by the plethora of treatises published between 1660 and 1760. Typical essays include those of Pierre Le Moine (tr. in 1695), William Temple (1692), Jean LeClerc (tr. in 1700), Thomas Hearne (1714), Richard Rawlinson *(1728), Charles Rollin (tr. in 1734), Edward Manwaring (1737), Peter Whalley (1746), and Bolingbroke (written in 1735, published in 1752). While Swift doubtless shared many of the sentiments ex- pressed in these variational treatments of the historiographical theories of J. J. Scaliger and G. J. Vossius, they were not entirely congruent with his own beliefs nor preemptive of them. 5. See Constantia Maxwell, A History of Trinity College, Dublin, 1591-1892 (Dublin, 1946), pp. 50-51; W.

That Swift reverenced Classical civilization is true. That he revered all of its periods equally or uncritically is far from true. He was a little more comfortable with Rome than with Greece, partly because he found Latin the more congenial language but also be- cause the temper of Greece was frequently expressed in art and philosophy, two disciplines less appealing to Swift's practical tastes than history, satire, political theory, and morality.7 But though he had an intimate knowledge of Roman history and an enthusiasm for it, he drew a sharp line between his evaluation of Republican Rome and Imperial Rome, reserving his praise almost exclusively for the former. It is untrue that Swift - or his fellow Tories - admired Augustan Rome; on the contrary, they grew to despise it.8 Neither is it true that Swift's historically derived analogies were inexact or inappropriate. Some (for example, those in The Examiner) may have served partisan ends; but Swift chose them scrupulously with his own admonition in mind: "The Value of several Circumstances in History, lessens very much by distance of Time; although some minute Circumstances are very valuable; and it requires great Judgment in a Writer to distinguish."9 Swift's clairvoyance in com- 6. That Swift used historical exempla most extensively in such works as "Contests and Dissentions," "The Sentiments of a Church of England Man," the essays for The Examiner, The Conduct of the Allies, and "A Proposal for Correct- ing the English Tongue" - all composed as exercises in persuasive logic - is probably indicative of his high seriousness. He often says so in the works them- selves, obviously without ironic intent. See Swift, IWorks, I, 222; II, 1-2; III, 29; III, 41-42; VI, 55; TS, XI, 8-10. Swift's most concentrated use of historical pre- cedents came, understandably, between 1701 and 1714, when he was most directly concerned with political matters in England. 7. Cf. Swift's eternally quoted statement: "I have got up my Latin pretty well, and am getting up my Greek, but to enter upon causes of Philosophy is what I protest I will rather die in a ditch than go about." Jonathan Swift, Correspon- dence, ed. F. E. Ball (London, 1910), I, 336. Swift's knowledge of Greek literature should not be underestimated, however. Not only did he urge the young clergyman to read Hellenic literature; his knowledge and use of Herodotus, Thucydides, Xeno- phon, Homer, Hesiod, Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, Pindar, and Plutarch is readily demonstrable in Swift's own writings. Moreover, he owned multiple copies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, and he was familiar with the chief Byzantine historians and critics. 8.

Like Addison, he knew that fourth-rate intellects often relied on his- torical parallels as a substitute for objective appraisal of con- temporary events; he parodied such moral and intellectual laziness in "A Tritical Essay upon the Faculties of the Mind."10 To accuse Swift of sharing this laziness by saying that his views were the shallow ones of Chesterfield and other nominal supporters of class- ical history is to misunderstand Swift by denying the creativity and integrity of his intellect. Because he never synthesized his attitudes toward histori- ography, history, and their interrelationship, it becomes the task of his commentator to construct Swift's purview (that is, the compass of his historical understanding) - certainly a dangerous practice. Yet, those who read Swift carefully acknowledge the importance of his implicitly historical perspective; his works are liberally sprinkled with the data that demand this acknowledgment. There are, per- haps, two practicable ways to use these data in an outline of Swift's historical purview. One is to extract from his canon everything Swift wrote about historians, historical works, and the nature of history and piece them all together in a large ideological mosaic. This method has the disadvantage of removing many statements which have historiographical significance only within their context. The other way is to read the historical works known to Swift and then construct a scholarly Road to Lilliput. This is the method basically employed by many Swift scholars including Crane and Ehrenpreis; though it can be useful and revealing, it may encourage the critic to oversimplify, to find causation where none exists, or even to impute to a writer ideas he consciously rejected.11 How- ever, lacking a statement by Swift himself on his theory and appli- cation of historical knowledge and perceiving that Swift implicitly held certain theories, the commentator has no alternative to using a combination of the extractive and influential techniques. His method can be tested by checking its results against the findings of other Swift scholars of varying persuasions. 10. Addison often repeated his warning of the inapplicability of historical parallels. For one partisan example and Swift's comment on it, see Swift, Works, TS, X, 376. The "Tritical Essay" may be found in Swift, Works, I, 246 ff, 11. The method shows to advantage in R. S. Crane, "The Houyhnhnms, the Yahoos, and the History of Ideas," in Reason and the Imagination, ed. J. A. Mazzeo (New York, 1962), pp. 231-53; Irvin Ehrenpreis, Mr. Swift and His Contempo- raries (Cambridge, 1962); and Philip Harth, Swift and Anglican Rationalism (Chicago, 1961). 55</page><page sequence="5">TIHE JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES To begin with, it is apparent that Swift's attraction to historical study started with his belief in its "universal" and "applicable" truths. No scholar today denies Swift's acceptance of the notion of "uniformitarianism," a premise common to eighteenth-century think- ers from Dryden to Burke. M. H. Abrams has defined this doctrine exhaustively, but it may be conveniently identified as the view that all men are essentially the same in all times and places with minor variations due to geographical and social factors.12 As the record of human events and personal behavior, history thus becomes an endless source of information for those interested in political science and psychology. More than that, the rhythms of historical sequence tend to repeat themselves, so that the discerning reader can find cultural paradigms by which to measure his own age and archetypal careers that bear resemblance to his own life. History thus pro- vides models and warnings, both for the state and for the private man.13 Johnson reflects this rationale for historical study in an aphorism: "If we act only for ourselves, to neglect the study of history is not prudent; if we are entrusted with the care of others, it is not just."14 When the Queen Anne wits persistently found similarities between their age and that of Rome just before the ad- vent of Caesar, they were not merely thinking metaphorically or belaboring an historical cliche: their reading of Livy, Trogus, 12. As with other of his beliefs, Swift was able to criticize a too narrow or trite usage by other writers. Cf. "The Mechanical Operation of the Spirit": "For I do not remember any other Temper of Body, or Quality of Mind, wherein all Nations and Ages of the World have so unanymously agreed, as That of a Fanatick Strain . . . as will soon appear to those who know any thing of Arabia, Persia, India, or China, of Morocco and Peru." Swift, Works, I, 174. For other nuances, of the Uniformitarian premise, see Swift's letter to Bolingbroke on April 5, 1729, and Pope's letter to Swift on October 9, 1729. See also M. H. Abrams, The Mirror and the Lamp (New York, 19153). 13. Swift gave objective praise to history for these qualities in a number of later works, notably the Latin "Character of Herodotus" (Swift, Works, TS, XI, 186), the "Vindication of Carteret" (ibid.. VII, 232), "The Presbyterian's Plea of Merit" (ibid., III, 46), and "An Essay on Modern Education" in The Intelligencer, No. IX (1729). Subjectively, he declared himself profoundly affected in his youth by reading classical history; e.g., "A Fragment of Autobiography" (Swift, Works, TS, XI, 376-78), "Memoirs Relating to that Change in the Queen's Ministry in 1710" (ibid., V, 380), Swift, Correspondence, III, 34. Bolingbroke, who well knew how to play on Swift's vanity, often referred to his knowledge of ancient history. Cf. Boling- broke's letter of September 9, 1730: "You have returned and supported ministers; you have set kingdoms in a flame by your pen. Pray, what is there in that, but having the knack of hitting the passions of mankind? With that alone, and a little knowl- edge of ancient and modern history, and seeing a little further into the inside of things than the generality of men, you have made this bustle" (ibid., III, 31). Probably the clearest statement of Swift's notion of the cyclic patterns of history is to be found in Book III of Gulliver's Travels (Swift, Works, XI, 194). Clear- cut examples of his confidence in history as a source of political prudence are found in Swift, Correspondence, II, 239; III, 191, and the works cited in note 6 above. 14. Samuel Johnson, Works (London, 1825), I, 264. 56</page><page sequence="6">SWIFT'S HISTORICAL OUTLOOK Justin, and Florus in school - the "practical stuff" of their educa- tion - had convinced them that insight into post-Restoration events demanded their awareness of Roman analogues.15 Even Defoe, with an inferior classical education, postulated the usefulness of drawing Roman-British parallels.16 This particular practice, a staple of eighteenth-century (and Swiftian) historical thought, remains common today, especially in the works of such twentieth-century English historians as Collingwood and Toynbee.17 The absorption of some Neo-Classical concepts into modern historiographical theory has prevented certain of Swift's views from passing into oblivion; but others, more important to the Dean of Saint Patrick's, fail to agree with modern ideology and thus are now ignored or slighted as archaic, therefore wrong. Recent literary studies have scrutinized Swift's fictional works in order to demon- strate unnecessarily the fact that Swift, a lifelong Church of Eng- land man, was a devout Christian. To point out that Swift's adherence to Christian theology affected his historical outlook might be supererogatory if the fact had not been so widely ignored. Even if theistically oriented history is presently discounted by his- toriographers and historical theorists, the truth is that for thousands of years intelligent men saw history in theogonic terms.ls Swift was one of these. Disguised though it often is by his satiric rationale and his com- plex irony, Swift's fundamental adherence to the idea of the per- vasive presence of God in human affairs is obvious in many of his works.19 Basic to his conception of a divinely ordained and con- trolled universe is his postulation of a phenomenological world manifesting Providential intent. His "Thoughts on Various Sub- jects" contains a succinct statement of this: One argument used to the disadvantage of Providence, I take to be a very strong one in its defence. It is objected, that storms and tempests, unfruitful seasons, serpents, spiders, flies, and other noxious or troublesome animals, with 15. This thesis is more fully developed in Johnson, "Meaning of 'Augustan,'" J.H.I., XIX (1958), 507-22. 16. See, especially, Defoe's poems and pamphlets written in the period be- tween 1710 and 1716. 17. Toynbee's capacious The Study of History shows a strong influence by the Augustan historiographical theorists of paradigmatic culture. 18. J. W. Thompson and Wallace Ferguson have written helpful surveys of theogonic history, before and during the Renaissance. Modern theologian-historians such as Reinhold Niebuhr and Karl Jaspers express the twentieth-century equivalent of Swift's basic position. 19. Cf. Louis Landa's Preface to Swift's Sermons.

The: motions of the sun and moon, in short the whole system of the universe, as far as philosophers have been able to discover and observe, are in the utmost degree of regularity and perfection; but wherever God hath left to man the power of interposing a remedy by thought or labour, there he hath placed things in a state of imperfection, on purpose to stir up human industry, without which life would stagnate, or indeed could not subsist at all: Curis acuuntur mortalia corda.2 This line of argument, which ingeniously reconciles the Christian doctrines of free will and divine omnipotence, is paralleled in "The Sentiments of a Church of England Man" where it takes on his- torical connotations: AMONG other Theological Arguments made use of in those Timesl [the reign of Charles II] in praise of Monarchy, and Justification of absolute Obedience to, a Prince, there seemed to be one of a singular Nature: It was urged, that Heaven was governed by a Monarch, who had none to, controul his Power, but was absolutely obeyed: Then it followed, That earthly Governments were the more perfect, the, nearer they imitated the Government in Heaven. All which I look upon as the strongest Argument against despotick Power that ever was offered; since no Reason can possibly be assigned, why it is best for the World that God Almighty hath such a Power, which doth not directly prove that no Mortal Man should ever have the like.21 Having struck down the historic principle of divine right, Swift goes on to assert that Greek and Roman history provide many ex- amples that prove the validity of his premise of God as the sole ruler of man's destiny, listing the tyrants overthrown by Him in Greece, Rome, and England. The "Thoughts" and the "Sentiments," one private and the other public in intent, indicate the elemental piety of Swift's outlook on the res gestae of historiography.22 Pietistic though his age was, Swift cannot be accused of utter- ing such sentiments out of empty convention. They appear too often, too ringingly, in his personal notebooks and private letters to be mere public pronouncements. In the "Thoughts on Religion," he recorded his belief in historic cycles and scriptural authority.2 20. Swift, Works, TS, I, 279. 21. Ibid.; Swift, Works, III, 17-18, 19-23. 22.

In light of the squabbles over "universal history," Swift's elaborate precis of the data of Genesis is irrefutable evidence of his Christian purview of history in an era when Scriptural authority was being attacked, by classicists and atheists alike.24 His sermons provide further evi- dence of the belief that history manifests Providential behests and action: "The Duty of Mutual Subjection," "On the Testimony of Conscience," "On Brotherly Love," "On the Martyrdom of King Charles I," and "On Doing Good" - all make connections between divine will and historical events. And, finally, the letters, written without guile to Pope, Pultney, Gay, Bolingbroke, and others, testify to the sincerity of Swift's pious predications about Provi- dence and history.25 Swift's Christian theism did not negate or even modify very much his enthusiasm for the pagan historians of Greece and Rome. His Christianity transcended his classicism without superseding it. In fact, to Swift, the perspectives of Neo-Classicism and Christian- ity were hardly contradictory. Classical uniformitarianism and Christian egalitarianism were two faces of the same coin: since he believed that all men were conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity, Swift could readily conclude that men were everywhere the same. The pagan historian presented valid evidence - the- ologically unenlightened though it might be - of the theogonic direction of history. Classical historiographers who postulated re- current cycles of events could be used to support the Christian view of divinely instituted rhythms in history; in fact, Augustine, Orosius, Tertullian, Ambrose, Eusebius, Jerome, and other patristic writers known to Swift had used them for just that purpose.26 Pagan his- torians, like Florus, who constructed the archetypal rise and fall of a civilization, confirmed the inspired prophecies of Daniel, Isaiah, 24.

His "Letter to a Young Clergyman" and his ser- mons, "On the Testimony of Conscience" and "On. the Excellency of Christianity," are clear evidence of Swift's reconciliation of secular classicism with spiritual Christianity.28 Thus, to Swift history, whether pagan or Christian, could be read as confirmation of the controlling hand of God on the res ge&amp;tae of the world. Man could not hope to comprehend the Divine Logos through scanning history, however; God maintains His mystery. But the pious student who had a "great Judgment" might draw sacrosanct principles from history to illuminate the present state of the world and to direct his personal conduct. Like Temple and others, Swift exempted "modern" history from his generalizations about the excellence of historiographical knowledge. Most post-Renaissance historiography he found venal, even mere- tricious, as the account of historians in Book III of Gulliver's Travels shows.29 His distrust of contemporary history, dating back to the days at Moor Park and strikingly reflected in The Battle of the Books, is to be found in many places, notably his essays for The Tatler on October 15, 1709, and September 28, 1710. It accounts for his own determination to write a history of England and his constant encouragement of Bolingbroke to do so.30 But with some modem history expunged, the historiographical library was a source of the wisest maxims. Swift used it as such and it determined some of his basic ideology. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that his political principles, his personal moral code, his social criticism, his ideas of language and literature, and at last his bleakly pessimistic attitude toward the world were all strongly tinctured by his reading in history. Though he boasted that he had never received the slightest "hint" for his literary productions, Swift was indebted to Greek and Latin historiography for many of his basic ideas. The years of reading and abstracting classical historians left their ideological mark on the young scholar, as an examination of the historical works in Swift's library shows. Initially, it was from Graeco-Roman 27. See J. W. Johnson, "Chronology: Its Concepts and Development," History and Theory, II (1962), 124-45. 28. Swift, Works, IX, 69 ff., 155-56, 241 ff. 29.

J. Scaliger, these basic ideas constantly reappeared in the historians that Swift admired. Other constituent beliefs in his historical purview Swift derived from the humanist-classicist tradition and confirmed through first- hand knowledge of ancient historians. Since it is these beliefs that most importantly shaped his specific applications of historically gained principles, a more detailed discussion of each of four tenets is necessary. These historiographical dogmas relate to his theory of Decline, his concept of Time, his emphasis on Climate, and his attitude toward Luxury. One of the most persistent canards in Swiftian scholarship is the idea that the Dean believed in a process of continual decline from some Saturnian golden Age of the past to the dismal condition of the brazen present. The canard springs from wrongly connecting Swift to the Renaissance tradition of the Age of the World and the Decay of Nature controversy.33 That Swift was fully cognizant of the Decay theory and used the controversy in his Battle of the Books is indisputable; but the evidence is that he never subscribed to the pessimistic corollaries of mundane senility and diminution. On the contrary, he consistently spoofed them. The early Tale of a Tub poked cheerful fun at the small size of modem ears in con- trast to the noble proportions of ancient ones with strongly prurient undertones.34 Gulliver's Travels elaborately scorned the postula- tions of Godfrey Goodman's The Fall of Man (1616) in the episode of Gulliver's visit to the library of the king in Brobdingnag, where 31.

Swift, Works, I, 128-29. 61</page><page sequence="11">THE JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES he finds a treatise that argues as proof of the age of the world the decline in size from their ancestors by the modem Brobdingnagian giants.35 Swift derided the catastrophic axiom of the Senilists in a bit of bagatelle written to Thomas Sheridan in later years.36 Thus, from 1697 to 1726 to 1735, the Dean repeatedly mocked the Decay of Nature theorists, characterizing their work as that which "treats of the Weakness of Human kind; and is in little esteem except among Women and the! Vulgar."37 Yet, though he denied the idea of a continual decline from the past to the present, Swift emphatically held that human beings had a tendency to degenerate - morally and intellectually, if not phys- ically. This tendency was the expression of man's innate and uni- versal characteristic, epitomized by Swift as "pride" and explained by the doctrine of original sin. Men were altered by the Fall so that they must eternally incline toward selfishness, sinfulness, evil, barbarity - in short, toward unalleviated Yahooism. Swift overtly confirmed his belief in original sin in the sermons and the "Further Thoughts on Religion." He mercilessly identified innate evil in "The Last Speech and Dying Words of Ebenezor Elliston" and declared that it must be forcibly rooted out of society and individu- al men.38 He saw in the events of history examples of man's per- petual tendency toward moral degeneration, which led to political and cultural decline; perhaps "The Sentiments of a Church of England Man" is the most extended exposition of this view.39 Thus, Swift's interpretation of historic patterns was determined by his belief that human events constantly repeated mankind's aspiration to Grace and fall from it. His basic emphasis on original sin and his equally strong belief in free will meant that Swift could not adhere to the idea that each age was progressively worse than the one before it, nor could he assume that each age was better. Every man, every group of men, must re-enact the choice of Adam; and though the same choice was made over and over, one could not - must not - assume that it was inevitable, for that would deny God's Grace and man as capax rationis. Thus history was the cyclic drama of attainment and failure, with the conflict between good and evil shown in groups of men and within the single man. It was, a temporal process of bal- ance and imbalance, what Herodotus and others called "flux." 35. Ibid., XI, 122. 36. Swift, Correspondence, V, 231. 37. Swift, Wlorks, XI, 122. 38.

It is more probable that there may be an equal quantity of virtues al- ways in the world, but sometimes there may be a peck of it in Asia, and hardly a thimbleful in Europe. But if there is no virtue, there is an abundance of sincerity; for I will ven- ture all I am worth, that there is not one human creature in power, who will not be modest enough to confess that he proceeds wholly upon a principle of corruption. I say this, because I have a scheme . . . to govern England upon the principles of virtue, and when the nation is ripe for it, I de- sire you will send for me.40 The kaleidoscopic subtleties of this passage do not obscure its vital concepts, which constantly appear in Swift's works: human be- havior is the interaction of virtue and vice; these qualities increase or diminish from time to time in nations as well as men; the pattern of change can be affected by the individual's "scheme" as well as by mass sentiment, which that scheme may help to produce; the balance or imbalance of collective vice and virtue causes the revolu- tions of politics. Swift was constantly preoccupied with political and moral equilibrium; in almost every instance, his use of history was to evaluate the symptomatic imbalances of his day beside the causative paradigms of recorded events, so that the balance might be restored at once.41 The Swiftian theory of Decline in human affairs may have been determinative but it was not fatalistic until the last ten years of his life. In conception it was strongly Christian. His concept of Time, however, was not. Though Swift knew such patristic speculations about the absolute nature of Time as 40. Swift, Correspondence, IV, 77.

As there must always of Necessity be some corruptions; so in a well-instituted State, the executive Power will be always contending against them, by reducing Things (as Machiavel speaks) to their first Principles; never letting Abuses grow inveterate, or multiply so far that it will be hard to find Remedies, and perhaps impossible to apply them. As he that would keep his House in Repair, must attend every little Breach or Flaw, and supply it immediately, else Time alone will bring all to Ruin; how much more the common Accidents of Storm and Rain?46 Beset as he was by various ideological heritages that defined Time in differing ways, Swift apparently settled finally for the most functional of meanings. From Marcus Aurelius and the Stoics, he 42. Augustine, Confessions, XI. R. F. Jones, Carl Becker, J. B.

Ibid., II, 63. 64</page><page sequence="14">SWIFT'S HISTORICAL OUTLOOK may have received a modified version of the notion, "Time is the enemy of man."47 From such Graeco-Roman historians as Herodo- tus, Diodorus Siculus, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, he educed the historic perspective summed up in Diodorus X.10: "Indeed there is no noble thing among men, I suppose, which is of such a nature that the long passage of time works it no damage or destruc- tion."48 The Church fathers - Cyprian, Orosius, Tertullian, Augus- tine - taught him that "Anything glorious that men found, they must, to make it their own, spoil it" but that in spite of human blunderings, "one God has directed the course of history and ... it is only because of His mercy that we live at all, and that if we live in misery it is because of our own uncontrolled passions."49 Such Renaissance writers as Polydore Vergil, Samuel Daniel, and Sir John Harrington fostered the practice of interpreting politico-historical events within a temporal pattern of decline.50 As the inheritor of these views and believer in them, Swift him- self did not attempt a formal definition of "time" but in general used it in several ways. First, it was simply a system of measure- ment for sequence and duration of events; "A Proposal for Correct- ing the English Tongue" (1712), with its elaborate correlation between Roman and British events and "times," is an outstanding specimen of such use.5l Then, it was an abstracted, often person- ified agent of creation and destruction; Swift frequently used "Time" in this sense in 1708-09, as was seen above. Then again, Swift thought of time as a characteristic - or at least capacity - of matter; temporality meant ephemerality thus physical decay. His analogy between government and a house in the "Project for Reli- gion" is typical of this denotation. Further, Time meant "history" or "historic pattern" or "historiographical data": probably Swift used "Time" in this way in the "Thoughts on Various Subjects" quoted before. In none of these usages did the Dean bother to define the relationship of time to God, but then he did not need to. God was infinite, and Time measured the finite. If he thought of its relationship to God at all, Swift probably equated "time" with spiders, flies, noxious animals, and other Providentially wrought 47. Cf.

In addition to his concepts of Decline and Time, Swift's thesis of Climate and its influence affected his historical outlook. The belief that climate was directly responsible for physical, intellectual, and cultural phenomena was a very ancient one, full expressions of it appearing in the writings of Herodotus, Hippocrates, Strabo, and their successors. It was also prevalent in Swift's time, having been prepared for by Bodin and other Renaissance thinkers who derived it from the classics. Versions of the climatic thesis influenced Clarendon, Temple, Defoe, Addison, Steele, Gay, Thompson, Field- ing, Goldsmith, Boswell, and Burke. There were, of course, eighteenth-century literateurs that scorned the notion that climate could account either for the course of history or the foibles of the single personality: chief among these were Bolingbroke and John- son. But the countenance given the climatic thesis by such influ- ential scientists as Dr. John Arbuthnot in An Essay Concerning the Effects of Air on Human Bodies in the early half of the century and that of William Falconer in his Remarks on the Influence of Climate in the latter half helped to promote its steady popularity. Swift's thinking was strongly colored by the Climate thesis.52 In brief, the Climatists held that the human body was directly affected by such factors as sunlight, rainfall, wind, cloudiness, heat and cold, moisture and dryness; and they also held that the body was indirectly affected by the quality of the soil, hence the kinds of food eaten, by general topography (mountainous or level), and by presence or absence of water, salt or fresh. Intelligence also was affected by climate (heat produced quick, alert minds, and cold resulted in torpor and stupidity); therefore, personality and charac- ter were climatically influenced. Logically, it followed that national character, political systems, and military activity were climatically affected. Implicitly, the climatological views held by the Ancients had historical ramifications for the Moders. Since the very stuff of history - politics, personal behavior, military conduct, conflict of nations - was climatically influenced, an understanding of climatic patterns aided one's understanding of history. Though he largely ignored the physiological aspects of the climatic thesis, Swift, perhaps following Temple, fully accepted the cultural and political posits. A few instances should illustrate the 52. This subject is expanded in J. W. Johnson, "Of Differing Ages and Climes," J.H.I., XXI (1960), 465-80. 66</page><page sequence="16">SWIFT'S HISTORICAL OUTLOOK relevance of these ideological donnees to his historical outlook. In 1708, Swift wrote: But although a Church-of-England Man thinks every Species of Government equally lawful; he doth not think them equal- ly expedient; or for every Country indifferently. There may be something in the Climate, naturally disposing Men towards one Sort of Obedience; as it is manifest all over Asia, where we never read of any Commonwealth, except some small ones on the Western Coasts, established by the Greeks. There may be a great deal in the Situation of a Country, and in the present Genius of the People. It hath been observed, that the temperate Climates usually run into moderate Governments, and the Extreames into despotick Power.53 He then went on to refute Hobbes and urge that "the Authors of Greece and Rome" be read as evidence of the flourishing of dem- ocratic government in an otherwise tyrannic age and as encourage- ment to English democracy in a trying period. In 1710, Swift's "Hints Towards an Essay on Conversation" suggested his doctrine of cultural imbalance in climatic terms: There is a sort of rude familiarity, which some people, by practising among their intimates, have introduced into their general conversation, and would have it pass for innocent freedom or humour, which is a dangerous experiment in our northern climate, where all the little decorum and politeness we have are purely forced by art, and are so ready to lapse into barbarity.54 Again, in 1712, in "A Proposal for Correcting the English Tongue": For I am afraid, my lord, that with all the real good qualities of our country, we are naturally not very polite. This per- petual disposition to shorten our words . . . is nothing else but a tendency to lapse into the barbarity of those northern nations [that is, the Angles, Saxons, and Goths], from whom we are descended, and whose languages labour all under the same defect .... Now, as we struggle with an ill climate to improve the nobler kinds of fruits, are at the expense of walls to receive and reverberate the faint rays of the sun, and fence against the northern blast, we sometimes, by the help of a good soil, equal the production of warmer countries, who have no need to be at so much cost and care. It is the same thing with respect to the politer arts among us; and the same defect of heat which gives a fierceness to our natures, may contribute to that roughness of our language, which bears 53.

For I do not reckon that we want a genius more than the rest of our neighbors.55 Swift's omnipresent references to "our northern genius" and "our climate" and "our meridian" in his works are often juxtaposed to his comments on degeneracy and time. In such combinations, his theory of Climate served to reinforce his belief that Decline, as a product of imbalance, was furthered by natural as well as moral forces, and to substantiate his notion that an abrasive Time was aided by physical factors (such as heat, cold, moisture) in working its ills. Like his other tenets, the Climate thesis did not contradict Swift's Christian postulations about history: "Climate" was those "storms and tempests, unfruitful seasons" that were divinely in- stituted. Climate, then, was one instrument through which God guided the course of history. The fourth chief constituent of Swift's historical outlook was his conception of Luxury. This concept, essentially economic and psy- chological in nature, was a favorite with the humanist historians of the Renaissance and their Neo-Classical successors. By the eight- eenth century, "Luxury," like "Time," was often used metaphorically to express an implicit historical or moral attitude; for example, Thomas Gray's reference to the shrines of "Luxury and Pride" heaped with incense kindled at the Muses' flame. In fact, a per- sonified Luxury was almost a historiographical villain to English devotees of Greek and Roman history. In ancient history, the concept of Luxury was often commingled with views of Decline, Time, and Climate. Herodotus coupled material prosperity with moral decline and military weakness as consequences of warm, fertile climates.56 Xenophon condemned luxury as a type of self-indulgent superiority of attitude that led to laxness and moral decline.57 Strabo scorned the luxury and sensu- ality of the Athenians in contrast with the economically deprived but morally exemplary barbarians.58 Such early Roman moralists as Cato and Varro, incensed at "unbridled luxury," blamed it as a symptom of cultural and moral decay, and thereby influenced a score of later historians.59 Diodorus, Livy, Justin, Appian, and 55.

In his comparison between the spread of Epicureanism in Augustan Rome and Restoration England, he said of the philosophical movements: "They both seem to be corruptions occa- sioned by luxury and peace, and by politeness beginning: to de- cline."63 His essay "Concerning That Universal Hatred Which Prevails Against the Clergy" (1736) made luxury the enemy of the Church as well as the State: "But, when public edifices were erected and endowed, they [the clergy] began gradually to de- generate into idleness, ignorance, avarice, ambition, and luxury, after the usual fate of all human institutions."64 And in his com- ments on history, English as well as Roman, he blamed luxury for its pernicious consequences. William II "first brought in among us ... luxury and profusion ... a mixture of virtues and vices" with the latter predominant.65 To Pope in a letter that was soon pirated and published (January 10, 1721), he attributed the collapse of Rome into permanent dictatorship to the fact that "the Virtue of the Commonwealth gave place to luxury and ambition"; and Gul- liver's Travels (1726) in a passage on Augustan Rome remarked on "Corruption grown so high and so quick ... by the Force of Luxury so lately introduced."66 The sermon, "Causes of the Wretched Con- 60.

Yet he was not, until the last ten years of his life at any rate. The very body of historiography that gave him his elemental concepts provided him with counter-theses to prevent fatalism and despair. According to Greek and Roman historians, every ill had a remedy. In the political sphere, once a polity had met its military and economic challenges and evolved a "constitution" to regulate its subjects, its successful functioning could be assured by basing its government on a system of checks and balances that would per- petually reassert political equilibrium.69 Polybius was the locus classicus of this theory for Swift and other Neo-Classicists; but the supplementary opinions of Dionysius, Justin, and Eutropius were also known to him.70 Noting that the Commonwealth "of it self is too apt to fluctuate," Swift often used Polybius to argue for the necessary maintenance of equal balance between the three govern- mental powers - king, nobles, and people: he did so in the "Senti- ments of a Church of England Man," "Remarks upon a Book," and, typically, in "A Letter to a Whig Lord":71 FOR indeed, my Lord, your Party is much deceived, when they think to distress a Ministry for any long Time, or to any great Purpose, while those Ministers act under a Queen who 67.

Such a Weight will infallibly at length bear down the Balance: And, according to the Nature of our Constitution, it ought to be so; because, when any one of the Three Powers whereof our Government is composed, proves too strong for the other two, there is an End of our Monarchy.72 Similarly, in the Abstract of his proposed history of England, Swift discussed at length in his account of Henry I the origin of English balanced government, tracing it back to Polydore and Brompton, citing Xenophon and Polybius, and examining the variations in Greece, Rome, and the Gothic states.73 Even in one of his sermons, he exegized his thesis of tri-partite balance as a preventive measure for political decline.74 Classical history also provided a suggestion for halting social degeneration. The pernicious effects of luxury and plenty could be minimized by the institution of a Censor, who would introduce and enforce sumptuary laws, prosecute offenders, and regulate sexual as well as economic conduct. Such ancient authorities as Livy, Di- onysius of Halicarnassus, Florus, and Plutarch praised the efficacy of censorship; and Cato the Censor became the austere prototype of the regulatory moralist.75 Confronted with a society full of the luxurious practices condemned by such classicists as Temple and Bolingbroke, Swift seriously suggested that England establish its own Censor. In "A Project for the Advancement of Religion," after listing the numerous "coruptions" of the age, he argued. I HAVE often imagined, that something parallel to the Office of Censors antiently in Rome, would be of mighty Use among us; and could be easily limited from running into any Exorbitances. The Romans understood Liberty at least as well as we; were jealous of it, and upon every Occasion as bold Assertors: Yet I do not remember to have read any great Complaints of the Abuses in that Office among them; but many Effects of it are left upon Record. The British censor would punish "Atheism, Drunkenness, Fraud, Avarice," and constantly inspect the nation's religion and morals.76 72. Ibid., VI, 123. 73. Swift, Works, TS, X, 225-27. 74.

Swift, Works, II, 49. 71</page><page sequence="21">'THE JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES Four years later, Swift was still supporting the office of Censor: The true way of multiplying Mankind to publick Advantage in such a Country as England, is . . . To enact and enforce Sumptuary Laws against Luxury, and all Excesses in Cloath- ing, Furniture, and the like: To encourage Matrimony, and reward, as the Romans did, those who have a certain Num- ber of Children.77 Echoes of this totalitarian notion reverberate in many of Swift's writings: in the account of the Lilliputians and their laws, the de- scription of the council and laws of the judicious Houyhnhnms, the papers on Irish manufactures, the Drapier Letters - even in "A Modest Proposal." In addition to a rigorous insistence on political balance and the exercise of moral censorship, history provided another means by which social decay and moral dissolution might be arrested: the exaltation of virtuous leaders who best exemplified the positive values of their societies. It was the happy task of historians to im- mortalize these paragons; historiography provided numerous instances of such conduct and its felicitous results. Xenophon enunciated the "exemplary" thesis in his Memorabilia; Polybius praised the effects occasioned by virtuous behavior in a ruler; Diodorus Siculus recorded the Egyptians' regimen for instructing their princes through holding up earlier rulers as models; and the biographers - Cornelius Nepos and Plutarch in particular - justi- fied their efforts as providing the wherewithal for moral improve- ment in their readers.78 Swift's absorption of this optimistic remedy for moral malaise may be seen in many of his works, most obviously in those dealing with Queen Anne and her reign. "A Project for the Advancement of Religion" extolled the Queen for her virtuous and pious example to her people, but Swift feared that though a vicious prince could in time corrupt an age, a virtuous one might have to exercise his authority to improve his age.79 The History of the Last Four Years continued to praise Anne as a model of conduct; and Swift evalu- ated other English rulers and praised or condemned their behavior for its effects in the Abstract of his history; for example, William II, Robert Earl of Gloucester, Stephen.80 The sermon, "On the Testi- 77.

The time-honored analogy between body and state was common in Swift's day. Classicists knew it from the myriad trans- lations of Aesop's fable of the Belly and the Members after 1660, from the political tracts of Plato and Aristotle, and the histories of Dionysius, Livy, and Dio Cassius.84 Temple espoused it, and Boling- broke used it to argue against Swift's admiration for Cato.85 From his youth, when he was absorbing L. Annaeus Florus's vivid account of the birth, growth, maturation, and decline of Rome, to his last transcendent despair at the apparent decline of England, Swift turned to the comparison of the life span of the state with the or- ganic development of a man.86 He voiced it most fully in his sermon "On the Duty of Mutual Subjection," sanctifying it with a quote from Romans 12:21; but the body-state metaphor appeared again and again in his works. When his critic acknowledges the fact that Swift was profoundly influenced by his reading in classical history in the ways just out- lined, the submerged basis for many of the satirist's intellectual constructs can be located. Swift's peculiar vantage point for criticiz- ing his society is seen to be the detachment of the historian rather than the violent subjectivism of the thwarted politician. His literary career can be understood as a progressive series of works written to fill what Swift thought to be the needs of a society whose present course was prescribed by historic process. By this principle, Swift's works group themselves into four discernible bodies roughly cor- 81. Swift, Wlorks, IX, 157. 82. Swift, Correspondence, I, 252; II, 239; V, 179; VI, 53. 83.

First came the Period of Reform (1701-14). The tracts of this period tend, like "Of Contests and Dissentions" and The Examiner, to comb classical history for instances that will shed light on present events and suggest what course of action is the best to follow. Swift shrugs off historical pessimism as an effect of splendida bilis or old age.87 He smiles at those who speak of "this critical age," for he knows that history will provide useful parallels to present prob- lems. Thucydides and Polybius contain lessons about military con- duct and balanced government. Herodotus has helpful information about the effects of climate that can be used by those who wish to establish language academies and regulate the language. Livy and Plutarch provide information about the Roman censorship that can be put into practice in England. The key to reform is understand- ing the past, even if history must be allegorized in the story of Peter, Martin, and Jack in A Tale of a Tub or satirized in "A Digression on Madness." Whig lords who do not know how to be- have in time of confusion may look to Cato for a model. These are the characteristic Swiftian posits in the time of Queen Anne. After the Queen's death and the collapse of the Tory ministry, Swift entered his Period of Documentation (1714-20). Though some were begun earlier, the works of this era show his obsession with preserving facts, setting the historical record "straight." Swift's conception of himself as historiographer dominates such works as his Enquiry into the Queen's Last Ministry and the semi-historical Last Four Years of the Queen, the writing of which is demanded, Swift says in the Preface, by his duty to God and man. In this period, other works reflect the Dean's image of his place in his- torical sequence: the "Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift," the letters to Pope and others, and his pleas to Bolingbroke to undertake an authentic account of what happened between 1710 and 1714 - these come from Swift's intense conviction that men's actions must be justified to posterity. The writings after 1720 show Swift's historically fostered pur- view leading him to take an increasingly jaundiced outlook on con- temporary events. The analogy he had drawn between Rome and England in the earlier works continued in his representation of the Hanovers as a race of despotic Caesars. The Drapier Letters (1720- 21) cast George I in Caesar's role, and Swift indicated in the 87. Swift, Works, I, 3'1; TS, 1, 281. 74</page><page sequence="24">SWIFT'S HISTORICAL OUTLOOK Letters and his private Correspondence that he no longer hoped to reform but only to impede the rate of decline. During the 1720's, as the Hanovers became entrenched and especially after George II issued in England's nominal "Augustan Age," Swift's works show more and more an historically cultivated resignation. The sermons of the period lament the lapse of taste, morals, and ideas. Gulliver's Travels increases in gloomy misanthropy from book to book, citing the history of religious and political schism in England with thinly concealed allegory in the first and third books as the data for gen- eralized lamentations. The Correspondence of this period emanates Swift's apprehensions based on his reading in history. This is the Period of Disillusionment (1720-29), the dominant chord for which was struck in Swift's letter to Pope in 1722: however I may have been soured by personal ill-treatment, or by melancholy prospects for the public, I am too much a politician to expose my own safety by offensive words. And if my genius and spirit be sunk by increasing years, I have at least enough discretion left, not to mistake the measure of my own abilities, by attempting subjects where those talents are necessary which perhaps I have lost with my youth. The Period of Despair (1729-40) first shows literarily in "A Modest Proposal" (1729), which ironically dismisses all practical reforms as visionary. Swift's brilliance remains but he is almost hopeless of any reformation. Such tracts as An Essay on Modern Education (1729), On Abuses in Dublin (1732), and A Proposal to License Beggars (1735) do not counsel plans for regeneration but advise an adjustment to degenerate realities. Swift's correspondence of this decade, typically dotted with references to historic ante- cedents, shows his total succumbence to the negative side of his historical outlook. Beginning in 1735, the letters show an increas- ingly fatalistic attitude toward England's destiny. To Pope he wrote: "My little domestic affairs are in great confusion by the villainy of agents, and the miseries of this kingdom . . . nor am I unconcerned to see all things tending toward absolute power in both nations - it is here in perfection already - although I shall not live to see it established." To William Pultney on March 8, 1735: I will do an unmannerly thing, which is, to bequeath you an epitaph for forty years hence, in two words, Ultimus Britan- norum .... We see the Gothic system of limited monarchy is extinguished in all the nations of Europe. It is utterly extirpated in this wretched kingdom, and yours must be the 75</page><page sequence="25">THE JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES next. Such has ever been human nature, that a single man ... is able to attack twenty millions, and drag them volun- tarily at his chariotwheels. Again to Pultney on May 12, 1735, in a similar vein: If my health were not so bad, although my years be many, I fear I might outlive liberty in England. It has continued longer than any other monarchy, and must end as all others have done . As to the lust of absolute power, I despair it can ever be cooled, unless Princes had capacity to read the history of the Roman Emperors; how many of them were murdered by their own army. To Thomas Sheridan on May 15, 1736, in a bitter parody of his early satire: I have often given my opinion that an honest man never wished himself to be younger. My sentiment I find ought not to have been universal, because to my sorrow I have lived to change. I have seen since the death of the late Queen, who had few equals before her in every virtue since mon- archy began, so great a contempt of religion, morality, learn- ing, and common sense, among us in this kingdom; a hundred degrees beyond what I ever met with in any writer ancient or modem. I am very confident that a complete history of the foolish, wicked, weak, malicious, ruinous, factious, un- accountable, ridiculous, absurd proceedings in this kingdom would contain twelve large volumes in folio of the smallest letter in the largest paper. At last with ultimate despair to Charles Ford on June 22, 1736: "I am heartily sick of the worst times and peoples, and oppressions that history can show in either kingdom.... I have long given up all hopes of Church or Christianity." But if Swift despaired of the Church and the State as possible saviors, he never gave up the hope of divine intervention that could alter the course of English history. In the last of his literary prod- ucts, he reiterated the providential thesis from which his historical perspective grew. As early as the fourth Drapier Letter, 'To the Whole People of Ireland," Swift was stressing the thesis of the Hand of God: he quoted Bacon in the view that God governs the world by settled laws which He transcends upon highly unusual occasions: the Lord helps those who help themselves.88 By the mid-1730's, he believed that God alone would determine whether England, like Rome, must plummet to, the nadir of decline; in 1735: "May God work a miracle, by changing the hearts of an abandoned 88. Swift, IWorks, X, 55. 76</page><page sequence="26">SWIFT'S HISTORICAL OUTLOOK people, whose hearts are waxen gross, whose ears are dull of hear- ing, and whose eyes have been closed."89 And once more in 1735: "I take my age with less mortification, because, if I were younger, I should probably outlive the liberty of England, which, without some unexpected assistance from Heaven, many thousand now alive will see governed by an absolute monarch."90 Swift's attitude to- ward English civilization and its history altered during the forty years of his writing career; but his fundamental assumptions about the essence and accidents of historical patterns never changed. From the standpoint of modern theory, many criticisms can be made of Swift's historical outlook. According to the critic, it may be narrow, unsophisticated, overly deterministic, or metaphysically unsound. His most censorious critic must grant, nevertheless, that within his assumed premises, Swift was consistent in his histori- ographical beliefs. He used his wide knowledge about the past to illuminate his understanding of the affairs of his day, often to con- siderable advantage. He documented his profoundest beliefs with the data of history. His writings benefitted constantly from the techniques and learning of historiography. In short, it is doubtful whether his broadest concepts or his specific applications can be fully grasped without a basic awareness of the importance of Swift's historical perspective.
