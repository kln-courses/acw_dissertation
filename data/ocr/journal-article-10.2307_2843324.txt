<plain_text><page sequence="1">402 PREHISTORIC ANTIQUITIES FROM THE ANTILLES, IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM. BY T. A. JOYCE, M.A. [WITH, PLATES XLVII1-LV J. IN the tweinty-fifth Annual Report of the Bureau of Amnerican Ethnology appeared a most valuable contribution to Ethnographical science in the form of a monograph by Professor Jesse Walter Fewkes on "1 The Aborigines of Porto Rico and Neighbouring Islancls." This monograph, which is the result of three years' labours in the ADtilles, is magnificently illustrated by ninety-three plates and numnerous figures in the text, showing the most interesting specimens in the rich collections, public and private, of Antillean antiquities in America. As the author had not the opportunity of visiting the European collections, I think it may be useful to publish as a miodest appendix to his monumental monograph, a description of the miiost important objects from the West Indies in our national collection. The British Museum collection, though not large, is, nievertheless, very fairly representative; and, moreover, contains a certain number of specimens of unusual interest, many of which have not hitherto been published. In particuilar there are three wvoodeni idols, reproduced in Archaceoloyia in 1803, of which Fewkes publishes smiall line drawings, taken from reproductions, in the Journal of tlhe In stitute of Jamaica, 1897, of the original and not very successful copper-plate. He adds (p. 199): " It is to be hoped that, on account of their exceptional formIs, somre ethniologist may publish later detailed descriptions of these objects." The wish expressed in these words is the best excuse for the followinig paper. WOODEN IDOLS AND SEAT. In wooden idols the British Museum is particularly rich, possessing no less than five, four of which miiay, without exaggeration, be described as magnificent specimens. The first three (Plates XLVIII, XLIX, L, and LI, 1) have long been in the collection, and the circumstances of their discovery are perfectlv well known; but they have been figured practically only once, and that as far back as 1803, when they were publislhed in Archaeologia. All other illustrations mnay be traced to the copper-plate which accompanied the short account of them, and which, in these days of process-printing, cannot be considered anythino, but inadequate. Fewkes quotes the passage from Archaeologia referring to their discovery, but for</page><page sequence="2">T. A. JOYCE.-Prehistoric Antiguities fro?m the AntilleA, in the Brqitish Museumn. 403 the sake of completeness I repeat it here. (Archaeologia, vol. xiv, p. 269 and Plate XLVI): " April 11th, 1799. Isaac Alves Rebello, Esq., F.A.S., exhibited to the Society three figures supposed to be of Indian Deities in wood, found in June, 1792, in a natural cave near the summit of a mountain called Spots, in Carphenters Mountain, in the parish of Vere, in the Island of Jamaica, by a surveyor in measuring the land. They were discovered placed with their faces (one of which is that of a bird) towards the east." All are cut from solid, very heavy and hard dark wood, and have a high polish. Two (Plates XLVIII, alnd XLIX, 3, and L and LI, 1) still have the shell inlay which represented the teeth; in the other (Plate XLIV, 1 and 2), it has been lost; the eyes of all were also inlaid, but only the resinous matrix remains. The two with human heads (Plates XLVIII and XLIX) have chai'nels running down the cheeks, a peculiarity which is also seen in one of the pestles in the Museum (Plate LIV, 4); these also appear to have contained inlay and may represent painting. In conlnection with the bird-headed figure, it is interesting to note that Fewkes speaks of " The Aboriginal Porto Rican tradition" to the effect that women "were created for men from four eagle-like beings possessed of feet and hands." Of the other two, the larger (Plate LI, 2) was purchased for the Christy Collection in 1866 from a dealer; no infornlation cale with it beyond the statement that it was " Carib." The engraved ornament is chiaracteristically Antillealn, anld there seeims no reason to doubt that it is a piece of old West Ilndian work. The renmaining specinmen (Plate LII, 4 and 5) belonged to the original Christy Collection; there is no entry on the slip catalogue to show how or whence it was obtained, the only information in connection with it being contained in the words "The Caribes." Of all five it is interesting to lnote that three (Plates L, LI, anld LII, 4 and 5) have the, heads of birds, one of them showing the complete figure of a bird standing on a tortoise or turtle (Plate LI, 2). Two (Plates XLIX, 1 and 2, and LI, 2) are furnished with the peculiar " canopy" which is a frequelnt feature of West Indian idols. The meaning of this " canopy " is obscure, but it may be that the idols which possess it were intended as supports for some object of worship, alnd in this connection I should like to call attelntion to a passage quoted by Fewkes, which, I would suggest, throws a little light on the subject. Herrera' writes: "Within the 'temple' they have a small, well-made table (tabla), round in form, on which are placed certain powders with which they sprinkle the neads of the images with definite cere-monies." Davies2 menltions these tables in a passage also quoted by Fewkes: "It is requisite above all things that the honme or hut inta which the Boye [medicine man] is to enter should be very neatly prepared for his reception; that the little table, which they call Matouton, should be furnished with anakri for Maboya-that is, an offering of cassava and onicon for the evil spirit- as also the first-fruits of their gardens if it be the season of fruits."

That in the form of a bird is a convenient height for the purpose, while that with a hulmran head seems originally to have terminated in a post. Those figured by Fewkes (Plate XC, c and Plate XCI, a and b) are also of suitable size, while the attitude of the human figure shown in Plate XCI, b, suggests that it is supporting something. It is even possible that the eye of faith might see in the idol combininig the figures of the bird and tortoise the personification of " the two nature powers representing the sky fatlher and the earth mother," the worship of which " was the highest form of their [the Antillean's] cultus."I There is only one wooden seat in the British Museum (Plate LII, 3), but that, an old and interesting specimen, is accompanied by fairly coinplete informatioll. This specinmen also belonged to the Christy Collection, having, been presented in 1876 by Captain Melfort Campbell. An old label pasted in the middle of the seat, alnd dating to a period alnterior, reads "Found in a cave at St. Dominlgo; presented by General S. Imbert, Dominican Army." The donor supplied the information that the specimen, which was given to him by General Imbert, was " found at Isabella, thirty miles from Porto Plata, St. Domingo, in a cave inhabited by Inidians in former time." Plate XL VIII and Plate XYLIX, Fig. 3. Cut from solid, very heavy and hard, dark wood. Ithyphallic figure of a man standilng with legs stretched far apart, knees stiff, elbows close to sides and benlt, hannds flat over hips, fingers (four in nuumber) close together, thumbs not indicated. A band in relief followinlg the outline of the head represents the hair; the orbits (45 and 47 mm. wide) are cut intaglio, and a shallow groove (14 mmi. wide at the cenitre) runs from the lower margin of each orbit down the cheek; within the orbits the lids are in each case represented by a hollow oval in low relief; these ovals and also the cheek grooves were probably inlaid with shell, since they contain traces of a layer of resin; the nose is in relief, the nostrils indicated by two shallow circular pits; the mouth is repr-esenited by a hollow oval in relief (width, 46 mm.), inlaid with shell plate (width, 35 mm.), engraved to represent teeth; the ears, in relief, are represented as carrying discs in the lobes, and ears and discs seem to have been furnished with inlay, since they are provided with cavities still containiing resin; a transverse groove appears on each arm imnmediately below the shoulder, and the traces of resin here also indicate that inlay, in this case representing armlets, was originally present. On the legs are represented the characteristic cotton bandages at knee and ankle; the feet are represented by irregular discs, on the front of which the toes are indicated by engraved vertical. lines. - At the back the shoulder-blades and spine are represented in sharp relief, I Few/kes, p. 34.</page><page sequence="4">T.

Total height of figure 405 mm. (British Museum; figured in Archaeologia, vol. xiv, Plate XLVI.) Plate XLIX, Figs. 1 and 29. Cut from solid, very heavy and hard, dark wood. Human figure to the hips; the hair is represented by a narrow engraved band in relief along the top of the head; the forehead, brows and nose are in relief; the nostrils appearing as two shallow circular pits; the orbits are oval and cut idtaglio (36 x 11 mnm.), and were probably inlaid, since one still contains a layer of resin; from the lower margin of each a groove (about 18 min. broad) runs down the cheek, as in the specimell first described, but in neither case is it cut as deep as the eye-cavity; the nmouth is a hollow oval in relief, the cavity containing a layer of resin; the ears are shown in lateral relief, and are represented as furnished with discoid ear-plugs in the lobes, the centre of each ear-plug being marked by a circular cavity containing traces of resin; the trunk is relatively small; the arms, in relief, are pressed against the sides, elbows bent at right angles, and the hands approaching one another palnis inwards, the wrist and filngers indicated by engraved lines; between the hands is a projection of uncertain meaning, and damaged; an engraved circle with a dot in the centre represents the navel; on the horizontal surface between hands and trulnk are two engraved circles; below the hands a, groove encircles the figure, which is circular in section and seems to have termninated in a post; from betweeln the shoulders at the back springs a perpendicular rod, expanding forward at the top to form all oval discoid canopy, pierced with a vertical hole; the rod is cut fiom the solid, but there seems to be anl indication that it fits into a socket projectilng from between the shoulder-blades of the figure.

Bird-headed figure, the beak bent downwards and the tip touching the breast; on the head is a flat head-dress with engraved ornament; two klnobs on either side of the temples may represent ears; the eyes are oval cavities (48 x 33 mm.) and were probably ilnlaid, as a thick resinous matrix renmains. Towards the end of the beak on'the right-hand side a long narrow shell plate (68 x 9 mmri.) enigraved to represent teeth lhas been inlaid, and there is a corresponding slot (73 x 10 mm.) oln the other side from which, evidently, a sinmilar plate has fallen; the figure is furnished with arms; the left (length, 260 mm.) is stretched out laterally at right angles, the right (length, 265 mm.), also outstretched laterally, is inclined downwards; four fingers are indicated on each hand.

Figure of a bird standing on the back of a tortoise or turtle (diameter, 300 x 265 mm.), of which the head is bent up at right angles so that the m-outh is in contact with the bird's beak. The bird-which resembles some kind of stork-has a topknot, ornamented on both sides and the top with engraved patterns. The eyes are represented by oval depressions (length, 50 nmin.), probably inlaid originally, since one of them contains traces of resinl. The wings, represented as folded close to the sides, are ornamnented with circular and scroll patterns in bas-relief; the legs are conjoined and show four claws on each foot; the eyes of the tortoise or turtle are represented by circular depressions (diameter, 19 mm.), and there are traces of engraved ornament on head and carapace. From between the winigs of the bird sprinigs a vertical post (length, 190 mm.), circular in section, supportilng a discoid canopy considerably broken. Total height of figure, 665 mm.

Total length, 730 mm. (British Museum; Christy Collection, 9753.) THREE-POINTED STONES. The British Museum possesses three of these peculiar objects (Plate LII, 1 and 2, and LIII, 6, 7 and 9). All of them belong to the first type of Fewkes' classification, the other types being unrepresented in the national collection. Of this type, that first described (Plate LII, 1, and LIII, 6) belongs to Fewkes' first group, the human-headed; the second (Plate LII, 2, and LIII, 7) seems to me to bear the head of a beast, a design for which Fewkes has made no group; the third (Plate LIII, 9) may be classed with Fewkes' reptilian group. The first has been in the collection for many years, but, unhappily, there exists no information as to when or how it was obtained; the head resembles that figured on p. 112 of Fewkes' article, but the general outline is more similar to that on Plate XXXIII, Fig. c. The second was purchased at a sale in London in 1904, together with the collar shown on Plate LIII, 2, the pestle figured on Plate LIV, 7, and the two " ornaments," Plate LV, 8 and 9. The third is somewhat different from the other two, so much so that I never remember to have heard of a similar specimen; it is smaller than the rest, the rock from which it is cut is not so heavy and much coarser, the workmanship is far rougher, and the projection is distinctly pyramidal. But the chief interest of the specimen lies in the locality in which it was found. Fewkes (p. 111) writes: "The geographical distribution of the three-pointed stones is confined to a single region of the West Indies, namely, Porto Rico and the adjacent eastern end of Santo Domingo. They have not been reported from Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, or the Lesser Antilles." This specimen, which was given to the Christy Collection in 1872 by Mr. A. W. Franks (afterwards Sir A. Wollaston Franks, K.C.B.), comes, according to contemporary information, from St. Vincent. As to the original purpose of this class of object I must confess myself at a loss for a suggestion; they exhibit certain contradictory features which it is not easy to reconcile; on examining them for traces of wear such as might convey a hint of their use, one is struck first by the concavity of the base, which seems to suggest that they may have been used as mortars or mealing-stones; it is noticeable that in the smallest specimen described, which is cut from stone softer than the other two, this concavity is more pronounced and seems to be due to longitudinal friction; if they were used in this way the projection was probably VOL.

On the other hand, many of themn seem to be furnished with grooves round the "head" and "tail" ends which might have served for lashings to fasten them to a handle of some sort. But a stronger argument against the mortar theory is the fact that if put to such a use the carved ornament would not only be upside-down, but entirely invisible, and as far as one can see, meaningless; indeed, it seems to contradict the canons of primitive art. If the friction on the bases had anything to do with the use, it seems mQre likely that they were used as rubbers to polish large stone objects of rounded shape, as, for instance, the collars; the weight would prove of great assistance in such work, and the projection would furnish a useful grip for the two hands, which could be transferred to the " head " and " tail " ends if it was desired to give a different motion, such, for instance, as a " rocking " mnovenment, to the rubber. Plate LII, Fig. 1, and Plate LIII, Fig. 6. Three-pointed stone; cut from solid, dark, volcanic rock; length, 300 mm.; height, 123 mim.; belonging to the first group of the first type of Fewkes' classification (p. 111). One end is carved to represent a hunman head, with nose in sharp relief; eyes and mouth represented by hollows; ears in lateral relief, with indication of discoid ear-plugs in the lobes; a band in relief across the forehead may represent hair; the other end represents buttocks, legs and feet; the knees are bent, the feet close together; four toes are indicated on each; the projection is conical and pointed, the anterior and posterior sides of the cone being slightly concave; the under surface is slightly hollowed. Plate LII, Fig. 2, and Plate LIII, Fig. 7. Three-pointed stone; cut from solid, dark, greenish rock; length, 259 mm.; height, 1119 mm.; belonging to the first type of Fewkes' classification, but corresponding to none of his groups, in that one end is carved to represent the head of a beast (not a reptile) with rounded ears in high relief; the eyes are not indicated, but across the face in this region runs a transverse band in low relief; a similar band runs behind the ears and over the neck; the snout is blunt and the mouth indicated by grooves; the other end represents buttocks, legs with knees bent, and feet, the last pressed closely against the end of a broad tail passing between them; the portion of the tail above the feet is carved in bold relief; the projection is a broad-based cone with blunt point, "swollen" at the sides; the undei-surface is noticeably hollowed.

Three-pointed stone, cut from solid, brown, coarse volcanic rock; one end is broken; present length, 135 mm., estimated length when perfect about 190 mm.; height, 74 mm. It belongs to group 2 of Type 1, of Fewkes' classification; the perfect end is carved to represent a reptilian head; the eyes are represented by hollow circles in very low relief with pits in the centres; the projection is pyramidal, roughly square ill transverse section; the base is markedly hollowed with evident signs of longitudinal friction. (British Museum; Christy Collection, M.I., 240.) STONE COLLARS. Of the peculiar objects known as stone collars, the British Museuim possesses four examples, one belonging to Professor Mason's first class, the massive (Fig. 2 text), three to his second class, the slender oblique oval (Plate LIII, 1 to 5); of these, two are "right-shouldered" and one " left-shouldered" (see Mason's classification, Smithsonian Report, 1876, p. 385, foll., quoted by Fewkes, p. 159, foll. For convenience, and to explain the terminology used, the accompanying illustration -Fig. 1 text-has been adapted from Fig. 25, appearing on p. 160 of Fewkes' treatise.) Of the collars described below, the first (Plate LIII, 5) belongs to the Christy Collection; it is described as having been " found at St. Thomas'." Of the second (Plate LIII, 1 and 3) nothing is known save that it has long been in the British Museum Collectioni. The third (Plate LIII, 2 and 4) was purchased at a sale in London in 1904, together with the three-pointed stone described above and the pestle and ornaments described subsequently. The massive collar (Fig. 2 text) originally belonged to the collection of Mr. Josiah Cato and subsequently to that of the Rev. Sparrow Simpson, and was added to the Christy Collection in 1875. To the discussion of the use of these remarkable and puzzling objects by Professors Mason and Fewkes, I have little to add. One point seems to me to have been insufficiently emphasised, and that is the following. It is perfectly obvious that these collars were constructed originally of wood; a young tree was selected and cut off immediately below a fork; the two ends of the fork were trimmed into unequal lengths, the longer bent round so as to overlap the shorter, and the two fastened together by a band of cotton similar to the leg-bandages worn by the natives. This is easy to see from the great majority of collars, and, inideed, Professor Mason speaks of the " shoulder ridge" as "faintly resembling a lashing of the two ends of a hoop;" though he goes no further. But the specimen figured on Plate LIII, 1 and 3, proves it conclusively; here there is no "lashin&amp;,' and its absence allows the overlapping and hooking of the two elnds to be clearly indicated. If we retranslate from stone to wood we see that the juncture of the ends in this case (and perhaps in all) was effected as follows:- 2 E 2</page><page sequence="9">410 T. A. JoycE.-Prekistoric Antiquities trom the Antilles, in the British&amp; Museum. When the limbs of the fork were trimmed, the stump of a small subsidiary branch, growing in a convenient positioni towards the end of each, was left projecting; the longer limb was bent round, and the projection towards its termination was hooked round the projection on the shorter limb; the addition of a cotton bandage would hide the joint and make all secure. Whatever was the use of these enigmatical objects, I feel sure that they could not have been worn either as badges or ornaments. Fewkes has collected a large number of passages from early writers which shed a great deal of light upon the dress and ceremionies of the Antilleans, but in none of them is anly mention made of stone collars, though other forms of decoration are described in detail. Had these collars been worn, even ceremonially only, it seems almost impossible that such remarkable objects could have escaped the notice of the early observers. The number that is known to exist (Fewkes (p. 159) speaks of "about one hundred" from Porto Rico) renders the argumentunm e silentio still stronger. It seems to me that they are to be considered as one of the numerous types of zemi, a term of wide meaning, which appears to include objects of worship and charms, personal, family and communal. As such they would naturally be kept hidden in the houses of the natives or in caves, anid would be more likely to escape the notice of the alien conquerors. I would, though with considerable hesitation, suggest the following as a possible explanation. Starting with the supposition that they were originally constructed of wood (which seems to me to be almost certain), it seems possible that a clue might be found in the prevalelnce of tree-worship in the Antilles. Fewkes (p. 56) relates that "the zemi Faraguavaol was the trunk of a tree found by an Indian and carried to a chief," and he also quotes (p. 57) an interesting passage from Fray Ramon Pane on wooden zemi: "When an Indian was passing by a tree which was moved more thall others by the wind, the Indian in fear calls out, ' Who are you ?' The tree responds, 'Call here a Bohii or priest, and I will tell you who I am."' The passage then describes the questions which, after certain ceremonies, the medicine-man puts to the tree, as to its name, the locality where it desires to be set, and the ceremonies with which it is to be honoured; then it was cut down and a figure made from it. It may be that in early times if the tree-trunk were too small to furnish an image of adequate size, it was trimmed and bent into a hoop of the nature above indicated, and the symbol of the indwelling spirit cut upon the decorated panel and its border. Where anthropomorphic carvings are frequently found on the stone collars a zemi of this nature would necessarily be of somewhat ephemeral a nature, and it may be that a substitute was later carved from stone, and that finally the small tree-spirit was transferred to a stone habitation already prepared for it. The question of the "right- handedness" or the converse of a definite stone collar would depend on the relative lehgth and stoutness of the limbs of the tree originally chosen as a habitation by the spirit which it represents. The reason of the hoop-form is difficult to explain unless it is supposed that these collars were suspended in some way. The heavy collars, which appear to have been formed of a single and</page><page sequence="10">T. A. JoYcE.-Prehistoric Antigquities from the Antilles, in the British MEuseumrn. 411 comparatively stout stem bent into a hoop and the ends secured by a bandage, may represent zemi made originally from the straight trunk of a tree without a fork. I must adimit that this suggestion-I should not like to dignify it by the term theory-does not seem to me at all conclusive; but, at worst, it is not less likely than the others, and perhaps even more likely than some, which have been put forward in explanation of these puzzling objects. Plate LII, Fig. 5. Stone collar, 423 x 290 mm.; slender oblique oval; left-shouldered; comnpara- tively plain; no decorated panel, paniel border, ridge, nor perforation; only in the region where the perforation should normally occur, the collar decreases slightly but abruptly in diameter. There is nothing worthy of remark in connection with the undecorated panel, border, groove, or pit; the shoulder ridge is narrow (width 20 mm.), and the projection plain. (British Museum; Christy Collection, M.I., 144.) Plate LIII, Figs. 1 and 3. Stone collar, 425 x 310 mm.; slender oblique oval; right-shouldered; the so-called decorated panel is quite plain, though distinguished by a ridge; the border is also plain, and the perforation is present; the undecorated panel calls for no remark, and there is a slight projection on the border on each side of the pit. The arrangement of the design in the region of the shoulder-ridge and projection is, as far as I can discover, unique, and throws a good deal of light on the origin of these collars; instead of a "shoulder- ridge'" there are two knobs, so arranged that the collar does not resemble a hoop with the two ends lashed together, but a hoop formed by hooking a projection on one end round a similar projection on the other, the two ends overlapping and shown clearly resting one on the other. The projection (which is the extremity of the short arm of -the hoop) is furnished with a transverse ridge at the end. (British Museum.) S.=. l .. ^s, FIG. 1. b. Boss, dp.

Five of these are of the type usually supposed to have been used for grinding pigment; the sixth (Plate LIV, 7) is of a different shape and much larger, and was</page><page sequence="12">T. A. JoYcE.-Prehistoric Antiquities from the Antilles, in the British iuseuin. 413 probably used in the preparation of food. In describing these I have adopted the terminology of Fewkes (p. 99), who writes: " We can distinguish in each of these pestles four distinct parts: (1) head; (2) handle; (3) lens or base; (4) ferrule; the last being situated at the junction of lens and handle." Of the first four pestles, that are shown on Plate LIV, No. 5, and one not figured, were given to the Museum in 1825 by Mr. H. W. Brown. The following information accompanied them: " Found under the surface of the ground in a coffee plantation in Jamaica ill 1820." Plate LIV, 4 and 6, were purchased together for the Christy Collection in 1895, and were accompanied by no information. Plate LIV, 3, was given to the Christy Collection in 1869 by Mr. W. J. Bernhard Smith, and was found at Petit Trou, S. Domingo. Plate LIV, 4, I believe to have come originally from Jamaica, since it is distinguished by the peculiar facial grooves which are so noticeable in two of the wooden idols already described, and since Plate LIV, 6, formed part of the same purchase, I should regard it also as of Jamaican origin. At any rate, I do not think they can come from -S. Domingo; it will be noticed that the specimen which comes indubitably from Jamaica has practically no " lens," while that from S. Domingo has a well-pronounced " lens," and so have all those from the latter island figured by Fewkes. The only alternative seems to be Porto Rico, since a specimen figured by Fewkes on Plate XXVI, C, seems to bear a close resemblance to Plate LIV, 6. The remaining large pestle, Plate LIV, 7, was purchased at a sale in London, in 1904, tog,ether with the collar, Plate LIII, 2, and the three-pointed stone, Plate LII, 2, as well as the two ornaments, Plate LV, 8 and 9. Plate LIV, Fig. 5. Stone pestle, cut from solid pale brownish stone; length, 165 mm.; human head; the eyes represented by hollow circles in relief with deep pits in the centres, and the eyebrows by a continuous curved ridge across the forehead. The ears are shown in lateral relief and are represented as furnished with circular ear-plugs in the lobes. The handle increases in diameter towards the lens, which is onlly 8 mm. deep and very slightly marked; the under surface is nearly flat; diameter, 86 mm. (British Museum, 25, 4-21, 1.) (Not Figured.) Coral pestle; length, 130 mm.; the head is too damagged to admit of the possibility of judging whether it was carved or not. The handle increases in diameter towards the base, which is undifferentiated. The under surface is flat; diameter, 76 mm. (British Museum, 25, 4-21, 2.)</page><page sequence="13">414 T. A. JOYCE.-PrehiLstortc Antiqgitites from the Antilles, in the British Museum. Plate LIV, 2 and 4. Stone pestle; cut from solid brownish-buff coarse stone; human head, the eyes formed by hollow circles in relief, each set in a shallow depression which is continued down each cheek in the form of a shallow groove as in the wooden idols from Jamaica. The lower portions of these grooves are obscured by the hands, indicated in engraved outline, and represented as placed flat on the cheeks with fingers extended upwards; the arms and shoulders are also indicated in engraved outline. The ears are shown in low relief and are represented as furnished with circular ear-plugs in the lobes. The handle increases in diameter towards the base, which is merely a continuation of the former, and only differentiated from it by a shallow transverse groove encircling the pestle. The under surface is nearly flat; diameter, 72 mm. (British Museum; Christy Collection, 95-65.) Plate LIV, Fig. 6. Stone pestle, cut from solid, dark, coarse, volcanic rock; length, 154 mm.; human head; the eyes are represented by two deep pits; the nose is broad and in high relief; the ears are shown in low lateral relief. A tranversely-grooved vertical band in low relief down the back of the head may represent hair. The handle increases regularly in diamneter towards the base, which is in no way differentiated from it; the under surface is practically flat; diameter, 79 mm. (Museum number, 95-61.) Plate LIV, Fig. 3. Stone pestle, cut from solid, dark, coarse, volcanic rock; length, 143 mm. Head, in form of a crouching-figure with projecting lower lip, and a ridge of hair across the head. The handle is slightly swollen midway; the ferrule is broad and the lens angular and smooth; diamneter, 101 mm. (British Museum; Christy Collection, 5269.) Plate LIV, Fig. 7. Stone pestle, cut from solid, pinkish-brown, coarse rock; length, 420 mm. Head, a bird with disproportionately long beak; the eyes are formed by circular depressions; the wings are in lateral relief with engraved indication of feauhers; the .handle is long and practically cylindrical, and the base, which is undifferentiated, is rounded; diameter, 78 mm.

Closely allied to the pestles are the following two stone carvings which may perhaps be described as rubbers, as the under surface, which is rounded, in each case shows signs of friction. Unfortunately, there is no evidence as to the locality in which they were found. It may be noticed that the first described bears a close resemblance to the " stone bird " figured on p. 194 of Fewkes' mnonograph. Plate LIII, Fig. 8. Stone rubber; cut from solid, hard, brown stone; figure of a bird sitting with folded wings on an oval base; the beak rests on the breast; the eyes are in relief with a small oval pit representing the pupil; engraved lines on the wings indicate feathers. (British Museum; Christy Collection, 9878.) Plate LIV, Fig. 1. Stone rubber; cut from solid, hard, black rock; female figure lying on back, with knees drawn up, on an oval base; eyes, nose, mouth, outline of face, breasts, arms and legs are shown in relief. (British Museum; Christy Collection, 9877.) Both specimens were given by Mr. A. W. Franks (afterwards Sir A. Wollaston Franks, K.C.B.) in 1876. STONE CELTS. As regards stone celts, the British Museum collection is rather unequal, certain islands, such as Cuba, being represented only by a single specimen. At the same time, three islands are well represented: Barbados by a good series of shell axe- and adze-blades, and a few of stone (which must have been imported into the island); Jamaica by a large collection of beautiful celts nearly all petaloid in form; and St. Vincent. Besides these there are a nuinber of Carib celts to which no locality is assigned, but which probably came from St. Vilicent; as well as the best specimens from the collection of Sir Grahanm Briggs fromli St. Kitts and Nevis., I regret that, for want of space, I am unable to figure any of the Jamaican celts, many of which, as far as symmetry of outline and brilliancy of polish are concerned, are unsurpassed from any country; but I may mention in passing that, besides the petaloid type, the Museum possesses a few of a gouge- or chisel-shaped patterln tapering very slightly towards either end, oval in sectioii, ranging froin 127 nmm. to 62 mm. in length and measuring only 22 mmn. to 15 mm. in breadth. I Many of these are figured in an article by Mr. (now Sir Everard) im Thurn in Timehri Vol. III.</page><page sequence="15">416 T. A. JoYCE-Prehistoric Antiquities from the Antilles, in the British fuseum. A few of the long series of Carib celts from St. VinceiLt and other islands of the lesser Antilles are shown in outline herewith (Fig. 3, text). The specimens reproduced have been selected with a view to show the greatest variety of form rather than perfection of outline, and the Museum possesses many " intermediate " types of striking workmanship, ranging from heavy thick blades 295 mm. in length to small "miniatures" of 35 mim. It is unnecessary to describe in detail those figured, but it may be remarked that No. 12 is unusually thin, measuring only 15 mm. at its thickest part. The projection seen on either side of the " handle " end in some specimens remind one irresistibly in some cases of the beaks of birds of prey (especially Nos. 6 and 7). and it may be that such was the original design. The following information is all that will be necessary concerning them: Nos. 1, 9, 11 and 15. St. Vincent; given by A. W. Franks, Esq., 1872. (Checkley Collection).

Plate L V. Four important specimens stiil require mention: those figured on Plate LV Figs. 1 to 4. These celts are "petaloid " in type, and on each a human figure or bust is carved in relief on one side. Fig. 1 alone shows the whole figure; it is carved from coarse, brownish trap- rock, and is ilot polished; length, 19 a mm. (British Museum; Christy Collection, M.I., 128.) This is exactly similar to a more damaged specimen from St. Vincent.</page><page sequence="16">\ 2 2 8 4/ S B 7 8 9 10 12 12 14 is t g0 6 17 FIG. 3.-CARIB CELTS FROM THE LESSER ANTILLES.

Fig. 2 is of coarse greyish-buff rock, also unpolished, and shows a human face and arms; length, 228 mm. It was originally in Lord Aberdeen's Collection, and became part of the Christy Collection in 1862. (British Museum; Christy Collection, M.I., 127.) Fig. 3 is carved from dull greenish-brown stone, polished; human face and arms; length, 205 mm. It was given in 1885 by Mr. A. W. (afterwards Sir Wollaston) Franks. (British Museum; Christy Collection, X2513.) Fig. 4 is of dark green stone, also polished; human face and arms; length, 275 mm. It was purchased with the Morel Collection in 1901 and bears a label, "Collection Dr. Amstelm; Foret des Ardennes." (British Museum, Ml. 1195.) Unfortunately, none of the specimens possess a locality (except the last, which is obviously incorrect), but they are probably from S. Domingo. Plate LI,V, Fig. 8. Finally, there is the beautiful specimen of stone carving shown on Plate LIV, 8, consisting of an entire axe and haft, carved from solid, fine-grained, pale-greenish stone, well polished. The design represents a petaloid celt fixed in a wooden haft which is secured from splitting by a binding above and below the blade. This axe, which is 316 mm. long, was given to the British Museum in 1830 by Mr. P. L. Strachan. All the information which accompanied it is contained in the following words :-" A curiously shaped Indian Battle Axe made of a green siliceous stone." (British Museum, 30, 5-8, 1.) MISCELLANEOUS STONE OBJECTS. Plate L V. Plate LV also shows a small selection from the miscellaneous stone objects in the collection. Tlle peculiar specimen, Fig. 5, was obtained in 1861, and is cut from greyish-brown trap-rock; the transverse section is a flattened oval and at the upper extremity the implement-for such it seems to be-is furnished with a well-defined cutting edge. The specimen is all the more interestinig since it seems to be a perfect example of the type to which belongs the fragment figured on Plate XXIII, k, of Fewkes' monograph; length, 205 mm. (British Museum; Christy Collection, M.I., 126.) Fig. 6, obtained in 1873, also cut from dark trap-rock, is in the form of an isosceles triangle with incurving sides; the edges are rounded and the curve seenis to have been produced by use as a polisher; length, 83; Buccament Valley, St. Vincent.

JOYCE.-Prehistoric Antiquities from the Antilles, in the British Mmtseum. 419 Fig. 7, obtained at the same time as Fig. 6, is cut from coarse black stone taking a dull polish; the edges are rounded; the peculiar asymmetry of outline is difficult to explain; diameter, 114 mm. It was found in St. Vincent. (British Museum; Christy Collection, M.I., 238.) Figs. 8 and 9 were both purchased at a sale in Londoii in 1904, together with the collar, three-pointed stone and large pestle shown on Pl. LIII, 2, Pl. LII, 2, and Pl. LIV, 7, respectively. They are said to be ornaments worn by Caqiques, and are cut from a peculiar grey and buff marbled stone which takes a high polish. They are very thin, the larger ineasuring only 5 mm. at the thickest part, and the edges are bevelled. The shape resembles half a Maltese cross, of which one pair of arms is considerably longer than the other, divided along the longer diameter; leng,ths, 212 min. and 142 mm. respectively. (British Museum; 1904, 10-19, 4 and 5.) PILLAR STONE. Plate L VI. A remarkable pillar-stone is shown on Plate LVI; it is a quadrangular column of white sandstone, sculptured on three faces with a standing male figure, that in the centre with arms locked over one arm of each of those on either side; the hands of all are laid flat across the body and the fingers interlaced. These figures have long hair hanging in spiral curls; their legs are wide apart, and between the calves of each is sculptured a grotesque human face with a kind of palmette springinlg from the head. The figures on either side of the central figure are incomplete, lacking one arm and leg, and the renlaining side of the column, and the top and bottom, are squared and dressed but left plain. A square vertical hole has been sunk in top and bottom. H., 610 mm.; B., 335 mm.; D., 210 mm. This pillar-stone came from the island of Nevis; it was acquired by Sir Graham Briggs, and in 1889 was given to the Christy Collection by Mr. (afterwards Sir Wollaston) Franks. (British Museum; Christy Collection, X4419.) POTTERY. The museum collection also includes a number of fragments of pottery from Barbados, St. Vincent and S. Domingo, but none of them are sufficiently note- worthy to merit any special remark.</page></plain_text>
