SIR-Casseb [1] hypothesizes that human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is "more clever" than human immuno- deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). One of his reasons is that HTLV-I, unlike HIV-1, has "an exceptionally low capability for causing death in the host." "Cleverness" is not a biological concept but rather an anthropomorphism. Casseb probably is referring to the biological success of a virus. The only measure of the success of an organism is Dar- winian-that is, successful viruses transmit more copies of their genes to new hosts, and unsuccessful ones transmit fewer (or none, thus dying out completely). As has been pointed out, it is not necessarily in the evolutionary interest of a virus to have low pathogenicity [2]. For example, some arthropod-borne vi- ruses are transmitted more efficiently when their host is debil- itated and unable to fend off insect vectors. HIV-1 seems to be particularly successful in transmitting itself to new hosts, al- though most transmissions probably take place when the host is feeling well. It is probable that host death caused by HIV-1 is merely an unfortunate (from the host's point of view) epi- phenomenon, although in fact we do not know if this is the case. HTLV-I may seem "clever" because it does not cause host mortality, but we cannot say that HIV-1 is less "clever" because it often kills its host. HIV-1, however deadly, seems to be re- markably evolutionarily successful at this point in time, and there seems to be no shortage of hosts for the virus to infect in the future. Daniel B.

This observation is not in disagreement with my published hypothesis [1]. I agree that viral adaptation in the host is critical for biological success, and it is usually driven by natural selection. However, my point was that human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is better adapted to humans than is HIV- 1 at this time. The reason is that it is a less pathogenic virus, and so has more time for transmission. Natural viral adaptation is slow and gradual, and in the case of HTLV-I in humans, it has probably taken thousands of years. In contrast, HIV-1 has not had time to adapt; it is thought to have begun infecting humans much more recently, only a few decades ago [2]. During adaptation, the transmission of some genes may con- tribute to the stability of the host cell, such as happens with the genes taxlrex of HTLV-I. Although similar genes are present in HIV-1, this adaptation, which is quite clever, has not been reported in HIV infection [3]. HIV-1 without the nef gene is less pathogenic, and the progression of HIV-1 disease seems to be only attenuated [4]. HIV-1 infection has the capacity to de- velop into the deadly immunosuppression state after 7-14 years, and this length of time seems to be enough to explain the millions of infections worldwide. However, during this time, the virulence of HIV-1 does not decrease, although we may be able to reduce it in the future with the use of new antiretroviral agents. Ebola virus is a good example of virulence-defeating viral adaptation [5]. Even though Ebola virus infection is the most pathogenic and transmissible viral disease in humans, few cases have been reported. These cases usually appear in short out- breaks that disappear when all the hosts have died. It seems that Ebola virus is a very new pathogen in humans and is not well adapted. If one agrees that evolutionary success is depen- dent upon adaptation in the host, reliable transmission, and low pathogenicity, then HTLV-I has been more successful than HIV-1.
