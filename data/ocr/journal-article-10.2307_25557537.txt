At the height of the Strangeways Prison disturbances in the spring of 1990, an English newspaper carried an eloquent cartoon il lustrating the condition of the jails. It reproduced Prisoners at Exercise, Vincent Van Gogh's painting of exactly one hundred years earlier, which now hangs in the Pushkin Museum, Moscow. Only the uniforms of some officials in the right hand corner had to be brought up to date. Bars, windows, walls, shadows, futility ? everything else is as it was. Brian Maguire's concentrated exhibition of eighteen canvasses brings even closer to home the challenge to art which imprison ment represents. Even the titles of the pictures strike at the cen tral preoccupation ? Prison painting IX, Cages of Self, Ex traditee ... In the past, Maguire's work has sometimes struck one as uncomfortably sentimental: for example, Liffey Suicides (1983/4) is too close to both hackneyed Victorian images of fallen women falling off Waterloo bridge and to well-known twentieth century pictures of Anna Livia: the title's unyielding bluntness attempts to recover what the picture has long ago surrendered to its sources. However, the new work is more thoroughly organised, both in terms of scale and imagery. Even the biggest of these canvasses, Forms of Visiting, is a good deal more com pact than the work of the mid-Eighties. Forms of Visiting exemplifies an important structural compo nent of this exhibition. The canvas is dramatically divided on a horizontal axis, and the two resulting areas are disposed in a paradoxical, even shocking manner. Above, are two figures mating; these are (we are to believe) beneficiaries of some form of prison visiting, and it is an essential feature of the picture that it scarcely guides us towards any judgment as to the mimetic, ironic, visionary, absurd or whatever basis of the representation. For below, is painted the top of a gothic window. The architec tural reference requires soaring elevation: instead, the pointed arch is subordinate to the entire (half) picture overhead. Elsewhere ladders, internal bay-windows, perform a similar disorientation of space. The radical arrangement of levels is extended in The Foun dation Stones. Here, despite the title, a great tunnel opens up, with cat-walks in blue/yellow and a golden arched ceiling. Like the mensuration of levels ? flood-levels, record-levels, danger levels ? seven yellow/green marking bars are shown to the top left. Architecture pervades these pictures, emphasising the per sistence of physical structures of a by-gone style within the psychic domination of human figures. Prisons, it is clear, are churches. The arches say so, even when they are at the bottom of the pic ture. Inversion occurs elsewhere, as in Two Views of Lovers with its upsidedown heads. It will be clear that Maguire takes familiar risks, but the execu tion of the pictures justifies his reliance on powerful if limited emo tional ranges. The smaller, squarer canvasses tend to preside over more expansive ranges. The use of colour is sure, and at its best recalls the magnificent (and large) Women, City Street (1984). The constant cross-reference between prison and love is not simp ly a gesture towards Van Gogh or Wilde: the figures blaze angri ly as if they were removed from us, the ecclesiastical nooks and crannies sneer without a trace of anthropomorphism. To some, this may be old-fashioned painting, but then Van Gogh in 1890 was copying an earlier woodcut by Dore. What's new? Certainly not the theme of this work. What's new? In Maguire, exactly the paradoxical harmony of disturbance and assurance. Hugh Maxton</page></plain_text>
