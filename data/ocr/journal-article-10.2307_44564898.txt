Baird* Institute of Transportation and Traffic Engineering, University of California THE PURPOSE of conducting a series of collision experiments involving the Liberty Mutual Survival Car II (LM car) was to determine its collision performance for representative exposures. The two types selected were intersection and rear-end collisions; these exposures collectively represent the most frequently occurring types and, in addition, they include an opportunity for evaluating the relative protective performance of the LM vehicles undergoing front -end im- pact. These data are available because for every rear-end collision and every intersection type collision, there is a striking vehicle subjected to front -end impact. Consequently, the selection of these two types of impacts provided a rea- sonably complete evaluation of the potential protective qualities and innovations embodied in the LM car. Full-scale crash evaluation of the LM car, in terms of its collision performance, was selected as the only reliable * The authors respectfully dedicate this paper to the late Frank J. Crandell, Vice-President, Engineering, Liberty Mu- tual Insurance Co., for his contribution to the cause of im- proved motorist safety during a period when such efforts were unpopular; particularly for his far-sighted conviction that a properly designed motorist seat represents the greatest single advance to the cause of reducing injuries from ve- hicular accidents. approach for obtaining performance data under the multi- plicity of conditions and variables that exist during an actual collision. Laboratory simulations of the contemplated ex- posures are valuable for assisting the design engineer in refining his concepts. Experience has shown that the many interrelated and often unanticipated factors occurring during a collision cannot be accounted for at the design level, with any reasonable confidence. Consequently, it would be a disservice to the public, as well as to those responsible for manufacturing safe motor vehicles, to have a proposed safety car design developed that does not include full-scale crash evaluations of the prototype in order to avoid release of statements not based on fact. On the face of it, one may conclude that some innova- tions are so obviously advantageous that they need no evalu- ation before placing them into operation. Experience has shown, however, that this position is erroneous, even with respect to the simplest of devices. To be an improvement worthy of use, a safety innovation not only must perform the protective feature intended by its designer but simul- taneously must not diminish the level of safety achieved by other innovations that may be even more important. This series of collision experiments brought to 92 the number of instrumented, full-scale, collisions conducted during the past 18 years at UCLA. Each of these 92 engineer- ing experiments has provided objective findings concerning ABSTRACT Engineering evaluations of the collision performance for the Liberty Mutual Safety Car and the 1966 Chevrolet sedan were made, consisting of two 30 mph rear-end and two 40 mph intersection collision experiments. Methodology pro- vided comparative analysis of functional characteristics for five types of seats, each studied for different exposure con- ditions. Five conditions of restraint were included for four sizes of occupants; the anthropometric dummies, their re- straints, seats, and crashing cars all carried appropriate trans- ducers. Seven high G -tolerant, high-speed cameras, carried by the crashing cars provided close-up continuous monitoring of these quarter -second collision sequences, supported by many more tower and ground level special photographic units arranged about the collision scene. Data from photo- graphic, electronic and related instrumentation are presented using photographic and graphical techniques designed to facilitate comprehension. 1603</page><page sequence="2">1604 D.

The identification and quantification of such research findings provide valuable guideposts to designers of automobiles as well as to designers of highways concerned with protective barriers and acces- sories of this nature. Detailed engineering evaluation of the complex multivariant phenomena attending automobile collisions requires full-scale experimentation. Other forms of inquiry, laboratory studies, case accident studies, statis- tical treatment of accident data, and so forth, are equally important to the basic objectives of reducing highway traffic deaths and to the frequency and severity of motorists' in- juries. These latter approaches, however, will not provide insight to all of the mechanisms by which motorists' injuries occur and are of a less objective form, having a lower re- liability factor concerning contributions to design of im- proved safety systems. FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT The ITTE-UCLA Field Station for collision research is located adjacent to the U. S. Naval Station, Long Beach, Calif. The fenced-in facility includes an asphalt surface, trailers and building for supporting activities, and several towers for photographic observation of the collisions. Four mobile vans provide research support facilities as follows: machine shop, electronics shop, photographic shop, and project control center. An aluminum monorail guide track, installed on the level asphalt runway, provides the means for controlling the direction of crash vehicles. Other oper- ational techniques, incorporated in recent years, are reported in prior publications. (1-3)* Two experimental cars were provided for evaluation by Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., Boston, Mass. These vehicles were 1960 Chevrolet Bel Air 4-door sedans, modified as indicated in a subsequent section on the Liberty Mutual Survival Car II. To provide a third vehicle of the same make, model and year for correlation with these LM Chevrolets, a 1960 Chevrolet 4-door sedan, was purchased. In addition, two 1966 Chevrolet Bel Air 4-door sedans were used in this series. The manner in which these vehicles were selected for the two types of impacts is explained in a subsequent section, "Automobile Assign- ment Scheduling." EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE Full-scale collision operations require months of planning and preparation; it is therefore essential that each experi- ment is successfully completed, as planned. The crash cars are controlled directionally by a front bumper -mounted phenolic shoe that slides in an aluminum monorail guide track secured to the asphalt pavement. The speeds of the crash cars and the synchronization of their positions at im- pact are accomplished by a tow car connected to the crash cars by a steel cable through appropriately arranged sheaves, as shown in Fig. 1. Adjustment of the tow cable lengths assure perfect synchronization for the type of impact in- * Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. 90° . .

The tow car accelerates to the predetermined ve- locity and holds that velocity until the tow cables auto- matically detach from the crash cars twenty feet before impact. During the last split second before impact, the crash vehicles progress without directional or speed con- straints and crash in a manner that corresponds to real ac- cidental collisions. The methodology fox rear-end collisions is simplified because the struck car is stationary and the striking car is accelerated to its predetermined impact speed in a manner previously described (Fig. 2). Operational pro- cedures for the controller, the two instrumentation pace vehicles, and the two crash vehicles are described in Ref. 1. METHODOLOGY The Liberty Mutual Survival Car II represents a safety - customized 1960 Chevrolet 4-door sedan. In order to prop- erly evaluate the extent to which motorist protection had been improved it was necessary not only to crash the Liberty Mutual cars but also to crash non -modified cars to provide a basis for comparison. Logically, the 1960 LM Chevrolets should be compared with 1960 production Chevrolets. This would have been the procedure for the UCLA evaluation if the LM cars could have been obtained in the early 1960's. Perhaps, understandably, the LM engineers were reluctant to subject their cars to destructive tests before the public had seen the product of their nine years of research and de- velopment. The LM cars were placed on exhibit throughout most of the United States and after serving this purpose, the cars were released to UCLA in 1965. Rather than compare these 1960 LM vehicles with 1960 production models that were now regarded as old cars, the UCLA engineers elected to match the 1960 LM cars against the latest production models then available, namely, 1966 Chevrolet Bel Air 4-door sedans. This series of experiments consisted of two rear-end col- lisions at 30 mph and two center side -impact collisions, each car traveling 40 mph. In the rear-end collisions a 1966 production vehicle was used to strike the rear of a 1960 LM car in Experiment 88; a 1966 production vehicle was struck in the rear by another 1966 production Chevrolet in Experiment 89. This procedure provided the basis for comparison between the motorist collision protection of the LM vehicle, as contrasted with the motorist protection of the same type of vehicle, but six years newer. Variables under study for rear-end collision Experiments 88 and 89 are shown in Fig. 3. The first of the two intersection collisions of this se- ries, Experiment 91, involved two LM cars while the sec- ond experiment consisted of a 1966 production vehicle struck by a 1960 production model. These two experi- ments provided a comparison of the relative protective qualities of an LM design versus a new 1966 car when they are struck at the drivers side. In addition, the relative pro- tection provided for the striking car when it is a 1960 LM survival car as contrasted with a striking car that is a 1960 production Chevrolet was evaluated, for the 40 mph side impact, Experiment 91 and Experiment 92, respectively. Variables investigated for these two side -impact experi- ments are shown in Fig. 4. Although other impact configurations could be devised to further evaluate advantages and possible disadvantages accrued from the various modifications made in the Liberty Mutual Survival Car, it was felt that this experimental plan provided sufficient data for an objective appraisal of the merits or deficiency of the modifications made by Liberty Mutual. Automobile Assignment Scheduling - The purpose of de- veloping an automobile assignment schedule is to determine those experiments that allow the use of repaired vehicles and those which require one or both of the vehicles not to have been previously crashed. Assuming that a collision could produce changes in the collision response character- istics of a car that would not be entirely corrected by re- pairs, such influence may be circumvented by making cer- tain that the repaired section is not directly involved in a subsequent collision. In referring to Fig. 5, it may be seen that Vehicles 1, 2, and 3 were used in two different colli- sion experiments; each of these vehicles was repaired before using it under conditions that brought no previously impacted and repaired structures into contact.

Fig. 4 - Variables under study, side-impact collisions (Experiments 91 and 92) Vehicle Seat Assignment - It is logical to consider the properly designed seat as one form of motorist restraint. To facilitate use of seat and chest belts, these restraints should be installed in the seat and this combination makes the seat the most important single contribution to motorist protection that may be provided in a car. The relative performance of these more complex integrated seat designs, as typified by the LM capsule chair and the Cox seat as contrasted with conventional production seat designs, was the most important aspect of this study. Five seat types representing three basic designs were evaluated; the design features are described and illustrated in a later section. Seat types evaluated were: 1. The Liberty Mutual capsule chair (Fig. 6(a)). 2. The General Motors bucket seat with head support (Fig. 6(b)). 3. The Cox safety seat (Fig. 6(c)). 4. A production bench seat (Fig. 6(d)). 5. A Ford bucket seat (Fig. 6(e)). Except for the LM and Cox seats, the seats were of con- ventional structural design. The two 30 mph rear-end collisions both utilized 1966 Chevrolet sedans as striking cars; they were equipped front EXPERIMENT IMPACT CONFIGURATION REMARKS Stationary Struck Car: Modified s - ' 1960 Chevrolet Liberty Mutual 0 (LM Design) Survival Car X-88 .

The 1960 LM Chevrolet rear-ended in Experiment 88 was equipped with a 1963 Ford bucket seat for the driver and an LM seat for the front seat passenger (Fig. 7(a)). The rear seat was a conventional bench seat, retrofitted with a webbing head support (left rear) and a shelf mounted head- impact pad (right rear). The 1966 Chevrolet rear-ended in Experiment 89 was equipped the same, except that the driver's seat was a 1966 GM Astro bucket seat with head support (Fig. 7(b)). The seat types identified in Figs. 6(a-e) were also evalu- ated for the 40 mph intersection collisions, Experiments 91 and 92. The striking car was in each experiment a 1960 Chevrolet; the struck car was a 1960 Chevrolet for Experi- ment 91 and a 1966 Chevrolet for Experiment 92.

M. SEVERY, ET AL. The seat assignment for Experiment 91 is presented by Fig. 8(a). Not every seat could be evaluated for every ex- posure position but it was possible to develop sufficient ex- posure data with these two experiments and with prior ex- periments involving the bench and Cox seats to provide a performance evaluation of these units. The seat arrangement for Experiment 92 is shown by Fig. 8 (b) and a comparison of this figure with the prior figure indicates the opportunities these seating assignments allow for their evaluation. INSTRUMENTATION General - Regardless of the care and thought applied to developing an effective experimental plan and methodology, the collision event is over in a quarter second and this brief period is too short for meaningful direct observation, even by the trained observer. The value of a successfully con- ducted series of collision experiments directly relates to the quality and comprehensiveness of its instrumentation.

Pre- and post -crash observations, in terms of locations of instrumentation, condition of lights, windows, door locks, seat adjustments, belt adjustments as well as collision deformation, skid pattern, debris location, glass damage, among others, represent another category of in- formation important to this study. Photographic instrumentation ranges from conventional motion picture cameras to high G -tolerant, moderate-speed motion picture cameras, and from automatically fired still cameras to high-speed motion picture cameras. Depending on requirements, as many as a dozen different types of cam- eras and a total of 40 photographic units have been used for a given experiment. In the two types of experiments pre- sented, Fig. 9 provides the camera assignment for rear-end collisions and Fig. 10 presents camera assignments for the intersection collision experiments. Camera specifications and details on other types of instrumentation are given in Table 1. The Rear -End Collisions - In addition to the camera as- signments about the crash scene, several were positioned on the crash cars; these camera locations as well as specific dummy locations, positioning of transducers both within the car and within dummies, the seat types and where they were installed, as well as description of other accessories, are identified in Figs. 7(a,b). The Intersection Collision - As may be expected, the impacting vehicles and dummy occupants carry the majority of instrumentation used in this series. Camera, accelerom- eter, tensiometer, dummy and seat assignments are depicted in Figs. 8 (a, b), along with appropriate collateral informa- tion. THE LIBERTY MUTUAL SURVIVAL CAR II During the past two decades several individuals from the engineering and medical professions who were involved with work relating to vehicular collisions have attempted to de- sign and build safety modifications into the motor vehicle; in some cases these designs represented changes that would assure reduction in injuries during motor vehicle collisions. For example, several years ago, Roy C. Iininger, M.D., Chair- man, Colorado Safety Car Committee, Littleton, Colo., modified a passenger vehicle so as to provide improved mirrors for rear vision, padded dashboards, a safety steering wheel, special restraint harness and similar features, some of which are still in the discussion phase. Other interested medical professionals have manifested their frustrations in wanting a safer automobile through modification of their own passenger vehicles and by issuing brochures to patients they treat to improve their knowledge of safety devices. In a similar manner, engineers have at times modified their personal vehicles in an effort to evaluate innovations they consider represent improvements in motorist safety. Un- questionably, many other individuals and groups have at- tempted to accomplish this same objective using unique or ingenious techniques that were less publicized and there- fore not of common knowledge. The late Frank J. Crandell, vice-president and chief</page><page sequence="11">COLLISION PERFORMANCE, LM SAFETY CAR 1613 engineer for Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., his associate chief engineers, Arthur Gordon and Frank Burkett, and project engineer Charles Sparreil, developed the design for Survival Car II. The Liberty Mutual Survival Car II represents the result of more than nine years of research and experimenta- tion relating to the basic principles of "packaging the pas- senger." The LM engineers recognized their responsibility to produce more than just a conceptual design and took the necessary precautions to calibrate, in a realistic manner, the seat strength and similar factors to be reasonably certain that their performance would correspond to the safety as- sertions accompanying the publicity of this vehicle. Studies have shown that for the majority of cars operating on both urban and rural streets, there is only a driver present and that where only two motorists are riding in a given car, al- most without exception, the passenger is seated in the right front seat. These observations point up the importance of front seat units as compared to rear seat units and the degree of protection that may be afforded motorists through proper design of these seat units. The completed LM Survival Car II (4) is shown by Fig. 11. In viewing this figure, the most conspicuous changes to this passenger vehicle are the front seat units; without question a properly designed inte- grated safety seat represents the greatest single contribution to passenger protection possible for current automobile de- sign. Referring to Fig. 11, the front seat units, 1, were referred to by the LM engineers as capsule chairs designed to restrain the driver and passenger while undergoing 30 G deceleration forces, whether from the front, the rear, or from the side. The rear seat passenger's armrest, 2, was designed to resist lateral movement without injury -producing forces being concentrated at the passenger hips or waist. Still referring to Fig. 11, restraining lap belts and shoulder harnesses, 3, were installed for all seats. A flexible steering shaft, 4, capable of transmitting the necessary torsional forces for steering and yet one that would buckle under the axial loads of a forward collision, was installed between the firewall and the steering gear box. A slip-type steering tube, 5, was installed between the steering wheel and the instrument panel; this tube had a telescoping capacity of 8 in. during a crash. Head restraints, 6, were applied to all seat posi- tions. A rectangular steering wheel, 7, was installed for the stated purpose of preventing breaking or bruising of knee caps; this wheel size and shape was very similar to the 1957 models of Chrysler steering wheels. The LM steering wheel, 8, had a reduced diameter for better visibility by short drivers. Improved maneuverability was also an objective Fig. 11 - LM Survival Car II</page><page sequence="12">1614 D. M. SEVERY, ET AL. of the LM engineers through the use of the smaller and squar- ish steering wheel, 9. Unit body construction listed by 10 is an error but could have contributed greater collapsibility --on the theory that passengers would sustain lower peak acceleration during collision. An automatic fire control system, 11, utilizing carbon dioxide with appropriate dis- persal locations, was included in this vehicle. A safety hy- draulic brake device, 12, was installed that reportedly pre- vents appreciable loss of fluid during brake failure; a warning light, mounted on the instrument panel is electrically con- nected with this device to advise the driver of partial brake failure. Included with the capsule chairs are rollover bars, 13, to reduce the likelihood of head impacts during roll- overs. Power brakes, 14, and power steering, 15, were in- cluded. Recognizing the limitations of the safety glass in laminated windshields, the LM engineers fabricated a wind- shield having a double thickness of the polyvinyl butyral interlay er, 16. This change was made to provide greater resistance to penetration, without necessarily increasing the forces applied to the human head during impact. Wind- shield transmission of ultraviolet rays was reportedly reduced 95% by the use of "Saflex" interlayer, 17. The other win- dows of the car were tinted, 18, for the purpose of reducing the heat load, reportedly by 30%. The vehicle was provided with reflective license plates, 19, for greater viewability at night. Armrests, 20, were provided for the driver and passengers to reduce fatigue. An Alert -O -Matic signal sys- tem, 21, was installed for the purpose of awakening the driver, should he fall asleep; if the driver does not awaken the vehicle is brought to a stop by this device. The tires were modified to reportedly improve the resistance to skid- ding on wet, icy and snow -covered roads by a technique known as " Micro -siping," 22. In addition, side reflection mirrors were installed for greater driver viewability and a smooth hood over the engine was a design consideration to reduce the injury hazards to pedestrians. With respect to the brake safety device, it functioned so there would always be at least two -wheel brakes in operation, should a hydraulic tubing fail. The 1967 domestic vehicles use the added protection of dual master cylinders but at the time that this LM device was installed, seven years ago, it represented a considerable advance over domestic braking systems then available on production cars. THE LM CAPSULE CHAIR Two basic concepts of passenger protection are: 1. To restrain the motorist by at least a lap belt and position him within a large passenger compartment, one in which the interior surfaces are sufficiently remote that he cannot be flailed against them, while restrained by the lap belt unit. 2. To ascertain that the restrained motorist is seated within a passenger compartment that has its interior surfaces developed very close to the driver, especially from his shoul- der level downward, and to include a head support; that the interior surfaces in close proximity are modified in form and energy absorbing properties to reduce the likelihood of injury when the motorist is crushed against it. From the current studies a third concept should be added, that of a capsule chair, in which the immediate proximity of the vehicle interior is of secondary importance because the motorist is rather effectively protected within the con- fines of the capsule chair or motorist protective envelope. This was the motorist protective concept selected by the LM engineers because it was not possible to secure sufficient body clearance within the medium size automobile to evalu- ate the maximum space concept. The capsule chair in- cludes the concept of the integrated protective motorist seat but improves motorist safety by including a roll bar and side impact "wings" that in no small measure increases the chances of survival for motorist impacted at these vulnerable points. A feature of the capsule chair is that it may swing like a swivel chair to facilitate entrance and exit. In addition to the shoulder "wings" the arms of the chair provide addi- tional protection against the collision forces of a side im- pact. The capsule chair also has a requirement to move fore-and-aft to accommodate motorists of different heights. The armrests and shoulder protection for side impacts is best portrayed by reference to Fig. 12 depicting the support- ing structure of the capsule chair; titanium alloy tubing, having an ultimate fiber stress of 125,000 psi, was selected by the LM engineers to provide high strength for relatively lightweight conditions. Although this tubing of itself would not be capable of resisting the side -impact intrusion forces at 40 mph, the motorist sits within this protective shield and the seat frame is sufficiently rigid to displace the motor- ist out of range of the intruding forces of a striking car while partially resisting direct penetration. This concept is sound and merits serious consideration in future designs. Fig. 12 - Skeleton of LM capsule chair</page><page sequence="13">COLLISION PERFORMANCE, LM SAFETY CAR 1615 Referring to Ref. 3, "During the bus side -impact experi- ment, it was observed that armrests provided a significant improvement in passenger safety by first, preventing (unre- strained) individuals from being ejected from their seats laterally to strike passengers across the aisle, and second, preventing the larger passenger from crushing against a smaller passenger who may be seated in his path." In addi- tion, evaluation of the Cox -Hilton (England) integrated safety seat (3) showed that even the relatively subtle con- touring of the bucket seat configuration provided substantial resistance to the fully belted dummy before the lateral forces peaked on the belt tensiometers. The exceptional effectiveness of the armrests and shoulder wings for the LM seat will be described in a subsequent section. The basic design of the LM seat is further illustrated by Fig. 13. SEAT DESIGN The concept employed by the LM capsule chair for pack- aging the passenger consisted of developing a nominally nonpenetrable protective structure, in the form of a seat enveloping the motorist from the sides and rear, and includ- ing a built-in full harness restraint for frontal collision forces. The head support was also structured to resist roof collapse. Padding was added for comfort and to assure acceptable distribution of collision forces to the stronger areas of the motoristi body during collision. The Cox integrated safety seat was designed to sustain the added forces of a motorist belted to it during collision without failure to either seat or anchorage, but, unlike the LM capsule chair, the Cox seat design did not include the occupant packaging concept and the nonpenetrability concept designed into the LM seat.

(6) This design rather effectively prevents lateral displacement of the occupant relative to the seat during side impacts (3) but does not provide the same measure of protection or de- gree of resistance to intrusion afforded by the LM design. The structural design of the Cox seat, Fig. 15, (5) represents a great improvement over conventional bucket seat design. For the most part, only engineers responsible for seat design appreciate the difficulty of constructing a seat suit- able for the great variety of body sizes and forms - - a seat that also limits the onset of fatigue, to the extent possible, and one that provides the body support and adjustability needed for attentive driving. Seat design is challenging and the preoccupation with this difficult task has probably diverted much needed attention from the vital factor a car seat should include, namely, motorist protection from col- lision forces. Structurally, the motor vehicle bucket seat corresponds approximately to a lightweight, padded living room chair. It has a readily compressible, bundled -wire substructure sup- port attached to a lightweight tubular frame (Fig. 16) (6) that is difficult to anchor effectively and that provides inadequate body support from any direction. Unable to support its own weight during collision deceleration, the conventional ear seat design cannot be used for attaching protective restraints; as a result Fig. 14 - Cox seat frame FORWARD MEMBER IN COMPRESSION v TOP BELT SUPPORT FORWARD LOAD ^ 4950 lbs ^ ' l' ^ MAIN VERTICAL COLUMN ^ IN TENSION MJl ANGULAR WEB- LOWER BELT F,*,N6 FRONT ^ REAR MOUNTING 24"- MOUNTING 3505 lbs.

SEVERY, ET AL. of this deficiency, seat belts have to be extended to the floor and shoulder belts to roofs, doorposts, rear seat or floor points for anchorage. These nonappealing, troublesome locations make their use by motorists less probable and pro- vide compromises in protection for those determined to avail themselves of whatever protection is at hand. What the authors are suggesting is that the time has long since passed when gross changes in seat design were obviously needed; a car seat which does not act as a motorist's inner protective shield against collision forces is failing in its most vital role. ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS Of the four LM crashes reported by this paper, the two 30 mph rear-end collisions will be analyzed first, followed by the analysis and findings for the two 40 mph intersection collisions. For each experiment the struck vehicle will be analyzed first, followed by analysis of the striking vehicle, with reference to other findings deferred until the section "Conclusions and Recommendations." In general, the analy- sis and findings for each experiment will include the follow- ing topics: Vehicle collision performance and peak accelerations. Passenger kinematics and peak accelerations. Protection provided by various restraint systems. Acceleration curves of occupants, vehicles and seat struc- ture. Vehicle collision dynamics including charts of positions of impact and rest. Description of post -crash observations. There were very significant differences observed between the collision performance of the 1960 and 1966 Chevrolets, between the capsule chair and the conventional bench seat, and between the integrated harness and the cross -chest lap belt combination harness; these observations will be made in connection with the section "Conclusions and Recommen- dations." Fig. 16 - Conventional bucket seat frame FINDINGS - REAR-END COLLISIONS EXPERIMENT 88 - A 1960 LM Chevrolet 4-door sedan (Liberty Mutual configuration) was stationary when reàr- ended by a 1966 production Chevrolet sedan; the impact was an "in-line" rear-end collision with the rear of the LM Chevrolet being directly opposed by the front end of the striking 1966 Chevrolet. Passenger vehicle designs have bumpers almost flush with front -end and rear-end body sheet metal panels; consequently, speeds of impact as low as 10 mph will damage body sheet metal sections, even though initially involving only bumper -to -bumper contact. Bumpers as presently designed are little more than parking guards and provide very little resistance to impact, even at moder- ate speeds; considering the grossly inadequate height of seatbacks common to most domestic vehicles, these "soft" bumpers do serve to reduce the injury-producing forces transmitted to the improperly supported motorist during rear-end collisions. This example of interrelated safety factors shows how changes to improve one factor may be detrimental to other motorist protection features. Domestic cars should have more collapse resistant bumpers, but such improvement should follow, not precede, other more im- portant modifications that would ensure motorist protection from rear-end collision whiplash. The 1966 Chevrolet traveling 30 mph, crushed into the rear of the stationary 1960 LM Chevrolet, advancing it 2 ft in the initial 150 milliseconds. The striking 1966 Chevrolet front -end at this instant sustained more collapse than the 1960 Chevrolet rear-end (Fig. 17), even though the opposite relation is more frequently identified for rear-end collisions. This difference is partially attributed to the fact that the struck 1960 Chevrolet has a full frame extending to the rear bumper, while the 1966 Chevrolet design is based on col- lapse principles of unit body construction using a perimeter frame. Almost simultaneous with bumper contact, sheet metal contact at substantially higher elevations presents resistance above the car center of mass elevation; as the collision collapse action advances, the rear-end of the struck Fig. 17 - 1960 rear-ended Chevrolet receives less damage than 1966 striking Chevrolet (Experiment 88)</page><page sequence="15">COLLISION PERFORMANCE, LM SAFETY CAR 1617 Fig. 18 - 1960 Chevrolet, 150 ms, being rear-ended by 1966 Chevrolet (Experiment 88) Fig. 19 - Transducer patterns, 30 mph rear-end collisions (Experiment 88)</page><page sequence="16">1618 D.

Struck Car Occupants, Experiment 88 - The driver's cap- sule chair in the LM car was replaced by a 1963 Ford bucket seat, having dimensions and design representative of the average domestic single passenger automobile seat. The drivers head and upper torso (Fig. 18) have forced his seat into a reclined position, primarily as a result of failure of the forward anchorages. He was still in a noninjury -produc- ing posture as his seatback impacted the knees of the passen- ger behind him, causing a 33 G chest acceleration at 120 ms. His head then slammed into the unyielding lap of the left rear adult seated behind him causing a peak head accelera- tion of 51 G at 145 ms (Fig. 19). This high head acceleration was partially attributed to the unnaturally hard composition of his head. Elastic rebound of the driver -seat combination caused him to undergo whiplash (Fig. 20), and his adverse posture is readily contrasted with that of the right front seat passenger in the LM seat (Fig. 21). Fig. 20 - Driver of struck car in Ford seat undergoing whip- lash, 170 ms (Experiment 88) Referring to the motion picture analysis for the occupants of this struck 1960 Chevrolet, the driver kinematics were described in connection with Figs. 18 and 20. During this time, the right front seat passenger seated in an LM capsule chair showed no evidence of exposure to injury, because of the protection derived from this contour seat. The seat pedestal base Hexed the floor pan but the seated passenger maintained a normal posture throughout the impact. His chest sustained a peak acceleration of 11 G at 70 ms before his head recorded 12 G at 100 ms (Fig. 19). The LM seat and seatback reclined 30 deg rearward at its maximum ro- tation, bringing the back of the seat touching the knees of the right rear passenger (Fig. 22). His posture remained normal because the entire seat, including the base, rotated backwards in an energy absorbing manner. Also, because the floor deformed, the springback of the seat was nominal and the occupant did not show a rebound inertia effect that would be common for a condition in which the floor pan was not allowed to yield. The right rear passenger received a 15 G chest accelera- tion at 65 ms while undergoing whiplash (Fig. 19). His neck design had limited articulation and prematurely reached its maximum excursion (30 G head peak at 90 ms) before his head could rotate 90 deg and strike a 1 in. thick pad of plastic installed on the rear window shelf for evaluation. The pad and the webbing net are shown in Fig. 23. Exten- sion of padding from the rear seatback with a smooth transi- tion to the rear window shelf is a proposed method for mini- mizing head and neck injuries resulting from rear-end collisions. The head of the left rear passenger impacted the head support net installed by Liberty Mutual with sufficient force to partially tear it from its roof anchor (Fig. 24). Because of this effective restraining action, his head received only 18 G at 60 ms and his chest also received 18 G at 70 ms (Fig. 19); whiplash action was prevented as the net arrested the head before it was displaced significantly rearward. Striking Car Occupants, Experiment 88 - This 1966 Chev- rolet sedan with production bench seats, was occupied by two adult dummies in the front seat, a 6 -year -old sitting Fig. 21 - Passenger of rear-ended car rides out crash maintaining normal posture in LM chair (Experiment 88)</page><page sequence="17">COLLISION PERFORMANCE, LM SAFETY CAR 1619 in the right rear position, and a 3 -year -old standing on the seat in the left rear position. The driver was restrained by GM installed cross -chest lap belt combination installed in the 1966 Chevrolet to GM specifications. Analysis of moderately high speed film revealed that his upper torso and head were pitched forward slightly before being snubbed by the diagonal strap; the in- creased wedge action, caused by the more remote roof an- choring of the diagonal strap behind the doorpost (Fig. 25), amplified the submarining effect and forced the driver deeper into his seat. At this time the lap belt part of the diagonal chest combination recorded 270 lb at 105 ms. Simultaneously, his chest sustained a 12 G peak deceleration (Fig. 26). The right front adult passenger, restrained by an identical 3 -point GM belt, responded to the collision forces in a man- ner similar to the driver. His shoulder strap loaded to 6901b at 95 ms and at this same time his lap belt tension peaked at 3001b. His chest accelerometers simultaneously reached their peak of 15 G (Fig. 19). The belt system for the front seat occupants is effective for restraining a motorist from striking his head and chest against the front surfaces of the vehicle interior; however, the application of forces and abrasive action across the neck appears to represent a condition that may cause serious in- jury. Further study of this belt system appears indicated. The rear seat child dummies were thrown forward against the front seatback but not over it; they then rebounded with the right rear 6 -year -old being pitched onto his seat in a normal seated posture while the left rear 3 -year -old landed against the front seatback. As the left rear standee was thrown forward against the front seatback, it was moving rearward, owing to the rebound effect of the front seat oc- cupants from their diagonal belts, and this rearward force caused the 3 -year -old 's hips to be rebounded rearward as his head firmly struck the center cross-bow of the roof. Dur- ing the time the right rear 6 -year -old was pressing against the front seatback, he Hailed his head over it and struck his head firmly against the right front passenger's head who Fig. 22 - LM capsule chair rotated 30 deg rearward at its base during rear-ending (Experiment 88) Fig. 23 - Rear seat passengers' whiplash protection, shelf pad (right) and LM head support net (left) (Experiment 88) Fig. 24 - LM head support net partially torn from arresting whiplashing head</page><page sequence="18">1620 D.

Post-Collision Observations, Experiment 88 - Following collision, an inspection was made for purposes of noting significant changes. The struck 1960 LM Chevrolet was propelled 180 ft approximately straight ahead; it deviated to the left 27 ft during this 180-ft travel. The left front Ford bucket seat had a residual separation at the forward anchors of 4 in.; the right front LM capsule chair had a permanent rotation of 15 deg rearward about the pedestal base. Col- lision damage of this 1960 LM Chevrolet portrayed by Fig. 27(a) shows a moderate damage as contrasted to the 1966 Chevrolet rear-ended under identical conditions in Experi- ment 89 (Fig. 27(b)). However, frame peak acceleration for the stiffer frame collapse of the 1960 Chevrolet was Fig. 25 - Roof- anchored cross -chest belt wedges driver of striking car into submarined posture (Experiment 88).

The striking car, a 1966 Chevrolet, decelerated to rest 104 ft past the point of impact; it traveled a nearly straight course, deviating only 5 ft to the right during the 104 -ft runout. The 1960 LM Chevrolet was stationary when rear- ended by the 1966 Chevrolet; the struck car abruptly ac- celerated and the 30 mph striking car abruptly decelerated so that 1/10 sec after they contacted, they had crushed to- gether a maximum amount and had a common velocity (Fig. 28). Thereafter, restitution took place and 500 ms later, or 600 ms after the cars contacted, they separated as they continued to roll to their positions of rest.

The right front door was displaced rearward 3/16 in., deforming the center doorpost. Similar displacement oc- curred for the left side, even though the left front door had been removed and a compression strut installed in its place. The debris pattern for this 30 mph rear-end collision ex- tended from 15-45 ft past the point of impact along the path of the struck car. Neither vehicle had brakes applied and the transmissions of both vehicles had been placed in neutral. EXPERIMENT 89 - A 1966 production Chevrolet 4-door sedan was stationary when rear-ended by an identical 1966 Chevrolet, traveling 30 mph at impact (Fig. 30). As with Experiment 88, this collision was an in-line rear-end col- lision with the rear of the struck car completely overlapped by the front of the striking car. Principal differences be- tween Experiments 88 and 89, as reflected in Figs. 7 (a) and 7(b), were that in Experiment 88, the struck car was a 1960 LM Chevrolet and, in Experiment 89, the struck car was a 1966 Chevrolet. In Experiment 88, the struck car driver was seated in a 1963 Ford bucket seat and, in Experiment 89, the struck car driver was seated in a 1966 GM bucket seat, with a head support. The LM head support net was installed in the 1966 Chevrolet for the left rear passenger and a lin. thick pad was installed on the rear window shelf for the right rear passenger. In Experiment 89, the rear-ended 1966 Chev- Fig. 32 - Driver in GM bucket seat with head support ad- justed to 6-1/2 in. above top of backrest, providing an overall back and head support height of 31-1/2 in. (Ex- periment 89) rolet sustained a frame peak acceleration of 10 G, 30 ms after the bumpers contacted; the striking 1966 Chevrolet registered a frame peak deceleration of 13 G, also at 30 ms (Fig. 31). The 10 G frame acceleration for the 1966 Chev- rolet represents a significant difference for Experiment 89 as contrasted to the 17 G frame peak for the more rigid frame design of the 1960 LM Chevrolet (Fig. 19). Struck Car Occupants, Experiment 89 - The driver was seated in a GM bucket seat with an adjustable headrest (Fig. 32). During the initial phase of the collision his chest reached a peak acceleration of 9 G at 60 ms and simultaneously his pelvis also recorded 9 G (Fig. 31). These peaks occurred before the seatback deflected rearward appreciably. The inertial forces of his torso displaced the backrest into a semi- reclined position (Fig. 33). Yielding of the seatback formed an inclined plane (Fig. 34) which allowed the driver to slide beyond the protective limits of the head support. This con- dition produced a whiplash, notwithstanding the apparent head -supported condition shown in Fig. 32. The head of the driver reached a peak acceleration of 9 G at 165 ms, which occurred after he was forced into a whiplash condition. This whiplash action was snubbed by a combination of factors: The seatback struck the knees of the rear seat and occupant; the driver 's head was restrained from further rearward rotation by the head support. There- after, seatback restitution forces were sufficiently developed to rebound the driver against the steering wheel, causing him to flail his head over the wheel but not against the windshield. The right front seat passenger was seated in a Liberty Mutual capsule chair and was observed to tilt the chair, as measured at the headrest, 10 in. rearward. The passenger rode through the entire collision in a completely satisfactory manner, sustaining an 8 G chest acceleration at 85 ms and an 11 G head acceleration at 100 ms. The seat and backrest unit was sufficiently rigid to resist bending; the rearward rotation occurred between the base of the seat and the floor pan. Immediately after contact (20 ms), the seat frame Fig. 33 - Driver's GM backrest rotated rearward 30 deg beyond normal 1/10 sec after contact (Experiment 89)</page><page sequence="21">COLLISION PERFORMANCE, LM SAFETY CAR 1623 registered its peak acceleration of 11 G. At 110 ms, the headrest peaked with 12 G. The maximum rearward rota- tion of the LM capsule seat was 16 deg. At 65 ms after vehicle contact the unrestrained right rear adult passenger sustained a 12 G peak chest accelera- tion (Fig. 31). Thereafter, his head flailed rearward, striking the rear window shelf pad; as he rebounded forward he struck the header and received a 26 G blow to the front top of his head, 265 ms after the cars contacted one another. In contrast to the violent head movement and 26 G head acceleration of the right rear occupant, the left rear adult sustained only a 14 G head acceleration because his head pocketed into the LM head support net at 40 ms; his chest accelerometers reached a peak of 11 G at 65 ms.

Striking Car Occupants, Experiment 89 - The striking car for Experiment 89, as with Experiment 88, was a 1966 Chevrolet production vehicle, with standard bench seats. The driver and front seat passenger each were restrained by a roof -rail anchored cross -chest lap belt combination both front seat occupants underwent submarining with the belts lacerating their faces and necks, indicative of injuries likely to be sustained using the cross -neck design (Fig. 36). A peak tension force of 6101b was measured on the shoulder strap of the passenger's belt at 90 ms, while the lap portion of the passenger's and driver's belts measured 2201b and 2001b, respectively. Notwithstanding the adverse aspects of this cross -neck design, the belts did serve to prevent the Fig. 37 - Interlocked vehicles, both 1966 Chevrolets, traveled 48 ft to their positions of rest Fig. 38 - Permanent deformation, 30 mph rear-end collision (Experiment 89) front seat occupants from being pitched against the steering column and forward interior structures. The rear bench seat of this striking car was occupied by a 6 -year -old on the right side and a 3 -year -old on the left. Both children were seated and unrestrained. They were thrown forward from their seats during the collision with the shorter 3 -year -old striking the seatback and rebounding to his seat while the taller 6 -year -old on the right partially flexed over the seat- back before rebounding to his seat. Post -Collision Observations, Experiment 89 - The struck car was propelled 48 ft directly forward to its position of rest, still interlocked with the striking vehicle (Fig. 37). The relatively short run-out of these vehicles after collision, as contrasted to Experiment 88, was caused by sheet metal that had crushed against the left rear wheel. The gas tank on the struck car was torn free from its anchor straps and was found 25 ft from the impact point. The rear portion of the struck car was crushed forward 22 in. (Fig. 27(b)). The pressed channel frame members, supporting the trunk floor pan and bumper, buckled at the Fig. 39 - Collision damage to 1966 Chevrolet striking car (Experiment 89)</page><page sequence="23">COLLISION PERFORMANCE, LM SAFETY CAR 1625 frame attachment point of the bumper support (Fig. 38 (ar- rows)). However, the major portion of forward movement for the collapsing rear end section occurred in the frame transition member over the rear axle. This accordion action of the frame at the wheel -well area accounts for body metal encroachment, restricting rear wheel rotation. The result was braking action during the runout phase of the collision. The front-end damage of the striking car amounted to only 4 in. of permanent deformation (Fig. 39). This was comparatively minor for a 30 mph impact but is consistent with the relatively "soft" structure encountered by the strik- ing 1966 Chevrolet. FINDINGS - SIDE-IMPACT COLLISIONS EXPERIMENT 91 - This experiment was an intersection type collision in which two 1960 LM Chevrolets impacted while traveling 40 mph (Fig. 40). The collision was a 90 deg side impact, with the striking car directing its force to the driver's side of the struck car at the doorpost ; both vehicles received peak decelerations of 11 G at 25 ms after the start of this impact (Fig. 41). The LM chair resisted collision intrusion and served to moderate the forces applied to the driver. Following the car-to-car impact, the struck car spun out counterclockwise, rolling toward its right side as it rotated 180 deg; it then rocked toward its left side bringing the left side into contact twice with the pavement. During these rocker panel contacts, the left door, having been crushed by the impacting car, popped open (Fig. 42). De- tails concerning dummy occupant assignments, seat types, and instrumentation were presented in Methodology Section Fig. 40 - Intersection collision of 1960 LM Chevrolet traveling 40 mph, struck at center doorpost by 1960 LM Chevrolet, also traveling 40 mph (see Fig. 8(a)); for ease of reference, some of this informa- tion has been included with the transducer patterns (Fig. 43). Struck Car Occupants, Experiment 91 - The driver of the struck car was protected by an LM capsule chair.

The "packaged" driver was rather effectively, isolated from this extremely dangerous collision exposure, as shown for the struck car driver in Fig. 40. During impact, the motion picture films of the struck vehicle showed the driver, seated in his LM capsule chair, being forced leftward, causing his head to flail abruptly against the side glass. At the instant of maximum head- to -glass impact he sustained a 70 G blow at 45 ms and de- veloped a 3 in. diameter head -pressure area (Fig. 44). The striking car pushed the driver's door and side glass inward several inches accounting for the contact made by the driver's head with the side glass; if this glass had not displaced in- ward the adequately restrained driver probably would not have flailed his head far enough to contact the side glass. Notwithstanding the severity of the head impact, it was not hard enough to break the 1/4 in. tempered glass. The pres- ent rigidity, resistance to breakage, and weight of side win- dow glass allows it to deliver severe head impacts; the re- Fig. 44 - Driver's side impacted, head flails against side window (Experiment 91) Fig. 45 - Striking car encroachment partially resisted by rigid LM capsule chair duced inertia and increased flexibility of thinner glass that is at least as strong represents a change expected to reduce motorist injuries. The rigid LM driver's seat was displaced 5 in. to the right and forced the adult driver to his right, away from the in- truding striking car. The LM seat isolates the driver from the direct blow of the striking cár and moderates the forces applied to his body during impact. Most of the lateral force applied to the driver was by the armrest and shoulder wing of the capsule chair instead of by the restraining harness. This was evident by the relatively minor belt loads regis- tered for the driver: his shoulder strap, 1501b at 86 ms; his left lap beltsegment, 1801b at 101ms; his right lap belt seg- ment sustained 5201b at 95 ms. The driver sustained a punc- ture injury on his left upper arm from a sharp corner of the capsule chair frame. This normally fatal exposure position (40mph striking driver's door) appears to have been im- proved to perhaps no more serious than a moderate Injury exposure condition because of the LM capsule seat (Fig. 45). The right front seat passenger (Fig. 46(a)), was thrown to his left, loading the lap portion of the GM combination belt to 2901b at 85 ms and sustained an 11 G chest peak at 95 ms (Fig. 46(b)). The shoulder strap registered 370 lb at 130 ms as he flailed his head to the left striking the wing Fig. 46 - Struck car front passenger: a, pre- crash; b, 95 ms; c, head impact (Experiment 91)</page><page sequence="26">1628 D. M. SEVERY, ET AL. edge of the LM seat a significant blow (Fig, 46(c)). This right front passenger restraining action is also shown in Figs. 40 and 41. The right rear passenger was thrown against the right shoulder of the left rear passenger but his head did not reach the side glass. The lap belt and armrest provided accept- able protection for his particular position of exposure. His right lap belt segment registered only 901b at 65 ms (arm- rest contributed to restraint) and his chest sustained a 15 G acceleration at 75 ms. The magnitude of his head impact was not instrumented, except that motion picture coverage indicated it was not severe. The left rear seat passenger was thrown to his left, strik- ing his head against the rear doorpost with a 50 G blow at 65 ms; his head rolled forward from the doorpost cracking the glass 6 in. ahead of the rear edge of the window (Fig. 47). The left rear passenger's chest registered 60 G at 30ms, not- withstanding his full harness restraint. This observation is particularly significant because it provides a controlled comparison of relative collision protection afforded, using conventional seating and an LM full harness restraining sys- tem (left rear passenger chest, 60 G at 30 ms) and an LM capsule chair with LM full harness restraining system (left front driver's chest, 23 G at 20 ms). A condition that makes this contrast in protection even more conspicuous is the fact that the striking car was directed at the driver and that while slippage allowed it to work rearward relative to the struck car (Fig. 41), the maximum penetration was associated with the driver's door. The marked difference in collision per- formance shown by this illustration is attributed to the most significant variable, the protective action of the LM capsule chair. Striking Car Occupants, Experiment 91 - Contact between the striking and struck cars occurred, as planned, with the striking car centered on the center doorpost, 8-1/2 ft to the rear of the front bumper. As the vehicles crushed together the struck car, owing to its relative lack of penetration, slipped on by and the striking car locked into the struck car at the 10-1/2 ft position (Fig. 41). The unrestrained driver of the striking 1960 LM Chevrolet was thrown forward against the Liberty Mutual steering wheel. The steering wheel is square shaped with a retractable col- umn. The driver pushed the column inward without encoun- tering significant resistance until his knees struck the in- strument panel; his chest thereafter flexed forward against the retracted steering wheel and adjacent instrument panel sustaining a 14 G peak deceleration at 130 ms (Fig. 48). Twenty milliseconds later, his head struck the windshield header sustaining a 26 G blow. A split second later the driver's head, continuing its rightward movement, made a 4 in. scuff mark on the header and was badly slashed by the rear-view mirror bracket (Fig. 49). The driver continued his rightward trajectory until he was flung across the lap of the right front seat passenger. As the driver was pitched against the forward interior structure, his tilt -forward seat- back, Ford bucket seat, flailed forward, striking him in the back. The right front passenger, seated in a Liberty Mutual capsule chair with full shoulder and lap restraints, rode out the crash in a relatively uneventful manner (Fig. 50). The LM seat decelerated, reaching a peak of 15 G at 30 ms. The right front passenger, following impact, flailed his head to his right, sustaining a 45 G blow; * his chext peak accel- eration was 14 G at 105 ms. His right shoulder strap regis- tered 2901b; his right lap belt, 3801b at 105 ms, and the left portion of his lap belt 6601b at 115 ms. These dynamic *45 G blow: This right front seat passenger in the strik- ing car, except for the LM chair, would have struck his head against the side glass. However, the side glass was removed by the elimination of the door; motion picture analysis in- dicates the dummy either hit the LM chair shoulder wing, or reached the limits of neck articulation, or both, to ac- count for the rather high peak head acceleration he sus- tained.

Impact with the pavement was primarily with the 13-year-oldfs head, accounting for the low chest deceleration of 22 G at 3/4 sec after the cars contacted. The rear seat bench cushion pulled free during collision and shifted forward 1ft. The other unrestrained 13 -year -old in the rear seat, cen- ter position, was pitched forward and to his right, striking his shoulder against the left rear of the LM seatback and his head against the metal frame of the head support on this right front LM seat. He sustained a 22 G chest blow at 170 ms. The left rear adult passenger received his 26 G chest peak deceleration at 130 ms on being thrown initially forward, striking his knees against the already flailed forward back- rest of the driver's seat. The subsequent impact with the left front padded edge of the LM seat resulted in a subsequent lower peak deceleration. The adverse action of tilt -seat - backs is also shown in Fig. 40 as the rear seat passenger, for the striking car, is being pitched against the driver's seatback, already slamming forward against the driver's back. Although the left rear adult was thrown forward and to his right, he remained in the rear floor area at the right side.

Fig. 53 - Damage to left side was relatively light, con- sidering 40 mph impacting speed (Experiment 91) Fig. 54 - 1960 Plymouth traveling 40 mph was struck at center doorpost by another Plymouth traveling 40 mph; permanent deformation exceeded 1 ft (Experiment 60, conducted in 1961) forced outward 3 in. and remained there as the car spun to its position of rest. The struck car came to rest in posi- tions shown in the next section dealing with Experiment 92. The left front door latch failed, the left rear window was cracked from a head impact, and the left rear tire blew allowing the wheel rim to gouge the asphalt. The permanent intrusion to the impacted left side did not exceed 6 in. (Fig. 53). This is in marked contrast to the at least doubled penetration for the struck 1960 Plymouth of prior Experi- ment 60, owing to the inadequate lower attachment of the doorpost associated with this semi-unit body design (Fig. 54). The striking car, following collision, came to rest as shown in the collision dynamics chart included in the next section dealing with Experiment 92. Collision deformation to the 1960 LM Chevrolet front end was 11 in. (Fig. 55). Following the collision, the cars were rolled onto their sides to allow photographs to be taken of their underbodies as a means for illustrating the permanent deformation (Figs. 56(a) and 56(b)). Fig. 55 - Front-end damage to 1960 LM Chevrolet in 40 mph side-impact collision (Experiment 91) Fig. 56 (a) - Struck 1960 LM Chevrolet underbody, showing permanent deformation to driver's side (Experiment 91)</page><page sequence="29">COLLISION PERFORMANCE, LM SAFETY CAR 1631 EXPERIMENT 92 - This experiment was an intersection collision and, like prior Experiment 91, the striking car im- pacted the left center doorpost of the struck car. Both ve- hicles were traveling 40 mph at the time of impact. In place of the two 1960 LM Chevrolets of Experiment 91, the striking car was a production 1960 Chevrolet and the struck car was a production 1966 Chevrolet (Fig. 57). Details concerning dummy occupant assignment, seat types, and instrumentation were presented in the section on Methodol- ogy (see Fig. 8(b)). On impact, the struck car slid by the contact position 15 in. before positive lock-in of the two vehicles occurred; this observation was contrasted with the 24 in. of slippage for the LM car of Experiment 91. The impacted car's right side leaned low as it spun counterclockwise; this brought the sill into contact with the pavement. In addition, the right rear wheel rim made a gouging contact with the pave- ment. Maximum penetration of the struck car was 12 in., attended by a frame peak acceleration of 16 G, 20 ms after contact (Fig. 58). The 12 in. penetration (16 G frame peak) for Experiment 92 (Fig. 59) is twice the 6 in. penetration (11 G frame peak) for the companion Experiment 91. Super- ficially, one would expect the higher penetration to result in a lower frame acceleration. Three out of four of the two pairs of cars involved in the 40 mph intersection collisions (Experiments 91 and 92) were 1960 Chevrolets, each with a frame peak acceleration of 11 G; the fourth (struck car, Experiment 92) was a 1966 Chevrolet that registered a frame peak acceleration of 16 G . Triaxial accelerometers were consistently mounted on the rocker panel adjacent to the center doorpost. However, this placed them on sheet metal structure for the three "X" frame 1960 Chevrolets, and located them adjacent to the per- imeter frame for the 1966 Chevrolet. The force attenuating properties of sheet metal as contrasted with the force trans- mitting property of the perimeter frame account for the high frame reading associated with the 1966 Chevrolet. Similarly, seats anchored to sheet metal (for example, Ex- periment 89, right front passenger, 1966 Chevrolet struck car, with perimeter frame and seat attached to sheet metal within frame border) registered 11 G as contrasted to the same experimental plan for Experiment 88, except that the struck car was a 1960 Chevrolet with its "X" frame passing under the right front seat anchorage and the seat so anchored registered 17 G . Consequently, the transducer readings are valid and are representative of frame accelerations even though additional considerations are required for an under- standing of the results. The frame peak accelerations are indicated for this right angle impact in Fig. 60. Struck Car Occupants, Experiment 92 - The driver's GM bucket seat was displaced 11 of the 12 in. of intrusion. This action exposed the driver to the full impact force of the intruding vehicle because his seat did not provide lateral intrusion protection. His chest registered a reduced peak Fig. 57 - In intersection collision, a 40 mph 1960 Chevrolet is impacted at driver's door by a 40 mph 1960 Chevrolet (Experiment 92) Fig. 56 (b) - Striking 1960 LM Chevrolet underbody, showing permanent deformation (Experiment 91)</page><page sequence="30">1632 D. M. SEVERY, ET AL. acceleration of 12 G at 45 ms for this exposure because the lateral trace was lost. The driver's diagonal chest belt com- bination was anchored at the roof rail behind the center doorpost. It coursed downward and forward, across the side of his head and neck, and around his neck forward and down- ward diagonally across his chest. This driver dummy re- ceived a substantial laceration directly across his neck in a manner suggesting a serious injury -producing exposure. His lap belt registered 5701b at 105 ms. His head struck the side glass a 93 G blow at 40 ms. He appeared to submarine in his seat, ending up in the posture shown in Fig. 57. The right front passenger of the struck car riding in the safety seat flailed leftward as he loaded his harness. His left shoulder strap registered 2551b at 120 ms, and his right shoulder strap registered 265 lb at 130 ms. His LM seat was bent slightly to the left but his head did not strike the wing, intended as a protection from side impact, as did the head of the occupant beside the seat for Experiment 91. His chest Fig. 58 - Transducer patterns, 40 mph intersection collision (Experiment 92)</page><page sequence="31">COLLISION PERFORMANCE, LM SAFETY CAR 1633 registered a 12 G peak at 50 ms, significantly less than the 16 G frame deceleration registered beside his seat. This observation points out the force attentuation afforded the protective "inner shield" for the motorist in an integrated capsule seat, as contrasted with the passenger compartment Fig. 59 - In Experiment 92, side intrusion for this 1966 Chevrolet was twice the amount sustained by the 1960 Chevrolet in Experiment 91 Fig. 60 - Frame peak accelerometer values attained for Experiment 92 decelerations representative of the motorist "outer protec- tive shield." The right rear passenger was thrown to the left against the left rear passenger, striking his torso forcibly (chest, 51 G at 110 ms) before rebounding (Fig. 61). This 13-year- old was then thrown to the right rear where he rotated coun- terclockwise before returning to his own seated position, facing rearward, as though he were looking out the back window (Fig. 62). The chest of the left rear seat passenger of the struck car sustained 64 G at 40 ms; his head flailed leftward to strike the roof rail a critical blow, 151 G at 70 ms, owing to the height and sloping design of the roof rail behind the rear door window.

The driver was thrown violently to his right, crushing against the right front seat passenger and sustaining a second head blow of 36 G at 320 ms. The center front 13 -year -old passenger was thrown against the right windshield post and struck his head obliquely , buck- ling his neck as a result of the head impact and his torso inertia. He received a 34 G blow to his chest at 155 ms; his head did not have electronic instrumentation. The right front adult passenger was unrestrained, and was forced to his right against the door sustaining a 23 G chest acceleration at 105 ms, and striking his head against the side glass sustaining a 52 G blow at 125 ms. The door re- mained closed but the glass cracked from the shoulder im- pact distortion of the window sill. A Cox seat was installed for the left rear position and an LM capsule chair for the right rear position of the striking car (see Fig. 8(b)). With respect to this LM chair, the frame of the chair registered 15 G at 10 ms. The adult passenger sustained only a 9 G chest acceleration at 95 ms, typical of the excellent force attenuating performance of this LM cap- sule chair and restraint system. His left shoulder belt regis- tered 2401b at 85 ms; his right lap belt, 3301b at 100 ms, and his left lap belt 7601b at 100 ms. Motion picture film, Fig. 63 - Upper rim of steering wheel is deflected into driver's eyes (Experiment 92)</page><page sequence="33">COLLISION PERFORMANCE, LM SAFETY CAR 1635 coupled with transducer data, indicated that this passenger rode out the crash under noninjury -producing conditions. The left rear adult passenger, wearing a Cox diagonal - chest lap belt combination integral with the seat, appeared to be restrained as effectively as the double shoulder harness system performed, throughout the primary impact. How- ever, during the subsequent spin -out of the striking car, the shoulder strap dropped from his shoulder, partially across his chest and near his elbow (Fig. 64(a)), as contrasted to the harness remaining in place for the LM safety seat (Fig. 64(b)). He sustained a 14 G chest acceleration at 95 ms, 640ib lap belt load at 110 ms, and a 590-lb shoulder belt load at 115 ms. The advantage of the LM system is that, should there be a subsequent collision as this car is spun out to its position of rest, as for example, hitting a fixed object, the LM passenger would be in a position to sustain additional impact forces without injuries likely to occur. In contrast, the left rear passenger in the Cox seat, with a diagonal -chest belt, would have his upper torso and head thrown forward, striking the car interior at this point, owing to the diagonal strap dropping from his shoulder. Post -Collision Observations, Experiment 92 - The struck 1966 Chevrolet sustained penetration to 12 in. for the left doors, as contrasted to 6 in. for the 1960 Chevrolet, Experi- ment 91. The doorpost did not tear from the rocker panel. The left rear tire was flat as a result of a puncture by the fender metal. The gas tank anchor strap for the right side of the tank tore loose, dropping the tank to the pavement and causing rupture. The striking 1960 Chevrolet was compressed at its front 10 in.; the right front tire was flat from bumper penetration (Fig . 65); the right front side glass was broken from impact Fig. 64 (a) - Cox cross -chest strap slips from shoulder after impact (Experiment 92) by the right front passenger's shoulder, and the steering wheel was deformed from the driver being thrown against it. Collision Dynamics - These two intersection experiments (91 and 92) both involved Chevrolets impacting the center side, with all vehicles traveling 40mph at impact. They differed only in the type of cars; all cars were 1960 Chev- rolets except the struck car in Experiment 92, a 1966 Chev- rolet. With these similarities (frame type construction), it is not surprising that the collision dynamics for Experiment 91 (Fig. 66(a)) correspond closely to Experiment 92 (Fig. 66 (b)). When the design of the car is changed (semi -unit body construction) but other conditions are kept constant, Fig. 64 (b) - Passenger in LM harness, effectively restrained throughout collision (Experiment 92) Fig. 65 - Front-end damage sustained by 1960 Chevrolet in 40 mph side^impact collision (Experiment 92)</page><page sequence="34">1636 D. M. SEVERY, ET AL. Fig. 66 - Collision dynamics, center-side impact at 40 mph: A, 1960 LM Chevrolet striking a 1960 LM Chevrolet (Ex- periment 91); B, 1960 Chevrolet striking a 1966 Chevrolet (Experiment 92); C, 1960 Plymouth striking a 1960 Plymouth (Experiment 60) we find that the collision dynamics correspond rather closely to Fig. 66(c), where both vehicles remained in the locked -in condition longer owing to the greater penetration of the struck car. The reason for the bias in the pre -crash direc- tion of the struck vehicles, following contact between the cars for this accident configuration (center -side impact), relates to the effective resistance the struck car tires apply to the impacting car's force tending to side-slip the struck car. Contrariwise, the striking car wheels are not being forced sideways and it tends to track around to its left, locked into the side of the struck car until it breaks away and spins out. For this reason the struck car usually travels greater distances than the striking car after contact, except when lock-in time is increased, both vehicles tend to act as one and they approach similar spin -out patterns while expending their kinetic energies. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 1. The prototype for a safer car design built in 1960 may include concepts and devices that represent substantially im- proved motorist protection over conventional designs of that year; to be of interest to present-day car designers, such 1960 safety -customized vehicles must be collision evaluated with equivalent current production vehicles . This procedure accounts for the extent, if any, the safety innovations of yesteryear have been embodied within present-day produc- tion models. 2. The selection of rear-end and side -impact accident types provided a reasonably complete evaluation of the po- tential protective qualities of the LM car; in addition, the striking vehicle for these two -car collisions allowed oppor- tunity for evaluating exposures for front -end type impacts. 3. So serious are motorist collision injuries that all reasonable avenues of endeavor should be considered; one such approach has been the evolvement of safety or safer car type specifications. The static tests included in the Liberty Mutual report (4) provide reasonable validation for the important aspects of the safety specifications of the LM capsule seat. Generalized observations, such as "better door latches will reduce ejections," may not require quali- fications but specific performance criteria for safer cars should include the specific sources of evidence on which assertions are based. This approach fulfills the responsibility of engineers to establish the basis of credibility of design criteria instead of shifting the burden of proof or rejection to manufacturers who ultimately are expected to transpose a heterogeneous mixture of pure assumptions, partially pre- sumptuous data, and fully factual data into a roadworthy vehicle, enthusiastically acceptable to the motoring public and one that also is crashworthy under a multiplicity of collision exposures. 4. Laboratory simulations of contemplated exposures provide valuable assistance for refining concepts of the de- sign engineer; however, based on experience of researchers of this field, it has been established that many interrelated factors occurring during collision are not anticipated at the</page><page sequence="35">COLLISION PERFORMANCE, LM SAFETY CAR 1637 preliminary design level or observed during laboratory tests. In matters as vital as motor vehicle safety, the public in- terest is best represented by reserving publicity on the antic - ipated merits of vehicle safety devices or designs until such innovations have been validated through full-scale col- lision studies. 5. Automotive design engineers, engaged directly or indirectly with the automotive industry, who are intent on serving the public interest by reducing motorist collision injuries should prepare their specifications, with scientific documentation, indicating those areas where they are un- able to find or develop studies for reference and the basis, if any, for estimates they include in lieu of valid data. 6. Some safety devices are apparently so advantageous as to appear to need no evaluation before reaching a deci- sion on their use; experience has shown, however, that this position is erroneous, even with respect to the simplest of devices. To represent an improvement worthy of installa- tion, a safety innovation must not, while performing its function, simultaneously diminish the level of safety achieved by other design features, regardless of whether they are more or less important. 7. Interrelated safety factors (ISF)mustbe considered when making changes in vehicle design to avoid the mis- take of improving one factor while deteriorating another. Examples of ISF were presented in Ref. 3, and a typical find- ing of this nature arising out of this study is given by Con- clusion 11. 8. Although preliminary in nature, it appears that steer- ing columns that are not provided with energy absorption performance would be less dangerous if retractable rather than rigid. The telescoped (at the passenger compartment side of the firewall) column, allowed the knees, arms, chest, and head to receive a more distributed impact with the forward structure than is possible when the rigid column acts as a spear -like rearward thrusting, or, at best, rigid projection. 9. The rear-ended 1966 Chevrolet was substantially more collapsed than the rear-ended 1960 Chevrolet impacted under identical conditions; however, the frame peak ac- celeration for the more rigid 1960 Chevrolet was nearly 50 &lt;7o higher than the corresponding peak acceleration of the newer vehicle. Where increased collapse reduces collision ac- celeration without violating the integrity of the passenger compartment, reductions in collision injuries will occur. 10. Acceleration measurements for the passenger com- partment are influenced by the proximity of transducers to the position of impact and by the type of structure used for anchorage. Accordingly, for purposes of recording general acceleration values for the passenger compartment of the struck car in side impacts, the transducers are placed on the non -struck side of the passenger compartment; addi- tionally, significant differences in passenger compartment acceleration values were observed when transducers were frame mounted versus sheet metal anchored (rocker panel). Consideration of such potential variations is necessary when contrasting values that may be at variance because of the structure to which the transducers are attached as well as the independent variable under consideration. 11. Bumpers, as presently designed, are little more than parking guards and provide negligible resistance to vehicle impact, even when traveling at moderate speeds. However, the present grossly inadequate height of backrests common to most domestic vehicle seats presents a reason for not strengthening bumpers or, for that matter, seat backrests, until backrests are increased in height and strength to pro- vide full back and head support. 12. For intersection collisions involving the same weight cars impacting at the same speed, the struck car usually travels, after contact, greater distances than the striking car. An exception is that when lock-in time is prolonged both vehicles tend to act as one and expend their kinetic energy in similar spin-out patterns. The position -of -impact to position- of- rest direction is biased in the pre -crash direc- tion of the struck car owing to its more effective resistance to tire side-slip during the initial phases of collision. 13. The LM capsule chair resists collision intrusion (side- impact encroachment) by isolating the motorist from the direct blow of the striking car, and in addition moderates the passenger compartment forces reaching the motorist. 14. The LM capsule chair does not entirely protect the motorist from side glass impacts for heads flailed against the glass, a contact often facilitated by side glass being pushed inward from side impacts. This deficiency is re- garded as relatively minor, considering the exceptional overall protective qualities of the LM capsule chair. 15. Thinner, more flexible, side window glass that is not more readily fractured will reduce the impact injuries sustained from side window glass head blows. 16. The conventional car seat, unable to support its own weight during collision deceleration, cannot be used for attaching protective restraints; as a result of this deficiency, seat belts have to be extended to the floor, and shoulder belts to roofs, doorposts, rear seat, or floor points for an- chorages. These nonappealing, troublesome locations make their use by motorists less probable and provide compromises in protection for those determined to avail themselves of whatever protection is at hand. 17. Occupant transducer loads of these experiments sub- stantiated findings of earlier studies (1-3) that unrestrained rear seat passengers during collision not only become injured from being hurled about the car's interior, or ejected, but also cause injuries to others they dangerously impact during their forced involuntary movements. 18. The LM head -arresting net for rear seat passengers had excellent performance in preventing whiplash injuries, but the 1 in. webbing somewhat obscures vision through the rear window; a practical compromise may be represented by a lightweight netting that allows better viewability (thin nylon cord). 19. For motorists. whiplashed by a rear-end collision, the diminished head clearance for rear seat passengers above and to their rear presents a significant head impact hazard and wedge -like force. Higher rear seat backrest pads ex-</page><page sequence="36">1638 D. M. SEVERY, ET AL. tending onto the rear window shelf would reduce whiplash injuries, providing sufficient clearance exists for rearward rotation of the head without impact to the rear window header. 20. The seat anchored cross -shoulder belt is an effective upper torso restraint; however, during some collisions the strap may drop from the shoulder across the chest thereby depriving the motorist of this protection, should a subsequent impact occur. The LM double shoulder harness does not have this performance problem. 21. Side impacts produce significantly different belt loadings for the left and the right segments of the harness and of the lap belt units. Motorist-to-lap belt friction and body kinematics account for these differences. 22. Most of the lateral force applied to the driver was from his contact with the seat's padded armrest and shoulder wing with relatively little restraint for this direction achieved through the shoulder harness and lap belt. 23. The cross -neck, cross -chest lap belt combination restrains the head and upper torso from striking the steering wheel or other forward structure; however, application of forces and abrasive action across the neck appears to repre- sent a condition that may cause serious injury; additionally, the dummy motorist, restrained in this manner, submarined, and crushed deeper into the seat during collision because of the wedge -like action this belt applied as a result of its anchor point being located above the window level and be- hind the center doorpost. Based on this limited evaluation, this belt is not recommended for use by the public. 24. Design concepts for protection of motorists from colli- sion injuries are: a. Restrain the motorist, at least with a seat belt, and position him within a large passenger compartment, one in which the interior surfaces are sufficiently remote to assure the motorist does not strike them, even if only restrained at the hips. b. Restrain the motorist who is seated within a minimum free volume passenger compartment, portions of which have been hinged to swing aside for access and egress but having surfaces normally very close about the seated motorist, in- cluding a head support, but especially from his shoulder level downward. The interior surfaces adjacent to the motorists are contoured and provide energy absorbing properties that reduce the likelihood of injury for motorists crushed against them. c. A modified capsule or integrated seat for which the immediate proximity of the vehicle interior is of secondary importance owing to the rather excellent protection afforded the motorist within the protective confines of the integrated semi -enveloping chair. Concept a is restricted to large vehicles; concept b, while unquestionably effective, is inconvenient and congested; and concept c has neither of these objections and is readily adaptable to current vehicular designs. This was the concept pursued by the LM engineers because it provided a nominally nonpenetrable protective structure in the form of a seat en- veloping the motorist from the sides and rear, including a built- in full harness restraint for frontal collision forces. The head support was also structured to resist roof collapse. 25. The LM seat occupant of the rear-ended LM car showed no evidence of exposure to injury because of the protection derived from his contoured full back seat with head support; the pedestal base flexed at its juncture with the floor pan tilting the LM chair about 30 deg rearward, but the seated dummy maintained normal posture throughout the impact. 26. The conventional automotive seat corresponds approx- imately to a lightweight, padded living room slipper -chair; it has a readily compressible, bundled -wire substructure sup- port, attached to a lightweight tubular frame that is difficult to anchor effectively and that provides inadequate body sup- port in any direction. 27. The inadequate front seat anchorage strength and backrest strength tend to reduce the severity of whiplash from rear-end collisions. This condition does not represent a con- sistent or satisfactory or comprehensive solution to the rear- end collision injury problem because: low speed impacts do not provide sufficient force to break the anchorage or backrest, resulting in serious whiplash; high speed impacts may force the front seat passenger up the plane of the back- rest to whiplash him or break the seatback, releasing him to the rear seat area or even out the rear door, notwithstanding the use of a lap belt; neither of these extremes represent acceptable or satisfactory solutions to a serious and very frequently occurring type of accident. 28. Interoccupant impact injuries may occur when the front seatback yields excessively and allows the occupant to be flailed rearward to strike the rear seat passenger during rear-end collisions. 29. Backrest rebound of a rear-ended, front seat motorist may pitch him forcibly against the forward structure of the car interior; injuries from this situation can be prevented if seat or backrest yield is designed to respond plastically, rather than elastically. Good plastic deformation occurred in the floor pan attachment for the rear-ended LM capsule chair. 30. Tilt-forward backrest designs serving to accommodate rear passenger entry and exit provide serious impacts to the mid -back of front seat occupants; such action diminishes the restraint afforded rear seat passengers hurled forward against tilt backrests. 31. A rigid seat frame, designed along the lines of the LM capsule chair, while not capable of resisting the side impact intrusion forces at 40 mph, does provide a protective shield for the motorist that partially resists collision intru- sion and that otherwise becomes displaced sideways, carry- ing the encradled motorist with it away from the intruding vehicle. This concept is sound and merits serious considera- tion with respect to future designs. 32. A contoured bucket-type seat provides resistance to lateral forces; prior studies (3) as well as this study have es- tablished the value of well -padded but strong armrests and the value of backrest contouring (shoulder wings) as a pro- tection against lateral collision forces. 33. The LM capsule chair concept provides a nominally</page><page sequence="37">COLLISION PERFORMANCE, LM SAFETY CAR 1639 nondeformable structure that encircles the significant areas for motorist protection, providing a within -the -car protective shield for the motorist from excessive passenger compart- ment forces and distortions brought about by extreme outside collision action, 34. In addition to prevention of direct intrusion force from reaching the motorist, the LM capsule chair reduced the peak acceleration transmitted to the motorist to nearly one -third the amount sustained under the same conditions for a motorist with a full harness restraint but seated on a conventional seat. 35. The Cox safety seat embodies many of the advances in motorist protection afforded the LM capsule chair (for example, shoulder and lap retractable inertial reel units attached to a strong, firmly anchored, contoured seat frame, full backrest with head support) but does not provide as much lateral support or resistance from collision intrusion as does the LM chair. The diagonal chest strap of the Cox seat can slip from the shoulders but the LM harness remains correctly placed during and following collision. 36. Better padding is needed for the armrest and shoulder wings of the LM chair owing to the important role they play in side impacts and the high forces they apply to the motorist during such exposures. The shoulder wing top surface re- quires special attention to minimize injuries from heads flailed sideways onto that structure. 37. The time has long passed by when the need was clearly apparent and the design criteria adequately available for an integrated safer car seat to become a production item for the automobile, a car seat that provides an inner protective shield about the motorist, functioning in a manner similar to the outer protective shield afforded by the motorist compartment. 38. An integrated safety seat includes the following de- sign criteria: a. A tubular metal seat frame or unit body constructed seat that includes a full height backrest and head support (a 1967 series of UCLA rear-end collision experiments will provide seatback dimensions) capable of resisting permanent seat deformation not exceeding 2 in. for collision forces of 9000 lb in the forward direction, 7000 lb for the side impact direction, and 5000 lb for the rear-end direction; these seat design loads provide for a 100-lb integrated seat, and a 200- lb motorist harnessed to the integrated seat undergoing mod- erate speed collision exposures (approximately 30 mph). b. Cross -chest belt or double shoulder harnesses with up- per anchorage installed at shoulder level within the seatback and provided with an inertia snubbing, automatic retroacting device; similar devices and design will be applied to accom- modate the lap belt portion for the 3- or 4-point harness. c. A tubular seat frame that includes side structure for support of padded armrests and for resisting collision intrusion below the armrests to the base of the seat; shoulder-wing structure should also be provided that extends 5 in. forward of the backrest. d. Padding arranged for comfort and, to the extent possi- ble, for distributing collision forces applied to the motorist. e. An anchorage system for the seat that does not allow appreciable yield, one that collectively, with the seat yield, limits deflection to 6 in. for 9000-lb force in the forward direction operating through the combined motorist /seat cen- ter of mass, to 3 in. for 7000 lb applied laterally, and 4 in. for 5000 lb applied in the rearward direction. f. Fixed integral head supports capable of sustaining 2000 lb vertically downward as an assist for reducing roof collapse during rollovers. 39. The majority of vehicles operating, urban and rural, carry only a driver; where two occupants are present the pas- senger, for a majority of the vehicles, is sitting in the right front seat position. The front left and the front right seat positions are the most important in the car. For practical purposes, the remaining seats in the automobile could con- tinue to be of conventional design, with improved anchorages and equipped at least with lap belts. 40. The automobile seat is a restraining device. A poorly designed seat and seat anchorage system becomes an injury - producing agency during collision; contrariwise, a properly designed integrated seat system represents the most important safety feature that may be provided for the motorist. At the time of this writing (1967), the first integrated safety seat for a production car has yet to be produced, domestic or foreign.

Some of the physical testing techniques that the research engineers of the Institute of Transportation and Traffic Engineering of the University of California use have been followed by the people in the industry that are in the accident simulation field. I would like to expand upon several areas mentioned by the authors. A similar series of rear end impact tests have been conducted at the General Motors Proving Ground using car-to-car impacts and the SAE J972 Standard moving bar- rier as the bullet car. This series of tests were conducted at various speeds from 2. 6 mph to over 26 mph to evaluate a typical vehicle in terms of the acceleration pulse that it feels during this type of an impact. The impact into the rear end of the vehicle puts a force impulse into it. The occupants then respond to this pulse. Fig. A shows a series of faired curves that were gener- ated from some of the tests conducted at the Proving Ground. As the relative velocity of the impact increases, the accel- eration trace takes on a typical pattern. The initial peak rises and the time duration of the impact is extended. As the vehicle is subjected to a greater relative velocity im- pact, the secondary acceleration peak appears. By plotting the peak acceleration points versus the im- pact speed and the time duration as shown in Fig. B for these impacts, we begin to notice a pattern. At the lower veloc- ity impacts, most of the reaction between the vehicles is an elastic impact. As the impact speed approaches 7-1/2 mph, the plastic deformation of the impacted vehicle be- gins. The acceleration experienced then by the impacted vehicle increases at a much lower rate with the increase in relative speed because of this plastic deformation. By the establishment of these test parameters, it was then possible for us to reproduce these typical rear end impacts on the im- pact sled at the General Motors Proving Ground. Fig. C is a view of the General Motors Impact Sled with the vehicle oriented in a position to simulate a forward im- pact. Rear impacts are simulated by simply reversing the vehicle upon the sled.

D and E are portrayals of how this calibration is done statically. A force is applied through the center of gravity of the head and the head motion or angle of rotation is related to degrees aft of the torso line. Notice the two levels placed upon the dummy to measure their angle. Complicated mechanisms, manufactured by the Alderson Research Labs., Inc., as shown in Fig. F, are available to simulate a human neck. These necks enable us to more closely simulate the action of a human neck during rear im- pact. One of the more difficult tasks during studies of human simulation is the calibration of our test equipment. These calibration curves (Fig. G) of various dummy necks that have been used show the variation that is possible using dif- ferent necks or different settings on a particular neck. Our studies indicate that voluntary motion in hyperexten- Fig. D - Anthropomorphic dummy used for whiplash studies Fig. E - Closer view of Fig. D showing calibration for neck motion Fig. F - Mechanism simulating human neck Fig. G - Calibration curves of various dummy necks Fig. H - Dummy seated on production seat on impact sled</page><page sequence="42">1644 D. M. SEVERY, ET AL. Sion can extend past 60 deg aft of the torso line. With some head rotation, either to the right or left, the limitations of voluntary motion may reduce this limit to around 45 deg. On this basis, our dummies are calibrated to begin a linear stiffness at a greater rate at approximately 30 deg as shown by the lower curve on this figure. Fig. H is a view of a dummy seated on a production seat on the impact sled. You will note the bar attached to the dummy chest which is used as a reference plane parallel to his torso line. Fig. I is a view of this dummy after being subjected to a simulated rear impact. These before and after shots do not really reveal what happens in between. Fig. J, taken during the peak excursion of the dummy, shows what the action of the dummy was during this rather high g level acceleration pulse. Let's study some of the parameters of "whiplash" during a series of tests which we conducted that very closely dupli- cate the acceleration levels described in the UCLA paper. The sequence of Figs. K-N are of a 95th percentile dum- my subjected to two variables: 1. Restrained or unrestrained. 2. Headrest up and down. The first, Fig. K, portrays the dummy motion during the peak head extension of a 95th percentile dummy on a pro- Fig. I - View of dummy after simulated rear impact Fig. J - Peak excursion of dummy shown in Figs.

The dynamic motion of the dummy is now restricted somewhat and, as I will explain later, the head rotation angle is increased. Fig. M is a repeat of the same test series with the head- rest now extended and the dummy again unrestrained. Note more closely confine the torso and the head rotates over the top of the headrest ass With the headrest up and adding a lap belt restraint, we more closely confine the torso and head rotates over the top of the headrest as shown in Fig. N. At first appraisal, this data boils down to a "scattergram" Fig. O.

Fig. P shows that the use of a lap belt restraint tends to increase the rearward head rotation angle aft of the torso line with the same seat back height.

You will note that the lines pass through the abscissa . This indicates that the opposite or flexion of the neck can occur if a headrest is too high for the occupant. I would like to point out that in none of these tests portrayed did we even approach the limits of voluntary head motion. Occupant injury during any impact cannot be evaluated by one parameter alone. The investigator must consider all applicable parameters. He must look at the load applied and its duration. He must also analyze the distribution of force or the area of contact. Another parameter to be con- sidered is the rate of onset or jerk. In the case of head "whiplash," ihis parameter could be the rate of change of angular acceleration the head experiences during its excur- sion. Head injury has been shown to be related to these para- meters by the curve shown in Fig. R. This curve was de- rived by a series of tests conducted on cadaver skulls at the Wayne State University. Data for this curve were obtained from head impacts on a flat unyielding surface. By application of a mathematical formula, fl2 (1) = / aadt where: a = Acceleration t^ = Beginning of pulse t = End of pulse ¿â n = Arbitrary exponent a number or severity index can be computed for head injury. This concept developed by GM is related to the previously shown graph. This mathematical formula is essentially a means of relating the peak acceleration on a higher empha- sis along with the time duration that the force impulse is applied.

When "n" is equal to approxi- mately 2. 5, the slope of the line closely approximates the previously shown impact tolerance curve. When this criterion of severity index was applied to the rear impact data that were obtained during the UCLA test, none of the values calculated approached any level which Table A - 1967 GM Safety Features Energy Instrument panel and padding Absorption steering wheel and steering column Minimizing Improved instrument panel control Injury knobs and gearshift lever and knobs Potential Soft vinyl sun visor hooks, coat hooks, and low profile window regulator knobs Inside rearview morror with vinyl clad breakaway base and vinyl edge bezel Structural Safety door latches and hinges Improvements Passenger -guard door locks Stronger seat structure and anchorage Stronger fuel tank retention Folding seat back latches Operational Four -way hazard warning flasher Features Dual master cylinder brakes with warn- ing light Larger tires for single inflation pressure Push-button seat belt buckles with front retractors Day -night mirror Lane change feature in direction signal controls may be considered injurious to life. The values calculated from the UCLA data were approximately 18. We have made several surveys of the available data try- ing to evaluate the various criteria for "whiplash" injuries. We have found no significant statistics other than an indica- tion that the right front seated occupant is more susceptible to this type of injury. It is interesting to make a comparison of the Liberty Mu- tual car features with those that are now available in the 1967 Chevrolet (Table A). Fuel tank retention and location and construction have been discussed at great lengths. At the General Motors Proving Ground, during our full scale im- pact tests, which we conduct with the fuel tank filled with gasoline and the engine running and all electrical systems on, we have had only one fire occurrence. This resulted from a very severe impact. This fire, however, was con- fined to the carburetor air cleaner and did not proceed any further. Our experimental data are substantiated by ACIR data to the effect that vehicle fires, as a result of impact, are of very low incident. In fact, vehicle fires presently occur in less than 1/2 of 1% of all vehicle accidents re- ported and a good share of the fires are electrical in nature. The Liberty Mutual Safety Car II was basically a 1960 Chevrolet sedan. The door latches in the 1966 Chevrolet used in this test series had a greatly improved door latch mechanism, approximately two times stronger in push-out strength than the 1960 model. The interlock or longitudinal strength of this new latch is about 22-1/2 times stronger than the 1960 version. This accounts for the greatly increased performance of the door latch assemblies during side impacts as verified by the UCLA side impact test series. The laws of physics are irrevocable. The basic formula, 2 V = 2 gh, as it applies to velocity and acceleration, can be thought of in terms of jumping from the top of a tall build- ing. A free-fall from a building 107 ft tall will end in a ground velocity at impact of 56. 5 mphj this is the vectorial sum of two elastic colliding bodies each traveling at 40 mph at 90 Fig. T - Dummies used during impact test series (authors' ex- periment 88)</page><page sequence="45">COLLISION PERFORMANCE, LM SAFETY CAR 1647 Fig. U - Dummy used during side impact col- lision (authors* experiment 92) deg to each other upon impact. To continue this discussion a bit further, surveys of free-falls into fire nets during emer- gency situations indicate that very few rescues have been suc- cessful in height of falls over 70 ft. If one wanted to really be brave and consider that the mattress used to absorb his free-fall was 100% efficient and that it would resist him with a square-wave impulse of 47 g, it would only have to be 2 feet, 3 inches thick. Forty -seven g was used in this calcu- lation because this is the peak acceleration that was experi- enced by Colonel Stapp's sled during his famous test at Holloman Air Force Base. Obviously, the construction of an automobile cannot be 100% efficient in energy absorp- tion, whether it be hard on the outside and soft on the in- side, or hard on the inside and soft on the outside, or any combination of these factors. The best that the automotive designer can design for the occupants in the presence of these conditions is protection against localized penetration by the striking vehicle and presentation of contact area for the occupant. I would like to ask the authors several questions. The first is about the dummies that were used during the impact test series (Fig. T). How realistically were their necks cal- ibrated to simulate human response during rear impacts? The second question relates to the driver dummy that was used during the side impact collision test. As you will note in Fig. U, his elbow was nearly touching the front seat cushion. The dimensions of this dummy indicate that his torso length approximates that of the first percentile male driver. This creates a rather adverse appearing shoulder harness belt attitude when the seat is placed in the full rear position. My question is, how realistic was this driver simu- lation? AUTHORS' CLOSURE TO DISCUSSION cidents (usually rear end). An effort is made to limit the posture of the body in a rear end collision. As for the second and third questions, dummies are com- promises. The torso was shortened (represents first percen- tile male driver) on the dummy used for the side impact collision in an effort to get the dummy to slouch. Neck in- juries are likely to occur when using a shoulder harness. Some improvement was obtained when the roof anchor point was lowered. We feel there is still room for improvement in the selection of shoulder harness anchor points. We have an excellent calibration system, to crank what- ever resistive forces are desired into the necks of the dum- mies. A human being usually exerts just a little more than alg force to hold his neck in a neutral position. When a car occupant is forewarned of an impending crash, his stiffen- ed neck muscles can resist greater accelerations before the head is whiplashed uncontrollably in any direction. In the UCLA tests, neck structures of the dummies were adjusted to simulate an unwarned crash victim. We also have some comments to make on severe rear end collisions (40-50 mph) which result in fire. Although re- ports indicate that less than 1% of today's accidents result in fire, we are quite concerned over the oftentimes tragic cremations that do result. We feel that gas tank location and structure, among others, are particularly important fac- ets, and industry is already working on improvements. Car occupants must be able to get out quickly. We use a tow system to bring test cars into the accident situation because we cannot afford a fire in which they might lose their equipment. We agree it is a better idea to have the engines running, as in the GM tests. ORAL DISCUSSION IN ANSWER TO Mr. Cichowski's first question, we are not primarily concerned with direct head impact in whiplash ac- Q. We at Firestone would like to know if a range of sizes would be required with the LM encapsuled seat? What degree of inconvenience is experienced in every day ordinary use of a car?</page><page sequence="46">1648 D. M- SEVERY, ET AL. Mr. Brink: Entry is somewhat difficult with a 10 in. wing. A proposal has been made to reduce this to 5 in. It might be possible to make part of the seat integral with the door . Actual - ly, there is considerable latitude of movement for the occu- pant. The seat could rotate. However, it isn't easy to de- sign a seat which will be totally comfortable for the various sized people expected to use same. Q. In accident situations, what is the effect of car weight differentials (that is, Cadillac versus Volkswagen)? Mr. Severy: Deceleration rates were comparable when the Ford Motor Co. crashed a Falcon, a Mercury, and a Continental into a barrier at like speeds. Obviously in "two car" accidents the heavier car has the advantage. Mr. McCockney, Buick Motor Div., GMC - Regarding the effect of a six year age differential (1960 Chevrolet ver- sus 1966 Chevrolet), we question your confidence in the use of one accelerometer. Could you clarify the curve describ- ing the velocities of the struck and striking vehicle (rear end collision)? Mr. Severy: Aging (rust) would normally have an effect, but the 1960 vehicle was not rusted as it had been a show- room vehicle all this time. The variance in crushability of the 1960 versus the 1966 Chevrolet illustrated the difference in their structures. The greater deformation of the 1966 vehicle is advantageous, provided the passenger compart- ment is not infringed upon. Concerning the rear end collision, it took 100 ms before both cars attained the same velocity. Unless locked togeth- er, the cars usually part within 600 ms. The struck car usu- ally moves away about 2 mph faster than the striking car. By no means do we depend on one transducer to measure deceleration. Usually they are clustered in sets of three at various locations on the car. As many as 70 transducers are employed in a single test. The paper itself explains how data of this type (which appeared doubtful) were cross checked and confirmed or eliminated. Q. What effect would shoulder harnesses have on for- ward direction whiplash? Mr. Cichowski: Whiplash injuries are not well defined. The chin would bottom out on the chest at a neck angle of approximately 45 deg. The threshold of neck injuries has not been defined. Mr. Severy: The chin provides a limit of motion in the forward direction. Whiplash injuries can also be sustained in a sideward direction. Mr. Margolin, International Harvester Co. : Would not high "G" accelerations result when the Liberty Mutual chair moved the occupant sideward in a side type collision? Per- haps the human is crushable and this would result in a broken shoulder (as an example) rather than killing him. Mr. Brink: There is a significant improvement (reduction) in "G" forces imposed upon the seat occupant when he is moved away from the direct impact area. Mr. Severy: The human body is not a good energy ab- sorber. Many injuries are not reversible; for example, a cracked kneecap could result in a crippled walk, etc. Thus, it is essential to minimize use of the body as an energy ab- sorber. Forces should be transmitted to the hips or shoulders, through belts because these are the strongest parts of the body.</page></plain_text>
