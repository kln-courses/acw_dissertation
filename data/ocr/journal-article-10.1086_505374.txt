         <title>1. <italic>Falsafa</italic> on Trial</title>
         <p>Philosophy found itself before the Law from the moment it encountered Islam.1 It was the price the classical practice paid for its survival beyond the confines of the Hellenistic world. Translated from Greek into Arabic in the wake of the foundation of Baghdad by the ʿAbbāsid dynasty in 762,2 the works of physics, metaphysics, logic, ethics, and political thought that constituted the classical tradition of demonstrative science were saved from the oblivion into which they otherwise might have fallen in being submitted to an unprecedented demand, which would alter them forever: philosophy was called upon to give reasons for itself in the face of the authority of the Qurʾān and the teaching of its prophet. To retain itself in translation, the classical discipline could not avoid this singular challenge, which at once threatened it with extinction and promised it the possibility of a new life. Philosophy, it has often been observed, then found itself in unexpected conditions.3 One may compare them to those of Christian Europe, where the classical practice of reasoning was also forced to accommodate itself to the principles of a new religion, as the teachings of the ancients were confronted with the creed elaborated by the fathers of the Church. Doctrine, in the Christian tradition, proved the domain in which the differences between the two were reconciled; pagan science and Church dogma were to be united, with varying success, in philosophical theology. The situation could not be the same in Islam, for the religion announced by Muḥammad, in contrast to Christianity, had at its center neither faith nor dogma but an element at once theological and political: the Law (<italic>šarīʿa</italic>), the single revealed body of prescriptions and prohibitions understood by the Islamic tradition to be simultaneously civil and religious, temporal and spiritual.4 Before the rule of such a Law and the order of a divine figure consequently conceived above all in the form of a Law‐giver (<italic>šārʿ</italic>), the defense of <italic>falsafa</italic>, as philosophy was then called, could not be purely doctrinal, as it was in the Christian West; it could not take the form of a concordance of secular teaching and sacred dogma. Within the legal order instituted by Muḥammad, which was at once political, social, and theological, the vindication of philosophy could only be juridical. If it was to acquire an Arabic afterlife, philosophy had to justify itself before not “sacred doctrine” (<italic>doctrina sacra</italic>), as in Christianity, but “jurisprudence” (<italic>fiqh</italic>).5 The new adepts of the ancient practice of reflection were obliged, in this way, to leave the domain of their art to secure the conditions of its existence: the <italic>falāsifa</italic>, as the Arabic successors of the Greek philosophers were called, were forced to become, in time, <italic>qawāḍin</italic> and <italic>fuqahāʾ</italic>, judges and doctors of the Law.</p>
         <p>The challenge raised by Islam to philosophy was perhaps never as fully and as forcefully expressed as in the work of one of the greatest of the classical <italic>falāsifa</italic>, Abū al‐Walīd Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad bin Rushd, known through the medieval Latin transcription “Abenrosdin” as Averroës in the West. Averroës, who was born in Cordoba in 1126 (<sc>ah</sc> 520) and died in Marrakesh in 1198 (<sc>ah</sc> 595), was without doubt one of the most influential and best known of the Arabic writers in the Christian West; he was for Dante “the one who made the great commentary” (<italic>che’l gran comento feo</italic>),6 for Thomas Aquinas and Albert the Great the “Commentator” of Aristotle par excellence, and he was the source of the philosophic current that so profoundly determined the history of thought in Europe from the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries and that bears his name, “Averroism.”7 In the Arabic tradition, however, the Andalusian's position was not only, as it was in Christian Europe, philosophical, scientific, and medical. It was also—and, at least originally, above all—legal. It is significant that one of Averroës's first biographers, ibn al‐ʿAbbār (1199–1260 / 595–658), presents his subject as primarily a jurist.8 The son and grandson of noted magistrates (<italic>qawāḍin</italic>), Averroës was himself a judge and a jurist, and in the course of his prominent career in the sciences of the law he came in close contact with the political and religious authorities of his day. In 1153, the ruler of the Almohad dynasty, which controlled the Islamic territories of Spain and North Africa, ʿAbd al‐Muʾmīn, called Averroës to Marrakesh and entrusted him with the task of overseeing the construction and institution of schools throughout the realm. Approximately sixteen years later, Averroës was appointed to the position of the principal magistrate (<italic>qāḍi</italic>) of Seville. In 1182, he assumed the same function in Cordoba, becoming also the primary personal physician of ʿAbd al‐Muʾmīn's successor, Abū Yaʿqūb. In 1184 (<sc>ah</sc> 580), he was exiled by Abū Yaʿqūb's son and successor, for reasons unknown today; but he returned to the court of Marrakesh again two years before his death in 1198.</p>
         <p>The <italic>corpus averroisticum</italic> is both vast and varied, but one may distinguish within it three sets of works. There are the many philosophical, scientific, and medical texts for which he was known for centuries in Europe, which took the form of commentaries on classical authorities and, less frequently, autonomous treatises. There are, furthermore, the significant contributions to the study of Islamic law and jurisprudence, such as the monumental <italic>Inception for the Interpreter and Conclusion for the Mediator</italic> (<italic>Bidāyat al‐</italic>
            <italic>mujtahid wa nihāyat al‐muqtaṣid</italic>), written in the final period of Averroës's literary production, at the same time as the great commentaries on Aristotle's <italic>Physics</italic>, <italic>De anima</italic>, and <italic>Metaphysics</italic>.9 Finally, Averroës was the author of a type of work that lies at the crossroads of Islamic jurisprudence and classical demonstrative science. To this third genre belongs a trilogy of works composed between 1169 and 1182, at whose center stands the tract in which the Islamic challenge to philosophy finds what may be its most concentrated formulation and its greatest reply: the so‐called <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>, or <italic>Kitāb faṣl al‐maqāl wa taqrīr mā bayn aš‐šarīʿa waʾ l‐ḥikma min al‐ittiṣāl</italic>, literally, <italic>The Book of the Decisive Treatise, Determining the Relation between the Law and Wisdom</italic>.10</p>
         <p>Averroës composed this treatise in the wake of a series of political, religious, institutional, and intellectual developments in the North Africa and Spain of his age. In the years of his youth, the Almoravid dynasty founded by ʿAbd Allāh bin Yāsīn in the middle of the eleventh century collapsed, prey to the combined forces of internal dissension and Muḥammad Ibn Tūmart, the North African radical whose forces ultimately conquered the Almoravid realm and established the Almohad dynasty in its place.11 Ibn Tūmart was not only a successful military figure but also a religious reformer, and his program, at its origins, was as doctrinal as it was political. Born in North Africa in the second half of the eleventh century (c. 1078–1098, <sc>ah</sc> 471–491), Ibn Tūmart began his studies in Cordoba but soon left the territory of the Almoravids, traveling to the Arabic East, where he was trained in the Islamic speculative theology (<italic>kalām</italic>) of which the Ashʿarite thinker al‐Ghazālī had been the greatest representative. The movement founded by Ibn Tūmart was to be deeply marked by this theological training. In the name of a radical commitment to the Islamic principle of divine unity (<italic>tawḥīd</italic>, from which the terms <italic>al‐muwaḥḥid</italic> and <italic>Almohad</italic> are derived), Ibn Tūmart's followers rejected both the scriptural hermeneutics and the legal method of the Almoravids. The first, they argued, led inevitably to the sin of anthropomorphism (<italic>tasjīm</italic>) in theology; the second, they maintained, resulted in an excessive reliance on the force of opinion (<italic>rāʾī</italic>) and estimation (<underline>
               <italic>z</italic>
            </underline>
            <italic>ann</italic>) in jurisprudence. Where the Almoravids had been literalists in interpretation, the Almohads thus advocated speculative reading (<italic>taʾwīl</italic>), and where the Almoravids had been casuists in jurisprudence, relying principally on the force of tradition (<italic>taqlīd</italic>) as it was transmitted to them in the guides to legal application (<italic>fūrūʿ</italic>), the Almohads instead preached a return to the sole roots of jurisprudence (<italic>uṣūl al‐fiqh</italic>): the Qurʾān, the accounts of the deeds of Mohammed (<italic>ḥadīth</italic>), Muslim tradition (<italic>sunna</italic>), and legal consensus (<italic>ijmaʿ</italic>).12</p>
         <p>Encouraging speculation in dogmatic theology and a renewed rigor in legal study, the religious and political movement founded by Ibn Tūmart held promise for philosophical activity. Averroës praises it as such at the close of the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>, crediting the Almohad rule with having “removed many evils, ignorant occurrences, and misguided paths,” awakening reflection on the very sources of the law (<italic>uṣūl aš‐šarīʿa</italic>) (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 26; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 33).13 At the same time, however, the Almohad rule posed a new threat to the practices of demonstration inspired by the works of the ancients. It is significant that the spiritual teacher of Ibn Tūmart, al‐Ghazālī, was not only the greatest master of Islamic speculative theology but also the most forceful prosecutor of philosophy in the tradition. Less than a century before Averroës, al‐Ghazālī had denounced the pagan science and its Arabic following in two works that showed a thorough knowledge of the discipline they aimed to destroy. The first, <italic>The Incoherence of the Philosophers</italic> (<italic>Tahāfut al‐falāsifa</italic>), completed in 1095, sought to demonstrate that the doctrines of the philosophers were both unsound in their arguments and heretical in their conclusions. The second, <italic>The Book of the Decisive Distinction between Islam and Heresy</italic> (<italic>Kitāb fayṣal at‐tafriqa bayn al‐islām wa l‐zandaqa</italic>), written between 1096 and 1106, constituted a juridical condemnation of the allegorical method employed by the philosophers in their interpretation of scripture, which allowed the theologian to repeat and to consolidate his judgment of the <italic>falāsifa</italic> as unbelievers (<italic>kafirūn</italic>) at odds with the principles of Islam. Averroës replied to al‐Ghazālī's first condemnation of philosophy in a work that, starting with its title, stood the theologian's polemic on its head: <italic>The Incoherence of “The Incoherence”</italic> (<italic>Tahāfut at‐tahāfut</italic>), known to the late European Middle Ages through a fourteenth‐century translation by the Jewish scholar Calo Calonymos as the <italic>Destructio destructionum</italic>. Here Averroës responded, point by point, to al‐Ghazālī's summary of the doctrines of the philosophers, seeking to demonstrate that the account of their “confusion” was itself fundamentally confused. At the same time, Averroës formulated a juridical answer to the specifically legal challenge of “unbelief” (<italic>kufr</italic>) raised by al‐Ghazālī against the philosophers in his <italic>Book of the Decisive Distinction.</italic> This answer coincides, to a large degree, with the argument of Averroës's <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>.</p>
         <p>Situated at the intersection of philosophical activity and legal reasoning, Averroës's book on the “relation between the Law and wisdom” responds directly in its form to the specific position of classical demonstrative science in Islam; the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> constitutes an examination of philosophy in the terms of the Law. It is hardly surprising, for this reason, that the work remained without any direct influence on the thought of the Christian Middle Ages and, unlike so many other writings by the Andalusian thinker, never passed in its entirety from Arabic into Latin.14 The treatise, however, found a public among medieval Jewish thinkers. The four existing manuscripts of the medieval Hebrew version of the text bear witness to the affinity of that other religion of the Law, Judaism, to the theologico‐political problem addressed by the Muslim work.15 As long as there were Jewish thinkers inspired by the Greek tradition of demonstrative reasoning, they found themselves obliged, like their Islamic counterparts, to provide a justification of their activity before the Law; and just as the Muslim <italic>falāsifa</italic> searched for a defense of their art in the terms of Muslim jurisprudence (<italic>fiqh</italic>), so the <italic>filosofim</italic> of medieval Jewry sought to give reasons for pagan science before the rule of the Jewish doctrine of the Law (<italic>talmud</italic>).16 A gulf, however, separates both religious traditions from that of the Christian West. There, the schoolmen were engaged in the attempt to justify the study of philosophy by demonstrating its relation, not to law, but to faith. It was this attempt that ultimately gave rise to the famous principle that has been called “Averroistic” since its public condemnation as heretical by the Bishop of Paris, Étienne Templer, in 1277, but that in fact has close to nothing to do with the thought of the Andalusian philosopher himself: the so‐called doctrine of double truth, according to which “many things are true according to faith that are nevertheless false according to philosophy” (<italic>multa esse vera secundam fidem, quae tamem falsa sunt secundam philosophiam</italic>).17</p>
         <p>The <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>, for all these reasons, is not a work on the conflict, concordance, or unity of faith and reason; nor is it an elucidation of the relation between the doctrines imposed by one and those dictated by the other. It is, instead, a juridical tract of a specific type: a <italic>fatwā</italic>, a legal <italic>responsum</italic> that seeks to determine the precise status of philosophy before the Law.18 The opening terms of the treatise are in this regard crucial. Here Averroës speaks as a “jurist, imam, and judge” to consider a matter solely “from the perspective of the Law”: <disp-quote>
               <p>The jurist, imam, judge, and uniquely learned Abū al‐Walīd Muḥammad ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd (may God be pleased with him) said: Praise be to God with all praises, and a prayer for Muḥammad, His chosen servant and messenger. Now, the goal of this speech is for us to investigate, from the perspective of the Law, whether reflection upon philosophy and the sciences of logic is permitted, prohibited, or commanded—and this as a recommendation or as an obligation—by the Law [<italic>faʾinna l‐gharaḍ min ha</italic>

            </disp-quote> As presented in these opening sentences, the inquiry that animates the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> is at once novel in ambition and classical in form. On the one hand, it is unique in the work of Averroës and in the Arabic tradition in its project to define, “from the perspective of the Law,” the nature of the “connection between wisdom and the Law.” At the same time, the <italic>Treatise</italic> remains, in the procedure of its argument, a legal examination that follows the form of the <italic>fatwā</italic>. Its aim (<italic>gharaḍ</italic>) is to produce a judgment that will determine the legal status of the object in question, the study of philosophy and the sciences of logic, by subsuming it under one of the five legal categories with which any act, according to Islamic jurisprudence, may be identified: the obligatory (<italic>wājib</italic>), the recommended (<italic>mandūb</italic>), the permitted (<italic>mubāḥ</italic>), the reprehensible (<italic>makrūh</italic>), and the forbidden (<italic>ḥarām</italic>).19 Carried out according to the protocols of the juridical examination, the judgment announced at the opening of the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> promises to settle, in this way, the vexed question of the legal status of philosophy. For such a judgment alone, resting on an identification of the specific juridical qualification of philosophy, can “decisively” determine the “relation between wisdom and the Law.” And such a judgment alone may trace the divergences between the two practices, defining the points at which philosophy, summoned before the Law, escapes from the court that would take it into its custody, eluding judgment in the very moment in which it is most forcefully subjected to it.</p>

         <title>2. The Decision, or “Interpretation” (<italic>Ta</italic>ʾ<italic>wīl</italic>)</title>
         <p>After the introductory formulation of the goal toward which it is directed, the argument of the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> begins with a definition of philosophy and a summary appraisal of the positions that it could be said to occupy in the terms of Islamic Law. Averroës marks the opening of his “discourse” (<italic>qawl</italic>) proper with an emphatic <italic>incipit</italic>, “So we say” (<italic>fa‐naqūl</italic>): <disp-quote>
               <p>So we say: since the activity of philosophy is nothing other than reflection upon beings and consideration of them insofar as they are an indication of the Artisan—I mean insofar as they are artifacts, for beings indicate the Artisan only through the cognizance of art in them, and the more complete cognizance of the art in them is, the more complete is cognizance of the Artisan—and since the Law has recommended and urged consideration of existing things, then it is evident that what this name indicates is either obligatory or recommended by the Law. [<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 1; <italic>BDT</italic>, pp. 1–2; trans. mod.]</p>
            </disp-quote> The <italic>Treatise</italic> offers neither a demonstration nor an explanation of its opening definition of the “activity of philosophy” as “nothing other than reflection upon beings and consideration of them insofar as they are an indication of the Artisan.” <italic>Stricto sensu</italic>, the proposition does not belong to the theses discussed by the work. It constitutes, instead, the minor premise on which the argument of the entire discourse is founded, forming the first member of a three‐part syllogism of which Averroës will make use in his legal inquiry. The chain of deduction can be easily summarized: philosophy is nothing other than the contemplation of beings insofar as they indicate their maker, namely, God; the Law enjoins humankind to reflect upon the universe and, in this way, to apprehend God; philosophy, therefore, cannot but be commended (<italic>ma</italic>ʾ<italic>amūr</italic>) by the Law, either as “recommended” (<italic>mandūb</italic>) or as “obligatory” (<italic>wājib</italic>).20</p>
         <p>As the major element in the chain of inference, the second proposition must be demonstrated if the syllogism is to hold, and Averroës proceeds to adduce the proof he requires. Drawing on the primary source of the Law, he cites five Qurʾānic passages (<italic>nuṣūṣ</italic>), among “innumerable verses,” that illustrate the divine command to “reflect upon beings”: the injunction, “Consider, you who have sight” (Qurʾān 59:2), which he reads as calling for the use of both the legal and demonstrative modes of reasoning (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 2; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 1); the question, “Have they not reflected upon the kingdoms of the heaven and the earth and what things God has created?” (Qurʾān 7:85), which he interprets as urging the “contemplation of the totality of beings” (Qurʾān 7:85); and the verses, “And in this way We made Abraham see the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth” (Qurʾān 6:75), “Do they not reflect upon the camels, how they have been created, and upon the heaven, how it has been raised up?” (Qurʾān 88:17), and “And they ponder the creation of the heavens and the earth” (Qurʾān 3:191), which the philosopher‐jurist likewise understands as commanding the activity of “reflecting upon beings and consideration of them insofar as they are an indication of the Artisan.” These authoritative citations allow Averroës to decide between the two categories of recommended acts to which he had previously restricted himself. The exercise of consideration, he now concludes, must be said to be nothing short of obligatory. Explaining that consideration is nothing more than “inferring the unknown from the known” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 2; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 2) and that such inference (<italic>istinbāṭ</italic>) is nothing other than the syllogism or syllogistic reasoning (<italic>al‐qiyās</italic> ʾ<italic>au bi l‐qiyās</italic>), Averroës restates and refines the legal decision, specifying the identity of the object to be “determined.” In its exhortations to “consider,” it is the use of reflection by means of the syllogism that the Qurʾān commands and, more precisely, “the most complete kind of reflection [<italic>an‐na</italic>
            <underline>
               <italic>z</italic>
            </underline>
            <italic>ar</italic>] by means of the most complete kind of syllogistic reasoning,” namely, “demonstration” (<italic>al‐burhān</italic>) (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 2; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 3).</p>
         <p>The interpretation of the Qurʾān's injunctions to consider leads, in only a few steps, to a decisive vindication of the syllogistic modes of reasoning of the ancients. If the Law demands the cultivation of consideration in the full sense of the term, Averroës argues, it must simultaneously require the study of classical syllogistic logic. The mastery of the tools of consideration can only be achieved through training in all the principal fields of logical reasoning. From the claim that the legally obligatory “cognizance [<italic>maʿarifa</italic>] of God and of all the things existing through Him” requires the cultivation of the science of demonstration, there thus follows a series of legal injunctions bearing on the arts of language and reasoning. Knowledge by means of demonstration (<italic>bi l‐burhān</italic>) can be achieved only through the study of the typology of arguments (“the kinds of demonstrations, their conditions, and in what way demonstrative syllogistic reasoning differs from dialectical, rhetorical and sophistical syllogistic reasoning” [<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 2; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 3]). Such a typology rests, in turn, on the study of the nature of syllogistic reasoning (“what unqualified syllogistic reasoning is, how many kinds of it there are, and which of them is syllogistic reasoning and which not”). And this study, finally, presupposes the knowledge of “the parts of which syllogistic reasoning is composed, that is, premises and their kinds” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 2; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 3; trans. mod.). The conclusion cannot be avoided: syllogistic logic reveals itself to be nothing short of mandatory in the terms of the Law. Drawing a comparison of which he will make recurrent use in the <italic>Treatise</italic>, Averroës invokes the status of the legal syllogism (<italic>al‐qiyās aš‐šarīʿī</italic>) employed in Islamic jurisprudence. Just as the jurist must learn the types of juridical reasoning, both syllogistic and nonsyllogistic, if he is truly to follow “the command to obtain juridical understanding of the [legal] statutes” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 3; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 3), so the one who is cognizant (<italic>al‐ʿārif</italic>) must acquire a thorough knowledge of “intellectual syllogistic reasoning and its kinds” if he is to respond fully to the divine injunction to “consider,” “reflect upon,” and “ponder” created beings.21</p>
         <p>Insisting on the necessity of the arts of logic for the execution of the Law, the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> simultaneously argues for the importance of the conservation and continuation of the classical tradition of demonstrative science as a whole. Averroës makes clear that training in syllogistic reasoning implies the study of its past masters. It leads, like education in all the arts, beyond the minds of individuals and beyond the borders of their age. The parallel with juridical training again proves instrumental. In the acquisition of knowledge about the intellectual syllogism, Averroës writes, “it is difficult or impossible for one person to grasp all that he needs of this by himself and from the beginning, even as it is difficult for one person to infer all he needs to be cognizant of concerning the kinds of juridical reasoning” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 3; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 4). Learning cannot but have been “perfected over a long period of time” (<italic>PTA</italic>, pp. 4–5; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 6). “The art of arts,” philosophy, here named wisdom (<italic>ḥikma</italic>), is in this respect paradigmatic. Averroës restates his claim forcefully, terming it a “self‐evident matter”: <disp-quote>
               <p>This is a self‐evident matter, not only with respect to the scientific arts, but also with respect to the practical ones. For there is not an art among them that a single person can bring about on his own. So how can this be done with the art of arts, wisdom? [<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 5; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 6]</p>
            </disp-quote> By definition the work of many and the work of many ages, wisdom is irreducibly historical. It can be grasped in the present only through a careful consideration of those “predecessors in former nations who have reflected upon existing things and considered them according to what is required by the conditions of demonstration” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 5; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 6). A single conclusion on the status of the classical practice remains to be drawn. Averroës restates the radical thesis at several points, the first formulations sounding a note of caution that is soon dispelled. As to the books of the ancients (<italic>kutub al‐qudamāʾ</italic>), he writes, “we ought perhaps to seize [them]… in our hands” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 4; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 5). “It is perhaps obligatory,” we read later, “for us to reflect upon what they say” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 5; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 6). “It has become evident,” he writes, still further, “that reflection upon the books of the ancients is obligatory according to the Law, for their aim and intention in their books is the very intention to which the Law urges us [<italic>ʾi</italic>

            <italic>anā š‐šarʿ</italic>]” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 5; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 6).</p>
         <p>The <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> would thus seem to exclude from the beginning the possibility of a conflict between the demands of revelation and the dictates of reason. As the indispensable “tool” (<italic>al‐āla</italic>) for the execution of the Law (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 3; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 4), the methods of the books of the ancients would appear to facilitate, not oppose, the ends of the Book of God. But Averroës nowhere avoids the question of the possible discord between wisdom and the Law. In their account of the place of ancient demonstrative reasoning in the legal order, the introductory sections of the work, on the contrary, aim precisely to elucidate the conditions in which the differences between the two can be measured and their implications assessed. The argument of the text is crystalline. The methods of demonstrative science may lead to the knowledge of a subject not mentioned in the teachings of the Law; they may also lead to the knowledge of one mentioned by them. If the subject is indeed not addressed by the Law, there can be no conflict with wisdom; the matter in question simply “has the status of the statutes passed over in silence, which the jurist infers by means of Law‐based syllogistic reasoning” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 7; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 9). If, on the other hand, the same subject is treated by demonstrative reflection as well as by the Law, two possibilities then remain: either the two accounts converge or they diverge. Convergence causes no trouble; the question of the relation between wisdom and <italic>šarīʿa</italic> arises only in the case of a divergence between the two. This is the case that interests the jurist‐philosopher and to which the rest of the <italic>Treatise</italic> is dedicated.</p>
         <p>How is one to respond when one reaches seeming contradictions between the dictates of the Law and the teachings of reason? The answer, on the surface, could not be clearer: one reads and one interprets. <disp-quote>
               <p>This is where one interprets. And the meaning of “interpretation” is: drawing out the figurative significance of an utterance from its true significance [<italic>i</italic>
                  <underline>

                  <italic>zīa</italic>] without violating the custom of the Arabic language with respect to figurative speech in doing so.… We firmly affirm that, whenever demonstration leads to something differing from the apparent sense of the Law, that apparent sense admits of interpretation according to the rule of interpretation in Arabic. [<italic>PTA</italic>, pp. 7–8; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 9]</p>
            </disp-quote> In the case of a seeming conflict between demonstration and legal doctrine, one must thus take recourse to <italic>ta</italic>ʾ<italic>wīl</italic>, “interpretation” or “explication”: the practice of reading by which the true sense of an obscure scriptural passage can be legitimately brought to light.22 The hermeneutic activity of “interpretation” alone reveals that when the intellectual syllogism implies one conclusion and the Law seems to lead to another, it is not so; in truth, the Law says more and the disagreement is merely apparent. The discord concerns only the literal meaning (<italic>dalāla l‐ḥaqīqīa</italic>) of the sacred text, its figurative meaning (<italic>dalāla l‐majāzīa</italic>), by contrast, being in agreement with the conclusions imposed by demonstration. Interpretation therefore plays a double role: “drawing out one meaning from another,” it simultaneously registers a conflict and resolves it, articulating the strata of textual understanding in which a discord between the demands of reason and revelation can be both read and read away. Here, too, Averroës cites the procedure of the jurist to support his argument. If legal “interpretation” is granted the jurist, whose syllogism is merely putative (<underline>
               <italic>z</italic>
            </underline>
            <italic>annī</italic>), it cannot but be admissible to “the one adhering to demonstration,” whose syllogism, by contrast, is certain (<italic>yaqīnī</italic>).23 There is considerable debate among Islamic schools concerning which verses of the Qurʾān may be interpreted and which not, but Averroës recalls that the permissibility of the interpretation of the Law as such is beyond doubt. It is a matter of agreement (ʾ<italic>ijma</italic>ʿ) among Muslims that “it is not obligatory for all the utterances of the Law to be taken in their apparent sense” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 8; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 10).</p>
         <p>The <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>, however, goes further in its vindication of interpretation. Far from being imposed on the sacred text from without, such “allegorical reading,” we learn, is demanded by the Qurʾān itself. A verse from the Sura of ʾImran furnishes the legal justification for <italic>taʾwīl</italic>, explaining its necessity on account of both nature and divine command: <disp-quote>
               <p>He it is who has sent down to you the Book; in it, there are univocal verses—these being the mother of the Book—and others that are equivocal. Those with deviousness in their hearts pursue the equivocal ones, seeking discord and seeking to interpret them. None knows their interpretation but God and those well grounded in science. They say, “We believe in it; everything is from our Lord.” And none heeds but those who are mindful.24</p>
            </disp-quote> The one Book appears here as composed of verses of two kinds: univocal (in the Qurʾānic formulation, literally “the fixed verses,” <italic>al‐ayāt al‐muḥkamāt</italic>) and equivocal (literally, “the verses that resemble each other,” <italic>al‐ayāt al‐mutašābihāt</italic>). When exploited by the devious, the equivocal verses lead to discord. But this need not be so; they are susceptible to interpretation. The sole question is who can accomplish such reading—and it is a question Averroës now resolves by an act of reading in the most literal sense. In its original as well as its canonical form, the Qurʾān contains no punctuation marks within its verses, a fact that can at times allow for a number of divergent interpretations. Averroës here exploits the syntactic and semantic possibilities of the sacred text by segmenting the verse he cites at a crucial point, placing a stop or period (<italic>waqf</italic>) not after “God,” as he might have, but after “those well grounded in science”: “None knows their interpretation except God and those well grounded in science.” The decision is significant; later in the <italic>Treatise</italic>, Averroës will propose a different <italic>lectio</italic> of the same passage.25 Here the placement of the period serves a definite purpose: it allows Averroës to adduce the legal basis of interpretation and, at the same time, to restrict its practice to the class of those who are by nature and habit well grounded in science. Interpretation then appears as a practice that is not only permissible but is strictly commanded to those capable of its mastery.</p>
         <p>The unity of demonstration and legal doctrine thus emerges as the result of a procedure restricted to the few both by God and by nature. Interpretation, the instrument of reconciliation between wisdom and the Law, remains inaccessible to those not well grounded in science at once because of their intellectual limitations and because of divine command. Averroës proceeds to argue that, as the prerogative of the few, the science of interpretation (<italic>ʿilm at‐taʾwīl</italic>) cannot be subject to the legal statutes that apply to the Muslim community as a whole. Calling into question a principle that had been central to the theologians' legal condemnation of the philosophers, Averroës casts doubt on the very possibility that the theoretical matters (<italic>an‐na</italic>
            <underline>
               <italic>z</italic>
            </underline>
            <italic>arīāt</italic>) decided by interpretation may be subject to the form of legal consensus (ʾ<italic>ijmāʿ</italic>) that obtains in practical matters (<italic>al‐</italic>ʿ<italic>amaliyāt</italic>) (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 8; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 11). As Robert Brunschvig has observed, the argument of the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> accords at this point with that of the <italic>Bidayāt</italic>, Averroës's great contribution to Islamic jurisprudence. Far from constituting an independent source of law, consensus, the jurist's primer argues, requires a foundation (<italic>mastanad</italic>) in a textual passage or in its rational interpretation; it cannot, in other words, decide on <italic>taʾwīl</italic>, for it is itself conditioned by it.26</p>
         <p>There are times in the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>, to be sure, when it may seem that Averroës places limitations on the force and extension of the interpretation conducted by those adept in science. He concedes, for example, that there are sacred texts that do not admit of interpretation; he acknowledges that the verses that all the learned men of an epoch found to be univocal must not be taken to be equivocal, even as those they found to be equivocal must not be taken as univocal; and he argues that interpretation may specify the manner of existence of what is discussed in the text of the law, but it may not go so far as to deny its existence altogether. But, as Gauthier long ago showed in detail, Averroës takes great pains to add to each of these propositions “a commentary that leaves no room for misunderstanding.”27 The texts that no one may interpret are those to which the form of the intellectual syllogism is foreign; the complete judgment of the learned men of an epoch can rarely, if ever, be ascertained with certainty; and, although he states that interpretation must never lead to the negation of what is discussed by the law, Averroës never suggests that such things (among which the question of the immortality of the soul) are not otherwise accessible to the autonomous methods of demonstration. Despite the apparent restrictions placed on interpretation, the limits of the allegorical license accorded to those cognizant in science remain difficult to define with precision.</p>
         <p>The importance of the concept of interpretation, therefore, can hardly be overestimated in this work. It is the foundation stone of the juridical edifice of the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>. Once proposed, defined, and vindicated on scriptural grounds, interpretation serves as the single instrument of reconciliation by which any apparent discord between the demands of demonstration and the dictates of Islam can be led back, in a movement of literal re‐duction, to a state of accord. Interpretation alone assures the justice of the legal determination with which the <italic>Treatise</italic> opens. Revealing the identity of the doctrines of reason and revelation, it provides the decisive confirmation that the Law commands the activity of demonstration in the strongest terms to all those who can practice it, its teachings coinciding with those to which syllogistic reflection leads. At the same time, the doctrine of interpretation sketched in the beginning of the work prepares the way for the conclusion formulated at its end: that wisdom, namely, is in truth “the companion of the Law and its milk sister” (<italic>ṣāḥiba š‐šarīʿat wa l‐ʾu</italic>
            <underline>
               <italic>h</italic>

            <italic>t ar‐raḍīa</italic>) (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 27; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 32).28 This is why it is necessary to examine the <italic>Treatise</italic>'s doctrine of legal hermeneutics more carefully. For the meaning of <italic>taʾwīl</italic> itself demands to be drawn out further and the concept of interpretation to be interpreted in more detail.</p>

               <p>It should be noted that in establishing such a relation between the forms of legal reasoning and demonstrative reasoning, Averroës decides on a complex and much debated problem in the history of Islamic jurisprudence and logic, namely, the meaning and status of what is called <italic>qiyās</italic>, “syllogism,” in each discipline. In jurisprudence,<italic> qiyās</italic> constitutes the fourth root of the Law and is often translated into European languages as “analogical reasoning” (being also named <italic>qiyās š‐šarʿī</italic> or <italic>qiyās fiqhī</italic>, “legal syllogism” or “juridical syllogism”); in the works of the philosophers, the term is used to render the Aristotelian “syllogism” (being also named <italic>qiyās ʿaqlī</italic> or <italic>qiyās mantiqī</italic>, “rational syllogism” or “logical syllogism”). For an overview of the Islamic <italic>qiyās</italic>, see M. Bernard, “Kiyās,” <italic>The Encyclopaedia of Islam</italic>, 5:239–42; Chaflik Chehata, “Logique juridique et droit musulman,” <italic>Studia Islamica</italic> 23 (1965): 9–25; and Brunschvig's more detailed case study of al‐Ghazālī, “Valeur et fondement du raisonnement juridique par analogie d’après al‐Ghazālī,” <italic>Études d’islamologie</italic>, 2:363–94.

Gustave E. von Grunebaum (Wiesbaden, 1970), pp. 51–83. The term <italic>qiyās</italic> also plays an important role in two other notable Islamic disciplines: apologetic theology (<italic>kalām</italic>) and grammar (<italic>naḥw</italic>); on the first, see, among others, Ahmed Alami, <italic>L’Ontologie modale: Étude de la théorie des modes d’Abū Hāšim al Ǧubbāʾi</italic> (Paris, 2001), pp. 121–29; for the second, see A.

         <title>3. Remnants of the Law, or Another “Interpretation” (<italic>Taʾwīl</italic>)</title>
         <p>The terms by which the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> defines the connection between wisdom and the law must be considered attentively, for they are in truth more complex than they might seem. The apparent agreement between demonstration and doctrine achieved by interpretation is not identity, and the figure of sorority with which the work as a whole closes implies not only a coincidence of purpose but also an irreducible difference. Precisely as the “handmaiden and milk sister” of the Law, wisdom cannot be altogether reduced to the entire body of obligations with which she would agree. Although Averroës begins his <italic>Treatise</italic> with a forceful vindication of demonstration as an activity commanded by the Law, he soon complicates his argument, indicating a limit to the practice of syllogistic reasoning. The ways of wisdom are not in all cases to be recommended, he specifies, and with respect to the vast majority of those subject to the Law the path to demonstration is to be barred altogether. Only a few paragraphs after adducing the justification for the practice of speculative interpretation, which alone reveals the accord between demonstration and doctrine, the jurist thus insists that its fruits must never be divulged to the greater part of humankind: “interpretations,” he writes, “must not be declared to the multitude, or established in rhetorical or dialectical books” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 45; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 26; trans. mod.).</p>
         <p>How is one to reconcile such an assertion with the treatise's earlier plea for the permissibility and even necessity of the cultivation of demonstration? It does not so much contradict the legal injunction to reflect upon beings as it does complicate and complete it. It specifies that the injunction does not hold for all; positively stated, its force is restricted to the few. The commandment to consider is in this sense representative of the simultaneously universal and equivocal structure of the Law. As a single code that is both political and theological, the Law, as Averroës understands it, applies to all; but since all are not alike, it must do so according to different forms, containing, within the limits of a single text, “different methods of calling to God” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 7; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 8). On account of its very universality, by which it holds for everyone, “the red as well as the black,” the Law must therefore assume within itself the plurality of humanity, addressing each according to the degree of his intellectual capacity.29 Such is the interpretation that Averroës offers of the Qurʾānic imperative to “call to the path of your Lord by wisdom, fine preaching, and arguing with them by means of what is finest” (Qurʾān 16:125; <italic>PTA</italic>, p. 7; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 8). Because of the natural diversity of man, the paths to the one God cannot coincide; the Law cannot make the same demands upon all its subjects. The legal status of wisdom illustrates the principle: commanded to those capable of it, it is, at the same time, forbidden to the multitude.</p>
         <p>With respect to the Law, Averroës explains, there are three classes (<italic>aṣnāf</italic>) of people, each of which is defined by a specific intellectual capacity and a corresponding form of assent (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 21; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 26). The “overwhelming multitude” of men belongs to the first class, which consists of those whom Averroës calls the rhetorical people (<italic>al‐</italic>
            <underline>
               <italic>h</italic>
            </underline>
            <italic>aṭābīūn</italic>); they are “in no way adept at interpretation,” for they cannot be moved except by persuasive arguments. There are then the dialectical people (<italic>al‐jadalīūn</italic>), who, whether by nature or by habit, are adept in dialectical interpretation (<italic>at‐ta</italic>ʾ<italic>wīl al‐jadalī</italic>). Finally, there are the demonstrative ones (<italic>al‐burhānīūn</italic>), the few who are capable of certain interpretation (<italic>at‐taʾwīl al‐yaqīnī</italic>) by nature and by the cultivation of wisdom. Averroës stresses the danger of imparting the results of demonstrative interpretation to the first two classes of men; such a divulgence, he writes, leads “both he who declares it and the one to whom it is declared … to unbelief [<italic>kufr</italic>]” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 21; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 26). The reason is simple: demonstrative interpretation, as the “drawing out of the figurative significance of an utterance from its true significance,” involves both “the rejection of the apparent sense and the establishing of the interpretation.” All are capable of the first act, by which the apparent meaning of a legal utterance is dismissed, but only those capable of demonstration can grasp the figurative sense. The attempt to impart demonstrative interpretation to those unsuited to it may thus lead to the rejection of an apparent meaning without its replacement by its own certain interpretation. It may end, that is, in the suspension of the entire significance of the legal utterance. The reasons for which the truth of wisdom cannot be disclosed to all, therefore, are both natural and political. The attempt to publicize the procedure and results of demonstration would not only be doomed to failure on account of the intellectual limitations of the many; more gravely, it would bring about a state of “unbelief about the roots of the Law” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 21; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 26). Certain interpretation must for this reason be subject to a double prohibition, both from below, so to speak, and from above; those who are incapable of apprehending it must not aspire to it, and those who are its masters must not seek to impart it to those unsuited to it.30</p>
         <p>Averroës finds the legal justification for the prohibition of interpretation in the very same passage that he earlier invoked in arguing for its permissibility. Returning to the Qurʾānic statement on equivocal verses, univocal verses, and the knowledge of those well grounded in science, he now reads the authoritative statement a second time, offering a fundamentally different interpretation of the capital utterance on interpretation. When discussing difficult utterances in the Law with those who are not adept in the science of demonstration, he writes, <disp-quote>
               <p>it is obligatory to declare and to say, with respect to the apparent sense … that it is one of those [verses] that is equivocal [whose interpretation] is not known, except to God, and that it is obligatory for the period in His saying (may He be exalted) to be placed here: “None knows their interpretation but God” (Qurʾān 3:7). In the same way is the answer to come forth with respect to a question about obscure matters for whose understanding no path exists for the multitude. [<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 21; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 27; trans. mod.]</p>
            </disp-quote> Here Averroës transforms the meaning of the Qurʾānic passage he cites in the moment in which he recalls it. Earlier in the <italic>Treatise</italic>, seeking to vindicate the interpretation of those adept in science (<italic>ahl al‐ʿilm</italic>), he had cited the legal utterance from the third Sura and proposed the following reading of its syntax: “None knows their interpretation but God and those well grounded in science.” Exploiting the possibilities of syntactic segmentation in the Qurʾān, Averroës now moves the period, or “stop,” from the position in which he placed it earlier, obtaining a second statement: None knows their interpretation but God. It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of this most minute of grammatical operations.31 By displacing the period in the verse, Averroës draws from a single legal text two distinct—and conflicting—propositions. The first declares that interpretation is known by God as well as the men of learning; the second insists that “none knows their interpretation but God.” The first, in other words, justifies the interpretation of men; the second strips it of any possible condition of legitimacy. As such, the double reading of the passage supports the double claim that Averroës advances throughout the work: that interpretation must be recognized as commanded by the Law and, at the same time, with respect to a different class of men, forbidden by it.</p>
         <p>The term <italic>interpretation</italic>, in this way, is itself interpreted. Its meaning in the Qurʾān is drawn out not once but twice and not in a single sense but in two seemingly opposed forms, which nevertheless form complementary propositions within the argument of the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>. The twofold status of the textual object at issue in the work—interpretation—is mirrored in the practice of the juridico‐philosophical text. Just as interpretation, in the terms of the <italic>Treatise</italic>, is both commanded to the few adept in the art of demonstration and forbidden to the majority that does not master it, so the phrase in which the scriptural term <italic>interpretation</italic> (<italic>ta'wīl</italic>) is cited lends itself to a double reading, according to which the allegorical explication of the equivocal verses of the Law is said to be both within the province of men (“None knows their interpretation but God and those well grounded in science”) and outside it (“None knows their interpretation but God”). The consequences of this complex status of interpretation are capital. If the practice of interpretation functions in the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> as the single instrument of the unification of demonstration and doctrine, then it is at the same time the instrument of their division. As a practice commanded by the Law, interpretation works to join the results of pagan demonstration and legal doctrine, but as an activity forbidden by it, it must sunder them, separating the dogmas of Islam from those of the ancients. The ends (<italic>maqṣūd</italic>) of the Law may, in certain cases, be reduced to those of syllogistic reasoning, but they therefore do not coincide altogether with those of the pagan art of arts. There is an element in the law that does not exhaust itself in philosophy, an element that, more strongly put, stands in conflict with it and that finds expression precisely in the legal prohibition of philosophy. At once commanding interpretation and banning it, the Law not only welcomes the methods of demonstration within it; at the same time, it also leaves them outside it. In its exhortation to reflect upon beings it stands united with wisdom; but in its appeal to all and to an all that forms a single civic order, it remains, by necessity, apart from it.</p>

         <title>4. Remnants of Philosophy, or “Wisdom” (<italic>ḥikma</italic>)</title>
         <p>The relation between the Law and wisdom, however, is still more complex. It is defined not only by the fact that the Law at once commands and forbids the methods of demonstration, simultaneously including syllogistic reasoning within its domain and excluding it. Wisdom, for its part, also bears a double relation to the Law. Defined in the terms of the five qualifications of Islamic jurisprudence, it belongs to the sphere of the Law. But as the undeniable product of an age before the giving of the Law, it retains a history and a form that are altogether its own. If the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> can be read as an attempt to transform philosophy into the object of the Law, then it must also be said to indicate the unavoidable, if paradoxical, limit with which any such procedure of “legalization” is necessarily confronted:32 the Law may command reflection upon beings and reflection in its highest form only by commanding the cultivation of what, strictly speaking, lies beyond it. For in urging “the most complete kind of reflection by means of the most complete kind of syllogistic reasoning” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 2; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 3), the Law cannot but enjoin those adept in science to venture into the terrain of an art invented, developed, and refined long before its time. It must call those capable of demonstration, within Islam, to dedicate themselves to the study of the works of “those Ancients … before the religion of Islam” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 4; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 4). Defined by the Law and yet at least in part independent of it, wisdom therefore occupies a delicate position within the economy of the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>; it constitutes an object that, at least for the adept in science, is legally required and yet extralegal in origin. Averroës does not shy away from the radical and seemingly paradoxical consequence of such a definition of wisdom, not only for the classical science, but for the Law as a whole. In certain cases, it follows, the execution of the Law depends on a practice that lies, in a sense, outside it, as a legal supplement that is irreducibly foreign to the Law and yet absolutely necessary for its execution.</p>
         <p>The <italic>Treatise</italic>'s argument for the study of the intellectual syllogism (<italic>al‐qiyās al‐ʿaqlī</italic>) is in this regard instructive. It cannot be doubted that Averroës takes intellectual syllogistic reasoning to be the basis of demonstration, therefore, and the indispensable means for the fulfillment of the commandment to reflect upon beings. Yet Averroës nowhere seeks to deny or even to conceal its historical independence of Islam. The argument of the <italic>Treatise</italic>, instead, takes as its point of departure the fact that the “Ancients” not only invented syllogistic reasoning but also “investigated it in the most complete manner” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 4; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 5). When the <italic>Treatise</italic> justifies the ancient science of demonstration, it does so precisely as a practice that was invented and perfected long before Islam. Making use of an Arabic equivalent for the Greek term for Aristotle's logical works, <italic>organon</italic>, Averroës casts the Greek science of demonstration as a tool (<italic>āla</italic>) without which the act commanded by the Law could not be performed:33 <disp-quote>
               <p>If someone other than us has already investigated that [that is, intellectual syllogistic reasoning], it is evidently obligatory for us to rely on what the one who has preceded us says about what we are pursuing, regardless of whether that other person shares our religion or not. For when a valid sacrifice is performed by means of a tool, no consideration is given, with respect to the validity of the sacrifice, as to whether the tool belongs to someone who shares in our religion or not, so long as it fulfills the conditions for validity. And by “not sharing [in our religion],” I mean those Ancients who reflected upon these things before the religion of Islam. [<italic>PTA</italic>, pp. 3–4; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 4]</p>
            </disp-quote> Averroës's reasoning, on the surface, is traditional. It follows the Islamic principle once expressed in the statement attributed to Mohammed according to which men should “seek learning, even if it be from China.”34 But the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> draws from this principle a startling consequence that casts a new light on the foreign art, emptied of all content in being treated as a mere instrument of reasoning.35 The Islamic precept to reflect upon beings, as Averroës presents it, cannot be followed except by a seeming detour through pagan science; and wisdom, as a result, ultimately proves essential to the execution of the Law. Averroës insists that intellectual syllogistic reasoning is irreplaceable. It alone, in distinction to other forms of reasoning, such as the juridical syllogism invented by the doctors of the Law, assures absolute certainty in reflection. The tool, in short, proves indispensable; in itself independent of the Law, it is that without which the Law, on its own terms, cannot be fulfilled. And if the Law commands wisdom, it can consequently do so only by commanding that something foreign to it belong to it. Demanding a supplement to itself, the Law must urge that what is outside it be within it and, furthermore, be within it in such a way that allows for its own fulfillment.</p>
         <p>Arguing that wisdom is commanded by the Law and that such wisdom is in its entirety the creation of those Ancients before Islam, the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>, therefore, suggests two propositions, which must be apprehended simultaneously if the complexity of the work as a whole is to be fully understood. The Law requires the methods of demonstration for its execution; and yet these methods, which hark back to a time before the religion of Islam, possess an autonomy that removes them, as the creation of those who do not “share our religion,” at least in part from the domain of the Law. The Law, in short, commands wisdom, which it requires for its fulfillment. But the converse does not hold; the methods of demonstration, as Averroës presents them, show no need of the Law. In part, it is a matter of method; as a juridical inquiry, the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> offers us an analysis of wisdom in the terms of the Law, but it can tell us nothing of the Law in terms of “wisdom,” were such a thing conceivable. Wisdom as such remains outside the purview of the <italic>Treatise</italic>, and it therefore remains possible that the juridical tract has not truly seized hold of the pagan science. It may be that the art of arts, considered solely “from the perspective of the Law,” has not revealed its true face (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 1; <italic>BDT</italic>, p. 1). The terminology of the text suggests as much: here the pagan science is consistently called not by the proper name known to its Islamic detractors and defenders, philosophy, but by the generic term <italic>wisdom</italic>.36 It is as if the science of demonstration, summoned before the Law, concealed itself behind a pseudonym, appearing in court in the name of another.</p>
         <p>The term <italic>falsafa</italic> appears only once in the entire <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>, in a passage that bears the trace of the difficulty of incorporating the ancient object into an Islamic discourse. It is the opening of the work: <disp-quote>
               <p>So we say: since the activity of philosophy is nothing other than reflection upon beings and consideration of them insofar as they are an indication of the Artisan—I mean insofar as they are artifacts, for beings indicate the Artisan only through the cognizance of art in them, and the more complete cognizance of the art in them is, the more complete is cognizance of the Artisan—and since the Law has recommended and urged consideration of existing things, then it is evident that what this name indicates is either obligatory or recommended by the Law. [<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 1; <italic>BDT</italic>, pp. 1–2; trans. mod.]</p>
            </disp-quote> Close examination of this founding chain of deductions shows it to be more complex than it would at first seem. In its Arabic form, the first premise is ambiguous on account of the single syntactic particle (<italic>ʾin</italic>) with which it opens (<italic>wa ʾin kānat fī l al‐falsafa laysa šayʾan ʾak</italic>

It is a term that can be translated as either “since” or “if.” The first phrase, in other words, can certainly be rendered in English as “<italic>since</italic> the activity of philosophy is nothing other than reflection upon beings and consideration of them insofar as they are an indication of the artisan.” But it can also be translated as “<italic>if</italic> the activity of philosophy is nothing other than reflection upon beings and consideration of them insofar as they are an indication of the artisan.”37 Calling attention to the formulation in a subtle reading of the <italic>Treatise</italic>, Muhsin Mahdi has drawn the consequence that it implies for the logical character of all the propositions that follow it: depending on one's reading of the syncategoreme, the argument of the work “can be assumed to be either hypothetical or categorical in character.”38 The interpretation of the premise as categorical poses no problems; it assures, on the contrary, the force of the demonstration that follows. But if the opening premise, instead, is hypothetical in character, the entire argument of the <italic>Treatise</italic> changes in nature. It remains possible that the activity of philosophy is indeed “something other than the reflection upon beings and consideration of them insofar as they are an indication of the artisan” and that, therefore, the legal tract has not truly apprehended the object of its juridical scrutiny. For if the activity of philosophy is not that which it is said to be at the opening of the <italic>Treatise</italic>, then all the ensuing propositions in the work, which bear on philosophy defined as such and renamed as wisdom, remain without a solid foundation. The legal judgment of “wisdom,” as a whole, would then falter, since it would never have truly borne on the pagan science as such.</p>
         <p>On account of both its explication of the Law and its examination of wisdom, the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> thus complicates, as Mahdi has noted, the summary of it that Averroës seems to offer at the beginning of another work, the <italic>Uncovering of the Methods of Proofs with Respect to the Beliefs of the Religious Community</italic> (<italic>Kašf ʿan manāhij al‐adilla fī ʿaqā</italic>ʾ<italic>id al‐milla</italic>), which follows it in the trilogy of which the <italic>Treatise</italic> is the middle member. There Averroës writes, with deceptive simplicity: “Now then, we have explained earlier, in a separate speech, the congruence of human wisdom and the divine Law” (<italic>PTA</italic>, p. 27).39 A reading of the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic> leads one to conclude that congruence (<italic>muṭābaqa</italic>), in such a passage, cannot signify any perfect coincidence. It is instead the cipher of a complex relationship for which no single name is readily available. By virtue of the structures of divine Law and human wisdom, the relation must be one of simultaneous sameness and difference, a doubly complicated bond in which the Law at once includes and excludes wisdom and in which wisdom, in turn, shows itself both to complete the Law and, in the end, to elude its judgment altogether.</p>

         <title>5. A Maimonidean Parable, or a Difficult Relationship</title>
         <p>In July 1842 the <italic>Journal Asiatique</italic> published an extended study of the life and works of the enigmatic young figure to whom Maimonides dedicated his <italic>Guide of the Perplexed</italic> and who, in one way or another, had resisted easy historical identification since the completion of the Judaeo‐Arabic work in the twelfth century.40 The author, Salomon Munk, who was later to become the first critical editor of Maimonides's philosophical masterpiece, published as an appendix a small dossier of pertinent texts that had not yet appeared in print: three Hebrew letters between Maimonides and the dedicatee of the <italic>Guide</italic>, Joseph ben Yehuda, two of which were by the teacher and one by the pupil. Brief works of ostensibly modest purport, the letters could easily be overlooked by scholars of medieval thought, and since their publication they have rarely been considered to be of more than biographical significance. But the truth is that the epistolary exchange furnishes precious material, which casts an unexpected light on the philosophy of Maimonides and Averroës both.</p>
         <p>Munk, for his part, introduced the texts in terms that, although enthusiastic, were hardly meant to encourage their speculative interpretation. In a note added to the last letter, Munk expressed his hope that the newly discovered writings might “contribute to the clarification of certain historical facts of the lives of Maimonides and Joseph” (“SJI,” p. 68). The reader expecting elements for a properly historical elucidation of the relation between the author and his dedicatee, however, would be sorely disappointed, since it is difficult to consider the letters simple documents in any sense. The epistles invoked to help elucidate the historical circumstances in which the <italic>Guide</italic> was written are themselves brilliant examples of the ornate and highly crafted literary style favored by the great prose writers of medieval Andalusia. Introducing the exchange, Munk thus observed that the letters “are full of allusions to Biblical and Talmudic passages,” in which one “often finds fragments of verses from the Bible taken in figurative senses, which makes translation quite difficult.” Comparing the letters to the formally complex classical Arabic literary genre of the <italic>maqama</italic>, which in Andalusia was written in both Arabic and Hebrew, Munk added: “This was the prevalent style of the epoch, of which the <italic>Taḥkemoni</italic> [by al‐Ḥarīzī] remains one of the most beautiful examples” (“SJI,” pp. 61–62).</p>
         <p>The first two missives consist of a letter from Joseph to Maimonides and a fragmentary response from the teacher to his disciple.41 Both are entirely concerned with the difficult relationship between husband and wife, of which each letter gives its own explanation. The first epistle recounts the tale of the discord from the perspective of the unhappy husband, who refers to himself alternately in the first and third person. Prefaced by a title indicating the names of the two correspondents, it reads as follows: <disp-quote>
               <p>Question Posed by the Honorable Rabbi Joseph ben Simeon, One of the Disciples of the First Order, to Rabbi Moses ben Maimūn:</p>
               <p>It was a single thought and a single tongue [that we brought to bear] on our language, and no one else came between us. This is how he [your disciple] began: He found shelter in the shade of your friendship, he poured out his prayer, and he laid bare his whole soul before your faithfulness. It is I myself who speak to you here. Speak, since I would like to know your reasons; if you have words, answer me [Job 30:32]. Did your beloved daughter, the Pleaides, the beautiful, the charming, not find grace before me yesterday? The maiden pleased me, and, in all sincerity, I became engaged to her according to the law and the rule given on Sinai. I married her by these three things [Mishna 3, 1, 1]: giving as a dowry the silver of friendship; writing her a love contract, since I loved her; and embracing her as the young man embraces the virgin [Isaiah 42:5]. And after having won her by all these means, I invited her to the wedding bed of love; I used neither rhetoric nor violence, yet she gave me her love since I had given her mine and had tied my soul to hers. All this happened before the two well‐known witnesses, our friends Ben ʿUbeid Allah and Ben Rushd.</p>
               <p>Yet even while she was in the wedding bed, under my control, she betrayed me and turned to other lovers; she was an “impudent bride who begins her adultery in the wedding bed,” as it is said in an ancient proverb. And yet she could reproach me nothing for which she might thus retreat from me [Jer. 2:5] and leave my home. She ceased to show me her beautiful face and to allow me to hear her soft voice. And you, you neither blamed your daughter nor exposed her, and you found her neither sinful nor guilty; perhaps you were even the one who arranged it all, which would be a great evil. Now, return the wife to her husband, for he is or will be a prophet; he will pray for you and you will live [Gen. 20:7], and he will also pray for her, to raise her up again and support her. If you do not return her, know that you will be inscribed in the end of the verse [Gen. 20:7]; help to make peace and go find her. And so that you may be happy and to live a long time, make use of your ears, and listen to the words of the Sages who say “Blessed are those who return a lost thing to its owner”—all the more so when it is a question of a strong woman, the crown of her husband. I hope for her return and I pray for her; I shall summon for her all peoples and all kingdoms; my soul pours itself out for her every day. Among these peoples, she will find no rest [Deut. 28:65]; happy is he who waits and obtains [Dan. 12:12].</p>
               <p>The servant of your love, faithful to your covenant, whose desires to see the face of your excellency and who lies in the dust at the feet of your highness,</p>
               <p>Joseph ben Yehuda ben Simeon[“SJI,” pp. 61–64]</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>The medieval codex presents Maimonides's reponse, which seems interrupted before its end, in the following form: <disp-quote>
               <p>Here is the Response that Rabbi Moses ben Maimūn Gave to this Question:</p>
               <p>Listen to my words, Sages, attend to me and come to me! Judge between my adversary and me and, if I am guilty, find me here and bear witness against me.</p>
               <p>I gave my daughter, the Pleiades, to my son‐in‐law, Orion [or “fool”: the Hebrew term,<graphic xlink:href="ii1"

 , means both]; he took her in hatred, despite her being solidly established in the domain of faithfulness, and he took her for a courtesan because she had veiled her face [Gen. 38:15]. Since the day she set foot in his net, and when he shamefully uncovered her nudity [Ezek. 16:36], a spirit of jealousy has passed over him and he has been jealous of his wife. He has denied her food, clothing, and a home [Exod. 21:10]; he has held slanderous speeches against her and given her a poor reputation [Deut. 32:14]. And after he bound her with his chains [Job 38:31], he plotted deceitfully against her virginity; among the gifts brought by the bridegroom he cast the fire of his jealousy. He has wrongly accused her of illicit affairs, and he has committed a double wrong by seeking to convince me of her ill repute. This is what this man told me: “Your daughter was unfaithful to me in her wedding bed. Look now, and behold her shame; reproach her for her unfaithfulness and return her to her husband, for he is a prophet and will pray for you and for her. He will restore her virtue, strengthening her steps and effacing her crime, for he does not wish for her death and God will forgive her when her father has brought her back [Num. 30:6].”</p>
               <p>Yet you know this man and his language [Kings II 9:11], for he says his whole mind. He has a great faith in himself and dares to utter a judgment in the presence of his master [Talmud <italic>Erubin</italic> 63 r, Midrash <italic>Vayikra raba</italic>, 20, 6]. Thus does he utter slander [by accident], like a blind man [who gropes] in the dark; he even places himself on a level with the prophets. For he is looking for a pretext and a reason to commit bad actions and to speak with pride. But you know that this is a man of impure lips; for she is unsullied and untouched by any hand. Far from having done such things, being unfaithful to her husband, committing an infamy in Israel, not following.… [“SJI,” pp. 60–61, 64–66]</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>That something other than a marriage (in the literal sense) is at issue in these letters was immediately noted by Munk, who interpreted the young man's letter in the following terms: <disp-quote>
               <p>The young bride of whom Joseph complains in this allegorical letter is without doubt philosophy, which he had made his companion and which did not give him all the satisfaction that he had sought in it. In a moment in which doubt has overtaken his soul, Joseph communicates his disappointment to his teacher, Maimonides, and he reproaches him for the unfaithfulness of his beloved daughter, that is, the falsity of the doctrine that Maimonides imparted to him. [“SJI,” p. 61]</p>
            </disp-quote> Maimonides, however, is not the sole philosophical figure involved in this tale of marital trouble, nor is he the only one responsible for the passage of the “beloved daughter” from the house of her father to that of her newfound husband. The letter clearly states that at the wedding there were two figures—the only contemporaries mentioned by name in the body of the correspondence, where they are cited as guarantors of the legal validity of the marriage. “All this happened,” the epistle reports, referring to the nuptial ceremonies, “before the two well‐known witnesses, our friends Ben ʿUbeid Allah and Ben Rushd” (“SJI,” p. 62). The two titles barely mask the identities of the two great philosophers of twelfth‐century Andalusia: Ben ʿUbeid Allah is a surname of Maimonides, and ben Rushd represents a minimally modified version of the Arabic form of the name Averroës, ibn Rushd. If one follows Munk's reading, according to which Joseph's charges against his bride are to be taken as the expression of a dissatisfaction with philosophy, then the question posed by the letter is directed not only at Maimonides but also at the second witness of the wedding, Averroës.</p>
         <p>The interpretation of the correspondence, however, can go still further. It may be that the bride is not the only figure in the letters that lends herself to an allegorical reading. The bridegroom, too, may well be understood as a <italic>persona ficta</italic>. “Either a prophet or a prophet to be,” Joseph repeatedly casts himself here as the representative of the Law. Not only is his accusation juridical in content, alleging the adultery of a woman to whom he was united “according to the law and rule given at Sinai,” but its very form betrays that of the legal inquiry. The name borne by the pupil's epistle in the medieval manuscript (<graphic xlink:href="ii2"
                     rotation="0"
                     alt-version="no"

                     xlink:type="simple"/>
) may be translated as a “question,” but it may also be rendered as a “petition” in the legal meaning of the term, a formal query, posed to an authority of the Law, concerning the exact juridical status of an act. Such an interpretation of the letter's form is confirmed by the response it elicits from its addressee. If one examines the Hebrew version of the exchange closely, it becomes apparent that Maimonides replies to his pupil with an epistle whose title marks it as a work of a well‐defined juridical form; the medieval codex introduces the master's “response to the question [or petition]” as a <italic>responsum</italic> in the technical sense, a Jewish legal advisory (<graphic xlink:href="ii3"
                     rotation="0"
                     alt-version="no"

                     position="float"
                     xlink:type="simple"/>
) that corresponds exactly to the Muslim juridical response of which Averroës's own book “on the relation between Law and wisdom” is an eminent example.</p>
         <p>The terminological details are of great significance, for, when brought together with the analysis of the literary figure of the bridegroom, they allow the entire correspondence to be read in a new light. As an epistolary exchange concerning the legal charges brought against philosophy by a representative of the Law, the letters can be read as an exploration, in miniature, of the very problem examined by the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>: that of the relation (<italic>ittiṣāl</italic>)—felicitous or not—between philosophy and the Law, considered from the perspective of the Law and presented according to the forms of legal analysis. The sisters of which Averroës writes in the conclusion of his <italic>Treatise</italic> thus become, in the literary correspondence, amorous figures whose relationship demands legal justification. Just as the doctors and judges of Islamic Law charge that only unbelief (<italic>kufr</italic>) and heresy (<italic>zandaqa</italic>) could come of philosophy, thereby provoking the response of the Arabic practitioners of the ancient art, so Joseph, the man of Jewish Law, now drafts his legal petition against “the beautiful and charming” daughter for whom he gave his dowry, demanding of his teacher in philosophy a formal account of the crimes of which he holds her responsible. And just as in the <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>, Averroës, making use of the legal terms of his adversaries, at once justifies philosophy before the Law and indicates the points at which it must escape its grasp, so Maimonides, responding to the slanderous allegation that his daughter is “an infamy in Israel,” turns the son‐in‐law's terms against him, invoking scriptural figures both to defend the accused and to explain the true reason for the discord between the allegorical husband and wife: “he took her for a courtesan because she had veiled her face” (“SJI,” p. 32).42</p>
         <p>The terms of the speculative parable sketched in the correspondence are, in this sense, clear, and it is difficult not to draw from them the conclusion they imply for the thought of the two Andalusian thinkers to whom they allude. Philosophy is the pagan maiden whom the young man, the Law, must marry, but whom he cannot fully possess. She is the bride who retreats from her bridegroom “even while in the wedding bed,” not because she wishes to turn to other lovers, as the jealous husband contends, but because she cannot fully be comprehended by the legal contract. Tolerated and at times commanded by the Law, the ancient art cannot be assured a secure place in the terms of its rule. Sooner or later, philosophy will be accused of unfaithfulness for not showing itself fully, with its “beautiful face and soft voice,” before the court of law. If it is not sentenced to death, philosophy, the correspondence suggests, can at best hope to follow the path of the “Sage” of Shem Tob ben Falaquera's <italic>Epistle on the Debate of Wisdom and the Law</italic>, who, at the end of a tense confrontation with an aggressively pious interlocutor, succeeds in gaining the right to continue on his way of “learning the truth from those who speak it, even though they be infidels, just as he takes honey from bees.”43 It is no failure for the representatives of philosophy and the Law to take leave of each other in this way, just as the marital conflict recorded in the epistolary exchange does not necessarily announce the utter dissolution of the union between husband and wife. In a sense, it is at this point alone that the discordant figures are nearest to one another. For it is in veiling her face that the bride unveils herself as fully as she can to her new husband, just as it is in taking leave of his devout interlocutor that Falaquera's “Sage” shows him his profession most clearly. These accused figures reveal themselves before the Law most truly when they show themselves to be in flight from it.</p>
         <p>Philosophy, in the end, eludes the custody of the court that would try it, but it would be a mistake to conclude that, for this reason, it completely concealed itself before it. One may even assert the contrary: the very movement by which the art of arts retreats from the Law exposes it before it. For philosophy, as the Arabic and Hebrew philosophers of the Middle Ages knew well, is nothing if not the attempt to define that element over which the Law has no hold, which stands before the Law and simultaneously exceeds its grasp. Philosophy constitutes less a doctrine of judgment than a science of its limits, and, in evading the sentences imposed upon it the ancient practice pays homage to the object of its art. Summoned before the Law, wisdom can no better represent itself than in the step by which it moves away from it; it can no better show itself before the Law than by the veil by which it covers its face before it. Accused by the Law without being seen by it, called to court without being truly named by it, philosophy here renders itself adequate to its own prime matter, which destines it, by necessity, to stand in conflict with the legal powers of its age. Beyond condemnation and commendation alike, the art of arts now assumes the likeness of its own object—that which escapes judgment in the moment in which it is submitted to it, forever “unsullied,” like the silent bride, and “untouched by any hand.”</p>

               <p>It has been noted, in a different context, that Maimonides's philosophical writings at a number of points recall the argument of Averroës's <italic>Decisive Treatise</italic>, notably in its juridical justification of philosophical “reflection.” See Warren Zev Harvey, “Averroës and Maimonides on the Obligation of Philosophical Reflection (ʿ<italic>itibar</italic>),” <italic>Tarbiz</italic> 58 (Oct.–Dec. 1988): 75–83. See also the remarks on the subject in Rémi Brague, <italic>La Sagesse du monde: Histoire de l’expérience humaine de l’univers</italic> (Paris, 1999), pp. 199–200, and, on the problem more generally, see Herbert Alan Davidson, “The Study of Philosophy as a Religious Obligation,” in <italic>Religion in a Religious Age</italic>, ed.
