Courtesy of Sandia National Laboratories. 26</page><page sequence="2">The Entomic Age DEVIN FORE Although separated by nearly eighty years, the two images on the left perform the same rhetorical operation. Both salute a technological marvel through contrast with a living creature. Behold the scales of the new machine, they announce: in 1921 a dynamo rotor so massive that it dwarfs the mortal technician who services it; in the late 1990s a chain of gears so miniscule that a spider mite would barely notice them. The first, a Lewis Hine photograph, displays a rotor that has been removed from its housing in the generator and been propped, upright and frontal, against the darkness of the factory background. Only a few distant visual incidents-some windows and fluorescent tubes-perforate the shadows of the space and establish a set of deep, receding orthogonals. Otherwise the industrial form at the center completely dominates the scene. To the right of the colossal steel anemone, Hine has set up a bright flash, whose light diffuses over the metallic surfaces of the disc and fades into the inky setting at the left. The narrative conceit of the photo seems evident enough: with rod and ruler in hand, the techni cian has mounted the giant rotor in order to assess one of its features, perhaps to verify the uniform distribution of wear on the disc. Yet something about this act of calibration is implau sible. It is too showy. Standing off-center to the left, the technician grants the camera an unobstructed view of his performance. Like Hine's most famous photographic paean to industrial labor, which, taken one year before, captured not the reality of factory toil so much as a soft-core fantasy of a muscled proletarian "at work" before a steam pump, the stiff technician in this photograph is all too posed. He does not measure but instead demonstrates the gesture of measuring. The ruler that the technician displays is an old trope of scientific photography that dates back to a much earlier moment in the history of the medium. In his photographs for the United States geological surveys of the 1860s and 1870s, Timothy O'Sullivan, for example, regularly included rulers to indicate the scale of the objects that he recorded. In Hine's photograph, however, two rulers are present, and a second scale is estab lished: this is the scale of the technician himself, whose body conveys the relative size of the dynamo to the spectator. In this regard, the nineteenth-century precursor would be not Timothy O'Sullivan but Maxime Du Camp, the amateur photographer who, in his 1849-1851 tour of Egypt and the Near East with his friend Gustave Flaubert, regularly included human figures as 'I aSSa( ot 2 7</page><page sequence="3">indicators of scale in his photographic docu mentation of the monuments of the ancient world. As Alberti had long before suggested in his treatise On Painting, the placement of the human form within a perspectivally inte grated pictorial field establishes, immediately and intuitively, the relative sizes of the other objects contained in this field: "Since man is the thing best known to man, perhaps Protagoras, by saying that man is the mode and measure of all things, meant that all the acci dents of things are known through comparison to the accidents of man."' Nature may be chaotic and contingent, Alberti suggests, but at least some of its accidents have human con tours. The latter accidents become our share of the chaos. The presence of the technician's body thus imparts to the viewer vital information about the magnitude of the rotor. By providing the specta tor with a familiar point of reference, this figure literally human- Above: Lewis Hine. Mechanic izes the technical artifact on display.

Without this human form to give an impression of the artifact's scale, the rotor would be a visual ornament of uncertain dimensions, yet another manifestation of the decontextualized technological fetish that was the stock-in-trade of New Objectivity photography. The second image, made a decade ago with a scanning elec tron microscope (SEM), presents the spectator with a surrogate that is far more problematic and an interpretive task that is accordingly more challenging. Like Hine's photograph, this image relies on a zoomorphic gauge to indicate the relative scale of the technological wonder. But here a spider mite stands in for the technician. Gone is the most intuitive and expressive of measures, the human body, replaced by the mute carapace that hovers to the right. Mediated through an anatomy and a sensorium that are radically unlike our own, the Umwelt of the mite, to invoke biosemiotician Jakob von Uexkull's term, is inaccessible to the human imagination. In the SEM image, the mite's body may help to contextualize the fantastical scale of the tiny nanomechanism, but it is a context and a measure that unfold far beyond the natural spatiotemporal parameters of human existence. The disorienting effects of the alien scale are further compounded by the ambiguity of the spatial relations 28 Grey Roomn 33</page><page sequence="4">in the SEM image. Unlike the high contrast values and deep recessional space of Hine's photograph, the flat, uniformly focused, and evenly illuminated visual field here fails to I indicate the relations of proximity and dis &gt; 4 tance that could secure the body of the spec tator in real, lived space.2 This space has no depth, nor any of the standard devices (con verging orthogonals, horizon line, etc.) used _ ; * , by post-Renaissance optical theory to dis = tinguish between fore- and background. It is not just that the anatomy of the mite renders alien the scene depicted here; so, too, does the visual technology behind it. The substitution of the human body by that of the insect, both as an indicator of scale and an anchor of experience, marks an epis m temic threshold that separates the 1920s from the 1990s. The present essay examines a remarkable and farsighted document of this transition, Ernst Jiinger's Glass Bees. Written in 1957, at a moment almost exactly between Hine's photograph and the SEM image, Jiinger's science fiction novel limns vividly this transi tion from the mesoscopic scale of the human to the micro scopic scale of the insect. Glass Bees registers a shift in the technological order that, although already underway in the first half of the twentieth century, was realized on a massive scale only in the 1950s, when, at the advent of the atomic age, metric standards were recalibrated in accordance with nonanthropo morphic units.3 This intersection between metric reform, on the one hand, and the establishment of a technological system that displaces man as the standard for measurement, on the other, constitutes the historical background for Jiinger's Glass Bees. After this threshold was passed, the "accidents of things," to repeat Alberti's formula, could no longer be known "through comparison to the accidents of man." One could argue that innumerable other texts, from Weber's writings on rationalization to Husserl's Crisis of European Sciences, had already denounced the collusion between instrumental reason, abstract mathematization, and the impov erishment of experience. Like them, Jiinger's text derived the existential dysphoria of modernity from the will to quantify and measure-deterritorializing processes that convert inhab ited space and time into a series of indifferent and purely notional signs of universal equivalency. Symptomatically, the protagonist of Glass Bees carries on his person a book by Flavius Josephus, the ancient historian and author of Jewish Antiquities who claimed that it was no less villainous a figure than Cain Fore The Entomic Age 29</page><page sequence="5">himself, the wicked son of Adam and Eve, who was responsi ble for the invention of weights and measures. Metrification, Jiinger insinuated, had dire consequences for the spiritual and political life of man.4 It was nothing less than a second expul sion from Eden. However, Jiinger does not simply reiterate the familiar laments about cultural deterioration that move, perhaps too rashly, from measurement and rationalization to the loss of social value, relativization, and, ultimately, nihilism. To the contrary, Glass Bees suggests that metrification in and of itself is not baleful. Measurement, strictly speaking, entails nothing more than comparing the magnitudes of two objects using a third as a con stant. This third term constitutes what systems theorist Niklas Luhmann discerningly called the Einheit derDifferenz. Luhmann's equivocal phrase, which can be translated either as the "unit of distinction" or the "unity of the difference," reveals the dual logic of this unit/y: the unit of distinction makes it possible to discriminate between two objects, to tell them apart, at the same time that it also simultaneously insists on their ultimate dialectical unity vis-'a-vis a third object. For Jiinger, the decisive element in any act of measurement is precisely this third object, the unit that mediates the comparison. The Metrics of Glass Bees In the 1950s, when the human dimensions of the older indus trial order were definitively displaced by the atomic scale and the human form ceased to serve as the unit of difference, Glass Bees spelled out, in the direst of terms, the cultural and anthro pological challenges that would attend this process of techni cal recalibration. Part essayistic treatise on technology, part autobiographically inflected narrative, Jiinger's book recounts two days in the life of Richard, a decommissioned officer in the light cavalry who has returned from military service to a tech nical civilization in which the ancient values and precepts of the warrior no longer have purchase. Richard's melancholic response to the loss of the martial code reveals an estrangement that pervades many of the postwar writings of Jiinger, who had served enthusiastically as an officer in the Great War, but then, in the following World War, found himself morally disoriented and ultimately revolted by the abstract calculus of modern technological warfare. His protagonist Richard doesn't take long to realize that he is just as unfit for civilian life in the technical age as he was for combat. This is not because he is incapable of renouncing the habits of the soldier but because he feels ill prepared for a society in which mecha nization has all but completely obliterated the difference between war and peacetime. While the officer expected to secure an ordinary civilian job, he quickly discovers that work 30 r? s5 3</page><page sequence="6">is no longer work, just as war is no longer war. The two have become inextricable. The prophetic scenario envisioned by Jiinger anticipates the media genealogies proposed much later by Paul Virilio and Friedrich Kittler, who situate the origins of contemporary mass media in a variety of warfare technologies.5 In fact, both Kittler and Virilio draw explicitly from Jiunger, who already in his essay "Total Mobilization" (1930) and again in The Worker (1932) had predicted that the military, eco nomic, and technological complexes would become effectively indistinguishable. The setting for the book is a globalized dystopia in which all geographical specificities and phases of historical development converge into a single undifferentiated grey territory. This vague zone does, however, have one distinguishing feature: it is in a state of perpetual civil war. This is the Janus face of technolog ical civilization, in which the race of soldiers has passed and been succeeded by an army of police. In his early Weimar works like Storm of Steel, Jiinger apotheosized the front line as a zone of infinite danger. But the radiant nihilism of Jiinger's interwar texts was clearly tempered by the brutality of the Third Reich, and now, in the 1950s, Jiinger is far less sanguine about a zone of danger that had metastasized into all civilian sectors. In the postwar period, when danger became indistin guishable from disaster, Jiinger waxes nostalgically about a time when the threat was still contained on the front. Confronted with the "risk society" of the postwar era, to bor row the apt phrase of sociologist Ulrich Beck, Jiinger's protag onist Richard, once a noble warrior, becomes a dropout.6 He is a sorry hero indeed: A retired cavalryman cuts a poor figure in the middle of these cities, where the neighing of a horse is no longer heard.... Words had lost their meaning, and even war was no longer war. [Richard's late mentor] would turn in his grave if he could hear what they called war nowadays. After all, peace wasn't peace anymore either. (SW, 15:462)7 Confused and sickened by the new techno-industrial order, the unemployed protagonist refuses integration into its ranks and so becomes instead its casualty, "like a man from a bygone era who has been placed at a traffic intersection" (SW, 15:516). Concerned, however, about his wife Teresa's welfare, Richard agrees to one final job interview, this time for the firm of the entrepreneur Giacomo Zapparoni. One of the numerous allusions in Glass Bees to E.T.A. Hoffmann's fantastic tale The Sandman, the enigmatic Italian Zapparoni is a manufac turer of robots. He specializes in two forms of automata in particular: android actors whose hyperverisimilitude has t hitmCge ~31</page><page sequence="7">revolutionized the entertainment industry and microscale robots that carry out a variety of useful tasks from sorting money to removing pollen from the air. Both species of robot can, Richard notes, be repurposed for more sinister vocations such as surveillance or military deployment. When Richard shows up at the Zapparoni plant dressed in a threadbare suit and with a growling stomach, he is escorted to the inventor's house at the heart of the facility. There he is surprised to find a modest and manifestly low-tech dwelling whose contents, he estimates, predate the middle of the eigh teenth century. What makes the strongest impression on Richard are the distinctly human proportions of the dwelling and its grounds, so in contrast with the industrial sprawl that encircles it. Richard recognizes in Zapparoni's home prod ucts of the earliest forms of metrological instrumentation, taken from the era before the French Revolution, when the dimensions and attributes of objects were compared using hands and outstretched arms, when the carrying distance of a person's voice served as a unit to parse up space. "One sensed the old measurements: the foot, the ell, the inch, the rod" (SW, 15:497). Unlike modern units of measurement whose high degree of abstraction facilitates the comparison of qualitatively hetero geneous substances-take the meter, which can be used to mea sure both the depth of a well and the thickness of an electrical filament-primitive metrics do not engage these utterly arbitrary, even quasi-metaphysical units. Jiunger once noted in a diary entry that the fathom, the brace, a stone's throw, and an hour's walk are all "magnitudes of a natural variety"; as a result, they are "perceptually intuitive" (anschaulich) in a way that the centimeter, kilometer, and kilogram are not (SW, 3:379). The earliest conventions of measurement, such as yards, feet, inches, fingers, and nails are all by nature intuitive because they are anthropomorphic, derived from the limbs of the human body and intimately bound to the contexts of daily existence. Such units of measurement triangulate all of worldly spatial exten sion through the body, translating, in effect, every object into a scaled portrait of the human figure. In anthropometric systems of measure, the body serves as the Einheit der Differenz, to repeat Luhmann's term: at the same time that it posits the human body as a term of distinction between two objects, it also covers over the incommensurability of the objects by humaniz ing them. What is more, this act of portrayal extends beyond our static limbs to encompass our labor capacities as well. Many of the oldest units of agrarian measure, for example, correspond to the area of land that can be tilled in a single day (e.g., the German Morgenland, the Russian obzha, the French arpent, and the Italian giornata). Spatial divisions such as these 32 iy 9;. :+</page><page sequence="8">are, then, condensed figurations of labor processes. For this reason Witold Kula, a Polish economic historian, has charac terized these older units of measure as "representational."8 Mensuration, his analysis would suggest, is not only a method of quantification; it is an act of depiction. If every measurement is also a tacit depiction, then knowing what these metrics depict is critical. Indeed, their referents may be surprising. After a few minutes outside of Zapparoni's house, Richard begins to suspect that the harmonious propor tions of this preindustrial artifact are only dissimulated and that this antediluvian paradise is in fact infested with machinery. Only gradually, almost nachtrdglich, does he become aware of the eponymous glass bees, tiny robots that are gliding about gathering honey. That he did not notice them earlier strikes him as strange. After observing the mechanical bees through a mysterious pair of field glasses conveniently found nearby another citation of The Sandman-Richard speculates that the bees had slipped unnoticed below the threshold of his con sciousness not because of their tiny size but because he lacked any frame of reference for the scale of these machines. After inspecting the robots more closely, Richard estimates, against his initial evaluation, that they are in fact notably larger than actual honeybees. "Judging their relative size was difficult because the objects in question were outside of the realm of experience and had no corresponding norm in consciousness. Without experience there can be no measure" (SW, 15:517). The minis cule machines perplex the naked eye because they do not refer to anything from the realm of everyday experience. Richard likens these robots to bees, but even that analogy, he admits, is a poor approximation. Cognitively speaking, they "represent" nothing-at least nothing that is known, familiar, or human. For millennia the human body had served as the basis not just for units of measurement but also for the technological forms that were constructed in accordance with these units. Even when it was not explicitly endowed with a human countenance (as was the case in many famous eighteenth-century examples, from the writing boy of Jaquet-Droz to von Kempelen's Turkish chess player), the machine had nonetheless been modeled on the human body since the first flushes of industrialization. In his 1877 Outline for a Philosophy of Technology Ernst Kapp had characterized technical invention as a method of "organ projection" (Organprojektion) through which human cultures construct for themselves the limbs and instruments that their members lack at birth but require for survival. Conceived in the throes of the second Industrial Revolution, this definition of technology insisted that tools and machines were in essence supplements to natural human organs. Jiinger characterized this generation of machine as "prostheses that imitate limbs II egno? g 33</page><page sequence="9">and that replace, refine and multiply their functions. The ham- Hook, Ring- and Pincer-Grip. mer is a fist; the shovel is a hand that digs; the mill that pulver- Published in Fritz Giese, izes grain assumes the labor of the teeth" (SW, 8:500). Such PsychologiederArbeitshand, machines were conceived in the image of their masters. This belief in "the 'humanity' of the machine," to borrow a phrase from Heinrich Hauser's 1928 book Interaction with Machines, underwent a dramatic-and final-surge in the Weimar period.9 An illustration from Fritz Giese's Psychologie der Arbeitshand, published the same year as Hauser's book, pith ily summarized this conception of tools as representations, extensions, and amplifications of their operator's limbs. From the photographs of Albert Renger-Patzsch, who endowed factory machines with human features, to the film criticism of Bela Balazs, who discovered the physiognomy of the mass produced commodity, the ethos of communion between man and machine in the 1920s represented the climax and conclu sion of a technological order that for centuries had taken the human form as its basis. Zapparoni's robotic bees mark the definitive break with the anthropomorphic norm that had dominated throughout the industrial age. While our mental images of spatial extension were once mediated by feet and fathoms, while our hammers and pliers were once modeled after operations performed by our own limbs-and bore accordingly the indelible, if only imaginary, imprint of the human form-in a world of glass bees the cognitive relationship we have to the world, and even to our own bodies, is triangulated through devices that are decidedly not human. This new technological wave observes the logic not of Kapp's "organ projection" but of Ernst Bloch's "de-organization" (Entorganisierung).10 With this term Bloch 34 Grey Room 33</page><page sequence="10">denoted not a movement toward chaos, not disorganization, but a tendency discernible in those new technologies whose components have no prototypes in the anatomy and organs of the human body. Thus a second technological visitation occurs at the Zapparoni plant, a vision more lysergic, and far more gruesome, than the glass bees. Richard notices-again, only gradually-that the pond next to the house is sown with bright red objects. They are severed ears. A grim sign of the times, the aristocratic warrior speculates, but one that is ultimately all too predictable. The depot of dismembered human parts on display before him is a fitting complement to posthuman, de-organized technologies such as glass bees. The brutal display of the severed limbs had stunned me. But it was an inevitable motif in this context. Didn't it perforce go hand in hand with technical perfection and with the intoxication that this perfection brought to an end? Has there ever been at any period in the history of the world so many dismembered bodies, so many detached limbs, as in ours? For time immemorial mankind has waged wars, but I can't recall a single instance in the entire Iliad when the loss of an arm or a leg is reported. (SW, 15:520-521; emphasis in original) If the pathologically armored bodies of Jiinger's Weimar writings revealed their author's anxiety about the fragility of the human body in the face of modern warfare, in postwar works such as The Glass Bees it is technoscientific progress and invention rather than weaponry that threaten to violate the organic soundness of the human frame and obviate the neo classical aesthetic that Juinger associates with antiquity and texts like The Iliad."1 In Glass Bees, the de-organization of tech nology produces the de-organization of the body: "We sense an attack on our bodily integrity, on our proportions. That our arms and legs are in jeopardy is not yet the greatest danger" (SW, 15:521). The worst is yet to come. For the anatomization and dismemberment of the body is but the prelude to its final state when it is converted into a purely notional quantity. Just as all that remains of the horse in the contemporary metropolis is a value abstraction quaintly termed "horsepower," human beings, too, will soon disappear, replaced by apparitions that bear their name but not their likeness. The techno-entrepreneurial spirit "wanted to calculate using manpower just as it had already long been calculating using horsepower. It wanted units that were equivalent and divisible. To achieve this, man would have to be eliminated just as the horse had been eliminated before him" (SW, 15:547). The contrast that Juinger posits between classical antiquity ar; g-vXen~Omagew 35</page><page sequence="11">and our own time underscores a critical distinction between the technological thought of the Greeks and that of the contem porary world. These two historical epochs mark the most extreme points of antithesis between anthropomorphic and nonanthropomorphic technological paradigms. Georg Lukaics, for example, suggested that the primitiveness of Greek science and engineering reflected an economy that was based exclu sively upon slave labor. The autonomization of machinery through scientific rationalization and invention was unthink able in a society whose forces of production always had a human face.12 In "Some Remarks on the Forms and Limitations of Technological Thought among the Greeks," Pierre Vernant advanced a similar argument, albeit without the Marxist frame work. Vernant argued that for the Greeks technology always operated on analogy with man's natural organs. The tech nological "organon transmits and amplifies man's force rather than acting by virtue of its own internal structure and producing an effect through a mechanism of a type different from human exertion."13 Like Lukacs, Vernant suggested that this mentality ultimately prevented the Greeks from becoming technical innovators. Hence, both note, the vast discrepancy between the astounding achievements of Greek philosophical thought and the poverty of their technical instrumentarium. This belief in the inalienably human origin of force and energy explains the centrality of the concept of causality for Greek scientific thought, since it was causality that allowed them to establish a fundamental distinction between mankind and artifact. Aristotle argued in Physics, for example, that nat ural beings have within themselves an immanent source of change and action, while such "self-causality" is alien to tech nical (i.e., artificial) forms. In contrast to natural beings, whom the ancients considered to be autotelic, technology had a cause that was external to it. Technical forms were necessarily instru mental or utilitarian. This division would again be rehearsed in the distinction drawn much later between organic and inorganic bodies, between biology and mechanics. For the Greeks, the cause, or motive principle, of a technical mecha nism was always to be found in the natural force of the human operator whom it served as an instrument, and machines that had their own source of energy were considered not techne, but thaumata, quasi-occult objects of marvel and wonder.14 Even in the philosophical discourse of antiquity technology was anthropic by nature, derived from and dependent upon the human.15 At the other end of this arc are Zapparoni's automata (auto maton = "acting of itself"), which have inverted the determina tive relationship between the human and the artifact. Mortal bodies no longer serve as the prototypes or kinetic agents for 36 &gt; ?)u^'</page><page sequence="12">constructions that effortlessly surpass humanity. These avatars do not copy or resemble their masters. To the contrary, they are easily distinguished from their human counterparts by a degree of perfection that is fundamentally inhuman: their faces were more brilliant, more flawless; their eyes of a larger cut, like precious stones; their movements slower, more graceful and, when excited, also more violent and faster than anything we have experienced.... these fig ures did not simply imitate the human form; they took it beyond its potentials and its scale. (SW, 15:511) And although this autarkic generation of androids does not imitate the human, it has nonetheless kindled the converse mimetic ambition in its creator. These robots possess a mien that "became the model for human actors who adapted them selves to it" (SW, 15:448-449). In Junger's book technological artifice has advanced to the point where the distinction between first and second nature no longer obtains. Here the baroque logic of the simulacrum takes over and man is remade in the image of his creation, as Benjamin predicted in The Origin of the German Tragic Drama: where art so firmly occupies the centre of existence as to make man one of its manifestations instead of recogniz ing him above all as its basis, to see man's existence as the eternal subjects of its own creations instead of recognizing him as its own creator, then all sane reflection is at an end. And whether, with the removal of man from the centre of art, it is Nirvana, the slumbering will to life, which takes his place, as in Schopenhauer, or whether it is the "dissonance become man" [Menschwerdung der Dissonanz] which, as in Nietzsche, has created both the manifestations of the human world and man himself, it makes no difference; it is the same pragmatism.16 Lacking the natural harmony of the human form, Zapparoni's android is precisely this "hominization of dissonance" (the translation of die Menschwerdung der Dissonanz not in the biblical idiom of incarnation but in the lexicon of Marxism and evolutionary biology). If, among the Greeks, cause and force were always immanent to the human whose pneuma quickened the mechanical construction, now the construction animates man and, in the process, reformats him according to nonanthropometric scales. Such technology, Richard notes, "gave a new measure to man" (SW, 15:543). This pseudo morph rejects the balanced and symmetrical proportions of natural man and makes the latter instead into the subject of its own creation. With the "hominization of dissonance" comes the "dissonation of man." In other words, the "accidents S .}f | T2 .. ii .gXos ge 3 7</page><page sequence="13">of things," to cite Alberti again, once again reclaim the "acci dents of man." Entomic Prototypes Like many texts of the 1950s, Glass Bees bears the impress of the atomic age. Popular discourse in Germany and elsewhere was dominated at the time by anxieties about the bomb and the threat of the eradication of life on earth. It was unclear whether mankind and long-established notions of the human would survive even if the human race could avert physical annihilation. In innumerable texts, from Gunther Anders's Die Antiquiertheit des Menschen (1956) to Karl Jaspers's Die Atombombe und die Zukunft des Menschen (1958), public intellectuals in Germany voiced their disquiet about technologies that rendered human ity and its scale obsolete. The "radiation industry," to quote a passage from Bloch, "would perfect the de-organization of technology, of technology which is no longer Euclidean, to the remotest extent: it would jut out of our mesocosmic world into one that that is immeasurably different, not just into one that is subatomic, but also one that is macrocosmic."17 Much like Glass Bees, Bloch's lament about the loss of the mesocosmic reflects a prevaling concern about changing standards of mea surement and scale. The composition of these texts coincided with the most extensive reform of the metric system since its establishment in 1791 after the French Revolution. Juinger wrote Glass Bees at the moment when time and space, the long-standing Kantian a priori absolutes of experience, lost their intuitive foundations in quotidian existence and began instead to be regulated by units of measure established on the invisible scale of atomic phenomena. For example, with the invention of the first atomic clock in 1949 the passage of time no longer reflected the movement of the earth around the sun and the alternation of day and night but came to be determined instead by rates of atomic decay. Spatial extension was likewise deprived of its earthly referent in 1960, when the prototype meter in Sevres, France, which had been defined in 1791 as a portion of the circumference of the earth, was abandoned and replaced by the most abstract of formulae (1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in a vacuum). Before these changes, human beings had by constitution been earth-bound creatures whose perceptions were grounded in the regular movements and finite dimensions of their planet, a natural, knowable object that formed the horizon of all human existence.18 The earth, Hannah Arendt wrote in 1958, is "the very quintes sence of the human condition."19 But, she continued, the launch into space one year earlier of the first earth-born object, 3 8 s +&lt; Uc&gt;, ,O</page><page sequence="14">Sputnik, had shaken at their very core humanity's phenome nological categories, which were rooted in a telluric frame of reference. One of the most significant scientific developments at this moment was the emergence of the nanoscale. After the iron megamachinery of the industrial age, science and engineering now turned to inner space and microscopic metrics. The advent of nanoscience is customarily dated to December 29, 1959, when the physicist Richard Feynman delivered a talk entitled "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom."20 In this pre sentation, Feynman envisioned a host of tiny, self-replicating robots manipulating matter at the atomic scale. He also announced two Feynman Prizes, one that would be awarded for constructing the first 1/64-inch electric motor and another to be given to the first person who could shrink the text on a stan dard page of paper to 1/25,000 of its original size. Epochal as Feynman's talk may have been, however, it should not be con sidered the definitive terminus post quem of nanotechnology. As commentators have not failed to point out, Feynman's talk was a synthesis of ideas and hypotheses that were in circula tion in the popular imaginary long before 1959, and key fea tures of Feynman's predictions can be traced to sources in the science fiction literature of the previous decade. Although an English translation of Glass Bees did not appear until 1960, and thus Jiunger's text cannot be considered as one of the pos sible sources for Feynman's talk, the two visions clearly share a common inspiration. For Jiunger's science fiction novel about a world infested with micromachinery, Feynman's nanotech nology delivered the science to suit the fiction.21 Whether or not the contemporary observer cares to entertain these ques tions of determination and influence, she will nonetheless recognize in Jiinger's novel about a zone in which "molecules were being controlled" (SW, 15:541) multiple prefigurations of topics that dominate current debates about nanotechnology: nanoscience as a space of infinite danger;22 uncertainty about our ability to maintain control over self-replicating "lilliputian robots" (SW, 15:426);23 the replacement of tradi tional scientific methods by what Bruno Latour has called "technoscience";24 the inversion of the causal distinction between representing and intervening;25 the reduction of the human body to a construction site or a collections of parts;26 and, concomitant with this violation of the body's holistic integrity, declarations about the obsolescence of the human tout court.27 One glaring convergence between Jiinger and contemporary nanoscientists is their shared preoccupation with the volatil ity, on the scale of single atoms, of the boundary between the natural and the artificial.28 Animal cells, the building blocks F .}t | Th AO g ttA &gt;ni 4 g . 39</page><page sequence="15">of organic life, are already hundreds of times larger than the objects that are addressed by nanoscience.29 As a consequence, the laws of biology and mechanics, which emerged from the distinction between life and technology, here enjoy parity. The division that Aristotle established between the autotelic human being and its instrument, between natural life and fabricated artifact, has no purchase when operating with individual molecules. As nanotech guru Eric Drexler has concluded, the organization of matter at the level of individual molecules causes "the distinction between hardware and life ... to blur." Nanologic is ultimately, one scholar proposes, "a cyborg logic, imploding the separation between the biological and the tech nological, the body and the machine."30 If the conventional distinction between life and death atten uates with physical diminution, it becomes clear why, for Jiinger, the harbinger of the new technological order would assume the form of a mechanical bee. It is hardly necessary to go all the way down to the nanoscale to observe the intimate embrace between the organic and the inorganic because the line separating life from death begins to blur already at the level of insect exis tence. Long ago, the insect's extraordinary status as dead and yet animate prompted Descartes to call insects "natural automata."31 Precisely the same ambiguousness motivated Roger Caillois's fascination with insects in the autobiography that he penned at the age of twenty and in his earliest essays on the praying mantis and psychasthenia. Jiinger evidently learned much from his acquaintance and fellow "entomophile" Caillois.32 A direct citation of Caillois's writings from the 1930s, Jiinger's memoir Subtle Hunts (1967) celebrated insects as "ideograms" that reveal the porosity of the boundary between the living and the mineral. In this text, the hard chitinous exoskeleton of the insect occasions the author's meditations on the transitions where life (Jiinger favors the Greek word bios) both absorbs and is itself absorbed by inorganic matter. "Bones and teeth, shells and armor, stingers and pincers" all testify to dead mat ter's service to the living: "There is no such thing as 'dead' rock. ... Chalk is situated on the border between the two domains that we divide into life and death. It is often difficult to distin guish stone from flesh; stone appears to blossom in the coral reefs" (SW, 10:218). Like Subtle Hunts, Glass Bees revived the trope of the "organic construction" (organische Konstruktion) familiar from Jiinger's Weimar text The Worker. But the existential stakes and psychological repercussions of this figure are entirely different in the postwar text. Whereas Jiinger celebrated the organic construction in 1932 as the vehicle for a vitalistic subordination of matter to the human will, in Glass Bees the organic construction triggers epistemological uncertainty, 40 X. ;z c</page><page sequence="16">Carabus saphyrinus juengeri. paranoia, and insanity. Where the distinction between living man and inorganic artifact is lost, Benjamin wrote, "all sane reflection is at an end." Hoffmann's Sandman surfaces again here, this time in the uncanniness of the automata and the derangement of those who encounter them. The narrator Richard recalls, for example, an anecdote about a desperate young man who jumped to his death after having fallen in love with an automaton that was incapable of requiting his feelings. Little wonder, too, that Caretti, the man who previously held the job for which Richard is applying, disappeared forever after having been driven mad from hallucinations that left him unable to distinguish between natural entities and phantasmata. Jiinger's hypothesis that the first stirring of the future science would manifest itself in a species of mechanical bees was hardly idle speculation. Jiinger was in fact an authority on insects. A trained entomologist who, having studied zoology for several years in Leipzig after the First World War, continued working informally as a naturalist throughout his life, Jiinger had, by the time of his death at the age of 102, conferred his name in the Linnaean taxonomy to several shellfish and butterflies, a single celled organism, and no fewer than six beetles, including a sub species of tiger beetle. He even felt that his achievements as a naturalist would confer him more posthumous glory than his lit erary works.33 Given his qualifications and achievements as an internationally recognized entomologist, Jiinger's prediction that the atomic age will be an entomic one must be heeded as a real and concrete scientific claim. A product of his profound familiarity with the mechanical principles that underlie insect anatomy, the filiations that Jiinger discerned between nanostructures and insect form reflected the knowledge that both observe the same structural laws of scaling. Such laws dictate that the relationships among the components of an organized system, whether Fore j The Enlemorc AgeA 41</page><page sequence="17">biological or inorganic, must be modified with changes of magnitude. For designers of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), this means that the laws of Newtonian-scale physics that govern mesoscopic masses such as the human body become less relevant as machines approach the size of indi vidual molecules. As a consequence the mechanical compo nents developed in the industrial age on analogy with the muscular and circulatory systems of larger vertebrates conveyer belts, piping, gear drives, derrick cranes, and so on-must be replaced on the smaller scale by quantum mech anisms that are engineered in accordance with different struc tural principles. At this magnitude the tectonics of the insect body offer a per suasive and practicable template. Jiinger was not alone in this insight: long before the nanotech revolution, the evolutionary biologist J.S. Haldane had explained in an elegant essay from 1927 entitled "On Being the Right Size" that two fundamental principles govern downward scaling: as objects become smaller, gravity becomes less important; at the same time, surface tension-the result of van der Waals cohesion between mole cules-increases in significance.34 To a spider, being dropped down a thousand-yard mine shaft would be of little conse quence, but for a person such a turn of events would be fatal. Conversely, a healthy human being has no trouble lifting him self from the bathtub; a fly, once it has broken the surface of a body of water, is in most cases doomed. A specialist in biome try, Haldane understood that organized systems cannot simply be transposed from one scale to another without affecting their functionality and viability. Tellingly, insects served already in 1927 as paradigmatic illustrations of these laws of scaling. Haldane's observations about gravity and surface tension have subsequently been recognized as the two most important laws that account for differences in the performances of meso and nanophenomena. Based upon these principles of scaling, recent research has concluded that nanomachines cannot sim ply be designed as downsized versions of mesoscopic artifacts but must instead originate as "bottom-up" technologies. Hence the unsoundness of the proposal to shrink human instruments to microscopic dimensions.35 Instead the anatomy of the insect today informs the "bottom-up" design of MEMS that, like the insect body, convey materials by means of liquid circuits instead of closed circulatory systems. The architecture of the insect hemocoel, or body cavity, provides a compelling blueprint for the construction of microfluidic devices. This is because the transportation of blood within an arthropod's fluid-filled hemo coel is chiefly actuated by means of percolation, diffusion, and van der Waals cohesion rather than by pump circulation through discrete blood vessels. Unlike the vertebrate anatomy that 42 e -</page><page sequence="18">r fd The nervous and open circulatory serves as the model for conventional machinery, the internal systems of Apis mellifUTiFtC. Publisheds Apin HermanWebe cavity of the insect is not threaded with tubes and pumps that Lehrbuchder Entomologi,W1933. regulate blood flow to the individual parts of the body. Instead the insect's organs float in a tank of fluid hemolymph. On the microscale, the closed circulatory systems that vertebrates use to transport blood long distances would be not just superfluous but actually unviable. Bioengineers have consequently con cluded that optimal MEMS should utilize the same principles to distribute materials as those used in the insect body.36 While the laws of scaling that govern both the physiology of insects and the architecture of MEMS may explain why Juinger would confer an entomic aspect to atomic-age technology, this does not yet answer why, in 1957, Junger would select a mechanical honeybee, in particular, as the herald of this future science. The answer to that question can be found in the hon eybee's newfound status in the 1950s as a natural prototype for the modern microprocessor. Since Hesiod and Aristotle the honeybee hive had served poets and philosophers as an emblem of civic organization and political order,37 but in the 1950Os extensive scientific research into the social life and swarm intelligence of the bee added new dimensions to its ancient metaphorical value. With the explosion of interest in the com municative capacities of the bee, Apis mellifera was trans formed from a paradigm of civic virtue to an exemplary number cruncher and information processor. Leading this development was Karl von Frisch, the German zoologist who declared in a 1956 article that "the language of the bees is on a higher level than the means of communication among birds and mammals with the exception of man."38 Substantiated by decades of research on the dances that are used by bees to transmit infor mation about the location of food sources, von Frisch's research became by the end of the 1940s one of the most sensational dis coveries of entomology and cognitive ethology. A three-month lecture tour through the United States in 1949 and the publication For. i The EntoTic Age 43</page><page sequence="19">of the lectures the following year as Bees: Their Vision, Chemical Senses, and Language secured within the scientific community the fame of .-. d von Frisch's theories about bee language.39 ... In Bees, von Frisch demonstrated that forager bees can kinesthetically transmit information about the location of food sources to their hive mates through a series of dancelike movements. Behaving much like pointer dogs, foragers a orient themselves on the honeycomb toward b the food source and perform a "dance" into which are encoded variables that indicate the relative distance of the food source, up to 1250 meters, from the hive. Statistical analysis of the accuracy of bee language suggested that bee comprehension "may not compare unfavorably with the performance of human beings when given complicated instructions." In fact, directions given by bees The waggle dance. Published in to their hive mates were notably more accurate, for example, Karl von Frisch, Aus dem Leben than human phrases such as "northeast by east."40 Differentiations der Bienen, 1948. within bee language turned out to be so sophisticated that researchers also came across dialectal distinctions between various bee species. Expanding upon von Frisch's experiments, his student Martin Lindauer discovered that bees use a version of the "dance" to reach a consensus about the location of a future hive: presented with a number of possible choices for sites, the swarm intelligence of the hive arrives at a collective decision using the dance-system in a manner comparable to human voting. Haldane, author of "On Being the Right Size" and former member of the Communist Party, had himself con ducted experiments on bee language and concluded that the discovery of this democratic process among bees was more sig nificant to the history of human politics than even Rousseau's Social Contract.41 Interest in honeybee language was hardly limited to etho logical circles. Linguists, too, were fascinated by what was widely regarded to be "the most significant example of versatile com munication known in any animals other than our species."42 In a 1952 essay discussing von Frisch's work, the structural linguist EJmile Benveniste marveled at the discovery of highly complex language among insects, animals hardly considered to hold a notable rank on the evolutionary chain. Honeybee language belied the assumption that animals are incapable of conventional communication on the order of human speech. According to Benveniste, the only qualitative distinction between human and honeybee language is that the latter knows no second order of transmission; in other words, the message cannot be reproduced by another bee that has not already seen 44 Grey Room 33</page><page sequence="20">for itself what is being announced (e.g., the location of the food source).43 Benveniste consequently reasoned that bees com municate using signals rather than abstract symbols. Their lan guage was, he concluded, bodily and contagious, not cognitive and conventional. But others who were inclined to more behaviorist (and less Saussurian and dualist) models of communication would not recognize even this nominal distinction between human and honeybee language.44 In a 1963 review of the work of von Frisch and Lindauer, the semiotician Thomas Sebeok argued that hon eybee language offered evidence to support Roman Jakobson's case for the existence of a panchronic linguistic system that was composed of universal distinctive features.45 Citing Jakobson's observations about "the direct homology between the logic of molecular and phonemic codes," Sebeok saw honeybee com munication as confirmation of a unified and all-embracing theory of language.46 Ahead of the genome-mapping projects of the 1990s, bee communication became proof that informational codes were common to all forms of animate being and at all levels within these beings from the cellular to the systemic. Jakobson claimed that certain linguistic structures could be discerned at the molecular level even in inorganic entities. Surveilling Apis mellifera, scientists in the 1950s thus over heard the cosmic language of all creation. Behind the curtain of silence that enveloped mute matter, von Frisch had caught a glimpse of a natural world teeming with signals and messages. Sebeok likened the student of animal communication to a "cryptologist" who deciphers the myriad flows of information pulsing through nature.47 The apparent discovery of a tran scendental language that encompassed all phenomena from biological genetics to molecular structures and abstract human logic gave new actuality to the romantic aspiration to decipher the universal Book of Nature. In the 1950s this romantic science went by the name of cybernetics, and the bee, a tiny modulator of informational flows, was given the office of nature's archetypal microprocessor. With direct reference to Shannon and Weaver's 1949 Mathematical Theory of Communication, Haldane and the geneticist Helen Spurway proposed that communication between bees provided the "perfect example" of "ethological cybernetics" ("SA," 254). The symbolic language of these tiny microprocessors, they wrote, is like that of an analogical calculator such as a slide rule or a speedometer, which represents one continuously variable magnitude by another. The human symbolism is like that of a digital computer such as an ordinary calcu lating machine or a mileometer, which represents it by one of a discrete series of symbols. ("SA," 263) S t&gt;ye ggo aoBE n T h g8 y4g 4 5</page><page sequence="21">6 7 8 0 12 28 1c31 599 Haldane and Spurway were not the only scientists to regard bee communication through the optic of cybernetics. Referring to von Frisch's research, the linguist Charles Hockett suggested in 1959 that the bee could be profitably compared to an analog computer. Although, he added, this analogy also accurately reflected the limitations of analog systems: "An analog com puter is often beautifully adapted for a narrow function and worthless for anything else. Just so, bees can talk about nectar and hive-sites; humans can talk about anything."48 As an enthusiastic entomologist, Jiinger could scarcely have been unaware of such momentous developments within the discipline that was his lifelong passion. Given the insect's sta tus, already in the 1920s, as an object lesson in those principles of mathematical scaling that would subsequently become fundamental criteria informing the design of MEMS and nan otechnologies and given, three decades later, the explosion of research into honeybee language that established the bee as an exemplary microcomputer, it cannot be surprising that future science takes on the likeness of the glass bee in Jiinger's 1957 novel. Indeed, bees figure prominently in a number of Junger's postwar meditations on technology. He discerned that this insect, both in its architecture and in its capacity as an infor mation processor, was a model machine for the atomic age. But the insect's displacement of the human as the paradig matic technical form of the era had drastic implications. The philosophical emblem at the core of Juinger's science fiction novel Heliopolis (1949) illustrates his prognosis: in a scene among apiaries, the narrator and a beekeeper contemplate the lessons that humanity can learn from bees (not vice versa), and conclude that these creatures will force us to revise "the old adage that man is the measure of all things" (SW, 15:208). In Glass Bees, the final consequence of the new metric order is the disarticulation of the human form into a combinatory scheme of discrete objects, an assemblage of isolated parts. Upon the glass bees follows a depot of spare organs. When insects become the measure of all things, the fate of the human 46 Grey Room 33</page><page sequence="22">Opposite: Von Frisch's code is clear: it was inscribed long ago at the etymological origin of for identifying bees.

Published in Karl von many detached limbs, as in ours?" Frisch, 7he Dance Language and For Junger, the startling otherness of the insect world was Orientation of Bees, 1967. compounded by its perceptual virtuality. Its unfamiliar scale, over which presides a set of physical laws alien to vertebrate experience, constitutes a zone that can be accessed only indi rectly with the aid of mediating technologies like microscopes. Because the insect world is all but invisible to the unenhanced eye, it becomes inextricable from the mechanical contrivances that render it perceivable. This is why Jiinger's entomological memoir, Subtle Hunts, commences with young Ernst acquiring the hardware that grants entry into the realm of insects. (The book's first line: "The hunt could begin: Father had given us the equipment for Christmas" [SW, 10:11].) In Glass Bees, Richard similarly requires a pair of field glasses to observe Zapparoni's glass bees. Here Junger dwells on the unease that proliferates in the interval separating spontaneous human vision from vision that is mediated through equipment. The variance between the two has existential implications: in the former we perceive an object, while in the latter we encounter only its representation. Zapparoni's field glasses bring the glass bees optically closer at the same time that they render the bees onti cally more remote. Along similar lines, Lukacs had suggested that optical instru ments can be distinguished by the degree to which they either observe or transgress the parameters of experience that are established in quotidian human existence. "Glasses do not deanthropomorphize," he explained, "while the telescope and the microscope do, since the former just distorts the normal For. i The Entomzic Age 47</page><page sequence="23">relations within the everyday life of the whole person, while the latter reveals a world that is inaccessible to the human senses."49 Telescopes and microscopes-portals to the macro and microcosm-do not belong to the perceptual organon native to our species. Such devices are inhuman, Lukaics suggests: they "deanthropomorphize." It is not just the microtechnolo gies themselves that institute alien proportions, but the very instruments of visualization that make these forms perceptible. Richard's speculations about the widening discrepancy between spontaneous human experience and the scale of the new technologies anticipate current concerns about the dubi ous phenomenological status of nanoentities.50 Zapparoni's universe of micromechanisms, Richard notes, "was just on this side of pure fantasy" (SW, 15:428). Because our natural organs do not have access to this world, bodies on the nanoscale have no sensual quiddity independent of their visualization through mediating machines: they exist only as representations, as phantoms. Take the SEM image of the gear chain and the spider mite: unlike photography or optical microscopy, the SEM does not actually "see" the specimen but instead uses a stylus to determine its surface contours without touching it and then translates the resulting information into an image that is legi ble to our senses. The same data that was used in this case to generate a three-dimensional image of the mite could just as easily be rendered in a series of numbers, a graph, or a value map. More like a fax machine than an optical camera, the SEM scans its sample in a raster pattern rather than capturing its likeness.51 The SEM image is a highly mediated articulation of preestablished systems of discourse, cultural conventions, and objectivated knowledge and ideology. As one scholar notes, "[a]esthetic factors (e.g., picture style and quality), epistemo logical factors (e.g., picture interpretation and artifact identifi cation), and social factors (e.g., collective decisions on goals and standard practices) all play roles in determining the mean ing of an electron microscope picture."52 In the end, the nanoscale remains a realm of quasi-objects, of phenomena that occupy an ambiguous zone between natural fact, technological fabrication, and psychological transference. Figurality thus becomes an occupational ineluctability for those dealing with phenomena that are accessible only through "deanthropomor phizing" technologies such as the SEM. As the quantum physi cist Niels Bohr once said, on the nanoscale, "We are suspended in language."53 In Glass Bees, this purely speculative realm with seemingly no reference to natural experience or familiar scales constantly threatens to devolve into solipsism and derangement. "Without experience there is no measure," Richard notes as he surveys the bees through Zapparoni's field glasses. The insect's usurpation of man as the measure of all things is, how 4 8 ;' i ,,,,h..,- .: .</page><page sequence="24">ever, a future that Jiunger's protagonist will refuse. Defying the mind that "negates the free, unspoiled human figure" (SW, 15:547), Richard insists that the human body must remain an indivisible and holistic gestalt. At the end of the book Zapparoni refuses to give the job to Richard, who is himself in resigned agreement that he is too old-fashioned for the new technolo gies. The last person to hold the position went insane, after all, and Richard has no desire to suffer the same fate. Jiunger nonetheless reserves a happy end for Richard, to whom Zapparoni offers a different job as an arbitrator of disputes among his employees. This line of work should pose signifi cantly fewer ethical and psychological challenges to Richard, who has by now demonstrated that he is far more suited for the world of people than that of technical invention. After receiv ing an advance from Zapparoni, Richard's final deed in the book, conspicuous in its bathos, is an act of consumer therapy that puts everything back in its place. This act reestablishes, if only temporarily, both the centrality of human relations as well as the anthropometric standards that are the cornerstone of Richard's world picture: "I ... purchased for Theresa a lovely summer dress with red stripes that reminded me of the one she had on when I first encountered her. It fit her like a glove; I knew her measure precisely" (SW, 15:554-555). Ore 0he n68Jtt Age 49</page><page sequence="25">Notes 1. Leon Battista Alberti, On Painting, trans. John R.

For this reason, no matter how elaborate and monstrous were the dimensions that they acquired, the machines of the nineteenth century remained essentially mere amplifiers of forces that reside in the human body. 16.

The objectivity of nanotechnology has conse quently been impugned by claims that it borrows too heavily from science fiction literature. Colin Milburn, for example, offers a conceptual genealogy of nanoscience that traces the field's roots to science fiction and argues that nanotechnology owes to literary fiction not just the general vision of an atomic science but its actual models and means of implementation. For Milburn, the origins of nanoscience suggest that it may be something other than science.

This genealogy is correct, but the entanglement of fiction and science hardly disqualifies the latter's truth claims or legitimacy in the way that authors such as Milburn imply. There are no steadfast differences between invention and discovery, and science's increasing reliance on the simulation as a means of validation?a procedure that is at the center of nanoscience's experimental practices?establishes even more incontrovert ibly that imagination and science are no longer distinguishable.

In his book Engines of Creation (Garden City: Doubleday, 1986), Eric Drexler describes a possible apocalyptic scenario in which self-replicating nanobots consume all of the matter on the planet, both living and inorganic, and transform it into undifferentiated "gray goo." A recent appearance of the "gray goo" scenario in contemporary popular culture is Michael Crichton's Prey (New York: HarperCollins, 2002). 24.

Elaborating on Joy's article, Alfred Nordmann notes that, on the nanoregister, "we find ourselves confronted, in a perfectly classical manner, with the micro- and the macrocosm. But here arise a question and a problem. In clas sical cosmology it was man who mediated between macro- and microcosm. But man does not even appear in the picture [of nanotechnology]."

Haldane stressed the importance of "the analogy between living organisms and atoms, in view of the discoveries as to atomic structure and function revealed by quantum mechanics, which [I] regarded, with some justification, as a pene tration of biological ideas into physics."

Lloyd (Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Co., 1963), 103. 29. Because the laws of chemistry, mechanical engineering, biomedicine, computer science, informatics, and physics are all equally binding at the atomic scale, nanoscience has positioned itself as a superdiscipline that unites all traditional scientific fields.

But his work did not go uncontested: by the end of the 1960s, von Frisch's sensational claims had given rise to an energetic debate that the biologist Demorest Davenport deemed "one of the few non sterile controversies in the study of animal behavior." Davenport is cited in Tania Munz's study "Of Birds and Bees: Karl von Frisch, Konrad Lorenz and the Science of Animals, 1908-1973" (Ph.D. diss., Princeton University, 2007), 176.

Spurway, "A Statistical Analysis of Communication in 'Apis mellifera' and a Comparison with Communication in Other Animals," Insectes sociaux 1, no. 3 (1954): 255; hereinafter abbreviated as "SA." Haldane and Spurway also write that "we shall perhaps not be very far out if we suggest that a dance gives about 5 units of information as to direction, 4 to 5 as regards distance, and 2 to 3 as regards number of workers needed, the total being about 12 units, besides the information given non-symboli cally by the odour. A human language in which about 4,000 phrases, but no more, were possible, along with demonstrations of objects found, would give the same amount of information, if combined with demonstrations of objects. Such a language would require much less than 100 words, and a code of all possible combinations of 3 letters would more than cover it. A human lan guage differs from bee communication in that the different phrases are sharply separable, whereas bee dances grade into one another" (256). 41. J.B.S.

Joseph Vogl has similarly argued that "[t]he tele scope is not just an extension of the senses, one whose usefulness would ultimately lie in the 'advantages of the instrument ... on land or at sea.' Rather, the telescope creates the senses anew: it defines the meaning of vision and sensory perception, turning any and all visible facts into constructed and calculated data. Ultimately, all the phenomena and 'messages' it produces bear the mark of theory." Joseph Vogl, "Becoming-Media: Galileo's Telescope," Grey Room 29 (Winter 2008): 17. Vogl's description of the telescope as a device for theorizing?for turning "visible facts" into "constructed and calculated data"?speaks to the instrument's dual function as both optical prosthesis and epistemological apparatus. 53.
