<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE of which the Johannine literature came, makes one wish that he had given much more space to such questions, well beyond the self-imposed limits of the Introduction-pattern he has elected to follow. IRVIN W. BATDORF UNITED THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY DAYTON, OHIO The Doctrine of Merits in Old Rabbinical Literature and The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God, by A. Marmorstein, with a prolegomenon by R. J. Zwi Werblowsky. New York: KTAV, 1968. Pp. xix+199+217+vii+163 (3 volumes in 1). $14.95. For the ever-growing number of readers of this journal whose impressions of the 1930's are hazy and who remember the 20's not at all, it is well to identify Arthur Marmorstein (1882-1946). Born in Hungary, educated at a yeshivah, at a Calvinist gymnasium, at the universities of Budapest, Berlin, and Heidelberg, and professor for thirty years at Jews' College, London, Marmorstein was a typically great member- and one of the last - of the judische Wissenschaft movement. He wrote prolifically in many languages and on many themes, but above all he devoted himself to the critical study of the early rabbinic tradition. The three volumes brought together in this single volume are among his finest work in this field. In The Doctrine of Merits in Old Rabbinical Literature (1920), Marmorstein collects haggadic texts of the tanna'im and amora'im illustrative of the many facets of the issue of zechuth. Beginning with a philological study of the term itself, Marmorstein shows how, generation by generation, rabbinic thinkers amplified the notions of the merits of the fathers, the merits of the children available for the fathers, the merits of the righteous and the things which most quickly acquire merits (faith, Torah, observances). Merit Marmorstein's own work has, too. His textual citations are based on the best critical editions available to him. It is worth remembering that Marmorstein cooperated with G. Kittel in the preparation of the Rabbinische Texte series, though he withdrew from the project after Kittel's now infamous pamphlet, "Die Judenfrage," was published in 1933. Though the discussion is more encyclopedic than analytical, it is never pedantic. Not only are comparisons to apocryphal literature, the gospels, and the church fathers appropriately drawn; not only is the work of the great con- temporaries Kohler, Schechter, S. Levy recognized; not only is relevant material from Buddhism and Zoroastrianism employed, but all is graced by a palatable polemic against detractors of the doctrine of merits. The two-part essay The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God (1927, 1937) seems rather more dated than the first work, although part of it was written considerably later. Perhaps we have lost our affinity for synthetic approaches on the grand scale such as this one. With no less a doctrine than God as the subject, and with the exposition of texts (or more frequently, segments of texts) organized in large part by theological headings 228</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE rather than by considerations intrinsic to the texts themselves, the essay leaves the impression that the doctrine of God (as omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, eternal, true, just, good, pure, and holy) is in fact a scholarly midrash on the multiplex sources. Nonetheless, the essay remains a valuable retrieval of information from a vast literature regarding such matters as the pronunciation of the tetragrammaton, the (91) names of God found in the midrashic and talmudic literature, and (in part II) material bearing upon early Jewish use of anthropomorphic language. In connection with the latter, the author inevitably is led to discuss allegory as an exegetical tool for handling biblical anthropomorphism; his contribution here is of lasting value. Some of the reservations expressed in these lines are clearly shared by Professor Werblowsky, who writes the preface to this edition. Nonetheless, Werblowsky welcomes the book back into print not only because many of the scholarly judgments contained therein have stood the test of time (e. g., Marmorstein's thesis that the euphemistic tradition surrounding the tetragrammaton enjoyed its own evolution, maqom being supplanted in the 3rd century C.E. by ha-qadoS baruch hu'), but because such issues as merits and anthropomorphic language are of contemporary theological relevance. W. SIBLEY TOWNER YALE DIVINITY SCHOOL The Septuagint and Modern Study, by Sidney Jellicoe. Oxford and New York: Clarendon Press, 1968. Pp. xix+424. $9. This comprehensive discussion of LXX studies in the present century is intended to supplement Swete's Introduction (revised by Ottley in 1914), not to supplant it. After an introductory chapter on modern LXX study, its antecedents, beginnings, and development, Professor Jellicoe divides his book into two parts. The first part, "Origins and Transmission-History" (pp. 27-171), has successive chapters on LXX origins (the Letter of Aristeas), modern theories of origin, early revisions (Aquila, Theodotion, Symmachus), Origen and the Hexapla, and the Trifaria Varietas (Origen's recension, and those of Hesychius and Lucian). In the second part, "Text and Language" (pp. 173-359), there are chapters on LXX MSS (with a descriptive list of all uncials, a brief discussion of cursives, and a survey of the more important papyri and fragments), the various versions, modern editions and text-critical studies of LXX books (esp. the Cambridge and G6ttingen critical editions), language and style, and the current situa- tion in LXX studies. Finally, two appendices (a comparative table of the MSS sigla employed in the Cambridge LXX, and a list of all the MSS and fragments collated in the Gottingen and Cambridge critical editions), a selected topical bibliography, and various indices complete this impressive and very useful resource volume. The book is clear and readable throughout. Printing errors are kept to a minimum, but the following corrections should be made: "more" for "ore" on p. 23 (n. 5); rephrase the third sentence on p. 29; "dependence" for "independence" on p. 98; replace the 230</page></plain_text>
