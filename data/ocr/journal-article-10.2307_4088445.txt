ISBN 0-8130-1129-9, cloth, $34.95.-This is a de- tailed, well-referenced chronology of T. Gilbert Pearson's (1873-1943) involvement in the beginnings of the bird-protection movement. The first half of Pearson's life is described, and the book terminates (abruptly) halfway through his career. Pearson was a poor Florida farm boy with a consuming passion for birds and a determined resolve to rise above his hum- ble Quaker origins. He attended college in North Car- olina and adopted the state as his own. After pro- gressing as a faculty member he became intensely devoted to the popular and political battles in the bird-protection movement. Pearson's enthusiastic public speaking and gift for fund-raising led to a career as a lobbyist/organizer and administrator for causes of the numerous Audubon Societies, first lo- cally, then nationally. Pearson worked closely with and often as the agent of William Dutcher, a main motivating and organizing figure in the bird-protec- tion movement. This book has little to do with the science of or- nithology. However, anyone interested in the polit- ical and administrative actions of the early bird-pro- tection movement will discover much here. I found the complex history more readable than I anticipated. It describes multiple, loosely organized volunteer or- ganizations waging a popular and legislative war against professional plume harvesters and market hunters. If I had an interest in tales of legislative maneuvering, my enthusiasm would be high. Readers of this book will encounter a vivid picture of popular bird interest early in this century. This period is char- acterized by anthropomorphic excitement about "cheerful songsters," ceaseless trumpeting of the eco- nomic value of birds as our defense against a world of pests, and a quasireligious crusade against whole- sale and often idle slaughter of wildlife. The begin- ning of the conservation movement in North America came with the dawning of public appreciation that natural resources were not limitless. It demonstrated that publicly supported legislative and enforcement activities could preserve natural resources that clearly were threatened with extinction. The conflicts were intense and often dangerous. I was surprised to learn that at least three Audubon wardens were murdered in the line of duty, and many had their lives threat- ened. I am glad to have learned of Mr. Pearson, of whom I confess I'd never heard, but come away disappointed with this book overall. I was disappointed that it did not include a broader discussion of people and actions related to the bird-preservation movement and was</page><page sequence="2">670 Reviews [Auk, Vol. 110 annoyed by the sudden termination of the work after Pearson moved to New York in 1912. In 1912 Pearson was, as the fly leaf of the book tells us, "the first full- time leader of the National Association of Audubon Societies. He continued his work with the national organization until 1934, helping to build the associ- ation into the strong international force for conser- vation that it is today." None of his work from 1912 until his death in 1943 is discussed. After the ex- haustive detail of the first part of his life, I expected to hear at least something of the second half of his career. He published multiple works during his last 22 years of professional activity including an edited series-Portraits and Habits of Our Birds-which con- tains works by Forbush, Dutcher, Frank Chapman, Witmer Stone, C. H. Townsend, F. H. Allen, A. C. Bent, Edward W. Nelson, George Bird Grinnell, and Joseph Grinnell. This list reads like a Who's Who of North American Ornithology of the period, and I'd like to know more about Pearson's association with these people. Saving American Birds makes it clear that William Dutcher, a New York insurance agent, was a force of great importance in the AOU, the Audubon Societies, Mr. Pearson's life, and the conservation movement in general. I often wished that I was read- ing Mr. Dutcher's biography rather than Mr. Pear- son's. Many of the questions raised in my reading were answered in The Audubon Ark: A History of the National Audubon Society (F. J. Graham and C. W. Buch- heister. 1990. Alfred A. Knopf). While preparing this review, I found the history of the conservation movement somewhat difficult to approach. The works I encountered all seemed to have a particular bias, variously from the viewpoint of for- esters, sportsmen, ornithologists, ichthyologists, or administrators. My reading suggests that the first pop- ular arguments for preservation came from sports- men, starting in the 1870s. Reiger's history of this- American Sportsmen and the Origins of Conservation (J. F. Reiger. 1975. Winchester Press)-is useful and inter- esting, but I strongly agree with Banks' fine review (1976. Auk 93:864), suggesting that the "sportsman" angle is overemphasized. All writers agree that the main history of avian conservation began in 1884 when William Brewster instigated the organization of an AOU Committee on the Protection of North American Birds. In 1886 this committee issued a bulletin containing a proposal for a wildlife protection law. This law is referred to as the "Model Law," and many sources refer to it as one of the most important documents in the history of conservation. Its proposals for legal protection of wildlife produced an outcry amoung the public and professionals alike, but it guided most subsequent legislation. The mid-1880s was a time of rising public sentiment for bird protection. These protective en- thusiasms were aided by the effects of the introduced House Sparrow and its easily seen displacement of native birds. The founding of numerous (and gen- erally short-lived) "Audubon" Societies was a pop- ular expression of this protective spirit. The founder of the first Audubon Society was a remarkable individual, George Bird Grinnell (1849- 1938). Grinnell appears several times in Saving Amer- ican Birds; details of his life can be found in The Passing of the Great West: Selected Papers of George Bird Grinnell (J. F. Reiger. 1972. Charles Scribner's Sons). He grew up on Audubon's estate, played with Au- dubon's children, and was schooled and inspired by Audubon's widow. He went on to be a student of 0. C. Marsh (receiving a Ph.D. in Osteology), an AOU member, a member of the Committee on the Protec- tion of North American Birds, the editor of a sports- man's magazine, an expert on Plains Indians and the West, and a close advisor to Theodore Roosevelt. In the 11 February 1886 issue of his magazine, Forest and Stream, Grinnell published an editorial proposing the first Audubon Society. Despite enormous popular re- sponse, this initial society lasted only until December 1888. Reiger maintains that "when [Grinnell] found- ed the first Audubon Society, he named it as much for [Audubon's widow] ... as for her husband" (Rei- ger 1972: 22)-although Reiger's basis for this state- ment is not clear. Grinnell's middle name, Bird, is singularly apt for this unusual individual. "Bird" seems to be a family name as Grinnell's father (George Blake Grinnell) had a cousin named George Bird (The Na- tional Cyclopaedia of American Biography. 1893. James T. White &amp; Co.). George Bird Grinnell was a distant cous- in of the ornithologist Joseph Grinnell (1877- 1939); their most recent common ancestor was born in the late 1600s (Stephen G. Hermann pers. comm.). The book reviewed here does not strike me as con- taining particularly useful lessons for those strug- gling with current issues of preservation and protec- tion. The period at the turn of the century had intense popular enthusiasm for conservation which was op- posed by relatively idle, wasteful, and wanton de- struction; this seems a contrast to the overpopulation and survival challenges of our day. The detail of Mr. Pearson's early life makes this book appropriate for reference libraries and for those people with a passion for biographies associated with conservation history. For those interested in a history of the Audubon movement in particular, and with some interest in the history of conservation generally, I recommend the other book mentioned here.-ALAN P.
