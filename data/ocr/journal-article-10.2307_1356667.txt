<plain_text><page sequence="1">Preliminary Report of the Second Season of the "Central Negev Highlands Project" RUDOLPH COHEN Department of Antiquities and Museums I Jerusalem, Israel WILLIAM G. DEVER The University of Arizona, Tuscon, AZ 85721 Introduction The second season of the "Central Negev Highlands Project" was carried out in the Nahal Nissana 8 July-1 August. This project is a joint American-Israeli, multi-disciplinary project in ar- cheology and arid lands studies, concentrating on the complex of domestic settlements of the MB I period (ca. 2200-2000 B.C.) in the Central and Western Negev.' The second season of fieldwork was directed by the authors2 and co-sponsored by the University of Arizona and the Israel Depart- ment of Antiquities/Archaeological Survey of Israel (in affiliation with the American Schools of Oriental Research and also as a participant in the Israeli-sponsored "Negev Salvage Campaign" anti- cipating the military realignment along the Sinai border). Financial support was provided by a Chairman's grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, matched by the University of Arizona and supplemented by the Archaeological Survey of Israel.3 Project Objectives The 1979 season of the "Central Negev Highlands Project" focussed again of the area of Beer Resisim (Grid Reference 109 X 206; fig. 1).4 Our principal objectives this second season were: (1) to determine what the logistical problems would be if fieldwork were to be undertaken on a larger scale than that attempted in the brief pilot season in 1978 and to plan accordingly; (2) to begin a regional survey which would enable us to understand the principal site of Beer Resisim in both environmental and historical context and to develop strategy for expanding the excavation to outlying features in the area; and (3) to continue the clearance of the architecture at Beer Resisim itself so as to amass a more detailed and comprehensive picture of the material culture and its economic basis, principally of the MB I period but also of any other periods represented on the site. These objectives were largely met, as will be seen from the following r6sum6 of results. Summary of the 1979 Season 1. Logistics. Since Beer Resisim is only 10 km. inside the Sinai border, in the pilot season the previous year we had been required by security regulations to commute daily from the Field School at Sede Boqer, 90-100 km. distant by road. This restriction limited us to approximately 18 workers and 12 rather short days in the field. This season, however, the army assisted us in erecting a temporary camp at the well-known oasis at Be erotayim (Arabic Bir Birein) in the Nahal Nissana, only 9 km. west of our site at Beer Resisim. Thus we were able to support an average of nearly 40 people in the field, putting in 20 full workdays. We also demonstrated that despite the isolation and the extreme conditions of the Negev in summer, it is possible to supply a fairly large excavation and even to conduct a field school for student volunteers, as we expect to do in the future. 2. Survey. It was clear from the beginning that Beer Resisim, indeed the entire MB I complex, was only one component of a regional system of adaptive strategies built up over many centuries in the Central Negev Highlands. It was necessary, there- fore, to investigate the site in the context of a 41</page><page sequence="2">42 RUDOLPH COHEN AND WILLIAM G. DEVER BASOR 236 ~i?;??

Al- though the Army had not permitted us to be off the site itself in our first season, in 1979 we were given permission for a survey within a one-kilometer radius of Beer Resisim, and thus we fielded three survey teams. One team, directed by Jerome Schaefer of the University of Arizona, conducted an intensive archeological survey, the goal of which was a period-by-period map of all sites from the Paleo- lithic to the modern Bedouin occupation (fig. 2). These sites were described and dated as fully as possible from surface remains, and within each period they were plotted in terms of their distribution and their relation to each other. Particular attention was paid to the size and function of individual sites within their micro- environment, judging from topograpohy, strategic location, and access to soil, water and other resources. Some 150 sites were located in our investigation, the results of which are summarized in fig. 3. Several significant observations can already be made on the basis of the surface survey. (1) The overwhelming majority of the sites and features- cairns, camps, isolated structures, and small aggregated settlements-can be dated by surface remains to late EB or MB I, indicating that this was the only period of substantial occupation. (2) The main function of many sites can be theorized from surface investigation: the cairns are mostly burials (confirmed later by excavation of two of them; see below); the isolated round structures, located on loess terraces, are outlying dwellings (and occa- sionally animal enclosures) of farmers and shep- herds; and the four clusters of similar round structures are outlying MB I villages of Beer Resisim, ranging from half a dozen to some 30 houses. (3) The number, distribution, and character of these sites surely indicates a substantial domestic occupation in MB I, rather than the mere presence of pastoral nomads or transitory settlers. (4) Com- parisons of size and density of remains within some of the aggregated settlements already indicate possible rank-sizedifferentiation, with Beer Resisim indicating by far the greatest density and size. The implications for economic or social stratification would of course have to be worked out in actual excavation. (5) The proximity of many dwellings to alluvial terraces and wddT dams, where no evidence exists for later sedentary (i.e., Byzantine) occu- pation, suggests that agriculture played a factor in MB I and that the subsistence system of the region was based on a mixed herding-farming economy. (6) Future strategy should include trenches to date any traces of runoff agriculture; soundings in some of the larger, more complex cairns and structures (such as Sites 126, 148, 149, 157, 180, etc.); test</page><page sequence="3">1980 "CENTRAL NEGEV HIGHLANDS PROJECT" 43 ; i ?

The general objective was the study of "Man-land" relationships in the Central Negev, but we had certain specific questions in mind. Why did the MB I people choose this particular region for settlement? What did the natural habitat offer them-and how may conditions and resources have differed in antiquity? How did people interact with their environment, how is their adaptation reflected in the MB I material culture, and what economic and social patterns may be discerned thereby? The strategy for answering these questions employed several interrelated research techniques of the sciences, including: (1) geomorphic mapping in order to describe the natural features of the immediate region completely and tabulate all lithic and soil resources; (2) hydrological analysis to investigate patterns of precipitation and evapo- ration, flood/drought intervals, underground aqui- fers and their replenishment, and hydrologically- favorable sites; (3) a climatological survey to investigate the present effects of temperature, wind, and humidity, as well as attempting to assess climatic change over the past four millennia; (4) a study of alluvial terraces, wddr dams, and runoff- systems, in order to trace and date any remains of ancient agriculture; (5) a geobotanical-grazing study, coupled with ethnographic survey of the remaining Beduin population, in order to assess the local flora, past and present, in terms of ability to support herding of sheep and goats. In addition to directing this survey, Gerson was on-site daily to assist with identifying lithics and their sources; analyzing all sediments in the cut sections; advising on palynological samples and their context; selec- ting sherds for petrographic thin-secions; and contributing to studies of the collapse and weathering of buildings and debris. Finally, he is responsible for coordinating all laboratory analysis of the Project. Already the scientific survey has pinpointed soil and water resources more ample than we had thought, and it has also shown the likelihood of dry-farming having been practiced in MB I. However, the survey must be extended and much more evidence must be amassed before a detailed, comprehensive picture of the ancient habitat of the Negev will emerge (cf. fig. 4).5 The third survey, of prehistoric sites, was conducted by Philip Chase of the University of Arizona.

Schematic diagram of Man-Habitat relations in the Nahal Resisim region. Har Harif to the south of us had revealed extensive Paleolithic and even Mesolithic-Neolithic occupa- tion (Marks 1976, 1977), but our region had never been surveyed. The results of this survey were somewhat disappointing, so much so that we will not attempt to continue.6 The area we surveyed (within a one-kilometer radius of Beer Resisim) produced no concentrations of artifacts of def- initely pre-EB age. One "industry" found at several locations might be prehistoric. Encountered as a concentration of artifacts within scatters of naturally fractured flint, this material generally consisted of large nodules with only a few flakes removed, occasionally a more thoroughly worked core, good flakes and some blades, and a few tools (usually crude denticulates and some scrapers, often with inverse retouch). A few cores and flakes which could be classified as Levallois were found, but never enough to suggest that any artifact concentration dated from the Mousterian. The material was found in three contexts: (1) on the flat surfaces of ridges and mesas, probably where dropped or where it had settled after the erosion of fine sediments; (2) on talus slopes, with a concentration of naturally broken flint (here only large artifacts were found); and (3) less frequently, on alluvial and colluvial terraces in the valley bottoms (here the material frequently matched the sediment in size). None of these contexts permits one to date the material. A Byzantine sherd was found some 20 km. below the surface to the northwest of Beer Resisim, indicating that aggradation continued into Byzan-</page><page sequence="6">46 RUDOLPH COHEN AND WILLIAM G. DEVER BASOR 236 tine times, so that it is unlikely that any prehistoric levels are exposed by present-day down-cutting. This is confirmed by recovery from the same fill outside the survey area of lithics which closely resemble those recovered from the excavation of MB I structures at the site. In view of the questionable nature of the lithic material and the impossibility of dating what was found, we shall probably not continue the prehistoric survey. In the third season in 1980 we shall endeavor to complete the archeological survey by extending it beyond the one-kilometer radius. We intend further to dig selective trial trenches at both the isolated and the aggregated MB I structures, and we shall also do soundings on the alluvial terraces and against the wddT dams in an attempt to determine their age, use, and relation to the MB I settlements. Finally we expect to complete all aspects of the geomorphological survey. 3.Excavation on the site. a. Strategy. Our strategy for continued excava- tion on the site of Beer Resisim itself was built upon the accomplishments of the pilot season, during which we had planned some 70 structures visible on the surface (fig. 5) and had excavated two of them completely and one partially.7 We had observed that there were a number of enigmatic features about the individual structures, that their rela- tionships to each other were often unclear, and that typically they produced relatively little in the way of pottery and objects. Thus we proposed in the second season not to expand elsewhere on the site but rather to concentrate on the original "Area A" and to clear the entire area to bedrock. We hoped thereby to get large-scale exposure of the archi- tecture and to complete the town-plan for a portion of the site, as well as maximizing our opportunities for recovering a statistically valid sample of the domestic material both from houses and from refuse deposits in courtyards. Our excavation technique was again relatively simple, since architecturally Beer Resisim is a one- period site. We cleared collapsed stones until we could discern the outline of the architecture on the surface and then laid out section-lines which would both bisect the individual structures and would later connect them as conveniently as possible. Since all were small, circular independent units with rather elementary stratification, we developed an expeditious method for clearing these structures. We dug one-half rather rapidly (in effect as a "probe O O o O O ~%AREA A EG R II Q G CENSERAL PLAN Fig. 5.

We drew the section and then removed the other half of the material similarly but more slowly to check our stratigraphy.8 In addition to sieving all the debris related to living-surfaces, we attempted flotation of some 10% of this material (cf. below).</page><page sequence="7">1980 "CENTRAL NEGEV HIGHLANDS PROJECT" 47 BEE RSISIM 1910-19 AREA A ,* M. .0 5 i r Is Va K ~i n Fig. 6. Enlarged plan of excavated structures in Area A. Frequent soil samples and palynological samples were taken. All sections were analyzed and sampled by the geomorphologist before being drawn, and all loci were described using the Munsell Soil Color Charts. Because the material was scant, we attempted "total retrieval" as far as was compatible with the salvage nature of the project.9 b. Buildings ofArea A. Building 2 (see fig. 6 for the following), continued from last season, proved to be a two-room complex. Room 2A with its terrace wall and firepit along the south face had been built first, and Room 2 with its two column bases and its cooking installation outside the doorway to the east was added later. Room A, revealed this season, was undistinguished except for its rather dramatic roof-fall, clearly visible in the section (fig. 7). The evidence here and elsewhere confirmed last season's speculation that the charac- teristic thin, flat chalk slabs encountered in the upper levels of the collapse in these structures were indeed roofing material. However, apart from these stone slabs and the central stone columns now found in all the roofed buildings (below), we are not certain of the other structural elements or of the way in which the roof was actually constructed. 10 "Building 3," also begun last season, now proves to be at least three separate building complexes. Room 3A (fig. 8) is unique thus far in its roughly elliptical form, its almost exact north-south orien- tation, its four stone columns (the central two free- standing monoliths), and its doorway opening to the west. It is also unusual for its apparent evidence</page><page sequence="8">48 RUDOLPH COHEN AND WILLIAM G.

Bisected roof-fall and debris in Building 2A, looking NW. of a blocked, colonnaded doorway (or structural device?) in the east wall (fig. 8). In our first preliminary report we had already called attnetion to the unusual nature of this building and had raised the possibility of a "cultic" interpretation. However, there is little additional data to support that theory in the completed plan of the structure or in the meager contents consisting of a few sherds and fragments of a copper pin. Building 3B-F, completely excavated in the 1978 season, is now seen in larger context to be a separate architectural unit, not sharing any commonw alls with 3A and opening in the opposite direction, to the east (fig. 6). A complete saddle-quern and top grinder of Negev-Sinai sandstone, found last season on the bedrock surface of the main room (3B), is illustrated in fig. 9. The bin-like structure outside and to the right of the entrance (3E), upon further investigation this season, gave the clearest evidence we have yet had of two MB I building phases. The original phase is represented by the surface of bedrock and an accumulation of ca. 30 cm. of horizontally-stratified packed earth and ash above that, in which were found several beads, a shell fragment, two small pieces of copper, and a few transitional EB IV/MB I and MB I sherds. The upper phase is represented by (at least) the south wall of Bin 3E and the installation of a flagstone paving above the striated surfaces. (At the same time Bin 3C-D on the other side of the doorway to Building 3B, with only one phase but also flagstone- paved, may have been added.) Building 3M (fig. 10), dubbed the "Copper House," was a bell-shaped structure with no unsual features, the central column and monolith door jambs being typical (cf. fig. 6). However, beneath the hardpacked earthen surface, scattered along a deep crevice in bedrock, there was discovered a cache of two copper ingots, one broken, and a broken copper dagger (fig. 11; and cf. L. 3214in the section, fig. 10). Similar copper ingots, which are unique to MB I, have been found heretofore only in south Palestinian sites: Lachish, the Hebron hills, and Har Yeruham in the Negev. The Hebron hills horde of 18 ingots, which was accompanied by a worn MB I axe and dagger no doubt intended for re-casting, provides a parallel for our Beer Resisim group." These ingots probably have their source in the copper mines in the Sinai or in the southern Arava. Whatever their origin, they are best</page><page sequence="9">1980 "CENTRAL NEGEV HIGHLANDS PROJECT" 49 ::: i ?: ???.? :U?.* r? ---;??? ~:'' j7Ch '~I~5;~'r* '_i~5E;.

Building 4 exhibited the best masonry of any structure excavated thus far, with sidewalls of carefully fitted, monolithic slab construction and an unusual 7-course stacked roof column. The walls and column were preserved as much as 1. 15-1.25 m. high, which may be nearly the original height (cf. below). A great quantity of the thin chalk roofing slabs like those described above came from the debris, easily sifficient to cover the area of the structure. Outside the entrance to the east there was a windbreak and a cooking area, and beyond that there could be discerned on the surface a large rectangular courtyard or animal enclosure ca. 6.50 by 13.00m. The contents of Building 4 were unexciting except for four carved and polished pieces of conch shell, found scattered around the roof column (fig. 12). The shell had been worked into narrow bars ca. 8-10 cm. long, tapering toward the ends, sqaure or pentagonal in section. Two holes drilled in each suggest that they were intended to be strung together, perhaps as a pectoral. Other fragments of worked and unworked conch shell were found elsewhere (fig. 12), and together these give evidence both for contacts with the Red Sea gulf 150-200 km. away and for a hitherto- unattested shell industry in the Early-Middle Bronze period. Building 5/5A-5B was a three-room complex sharing common walls (fig. 6). Two of these rooms, 5/5A, are the only ones yet excavated which communicate through an interior doorway. The entrance to both rooms, on the east, provides us with our only example of an intact doorway with the lintel still in situ (fig. 13). The small size-only 40 cm. wide and 55 cm. high-would permit one to crawl through on hands and knees. These dimen- sions, together with the evidence shown elsewhere for reconstructed walls no more than 1.50 m. high, suggests that these "dwellings" were little more than sleeping chambers. (See also below for evidence that most domestic activities were carried on outside the structures.) Building 6 was a rather poorly preserved structure on a shelf of bedrock facing toward the eastern edge of our hilltop site (fig. 6). Apart from some large storejar sherds it produced little material. The Building 7 complex is the largest yet excavated, having five rooms sharing common walls and/ or opening onto common courtyard areas (fig. 14). Rooms 7A and 7B, both roofed and apparently sleeping chambers, open onto an eastern rock terrace. Room 7D, another roofed structure, opens onto a second rock terrace (7F), along with two unroofed areas, Rooms 7E and 7C (cf. fig. 6 for the above). An accumulation of ash, animal bones, and burned cooking pot sherds,</page><page sequence="12">52 RUDOLPH COHEN AND WILLIAM G.

Fragments of unworked Red Sea conch shell (left) and carved, polished implements (right). reaching a depth of ca. 30cm. in Rooms 7E, 7C, and Courtyard 7F, indicates that these were food preparation areas-the first extensive refuse de- posits or "middens" that we have located. (No cooking areas have yet been found inside the houses, and no tabtn's at all either inside or outside.) A smaller refuse deposit was found in the space enclosed between several rooms of the Building 3 complex and between Buildings I and 2 (cf. "3G" in fig. 6). Building 8 was of the usual type, except that its sole entrance on the northeast (fig. 6) had been blocked at some point, one more piece of evidence, though enigmatic, for inner-MB I phasing. Outside the building to the north, in area 8A, there were found two large pieces of the "horn" portion of a conch shell, along with the worked and polished tip (cf. above and fig. 12). c. Off-site structures. In the small wddr to the west (dubbed the "Nahal Avraham") several round structures similar to those on the site were excavated, all situated atop small terraces (actually post-Pleistocene alluvial fans). Investigation did not proceed far enough to determine whether the terraces were used for agriculture, nor could we ascertain the exact relationship of the structures to them. However, it is clear from the size of the circular buildings and the pottery that they are MB I dwellings, very similar to those on the site. The only other off-site structures excavated this season were some of the many cairns or tumuli on the western ridge. Two were chosen for excavation because, unlike most MB I burials of this sort investigated elsewhere,12 these appeared to be undisturbed. The first (no. 134, fig. 2) was a large, "battleship"-shaped cairn 8.00 m. long and 3.00 m. wide, with a curbwall of large, roughly squared monoliths, three inner chambers, and two courses of long narrow capstones (fig. 15). Although it had been broken into and robbed (?) on both ends, the cairn's undisturbed center chamber contained the fairly well-preserved remains of five individuals, partly disarticulated. No pottery or other artifacts were recovered, except one broken iron bracelet that may suggest a Byzantine intrusion.'3</page><page sequence="13">1980 "CENTRAL NEGEV HIGHLANDS PROJECT" 53 ?i 'I. ; ';?;; '??,: ?? :? :~ ??:~ ?... ;ib "' :::' "* (-:.

Looking NE across doorway with jambs and lintel in situ in Building 5, in background; note second doorway in 5A in foreground. The second cairn (no. 101, fig. 2) was much smaller and more typical: a low, oval stone pile bounded by larger boulders, ca. 3.75 m. long and 1.25 m. wide. It proved to be undisturbed, yet even sieving yielded no human remains. On bedrock there were found a well-preserved copper dagger with six rivets and an amphoriskos in crude red- slipped ware (fig. 16). The amphoriskos is unusual but would fit well typologically in late EB IV, and the dagger has EB IV as well as MB I parallels.14 Since there is no reason to believe that this cairn was robbed, either in ancient or in modern times, it may have been intended as a cenotaph. Whatever its nature, the date of the cairn is significant in pointing to an early EB IV/MB I presence in the area before the main building phase on the site at Beer Resisim. (See below on further evidence for an EB IV phase.) d. Pottery, lithics, objects. The pottery from the 1979 season was again scant. The typical structure produced only a handful of sherds, and the bulk of the material came from refuse areas outside the dwellings (above). It must be stressed very strongly that we found no restorable pottery in situ on living surfaces; the structures were periodically cleaned out, particularly before their final abandonment.

Cairn No. 134, looking SE, before opening. somewhat. In addition to the characteristic forms and "band-combed" decoration of the MB I "Southern" ceramic family previously found, mostly storejars and cups,"5 we now have a few sherds of bowls, one-handled jugs or pitchers, and "bottle amphoriskoi," as well as other previously unattested forms (see fig. 17: 1, 2, 13-15, 17). Of particular interest are two small fragmentary vessels in coarse, mottled red-brown ware of late EB type, but incised in the MB I manner(fig. 17: 16, 18); these could be understood either as "hybrid "or perhaps as transitional EB IV-MB I types. Also noteworthy are the MB I holemouth cooking pot sherds recovered from refuse areas (above), which include types not previously attested. The rims range all the way from simple bulbous rims close to the EB tradition, through various inturned and cut rims (perhaps designed for lids, fragments of which were found;cf. fig. 18: 1-10 on the above); all the way to the more common cut and slightly"flanged"cooking pot rims recently recognized as diagnostic for the southern MB I sites (fig. 17: 23-28).16 Fragments of flat cooking pot sherds suggest that at least some of these cooking pots had flat bases, and other sherds(fig. 18: 6-7) attest spouts. Special mention should be made of several sherds of small bowls and cups in crude, handmade "cooking pot" ware, curiously reminis- cent of the "Negebite" wares of the Iron Age (see Cohen elsewhere in this issue). As previously, EB II sherds were occaionally found in debris and fills or on the bedrock (fig. 18).17 Moreover, a few clear EB IV sherds came to light-the first clear instances of late EB IV pottery of Transjordanian type West of the Jordan. Particularly significant are the two red-burnished "teapot" rims, one with a rilled shoulder and the other with vestigial ledge-handle (fig. 18: 15, 17). Identical parallels come from the EB IV sites of Transiordan, especially Bib edh-Dhric, cAder, cAr6cer, and Iktanu.'8 (Note also the cairn 101 amphoriskos above and fig. 16, probably EB IV.) Lithics may be divided into two main categories of implements, those made of flint and those of limestone or sandstone. Flint cores and "Ballista"- like pounders were fairly common. In addition, all the buildings produced abundant dcbitage and in some cases even small caches of flint chips buried beneath the earthen floors. However, though flint knapping was widespread at the site, techniques were relatively primitive. The only finished tools were a few blades, some retouched, of the degenerate "Canaanean" type known from other MB I sites." In addition, there were much cruder 8 (~e- ?i K ~j~ tvV\ j\ \ ?'\ \\2\'\ \\\\\ i Fig. 16. EB IV red-slipped amphoriskos and copper dagger, near bedrock surface within Cairn No. 101.

Other than the flints, we recovered a few limestone mortars and pestles/pounders of either limestone or flint; a number of thin, chipped discs of limestone 10-12 cm. in diameter, possibly used as jar-lids; and several fine saddle-querns and top- grinders of Negev-Sinai sandstone, including one complete set found in situ on the bedrock living surface of Building 3 (above and fig. 9). Among small finds, the only significant items were the copper implements and the carved shell discussed above. Although these might be construed as evidence of a degree of wealth and sophistication, it must be noted that such finds were relatively rare. Conclusion: Significance of the 1979 Season 1. The EB IV/ MB Isettlement. To appreciate the significance of the results from Beer Resisim it must be recalled that only a few one-period settlement sites of EB IV-MB I-which alone can provide an adequate picture of the period-have been exten- sively excavated, and of these none is published beyond prelminary notices. In Transjordan we have soundings and scattered materials from Ader (Cleveland 1960), cAr6cer (Olivarri 1969), Kh. Iskander (Parr 1960), and Bab edh-Dhra (Lapp 1968; Schaub 1973; Rast and Schaub 1978); but the site of Iktanu is the only one where an EB IV-MB I village has been adequately exposed, and this is not yet published (but cf. Prag 1974).20 For Western Palestine, we possess only the data from caves at Jebel Qacaqir (Gitin 1975; Dever 1980a) and from the clearance of a few small Negev sites at Yeruham (Kochavi 1967; Cohen 1974) and farther south (Cohen 1980). It will be seen from this brief survey that Beer Resisim is the first MB I town site in Western Palestine to be excavated extensively in its environmental settings, utilizing modern multi- disciplinary surcey and field methods. The first result is that the largest known complex of MB I settlements-some 300 in the Central Negev Highlands-can begin to be seen in context. The fundamental questions of why the sites were located and how their economies were supported in such a remote and hostile region cannot yet be fully answered. However, we have clarified several problems. (1) It is clear from our geomorphological survey (above) that, despite the arid appearance of the region, sufficient water was available from shallow wells in the nearby wtdi" to support a sizeable population of humans and animals. (2) While we have not yet found definitive traces of earlier runoff irrigation systems, the presence of nearby Byzantine farms and the analysis of soil and water resources in the immeditate vicinity of Beer Resisim itself show that it is reasonable to postulate dry-farming in MB I-and indeed agricultural products were use in use on the site, whether grown here or not. (3) Ethnographic observations, plus climatological/geobotanical studies now in prog- ress, suggest that year-round pastoralism on a fairly large scale would have been possible. (4) Finally, the copper ingots, Red Sea shell raw materials, and Aswan granite from the Sinai or Egypt (above) provide evidence of a network of relatively distant contacts, so that trade cannot be ruled out as a factor in the economy. While no single strategy would have supported a subsistence system, a combination of strategies could have produced an adequate diversified economy. The question of why marginal semi-arid regions were apparently preferred over the more temperate zones in Central Palestine in MB I is still an enigma, but the phenomenon of the MB I settlements'presence and ability to sustain themselves in the Negev is no longer without explanation. Beyond questions of subsistence, Beer Resisim offers us the first real clues to the nature of these Negev MB I sites. (1) The size of the built-up area and the substantial architecture make it clear that these were not merely "Beduin-like encampments" but true villages, with several dozen or even several hundred inhabitants. (2) Whether the MB I sites were seasonal or permanent settlements, however, is not yet clear. The animal bones indicate at least a winter-spring occupation, and our knowledge of water resources and modern Bediun tribal move- ments suggests that the sites could in theory have been occupied also in summer. (This would not necessarily conflict with a transhumance model, since ethnographic analogy shows that part of the tribal unit may remain sedentary year round.) (3) The total time-span of these sites is difficult to estimate. On the one hand, typologically the pottery extends from forms as early as EB IV (above) to the relatively late MB I "band-combed" repertoire typical of the southern sites. On this evidence we would arrive at an estimate of a maximum range of ca. 2250-2000B.c. for occu-</page><page sequence="18">58 RUDOLPH COHEN AND WILLIAM G. DEVER BASOR 236 pation in the general area. However, the main architectural phase on the sites may have been much briefer, as indicated by the one-period structures, the shallow accumulation of debris, and the generally simple stratification of Beer Resisim. Here the principal building period need not represent more than 25 years, and indeed on the basis of stratigraphy alone it could be compressed into less time-in any case well within the 21st century B.C. (4) Finally, from our excavations there emerges an overall assessment of the Negev MB I complex which would not have been possible from surface surveys, however extensive.21' 2. Earlier settlement history of the Negev. There are at least three implications of our work thus far for the earlier 3rd millennium occupation of the Nege-Sinai. The first derives from the discovery of material west of the Jordan which is not only typologically earlier than MB I, i.e., EB IV, but is clearly Transjordanian in type. The evidence from a few sherds may seem slender, but fortunately our red-burnished "teapot" fragments are so distinctive and so diagnostic that their existence constitutes an indisputable link between Beer Resisim and the late EB sites of Transjordan (above). Whether this link implies simply trade, or actual movements of people from east of the Jordan into South Palestine between EB IV and MB I (cf. Dever 1973), it is evident that at least in the Negev there was some occupation in EB IV. This fact is significant in itself in filling a hitherto-enigmatic "gap." The second implication derives from a few apparently EB III sherds from the Beer Resisim survey, as for example a "pinch-lapped" ledge- handle. Again the evidence is slight but nonetheless raises the possibility of at least an ephemeral EB III occupation. This is not altogether surprising, in the light of the recent discovery of EB III material at Lahav (Seger and Borowski 1977) and Tell el-Hesi in South Palestine (Fargo and Ross in this issue) and also at Bib edh-Dhric and Numeira in Transjordan (Rast and Schaub 1980). This new evidence must be considered together with the recent reanalysis of late EB material at cAi, Jericho, and Lachish in South Palestine (Dever 1973, Richard 1980). The emergent picture, with which Beer Resisim would be entirely consistent, is of a considerable "post-urban" occupation in the south, which though not clearly related to the "Khirbet Kerak" phase in the north is nevertheless to be designated EB III (possibly later than the north). The third implication derives from the much more substantial evidence of numerous EB II sherds from both the 1978 and 1979 seasons (see above, and Cohen and Dever 1979b). Though none of this material was found in situ, or in relation to any datable pre-MB I architecture, again it indicates at least an EB II occucupation-one which in this case fits with the recently discerned pictures of the spread of EB II sites from Arad westward across the Negev to St. Catherine's in the Sinai (Amiran, Beit-Arieh, and Glass 1973; Oren 1973; Cohen 1978). In conclusion, the existence of a sequence of EB II-III-IV-MB I occupation at Beer Resisim (and probably elsewhere in the Negev) tends to confirm the continuity recently postulated between these phases and to strenthen the tendency to term the latter "EB IV" (Dever 1973, Oren 1973 and references there). NOTES 'For the project prospectus and a preliminary report of the first season in 1978, see Cohen and Dever, 1979a, 1979b. 21n addition to the authors as Co-Directors, the Staff consisted of Ran Gerson, Geomorphologist and Scientific Coordinator; Adina Nahmanovich, Climatologist (both of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem); Jerome Schaefer, Director of the regional survey; Philip Chase, Director of the prehistoric survey (both University of Arizona); Israel Watkin, Architect/ Surveyor; Jonathan Kline, Photographer; Pnina Barzion, Yehudith Ben-Michael, Karl Ebert, Mordechai Heiman, and Dov Nahlieli, Area Supervisors (all the above of the Archaeo- logical Survey of Israel); Elizabeth Bloch (the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago); Stephen Falconer, Michael Fink, and Bonnie Magness, Area Supervisors (all University of Arizona). Volunteers and students from the University of Arizona swelled the total workforce to about 40. 3Our gratitude is expressed to the NEH for its generous support (Grant Number RO-0222-79-710). Matching funds came from a subvention of the University of Arizona, provided through the courtesy of President John P. Schaefer, Executive Vice President Albert B. Weaver, and Vice President for Research A. Richard Kassander, Jr. We also gratefully acknowledge the substantial contributions of the Archaeological Survey of Israel, made available through the Director of the Department of Antiquities and Musuems, Avraham Eitan, whose encouragement and support was one again of crucial importance. Co-Director Dever's international travel was supplied by Dr. and Mrs. Nathan S. Kolins of Tucson, to whom</page><page sequence="19">1980 "CENTRAL NEGEV HIGHLANDS PROJECT" 59 thanks are due. We are indebted to the Zion Research Foundation for a grant-in-aid which enabled student partici- pation on the Staff. Finally the costs of the geomorphological survey were underwritten by ASOR Trustee Richard J. Scheuer, to whom we are most grateful. 4For a map of the area see Cohen and Dever 1979b, fig. 1. 5Contrast the approach above with the superficial study of Thompson 1975, which is based entirely on the early survey work of others and is misleading in both its methodology and its conclusions; see the forthcoming review-article of Dever 1980b. 6The following comments are taken from the Field Report of Philip Chase, who conducted the prehistoric survey. 7See our first season's preliminary reports, Cohen and Dever 1979a, 1979b. 8This procedure, a departure from more typical British- American methods such as those developed at Gezer, was a modification of the "rolling-baulk" technique now favored by many archaeologists at architectural sites. 9Only the flotation process was disappointing; despite several attempts with debris samples from both inside the dwellings and from midden heaps in courtyards, we were unable to retrieve any wheat, barley, or lager seeds. A renewed attempt will be made next season, with a specialist and improved equipment. '0oSee, however, prliminary speculation in Cohen and Dever 1979b; we hope to employ an on-site architectural specialist next season to pursue this question and even to reconstruct one dwelling. "The Lachish ingots are from the surface in "Area 1500" northwest of the tell, where dwelling caves and scattered materials of MB I were found; see Tufnell 1958: 39-43; 75; pl. 21: 11-13 (also 14, 15?). The 21 Yeruham ingots, from a clear MB I context at a related Negev site (the only other one excavated), are almost identical to ours in both type and metallurgical con- tent; see Kochavi 1969, and cf. the analysis in Dever and Tadmor 1976. The latter also publish the Hebron hills hoard (a surface find without knowncontext)and providecomparative discussion of all the available evidence on MB I ingots. '2See, for instance, Kochavi 1967 on the Har Yeruham cairns, which produced only scattered skeletal remains; and cf. Rast and Schaub 1978: 29 on the sterile EB IV cairns at Bab edh-Dhrac. The Negev surveys of Glueck, Aharoni, Cohen and others have generally found numerous MB I cairns of our type, which are typical of the region but are usually robbed (?) or otherwise empty. '3There are no MB II, LB, Iron Age or Roman remains whatever in the immediate region, ruling out a date between MB I and Byzantine. Geological analysis of the sediment filling the chamber makes a modern Beduin intrusion unlikely. Only RC 14 analysis of the bones of the various individuals will be determinative of which, if any, are secondary. The disarticulated burials are, of course, characteristic of (and almost exclusively confined to) MB I; on the implication of this burial practice for nomadic vs. settled population groups see Dever 1971 and references there. '4The heavy, degenerate red slip, the thick coarse ware, and the "baggy" round-base shape with high loop lug-handles all point to late EB rather than MB I. Note, for instance, that there is not a single such red-slipped MB I vessel known from southerr Palestine. but they are typical of Transjordanian EB IV/early MB I; see Dever 1971, 1973 for full discussion of the possible connections. The dagger has numerous well-known MB I parallels; but for nearly identical EB IV copper daggers, see Garstang 1935: pl. 24: 41 (T. 351, Jericho); Guy and Engberg 1938: fig. 171:1 (T. 1101B-02 Lower, Megiddo); and note also the EB III/ IV dagger from Bab edh-Dhrac in Rast and Schaub 1978: fig. 26 (T. D 1). 'SSee the preliminary report of the first season, Cohen and Dever 1979b, fig. 10. '6On these distinct cooking pots see Dever 1974: 40-42, to which other examples could now be added (cf. Dar 1977, on Macabarot). '7Cf. Cohen and Dever 1979b. '8See Schaub 1973: 11-13; Dever 1973: 47, 48; Rast and Schaub 1978: 34, 35 and references there for the EB IV red- slipped Transjordan examples. The few MB I teapots known from west of the Jordan are all unslipped /burnished;cf. Kenyon 1965: fig. 65: 2(T.0 1);69: 1, 2 (T. P 24);90: 1 (T. P 1);80:5 (T. M 12); 90: 7 (T. P I); for Kh. Kirmil, Dever 1975: fig. 5: 5, 6; for Jebel Qacaqir, Dever 1973: fig. 3: 21 (Cemetary B); for Lachish, Tufnell 1958; for Tell el-cAjjQl, Petrie 1931: pl. 42: 30J3 (T. 234); 42: 30J5 (T. 177). The above examples virtually confirm the Transjordanian EB IV provenience of the Beer Resisim teapots unless they are completely anomalous. '9Cf. Dever 1971: 148; 1973: 55 and references there; 1980. 20The authors are indebted to Dr. Prag for an advance copy of her report, based on her Oxford thesis, now in press. "~See the critique of Thompson, for instance, in n. 5 above. It must be emphasized that even the field surveys of Glueck, Aharoni, Rothenberg, and others-pioneering though they were--will now be rendered obsolete in some respects, as surveys often are by excavation in depth.
