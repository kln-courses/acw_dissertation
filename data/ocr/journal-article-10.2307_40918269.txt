<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON CATILINA: A STRUCTURAL EXAMINATION OF IBSEN'S FIRST PLAY AND ITS SOURCES Samuel G. McLellan University of Texas 1850, Paul Botten Hansen's review of Ibsen's first dramatic attempt, the 1849 Catilina, provided what has become the usual concept of the play: "En Hindring for dette forste Arbeides Vinden-anerkjendelse vil det maaskee ogsaa vaere, at Forfatteren har - som man vil sige - 'vendt sig bort fra det Nationale' og Tidspassende."1 In his Oxford edition of early Ibsen drama, James McFarlane agrees that Catilina "stands in some measure apart from the others,"2 which possess more typically nationalistic sentiments, themes, and motifs. Here one might cite Kjcempehojen, Ibsen's second play, a pastoral romance which is set in a tenth-century Viking milieu and is modelled on the northern tragedies of Adam Oehlenschlager. The literati of the mid-nineteenth century when Ibsen began to write displayed the need to find in reflection a link between the personages of the ancient literature and themselves and to define in drama a national, Scandinavian spirit and its development. As part of this literary tradition, Catilina would seem to be segregated by its recognizably historical but subsequently unnational content. Critics like Fredrik Paasche,3 who have treated in extenso the question of Ibsen's relationship to a so-called romantic movement in Scandinavian litera- ture, discussing everything from his aesthetic worship of nature to his representation of symbols of the Nordic past, have subsequently ignored Catilina. This paper will examine 1) the background of the play and what prompted Ibsen's selection of his character Catiline, 2) the configuration of characters within the play and what their relationships reveal about Ibsen's relationship with his sources, and 3) Ibsen's dependence upon and departure from the sources and consequential national quality of Ibsen's play. It is not really surprising that Ibsen, caught up by private circum- stances and public conditions in Grimstad during the late 1840's, might find a dramatically appealing figure in the first-century Roman insurgent Catiline. One need not point out all of the correspondences between dramatic hero and author. Ibsen had already read about Catiline in the Latin texts required for his university matriculation Scandinavian Studies 55(1983): 39-54</page><page sequence="2">40 Scandinavian Studies examinations, but depicts Catiline dramatically in the same way he describes himself in the preface to the second edition of the play - that is, as a victim of rumors and silent contempt about his ambitious politics and riotous living. A political zealot by his own admission, Ibsen followed with interest the spring revolutions throughout much of Europe in 1 848, composed poetic exhortations, and gave open speeches for the various republican factions - all of which were undoubtedly disconcerting to the conservative bourgeois of his small Norwegian community. Along with his social activity and one illicit love affair, Ibsen's subordinate position as apothecary's apprentice made his unsolicited opinions even more socially unacceptable, and his sometimes defensive remarks and criticisms alienated even his closest circle of friends. Ibsen seems even to alter or highlight some of the facts about Catiline from the Latin chroniclers to bring them more in line with his own particular situation. The affair with the vestal Furia, for example, deviates from Sallust's historical account in The Conspiracy of Catiline, which concerns, instead, Catiline's comrade Curius and his mistress Fulvia, but which is reminiscent of Ibsen's own earlier affair. Catiline clings to the idea of an obligation or call to free Rome from tyrants, just as Ibsen describes the political motives of his poems in the preface. Just as it is one of Ibsen's aims to correct the views, as he says, about "historiske personer, hvis eftermaele har vaeret . . . udelukkende i mod- standernes void,"4 so perhaps does Ibsen's aim contain a personal statement directed at his own social enemies and subsequently echoed in Catiline's aim to correct or "vaerne om hans Navn,/ og vidne mod, hvad skjaendigt man har l0iet"(l:58). Catiline is no writer, however; and Ibsen, no real revolutionary. But both are rebels of a sort, whose desires for self-expression and self- realization mean opposing established norms. Ibsen draws an accurate picture of his Catiline as an aspiring authority and of himself as an aspiring author when he describes the dramatic situation in his preface as "modsigelsen mellem evne og higen" (1:123). Clearly, both Catiline and Ibsen must contend with models of authority in the form of Sulla and Sallust respectively, predecessors who successfully combined these qualities. Three directions or equally acceptable courses of action affecting self-expression lie open to Catiline and form the tripartite, relational structure of the play- that is, a triadic configuration of characters surrounding Catiline. The first, as Catiline himself indicates, is "imod Venstre"(l:l 12), toward a rivaling and vengeful Furia and her gloomy</page><page sequence="3">On Catil/na 41 Tartarus, with its promise of greatness, power, and eternal fame. Her methods are, however, destructive and rebellious, consuming Catiline in hate and false hopes. Alternatively, a second way "mod Hoire" ( 1 : 1 1 3) is toward Catiline's loving wife Aurelia and her Elysium, a paradise of light, safety, and constructive action. Even if one disregards the verbal echoes of one character's words in another's, Catiline's movements toward or from Aurelia or Furia and the program of action represented by each are clear. For example, Catiline's decision at the end of Act 1 not to lead his Roman conspirators in their revolt and his reversal of that decision in Act 2 are indicative of the immediate presence and influence of Aurelia and Furia respectively. There is, however, a third path which Catiline must consider and which is offered by the model of authority appearing to Catiline in Act 3 as the ghost of Rome's last dictator, Sulla. In his conversation with Catiline, Sulla discloses his life's wish - eternal fame - and its cost - eternal peace: Ha, den har kostet; dyrt var den erhvervet, min Ro i Livet og min Fred i Graven mit Navn, saa taenkte jeg, vil evig staae, ei som en Stjerne, venligt glimtende - nei, som et Lyn paa Nattehimlen faestet! (1:95) This speech echoes an earlier soliloquy by Catiline: - Ha! det er ei hiin tunge Rolighed langt fra Verdenslarmen, som mig skraekker - - nei - for et Oieblik at lyse klart og flammende som Meteoret, for med en herlig Daad at vie ind mit Navn til Storhed, til Udod'ligheden... ! (1:69) Nevertheless, it is only after Furia has fired Catiline's ambitious and proud nature enough to reject Aurelia 's summons of retreat and to resume his plans of liberating and bloodying Rome at the close of Act 2 that Sulla finds it necessary to return from the grave to warn Catiline of an inevitably tragic fate and, more important, to call Catiline to account for threatening his own long established claim to fame. Sulla wishes Catiline to "vende om" ( 1 :96), to heal the breach between them by giving up the rebellion. Essentially, Sulla plays here the role of an overpowering precursor who must ask his threatening opponent, "Er der ei Veie nok til</page><page sequence="4">42 Scandinavian Studies Storbedrift?/ Hvorfor betraeder Du just den, jegbaned'"(l:95)? Though the ghost of Sulla is quite real to Catiline, it symbolizes Catiline's dual personality, at once the dark, destructive side (represented by Furia) and the light, constructive side (represented by Aurelia). Even Sulla's language is filled with the earmarks of both, for Sulla wishes to be remembered with "beundringsblandet Gysen" (1:95). By conveying a sense of fear and trembling to the dark figures in the play and a sense of admiration and inner peace to the light figures, Ibsen delineates the kind of love-hate relationship Catiline feels toward Sulla. Catiline is caught, then, in the middle of a three-way struggle. One might illustrate this relational structure as the letter Y, where Catiline is posited at the point of intersection between figures of rivalry, love, and authority. On the one hand, Catiline is drawn to villainous action by being reminded deceptively by Furia of the fame that he, along the lines of Sulla before him, can obtain. On the other hand, he is drawn to forget the past and his ignoble ambitions because of the prospects of peace of mind that Aurelia guarantees. Sulla's image gives Catiline mixed feelings, however, and provides a reason for Catiline's contradictory actions and hesitations, for Catiline is both drawn to and repelled by Sulla's "blodig Glands... som aldrig Nogen/ei for, ei siden vovede at naae" (1:95). In a sense, Catiline admires and resents Sulla's accom- plishments, much as an aspiring son may perceive his famous father. In a similar sense, Sulla's reactions to Catiline appear parental, at once fearing and admiring the son who emulates him, and Furia 's comparison of a Roman daughter who had seized her father's throne across her father's corpse seems only to emphasize this relationship. Catiline's movements toward extremes in character represent an attempt to correct the judgment others have of him by deviating from the course pursued by his predecessor. His movement toward Furia, however, warrants a dependence upon the methods of Sulla. Deserted by comrades, betrayed by friends, and yet hardened by the news of the execution of friends in Rome in Act 3, Catiline incites his remaining forces with words that promise admiration for the revolution. These words recall Sulla's own words and are recognized by Furia as presenting only a delusion for the feared reputation Catiline and his group will receive. They shall be remembered, Catiline says, "med Beundring"; Furia adds, "Eller Raedsel" ( 1 : 102). Unknowingly, Catiline is following exactly Sulla's past methods and duplicating the latter's terrifying reputation, a result that Sulla had feared would obliterate his own unique place in Rome's history.</page><page sequence="5">On Catilina 43 Similarly, Ibsen deviates from his source material to express himself and to correct historical judgments, but he does not venture very far from his precursor. Even Ibsen's preface to Catilina is actually similar to Sallust's introduction to the history of Catiline. Each author explains a political involvement as a youthful prelude to a historical interest in Catiline. Each author justifies his literary study of Catiline as objective. In his pursuit of literary fame, as he calls it, Sallust argues for an unbiased critical reception of his less-than-flattering but original picture of Catiline. Critic Harold Bloom contends that a beginning writer may rely heavily upon a source but revise or correct its stance as an expression of his own originality. Such a writer implies that "the precursor poem went accurately up to a certain point, but then should have swerved, precisely in the direction that the new poem moves."5 In this manner, Ibsen argues in his preface for a corrective judgment of Catiline by the early Latin biographers, whose views he did not share. Som man af min bog vil se, delte jeg ikke dengang de to gamle romerske skribenters opfatning af Catilinas karakter og handlemade, og jeg er endnu tilbojelig til at tro at der dog ma have vaeret adskilligt stort eller betydeligt ved en mand, med hvem majoriteternes ufortrodne sagforer Cicero ikke fandt det hensigtsmaessigt at give sig ikast, forinden tingene havde taget en sadan vending at der ikke laengere var nogen fare forbunden med angrebet. (1:120) Catiline's corrective movements from Sulla toward two extremes, extremes associated with two static characters (Furia and Aurelia), are analogous to (and probably result from) Ibsen's corrective departures from his historical sources. While Hermann Speck's analysis of Ibsen's use of the Latin sources reveals that "es ist in der Tat nur ein Minimum von Geschichte in das Drama iibergegangen,"6 all of the play's characters may be found in Sallust, Cicero, and Caesar.7 Ibsen has deliberately juxtaposed material about the historical figures. In sum, Ibsen's Curius is not the deceitful, foolhardy, and arrogant lover of Furia that Sallust portrays, but rather an innocent pawn controlled by Furia, who simply withholds her pleasures from him as persuasive leverage. The particularly unflattering portrait of Furia is only height- ened by Ibsen. She is given the task, for example, of driving off Catiline's supporters, the Allobroges, a deed contradicted by Sallust, who relates how the Allobroges's own decision to cross their powerful Roman neighbors resulted in their handing over the necessary information that led to the arrest of Catiline's comrades. Nor is Sallust's description of</page><page sequence="6">44 Scandinavian Studies Catiline's wife the picture of innocence and wifely virtues that Ibsen uses - not the wife who forgives Catiline in Act 1 for selling their property to be able to bribe or who sways him temporarily from his ambitions. Rather, Sallust relates that she is a woman about whom no respectable man ever found anything to praise except her beauty. Finally, that Catiline's crimes are numerous is historically attested but compounded by Ibsen, who connects Curius's Fulvia (Furia) with Catiline and invents a deceitful sale of Aurelia's land by Catiline. Ibsen depicts a noble side of Catiline, however, for the money he has received from the liquidation of his wife's assets is used for the release of a soldier's son imprisoned for debts. The effects of these changes - of drawing better pictures of Aurelia and Curius; worse pictures of Furia and, in fact, all of the conspirators; and a conflicting picture of Catiline - are to shift Sallust's characters toward one of two extremes and to position them around a central, more sympathetic and human protagonist. Noticeably absent in the historical accounts about Catiline is the appearance of Sulla's ghost. Sverre Arestad has found that Sulla's ghostly visitation to Catiline in the final act parallels Caesar's ghostly encounter with Brutus in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar* While the visitation of a ghost from Rome's past, the suicide of each hero after defeat in battle, and the relativity of source material present a tempting comparison between Brutus and Catiline and between Caesar and Sulla, one could as easily cite Ben Jonson's Roman tragedy Catiline, published a few years after Shakespeare's play in 1611, based upon Sallust's history, and sharing essential features with both Julius Caesar and Catilina.9 In each of the latter two plays, a ghost from hell, on discovering Catiline alone, speaks of the same inheritance of dark ambition and dark deeds that will overshadow all that came before. Ibsen's ghost is appalled by the more horrible deeds that await Catiline and uses his own similar deeds, instead, to frighten Catiline rather than incite him to action. Jonson's ghost of Sulla is derived from Lucan's Pharsalia, wherein a ghost of Sulla ascends to the battlefield to work mischief. Placed at the beginning of Jonson's play, Sulla's forecasts awaken Catiline's ambitious thoughts. Basically the same introductory inner voice that haunts Ibsen's Catiline is heard, but its purpose to call Catiline to action suits only Furia 's wishes, not Sulla's. If Ibsen used Jonson as a model at all, he has redirected the evil intention of Sulla's appearance to the play's dark figure, Furia, who appears in Act 2 to Catiline as a ghost and as a stimulus for Catiline's ambitious spirit. " Jeg</page><page sequence="7">On C ati lin a 45 er din Genius," she tells Catiline, "jeg maa ledsage Dig, hvorhen Du gaaer" (1:70). This expression of Catiline's ambitious spirit, however, appears to derive from an 1844 Swedish publication, containing Catiline's letters, edited by A.I. Arvidsson, whose folk-tale collections Ibsen utilized for his later ballad plays. In the first letter from Catiline to an old acquaintance, Catiline reveals that he has followed an authorita- tive model: "Derefter har jag foljt dig, sasom din genius."10 In Ibsen's play, then, Sulla is for Catiline what each of the historically related precursors is for Ibsen: a manifestation and model of authority to emulate but one to correct. While there is at least a faint basis for Ibsen's ghost of Sulla in the literature about Catiline, the relationships represent, for the most part, unsatisfactory attempts to find another model for Ibsen's divergence from the Latin biographers and, in particular, from Sallust. Ibsen's model for representing his and Catiline's situation and cor- recting Sallust's delineations in character is, nevertheless, derived from a more concealed source: Adam Oehlenschlager. This should really not be surprising, for Ibsen admitted having read Oehlenschlager's dramas at the time he wrote Catilina.11 Oehlenschlager's impact on Ibsen has, however, been sorely minimized. Henrik Jaeger concluded very early that Ibsen had not as yet learned much from Oehlenschlager, except perhaps the idea of using the unrhymed, iambic pentameter.12 Francis Bull seems to have rejected any patterning, saying that "det er neppe tenkelig at den dramatiske teknikk i 'Catilina' kun skulde ha sitt forbillede i Oehlenschlagers tragedier" (1:33). Michael Meyer writes that "it is difficult to see what the play owes to... the static and ponderous tragedies of Oehlenschlager."13 In point of fact, what Oehlenschlager's typically national plays have in common with Ibsen's Roman tragedy is a previously unacknowl- edged structure. Consider Oehlenschlager's 18 12 tragedy Stcerkodder.14 Its primary plot involves a Viking hero named Staerkodder and his return to Denmark from victorious fighting in Italy and Greece in the middle of the fifth century. A secondary, more applicable plot describes Angantyr, a Scanian king who has come to Denmark to make what he believes to be a rightful claim to the kingdom, now held by his dead father Halfdan's half-brother Ingiltf. In addition to Angantyr's ambi- tious motives, a love-hate relationship develops around Angantyr between Ingild's wife (Queen Thusnelda) and Ingild's sister Helga. Thusnelda loves Angantyr, who loves Helga. The two driving forces, revenge and love, are subsequently intertwined around Angantyr and</page><page sequence="8">46 Scandinavian Studies affect his course of action, as they affect Catiline's choices. In Oehlenschlager's central triad, however, the dark figure, Thusnelda, loves Angantyr and the light figure, Helga, hates him. Nevertheless, the descriptions of Thusnelda suggest Furia. Angantyr sees her as a sinister spirit, in the same way Catiline sees Furia. Even Thusnelda's nickname, "Svarteham," derives from her black attire and characterizes her inner nature as well, just as Furia 's inner qualities are emphasized by her black, outward attire. Both Thusnelda and Furia find in their respective heroes the opportunity to avenge themselves for a sexual crime committed against them. By contrast, Helga, despite her contempt for Angantyr, possesses all of the descriptive elements afforded the mild Aurelia. "Med Mildhed har jeg ofte svaret dig" (3:50), she tells Angantyr. The light and dark, mild and wild word contrasts which Bretteville-Jensen has found that Ibsen employs to distinguish Furia from Aurelia are, then, present in the same degree in Oehlenschlager's play.15 In addition to the descriptive relationships between the two plays' central characters, the conversations between Thusnelda and Angantyr parallel those between Furia and Catiline and help to delineate these characters and bind them together. In their first meeting, Angantyr displays a hatred for Ingild, which he believes Thusnelda to share. Recognizing this bond of hatred, Thusnelda inquires whether Angantyr feels more kindly towards her: "Ellers ingen anden" (3:46)? For Ibsen, Furia initially voices Angantyr's hatred and produces a similar question from the prospective courtier, Catiline: "Og heller ei for mig en anden" (1:50)? Angantyr explains his own anguish but adds that he acts rashly by uttering his heart's desire to her. Furia 's grief draws out Catiline's revelation about his wishes, and he confides that he, too, hides his agony in silence. When Thusnelda offers to help Angantyr in return for his love, his acceptance requires a vow of assurance from her. He demands that she swear by the gods and by the memory of her parents. The strong Thusnelda complies, chiding Angantyr for his weakness. A. Svaerg, Svarteham! svaerg helligt, At du mig skaffer Hevn, og Dod, og Danmark! Svaerg helligt! T. Ved Thuiskon og ved Hertha, Ved mine Faedreguder: dine Fiender Er mine, billigt er mit Had, som dit. Min Klogt skal laegge Styrke til dit Svaerd Og bringe dette Rige under dig.</page><page sequence="9">On C ati lin a 47 A. Og du skalst vorde min, min elskte Dronning. T. Du skiaelver? A. Faren saae mig aldrig skiaelve, Mig ryster Glaeden. (3:54) Ibsen recreates this exchange as well but reverses the roles once again, having Furia require from the infatuated Catiline the oath of revenge, sworn by his parents' memory and by the gods. Yet, Furia 's questions whether Catiline fears visiting the Vesta temple prompt almost exactly the same proud response from Catiline that Thusnelda gets from Angantyr. F. ham har jeg svoret Fiendskab til Doden, og Had bag Gravens dunkle Skygger selv. C. Nu vel- F. - Saa svaerg, min Fiende skal vorde til Doden din, sig, vil Du, Lucius? C. Det svaerger jeg ved alle hoie Guder, ved min Moders Minde, ved min Faders Navn, hoit svaerger jeg F. . . . svaerg end engang. Du frygter ei - C. - Jeg kjender Frygten ei; at mode Faren stedse var min Lyst! (1:53,50) Thusnelda then explains how her father had been forced to give her in marriage by Ingild's father; Furia reveals the source of her hatred of Catiline as the seduction of her sister. Learning that it is Catiline with whom she is speaking, Furia denounces him in words which he will recall throughout the play: "selv har Du Hevnen over Dig nedkaldet" ( 1 :54). Her prophecy is very close to Sulla's omen to Catiline concerning the latter's fate: "Du falder for din egen Haand,/ og dog en fremmed skal Dig faelde"( 1:96). The words of a prophet, which Angantyr twice recalls to his brother Bolver just prior to his meeting with Thusnelda, incorporate the kind of self-inflicted vengeance to which both Furia and Sulla refer: "Med Halfdan's Svaerd du tvinge skalst din Fiende" (3:43). Confirming these vague prophecies, both Angantyr and Catiline die later by their own weapons and their own hands. The first scene between Catiline and Furia, then, follows the conversation between Angantyr and Thusnelda, although Ibsen seems to give Furia a greater control over Catiline than Thusnelda shows over Angantyr.</page><page sequence="10">48 Scandinavian Studies Catiline's second encounter with Furia occurs in Act 2 and derives from Oehlenschlager's play as well. Prior to his second meeting with Furia, Catiline delivers a soliloquy about the conflict that faces him between the ambitious dreams he fosters versus his loving union with Aurelia, for whom he must sacrifice his ambition. Similarly, Angantyr presents his conflict in a soliloquy about his dreams of love for Helga and his ambitious union with Thusnelda, for whom he must sacrifice his love. Angantyr prays to Balder for help; Catiline, for a sign from the gods. Both Helga 's and Furia 's abrupt entrances at exactly this point are interpreted as appearances of evil spirits. Angantyr's dreaded question about Helga 's love for him and her rejection of him with a definition of love correspond to Catiline's dreaded question of Furia 's hatred for him and her explanations about the nature of hatred. There is good reason to combine Thusnelda's next conversation with Angantyr into the discus- sion here, for there is a similar bond of hatred in her newly formed relationship with Angantyr. "Jeg veed," Thusnelda acknowledges, "det er ei Kiaerlighed, men Had,/Som binder ham til mig" (3:55). The relationship which Furia has forced upon Catiline is likewise one of hatred. She says, "et sadsomt Baand/os sammenknytter"; Catiline recognizes the truth in her statement, responding, "Det er Hadets" (1:70). Thusnelda presents Angantyr with a choice of two paths of action - one, associated with a bloody hate and the other, associated with a peaceful love: Vaelg nu, hvorledes du vilst vinde Danmark: Ved blodigt Had, ved fredsael Kiaerlighed! Du staaer med Valgets Vaegtskaal i din Haand. Jeg overlader ganske til dig selv At undersoge, hvilket Lod i Skaalen Der har den storste Vaegt. (3:48) Ibsen has Furia offer Catiline the same two courses of action in this scene as well: Du stander paa en Korsvei i dit Liv, - hist vender Dig en stille Eensomhed, - et Liv, halvt Doden, halvt en dosig Slummer, men paa den anden Side skimter Du en Herskerthrone; - vaelg kuns, Catilina!</page><page sequence="11">On C ati lin a 49 Et dristigt Skridt og i din Haand er lagt det stolte Romas Skjaebne, Catilina! hvad her med kraftig Daad Du kunde vinde! (1:72-73) Basic to both Ibsen's and Oehlenschlager's plays, then, is the establish- ment of two forward courses of action for the central protagonists, courses which are themselves associated with other characters. The third element of Ibsen's structural framework, the figure of authority who causes Catiline to pause and weigh both sides of his particular situation, is vital for Angantyr's decision, too. Angantyr's final appearance in Oehlenschlager's play occurs with his brother Bolver as Angantyr contemplates his eventual fight with Staerkodder, who has killed a kinsman of Angantyr years before. Alone at night, Angantyr thinks about a ghost with a terrible and frightful voice, an underworld spirit who wanders the earth without comfort. Ibsen's Sulla is also a midnight spirit from Hel who can find no comfort and who has come from the grave to frighten Catiline from action. Angantyr recalls the prophecy about his fate but is determined to strike with his sword nonetheless. Catiline is not dissuaded either by Sulla's appearance, for Furia prevails in making Catiline take that first daring step toward action. The possibility exists that part of the sketch for Sulla's visit at Catiline's camp derives from the midnight visit to Angantyr's forest camp by an old man who repeats only the mysterious prophecy about Angantyr's death. And the spirit who later haunts Staerkodder each midnight hour and at whom Staerkodder must "gyse" (3: 1 13) seems to evoke the same fear that, one remembers, characterizes the ghost of Sulla. The prophecies of fate by Sulla and by the old prophet are, in fact, the major unifying devices in both plays and are heard, alluded to, or mentioned some seven times by Angantyr and even more frequently by Catiline as they consider their fates and the actions determining their fates. The deaths of the two heroes in Ibsen's and Oehlenschlager's plays are also depicted in a similar fashion. Angantyr's brother Bolver plays Curius's role of returning to tell the hero that his kinsmen have met their deaths without him. Angantyr realizes then that he is his own enemy and that his hatred and greed have killed his brothers as much as Staerkodder. He repeats the prophecy about him and runs himself through with his sword. Falling into his brother's arms, he understands</page><page sequence="12">50 Scandinavian Studies at last the riddle of the prophecy: "Med Halfdans Svaerd jeg tvunget har min Fiende - / Hielp, Odin. Angantyr kan lose Gaader"(3:89). Catiline comes to the same realization after his comrades are dead and he has mortally wounded himself. Falling into Aurelia's arms, he says: "nu fatter jeg din Tale, gaadefulde Aand!/'halvt jeg falder for min egen, halvt for fremmed Haand'" (1:1 12). Ibsen uses Oehlenschlager's Stcerkodder as a further model for constructing a dramatic situation and oppositions in character which will correct the historical sources about Catiline. As Oehlenschlager borrowed essential historical facts from the Old Norse Skjoldunga saga and dramatized the material in a mode typical of the times, so too has Ibsen embedded essentially historical details in a framework which he derives, in turn, from Oehlenschlager. The terms "mode" and "romance," as they apply to Ibsen's play, require additional explanation. The word "mode" means a difference in works of fiction in general, a difference that results from different levels of characters within - that is, a mode is determined by whether a character's power of action is less than, the same as, or greater than the audience's. Since Ibsen pointed out repeatedly that characterization was for him the single most important aspect of his dramatic process, it is appropriate to define Ibsen's dramatic development by the movement through various dramatic forms and the types of characters which define them.16 Northrop Frye has classified general literary modes or forms by the way in which characters are portrayed within a literary work. In a "romantic" mode, for example, characters move in a realm in which, to use Frye's language, "ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended" - that is, there exists a situation where elements such as ghosts (or other powerful beings), prophecies of fate, and close hero- nature relationships are common and where elements which would otherwise be absurd, marvelous, or fanciful in a more realistic mode of fiction are accepted here simply as the natural order of things.17 Seen in this way, one finds "romantic" aspects in the ghost of Sulla, who advises Catiline of his fate, or in the ghost of Furia, who makes frequent appearances in her effort to direct Catiline's fate - elements which, one will recall, do not stem from Ibsen's Latin sources but from Oehlenschlager's northern tragedy.18 Even the national picture of the strong Viking character like Oehlenschlager's Angantyr, who boasts sacredness of vows and a desire to escape the disgrace of a straw-death by dying in battle alongside his comrades or else by running himself through with his own sword, resembles the picture of Catiline,</page><page sequence="13">On Catilina 51 stemming, as it does, from Angantyr's character. One finds, too, that there is much in Catilina's lines as well that suggests a consistent link between characters and nature. In the comparisons of moonlight to Furia and sunlight to Aurelia, for example, the relationship between false, reflected light and a falsely guiding Furia and the relationship between real light source and the true inspiration of an Aurelia help to establish Ibsen's basic extremes in character once again. Furia 's relationship with nature is dark and destructive. Bretteville-Jensen has pointed out the associations of Furia 's wreath for Catiline with the poisonous henbane and poppy, which thrive in darkness.19 By contrast, Aurelia is connected with the white lily or rose, which thrives in light. Here too, one finds the same contrast established in Oehlenschlager's play. Helga is compared often to roses and lilies, but when Bolver compares Thusnelda to roses, Angantyr replies, "Lign hende heller ved den rode Valmu,/ Der blusser blodigdunkel og beruser" (3:42). Like- wise, Furia 's "Valmuekrands...lyse/i Maaneskinnet, lig det friske Blod" (1: 108). Angantyr and Catiline wish to weave their lives' wreaths with Helga and Aurelia, but are forced by circumstances and fate into tragic unions with Thusnelda and Furia. For both Oehlenschlager and Ibsen, the wreath becomes an image of a happy and loving union with the natural forces of light and goodness and an image wherein one can trace the unhappy and destructive influence of the natural forces of darkness and evil. Here, another, more subtle aspect of Oehlenschlager's influence on Ibsen introduces itself. Oehlenschlager connects his characters in Stcerkodder with mythical characters from his earlier Baldur hiin Gode (1806), which follows the Eddie versions of the myth about Balder and, in so doing, nominally provides the characters of the former play with even greater national depth. Interestingly, the myth of Balder is narrated by Blanka in Ibsen's next play in 1 850, Kjcempehejen (a play also heavily indebted to Oehlenschlager), in order to draw attention to the relation- ship between the central protagonist's actions and Balder's. Ironically, Botten Hansen's contemporary review of Catilina remarked that the obstacle to this play's obtaining recognition was that Ibsen had turned away from what was national and appropriate for the times; yet, much of Oehlenschlager's Baldur anticipates Ibsen's Catilina. The fate of the natural world is, for example, bound to the fate of Balder, who, on a larger scale than Angantyr or Catiline, "sammenbinder Valhals Krands" and with whose death "skal i Rosers og Liliers Sted/Lygtmaend blomstre"(2:159,185). When Balder dies, the whole Old Norse eschato-</page><page sequence="14">52 Scandinavian Studies logical system is doomed, and all of nature weeps. While nature is not actually anthropomorphic in Ibsen's play, Catiline's inner conflict is accompanied by and highlighted by an actual storm, and his death signals an elegiac passing of one order of things to another. The character configurations around Angantyr and Catiline evince traces of the Balder myth, as represented by Oehlenschlager. For Balder, the agents for the forces of darkness are the mischievous and hateful Loki and the blind brother of Balder, Hoder. The latter slays Balder unwittingly. For Angantyr and Catiline, Thusnelda and Furia fill Loki's role as agents provocateurs. Here, one might note that since Furia sets Catiline's kinsman Curius up as a rival, because Curius follows "blindt" (1:87) Furia 's instructions, and because he even pulls his dagger in Catiline's presence, Furia occupies Loki's role of convincing Curius to assume Hoder's role. The seductive Thusnelda is, like Loki, called an "Orm," and Angantyr, "Fuglen (som) maa i den rene Luft/ Undgielde Ormens Nidingsvaerk i St0vet"(3: 105). Furia is described with this same metaphor: "Dit Blik er Slangens ligt, naar det sig faester/ med Tryllemagt paa Fuglen, som med Angst/ omflagrer den i Kredse, stedse mere/og mere naer det frygtelige Svaelg" (1:86). In the plays by Ibsen and Oehlenschlager, the light figures- Helga, Frigg (Balder's mother), and Aurelia - perform what positive action is taken to save Angantyr, Balder, and Catiline from a destructive fate. As for the figures of authority, Sulla appears to warn Catiline what the fates have in store, just as Odin, Balder's father, is responsible for finding the meaning of his son's dream and warning him of its terrifying consequences for both of them. Together, the configurations of characters around Balder, Angantyr, and Catiline share deliberately identical, relational deline- ations. What Oehlenschlager's two plays provide for Ibsen's play in the way of material content, a romantic cast, and character relationships with a national base, they also provide in meter. Of all of Oehlenschlager's plays, only in Baldur does one find the heptameter which Ibsen has employed twice - in Catiline's dream in Act 3, where his situation is displayed as the struggle between a light figure and a dark figure playing "Brikkespil,"and then later in the same act when the dream is reenacted and Furia and Aurelia quarrel in an alternating heptametrical con- tinuum. The aabb and abab rhyme schemes and the more common pentameter of Ibsen's play may be found in Stcerkodder. One must not lose sight of the fact that Ibsen's Catiline is historically based upon the Roman Catiline, despite the critically obvious but</page><page sequence="15">On Catilina 53 textually concealed parallels to Oehlenschlager's Nordic Angantyr and Balder. The sympathetic picture of Catiline that Ibsen effects does, indeed, represent a corrective movement from his Latin sources - in particular, Sallust - a movement which characterizes Catiline's at- tempted veering from and dependence on Sulla's authoritative figure. More subtle is Ibsen's dependence on a second, Scandinavian source and a model for his corrective movement from and expressive reaction to the Latin sources. Ibsen's choice of Oehlenschlager's plays and his substantial adherence to Oehlenschlager's types of characters, dramatic content, and style account for Catilina^ tripartite restructuring of characters and for the national identity and depth of its characters. All in all, Catilina would seem to mark the first fruits of Ibsen's interest in the literature of the North. 1 Karl Haugholt, "Samtidens kritikk av Ibsens Catilina" Edda (1952), p.76. 2 James McFarlane and Graham Orton, trans., The Oxford Ibsen l(London,1970), 7-8. 3 Fredrik Paasche, Gildet paa Solhaug: Ibsens nationalromantiske digtning (Kristiania,1908). 4 Francis Bull, Halvdan Koht, and Didrik Arup Seip, eds., Hundredrsutgave Henrik Ibsens Samlede Verker 1 (Oslo, 1928), 120.

Ibsen's earliest reference (in 1850) to the term connotes exaggeration. Ibsen's last reference to the literary romanticism of the Middle Ages in the 1 883 preface to Gildetpaa Solhoug defines Ibsen's interest in the material of the medieval Norwegian folk songs for this play and suggests a more traditional association of the term with material relating to the national past.
