This decor forms the stage sets of Baudelaire's poems. Benjamin incor- porates Baudelaire's figures of Paris into the titles of his writings on French modernity-Das Paris des Second Empire bei Baudelaire, Pas- sagen, and even Zentralpark, a possible disguise for the Luxembourg Gardens or the pseudo-nature of other 'jardins publics." Like the popular "passages," the gardens mark the space of the passerby, Baudelaire's "passant" or "passante," and his or her itinerary through the city. Baudelaire stages an encounter between Nature and the City that haunts Benjamin's writings. In the passage from Zentralpark quoted above, this encounter appears as an aporetic "Widerspruch": it brings the Baudelairean theorization of Nature face to face with the Baudelairean renunciation of Nature that is essential to modernity. The text of "Uber einige Motive bei Baude- laire"' locates this Baudelairean encounter or "croisement" in the poetics of the correspondences. Correspondence circulates among the experiences of modernity that are inscribed in poetry, philosophy, fiction, and criticism.

Nine chapters of UEM precede Benjamin's direct approach to the motives and mo- tifs of the correspondences. Without losing sight of the seamless construction of the essay and the lines of communication that Ben- jamin draws (graphematically) between its parts, I will concentrate on several pages of UEM and a few of the Fleurs du mal that take root in Benjamin's prose. The subject of this essay on secret archi- tecture in the Fleurs du mal and in UEM is the reading of Ben- jamin's traces through the enigmatic territory of Baudelaire's cor- respondences. The challenges of Benjamin's text that confront the reader in- clude Baudelaire's extreme discretion about the correspondences. Benjamin takes his cue from Baudelaire: in spite of the privileged status of the sonnet "Correspondances" within Baudelaire's work, the correspondences as such occupy a relatively small place within Baudelaire's oeuvre.2 Although UEM does not resolve the enigma of their content, Benjamin locates the correspondences at the heart of the Baudelairean enterprise. For both Benjamin and Baude- liare, correspondence has a privileged status in the figures of art and interpretation. Benjamin's references to Proust provide the textual link between Baudelaire's writing and Benjamin's critique: Proust's emphasis on motif preserves Baudelaire's extreme discre- tion, and translates correspondence into prose fiction for A La Recherche du temps perdu.3 The interpretation of time in Proust's essays on Baudelaire provides Benjamin with a critical counterpart for the Baudelairean poetics of Proust's novel. Benjamin leaves the correspondences in the background of UEM until chapter X, at the strategic climax of his reading of loss and modernity. Like the exile, the passerby, the prostitute, and the criminal, the poetic narrator of "Le Jeu" is a witness to loss: he 2 In addition to Pichois's extensive documentation in OC I, discussions of the doctrines of correspondence can be found in Jean Pommier, La Mystique de Baude- laire (Geneva: Slatkine, 1967), Felix Leakey, Baudelaire and Nature (Manchester: Manchester U P, 1969), and Lloyd James Austin, L'Univers poetique de Baudelaire (Paris: Mercure de France, 1956). 3 I have discussed Proust's reading of Baudelaire and its importance for his novel in The Orient of Style: Modernist Allegories of Conversion (Durham: Duke U P, 1991).</page><page sequence="4">M L N 551 looks around with a "clairvoyant gaze" and reads the faces and gestures of his contemporaries, who are figures of loss like himself. At the extremes of poetic motif, these hidden traces of loss subtly emerge to play a major role in Benjamin's reading. UEM absorbs the traces of motives and motifs that form an elab- orate set of clues for reading the writing of modernity. The critic is a detective who discovers the scene of the crime among the crowds that shove and jolt the figure of the poet and among the sensual connections of "Correspondances." Caught in the historical and temporal terms that the crowd seems to emblematize, this poet- figure is "perdu": despite the triumph of the correspondences, he has lost the illusions and the appearances of past and future time (XII 652). The figure of Giotto's Iracundia becomes the image for the expressive power of Baudelaire's anger at the loss that invades him as a Modern: he has been tricked, deprived of his experience (IX 636-37). In the non-festive context of "LeJeu" with its "abime," "enfer," and "neant," apparently unrelated to the verse in which the correspondences celebrate their feast-days (X 641), the scene of Baudelairean loss unfolds as the scene of modernity. Baudelaire's rage shapes the hyperboles of its destruction. Benjamin borrows Giotto's grim-faced figure of anger from Proust's allegory, and renders it as a Nadar photograph of Baudelaire: this image an- chors Benjamin's reading of the correspondences. Des Sens Baudelaire's poem entitled "Correspondances" seems to be articu- lated at the borderlines; my epigraph from Zentralpark refers to them in the conceptual terms of contradiction and renunciation. The poem evokes these borderlines in the terms of confusion (or melting) and answering (or echoing). Each border has two sides: the elements of Nature and the artifices of the city, historical time and the time of pre-history, singular experience and collective ex- perience, and voluntary and involuntary memory. The split be- tween the spirit and the senses that ends the poem sums up the margins and dichotomies that characterize Baudelairean corre- spondences. These borders or breaks enter the poem through the minimal hieroglyph of a human figure: "l'homme." This "man" ("human"?) walks along the borderlines of experience-singular and collective,</page><page sequence="5">552 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN modern and immemorial, inside and outside Nature, sensual and thoughtful-in Baudelaire's most famous and most articulately un- readable poem. On its own (sybilline) terms, "Correspondances" seems to have touched its readers more powerfully than any other single poem.4 In the evocation of Baudelaire's readers (and his poetic calcula- tion of their powers of reading) at the beginning of UEM, the question of experience takes the stage in the lyric poetry of mo- dernity. Experience, reflected in the Baudelairean "oeil clairvoy- ant," gathers all of Benjamin's motifs throughout the essay into a constellation. It begins with Baudelaire's readers of the Fleurs du mal, the readers of "Correspondances." Benjamin evokes their preference for sensual pleasures instead of the difficulties of the lyric: "sinnliche Geniisse werden von ihnen bevorzugt" (I 607). Benjamin's insistence on sensuality threatens the traditional oppo- sitions that have been drawn between the happy ending displayed in the correspondence poems and the melancholy tortures of the spleen poems. The sentence continues: "sie sind mit dem spleen vertraut, der dem Interesse und der Aufnahmefahigkeit den Ga- raus macht [they are familiar with spleen, which kills off interest and receptivity]" (I 607). The clairvoyant eye of the poet-figure who shapes his readers in his own image enters Benjamin's first paragraph: his motifs culminate in the reading of the correspon- dences, in UEM X and XI. Captured in the smooth lyricism and the sensual richness of "Correspondances," the correspondences seem to represent a col- orful alternative to the "noir tableau" of Baudelaire's vision of mo- 4 "Correspondances" has produced a vast secondary literature of its own.

But the apparent contradiction between the celebratory poems of correspondence and the black poems of violence and spleen denies the breaks, the borderlines, and the disunity that are subtly inscribed in "Correspondances." Benjamin goes beyond the apparent contrast (between spleen and ideal) to uncover the hid- den traces of modernity that interrupt the smooth surfaces of the correspondences. Benjamin takes his cue from the break in the poem between "les sens" and "l'esprit." The discourse of correspondence includes the sensuality that Benjamin marks in the first lines of UEM (related to the melting and answering of the poem), and the mysterious, sy- billine speculation on the nature of the correspondences that Baudelaire's poem invokes. The concept of correspondence is traced and figured in the "croisements" and constellations of the poem. At the heart of Benjamin's gathering principle of reading, the terms of "Chiffre," "Verborgene Figur," and "Anagramme" [cipher/code, hidden figure, anagram] (XII 648, V 618, IX 633, ZP 30) are related to the Baudelairean poetics of the correspondences. Correspondence operates within a poetics of "croisements" or chance encounters: perfumes, sounds, and colors are taken up in a reflexive process of mixing, answering, and mirroring each other (or themselves). In the labyrinth of perception and experience, correspondence is a principle of an invisible constellation, a simul- taneous gathering and distancing, a harvesting and disseminating. Benjamin's understanding of Baudelaire draws much of its light from these hidden places. Like the strands of sensual perception that are woven into the fabric of the correspondences, the secret traces of experienced modernity are at the center of the Baude- lairean-Benjaminian stage. At the site of its labyrinthine "croise- ments," its passing encounters, its streets and arcades, these figures and traces shape the secret architecture of Baudelairean moder- nity. Anagramme The concept of correspondence encodes the secret structures, the hidden relations, and the occult architectures of writing; the most prosaic and common usage of the term denotes an exchange of letters. In Benjamin's texts, correspondence(s) keeps its distance from the explicitly mystical and scholarly interpretations (X 638)</page><page sequence="7">554 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN that have been applied to the subject of Baudelaire's poem in a number of attempts to solve its difficulties. Benjamin draws the motifs of UEM from the writing of the letter that is hidden in the text (its anagram), the secret signals (or ciphers) that must be de- coded according to the writer's calculations, and the hidden figures of modern lyric. His reading of the correspondences focuses on these elements in several of Baudelaire's poems. Correspondence in Baudelaire is the principle of the infinite mirroring of figural language. Its power is metaphoric, tropic, and rhetorical; correspondence problematizes the assemblage and drawing together of differences within poetic language. Corre- spondence operates at the heart of difference and similarity. In the figures of Baudelaire's poem, it solicits interpretation but remains uncanny; it seems familiar and disturbingly alien at the same time; it attracts the subject's gaze (by looking at him ["l'homme"] with the divine magnetism of "Kult") but it keeps its distance. From these elements of "Correspondances," Benjamin's understanding of Baudelaire's writings as the site of modern allegory seems to emerge. Its terms include spleen, loss, and the concept of the decay of Aura. Benjamin treats the problem of the correspondences in the allegorical terms provided by the poem and as a poetic pro- duction rather than as a concept borrowed from Fourier (or Swe- denborg, Baudelaire's other source).5 In Baudelaire's text, neither their names nor the technical term of "Analogie universelle" ap- pear; the term of correspondence is present only in the title. Baudelaire's poem is neither a description of the traditional un- derstanding of correspondences nor a demonstration that can be glossed with a hypothetical explanation of its concept. Pichois's fine observation that "it is remarkable that Baudelaire employed corre- spondances in an indefinite sense"6 indicates Baudelaire's innova- tion in form and content. The traditional usage includes a definite article ("les correspondances"); this usage is subverted before the poem proceeds beyond its title ("Correspondances"). The text en- gages in a relation with the new, modern, indefinite, and Baude- 5 Benjamin avoids both the scholarly attempts to gloss the poem and Baudelaire's enigmatic prose references to correspondence. In the decades since UEM was writ- ten, the scholarly debate about correspondence has focused on Baudelaire's faithful adhesion to traditional doctrinces of correspondence and the autonomy of his use of the term: Claude Pichois refers to Baudelaire's "personal meaning" (843) of correspondence in his excellent notes on the poem in the OC. See the works by Pommier, Leakey, and especially Eigeldinger in notes 2 and 4. 6 Ibid., p. 842.</page><page sequence="8">M L N 555 lairean version of correspondence. At a greater distance from his sources for the doctrine of correspondence (Fourier, Swedenborg, Romantic synaesthesia, Hoffmann, and the echos of scientific stud- ies of magnetism appearing in Poe and others) than Baudelaire's prose evocations, the text of the poem is the most essentially Baudelairean account of correspondence. It does not lay claim to forebears or relations, to transcendence, nor to reconciliation or complementarity between the sensual and the spiritual. In it reigns the most extreme conceptual "verborgene Figur" of the inhumanly irreconcilable: the aporia. One of the rhetorical counterparts of aporia in Baudelaire is the figure of the oxymoron, often combined with "comme," the prep- osition of resemblance that shapes Baudelaire's similes. In the lines "Dans une tenebreuse et profonde unite / Vaste comme la nuit et comme la clarte," conceptual and figural contradiction plunge the claim for unity into a bottomless shadowy abyss. The responses ("se repondent") of the following line (1.8, the final line of the octave) present a complex gathering-together that does not make claims for unity, and the sestet that concludes Baudelaire's sonnet defin- itively subverts any claim for unity in the second quatrain by em- phasizing the categorical break that occurs within correspondence when perfumes are divided into "des parfums" and "d'autres." In the tenth chapter of UEM, Benjamin quotes only the first two stanzas of the poem. In chapter XI, he repeats lines 3 and 4, but he does not quote the sestet that forms the second part of the poem.7 The sestet seems to represent a demonstration in figural terms of the problematics of correspondence that unfold in the octave; the sestet ostensibly focuses on one element of the correspondences- the perfumes-in an illustration of the essential relationship be- tween the verbs of the second quatrain: se confondent and se repon- dent. The two verbs combine to form a hidden figure for the noun that does not explicitly (or visibly) descend from the title into the text: correspondances. The two verbs form an anagram of corre- sponding: se correspondent. The last words in the poem, "des sens," complete the concealed anagram of "correspondances." The em- phasis on the senses at the end of the sonnet subverts the hierar- chical organization of the mystical transports of correspondence: this subversion originates in Baudelaire's twist on the Baroque split 7 In the essay on Wagner, Baudelaire quotes the octave of his sonnet without the sestet. See OC II, p. 784.</page><page sequence="9">556 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN between body and soul. His inversion of the vertical movement skyward confirms his emphasis of the "other perfumes": masked by the enigmatic and festive tones of the poem, Baudelaire's per- fumes of corruption-secretly infiltrate the rhetorical and specula- tive structure of the correspondences.8 The term of "secret architecture"9 enters Benjamin's reading through the figures of modern city life that are concealed in the Fleurs du mal. He writes: "Wenn es eine geheime Architektur dieses Buches, der viele Spekulationen gewidmet worden sind, wirklich gibt, so diirfte der Gedichtkreis, der den Band eroffnet, einem unwiederbringlich Verlorenen gewidmet sein [If there really is a secret architecture in this book, to which much speculation was dedicated, then the opening cycle of poems would probably be dedicated to something irretrievably lost]" (X 638). Benjamin uses the correspondences to develop the connection between secret ar- chitecture and the objects of loss.10 His reading of the image of "secret architecture" displaces the question of the structure of the Fleurs du mal by evoking the structuring net of experience. The image of secret architecture resonates as a description of the cor- respondences, and links them to the Baudelairean city. The epithet can be turned around: correspondence is also an architecture of secrets, according to the enigmatic forest of symbols in the first quatrain. The correspondences arise from that enigmatic forest like ciphers and anagrammatized names that suddenly come into focus in the poem. The anagram of correspondence that connects the verbs of the second quatrain with the senses of the last line of the sonnet indicates that the specific poetics of "Correspondances" substantiate Benjamin's general comments about "Chiffre" and "Anagram." La Nature The figures that emerge in Benjamin's reading of Baudelaire tend toward the secret encounters, the mysterious appearances, and the 8 It would seem that transcendence is offered to the subject of Baudelaire's "Cor- respondances," but in fact it is surreptitiously denied. I have discussed this question in detail elsewhere. 9 The highly Baudelairean expression appears in Barbey's justificatory article written in 1857 at Baudelaire's request.

In Benjamin's translation, Baudelaire's "soubresauts de la conscience" become "Chocks des BewuBtseins [shocks of conscious- ness]": Benjamin locates the conflict between Nature (in the cor- respondences) and its renunciation in the struggles of city life, in Baudelairean modernity, and in the poetics of the Fleurs du mal. He writes: "Die Absage an das 'Natiirliche' ist zuvor-im Zusammen- hang mit der GroBstadt als dem Sujet des Dichters-zu behandeln [the refusal of the 'natural' is to be treated first, in connection with the big city as the subject of the poet]" (ZP 7). Within the larger secret architecture of Benjaminian allegory, the correspondences mysteriously shape experience, at the cross- roads of the modern city and the poetics of the Fleurs du mal. In the passages and public gardens, at the Parisian borderlines of nature and artifice, the secret architecture of loss to which Benjamin ded- icates "Spleen et ideal," the first cycle of the Fleurs, is figured in the widows, the poets without their aureoles, the exiles, outlaws, and prostitutes, and many others as well. They have nothing left but the memories that shape their secret architecture of loss and the mo- dernity that deprives them of cult and Aura. In modernity, time is short and experience is meager: Erfahrung shrinks to Erlebnis, i.e., authentic experience shrinks to the mere registering of events as the shocks and traumas of city life. Modern city dwellers have been thrown out of church, family, time, and the calendar: they have been exiled from experience (X). At the heart of Benjamin's read- ing of modernity, the passage about Nature quoted in my epigraph silently asks this question: how is it possible to reconcile the riches and feast-days of the correspondences with the deprivation of ex- perience that afflicts the inhabitants of modernity? In the poetics of the irretrievably lost, the only access to Nature leads through the secret architecture of refusal or renunciation, the uncanniness of the familiar, and the destruction of Aura. Baudelaire's Nature in "Correspondances" is not natural; it is a temple, an architectonic evocation of cult. Its pillars are alive, and their live forms compose a forest of symbols. Baudelaire overturns the forest-cathedral conceits of French Romanticism and the Ro- mantic subordination of allegory (as unnatural monumental form, as petrification, and as the absence of the object rendered) to the symbol (as the natural, organic, and translucent presence of the</page><page sequence="11">558 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN object that is captured by the image).11 Baudelaire's temple/ cathedral becomes a forest ... of symbols, not trees, or if they are trees, then only as living ... pillars. Nature is given the capital letter of allegory, but its abstract and impersonal form hovers in the poem as a strange temple of living death. The forest does not provide an organic guarantee for the architecture of religion; the forest is already a figure that has renounced the natural qualities of forests. It is a forest of symbols. Even the seemingly straightforward "vivant" of organic existence loses its illusory Romantic qualities of immediacy, simplicity, and naturalness. Baudelaire's text develops the line of the "vivant" with two illustrations of the unnatural: 1) the enigmatic speech of "pa- roles confuses," related to the verb "se confondent" of the corre- spondences in the following quatrain; and 2) the uncanny famil- iarity of the observing glances that are directed at man ("l'homme"). These glances continue their ambiguous mirroring in the ambiguity of the reflexive of "se repondent": do they answer each other? Do they echo themselves? The gaze of"l'homme" who looks at the symbol-forest is never described. He presumably sees them observing him, but that is not clear. The opening of the gaze characteristic of Aura (XI 646) seems to hover between the two quatrains before it disappears among the correspondences, or rather, before the correspondences absorb it into the present tense of unending time that reigns in "Correspondances." Benjamin's speculative reading of "Correspondances" begins in UEM X with Proust's incomparable reading of Baudelaire, and especially with his remarks on time. The experience that Benjamin calls "Erfahrung" refers here to Proust as Baudelaire's reader. Benjamin translates: "Die Zeit, sagt Proust, ist bei Baudelaire auf eine befremdende Art zerfallt; nur wenige seltene Tage tun sich auf; es sind bedeutende [Time, says Proust, is strangely cut up in Baudelaire; only a few rare days come to the surface; they are meaningful]" (637).12 Lifted to the light, the rare days of Baude- lairean time rise out of the unconscious, out of the lost time that 1 See Leakey, op. cit. and the fine reading of Baudelaire's return to Hugo in Culler, op. cit. On the question of allegory in modernism, see my books entitled Joyce's Catholic Comedy of Language (Madison: U of Wisconsin P, 1985) and The Orient of Style, op. cit. 12 "Le monde de Baudelaire est un etrange sectionnement du temps oi seuls de raresjours notables apparaissent" ("A Propos de Baudelaire" in Contre Sainte-Beuve, Eds. Pierre Clarac and Yves Sandre [Paris: Gallimard, 1971], p. 628).</page><page sequence="12">M L N 559 Benjamin evokes as time flowed past ("Verflossenes"). Proust's "strange sectioning of time" is translated with the neologistic con- struction of "ist zerfallt": something is felled or is cut to pieces, something is exploded and disintegrated. Benjamin reshapes Proust's words in view of the emerging violence of modernity, and especially the violence of modern temporality. Benjamin's quota- tion from Proust links the destruction of the dimension of authen- tic experience ("Erfahrung") with a lingering in the memory of certain key moments of experience-notable days, "bedeutende Tage." In the last lines of UEM, the sensation of the Modern that Baudelaire turns into poetry is unveiled as "die Zertriimmerung der Aura in Chockerlebnis [the destruction of Aura in the experi- ence of shock]" (XII 653). It is perhaps this violence that leads Benjamin to neologize the sectioning of time in Baudelaire with the explosive power of "ist zerfallt." For the moment, in X, he com- ments on Proust's Baudelairean days: "Es sind Tage des Eingeden- kens [These are days of remembrance]" (X 637). Proust's "section- nement" (the geometric or surgical cut) is radically intensified by Benjamin's translation: under the Proustian knife, the geometric or corporeal form of the object (time) is not menaced with the extreme powers of destruction that Benjamin finds in Baudelaire. Like the forest of "Correspondances," the apparent serenity of "Eingedenkens" conceals disturbing and infinite depths of nega- tivity. The power of destruction cuts time down like a tree, and then lifts its fragmented form out of the flowing away of the past so that it appears at the scene of the poem. Lifted into appearance from the Baudelairean depths of experience, sectioned time becomes the object of the gaze of "Eingedenkens" and the object of the poems' images of observing. Through the violent interruption of the ex- perience of lived time, the past is memorialized. In the terms of "Correspondances," the "vivant" becomes "pilier"; the "f6ret" be- comes a forest of "symboles." The petrified form of the monumen- tal pillar has been substituted for the living tree, and the living forest suddenly disappears into the artifice of metaphor that re- vises it as a collection of symbols rather than trees. The time of "Eingedenkens" constructs the temple of "Corre- spondances" out of Baudelaire's Nature: the abstraction of "La Nature" is a temple in the same way that the living trees are "vivants piliers." The starting point for Benjamin's speculation on the cor-</page><page sequence="13">560 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN respondences is the poetic equation of Nature and a space conse- crated to cult (religious worship or ritual) in Baudelaire's strange temple of correspondences. The correspondences form the secret architecture of the temple of "Eingedenkens"; transplanted from antiquity and detached from the nostalgia for paganism that haunted many of Baudelaire's contemporaries, Baudelaire's "tem- ple" is a temple of modernity, caught up in the renunciation of cult value.13 Benjamin pursues the question of the days of remembrance: "Was ihren Inhalt ausmacht, hat Baudelaire im Begriff der Cor- respondances festgehalten [Baudelaire preserved/formulated what makes up their content in the concept of the correspondances]" (X 638). Benjamin consistently maintains a categorical frame for the correspondences; he does not describe the content or identify the concept that takes possession of it. Benjamin merely indicates a relation between the concept of correspondence and the concepts of cult and modern beauty. His strategic distance from an attribu- tion of content to the correspondences remains within the frame of the arcades-a secret architecture of space, a temporality of "sec- tioned time," and a network of encounters. Benjamin's investigation resists the traditional attempts to attach correspondence to a specific mystical or Romantic content. This two-fold distantiation is anchored in Proust's reading of Baude- laire.14 Instead of beginning with Baudelaire's debt to tradition, Benjamin focuses on the most autonomous Baudelairean usage of "correspondances." Benjamin proceeds without the interpretive solution of a clearly labeled content; he states that the days of remembrance are conceptually "festgehalten." Benjamin's sen- tence leads the word in two directions: those days are preserved in memory, and formulated in poetic strategy. UEM holds fast to the hidden structures of memory and poetics, Baudelaire's two-fold secret architecture. UEM seeks to decode the correspondences as an aporia that will never be solved (or trans- 13 See X 638-39. Benjamin is not very explicit about the role of the temple, but he is explicit about the break between "Kult" and "Kunst." "Absage" is both refusal and renunciation; Benjamin incorporates its resonances in his reading of "perdu" (X 641). 14 Benjamin does not discuss the development in the Recherche of certain elements of the tradition, especially the romantics' understanding of synaesthesia, in the contexts of twentieth-century fiction. Benjamin's reading underscores the differ- ences between contemporary doctrine and Baudelaire's correspondences.</page><page sequence="14">M L N 561 lated) in the terms of unity and complementarity. Benjamin's path through the arcades of the correspondences follows Baudelaire's account of the labyrinth of modernity; without unity, without es- cape, the subject maps out the "croisements" of "'homme y passe a travers... ." The "croisements" in question are the encounters that hold fast to history and poetics, to memory and formulation. The paragraph that includes the two quatrains of "Correspon- dances" includes Benjamin's speculative reflection on (and of) Baudelaire's text. The difficult poem does not receive a commen- tary on its poetic motif; rather, the question of motif enters the text from the wings of Benjamin's reflection. Moved and motivated by the strange reflection within Baudelaire's poem, Benjamin's sen- tences offer the most explicit account of the crossings of modernity in UEM. Benjamin unveils these "croisements" as the secret archi- tecture of the correspondences. Im Begriff der Correspondances Benjamin insists on a conceptual frame of experience: "Wesentlich ist, daB die correspondances einen Begriff der Erfahrung fest- halten, der kultische Elemente in sich schlieBt [It is essential that the correspondances preserve a concept of experience that in- cludes cultic elements]" (X 638). The tightly constructed sequence of sentences about correspondence begins with the "Tage des Eingedenkens." Benjamin diagnoses the content of these days as one of the enigmatic empty spaces of modernity that Baudelaire has preserved, formulated, and 'taken up' ("im Begriff der corre- spondances festgehalten" [638]). Benjamin's terms immediately be- gin to shift into a new set of positions, or a new constellation; the concept of correspondence enters into a concept of experience ("Erfahrung") that includes cultic elements. In UEM and other texts, the cultic is central to the enigmatic empty space of modernity. The sentence repeats the verb "fest- halten" that the sentence about the content of the days of remem- brance (637) attached to its subject, Baudelaire: in the concept of the correspondences, the poet preserved and formulated the con- tent (or its qualifier) of those days lifted out of time. The cult- related "fullness" of these days (associated with Joubert's perfect- ing time [637]) is related to the time-construction (another image of</page><page sequence="15">562 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN architecture?) of history; it is contrasted in UEM with the empti- ness produced by the traumatic shock-giving character of modern city life and the impoverished state of cult-value in modernity.15 In Benjamin's rewriting of Proust's account, a cut or an incision subjects Baudelaire's strangely privileged days to a Fall or an ex- plosion; it causes them to fall out of time, or perhaps it is time itself that falls to pieces. Benjamin qualifies his strange translation with a Proustian turn, "lifting these days out of the flow of time" char- acterized by "Erlebnis." These days of "Erfahrung [experience]," "Eingedenkens [remembrance]," and Joubert's completing or per- fecting time are lifted out of time ("heben sich .. . aus der Zeit heraus") with the same motif of upward movement that Proust attributes to the Narrator's tumultuous rise of involuntary memory in the Recherche. It is also the motion of things rising out of the Baudelairean abyss. The discussion of "kultische Elemente" continues: "Nur indem er sich diese Elemente zu eigen machte, konnte Baudelaire voll ermessen, was der Zusammenbruch eigentlich bedeutete, dessen er, als ein Moderner, Zeuge war [Only by taking possession of these elements could Baudelaire fully understand the meaning of the collapse that, as a Modern, he was witnessing]" (638). "Out of the unconscious," Benjamin writes, "Proust lifts past things, sated with reminiscences, to the light" (X 637). Both Baudelaire and Proust lift things to the Freudian light: Benjamin develops this praxis as the writer's task of "festhalten"-to preserve and to formulate, to engrave in the memory and to graphematically appropriate, to fix, to write out, to set down, and to inscribe. Benjamin's Baudelaire is at the cusp of a paradox: although the cultic elements are destroyed by modernity (in the "Zusammen- bruch"), Baudelaire-witness "as a Modern" to the collapse-had to take possession of those elements. Like the other aporetic mo- ments of UEM, Benjamin's sentence develops the tension and par- adoxical doubleness of "Absage." Renunciation locates the subject of experience on the edge, at the borderlines and thresholds that became the pretexts (and texts) of the articulations of modernity.16 15 The extensive discussion of "Chock" in UEM develops Baudelairean observa- tions in the context of Benjamin's reading of Freud's Beyond the Pleasure Principle. For Benjamin's remarks about perfecting time, see Ober den Begriff der Geschichte XIV, XV. 16 See Rainer Nigele, "Das Beben des Barock in der Moderne: Walter Benjamins Monadologie" in MLN 106 (1991): 501-27.</page><page sequence="16">M L N 563 The implied paradox is woven into all of Benjamin's writings on Baudelaire; it originates in an enduring refusal to enter into spec- ulation. These moments of renunciation set the stage of UEM in Baudelaire's resemblance to his readers, whose speculative powers are limited by their susceptibility to spleen and their preference for sensual pleasures rather than intellectual stimulation. In Baudelaire's case, this speculative refusal is political and his- torical as well as theoretical. Zentralpark makes it clear that Baude- laire's use of the correspondences excludes dialectic (29) and any possible connection to the doctrine of allegory (24); Das Paris des Second Empire bei Baudelaire indicates that Baudelaire's political fo- cus is limited to the single stage of conspiracy (and its modern hero, Blanqui).17 Benjamin's evocation of Baudelaire's anger in the last lines of UEM IX, prior to the discussion of the correspondences, is recalled in the final paragraph of UEM as the powerless anger of someone walking against rain or wind (652). This image bears Ben- jamin's judgment that the poet of modernity walks outside dialec- tic, against dialectic: "Fur den Dialektiker kommt es darauf an, den Wind der Weltgeschichte in den Segeln zu haben [The dialectician depends on having the wind of world history in his sails]" (ZP 23). Baudelaire faces in the wrong direction: he turns his back on the future and sees progress as an enormous catastrophe and a grow- ing pile of ruins. Angelus Novus-Benjamin's reading of Klee's painting-is cast in the role of Baudelaire.18 The single catastrophe glimpsed by the angel of history is intimately related to the insight of the angry, despairing poet.19 History itself goes underground, to join the conspirators. While Benjamin sees Baudelaire as non- dialectic and non-revolutionary, he nevertheless envisions Baude- laire as the writer who goes further than any other (even Proust) in the depth and acuteness of his written account of modernity. Baudelaire accomplishes this task not because he speculates on modernity but because he holds fast, in writing, to the experience of his readers that is evoked in the first lines of UEM. The paradox of "Absage" and speculation resonates on the level of cult as well as on the level of poetics. The collapse that Baude- 17 I have discussed Baudelaire's politics and Benjamin's remarks on his relation- ship to conspiracy (as well as Benjamin's reading of allegory through Marx, Blanqui, and Baudelaire) elsewhere. 18 See Uber den Begiff der Geschichte ix, in Benjamin, 1,2 697-98. 19 See ZP 22.

Parisian modernity is the theater of the "croisements" in the eva- nescent streets, arcades, and labyrinths subject to destruction. Haussmann erases the architectural elements of the Baudelairean memory-stage: buildings and streets vanish like distant and lost lovers. Aura decays, cult and tradition evaporate, and the identity of the lyric poet fades into the masses. Aura, "the unique appari- tion of a distant reality" (XI 647), seems to enter Benjamin's thought as an object of Baudelaire's poetic calculation:20 Aura suf- fers from the "Zusammenbruch" witnessed by Baudelaire the "Moderner" who fully measures it ("voll ermessen"). Measure, reckoning, and calculation conclude UEM with the Law ("Gesetz") of his poetry. The poetic measure of Baudelaire's lyric appraises the loss suffered by the exiles who dwell in modernity. Baudelaire's measuring distances his work from the Romantic nostalgias that occupied many of his contemporaries; their enthusiastic affirma- tions of cult ranged from paganism, pantheism, and transmigra- tion to the black Christianity of Barbey d'Aurevilly. Baudelaire's poetic law functions as a paradoxical interiorizing of cult elements within a lyric oeuvre that measures their impossibility. The act of measuring occurs in the labyrinths of Baudelairean passion, both spleenetic and ideal, when the poet puts out the lights: "la nuit s'epaississait ainsi qu'une cloison."21 Benjamin articulates Baudelaire's understanding of the corre- spondences in the realm of experience that UEM explores as cult: "Was Baudelaire mit den correspondances im Sinn hatte, kann als eine Erfahrung bezeichnet werden, die sich krisensicher zu etablieren sucht. Moglich ist sie nur im Bereich des Kultischen [What Baudelaire had in mind with the correspondances can be designated as an experience that tries to establish itself immune to crisis. It is possible only in the realm of the cultic]" (X 638). The knot of ceremony, celebration, and tradition that Benjamin calls the cultic begins "Correspondances": "La Nature est un temple. . .." The smooth and uneventful flow of verbs in the present tense in "Correspondances" is the present tense of ritual; the verse that includes those verbs speaks for a being that is neither clearly indi- 20 "Poetic calculation," an important term in Benjamin, leads back to Holderlin.

An experience that would be imper- vious to crisis is foreign to the experience of Benjamin's city dweller and Baudelaire's reader. If loss (the "perdu") represents an essen- tial element of modernity, and if it is emblematized by the jolts and blows of city traffic and its passersby, then "krisensicher" evokes a pre-modern state of experience or a modern reminiscence of it. Modernity undermines the cult value of experience, its temporal stability, and the stability of tradition: in UEM, progress is repre- sented by destruction and "Chock." The calendar surrenders its time, marked by the return of holidays, to the time-clock and the second hand of Baudelaire's "L'Horloge."22 "Correspondances" provides an aesthetic access to the kind of experience that has been lost, or at least it offers an account of it in sensual terms. Baude- laire's sonnet rejects the transcendence that is associated with mys- tical correspondence. The representation of cult in the poem re- mains completely enigmatic; the aesthetic presentation that Ben- jamin posits beyond cult is subtly inscribed in the last line, with its lyric rendering of ecstatic "transports." The poem celebrates sen- sation and sensuality in an aesthetic form of identification without a subject; it responds to some mysterious authority that Benjamin calls "Instanz." Baudelaire transforms the spleen and trauma of modernity into a pretext for poetic celebration; "Correspon- dances" shapes the irretrievable loss to which Benjamin dedicates Baudelaire's "spleen et ideal" into a poetic celebration that sings the transports of the spirit and the senses. "Correspondances" is the quintessential Flower of Evil-it celebrates corruption as the es- sence of the correspondences and the ideal of modernity. Benjamin locates the authority of "Instanz" in the correspon- dences: "Die correspondances stellen die Instanz dar, vor der der Gegenstand der Kunst als ein treulich abzubildender, dadurch al- lerdings durch und durch aporetischer, vorgefunden wird [The correspondances represent the authority before which is found the object of art as that which is to be faithfully imitated, but is there- fore thoroughly aporetic] (X n. 639). Like the cult object, the object of art is subjected to a kind of taboo: the object remains at a dis- tance from the perceiving subject. The object is not phenomenally given. It is offered as an emblem for the authority that is divine and taboo in cult, but aesthetic and ideal in the art of "le beau mod- erne." Whether the "Gegenstand" is the object or the objective of 22 See IX 636.</page><page sequence="19">566 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN art, its faithful mimetic character seems to be neutralized by the correspondences. In a letter to Toussenel, Baudelaire's challenge to Fourierist doc- trine includes the following remark: "La Nature est un verbe, une allegorie, un moule, un repousse."23 The tension between these ir- reconcilable terms reflects the tensions of the sonnet that posits the origin of Baudelaire's statement: "La Nature est. ..." The break that Benjamin points out between correspondence and allegory (in ZP 24) adumbrates a reading of the aporetic dimension of art as the split between the mimetic and the hieroglyphic elements of Baude- laire's aesthetics. This break is aporetic because the "Instanz"-the authority of the artistic object(ive)-is involved in two mutually exclusive programs: 1) a mimesis based on the corresponding re- producibilities of the senses and on the complex of sensuality and sensitivity; and 2) the non-mimetic and contemplative presenta- tions of allegory-its violent attack on unity and transparency- based on gaps in meaning and intrusions of form. The break be- tween body ("les sens") and mind ("l'esprit") that ends the poem gives an account of the split between correspondences and allegory that leaves its traces in UEM. If on the other hand, "Correspondances" enacts allegory's vio- lent break with the immediacy, organic naturalness, and translu- cence of the Romantic symbol, then it might be impossible to con- fine the correspondences to the sensual realm. In this case, Ben- jamin's use of the term of aporia must lead in another direction-to the aporetic quality of allegory itself. The object of allegorical art is paradoxical or even virtual: the object is never there. In its place is an appearance. The object of allegorical presentation cannot be defined, nor can its artistic representation be rendered transcen- dent. Benjamin refers to the aporetic when he shifts to the question of language and the problem of similarity ("Ahnlichseins") raised by the question of the object of experience. If this object is the beautiful, as Benjamin claims, then in the Baudelairean context it must be "le beau moderne" that unfolds throughout his oeuvre. The beautiful of modernity is allegorical: its modern status turns the idea of beauty into an allegorical construct. Violent and mel- ancholic, it depicts things that no longer exist; it celebrates corrup- tion; it commemorates death; it hunts out the traces of that which has been lost forever. 23 Letter dated January 1865 in Correspondance (Paris: Bibl. de la P16iade, 1976), vol. I, pp. 336-337.</page><page sequence="20">M L N 567 Benjamin's principle of similarity might lead back to the secret architecture of Baudelaire's endless "comme": the preposition of resemblance in the Fleurs du mal marks a likeness of something that is not like anything else. Paul de Man's acute reading of the shift from the "comme" of similarity to the final "comme" of enumera- tion in "Correspondances" points in the direction of an opening- out (or a flowering) of difference: a "comme" that is not "comme les autres."24 This final "comme" confirms the differentiation be- tween "some perfumes" and "others": Baudelaire's subversion of traditional correspondence depends on it. The "autres" that bear the weight of the sestet of "Correspon- dances" are perfumed with the alterity or otherness of allegory. The correspondences elaborate an artistic principle of similarity on the ground of differences that include art vs. cult, beauty vs. na- ture, and the allegory of death vs. the irretrievable life of the past. Benjamin articulates the aporia of the correspondences: "das Schone zu bestimmen als den Gegenstand der Erfahrung im Stande des Ahnlichseins [to define the beautiful as the object of experience in a state of similarity]" (X 639). Allegory maps out the differences, and the authority of the correspondences posits simi- larity as a poetic rhetoric that cannot cancel them out. Is it then the rhetoric of the correspondences that functions as Benjamin's veil, enigmatically placed between the beautiful and its relation to Nature? "Die Correspondenzen geben Auskunft darii- ber, was unter solcher Verhiillung sei [The correspondences indi- cate how this veil can be conceived of]" (639). According to this remark, the constellation of the correspondences in the Fleurs du mal implicates the following elements: 1) Beauty marks the place of art as that which is beyond the cultic realm of experience; 2) Beauty marks the place of nature in it as non-natural, i.e., veiled in an artistic semblance of nature; and 3) the full sense of experience (linked to cult) is mapped out in the terms of spleen and ideal as the poetic space of the irretrievable. This constellation marks Ben- jamin's reading of Baudelairean allegory. "Tout pour moi devient allegorie"25 is the emblem of the Fleurs du mal as an extended swan song-the almost exclusive object of Baudelaire's poetic energy (XII 651), the last book of lyric poetry, in Benjamin's eyes, and perhaps the only truly modern one. 24 Paul de Man, op. cit., pp. 248-250. 25 See Frey, op. cit., pp. 72-78, and Chambers, op. cit. I have discussed this line from "Le Cygne" in the framework of modernist allegories of conversion in The Orient of Style.</page><page sequence="21">568 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN At the end-point of Benjamin's disseminated sequence of sen- tences about the correspondences, he decisively identifies them as the data of remembrance with the neologistic nominal form of "Eingedenkens": "Die correspondances sind die Data des Einge- denkens [The correspondences are the data of remembrance]" (X 639). The inwardness of "Eingedenkens" would seem to be closer to the interiority of allegorical contemplation and the fading away of the appearances of the irretrievable than to the sensitivity and the sensual stimuli that are highlighted in the second part of "Cor- respondances" (as in other poems that celebrate the powers of the correspondences). The break between an apparent immediacy of perception and a complex, distanced relation to past time vividly recalls the split in "Correspondances" between the sensual and the spiritual. The sentence that follows the "Data des Eingedenkens" further complicates the relations that are at stake in them: "Sie sind keine historischen, sondern Data dere Vorgeschichte [They are not his- torical, but are the data of prehistory]" (X 639). In the single mod- ern poetic oeuvre that willed and understood itself as an historical work (III), remembrance tests the depths of prehistory rather than history. The correspondences support the encounter with an ear- lier life that once was offered by the holidays of the cultic calendar: they are no longer available to the latter-day Baudelairean inhab- itant of modernity. Benjamin interprets Baudelaire's correspon- dences as the modern and historical appearance of an experience that modernity and history have banished forever. As prehistory, the correspondences provide a third temporal category to add to the two categories that Benjamin draws out of nineteenth-century allegory: classical antiquity and Parisian modernity. Nature enters the Baudelairean time-frame as the enigmatic data of memory in prehistory. "Correspondances" writes the text for it. Neither clas- sical nor modern in language and form, these data are symbolic, hieroglyphic, foreign, indecipherable, and occult: Baudelaire al- lows the term of "familiers" to encode their uncanny quality.26 They look at us from beyond the limits drawn by modernity. UJber einige Motive Benjamin interprets the correspondences within a frame of motifs and motives that function as the elements of a secret architecture. 26 For Benjamin's reading of "familiers" see XI 649 and ZP 30.</page><page sequence="22">M L N 569 His quotations from Baudelaire's poems are neither subsumed to a literary historical classification of motif and meaning, nor are they presented as objects of formal construction that illustrate a con- cept. Benjamin's quotations preserve their autonomy within UEM; most of them, however, appear in fragments. Given the impor- tance of "Correspondances" in the argument of UEM, it is striking that Benjamin does not quote the tercets. In his remarks on the two sonnets, he quotes approximately one stanza from "La Vie An- terieure." Baudelaire's texts go underground in UEM, where Ben- jamin's quotations recall the minimum that is necessary to reveal the outlines of motif as secret architecture. Within the cycle of "Spleen et Ideal" that is dedicated, says Ben- jamin, to the irretrievably lost ("unwiederbringlich Verlorenen"), "fall two sonnets that are identical in their motifs" (X 638). Ben- jamin is probably the first reader to have considered the identity of these two poems. Their identity is posited on the basis of his read- ing of correspondence, in spite of the differences in content and inner tensions that unfold in the two poems. At what point does Baudelairean "correspondance" join Benjaminian "Ahnlichseins"? The likeness of the two poems can be understood in the context of Baudelaire's motif of secret architecture. Its mastery over Baude- lairean cityscapes and decors leads down to the abyss of Zentralpark: in an echo of ZP 1, I would argue that the beauty of the two sonnets is particularly linked to their emergence from the abyss. This par- ticularity is common to the two poems: each one posits an "Auf- tauchen aus dem Abgrunde" not only as a first line, but also (and more specifically) in the relation of the entire sonnet to the blank space that conceptually and formally surrounds it. Each of the two poems elaborates a secret architecture of prehistory that both lit- erally and figuratively structures and shapes the poetic text. But the essential identity that Benjamin discovers is not the whole story of where he wants to take the two poems; Benjamin does not tell the whole story of the relation between them. The traces of the undivulged account of a mysterious "Ahnlichkeit" lead to the remarks on "La Vie Anterieure" that point toward the elements of a reading of "Correspondances." Within both poems, correspondence emerges from the Baude- lairean abyss, the zone of spleen and ideal that Benjamin marks as the site of the "forever lost." The correspondences represent the lost red-letter days of cult and "Eingedenkens" in modern poetic form. Through it, Baudelaire the Modern takes poetic power over</page><page sequence="23">570 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN the realm of his dispossession. The correspondences establish their own law of mastery over differences. They map out the paradox- ical identity of irreconcilable opposites-including the spiritual and the sensual; prehistory and modernity; nature and non-nature (the city); the familiar and the uncanny, occult, or undecipherable; and "Spleen et Ideal," or the irretrievably lost and the poetic "trans- ports" that reclaim it as a figure of secrecy and an image of cor- ruption. Shaped by the correspondences that join the two poems, these paradoxical oppositions make their first appearances in "Corre- spondances" as a scene in Nature and a familiar gaze. Benjamin reads these elements through the strangely familiar observation of a Nature scene that dominates "La Vie Anterieure." He evokes this observation as "the encounter with an earlier life" (X 639). La Vie Anterieure Marked with the capital letter of allegory, the Nature of "Corre- spondances" is an unspecified temple of live pillars that allow con- fused or murmured speech to detach itself from them. The poem does not personalize their mode of speech. Benjamin's previous evocation of the crowd gives a clue to the interpretation of this enigmatic line and its Nature: "In dieser Masse sich zu bewegen, war dem Pariser etwas Natiirliches [Moving through the crowd was something natural for the Parisian]" (V 620). "Coudoye par les foules," the Parisian moves through the forest of artifices and con- structions that are the background for the crowd. Through Baude- laire's gaze, Benjamin sees the streets and arcades of the city as the point of origin for the temple of Nature in "Correspondances." Its architecture of pillars, indistinguishable utterances, and symbols that seem to flee interpretation is much closer to the arcades filled with "passants" than the "natural" scenery of the poem (and its discreet allusions to Romantic imagery) would admit to the reader. In the chapter of UEM that explicitly discusses "Correspondances," Benjamin makes the connection between the scene of Nature and the vanished constructions of Paris, lamented by Baudelaire's fig- ures of irretrievable loss. In an essay on Marceline Desbordes-Valmore's poetry, Baude- laire's image of loss draws Nature into a scenario of mourning; the tears that Benjamin attributes to "homesickness" enter Baudelaire's</page><page sequence="24">M L N 571 text through an evocation of an imaginary garden. In Benjamin's brief quotation, the garden does not appear-perhaps it blends into the scenery of "La Vie Anterieure." But Benjamin's commen- tary turns back to the correspondences: "Vergangenes murmelt in den Entsprechungen mit; und die kanonische Erfahrung von ih- nen hat selber ihre Stelle in einem friheren Leben [Past things murmur along in the correspondences, and the canonical experi- ence of them itself has its place in an earlier life]" (X 640). The banishment of the correspondences to a lost past places the expe- rience of Eingedenkens at an additional remove from the subject of modernity. This second distantiation is encoded as the "longtemps" that begins "La Vie Anterieure": "J'ai longtemps habite sous de vastes portiques." Proust's famous "petite phrase" that begins the Recherche borrows this "longtemps" from Baudelaire: the past things that murmur along in the dream thoughts of the narrator on the opening pages of Proust's novel will be revealed later as the lost past and the site of the unknown correspondences that are required to link the threads of the past into an authentic experi- ence of time.2 The tears of mourning that Baudelaire situates in the imaginary garden of Desborde-Valmore's verse are cried by a "promeneur." Baudelaire's walker in gardens, his passerby of Nature, is strangely translated by Benjamin as "Der Wanderer": like Holderlin's figures of the speaking I, the homeless hero of modernity utters lamenta- tions of homesickness. Time has intervened, and the mourner dis- closes the "Heimweh" that leads to allegory: "le vieux Paris n'est plus." Nature has dissolved into the cityscape: Baudelaire's "promeneur" is more of a "passant" than a "Wanderer." In the temple of artifice that Baudelaire calls "La Nature," the murmur- ing along of past time is inaccessible outside of the artistic frame of the correspondences. Strangely symbolic, charged with untold meaning, these occasional words ("paroles") banish the mythical immediacy of Nature. The earlier life that appears in the artful and artistic form of "Les houles . . ." confirms Benjamin's reading of a double distancing of experience that requires the secret formula of the correspondences for its recapture. He quotes the stanza: Les houles, en roulant les images des :cieux, Melaient d'une fa~on solennelle et mystique 27 See The Orient of Style, op. cit.</page><page sequence="25">572 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN Les tout-puissants accords de leur riche musique Aux couleurs du couchant reflete par mes yeux. The waves, in rolling the images of skies, Would blend in a solemn and mystical way The all-powerful chords of their rich music with colors of sunset reflected in my eyes. The Nature of this poem is an artful paradise of auditory and visual images composed of musical chords that merge with the shifting colors of sunset: the speaking I of the poem becomes the site for a synaesthetic exchange (correspondence) of sea and sky, of sound and color, and of musical and mystical occurrences. More precisely, it is the reflecting eyes of the subject that operate these correspondences, captured in the brace rhyme of "cieux" and "yeux" (as in the "mystique" / "musique" rhyme that it encloses). The reflection of these eyes makes them the focal point of corre- spondence; the inner reflection of the speaking I who is steeped in mourning locates their experience in the old days and the old magical landscape of "La Vie Anterieure" and its allegory. Baudelaire discreetly draws together the threads of this watery landscape in the only other line of the poem that Benjamin quotes: "C'est la que j'ai vecu [That is where I lived]." Certain elements of this landscape recall the image of Desborde-Valmore's poetry as an unnatural ("romantique et romanesque") garden, the unnatural water implored by a literary swan, and the theater set of Andro- maque's mourning that even includes a fake river (the "Simois menteur"). But the water of the stanza that Benjamin quotes from "La Vie Anterieure" is the scene of a more immediate theater of cultic repetitions than the invocation of Andromaque mourning for Hector in the allegorical imagination of "Le Cygne" 's narrator. The two scenes have in common a temporal line, drawn between a darkened, vague moment in the present and the haunting evoca- tion of a moment limited to the past. This moment unfolds in the present time of contemplative evo- cation, "en esprit," and not in the present tense of "Erfahrung." Unlike the double time frame of "La Vie Anterieure," "Correspon- dances" displays its identification in the present tense of "festlichen Tage," the red-letter days of cult celebration. But since that cele- bration characterizes an encounter with the past that Benjamin marks as prehistoric, Benjamin shows that the correspondences cannot be dissociated from the past and its enigmatic spoken traces.</page><page sequence="26">M L N 573 Although Benjamin does not discuss the question of the present tense in Baudelaire's "Correspondances," he posits the essential presence of past things in them: "Simultane Korrespondenzen . . . gibt es nicht [There are no simultaneous correspondences]" (X 640). Man passes through the symbol-forests of this singular Nature. In the second clause of "Correspondances," "La Nature" is reduced to the adverbial pronoun "y" that serves as its place-marker. Baudelaire's Nature is a site of passage that is like an arcade; Ben- jamin's Passagen work will figure its "passant" in cultural and in- tellectual constellations. Clustered in "La Nature" 's thick forests of allegory, the "symboles" are hidden figures that look at the pass- erby with the inhuman eyes ("illumines ainsi que des boutiques"!) of Baudelaire's "femme impure." "L'homme y passe": he is as anonymous as the man in the crowd, who is observed by the eyes of other anonymous beings or by the shop windows illuminating the arcades. The strange image (from "Tu mettrais l'univers entier dans ta ruelle")28 of eyes lit up like boutiques holds the enigmatic gaze of the Modern (Benjamin's "Moderner"), the gaze that fleetingly rests on it in the arcades and streets of Paris. "La Vie Anterieure" conceals similar hidden fig- ures in the lines that Benjamin does not quote. He merely alludes to the first stanza: "Die Bilder der Grotten und der Gewachse, der Wolken und der Wogen, die der Beginn dieses zweiten Sonetts heraufruft [The images of grottoes and plant growth, clouds and waves, that the beginning of this sonnet calls up]" (X 640). Ben- jamin does not mention the pillars and porticos that bring the poem closer to the secret architecture of "Correspondances": J'ai longtemps habite sous de vastes portiques Que les soleils marins teignaient de mille feux, Et que leurs grands piliers, droits et majestueux Rendaient pareils, le soir, aux grottes basaltiques. The vivid imagery of the past is intensified by the abyss of lost time, discreetly figured by the basalt grottoes. The secret architecture of the past is projected even further back into the past, in "a thousand fires": the covered passages of basalt are formed in volcanic erup- tions. Like the temple, pillars, and forest of "Correspondances," the "vast porticoes" and "straight majestic pillars" are hidden fig- 28 Les Fleurs du Mal XXV. See UEM 649.</page><page sequence="27">574 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN ures for Baudelairean city architecture, and especially for its par- ticular combination of an open-air street and a covered, enclosed space lined with rows of pillars: the arcades. Benjamin evokes the "Bilder" only to point out the nostalgic longing that connects the evocation of earlier life (in Baudelaire's somewhat melodramatic "hysterical tears") to the correspondences that Baudelaire spells out in the second quatrain of "La Vie An- terieure." The quotation of "C'est la quej'ai vecu" abruptly cuts the line in half. The "la" that pronominally refers to the waves and sunsets of Baudelairean Nature locates it in an indefinite past, but the lines that evoke the "canonical experience" of past things in an earlier life resound with the murmurings of the correspondences. Like the "y" of "Correspondances," the "la" of "La Vie Anterieure" replaces "La Nature" with the secret architecture of the correspon- dences. That is perhaps the narrator's painful secret at the end of "La Vie Anterieure": in a deep silence, the "secret douloureux" of the solitary narrator reveals him as a displaced "Moderner" with lost time on his hands. Aura: Regards Familiers The enigmatic Nature of "Correspondances" provides an unusual path into the problems of perception that play Bergson against Freud, against Baudelaire, and against Proust. Aura comes to Ben- jamin's text from the "piliers vivants," not the mythic nature of Lebensphilosophie. For a moment in UEM XI, Baudelaire's temple of Nature is tinged with the artifices of dream perception ("Traum- wahrnehmung" [XI 647]) when Benjamin observes that the "look- ing back of things" in Valery's remark on dream perception is auratic. This simple introduction to Aura becomes a preliminary for the repeated quotation of the lines from "Correspondances" that most profoundly affect Benjamin's thought: "L'homme y passe a travers des forets de symboles / Qui l'observent avec des regards familiers." In UEM, Baudelaire's sonnet emerges as the key text for the articulation of Aura. Through "Correspondances" and the concept of Aura that Benjamin finds in it, the aporetic domain of modern art explored in Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit joins the aporetic domain of Baude- lairean allegory in UEM. At the end of UEM, Benjamin reveals the</page><page sequence="28">M L N 575 Baudelairean motif as the figural counterpart of aporia: "Und end- lich ist nicht von der Hand zu weisen, daB unter seinen Motiven einige, von denen die vorliegende Untersuchung gehandelt hat, die M6glichkeit lyrischer Poesie problematisch machen [And fi- nally it cannot be denied that among his motifs are some, treated in the present essay, that problematize the possibility of lyrical po- etry]" (XII 651). As the figural counterpart of aporia, motif turns on the innocent-looking categories of Litteraturwissenschaft to de- vour them whole. In UEM, the question of the motif ultimately turns lyrical poetry around. Benjamin drops the "Traumwahrnehmung" and returns to the Baudelairean paradoxes, the border region of experience earlier located in the "perdu" and the poetic access to something irretriev- ably lost. When this aporia of loss is translated into the dimension of perception, it produces the problem of Aura, "the unique ap- pearance of a distance" (XI 647), that has decayed into "Der Verfall der Aura." The enigmatic components of Aura-looking and be- ing looked at from a distance, and a gaze that is met (or countered) by the gaze that it has aroused in things-originate in lines 3 and 4 of "Correspondances." Aura is offered to us as Baudelaire's read- ers in the form of its irretrievable (not to say eternal) loss and the irrevocable modernity of its "Verfall." The "regards" in "Corre- spondances" are "familiers": Benjamin's interpretation of their fa- miliarity is related to the conception of Aura. The secret that shapes the drama of "Correspondances" origi- nates in the strangeness and estrangement of Baudelaire's use of the word "familier." The word takes its place among the Baude- lairean hieroglyphs of the poem,29 and among the ciphers and hidden figures of modernity in the Fleurs du Mal. In lines 3 and 4 of "Correspondances," Nature elaborates the transfer between the figure of man and the symbols: empowered with Aura, their gaze lends them an anthropomorphic quality of vision. The auratic quality of the forest of symbols does not disclose any information, however; the function of Aura in these lines only adds to the mys- tery. Although the gaze of the symbol-forests is anthropomor- phized, there is no trace of communicative contact between the gaze and "l'homme." 29 See the "hi6roglyphe" of the prose poem entitled "Le Cr6puscule du Soir" (SP XXII).</page><page sequence="29">576 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN Lines 3 and 4 of "Correspondances" take the reader inside the secret architecture and along the corridors of the arcades. In the crowds that move among streetlights and shop windows, Baude- laire evokes the glances of strangers. The reader between the lines observes that these glances are routinely shocking because a mo- mentary physical proximity in the jostling crowd takes the form of an intrusive intimacy that suddenly opens into an observing gaze. The violent moment of voyeuristic intimacy clashes with the re- moteness, distance, and silence that are the consequences of unfa- miliarity: the "regards" of "Correspondances" establish a relation of visual images that is enacted within the total anonymity of the crowd. In the end, it is the anonymity that proves its powers; the glances of strangers are fleeting, and the auratic effect is limited by the unfamiliarity that reigns in the scene of the crowd. But in the poem, these glances are described as "familiar." The forest of symbols is endlessly enigmatic: in addition to the connec- tions between "foret" and "symboles" that orient the reading of "La Nature," the symbols are not attached to specific meanings in the poem. They are transformed anthropomorphically into a crowd that looks at "l'homme" with "regards familiers." The poetic nar- rator lends them the gazes of pointed perception or attention ("l'observent") that converge on the (hu)man; the narrator also attributes to them a familiarity-the habitual access of something repeated or already known-of visual contact. The rest of the poem puts this familiarity into question. Benjamin's conception of Aura develops the returning gaze of things that is aroused by certain glances. Things that receive the human possibility of looking back at the subject from a distance are also endowed with the anthropomorphic impact of a "familiar" gaze. The experience of Aura can be glimpsed in Baudelaire's figured turn from the inanimate to the uncanny: it occurs when the "regards" are described as "familiers." If Baudelaire's "Correspon- dances" can be seen as an articulation of the threshold between cult and beauty, and the borderline between Aura and its decay, then the correspondences offer to his readers the melted and reflecting motif of modernity that inhabits Les Fleurs du Mal. At these thresholds and borderlines, the secret architecture of UEM inscribes Aura as a mark of absence and loss. The doubleness of the "perdu" is reinscribed in the uncanny glance of "regards familiers." Benjamin remarks that "familiar" is a word subject to</page><page sequence="30">M L N 577 Baudelairean "VerheiBung und Verzicht" (XI 649); the familiar transforms ideal and spleen respectively into "promise and renun- ciation." In "La Vie Anterieure," the hieroglyphic moment, the "symbole" that cannot be deciphered, takes the form of a "secret douloureux qui me faisait languir." The secret is not disclosed: it marks the Baudelairean "perdu" with the renunciation and refusal that Benjamin sometimes calls "Absage," and it also marks the turning point, within the poem, of the ideal and the resounding promise of the correspondences to spleen and the mournful silence of renunciation. In "La Vie Anterieure," the secret architecture of the correspon- dences is related to the eyes of the narrator in the stanza that Benjamin quotes. These eyes reflect the promising correspon- dences and their connections to cult and beauty in the colors of sea and sky; the languishing gaze of these eyes also contains the hidden reflection on an undisclosed moment of renunciation that the poem evokes as the "secret douloureux." For the slaves attached to the narrator, the secret is uniquely familiar (as an "unique soin") and uniquely distanced (as an undecoded cipher or hieroglyph) in the life-emptied reflecting eyes of the speaker. The poem re- nounces the Romantic comforts of explaining nostalgia and telling secrets: the eyes of the speaker reflect the irretrievably lost as "der Verfall der Aura." Benjamin's suggestion that the two poems are identical in their motifs raises the possibility of a complicity between "spleen" and "ideal" that informs the secret architecture of the correspondences. In "La Vie Anterieure," secrecy and loss undermine the celebration of the correspondences, but the poem also demonstrates that the loss (and its secret) have already been shaped by the constellation of correspondences. In "Correspondances," the festivities take place within a frame of experience that includes sensual synaesthetics as well as poetic expression: the poem articulates this poetic activity in traditional terms ("chant," "transports") that have been rendered unfamiliar-and modern-through the poetics of impersonality that detaches them from a self-consciously self-representing poetic persona. The secret link between "spleen" and "ideal" (between loss and the celebration of the correspondences) in "Correspondances" leads back to one of the most explicit elements of Baudelaire's aesthetic program-"le Mal." The "secret douloureux" of "Corre-</page><page sequence="31">578 BERYL SCHLOSSMAN spondances" is the corruption of the "other" perfumes-"Et d'autres, corrompus, riches, et triomphants"-that dominate the sestet. When the two poems are read together, their common mo- tifs reveal the correspondence-festival of the waves in "La Vie An- terieure" as a celebration of the poetics that conclude "Correspon- dances"; the undisclosed secret of "La Vie Anterieure" in turn sheds light on "Correspondances" because its explicit connection to the vanished pleasures of sea and sky draws together the enigmatic modernity reflected in the first quatrain of "Correspondances" and the corruption dominating the tercets and their poetic transports. These "transports" definitively recode the doctrinaire under- standing of the correspondences for Les Fleurs du Mal. Baudelaire found the "correspondances" in the capharnaum ("Geheimnis- kramerei") of the nineteenth century; he purloined them, or rather he subverted them from within, in a solitary poetic coup. Baude- laire's poetic conspiracy starts with the senses that end "Correspon- dances" and begin "Uber Einige Motive bei Baudelaire." The Ba- roque break between the "l'esprit" and "les sens" cannot be mended. The notion of the final unity of the correspondences-a mainstay of Baudelaire criticism-is a projection of the doctrine that Baudelaire subverts. While Baudelaire criticism of recent de- cades has shifted from the claim for vertically ascending unity to the horizontal unity of the correspondences, it is the claim for unity that Baudelaire's poems overthrow: in "Correspondances," the "tenebreuse et profonde unite" of line 6 is subject to a "comme" of resemblance. This "comme"-typical of Baudelairean usage- posits resemblance as a figural connection rather than a factual one; the relation of "les parfums, les couleurs, et les sons" to "unite" remains hypothetical and even virtual. The smooth affir- mations and the factual tone of the poem act as a cover for the non-factual unity, and induce the reader to believe in it. Baudelaire tempts the reader with this mirage of unity, but the final movement of "Correspondances" is neither ascending nor horizontal. It does not rise up from the weight of spleen to the weightless floating of the ideal, nor does it "horizontally" weave together the elements of perfume, color, and sound. The final movement of "Correspondances" reverses the ascent that was sup- posed to lead the subject from the sensual to the spiritual. The final perfumes of the poem, the "others," the perfumes of corruption, "chantent les transports de l'esprit et des sens." The animal origin</page><page sequence="32">M L N 579 of several perfumes at the end of the poem is intended to open the enumerative possibilities of the final "comme" (as de Man sug- gests), but also to underline the descent from the airy elevation of the spirit back to the infernal abysses of Baudelairean desire. In the aporetic luminous Night of modernity, these perfumes emanate from the flowers of evil that name them, indefinitely: correspon- dances. Emory University</page></plain_text>
