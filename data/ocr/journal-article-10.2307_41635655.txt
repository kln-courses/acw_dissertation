<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Victorian Fetishism : Intellectuals and Primitives . By Peter Melville Logan. New York: State University of New York Press, 2009. 218 pp. $55.00. Today, the word "fetishism" rarely conveys meaning beyond the general notion of erotic object fixation ( OED sb. Id). Sometimes, it means "excessive attachment or regard" ("Fetishism," American Heritage) or, as "fetish," it connotes "something irrationally reverenced" (OED). Nonetheless, as Peter Melville Logan notes in Victorian Fetishism: Intellectuals and Primitives , in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century the labels "fetish" and "fetishism" underwent a transformation that aligned the underlying concept solidly with sexuality; after the years 1850-1900, the sexual fetish became "a disease of civilization" rather than a signifier of cultural nonexistence (Logan 138-9). Hence, the word's linguistic domain shifted from anthropology to psychology and, to borrow from the title of Logan's penultimate chapter, "sexology." Gradually, then, fetishism "ceased to serve as a term of opposition to culture" (138), as it originally functioned to most Victorian intellectuals. To them, however, fetishism implied emphatically the absence of culture. Logan initially uses a rather straightforward and linear approach in navigating through the historical permutations of the concept of fetishism, but he employs a subject-oriented method in discussing the applications of the idea by major Victorian figures. Inarguably, Logan ably negotiates the difficulties of terminology in Victorian Fetishism . From the outset, he guides the reader through the changes that the expression "fetishism," and the question of religious origins that accompanies it, has endured. The reader appreciates Logan's willingness to provide verbal indicators that take into account the need for a baseline definition of fetishism as well as the necessity for a more elaborate explication of the word. To this end, he characterizes fetishism in its simplest sense as the mistaken "object worship" (7), devoid of abstraction, of a thing or animal, a practice that Portuguese merchants attributed to Africans in the fifteenth century (7-8). This reductionist definition helps the reader remain tethered to one of the two basic components of the Victorian understanding of this concept. In the Introduction and in chapter one, Logan establishes this original meaning of the term "fetish," a connotation that declined in force throughout the century. The other element of the term has to do</page><page sequence="2">92 Book Reviews with the Victorian perception that fetishism equates with what Logan refers to as "unculture" (2). This correlation envisions the worshipper projecting a human trait onto the object in question. Such thinking stands at one end of the imagined continuum of culture and constitutes "primitive fetishism" (4). As Logan notes throughout chapter one, philosophers had long suggested a slow growth of culture in every society over time. In the eighteenth century, for instance, Bernard le Bovier de Fontanelle equated less developed races with "contemporary savages, the vulgar mass, and children" (24). In Fontanelle's explanation, the "primitive mind. . . projected its own experiences outward, transforming them into imaginary independent divinities" (24). In keeping with this construction, Victorians such as Matthew Arnold, discussed by Logan in chapter two, and George Eliot, evaluated in chapter three, considered that societies and individuals either have culture or they do not (59, 67). On the other hand, Edward B. Tylor, in his 1871 study Primitive Culture , which Logan considers at length in chapter four of Victorian Fetishism, maintained that some societies and individuals possess more culture than others (93). The thinking of these three writers, Logan argues, contains the elements of "the nineteenth-century European theory of the primitive: an immersion in the concrete, combined with anthropomorphic projection" (28). This insistence on a dichotomous split between culture and its deficiency relies on a triangular "relationship" (8). In this scheme, accordingly, three constituents are present: the fetish, someone who worships this object, and someone who "contradicts the insider and reasserts the simple materiality of the object" (8). In a final complication, words, art, and realistic novels become objectified fetishes themselves when the rhetoric their Victorian creators employ acquires what Logan later calls the "illusion of concrete existence" (53). In different ways and for different purposes, Arnold, Eliot, and Tylor perform the role of contradiction in the fetishist relationship. However, Logan demonstrates convincingly that these writers are ironically "guilty of projection" (137) akin to that of the fetishism they target. Logan argues that Matthew Arnold, who attacks in Culture and Anarchy the fetishes of society, "reintroduces fetishism at a higher level of abstraction" (48). He becomes "his own touchstone ... the Arnold Fetish" (63). Eliot, whose "association of provincialism with primitivity" (67) is a persistent anti-fetishist motif in her work, nonetheless "attributes a transformational power to fictional</page><page sequence="3">South Atlantic Review 93 realism" (83). Because it represents life, the realistic novel can "alter its audience's moral conditions" (82). This "illusion of concrete existence" (53) became for Eliot and others a fetish with "supernatural power" (83). Similarly, Edward B. Tylor's Primitive Culture , which contends that artifacts such as residual expressions and holidays (Eliot loved to depict these as archaic rudiments) point to a preexisting culture within a culture, was later criticized by anthropologists who questioned the objectivity of Tylor's "initial classification of a culture" (102, 105). In other words, Tylor, in projecting his assumptions onto his findings about the origins of unexplained customs, "utilize[s] fetishism" (111). Victorian Fetishism , then, illustrates the way fetishism operates in reverse on those who use it to excoriate primitivism. This condensed version of the Victorian rendition of fetishism does not do justice to Logan's treatment of the historical development of this term. The author tracks to Lucretius the idea of humans who think in "primitive concreteness" (20-23). By the time he reaches Auguste Comte, Logan has competendy explained the success of Fontanelle, Giambattista Vico and David Hume, to name a few, in solidifying the idea of primitive fetishism in English consciousness. Succincdy but thoroughly, Logan covers Marx's concept of "commodity fetishism" early in the Introduction (6), just as he later, in chapter three, details the "radical critique of religious fetishism in modern life" (74) in Ludwig Feuerbach's Das Wesen des Christenthums , which Eliot translated. Of Comte, whose Cours de philosophie positive powerfully influenced Eliot and Tylor (and irritated Arnold), Logan gives a lucid account, not an easy feat (70, 47). For those readers, who plan, as I do, to postpone a full reading of Comte indefinitely, I recommend Logan's excellent summary of Comte's work. After all, Comte's dissection of "primitive fetishism" (39) crystallizes Victorian thinking about this subject. Despite its brevity, Victorian Fetishism effectively manages to bracket Logan's analysis of the targeted years of 1 850-1 900 with comprehensive historical and philosophical context. Dr. Logan's discussion of the Victorian notion of the fetish suggests other areas of possible research. One might revisit, for example, the question of whether the emphasis some Romantics placed on the divinity of nature derived from the idea of the fetish. One thinks of Coleridge's use, in The Rime of the Andent Mariner, of the albatross, the sun, and other natural features invested with supernatural power in the poem. Even before Comte popularized the term "fetishism,"</page><page sequence="4">94 Book Reviews Logan notes, Coleridge evaluated "natural history by likening it to African fetish worship" (43). Obviously, Wordsworth merits similar investigation, especially in light of the fact that Edward Tylor, as Logan tells us, claims that Wordsworth had the ability to comprehend, through "'deep poetic feeling,'" the childlike way of perceiving the world that primitives allegedly possess (108). If nothing else, the Romantic proclivity for pantheism probably owes something to a linkage, perhaps an unconscious one, of culture and fetishism. Logan saves his discussion of sexual fetishism for almost the end of the study, so any reader attracted by potentially salacious material has to delay gratification. Actually, aside from the terminology - "moral insanity," "onanism," "perverts" (Freud's unfortunate term), "castration complex" (Freud again, in reference to a ridiculous, sexist idea), "sadism," (116-125), and the like - the reader will encounter less of a discussion of sexual fetishism perse than a description of how fetishism became a part of modern usage (125). Of course, Logan explains the contributions of theorists like Alfred Binet, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Freud, and others to the modern concept of erotic fetishism, but the more fascinating part of the book outlines the waxing and waning of the use of "primitive fetishism" in devaluing all non-European cultures and in favoring specifically middle class, mid- Victorian culture. In Logan's view, despite its value in helping the modern reader understand Victorian rendering of culture, fetishism is largely pass√©, and "doubdess we are better off without it" (140).
