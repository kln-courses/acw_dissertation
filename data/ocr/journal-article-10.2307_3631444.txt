<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CULTURAL IMPACT OF GENDERED SOCIAL ROLES AND ETHNICITY: CHANGING RELIGIOUS PRACTICES IN TAIWAN' Melissa J. Brown Department of Anthropological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-2117 The differential gendering of a social role in Han and Aborigine religious traditions impacted cultural content when the actual social order resulted in a person holding that role who did not match gendered expectations. The actual holder of the gendered social role of spirit medium influenced both the social rules for who could achieve that role in the future and the religious practices and meanings for which that role holder was responsible. Analysis of this case in terms of the dynamics ofsocial power relations and cultural meanings sheds light on why gender and ethnicity are so important in shaping people's lives. CHANGING RELIGIOUS PRACTICES in Toushe and Jibeishua villages in southwestern Taiwan (Figure 1) during the second quarter of the twentieth century show that gender is embedded in sociopolitical circumstances, in the institution and demographics of marriage, as well as in religious and other cultural meanings. These practices also show that gender is bound up with ethnicity, compounding the relation of women to men with that of Aborigines to the Han ethnic majority. The case discussed here fits within recent scholarship that "situates" gender in cultural and sociopolitical processes. Lamphere, Ragond, and Zavella (1997:4), for example, point out, "Gender is historically contingent and constructed, simultaneously embedded in material relations, social institutions, and cultural meanings. ... gender is [also] intimately bound up with inequalities, not only in the often dominant relation of men to women but also to those of class and race" (cf. di Leonardo 1991:28-32). Similarly, di Leonardo and Lancaster (1997:1) suggest, "Metamorphoses in sexual and gender relations have always been inseparably linked to political, economic, and cultural changes." That gender is so embedded is now well established by many case-specific analyses (e.g., Stoller 1991; Chao 1996; Gal 1997; Schein 2000). However, analyses that answer "[Gayle] Rubin's [1975:145] call for a theorization of the interdependence of the economic, the political, and the sexual" (Scott 1999:206) are rare (but see Gates 1996). Joan Wallach Scott (1999:207), in rethinking the usefulness of "gender" as a category of analysis, calls for analyses "asking how sexual difference is itself articulated as a principle and practice of social organization."2 Here, I frame my case-specific finding in a broader theorization about the distinct but interacting dynamics of cultural meaning and social power relations.3 Journal ofAnthropological Research, vol. 59, 2003 Copyright ? by The University of New Mexico 47</page><page sequence="2">48 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH 1i2 0' 1 2Z2 DansBul R. 25sTaibei Xainhhu eyilan rilan R.

Gendering a social role--creating expectations that one gender will hold a particular role-has consequences for both social and cultural dynamics. In the extreme case, only people of the specified gender may attain the role. I argue that the actual holder of a social role influences the subsequent dynamics of both social relations and cultural meanings (see also Brown in press: Chapter 6). Because the holder of a social role influences the social rules in effect for who can achieve that role in the future, a role-holder can change social dynamics by changing the rules for acquiring that position. By influencing the cultural content which he or she is responsible for performing, a role-holder can change cultural dynamics by changing the meanings by which new ideas are evaluated. Gender is an important factor in this analysis for two reasons. First, gender is a means of social differentiation in the very basic sense that men and women have different social experiences. Men and women hold and are held to different social expectations. Second, and related to this social differentiation, men and women often have differences in their cultural knowledge-the cultural ideas to which they have access and the degree to which they believe cultural ideas to which all may have access. In other words, gender can be correlated with cultural difference, though the extent of the cultural difference between men and women varies widely across cultures and within cultures across time. Ethnicity is also an important factor because, in the early twentieth century, gender and ethnicity were linked in Toushe and Jibeishua, which were considered plains Aborigine villages at the time. First, and foremost, women carried the primary, if not sole, marker distinguishing plains Aborigines from Hoklo, the local variety of the Han ethnic majority (for ethnic terms in Taiwan, see Figure 2, below). Hoklo women had bound feet; so, in this area of Taiwan, women without bound feet, and by implication their families and villages as well, were Aborigine (Brown 1995, 1996, in press).4 Gender and ethnicity were further linked in Toushe and Jibeishua because most Han who lived in the villages were poor men whose only option to marry at all was to marry uxorilocally into their wives' families (something strongly frowned upon in patrilineal, patriarchal Han society). Han men have been marrying indigenous women in conjunction with the spread of Han political domination throughout Chinese history (cf. Pulleyblank 1983; A. Wolf 1989; Brown in press). The gendering of Han as male and ethnic minorities as female was and is commonplace (cf. Schein 1990; Gladney 1994; Harrell 1995). The word han, which refers to the Han ethnic group, can also mean "male" or "husband." Thus, the gendering of ethnic groups in Toushe and Jibeishua--that is, the association of a particular ethnic group with a specific gender, Han with males and non-Han with females-is not extraordinary in the context of Chinese history. Gendering an ethnic minority as female implies that the ethnic minority cannot assimilate to Han majority status any more than women can become men (taken as a biological given), yet in southwestern Taiwan, the ethnic minority did assimilate</page><page sequence="4">50 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH to majority status-plains Aborigines became Han (of the Hoklo variety). Moreover, local changes in ethnic identity from Aborigine to Han changed marriage patterns in a way that opened to males the role of spirit medium (T., tang- ki) for the Aborigine deity Thai Tsoo in Toushe.5 Even though the role was gendered female at the time, Toushe's last woman spirit medium could not find a female successor, and so the role passed to men who maintained control of it and introduced many changes, all but one of these changes taking the local Aborigine- derived religious practices closer to the Han folk religion. I argue that male spirit mediums made these changes in cultural content to enhance their status among Han outside the village. As men, they fit within a Han tradition that genders the role of spirit medium as male, regardless of the deity's gender.6 By contrast, in Jibeishua, women continued to hold the role of spirit medium to Alik Bu (as the Aborigine deity is called there).' The woman who was Alik Bu spirit medium in the early 1990s reported actively suppressing the introduction of some Han cultural practices. I suggest that women spirit mediums are so rare and anomalous in the Han folk religion that adopting Han religious practices would have undermined the authority of women holding the social role of spirit medium rather than enhancing it. Thus, this woman-unlike her male counterparts-had incentive to resist Han- style adoptions. After examining these ethnographic specifics, I analyze how distinct social and cultural dynamics interacted through gender and ethnicity to achieve these results. ABOUT ETHNIC GROUPS IN TAIWAN Several levels of ethnic distinction have long existed among the peoples of Taiwan. These distinctions were somewhat different at the beginning and end of the twentieth century (Figure 2). The majority of Taiwan's population has been Han since at least the end of the seventeenth century. "Han" is the term used in Mandarin Chinese for those whom most Americans think of as ethnic Chinese. Hoklo and Hakka are two "regional" varieties of Han. Many of their customs differ, and their spoken "dialects," Minnan (also called Taiwanese) and Kejia, respectively, are mutually unintelligible. Although Han demonstrate enormous social, cultural, and linguistic variation-as great as or greater than that between different nations in Europe-Han themselves and others classify Han as a single ethnic group (see Brown [in press] for a further discussion). Hoklo have always constituted the great majority of Han in Taiwan. "Aborigines" is the preferred English appellation of the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, who are more closely related to the indigenous peoples of Malaysia and Polynesia than to Han. I capitalize "Aborigine" to indicate its ethnic equivalence to "Han." The broad category of Taiwan Aborigines encompasses many languages and cultures. Languages of the various Aborigine groups, many of which are now extinct, are classified as Formosan, within the Austronesian language family. Although at the end of the twentieth century Aborigines generally described themselves in terms of their cultural group, the historically derived division of Aborigines into plains and mountain groups was still common.</page><page sequence="5">GENDERED SOCIAL ROLES AND ETHNICITY IN TAIWAN 51 AT THE END OF THE 20T CENTURY: HAN (Han) TAIWANESE MAINLANDERS (Taiwan ren or Bengsheng ren) HOKLO HAKKA many groups (Fulao ren or Taiwan ren) (Kejia ren) ABORIGINES (Yuanzhumin) PLAINS MOUNTAIN (Pingpu zu) (Gaoshan zu) SIRAYA many other groups many groups (Xilaya zu) AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20th CENTURY: HAN (Han) HOKLO HAKKA (Fulao ren) (Kejia ren) BARBARIANS (Fan) CIVILIZED or COOKED WILD or RAW (Shou fan) (Sheng fan) Figure 2. Relation of Ethnic Terms Used for People in Taiwan (with Mandarin Terms) Mainlanders arrived 1945-1949.</page><page sequence="6">52 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Under Qing dynasty rule in Taiwan (1683-1895), officials classified Aborigines as "barbarians," distinguishing primarily between "wild" or "raw" Aborigines (living in the high central mountains, on the eastern plain, and on smaller coastal islands) who adopted few or no Han customs and "civilized" or "cooked" Aborigines (living on the western plain and in the western foothills of the central mountains) who adopted much of Han culture, including language. The Japanese colonial government (which ruled 1895-1945) continued to use these pejorative terms for Aborigines. The polite terms used for Aborigines at the end of the twentieth century are ostensibly geographic categorizations, but in fact they refer to the same groups historically distinguished by their relation to Han culture.8 Mainlanders-around one to two million of them-came to Taiwan between 1945 and 1949 with Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist government. Under Nationalist martial-law rule (1947-1987), Mainlanders, who controlled the government, classified Hoklo and Hakka together as "Taiwanese." The discrimination and political repression faced by most Taiwanese during this period fostered the construction of Taiwanese identity as an ethnic identity (see, for example, Gates 1981, 1987; Chang 1994, 2000; Chun 1994). At the same time, plains Aborigines all but disappeared as a category, and mountain Aborigines fared at least as badly as the Taiwanese politically. Most of the events I discuss here occurred during the Japanese period, before any Mainlanders arrived in Taiwan. In the late 1980s, Taiwan started on the path to becoming an electoral democracy by lifting martial law and instituting many political liberalization measures. Since 1996, Taiwan has elected its representatives all the way up to the president. In 2000, Taiwan elected a Hoklo president who was not a member of the Nationalist Party. These political changes fostered a nationalization of Taiwanese identity to include Mainlanders and to acknowledge the historical contributions of plains Aborigines through intermarriage. As a result, the status of Aborigines has improved dramatically from the status they held in the Japanese period of which I speak here. CHANGING ETHNIC IDENTITY, MARRIAGE PATTERNS, AND WOMEN'S AUTHORITY At the beginning of the twentieth century, Toushe and Jibeishua were still considered plains Aborigine villages, in spite of the Han patrilineal ancestry of some villagers and in spite of all villagers sharing language (Minnan Chinese, or Taiwanese) and many customs with neighboring Han villages (Brown 1996, in press). However, in 1991-1992, when I did my fieldwork, people in Toushe and Jibeishua made it quite clear that they were Hoklo Han. Neighboring Han affirmed this self-identification. How did this change in ethnic identity occur? Neither cultural practices and beliefs nor ancestry in and of themselves were sufficient to allow people in Toushe and Jibeishua to claim Han identity. At the beginning of the twentieth century, since they did not bind their daughters' feet, all other factors were irrelevant to their ethnic classification, and they were considered plains Aborigines. However, a colonial intervention by the Japanese imperial</page><page sequence="7">GENDERED SOCIAL ROLES AND ETHNICITY IN TAIWAN 53 government altered the sociopolitical experience of Toushe and Jibeishua villagers. The Japanese colonial government banned footbinding in 1915, effectively stopping the practice among Hoklo Han throughout Taiwan. The marker locally distinguishing Han from plains Aborigines gradually disappeared, as women with bound feet aged and died. Villagers in Toushe and Jibeishua, however, did not have to wait so long to stop being treated as ethnic "others." About 1930, when there were no first-time brides of any ethnicity who had bound feet on the Taiwan marriage market, neighboring Han first allowed their daughters to marry into Toushe and Jibeishua, and they accepted brides from Toushe and Jibeishua for their sons. They also stopped using the ethnic slur "savages" (T., huan-a') to refer to Toushe and Jibeishua villagers, who were now their affinal relatives.9 Changing ethnic identity affected demographic patterns of marriage. Specifically, the flow of marriage partners between Han villages and Toushe and Jibeishua changed (Brown in press, 2001). Before 1930, plains Aborigines did not marry to Han villages and only desperate Han-primarily poor Han men but also a few poor Han widows-married into Toushe and Jibeishua. After 1930, women from Toushe and Jibeishua married to Han villages and first-time Han brides married into Toushe and Jibeishua. This change in postmarital residence patterns influenced gendered life experiences as well.10 Before 1930, people in Toushe and Jibeishua married primarily within their own villages but also to other plains Aborigine villages some distance away (a four-to-five-hour walk). Around half of all marriages were uxorilocal, leaving women in their natal homes where they remained embedded in domestic and village social networks that were familiar. Although people I interviewed reported women's status at that time as subordinate to men's, the practice of so many uxorilocal marriages allowed many women much more authority within the family and the village compared to women in neighboring Han villages. Han men, although representing the dominant ethnic group in the larger society, came into their wives' homes in Toushe and Jibeishua as strangers from the poorest class of society, somewhat mediating their status in the family and the village, at least initially. After 1930, however, women from Toushe and Jibeishua could expect to marry to Han villages, where they would be strangers. Han families and society strongly promoted Confucian-derived patriarchal principles that women be subservient throughout their lives to men-first to their fathers, next to their husbands, finally to their sons. Not only were these women strangers in their husbands' homes, but their long-term security became dependent upon bearing, and establishing strong ties to, sons (M. Wolf 1972; A. Wolf 1995:155-59). By contrast, their Han husbands would be in familiar social networks that reinforced their authority and dominance. By the end of the twentieth century, women's authority differed in Toushe and Jibeishua. For example, in the 1980s, having strippers at weddings became very common in many parts of Taiwan, including this one. (Strippers at weddings did not remove all clothing; they stripped to bikini tops and g-strings.) In Toushe, strippers were a standard part of wedding festivities. People there reported that</page><page sequence="8">54 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH usually strippers' services were given as gifts. In Jibeishua, however, strippers were not a part of wedding feasts in 1992. When I inquired about the difference, several people, including the (female) Alik Bu spirit medium, reported that the elderly women in Jibeishua had gotten together and put a stop to the presence of strippers at weddings. They refused to allow their families to spend money on strippers either for family weddings or as gifts for the weddings of other families in the village as was done in Toushe (cf. Brown 1993). Such action shows that elderly women in Jibeishua maintained some authority. After all, Jibeishua was the natal village of many of these elderly women. Now, however, younger generations of women marry out to other villages and women from other communities marry into Jibeishua, so it is not clear whether women will be able to command the same authority in Jibeishua once the older generation of uxorilocally married women passes away. There are social implications to the new demographic pattern of marriage. RELIGIOUS PRACTICES AND THE GENDER OF THE SPIRIT MEDIUM Since the change to Hoklo Han identity, religious practices in Toushe and Jibeishua have sinicized-become more Han-like-although the villages differ in the degree to which their practices have sinicized. Residents of both villages regularly participate in the Han folk religion, but both also maintain worship of their Aborigine deity that shows clear continuities to earlier Aborigine practices (cf. Shepherd 1986), including a large annual festival. I link the differences between Toushe and Jibeishua to gender issues, specifically to differences in women's reluctance to take on social roles of public authority in the context of a changing demographic pattern of marriage. In the early twentieth century, religious practices dedicated to Aborigine deities in both Toushe and Jibeishua were clearly different from Han religious practices, even to a casual observer. In contrast to Han folk religion (cf. A. Wolf 1974; Jordan 1985 [1972]; Weller 1987), deities were represented by vases or pots with plants in them instead of by anthropomorphic images. Temples were walled only on three sides as opposed to four. Temples were located outside village living areas instead of being within the community. Altars were low to or on the floor as opposed to elevated. Pig skulls decorated the temple. Daily offerings were betel nut chaws and rice wine (mijiu), not incense and food. Annual festivals included special songs-originally in Austronesian, later taught syllable by syllable among Minnan speakers-and a dance performed by villagers. Like Han annual festivals, however, these festivals did include entire pigs as offerings. At that time, according to interview reports, people believed the deity's spirit medium should be a woman. In 1991, Jibeishua's worship of Alik Bu appeared to have the least Han influence. The Jibeishua temple to Alik Bu (T., kong-kai) and subsidiary shrines still bore little resemblance to Han temples, other than the presence of moonblocks (T., puah-poe) for divining the deity's response to petitions or queries. The only recent Han-style change was the inclusion of donors' names and the amount of</page><page sequence="9">GENDERED SOCIAL ROLES AND ETHNICITY IN TAIWAN 55 their gifts carved into the walls of the temple built in 1983. The 1991 Jibeishua annual festival had some Han elements, including food offerings of the three meats (pork, fish, and chicken) and whole pigs and entertainment offerings of puppet shows and opera performances, but they were not necessarily recent introductions. Other Han elements, however, were notably absent. For example, at Han festivals, all the neighboring deities are invited to enjoy the festivities, making for an altar covered with an array of deities. At the Jibeishua annual festival, there were no Han deities on the temple altars. Some Han elements had even actively been suppressed. The Jibeishua Alik Bu spirit medium specifically told me that she removed incense she found stuck in the walls at the temple." She also, when possessed by Alik Bu, cut the electricity to the temple when someone made an entertainment offering of strippers. When the strippers left, "Alik Bu" restored the electricity. In Toushe, all but one of the changes that have occurred in the worship of Thai Tsoo (as the Aborigine deity is called there) have been toward a Han cultural model.12 Early in the twentieth century, the role of Thai Tsoo spirit medium transferred twice from women to men, first at the temple (T. kong-kai) near the main settlement and later at the temple farther up in the foothills near one of the satellite settlements. The deity may have even been called Alik Bu by the women spirit mediums, so that a change in the deity's name may have also occurred.13 The first transfer occurred before Toushe's identity change to Han in the early 1930s, the second at about the time of the identity change. Unfortunately, the first transfer happened early enough that I was not able to reconstruct it. The second transfer- which I reconstruct based on interview reports-links the change in marriage patterns to the gender of the actual holder of the role of spirit medium. A woman whom I will call Tan A-lien was the last female spirit medium at the satellite temple, and a man whom I will call Lo Kim-hok was the second male spirit medium at the main temple (Figure 3). Tan's daughter and Lo's son were married for a time and then divorced. The two temples worshipped together while the marriage lasted. One villager who discussed this history with me was of the opinion that the divorce was related to disputes between Tan and Lo on religious matters. Specifically, Tan refused to teach Lo or his assistant, whom I will call Ong Bun, the important kaixiang (opening power) ritual in its entirety. Lo reportedly did not perform a very elaborate version of the kaixiang rite, and Ong's widow explicitly told me that Tan would only teach her husband a little of the kaixiang rite. An elaborate version of the rite was later performed by Lo Kim-hok and the subsequent male spirit medium because Ong went to Jibeishua to learn it, from a male relative there who was a spirit medium of the male Aborigine deity A-ka-tuan. Tan tried to find a woman to take over the role of spirit medium after her but failed. She trained her son instead. Tan had a woman who acted as her assistant. That assistant's daughter-in-law, whom I will call Lim Mui-mue, told me that she herself was an instructor of the songs for the annual festival. Tan had taught her the songs but not how to perform the important kaixiang rite. When Lim volunteered that people thought that the Thai Tsoo spirit medium should be a woman, I asked why Tan had taught her son the kaixiang rite and not her daughter. Lim said that it was because Tan's daughter had married out virilocally and Tan's daughter-in-law</page><page sequence="10">56 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH TOUSHE Alternate Names of the Aborigine Deity Thai Tsoo A-li Bu (only by those spirit mediums marked by *) Spirit Mediums at the Main Temple Spirit Mediums at the Satellite Temple Ng* (female) no information I* (female) name unknown (female) Lo (male) name unknown (female) ate raw pig in trance Lo Kim-hok (male) Tan A-lien (female) assistant: Ong Bun (male) wanted to train Lim Mui-moe (female) ate raw pig in trance did not eat raw pig in trance Lo (male, nephew of Lo-Kim-hok) Ng (male, son of Tan A-lien) ate raw pig in trance JIBEISHUA Multiple Aborigine Deities A-li Bu (the primary deity, who is female) An Tsoo (the most important male deity) A-ka-tuan (a subordinate male deity) Figure 3. Deity and Spirit Medium Names in Toushe and Jibeishua Villages</page><page sequence="11">GENDERED SOCIAL ROLES AND ETHNICITY IN TAIWAN 57 (who married in virilocally) could not learn it. I interviewed Tan's daughter-in- law. She reported that she had wanted to learn the rite, but Tan A-lien would not teach her. Given this report, I believe Lim Mui-mue meant that Tan's daughter-in- law ought not to learn it, due to her status as a virilocally married woman, rather than that she was not intellectually capable of it. Tan had wanted to teach Lim Mui-mue the kaixiang rite, but Lim refused. When I asked Lim why she refused, she said that she was not married at the time, and she did not know where she would marry; she did not think marrying uxorilocally was a possibility. I asked Lim why she did not reconsider after she married virilocally within Toushe. Lim said she did not want to go out so much for healing rites, another part of the spirit medium's duties, because she had small children. (Tan, by contrast, had become spirit medium when she was in her forties, and her children were old enough to be left unsupervised.) Thus, Lim linked virilocal marriages-which were increasing dramatically at that time (around 1930)-both to Tan's inability to pass the role on to her daughter and to Lim's own refusal to take on the role. This link, as well as a reported reduction in women villagers spraying rice wine over betel offerings to Thai Tsoo and the reduction in women chewing betel at all, indicates that local ideas of femininity and gender were changing toward a Hoklo Han cultural model and, in the process, were reducing women's authority and roles in Thai Tsoo worship. At the time of the second transfer, Toushe people reportedly still did not think that the Aborigine deity's spirit medium should be a man. Nevertheless, in spite of the persistence of the idea of the role of the Aborigine deity's spirit medium as female- gendered, in practice, men took over the role of Thai Tsoo spirit medium. Why? Consider Lim Mui-mue's refusal to take on the role of Thai Tsoo spirit medium. Lim initially explained her refusal in terms of the very real possibility that she might marry out of the village, but the fact that she married within the village and still did not take on the role belies that explanation. Her second explanation was of having children too young to be left alone. In analyzing this reasonable explanation, we must remember that, at the time, Toushe villagers lived in extended families with many people. Why would her children have been alone if she left them? Although Lim did not marry outside the village, as many women in her generation did, like them, she did marry virilocally. Thus, she was not an outsider in her husband's village (since it was her own natal village), but she was an outsider in her husband's family. Marrying to her husband's household meant that she would have had to rely on help from her sisters-in-law for childcare if she were to take on the role of spirit medium. (Her mother-in-law was Tan's assistant, and so she herself would not be home.) I suggest that Lim astutely gauged the probability that her sisters-in-law would not have supported her becoming spirit medium by caring for her children. Had Lim been married uxorilocally, where, as a family insider, she would have been asking her own mother or sisters to care for her children, her decision might well have been different. Changes in social and cultural dynamics interacted here to limit women's options. Socially, women were becoming virilocally married outsiders who could not expect the "special" consideration of help with their family responsibilities.</page><page sequence="12">58 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Such sentiments may have come from daughters of the family or from other virilocally married daughters-in-law who, as outsiders, had to watch other people's faces to gauge the acceptability of their own behavior (cf. M. Wolf 1992:95). Culturally, the increasingly patriarchal, patrilineal, Han model frowned upon women as spirit mediums. "Tang-ki are expected to be and do things inappropriate for women, and even though the extraordinary circumstances of a god's [sic.] demand should make it all right, the sheer incongruity between the expectations of a god's behavior and those of a woman' s behavior is enough to create misgivings" (M. Wolf 1992:111). The changing construction of gender constricted the range of behaviors deemed respectable for women. In short, virilocal marriages-brought on by the change in ethnic identity-limited women's options by making them outsiders, even in their natal village, at the same time that Han gender expectations limited their options by narrowing acceptable behavior.14 THE CULTURAL IMPACT ON RELIGIOUS PRACTICES According to people I interviewed, most of the Han-style changes in the Toushe main temple were done in the 1930s, after the second transfer of the spirit medium to men, and many after 1945. In other words, most religious changes occurred after the change to Hoklo Han identity. Incense burners were introduced, altars raised, the architecture of the temple changed, annual festival songs standardized to be like Jibeishua's through writing them down, additional vases and a white banner with Han characters on it introduced. The Han name "Tai Shang Lao Jun"-the title for Lao Zi, the (male) founder of Daoism-was introduced as an alternate name for Thai Tsoo causing confusion among villagers about Thai Tsoo's gender. The male spirit medium began practicing self-flagellation. At the 1991 annual festival, local Han deities were placed on the temple main altar to enjoy the festivities. Finally, in 1991, the spirit medium and his assistant had expanded their services beyond the village-sometimes traveling an hour or more by car to perform rituals, especially for healing, and even to establish private Thai Tsoo altars. (In 1992, the satellite temple did not have any spirit medium at all.) Only the additional vases and the standardization of songs might be argued as not pointing specifically toward a Han model. However, I suggest they do show Han influence. The additional vases can be interpreted as mimicking the Han practice of having multiple images of a deity, and the standardization of songs can be seen as conferring greater status on the songs by creating a written text. (Writing is considered a fundamental aspect of Han culture and, indeed, of a Han notion of civilization.) I interpret these changes as fitting within the deliberate efforts by the spirit medium and his assistant to expand Thai Tsoo's and, by extension, their influence. Such expansion-including the establishment of new subsidiary altars-is a standard aspect of the Han folk religion (cf. Sangren 1988). Men also drew on the Han folk religion to consolidate their claim to the role of Thai Tsoo spirit medium. Specifically, they drew on the widespread Han belief in Taiwan that deities (including female deities like Ma Tsoo) detest the pollution of women's menstrual periods. In 1992, when I asked the Toushe Thai Tsoo spirit</page><page sequence="13">GENDERED SOCIAL ROLES AND ETHNICITY IN TAIWAN 59 medium about female spirit mediums, he explained that it was hard for a woman to do the healing rite (a major part of being a spirit medium), which included the kaixiang rite, because women cannot perform these rites during their menstrual periods. This male spirit medium cannot be seen as totally opposed to female spirit mediums-he did train two different women who lived well outside Toushe as Thai Tsoo spirit mediums. However, the cultural changes he instituted in the religious practices, in conjunction with his discouraging attitude toward the possibility of a female spirit medium within Toushe, contribute to a consolidation of the role of Thai Tsoo spirit medium as gender-male. EMBRACING/RESISTING THE HAN CONSTRUCTION OF GENDER Why did the acquisition of the role of Thai Tsoo spirit medium by men result in so many changes in religious practices? I suggest that the men may have had a greater sensitivity to the cultural standards of Han religious practice than did women. Hoklo Han spirit mediums are not only typically men, but the role itself is gendered as male. Thus, women are anomalous as spirit mediums from a Han perspective no matter what they do in this role."' In Toushe, male Thai Tsoo spirit mediums may have been sensitive to comparisons between them and the spirit mediums of Han folk religion deities, especially as those male-gendered roles were introduced into their very community. For example, Ong Bun, who served as Lo Kim-hok's assistant in Thai Tsoo worship, was himself spirit medium to a Han deity. Ong strongly influenced both Lo Kim-hok and the man who was Thai Tsoo spirit medium in 1991 (the latter was Lo Kim-hok's nephew). I suggest that the Toushe male spirit mediums adopted so many aspects of Han folk religion because it was possible, at least in theory, for them to achieve the normative social status of Hoklo Han spirit medium. This possibility existed both because Han folk religion is so syncretic (e.g., Harrell 1974; Weller 1987, 1994) and because-even in the early twentieth century-these Toushe men were otherwise culturally very much like the Hoklo. They were right at the border to Han. Choosing to introduce Han religious practices would-they might have presumed-push them across that border. Remember that the religious changes were occurring right around the time that individual villagers were breaking down the last vestiges of the border between plains Aborigines and Han by arranging virilocal marriages with neighboring Hoklo Han. Women spirit mediums-simply because they were women--could never achieve that social status. They would always be marked as "other" on the basis of their gender, so they had no incentive to adopt cultural aspects of the Han folk religion. Given women's low status in the patriarchal, patrilineal, Han social order, one could argue female spirit mediums in Toushe and Jibeishua had reason not to adopt Han religious practices. In other words, I am suggesting that when comparing two stigmatized groups-men once considered plains Aborigine and women once considered plains Aborigine-in the role of ritual specialist, which was a male-gendered role to the Han, the group that came closer to the higher-status norm (the men) was more likely to adopt other markers of the higher-status norm, presumably trying to achieve that status, than</page><page sequence="14">60 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH the group that had no chance of ever achieving the higher status (cf. Brown 1995:Chapter 2, in press, n.d.). The only change in Toushe religious practices that clearly moved away from a Hoklo cultural model was the introduction of the Thai Tsoo spirit medium eating raw pig intestines and blood while in trance during the annual festival. Han are disgusted by the consumption of raw pig's blood and meat, but judging by the timing of photography flashbulbs during the 1991 annual festival, it can also fascinate them. My field research suggests that the first man to become Thai Tsoo spirit medium at the main temple introduced the practice very early in the twentieth century. All the male spirit mediums were reported to have consumed raw intestines or blood. In fact, the 1991 spirit medium was criticized for not consuming as much as his predecessor. There were no reports that any of the women spirit medium in memory consumed raw intestines or blood, and Tan A- lien was reported specifically not to have consumed it. Given the other attempts to do things in a more Han manner, why consume raw pig? The consumption of raw pig may have been linked to an embrace of a Han stereotype of Aborigines as "savages" (T., huan-a) by the first male spirit medium, precisely because of the sensitivity to how he was perceived by Han standards. If this man felt that he could not meet Han standards-perhaps just by being the spirit medium of an Aborigine deity-he may have chosen to exploit the Han fear of Aborigines and assert a kind of power frightening to Han by consuming raw meat and even blood. Such exploitation of the power to frighten can be seen in other examples as well. Shepherd (1986:8) reports that he was told by a Toushe villager that "in the old days human skulls were hung on these staffs" where the pig skulls hang now- a clear reference to the Han stereotype that all Aborigines were headhunters. Moreover, One [Toushe] informant told [Shepherd] that when [Han] Chinese referred insultingly to them, plains aborigines could, by touching the head of the Chinese, place a hex (hsiang) [xiang] on that Chinese which would cause him severe illness. An old woman in [a historically plains Aborigine village not far from Toushe] told us that the hsiang would harm anyone who stole her bananas. (Shepherd 1986:32-33) Similarly, one old man from the one Han satellite administratively attached to Toushe by the Japanese colonial government told me that people in that satellite did not formerly have much contact with Toushe because they were afraid of Toushe people. He said that Toushe people would tease him about killing him-another reference to headhunting. One woman I interviewed who claimed to be the first Han (first-time) bride in Toushe reported being afraid when she first went there as a bride. The consumption of raw pig ties back into Han notions of gender as well as of Aborigines. At the same time that such consumption marks the deity as Aborigine, it also distances both the deity and the role of spirit medium from Han notions of</page><page sequence="15">GENDERED SOCIAL ROLES AND ETHNICITY IN TAIWAN 61 femininity. Women's oral consumption among Han in Taiwan is much more restricted than men's. For example, women are frowned upon for drinking, smoking, chewing betel, and eating dog meat, all common male activities. Thus, the consumption of raw pig both makes Thai Tsoo more masculine-like the Han female deities-and also makes it less likely that women villagers will aspire to the role of Thai Tsoo's spirit medium.16 Why have there been fewer changes in Aborigine-derived religious practices in Jibeishua? I attribute the minimal intrusion of Han elements into worship in Jibeishua as related to the gender of the role-holder, specifically to the maintenance of an older woman with some authority in the role of Alik Bu spirit medium. In 1991, the Jibeishua Alik Bu spirit medium was in her late seventies. Like Tan A- lien, she had become spirit medium when her children were old enough to be left unsupervised. Unlike the 1991 male Toushe Thai Tsoo spirit medium, she had little or nothing to do with worship of Han deities in the village, and I heard no criticisms of her abilities as spirit medium or her management of the Alik Bu temple. She herself reported her participation in suppressing incense in the Alik Bu temple, strippers at the annual festival, and even strippers at weddings within the village. She clearly carried some authority in the village. Although Han folk religion has also flourished there, Jibeishua has managed to maintain a separate Aborigine-derived religious tradition. However, it is not clear if it will continue to do so, since the Jibeishua Alik Bu spirit medium did not designate and train a strong female successor before her death in 2001. Like Tan A- lien, the last female spirit medium of Toushe, the Jibeishua Alik Bu spirit medium faced a challenge to find a female successor in the context of the overwhelming change to virilocal, village exogamous marriages that accompanied the acquisition of Han identity. One possible candidate to become Alik Bu spirit medium was an Jibeishua-village woman who had refused to marry for long enough that in 1992 she had just crossed the line to established "maiden aunt" status or, in the more romantic language of a growing number of women in Taiwan, "single noble" status. Unfortunately, not marrying also left her with less than full adult status within the village. My guess is that the Jibeishua Alik Bu spirit medium, who was married and had grandchildren, was not comfortable designating someone with less than full adult status as her successor. Yet if she married, she would leave Jibeishua. These interpretations of why the Alik Bu spirit medium had no successor are my own. When asked directly about her successor, the Alik Bu spirit medium assured me that the deity herself would indicate who should be her spirit medium. However, when I visited Jibeishua in 2002, the role of spirit medium (as temple oracle and arbiter) in the village Aborigine-derived religious tradition had passed to a man, who was serving as the spirit medium to An Tsoo, the most important of their male Aborigine deities. THEORETICAL CONCLUSIONS In Toushe and Jibeishua, the role of spirit medium was a gendered role in several respects. Most basically, villagers held expectations that the spirit medium</page><page sequence="16">62 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH for the Aborigine deity Thai Tsoo/ Alik Bu should be a woman. However, in spite of these culturally based expectations, a complex of sociopolitical and demographic changes resulted in men taking over the role in Toushe. I argue that the gender of the person who actually held the locally important social role of Thai Tsoo/Alik Bu spirit medium influenced the cultural content for which that role- holder was responsible. In short, the gender of the actual role-holder influenced religious practices and meanings. In Toushe, male role-holders introduced many changes in religious practices toward the Han model, including even a name change that has created confusion among villagers about the gender of the deity! The consumption of raw pig, another change instituted by men, has probably also contributed to this confusion. In Jibeishua, a female role-holder deliberately restricted Han-style religious offerings of incense and stripper performances. The cultural impacts of the gender of the actual holder of the social role of spirit medium confirm a number of important things about dynamics of cultural meaning and social power relations. These dynamics, although distinct processes, do interact with each other in myriad ways. Achievement of, even aspiration to, specific powerful social roles may depend on cultural beliefs about which categories of people should hold particular roles. Gender and ethnicity so powerfully affect people's lives because they are categories often used to specify which roles individuals may achieve. As we have seen, however, the existence of such cultural beliefs do not necessarily mean only such people in fact achieve those roles (thus allowing for the possibility of political activism). Social and cultural dynamics are also historically contingent. In other words, what happens at one point in time affects the range of possibilities available at another point in time. The holder of an influential role may change the rules about who can hold such roles, thereby changing the dynamics of the local social power hierarchy. Once a member of an excluded gender or ethnic group achieves a role, the category associated with that role may change. Since men took over the role of spirit medium in Toushe, there have been no more female spirit mediums within the village. Moreover, although the possibility of a female spirit medium is left open, it is very unlikely in the current milieu, given the Han-derived restrictions on women's practices as spirit medium. Social and cultural dynamics are affected by the conscious and unconscious choices of individuals, and such choices are themselves affected by the perceptions of individuals about power and social relations which are often consciously thought of in terms of gender or ethnicity. Perceptions-based on idiosyncratic interpretations of the social power hierarchy and cultural meanings that often take the form of personal gender and ethnic experiences-may or may not accurately reflect actual social power relations. Lim Mui-mue linked her refusal to become spirit medium to her perception of what a virilocally married woman could do, a perception derived from her personal experience. (Remember, the perception was reported after years of experience as a virilocally married woman.) Cognitive perception, then, introduces a collective aspect of power through cultural meanings attached to social power relations which guide and constrain individuals' interpretations of actual events and possible future actions. Ideas about the</page><page sequence="17">GENDERED SOCIAL ROLES AND ETHNICITY IN TAIWAN 63 appropriate behavior for a virilocally married woman reportedly influenced her actions-not to learn the ritual and become a spirit medium. This is hegemonic ideology-in the specific form of the construction of gender-at work, guiding choices.17 At a very broad level, analysis of the cultural impacts of a gendered social role in terms of social and cultural dynamics implies that choices--conscious or unconscious-are influenced differentially by cultural meaning, social power, perception (and thus the cognitive structure and operation of the brain), and demographic trends. People often notice and articulate these influences in terms of gender and ethnicity. Actions, of course, may have intended or unintended consequences, but all choices, actions, and their consequences are constrained by historical contingencies in the specific culture, society, and environment in which the individual decision-makers live. In other words, people are born into a specific context that shapes their potential choices, actions, and consequences. The shaping occurs because the circumstances of the context categorize individuals socially and culturally, for example, by gender and ethnicity. Thus, while individuals "choose" their actions, the alternatives available to them are constrained by the existing cultural meanings, social power relations, and demographic conditions in which they live. Lim Mui-mue's position as a virilocally married woman and the cultural expectations attached to that category carried consequences (in terms of childcare and possibly status in the family) which effectively constrained her choices. Individuals do have agency-we can choose and we can act. No one coerced Lim Mui-mue to refuse the role of spirit medium. However, that agency-what options we have to choose from and what the consequences are likely to be-is constrained. Even whether we can successfully carry out a particular action is constrained: think of Tan A-lien's daughter-in-law who wanted to be spirit medium but could not. In closing, let me use these theoretical implications to respond to Joan Wallach Scott's challenge to articulate gender and social organization in order to understand why "the sexual" is embedded in political and economic processes. (Micaela di Leonardo and Roger Lancaster would add cultural processes to political and economic ones.) Gender and ethnicity are so embedded because they both organize and claim ideological justification for hierarchical social relations. NOTES 1. My field research in southwestern Taiwan was supported by an ACLS/SSRC Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation Dissertation Research Fellowship in Chinese Studies, a Pacific Cultural Foundation Research Fellowship, and a Visiting Research Associate position at the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica. Analysis and write-up were funded in part by a postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Chinese Studies, University of California, Berkeley, and by a Charles Phelps Taft Grant from the University of Cincinnati. I thank Elizabeth Brown Frierson for useful comments on an early draft. 2. Scott's reassessment raises many important questions about gender studies of the 1980s and 1990s, although I disagree with her conclusion (Scott 1999:205) that the sex/ gender distinction supports the very ideological productions it was intended to deconstruct.</page><page sequence="18">64 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Her embrace of a Freudian perspective is particularly problematic in light of recent anthropological work overturning the foundation of Freudian theory (A. Wolf 1995). 3. Social dynamics constitute how an individual person moves about in a specific social system or hierarchy as well as how that system changes. Cultural dynamics constitute how an idea comes to be widely enough shared to become part of the local cultural model as well as how the introduction of a new idea into the model affects other ideas already present in that model. Because the term "a culture" colloquially refers to many different things-a specific society, customs, beliefs, a disenfranchised minority group within a society-I prefer the term "cultural model" to refer to all the ideas distributed widely enough in a specific population to be considered part of "the culture." I suggest there is a human cognitive threshold such that, once an idea achieves some critical-mass distribution, people perceive it as part of their "culture" (Brown 1997, in press, n.d.). 4. Hakka, another Han variety, also did not bind women's feet, but there were no Hakka in this part of Taiwan; so unbound feet marked Aborigine status. 5. Terms in Minnan Chinese, or Taiwanese, the local "dialect" spoken in Toushe and Jibeishua, are marked by "T." Unmarked terms are in Mandarin Chinese, the national language of Taiwan, which is mutually unintelligible with Minnan. 6. Ma Tsoo, the patron deity of Taiwan, is female. Her temples are abundant in Taiwan. The spirit mediums who serve as oracles in her temples, however, are overwhelmingly male. One does see women who are publicly possessed by spirits during pilgrimages, festivals, etc., but these are not the spirit mediums who serve as religious and social arbiters in rural areas (cf. Jordan 1985 [1972]:85). The rural role of arbiter-the oracle for a temple deity- is gendered as male. Ma Tsoo-and other female deities-are also worshiped just like male deities, including the offering of female strippers purportedly for Ma Tsoo's entertainment during her birthday celebrations. 7. Liu (1987 [1962]) and Shepherd (1986) consider Thai Tsoo and Alik Bu the same deity. Pan (1989, 1994) suggests that the two are different deities. 8. For example, the Ami who live on the eastern plain and the Yami who live on Lanyu Island are "mountain" Aborigines. Both were historically classified as "wild" or "raw." 9. In 1996, people in Toushe and Jibeishua began to publicly call themselves plains Aborigines (pingpu zu). I find it significant that villagers waited to do so until after the deaths of most of the elderly people I interviewed in 1991-1992, who had become Hoklo around 1930 but remembered being called "savages" in their youth. 10. Other changes in the local construction of gender also occurred. At the impetus of the Japanese colonial government, Han came to expect women to do heavy agricultural field labor. In Toushe and Jibeishua, women stopped drinking rice wine and chewing betel nut (a stimulant popular in Taiwan and Southeast Asia which dramatically stains the teeth). 11. A number of sources (e.g., Shi 1990:25) refer to the Alik Bu spirit medium by the term ang-i (T., witch), an exclusively female category of spirit medium in the Han folk religion who communicates with the dead (thus with ghosts, not deities). On one occasion, I referred to the Alik Bu spirit medium as ang-i in her presence, and she informed me that she is a tang-ki-the male category of spirit medium who serve as oracles for temple deities-not an ang-i. 12. Even the name is more Han-like. "Thai Tsoo" is an entirely (Minnan) Chinese term, and it is commonly used for other figures of worship in the Han tradition. "Alik" is a Minnanized derivation of an Austronesian term and has no Han equivalent. "Bu" is the Minnan word for "mother." 13. Only a few Toushe villagers reported the use of Alik Bu by women spirit mediums there, and others did not remember that name being used in Toushe. Such a change would</page><page sequence="19">GENDERED SOCIAL ROLES AND ETHNICITY IN TAIWAN 65 constitute another move toward a Han cultural model. 14. Margery Wolf (1992:110-16) also argues that outsider status prevented a woman from becoming a spirit medium, though under very different circumstances in a rural Hoklo village in northern Taiwan in 1960. (The woman in question apparently claimed to be a spirit medium, but a locally prominent male spirit medium declared her bogus. Mental illness was also an issue.) 15. Remember, I am discussing women in the role of spirit mediums as oracles and arbiters, which is both prestigious and influential in rural areas. 16. Avron Boretz (personal communication, 2000) suggests this practice "seems to affirm a different kind of gendered ethnicity, or ethnicized gender, one that excludes both Han and female practitioners." I agree that, since the late 1980s, this practice may affirm such an ethnicized gender-indeed, Shi (1990:25) refers to the male Thai Tsoo spirit medium as ang-i (T. witch), a definitively female term, though the man was exclusively referred to by the masculine tang-ki within the village. However, the practice of consuming raw pig was begun in the early twentieth century-long before Han tourists showed any interest in these festivals and even before the change in ethnic identity occurred, so I do not think that, at its inception, it affirmed such an ethnicized gender or that it was so intended. 17. Ideologies are constructed by people in power to emphasize cultural meanings that support the existing social power hierarchy. REFERENCES CITED Brown, Melissa J. 1993.
