<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Magnifications": the Eighteenth-Century Fortunes of a Primitive and Universal 'Imagistic' Barbara Maria Stafford This essay suggests that microscopic ob servation contributed to a new type of liberating 'pictorial' voyaging during the eighteenth century: a wholly visual, dis embodied, or 'weightless' form of travel into an uncharted, contradictory, and shadowy interior. The purely perceptual entry, or voyeuristic penetration, into the domain of the invisible became tied, on one hand, to the larger 'immaterial' argu ment for the spatial, apparitional, or reve latory status of all phenomenal 'appear ances' - most notably stated by Berkeley.1 On the other hand, it became negatively conjoined both at the scientific and aes thetic level with the perils of illicit wan dering, optical vagrancy, and the erring tendencies of a 'mannered' or excursive sight - specifically goaded on by Rococo artful intricacy embodied in the intimate and the small.2 When left unmanaged by a guiding logic or a superior philosophi cal 'method' lying above, or outside, its objects, vision - according to logocen trists since Plato - tended to get lost in the miniature rocaille thickets of the decora tive macroscopic and microscopic world.3 Metaphors of near and far, exterior and interior, disclosure and closure tend to become accentuated in regions remote from ordinary experience.4 They are tied to notions about illegitimate straying, or creation, and legitimate pursuit, or imi tative following, taking place both on the surface and in depth. Such tropes high light the larger epistemological problem posed during the Enlightenment by op tical apparatus of all sorts. These magni fying glasses set into relief the literal and figurative limitations of vision - even when enhanced.5 In short, the question was what are the implications of amplify ing microscopic events to macroscopic consequences, i.e., artificially turning into 'observables' what otherwise would 308 i Robert Hooke: 'Magnifications of the Point century, and make a brief digression into of a Small Sharp Needle (engraving), , . , from Micrographia (1667), p.4. the polemics surrounding the nature of generation occurring in between.

First, the magnification persisting today - I will examine two of minute, trivial magnification of min micrographical test cases, separated by a ute, trivial 'no-things' or 'no-bodies' 1.

Maxi mized, or visually 'exploded', minima disrupted and challenged - by their com plexity and unconventional, or non geometric, shapelessness - a classical sculptural aesthetic exclusively forged from a symmetrically-disposed, clear and distinct human beauty. Tiny, name less creatures 'rose' individually to 'sink' generic and normative impersonations such as 'mankind' or 'humanity'. Second, the grotesque host of diverting infusoria, protozoa, spermatozoa, and 'animalcu les' manifested under the enhancing lens threatened - by their frightening decom posability and strange 'looks' inconsis tent with the visible continuum - the tra ditional conception of a coherent and in violate body. Countless swarming and unpredictable 'invisibles' - stretching downward as far as the eye could see - rendered illusory the idea of a dominant, organized, and regular visible whole composed of calculable, fixed, and prop erly subordinated parts. Third, the microscopic uncovering of the infinite - while beguiling, promising a full sen sation of the object - nonetheless exhib ited to the investigator only a fragment or aspect of its complete structure. That always elusive simple entity, or underly ing 'true essence', became - in the wake of heterogeneous multiplications and ever deepening perspectives - fractured into monstrous, eccentric pieces abstracted from a larger, and increasingly more 'ideal' or unrecuperable, 'reality'. Fourth, the ornamental profusion of microscopic life, its automatic copious ness, inevitably led to what seemed like capricious breaks in sequence wreaking havoc with orderly systems of classifi cation. Fifth, and resulting from the rest, this distant seductive scenery helped to thoroughly pictorialize the longstanding linguistic topos of the Book of Nature. The silent spectacle of non-localized and floating images exposed the limitations of noisy, static, and demarcated words. As Berkeley remarked in An Essay to- 2.

Significantly, at the outset of this enterprise, Hooke is at pains to unmask the supposed smoothness and uniform ity of "printed and written full stops", by exposing them as "bungling scribbles and scrawls". These mechanically-produced periods - appearing even and round to the unaided eye - are in actuality, and when perused correctly, or in depth, "abundantly disfigur'd".

This unresolved dualism poses a paradox manifest in all Hooke's descriptions of enlarged naturalia. The contrast is always both ontological and dimen sional: between important internal, "higher" or intrinsic, nature and unim portant external, "lower" or "transito ry", illusion, between the significant in visible and the insignificant merely vis ible. Thus the minute quantity of solid matter embedded within frothy cork leads him - in Newtonian fashion - to dilate on the "spiritual" emptiness of its cells, pores, and interstices15 (fig. 3). Un like the macroscopic wayfarer trudging through a world of resisting substances, the microscopic excursionist flits through a universe of atoms shot through with luminous space, meeting with resist less permeable walls and translucent par titions. As peregrinating seer, he is able to rove through muscovy glass which, when split with a needle into thin flakes, reveals white motes ethereally tinged with the tints of the rainbow. Hooke even pressed a transparent medium (air or liquid) be tween two glass plates permitting the eye to ply through a film of "colored atmos phere", or the desubstantialized appari tion of chromatic rings.16 His explo ration into the nature of flint sparks anal ogously led to an optical tour of crystal line flashing "repercussions" "so curiously shaped"17 (fig. 4). Hooke's disclosing microscopical in quiry must be understood, specifically, however, in light of the Royal Society's professed aim of openness.18 He spurns artful shapes and unplain forms because they are designed for no higher use than 5.

Martin Frobene Leder miiller's Amusemens microscopiques (1776) constitutes one such important graphic encyclopedia of spectral diver sions enacted in the dark.24 While admi ring the power and wisdom of the creator almost more in minor creatures than in major ones - an opinion not unexpected in the 'curator' for the Margrave of Bran denburg's cabinet of curiosities - he also praised the ingenuity of modern techno logical wizardry. Since the invention of Hooke's double convex lens of very short focal length, a staggering diversity of im proved optical machinery (which he illus trated and whose operations he demon strated) had invaded the European scene.25 Although one of the eighteenth century's most significant discoveries, that of the "spermatic animalcules", was made because of the new instrumen tation, Ledermtiller also extols it as a ve hicle for innocent, licit pleasure or diver sion.26 Significantly, while Hooke had soberly cautioned against taking even good simi litudes for likenesses, Berkeley, specifi cally, had connected microscopy with the freedom of the eye in a kind of non tactual, 'imaginary' aesthetic of vision for vision's sake.27 Now Ledermuller con firmed Berkeley's emancipation of pris matic ideas from monochromatic words by artificially transforming a volumetric material world into colorful animations (fig. 5). His lively simulations stand at the head of a long line of I'art pour Vart phan tasmagoria.

We noted, in passing, the Rococo fascination for miniature, intricately wrought physical interiors or private en closures of all sorts suspended within simpler 'public' contexts. Despite their smallness, these involuted artificial and natural environments - from penum brous garden grottoes to candlelit mir rored and gilt salons to murky corporeal recesses - encouraged prolonged visual wandering. Their ornamental com plexity made the relatively tiny spaces - perceptually criss-crossed - seem larger, and to hostile Neoclassical critics, more important than they actually were. Ledermiiller had cited as one of the won ders of the age Anton van Leeuwenhoek's (1632-1723) discovery of "little animals" in human semen.35 In the course of forty years devoted to the microscopical inves tigation of organic and inorganic struc ture - facilitated not only by a good pair of eyes but by great manual dexterity - he tracked the minute denizens of a for merly invisible world: the spermatozoa of arthropods, mollusks, fishes, amphib ians, birds, and mammals. Since the Dutch scientist equated life with motili ty, he assumed that the rushing spermato zoa (not William Harvey's motionless egg) were the origin of all animal exis tence. According to this activist and mas culine theory of generation, spermatozoa 7 Martin Frobene Ledermiiller: Magnification glyphical' fictions or metaphorical make- penetrated the egg (although he was not of Alum Crystals (color engraving), from , . , . . . . , , , .

Buffon developed a variation on this vitalist theme with his animated ars combinatoria, comprised of mosaic 'organic molecules' or genetic factors randomly brought together through chance combinations.37 It took the relent less thoroughness of Lazzaro Spallanza ni (1729-1799), among the preeminent natural philosophers of the eighteenth century, to discredit the doctrine of spon taneous generation and to ridicule the notion that an animal or plant could orig inate from a chance accumulation of parts. Yet Spallanzani, in spite of having done so much to set the investigation of reproductive phenomena in plants and animals on a modern footing, was a con vinced preformationist like Charles Bon net and Albrecht von Haller before him.38 Creation, for these experimentalists, was illusory. The embryo was already within the ovum, a tiny tadpole awaiting vital ization by seminal fluid in order to un coil and grow. The debate concerning preformation raging since the 1740's and pitting Voltai re, Bonnet, Haller, and Spallanzani against the epigenesists Maupertuis, Needham, and Buffon emphasized the purely phantasmal, or imitative, charac ter of reproduction. These explanations argued for the preformed nature of the primordia out of which new organisms came into being.39 Bonnet's theory of preexistence or emboitement - which made a lasting impression on the mi croscopy of his friend Spallanzani - seems to me to have redirected and re phrased in different biological terms what can now be identified as Hooke's century-old perspectival and ontological problem of encasement. This dilemma may be restated as a larger scientific and aesthetic question. What is the relation between an invisible, primitive, and thus significant (and, in this case, 'heredi tary') past or depth to a visible, deriva tive, and thus insignificant present or surface. The transference of religious and ethical values from the natural to the arti ficial realm was effortless. Ready-made 'germs' for everything in nature were thought to have been created by God in the beginning and to be gradually 'un boxed' during a kind of time travel in moments of individual apparition. Their development from miniature to full fledged organism occurred through mechanical means since matter, in this view, was believed inert. 314 I am suggesting that, like Berkeley's epochal severing of hand from eye, stimu lus from response, cause from effect, pre formed conception becomes etherealized into a purely visible or aesthetic recon ception - a harlequin masquerade cover ing up a remote and ungraspable original act.40 In this symbolism, earthly creation of all sorts is a mirage, a surface or 'tech nical' manipulation, an echo or imi tation, not a tangible or essential occur rence. Its aesthetic equivalent is the chimerical optical mixture, that 'unflesh ly' marriage - not of sensuous pigments but of purified luminosity and desub stantialized hues - that takes place at a distance and in the cerebral eye.41 Vision, as Berkeley predicted, has undeniably be come in the twentieth century the univer sal language. Emanations, still struggling to visibilize the invisible, continue to synaesthetically usurp the specific func tions of the other senses. Reproduction - both in the natural sciences and in the visual arts - becomes, in this modern abstraction, a ghostly process of recur ring visibilizations: at birth, hidden aspects that always existed "below the surface" become visible and, at death, these perceptual fragments do not disap pear but 'sink' or become invisible again. Beneath the ephemeral flow of the actual individuated work sleeps an enduring in finity of potential worlds, a transcenden tal or untouchable white union of all pos sible chromatic combinations. Post-eigh teenth-century art, then, like post eighteenth-century natural science beco mes an art of momentarily fixing appari tions.

Significantly, Tesauro finds the most ingenious emblems to be those composed of "sim plici colore, senza jigura niuna". That is, he envis ages a bodiless metalanguage of colors abstracted from any semantic context. Whereas for Berkeley this constitutes the empirical world, or God's cre ation, for Tesauro, this formal logic is the highest product of human wit. 33) The history of the eighteenth-century back ground to nineteenth-century Impressionism and, indeed, Symbolism has yet to be written. Much of Richard Shiffs discussion of key terms such as 'perception', 'idea', 'impression' is adumbrated in Berkeley among others. See his: Cezanne and the End of Impressionism.
