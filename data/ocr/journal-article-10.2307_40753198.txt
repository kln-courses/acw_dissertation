<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Four Elements and the Cross in Armenian Spirituality, with an Excursus on the Descent in Merkavah Mysticism. James R. Russell The four elements - earth, air, fire, and water - are a tetrad associated with both divinity and creation, in Greco-Roman paganism and in Ju- deo-Christian tradition. God is their Creator, controlling them yet apart from them and not affected by them. (Islam also reflects these concepts regularly.) They are the primordial opposites, and He alone can subdue and harmonize them. Symbolically, they can be seen as the four animals of the divine chariot in the vision of Ezekiel; and they are controlled by a divine charioteer. This dense cluster of intensely symbolic, cosmologi- cal quaternities merges naturally with the image of the Cross. The coin- cidence of the four-lettered name of the primal Man, Adam - as a sub- ject of cosmological, symbolic interpretation - with the fact that the Tetragrammaton has four letters, lends support to the Christian reinter- pretation of these themes in the light of the Incarnation: Adam= YHWH. The solar deity and quadriga of the four elements or Evange- lists at the center of the Zodiac represent Christ, or, for Jews, Ezekiel's chariot with Michael. The mystical journey from the earth of a helio- centric system to it is progress from the outside towards the center, and a descent: perhaps this is one of several reasons an early description of the mystic's ecstasy was called in Hebrew yeridah la-merkavah, "descent into the chariot." Four Elements The concept of the four elements in the Mediterranean area may be traced to the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Empedocles; they are fre- quently listed as pairs in mutual opposition, as in the pseudo-Aristote- lian De Mundo, of which an Armenian translation exists, attributed to Jewish Studies Quarterly, vol. 4 (1997)</page><page sequence="2">358 James R. Russell JSQ 4 David the Invincible Philosopher.1 The pre-Socratic philosopher Anaxi- mander of Miletus defined the cosmos as a system, suspended in the apeiron, "boundless (space)", comprising four forces in binary opposi- tion: hot-cold and wet-dry. By the khreõn "necessity" and taxis "order" of time, the inequity and conflict caused by these contrasting powers will be rectified and brought to harmony.2 The idea of quaternity recom- mends itself to the religious in other respects: there are four seasons, and four cardinal directions, too.3 Quaternity is an aspect of the divinity of the Zoroastrian god of Infinite Time, Zurvãn, and the four elements find a place in Pahlavï cosmology alongside the older heptad of the sacred creations; the later sectarianism of the Islamic period may inherit some of its conceptions about tetrads from an Iranian source; but apo- phatic Sufi expressions of God and the holy man as being apart from the four elements find their source in Judaeo-Christian conceptions.4 The Divine Quadriga The divinity of a tetrad is anciently and dramatically defined for Juda- ism in the Chariot Vision of Ezekiel, where the Divine appears on a 1 See Thomson 1992, p. 195, with reference to Dawit' Anyatt', Matenagrut'iwnk', Vienna, 1932, p. 531. 2 See Hussey 1983. The Gnostics were interested in quaternity with respect to the seasons, time being a feature that separates finite man from the supreme deity. And, notes Grant 1966, p. 42, postexilic Judaism sometimes spoke of four archangels, the third being Uriel/Phanuel in I Enoch; the Ophites called the fourth Sariel, as does the Qumran War Scroll. 4 Movsës Xorenac'i refers to a four-fold Ohrmazd; and there is a four-fold Zurvãn. See Peterson, 1926. Even though Zoroastrians regard seven creations as sacred, the four elements find a canonical niche in the Wizídagíhã Γ Zãdspram; see Kreyenbroek, 1995, 291, who further suggests these are carried on, through "a popular understanding of Zoroastrianism," into the Iranian Ahl-e Haqq and Yazidi religions. This seems farfetched. Normative Islam and the sciences of the Moslem world inherited the idea of four elements directly from the older Hellenistic and Judaeo-Christian civilizations, of the Mediterranean world; and the elements are treated in the poetry of writers in no sense sectarian. The 12th-century poet Sana'i of Ghazna writes of the animal soul, "His outer form was light but inside he was fire;/ Outwardly like one body but internally in four parts" (that is, four elements): see De Bruijn 1983, p. 203. Later, Jalãl al-Dïn Rumï, for instance (cited by Nicholson 1898, pp. 29, 220), writes of the human soul aware of its origin in God, the unmoved mover and creator of the elements: Mard-e xodã nfst ze bãd õ ze xãkj Mard-e xodã níst ze nãr õ ze ãb "The man of God is not of wind and of earth,/ The man of God is not of fire and of water." Again, Dar ãb-am õ dar xãk-am, dar ates õ bãd-am: In car be-gerd-e man- amã ne az Tn cãr-am. "I am in the water and I am in the earth; I am in fire and air:/ These four surround me- yet not from these four, I am."

Ezek. 1.15-25, 10.8-22). Zachariah (6.1-7) beholds four chariots that represent the four winds (ruhõt) of the heavens. The unpronounceable name of God, YHWH, is distinguished for its quaternity as the Tetragrammaton; and the earthly manifestation of its four letters might have been thought to be the four elements. For one mystical word found in Hebrew MSS. is compounded of the Greek words for these: 'BYRGHYDRPYR (aer, gê, hydõr, pyr); and in some texts YHW, an element of the Tetragrammaton, replaces pyr, "fire".5 One Armenian colophon of 1615 links the four Evangelists to the Tetragrammaton, in an invocation of the various potent tetrads of Scripture.6 Ezekiel's holy animals become in Christian exegesis the creatures that represent the four Evangelists (in later Jewish commentaries they are explained as the Cherubim7). Or the various animals become the four steeds of the quadriga of Aminadab of Song of Songs 6.11, which was tossing wind: I am not an impression upon clay - I have laughed at all these." Im- pressed clay most likely refers, ultimately, to the Jewish teaching that God made man of clay, but in His image. Christian mystics developed this idea of the typos, which took on added significance with the Incarnation. 5 See Scholem 1965, p. 33. YHWH appears in Greek letters approximating the shape of the Hebrew square character of the Second Temple period as ΠΙΠΙ. It is perhaps significant that the letters divide graphically into two oppositional pairs, cor- responding to the ancient configuration of the four elements and thereby representing their transcendent source. Such a configuration is attested in the pseudo-Aristotelian De Mundo, for instance, of which there is an Armenian version attributed to David the Invincible Philosopher, 5th cent, (see Dawit' 1932, p. 531). Athanasius Kircher, Oedipus aegyptiacus: hoc est Universalis hieroglyphicae veterum doctrinae temporum inuria abo- litae instauratio, Rome, 1653, lists the 72 nations of the world, each with its own four- letter Name of God. The "Armeni" are given a symbol of three small vertical strokes and a lower-case P, with a horizontal stroke above, repeated twice. The word has, thus, the aspect of a doubling of two letters, just like the Tetragrammaton, and therefore, presumably, becomes susceptible to like treatment for being emblematic of two pairs of elements in mutual opposition, capable of being portrayed in the form of the Cross. The strange symbol is to be interpreted, however, as Kircher's misunderstanding of the abbreviation tr ac, with the horizontal patiw stroke of abbreviation over each word, representing Ter Astuac, "Lord God", with the final letter c of the Armenian turned upside-down for the sake of symmetry (or as a result of Kircher's enthusiastic lack of caution in copying all his esoteric scripts).

Russell JSQ 4 seen as a prophecy of Christ.8 This image of a four-horsed chariot cor- responds, with a pleasant fortuitousness, to Greco-Roman portrayals of the quadriga of Helios/Sol.9 And Christ is the true Sun of Righteousness (Gk. hëlios tes dikaiosynës, Arm. aregakn ardarut'ean, in numerous hymns): thus St. Jerome in a letter of 394 to Paulinus of Nola calls the four Apostles the quadriga Domini, "the Lord's four-horsed (chariot)"; and he uses quadriga elsewhere to translate Heb. merkavãh "chariot" generally.10 The Evangelists came later to be associated also with the four arms of the Holy Cross. 1 1 A mediaeval Armenian commentary on Ezekiel explicitly identifies the four-sided throne or chariot of the pro- phet's vision as a precursor of the Cross and the four Evangelists.12 Later in this discussion we shall consider the divine chariot also as a conveyance for human passengers. The four directions, seasons, and ele- ments define and pervade the phenomenal world of matter and time; and the four-sided chariot is the throne of the creator of these things. But it is also the vehicle that conveys one to Him: again, there is an overlap of Greek and biblical images, and sensibly so - for how else did one travel, but by quadriga? Thus Marsilio Ficino, writing in 1496 8 Haimo of Auxerre, 9th cent., interpreted Song of Songs 6.1 1 (= Heb. 6.12), "I did not know: my soul troubled me because of the quadrigas of Aminadab" as a reference to the sudden preaching of the Gospel (see Jacoff 1993, p. 16 &amp; n. 8). There is appar- ently no such connection drawn by the Armenian St. Gregory of Narek, 10th cent., in his commentary on the text (see Thomson 1983, p. 385). 9 The transfer of this same image from an older solar divinity to a salvific human being can be observed in the East, too: in Indian art, the Buddha inherits the quadriga of the Sun-god Sürya; at Bãmiyãn, four apsarases like the four winds of Western ico- nography hover outside the great rayed disk enclosing the charioteer. See Rowland 1938, esp. figs. 1, 2, and 5. 1U See Jacoff 1993, p. 14. It is thanks to this confluence of Classical and Hebrew imagery in Christian religious symbolism that the four magnificent Greek bronze horses of San Marco have been preserved for our admiration and delight. Schimmel 1993, p. 86 f., observes that the four arms of the Cross are associated also with Plato's tetrad of cardinal virtues: Sophia, andreia, sophrosynë, and dikaiosynë (wisdom, courage, prudence, and justice). Christianity assimilated into itself much of the Zoroastrian dualist outlook, with its oppositional pairs; and it is probably in this light that we should understand Schimmel's observation that set against the four Gos- pel writers with their good tidings are the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. One of the four arms of the Cross is planted in the ground, or anchored on a steeple - unless the symbol is suspended in air - and one can therefore see it as a three-armed figure. In the later aspect it reminded the Gypsies of the trident, Skt. trisüla, of Siva; so the Cross in Romany is trusul, Christ is trusulalo, and in the Armenian Gypsy dialect a church or priest is t(e)resul (see Patkanoff 1907-8, p. 251 no. 23; Wolf 1960, p. 230; and Sampson 1926, p. 372, who speculates that the Hindu term was first transferred to the Cross in Armenia). lz See Stone 1986, p. 265: the manuscript is dated to the 17th- 18th cent, on palaeo- graphical grounds.</page><page sequence="5">(1997) The Four Elements and the Cross in Armenian Spirituality 361 his commentary on the Phaedrus of Plato with its visionary allegory of the soul as charioteer, also had in mind Ezekiel's chariot, the fiery char- iot that caught up Elijah into heaven (II Kings 2.1 1-12), the four horse- men of the Apocalypse (Rev. 6.2-8, 19.11), and the poema of Parme- nides.13 These describe, variously, a mystical vision or the Himmelsreise 13 See Allen 1981, p. 3. Parmenides opens his Peri physeõs with a visionary allegory (frg. 1, in Gallop 1984): he is taken on a chariot guided by the kourai of the Sun to the House of Night. The axles give forth the sound of a syrinx - one is led here perhaps to imagine the spindle of the cosmos itself, which produces the different sounds of the seven vowels and seven planets. (See the discussion in Russell 1996: musical wheels are certainly either un-oiled or special, probably the latter; and one notes that the wheels of the divine chariot in Ezekiel are made of a special, precious stone explained in the Aramaic Targum as yamã, "the sea", see Levey 1987, p. 22 &amp; 23 n. 13. In Armenian, the Vision of St. Sahak Part'ew includes a four-sided throne that is covagoyn "sea- colored" and safnakerp "icy" - cf. the sea-like, solid floors of heaven and the fiery, crystalline, icy walls of the divine mansions in Hekhalot texts). This chariot carries everywhere the man who is a "knower" {eidota photo). They arrive at gates guarded by Dike, who keeps the keys of recompense {amoibous). She admits Parmenides into her house (dõ), to learn the truth {alëtheië), and explains to him that there are two roads, one of which is estin, "it is"; and the other, ouk estin "it is not". This is the starting point for Parmenides' philosophical argument against change and for the one- ness of things; but it is evident that the inspiration of the argument itself is intended to be revelatory. One of the more accessible hymns of the Gãthãs of Zarathustra is Yasna 30 - perhaps the one chanted by the Magi that Herodotus explains as a "theogony." The vision portrays the dual origin of things and the beginnings of the cosmic battle, and concludes with the image of a chariot to which the "swiftest (steeds)" (asista) are yoked at the "good dwelling" (husiti) of the Good Mind. These travel into the fame of Wisdom, Mazda, and Truth, Asa. There are, Zarathustra warns, only two ways, though: khvTti, "the good way", and anaiti, "the not-way" (cf. the later Avestan frag- ment, aêvõ pantõ yõ asahe, vïspë anyaësam apantam: "There is one way that is of Truth; all the others are not-ways"). The images of the straight path and road of the Good Mind appear often in Zarathustra's Hymns, as do the various metaphors for dwellings and horse races; and in this culminating passage of Y. 30 they are presented in much the same arrangement - and with much the same assertive purpose - as in the much later work of Parmenides. Zarathustra often calls himself a knower (Av. vfdvah-), as Parmenides does; and insists that one knower must converse with another, and an ignorant man {avidvah-) not interfere with them. In this specific instance one may discern a kinship, perhaps at the proto-Indo-European level, of Zarathustra's heuristic method of discourse, apparently informed by belief in inborn wisdom (Av. ãsnõ xratus) that is brought out in education, with the method of Sokrates a millennium later. As to Parmenides' vision, given the fair likelihood of strong Iranian influence on the pre- Socratics, this may be a case of partial Iranian influence, not pure coincidence or cognate ideas. Kingsley 1995, pp. 54-5 and 392-3, notes numerous Mesopotamian par- allels to the passage of Parmenides, such as the detailed description of the doors guarded by the goddess Justice, and he stresses rightly the specifically Babylonian origin of the expression bit müsi, "house of night." However this does not preclude Iranian borrowing as well (he does not consider that possibility here) since Parmenides was certainly born after the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus, whose use of Zoroastrian religious ideas for propagandistic purposes made a strong impression on observers belonging to other traditions - Deutero-Isaiah, for instance.</page><page sequence="6">362 James R. Russell JSQ 4 der Seele; a gloss on Parmenides indicates that the chariot was asso- ciated also with mystical katabasis - a question of nomenclature to be considered presently.14 Adam and Tetragrammaton. Zosimos of Panopolis, writing in Greek, analysed Adam as an acronym for both the four directions of the compass (arktos, dysis, anatolë, me- sembria) and the four elements; and this lends cosmic dimensions to four-limbed Man, who appears to be not merely compounded of the four elements, but the epitome of their coincidence in a single physical form.15 The Armenian text of the Questions and Answers of Athanasius of Alexandria likewise asserts, "We believe man's body was established out of four substances; and in the likeness of a dove, within the body, dwells the soul."16 These four elements or substances are in strife, though; so this image of Man serves as a metaphor for the predicament of struggle between the demands of body and soul, of intellect and appetite, etc., that are the stuff of the human condition. The late Kab- balistic tract Liqütei Amarfrn (Tanya) goes so far as to postulate four evil elements that derive from the lower soul that inheres in human flesh.17 14 Leonardo Tarán, cit. by Allen 1981, p. 28 n. 6, discussed Hermias' gloss on Phae- drus 246A with the aim of demonstrating that Late Antique readers kept in mind several uses of the metaphor of the chariot: ou prõtos de ho Platon ëniokhon kai hippous parelaben, alla pro autou hoi entheoi ton poiëton, Homeros, Orpheus, Parmenides. "Plato was not the first to employ chariot and horses; but the poets inspired by a god - Homer, Orpheus, and Parmenides - did it before him." The reference to Orpheus is obscure; but perhaps the chariot was thought to have been his vehicle of descent into Hades to rescue Eurydice. Cf. the apparent descent of Parmenides in his vision, also, into the House of Night (note above). We often imagine the horse of a vision as winged and ascending - Burãq, or Pegasus - but of course he can bear us the other way: Kurds carve saddled mounts as tombstones for the dead, and imagine them plodding away into the next world. The Greek fields of the netherworld are rich in herds of horses, and Hades has a quadriga. 15 See Jackson 1978, p. 29. 16 / c'oric' goyut'ean hawatamk' zi hastatec'aw marmin mardoys: ew i nmanut'ean alawnoy i nerk's i marmin, bnakeal hogin. See Conybeare 1913, p. 190, no. 75 (= MS. Or. 2623). The human being is thus compounded of four physical essences and the spirit - a quintessence. The spirit is often regarded as fiery: cf. the tongues of flame shown over the heads of the Apostles in paintings of Pentecost; so this conception can be seen behind such formulations as the Christian Kabbalist Johannes Reuchlin's "Pen- tagrammaton" YHSWH, which represents, without 'ayin, Yehoshua, i.e., Jesus. The word is the Tetragrammaton, with S inserted to represent the Holy Spirit, Heb. 'es, "fire".

Christ is the Son of Man, and God incarnate, Adam and Tetragramma- ton together reconciled and compatible. It is Christ who performs the function of reconciling the elements, in this world, that he contains as man, and encompasses as God. Without Him, the elements are in con- flict; and man worsens the existing turmoil by turning to them in igno- rant, pagan worship. Eznik Koibac'i, in the fifth century, describes the world in his Elc alandoc' ("Refutation of the Sects") thus: "But really we see this world as a chariot harnessed to four steeds - heat, cold, dryness, and dampness. And some hidden power is the charioteer: he subdued these four quarrelsome creatures, keeping them in harmony and in agreement with each other."19 This hidden power is Christ, of course: we have traced above the fusion of biblical and pagan imagery in Chris- tian thought that leads to His identification with the charioteer of the quadriga of the Sun.20 In his treatise, Eznik goes on to describe how the body, since, as it is written, 'The soul of the flesh is in the blood' (Lev. 17.1 1). And from her come all the evil characteristics from the four evil elements that are in her (arba ' vdsõdõt [lit. "foundations"! ra'fm se-bãh)." 18 Midrash Tanhuma describes "a likeness upon the heads of the hayyot, a firma- ment the color of the terrible ice arching over their heads . . . yet the fire does not burn up the water and the water does not quench the fire. Why? 'He makes peace in His high places' [Job. 25.21." See Halperin 1988, p. 83.

In Erevan Matenadaran MS. 3722, fol. 4b (a Gospel of 1304 from Naxijewan), illustrated in Mnac'akanyan 1955, p. 201, pls. 474, 475, Christ, with halo, is shown en face, chariotless, holding the reins of four horses, at the center of a four-lobed field representing the world. A different sort of bird flutters outside each of the two lower lobes; but a pair of symmetrical peacocks crane their necks outside the top two to meet above - evidently trying to form the arch of a canon-table and forgetting they are sup- posed to be the four winds. The horses themselves are two double-headed quadrupeds joined at the waist. This late, charming, and naive distortion of the sort of Late Antique cosmogram to be discussed at greater length below (Sol in quadriga at the center of a zodiacal ring, with anemoi puffing outside at the four corners of the scene) does at least show that Armenians had once known what picture Eznik was verbally painting. Mna- c'akanyan, pp. 199-200, does not realize that the artist was working from a remote pro- totype of horses straining out towards the reader from a chariot behind them, and thinks that the two equine bodies fused into one were made that way intentionally, Christian</page><page sequence="8">364 James R.

The airs of the sky react, gzdme- lovn ew k'stmnelov "grumbling and roaring": this sonically vivid picture may recall the Sogdian dyadic figure xwãsãdh tãsãdh, "distressed" - the latter word from the same Iranian base as the Armenian tas- in parta- sec'uc'anelov, "harrassing" - the action of the wind in the same passage. Indeed, if God did not restrain His offended elements, they would over- whelm the earth: here, too, the polemicist partakes of the rich alliterative fund of ancient Armenian poetics, as he writes, kam cov cackelov, or tkar awazovn pasareal, c'isxë anc' anel and hr aman, "or the sea, swelling, that bound by the weak sands dares not stray athwart (the Lord's) com- mand."21 The sea here dares not transgress, literally or figuratively, either God's command or the thin shore of sand that separates ocean from dry land; the passage summons to mind instantly the original se- paration of the waters and the earth in Genesis. The idolators would thus undo, as it were, ma 'aseh berësît, the Work of Creation, from the standpoint of Biblical cosmology; and Eznik use against the pagans their own customary argument that the Christians, in rejecting the gods and their worship, are the cause of the earthquakes and other calamities that signify the displeasure of the Olympians. Subsequent medieval Armenian writers pursue such themes, though often without the dense poetic layering and multifaceted imagery of Eznik. The 13th-century Armenian scholar and poet Yovhannës Erzn- kac'i, for instance, writes of the four elements and his own person: "How could I harmonize these four? Each one draws me to itself:/ This dry earth makes me parched, this damp water chills me;/ The wind shakes me and the fire's flame ignites me./ Who has ever seen such dear ones together of such evil will?" But he sees greater intrinsic harmony in the way the four elements coexist and interact in nature than does Eznik.22 Mortal, physical man is subject to inevitability and decay; descendants of another nonexistent dicephalous beast. Moreover he thinks that the animals to either side of a lumpy terracotta potnia thêrõn of Armenian antiquity, who are joined simply because the statuette is crude, were likewise meant to be one. On the marking of cov "sea" with words rich in Arm. c- (pronounced /ts/), a sound linked to images of birth and the feminine in very many poetic passages, see Russell 1996.

The Cross It is the holy Cross of Christ, the instrument of death that destroyed death forever, the symbol of oppression and humiliation that became the victorious emblem of freedom from the thrall of original sin and of the dignity of God's image regained, that we must look to as the ultimate expression of the harmonization of the four elements, by its four arms: this aspect is mentioned explicitly by the tenth-century mystic St. Gregory of Narek (Arm. Grigor Narekac'i), in a poem to be dis- cussed below that is meant to mark a point of transfiguration in his own spiritual life. The 14th-century scholar Grigor Tat'ewac'i, in his homily on the holy Cross, explains that its four arms signify the opening of Heaven (top), the harrowing of Hell (bottom), the giving of grace (right), and the forgiving of sins (left); it is also the four virtues: love (top), humility (bottom), obedience (right), and patience (left).24 The modern Armenian poet Zahrad understands instinctively the power of the Cross to reconcile all creation. His poem on the Armenian holy city of Ëjmiacin utilizes the image of the xac'k'ar, the elaborately-carven, filigree-like Cross-stone that Armenians erect as tombstone, monument, and focus of sacrifice: "Stone is not water: It won't flow like a river./ Stone is not air: it won't smoke like incense;/ It isn't Sun: it won't reach our lamps./ Stone isn't water, air, or Sun, unless it's a Cross-stone."25 awdoyn ew jermakan,/ or and hroy jermin ew c'or vercimbarjmcin.

And now, I the uttermost of sinners, Head of the sinful, leader of the unjust, First among the guilty, image of the transgressors, Atticus of meanness, not of goodness, Have spoken my unspeakable words, Displayed my shameful parts, Published my secrets, Revealed my hidden things, Showed matters concealed, Vomited out my bitter bile, Betrayed my confederacy with the Evil One, Squeezed out the accumulated pus of my wound,27 Made known the depths of my debts, Lifted my façade of deceit, Taken off the mask over my ugliness, Stripped off my cloak of shame, Confronted my disgust, Retched out my dregs of death, And lanced before you, Christ, high priest, the boils where my soul is stung. I heeded not the danger in my person, I respected no love towards my body; I made plain the ancient root, I had no mercy towards my nature's needs, I severed the bond of commonality, I shattered the fortress of my heart, Against my desires' venery, as against death's doorkeeper - I fought; I dragged out into the open the stores of the unknown, To the great one I reported the storehouses' treasure, I placed the prosecutor before the Judge, I found in the present the future's travail, I broke the pact with the destroyer, I scattered the covenant with the deceiver, I entrusted to you, lord Jesus, the completion of the victorious battle, I roused to battle the host; 26 The most recent, critical edition of Xac'atryan and Lazinyan 1985 is used here. Narekac'i, like other medieval religious - of whom Luther, at the threshold of the modern age, may be the prime example - insists upon the portrayal of his spiritual foulness in the most vivid, scatological terminology.</page><page sequence="11">(1997) The Four Elements and the Cross in Armenian Spirituality 367 I hoped in you, Word of God, for opposition to the adversary; I called to arms the ranks of light against the phalanx of them that love the dark. (b) And now, Christ, creator of all who have come into being, Lofty Son of God, Do not summon me to a second judgement on the great day, As by these sorts of words I am defamed in this world, Thrashed by these many rods.28 Now powerful one, unsearchable, ineffable, beneficent immortal king, In this manner of rebuke wherewith I have humbled myself to abuse, And judged my soul with great and self-inflicted stripes, Fill through the melodies of this book The visage of Satan with shame and dishonor, And strengthen by the sign of your Cross my own face of an aspect humbled. Let your seal of light merge with the beauty of my features, Your sign of strength be established as the type of my appearance, The bright apparition of your Tree of Life29 be traced for the image of my cheek, Your art of miracle be the sign of honor of my brow. Let not your stamp resplendent with light be alienated from me, Let not your sunburst of blessing be lifted away from the pupils of my sight, Let not your faithful surety be rejected from my head Let not the glory of your inscription of lordship30 be shaken from the firm columns within my mouth.

The text follows the orifices of the body that are sealed with the sign of the Cross with myron at Chrismation, merging that rite of the dawn of the life of a believer with the Extreme Unction given at its dusk.

The sense is that Christ's heart - the innermost part of the holiest being - may justify NarekacVs finger - the remotest extremity of a sinful, mortal man - which is extended in the offering of prayer.</page><page sequence="12">368 James R.

As my wretched body seeps away, let the chrismation of your grace be kept nigh me, In the day of renewal may I meet you, Bridegroom of glory, through this, May I be known by thine from there, May I be adorned through your labors, May I be honored by your great benefit, May I become resplendent in the raiment of the baptismal font, atoned in mercy.

I was cursed, I was wretched, I drank deep and became base. I drowned, was deceived, was faithless. I decayed, died, and was rejected entirely. You have no part35 of evil in this, Since you are only, unchangingly, good. (e) Now your will is for me, but dark is a ray to me of light. There is your lamp lit, and dawn is night. Your body is given in communion - and I live in thoughts of shame. But I reckon not my self alive, On account of the inexorable end. But again, I do not presume myself lost, On account of the certain renewal. But I also count my way out into life sealed off On account of my debts beyond repentance. Again paradise is opened to me Because of the good tidings of salvation. For the wail of despair alarms me less Than the hand of your salvation, in encouragement towards me stretched.36 Now, give, Lord, give mercy, Given thanks at every speaking, blessed forever. Amen. In this meditation, St. Gregory repents, accuses himself, lies in his grave and is given over into death and Hell, following the manner Christ was crucified and descended into Hell before His Resurrection. Narekac'i hopes his self-incrimination and mortification will lessen the terrors of the Last Judgement to come - the event of his own resurrection - and prepares to languish in the underworld in hope, somewhat in contrast to Christ, who harrowed it and released His saints therefrom. But this 35 The reading masn "part" of the older printed editions and some MSS. may be preferable to matn "finger" of Xac'atryan &amp; Lazinyan 1985, p. 505, line 102, though both Armenian and English can speak of one "having a finger" or a hand in a wicked deed. 36 In the final part of this meditation, the mystic is torn between the enormity of his sinfulness and the greatness of Christ's mercy, which is ultimately victorious, as Grace must ever be. Elsewhere Narekac'i, like Dante, cautions against the dangerous snare of despair, that dark pride which tries to persuade us that our evil is too great for God Himself to remedy.</page><page sequence="14">370 James R. Russell JSQ 4 chapter is still a transition point, a death and rebirth, from the second part of the Book of Threnody to the final, crowning section; and the turning-point seems to occur precisely in the line where Narekac'i prays for the four corruptible elements of the body to be acted upon by rays emanating from the four arms of the Cross of Christ - the instrument of death transformed by divine economy into the assurance of eternal life. Two or three centuries after Narekac'i lived Yovhannës, called Benik vardapet of Vanand. One source calls him Catholicos of Ahiank' (Cau- casian Albania); he was a mystic, as we have a text entitled Tesil Benkan i Ganjak sahastani, "The Vision of Benik in the royal city of Ganja"; and several sarakans, ecclesiastical hymns, attest to his poetic gifts. His Alawt'agirk', "Book of Prayers", owes much to Narekac'i, and to Eznik; and the following passage from it deals eloquently with the theme of the four elements:37 "I have packed away the sea's immensity and the sublime diversity of creation in my arrogant mind as though it were small change, regarding as nothing the ultimate abyss and the essential qualities of the four elements. If it were possible for my mind to race round the boundless ring of high Hea- ven for the discovery of evils, in my eyes it would be accounted a slight thing for my wild and bestial mind to raise such a wave of transgressions. For I have ever hastened to find the way of my own perdition, standing bold and unashamed before your face, Lord. For no one has ever enraged you as much as have I, this child of ruin, who have hoarded within me the contor- tions of thought relative to every aspect of sin of which the mind is capable. For no fleshly creature can understand the vastness of the measure of all the rings of the orbits of heaven and circumambulate the paths of the abysses, weigh the mass of eternity or keep a reckoning of the billows of the sea's breakers rolling over Heaven, nor yet of the awful everlasting depths that imprison at their bosom, with a grip swift to seize as the course of the blast, all creations - any more than he might number or measure my sins. For unspeakable ponderings and foul deeds are broadcast out of the depths of my heart. Like pelting arrows of torrential stormy rain into the heights against you, seer of all from eternity; and the form of the four elements has been ruined by the gaze of my eyes, by the exhalation and inhalation of my poisonous, fiery breath, by the touch of my fingers, and by the tread of my ruinously misguided heels. For if your beneficence were not compre- hended within my existence, then the mass of ages might dissolve my veins. Flowing, the heavenly sea might darken universally the essence of light; and the luminaries above might be shadowed; or else the storehouses of eternal fire, superior to the cosmos, engulfing even the deluge's maelstrom, might sweep the face of the earth." 37 Biographical notes in Acarean 1972, vol. 1, pp. 407-8; text in Yovhannes Vanan- dec'i 1861, pp. 12-13.</page><page sequence="15">(1997) The Four Elements and the Cross in Armenian Spirituality 371 Eznik claimed that the pagans' worship of the elements might provoke the latter to destroy the world; Benik envisions the same as a result of his sins, specifically, his failure to submit to God's authority to reconcile their conflict within his own body. His sins reach from the depths of his heart (i xoroc' srtës' cf. the title of each of Narekac'i's meditations, i xoroc' srtic' xawsk' dnd Astucoy, "From the depths of hearts, speech with God") to the wheel of the stars above - perhaps a reference to the Zodiac - and down to the depths below. He intentionally blurs the dis- tinction between the congealed sea of heaven (a theme Narekac'i ad- dresses in the thirty-third meditation, which is a turning point between the first and second parts of his Book) and the terrestrial ocean - and scribes dazed by the soaring, plunging phantasmagoric journey call the covn "sea" now erknayin "heavenly" in one MS., now andndayin "abys- sal," in another. For as the visionary priest of Vanand has outraged both the four earthly elements and their supernatural source, their types in both worlds rage against him in his psykhanodia and katabasis alike. Zodiacal Mosaics in Synagogues and the Yeridah le-Merkavah. We have considered the theme of the four elements guided by God, comprised by man, reconciled in Christ, exemplified by a quadriga, acted upon by the Cross, and beheld in mystical ascent and descent. It is perhaps apposite to venture tentative comment on the expression "descent to the Chariot", with reference to the iconography of the divine quadriga within the circle of the Zodiac. For although the expression itself is purely Jewish, and Hebrew, the iconographie program of Jewish portrayals of the Chariot in Late Antiquity has its roots wholly outside Israel. But Israel reinterpreted the features of this program, and polem- icized them; even as did contemporary Christians. A number of synagogues of the Late Antique period in the land of Israel and in Syria and Transjordan have mosaic floors depicting the wheel of the Zodiac. At the four corners of the floor, outside, are human figures - generally women - representing the four winds and the four corners of the earth; at the center is Helios/Sol Invictus guiding his quadriga. Some synagogues contain other pictures in mosaic as well - Daniel in the lions' den at Na'aran, the twelve tribes at Yafa, the Ark at Jerash, the binding of Isaac at Beth Alpha, etc. There are associations with Greco-Roman mythology in the details. At Hammath, Virgo is shown as Korë Persephone with nuptial veil, bearing the torch of the mysteries; Libra is Minos/Rhadamanthus; and the name of Aquarius</page><page sequence="16">372 James R. Russell JSQ 4 is written from left to right. The Beth Alpha mosaic, dated to AD 518- 27, is perhaps the best known and most often reproduced - as on a medal commemorating the 25th anniversary of the State of Israel. The artists who made that particular mosaic were Marianos and his son Hanina- their names appear also on the mosaic of the Samaritan syna- gogue at Beth Shean.38 The synagogue at Hammath Tiberias predates Beth Alpha by two centuries: there is a Zodiac, and at the center is the Roman Sun-god on his quadriga, shown frontally, with royal crown and halo, attired in the Imperial cloak, the paludamentum?9 This depiction of the Zodiac is of Greco-Roman origin, and its use is widespread amongst non- Jews in the Near East also: at Khirbet Tannur, for in- stance, there is a Zodiac with Tyche at the center. The order of signs 1-6 is clockwise; of 7-12, counterclockwise, perhaps with reference to the two pagan Semitic feasts of the New Year. Other Zodiacs have at their center Jupiter, or the Irano-Armenian god Mithras.40 In Christian art, it is, of course, Christ kosmokratõr - as in the mau- soleum of Julius beneath St. Peter's at Rome, ca. 250-300 AD41 - who replaces the pagan god. Christ's quadriga, four-armed Cross, and four 38 See Wischnitzer 1971 and Avi Yonah 1981, p. 391. 39 See Dothan 1982, pp. 66-7. See Glueck 1965, pp. 413-5 and plates 46-50. I refer to Mithras as an Irano- Armenian god in the Roman milieu, despite his obviously Avestan provenance and Classical accretions, because specific features of his cult can be explained only on the basis of Armenian evidence; and the cult took shape amongst Romans and Greeks with connections to Eastern Anatolia: see Russell 1994 and 1996(b). In this particular con- text, the Armenian evidence seems to display a somewhat indistinct memory - a sur- vival of many centuries - of a belief that was once more systematic. In the national oral epic The Wild Men of Sasun (Sasna crer), which took its final form during the Arme- nian uprisings of the mid-9th century against Arab rule, and was first recorded only in the 1870's, Mithra is Mher (cf. Middle Persian Mihr), the last scion of the race of heroes, imprisoned in a cave at Van until the end of time, when he will merge to redeem his people or destroy the world. Seated on his horse, he holds the wheel of the Zodiac (called in the text carx-i falak, "wheel of destiny", from modern Persian) in his hand. Once a year, on the eve of Ascension Day, the cave - which is, in fact, an Urartean blind portal bearing a ritual inscription in cuneiform - opens, and, according to some versions of the epic, God gives Mher manna to eat. Ascension Day might have been associated with the appearance of Mher because it was the occasion when Heaven opened and became likewise visible for a brief time. From Zoroastrian eschatological doctrine one might further propose (cf. articles cited) that Mher's liberation is to come in Aries- but here he does not so much guide the Zodiac, or release his followers from subjection to its determinations, or even use it as a sign for initiates of esoteric knowl- edge of future events, as hold it as a symbol of his own stasis and imprisonment, that only the Christian god can ameliorate. He is, in the logic of the epic that preserves his memory, a tragic figure. *l Dothan 1982, p. 66; on Christ-Helios at St. Peter's, see Grabar 1968, p. 80, plate 74.</page><page sequence="17">(1997) The Four Elements and the Cross in Armenian Spirituality 373 Evangelists fit neatly into this pre-arranged schema, as we have seen in the foregoing discussion; and the fact of the Incarnation removes the stumbling block of the anthropomorphic divinity governing the move- ments of the heavens. One ought not, perhaps, to overstress the pre- sumed iconoclasm of the Jews that would have precluded artistic repre- sentation of the divine chariot. There is a silver coin, about the size of a drachma, which was found near Gaza, that depicts a divinity seated on a chariot with winged wheel. He holds a hawk, and an inscription above in Phoenician has been read as YHW - God. Controversy still surrounds this unique piece, however.42 While it is unquestionably true that the zodiacal decoration of the synagogues was intended to mirror the sky, it is unlikely that further symbolism was not attached to what is, after all, not mere decoration, but a cosmological map on which various religions - pagan Semites, Greeks, Romans, Mithraists, and, most of all, Christians - situated their god. Jews will not depict God Himself; it is Michael who takes on the visible, physical attributes of Helios, and is the angelic Guardian of Israel. Moreover, Israel has no mazal- the Jewish people are not subject to the mechanical movements of the Zodiac and the attributes and for- tunes determined by the twelve signs; but are governed directly by God, the unmoved Prime Mover, Creator of all things. Israel's destiny is un- affected by the natural, ineluctable rhythms of change and decay in the world governed by twelve zodiacal signs, with its four elements - and, as Vanakan vardapet described above, the four seasons with their sowing and reaping, and the four ages of man that end in death. It has been common in astrology, from ancient times down to the present, to associ- ate each of the four elements with three signs of the Zodiac: in Arme- nian tradition, this is explained in detail by the scholastic Grigor Tat'e- ewac'i, cited above, in his Girk' harc'manc' {Book of Questions).^ A Byzantine calendar, in a ninth-century Vatican MS. of the Geography of Ptolemy, portrays the ring of the Zodiac, with the expected imperial, divine figure behind his quadriga at the center.44 Between him and the 42 See Kienle 1975. Asemk' t'e BZan kendanakerpk'n unin zbnut'iwn c'oric' tarerac' "We say the 12 signs of the Zodiac possess the nature of the four elements." He adds that six of the zodiacal signs are above the northern hemisphere (kisagund); and six above the south- ern. He asserts, unsurprisingly, that the Sun revolves around the earth, and gives the order of the orbits of the planets, from farthest to nearest, as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon (Arm. erewak, lusant'ag, hrat, aregakn, lusaber, p'aylacu, lusin; he adds also the Arabic names of the planets, a common practice in such Arme- nian lists).

Russell JSQ 4 outer ring of stars, though, are two more concentric registers - the inner one, of children; the outer, of different kinds of adult men. The dual symbolism of astrological influence upon character and of human aging is obvious; cf. the word-picture of the Έη Gedi inscription, to be con- sidered presently. It is important to keep in mind here that, even though the mosaics portray the sky above within their own frame of reference, which is the Greco-Roman scheme of astronomy, the earth upon which we stand revolves around the Sun (i.e., Sol and his quadriga at the center), between it and the band of zodiacal constellations. The chariot itself is presumably that of Ezekiel's vision, to the Jewish viewer; and to reach it one seems to be ascending into the sky over the earth, but is, in fact, descending from the outside - the Earth's orbit - towards the cen- ter, the Sun. The nations of the world, thus, are on the periphery of divine action, even as their countries are on the outside, ranged around the center that is the land of Israel and Jerusalem. Such a concentric representation of what is outer and above - the Gentiles, as against what is inner and below - Israel and its archangel - may be paralleled linearly by the aniconic mosaic-inscription from the synagogue at 'En Gedi. There are two lines of text, followed by two stripes and a zig-zag, then six lines and one stripe, then eight lines, two stripes and a zigzag, and two concluding lines. The first two lines list twelve forefathers of mankind: Adam, Seth, Enosh, Cainan, Mahal- lel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah, Shem, Ham, and Ja- pheth. The names of the twelve signs of the Zodiac follow, then the names of the twelve months of the year, then: "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Peace! Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Peace on Israel." Israel comes at the center of the inscription; and the Hebrew names of the three children in the fiery furnace are cited in parallel to the three Patri- archs, perhaps to assert their role within Israel. By then, of course, Christian art gloried in representations of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego as foreshadowers of the manifestation of the Trinity. The concluding lines of the inscription commemorate donors and call down the curse of heaven upon those who reveal the secret (Aram. rãz) of the town to the Gentiles.45 In the 'En Gedi inscription, then, twelve progenitors of the human race appear to be paired with the Zo- diac and the twelve months of the year, in the outer and upper registers; whilst Israel is at the center, separated from the rest by the two triads of patriarchs and Danielic martyrs. 45 See Naveh 1978, pp. 105-7.</page><page sequence="19">(1997) The Four Elements and the Cross in Armenian Spirituality 375 It is well-known that in the mystical system of the divine Chariot, Heb. merkavah, one descends (yõrêd) or performs a descent (yeridãh). Since the chariot in question is heavenly, surely one ought rather to be speaking of ascent; and one can climb into a chariot, or mount it - but not really descend into it. Even in mystical poetry in the Syriac lan- guage, which is closely related to Hebrew, one speaks not of descent into a chariot, but merely of "going."46 And one always goes up (Heb. 'õleh, 'aliyãh, etc.) upon leaving it! This problem of terminology has not yet yielded a fully satisfactory solution. Joseph Dan, whilst aware that there are some missing links, has proposed derivation from the expres- sion "I descended (yãraddti) to the nut orchard" in Song of Songs 6.11, since the nut orchard has mystical significance in the medieval Kabba- lah. D. Halperin cites descent into the Red Sea in Exodus. E. Wolfson is reminded of the phrase, "descend before the Ark"; and G. Stroumsa links the practice to katabasis in the Greek world -47 the mystic or initiate would descend into a cave or hypogeum; and it is known, be- sides, that part of the practice of these Jewish mystics was to place one's head between one's knees, facing down. This must have induced hyper- ventilation; but perhaps there was additional, symbolic intent - going down meant going up. There is in a Coptic Manichaean psalm an inter- esting description of "the King of Glory . . . who turns (?) in the abyss (?) the three wheels (Gk. trokhos), that of the winds, that of the water, and that of the living fire, the armor of our Father, the First Man." These may not be the wheels of Ezekiel's chariot; and if one seek four elements, then where is earth? But the direction must be down.48 46 Thus, in the Odes of Solomon, ed. Charlesworth 1973, no. 38, p. 129, selqeth hnuhrã da-srãrã aykh da-h-markavthã,/ wd-davran srãrã wa-ythyan/ w-i'vran pahte wd- sedqe/ wa-men sdqïfe wz-glãle parqan. "I went to the light of truth as to a chariot,/ And the truth led me and made me come/ And took me across chasms and gulfs/ And saved me from crags and lowlands." In this visionary journey, which at one point seems to anticipate the Chymische Hochzeit of Christian Rosenkreutz, when the author beholds an anti-Bride and anti-Bridegroom (they are named mat 'yãnã, "he who causes to err" and ta 'yuthã, "error" - cf. the Pahlavi Zoroastrian Ahreman and Az, the corruptor and the corrupted-who-corrupts), who mock the true Beloved and His Bride, the traveller is set on the dargã "step" ( an image, surely, of ascent; and cf. especially the imagery of John Climacus, or the darãjãt of later Moslem mystics, who have surely borrowed the Syriac!) of life-without-death. The vision of Ezekiel is associated explicitly, moreover, with ascent, not descent: the tetramorphs figure prominently in the depiction of the Ascension of Christ in the Rabbula Gospels. For a survey of opinions on the subject, and some new considerations, see Wolf- son 1993. In a paper which considers much Armenian evidence, it is perhaps relevant to note the Armenian source, in the legend of Ara, of one of the most famous katabaseis of Classical literature: the descent of Er, son of Arménios, in Plato, Politeia 10: see Russell 1984. 48 See Allberry 1938, pp. 2-3.</page><page sequence="20">376 James R. Russell JSQ 4 It is not necessary in the explanation of a religious ritual or expres- sion that one reason must exclude others - on the contrary, a multipli- city of explanations, considered valid, serve to enhance human precep- tions of the manifold powers of divinity. The astrological aspects of Mithraism have been overstressed by recent Classical scholars insensitive to this principle (and willfully ignorant of things Iranian), for example, to the detriment of the appreciation of other aspects of that complex mystery faith. I should shun, conversely, presenting an astrological ex- planation of yeridah la-merkavah, rooted in the well-established concep- tions of Greco-Roman cosmology, that might pretend to exclude other, coincident explanations emanating from within Jewish tradition and biblical language. But as an Armenologist one should not leave the vexed question of descent into the Chariot without mentioning the Ode to the Resurrection (Tal Yarut'ean) of Narekac'i, one of the most beloved melodies of the Armenian Apostolic Church to this day.49 It describes in sumptuous language, but with the cadences of a medieval folk lyric, a chariot or cart (sayl) descending (ijanër) from Mt. Ararat. One imagines it ought to be coming up, rather, out of recently-harrowed Hell, and in fact some MSS. contain in the last line of the song the exclamation of the saints released, aysawr arjakec'ak' i kapanac', "today we were released from bonds". Perhaps the images from Ezekiel have blended, then, with the resting of the Ark and Noah's descent from the Armenian mountain! The son of the King - that is, Christ - stands in the Chariot, with seraphim to the right and left. Oxen draw it, and they have cruciform horns. One might have wanted four white horses, but perhaps we are meant also to envisage the cart that carried the Ark of the Covenant to the Holy City, and Narekac'i's cart does arrive, after its descent from Ararat, in Jerusalem. Four troops accompany the chariot: these represent the four Evangelists. When they stop, a beautiful, golden- haired, strong youth who walks before the chariot urges them on. He is St. John the Baptist - the prodromos, "Forerunner", whose fiery eyes and hairs are inherited from the Zoroastrian divinity of victory, Varathragna, Arm. Vahagn, whose cult he supplanted in Armenia. The chariot is compared by the poet to that of Moses, that was of Deuter- onomy, and descended from Sinai. Ararat replaces Sinai, as the locus of the new Zion and of the justification and election of the Armenians. If Christ is God enthroned in the Chariot, then John is the first to come before him - to "descend", perhaps.

Still, the Armenian mystical poet has produced a consum- mate vision of a Christian merkavah descending, even if he has not cast light on the problem of why a mystic in Israel must himself descend to its Jewish counterpart.
