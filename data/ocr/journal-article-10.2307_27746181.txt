<plain_text><page sequence="1">178 THE EYES HAVE IT: AN ESSAY ON JACK LONDON'S THE SE A-WOLF Forrest G. Robinson University of California Santa Cruz A recent surge of scholarly interest in Jack London's THE SE A-WOLF gives evidence of an emergent critical consensus in several major areas of discussion, but of a marked division of opinion in matters of detail. Increased attention to the novel indicates both that its high status in the London canon is secure, and that London's standing with the academic establishment?often rather uncertain in the past?has moved to a broader, firmer footing. Additionally, there is agreement among virtually all recent critics that the novel is significantly autobiographical in nature. Not surprisingly, the lines drawn between the facts of London's life and the details of his fiction vary from one observer to another; but the existence of such lines is never seriously questioned. There is general consent as well to the notion that THE SEA-WOLF serves as a vehicle for one or more major strands of thought, sometimes referred to as Jack London's "philosophy." Again, there is some disagreement at more specific levels of interpretation. For example, Clarice Stasz argues forcefully that the novel figures prominently in Jack London's progressive critique of turn-of-the-century sex roles. Taking a much different tack, Joan D. Hedrick insists that the novel is a failed analysis of the brutalizing degradation of the masses in capitalist society. Meanwhile, Susan Ward finds that London's narrative successfully merges "serious" materials drawn from Darwin, Spencer, Marx and Nietzsche with a popular, romantic love story. Such variety in approach and emphasis nothwithstanding, however, in these essays, and in others like them, there is clear consent to the assumption that THE SEA-WOLF is a novel of ideas.1 There is equally broad-based assent to the view that London's maritime narrative is richly psychological in design and implication. The author's fascinating, complex sexuality is almost invariably drawn into the critical foreground, though the array and deployment of sexual ingredients observed in the</page><page sequence="2">179 writer and the work vary quite considerably. Robert Forrey strongly emphasizes evidence of repressed homosexuality in both the novelist and the novel, while Jon A. Yoder stresses London's frustrated, bibulous male chauvinism.2 The most broadly conceived, and perhaps the most generally persuasive of the recent essays in this psychological vein is Charles N. Watson, Jr.'s "Sexual Conflict in THE SEA WOLF." Allowing that the novel's pronounced ambivalences in sexual matters "have their origin in London's own sexual nature," Watson nonetheless moves quickly from biographical speculation to textual issues as they emerge from "the principal triangle of relationships in THE SEA-WOLF." Watson approaches the novel as the record of an initiation in which Humphrey Van Weyden is torn between the "masculine" Wolf Larsen and the "feminine" Maud Brewster. In this conflict the "masculine" implies both homosexuality and nihilism (the creed of brute strength), while the "feminine" implies a combination of heterosexuality and ethical idealism. Thus, the central action of the novel?the midpoint of Humphrey's develop ment?involves a crisis of sexual as well as intellectual orientation. Emerging from an abnormally prolonged stage of mother-dependency, Humphrey must pass through an inter mediate stage of masculine exclusivity to a final stage of sexual and philosophical adulthood.3 I conclude this summary of recent criticism with a relatively close look at Watson's essay not only because his general line of analysis strikes me as lucid and plausible, but also because it echoes quite faithfully a final area of critical consensus that opens directly on my topic. Specifically, while he argues that Maud Brewster's sudden appearance "in mid-ocean" is "readily justified in the light of her vital role in Humphrey's psychological development," Watson also recognizes the 'literal improbability" of her advent, and acknowledges "the frequent charge" that the love story which dominates after Maud's arrival may be "sentimental nonsense."4 In general terms, Watson's analysis reflects the view held by most critics who have written about THE SEA-WOLF, and first and most vigorously expressed by Ambrose Bierce in a letter to George Sterling: "The love element, with its absurd suppressions and impossible proprieties, is awful." Many readers may not share the vehemence of Bierce's "overwhelming contempt for both the sexless lovers,"5 but there is nonetheless virtually unanimous agreement to the view that THE SEA-WOLF is most engaging in the exclusively male sections before "the twittering Maud Brewster" sets foot on the Ghost. The scornful epithet is Franklin Walker's,6 but the contempt that it expresses has fallen ceaselessly on the head of poor Maud Brewster. With her arrival, argues Charles N. Watson, the narrative is overtaken by a "saccharine conventionality" which "unquestionably robs the last third of the novel of much of its power." John Perry is of similar mind, but rather blunter: "After Larsen dies . . . the novel degenerates into pure literary bosh." He imagines the Van Weydens living "happily ever after, correcting each other's proofs." Robert Forrey finds Maud "an unbelievable, bloodless character," while Joan D. Hedrick describes her, with conspicuous impatience, as "elegant and insufferable," "a good little mother" who exchanges with Humphrey, "at greater length than the reader would wish?the banalities of their sentimental love." Clarice Stasz and Susan Ward perceive in Maud a somewhat more balanced array of qualities, aligning her with moral principle, spirituality, social idealism, and</page><page sequence="3">180 London's notion of "the mate-woman." As the correlative of her virtue, however, they find her slender ("the most ethereal and idealized of all London's female characters") and, "in keeping with nineteenth-century fictional convention," utterly subordinate to the male protagonists.7 While the sheer weight of consensus on the score of Maud Brewster is certainly clear, and perhaps readily understood, there is some cause, I believe, to review the textual evidence upon which any such judgment must be based. In what follows I will scrutinize the characterization of Maud in order to test the common view that she is a "twittering" female. I take it as my thesis that the heroine of THE SEA-WOLF is a much more distinctive and sophisticated and forceful character than her fictional companions, and the critics, have recognized. There are ironies that attach to this failure of critical penetration; and the characteristic condescension to Maud can be seen as cognate with larger warps in understanding. I want to suggest, in other words, that a reassessment of Maud Brewster, though in itself a relatively narrow undertaking, may offer avenues of approach to new interpretations of the novel as a whole. II Joan D. Hedrick speaks for a host of critics and numberless readers in finding that THE SEA-WOLF enforces "a choice between the man's world of raw power and the woman's world of poetry and 'culture,' a choice between Wolf Larsen and Maud Brewster."8 The consensus that this assertion articulates is doubly remarkable. In the first place, one cannot fail to be struck by the fact that the contrast between extreme stereotypes of gender should lead irresistibly and directly to the necessity for choice. It appears that this juxtaposition of male and female types is so heavily laden with cultural freight that its witnesses are powerless to reserve judgment or to consider more balanced alternatives, but instead respond reflexively by seizing on one extreme or the other. Second, if we are a little uneasy with the apparent cultural authority of such a radical polarization of male and female images, then we will be even more unsettled when we recognize that the consensus construction of the obligatory "choice" results from a curiously selective treatment of textual evidence. In other words, a cultural habituation to polarized gender stereotypes has informed?or, as I will argue, misinformed?the critical perception of the text. This predisposition to extremes is especially pronounced in the standard critical view of Maud Brewster. The response to Maud, ranging from faint praise to outright contempt, has its source in the perception that she is a conventional, repressed Victorian prude whose totally sublimated libido renders her frail, dependent, poetic ("twittering"), sexless, and therefore, by some familiar but nonetheless peculiar brand of logic, "cultured." To the extent that its artistic design is compatible with absolute reliability in such matters, the text of THE SEA-WOLF tells us that Maud is at once none of this and much more than this. The text is perfectly unequivocal in describing Maud's enthusiasm for clubbing seals to death. To be sure, her primitive vigor is mingled with a rough kind of sportsmanship; thus whenever a seal "looked tired and lagged, she let it slip past. But I noticed, also, whenever one, with a show of fight, tried to break past, that her eyes glinted and showed bright, and she rapped it smartly with her club. 'My, it's exciting!' she cried, pausing from sheer weakness."9 And lest we conclude that this upsurge of predatory gusto is totally</page><page sequence="4">181 without foundation in Maud's experience, the text gives clear evidence that she is a longstanding disciple of David Starr Jordan and his muscular philosophy of the strenuous life and Anglo-Saxon superiority. Maud's readiness for seal killing derives, she says, from her reading in Jordan; and she assures Humphrey that the dynamic president of Stanford University has been a leading influence on her values and behavior: "When I dismantled my old Pantheon and cast out Napoleon and Caesar and their fellows, I straightway erected a new Pantheon," she answered gravely, "and the first I installed was Dr. Jordan." "A modern hero." "And a greater because modern," she added. "How can the Old World heroes compare with ours!" (p. 243)10 It is hero worship of this animated cast, in combination with her native energy and aggressiveness, that brings Maud so readily into Wolf Larsen?s orbit. Something quite the opposite of the conventional is at work in her conscious and unembarrassed attraction to the brutally virile captain of the Ghost. It is evident from the moment of her arrival on board the schooner that she is deeply responsive to Wolf Larsen's magnetism. Her sensitivity to his vibrant energy is so acute that she is aware of his proximity to Endeavor Island before he has actually arrived. A similar responsiveness informs Maud's verbal exchanges with Larsen. This is especially the case during their climactic debate on the nature of love, in which Maud takes arms against the captain's resolute materialism. Her face, Humphrey observes, was one "that rarely displayed color, but to-night it was flushed and vivacious. Her wit was playing keenly, and she was enjoying the tilt as much as Wolf Larsen, and he was enjoying it hugely" (p. 173). For both parties, it seems evident, the discussion has more to do with the release of convergent passion than with the articulation of philosophical differences. Thus when Maud whispers to Larsen, "You are Lucifer" (p. 175), and then steps out of the cabin, it is clear that she is deeply of the Devil's party, and that she knows it. It is equally clear that Humphrey does not know it. His failure to properly gauge Maud's mood is evident enough in his declaration that she is overcome by an "unnamable and unmistakable terror" (p. 175) as she utters her parting words to Larsen. If Maud is terrified at all, then we must imagine that her fear is largely directed to the intensity of her own attraction to Larsen. But she is also excited?"flushed and vivacious"?and what Humphrey interprets as fear must have some foundation in her feeling of exhilaration at the discovery of a human spirit that at once stimulates and answers her own. This is not to romanticize in the slightest the sexual predator in Wolf Larsen. It is merely to point out that Humphrey's inclination to find Maud fearful tells us at least as much about him as it does about her. This is once again the case when, at another point in the story, Humphrey observes that Maud is "greatly perturbed" as she and Larsen approach: "She made some idle remark, looking at me, and laughed lightly enough; but I saw her eyes return to his, involuntarily, as though fascinated; then they fell, but not swiftly enough to veil the rush of terror that filled them" (p. 149). Again, "terror" is much too narrow a word, for it fails to register the fascination and surrender in Maud's response to her companion. Her mood makes fuller sense to us when we go on to read that Larsen's eyes, "ordinarily gray and cold and harsh,"</page><page sequence="5">182 were now "golden" and "enticing and masterful, [and] at the same time luring and compelling, and speaking a demand and clamor of the blood which no woman, much less Maud Brewster, could misunderstand" (p. 150). Maud knows, and Humphrey seems to recognize, that the situation is supercharged with sexual energy. To be sure, Maud's evident excitement must have fear as one of its ingredients; but to characterize Maud as merely fearful is to flatten the complex tonality of her emotion.11 As I have already suggested, we can begin to account for the reductive inadequacy of the descriptive language by turning from its object, Maud, to its source, Humphrey. As her social and cultural peer, her admirer, protector, and prospective husband, Humphrey Van Weyden may strikes us as ideally situated to provide a comprehensive, sympathetic portrait of Maud Brewster. Indeed, the general tendency to fault the characterization of Maud is strong evidence that readers have found Humphrey fair and credible. In fact, however, Humphrey's perspective on his future mate is obstructed and distorted in two closely related ways. Most obviously, perhaps, Humphrey's impressions of Maud are powerfully influenced by his feelings for Wolf Larsen. In the second of the episodes just discussed, for example, Humphrey's attention to Maud's "terror" follows as the direct sequel to a detailed portrait of her companion, Wolf Larsen: He was splendidly muscled, a heavy man, and though he strode with the certitude and directness of the physical man. there was nothing heavy about his stride. The jungle and the wilderness lurked in the uplift and downput of his feet. He was cat-footed, and lithe, and strong, always strong. I likened him to some great tiger, a beast of prowess and prey. He looked it, and the piercing glitter that arose at times in his eyes was the same piercing glitter I had observed in the eyes of caged leopards and other preying creatures of the wild. (p. 149) The homoeroticism of the passage requires little in the way of comment; the admiring Van Weyden is quite evidently fascinated with and powerfully attracted to the man he describes. He draws his attention away from Larsen long enough to describe Maud's marked perturbation, and then returns, with Maud, to gaze upon the captain's amorous eyes. So alluring is Larsen's glance that it triggers in Humphrey precisely the same response that he has just ascribed to Maud. Her "own terror rushed upon me," he reports, and in that moment of fear,?the most terrible fear a man can experience,?I knew that in inexpressible ways she was dear to me. The knowledge that I loved her rushed upon me with the terror, and with both emotions gripping at my heart and causing my blood at the same time to chill and to leap riotously, I felt myself drawn by a power without me and beyond me, and found my eyes returning against my will to gaze into the eyes of Wolf Larsen. (p. 150) A fully satisfactory analysis of Humphrey's sometimes baffling state of mind is not easily achieved. At the least, however, it seems safe to say that his sexual</page><page sequence="6">183 attraction to Larsen is at once powerfully resurgent and utterly unacceptable to consciousness. He eases the tension arising from these contradictory tendencies by retreating to the illusion that Maud is the object of his erotic attention, and by imagining that his own fear of Larsen's sexual authority merely echoes the "terror" that he observes in Maud, and in fact projects upon her. This construction of the situation, though conspicuous in its distortions, is brilliant in its overall psychological economy. Maud is rather tepidly "dear" to Humphrey at this early stage in their acquaintance, but the illusion of an attraction to her functions to draw attention away from his obsession with Larsen, and to suggest that his preoccupation with the captain is the outgrowth of his obligations as Maud's anxious lover. In concert with these notions about his own feelings, Humphrey takes it for granted that Maud is as headlong and undistracted in her esteem for him as he supposes he is for her. This assumption has a dual function in his fabricated scheme of things. On one side, it reinforces his sense of himself as a virile and protecting male, and thus serves to ease emergent misgivings about his attraction to Larsen. On the other, it lends plausibility to the view that Maud responds to Larsen with simple "terror," and thus serves Humphrey's unconscious ambition to remove her from the field of amorous competition. After all, if Maud is merely afraid of the captain, then she can have no interest in competing for his attention. As it is, of course, she competes quite well. But because Humphrey cannot consciously accept his own attraction to Larsen, he cannot face Maud's either. Instead, he imagines himself thrust together with Maud in a conventional heterosexual dyad, offering terrified but valiant resistance to the intrusions of a predatory brute. If a barely contained erotic attraction to Wolf Larsen works in the immediate foreground to limit and obstruct Humphrey's perception of Maud Brewster, then his general attitude toward women and femininity forms the background to the same phenomenon. This second obstruction to a clear-eyed perspective on Maud has its foundation in Humphrey's history of dependence on maternal figures for comfort and culture, and a potently reactive inclination to view women as soft, weak, helpless and fearful. One pole of this ambivalence disposes Humphrey to stand in fear and contempt of what he perceives to be the hypertrophy of the feminine component in his own make-up. Indeed, the very first episode in THE SEA-WOLF features Humphrey's extraordinary reaction to his own panic aboard the sinking Martinez. It was "the screaming of the women, that most tried my nerves," he recalls: I realized I was becoming hysterical myself; for these were women of my own kind, like my mother and sisters, with the fear of death upon them and unwilling to die. And I remember that the sounds they made reminded me of the squealing of pigs under the knife of the butcher, and I was struck with horror at the vividness of the analogy, (p. 7) Possessed as he is of such disgust and contempt for what he considers the feminine in himself, it is little wonder that Humphrey reacts as he does to Wolf Larsen, and that he learns to enjoy life in the company of men at sea. It was during the period "between the death of Johansen and the arrival on the sealing grounds," he recalls, "that I passed my pleasantest hours on the Ghost. . . . During that brief time I was proud of myself, and I grew to love the heave and roll of the Ghost under my feet"</page><page sequence="7">184 (pp. 103-104). When this interval of relative happiness and growth is interrupted by Maud Brewster, she appears to Humphrey "a being from another world." She reminds him of "what a delicate, fragile creature a woman is," and he marvels at the "smallness and softness" of her arms. This pronounced condescension is the direct reflex of Humphrey's proud masculinity, but as such it is also an oblique manifestation of his deeply ingrained contempt for feminine frailty. When we observe Humphrey "bustl[ing] about in quite housewifely fashion" (p. 126), we may be sure that he has not outgrown those feminine proclivities that he fears and despises in himself, and that Maud's arrival on the Ghost has evidently revived. Thus Humphrey's rather baffled admission that he is "strangely afraid of this woman" (p. 125) should come as little surprise. After all, Maud is a direct threat?both as sexual competition and as a reminder of what he has suppressed in himself?to Humphrey's delicate psychological equilibrium. In response, he fabricates an image of Maud as so "ethereally slender and delicate" (p. 125) that it serves to reinforce, by contrast, his precarious manhood, and at the same time lends a veneer of plausibility to his insistence that she responds with simple "terror" to Wolf Larsen. To argue, as I have, that Humphrey's characterization of Maud Brewster cannot be properly understood in separation from the idiosyncratic imperatives of his interior life is, willy-nilly, to throw open the much larger question of narrative point of view in THE SEA-WOLF. It is not my intention to continue to pursue this important question here, though it may be just as well to underscore my sense that the tone and structure of this narrative are directly and everywhere the mirror of Humphrey's complex, often baffling, construction of reality. Nor is this to deny that many interpretations of the novel involve an awareness of Humphrey's suppressions and exaggerations. For example, when Robert Forrey argues that "the only true passion in the novel is Van Weyden's feelings for Larsen,"12 he has quite obviously taken the measure of the narrator's repeated assertions of love for Maud. But Forrey's failure to notice that Maud Brewster's feelings for Larsen are, in their way, as passionate and "true" as Humphrey's, is characteristic of the criticism in this vein. To be sure, it follows from Humphrey's jealous refusal to countenance competition that his own attraction to Larsen is more in evidence than Maud's. Nonetheless, the uniform readiness, exemplified in Forrey's analysis, to acquiesce in Humphrey's two-dimensional characterization of Maud may well be the symptom of a cultural squeamishness on the score of sexual desire in women. We have been complicit, perhaps, in the novel's misconstructions. Cultural factors notwithstanding, however, the primary causes of critical short-sightedness in the case of Maud Brewster have been the unconscious distortions and suppressions in the narrative itself.13 Ill It remains to limn out as plausible and full a portrait of Maud Brewster as the scattered hints and clues in the narrative of THE SEA-WOLF will permit. The most promising point of departure for this process of reconstruction is to probe more deeply into Humphrey's representation of Maud's responses to Wolf Larsen. For as events unfold, the gap between Maud's actual feelings and Van Weyden's description of them grows wider and more conspicuous. This is the case, for example, when Humphrey rescues Maud from Larsen's attempted rape. Humphrey reacts with "an overmastering rage" at the offender, though it is not clear whether</page><page sequence="8">185 it is Larsen's sexual threat or his evident sexual attraction for Maud that most arouses his jealous anger. In either case, Humphrey is about to stab the mysteriously faltering captain when Maud intervenes with an appeal for mercy. Her arms were around me, her hair was brushing my face. My pulse rushed up in an unwonted manner, yet my rage mounted with it. She looked me bravely in the eyes. "For my sake," she begged. "I would kill him for your sake," I cried, trying to free my arm without hurting her. "Hush!" she said, and laid her fingers lightly on my lips. I could have kissed them, had I dared, even then, in my rage, the touch of them was so sweet, so very sweet. "Please, please," she pleaded, and she disarmed me by the words, as I was to discover they would ever disarm me. (pp. 176-177) Maud is undoubtedly grateful for timely assistance, but her behavior nonetheless betrays a deeper solicitude for Larsen than circumstances would seem to warrant. The helpless victim of violent sexual assault, she betrays not a flicker of an impulse to punish her attacker. If Humphrey is puzzled by this response, he does not say so; nor does he pause to reflect upon the fact that Maud's embrace is primarily an expression of concern for her brutal assailant. Instead, his consciousness is engulfed in Maud's disarming physical attractions. This is evidence that his swing toward the heterosexual side of the erotic spectrum, as described by Charles N. Watson, Jr., is well under way. Meanwhile, Maud's apparent concern for Larsen, along with the bold directness of her approach and the deft self-confidence of her physical address, combine to suggest that she has the narrator right where she wants him. This suggestion becomes even stronger as Humphrey's attraction to Maud continues to grow, and as Larsen's physical deterioration enters its final phase. These developments combine to create a situation in which Humphrey's infatuated credulity affords Maud greater freedom to exercise her deep concern for the failing captain. This is the case, for example, at the very end of the novel, when Larsen's body is buried at sea. Humphrey looks on as his companion salutes their quondam oppressor: "'Good-by, Lucifer, proud spirit,' Maud whispered, so low that it was drowned by the shouting of the wind; but I saw the movement of her lips and knew" (pp. 255-256). Knew what? we may wonder. To be sure, Humphrey is able to report Maud's words; and we believe that he gets them straight. But he responds with blank literalness to language and gestures that echo and bristle with suggestion. "Lucifer" is a direct reminder of the occasion when Maud responded most intensely to Larsen's sexual power, and it is indirectly allusive to a much broader tradition of romantic rebellion against civilized constraints. Humphrey, the sensitive man of letters, is apparently unmoved. Nor does he register a reaction to the clear possibility that Maud whispers to Larsen because what she has to say is intimate, private, not to be shared. On the other side, however, our narrator's apparent insensitivity is belied by the fact that he listens attentively, and even resorts to lip-reading in order to retrieve Maud's words. And he moves with striking rapidity from the observation that Maud addresses Larsen in sotto voce to the conclusion that it is the audible force of the gale that nearly drowns her out. In fact, we must imagine that the wind's "shouting" is indirectly the</page><page sequence="9">186 expression of a pole of Humphrey's profoundly ambivalent reaction to the scene that he witnesses. On one hand, he cannot turn his eyes away; on the other, he cannot bear to see. And while he is careful to listen, he is unwilling to listen carefully. Humphrey's ambivalence registers textually in a pattern of ironic ambiguity that comes increasingly to characterize the accounts of his exchanges with Maud. The narrative shows more than it consciously tells because, for reasons that should now be clear, Maud's gains in confidence and assertiveness are matched by a commensurate decline in Humphrey's willingness to see. Thus when Maud learns that Humphrey is about to take revolvers with him on a visit to the enfeebled Wolf Larsen, she pleads with him not to go. Assuming that she is concerned for his own safety, and not for Larsen's, Humphrey lapses into a fatuous effusion: "The dear and lovely woman! And she was so much the woman, clinging and appealing, sunshine and dew to my manhood, rooting it deeper and sending through it the sap of a new strength." Thus exalted, he assures Maud that there is no danger: "I'll merely peep over the bow and see" (p. 216). Given his assumptions about the nature of Maud's solicitude, it is hardly surprising that Humphrey is a bit disconcerted when, a few days later, she urges him to look in on the ailing captain. Now, in place of what he had so confidently assumed was fear for his own welfare, he sees an unmistakable concern for Larsen in Maud's insistence that "we must do something." Puzzled, resistant to an emergent revelation, Humphrey temporizes with "perhaps," Inwardly he frets, "Where was her solicitude for me . . . for me whom she had been afraid to have merely peep aboard?" (pp. 216-217). If Humphrey goes on to reflect that Maud's sense of safety is linked to the fact that this time he is unarmed, and therefore scarcely a threat to Larsen, he does not say so. Instead, he retreats to the view that her concern is the outgrowth of natural feminine tenderness and charity for human distress wherever it appears. This episode provides a clear supplement to our understanding of Maud Brewster. First, it tends to confirm that her attraction to Larsen is a much deeper emotion than Humphrey can bear to acknowledge or express in his narrative. It also lends support to the view that Maud is adept at playing along the margins of Humphrey's credulity, and that she is willing and perfectly able, when it is necessary, to coddle him, and to manipulate his pliant readiness to be deceived. Thus when she sees that her manifest care for Larsen is about to arouse Humphrey's resentment, she invites him to view her in a way that is compatible with his vulnerable masculine self-esteem: "You must go aboard, Humphrey," she insists, but "if you want to laugh at me, you have my consent and forgiveness" (p. 217). Once reassured of his own superiority, and of Maud's laughably "feminine" over-concern for Larsen, Humphrey is restored to docile equanimity. He offers no further protest to Maud's request?"I arose obediently and went down the beach"?and when he returns to report that the captain's "head was all right again," Maud is free to display "obvious relief" and "a more cheerful mood," without stirring jealous misgivings. Maud appears to understand that occasional, well timed strokes to Humphrey's male vanity render him pliant to her will and acquiescent in the illusion that her concern for Larsen is driven by harmless "feminine" solicitude. At the price of at once fueling and surrendering to her companion's foolish condescension, Maud quickly gains the upper hand. Thus when she is next concerned for Larsen's welfare she has only to adopt a properly anxious</page><page sequence="10">187 posture and Humphrey is putty in her hands. "I could see Maud's solicitude again growing," he reports, though she timidly,?and even proudly, I think,?forebore a repetition of her request. After all, what censure could be put upon her? She was divinely altruistic, and she was a woman. ... So I did not wait a second time for Maud to send me. I discovered that we stood in need of condensed milk and marmalade, and announced that I was going aboard, (pp. 217 218) Maud must know that the blindness which Humphrey so evidently cultivates, and which she quietly and artfully reinforces, is the leading source of her power over him. It is also the source of abundant humor. For once it has been glimpsed, the gathering irony of Humphrey's condescension to Maud becomes impossible to ignore. As we have seen, when Humphrey first interprets Maud's "Please, please" as a sweetly desperate woman's appeal to his superior masculine authority, he fails utterly, and comically, to recognize the extent of Maud's control. The humor redoubles itself later in the narrative when Humphrey adopts a sternly paternal tone in chiding Maud for her misbehavior: She looked penitent. "I'll be good," she said, as a naughty child might say it. "I promise?" "To obey as a sailor would obey his captain?" "Yes," she answered. "It was stupid of me, I know." "Then you must promise something else," I ventured. "Readily." "That you will not say, 'Please, please,' too often; for when you do you are sure to override my authority." She laughed with amused appreciation. She, too, had noticed the power of the repeated 'please.' "It is a good word?" I began. "But I must not overwork it," she broke in. But she laughed weakly, and her head drooped again. (p. 185) To imagine that Maud Brewster is even remotely genuine in responding as a "naughty" but ultimately docile child is to ignore completely the energy and authority she displays in other circumstances. For special reasons of his own, Humphrey makes this mistake, and his failure to recognize the strength of the woman before him is the source of humor. But the deeper comedy emerges from the gathering impression, underscored here by the debate over the recurrent "Please, please," that Maud's mastery is so complete that she is now free to indulge a bold chuckle at her companion's bottomless folly. Indeed, her amusement may in fact exceed her formidable powers of self-control. Whatever the case, when Humphrey assumes that Maud's laughter expresses her "amused appreciation" of his penetration, his error is comically symptomatic, for it rests on the smug assurance that he is the source of the humor, not its object. But Maud is not laughing with him, she is laughing at his perfectly transcendent obtuseness. Thus it is prudence and not, as Humphrey imagines, weakness that prompts her to drop her head before laughing a second time; after all, to give vent to her real</page><page sequence="11">188 amusement would betray, and therefore jeopardize, her power.14 Maud resorts twice more to "Please, please" in having her way with Humphrey, and on both occasions the gambit is successful.15 A leading element in the humor that continues to accumulate with each repetition of the phrase is Humphrey's evident assurance that he gives in to Maud only when she uses these words. In fact, he is in a state of continuous submission to her will. He is perhaps easiest for Maud to manipulate when his towering vanity is in the foreground, blinding him to his equally prodigious foolishness. Control is less easily achieved when it comes to Humphrey's much more complex pretensions as a lover. Maud is confronted with a totally inexperienced and hopelessly bookish suitor whose amorous inclinations are deeply ambivalent, and therefore halting and uncertain in their emergence and expression* Knowing as she must that her ultimate welfare is perilously dependent on Humphrey's wavering masculine will to survive, she must contrive to stimulate and nourish his erotic illusions without precipitating a challenge to his manhood. To make matters even worse, she must somehow control an overpowering impulse to laugh out loud. The exact course of Maud's approach to an understanding of Humphrey's sexual nature is not easily charted. There is just the slightest suggestion that this process commences on the day of her arrival aboard the Ghost. For as "one of the sailors lifted her into Wolf Larsen's downstretched arms, she looked up into our curious faces and smiled amusedly and sweetly" (p. 124). Perhaps her amusement arises from the perception of something more than simple curiosity in Humphrey's eyes. In any case, for many chapters thereafter, and most especially after Larsen begins his decline, the reader is witness to Humphrey's gathering impression that he is sexually drawn to Maud. I use "impression" purposely to suggest?what the text certainly suggests?that Humphrey's sexual promptings may in fact be an overflow of literary energies pretty much confined to his head. For if Humphrey admires Maud's "Dear, damp brown hair" as it tumbles over her shoulders, and wants "to kiss it, to ripple it through my fingers, to bury my face in it," such plausibly sexual ambitions dissipate immediately and entirely in a prolonged meditation on the nature of love, moving from "physical characteristics" through the "essence of the spirit" to closing philosophical reflections on the proposition that "Jehovah was anthropomorphic because he could address himself to the Jews only in terms of their understanding" (p. 182). In the hands of John Donne, such learned metaphysics might well form the prologue to a witty invitation to bed; in the hands of Humphrey Van Weyden, however, they are the expression of a rapid, breathless retreat. As time passes, Humphrey appears to persuade himself that the obstacles to his erotic self-expression are in fact civilized injunctions to sublimation. Insisting that "the declaration of my love urged and trembled on my tongue a thousand times," he flatters himself "that by look or sign I gave no advertisement of the love I felt for her." This proud assertion of self-control would be more persuasive if it did not resolve itself in the pronouncement that "We were like good comrades, and we grew better comrades as the days went by" (p. 190). Is the model of male friendship resorted to reluctantly, as a necessary alternative to romantic love, or is it the only avenue of erotic expression presently open to Humphrey? At the very least, we may be sure that he protests too much about the urgency of his passion, and that the principal issue of his sexuality is a confused, increasingly</page><page sequence="12">189 desperate sense of emotional thwartedness. Perhaps Maud senses her companion's frustrated groping; perhaps she has an intimation of the near panic that impels him to resolve to "take her in my arms and proclaim my love, and, with her in my embrace, to make the desperate struggle and die" (p. 192). But there can be no doubt that she comes gradually to recognize his uncertainty, as it expresses itself in a nervous, jerky vacillation between desire and retreat that would be merely touching and amusing were it not for its occasional veerings toward destruction. This characteristic pattern reveals itself in the sequel to the exhilarating seal hunt, when the return to the cove brings Humphrey to the verge of a romantic declaration: "It's just like home-coming," Maud said, as I ran the boat ashore. I heard her words with a responsive thrill, it was all so dearly intimate and natural, and I said: "It seems as though I have lived this life always. The world of books and bookish folk is very vague, more like a dream memory than an actuality. I surely have hunted and forayed and fought all the days of my life. And you, too, seem a part of it. You are?" I was on the verge of saying, "my woman, my mate," but glibly changed it to?"standing the hardship well." But her ear had caught the flaw. She recognized a flight that midmost broke. She gave me a quick look. "Not that. You were saying??" "That the American Mrs. Meynell was living the life of a savage and living it quite successfully," I said easily. "Oh," was all she replied; but I could have sworn there was a note of disappointment in her voice, (pp. 204-205) Maud's unsuccessful attempt to extract an amorous declaration from Humphrey is prompted, it seems likely, by a cluster of interwoven sentiments. There is undoubtedly pleasure in the exercise of her power to attract and control, and there must be amusement. More vitally, there is a determination to cultivate in Humphrey the energy and optimism requisite to survival. She has witnessed his lapses into despondency; she is skillful at bringing him around. Finally, and especially toward the end of the novel, Maud may begin to respond to Humphrey with affection. If she does warm to him, however, it is with the amused tenderness that an adult might bring to a well-meaning but hopelessly clumsy boy. This perspective on the relationship has an important initial source in the vagueness and ambivalence that characterize Humphrey's attitude toward Maud. "She was," he says more than once, "the one woman in the world?the one small woman, as I loved to think of her" (p. 198). The decided ambiguity of "small" is nowhere more in evidence than when Maud puckishly describes herself to Humphrey as "only one small woman": That phrase, the "one small woman," startled me like an electric shock. It was my own phrase, my pet, secret phrase, my love phrase for her. "Where did you get that phrase?" I demanded, with an abruptness that in turn startled her.</page><page sequence="13">190 "What phrase?" she asked. "One small woman." "Is it yours?" she asked. "Yes," I answered, "mine. I made it." "Then you must have talked in your sleep," she smiled. The dancing, tremulous light was in her eyes. Mine, I knew, were speaking beyond the will of my speech. I leaned toward her. Without volition I leaned toward her, as a tree is swayed by the wind. Ah, we were very close together in that moment. But she shook her head, as one might shake off sleep or a dream, saying: "I have known it all my life. It was my father's name for my mother." "It is my phrase, too," I said stubbornly. "For your mother?" "No," I answered, and she questioned no further, though I could have sworn her eyes retained for some time a mocking, teasing expression, (pp. 249-250) Humphrey's final, rather coy refusal to explain himself does nothing to obscure the fact that Maud is in total control of both the terms and the direction of this conversation. Indeed, it is at once the foundation and the capstone of her authority that her companion is only dimly and fitfully aware that he has been mastered. She has fully fathomed poor Humphrey's 'love phrase," and she is positively feline in forcing him to the indirect admission that the words are important to him principally because they are his, and not because they describe her. Having exposed his wonderfully obtuse possessiveness, Maud then brings attention indirectly to bear on the fact that it is mother, and not a lover, that "one small woman" ultimately points to. Humphrey is perfectly blind to the clear direction of Maud's ironic thrusts, and so he fails to recognize that "The dancing, tremulous light ... in her eyes" is laughter, and not, as he imagines, amorous excitement. Only at the very end of the encounter does he glimpse her "mocking, teasing expression," but the hint is quickly absorbed, as Maud knows it will be, into Humphrey's infatuated illusions. This wonderfully funny exchange brings us as close as we come in THE SEA WOLF to a direct disclosure of Maud's control of Humphrey's feelings and actions. Her refusal to reveal her mastery is, of course, perfectly apposite: to give up the secret would spoil the fun; and, more crucially, it would totally undermine her control and thereby jeopardize her chances of survival. But the passage is also evidence that Maud gives indirect expression to her hidden feelings with her eyes. The eyes are safer than words, she seems to understand, because their language is so readily misconstrued. Thus the mirth in her glance is lost on Humphrey, who is correct only in assuming that his own eyes "were speaking beyond the will of vmy speech." Humphrey makes an identical observation earlier in the novel when, after an especially animated discussion with Maud, he wonders whether "our eyes were speaking beyond the will of our speech?" (p. 228). The answer to his reiterated concern is evidently affirmative, though it should be added that Maud controls her eyes quite as carefully as she controls her words, and that Humphrey is as tone deaf when it comes to eye-speech as he is with the ordinary variety.</page><page sequence="14">191 I count fifty-six references to eyes in THE SEA-WOLF, and the total is undoubtedly shy a dozen or so. Many of these references are routine descriptions, in themselves hardly noteworthy. But it is notable that the eyes of the principal actors in THE SEA-WOLF are frequently avenues of expression for powerful emotions, such as the mute "terror" that Humphrey detects in Maud, or the sexual feelings of Wolf Larsen?feelings whose verbal expression would have offended readers of London's time. When the captain is aroused in Maud's presence, "his eyes flash golden" (p. 164). Soon afterwards, as he listens to her recital of poetry, his eyes once again flash "their golden light" (p. 174). This pattern culminates when Larsen gives voice to Satan's speech of heroic defiance from PARADISE LOST. As Larsen speaks, Humphrey observes "his eyes, golden and masculine, intensely masculine and insistently soft, flashing upon Maud at the door" (p. 175). Rather later in the novel, after the onset of Larsen's physical decline, the initiative in the language of the eyes passes to Maud. Her eyes speak quite directly to Humphrey at the commencement of his protracted struggle to raise the masts on the beached wreck of the Ghost. The humor of the situation is aptly characterized by Charles N. Watson, Jr., as a "sexual pas de deux in which Humphrey struggles to erect the phallic mast on the derelict ship only to have Wolf repeatedly knock it down again."16 As a first step in the project, Humphrey succeeds in building a pair of "shears," an apparatus designed to lift the heavy masts. Success so excites him that he finds himself "wild with desire, like a child with a new toy, to hoist something with my shears": "I wish it weren't so late," I said. "I'd like to see how it works." "Don't be a glutton, Humphrey," Maud chided me. "Remember, to-morrow is coming, and you're so tired now that you can hardly stand." "And you?" I said, with sudden solicitude. "You must be very tired. You have worked hard and nobly. I am proud of you, Maud." "Not half so proud as I am of you, nor with half the reason," she answered, looking me straight in the eyes for a moment with an expression in her own and a dancing, tremulous light which I had not seen before and which gave me a pang of quick delight,?I know not why, for I did not understand it. Then she dropped her eyes, to lift them again, laughing. "If our friends could see us now," she said. (p. 228) Maud cannot fail to be amused by Humphrey's boyish enthusiasm, though her familiar language ("glutton") suggests that her good humor is shaded with impatience. Humphrey responds with praise for her exertions, but his tone is so patronizing, and his judgments so heavily baited for a complimentary response, that Maud's sense of irony seems to ignite. Her reply is perfectly ambiguous, and Humphrey is left trying to make sense of the "dancing, tremulous light" in her eyes. In the upshot, he allows that he is confused, and perhaps he is; but there can be no confusion about the fact that when Maud looks up she is laughing. We are witness to "the dancing, tremulous light" in Maud's eyes on two</page><page sequence="15">192 occasions, and the aggregate impression yielded by the paired passages is of warmth arising more out of mirth than out of esteem or affection. A much more somber humor passes through Maud's eyes the third time they light up. The setting is one of gathering desperation. Maud and Humphrey have exhausted themselves in an effort to tow the drifting masts back to their beach. Disheartened, totally fatigued, and apparently resigned to the worst, Humphrey begins to cast off the heavy timbers. Maud can barely contain her panic as she seizes his hand and tries to impress him with the dire consequences of giving up. Humphrey hesitates, but remains undecided until Maud reminds him that towing the mast was his idea: "I want to see you succeed," she urges. He begins to bend under the gratifying weight of her flattery, and Maud, sensing an opportune moment, plays her trump. "I am afraid you will cast off the masts in spite of me," she cries. "Oh, please, please, Humphrey, don't!" The magic words work, the towing continues, a fair wind greets them in the morning, and the newly hopeful Humphrey rouses the hollow-eyed Maud: "Oh, you brave, brave woman," I said, when I saw the life coming back into her face. "Did you know that you were brave?" "I never used to be," she answered. "I was never brave till I knew you. It is you who have made me brave." "Nor I, until I knew you," I answered. She gave me a quick look, and again I caught that dancing, tremulous light and something more in her eyes. But it was only for the moment. Then she smiled. "It must have been the conditions," she said; but I knew she was wrong, and I wondered if she likewise knew. (pp. 233 234) Humphrey may need to feel that is Maud is wrong about the "conditions," for the implication of her comment is mordantly ironic. As usual, his tone in this exchange is patronizing and implicitly self-congratulatory. Maud leaves the assertion of her bravery nominally intact, but the insistence that her own virtue merely reflects Humphrey's draws attention to the fact that bravery had virtually nothing to do with the decision to continue with the towing. That decision commences in desperation, passes through panic and fear and transparent flattery, and terminates in a well-timed assertion of power. Thus when Humphrey seizes on Maud's response to claim bravery for himself, the conspicuous lack of precisely that quality falls painfully open to view. Maud may perceive as well that the brief dialogue, ostensibly originating in praise for her, has only begun to serve Humphrey's purposes when the praise, specious and contrived as it is, comes back to shore up his fractured self-esteem. But the truth about bravery would just as surely crush Humphrey now as the weight of failure crushes his spirits the night before. Thus Maud serves the interests of her own survival when she flatters him, and coddles his illusions, and merely hints at what she knows?that it was "conditions," and not bravery, especially not Humphrey's, that got them through. Meanwhile her eyes speak her darkly ironic amusement in terms that her companion cannot possible fathom. IV The Maud Brewster who emerges from this analysis of THE SEA-WOLF is</page><page sequence="16">193 hardly the repressed Victorian prude to be found in most of the criticism of the novel. Rather, she is mature, resourceful, emotionally responsive, shrewd in her assessment and control of her environment, possessed of great good humor, and determined to survive. In all, she is easily the most impressive human being to set foot on the Ghost. The men in her world seem hopelessly narrow, obsessive, self-deceived, self-destructive, solipsistic, and therefore, in one way or another, doomed. It remains to add that this general perspective on the characters in THE SEA-WOLF raises more questions than it answers. How, for all these years, can we have been so wide of the mark? If the critics have in fact missed the novel's thrust, especially when it comes to Maud, then why is this so? What is it in our culture, or, more narrowly, in our critical prepossessions, that so blinds us? And, finally, what is the relationship between the Maud Brewster who surfaces in this analysis and the intentions, conscious and submerged, artistic and otherwise, of her maker? It goes without saying that I pose these questions only to pass them by. For now, it may be enough to emphasize that THE SEA-WOLF invites and generously repays much closer textual scrutiny than it has generally received. Consider, finally, the novel's conclusion. Viewed in the light of the foregoing analysis, is it possible to accept the critical consensus that this is a flat, sentimental, utterly conventional romantic egress? Or is it necessary to entertain the mueh more interesting possibility that his culminating passage is in fact bright and sparkling with irony and humorous suggestion? We are saved," I said soberly and solemnly. And then, in an exuberance of joy, "I hardly know whether to be glad or not." I looked at her. Our eyes were not loath to meet. We leaned toward each other, and before I knew it my arms were about her. "Need I?" I asked. And she answered, "There is no need, though the telling of it would be sweet, so sweet." Her lips met the press of mine, and by what strange trick of the imagination I know not, the scene in the cabin of the Ghost flashed upon me, when she had pressed her fingers lightly on my lips and said, "Hush, hush." "My woman, my one small woman," I said, my free hand petting her shoulder in the way all lovers know though never learn in school. "My man," she said, looking at me for an instant with tremulous lids which fluttered down and veiled her eyes as she snuggled her head against my breast with a happy little sigh. I looked toward the cutter. It was very close. A boat was being lowered. "One kiss, dear love," I whispered. "One kiss more before they come." "And rescue us from ourselves," she completed, with a most adorable smile, whimsical as I had never seen it, for it was whimsical with love. (p. 256)</page><page sequence="17">194 What shall we make of Humphrey's mingled response to the rescue, and of his final refusal (or incapacity) to find words for his feelings? By what "strange trick of the imagination" does his consciousness leap from this, their first embrace, to Maud's earlier, enigmatic defense of the sexually threatening Wolf Larsen? What, specifically, does this lapse suggest about the depth of Humphrey's confidence in Maud's esteem, and in his own readiness for this passionate, heterosexual attachment? On the other side, when Maud drops her eyes and sighs, is she surrendering to love, as Humphrey would have it, or is she suppressing a rather different response to her companion's "pet phrase"? Finally?though this hardly exhausts the questions the passage gives rise to?is Maud as "adorable" and "whimsical" as Humphrey imagines, or is her concluding statement expressive of sentiments characteristically complex, ironic, and utterly remote from the comprehension of her interlocutor?

Press, 1973), pp. 307-344. Starr offers specific evidence of London's close attention to some of Jordan's leading ideas. 11 The same failure of precision occurs on the other occasions when Humphrey uses "terror" to describe Maud's reactions to Larsen. See pp. 164 and 215. I2Forrey, p. 141. I3 While Robert Forrey goes on to add that Humphrey's homosexual desires "are clearly suspect" and that "one of the aims of the plot seems to be to purge Van Weyden of them" (p. 141), he fails to recognize that such suspicions and corrective ambitions as surface in THE SEA-WOLF are as intimately tied to the narrators's psychological organization as the homoerotic impulses to which they are addressed. It is Humphrey's manner of telling the story, and not "the plot," that betrays his attraction to Larsen, and his inability to consciously confront that suspicious attraction, and the ways and means of putting that attraction out of mind. I4Maud's closest call with self-betrayal occurs when Humphrey's masculine bravado prompts him to announce, "I am capable of doing anything these days" (p. 221). Maud succeeds in temporarily disguising her mirth, but her companion's foolishness is so invincible that she is finally incapable of controlling herself. Humphrey sees and rather dimly acknowledges the joke, but then gets so wound up in his own theorizing that he emerges virtually unscathed. As usual, Humphrey's vanity is Maud's best ally. i5See pp. 195 and 233. ?6"Sexual Conflict in THE SEA-WOLF," p. 246.
