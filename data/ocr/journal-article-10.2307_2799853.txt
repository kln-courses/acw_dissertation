<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOTEMISM YESTERDAY: SENTIMENT AND LOCAL ORGANISATION AMONG THE AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES NICOLAS PETERSON Australian National University In the current discussion of totemism, two emphases have been developed more or less independently. On the one hand Levi-Strauss concentrates on the intellectual aspects of totemism as a mode of thought, while on the other Fortes emphasises the affective aspects of an actor-centred morality. This difference in emphasis is partly due to the multi-faceted nature of the phenomena grouped under the totemic umbrella and partly to different interests within the commonly accepted problem. Levi-Strauss has taken up the classical association between totems and natural species: Fortes has focused on the prohibitions associated with totems, particularly those to do with eating. The difference between these two emphases runs much deeper than this, however, to the role of affect, emotion or sentiment in social organisation. While like Durkheim (I9I2 see i957),' Freud (I9I3 see I950), and Radcliffe-Brown (I929 see I952) Fortes sees sentiment as the fuel of totemism, Levi-Strauss views it as a threat to a rational system (cf Hiatt i969a: 9I-2). After quoting a passage from Strehlow recounting the Aranda's passionate love for the countryside over which the ancestral heroes travelled, he writes: When it is noted that these events and sites are the same as those which furnish the material of the symbolic systems ... it must be acknowledged that so-called primitive peoples have managed to evolve not unreasonable methods for inserting irrationality, in its dual aspects of logical contingence and emotional turbulence, into rationality. Classificatory systems thus allow the incorporation of history, even and particularly that which might be thought to defy the system. For make no mistake: the totemic myths which solemnly relate futile inci- dents and sentimentalise over particular places are comparable only to minor, lesser history (Le'vi-Strauss I966: 243) In this article I shall argue that sentiment was an integral part of traditional Austra- lian totemism and attempt to answer the ecological question: in what way, if any, did the system of totemism help maintain Aborigines in their environment? Perhaps for historical reasons related to the rapid breakdown of traditional subsistence behaviour, Aboriginal totemism has largely been considered in terms of a closed cultural system rather than within its pre-contact ecological context. The dangers of neglecting this context are indicated in Levi-Strauss's writings. Though the question of origin is not central to his hypothesis about totemism, his hypo- thesis does have a historical implication, as Hiatt (i969a: 9I) has pointed out. If social differentiation originally derived from an apprehension of speciation in nature, by implication, humanity must originally have been a formless mass. This is certainly false. It neglects, for instance, the basic ecological factors which, long before man or his ancestors had moieties or clans, would have caused social differentiation through dispersion in local populations. Like other writers, therefore,</page><page sequence="2">MAN, MARCH I972, VOL. 7, NO. I 13 Levi-Strauss overlooks the fundamental relationship between Australian Aboriginal totemic classification and locality. To anyone familiar with Aboriginal ethnography, the close association between totemic beliefs and locality is apparent-but the relationship between the two has been neglected in the construction of hypotheses about the nature of totemic phenomena in Australia. There are two reasons for this. One historical, based in the anthropological controversies at the turn of the century and the other a more general failure to place Aboriginal social organisation within a wider environmental context, thus compounding the historical neglect. I shall begin by discussing the historical reasons behind the neglect of the relationship between totemism and locality. I shall then document the existence of a relationship and explore its nature with ethnographic examples from two regions: the first example will be taken from the Murngin who live in the tropical wood- lands of Arnhem Land and the second from the Walbiri who live in the arid savannah of the Central Desert. Having established the nature of the relationship, I will examine the implications for other aspects of Aboriginal social organisation and propose a hypothesis about the nature and function of totemism in Australia. I do not wish to become involved in the problem of defining totemism but will simply take as a guide the definition used by Fortes (I967: 6) as '. . . beliefs and practices in which relations of a special kind between persons and designated groups of persons, on the one hand, and natural species of animals and plants or artificial objects, on the other, are postulated.' Frazer, Durkheim and the neglect of locality The principal reason for the neglect of the relationship between totemism and locality was the complete rejection of Frazer's views by Durkheim and in con- sequence by succeeding generations of anthropologists. Prior to the work of Spencer and Gillen among the Aranda, Frazer (i887 see I9IO, I: 4) recognised three general categories of totemism: individual, sex, and clan totemism2. He considered clan totemism to be the most important form and to be characterised by three features (I9IO, I: 4): i. A belief that members of a clan were descended from the totem. 2. A requirement of clan exogamy. 3. Taboos surrounding the totem, particularly against eating it when edible. These three features have remained part of most generalised definitions of totemism from Frazer, through Rivers (I9I4, 2: 75) to the i95i edition of Notes and Queries (I95I: I92). However, the system of totemism reported in I899 by Spencer and Gillen (e.g. I899: ii6) for the Aranda cut right across them. Though the Aranda believe they are descended from their totem, not only may they eat it on occasions, but they may also marry people with the same totem. In their report Spencer and Gillen made it clear that totems were attached to localities, not to persons or determined groups. According to them, the Aranda believed in a number of heroic ancestors who travelled about the countryside carrying sacred stones called churinga (Spencer &amp; Gillen I899: I23) As they state Either where [the heroes] originated and stayed ... or else where, during their wanderings, they camped for a time, there were formed what the natives call Oknanikilla, each one of</page><page sequence="3">I4 MAN, MARCH I972, VOL. 7, NO. I which is in reality a local totem centre. At each of these spots, . . . a certain number of Alcheringa ancestors went into the ground, each one carrying his Churinga with him. His body died, but some natural feature, such as a rock or tree, arose to mark the spot, while his spirit part remained in the Churinga.... The result is that ... the whole country is dotted over with Oknanikilla . . . at each of which are deposited a number of Churinga, with spirit individuals associated with them. Each Oknanikilla is ... connected with one totem.... it is this idea of spirit individuals associated with Churinga and resident in certain definite spots that lies at the root of the present totemic system ... We may take the following as a typical example of how each man and woman gains a totem name.3 Close to Alice Springs is a large and important witchetty grub totem centre or Oknanikilla ... A large number of prominent rocks and boulders and certain ancient gum- trees along the sides of a picturesque gap in the ranges, are the Nanja4 trees and rocks of these spirits, which, so long as they remain in spirit form, they usually frequent. If a woman con- ceives a child after having been near to this gap, it is one of these spirit individuals which has entered her body, and therefore, quite irrespective of what the mother's or father's totem may chance to be, that child, when born, must of necessity be of the witchetty grub totem. (I899: I23-4). Because there was no unilineal recruitment to conception totem groupings, Spencer and Gillen made a distinction between social groupings which were patrilineal-sections (classes) and moieties (phratries)-and totemic groupings based on the sharing of common conception totems. They did not realise that the Aranda have two totems. Besides their conception totem they also have a patrilineal clan totem, thus invalidating the distinction between social and totem groups. This fact and the relationship between the two kinds of totemism did not become clear until I947 when Strehlow published his book, Aranda traditions, and further clarified the situation in I965. According to Strehlow, the Aranda countryside was divided into patri-dan estates (njinanja section areas) each of which contained at least one important ceremonial centre known as pmara kutata, and a host of minor totemic centres belonging to a variety of different totems (I947: I40-I). Because the pmara kutata were widely avoided by women it was only infrequently that their children were thought to have been conceived from these spots. More generally they were conceived from one of the minor totemic spots in the area (Strehlow I965: I4I). All men of the patri-clan that owned the estate participated in the ceremonies and those men of other patri-clans who had the pmara kutata totem as their conception totem could also participate,, but they were unlikely to achieve leadership of rituals for that totem. The fact that one man's conception totem can be another man's patrilineal clan totem makes it clear that the two kinds of totemism are facets of the same ideology among the Aranda. Spencer and Gillen's report led Frazer to formulate his third hypothesis about the origin of totemism. In his view, the conception beliefs which formed a primitive theory of paternity were the source of totemism. Men derived their existence from points where the souls of the deceased were living, waiting to be reborn. He realised that this did not explain why there was an association between people and species of things. However, when Rivers reported the Banks Islanders' belief that people were an embodiment of something their mother had seen or eaten, he felt he had found the evolutionary predecessor and the ultimate origin of totemic beliefs. His pedigree for totemism thus went: i. People are embodiments of objects seen or eaten by mother (Banks Island). 2. Totem spirits, or souls become localised in particular spots (Aranda).</page><page sequence="4">MAN, MARCH I972, VOL. 7, NO. i Is 3. Totems become detached from place and attached to people in a hereditary de- velopment creating clan totemism (widely found) (I9I0,. I: i6i and I67). 4. Section and moiety totemism derive from the decay of clan totems (widely found) (I9I0, I: 76-8I). Durkheim criticised this hypothesis on two grounds. He pointed out correctly that Frazer's understanding that people derived their souls from plants and animals takes for granted what has to be explained. If people worship plants and animals because that is where their souls come from, the existence of these souls is the core of the problem. But Durkheim's real objection stemmed from much more general considerations. Frazer believed that magic precedes religion in the social evolution of mankind. In his view the Aranda were proof of this because they were obviously the most primitive people in existence and their totemic ceremonies were magical fertility rites. Previously Frazer had hypothesised that totemism was a system of division of magical labour to keep people supplied with the necessities of life.5 Durkheim first criticised this suggestion in 1902 on theoretical grounds.6 In contrast to Frazer, he argued that the Aranda were the most advanced Aborigines because he thought that magical beliefs resulted from the decay of religion. Thus the Aranda conception/local totemism was not prior to hereditary totemism but subsequent to it. By a free interpretation of the writings of Schulze (I891: 239) and Strehlow senior (I907), he persuaded himself that the Aranda had originally had hereditary matrilineal totemism (Durkheim I957: I83) which was in decay at the time Spencer and Gillen visited them. The decay was alleged to result from the inconvenience of matrilineal inheritance oftotems when the custom of marriage was patrilocal. During the change over, which was said to be deliberate,7 totems became attached to place. On the strength of this argument that the Aranda were socially advanced Aborigines, Durkheim (I957: I83) dismissed the whole superstructure of Frazer's system. With this dismissal of the conception-totemism hypothesis, Durk- heim and those who have drawn inspiration from him have lost sight- of the import- ance of the spatial referent of totems and of their relationship to conception beliefs. Conception beliefs and clan8 totemism It has been seen above that among the Aranda conception beliefs. and clan totemism are two facets of the same ideology. Both Frazer's and Durkheim's failure to recognise this was largely due to the inadequacies of the ethnography, but it was also due to the desire to make one-to-one correlations between totems and recognised social groups. It led Frazer to see the difference between conception and clan totemism as a total shift from totems being attached to place to being attached to groups of persons. This ignores the fact that throughout the continent the only corporate property of the clan is the estate and the sacred songs, rites and para- phernalia that constituted the title deeds to it. It led Durkheim greatly to exaggerate the corporate solidarity of the totemic clan without referring to its principal piece of corporate property. He focused attention exclusively on the totemic rituals and in particular on the designs used in them. He argued that the designs were more sacred than the totemic beings themselves and that they provided both foci for and reinforcement of the collective sentiments aroused by the clan gatherings at which they were used. In his opinion these sentiments were for the collective and anony-</page><page sequence="5">MAN, MARCH I972, VOL. 7, NO. i mous force of the clan itself which had become fixed in the designs as concrete emblems of the body of the clan god. In turning to the ethnography I shall focus attention on the clan designs in order to establish that they are not non-representational emblems of the clan god, as Durkheim believed, but have specific conventionalised representations of earthly phenomena. I shall take examples from two clans in disparate environments. The Murngin: In the absence of writing and of permanent man-made structures, the location of events in space and the marks that remind people of the events take on an additional importance. Place itself becomes the mnemonic of significant events and of personal and group history. Many daily activities leave marks on the landscape which remind people of things that have happened in the recent past. Foraging leaves fire scars, footprints, holes in trees, holes in the ground and broken artefacts; eating leaves piles of shell, broken bones, nut husks and ovens; camping leaves hearths, clearings, forked sticks, dead trees and pestles and mortars; ceremonies leave log coffins, dance grounds and trenches. Besides these marks left as a sideproduct of regular activity others are made deliberately as a reminder of particular events. A man may rub a mark into the side of a path at the point from which he saw the missionary's plane or snap a twig at the place from which he speared an emu or heard a ghost. More rarely men like to leave evidence of their presence in a partic- ular place: this they commonly do either by making a hand or foot stencil9 in a cave or by cutting a pole or nicking a tree at their head height. They call the stencils wongili or shadow and the poles malli djakar or straight-standing shadow. When the men who made them die, their relatives collect the wooden poles, sing over them and burn them. The people believe that other marks of a larger scale left on the landscape are the results of the activities of ancestral heroes. These ancestral heroes emerged from their subterranean world releasing the waters and the animating life-forces they contain. The heroes led lives similar in many respects to those of the people today, though on a grander scale, and the remains of their activities can be seen in many places. It is from the points where they emerged that the present-day people derive their existence and these points have become the foci of collective clan sentiments that lie at the core of the relationship of the people to the land. The Murngin are well aware of the need for copulation to produce conception; they say so and their ceremonies are saturated with symbolic equivalents of semen and phalli, as for example in the Gunabibi, Marndiella and final sequences of the mortuary ceremonies. However, despite regular sexual activity the women only conceive infrequentlylo even though no form of conception control appears to be used. It may be supposed therefore that part of the intellectual problem for the Murngin is similar to that of the Azande contemplating what we would think of as the vicissitudes of chance: they seek to impose some order on the pattern of conception. This they do primarily by relating it to place via an ideology of spirit forces required to animate the foetus. Usually when a woman realises she is pregnant she informs her husband and he thinks back over the previous weeks to recall some especially auspicious occasion, generally a particularly successful day's fishing. This indicates to the man the area in which the entry of the spirit took place, the spirit being assumed to have come from the nearest spirit source in the territory of a clan of the right patrilineal moiety. Such</page><page sequence="6">MAN, MARCH I972, VOL. 7, NO. I 17 spirits may be found at several points within an estate wherever there are springs or at points along the rivers on the estate, but there will only be one focal well from which the ancestral hero emerged. Theoretically a spirit child should come directly from a man's own clan estate but because young men when they are first married often have to live with their wife's parents their first children are as likely as not to be found on the clan estate of those other than the father's. Among the Murngin there are no conception totems as such: generally, however, a man takes one of his names from his father's clan song cycle that refers in some way to the area in which he was found. Hence for example a man from a coastal clan who conceived his son sixty miles inland called his son Milirr. This is a ritual name for the nuts of the talipot palm that grows in the area where the boy was conceived and which seagulls, important in the father's clan song cycle, fly from the coast to eat. Thus the two areas are linked in the choice of name. Conception away from the father's estate in no way weakens the child's links with and rights in the father's clan. It means, however, that in addition to rights in his own clan he acquires privi- leges in the clan on whose estate he was conceived. He cannot pass these on. Because many people are conceived on an estate other than their own, two kinds of question must be asked when trying to relate people to place. To establish where a person was conceived one can ask: 'from which water do you come?' To establish their clan estate one asks; 'where is your bone country?' This latter question is most significant. It indicates that no matter on what estate a person is conceived, the link with the father and with his (her) own estate has a physical expression in the bones of the body. Since the culturally stressed contribution of the father in procreation is the finding of the spirit, this indicates a strong link between bone and spirit. The link between a man, his bones, his animating spirit and his country, lies at the heart of men's sacred ritual. In the most important clan ceremony, the narra, one or more emblems are displayed that represent the creator ancestor in some aspect. These emblems are usually made with a wooden core (although sometimes paper bark is used), covered with decorations, which may be of paint, wax, feathers, fur string, fibre string or hair. The sacred emblems are collectively called rangga. This term is also applied by men in narra ceremonies to the long bones of the body. Thomson (1939: 290 and also Berndt 1952: 7 and 114) reports that the wooden core of the rangga is also referred to as bone. Thus the people make the connexion; man's contribution to reproduction is the animating spirit, this has a physical manifestation in the bones of the body which are identified with the rangga which is an embodiment of the ancestral hero. The rangga are therefore the penultimate source of life and the one through which men attempt to regulate it. The fact that the stated purpose of holding ceremonies at which rangga are made is to ensure that the spirits of prestigious dead men are safely and happily returned to the subterranean world where the ancestral heroes live, confirms that the rangga are seen as the controlling agents regulating the life cycle of clan members no matter where conceived, It is this belief that the spirit has its origin in the patri- clan well that makes old men want to live on their estate so that they die there. The death of an individual leaves the relatives with the ritual task of ensuring that the spirit finds its way back to the clan water hole. This may take anything from four to ten years. It is during these mortuary rites that the tie of the clan to its well becomes most explicit. In particular it shows in the sand sculptures and painted</page><page sequence="7">MAN, MARCH I972, VOL. 7, NO. i designs (kamunungu, literally white paint) which are abstract representations of the clan well. The designs are painted on the corpse, on the stringy bark container (dindidindi) in which the bones are placed after exhumation, on the hollow log coffin in which the bones are finally disposed, and sometimes on the skull of the deceased and on the bodies of close relatives. The sand sculptures appear each time men hold wundjur mortuary rites (for references to this rite see Hiatt I965: 53-5 and i969b: 20; Warner I958: 4I8-20; Berndt I965: I98-201 who discusses use for removal of 'discordant influences', a secondary usage). The wundjur mortuary rite is the most frequently performed public ceremony held by the clan in north-east Arnhem Land. It is held when a close relative or band member dies, and each time news is received of the death of a person with whom people have interacted. It consists of singing the clan song cycle and at the termination of singing, cleansing all present. The cleansing is carried out by the lighting of a fire in a small circular depression around which the singers are seated. Green leaves are then heated in the flames and brushed over all present, driving the spirit of the deceased away. This ceremony is repeated at the completion of various tasks in the sequences of mor- tuary rites. During exhumation and at final disposal the simple circular sculpture is replaced by a more elaborate representation of the clan well which resembles the actual well fairly directly. To illustrate how directly the totemic designs are related to specific localities I will describe the clan well belonging to the Rrarigurak Gurumba Gurumba clan and the designs and the sand sculpture associated with it. The estate of the Rrarigurak Gurumba Gurumba clan lies on the eastern side of the Arafura Swamp. The swamp is surrounded by a steep escarpment, covered in most places by rain forest that rises 200 feet above it to an extensive undulating plateau of open eucalyptus forest. Today the clan numbers eight adult males and has about thirty members all told. The ancestral hero of the clan is Kurka Akowar, which literally means penis Akowar, a dog person. How this name is understood by the people themselves I am not entirely sure but it is probably as male dog-man Akowar rather than penis dog-man. This anthropomorphic being emerged from the subterranean world through a large rock that lies across a stream near its source. The stream rises at the top of the escarpment in an area covered with rain forest and runs down a narrow valley into the swamp. Kurka Akowar burst through the rock with the aid of his large penis thus creating the stream. He travelled down to the swamp, frequently stopping to rest, eat and excrete on the way. Where he rested there are round pools in the stream bed, and where he excreted there are deposits of white clay used in ceremonies. When he reached the sea he returned and now lives deep inside the well. At the point where the rock lies across the stream, the banks are steep and close together: at least 20 feet high and 50 feet apart at the top. The rock has an impres- sively rectangular hole in the middle through which water flows in the wet season. During the dry season the water emerges from a spring a few hundred yards down- stream. The rock must be cavernous for a large colony of small bats live inside, flying in and out in great numbers. With tall trees growing on either side, the place is dark, dank, difficult to find and full of spiders. On the flat rock surface above the hole are a series of drawings including one of Kurka Akowar. A number of pro- hibitions sanction behaviour for a half-mile radius round the rock. Women may not visit the area and the male clansmen may not go there without the permission</page><page sequence="8">MAN, MARCH I972, VOL. 7, NO. i of their uterine relatives who are the custodians of the site. When the owners do go there they must make gifts to the custodians, the only people permitted water and food from the area. One branch of the stream is totally prohibited to the owners. Because the large trees in the area are embodiments of the ancestral dog's tail (the same word for tail can also be used for penis) they may not be felled or a heavy downpour will result. With this knowledge of the physical aspects of the clan-well, it can be seen that the clan designs shown below are closely linked to actual features. There are several variations in the design primarily due to different referents. I illustrate two. Figure i shows the well itself with Kurka Akowar in dog form. The frame represents the banks of the river and the cross-hatching water flowing down from it. This design was placed on a hollow log coffin. Figure 2 focuses on the running water and life- renewing aspects of the clan well. The horizontal ovals at top and bottom represent the banks again, the sun-like circles, bat droppings, and the crossed circles, spiders. The 'ears' at the top have two meanings: they refer to the rock above and below the hole and they also indicate fire burning deep inside the well. Fire symbolises women and their reproductive power. The cross hatching represents flowing water. This design was painted on the chest of a man who had just exhumed the bones of a deceased Rrarigurak boy.

It combines both representations of the well and the immediate area surrounding it. The major portion is taken up with the well in which the participants in the ritual stand and wash themselves. The 'ears' represent the rock above and below the hole as in the painting and the hole through the rock is also indicated by the two circles either side of the line below the 'ears'. Within the context of a culture that delights in oblique and subtle references (cf. Warner's comment I958: I8o fn.) these designs and the sculpture are notably direct and specific references to idiosyncratic features of the clan-well.

I 21 The ceremonies in which they are used are the publicly performed sequences of clan totemic ritual. In the secret narra sequences, the emblem associated with Kurka Akowar himself is made and displayed, in dances, to younger clan members. The young initiates have designs painted on their chests which represent some esoteric detail", of the clan-well or an important point at which Kurka Akowar stopped on his travels. The emblem itself, in this case representing Kurka Akowar's penis, is decorated mainly with designs representing flowing water. A clan's songs, designs and sacred objects are the most important movable property it owns and are jealously guarded. In the past, people of either sex who infringed the secrecy or ownership rights surrounding them, wittingly or unwittingly, were usually put to death. Stories about such deaths are common and Warner records a number of cases: i. Five men in the twenty years prior to his fieldwork were put to death for looking at a totemic emblem under improper circumstances (Warner 195 8: I 59). 2. Two women who stole up to a ceremonial sacred ground and witnessed part of the proceedings were put to death (1958: I60). 3. A boy who happened upon two old men making their totemic emblem was invited to see it properly and later killed (1958: i6o-i). 4. A young man who viewed a stone totemic emblem illicitly was put to death (i958: I60). Warner also mentions a number of other breaches that could sometimes lead to the death of an individual: i. A woman walking, near to a hiding place for totemic objects might be killed on occasions. 2. Accidental destruction of a hidden totemic object such as by firing the bush when seeking small game. 3. A young man making a totemic emblem without the consent of the clan's ceremonial leader. 4 Destruction of a hollow log coffm in the annual burning off could occasionally lead to death if the deed was felt to be deliberate. The Walbiri: The desert dwellers share the Arnlhem Landers' preoccupation with place and the symbolisation of links with it. Much the most striking example of this is the Dieri, toa. Toas were decorated wooden sticks, 6"-i8" in length, left behind in vacated camps to indicate where people had moved to. 'Their shape, colours, pattern or appendages depict realistically or ideographically either certain conspicuous or peculiar natural features of the localities represented. . .' or re- ferences to details of ancestral heroes' behaviour at that place (Stirling &amp; Waite I9I9: III). Their morphological similarity with the Arnhem Land rangga is sometimes striking (cf. Stirling &amp; Waite I919: plates xi-xx with Warner 1958: plate IlIb). Such direction signs are not reported for the Walbiri but schematic maps decorate spear throwers (e.g. see Thomson I962: 274 and plates) and sacred boards (Meggitt I966: I80). Walbiri traditions surrounding the source of lifeI2 are similar to those of the Murngin. The Walbiri speak of a life-force or essence, guruwari, left behind by</page><page sequence="11">22 MAN, MARCH I972, VOL. 7, NO. i ancestral heroes at various points on their travels, where they emerged from the subterranean world and where they re-entered it. The agents of conception are guruwalba, spirit children (apparently called jinuwuru (Munn I964: ioo) by the women). The guruwalba may enter the woman through her foot, navel or elsewhere. Meggitt records (I962: 274) that when a woman is sure she is pregnant she informs her husband and they recall the locality in which they were residing when her menses were first interrupted. They assume that guruwari from a totemic site in that area has entered the woman. This event determines the child's conception totem. Unlike the Murngin situation, a person may be conceived from a totemic site belonging to the patrimoiety opposite to their ownI3 so that the correlation between patrimoiety affliation of individuals and their conception totems is limited (Meggitt I962: 66). When they do coincide a man gains subsidiary rights in the clan ceremonies held for his conception totem, or rather for the ceremonies held for that place. As with the Aranda and the Murnginl4 one man's conception totem is likely to be another man's clan totem. I have already suggested that the primary problem associated with conception was to organise it which in Arnhem Land was achieved by associating it with place. The Walbiri ideology goes a step further in this direction by attempting to regulate it temporarily as well. Unlike the Murngin clan rituals, those of the Walbiri do not focus on death but on fertility. Coping with death is in the hands of the deceased's matriline relatives (Meggitt I962: 317-20) who perform all important tasks and organise the avenging expeditions. In the Walbiri ceremonies a group structurally identical to the Murngin clan meets annually to perform fer- tility ceremonies directed at trying to ensure that nature produces in the appro- priate season. These same ceremonies'5 also serve the function of age-grading within the clan, young men being inducted into various sequences of the cere- monies. The concern of the desert ceremonies with fertility would appear to correlate directly with the environmental differences between Arnhem Land and the desert. Pitjantjara birth totemism supports the suggestion that it is spatial ordering of critical events in the life cycle that is the concern of conception totemism. The Pitjantjara do not have conception totemnism but acquire a similar totemic link from the place where they are born. This variation would appear to relate to environ- mental conditions. The area in which they live is one of the most hostile environ- ments in Australia where bringing pregnancies to full term successfully was probably much more difficult than in more fertile areas. In fertile areas conception could probably be expected to result in live birth with some certainty but in the Western Desert drought or a poor year would increase the level of nutritional stress to produce miscarriages and still-births or to make it necessary to practise infanticide. Under these conditions live birth rather than conception would be the critical event. I will now illustrate the way designs used in Walbiri clan rituals are related to locality by describing one design.I6 The Emu clan of the Ngalia Walbiri has its sacred site at Ruguri about twenty miles west of Mount Eclipse. Ruguri is an isolated rock where three anthropomorphic emus are believed to have lived in the past and to have been visited by a party of travelling emus with a lame leader. Two of the three emus at Ruguri lived in the cave there incubating eggs and a third at a</page><page sequence="12">MAN, MARCH I972, VOL. 7, NO. I 23 soak nearby. In the ceremony the men of the clan re-enact the encounter around a ground drawing. Such drawings are called by the same term as the inseminating life-force, guruwari, because they are embodiments of the marks left by the ancestors and the source of the life-force (see Munn i964: 86-9I). The ceremony involves eight to twelve male clan members plus uterine and aflfmal relatives who act as stage managers. In I966 there were no Aborigines alive who had been conceived at Ruguri because the people had stopped living in the area nearly forty years ago but the totemic lodge was still flourishing. The ground drawing (see fig. 4) is made with charcoal and plant-down stained white with pipe-clay and stuck to the ground with blood. The performers interpret the draw- ing on two levels, both in terms of marks left on the ground. At the first level, therefore, the drawing shows the two emus sitting on the eggs: the sitting is in- dicated by the long 'heels' to the central pairs of feet. The black circles are the eggs and the concentric circles between the feet are the cloaca. The third concentric circle appears to have a dual meaning, indicating the third emu and also the intes- tines of the two sitting emus. The numerous emu footprints surrounding the central group are those of the travellers, the prints with a curled central toe being left by the lame emu. At the second level of interpretation the drawings represent the major marks left on the landscape by the ancestral heroes: the concentric circles now become the waterhole out of which the travelling emus originally emerged at Waiurrwai- urrba, and the cave at Yalliyulmu into which they finally disappeared.

Thus what might appear as a cult of a particular bird is in reality an endeavour to renew the supply of the life force by re-enacting a supposed historical encounter of a particular group of ancestral heroes at a particular spot. As with the Murngin, the Walbiri jealously guard the use of their clan designs, songs and emblems. Meggitt does not record any details of punishments meted out for sacrilege but Strehlow, who worked in the area during the I930's, states that the death penalty was common throughout Central Australia (I970: II9). The secrecy surrounding performances and the constant concern over who has the right to make or perform particular rites'7 are further evidence for the strength of the ownership rights associated with totemic rituals. These two illustrations indicate how totemic ideology and designs are concerned with spatial relationships. In particular it has been seen that the main function of conception beliefs is to relate conception to place. The apparent absence of con- ception totems among the Murngin is only a matter of emphasis. In the north, where clans are highly localised and the environment rich enough to remove daily concern with winning a living, the preoccupation is with death. Ritual life is directed to seeing that the spirits of deceased clansmen, no matter where con- ceived, find their way back to the subterranean world via the patri-clan well. The place of conception sets up secondary rights in the ceremonies of the clan that owns that area. In the desert on the other hand, where clan estates are four times the area of those in Arnhem Land and the problems of winning a living a frequent concern, the preoccupation is with fertility. Totemic ancestors in these areas travelled widely setting up links between distant places. When asked about where they were conceived, the Walbiri usually refer to the whole line of travel of the particular totem ancestor associated with their conception site, mainly because Aboriginal place names have no meaning to Europeans. To an Aboriginal listener a totem allied with the speaker's dialect and the minimum of information about him would make it unequivocally clear where his conception place was. As amongst the Murn- gin a Walbiri man only derives secondary rights from his place of conception. In both areas one man's conception totem/place can be another man's clan totem/ place. Thus the emphasis on the attachment of clan totems to groups of persons to the neglect of their attachment to locality is a fundamental oversight.'8 The designs refer to specific portions of the clan's corporately owned estate. As emblems they provide both external and internal reference as Fortes (I967: io) has pointed out. To outsiders they reiterate established relationships and form part of a system of classi- fication. To patri-clan members they act as a tangible focus for individual senti- ments of belonging and ownership. Numerous authors have commented on the strong emotional attachment of Aborigines to their estates (Berndt I964: 264-6; Berndt &amp; Berndt. 1970: xiv and 2I3; Elkin I964: 8o; Hiatt i965: I4 and I968: IOI; McConnel I930: i8i; Roheim 1932: 99-100; Stanner i965a: 23I; Strehlow I947: 30-I and I965: I26-7). Among old men in Arnhem Land the tie is particularly strong and they wish to die on their estates. They often refer to them using the affectionate term marrkup: Eeeee wanga marrkup-' Oh dear old country'. Strehlow's (I947: 30-I) observation that love of home and longing for home are dominant motives in Aranda mythology is true for many areas. Qualitative insight into attachment is</page><page sequence="14">MAN, MARCH I972, VOL. 7, NO. I 25 provided in the translation of almost any song cycle (see especially Berndt I952 for Arnhem Land and Strehlow I97I for the Centre) although the involuted symbol- ism is too esoteric to carry the full depth of meaning to people unfamiliar with the particular places mentioned. Today, when ceremonies are frequently per- formed many hundreds of miles from the area with which they are associated, men often cry as the main totemic objects are displayed.'9 When asked why, they say they are thinking of their country and of known patrilineal ascendants now de- ceased. The distinction between the two becomes less and less clear with the dimming of collective memory. Sacred boards and emblems which were originally made for a specific man become a symbol of him after his death until such time as he no longer remains known and the board is directly associated with the mytho- logical ancestors who made the landscape and gave life to the people. In this, perhaps, lies part of the strength of the attachment to the estate. Although, as Durkheim believed, there are strong sentiments associated with totemic designs and emblems, they are, contrary to his opinion, directly related to what they re- present. What they represent, however, is not the clan god but locality. The fore- most sentimental attachment is to place. Given this, and that the totemic clan is the land-owning unit, the question arises as to how it influences the pattern of resi- dence and how it relates to local organisation generally. Local organisation and the totemic patriclan There are three central issues in the current controversy (see Hiatt I962; I966; Stanner I96sb; Birdsell I970; Peterson I97oa) on Australian Aboriginal local organisation: i. The composition of the residential or land-using group, here called the band. 2. The usual size of the band. 3. The relationship between a band and the area from which it wins its living ('range' in Stanner's terminology, i965b: 2) In I93 I Radcliffe-Brown asserted the now generally accepted fact that throughout the continent the land-owning group was a small patrilineal clan with more or less well defined boundaries to its estate. Between them these estates divide up the whole continent. He described the composition of the band (he called it horde) on this estate as comprising the males of the patrilineal clan, their wives when married and their unmarried female children. This composition, he suggested, was the product of ecological factors which placed a premium on men's local knowledge (Radcliffe- Brown I93I: 439), assuming like Steward later, that the principal food resource of the Aborigines was game, or at least flesh provided by the men. In i962, however Hiatt pointed out that no fieldworker had actually seen a patriineal band in the bush and that such bands probably never existed. Lee and DeVore (I968: 8) suggest this is not surprising because fluid group composition is more ecologically adaptive than a rigidly patrilineal one. They point out that the mixed group, reflecting flexibility, has the adaptive advantage of adjusting group size to demo- graphic variance, and the resolution of conflict by fission. Several authors (Meggitt I964, Gould I969, B. Hiatt I970) have pointed out that the bulk of the food in Aboriginal society was provided by women thus removing the alleged ecological basis of the patrilocal band.</page><page sequence="15">26 MAN, MARCH 1972, VOL. 7, NO. i Despite this, Birdsell (I970) in particular has continued to maintain that under pre-contact conditions the band was composed of patrilineally related males living on their own clan estates. This appears to stem from his concern with the con- tinental aspects of Aboriginal ecology and the ease with which the patrilocal band accounts for the distribution and regulation of Aboriginal numbers in relation to resources. This is not the place to meet all the arguments put forward in his recent paper for the existence of the patrilineal band. The main argument against its existence in precontact times is the role of the women in the food quest which he did not consider. Access to the labour of young active females was essential for the viability of households. As men grew old and their wives aged they often sought to keep control over their younger daughters' labour even after marriage, making it necessary for young men to reside with their wife's parents. This co-residence with its consequent effect on the clan composition of males in a band lasted either until the wife's father died or until he was able to replace his daughter's labour with a new young wife (see Peterson I97oa). While this dissolves Birdsell's argument for the existence of the patrilocal band, neither Hiatt nor Lee and DeVore offer any explanation of the well-developed patrilineal ideology of land ownership. The second issue concerns the usual size of bands. It is only tangential to the discussion in this article but needs to be discussed in order to establish that this part of the controversy does not challenge the emphasis made below on the direct relationship between the residential group and the land-owning unit. Meggitt (I962: 70-I) and Hiatt (i965: 24) have said that, in the areas where they worked, the residential unit was a community substantially larger than the widely reported band size of twenty-five to fifty (Birdsell I970: I30; Stanner I970: I36; and see also Lee &amp; DeVore I968: ii). In neither area is the community the land-owning unit. Hiatt (i965: 25), reported that among the Gidjingali of Arnhem Land the residential unit was a community of about i35 regular members and Meggitt (I962: 32, si) that among the Walbiri the community numbering about 250 was the residential unit. Birdsell has taken these statements as extending to Aborigines generally, but not in quite the sense the authors intended. He has overlooked a distinction that they are keen to make between the people's own notion of a com- munity who may and do live together and the shifting associations (bands) of varying size and composition throughout the year. Since a number of people have recorded seeing large groups of Aborigines both in Arnhem Land and the desert (see Thomson I949: 24; Lindsay I884: I3; Strehlow I947: 65; Meggitt I962: s5)' the question resolves itself into whether the community was the usual residence group breaking down from time to time into smaller groups or whether the smaller groups were normal, coming together to form a large group from time to time. This can be argued at length. Here I would only say that the Gidjingali live in a highly productive estuarine area backed by equally productive swamp, an uncom- mon situation taking Australia as a whole. Further, that a patrol through the region (Sweeney I939), eighteen years before a settlement was built nearby, saw six bands of average size 34 (range 29-4I) and three others with 77, 8o and 83 members respectively. These latter bands were each holding ceremonies while the former were not. Given the infrequency with which such large gatherings have been reported and the absence of any observational data on the duration of large gather- ings either in Arnhem Land or in the desert it would seem most likely that the</page><page sequence="16">MAN, MARCH 1972, VOL. 7, NO. I 27 communities spoken of by Hiatt and Meggitt reflect generalised Aboriginal notions of people who live together rather than actual residential groups living together in a single camp. The third issue relates to the first but has not been explored in detail. Stanner (I965b) has provided conceptual clarification of the spatial aspects by distinguishing the estate, the area owned by a clan, from range, the area used by a band, but no detailed discussion has appeared of the relationship between band and clan or estate and range. In order to understand the relationship between a band and the area on which it lives it is necessary to discuss briefly why Aborigines live in bands. Whatever the original reasons causing people to live in bands, one of the principal factors maintaining bands in the ethnographic present was the willingness to support the old non-food-collectors as well as the young. The percentage of non- collectors in Arnhem Land bands which I have studied has been an average of 4I v3 8. This high figure is remarkably close to that reported by Lee for the Bushmen among whom 38-78 per cent of the people in fourteen bands were non-collectors (I969: 53). While the majority of these dependants are children some are old people who are often suffering from blindness or made relatively immobile through frailty. Even under the harsh desert conditions bands support the aged and incapacitated adults. In one case a group of Pintubi are known to have carried a lame adult man, who eventually lost his leg, for two years before he was able to get around on a crutch (see Thomson I962 for reference to this man). The support of such people makes it necessary for the subsistence strategy to be based on camps in or near which the old and immobile stay by day and to which the food gatherers return in the afternoon. The burden of supporting these people can be distributed more evenly if households camp together in groups, thus creating bands. This is not to say that individual households never camp alone, or that households do not come and go from bands, but that within any area a household is nearly always linked with the nearest band. Accepting this, the question arises as to what determines the general location in which a band wins its living. It is at this point that the attachment of men to their estate becomes crucial. In Arnhem Land there is a definite desire on the part of old men to die on their clan estate (see above; Elkin I964: 80). They are also keen to live there in order to participate in the clan rituals, which they are likely to control, and because on their own estate they will be away from the daily contact with and consequent obligations to senior affmal males that are usually unavoidable when they first marry. In the desert there does not seem to be such a strong preference for dying on the clan estate but men do seek to participate in their clan's totemic ceremonies annually and for this reason the older men will be attracted to live in the region of their clan site to reduce undue travelling. Thus bands are not formed randomly in space. Old men, motivated to live in particular places, become nodal points about which bands form. As long as at least one old man in each clan lives on his own estate the totemic ideology will be affecting the spatial distribution of population. Men from several clans may be living together for a variety of reasons. When one of them leaves to take up residence with another band he will be moving to live with people whose place of residence will likewise be determined by the emotional bond of some other old man to his estate. In this way there is established a relationship between a band and</page><page sequence="17">28 MAN, MARCH 1972, VOL. 7, NO. i the area it lives on that derives from and receives expression in the totemic ideology and rituals. Spacing and clan totemism Territorial behaviour is one class of spacing behaviour. Another closely related class is dominance behaviour. Spacing relates to the distribution and abundance of resources and spacing mechanisms regulate access to these resources thus influencing the distribution and abundance of the population. Territorial behaviour is one of the most important of such spacing mechanisms. The importance of territorial be- haviour among animals has only come to be recognised very recently. Although Howard wrote his book on the Territory in bird life in I920, Steward (I936: 332) in his discussion of the economic and social basis of primitive bands, was asking why humans were the only animals that had land-owning groups, and as late as i958, Carpenter in a review of the literature on non-human territoriality was able to say that the information on it was limited, unsystematic and the studies largely in the pre-experimental state (I958: 224). It is not surprising therefore that even less attention has been paid to the biological aspects of human territoriality. Although Carpenter set aside the discussion of human territoriality in his review, it is clear that he, like Ardrey (I967) and Wynne-Edwards (I962), sees it as biologically fundamental. Others, however, see it as acquired behaviour. Morris (I967: 30) attributes man's territoriality to the carnivorous revolution a million or more years ago. On the other hand, Reynolds (I966) and Barnes (I970) have argued that territoriality has only become a pronounced feature of human life during the last io,ooo years as a by-product of agriculture and fixed wealth. This latter view is based on a rather narrow definition of territorial behaviour which sees it only in terms of the defence of an area of space by an animal, or group of animals, rather than more generally as a part of spacing behaviour. It is also the result of argument by analogy: non-human species have physically defended ter- ritories, therefore humans must defend their territories in the same way if they are to be called territorial. If, however, territoriality is defined as an areal-based spacing mechanism that maintains population dispersion then what has to be sought in Aboriginal society is an isomorphic mechanism and not necessarily the same behaviour, before one can say that Aborigines are non-territorial. I would suggest that clan totemism is the main territorial spacing mechanism in Aboriginal society. By contrast with animal territoriality, however, Aboriginal territoriality is inward- looking, sustained by beliefs and affective bonds to focal points of the landscape and the cultural symbols associated with these points. Physical defence of territory is not reported in the traditional system20 and for good reason. Aborigines cannot accumulate surplus wealth derived from the land. The only wealth that can be accumulated is ritual knowledge and wives, the means of production. Because the economy is subsistence based without any substantial form of food storage, there is no direct competition in food collection. With the population clumped in widely dispersed bands, the possibility of conflict is further reduced. There is, however, aggressive and defensive behaviour in Aboriginal society, but it is associated with inter-personal and inter-group dominance in which the focus of competition is primarily the control and defence of the cultural symbols of the</page><page sequence="18">MAN, MARCH 1972, VOL. 7, NO. I 29 land. People are identified with place and this receives expression in ownership of clan designs, song cycles, and emblems. Men defend these: men and women are killed for violating the restrictions and rights surrounding them (see above). In a different way conflicts between men over women usually have a territorial com- ponent arising from a conflict of rights derived from shared territory i.e. socio- centric clan ties, versus rights derived from shared flesh, i.e. ego-centric kinship ties (e.g. see Peterson I969 and I97ob). The topographical conventions of totemism must have evolved well after the people arrived in Australia. It is unlikely that the day the first colonisers set foot, they staked out estates and labelled focal points as the source of unborn children and the future homes of the dead. Given the long period of time that Australia has been occupied2I it is likely that the population has been adaptively distributed for much of it. As long as food resources and the ex- tractive technology remained unchanging and the people sought to exploit their environment efficiently, internal movements or even external invasion would have had little effect. Like marbles on a solitaire board the intrusive population would have quickly become dispersed into the previous spatial distribution of ecosystems. As a result of this, and because it is highly adaptive, local populations in their ecosystems could well develop areal sentiments and associated cultural symbols. Australian clan totemism would appear to be, then, a highly adaptive spatial classification of the population with the power to draw on and reinforce a funda- mental aspect of human psychology, namely the tendency to form long-lasting sentimental attachments. In this article I have emphasised clan/conception totemism to the neglect of section (i.e. sub-section, semimoiety and moiety) totemism. I have done so because I believe that the attachment of totems to locality is fundamental to Australian totemism. Section totemism, which has been the focus of Levi-Strauss's analysis (I966), is the distillation of the system of classification and grammar of symbolism with the consequent detachment of totems from place. Its essential features are the classification of groups of patri-clans and patri-lines in ritual situations and groups of matri-clans and matri-lines in secular contexts.22 The view of the role of sentiment in totemism put forward here though different from that suggested by Durkheim is not incompatible with it. While he placed the emphasis entirely on sentiments derived from the collectivity of the clan, the sentiments that are focal to the argument of this article are largely individually oriented. I have not defined the nature of sentiment but I have in mind the same complex as Nadel does (ig5i) when he speaks of'mental energy', of Pareto (I935) when he speaks of 'residues' and of Freud, Durkheim and Radcliffe-Brown respectively when they invoke 'sentiment'. Waddington (I960) has argued that because man has become so dependent on social communication for transmitting adaptive behaviour from one generation to the next there must be some inherent mechanisms ensuring that the information received is accepted. He suggests that it is an empirically observable fact that the newly-born have a tendency to believe and the ability to internalise authority. Some aspects ofthis internalisation of author- ity have the character of ethical beliefs, essentially beliefs about the nature of the most authoritative demands, and that this is the key to the system of transmission.</page><page sequence="19">30 MAN, MARCH 1972, VOL. 7, NO. i Man, in his view, is an animal which goes in for having beliefs. In this light I would suggest that sentiment is the valency aspect of belief and that totems are generally the manipulable foci of sentiments.

Hiatt for his comments and Miss Winifred Mumford for the drawings.

Frazer outlined this hypothesis in a letter to Spencer dated i 5 September I898 (Marett &amp; Penniman I932:24-9) and Spencer replied in a letter dated 20 October I898, speaking of the theory as Frazer's (I932:30; see also 3I). 6 Leach (I966: 569) says Frazer had abandoned this hypothesis before there had been any public discussion of it. This is incorrect. See Durkheim (I902) in which a large section of the paper is devoted to contradicting Frazer's hypothesis. Durkheim's criticisms seem to have been the reason for Frazer abandoning this hypothesis in favour of the conception hypothesis (see Frazer I9I0, I: I6o fn.i and I67; I9I0, 4:57). 7 Durkheim suggested that there was deliberate change from mother- to father-right by one section in each moiety being moved to the other. This is not as unlikely as it sounds since a similar process in ceremonial situations is going on in western Arnhem Land (see Berndt &amp; Berndt I965: 60-2). 8 A number of terms have been used in the literature for the patrilineal land-owning group e.g. Warner calls them clans (I958: I6); Hiatt writing about the Gidjingali of Arnhem Land speaks of patrilineal groups (I965: I9); Meggitt writing about the Walbiri calls them patrilines (I962). I shall use the term clan here to refer to the smallest landowning group which has its own sacred site that is a focus of totemic rituals. Warner's clans sometimes include two of the units I call clans because he did not give enough emphasis to the top/bottom distinction made by the people. The groups I call clan among the Murngin are structurally identical with Walbiri patrilines. 9 See Basedow (193$: 237) who records similar motivation for hand stencilling. IO Lancaster-Jones records the total fertility ratio of 4-25 children per woman in the Northern Territory between I958-I960 (I963: 75). II No narra ceremony held by this clan has been seen by me. I2See Meggitt (I962) and Munn (I964) for detailed discussion. I3 This probably relates directly to environmental factors. Roughly speaking Walbiri estates are four times the size of those in Arnhem Land so insisting that children can only be conceived from an estate of their own moiety would negate the localising aspect of conception beliefs in such conditions. I4 The Murngin clearly have conception totemism in a structural sense, see below. '5 Meggitt has pointed out that the term 'increase ceremony' is really a misnomer. These ceremonies are concerned to maintain the supplies of natural species at their normal level (I962: 22I). 16 A film has been made of this clan's totemic ritual. See 'Emu ritual at Ruguri', director R. Sandall, anthropologist N. Peterson, field liaison T. D. Campbell and M. Barrett, producer the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. I7 See the discussion in the above film prior to the decorating of the performers. 18 Stanner (I965a: 227-230) has emphasised the sign character of totems and their relationship to place but not developed the latter aspect. He makes a particularly significant remark however in view of the hypothesis of this article; 'My own experience includes one instance only of a man's abandoning ("killing ") his totem: he had declared publicly his intention never to go back to his clan-country' (i965a: 230).</page><page sequence="20">MAN, MARCH I972, VOL. 7, NO. i 3I 19 See the following films produced by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies and directed by R.
