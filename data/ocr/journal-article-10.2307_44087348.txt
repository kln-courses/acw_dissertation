<plain_text><page sequence="1">JIM TARTER Collective Subjectivity and Postmodern Ecology Since the 1960s, "new collective subjectivities have been affirmed in the drama of social transformation. . . . These new modes of consciousness have literally dislocated the old scenarios of class struggle by invading the imaginary and cognitive roots of produc- tive activity . . . desire has thus spread to the realm of collective practices, which now constitute the new political territories" (Guat- tari and Negri 38). For Felix Guattari and Toni Negri, the great success of the politics of the 1960s was the emergence of new forms of collective subjec- tivity. The politics of subjectivity they see in the late 1960s revolves around a reading of the so-called new social movements as col- lective subjectivities in the process of articulating themselves. For Guattari and Negri this change represents a shift from "politics as ideology" to "politics as subjectivity," and it took place during and after the end of the new Left (in the late 1960s and early 1970s). Thus, rather than subscribing to the popular belief that there was a distinct end to the new Left and that this end was a disaster, Guattari and Negri see that the "end" of the new Left actually pro- duced new politics of collective subjectivities. They employ here a positive model of postmodern collective subjectivity, and this theo- retical move takes them beyond the well-known poststructuralist "death" of the individual subject. Guattari and Negri's notion of collective subjectivity is essen- tially political rather than ecological. Nevertheless, such a politi-</page><page sequence="2">66 ISLE cal notion of collective subjectivity can become very important, I would argue, if we fuse or transcode the notion with postmodern ecology. With their theoretical notion of the rhizome in A Thousand Plateaus , Deleuze and Guattari verge on an ecological notion of col- lective subjectivity. That notion is comparable to the one Guattari and Negri use in the opening passage of this essay; one of their major definitions of the rhizome is a "collectivity of enunciation," a definition that is much like the ecological model of collective subjectivity found in contemporary writers whom I would gather under the rubric of "postmodern ecologists." This hybrid political/ecological notion of subjectivity is impor- tant in the face of most critical discussions of postmodernism in the 1980s and early 1990s. These have been dominated by the totaliz- ing theses of writers such as Jean Baudrillard and Fredric Jameson. Baudrillard and Jameson have argued that the system of hyper- reality and simulacra, or the logic of late capitalism, respectively, have taken over completely. In other words, they argue that our social power systems have actually enacted the theoretical, post- structuralist "death of the subject" and that, therefore, any politics of subjectivity (such as Guattari and Negri describe, for example) is out of the question. In effect, Baudrillard and Jameson are each in their own way attempting to dismiss the cultural politics of the new social movements that have emerged since the end of the 1960s, from feminism and the many strains of multiculturalism to urban environmental justice and the gay and lesbian movements. Baudril- lard argues this point explicitly with his assault on the new Left's logic of symbolic action and his dismissal of the "entire left-right political spectrum"; Jameson makes the point through his repeated attacks on "micropolitics." Against such totalizing uses of the term "postmodernism," I want to distinguish in this essay a newly emerging ecological form of postmodernism. Postmodern ecology offers alternative models of subjectivity and historical agency that do not fall back on the indi- vidual humanist subject. These new models of subjectivity depend on an ecological notion of collective subjectivity. Postmodern eco- logical writers confront, work through, and overcome the tendency of totalizing postmodern theorists such as Baudrillard and Jameson to dismiss cultural politics, not by reasserting the agency of the individual subject, but by reconceiving subjectivity as diffuse, par- tial, and collective.</page><page sequence="3">Collective Subjectivity and Postmodern Ecology 67 Guattari and Negri's notion of collective subjectivity gestures toward a convergence with some postmodern feminist writers, such as Donna Haraway and Carol Emshwiller, and some self-styled postmodern scientists, all of whom suggest as well that we should understand postmodern subjectivity to be collective (they also sug- gest, however, that it is not only technological in constitution, but also fundamentally constituted within ecosystems). Subjectivities in these models are both technological and ecological, both cultural and (what used to be called) natural, all at once. These writers are saying that, rather than theorize the death of the subject, we should broaden our notions of subjectivity. By calling for a broadening of our notions of subjectivity, I would add, these writers also imply that we must broaden and extend our notions of who and what belongs to and participates in our communities, the communities that constitute us as humans. From the perspective of postmodern ecology, our communities include many things that have not usually been conceived as subjective, such as animals and plants; but they may also include such "subhuman" things as cells or the immune system (Haraway), or macrosystems such as water- sheds or bioregions. Once we extend our notions of subjectivity, we immediately expand our sense of who and what participates in our communities. In his introduction to The Post-Modern Reader , Charles Jencks . offers a notion of postmodernism that takes the postmodern to be not only a condition, but, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, an ad- jective to apply to various newly emergent movements against the postmodern condition. Based on postmodern ecology's extended and collective notion of subjectivity, I will speculate in my conclu- sion that postmodern ecology as a discourse is to be allied with some of Jencks's postmodern cultural movements against the post- modern "condition," such as feminism and the many cultural move- ments often referred to as "multiculturalism." I will suggest that this description is applicable to postmodern ecology as well, but I will go further- postmodern ecology may not only refer to a form of discourse and to some groups, it may also actually serve as a principle of alliance between different people and groups. This is the real importance of postmodern ecology- not merely to reconceive subjectivity in the abstract, but to help us imagine principles of association or alliance between all the proliferating groups and subcultures in the present, relatively fragmented cul-</page><page sequence="4">68 ISLE turai situation of "micropolitics" and multiculturality. A postmod- ern ecology of collective subjectivities may provide some part of the basis for these principles. At the present time, very often it seems an emphasis on diversity tends to exacerbate differences and condone a superficial cultural separatism. We need to rethink prin- ciples of common ground between communities. Postmodern Ecology The notions of collective subjectivity in Guattari, Negri, and De- leuze take steps in the direction of postmodern ecology. Other writers go further, however, and use an ecological model to expand our notion of subjectivity in both directions, as it were, toward the cultural politics of technology /discourse and toward an ecological perspective on what we used to refer to as nature. The recent writ- ing of Donna Haraway is exemplary in this regard. In terms of its themes, her broad, interdisciplinary work spans the spectrum from the cyborg to "primate visions" and a vision of the immune system as a complex, sign-reading, and decision-making subjectivity. This breadth is suggested by the title of her book, Simians , Cyborgs and Women; the subtitle- The Reinvention of Nature- also suggests a con- cise formula for her project. In this book and in her earlier history of primate studies, Primate Visions , Haraway portrays a massive pro- liferation at many levels of new mutant (in the Darwinian sense) subjectivities. She sets these subjectivities within a technological- discursive, constructivist notion of a reinvented nature. I will re- turn to Haraway, but for now I am simply trying to suggest that her basic themes, with her emphasis on a nonanthropocentric, con- structivist approach to subjectivity, are to be associated with post- modern ecology. Novelist Carol Emshwiller writes her fiction along conceptual lines similar to Haraway's. For example, in Carmen Dog (1990), Emshwiller envisions an entire social movement of mutating females of all species and sexualities, some of whom are moving "up" the evolutionary scale and some of whom are going "down" -some female animals (of various species) are becoming more human, and some women are becoming more animal (of various species). But as our protagonist Pooch, a pet dog who is becoming</page><page sequence="5">Collective Subjectivity and Postmodern Ecology 69 more human, says, we should "never say up." That is, moving "up" and "down" the evolutionary scale is a matter of perspective; the novel is structured to disrupt these traditional hierarchies between species. Emshwiller uses the concept of "transmutation" in the bio- logical sense, in which one species changes into another species or, as in this case, into a new blur of species. Through its por- trayal of a multicultural, multisexual, and multispecies movement of females, situated right in a recognizable Manhattan, Emshwiller 's novel links feminism and a critique of science like Haraway's to a nonanthropocentric ecology. This movement is a new collective subjectivity that is also composed of new forms of subjectivity, new kinds of people who are constructing their subjectivity by articu- lating it publicly. Haraway and Emshwiller help clarify why we should call this form of ecology "postmodern." First, ecology became postmodern when it was popularized in the late 1960s and early 1970s as one of the new social movements. That is, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, "ecology" fundamentally changed from a somewhat esoteric, scientific technical term to the basis for entire movements. It should be added that popularization also means the beginning of the corn- modification of ecology and the onset of green corporate capitalism. Nevertheless, I take some ecological movements to be examples of Jencks's postmodern movements against the postmodern "condi- tion." Now, like Guattari and Negri I am taking these postmodern deri- vations of the new social movements as collective subjects, and what I want to do here is fuse or transcode this political, multi- cultural notion of collective subjects with the collective subjects of what some writers are calling "postmodern science." This is the sec- ond reason, then, why I call these discourses "postmodern ecology": some feminists and scientists have been using the term "postmod- ern" to name a new form of science that is ecological in its fun- damental principles and assumptions. Although I cannot pretend fully to understand as a scientist the differences between estab- lished science and postmodern science, the latter 's basic ecological approach to subjectivity has tremendous importance for scholars of the humanities. From the perspective of the humanities, postmod- ern science offers an alternative: instead of the death of the subject, there is a tremendously expanded and diffuse set of positive alter-</page><page sequence="6">70 ISLE native models of diverse collective subjects and postmodern eco- logical communities. Before I turn directly to postmodern science, however, let me clarify some terms. Postmodern Ecology Versus the Ecological Rights Argument "Ecology" as a term was invented in 1866, and it has been used by scientists and intellectuals since the 1890s. Since the late nineteenth century, the study of ecology has involved relations, communities, and whole systems. But some new forms of ecology are emerg- ing. Here I will stress the essential differences between some recent postmodern uses of "ecology" and earlier uses. One way to en- capsulate the differences is to say the shift to a postmodern ecology is a shift from the argument that people have a right to healthy eco- systems to the argument that ecosystems themselves and the sub- jects (all the living things) within them have intrinsic value and a right to exist and flourish. This is an argument first put forward by Aldo Leopold in A Sand County Almanac (1949). Along these lines, Roderick Nash has written an important intel- lectual history of American environmentalism that traces the his- tory of the arguments for ethical extension. Nash argues that in this country we have periodically broadened our political theory of who is a subject, and thus of who has moral and legal rights under the Constitution, from white males to African American men, then to women and Native Americans, and so on. Now what we ought to do, his argument goes, is learn from ecological writers and ex- tend even further our notions of who or what is a subject- and who or what is in our communities- to include other living things; we might even broaden our notion of what is alive to include things like ecosystems, that is, watersheds, bioregions, even the planet. Such arguments are fairly well known, but they haven taken dif- fering forms. Nash's history, as opposed to ecofeminism or deep ecology, focuses on the ecological rights line of argumentation, the line that argues that once we have accorded subjectivity to ecosys- tems we will have a philosophical basis for extending ethical rights and, eventually, legal and constitutional rights to nonhumans- ani- mals, plants, and nonhuman communities. Nash's book is more a history than an argument; however, he</page><page sequence="7">Collective Subjectivity and Postmodern Ecology 71 does ultimately put an argumentative spin on the history he con- siders. In the conclusion, he argues that we need to continue our tradition of extending the constitutional definition of a subject and extend the notion of who has rights to a new group, nonhuman life forms. Thus for Nash, the rights argument should be, politically, an extension and new application of eighteenth-century natural rights and the old American ideal of liberty. Basically, he wants us to think of animals and environments as if they were eighteenth-century subjects. There is an understandable, pragmatic political rationale for taking this line, since it entails something concrete and attain- able (the new constitutional amendment). Nash and the ethical extensionists, however, are unable or unwill- ing to deal with the fact that many of these previous extensions of rights by amendment remained merely theoretical and legal. Very often they were not even partially realized until, for example, the suffragettes and civil rights movements put them in the limelight. People have had to claim and work for rights that they already had theoretically and legally, and the ethical extension argument doesn't address this difficulty. As a result, Nash and the extensionists don't make the connection between practices of human communities and the nonhuman communities in question. I would not want to imply that thinking of animals or environments as eighteenth-century subjects is completely worthless, although we do need to go fur- ther; mainly, I am drawing a distinction between legal and practi- cal rights. Even if we were to pass an amendment recognizing the rights of animals, plants, and ecosystems, or even entire bioregions, there would be no guarantee that people would actually change their everyday behavior. I am saying that, instead of envisioning nonhumans as legal human subjects, we need to change completely our culture's basic notion of what subjects are and include in our notion both humans and nonhumans. Then we will change our be- havior and truly overcome the deep-seated dualism that says only humans are subjects and the rest of the world and all of its life- forms are mere objects. We need to go beyond merely deconstruct- ing dualism and reconstruct the connections between the human and nonhuman cultures and communities. People in the humanities frequently object to ecological argu- ments by saying that, by talking about cells, animals, or ecosystems as subjectivities and communities, we are anthropomorphizing (see, for example, Kennedy, who, on behalf of the scientific establish-</page><page sequence="8">72 ISLE ment, attacks the kind of writers under discussion). However, the point here is that Nash's argument is the one that is anthropomor- phizing; Nash helps precisely to distinguish a postmodern ecology from his line of argument. He wants us to project onto animals and ecosystems the qualities of eighteenth-century subjects; this is rec- ognizably anthropomorphism. He definitely is aware of what he is doing and carefully chooses to take the liberal line for pragmatic political reasons (it would have a much broader popular appeal to mainstream liberals because all we need from his perspective is an extension of rights already guaranteed by the Constitution, not a reconception of the Constitution's definition of the subject). He shows he knows what he is doing by covering thoroughly writers who take a different line on these arguments, one that in some forms resembles postmodern ecology. Insofar as he continues to employ a traditional, constitutional definition of subjectivity, we could call Nash's liberal approach modernist; this is the point of my distinc- tion of postmodern ecology from Nash's spin on the history of en- vironmentalism. The difference is that postmodern ecology tries to reconstruct a different notion of subjectivity from the ground up. Thus, the accusation of anthropomorphism begs the question raised by the entire line of argumentation used by postmodern ecologists. It ignores the detail of the actual notion of subjectivity being de- scribed and suggests that postmodern ecologists are simply project- ing an older notion of the human. As I will show, this is clearly not the case. The accusation is itself anthropocentric, since it presumes that only humans can have subjective qualities- which is exactly what is in question. Nash and other ethical extensionists deserve credit for broaden- ing our notion of who and what ought to be considered subjects and thus of who and what should be considered a part of our communi- ties. Indeed, I would endorse this notion, as far as it goes, because if we do change our basic ethics with respect to other living things, it might change our everyday behavior for the better. The problem is, insofar as he calls for concrete changes, he wants us to change our constitutional and legal structures to include animals and nature under our established notion of human subjectivity -to grant them the same basic rights. Nash wants us to see the subjectivities in question (animals, plants, ecosystems) as if they were human indi- viduals as defined by the Constitution. Postmodern science and ecology reverse this formula. They ask us not to see nonhumans as</page><page sequence="9">Collective Subjectivity and Postmodern Ecology 73 constitutional humans, but to recognize in them varieties and de- grees of subjectivity. Some postmodern scientists and ecologists attempt to connect human and nonhuman subjectivities and communities. These post- modern writers are trying to reconstruct completely what is meant by subjectivities and communities. Postmodern Science and Postmodern Ecology The ethical extensionists present us with the moral imperative that we ought to broaden our notion of subjectivity. This idea is impor- tant and could have profound implications if widely accepted in mainstream U.S. culture. However, some scientists now speak of a "postmodern science," which in effect gives us the stronger argu- ment that we ought to extend our established notion of subjectivity to animals, plants, and ecosystems because in fact all these and more already are subjectivities in a new sense of the term. The notion of a postmodern science is important to us not because it performs the older legitimating function science performed for humanists who appealed to it. Rather, it is important because the ideas of postmod- ern science, as seen in writers such as Griffin, Birch, and Haraway, are directly relevant to our attempts in the humanities to rethink subjectivity and community after the death of the subject. Postmodern science is based on a rejection of the Cartesian dual- ism, which still grounds the dominant paradigm in established science. In the humanities we are used to such rejections. But in established science such a rejection has far-reaching implications and is by no means well accepted. David Ray Griffin, for example, grounds his argument for a postmodern science on this rejection of dualism. In "The Re-Enchantment of Science" Griffin says that the disenchanted world of mechanistic dualist science can be overcome "not by denying the reality of mind or soul but by attributing cre- ativity and experience to cells and their constituents." In this way, the freedom or creativity of subjects is not denied but extended to things that had been considered inert objects. In other words, for Griffin it follows immediately from questioning the established sci- entific practice of dividing subject from object that what had been considered the object of knowledge must be reevaluated and "rec- ognized as a subjective participant in a mutual relationship." Rec-</page><page sequence="10">74 ISLE ognition of mutual interaction is the key to the new approach to knowledge and to the subjectivity of postmodern science. Similarly, ethologist Donald Griffin has called for the scientific study of animal behavior to "go beyond mechanistic behaviorism by speaking of subjective experience." David Ray Griffin takes this point much further, to include many things that may seem even less subjective than animals: Daniel Koshland and his colleagues have provided evidence of rudimentary forms of both "memory" and "decision" in bac- teria. Going even further down, there is reason now to be- lieve that DNA and RNA macromolecules are not simply pas- sive entities which change as their parts are changed, but that they are active organisms which actively transpose their parts. Going even further, it has been suggested that the Pauli Prin- ciple provides reason to think of an atom as a self-regulating whole. (355). Once we blur the distinction between human (subject) and animal (object) and analyze both in terms of memory, decision making, active transposition of parts, or self-regulating wholes, it is diffi- cult to see where one could clearly draw the boundaries between human subjects and nonhuman life-forms. By these new criteria, in some sense all the entities Griffin mentions have qualities that could be considered subjective. This is precisely the point of postmodern science: while there are no clear objects of knowledge, there are many subjects with whom we may interact and so come to under- stand by a process of communication. Along the same lines, in "The Postmodern Challenge to Biology" biologist Charles Birch calls for the attribution of subjectivity to nonhumans. Birch defines subjectivity in the following way: To be a subject is to be responsive, to constitute oneself pur- posefully in response to one's environment. The postmodern view that makes the most sense to me is the one which takes human experience as a high-level exemplifica- tion of entities in general, be they cells or atoms or electrons. All are subjects. All have internal relations ... in biology a distinction is made between a biology that is compositional (sub- stantialist) and one that is relational (ecological). (393)</page><page sequence="11">Collective Subjectivity and Postmodern Ecology 75 Notice that Birch's new biology is ecological by definition. By inter- nal relations, his crucial term, Birch means that there is some degree of internal regulation, some interpretation of signals by the whole entity. So, basically, what Birch proposes is again the extended at- tribution of modified versions of subjectivity to other life forms, to what had been taken as objects by mainstream science. Such sub- jects are constituted at different levels not only by their external environment but by relations within a given entity or system. As Birch says, "I am not saying biologists investigating cells have found mind. I am saying that what they have found is that cells and their DNA molecules are more mind-like than machine-like, in the sense that they exhibit some degree of self-determination, some degree of freedom, no doubt minute at the molecular level"(392). Birch thus argues for the attribution of a limited subjectivity to cells and even to their DNA molecules. The criterion he uses for subjectivity in this case is purposiveness. "Purposiveness" is another way of putting Birch's point on internal relations, namely, that the existence of self- regulation, of interpretation of signals, is a criterion for subjectivity without anthropomorphism. Birch uses the term "subject"; however, I would argue that we might make our task easier in the humanities if we follow Har- away and use "subjectivity." The term "subject" brings in too much homocentric, humanist baggage, and simply using another term, like agency, doesn't change the basic problem. It is a different kind of subjectivity we are trying to imagine. Birch sets it up this way in order to suggest his program for biology: "I cannot really know what it is to be a chimpanzee, let alone a bee, unless I am one. Nor can I know what it is to be you instead of me. But in this latter case, we struggle imaginatively to enter one another's lives. Why should we not seek to do the same with other living organisms? Is not our neighbor all that participates in life?" (395). All these sub- jectivities have purposes of their own. It is not as if we understand them and can see from their perspective, but the project is at least to allow that they have one and to imagine and try to read their forms of interaction and communication within their communities. Established institutional science has denied such a possibility. Taken together, these arguments in postmodern science concur in proposing a new ecological conception of collective subjectivity. They mean collective in two senses: first, they mean each organ-</page><page sequence="12">76 ISLE ism is a collective. The constituents of these collective subjectivities (cells, genetic material, molecules) are also subjective in their own right. Each organism is a collocation of subjectivities. Subjectivities in this view are organized at any number of levels of purposiveness. There is no such thing as a normative individual; rather, there are various degrees of subjectivity that are constructed by our perspec- tive, by our focusing on a particular level of organization. Second, these writers are saying that each organism is intrinsically, that is, ontologically, part of a larger ecosystem that is itself a collective subject- ecosystems are taken as collective subjectivities. Here sub- jectivity is a construct, a function of perspective; it is constructed by focusing on a particular level of organization, from molecules or cells to body subsystems such as the immune system (Haraway), to groups, cultures, and societies of organisms, to watersheds, local ecosystems, bioregions, all the way up to the entire planet. Just as in the Gaia hypothesis (although without necessarily including the spirituality), in postmodern ecology it is possible to envision the entire planet as a form of subjectivity, with its own internal rela- tions and its own forms of purposiveness. Although this notion of subjectivity may seem to be ready to up- set a few scientific applecarts, toward the end of "The Postmodern Challenge to Biology" Charles Birch reminds us that it is "not as revolutionary as it might at first appear": Evolutionary biologists have accepted an important role for purpose in human evolution in what is called cultural evolution. Cultural choices have determined the direction of genetical evolution. Cultural evolution and genetical evolution go hand in hand. But we can also recognize a role that choice and pur- pose play in the lives of other animals. For them, too, cultural evolution is a reality. How far down the line are we prepared to go with this argument? (393, emphasis mine) Indeed, how far down the line are we prepared to go? This is a political question, an ideological question, about our needs as a cul- ture to maintain boundaries between culture and nature, human and animal, inside and outside, and all the other binaries that go with these. Without directly addressing this issue, Birch implies as much when he continues by saying,</page><page sequence="13">Collective Subjectivity and Postmodern Ecology 77 Logically there is no need to draw the line anywhere in the total evolutionary sequence from atoms to humans. This is a chal- lenge of postmodern thought to evolutionary biology today- to propose a role for purpose together with chance in evolu- tion all down the line. This is to propose that, in addition to external relations as causal, internal relations are causal also in determining the direction of evolution. (393) Among postmodern ecological writers, Donna Haraway has gone farthest; that is, she has taken these kinds of insights the farthest and has been the most imaginative. For example, she has taken the immune system as a subject at the subhuman level, as an "icon of postmodern subjectivity" that works by an extremely complex and self-regulating process of reading, a process of recognition and mis- recognition of signs.1 For subjects like this (among others), Haraway uses the term "material-semiotic actor." She introduces this term, as she says, to "highlight the object of knowledge [of a new, postmodern science] as an active, meaning-generating axis of the apparatus of bodily production, without ever implying the immediate presence of such objects or . . . what can count as objective knowledge." Following Harding, Haraway calls for a feminist "successor science" in which all knowledge is partial and situated, not objective. The main re- quirement of this perspectivai and partial knowledge, she says, is that "the object of knowledge be pictured as an actor and agent, not a screen or a ground or a resource." The claim here is not a claim to objective, scientific fact, as scientific knowledge is generally as- sumed to be, but to the kind of knowledge Haraway describes as a partial, situated knowledge, a product of what she calls a "succes- sor science," which for me is a good example of what a postmod- ern science might look like (see "Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective," in Simians , Cyborgs and Women). Haraway, who is not a scientist, is to be distinguished from the male scientists I have mentioned in that her notion of a successor science, what I would call a form of postmodern science, makes sci- ence a feminist project. In this she works in concert with Evelyn Fox Keller ( Reflections on Gender and Science , 1985) and Sandra Hard- ing ( The Science Question in Feminism , 1986). They all show how a</page><page sequence="14">78 ISLE genuine alternative to established dualist science, a postmodern sci- ence, would not only attribute subjectivity beyond the human, it would necessarily be feminist. All the dualistic terms of established, corporate-academic science are coded within patriarchal discourse, and so they have to be completely reinvented. Carol Emshwiller portrays this reinvention in Carmen Dog : since women have been coded by patriarchal science (as represented by the sinister doctor who experiments on animals) as objects in ways not dissimilar to the way in which animals are coded, the women and animals ally as they reappropriate the code and see themselves as all subjects who are fundamentally alike in kind, and different only in degree.2 New Lines of Alliance in Postmodern Ecological Politics The explicit politics of Haraway and Emshwiller 's writing confronts us with the real importance of postmodern science, which has to do with the first reason I called this kind of ecological thought "post- modern, " namely, ecology became something different when it be- came a popular movement and mainstream cliche or commodity in the late 1960s and the 1970s. Haraway and Emshwiller make the concept of collective subjectivity in postmodern science a political issue by drawing on a political notion of collective subjectivity not unlike Guattari and Negri's historical and political notion. Their notion, it will be remembered, was couched in terms of the politi- cal shift of the post-i9Óos new social movements. The political shift these writers have in mind took place in the new Left and in the mass culture of the Western industrial nations in the late 1960s. The underground countercultures and smaller move- ments of the early 1960s had by then become a vast, self-organizing or spontaneously forming array of groups and mass movements for womens' rights, civil rights, black power, Chicanos, American Indi- ans, gays and lesbians, students, yippies, and against the Vietnam War, among others. It was around this time that we saw the end of single-movement politics and the beginning of what we now know as micropolitics and multiculturalism. Since then, the key problems have been cultural, less problems of movement building or staging protests than of building coalitions and forging alliances between all the new social movements. In other words, alliance politics be-</page><page sequence="15">Collective Subjectivity and Postmodern Ecology 79 came the key problem after the small-group movements of the early sixties became mass movements- after they became postmodern and were popularized in the media and swallowed up in counter- culture diffusion and commodification in the late sixties and early seventies. Now the point is to transcode this rhetoric of collective subjec- tivity as derived from these "new social movements" à la Guattari and Negri with the collective subjectivities of postmodern science à la Haraway and Emshwiller. By doing so, we can gain more than a new term, "postmodern ecology," we can gain a new and stronger basis for an entire cultural-ecological politics, one that can work both within and outside the universities and colleges. At the common-sense political level, ecological groups are obvi- ously a few of the new social movements. They may also function as an allying principle of communities, subcultures, and groups. In much of the rhetoric of multiculturalism, different groups and cul- tures have been treated as if they are autonomous; postmodern sci- ence may help us develop clear, functional principles for studying alliance or community. Fredric Jameson claims that only the totalizing dialectic of Marx- ism can counter the fragmented postmodern condition and allow for alliances between the many diverse communities and groups. He addresses an important problem amid the proliferation of multi- cultural and micropolitical cultures and groups; we do need prin- ciples of coherence, relation, and alliance. We have notably lacked such principles, a lack that has tended to incite right-wing critics of multiculturalism in academia, such as Dinesh D'Souza, to rant about "academic chaos." But I would argue that we do not neces- sarily need the principles Jameson has offered; there are other pos- sibilities. To Jameson, although no single allying principle will suf- fice, postmodern ecology would serve better than a totalizing form of Marxism, at least for some of the necessary principles. For some of these principles, postmodern ecology might present some alternatives to Jameson's totalizing postmodernism. Postmod- ern ecological discourse is at least as holistic as Jameson's writing, if not more, but it doesn't totalize or reduce even "in the last in- stance," and it is capable of at least as much detail at the microlevels as Marxism. Nor do we lose a historical perspective. In postmod- ern ecology there is no transcendental, romantic view of nature. Instead, "nature" as a web of ecosystems has fallen into history as</page><page sequence="16">80 ISLE cultural, "material-semiotic actor" (Haraway). Ecology respects and encourages diversity intrinsically and on a material basis, since the primary characteristic of healthy ecosystems is precisely diversity. The evolutionary processes of differentiation and transmutation, which are driven by internal relations as well as external factors (Birch), are also forms of agency, positive engines of change. In this model, the process of evolution itself is as much cultural as it is "natural." This model abrogates the entire culture-nature distinc- tion and denies the uniqueness of human subjectivity. With its notion of collective subjectivity as constituted by internal relations and relative purposiveness, we have the basis for recog- nizing the fundamental community between different species and different cultures. We have the basis for seeing them as intrinsically related within larger "material-semiotic" or ecocultural systems. There are positive structural principles of intrinsic common ground in ecology that allow for alliance at least as well as Jameson's Marx- ism does. Alliances between the established academic critics, multi- cultural communities, and urban environmental groups are already being formed. Both within and outside the academy, groups and cultures that had been seen- and have seen themselves- as autonomous would have more of a concrete basis for deep, intrinsic relationships in- stead of mere external relationships between cultural particles that are seen as essentially distinct. Within academia, it is true we have made some gains toward multiculturalism and an expanded field of study, but at the same time there have been many well-publicized attacks from the far Right, such as Dinesh D'Souza's Illiberal Educa- tion , on "academic chaos." And there are still theoretical and peda- gogical tendencies (left over from the 1960s and the 1970s) toward particularism, that is, toward taking each cultural group as distinct and unrelated. In the face of these problems, the major stumbling block is our relative lack of coherence principles. We need them concretely to reform curricula and the canon and to answer to the critics from the larger culture. Postmodern ecology may provide some part of this larger coherence. Outside the academy, groups are beginning to work together on an ecological basis. The 1987 report by the Rev. Benjamin Chavis's Commission for Racial Justice confirms what most Ameri- cans know: the worst hazardous waste sites and the most toxic areas in the country are in places that house the poorest people</page><page sequence="17">Collective Subjectivity and Postmodern Ecology 81 of color. Studies have shown that pollution and toxic waste in this country have been and are distributed unequally along lines based on peoples' skin color- much more than on, say, economic class. If peoples' health is bad in the inner cities, much of this is the result of essentially racist land use planning. This is a prime example of environmental racism. As Tom Soto says in the Los Angeles Times of April 22, 1994, the en- vironmental movements, which have in the past been mostly white and middle-class, cannot succeed without allying with the urban poor and people of color. Until recently, Charles Lee argues, "the definitions and symbols of environmentalism clearly did not speak to people of color or the poor" (39). However, Lee continues, since the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Sum- mit in October, 1991, in Washington, D.C., that has begun to change. The Summit made clear that, as Lee argues, "an environmental jus- tice perspective is needed for understanding America's urban crisis and what should be done about it" (39). Above all the Summit called for new alliances. Some alliances have already been formed in cities like Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Compact for Environmental Jus- tice, formed in April, 1993, calls for continued cooperation between ethnic and environmental communities. Lee describes the call for alliances this way: South Central Los Angeles and East St. Louis are examples of the central role of racism in determining the nature of the urban environment. ... An environmental justice perspective requires that we see these various subsystems holistically. It demands that we understand the evolution of these interrelated subsystems from a multi-racial and multicultural perspective, keeping in mind the global and historical contexts from which all people of color must necessarily proceed if our integrity as distinct peoples is to be preserved. . . . We begin to draw some fundamental historical assumptions based upon a history of 500 years of colonial oppression, where the exploitation of land and natural resources was intrinsically intertwined with the exploitation of people of color, (p. 40) 3 In the complex web of mutual relations between collective subjects and their environments in postmodern ecology, we may find some part of the basis for cooperation, communication, and possible coali- tion between the various cultures and small groups in the present</page><page sequence="18">82 ISLE situation of multiculturality and micropolitics. The construction of such a basis is important in the face of the powerful particularistic strain in much of "micropolitics" and in some forms of multicultur- alism today, both in academia and in U.S. society at large. I refer to powerful tendencies toward separatism and cultural national- ism, which are derived in part from the separatisms and cultural nationalisms of the 1960s. Multiculturalism is simply a fact of life in America today, and educational institutions must diversify and change in order more accurately to educate, work for, and represent all of the groups and cultures in our diverse society. We must de- velop a more solid theoretical and historical basis for principles of association, commonality, and alliance between the many groups. Too often, we treat each culture or group as if it is completely inde- pendent, as if it is an autonomous entity. Part of this theoretical and historical basis is found in postmod- ern ecology, an ecological, relational, differential notion of collec- tive subjects, all of which are intrinsically a part of and have an ethical responsibility to each other and to a larger "postmodern" environment that is both cultural and natural Ecology is thus not just a scientific theory, nor is it only one of the many existing groups (although it is both of these). Postmodern ecological thought could also be an allying principle between groups and collective subjectivi- ties. Its notion of collective subjectivity helps clarify and highlight what groups and cultures- collective subjectivities at all levels- already have in common: ecological systems. Instead of a disem- powering narrative of the total system and the "death of the sub- ject," in postmodern ecology there is a positive alternative model, a nonsubstantialist, relational (ecological) model of a web of multiple collective subjectivities. NOTES Thanks to Gabriele Schwab and John Carlos Rowe for their encouragement and to Patrick Murphy for his extremely helpful editorial advice and his insightful suggestions for reading. 1. See Donna J. Haraway, "The Biopolitics of Postmodem Bodies: Con- stitutions of Self in Immune System Discourse," in Simians, Cyborgs and Women, pp. 203-30. This is a hot topic for me personally, since I have had an immune-system disorder. Haraway makes an intriguing connection be-</page><page sequence="19">Collective Subjectivity and Postmodern Ecology 83 tween a "biopolitics of postmodern bodies/' immunology, and a politics of health and the environment. I will go one step farther to link these issues to environmental racism and movements for urban environmental justice (see the next section). 2. Several articles by Patrick Murphy start from a similar basis but de- velop these ideas further. Murphy deploys a positive model of a politics of subjectivity and works with this connection of ecology and feminism. However, in "Prolegomenon for an Ecofeminist Dialogics" and "Ground, Pivot, Motion," his work goes much farther with the feminist implications of this argument and he argues that what the combination of ecology and feminism needs for a method is Bakhtinian dialogics. Murphy's presenta- tion makes dialogics sound like exactly the model to elaborate the basic point I am making about dialogue, interaction, and the recognition of other subjectivities in a mutual interrelationship of community. Furthermore, in "Ground, Pivot, Motion" he connects all these issues to specific examples of literary practice. 3. Two more good examples here are the Southwest Network for Envi- ronmental and Economic Justice (SNEEJ) and the Southwest Organizing Project (SWOP). Community activist Richard Moore has played a large part in both of these Albuquerque-based groups. See Almeida, "The Net- work for Environmental and Economic Justice in the Southwest" in the excellent Santa Cruz-based journal Capitalism Nature Socialism. This journal has covered many issues pertinent to this essay and has covered ecologi- cal struggles in specific countries outside the United States and clarified the connection of these struggles to other political issues. Capitalism Nature Socialism tries to make ecology more directly political; however, the jour- nal tends to place less emphasis than I do here on what might distinguish a postmodern ecology, and it emphasizes traditional socialist issues more than I have.
