<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE A MERIC A N JOIJRNAL OF PSYCHOLOGUY Founded by G. STANY HALL in 1887. VOL. VIII. JANUARY, 1897. No. 2. A STUDY OF FEARS. BY G. STANLEY HALL. As psychological research has lately tended towards will and feeling, the limitations, of both the experimental and the introspective methods, have grown increasingly apparent, and in some directions are now e2riguous and almost painful. We can neither excite the stronger emotions in the labora- tory nor coolly study ourselves while they are on under nat- ural conditions. Moreover, the many instinct-feelings come to but very partial and incomp]ete expression in any single in- dividual. To bring them out clearly, averages, mosaics, com- posites from many lives may, I think, be used to show both the relative depth and the vastly wider ranges of psychic es- perience. C)hildhood, too, must be explored, because despite the higher reaches of the adult consciousness much is, and by the necessities of growth must be, forever lost to it. There is a standpoint from which the adult mind, like the adult body, is decadent. It was in view of this general situation that we have evoked the aid of the questionnaire method in this field, striven to give it both new applications and new developments and devised a scheme of treating data, all of which together are bearing important fruits, and can do some things impossiblebefore. By these means, too, psychology is brought into closer contact with human life over more and larger areas, and also given practical bearings, and that in several fields, as well as enabled to esert corrective influences on certain tendencies now too manifest in psychology. Hardest and all important is the choice of a topic. This</page><page sequence="2">148 HAT,T.: must often be so common and homely that the only wonder is no one had ever thought of it before as a theme for special research. It must be accessible to the psychological methods and have a certain ripeness and opportuneness. It must be specific, as opposed to the former blanket or omni- bus syllabus. It must call for phenomena so marked that the non-expert parent or teacher can make reliable returns, as the untrained observers have long done to the offi- cial and voluminous questionnaires worked by four Eu- ropean anthropological societies, by students of meteor- ological phenomena, migratory instincts of birds, fishes, etc. Questions must suggest every main aspect, but no one answer rather than another, and must call for form enough so that the data can be fully treated statis- tically, yet must leave freedom enough to bring out details of all important cases nvhich may be abridged and cited, as are clinical illustrations in medical literature,even if morebriefly, because more numerous. Suchideals are rarely if ever attained. The following re- port is well calculated, however, to show both the merits and defects of the method. It is based upon the returns to one of the thirty-two syllabi isslled from Clark University up to September, 1896. Some preliminary tests had preceded, and in Februazy, 1895, it was sent to 748 persons? about half of whom had heard of our series of which this was No. IN:- and had requested it: 1. Fears of celestial phenomena, as, e. g., of winds, storms, thun- der andlightning, heavenly bodies, meteors, sky falling, cloud, mist, fog and cloud-forms; end of the world and attendant phe- nomena; night and darkness, eclipse; moon breaking, that the sun may not rise; peculiar sky colors, northern lights, e2rcessive heat and cold, loss of orientation, and points of compass. 2. Specialinanimate objects, as fire and conflagration; water, drowning and washing or being washed; punishment and its in- struments, and things and places associated with it; falling and of high places; uncanny places, as caves, ravines, gorges, forest gloom, high hills and solitude generally, and getting lost, or shut up; guns andweapons; points, sharp edges, very narrow or wide open spaces; dirt on garments or skin, and contact generally;vehi- cles and riding. 3. Living things, self-moving things generally; big eyes, mouth, teeth; dog, cat, snakes, pigs, rats and mice, spiders, bugs and bee- tle#, toad#, etc.; #ight of blood, robber# and burglar# #tranger#, #ociety and ba#hfulne##; fear of being laughed at, talkea of or being ridiculou#; #hyne## of oppo#ite #es; fear of fighting; cowardice, poltroonery, #u#piciou#ne#s. 4. Di#ea#e, dying, death, lo## of friend#, po#ition, fortune, beauty, or of health generally; heart di#ea#e, cancer#, fit#, con#umption, #tarvation, fear of prevalent di#ea#e#, or of tho#e read of. 5. Fear# of the #upernatural, e. g., ghost#, #pirit#, witche#, fairie#, dragon# or mythological monster#; dream fear#, con#cience fear#, a# of having committed unpardonable #in#; puni#hment#</page><page sequence="3">specially incurred or sent from heaven, loss of 80ul and ne2rt world fears generally, fears of sin or impurity. 6. Describe any 8uddan e2rperience you have felt or observed, and whether involving only distinct #prise or being intense enough to cause }eal shock, start or astonishment, with details of cause, eSects and their permanence; terrors, without danger or cause othe} than an hereditary or a traumatic disposition to timidity. 7. In each case state order and age of fears, how long they lasted, how intense they were, what acts they prompted, and edu- cational good or bad effects; was sleep affected? State specific symptoms, starting, paleness or sweat, urinations, rigidity, cramps, horripilations and " creepy crawling " feelings, nausea, weakness, fainting, flight, causes, treatment andoures. This syllabus is drawn up by the undersigned, and is sent to you with the request that you will read it carefully item by item, and (1) jot down at once inthe easiest form of notes whatever each paragraph or phrase recalls of your own childish fears; (2) that if you are a parent you will add to this any observations this paper may suggestor recall on your own children (it may aid you if you keep a " life book " or memoranda in any form about them); (3) that if you are a teacher, you will read this paper to your class, write it on the board,or give it to individual pupils (of upper gram- mar or high school grades&gt;) and ask them to svrite as an e2rercise in composition (setting apart an hour, or asking for out of school work) an account of their own early or present fears; (4) if you are a normal school principal or teacher of psychology, you may con- nect it with the class work in the study of feelings or emotions; (5) if you are a principal or superintendent, you can assign the work to some teacher or advancedpupil to collect the data. All returns may be anonymous if preferred, but age, ses and nationality must be stated in every case. Returns may be sent dlrect to the undersigned or, if preferred may be studied by you, and will malre the best of material for a lesson in psychology, for a discussion in a meeting of teachers or mothers, or an address, or an article for the press. When you are entirely done with the material thus gathered and used, send it to the undexsigned. This syllabus was reprinted in several educational jour- nals in this country and in :E:ngland, and was also privately printed and multiplied by teachers and others. Returns which are the data of this paper were received as follows: E. E. Russell, principal of the State Normal School, Wor- cester, Mass., sent 266 papers, each describing a single case of fear These had been previously written, with no reference to any syllabus, but were the fear cases selected from nearly 40,000 returns made by his pupil teachers according to a method elsewhere described. 1 Their chief merit is concise- ness, an attempt at photographic objectivity and absence of comment. Of these 134 were original observations, 88 remi- niscence, 39 hearsay, and the rest from literature. They are well distributed between the ages 4 months and 12 years, and 1 PedagogieaG Sentnary, Vol. II, p. 343. X STUDY OF FEARS. 149</page><page sequence="4">the seses reported on are nearly equal in number, ez:cept the reminiscences, which are mostly by females. Miss Lillie A. Williams, head of psychology at the Tren- ton, N. J., Normal School, sent reports by 461 persons, of which 118 were original, 163 reminiscence, 75 hearsay. The reminiscences averaged sis or seven pages of note paper each The other 105 were compositions on their fears, past and pres- ent, by girls from 5 to 18. Miss Williams has developed the most effective of all methods for collecting valuable returns to questionnaires, which is described elsewhere.2 Principal E. S. Baker of St. Paul sent 552 papers, well dis- tributed over all grades; those older writing their fears in the form of a composition after having the syllabus read and explained, and the younger children having their answers written by teachers. Principal R. G. Euling of the English high school, Cam- bridge, Mass., explained and assigned this as a topic for one of his daily themes, and sent returns from 77 juniors, 6 inter- mediates, 55 undesignated, and from the main division of tlis school volunteers brought 18 returns and obtained 17 from children, making in all 173. M;ss I3:ughes, principal of the training school at Cam- bridge, England, sent 43 one hour compositions of unusual merit, by girls of from 17 to 22 years of age. Miss Harriman of Providence, R. I.t sent 23 compositions very similar to the above. lliss Stickney of the Eughes high school Cincin- nati, O., sent 45 compositions on their fears by senior girls. Superintendent Pease of Northampton, Mass., sent 46 volun- teer compositions by children of from 13 to 16. Mrs. J. M. Dewey of North AdamsS Mass., 19 high school composi- tions; the BufEalo Seminary, 18 compositions by young women from 17 to 21; J. W. Disoll, 17 fear compositions by girls averaging 16; 38 were from friends and pupils of mine and others, some of whom have written with the great- est care and fullness. Too late to be included in any of the tables, but utilized along with the above for illustration, and in discussing special fears are the followillg: 115 supplementry returns on special fears from Miss Williams; 27 volunteer composi- tions on their fears by seniors in Bowdoin College, sent by President Eyde; 44 well digested returns from children of 13 and 14, by Miss E1. M. Bullis of Summit, N. J.; about 200 well classified returns sent anonymously, and other returns on specific points especially asked for, from various other sources. 2See her article," How to Collect Data for Studies in GFenetic Psy- HAT.T. chology," Pedagogical Seminary, Vol. III, p. 419. 150 </page><page sequence="5">151 A STUDY OF FEARS. The data used for the first tabulation, therefore, consists of the records of the chief fears of 1,701 people, mostly under 23 years of age, gathered in different places and by methods without great uniformity, and 386 supplementary reports and many returns or special points, all written on nearly 4,000 pages. Some merely list the objects they fear, and others give copious details of a single fear or even fright; some report half a dozen fears of their own and add others of their friends, sometimes omitting not only age, but ses. Thus the problem of statistics was rendered exceedingly difficult, and each table is based upon only those returns which yield its data, so that everything had to be gone over independ- ently for each table. With the expert aid of Miss Watson, as- sisted by Miss Rawson and others, every individual was first represented in large tables by a line showing each of his or her fears, with age and ses, and with fullness of presentation marked on a scale of 10, with hieroglyphic signs for special features and a wide column for miscellanies. In these elabo- rate charts returns from each locality were kept by them- selves, and running numbers referred to the original papers. It is upon these, too many and too voluminous to print, that the tables below are based. The 112 hearsay cases were dis- carded. Nest I read every paper with care myself, copying every salient or typical phrase and word, but dropping what was irrelevant, and condensing wherever possible. These cases were written as they came, and when all was done, scissored into several thousand slips, and with great lahor brought into natural groups, and thus allowed to classify themselves. Each of these groups was later studied by itself, and, after each case had been brought next to that which it most resembled, all were pasted in dlle order. This process gave me several hun- dred closely written pages of topically arranged experiences, the reading of which subject by subject, without a word of comment, the best members of my class have intimated was followed with the very greatest interest, and was a fresh breath from life full of stimulus and suggestion of new and larger fields for the psychology of the near fllture. As a pedagogic as well as a scientific method, subsequent es- periences too, are inereasing my own sense of its exceptional worth. Like the above preliminary tables, this form of the material is too voluminous to present in full, but in all the descriptions of the special fears which follow, Ihavehad them under my eye, so that although my pages are not disfigured with quotation marks, I have followed the very phrases of the returns as closely as possible, and it is only by esercising the greatest self-control that I refrain, despite limitations of</page><page sequence="6">152 RAT.T.: space, from doubling my pages with the records of cases of great interest. The above 1,701 persons have described 6,456 fears, nvhich are first very roughly grouped as follows, according to the objects feared: TABLE I. Celestial Phenomena. Thunder and lightning, High wind, Cyclones, Clouds and their forms, Meteors, Northern lights, Comets, Fog, Storms, Eclipses, Extreme hot weather, Extreme cold weather, Darkness, Ghosts, Dream fears, Solitude, Animals. Reptiles, Domestic animals, Wild animals, Insects, Rats and mice, Cats and dogs, Birds, Eire, Water, Drowning, Strange persons, Robbers, Death, Disease, 603 143 67 44 34 25 8 6 4 4 0 8 996 432 203 109 55 799 483 268 206 203 196 79 51 1,486 365 205 67 627 436 163 _ 589 299 241 _ 540 This accounts for I,037 fears,leavingl,419 directed to many scores of objects to be discussed later. It would appear that thunder storms are feared most, that reptiles follow, with strangersand darkness as close seconds, nvhil? fire, death, domestic animals, disease, wild animals, water, ghosts, in- sects, rats and mice, robbers, high winds, dream fears, cats and dogs, cyclones, solitude, drowning, birds, etc., represent decreasing degrees of fearfulness. When we specify reptiles, domestic animals, insects, birds, the kinds of disease, strangers, dream fears, and add the miscellaneous fears, we have in all 298 objects feared. This order, however, is not quite the same in different localities. In Cambridge, Mass., alone thunder and lightning does not lead, and self-conscious- ness, dreaded by 24 boys there, does not appear in either Trenton or St. Paul. In the latter place 67 fear cyclones and only 8 the end of the world, which has 62 victims in Tren- ton, where also 46 fear being buried alive.</page><page sequence="7">153 s STUDY OF FEARS The St. Paul returns, moreover, show an average of 4.86 fears for each person, those from Trenton 3.66, while the Cambridge, Mass., boys report 2.28 each. Whether this in- dicates more fears, more frankness, or,as I suspect, more im- portance attached to the work, and greater interest in it at St. Paul lihan at Cambridge, there is nothing to show. The St. Paul fears lead all others in intensity and objective realism; their quality is more primitive, fand they have less variety. lIere we have 7 out of the 9 children who declare that they " fear nothing," and 4 out of the 7 who " fear everything," and here only we meet with fears of train robbers, having to sleep on the porch, and starvation. Yet while one could not read the fears in any group of returns without inferring whether the children lived in the country or city, by the sea or in the hills, all the local coloring is, on the whole, sur- prisingly small. Selecting nest from our returns the 1,106 well described fears of 500 boys and the 1,765 fears of 500 girls on the 28 topics below, they were tabulated as follows to show the effect of ses: TABLE II. F. M. F. M. Thunder and lightning, 230 155 Blood, 44 14 Persons, 190 129 Heights, 40 43 Reptiles, 180 123 Self-consciousness, 40 28 Darkness, 171 130 Noises, 36 10 Death, 102 74 Buried alive, 32 6 Domestic animals, 96 57 Imaginarythings, 24 23 Rats and anice, 75 13 Drowning, 20 19 Insects, 74 52 Clouds, 15 4 Ghosts, 72 44 Solitude, 15 4 Wind, 61 35 Places, 14 2 End of world, 53 11 Meteors, 12 6 Water, 53 62 Shyness, 8 9 Robbers, 48 32 Fairies, 7 Mechanism, 47 31 Ridicule, 6 1 'rhus out of 500 girls 230 report fear of thunder and light- ning, while the same number of boys report this fear but 155 times. In this, in fears of the end of the world, rats and mice, blood, and being buried alive, girls most lead boys, while boys excel girls only in fears of water, height and shy- ness. From the above it will appear that each of the boys has 2.21 fears, while each of the girls has 3.55 fears. Again, out of all our returns, 516 boys with 1,521 fears and 671 girls with 3,101 fears were selected and grouped by ageto show the relation of age to fears for both seses as follows:</page><page sequence="8">TABLE III. AGE. M. AV. F. AV. 0 4 36 1.76 74 4.89 4 7 144 1.54 176 2.44 7 - 11 104 3.56 227 4.34 11 - 15 140 3.69 127 6.22 15 - 18 72 2.40 38 10.67 18 - 26 50 2.55 29 4.31 524 (2.94) 671 (4.62) 2.58 5.46 Thus 36 boys below 4 years of age return 1.76 fears each, while 74 girls of the same age average 4.89 fears each, etc. All these boys record 2.94, and all these girls 4.62 fearseach. The fears of the boys increase from 7 to 15, and then decline,while those of the girlsincrease more steadily from 4 to 18. Taking the seses together, the following classes of fears show decline with advancing maturity: meteors, clouds, blood, end of the world, being kidnapped, fairies, loss of or- ientation, shyness of strangers; while the following seem to increase: thunder and lightning, reptiles, robbers, self-con- sciousness, machinery. Inerease during pubescent years,with subsequent decline, appears in wind, darkness,water, domes- tic animals, insects, ghosts, death and disease. With scores of other fears the numbers are too small even to give valua- ble suggestions. Important as is the influence of age, its de- termination has been baSing throughout; increased poweras well as love of expression is a concomitant variation. While many special fears decline and others increase with age, many infantile fears remain through life, and scores of our reporters say there has been no change in their fears. Passing nonv to our special groups, we begin with: I. FEAR OF IIIGE PLACES AND FALLING: GRAVITY FEA RS. (All the cases tn thts andf the followtny sectzons are selected from a large number.) 1. F., 16.1 Has no fear of falling from high places, but the impulse to throw herself down is so intense she must strain every muscle to get away, and must often call for immediate help; often there is a sense of smothering. 2. F., 17. Describes the same impulse in order to see how it feels going donvn, and is exceedingly curious to know how it would feel to fall very far. 1 F., 16Female si2rteen years old. M.Male. 164 HAT.T.:</page><page sequence="9">A STUDY OF FEARS. 155 3. F., 12. Could only go up a high elevator by having a handker- chief tied over her eyes; svhen at the top she trembled and felt like leaping down till blindfolded again. 4. F., 13. At the top of a high building was irresistibly impelled to squeeze between the bars of the railing to see if one could fall to the pavement; is sure she would have landed there if she had not been held, and describes it as an outside power forcing her against her will, as very terrible and conquering her control. 6. M., 16. Could never climb the smallest tree; happening to glance over high banisters lately, he sprang back across the hall with a shiver lest by sudden impulse he should hurl himself down, and lie a mangled mass. 6. F. A young Scotch lady has such dread of falling that she can never go up or down stairs when it is dark, and never e2rcept very slowly; for the samereason she could never learn to skate, and often in slippery weather stands still and cannot take a step; she once tried rolling down hill with other girls, but trembled for an hour; can do nothing on gymnastic apparatus; is never giddy, and never had a bad fall. 7. F., 17. On going down an elevator always ftsels that she is going straight to the bottomless pit spoken of in the Bible, and has nausea if she gazes down; wells have always had a great fascina- tion for her; she never liked to stand and gaze down them, but had to. 8. F. 37. Can never enter a store with a big sign over the door, lest it siould fall on her; if it swings or creaks, it is all the worse; she is always fearing the stars will fall and crush the earth, or that meteors will drop on her. 9. F., 10. Eas for years had the greatest desire to look down a very deepwell which the children thought bottomless, but has never yet dared. 10. M., 11. When on a high place always vants to try to fly ofE. 11. F., 23. Almost faints to see others on high places. 12. F. Can never cross a ravine or high bridge nor sleep in an upper story. 13. M. A professor of psychology, age 60, was fearless of high places through his youth, but soon after college saw a servant fall from his room four stories, helped bring him in, went for a doctor, but since cannot sleep in high rooms at a hotel; tried in vain to as- cend Bunker Hill monument as a discipline, but found the tension too great when half way up; could only get over the suspension bridge at Niagara eighteen years later by walking in the middle and grasping a carriage; the fear is rather more that the whole structures may collapse, but partly that he will lose control. 14. F., 17. Cannot look straight up without dizziness and fear Hof falling and sometimes losing her footing. 16. M., 17. Is almost as afraid to look up as down heights. 16. M., 46. Can never sit under the chandeliers at a theatre, nor -under the front of a gallery, for fear things will drop on him. 17. F., 16. Has never been able to sail past the Palisades on the Hudson without fearing they would fall. 18. F. A lady's only memory of her grandfather was that he would lift and toss her high. 19. F., 8. Was visiting a large farm, where she was very happy till she learned there was a well on it, when she ran in, wept and</page><page sequence="10">156 HAT.T.: prayed to go home; " she cried all night, and was always so about wells." 20. M., 30. Can never sit in front row of the gallery at church. 21. F., 28. Can only do so by clinging tight to the next person, " lest I should leap down on the congregation." 22. F. A mother says her eight children have always been in- tensely e2rcited on being lifted towards the ceiling. 23. F. 56. Went to the top of the Eiffel tower and enjoyed it greatly, but the memory of so doing has since come to fill her with nightly terrors. 24. F., 24. Can never go up any open stairs or steps "without mortal trepidation lest some one should catch my feet." 26. F., 27. Cannever walk up steps or on iron flooring with openings as large as a pin lest she should fall through. 26. F., 40. Is haunted with the fear of falling down stairs, and at night often sees herself a mass of broken bones at the foot. 27. M. An officer in a woman's college; has for many months suffered with great and sleepless ansiety lest the college girls should be hurt running down some steep bank. 28. M., 3. Is horrified at riding down hill, shouts " drive slow! " clutches his mother's arm, gets nervous and trembles. 29. F., 18. Can never look out of a window above the first floor without feeling she must jump to get the beautiful sensation of dropping through the air; she is not dizzy, but has a sinking feeling at the heart. 30. F., 18. Eas worried for years lest she or others might fall off the earth into space; this danger she deemed greatest at night, when all was upside down, but it was possible any time. 31. M., 18. Otherwise normal, has never been able to ride in any kind of vehicle, neither cars, bicycles, boats nor carriages, and de- scribes another boy of 15 with the same fear. 32. F., 16. Loves driving, buthas a horror of going up hill or down. 33. F., 27. Can never ride in a carriage with comfort, for she always fears it will break and let her drop. 34. F., 17. Can never drive over mountain roads that go near gorges or steep places. The last four cases each state that their fear has been caused by no accident. 35. M., 16. The horror of hell is, you are always falling. 36. M.,45. Thechieffearisthathewillleapoutof thewindow in his sleep; he takes precautions every night, but never yet got up in his sleep. 37. M., 21. In his early teens he dreamed so often of flying that he often woke feeling sure he had found out how; it became very pleasant. 38. F., 9. Feared she should fall through cracks where puddles had dried. 39. M., 31. Is sometimes impelled to sacrifice all when on a high place to get the esquisite pleasure of dropping, mith a wild feeling he might be borne up a little, or strike a soft spot 40. F., 6. Would not go to heaven, it was so high and she might fall. 41. M., 67. Speculated much on the effects of "reversed grav- ity," wluich he thought probable sometime. 42. F., 6. Used to have great fears of being carried as a baby;</page><page sequence="11">157 s STUDY OF FEARS. was once startled at a high hill suddenly seen in riding, and could not bear to have a cloud get directly overhead. Some come to ratherlike the sensation of hovering, as case 37, and perhaps 10 or for a time almost thiilk they can fly from nightmare experiences. (See under dream cases 41 aDd 30.) For 2, 10 and 39 the sensation of dropping or sinking seems to have a charm so strong as to endanger control. For nearly all,these feelings are dreadful, and they may be caused by going up or down hill, 27, 28, 32; or stairs, 6, 26; or by the smallest openings 38, 25; may make every kind of riding a terror, 31; even to stand on ice is too suggestive, 6; gal- leries and second stories are avoided, 1o, 12, 21, 'M0; wells and elevators are shunned, 7, 9, 19; to see others high, or to look down or even up, is painful, 1l, 15, 14; and perhaps the dread of seeing things above, as 8,17,16, belongs here. Case 30 is one of many cases I have collected of " symptoms "- of the thought of falling into space, or in even thinking of in- finite time or space, which makes many dizzy and nauseated, (see later paper on sense of self, and what I have called cosmic giddiness, or cosmic agoraphobia). These gravity fears are so common that it would probably be very easy to enlarge the above anthology of cases in- definitely, and every reader will readily add to it from his own or others' e2rperience. Such fears, it is safe to assume, are very largely due to falls, etc. Despite the symptoms common to all fears, and even despite the absurd tendency to give Greek names to objects feared (which, as Arndt says, would giveus such terms as klopsophobia-fear of thieves, triakaidekapho- bia- fear of the number 13, and following which the 298 things feared in our returns might each have its name), with- out any suggestion of a new morbid entity, it would be con- venient to have a term like barophobia for the gravity fears, and elusesthesia for the group of falling sensations, and ana- kataesthesia for hovering, etc. In actllally dropping through space, the usual pressure of brain, heart, liver, kidneys and all other parts of the body upon those beneath is removed. The stoinach with its con- tents is often the first to be aflected, and nausea arises. Be- sides the tension caused by the tonus of the arterial and ve- nous walls, the blood in the erect posture eserts the pressure of fluids in upright tubes. In falling this latter is removed, as in being lifted the conditions of pressure would be re- versed. Eow this modifies sensation is unknonvn, but it is not impossible that the gravity movements of the fluids of the semi-circular canals represent, a specialized function and organ once common to all vessels. Breuer1 thinks he has proven l Uber die Function der Otolithen Apparate von I Breuer. Pflu- ger's Archiv. Bd 48. P. 195.</page><page sequence="12">158 HALL: that the gravity of the otolith plates in the ear pulls the cell hairs and excites thus in the centers the sense of the position of the head, and are organs of a specific feeling for ver- tical and progressive motion. These constitute the organ for Xa static sense, giving impressions of translatioll, as the am- pull do of rotation, in the three planes of space. It is even suggested that out of the function of sensing disturbances in the surrounding medium that endanger gravity the perception of sound waves has been developed as a secondary function. A gain heart action and eirculation are modified in falling, and so is respiration. As lungs have taken the place of swim- bladders, the unique respiratory action of hovering as in nightmares, with all the anakatesthesic phenomena, and perhaps the eluesthesic sensations of a falling which are quite distinct from the former, although not without common elements, suggest the possibility that here traces of function may have survived structure. Inhalation is harder, and in dropping great distances the residual breath is sucked from the lungs. The removal of the pressure always felt on the soles of the feet, podes, or other sustaining surface, and the appro2zimation to a prenatal state of fluid pressure on all sides, visual, auditoryt perhaps now muscular coordination, a11 this brings conditions throughout every part of the body which are unique in a high degree. Our animal ancestors were not birds, and we cannot inherit sensations of flying, but they floated and swam far longer than they have had legs, had a radically different mode of breathing, and why may there not be vestigial traces of this in the soul, as there are of gill slits under the skin of our ecks; and why may not the former come to as great promi- nence in exceptional states and persons as the latter do in some monstrous human birthse To deny it is to make the soul more limited in its backward range than is the body. For one I am too idealistic and cannot think so meauly of the soul as to do this. Although it cannot be demonstrated like rudimentary organs, I fee] strongly that we have before us here some of the oldest elements of psychic life, some faint reminiscent atavistic echo from the primeval ses, not as primitive as the strange geotro- pism of plants, but antedating perhaps limbs, and possibly even visual factors of space perception, and which could it be dissected and explored far enough might lead us, in connection with II and III seq., near the psychoplasm of the spatial quale itself. Indeed I may be teratological, but to me sensations of hovering, gliding by a rather inner impulse and not by limbs, falling and rising have been from boyhood very real both sleeping and waking, and I may add with as-</page><page sequence="13">9 s STUDY OF FEARS. sured soundness of heart, lungs and stomach, although if aaused by disease it would not hurt the argument. Again, man's erect position is exceptional and lately ac- quired. The e2rhilaration of a child at its first step is due to a real feat of balancing. The vigorons soon love to play with these sensations in tossing, baby jumpers, coasting, swving- ing, the motions of vessels at sea, mountain climbing, bal- looning, tight rope, bridge jumping, and now flying. LotzeJ ascribes the aesthetic pleasure of stilts, high heels, tall hats, etc., to the e2rquisite exhilaration of slightly raising the cen- tre of gravity. The monkey-like propensity of children at a certain age to climb everything, everywhere? which needs special investigation, is another illustration, and so in a dif- ferent way is the rhetorical device of a German professorwho had three steps, on one or more of which he could rise to es- press to himself and enforce to his hearers the relative em- phasis or loftiness of his utterance. The words buoyancyS exaltation, and conversely heaviness and depression, are suggestive. Unusual vigor of muscles gives a sensation of lightness, amounting sometimes almostl to a belief in levita- tion, or in the reality of the state of rapt ecstasy, or in the glories of a physical ascension. On the other hand, caseslike two I know, of persons with exceptional fragility of bones, which were at any time liable to spontaneous fracture, and who therefore had just fears of standing that nvould other- wise seem morbid; or hypochrondriacs, like Tolstoi's case of the man who thought he was glass, slipped one day, despite all his preposterous precautions, said smash and died; or cases of inverted gravity, like No. 41, or a paranoiac who, when about to hurl a visitor from the roof to show God's sustaining power, desisted at the suggestion that this power would be still better shown if both should go down and jump up;-all show not primitive, but perversely developed forms of the baraesthesic sense. These latter and most of our fear cases may be considered as instances of arrest, some at the stage before erect position was acquired (6, and perhaps 2S, 26, 27 and 28, and many fears of falling over if near steep places), and others as due to an awakening of the normal impulse of the young of the Buman species to get up, not only to the full length of the body, but beyond. At any rate, where in the soul might we expect to come upon traces of farpast conditions if not in such massive impacted sensations as theset Must we not assume function to be as old and as diversitied as organst Even its morphogenic value may be far beyond the wildest dream of Tamark if we accept such speculations as those of Cope or even of Rous.

FEAR OF LOSING ORIENT A TION. t. F. 7 to 10. Often woke up in terror and cried loudly because she could not think where she was, even whether in bed or not. 2. F., 19. Sweats, feels faint and nauseated if she cannot in- stantly locate every door and window on waking nights. 3. F., 20. Is speechless and motionless with dread if she wakes up crossways or diagonally in bed, often thinking she has been car- ried elsewhere. 4. F., 19. Used often as a child to wake up on the floor, and had to'creep around to find the bed and everything else; was sick, dizzy and frightened, and thought she could never be right again. 5. F., 17. Often wakes with a sensation of being in the wrong bed, with windows misplaced, or being surrounded by thick walls, with a peculiar feeling of suffocation. 6. F., 18. Can never have furniture moved in her bedroom, be- cause the feeling of being turned round gives her a terrible panic. 7. F., 21. Never has suffered from any other fear so great as that of getting lost or turned around in bed; in every strange place this fear keeps her awake; she has always been haunted with fear that she should lose her way from school and go off in the wrong direction, although the ground wasvery familiar; the fear of get- ting the wrong classroom always haunts her; she can never enter the smallest forest, and can never turn a corner or cwve without fearing it is wrong and painfully fixing the angles in her mind. 8. M., 12. Suffers from the constant fear of losing the points of compass in city or country. 9. F., 20. Awakes in anguish till she knows which way is north, and the sense of lost direction may come suddenly and stunningly upon her anywhere. 10. F. An English woman is haunted by the thought of losing the points of compass in some wood; it is accompanied by a sick- ening sensation, and sometimes by the fear of dying alone of starvation. t1. M., 7. Clings desperately to hi3 mother when turning any angle, shopping, or e]sewhere. 12. F., 35. In a sea voyage suffers from an elaborate fear that the ship will lose her chart or compass. lSee especially O. Butschli, "Untersuchungen uber Mikroscop- ische Schaume und das Protoplasma."

At 10 F., 17 " began to realize eternity and think on the end of time, space and the world;" this brought a feeling of weakness and palpitation; "made her serious and thoughtful," and she de- veloped a ritual of Bible X erses and hymns for such occasion. 14. F., 25. Has "always had a horror of the vastness of eter- nity; the most creepy feelings came over me at the thought; these things haunted me till twenty,when a reaction came, and I thought I believed in annihilation and loved the idea of being universally diffused." 15. F., 21. Never could go off with her mates because of the in- cessantfear lest they should hide from her; to be lost for an in- stant brought the most sickening feeling. 16. M., 42. A college teacher, ambidestrous, has always had difficulty in telling right from left; at corners must oftell pause and think, is always getting turned around, and sometimes grows nervous about it. 17. M., 27. Studied a year in Berlin, but was never happy there because east would seem west and the stln went the wrong way. 18. M., 72. A very intelligent farmer, has never been but twenty-two miles from his home, because he dislikes strange places and people, and might get lost. 19. Till F. was 3 she saw very little of outdoors, and then it op- pressed her; to attend to distant things seemed painful, and she would never go twenty feet from the door. 20. M.,3. Had all one summer an uncontrollable passion for running away; his proclivity was to get away at any time, any- where. 21. M., 38. Must have a map of every town or city he is in or carry one in his head, or else he gets confused. 22. F., 18. Could never go the shortest distance across lots, no matter how plainly she can see across, without getting confused and turned round. Some or all of the first sis cases above may have struggled out of a dream of a very different environment, with strange and possibly alarming features. Children's dreams of place are very vivid and melt like dissolving views illto the wak- ing sense of the real environment. " Where am Ie" is often thefirst problem of their morning consciousness, and there are often as strange oscillations and mosaics of the two states, as in hypnagogic phenomena. Everything in the room is a lighthouse or buoy to aid them into safe harbor from the far dream voyages, and so cannot be moved without confusion. Some writers attach the greatest importance to spontaneous and especiallJr to complete waking. Dread of getting lost is common, 15, 18, 19, and may be hypertrophied, and the attractions of " sweet home " may be even too strong. Chil- dren differ immensely in the quickness and certainty of learning the environment, and probably earen more in the vigor and courage to explore it. Cases like 8 and 19, and perhaps 9, 10 and 15, almost suggest atavistic relapsetoward the early forms of sessile life, or attachment to parental</page><page sequence="16">162 HALL: bodies, and remind us how 810w and late in the animal series well developed locomotor organs came. On the other hand the propensity of children to run away is very common, but although shown here only in 20 suggests the migratory in- stinct# of birds, fishes, animals, nomadic races, the spring fever so common among northern races after their long wvinter mentioned by Holmgren, scholares va.qantes, tramps, es- plorers, globe trotters, etc. The primitive eye, ear and nose are organs of orientation to direct movement. The motor powers which selection develops are intense and sustained before they become manifold. The sensations of active and especially of passive motion are so esquisite, the experi- ences of travel so absorbing, and the new modes of transportation have so increased man's range and changed his habits, that although observation shows that the natural configurations of rolling ground and salient land- marks are among the earliest and most persistent of all the forms of memory, to part with them forever now rarely causes the phenomena of homesickness. On sea, desert and prairie, the " loved spots whieh our infancy knew " lack characteristics, and hence have little anchoring power. Cases 13 and 14, are vastations of this fear of getting lost to cosmic dimensions. Even to know in what direction the solar system is moving may mitigate cosmic dizziness as a map steadies 21, or knowing the points of compass, 8, 9 and 10. Hard as it is for children to tell p from q, few con- fuse p and b, so people may find it hard to tell right from left, walk in a circle, etc., and because there is no magnetic sense for north, the mortal dangers of getting lost in a primi- tive, gregarious life must have been vivid and prompted to a careful study of all landmarks, and, especially on plains, of the heavens. That some of the common phenomena of ori- entation among children have philogenetic elements, due to such allcestral experiences, I think probable. Animal life must act, but to do so it must distinguish front and back, the directions toward and from which action tends, must have more and more fixed localization to act from and on, must push out, away, and on, but later wants anchorage, and so acquires a persistent thought of return. This kind of ori- entation must also be a very primitive factor in the develop- ment of spacefeelings. IIT. FEAR OF (5,LOSENESS. 1. M., 14.

M. 28. Cannot endure a closed carriage; it is not the riding, but the teing shut up. 4. M., 18. Has such horror of being smothered that if, in a boy- ish scuffle, his head gets in chancery, or he gets sat upon, he has a panic and yells murder. 6. F., 18. Often dreams of being shut up, makes a great strug- gle, but can never throw ofT the impression until she sees a bright light. 6. F., 36. Hates all small rooms; must have windows if not doors open; can never enter a room if the key is on the outside; if she does so must make great effort to breathe. 7. F., 18. Hates caves, ravines, gorges and all narrow places, and is oppressed in every forest so that she cannot draw a long breath. 8. F., 20. Has these symptoms if she sits near a corner,of which she has a great horror. 9. F. 43. Sometimes when shut in aroom I suddenly feel the door is iocked; I feel my breath leaving me; it is the same feeling I once had when sufTering with sore eyes; I would sometimes awake and find them stuck together, and I would leap up in a great panic. 10. M., 16, colored. Most of all fears tQ be shut in; if a door must be locked he must be the one to lock it; " I still feel the same sensations about everything that limits my freedom, and want to shout, like Patrick Henry, ' GJive me liberty or give me death."' 11. F., 20. Can never close a strange door behind her, but will stand and hold or prop it open on some prete2rt; ascribed to being shut in a barn, aged 11. 12. M. A boywas shutin atrunkinplay, and when his mates refused to let him out lost his head with panic, grew desperate, screamed, " I shall die," and ever since dreads all narrow places, lest they should crush him, and is haunted by the fear of being buried alive. 13. F., 26. Every heavy fog oppresses; she fears it will settle closer and nearer and choke her, but if in the house does not have this fear. 14. M., 16. Expects to die by being choked with gas, and goes all around every night to see if it is off. 15. F., 15. When three, first noticed mist, and was terrified, thinkingitaveilGJodhadspread on the earth that would never lift. 16. F., 18. Thinks the sky falling when there is a mist; cannot breathe, and has nausea. 17. F., 17. When awakened before daylight feared the sun would not rise, and prayed and cried she must have light. 18. F., 20. Cannot see anything snake-like without the thought of slimy coils about her neck, squirming and choking. 19. F., 1f. GJypsies are woNst, for they put plasters on your mouth 80 you cannot holler or breathe. 20. F., 17. Has long dreaded warm weather, for fear of suffoca- tion, and every thought of death suggests strangulation. 21. M., 16.

Hardly likes to wear a ring, and will not unless it is very loose; if it sticks the least bit in getting it off she is in a panic; she ¢annot have a medal hung around her neck. Hunger for breath, which starts with the first filling of the lungs after birth, demands room for air, and restriction causes incipient asphy:xia. Slight dyspna predisposes to claustraphobiae states of consciousnesst although any asso- ciation! of apnta and its attendant oversaturation of the blood by oxygen with agoraphobiac symptoms by no means follows. In all these deep lying analogies of sensation, which seem better illustrated in sleep than in waking although with laws common to both, the state of blood, lungs or heart seems to suggest the conceptmore often in dreams, alld the con- verse to be more characteristic of waling. Breathing is a specialized form of skin respiration, and it takes longer to strangle yollng than adult animals, as is probably also the case with mans Some children habitually sleep in closed rooms, with the head under heavy clothing from darkness fears, to the detriment of health, while the fears of this sec- tion may have an opposite eflect, 1, 28. Actual experiences bring out this acute panic in all its terrible intensity, 4, 10, 11.

That a boy's struggle to get his head out of chancery should make liberty more real, 10, or that the thought of tyranny unay cause stifLing, 29, shows the immense range and power of symbolism and how our highest ethical aspirations are those that strike their roots deepest down to sensations perhaps more primitive and basal than anything else modern psychology studies. The impulse of prisoners long confined to " break out " and smash things or their own heads and fists, thevagaries of some ventilation cranks the psychic tortures of being compelled to sit long love of tents instead of walls, mountain fever and its inspiration, and some of the associations of altitude with vast psychic range in I, also belong here. If we could stand a man safely based on a high pillar and gradually shut up his horizon around him like a closing umbrella till he was in a pit, and measure at what point claustraphobiac symptoms were felt, and then reversing the movement let his horizon sink until he was left on a pinnacle, noting the agoraphobiac symptoms passing to fear of heights, we could measure interesting and doubtless new psychological relations. Sully Prudhomme wished the world was not round, but stretched out infinitely and continu- ously with sky and stars; its limitations he found oppressive. In the three groups above I, II and III we may have im- portant factors of space perception. The sensation of falling and gravity fears hardly suggests primitive aquatic life as hovering and Sloating, always associated with modifica- tions of respiration, may do. We have no desire to speculate concerning the relative age of these two groups of sensations. Eorizontal length and breadth orienta- tion may begin with the distinctions between head and tail directions as cephalization and forward motion increased, and then between front and back after the erect position had been assumed. After this latter change, it became almost as much easier to get turned around as it did to fall, so that horizontal orientation was far harder. We require many times the cubic contents of the body in air for respiration hourly? and this, like each of the above elements, may have been a factor in the very early development of the spatial quale. That they are demonstrably a przort to the space of sight, or even touch, is not claimed. Class II may have been coeval with active motor feelings, but the Silurian fucoids do not more completely defy analysis or definition. Touch, motor sensa- 1 See cases and remarks on this fear in Colin Scott's ( ()hildren?s Ideas of Death," AM. JOUR. PSYCEOL., VO1. VII, NO. 1, P. 67 et 8eQ.

If so, then Berkeley, Kant and modern epistemology must makeroom for genetic faJctors of space perception not hith- erto considered, nvhich open up the problem to larger and less formal treatment. IV. FEAR OF WATER. This fear in some unreasonable form is almost universal at some stage of childhood? when it i8 almost sure to be found if questioned for. It has many forms. 1. F., 19. " To be washed always made me stifeen out, my eyes bulge, and I was almost convulsed with fear." 2. F.,17. Hadintensefearof water till eleven; when bathed would scream with fear, and was almost convulsed. 3. F. A girl had horror of being washed almost from birth till three or four; the sight of warm bath water made her kick and scream as if in agony; at one time it was thought to be hatefulness; she began to enjoy dabbling and was not afraid of a pond neat by. 4. One mother found it best to cover the water in a blanket and upon it lower the child gently, to avoid this terror. 5. Another gradually broke it by playing peek-a-boo with two boys with a wet towel, occasionally touching them more and more diverting with stories, etc., till the fear was gradually overcome. 6. F., 16. Says, " How I dreaded water; I would dip the tips of my ffngers, touch each cheek, and then considered my morning ablution done; it was part]y dread of cold, but partly of wet." 7. F., 28. Had for years a sense of great relief when a bath was over, fearing God might somehow strike her dead in it, like a case she had heard of. 8. M., 7. Could never be induced to paddle on the beach or even in a small brook, but said his feet were tender, when the real rea- son was clearly fear. 9. F., 17. Will nine could never pass a stream of water ever 80 small even in the cars without closing her eyes and turning her head. 10. M. A boy of two would always cry and scream whenever he heard water poured in a dish or the noise of a stream.

For years a girl of si2 had such horror of water that she had to cross all streams in the middle of the bridge lest something should come out of the water and drag her into it, and at fourteen had something of the same fear. 12. F., 20. Had an overpowering and sudden fear with a sense of choking on first attempting to go into salt water. 13. F., 19. Had a horror of touching water till once forcibly plunged in, when it began to develop a great charm for her. 14. M. A boy never dreaded it till a man took him in bathing, aged five; since then it has a nervous terror for him. 15. M., 16. Was ducked all over under when eight; has never dared to go in swimming since, and hates the sight of water. 16. M. Fourboys describe longhorror of putting face or head under the water; two are good swimmers, but never ducked the head. 17. M., 11. " If it rains when I am in a boat, I have the horrors." 18. F., 17. Although much in a boat is always haunted by the fear that the bottom will fall out, but can give no cause. 19. F., 16. Daily crosses the ferry, but can never keep her eyes off the life-preservers, and is always planning what to do if the boat sinks. 20. M. A young Englishman, if boating near a large vessel at anchor, or a quay in deep, glassy water, feels an irresistible draw- ing force, or falls under the spell of being pushed to the bottom. 21. F., 18. On small bodies of still, dark fresh water has a strange sensation of depth and lack of her own buoyancy. 22. F. An English woman enjoys bathingwhile the sun shines, but if a cloud darkens the sky and water, is seized with a panic;she used to scream,but nowif alone cannot stand by a still lake or river orthe sea ina dead calm without feeling that she must do one of two things, throw herself in or hasten away; sometimes she loses the power to move; water in motion causes no fear. 23. F., 15. If goes near falls or a rapid stream, she feels a com- pulsion to go alollg nvith the water. 24. F., 26. When it rained hard and streams were high, feared one after another of her friends would be drowned. 25. F. A lady teacher dreads allbridges, especially if she can see the water; sometimes she is powerless to go forward or back. 26. F., 24. " My brother is a sailor, and I cannot bear to see or think of a rough sea.'j 27. F. Five girls report horror of hard rain, lest there come a general flood. 28. F., 18.

Does not trust herself to gaze into deep water, be- cau#e it #eem# #O cool and quiet down there it draws me. 31. Several describe the charm of slowly sinking, floating or lying in the bottom of ponds or seas. 32. The noise of the wind suggests to many the sea sometimes sea-sickne#s, #ometimes visualimages, or some mood of the sea corresponding to or changing with the wind.</page><page sequence="22">168 TTAT.Ts: 33. F., 14. Was for days and nights haunted with the sight of an aquarium, which gave her nightmares and sensations of drown- ing. 34. F., 7. So feared the ocean after her first sight of it that she must always be assured that her bath was not sea water. 35. M., 32. " My boy of sis in bathing fell in eighteen inches of water; instead of making the least eSort to get up he lay there helplessly rolling, and was nearly drowned before I could get to him; he seemed to have easily and at once resigned himself, and showed no fear even afterwards." 36. Some children take pleasure in imagining thvemselves drown- ing; some of them dream it out; in both cases there may be sensa- tions of choking. 37. Others picture the sea as full of beautiful and precious things or beingswhich they long to see, such as corals, jeweled caves, rsymphs, while to others there are unreasonable fears of all con- ceivable monsters. 38. M., 16. Could never put his head under at the seashore without a horrible feeling that he was bidding farewell to land and entering a new element that was " just the same all round the world and held all kinds of things." 39. M., 28. A well experienced swimmer could never go under an instant without a sudden and absurd fear that sharks or other monsters were on the point of seizing him. 40. M., 22. Never swims beyond his depth lest he should be drawn under, or have a sudden impulse to go down forever. 41. F., 43. Fancies she has sensations of drowning in a very hard rain, and sometimes in a thick fog. 42. F., 21. Thinks drowning by far the best way to die, and sometimes is so enamored with the thought of quietly sinking into unknown depths and leaving care and pain that she almost resolves to try it. 43. F. For an English lady drowning always had a poetic charm; she often pictured herseif a corpse floating easily about or drifting upon the shore in artistic places and attitudes, yet always had a horror of bathing except in the tub. 44. F., 20. Always felt she was destined to die by drowning; shunned every possibility of this end and imagined its symptoms. 45. M. Two boys could not skate where water was known to be deep, no matter how many others were there; indeed the more, the greater the danger of a general break-in. 46. F. Alady writes thatherboy of 16, otherwise normal, has micturition, which is associated with such fear that he dreads to urinate, and even to drink water. 47. P., 32. Felt the sea to be a cold, cruel and almost omnipotent but malignant giant. In many cases of young children's drea(l of water, it is sim- ply because it is cold. This was perhaps the case with 1, 2 alld 6 and others. To this their skin is e2rceedingly sensitive, and lack of temperature adjustment either way may easily cause not only discomfort, but pain, and so fear. This, how- ever, can scarcely account for 3, 4, 5, and most of the other cases must have other elements. A ssociation with accidents</page><page sequence="23">169 s STUDY OF FEARS. or with creatures supposed to live in water appears in 7, 1l, 14, 15, 26, 32, 33, perhaps 452 and very likely others where the record does not show it. Eliminating, however, all that can be due to thesetwo causes, cases like 8, 9, 12, 13, as they stand, are less clear, and those like 16, 17, 18, 19, sug- gest other elements, while the " drawing 2? factor in 20, 21, 22, 23, 29, 30, 31, 40, suggests the doctrine of imperative ideas, which here, however, as so often, needs more explana- tion than it gives. Still other elements appear in 28, 35, 42, 43. The smother factor, one of the deepest roots of horror, here, too, is ofterl a form of physiological resonance which rain, clouds, or everl fog may evoke, or indeed dampness in the air. The specific gravity of water takes the jerkirless out of the movements and tends to slow dowrl or rest all but passive motions, arld in states of heat and fatigue its cool- ness and softness have great charm. Drowrling has always been a favorite form of suicide, especially for women. Prose arld poetry have described both these fascinations, and peo- pled sea and stream with mythic creatures, both captivating and terrifying. Deducting all fairly due to individual experience, is there in these phobophillic feelings toward water any hereditary, race remnante This questiorl is both as inevitable and as unanswerable here as is the problem of innateness versus em- piricism irl other fields. The data are celtainly unsatisfac- tory, although full of suggestiv?ness. For orle I incline to the view that it would be well for psychologists to postulate purely instinctive vestiges, which originated somewhere since the time when our remote ancestors left the sea, ceased to be amphibious and made the land their home. Do we not dis- honor the soul by thinking it less comples or less freighted with memerltoes of its earlier stages of development than the body which, in the amniotic fluid medium, unfolds its earlier prenatal stages like a fish, and carries traces of the primitive gill-slits through adult lifet As these latter traces are some- times hypertrophied in teratological forms, so the o]d charm and the old fear of water may come to the very fore- ground of consciousness irl exceptional cases. It is at any rate conceivable that the influence of the predominant pro- portion of time an(l of volume of life that has leen lived aquaticall sr since its dawn should still make itself felt in the soul,and should find e2zpression especially in poetry,both more emotional and mol e arcbhaic than prose, in the faint traces of struggle between fear and love oceasionally seen here. Some- time, perhaps in the Permian age of the great amphibia, or at any rate betweerl Devonian and carboniferous age of fishes and the gigantic reptiles of the triassic and jura, and thus at</page><page sequence="24">170 HAJ,T.: any rate very long after the chief features of the vertebrate type were established, the modes of movement, breathing, feeding and the senses of equilibrium, orientation, the actiorl of all the special senses, etc., were more or less radically changed. But why should the older and deeper types of psychic activity be assumed to have had a reconstruction any more obliterative of the past than the bodys The simplest of all hypotheses, and therefore the view that may fairly claim that the burden of proof should rest with any other less ultimate one, seems to me something as follows: Deepest of all the feelings for water is the old love, traces of which still survive and crop out in some features of its charm and drawing power, when it seems so cool, soft, restful, buoy- ant, embracing and transparent. Returns to another syllabus will show what an unaccountable passion it is for children to see, feel, paddle in, play with or sail on water. Theforce and depth of this passion, after eliminating all influences in this direction due to the experience of the individual child, and others of recent philogenic origin, strongly suggest the earlier and far longer life in the sea. Ilater, after land developed to continental dimensions, and amphibian habits gave way to conditions that established life permanently on land, the higher animals swam less and less, and at length water became (langerous in proportion to this loss of power. Those best adapted to land were at greatest disadvaxltage in water, and thus a fear of it became chronic and very strong because it must control the old love. Those that feared water most had an advantage in survival at a certain stage over those less timid. Howseverethis discipline of weaning from the old home of all life, some childish fears like these above still show. The thought of return to the old element is some- times suddenly reinforced to the intensity of an imperative and uncontrollable impulse by the recrudescence of the archaic element, like an eruption forcing through in dyke or fissure where the superposed strata are thin or not conformable. Female suicides prefer drowning as a mode of death more often than men, because the female organization is more con- servative of archaic influences than the male; the old love is stronger relatively to the old fear in them. But thirdly, in all normal souls the two are adjusted harmoniously, so that all the pleasure of the one and all the safety of the other are combined the fear and danger now adding a new charm. It should perhaps be added here that hydrophobia seems likely to be dropped from modern medical literature as the designation of a central feature of a symptom group. Real fear of water as such, as distinct from fear of other bright things or more solid ingesta, probably does not esist except</page><page sequence="25">s STUDY OF FEARS. 171 in hysterical and pseudo-cases.

FE A RS OF WIND. 1. 31., 1 year, 8 months. Every time the wind whistled or made any kind of noise would run to his mother's lap. 2. F., 2. Is always strangely excited when the wind blows; wants to cuddle away and be quiet somewhere. 3. M., 16. During all my childhood nothing frightened me like wind; to subdue me they only needed to say the word. 4. F., 18. Whenthe wind moaned I always said to myself it is like a mother weeping for her dead baby. 5. F., 19. Has always been distressed and depressed by every sound of wind or rustling of leaves. 6. F., 40. The wind at night always seemed like dogs growling, and she would lie awake fancying them outside. 7. F., 22. " To be out in a violent wind only makes me cross and very irritable, but its howling, especially at night, has always been e2rtremely depressing; I have no definite fear, but it brings to mind many possible and impossible disasters, and makes me sad and blue." 8. F., 28. Is nervous and restless whenever she hears the wind in the trees; "it requires all my will power to make myself sit still and continue myworkinstead of roaming around the house like a restless spirit; any kind of storms without wind do not trouble me." 9. F., 17. Always dreaded wind, but trembles less than for- merly. " Never fail to awake at night if it increases; I cannot lie still; wring my hauds- run to another room and pace the floor un- til the wind has cease." lo. F. A high wind makes a refined lady feel herself at sea; makes her feel the rocking motion of the waves and causes nau- sea. 11. F., 17. " The least wind terrifies me lest trees or limbs should fall, if I am out I keep the e2ract middle of the road, or, if possi- ble, with blue sky above me." 12. F., 19. Heard her mother say as a shower was coming up, 4' We shall have a gust of wind; " she had never heard the word gust before, and it long filled her with terror, and was associated with wind. 13. F., 43. " As a girl I was always unhappy in e2ract propor- tion to the strength of the wind, and used to watch the movements ofthe boughs of the trees .to estimate its intensity; a sudden or even gradual crescendo in the noise of the leaves still starts up my heart; I feared every lightbreeze would increase into a gale; every morning on waking my first thought is of the wind, and I often compare its intensity hour by hour; I have never experienced any really dangerous wind." 14. F., 24. Has great horror of wind, and studies the clouds in- cessantly to infer their direction and intensity.</page><page sequence="26">172 HA6JT. 15. F., 4. Fears the wind will blow her or her friends away. 16. M., 46. Distant machinery, cars, thunder, surf or deep organ notes sometimes suddenly suggest wind of awful power that could ssveep sea, land, and earth itself away; some of the "ele- mental nzotives " in Wagner's Irilogy are intolerably tragic. 17. F., 20. It is the piping and whistling of the wind that give her the fidgets, and sometimes she fancies it is a monster breathing. 18. F., 17. Used to think armies were fighting when there was a gale. 19. M., 28. Sometimes fears the earth may be swept clean, and even that the ultimate forces of nature may break out and every- thing be reduced to chaos. 20. M., 9 Wind was Gkod's wrath; the harder it blew the more angry He was. 21. F., 18. Used to feel there were wild men in the wind scream- ing to each other, or a lot of elves frollicking or playing hide-and- seek. 22. F., 18. Used often to fancy she heard the wind say such words as: I am coming; I will push you over, etc. Often, as in other of our returns not included above this fear is directly caused by experiencing, seeing or reading of the havoc of high winds, gales at sea, etc., and much is due to the close association with storm and thunder. Noise has wonderful power over the emotions of childhood, especially during all the plastic inceptive stages of language, and cre- ates all kinds of scenes and imagery on the principle illus- trated in descriptive programme music. The wind starts up, rattling, roaring, sighing, all kinds of sounds suggesting animals, 6; monsters, 17; enginery, 16; battles, 18; the sea in all its moods, 10; pathetic scenes, 4; univer- sal dissolution, 19. It is the bandmaster of the many membered orchestra of nature' s music, and can play upon almost the whole gamut of ollr emotional life. The pan pipe of its iEolian whistling needed only to be fretted with scale and tonality to create music, the power to compose and appreciate which it had done so much to make. Yet with all its power it is invisible. More per- haps than any or all things else, it created in primitive con- sciousuess the unseen spiritual world. Where things tran- scendent would have been but for the wind, the etymology of words like spirit, soul, thought, mind, etc., in many lan- guages savage and civili7ed suggests. It is the child's first and chief teacher in that school where all the causes that are real enough to bring heat, cold, sunshine, cloud, rain, de- struction, change of mood, as if by a new indwelling person- ality, and which no eye yet ever saw, are learned. Its changes are incessant in intensity and direction, follow no khown law, yet are as close to us as our own pulses, and as in nervous</page><page sequence="27">173 A STUDY OF FE A RS. states we listen intent on its " what next," ollr very breath is bated as if even its coming and going was in the power of this mysterious agent. Living at the bottom of a great sea of air, the changing pressure of which affected their blood and muscle tension, and even knee-jerk, it is no wonder that primitive men didnot know there was such a thing as air itself when still, although personifying wind in many forms. We may fancy, if we like, that on some such theory as, e. g., DIach's of hereditary, or a form of memory by direct contin- uity of molecular vibration in cells or their elements (Weiss- mann' s biophors, Wisuer' s plasomes, de Vries' pangens, Nageli's micellae, etc.), or in any other less material way the present reactions of childish and adolescent souls, or of spe cially sensitized geniuses, or neuroties, still bear some trace or scar of the more dreadful storms of the long age of diluvial man or even of the older sea, which still make our sou]s bet- ter resonators to bring out some of the wind eflects in the above cases, provided we never for a moment forget that seven logical proofs are made of radically different stuff. All that anyone can claim is that we have here new points of view? with an interestand suggestiveness all their own, the stimullls of which, whatever it is, we ought to utilize to the utmost in stlldying these groups of ancient, all-conditioning, but in adult life mostly effaced and heretofore strangely neg- lected experiences. Anemophobisc souls are Golus caves, from which imaginary winds that threaten to sweep away earth, sea and heavens may still be loosed. VI. FEARS OF CELESTI A L OBJECTS. In this section I have selected only a very few typical fear cases from over a thousand returns illustrating the feelings of children toward sky, cloud, heavenly bodies, weather, etc., as follows: 1. F., 17. When 12 saw a picture of a fierce clown betsveen the cloud#;often imagined #he #aw him afterward# in the #ky,and could even trace hi# outline# in the #tar#, wa# greatly terrified, but never told. 2. F., 16. Alway# shudder# when looking at cloud#; #he u#ed to trace outline# of terrible mon#ter#, ha# st,ill the same feeling even when looking atpicture# of cloud#; another used often to run in from play in terror from cloud-#hapes; #he would watch their changing form# with breathless fear. 3. F.,19. Usedtotraceeachofthefollowing animal# in cloud- forms, cows, dog#, hor#e#, reindeer#, cats, rats, pig#, goat#, lion#, camel#, etc., when #he wa# 9; she fancied great animal# were #ome- how up there, and often had #hudder# of fear; this intere#t made the #cientific #tudy of cloud form# a fa#cination later.</page><page sequence="28">174 HAT.T. 4. F., 16. Ha# not yet got over #trong fear that heavy, low hanging cloud# will fall; #he u#ed to think #ome of them bea#ts of prey and mythological mon#ter#. 5. F.7 18. Had a horror of cloud# that were #tacked or piled, one above another; if they were black #he feared they would bur#t and #pread de#truction; #he could never endure cloud# directly overhead. 6. F., 27. If cloud# were low felt #mothery. 7. F., 19. Long thought cloud# took the form of coming event#, one7 e. g.7 looked like a volcano, and for day# #he expected one would bur#t forth from a certain hill near by. 8. M., b. I# frightensd at every little cloud; he always watches the #ky, and if he #ee# one coming over run# in. 9. F., 22. I dreaded #harply formed cloud#, for I #uppo#ed if they bur#t it would rain fire. 10. F., 17. Wa# for #ome year# alway# on the lookout for funny #haped little cloud#; any jag downward #he thought a cyclone. 11. F., 6. For month# had a horror of cloud#, and wa# haunted with the fear of rain drop#; when they fell #he wa# alway# gloomy and in terror. 12. F., 7. Ead heard of the flood, and if it rained hard on the second day would cry and fear the vrorld would be dromrned. i13. F., 18. Once #aw the crucifision scene in the cloud#. 14. F., 21. U#ed to #ee angel# and chariots, group# of heavenly being#. 15. F., 23. U#ed to #ee the face of her dead mother #haped in a cloud. 16. F., 26. U#ed to #ee the #cene# of nearly all the #torie# she read pictured in the cloud#, e#pecially if they were terrible. 17. F., 17. U#ed to be greatly elatedby bright cloud color#, and filled with awe if they were gloomy or #ad colored. 18. F., 8. U#ed to #ee all the Bible pictures in the clouds, and thought the pretty one# God'# clothe#. 19. F., 19. Cloud# alway# #ugge#ted the next world, she thought them very near it. 20. F1., 22. U#ed to think the motion of the tree# made the wind, and the wind herded the cloud# like a #hepherd. 21. M., 11. Anything unu#ual in the cloud# made him fear the end of the world; it wa# a Bible " #ign." 22. F. A lady recall# a cloud #he thought a mythological mon- #ter, and another #he thought the head of #atan, and ha# had sev- eral other experience# with individual clouds which #he will never forget. 23. F., 18. Often u#ed to #ee mountain#, sea and land#cape# in the cloud#, but they #eemed uncanny, and the #cene# of dire evellt#. 24. F., 16. U#ed to get dizzy and nau#eated watching the moon running under the cloud#. 25. F., 21. Long had great fear of heavenly bodie#, yet wa# fa#- cinated by them; would gaze long at the #tar#, " I would over- whelmingly realize my own in#ignificance and the power of God; I would want to pray to be better, but felt my#elf of too little conse- quence to be noticed; #tar gazing ha# improved my behavior."</page><page sequence="29">175 X STUDY OF FEARS. 26. M., 23. " Had mental tertor of a yellow #ky, cloud# or light; red in the heavens #ugge#t# blood and something terrible to come; a college profe##or, a# a child, had horror of red #un#et#, " the #UR seemed coming down to the earth to #et it on fire." 27. F., 21. Onhearing of the planet# and their path#, devel- oped a chroniepanic thatthey might get off their track# and hit eachother, e#pecially that the earth would run into the #un; "it made me a better girl." 28. F. A high #chool teacher never feared cele#tial phenomena except northern light#, the#e #till give her an indefinable feeling of horror, and #he never #ee# them without #hivering alld #haking. 29.

F., 7. Cried withalarmthinking some one had blown out the #un. 34. F., 18.

Loved to watch the moon, but could never do 80 alone, fearing the real man there might cotne down and carry her off; #he #till ha# thi# fear. 38. F., 30. While hearing #torie# on the verandah one night a#; a girl, #aw the moon break out and #uddenly tint everything with #ilver; thi#, #he thought, is the end of the world, even yet she can- not #ee the moon break through a rift in the clouds without some fear. 39.

Very warm weather #ugge#t# to F. 19 that the element# may melt with fervent heat. Here again we find many falling fears. Sky, clouds, sun, moon, rainbow, meteors, comets, balls of fire, the man in the moon, the monsters of the constellations may drop on us, knock things off the earth or crush it, 4, 5, 29, 30, 34, 37, 39, 40, 41, 49; there may be collisions, 27, 34; or explosions, 5, 9; heavenly visitors, guests from other planets1 51; cloud monsters or demons, 1, 2, 22, 40; or beasts of prey may arrive. The future is revealed, 7, 26;; the terrors of the judgment or the nest world are foreshown, 19, 21, 31, 49; cyclones are imagined, 10; the northern lights strike terror, 28, 50; cold weather or snow suggest the freezing up or snowing under of all things, 47 ;1 heat, that all things will dry up or melt, 52; rain, that floods impend, 12, or yet more superstitious terrors, 11, 45; Bible scenes are repro- duced in the clouds, 13, 14, 18, 22; the sun, 33, 34t 27, 26, 25; the moon, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43; shadows, 44; bright colors, 17, 26, 46; twilight, 48; to-day nothing of wind and thunder treated elsewhere, become objects of special fear. We know too little of the eiiects of weather upon psychic states.2 Each season predisposes to certain diseases, and evento its onFn immoralities, and has a strong eflect on re- current and circular forms of mental alieniation.

Good weather increases muscular and arterial tonicity and facilitates di- gestion. Eot and cold, wet and dry, darls and light, and perhaps electrical tension play upon moods, affect studies and discipline in school, trade and business enterprise, con- trol agriculture and many industries, modify the conduct of animals till its variations are utilized as weather signs, is the first topicof conversation among all races, and so great is human interest in it that a body of weather lore has been de- veloped the comparison of which with modern meteorology affords one of the most instructive of all the many parallels between folk-lore and science. Many hymns, from the Dies Irse down show how commonly divine wrath, and even the terrors of the judgment are conceived and described as sim- ply awful weather. The last revision of the Episcopal prayer book contains weather prayers. Children's souls still show abundant traces of the original psychoplasm out of which primitive man created the many fairy or demonial beings seen in cloud, fog and all the phenomena of day and night. Earth is fixed and solid, but the heavens are a thea- tre of incessant changes, controlled by no known law, and which seem the direct expressions of the feelings of personal beings toward man. Just as in antiquity and down to Co- lumbus it was a very common view, that by persistent sail- ing or traveling men could reach the sky and heavenly bodies which were connected with the earth, as then known, by direct physical continuity, so to many a child not only is this true, but hell is hot weather intensified to a fiery stage, and heaven is people unusually fine and events unusually magnifi- cent, set in sunset hues and skyey brightness increased, and all reached by climbing sacred mountains, real or imaginary. Now, no state even remotely like this, has prevailed sincethe nebulous age, when the whole solar system was simply cos- mic weather. But e:ttremes from the laval heat to the cold of the glacial period, the storms and fioods of cataclysmal force that have prevailed since the Silurian age, when life became svell established here, and especially those convulsions which broke the continuity of the successive geologic periods, lethal elements that have entered so densely into the composition of the atmosphere, foods of subsidence and emergence, thunder, wind and storms of inconceivable vio- lence, all these toned down to a mildness that makes pres- ent conditions of life possible, fised in bounds by {ate con- stitute what we now call weather. Hence from the standpoint of the new conceptions of soul thatnow seem imminent it appears to me not surpris-</page><page sequence="32">ing, but rather in accord with hypothesese we must assume, formulate and test that in this class of childish fears we still have echoes of the grander and mors awful phenomena of primaeval weather, when even clouds were denser, and which perhaps first suggested such old traditions as the firmament of Genesis the upper earth of Plato and Dante and many others reminiscent of a time when all present changes had a far widerrange. If we knew the whole history of weather it might appear that some children and adults who suffer from these fears, illustrate stages of arrest in the develop- ment of inhibitory powers which reveal psycho-neural ele- ments older and less controlled within bounds than our present meteorological variations. To such individuals no bows of promise give surcease of dread '4 Elemental " music like some of Wagner's, seems to work bywaking and stirring these old echoes, which motives like e. g., the pastoral sym- phony allay. Far above the realm of flas in our atmosphere is the heaven of blue sky, of fised eternal stars, and of the pilgrim sun and moon in the divinity of which Socrates in ths Apology intimates that all WiS8 men must believe, and to which, as a later paper will show so many Christian children still pray. iEIere for unknown generations men have read their fate as astrologists still do. Assuming that every plant had its planet and each planet its plant, the doctrine of sig- natures at the hands of Cardanus and the herbalists still controls, or at least modifies the therapeutic ileas of the vast majority of mankind. The more we know of children's drawingsl and conceptions of form the more inevitable W8 see for childish savage man was the development of constel- lations out of star-points, which like cloud forms have done so much to lay deep the conviction of a vast superstitious realmJabove,- rank with life. TheMuller-Cos: idea of primi- tive Aryan man shut up in valleys by mountains he rarely crossed, with no political, industrial or other occupation for his thoughts, inevitably turning the freshest and most vigor- ous of minds to the celestial vault as the only field of changs and interest with an eagerness and zest we cannot conceive, and evolving the roots of the myths of all Aryan races in the personification of dawn, storms, sunset, and deseribing in long epics, the prototypes of classic theology, the battle of day and night, the lIercules labors of the sun, his fight with cloud monsters, and the romances of the gentle moon, etc., finds some slight confirmation in the filmy Antage shown in the above ' See " A Study of Children's Drawings in the Early Years,t' Her- man T.

Just as glacial action after making the landscapes and soils of the later quaternary age and leaving its mementoes in vast bowlders and moraines has shrunk to the present polar ice-cap or retreated to high mountains where all its con- tinent-shaping phenomena can still be observed on a small scale, so this, like other great primal psychisms, after shap- ing and basing man's deepest and all conditioning instincts, has slowly retreated toward ineffective infancy, where in rudimentary and transient forms we may still study these " vague snatches of IJranian antiphone." The heavens are also the chief and best tabuta rasa for the projection of all the entoptic phenomena of the primitive men once so vivid, that like those of the modern savage, they may be mistaken for objects of sense and the VisiOIlS of ec- staties, the strongest of which do not need darkness. By far the most of the old deities and demons are powers of the air or sky where Jove ruled. Besides " above " is so vast and so open on all sides that, although the dangers are small from aIly one point or source, the possible ones from all are so many and the superstitions that literally stand over us have such ad- vantage of position as well as locomotion, that all in all it is no wonder that astral fears seem hardly less deep seated than the foundations of the religious nature, are so easilzr aroused even to intensity, and are so manifold. VII. FE A R OF FIRE: PYROPEOBIA. 1. F., 16. I used to regard fire as a sort of demon, the flames being his tongues, which licked up everything within reach, and he seemed always trying to get more in his grasp. 2. M., 18. One of the grandest sizhts is a big fire there is an awful feeling in seeing its power; I o not know whether I love or fear great conflagrations most. 3. M., 91. Is always awakened by fire bells, and can never sleep until the return is rung; all through his boyhood he was nervous, excited, and could not sit still at school if he could not run to every fire; " a fire is such a magnificent sight; I always secretly sympa- thized with the fire rather than with the firemen, and wanted it to blaze higher and spread; had it been my father's house I should have had an undertone of the same feeling, though I should, no doubt, have fought it with all my might; all this while I have grown almost morbidly cautious about sparks and matches." 4. F., 41. " I dread so many coming ills that I often used to ask myself, s What is the good of living nvith such dreadful things liable to happen at any moment?' My chief dread is fire, due largely to experience; I so dread it that I cannot bear the thought of being cremated, although I know that is the best way, because I know mybodywouldfeelthefirethough insensible to everything else; 3</page><page sequence="34">180 WAT,T. when I read of people badly burned I imagine the pain and wonder how they can bear it." B. F., 18. With no fire experiences, for years had spells of lying awake and dreading it; her pet terror, which often got into her dreams, was being obliged to jump and feeling the awful sensation of falling. 6. F., 18. Must always make a tour of the house to see if there is fire if she awakes at night. 7. F. 17. The worst fear is that she will get her hair on fire; she cannot bear to see much less use a match, but can handle a lighted lamp. 8. F. 1B. Still takes her dolls to bed every night so as to rescue them if there should be a fire. 9.

When 13wa# haunted for weeks by the line of a well known hymn, " and when a raging fever burns," etc,, and felt many symptoms, and thought how dreadful hell fire mu#t feel, Only five of our case# report any actual experiences with con- {lagrations, being burned or knowing other# to have been. Mild pyro-phobia appears in the caution of 3 about sparks and matches, in tours of the house, 6, 9, 11; dread of every bright fire, 18; of the noise of lighting a match, 19, or the sightof it, 7; of the word fire, 12; the sound of crackling or the sight of smoke from a chimney is feared, and may even arouse the sense of smell, 11. This dread of loss by fire is offset by or struggles with the slight pyro-mania of 3, 13, and perhaps 2 and 9. Other fears may start by suggestion from the physi- cal sensations of heat, 24, 2S, 16, or imaginary burns, 4, 7, 21. It may be associated with wind, 9, 10; with dread of jumping and falling, 3; with hell and judgment, 23, 25; hot weather, 16; fire bells may announce the final conflagration of all things, 15; fire may rain from above, 17; or come up out of the fiery centre of the earth, 16; or even brea!s forth from our own bodies, 24. Unlike many land animals and amphibia man neither hibernates nor aestivates, and unlike so-called cold-blooded fishes, whose body temperature ranges through nearly as many degrees as separate the summer from the winter temperatlle of water, even the surface of man's body follows but very slightly the thermal changes of the atmosphere. Slight as are the normal changes of the temperature of human bodies, life in colder latitudes, clothing, indoor life and artificial heat have made it very sensitive independently of the hot and cold spots. But, as even these latter suggest, man's psychic states are profoundly modified by temperature. All human affection and ideals languish and almost die at 90° F., and as if thermal effects resisted by the body vented themselves upon the soul, not only love and temper, but will, fancy, mor- ality and all the racial differences that separate arctic from equatorial man, so superficial in the soma, so deep in the psyche, can be in part measured by the annual average read- ings of the thermometer. Since the culture heroes taught man the control of fire, cooking has not only established the hearth as the centre of domesticity, but enlarged man's dietary and economized di- gestive energy for other uses, and made metals plastic forthe arts. Traces of the charm of these old associations are abundant in child-life, as other returns show. Just to idly gaze at fire now starts dreamy reveries, veined through which are traces of very primeval yet earnest thinking. It stimulates memory and story. The very play of form and</page><page sequence="36">182 HATjT: color half hypnotizes and autonomizes the mind,and as we see solid matter volatilize to smoke there seems some mysterious power within and behind it all.

In children too, as still other returus show, all this and more is still seen only fuller and richer than history preserves it. 13arly man often conceived himself as between volcanic fires below and sun, stars, lightaing and burning empyrean above, and lIeraclitus, working up many ancient and scat tered philosophemes, taught all things to be fire in various stages of estinction, here burning hot, then smouldering, and the world alternating between the reduction of all things to pure fire and its a,lmost utter extinction in cosmic death. The three stages of ice, wa,ter a,nd steam were for him, no doubt, as formative a, concept as we have lately been told it was for Hegel' s idea of qua,lity subla,ting itself into quantity.

FEAR Ok D A RENESS. This extremely comples group of fears may be sampled as follows: 1. M., 16. Always dreaded shadows, and feared to go up stairs or on the street where they were. 2. M., 15. When younger used to fall into panic at shadows, and would run out of breath to get away from it. 3. M., 6. Was found transfixed with fear athis shadow on the window, thinking it an Indian outside. 4. F., 44. Used to play all day in an attic, but as daylight faded the shadows seemed horrible forms, about which she developed fear images that made the room intolerable later. 6. M., 22. Is, and always has been gloomy, depressed and timid in a forest, his thoughts dwell on every gloomy possibility; the company, even of a dog, dispels it all. 6. M., 14. Always thinks something moves in the twilight; whether within doors or without he often detects motion. 7. F., from 10 to 14. Used to dread a certain window in her house, which she never could pass after sunset without feeling that a hand was reaching in to grab her, or that she saw a face peering in. 8 F., 9. Can never sit on herpiazza at night without hugging up to and holding some one from fear. 9. F., 27. Never goes through any darkish place without look- ing behind, and often thinks she sees shadowy, flitting forms. 10. F., 22. The cedar trees near by looked like men and were always fancied to be such; she can never go into a dark room with- out feeling chills and quivers, and then flushing. 11. F., 18. At the age of 8 often had to pass a row of trees after dark; as she approached each tree she saw in it a man's hat, arm or leg, and hurried past, only to repeat this at every tree. 12. F., 19. Used to pass papa's corn field after dark where were two scarecrows, made of coats on sticks; she saw them put up, and pas#edthem daily without fear, but at night could never avoid a panic, and always ran past them. 13. F., 19. Always pretended to be fearless of the dark, and would often go up stairs without a light but if she touched a bufalo robe always had to scream with fear till some one came to her re- lief. 14. F., 17. Can enter a dark place with composure, but the mo- ment she turns her back to come out she has the horrors, must gen- erally run, and sometimes scream. 15. F., 17. Can never trustherself to look behind in the dark, and must always be the first to enter the house. 16. M., 16. Used to be a coward in the dark, but was cured by being often frightened. 17. M., 19. Ascribes his cure to never being frightened and never forcing himself to go where he was afraid to go.</page><page sequence="38">184 HALL: 18. F., 30. When 13was frightened by her cousin, who jumped out at her in a sheet, she fell down stairs into consulsions, and ever since has horrors of everything white in dark places. 19. F. A young English woman never feared actual ghosts, but has dread of nameless, shapeless somethings in all woods, dark corners, under beds, especially behind her in narrow places, when coming down stairs, etc.; on fetching things from a dark room she comes down the first flight slowly with every muscle tense, dashes down the second, bangs and must often lock the door behind her. 20. F., 17. Used to sit by the window nights and wonder how it was in the woods out opposite, her mind would imagine all sorts of horror# there till she was all goose flesh. 21. F., 27. Can go into a dark room if she tiptoes 80 as not to hear her own footsteps, and if the floor does not creak, but always shudders from fear of something near and about to touch her. 22. F., 17. In a dark room feels some one looking at her from the corners and pursuing from just behind. 23. F., 19. Always strains her eyes to see things, often fancies she does, then stands perfectly still and gets hot and prickly. 24. F. An English woman has the idea of a long hand stretched out to seize her, often imagines herself actually touched pictures "indescribable evil personages " each side of a long, aark stair case, and her joy at seeing light again is very vivid. 25. F.l 34. Must always sleep with a light in her room, or else sees terrsble faces. 26. F., 67. Can never enter her bed room without being assured that the gas burned brightly there all the evening. 27. F., 19. Pictures horrid forms if there is the least noise at night, and her face i8 beaded with perspiration. 28. F., 18. The great shadow over all her early life was the dread of the moment her mothershould kiss her good night aIld leave her alone in the dark; she lay tense and rigid, held her breath to listen with open mouth, smothered herself uxIder the clothes, with which her head must always be covered, fancied forms bending over her, often awoke with her heart pounding and a sense of dropping through the air, flying or falling backward, feeling quivery for hours; she now vows "I will always put my whole foot on the stairs." 29. F., 20. Always looked in every crevice of her room before goingto bed but one night, five years ago found a broom her brothers hazi dressed alld placed behind the aoor, the shock robbed her of all control, and for months she would laugh and cry with- out occasion, and has not yet got over it. 30. M., 16. Used to kneel by the bed and say the Lord's prayer but gradually grew 80 afraid that something under Ghe bed would grab him by the legs that he gave up praying. 31. F., 21. Had the habit of holding her breath and breathingas little as possible in bed, because she read of a man who saved his life by doing this when a lion was smelling of him and thought that by thus feigning death she might escape any monsters in the room. 32. F., 18. Used to eye the foot board, e2rpecting every instant to see hand, claw or other awful shape, reach over it and grasp her foot.</page><page sequence="39">s STUDY OF FE A RS. 185 33. F.

F., 14. Imagines dreadful men standing in the doorway and coming nearer till " she cannot stand it, but must break out with something." 35. M., 14. " Most every night when I get most asleep I think I see something dark looking at me; sometimes I cover my head and seem to say, you can't get me now old fellow; often mother calls out and think# I am fighting by the way I punch the wall and hol- ler like #ome one wa# choking me." 36. ^f., 16.

F. An Engli#h lady teacher write# a# a child " I had a strange idea of #afety when I wa# alone in Ahe dark; I alway# im- agined that at each corner of my bed there wa# a lion, who was al- way# on the alert to fight with the ceaseless number of tigers and snakes which I fancied were prowling up stairs all night; 80 long as the lions were there I felt safe, but if I thought one disappeared I would lie awake in dreadful fear that the others would not be enough to struggle with the tigers. 38. M., 16. From about 8 to 10 " had a foolish idea that bears inhabited the dark room of our house at night; no one could argue me out of it. 39. M., 14. At 8 or 9 I was afraid of the dark and of imaginary beings which I calledBos and Boos;" now I have not the slightest fear of eitherN I can go to bed without a light; I conquered these fears by puttlng my trust in Divine Providence. 40. F., 35. If she must go out after dark had to cling to the door latch until she had formally committed herself to God. 41. F., 19. When a child on going to bed would gaze at the dark ceiling until suddenly little black figures appeared jumping about between it and the bed; at first they were watched with pleasure but as they increased to thousands she would grow frightened, hold her breath, scream and rush out. 42. F. One woman writes that all her manifold spiritual fear# sprang from one absorbing terror-darlr; now she fears, she knows notwhat; as a child she feared a mysterious, invisible, but very real spirit she and her sister had manufactured in the nursery, and called the horrid man he and his awful threats became 80 terrible that they were forbidden to ever mention his name, 80 he was called H. M.; when alone near dark the three children would sit dos-a-dos in the middle of the nursery,that one might watch the door, one the chimneygrand one the window, lest H.

M., 19. Has no definite fears, but whenever it gets dark ha# short and oppressed breathing. 44. F., 23. Till 8 never went down cellar even by day; till lS never dared to go to the barn after dark; till 15 could never go to bed in the dark;till 17 never could step over to the ne2rt neighbor's, to do each of these for the first time was an epoch. 45. Thirty-four mothers in Miss Marsh's club, Detroit, discussed this topic; most agreed thatup to eight or nine boys feared the dark more than girls, that parents were often to ilame, but that it wa# unwise to try to break up this fear by forced methods. In some of the strangest of these cases 27, 32, 34, 36, 35, 38, and even 41, it is l?ossible that dreams have helped to give form or intensity. Often the dreaded object is definite and recurrent, as in these same cases and 37; often it may be one of several, and is ill defined, 9, 19, 26, 31, 32. Some- thing is almost seen, 23, 27; or it has faded a little, but the fear of a fear, 42, 5, 8, 10; so that one dare not look behind, 14, 15; fright curesone of timidity, 16, but makes others worse, 17, 18; touch is fancied, Sl, 23; especially in the form of being grabbed, 7, 28, 31, 32; animals, 13, 36, 37, 38; eyes, 22, or faces, 7, 24, are feared. Fright stops the breath, 27, 30; makes one run, 2; paralyzes another, 3; may restrict many normal activities of life, 43, leave a permanent scar, 18, 27, 28, 41; be overcome by the thought of God. Even forest gloom or shadows suffice to excite them. The cases above give but a faint idea of the intense alld manifold fears of every kind of monster, accident, dreadful men, or worse ghosts that prey upon ahildhood in the dark. Only two cases in all our returns report complete esemption from this fear. Often in the best born and most carefully shielded and healthy children, they break out suddenly on the slightest suggestion or none at all, and overwhelm all control, predis- pose to or actually cause deep-seated nervous disorders. Of the natural history of sleep we know very little. lIodge and Aikinsl found amcebae as active by night as by day, but Loeb, Graber and Vierworn found very low forms of life stimulatednot only ky light and heat, but often by color. Through most realms of life the withdrawal of the sun's in- fluence tends to repose and sleep. Twilight subdlles activity, suggests home and friends, and often thoughts of death. Darkness checks motion because most volitional acts need light, and are controlled by the eye. Blind children on com- ing to asylums often have very low muscular development because they have followed the inclinatioll of all with grave eye defects to move about but little, till the motor elements I 4; The Daily Life of a Protozoan." AM. JOUR. 0F P#YCH., VI, P. 524. 186 HAT.T.</page><page sequence="41">are sometimes hopelessly atrophied. In closing the eye gate, too, darkness shuts off the main currexlt of stimuli to psychic activity. This has a profound influence on arterial and mus- cular texlsion, and upon the time and vividness of psychic processes, as experiments show. This is far more the case with children, because their psychic activities are more closely bound up with sense properties than are those of adults. Darkness removes the stimulus to hold the eyelids open, and also suggests closing them, and this suggests sleep, which state the eye is the first of the senses to enter. Exceptions to this general rule, that darkness tends to sleep, are many, but nocturnal habits in animals must be and often can be e2rplained as must the development of the " evening habit J among men. First, the eye itself often re- sists the abeyance of its function which darkness urges. Children strain theeyes to see in twilight,, and even inky blackness, till perhapsdarknessis reified as if it could be felt or cut, or the " big dark, out of doors J seems as if it would swallow them like a monster, and the little dark within becomes close and smothery. Entoptic objects and processes are projected, and like all faint outlines or points may be grouped into a11 kinds of things, especially if the sensation of stillness. often no less irksome and active, is ever so little broken. In the excitement of children at early lamplighting, the just begun rest of the visual ares is suddenly broken, resistance to it succeeds; and in the habitual eye rubbing of "light hunger," so common among the blind, the nearest stimuli are applied, but in vain. Shut ofE from light and resisting sleep, visual images may come out all the clearer as we close the eyes to think hard. At first in the young these are not far from after-images. It is in darkness without sleep that the imagination slowly learns to take its first steps alone, and develops its first pic- tures in visual terms upon the canvas of darkness. From many points of view, aesthetic, moral, hygienic, we can hardl.y overestimate the evolutionary and pedagogic value of the early stages of acquaintance with darkness. I suspect that the age when this fear is greatest will be found to be about the same as the interesting nascent period of eye- mindedness; (five to seven, aftex which age children be- coming blind always continue to think in visual terms, but cease to do so if made blind beforel). Whether faint images seem stronger because not contrasted nvith present sight, or energy, because shut ofl from optical processes, becomes 1 J. Jastrow, New Princeton Review, Jan., 1888. Also, }leermann# cla8sic treatise. 187 s STUDY OF FEARS.</page><page sequence="42">188 HAJ.T. greater elsewhere by the law of kinetic equivalents, or both, is unknown. Normal vision, too, dominates attention and tyrranizes over retina and percipient activities. We have to see what is before us, whether it pains or fatigues us, or not. But in the dark fancy images are spontaneous and fre- stez,qende. The professional oriental story teller is dull and inept like an owl in sunlight by day, and despite his will can unfold the charm of his art only when night has fallen. We know not what the imagination would be but for darkness, its great school, or if the eye, like the ear, could not close; or if eye pictures, like noises, had no night. This brings us to our problem, viz., why childish fancy dwells on awful things in the dark, when children so strongly prefer pleasant to painful objects, and when night is the most protected and safest time. One reason very plain from our returns is found in the common phenomena of starting. On falling asleep the brain remits its repressive action upon lower centres and existing stimuli, and the tension of basal and spinal cells is relieved by a more or less general convul- sion. From its analogy to the struggles of beheaded animals, this phenomenon is called psychic decapitation, and is so analogous to the start caused by the shock of sudden fear as to suggest danger. Sometimes we have the fear psychosis with no object of fear, or else some dim hypnogogic scene or object that may be present is intensified, or else a fit and ad- equate one is instantly suggested from the symptoms. Night- mare, and even most dreams (see IN: below), and other causes that wake us, are painful, and so feared. Thus when the momentum of sleep is well on, most of our wakings, if premature, havebeen painful so that darkness has here an- other association favoring fear. Again at night, and still more in sleep, we know we are helpless. We could neither fly nor fight. We are also more alone, and solitude favors timidity, and helplessness not only suggests, but seems to invite danger,which the sensitized ear and brain so easily invent. Again, when the constraint of sense is ofE and images struggle to reach and survive in the focus of attention, those that are stronger and more rousing have an advantage. Thus the nascent imagination takes its first lesson in the school of fear as both anticipatory and reminiscent pain, just because the latter is a stronger stimu- lus than pleasure, and outclasses it in this struggle. Children who gloat over horrors may be instinctively atpplying strong stinluli to develop the rude, early statges of imagination, as we pinch ourselves to keep awake. We must go back of this to explain fully both the fear dia- thesis and some special fears. It is just in these drifting</page><page sequence="43">189 A STUDY OF FEARS. automatic states so favored by darkness, and sometimes even by fatigue, when the imagination is laying the basis of mind and first divorcing thought from sense that the soul feels the pain of its old scars received in the long struggle by which intelligence unfol(led out of instinct and instinct out of refleses. In the past the pain field has been incalculably larger than the pleasure field, and so potent is this past that ita influence dominates the most guarded child, in whom otherwise the pleasure field should be relatively the largest anywhere to be found. Now, darkness and the unknown alike have few terrors; once they had little else. The old night of ignorance, mother of fears, still rules our nerves and puises in the dark despite our better knowledge. Lacking this latter, children fall still more abjectly under her spell. Hence it is that animals found ouly irl distant lands or long extinct, robbers, impossible monsters, ghosts, etc., rarely present, and never feared irl waking consciousness, bear wit- ness again to the remoteness of the past to which some of the roots of this class of fears peIletrate.

In some oE the above cases symptoms of fear are strong,but the images are not clear, 13, 16, 17; in others favorite terrors recur in different combinations, 17, 20, 37; in some optical symptoms, 10, 27, or tactile experiences, 7, are protninent. Some are cause or effect of intense strain or effort, 19, 25, 26, 24, or may leave great exhaustion. Falling and floating, 27, 28, 29, 30, 36, 41, are common; claustrophobia, 22, 38, less so. The form of dream terrors is often lecurrent or even known at the time to have been previously experienced, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 21, 24, 25, 29, 31, 39, 41, or are expected to come trlle because repeated, 4, 9. Fear of bad dreams may cause dread of sleep, 1, 8, and waking may be a welcome escape, 14, 34. Notonly are awful experiences or flitting fancies repeated and magnified, but dreams may leave long and perhaps per- manent traumata in the waking state. Sudden dread of dogs, 26; of cows, 12; of goingoutalone,6;fallingonstairs, 31; Indians, 33, and even of a parent, 32, may thus be sud- denly injected into the waking consciousuess. Flying, 30, and otherwise strange things, 2, seem possible; fatigue ris- ing almost to paralysis may remain, 25; and education in sleep is possible, 11. The cases selected above show but faintly the volume or manifold form of this group of very common fears. See, too, under VIII, cases 27, 32, 35, 36, 38. Any class or form of fear may arise in dreams: falling, orientation, animals, thunder, water, fire, etc. Thus to e2C:- plain these would be to e2C:plain all fears. There are frequent tendencies both to specialize and repeat. Any impression grows to illnsion easier than in darkness, because the re- pressive influence, not ouly of sight, but of other senses and centres, is removed. lIence evils only feared in waking be- come real in sleep, and we actually fight, fall, are chased, seized, choked, ran till we drop, fly, sob, love, and die. We shall make here but one suggestion. Sleep is a process of re- pose for run-down cells, a state of great metabolic activity o the plane of what we may call the higher digestion, and nor-</page><page sequence="47">193 A STUDY OF FEARS. mal, spontaneous waking of any organ or centre that sleeps, should be satiety, overflow and perhaps euphoria. To secure such sleep and waking is one of the best ends and tests of all that can be called hygiene and regimen, whether of body or soul. Circulation and digestion should be at their best, and in sleep nve may be especially sensitized to any disturbance here. Vast as is the majority of all painful dreams due to this easily avoidable cause of so much of the fear diathesis, these are all due to interferences with normal sleep. This latter would not earclude dreams, because waking is gradual and, as as it were, in spots, nor would it earclude dreams of fear and pain, if these had specific centres and fllnctions whose nor- mal action caused them. That there are such foci of pain no less deep seated and with quite as strong a tendene.y to act as in the case of pleasurable se2C: dreams, seems to me proba- ble from our full dream record. Some of the inherited and re- peatedcases, as well as thosethat fall underother sect,ions, sug- ge#t an organism hereditarily handicapped with old in#ane ten- dencies, but functioning normally in dreams, rather than they do overfeeding, etc. ,which, however, like any other present con- dition, may be an occasional cauee even of this class. Nowhere is there greater need of further and more special study than of such dream motives as flying, getting bigger, being held, lost, etc. L:- SEOCE. 1. M., 18.

Fright mayeause painful associations, 3, 23, 29, and he cured in curious ways, 34, 35. For two children and many women the Fourth of July is dreaded on account of explosions. Four cases of shock or prostration are due to explosions at the theatre. Three were made ill by blasting. Besides our 603 fears of thunder and lightning, there were nine well devel- oped fears of earthquakes, 14 scares at locomotive bells and whistles, 12 haunting fears of paralysis, 4 of epilepsy, 12 of apoplesy, 26 shocks at the onset of street bands, fire and church bells, and 9 of sneezes, or stories with &lt; ' boo 2 ' in them. The effects of sudden shock are of two chief kinds. The first is a muscular start. This may be almost entirely in- coordinated, a " mass of clotted motion," or more organized movements of defense, flight, etc. It may be of all de- grees of violence, from the slight start, so common in im- pressionable people, to cramp or refles epilepsy, with result- ing lameness. The other group of effects is predominantly psychic. There is intense coRgwofto cerebrt, with its presellt distress and lperhaps sequent obliteration of memory and motor images, paresthesia, hypalgia, etc. In the voluminous shock literature so suggestive for psychology, there is a marked recent tendeney to turn from the earlier theories of specifically spinal to general localization, from vaso-}7zotor paralysis, blood, cell, and other attempts at physical e2r- planation to the admission of psychic causes.l Cases like Fi, ' Openheim, " Die Trc6umc6tische Neurosen," Berlin, 1892, p. 178 et seq. And also Grooningen, " Uber den Schock,X' Wiesbaden, 1885, p. 134 et seq.</page><page sequence="51">197 A STUDY OF FEARS. 6, 9 and others suggest a psychic factor, acting analogously to an epileptogenic zone or to some scars. Over-attention, sudden exhaustion, refle2r inhibition or emotional strain, to which neuropathic people are so predisposed, or perhaps hypnotic suggestion, may cause pain, changed sensations, and psychic alterations so deep as to affect the entire mental and moral life, and a11 may be of ideogenic origin. Whatever theory of shock we adopt, however, we may, I think, conceive the hodograph of attention, with all its sequence of topicst intensities, tonest etc.t as always moving between the extremes of complete interruption and estreme continuity. If the latter is perfect, there is unconsciousness, illustrated by the frog boiled to death without moving if the heat is applied gradually enough. Rupture of continuity is shock. The minimal changes perceived, and especially the ma2zimal of sudden change that can be reacted to without error or waste of energy, differ widely with age, vigor, health and moods, and probably have anthropometric value not yet recognized. Variations from excessive vulnerability to shock to obtuseness, from one persons horror of it to another7s passion for it, may have the highest pedagogic as well as diag- nostic value. Now dread of shock and surprise,which, if extremewe may call hormephobia, appears to be a very fundamental instinct of physical and especially of psychic preservation. It prompts bir(ls and animals to post sentinels, build shelters, etc., and profoundly modifies their habits. Spencer's theory of the evolution of the eye as anticipatory touch in order to avoid sudden contact, the definition of science as prevision, the struggle to get science logically organized and thinkable, ev- olution, the elimination of miracles, are all in order to pro- tect from and save the waste of shock by enabling man to anticipate change from afar, and do his thinking and feeling with the shocl elements reduced to the point of greatest possi- ble economy, yet not so faintly agglutinated as to be obscure. Even attention is an organ of anticipation, and increasing knowledge makes its hodograph approsimate an ever steadier causal alignment. As man reduces and organizes the shocks with which his psychic life began to terms of greatest legibility with given time and energy, the subtlety re- quired to deal with these reducta as well as impressionability to the vastly wider ranges they open, increases, and intelli- gent adlllts grow less familiar with the ruder forms of shock and less tolerant of them. Children, however, are more es- posed. Their world still has wide realms of chance, where the lnost unexpected things may happen any moment. In many cases of development arrested in juvenile stages we still</page><page sequence="52">get glimpses not only of what the ancient chaos of ignorance really meant and of the awful struggle alld loss by which it has been overcome, but also of the sanifying culture power of what are now the common-places of science. Just in propor- tion to the lability or convulsability of the psychic elements is the dread of anything sudden that may cause fulminating dis- charge, so that no class of fears needs to be more carefully re- spected, or is harder to treat, while no class of fear studies opens a more promising field for scientific research than this. With this class of fears, more perhaps thall with any other, we now have within reach the possibility of a direct reference to the underlying mode of brain action, which may be rowlghly set forth as follows: A meeboid motions, which represent the beginnings of most of the basal physiological functions and which are of SUGh i- creasing charm and suggestiveness, have two ehief phases, one of expansion and one of contraction. In the former living substance stretches out pseudopodia in any direction, flows or pulls itself along, takes food, etc., and ill the latter state, which is assumed in response to touch, jar or shock, as well as to Stlong thermal, chemical or electric stimuli, it balls itself to present the least possible surface, and always dies contracted. Whether vital phenomena represent a new solution of a comples problem in molecular mechanics or a new vital principle, we, of course, do not know. They are, however, limited and partly controlled from without by the laws of surface tensions, and one problem is to find the causes of its diminution which lets out the movements and its in- crease which favors the spherical form, 1 affinity of the pro- toplasm for oxygen lessening the tensiort and possibly rapid metabolism increasing it. Duval2 suggested that the free nerve endings of Cajal, which the latter found often in contact with both the proto- plasmic processes of nerve cells and with the body of cells in the brain, might be conceived to retract by amaeboid motion, and that this breaking of contact might be the cause of sleep and narcotization. Ill the waking state he conceived this con- ductivity as restored by spontaneous re-contact, although movement was sought for in vain by Rolliker in the ends of both the motor and sensory fibers in living larvae, where they would be most expected. The view of Duval has been modified and extended by Rabl-Ruckhard, while Lenhossek3 thinks such a view does not impair the functional value of brain l Verworn, " Allgemeine Physiologie."

Moreover dendrites may be tuned to act UpOal certain contaets and not to others, growth may make new contacts possible, etc. Lateral fibrils he thinks receptive both of food and of stimulus. If Cajal's free ends are to be assumed so often where Golgi found network, and if they act without contact, Lenhossek call readily adjust himself to a new prillciple of action at a distance in place of the idea of direct nervous continuity, for a conllectioll that is functional only is less materialistic. Cajall says the neuroglia cells of the gray substance show all stages of retraction and relasation. In the former the protoplasm of the cell body increases, the processes grow short and thick and the secondary processes vanish. In this contractile function he compares them to the pigmet cells in the skin of color-changing animals. Contractile brain cells he finds most abundant in the molecular layer where fibrillar contacts are thickest. In their relased state the neuroglia processes pass between the nerve tips and the cells and isolate them, while when contracted they absorb the protoplasm of the secondary processes and thus cause contact. A ccording to Duval,contractions accompanied psychic rest and relasation meant activity. For C:ajal, the reverse is true, and these cells become byt,heir movement, which may be automatic or not, shunting and isolating agents. A s the energetic contraction of these cells makes connections here or breaks them there, there occur in the mind associations, imperative rapidity of words or thought, or stagnation and forgetfulness, mon- oideistic concentration of attention, vehement action, etc. In attention the hundreds of pseudopodia inserted into each brain capillary contract, and thus eause hypereemia, or COD.- gestion of the perivascular space. Thus the physical basis of all psychic acts and states whatever, morbid as well as nor- mal, sleep, fatigue, attention, confusion, etc., are all created by the contraction and relaxation of cell branches in the brain. Demoor2? leaning on Wissl's dendritic granulation theory, thinks any prolongation may be and those caused by morphine, alcohol and chloroform are always moniliform. Without going quite so far as Elemm, who says3 *'reticulary, fibrillary, alveolary, are only states of one and the same plasma, tran- sient or lasting during life, or perhaps first assumed in the "' Einige Hypothesen ?iber den Anatomischen Mechanismus der Ideenbildung der Association und der Aufmerksawkeit."

Cells, he thinks, associate their fllnctions by establishing more or less contacts between their prolongations, and so add and co- ordinate their otherwise monadic work by their own energy of biotonic movement. Betziusl takes a more conservative view, conceding longitudinal transformation to glia cells, at least during feetal stages, and holding that if tangential con- tact of processes occurs then, they rigidify later; while Raes2 thinks his measurements may show that the caliber and volume of fibers increase by use, and that. the extremes of acute delirium and stupidity may show a difference of size, and Golgi3 thinks motion undemonstrated. While this motion is as yet unproven, these hypotheses of motion have created intense interest and given great stimulus. The dead brain that histology has chiefly studied heretofore, affords us little idea of the comples activities that take place in the living one. The classic work of IIodge has shown to the eye the metabolic cell changes attending normal Ilerve action. Nowt if movements like those above or any others do attend normal psychic activity, I think we are surely justified in inferring that strong shock, which is perhaps the most drastic of all experiences, must greatly increase it and cause transformation, obliterating or intensifying some asso- ciations and opening up new ones, giving to attention new labilities, modifying our automatism, laying the basis of pareethesias, loss of words, imperative ideas, impulsive acts, innervating the wrong or antagonistic muscles, flushing the vaso-motor or splanchnic nerves, callsing stuttering, sudden rigidity, es:haustion, paresis, and all the other shock effects possible to the point of the dual personality phenomena. Strong and sudden experiences of fear may have shaped the brain and modified its minute structure in the past to an es:- tent hitherto unsuspected, laying even in its now fised archi- tecture, to say nothing of its motor habits or the diatheses of its neurons, a physical basis not only for easy fear-convuls- ability generally, but especially sensitizing it for partioular forms of shock. Brains of greaterplast,icity or less estab- lished coherence of parts or elements would thus most dread and be most damaged by shocks of eruptive violence.

Of all our cases, but two, 29 and 34, had not feared thun- der. This fear is often cured, 25, 2G, 27, 28, and resistance to it appears in 3, 7, 23. It may be specialized, as in 10; develop specific imagery, as in 10, 17, 18, 1£b, 21, or almost ritualized acts, 5, 36, or automatic psychoses, 12, or convul- sions or paralysis, 15; strong emotional expressions, 4, 6, 15, 35, 37, or fearfetichism, 31, or moral and religious associa- tions, 3, 30, 32, 36, mazy appear. It may gravely affect health and thecourse of life, 1, 8, 36, 37, and the reaction afterward may be joyous, 13, 14. On the approach of a t,hunder shower, some shllt, all the windows, blinds, curtains, and perhaps light, t,he gas, go down cellar, into a dark closet,, cover up t,he head in bed, sit, on pillows in t,he middle of t,he :Soor, creep bet,ween feather beds on steads with legsinsulat,ed by bit, of glass, et,c. Some children develop elaborate pro- t,ection in t,heir fancy, as being in a, globe of solid steel, a house of rubber or glass, a cellar cave, or having a, fantastic system of lightning rods, some of which are amusing. It, is pat,hetic to read of some family groups where the children have inherit,ed this fear fron t,he parent,s sitt,ing in silent, dread, praying or singing hymns, t,hinking, repea,ting or reading aloud some of t,he Biblical descriptions of Sinaitic thunder, or making puny spectral resolves for radical self- reconstruction, which fade in clear sky like ghost fears at dawn. The inefficacy of these terrors in carrying out good resolves, or even in preparations for the next storm, so often planlled, is amazing. But it is too much to say, as one does, that those who suffer most from this fear never have lightning rods. Till about eleven, the average child in our reports fears thunder more than lightning, and often enjoys the latterwhile dreading the former. Some deseribe with satis- faction and detail the jlufXctaraqzg of learning that it was the flash and not the noise that was to be feared. A few jump and start with, as they think, no stimulus at all, but from sheer tension. The fact that this fear leads all the others, and as that yet so sma]l a fraction of one per cent. of deaths are by lightning,</page><page sequence="58">shows that as yet our correspondents have notl adjustled tlheir #cale of fear tlo that of danger. Perhaps nowhere is tlhe power of noise to contlrol feeling and also to excite imagery so well seen. This lattler differs greatlly in intlensity and stlill more in form. In a thunder shower some children persistently think of a battle, bombs bursting, etc., some of tlhe moon or sky cracking. Some conceive the approach of a stlorm as from above downward toward the earth. Oftlen the imagery involves a firmamentl, as an arch of sheetl iron, boiler metal, zinc, tin, etc., resonant like a sounding-boaid, over which barrels, balls, wheels, etc., are rolled. Sometlimes clouds burst or buntl intlo each other, or into hills or hollses. Loud thunder is described as bearing or pressing down heavily in a mechanical sense. Again it is God, Santa C:laus, devils or angels groaning or shouting in an angry voice. All kinds of noisy events and occupations ice sliding off houses, coal being run in, big mills, machinery, locomotives, etc.,- are fancied, all according to familiar laws of apperception. l Vivid lightning in the dark makes an even sharper contrast to the eye than that between thunder and stillness to the ear, but the former can be closed, the latter not. Not only is noise itse]f more massive and overwhelming, but the imagery of lightning many matches struck, gzs tllrned oll, clouds splitting, bigeyes winking, etc., is fainter and less varied. The main point, howeverX is that thunder gives a profound sense of reality above. For primitive consciousness, belief in and reverence of powers above are never so fervid as in a thunder storm. Eow such phenomena at Sinai almost created both the religious and political consciousness of the plain dwelling Hebrews, making God m(lre actual, powerful, dread- ful, near, etc., Renan has shown at length,2 while Euhn's great work3 shows how many beings, motives and story books of the mythology and folk-lore of all the A ryan races are cast in the mould of this imagery. It is perhaps too much to say that we now as little realize the moral, sesthetic and re- ligious capital to be developed at a certain age out of chil- dren s feeling for this group of natural phenomena when their psychology shall be adequately known, as Franklin foresaw our age of electricity. But it is certainly superScial to ascribe all these effects to jar and noise, and to note refles effects while ignoring the larger and deeper phylogenetic fac- tors.

F., 7. The greatest fear is for the noise of a whip-poor- will. These samples from the 1,486 fears of animals in Table I, which altogether make our largest group? illustrate some of its chief features. Totemistic tendencies appear in 3, 11, 19, 20, etc.; fetichism in 25, 83, 86, 88; various superstitions in 22, 24, 29, 33, 36, 67, 81; remote associations in 7, 8, 12, 41, 46, 50, 51, 69, 70, 71, 79, 84; specialized fears in 3, 10, 21, 25, 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 73, 78, 81, 85, 88; exaggeration of ani- mals' size and power in 6, 9, 11, 18, 20, 54, 77. Certain ani- mals may be fancied as very llear and only half feared, 3, 15, 16; and about as real as some of the darkness cases, VIII, 31, 37, 38. The onset of the fear may be sudden and spon- taneous, 41, 64, and may involve imaginary touch, 72, 75. Fears of reptiles lead all others, and snakes, which have played such a part in early religions', and of which all known species of ape have such dea(lly fear, are first of all. Fear of mice, worms and insects is so strong, compared with fear of great and dangerous animals, as to suggest that, just as slight but certain penalties are better deterrents of cxime than un- certain great ones, so our nerves have been more aHected by common stings and bites of vermin and things that crawl and hum than by possible death frorrI beasts of prey. The great sensory disturbance of minimal of tickle-touches is probably also a factor. The animal world is so much larger and more diverse than the human in featurer, forms and acts, while animal traits and expressions are so easily detected in men, andvice versa, that thechild comes into a far larger world in knowing animals. ABsthetic, moral and physical qualities are isolated, magnified and better understood. Sympathies are enlarged, a background and a key are given to a knowledge of some of the basal traits of human nature. Yet frequent as are the shyings and novelties, and inveterate as are some of these old and rapidly decadent fears, the love and interest of all llormal children in animals are far greater, and the peda- gogic value of wide acquaintance with many forms of animal life, low and high, is invaluable. The vast diversity of the world of instinct, with its marvelous plasticity with which it {its and fills every possibility of life, b.y such a vast variety of habits, is more akin to childhood than to adults, and is one of the best possible schools for sympathy, and not a few of the more innate powers of the soul. Much that makes the latter good Ol great rests on and finds its explanation in ani- mal instincts. The more I studJr the feeling of children for animals, the less I can agree with SallJr, CompaJrrb an(l others lSee Fergusson, " Tree and Serpent Worship." s STUDY OF FEARS. 209</page><page sequence="64">210 HAT.T.: that the hypothesis of ancestral transmission is not needed here. More than many others, these fears seem like lapsed refieses, fragments and relics of psychic states and acts which are now rarely seen in a11 their former vigor, and which neither the individual life of the child nor even present con- ditions can wholly explain. Very far from asserting that any of the fears of the cat, dog and cow class can be proven to be older than domestication, or that even the smallest root of the snake fears runs back to the tertiary age of reptiles, etc., it still seems wise to keep this larger solution, to which Darwin was so strongly attached, open, and to push on further and more detailed studies of this greatest but, perhaps, most rapidly vanishing of a11 our fear groups. hIeanwhile our data permit us to look a little more c]osely at a few of the many points suggested here in the following: NIII.

The eye, which is the most mobile of our features, can open and shut, is incessantly changing the aperture of its pupil, so that this is almost as sensitive a register of psychic change as the knee-jerk, bulges forward and sinks back with chang- ing attention, corneal tension, so that it grows bright and dull? and with its color contrasts, etc., is naturally the first object of visual interest to the child. Froebel signalizes the infant's first gaze into its mother's eyes as an important stage of psychic growth. The eye is the first feature to appear in children's drawings. 1 Young children look the speaker in the eye and rarely in the mouth. TJnlike other senses the eyes first interest is in another eye, and Dr. Drew2 found in 356 students' love poems the charm of eyes was mentioned 'E3ee Dr. Luken#, Ped. Sern., IV, p. 79 et seq. 2Ped Sem., Vol. II, p. 504 5</page><page sequence="66">212 WA TsT.: ninety-one times, leading by far all other features. Eyes hypnotize; a staring test is really a battle of two wills, and in older children to gaze too steadfastly marks insensitive- ness. So identical is commonly the focus of vision with that of attention that to be looked at makes children conscious and constrained, and they very early learn to know when they are looked at, often dread even God as a 8p. The gaze anticipates action, and is seen, e. q., in stalking. For every animal that is attacked or preyed upon, the critical moments of its life, and those that summon its greatest en- ergy, are those between being seen by its enemy and the seis- ing, fight or flight that follow. Instinct first looks to the eye for signs of evil or good intent, and the latter have to be slowly learned, for the slightest novelty here was often the most pressing of danger signals. The big eyes that subdue naughty children, illustrate tales of big animals, goblins or witches, etc., must owe some of their terrors to ancestral reverberations from the long ages during which man strug- gled for existence with animals with big or strange eyes and teeth, and from the long war of all against all within his own species. Savages depict their deities with awful eyes, and the collections of their totem-posts, masks and rude draw- ings show that, perhaps, next to teeth, eyes have most power to conjure fear. I once made notes, many years ago, on a case of a young woman in the Baltimore City Eospital for the Illsane, who suffered for months from the fised delusion of a monster with dreadful green eyes in a glass sphere, and of another man with imperfect sight, who thought the sun a malignant cyclopean eye of a deity about to eat his human children as a punishment for their sins. NIV. FEAR OF TEETH: ODONTOPHOBIA. 1. Four children cry with fear if they see false teeth move. 2. Ssven showed signs of fear when they first saw people laugh. 3. Two would not go near a relative who had lost one or more teeth. 4. Others fear people who &amp;how teeth unu#ually broad, long, sharp or serrated. 6. Bige prominent or irregular teeth sometimes cause adults to be feared. 6. It would seem from several cases that the grin tends first to be feared, and that only later does pleasure come to be associated with it. 7. F., 15. Always hatedpeople whose eye teeth looked differ- ent from the others. 8. F., 14. Could not bring herself to touch another's teeth.</page><page sequence="67">213 A STUDY OF FEARS. 9. F. Three girls under 4 svould not kiss people because of peculiar teeth. 10. F., 19. Is always a little ansious lest a friend should smile and spoil everything. 11. F., 18. Cannot like those who show the back teeth when they smile. 12. To show and gnash or grind the teeth terrifies three small children. 13. F., 3. Cannot learn biting games where hard teeth touch soft flesh; the rare pleasure often shown in such plays is sometimes not far from fear, and like 80 many other things owes its chief charm to the courage that reduces fear to a plaything. 14. F., 17. Is still nervous to hear teeth grind or clash to- gether. 15. F., 19. Thinks people should be taught to smile agreeably and show their teeth rightly. 16. F., 4. Is afraid to go near a drawer in which her mother's false teeth are kept. 17. F., 5. Fears to enter a room where stands a small idol with horrid fangs. 18. M. A dying man in his delirium expressed terror of a half shut melodeon, calling the keys teeth; his daughter, who was present, reports a long uncanny feeling, not only for that melodeon, but all keyed instruments. The entrance to the alimentary canal must tave beetl the object of supreme fearwherever the law eat or be eaten has reigned. One primal element in the charm of the kiss may have been the mutual pledge and faith that in the place of supreme fear love reigns. The reptellant element may origin- ally have been stronger than the attraction. The charm of mouth as well as teeth, now so great for amorists, must have been secondary,and interest in all their movements, positions and shapes may have arisen out of the slow conquering of this archaic dread. XV. FEAR OF FU}t: DOR A PEOBIA. Of this I have 111 well developed cases, 11 of which are one rear old or under, 15 of which are between one and two, 19 between two and three, 7 between three and four, 10 be- tween four and five, 7 between five and si2r, and the rest later or with age not given. The following abridged cases illus- trate these returns: 1. M., 6 mos. First touched a fur mufl, #creamed and cried 80 hardwe almo#t feared he could not get his breath; his fear was overcome by patience when he was 3. 2. M., 7 mos. Threw up his arms and screamed loudly with fright when hi# sister playfully shook a muff at him; months later he was induced to touch it, but this revived his old fear.</page><page sequence="68">214 FTAT.T.: 3. F., 8 mos. Seeing aboa, put up her hands and cried; it loolred a little like a gray cat she feared. 4. M., 8 mos. Had what seemed to be an instinctive fear of neck scarf seen for the first time; no association with animal# lrnown. 5. M., 11 mos. Shrank and cried at the approach of an old friend with a fur trimmed coat; when this was removed fear vanished. 6. F., 1. Was run over by a big dog, and feared every kind of fur long afterward; in 5 cases this association with a fright from dogs, cats or other animals is the obvious source of the fear. 7. M., 1. Cannot touch a sheepskin rug without horror, but lies on it all right unless his hands feel it. 8. F., 16 mos. Showed instant terror on touching the curly hair of a new doll, but was very fond of bald-headed ones; she could never wear a fur cap or trimmings. 9. Sis children expressly associate biting with the touch of fur. 10. Three obviously fear the blackness of fur, like seal; but- 11. There are two good cases of early dread of white furs. 12. M., 2. Was always " deathly afraid of the least little bit of furi " he never would go near his mother when she wore a feathery whlte Angora bonnet. 13. Three cases report fur apparel as abandoned for children on account of their great fear of it. 14. One writes if the cat is thought scratchy, or the child has had unpleasant experiences with animals, they fear fur. 15. Eleven cases express the opinion that this fear was in- stinctive. 16. Three saw it in young children who had never seen even a dog or cat. 17. F., 2. The fear is not looking at fur, but if she touches any- thing fuzzy or woolly, she shrieks with terror. 18. F., 3. Caught horror of all furs from visiting a menagerie. 19. F., 13. Always shuddered at everything furry. 20. F. A single hair upon her dress still gives her a strong creepy feeling. 21. F., 4. Fears onlyblack furs. And another fears onlywhite and gray. 22. F., 4. Fears only mottled fur. 23. Two report love of looking at fur, butdread of touching it. 24. P'., 14. Long had a special horror of seeing fur parted or blown 80 as to #how the skin beneath. 25. F., 5. Dreads only coarse or long fur. 26. F., 14. Reports early dread of buflalo robes, of touching COW# or horses, because they had hair like bears, which she did not outgrow until 12. 27. F., 16. Only outgrew this fear when presented with a fur jacket. 28. M., 4. Shows his horror of touching fur by putting both hands behind him and spitting vigorously. 29. F., 5. Cannotbe induced to touch cotton or have it near her, even calling it " kitty." 30. F., 8. Associated fur and musk in her fear.</page><page sequence="69">215 A STUDY OF FEA}RS. 31. M., 8. Was cured of this fear by seeing a cow killed and skinned. 32. F., 17. Still has, and always did, a violent dislike of having fur touch her skin; it produces a strong feeling she can only de- #cribe as " queer." 33. No insects excite it, even in crawling, except fuzzy cater- pillars. 34. Several report more or less strong dislike of sleeping between blankets. 35. F., 14. Has a horror of wool, and will not wear it in inner or outer garments. 36. F., 16. I cannever bear to touch velvet, peaches, or any- thing fuzzy; sometimes they suggest dirt and disease. 37. F., 16. Dreads to touch peaches, although very fond of them, until another has pared them. 38. F. A woman cannot wear mittens when a child a nice pair of svhite ones were made for her, but at the point a hair was knit in with the yarn; this sickened her 80 that no pair has gone on her hands since. Sometimes this fear seems to be aroused chiefly or only by touch, 1, 7, 8, 23, 26, 32, 33, and to be irradiated to blankets, feathfers, velvet, etc., 29, 34, 35, 36, 37, or evell to a single hair, 20, 38. This involves the strange tickle sense and suggests it as a cause. There is a novelty about the touch of fur, but whether this and such associations as 9 explain all or not, we do not know. In 2, 5, and also in 12, 28, 29, sight alone seems concerned. Some love to look at, but cannot touch it, 17, 23. Painful experience is the chief factor in many cases, 3, 6, 14, 18, but denied in more, 4, 15, 16. It may be associated with biting, 9; color, 10,11; musk, 30; dirt, 36; be specialized to fear of only black, 21, or mottled fur, 22; to parts showing the skin beneath, 24, or to coarse fur, 25, 26. Perhaps it is really the far more common love of fur that most needs explanation, but both this love and fear are so strong and instinctive that they can hardly be fully accounted for without recourse to a timewhen association with animals was far closer than now, or pXar- llaps when our remote ancestors were hairy.

AnEngli#hwomanwrite#: '4 When 1 or 2 I had greathor- ror of feather# of any kind, if loo#e, but not when growing on bird#; I once sat on the floor rigid becau#e a bit of eider-down from a quilt moved toward# me." 14. F., 4. Was greatly terrified by a leaf floating in the bath tub. 16. F.7 3. Has great awe of the feather duster. 16. M.7 18 mos. A mother write#: " If I have a feather my boy will do anything I want." 17. Another lay# a feather on anything #he doe# not wi#h her child to touch. Most, if not all these cases, seem sufficiently explained by what the child thinks to be the power of self-motion, asso- ciation with insects, tickling, etc. Self-motion is the most distincive feature of animal life, and Darwin, Brooks and others have described the fright of dogs at things moved by a very light breeze or invisible string.

M., 18. Alway# had great dread of hi# father, disliked his presence; could not be free, and was made nervous and stupid. 15. F., 31. Is frantic if blamed; her father's displeasure and standards for her always took the place of conscience, and her im- pulse still is to do what will not displease others rather than to do right. 16. F., 62. Could never be at ease with those of whose kindly disposition she was not well assured, and would still sacrifice al- most my good or gain rather than be blamed. 17. F., 27. Once found her love of a teacher changing without cause to fear; her hands would grow cold or wet, and her eyes twitch and turn away if they tried to meet the teacher's; sleep was broken, and she had to leave school a year; she thought the fear to be nervous self-consciousness. 18. F. At 7 or 8 a cultivated lady used to think several old women witches and their eyes dangerous. 19. M., 6. The chief fear was that older boys would make their hands like claws and claw at him. 20.

Beginning with anima]s, 19, children's fears of persons are often at first chiefly directed to black, lame, ugly, or espe-</page><page sequence="72">cially deformed people,to gypsies, rag men, Chinamen, police- men, coal men, tramps, tinkers, doctors, teachers, peddlers, and oftea extend to almost all strangers. They dread people with decided, 7, or superior, 8, manners; those who domi- nate and dwarf them, 15, 16; are often suspicious of the other ses, 11, 12, 13; develop horror of blame, 16, or ridi- cule, 9, and perhaps shrink from everybody of whose good will they are not well assured, 16. If there ever was a time when, as a rule, all strangers were dangerous, it was an age of war of all against all, such as IIobbes postu]ates, or of a severe struggle for existence among men. Many still live by the principle of treating even friends as if they might become enemies. In the country, with sparse population, awe of strangers, so obliterated in the impudent city gamin, is still seen and in all degrees and forms. With this group of fears more than with any others, I think, we must connect the phenomena of blushing. From returns to another syllabus, to be reported oll later, it appears that no part of the body is esempt from blushing. The blush storm may be immediate or long delayed, may start in sharply defined points and spread, often passes from the epigastrium or even the feet upward, like an aura, may al- ternate with pallor, be so intense as to cause a rash after- waid, and, in rare cases, it may amount almost to vesica- tion; be so inordinate as to make even men recluses and compel them to change their vocations. Thts heart beats violently, there may be constriction in the chest and even globus. The mind is confused, there is a sense of helpless- ness, weakness, tremors, perspiration, the eyes blink, look down or sideways, and, in some cases, tears are shed; there is tinnitus, twitching, awkward movements, the breath stops, and sometimes the face is covered and the blusher turns away in flight. 1 Now, most of these symptoms are those of fear. In some languages the word for blushing and shame is the same, as in the Swedish b7,ygse7,, and Oken, long ago called shame, " a partial fear. 2 2 2 Nearly if not quite all our reactions to an intense blush are the same as those that fol- low a fright. The most blushes reported are directly or indirectly related to se2r. Women blush far more and far later in life than men, and most of all in adolescent years, and chiefly at the mention, in the presence or at the advances of the other se2r. That ' See "Morbid Blushing: its Pathology and Treatment," by H. Campbell, M. D., in Wood's Med. and Sxzrg. Monographs, 1890. Also, Canlille Melinard in the Chaxztaxzquan, 1893. 2 4 'Naturgeschichte, " IV, S. 205. 218 HALL:</page><page sequence="73">219 s STUDY OF FEARS. this diathesis originated in part from an ancestral se2: fear is entirely consistent with the fact that such blushes may be also now often attended with pleasure. Shyness, coyness, maidenly modesty, owe their charm to the female reluctance born of fear. Even if these blashes are a widely irradiated or penumbral glow of se2rual erethism, it is the inhibition of fear that must have been the chief agent in checking and irra- diating or discentralized them far from acts or organs, and these fears of observation, of consequences, of betrayal of in- clination, operate on both se2res, and may extend even to thoughts that cause blushing in solitude. Even the blush at compliment may have been because once the sense of being admired was associated with greater danger. Other causes of blushing most often mentioned in our returns are: being looked at, laughed at, accused, suspected, native bashfulness? awkwardness, breach of etiquette, being talked of, criticised, and even the fear of blushing. Self-consciousness of body or mind arises, and people become so sensitive to the opinions of others that they cannot be natural in the presence of those of whose sympathy and good opinion they are not well as- sured. They must be among friends, whose very t,houghts they do not, fear, or t,he vaso-motor system still reverberates with the iecho of old dreads of alien faces long after the vol- untary muscles or their cerebral centres need not be flushed for flight or fight. That t,his is in accordance with the law of the stageS of forget,ting, I shall t,ry to show lat,er. The blush of surprise and shock has a very different origin, and that of pleasure is t,o be exp]ained in a still more different way. We attempt here no theory of blushing generally, but only of one element of the problem. Whatever may be thought of our plea for paleopsychic elements in explaining other groups of fears, we surely have here phenomena which no one would think adequately accounted for by individnal experience. That there are instinetive fears as well as in- stinctive attractions for stlangers, few will doubt. XY111. FEAR OF SOLITUDE. 1. F., 22. Up to 16 could never be left alone, and never wa#. I was not u#ually afraid, but had a lonely feeling that was #imply dreadful. 2. F., 17. From about 8 to 12 had a horror of even momentary solitude; e. g., in picking berrie#, if for an in#tant she lo#t #ight of her mate#, #he would #cream and #ometime# lose consciou#ness. 3. F., 21. Has always loved to wander oiT into lonely places in</page><page sequence="74">220 HALL: the country, yet sometimes a creepy feeling of #olitude #prings upon her and #he is almo#t paralyzed with dread. 4. F., 23. All through her #chool days had a namele#s dread of being left alone in the hou#e, a# #he often was; everything within seemed gloomy and awful. Every few minutes #he would go out and look every way to see if #omeone was not coming. Every eBort at diversion was vain. The clock ticked #O loud that #he could feel the #ilence, which almo#t stunned her. " It felt as if everybody was dead. I would #ing and do the mo#t unusual thing#, watch the clock, the approach of night, dread every preposterous accident, #eek companion#hip with the animals in the barne and even with the flower# in the garden." 5. F., 17. Long sufTered from panic# that all her friend# and relative# would desert her. 6. M., 16. Got a panic at the age of 7 that hi# parent# were planning to run away from him; thi# haunted him for four weeks; he would wake up night# thinking they had gone, etc. 7. F., 7. Often u#ed to wake up dreaming that #he was alone in the house; #he would #cream, but never told till in an#ver to this #yllabus. 8. F., 20. Instead of being filled with the terror of solitary place#, which clouded all her childhood, ha# now come to find a peculiar and indescribable charm in fore#t gloom, gorges and every kind of #olitary place. 9. F. An Engli#h woman, after being for #ometime absorbed in reading, often suddenly awaken# to a #en#e that #he i# alone, and perhaps night coming on, although the hou#e i# full of people. "At #uch moment# a feeling of un#een being# crowding around would overcome me. I would often #tand in the middle of the room una- ble to nlove till, with a great effort, I could jU#t reach the door and fly, not daring to look behind." Sometimes the sense of being alone seems to spring more or less suddenly upon the mind as if it awoke spontaneously to it, as in 3 and 9; a little solitude may be intolerable, 2 and 4; friends may desert us, S; mates run away from us, 6; dreamed solitude brings a panic, 7; companionship with flovers and animals is consoling to four in a way that sug- gests the palpitating interest of the imprisoned Picciola in a plant, the juice of which saved his life, and Silvio Pellico's love of the ants, :lies and spiders in his cell. Gregarious as man is, every individuality grows solitary in proportion as it becomes defined, ansl great and new thoughts, as Zimmermann and A]ger have so well shown, make mell feel apart. The desert and its penance of solitude has always been the bul- wark of great souls nursing great thoughts, but weaker souls, Trappists, Caspar Hausers, etc., it stultifies. Children during their loJlg infanev have been most of all animals de- pendent on others, and in their horror of being alone we see, often in arrested and hypertrophied form, the fear that has mtlch to do in making the fashions, parties, and sects of the most imitative of all creatures.</page><page sequence="75">221 A STUDY OF FEARS.

Dreads death most in winter, and always prays to live till spring; fall is bad enough, but to be buried in snow is an intolerable thought. 19. M., 28. Dwells much on death, which he associates with eternity of time and space; to live on and on is a thought absolutely not to be endured; to think of infinite t,ime (he is a #tudent of phil- osophy) makes a lump rise in his throat. 20. F., 6. Ponders death, and gets so excited and afraid that all allusions to the subject in family prayers, reading, etc., must be avoided. 21. F., 28. When 9 overheard the doctor tell her mother she could not live to grow up; she said nothing, but grew serious, dwelt on it, applied all details to her own case; ffrst thought 10 would be " grown llp, then 12, 14, 18, etc., and is now well, but sadder than she should be. 22. F., 23. Has a chronic fear that her father is to die; although he is well, she fancies all the details and suffers over and over as much as if it were real. 23. F., 18. Has spells of fearing her mother will die; it gets worse and worse, and in a few days breaks like an ulcer and van- ishes. 24. F. From 6 to 9 had a fear that people were to die one by one and that she would be left alone on the earth, and then the end of the world would come when all the rest were gone. 25. F., 25. The thought of her own or her friends' death often comes suddenly and persists tenaciously; she sat, e. g., at the age of 13, in church near her sister, when the thought came that she had not moved and was dead; she could not look for fear it was true and grew rigid, when a motion relieved her fear, profuse per- spiration followed; this period of clouds and dark ages was ended by putting her trust in God. 26. F., 12. Grew so afraid to pass a graveyard on the way to school that she grew sleepless, lost flesh and became literally afraid of her shadow, and was cured slowly by memorizing Longfellow's "God's Acre." 27. M. 45. A college professor cannot pass a country grave- yard famlliar in his boyhood at night without the old panic- he has often tried to force himself to go through it, but desisted because " it would use up too much energy more useful in other ways." 28. F., 18. When she became convinced that the person ended whenput in the grave and there was no future life, her fears of death, which had been morbid, ceased. 29. F., 21. Her mother used to sing, "When this poor linger- ing, faltering tongue lies silent in the grave"; this gave her a vivid image of her motherin a coffin and a horror of death unfelt be- fore. 30. M. A roung man could not board in the house with a young lady because she worked in an undertalrer's factory. 31. F., 2. (3aw her mother in her coffin, and this caused life-long horror of all black boses and even boats, although she retained no memory of her mother alive.</page><page sequence="77">32. M., 10. Decided to go to hell when he died; rubbed brim- stone on him to get use to it, etc. 33. F., 18. Feared death because she felt sure she should tire of heaven and visit the other place for change and excitement and find it more painful than she could bear. Dread of death is apt to focus, now on fear of crape, on touching it, on a black dress, now on hollow eye-sockets, grinning teeth, or matted hair, or again on the creepy feeling of worms, being buried alive and being nailed in, shouting underground for aid, cremation, dread of dying away from home, sudden or slow death, coffin, shroud, etc. The young are apt to fear death for themselves, the old for others. Only eleven reported specific fears of hell. In nine cases religion has removed fear of death, but in far more of our returns it has caused or inereased it. Out of our 299 cases of fear of death, the above are typical, but the reader is commended to a fuller treatment of chil- dren's feelings about death by Dr. a. ^. Scott,1 who has had access to these data. Compared with its magnitude this sub- ject is as yet almost unknown. Most young children seem at first to have no instinctive feeling about death, as in 16, which is typical of a large class. The inherited dread of it may be evoked suddenly and almost reflexly by touch, as in 11; may long remain very inadequate, 7, 10, or break out with the greatest intensity, perhaps periodically, 1, 2, 3, 12, 17, 18, 20, 21, 25; burial is often far worse than death, and the fear may estend to the room, 9; very sick people, 8; the em- ployee of an undertaker, 30; graveyards, 26, 27; a black box or boat, 31. It is often chiefly feared for others, 22, 23, 24, 25. It may dismalize life from the most unexpected causes, 6, 21, 29, and be intensified by thoughts of eternity, 19. Sometimes these fears are defied, 32. Cowardice may be cured, 26, or reduced by belief in annihilation, 28, or wel- comed as a mere physical consummation, 13. lIeaven itself may be dreaded, 19, 33. The horror of death seems most intense in the years just preceding the great altruistic tide of adolescence, which brings mildly melancholy, Thanatopsis' moods of euthanasia, the reaction of which against the predominant selfishness of earlier years may settle into some such form, as 13. I know two academic instructors who take pleasure in following out in thought scientifically the processes of decomposition. One, like Richard JefEreys, wishes his ashes strewn on many winds and streams, so as to touch nature as widely as possible, and the other watches the flames of a cremation furnace as a kind ' A1KERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY, VO1.

The interest of one in the fates of the physical elements of his own body is great, and, he says, so satisfying and consoling, that anything good which the future may have in store for his soul will be a wel- come but not needed surplusage. Perhaps this is seen in 28, which is hardly dread of eternity like 19, or of monotony like 33, and ought not to be psychologically surprising in view of the consolation Buddhists find in the thought of extinction. The development of the doctrine of immortality, and its utili- zation as a moral motive, vast and preponderating as is tlle service it has rendered, has also brought a body of terrors, which work havoc with many nervous systems, not tonic enough to react properly to them. Eow rightly to admin- ister this fedr, which has always been one of the chief problems of religion, seems to be looming up again to peda- gogy. For practical as well as scientific reasons, further studies are urgently needed here to give eschatological prob- lems a firmer and more natural foundation. XL:. FEAR OF DISEASES. Children, as is well known, fear all prevalent diseases, and often have long spells of imagining, now one, now another group of symptoms. 1. F., 18.

F., 6. Long feared she would burst like Juda# Iscariot, and #he could see the blood coming out. 15. F. A kindergartner hopes heaven will reward her for fight- ing her uncontrollable aversion for dirty garments and dirty-faced children. 16. F., 12. Who had read of leprosy, thought it appeared in ared spot on her arm; wondered how long before people would find it out, or it would turn white, or the flesh drop off. 17. F., 15. Long fancied she was bleeding at the lungs; would wake up nights tasting blood; formed a bad spitting habit. 18. F., 11. Saw a case of St. Vitus' dance, and was terrified al- most into having it. 19. M., 10. Had a too vigorous lecture on catching cold, 80 that he would not coast nor run lest he should get sweaty; dreaded cold, stayed in, hart his health. 20. M., 7. Has heard of wounds, and thinks the least bruise or scratch will kill him; i# getting too careful of himself. 21. M., 28. An accomplished graduate student of philo#ophy and a father writes in substance: " The one greatest fear of all my boyhood was connected with my se2rual organs; the big boys would e2rpose us little ones, and said mine was too small; I began to brood over this, age 8; felt disgraced, and haunted with forebodings; one day there seemed a very slight inflammation age 12; I thought I had done a nameless sin, and prayed God to 3et me get well, which I soon did, but a morbid associationbetween it and a henXs neck long persisted; I read literature on lost manhood, self-abuse, etc.- fancied I had all the diseases, and had committed the unpardona- ble sin; the first spontaneous emission nearly paralyzed me, but al- though I found m-self still alive, felt that my days were numbered- I corresponded with a quack, and later began to #tudy my urine with great alarm, and found plenty of marks of disease; there were reddish and whitish settlings, lack of color and over color, strong #mell and no smell, it was too clear, too thick, too copious, too #canty, or, worst of all, had an iridescent scum; when 14 I grad- ually settled to the fact that I was sexuallyabnormal might possi- bly live seven years, till 21, and then find what I haa heard was a #ure cure in marriage; I found encouragement from quack adver- tisements, which said the wretched beings sometimes held out for years; I lived on, and people said I was in robust health, but it wa# years before I realized that I was perfectly normal; Bible passage# greatly aggravated my fears, such as one in Deut. xxiii, and others; as I look back myentire youth from 6 to 18 was made miserable from lack of knowledge that anyone who knew anything of the nature of puberty might have given; this long #ense of defect, dread of operations, #hame and worry has left an indelible mark.</page><page sequence="80">226 HALL: These fears sampled from 241 cases show how baseless fears, especially if untold, may modify diet, regimen and health, 4, 5, 6, 7, 19; diflerent diseases arefocused on, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 18. Case 21 is from a large class which often have painful and unprintable details. Altogether this group brings home to us what is coming to be apparentfrom several other sources, that all the departments of personal morality can in no way be so eHectively taught as from the standpoint of the new hygiene as the science of wholeness or holiness, to which these studies are now broadening. IJnlike death there can be no question about the propriety of utilizing to the uttermost these fears if they are wisely shaped to meet the requirements of the new ethics, which I believe is at the door. While some of the old fear groups, like those of ani- mals, are generally declining, dread of death and disease seems on the increase. Animals and even savages are not haunted by these far future fears as we are. The suddenness with which these fears may spring up to overmastering power shows a deep hereditary root copiously watered by supersti- tion. But life was never so rich and joyous as now, and so, by contrast, death never so black. I have personally wit- nessed a painful and certain death in the midst of health faced with a courage, which, it is no detraction from the praise of it to suggest, must in part have been made possible by heredity from a time of ancient relative indifference to death, before men learned to worry about it and a future state. Before modern medicine and surgery, and nursing too, the association of wounds and disease with death was closer, and forms oE illness have increased so that the ratio of illness and invalidism to each death has also increased, and with it dread, and also appreciation of the blessings of health. That psychic states condition and control health more and more as civilization advance#; that attention to any part or function of the body modifies its metabolism so that somatic introspection is fraught with danger of hypochondria; that heart, liver and uro-genital consciousness, etc., illllstrte the principle that the weaker an organ is the more it comes to the front, and the healthier it is the less conscious we are of it, and that the imitative instinct is nowhere more richly illustrated than in the field of morbid symptoms, all are now practically agreed. While utterly rejecting most of the theories and the preposterous claims of Christian science, mind and faith cures, it seems safe to assume that the mind may cure all the diseases it makes. This is no more than Kant held in his essay on '4 The Might of the Gemuth." If fear of apparitions, noiees, or even touches, faarors illusions of the senses involved how much more must fear of the more</page><page sequence="81">227 A STUDY OF FEARS. subjective sensations symptomatic of disease favor belief in their presence. In states of full euphoria, when we feel the joy of just being alive to transcend the pleasure of every sense, or the gratification of every special desire or ambition; when we best realize the old epigram of Martial that life is not to live, but to be well; when even knowledge, power, se2c and fame grow pale beside the feeling of full and abound- ing life; this is wholeness, holiness, health, and death and disease never seem so far or so black by contrast. Pear of these, however, which is perhaps the chief fear of adult life, presses upon souls almost in exact proportion to their feeble- ness. To be weak is to be fearful. Not only were disease and death never before so feared as now, but the imagination,which has created many horrors in the past that the world cannot soon forget, was never more actively creative of spectres of the mind than in this new field, where it checks the free, outdoor hardihood of children and youth, and hedges us about with precautions and things we cannot be, eat, do? attempt, till life is sometimes but a mean and craven frag- ment of what it might and should be. Many real cures ascribed to the mind, faith, etc., I think we must thus really ascribe to the natural physical regeneration that comes from breaking the insidious pareses of fear. A class of cases in this group of fears has a peculiar in- terest as being at the opposite extreme from those of shock in that they supervene so gradually as not to be recognized in the full light of consciousness as existing at all. Over against the traumatic fears, these must be considered as slow, chronic and constitutional. Even if there is a malingering element at first, it is evanescent. The approach has been so gradual and all the processes of restriction of the life-sphere so instinctive and unreflective that the real origin of the fear diseases is unsuspected. As in some geologic processes now active we can study how older formations must have grown, so from these contemporary phenomena we may infer the mode in which some of the more archaic fear-neuroses and psychoses slowly became fastened upon the race. More than any other class, perhaps, such fears are the stigmata of de- generation, and for this reason again, as well as for tbeir cryptogamous nature, harder to cure. But the decadence that begins at the obscure middle level, while less easily es- orcisable than fears of the highest level of full consciousness, is of course far more so than those that are of purely somatic origin. What to the ordinary consciousness may well seem a miracle of faith is quitewithin the domain of psychologic laws now well understood. 6</page><page sequence="82">228 HATsTs ::x:::x1. DIORAL AND RELIGIOUS FEARS. t. M., 14. The greatest fears are conscience fears; he beHeves heaven rewards and punishes our deeds on the spot. 2. F., 14.

Whenever she fears anything, like breaking her doli, she prays about it, and all goes well. 6. F., 12. If she did anything wrong she was sure to meet a policeman, and so became good. 6. M., 9. The dread which he has of the policeman is a good and true index of his conscience. 7. F., 12. If she has done anything wrong she fears the moon will fall on her. 8. F., 13. If she hasbeen naughtyBhe fears a brick will fall on her, or that she will cut herself} or fall from a bridge; this she did not connect with any divine belng, but thought the world was made that way. 9. M., 9. Read of the earthquake, and was told it came to pun- ish him; he afterwards put away all his toys over Sunday. 10. F., 16. Is sure to miss every lesson she studies on Sunday. 11. F., 6. Thought earery one must cross a chasm over a fire by walking a hair, and kept good so she could get across. 12. F., 45. An English lady was robbed of the joy of childhood by religious fears; finding God did not answer prayer she tried the devil and found him kinder; then had a terror of the unpardonable sin; images of the great white throne sheep and goats, one taken and the other left, memories of DonaXi's malignant comet of 1858, imminent dread of the crash of collision,boom of the judgment trump etc.; after years she slowly developed the thought tbat she migh; find some obscure niche where God would overlook her, and when tired of being all alone might find a boy who had also escaped, and they would be forever rich and happy on the abandoned food and goods. 13. F., 19. When in church or company often feels she will say some terribly wicked thing. 14. F., 18. Has a horror that never leaves her lest she should commit some awful sin; this comes out whenever she hears or reads anything particularly horrible. 15. F., 45. Is often seizedbythe fear that her senses may sud- denly leave her, she may hit some one and say or do something terrible; these fears are spasmodic. 16. F., 8.

F., 11. Went to camp meeting, joined the church, later thought herself a hypocrite, grew nervous, thin, sleepless, confessed everything she had even thought, imagined the end of all things, and long pondered whether she ought to go with the sheep or goats; finally she dreamed the end came and the sky was written overwith maps and names; she steppea aside into a corner be- tween the good andbad, and was unnoticed; these fears colored her temper and made her selfish. Little children often think the world is so made that their bad deeds are punished on the spot, 1; by getting hurt, 3; meeting a policeman, 5, 6; having the moon, 7, or a brick, 8, fall on them, or that an earthquake will come, 9, etc. They often test this and find it false, 2, or true, 3, 10. The dread, often spasmodic, of breaking out with bad acts or words, 13, 14, 15, indicates a lack of control, which is often the psycho- neural analogy of the more objectified dread that the ele- ments will break out, and the world end. These probably indicate more morbidity than the religious artefacts seen in 11, 12, 17, 18, although the two are often connected. The tendency to see rewards and punishments in weather, com- mon events, etc., is the root from which has sprung a vast body of religious superstition, but it represents a stage in the development of the moral consciousness that is indispen- sable to the growth of every conception of the universe as be- ing moral, and the disposition to test it is the same that when grown up suggests the prayer gauge. The pedagogy of ethics and religion waits for us to ascertain how to treat such factors. Very closely connected with these are the two following great groups: xxll. END OF THE WORLD. 1. F., 11. Has caught from neighbors the fear that the world will end in 1899; plans to do everything before then, and pictures how the event will occur. 2. F., 33. When 9, caught from Bible prophecies the way of in- terpreting current events as signs of the end; the world was arery wicked, God very angry, the longer the awful punishment waited the more dreadful it would be, and the more surely every little sin would be punished; what she liked best made God angriest; this cast a gloom over every day for years. 3. F., 18. No tongue could tell the anguish she suffered from this fear at a]l the little weather signs; it hurt her health. 4. F., 19. Long saw the end coming when the clouds or moon were red or fire bells rang; this fear was of great value, made her good and always ready to die.</page><page sequence="84">230 HATsT. 5. F. 22. This horror was intensified because she believed it woull come when no one was thinking of it, so felt everything hung on herkeeping it steadily in mind, and she always tried to keep awake nights. 6. M., 13. Dreaded it so hefeltit was hypocrisy to pray "Thy kingdom come," and so changed it. 7. F., 25. Thought the end would begin with a thunder storm, which would grow intense, and so had horror of these. 8. F., 16. Thought it would develop out of a hot spell. 9. M., 16. Saw signs of it in all the crimes in the newspaper. 10. M., 13. Saw itcoming in shooting stars. 11. F., 17. Thought things would freeze up, and so dreaded cold- 12. M., 10. This gave him horror of fires and even matches, le#t he might precipitate the end. 13. Fears of celestial collisions are often elaborately developed, and this gives many children intense interest in the weather. Like XIN and NN:, these fears are most frequent from 13 to 187 or during the early stages of the adolescent ferment, and objectify in the most interesting way the in#tability of its profound transformation. xxlll. GEOSTS, Probably the large majority of children pass at least a stage of fearing ghosts, although we had but 203 good cases. 1. F., 18. A# a girl for a time knew, thought, talked of nothing but ghosts; would imagine something heavy moving on her bed, fancy eyes, noises, and re-enact all the stories she had heard in a cold sweat and with hair on end. 2. F., 23. A college girl says no one can ever make me cease to believe in ghosts; I have done so since I was 2, and always shall. 3. F., 17. When she hears people say there are no ghosts she knows better, for she has seen one. 4. F.,17. Thought the house full of ghosts, that they were al- ways moving onthe stairs and in the halls, till she grew sickly; finally the servant who taught her was discharged; her father took her to a meeting of Spiritualists, and " they let him talk to his dead daughter Bertha through a tube; now he never had a daughter Bertha, and this cured me." 5. F., 23. When 8 was told she might meet the spirit of her mother, who died when she was 2 days old; she longed to see her, but was so afraid thatthereafter she would not look at her picture lest she should see her ghost, and everything about death and her mother became fearful. These fears must have taken their rise in the early human period. Dreams, hypnagogic images, trances, entoptic pro- jections upon the dimness of night, the dominance of retinal interpretatioll by other senses, the tricks of early priestcraft,</page><page sequence="85">the anthropomorphic vigor of primitive, visually thought imagination, and we know not what other factors of hope, love and fear have created a world of beings, more or less belief in which is now a stage in the development of nearly every human being, and the energy of persistence of which in the most cultured of adult minds now has the most refined and valuable documentation in the collections of the English Psychic-Research Society. For children who live with imagin- ary companions, for people who are haunted with a "sense of presence," or who have seen ghosts, 2, 3, all disillusioning tests like 4 are idle. That to the pre-potent bias which we all inherit from a savage human ancestry and which haunts the very nerves and pulses of the most cultured to believe in ghosts, is now, in these later psychogenic ages, added the passion for individual survival, which, although often har- ried by science, has steadily increased with every step in the progress of personal liberty, and with the growing sense of the worth of the individual in the universe and the integrity of consciousness, so that to use Eant' s phrase, the dreams of sight- seers are now explained by the dreams of metaphysicians;- this has caused one of the most formidable of all presuppo- sitions, the proper comprehension and utilization of which seems to await the avatar of some great genius in the psycho- pedagogico-religious field who shall reformulate the whole doctrine of immortality. If to the last three groups of fears we were to add the allied but more degraded forms of folk-lore among children, which will be reported on later, we should have rank remind- ers of a state of abject and craven Lucretian superstition strongly suggesting that which Lenormantl describes as per- haps the most primitive of all known religions, and most purely the product of fears, that of the Shumero-Accads, the predecessors of the ancient liebrews, where hosts of demons, ghosts, and the seven awful Maskim from the abyss always strive to bring confusion, subvert nature, spread disease and overwhelm man with terrors, against which he can only appeal to certain forms of conjuration and esorcism, and seek a friend in the sun as father of light, till slowl.y the idea of the unseen Elohim, the strong ones, quellers of these phantoms, is evolved, and the career is opened for the Eebrew mono- theism, wherein the power of good becomes stronger than all the demons. Whether all races of men have at some stage quailed and quaked with supine fear of spiritual or supernal agents, and how far primeval religions are born of fear, we "'La Magie et la Divination chez les (:7halddens," 1878.

We ought to fear things below uss and those above should attract and elevate and not degrade, as do most of the fear- born superstitions. XXIV. MORBID. L F., 18. A favorite horror is a rough looking man always peering through the window, or from behind chairst lounges, or under the table. 2. M., 12. Used to imagine some one waslookingathimthrough the register, and must always have it shut. 3. F. A teacher has foryears feared to see some one hanging from a beam or hook whenever she enters a vacant room; can as- sign no cause. 4. F. 18. Has from childhood hated to touch people, and never shakes lands if she can avoid it. 6. F., 17. Has a chronic fear she will not get enough to eat sometime; it is not poverty, but that there will not be enough. 6. M., 10. On reading of Joseph saving corn for the famine in Egypt, he began to save up bread, beans, potatoes, pop-corn, etc., under bed and wash-stand till their decay was offensive. 7. F. Ayoungwoman is pursued by the fear that there will #oon be no more wood, and that the coal mines are nearly e2r- hausted. 8. M., 12. Thinks the sun will be e2rhausted and go out. 9. M. A wealthy farmer fears poverty, borrows money and paysinterestonit,andkeepsitready if his home is taken away; his daughter and granddaughter have this fear. lo. M., 16. Has a morbid dread of being poisoned; rinses the glass three times when about to drink. 11. M., 17. Thought he was poisoned, fancied alltheprogressive symptoms, yet it was not quite real. 12. F., 19. Thought some one would catch her if she stirred when alone; counted ten before every movement, etc. 13. F., 25. A teacher suffered agonies of fear, about 6, for a year lest some one would break her ears, which she thought were glass. 14. F., 40. A college teacher got the idea that the steam asphalt roller was alive; it would puff, glide around and return in a bravado style as if saying, " Who are you?" Each time she thought the last till she feared it would jump on her; grew afraid of all street noises, thought teams would fall on her; gave up work and was cured. 15. F., 35. Teacher at about 10 got a horrid fear that she was under a spells was saying aloud everything in her heart; this gave place to fear of another spell that she could never put on clothes enough to be modest; this lasted years; people looked pityingly at her; thord came the fear that she was an idiot, and no one dared tell her; this horror still occasionally recurs.</page><page sequence="87">233 s STUDY OF FE A RS. 16.

In the early teens had long fears, especially when fatigued, of doing little things that would cause the death of others; misplacing medicines, dropping banrna peels, opening the door to burglars instead of callers, were favorite forms among very many. 17. F., 35. A college teacher would gaze at a frozen lake till she feared to go crazy; on the train the sight of ice made her desper- ate; the sight of running water impelled ber to do something to #top it. 18. F. Another lady teacher was made sick and fearful of many ills by the sight of snow. 19. Another by bright sunlight, and had to have a north room. 20.

In the above we recognize more or less developed forms of several of the familiar phobias of the te2rt-books, e. g., fear of points and edges, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38; fear of blood, 39, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49; of conflict, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44; of contact with dirt, or contagion, 4, 22, 23, 24, 25; foltie de doute, 12, 15, 16, 20; hypochondria, 13, 15, 21; illusion of sight, 1, 2, 14; of tastie, or possibly of persecution, 10, 11; morbid sensitive- ness to visual, 17, 18, 19, 20, or auditory, 27, 28, 29, 30, 51,</page><page sequence="89">235 A STUDY OF FE A RS. impressions; ba#eless fears of starvation, 5, 6; poverty, 9. We have classed a large group of our returns as morbid, con- formably to medical standards for adults, despite the fact that they show such symptoms to be far more common than is thought among children. To have any or even all of these fears and with considerable intensity, is not abnormal for them, but perhaps a sign of abounding vigor, provided only the re- ductives are forthcoming and speedily effective. In the absence of these they pelsist and increase until they inter- fere with self-control. The Herbart-Taine view that any or all impressions tend to grow to illusional intensity unless restrained by competing or opposite images, is convenient to illustrate the countless ways in which one fear restrains an- other. When the senses and fancy are at their strongest, and the " sum of arrest" largest, it is no more surprising that the balance is sometimes lost for a moment than that children fall in learning to walk. In most of the adult cases quoted above, the correctives were too weak, too late, or fatigued out of function. How often needless fears are due to overwork is illustrated by school fears, like 25 and 28 above, and the following: 2X2X V. SCHOOL FE A RS. 1. F., 9.

The physical expressions and symptoms of fear are very often mentioned in our returns, but in terms too popular and undiseriminating to have great value. 'The word creepy oc- curs 73 times, and is used mostly by females; words designat- ing weakness, or loss of power to speak, move paralysis, etc., 70 times; tremor, shaking of jaw, limbs, etc., 58 times; stiffening and rigidity, or tonic as distinct from clonic tenw sions, 50 times; pallor, 44 times; respiratory changes as holding the breath, panting, choking, deep breath, 43 times; heart action, palpitation generally, sometimes arrest of pul- sation, 42; chills, without mention of shivers, but often associated with "creepiness," 35; sweating or flllshing, 28; convulsive shock movements, 28; feeling unusually strong to fight or fl.y, 25; nausea, 21; shut eyes, cover face, or double up, 2t g fascinated or entranced, 12; transient blindness, deafness, or insensitiveness, 11; noises in ears, or flashes or colors? etc., in the eyes, 9. Three mention tendency to mic- burition or defecation. Young children scream and cry loudly. Three infants, frightened at dog and cat, spit at them, and general nervousness is common. Some of these expressions show some marks of being nascent excitement of once useful acts, bllt for others we have only conjectural explanations, like, e. g., Wundt's, that the face may redden to save the brain, etc. Ever since Marcel's great thesis on the subject in 1847, alcoholic delirium tremens has been generally recognized as embodying more of the strongest expressions of fear than any other known symptom-comple2r. Fear with most of its syn- dromes may enter through every sense and dominate every group of muscles, striated and nonstriated. Magnan, 1 l "Alcoholism and the Various Forms of Alcoholic Delirium," tr. London, 1876, pp. 33. See also his "Vortesz4ngen," 1891, Heft 1, XI.</page><page sequence="92">Ziehen,l Krapelin2 and others describe these symptoms as both extreme and characteristic. Especially in the prodromal stages of this form of acute ha]lucinatory paranoia, fears of animals of many kinds, bugs, spiders, worms, snakes, rats, dogs, lions and imaginary monsters play an important role. Dr. a. F. Hodge, after a prolonged and careful study of alcohol- ism in dogs, soon to be published, informs me that excessive fear is the most characteristic psychic mark of the inebriate dogs, distingllishing their acts and attitudes in every case from the non-alcoholic members of the same litter. Magnan has also shown how this cause may lead to delusions of per- secution, from the stage of general suspiciousness to the time when the victim turns on his imagined foes and from heing persecuted becomes a persecutor. Here is, no doubt, the best field for studying the manifestations of fear writ large, where disease of the higher level has caused denudation and put man mentally on all fours again. The dominant impression left by such a study as the above is that of the degrading and belittling effects of excessive fears. They suggest dew-claws, or the filmy castings or harder fossils of long since outgrown psychoses. A feeble boy of 1Q enumerates fifty-seven objects of which he has great fear, and adds that there are others he fears some. A girl of 12 feared the sun because it gave sun-stroke, clouds because of cloud-bursts, the moon because it might burst and fly, the sun lest it should get lost or burn us all, and cold weather lest ears and fingers should drop ofl, and her life activity was greatly restricted accordingly. A n ignorant but vigorous boy of 14 feared bubbles in puddles when it rained, thinking them devil's fingers, a forbidden bridge because told the bad man lived under it, scrubbed his neck clean because told that otherwise onions would grow in the dirt there and leave dan- gerous holes when pulled, feared to open the hydrant because told an ugly green snake would come out and bite him, and thought a telephone too dangerous to monkey with. A girl of 13, thought not abnormal, dreaded big eyes and robbers be- cause they were sneaky, all reptiles because they were creepy, northern lights because they were shivery, could not bare to to look at a picture of the crucifiction, nor enter the parlor alone for fear of a picture of hounds and a fos. For a girl of 17 all telegrams meant death; she dreaded to go out lest a comet should dash down, feared all women who wore big ear- rings, and a mythical black man who rode in a buggy with a sword, etc. Spring-heeled Jack, the Black Bull of Wild's "'Psychiatrie," 1894, p. 355. 2 psychiatrieXx 1893, p. 539- 238 TWAT,T.</page><page sequence="93">239 s STUDY OF FEARS. Hill, the Hairy Lunatic, the Ghost with Grizzly Gore, and unnumbered other fear-fetiches suggest that there may de- velop a passion for horrors and shudderings as strong as alcoholism. The courageous child will not succumb to fears, and has a passion for overcoming them. The imperfections of both the methods and results of all this work are very obvious, and everything depends on keeping them all in sight throughout. This cannot be said too dis- tinctly, emphatically, or too often. Most returns are not made by ezrperts, but by young people with little knowledge of psychology or of the dangers of loose and inaccurate state- ment, and who are peculiarly prone to exaggeration in describ- ing their feelings. Some returns are seen to be of no value, and are rejected at the start. Many of the floridly described fears are filmy and no doubt far less real than the language would indicate. Some, too, no doubt, are almost purely im- agined. The data have all degrees of value from nothing up to very great. Much, of course, depends on the common sense and experience of the person who does the preliminary sifting, and in this work the writer can only say he has done as well as he could. On tlhe other hand few psychic activities are so certain and real to those who experience them or so obvious in others as fear, while the dread of being thought timid or cowardly generally makes against confessions of it. Many hundred fears are reported by college or university students of psychology, by friends of the writer, in whose competence and reliability he has the greatest confidence, and particularly those from Miss Williams are made by a method calculated to eliminate very many at least of the pos- sible defects and errors. Whether the attempt to avoid all harmful suggestiveness in the questionnaire was successful or not, the reader can in part judge for himself. The few hun- dred cases printed are from what is thought to be among the more reliable of the vast body of returns, although chosen to show distribution rather than quality. Less fragmentary, fuller, more finished and much more valuable returns gener- ally would be those made by experts on their own children, individually studied, or on themselves. Indeed, almost any increment of expertness, medical, anthropological, psychia- tric, etc., and any degree of familiarity with the child up to companionship every hour of every day, would increase the value of observations. We are, however, happily past the stage of the tyro who would pronounce such well meant re- turns on such a topic wholly good or wholly worthless. Glimmerings of most of these fears nearly all have probably had, and these will always be one factor in their evaluation.</page><page sequence="94">240 HAT.T.: This latter I deem very high, and my own confidence in most of the data has, upon the whole and making all deductions, steadily increased with growing acquaintance with them. I have printed many because they show the fresh spontaneity, the genius of child and folk thought, and the rich suggestive- ness of my anthology of cases is to my reasonings about them as arethe sacred tezrts of ScripturetoBarnes' notes or Dod- ridge's commentaries. Even the simpler and more homely of them are nuciear and their photosphere is wide and bright. Some of them are almost perfect psychograms. I have tried to avoid not only the grout, but the adiaphora of the subject. Most of my comments and inferences, too, are of course in- tended more as suggestions than as finally formulated conclu- sions. Nothing is finished here, and little is conclusively proven. These rich fields are just opening to pioneer work, and the mining is first by surface methods, which are very diflerent from those at the bottom of the shafts, which further specialization is certain soon to sink. The processes of Eshcol grape gatherers are very diflerent from those of set- tled traffic on the main thoroughfare of psychology,which will soon traverse all this region. To keep all soft and plastic, and to retard inspissations or the secretion of too many hard parts, is imperative in order that everything be left open to this growth in all directions. This means, too, that crasser minds can sense nothing palpable in it all, and also that everything be left unprotected and open to attack; but the vitality is too protoplasmic to be easily impaired. Samples from the vast mass of data, according to the most objective rubrics under which they so readily grouped themselves, and then a glimpse atsome of the larger aspects and problems which all the data in hand, printed or unprinted, seemed to suggest, appeared at least a method worth trying on one of our topics. There is not a single group of fears that does not almost cry out for further investigation with the larger num- bers, better distribution over wider ranges of age, still further precautions and progressive exactness, the more practical pedagogic applications, etc., that will soon come. The present paper, too, merely touches a very few aspects only of this vast theme. Most current text-books on psychology contain little or nothing helpful on fear. Many of them barely mention it; others theorize on the symptoms popularly ascribed to it, using its common phenomena for picturesque illustrative ma- terial; others have much to say concerning feelings, instincts or emotions generally, but are not specific enough to discuss any single feeling in detail; others are chiefly concerned with</page><page sequence="95">241 A STUDY OF FEARS. nomenclature and definitions, or the place of fear, etc., in some scheme of psychic activities. What problem could better illustrate the crude schelastic stage of the contempo- rary psychology of feeling and emotion than the elaborate recent discussions of the problem whether they are the re- sults of tension of muscles, vessel-walls, etc., or the latter are primal and causative @ No problem is more unsolvable; hence some of its speculative charm. Solution, moreover, if it could ever come, would be attained in the very different direction of what Kirschmann used to call the method of further delineation and description, to which everything dis- coverable is sure to yield in the end. In text-books on psychiatry, phobias are less and less prominent, and the e]ements that once entered into this sylnptom-comples are usually distributed among other diseases. From Mosso'sl great yet charmingly popular work, which is largely devoted to descriptions of the physiological accompaniment of fear and to its expression, the impulse to further study has been less than was to have been expected. Miss Calkins2 tabu- lated the fears of 202 children, and found that in those under sis, sound fears predominated; out of 122 cases she classed 23 as innate and 9 more as inherited. Binet3 discusses 110 answers to a questionnaire on fear, but in a tentative, timid way, which is certainly all his data warrant. His conclasions that fear depends largely on the vividness of imagination and his pedagogic inferences, agree with our own better than does his opinion that the degree of intelligence has little to do with fear. Of the more theoretical discussions of fear, by far the best, as it seems to the writer, is that of E. M. Stanley,4 who is both fuller and far better then Ribot's Psychotogte des Senti- ments. The former conceives fear as anticipatory pain, the pre-perception of which constituted the first emotion, marked a great step upward, because it was the first utilization of past experience, and is the chief spur to know and do. Not only do the timid survive, but the suggestion of past pains gives power to anticipate and avoid danger. Fear, too, has its own pain, which is distinct from the pain of the object feared, but the former is less, and there is economy in the substitution. When fear is very intense, knowledge, which is anticipatory of it, breaks up in dissociation. There is 1 " Fear," by Angelo Mosso, tr., London and New York, 1896, pp. 2"The Emotional Life of C:hildren," by MaryWhitonC:alkins Pedagogical Seminary, Vol. III, 319-323. 3 "La Peur chez les Enfants," I'Annde Psychologique,1895, pp. 223-254. 4 4; Evolutionary Psychology of Feeling," chaps. VII and VIII.</page><page sequence="96">242 1:TAT.T.: much fear that does not rest on experience. Fears slowly become differentiated first in degree, as intense and evoking the greatest possible activity, or as slight. Here the personal differences are vast, as a phobometer that measured the satu- ration point at which all control was lost, would show. An- other individual difference is between those far and those near-sighted for fears. The law, "inversely as the distance," does not hold alike for all. Finally, awe and sublimity are perhaps the most refined forms of fear. From this larger view we see how essential to every soul, brute or human, fear has been. It is no less universal now. There is no one without fear, and those few who so emphati- cally disclaim all fear, and the psychologists who tabulate the percentages of fearless people, are thinking of shock or panic or acute fright, or special physical dread, etc., but not of the subtler forms, like fear of God, of dishonor, failure of their highest purposes, for themselves or others. Not only does everyone fear, but all should fear. The pedagogic prob- lem is not to eliminate fear, but to gauge it to the power of proper reaction. Fears that paralyze some brains are a good tonic for others. In some form and degree, all need it always. The difficulty is to adjust to the vast range of individualities and the very different stages of development. A true curricu- lum of fears would by no means omit all lower and more drastic forms, but be always intent on substituting its higher and wider ranged spurs for its more degraded and primary ones up to reverence and worship of the sublime and awe- inspiring. Here fear must be reduced, there abated, here made more tenuous, there more crass. We fear God better because we have feared thunder. Without the fear appara- tus in us, what a wealth of motive would be lost! Aristotle's conctsption of education as learning to fear in due proportion those things worthy of being feared, would not serve badly as a definition also of courage. Again, fears are necessary because they are the roots of so many of the strongest intellectual interests. Never is the child's charm in an object so great as at the moment when he is just getting the better of his fear of it. One of the chief spurs to knowledge and science i8 to overcome fear, and many of the things now best known are those t,hat, used to be most feared ( XX V1). To feel a given fear no longer over butbe- neath us, gives an esquisite joy of growth. Even love may begin in special timidity. Those reared under religious ter- rors are sometimes most irreverent, or if aufgeActart are especiallyfond of dissertating on old religious sanctities frons new found radical standpoints. With children foolhardiness is a favorite form of showing ofE. Fear is necessary first to</page><page sequence="97">243 s STUDY OF FEA RS. focalize attention and educate in concentration. Even food, perhaps, has less acuminating power. Whether to fly or fight is the problem, and adjustment must be ready for either. Interest involves a general act of the attention to an object with the pain element reduced, and curiosity is a form of interest. Complete knowledge often eliminates not only fear, but even reverence. Love does not cast out fear as if there were an amphiboly between them, nor yet as if fear were transpeciated into love, but a trace of fear toned down to respect lingers not as a mere favor, but as contributing a part of its essential reality to the object loved. As Fichte thought the ego posited its own self-limitations and then transcended them, we may conceive the soul as self-limited by object fears,which it transcends in knowledge and turns to again in interest and love, when both self, object, knowledge and love owe part of their actuality to the old radical fear. If pain is diminished action, and pleasure is greater perfection in action, then the tove of natural objects must be considered no less fully as the complementary part of this paper. The report devoted to this obverse side of the subject is essen- tially complete, and will soon appear, and only then can the reciprocal relations between love and fear be more fully treated, where, I think, it will appear that while fear is the mother of all superstitions, it is also the rudimentary organ on the full development and subsequent reduction of which many of the best things in the soul are dependent; that the philophobic thesis, antithesis and synthesis are essential biotonic motives, that a childhood too happy and careless and fearless is a calamity 80 great that prayer against it might stand in the old English service book beside the peti- tion that our children be not poltroons. Fear is pathic, obsessive, so concrete that it is no wonder it was long held to be a morbid entity, or even that Brown- Sequard thought he could inoculate its bacilli. In many forms of deliriums, especially tremens, fear is a dominant element. Horror even has its art,, as in Poe, Hoffmann, Wiert,z, etc. The timid do not resist, disease, and fear seems to invite it. So important did Pinel think it in psycho-neural disturbances that he always specially questioned every patient as to fears. Fears profoundly affect not, only the lives, but even the theories of great men, as in the case of lIobbes, and in a different way Schopenhauer. One of the very worst things about, excessive fear seems to me to be that it makes people selfish, profoundly and dominantly selfish, as few other things do. This and its frequent association with weakness lie at the root of the instinctive aversion to tell our fears. Few better indices of individual strength and of 7</page><page sequence="98">244 WAT.T.: soundness and vigor of heredity can be found than the phag- ocytic power of eliminating baser fears, or of incessantly working them over into higher forms. Bad and even dan- gerous as its grosser forms are, there is no possible way of developing the higher without them. Not e2rtermination, but education is the need. Every element of soul and body is a factor in determining how much and what kinds of the baser metal each individual can transmute into the higher. One fundamental assumption in this paper is that the es- perience of the individual, and even that of his nearer fore- bears, while it can explain many of the fear phenomena, more no doubt than most of our reporters think, cannot es- plain all. This view, like its opposite, it is impossible to demonstrate conclusively. The naked eye may be utterly unable to tell whether a light near the horizon comes from a fireside candle or a star. Psychic elements generally, and feelings particularly, are in some respects like the soft parts of animals of which the paleontologic record preserves but few traces. Interest in problems of the soul used to centre in its future state; now it centres in its present, the instan- taneous now, to which epistemological tendencies which give us an officinal psychology with no perspective would shut us up, or the larger present of the individual, or the historic period. Weismannism has, perhaps, also done something to countenance the disposition to make contemporary psychol- ogy a cross-section of the adult soul and to delay the full recognition of evolution in this field. It has had a limiting influence on psychology not without analogy to DesCartes' theory that animals were mere automata. This was, per- haps, well, for the study of the near should precede that of the far. But long before and after Plato, even in the church, doctrines of pre-existence of the soul were so inseparably bound up with those of post-existence or immortality that both stood or fell together, and from the metempsychosists to Wordsworth, from Clifford to Cope, paleopsychic or arch- a3sthetic views of many kinds have been strongly held. There seems now a growing sentiment toward a more unfrontiered standpoint, shonving that however different soul and body may be, they have been associated like twins from the first, so that if there have been metempsychoses there have been parallel metasomatoses, that as organization or brain is found increasingly comples, we must look well to it that our conceptions of soul do not leave it mean, parasitic, or even epigenetic, but make it no whit less involved and venerable than the body, with rudimentary and vanishing organs like it, and like the living soma subject to incessant change, to know the laws of which is the goal of psychology. As the</page><page sequence="99">s STUDY OF FEA:RS. 245 notochord, e. g., performs its function in the embryo and is transformed, 80 ve may find psychic functions or elements very important for a developmental stage, but with no trace in the mature mind, or we may have to postulate such, like, e. g., lIaeckal's fruitful hypothesis of the gastrea stage. In view of this I think we shall find among the most valu- able lines of new psychogenetic research that of what may be called the stages of forgetting. Like waning consciousness, lapsing memoryby no means involves degeneration, but is sometimesmost rapid at the very cone d'acoitssment. Per- haps we shall never know how, or even whether acquisitions, in growing automatic, pass to basal ganglia or down the mer- istic levels toward reproductive efficiency as knowledge be- comes cryptonoetic. That there is some such a tendency, however, few will doubt, and must we not hold that no acqui- sition is complete until it has somehow 80 pervaded the soma that the reproductive elements are modified These mod- ifications of heredity may have perhaps almost innumerable sub-threshold degrees before either consciousness or sponta- neous action would be directly caused. A 8 infants, although they cannot speak, yet, unlike apes, have a capacity to be taught language, 80 we must assume the capacity to fear or to anticipate pain, and to associate it with certain objects and experiences, as an inherited Antage, often of a far higher antiquity than we are wont to appeal to in psychology. To learn what to fear so as to fear wisely and effectively, al- though it is a school as old as the instinct of self-preserva- tion, i8 still a chief part of education. Again, as soft parts are always older than hard parts, and make or condition them, and the unicellular and protozoan forms of life are geologically older and more unchanging than the larger metazoan species, so faint stimuli from more con- stant causes must have been far commoner than strong ones. We may assume, too, that long repeated impressions through geologic ages would cause deeper and more durable effects than intense and infrequent ones, on a principle analogotls to the greater deterrent effect on crime of slight but certain pen- alties. Much of the education of germ plasma, as well as in cases discussed above in :KX, is by the method of frequent but faint iteration, often approaching almost constant tension. As in geology, again so here, the greatest results are often achieved by the slightest and slowest causes operating inces- santly. There is a peculiar prepotent quality about some of these fears that suggests some such ancient origin, and points to the persistency of cells or protoplasm rather than to the more formed and therefore more transformable tissues of later stages. As some cases of spontaneous blushing and of</page><page sequence="100">pavor nocturnus suggest the results of long ago shocks quite distinct from those other cases of parasitiic personality or of the submerged e2mperiences that hypnotism expis- cates from the unconscious depth of the soul, which point to more recellt shock fears, 80 the fears toned down to awe of the forest, of the gloaming of night, of the heavenly bodies, of solitude, etc., seem to bear the stigmata of antiquity. If we assume any backward perspective in the soul at all, of what else in it have we a better right to postulate age, self- evidenced as by first intention e Without assuming far wider ranges in the past, psychology can make but slow and hard progress in exploring feeling, instinct and the rich mines of unconsciousness just open- ing. The careful study of fear thus leads us to results that aid in the solution of some of the profoundest problems of mental life and are at variance with certain of the most ap- proved views of modern psychology. In his remarkable work on Salpal Professor Brooks thinks the deep sea bottom was discovered and colonized some time after life had been developed near the surface. Food was obtained easier, and sedentary life when once established there was more favor- able to growth and reproduction. We can now hardly con- ceive the capacity of the sea {loor for sustaining life, nor the rank abundance of it there in many vast areas, or the new forms that arise there. The instinct-feelings now opening to psychologists are such a bottom, far fuller of life and growth than all the surface phenomena of intelligence, where many forms originated? but now, as lapsed consciousness, hard to get at, our method, to carry out the faint and halting analogy, be- ing a new form of dredge, and fear like Salpa being a bypical form especially inviting a discussion of its relations to the evolution of the psychia life in general, which, however, we must here postpone. At every step the sense deepens that the conscious ego is but a very inadequate and partial mani- festation of the soul, that it is a feeble, flickering taper in a vast factory full of machinery and operatives, each doing its work in unobserved silence, and which the epistemological method of discussing the nature of light will never illuminate. The best of all evidences of the high antiquity oi the fear Anlage of the human soul rests not on any one fear groupt nor on the summated evidence of all together, but on the pro- portionalstrength of different fear elements and tendencies. Their relative intensity fits past conditions far better than it does present ones. Night is now the safest time, serpents "'Salpa," by W. E.

The weather fears and the incessant talk about weather (p. 177, and VI generally) fits a condition of life in trees, caves or tents, or at least of far greater exposure, and less protection from heat, cold, storm, etc., than present houses, carriages and even dress aiiord. Yet, again, the intensity of many fears, especially in youth, is out of all proportion to the exciting cause. The first e2rperiences with water, the moderate noise of the wind, or distant thunder, etc., might e2rcite faint fear, but why does it sometimes make chil^ dren on t.he instant frantic with panic e Must we llot conclude that, as Palmen found that the eider ducks in their annual migration from northern Ellrope to Africa crossed the Med- iterranean over wide and therefore more dangerous paths be- cause they fly where land used to be, and that their topo- graphic instincts are thus older than the present geological configuration of the old world, so the human instinct-feelings, incalculably more ancient than the intellect, have been felted and macerated into their present general form very gradu- ally by social telluric and cosmic influences, some of which still persist unchanged, bul; more of which have been either modified or are now estinct 8 Adjustment is thus one of the deepest problems of pedagogy. It is especially hard because the full scope of the more basal fears rarely comes to expres- sion in consciousness, but only partial aspects of them, as illustrated by the principle of fetichism, so akill to, if not at the root of the naming instinct, which eternally puts a part for the whole, underlies symbolism, make us cling to our categories after they have become mere clinkers in the ever burning fire of flus and change, of which body and mind are alike phases. The fact that some of these fears are so very tenuous that they almost seem to be nothing but {litting fancies, and have an air of such unreality as to suggest a distinct class of pseudo-phobias, and that we often say in reading them that we could have imagined, but never could have truly felt cer- tain of the fears above recorded, by no means disproves their antiquity, and can never do so till we know how much of the work of the imagination is purely creations out of nothing, and how much is in revivirIg obsolescent traces of remote experience. Beccari thinks each philum, although being very plastic for permanent and transmissible impressions in its early stages, loses this power, so that conservative heredity is the rule later, while the oldest traces are surest of</page><page sequence="102">248 H A J.T, : transmission. This strengthens the suggestion that the ol(lest psychoses would be likely to be the dimmest, despite their potency, and that the influence of earlier inheritance domi- nates that of later, still and small though its voice be. To make these all products of present experience is not unlike accounting for fossils on mountains as God-made, for it ignores not only their pecaliar structure, but a past of psy- choses radically diflerent from those of the present, function- ing under conditions no less changed. How much the true A ristotelian katharsis consists in very highly suggestive restoration of such far past conditions in conformity to a law that these traces must be re-excited as a necessary condition of their transformation to the next higher stage, as the soul " builds itself larger mansions," the ne2rt artiele will seek to show. Once more? if among our psychic functions fears are pecul- iarly liable to become morbid, they only follow the law of rudimentary organs of the body which are especially prone to become diseased. This point will have fuller treatment else- where. There is no normal organ or tissue which we do not inherit from an anthropoid ancestry. Besides organs at the ape2z of function iIl the adult, structures like the lanugo, polymasty, the coceygeal vertebra with both muscles and nerves that once moved a tail, the pineal gland, the nictitating mtsmbranes, ichthyosis and perhaps 120 other embryological forms, often hypertrophied in teratological cases, etc., now make a posi- tion like that of Agassiz, who saw the facts, but failed to see their significance, quite obsolete. No less so is sure soon to be that of those who in the presence of facts now so fast be- ing made known still fail to see that the doctrine of evollltion is just entering a new and higher psychic field, where it promises soon to give us a clear and simple doctrine of mind, the evidence of which is so plain that all can see, and which is thus fit to be the national philosophy of a democracy be- cause it does not depend on mystic or esoteric insight, but its obscurities are those of the subject matter itself, and not artefacts of method. As at great crises ill history, unhallowed ghosts stalk abroad from old graves, so just at the threshold of epochs in science, effete theories may be resurrected for a brief day. Surely these signs of better things do notfail U# now. One of the chief desiderata of psychology now i8 a function analogous to the Eantian criticism applied to the instinct- feelings to distinguish what is pure or transcendental in them from what is due to individual experience.

As Weismann to Locke, on the one hand, and as Spencer and Eimer to Leibnitz and Berkeley, on the other, so much greater is this problem than was Eant's.
