<plain_text><page sequence="1">1941] The Counter-Revolution of Science By F. A. v. HAYEK The age preferred the reignt of intellect to the reign of liberty.-Lord Acton. I. THE SOURCE OF THE SCIENTISTIc HUBRIS: L'ECOLE POLYTECHNI QUE NEVER will man penetrate deeper into error than whe-n he is continuing on a road which has led him to great success. And never can pride in the achievements of the natural sciences and confidence in the omnipotence of their methods have been more justified than at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and nowhere more so than at Paris where almost all the great scientists of the age con- gregated. If it is true, therefore, that the new attitude of man towards social affairs in the nineteenth century is due to the new mental habits acquired in the intellectual and material conquest of nature, we should expect it to appear where modern sciencie celebrated its greatest triumphs. In this we shall not be disappointed. Both the two great intellectual forces which in the course of the nineteenth century transformed social thought-modern socialism and that species of modern positivism, which we prefer to call scientism, spring directly from this body of professional scientists and engineers which grew up in Paris, and more particularly from the new institution which embodied the new spirit as no other, the Ecole polytechnique. It is well known that French Enlightenment was characterised by a general enthusiasm for the natural sciences as never yet known before. Voltaire is the father of that cult of Newton which later was to be carried to ridiculous heights by Saint-Simon. And the new passion soon began to bear great fruits. At first the interest concentrated on the subjects connected with Newton's great name. In Clairault and d'Alembert, with Euler the greatest mathematicians of the century, Newton soon found worthy successors who in turn were followed by Lagrange and Laplace, likewise giants. 9</page><page sequence="2">10 ECONOMICA [FEBRUARY And with Lavoisier, not only the founder of modern chemistry but also a great physiologist, and, to a lesser degree, with Buffon in biological science, France began to take the lead in all important fields of natural know- ledge. The great Encyclopeedia was a gigantic- attempt to unify and popularise the achievements of the new science, and d'Alembert's " Discours preliminaire " (I 754) to the great work, in which he attempted to trace the rise, progress and affinities of the various sciences, may be regarded as the Introduction not only to the work but to a whole period. This great mathematician and physicist did much to prepare the way for the revolution in mechanics by which towards the end of the century his pupil Lagrange finally freed it from all metaphysical concepts and restated the whole subject without any reference to ultimate causes or hidden forces, merely describing the laws by which the effects were con- nected.' No other single step in any science expresses more clearly the tendency of the scientific movement of the age or had greater influence or symbolic significance.2 Yet while this step was still gradually preparing in the field where it was to take its most conspicuous form, the general tendency which it expressed was already recognised and described by d'Alembert's contemporary Turgot. In the amazing and masterly discourses which the latter as a young man of 23 delivered at the opening and the closing of the session of the Sorbonne in 1750, and in the sketch of a Discourse on Universal History of the same period, he outlined how the advance of our knowledge of nature was accompanied throughout by a gradual emancipation from those anthropomorphic concepts which first led man to interpret natural phenomena after his own image as animated by a mind like his own. This idea, which was later to become the leading theme of positivism and was ultimately mis- applied to the science of man himself, was soon afterwards 1 D'Alenmbert was fully aware of the significance of the tendency he was supporting and anticipated later positivism to the extent of expressly condemning everything that did not alm at the development of positive truths and even suggesting that " all occupations with purely speculative subjects should be excluded from a healthy state as profitless pursuits ". Yet he did not include in this the moral sciences and even, with his master Locke, regarded them as a priori sciences comparable with mathematics and of equal certainty with it. See on all this G.

SCIENCE II widely popularised by President C. de Brosses under the name of fetishism,' the name under which it remained known till it was much later replaced by the expressions- anthro- pomorphism and animism. But Turgot went even further and, completely anticipating Comte in this point, described how this process of emancipation passed through three stages where, after supposing that natural phenomena were produced by intelligent beings, invisible and resembling ourselves, they began to be explained by abstract expressions such as essences and faculties, till at last " by observing reciprocal mechanical action of bodies hypotheses were formed which could be developed by mathematics and verified by experience."2 It has often been pointed out3 that most of the leading ideas of French Positivism had already been formulated by d'Alembert and Turgot and their friends and pupils Lagrange and Condorcet. For most of what is valid and valuable in that doctrine this is unquestionably true, although their positivism differed from that of Hume by a strong tinge of French rationalism. And, as there will be no oppor- tunity to go into this aspect more fully, it should perhaps be specially stressed at this stage that throughout the develop- ment of French positivism this rationalist element, probably due to the infltuence of Descartes, continued to play an important role.4 1 In his famous work Du cu.te des dieuxfet'ishes (I 760). 3 (Euvres de Turgot, ed. Daire, Paris, 1844, Vol. II, p. 656. Compare also ibid., p. 6o0I - See particularly the detailed analysis by Misch and the books by Schinz and Gouhier quoted on the previotus page, anid also M. Uta, La tbeorie du savoir dauls la philosophic d'Auguste Com,zte, Paris (Alcan), 1928. 4 To avoid giving a wrong impression it should perhaps also be stressed at this point that the Liberalismn of the French Revolution was of course not yet based on the understanding of the market nmechanism provided by Adamn Smith and the Utilitarians but rather on the Law of Nature and the rationalistic-pragmatic interpretation of social phenonmena which is essentially pre-Smithian and of which Rousseau's social contract is the prototype. One might indeed trace much of the contrast, which with Saint-Simon and Comte became an open opposition to classical economics, back to the differences which existed, say, between Montesquieu and Hume. Quesniay and Smnith, or Condorcet and Bentham. Those French economists who like Condillac or J. B. Say followed essentially the same trend as Smith never had an influence on Frenclh political thought comparable to that of Smith in England. The result of this was that the transition from the older rationalist views of society, which regarded it as a conscious creation of man, to the newer view which wanted to re-create it on scientific principles, took place in France without passing through a stage in which the working of the spontaneous forces of society was generally understood. The revolutionary cult of Reason was symptomatic of the general acceptance of the pragmatic conception of social institutions-the very opposite of that of Smith. And in a sense it would be as true to say that it was the same veneration of Reason as the universal creator which led to the triumphs of science that led to the new attitude to social problems as it is to say that it was the influence of the new habits of thought created by the triumphs of science and technology. If socialism is not a direct child of the French Revolution, it springs at least from that rationalism which distinguished nmost of the French political thinkers of the period from the contemporary English liberalism of Hume and Smith and (to a lesser clegree) Benithami andl the philosophical Radicals.</page><page sequence="4">I2 ECONOMICA [FEBRUARY It must be pointed out however that these great French thinkers of the eighteenth century showed scarcely any trace yet of that illegitimate extension to the phenomena of society of scientistic methods of thought which later became so characteristic of that School-excepting perhaps certain ideas of Turgot about the philosophy of history and still more so some of Condorcet's last suggestions. But none of them had any doubt about the legitimacy of the abstract and theoretical method in the study of social phenomena and they were all staunch individualists. It is particularly interesting to observe that Turgot, and the same is true of David Hume, was at the same time one of the founders of positivism and of abstract economic theory, against which positivism was later to be employed. But in some respects most of these men unwittingly started trains of thought which produced views on social matters very different from their own. This is particularly true of Condorcet. Mathematician like d'Alembert and Lagrange, he definitely turned to the theory as well as to the practice of politics. And although to the last he understood that " meditation alone may lead us to general truths in the science of man ",' he was not merely anxious to supplement this by extensive observation but occasionally expressed himself as if the method of the natural sciences were the only legitimate one in the treatment of the problems of society. It was particularly his desire to apply his beloved mathematics, especially the newly developed calculus of probability, to his second sphere of interest, which led him to stress more and more the study of those social phenomena which would be objectively observed and measured.2 As early as 1783, in the oration at his reception into the Acadimie, he gave expression to what was to become a favourite idea of positivist sociology, that of an observer to whom physical and social phenomena would appear in the same light, because, " a stranger to our race, he would study human society as we study those of the beavers and bees ".3 And although he admits that this is an unattain- able ideal because " the observer is himself a part of human society ", he repeatedly exhorts the scholars " to introduce I See his Esquisse d'ssts tableau bistorique des progres de 1'esprit busnaiss (1793), ed. 0.

The most seminal of his suggestions however occurs in his Sketch of a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind, the famous Testament of the Eighteenth Century as it has been called, in which the unbounded optimism of the age found its last and greatest expression. Tracing human progress in a great outline through all history, he conceives of a science which might foresee the future pro- gress of the human race, accelerate and direct it.2 But to establish laws which will enable us to predict the future, history must cease to be a history of individuals and must become a history of the masses, must at the same time cease to be a record of individual facts but must become based on systematic observation.3 Why should the attempt to base on the results of the history of the human race a picture of its future destiny be regarded as chimerical ? " The only foundation for the knowledge of the natural sciences is the idea that the general laws, known or unknown, which regulate the phenomena of the Universe, are necessary and constant; and why should that principle be less true for the intellectual and moral faculties of man than for the other actions of nature ? "4 The idea of natural laws of historical development and the collectivist view of history were born, merely as bold suggestions, it is true, but to remain with us in a continuous tradition to the present day.5 2 Condorcet himself became a victim of the Revolution. But his work guided to a large extent that same Revolution, particularly its educational reforms, and it was only as a result of these that towards the beginning of the new century the great institutionalised organisation of science arose which saw not only one of the most glorious periods of 1 Condorcet, Rapport et projet de decret sur l'organisation gnetnrale de l'instruction puiblique (1792), ed.

As is so often the case with similar movements, it was only in the second or third generation that the mischief was done by the pupils of the great men exaggerating and misapplying the ideas of their masters beyond their proper limits. In three respects the direct consequences of the Revolu- tion are of special interest to us. In the first place the very collapse of the existing institutions called for immediate application of all the knowledge which appeared as the concrete manifestation of that Reason which was the Goddess of the Revolution. As one of the new scientific journals which sprang up at the end of the Terror expressed it: " The Revolution has razed everything to the ground. Government, morals, habits, everything has to be rebuilt. What a magnificent site for the architects ! What a grand opportunity of making use of all the fine and excellent ideas that had remained speculative, of employing so many materials that could not be used before, of rejecting so many others that had been obstructions for centuries and which one had been forced to use."' The second consequence of the Revolution which we must briefly consider is the complete destruction of the old and the creation of an entirely new scholastic system which had profound effects on the outlook and general views of the whole next generation. The third is more, particularly the foundation of the Ecole Polytechnique. The Revolution had swept away the old educational system of coll?ges and universite's based largely on classical education, and after some short-lived experiments replaced them in 1795 by the new ecoles centrales which became the sole centres of secondary education.2 In conformity with the ruling spirit and by an over-violent reaction against the older schools, the teaching in the new institutions was for some years almost entirely confined to the scientific subjects. Not only the ancient languages were reduced to a minimum and in practice almost entirely neglected, even the instruction in literature, grammar, and history was very inferior and moral and religious instruction, of Quoted by Gouhier, La jeunesse d'Auguset Comnte, Vol. II, p. 3 I, from the Dicade philo- sophique, Vol. I, 1794. 2 See E. Allain, L'cuvre scolaire de la Revolution, 1789-1802, Paris, I89I; C. Hippeau, L'instruction puiblique en France pendant la Revolution, Paris, s883 and F.

Although after some years a new reform endeavoured to make good some of the gravest deficiencies2 the interruption of the instruction in those subjects for a series of years was sufficient to change the whole intellectual atmosphere. Saint-Simon described this change in I8I2 or I813: " Such is the difference in this respect between the state of . . . even thirty years ago and that of to-day that while in those not distant days, if one wanted to know whether a person had received a distinguished education, one asked: 'Does he know his Greek and Latin authors well ? ', to-day one asks: 'Is he good at mathematics ? Is he familiar with the achievements of physics, of chemistry, of natural history, in short, of the positive sciences and those of observation ? ' '"3 Thus a whole generation grew up to whom that great storehouse of social wisdom, the only form indeed in which an understanding of the social processes achieved by the greatest minds is transmitted, the great literature of all ages, was a closed book. For the first time in history that new type appeared which as the product of the German Realschule and of similar institutions was to become so important and influential a figure in the later nineteenth and the twentieth century: the technical specialist who was regarded as educated because he had passed through difficult schools but who had little or no knowledge about society, its life, growth and problems and its values, which only the study of history, literature and languages can give. 3 Not only in secondary education but still more so in higher education the Revolutionary Convention had created a new type of institution which was to become permanently established and a model imitated by the whole world, the Ecole Polytechnique. The wars of the Revolution and the help which some of the scientists had been able to render in the production of essential supplies4 had led to a new appreciation of the need of trained engineers, in the first instance for military purposes. But industrial advance also ' See E. Allain, op.

Scientific and techno- logical progress created a widespread enthusiasm for technological studies, which expressed itself in the foundation of such societies as the Societe philotechnique and the Societe polytechnique.1 Higher technical education had till then been confined to specialised schools such as the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees or the various military schools. It was at one of the latter that G. Monge, the founder of descriptive geometry, Minister of Marine during the Revolution and later friend of Napoleon, taught. He sponsored the idea of a single great school in which all classes of engineers should receive their training in the subjects they had in common.2 He communicated that idea to Lazare Carnot, the " organiser of victory ", an old pupil of Monge and him- self no mean physicist and engineer. These two men impressed their stamp on the new institution which was created in 1794. The new Ecole Polytechnique was (against the advice of Laplace4) to be devoted mainly to the applied sciences-in contrast to the Ecole Normale, created at the same time and devoted to theory-and remained so during the first ten or twenty years of its existence. The whole teaching centred, to a much higher degree than is still true of similar institutions, around Monge's subject, descriptive geometry, or the art of blue-print making, as we may call it without injustice to show its special significance for engineers.5 First organised on essentially civilian lines, the See Gouhier, La jeunesse d'Auguste Goittte, Vol. II, p. 54. 2On the foundation and history of the Ecole Polytechnique see A. Fourcy, tlistoire de l'Ecole Polytechnique, Paris, s828; G. Pinet, Histoire de l'Ecole Polytechzique, Paris, i887; G.-G. J. Jacobi, Ueber die Pariser polytechnische Schule (Vortrag gehalten anl 2Z.

Schnabel, Die Anlofatge des technischen Hochschulwesei s, Stuttgart, 1925. 3 Carnot had published in 1783 an Essay on Machines in General (in the second edition of I803 called Principesfondamentaux de l'equilibre du 7znouvement) in which he not only expounded Lagrange's new view of mechanics but developed the idea of the " ideal machine " which takes nothing away from the force which puts it into motion. His work did much to prepare the way for that of his son, Sadi Carnot, " the founder of the Science of Energy ". His younger son, Hippolyte, was the leading member of the Saint-Simonian group and actual writer of the Doctrine de Saint-Simon which we shall meet later. Lazare Carnot, the father, had been a life- long admirer and protector of Saint-Simon himself. As Arago reports of Lazare Carnot, he " always discoursed with [Arago] on the political organisation of society precisely as he speaks in his work of a machine ". See F. Arago, Biographies of Distinguished Men, transl. by W. H. Smith, etc., London, I857, pp. 300-304, and E.

Yet in spite of the limitations as to the subjects taught, and the even more serious limitation on the previous educa- tion of the students in its early years, the Ecole commanded from the very beginning a teaching staff probably more illus- trious than any other institution in Europe has had before or since. Lagrange was among its first professors, and although Laplace was not a regular teacher there, he was connected with the school in many ways, including the office of chair- man of its council. Monge, Fourier, Prony, and Poinsot were among the first generation of teachers of mathematical and physical subjects; Berthellot, who continued the work of Lavoisier, and several others hardly less distinguished,2 taught chemistry. The second generation which began to take over early in the new century included such names as Poisson, Ampere, Gay-Lussac, Thenard, Arago, Cauchy, Fresnel, Malus, to mention only the best known, inci- dentally nearly all ex-students of the Ecole. The institution had only existed for a few years when it had become famous all over Europe, and the first interval of peace in I80I-2 brought Volta, Count Rumford and Alexander von Humbold on pilgrimage to the new temple of science. 4 This is not the place to speak at length of the conquest of nature associated with these names. We are only con- cerned with the general spirit of exuberance which they engendered, with the feeling which they created that there were no limits to the powers of the human mind and to the extent to which man could hope to harness and control all the forces which so far had threatened and intimidated him. Nothing perhaps expresses more clearly this spirit than Laplace's bold idea of a world formula which he ex- pressed in a famous passage of his Essai philosophique sur les Probabilite's: "A mind that in a given instance knew all the forces by which nature is animated and the position 1 G.-G.

Jacobi, I.c., p. 370- 2 Fourcroy, Vauquelin, Chaptal.</page><page sequence="10">I 8 ECONOMICA [FEBRUARY of all the bodies of which it is composed, if it were vast enough to include all these data within his analysis, could embrace in one single formula the movements of the largest bodies of the Universe and of the smallest atoms; nothing would be uncertain for him; the future and the past would be equally before his eyes."' This idea, which exercised so pro-found a fascination2 on generations of scientistically- minded people is, as is now becoming apparent, not only a conception which describes an unattainable ideal, but in fact a quite illegitimate deduction from the principles by which we establish laws for particular physical events. It has been shown by modern logical analysis to be itself a piece of " metaphysical speculation ".3 It has been well described how the whole of the teaching at the Ecole Polytechnique was penetrated with the positivist spirit of Lagrange and all the courses and the textbooks used were modelled on his example.4 Perhaps even more important, however, for the general outlook of the poly- technicians was the definite practical bent inherent in all the teaching, the fact that all the sciences were taught mainly in their practical applications and that all the pupils looked forward to using their knowledge as military or civil engineers. The very type of the engineer with his characteristic outlook, ambitions, and limitations was here created. That synthetic spirit which would not recognise sense in anything that had not been deliberately constructed, that love of organisation that springs from the twin sources of military and engineering practices,, the asthetic predilec- tion for everything that had been consciously constructed over -anything that had " jest growed ", was a strong new element which was added to-and in the course of time even began to replace-the revolutionary ardour of the young polytechnicians. The peculiar characteristics of this 1 Laplace, Essai philosophique sur les probabilit's (I8I4), edition Les Maitres de la Peusde Scientifique, Paris, I92I, p. 3. 2 Cf. for instance the reference to it in Abel Transon, De la religion Saint-Simonienne.

They little concerned themselves with problems of man and society.5 This was the province of another group of men, in their time no less influential and admired, but whose efforts to continue the eighteenth century traditions in the social sciences were in the end to be swamped by the tide of scientism and silenced by political persecution. It was the misfortune of the idiologues, as they called themselves, that their very name should be perverted into a catchword describing the very opposite from what they stood for, and that their ideas should fall into the hands of the young engineers who distorted and changed them beyond recog- nition. 5 It is a curious fact that the French scholars of the time of which we are speaking should have been divided into two " distinct societies which had only one single trait in 1 E.

The second was the group of physiologists, biologists and psychologists, mostly connected with the Ecole de Medecine and known as the Ideologues. Not all of the great biologists of which France could boast at the time belonged to this second group. At the Coll?ge de France, Cuvier, the founder of comparative anatomy and probably the most famous of them, stood close to the pure scientists. The advances of the biological sciences as expounded by him contributed perhaps as much as anything else to create the belief in the omnipotence of the methods of pure science. More and more problems that had seemed to evade the powers of exact treatment were shown to be conquerable by the same methods.2 Other biologists, who at least since have become equally famous, Lamarck and St. Hilaire, remained at the periphery of the ideologist group and did not concern themselves much with the study of man as a thinking being. But Cabanis and Main de Biran, with their friends Destutt de Tracy and Deg6rando, made the latter the central problem of their labours. Ideology,3 in the sense in which the term was used by that group, meant simply the analysis of human ideas and of human action, including the relation between man's physical and mental constitution.4 The expression was indeed used in very much the same wide sense as their German contemporaries used the term anthropology.5 The 1 See Arago, EEuvres, Vol. II, p. 34, where he points out that Ampere (a physiologist by training) was one of the few connecting links between the two groups. 2 On Cuvier's influence see the account in J. T. Merz, A History of European Thought int the Ninteteenth Century, Vol. I, I906, pp. 136 et seq., where the following characteristic passage is quoted (p. 154) from Cuvier's Rapport historique sur le progres des sciences naturelles depuis 1789, Paris, I81C), p. 389: " Experiments alone, experiments that are precise, made with weights, measures and calculation, by comparison of all suibstances employed and all substances obtained; this to-day is the only legitimate way of reasoning and demonstration. Thus, though the natural sciences escape the application of the calculus, they glory in being subject to the mathematical spirit, and by the wise course they have invariably adopted, they do not expose themselves to the risk of taking a backward step ". 3 A. C. Thibaudeau (Bonaparte and the Consulate, I834, English translation by G. K. Fortescue, 1908, p. I53) points out that, although the terms 'ideologues' and 'ideologie', commonly ascribed to Napoleon, were introduced as technical terms by Destutt de Tracy with the first volume of hisElimentsd'Ideologie, published in iSoI, atleast the word 'ideologie' wNas known in French as early as I684. 4 On the whole ideological school see the comprehensive exposition in F.

And althouglh there was much talk among them about applying the methods of natural science to man, this meant no more than that they proposed to study man without prejudices and with- out nebulous speculations about his end and destiny. But this prevented neither Cabanis nor his friends from devoting a large part of their life work to that analysis of human ideas which gave ideology its name. Nor did it occur to them to doubt the legitimacy of introspection. If the second head of the group, Destutt de Tracy, proposed to regard the whole of ideology as part of zoology,' this did not prevent him from confining himself entirely to that part of it which he called ideologie rationelle, in contrast to the ide'ologie physiologique, and which consisted of logic, grammar and economics.2 It cannot be denied that in all this, out of their enthusiasm for the pure sciences, they used many misleading expressions which were grossly misunderstood by Saint-Simon and Comte. Cabanis in particular stressed repeatedly that physics must be the basis of the moral sciences3 ; but with him too this meant no more than that account must be taken of the physiological bases of mental activities, and he always recognised the three separate parts of the " science de l'homme ", physiology, analysis of ideas, and morals.4 But, in so far as the problems of society are concerned, while Cabanis' work remained mainly programmatic in character, Destutt de Tracy made very important contribu- tions. We need here concern ourselves only with one: his analysis of value and its relation to utility, where, proceeding from the foundations laid by Condillac, he went very far in providing what classical English political economy lacked and what might have saved it from the impasse into which it got-a correct theory of value. Destutt de Tracy (and Louis Say, who later continued his work) may indeed be said to have anticipated by more than half a century what Picavet, i.,. p. 337- 2 Ibid., p. 314- 3 Ibid., p. z5o. Also see pp. 131-5, where Cabanis' predecessor in these efforts, Volney, is discussed. In 1793, Volney had published a Catdchisme du Citoyen Franfais, later to become La loi naturelle ou les principes physiques de la morale in which he unsuccessfully attempted to create morals as a physical science. 4 Ibid., p. azz6</page><page sequence="14">22 ECONOMICA [FEBRUARY was to become one of the most important advances of social theory, the subjective (or marginal utility) theory of value.1 It is true that others outside their circle went miuch further in the application of the technique of the natural sciences to social phenomena, particularly the Societe des Observateurs de I'Homme, which, largely under Cuvier's influence, went some way in confining social study to a mere recording of observa- tions reminiscent of similar organisations of our own day.2 But on the whole there can be no doubt that the ideologues preserved the best tradition of the eighteenth century philosophes. And while their colleagues at the Ecole Poly- technique became the admirers and friends of Napoleon and received from him all possible support, the ideologues remained staunch defenders of individual freedom and incurred the wrath of the despot. 6 It was Napoleon who gave currency to the word ideologue in its new sense by using it as a favourite term of contempt for all those who ventured to defend freedom against him.3 And he did not content himself with abuse. The man who understood better than any of his imitators that " in the long run the sword is always beaten by the spirit " did not hesitate to carry his " repugnance for all discussion and 'On Destutt de Tracy see H.

See the passage from Napoleon's reply to the Council of State at its session of December 2oth, i8 i, quoted by Pareto (Mind and Society, Vol. III, p. I244) from the Moniteur universel, Paris, December 2zst, s8iz: "All the misfortunes that our beautiful France has been expenenc- ing have to be ascribed to ' ideology ', to that cloudy metaphysics which goes ingeniously seeking first causes and would ground legislation of the peoples upon them instead of adapting laws to what we know of the human heart and the lessons of history. Such errors could only lead to a regime of men of blood and have in fact done so. Who cajoled the people by thrusting upon it a sovereignty it was unable to exercise ? Who destroyed the sacredness of the laws and respect for the laws by basing them not on the sacred principles of justice, on the nature of things and the nature of civil justice, but simply on the will of an assembly made up of individuals who are strangers to any knowledge of law, whether civil, administrative, political or military ? When a man is called upon to reorganise a state, he must follow principles that are forever in conflict. The advantages and disadvantages of the different systems of legislation have to be souight in history." See also H. Taine, Les originies de la France contemporaine, 1876, Vol. I1, pp. 214-233. Not because of its questionable historical correctness, but in order to show how all this appeared to the next generation, the following characteristic statement by a leading Saint-Simonian may be quoted: " Apres 1793, I'Acadfmie des Sciences prend le sceptre; les matbimaticienrs et physiciens remplacent les litt6rateurs: Monge, Fourcroy, Laplace ... rbgnent dans le royAmume de- l'intelligence.

Say, a member of the ideologist group and for some years editor of its journal, the De'cade philosophique, was one of the first to feel the strong hand. Wheni he refused to change a chapter in his Traite' d'economie politique to suit the wishes of the dictator, the second edition was pro- hibited and the author removed from the tribunat.2 In i 8o6 Destutt de Tracy had to appeal to President Jefferson to secure the publication of at least an English translation of his Commentaire sur l'Esprit des lois which he was not allowed to publish in his own country.3 A little earlier (I803) the whole of the second class of the Acadimie, that of the moral and political science, had been suppressed.4 In consequence, these subjects remained excluded from the great Tableau de l'etat et des progres des sciences et des arts depuis 77 which the three classes of the Academie had been ordered to furnish in i802. This was symbolic of the whole position of these subjects under the Empire. The teaching of them was prevented and the whole younger generation grew up in ignorance of the achievements of the past. The door was thus opened to a new start unen- cumbered by the accumulated results of earlier study. Social problems were to be approached from a new angle. The methods, which since d'Alembert had so successfully been used in physics, whose character had now become explicit, and which more recently had led to similar results in chemistry and biology, were now to be applied to the science of man. With what results we shall gradually see. II. THE ACCOUCHEUR D'IDEES": HENRI DE SAINT-SIMON 1 Early training and experience can hardly be said to have, qualified the count Henri de Saint-Simon for the r6le of a scientific reformer. But it must be admitted that when in I798, at the age of 38,5 he took up his abode opposite the Ecole Polytechnique, henceforth to interpret to the world the significance of scientific progress for the study of society, he was unquestionably even then a man of rich and varied I See A.

The facts of his earlier life, only quite recently brought to light,' are considerably less elevating than the numerous anecdotes which he himself and his pupils have transmitted to us and which until lately formed almost our sole informa- tion about his youth. The legends tell us that he descended from Charlemagne, that d'Alembert supervised his educa- tion, and that his valet had orders to wake the ambitious young man daily with the words: Levez-vous, Monsieur le Comte, vous avez de grandes choses a faire. All this is not altogether impossible. It is certain, however, that for the first twenty years of his adult life he lived the life of an adventurer, as many sons of aristocratic families must have done during the period, but on a scale and with an intensity that probably surpassed those of most of his contemporaries. Almost as soon as he obtained a commission in the French Army he followed Lafayette to America and when, after four years, fighting ceased, he bade farewell to his pro- fession. Even before this we find him dreaming of piercing the Isthmus of Panama. A little later he offered his services in Holland for an expedition against the British Indies and was also concerned more concretely with projects of canals in Spain. The Revolution found him back in Paris, as the citoyen Bonhomme, forswearing his title and acting as an extreme Sansculotte. But soon more profitable oppor- tunities offered themselves. In the sale of the church lands we find him as one of the most active intermediaries, speculating with borrowed money on a colossal scale, one of the great profiteers of inflation, who did not scorn any business that came his way, such as an attempted sale of the lead from the roofs of Notre Dame. It is not surprising to find him in prison during the terror. It was during the time he spent there that he says he decided on a career as a philosopher. But, released, he once more preferred financial to metaphysical speculation. So long as the source of funds (a Saxon diplomatist) continued to provide him with sufficient capital, he tried his hand at all sorts of commercial ventures, such as organising a stage coach service, selling wine retail, manufacturing textiles and 1 See H. Gouhier, La jeunesse d'Aiiguste Comnte et la formation dis positivisme, Vol. II, Saint Simon jusqu'd la restaurationt, Paris, 1936, which for the first forty-five years of Saint-Simon's life stupersedes all earlier biographies, including the best of them, G.

His plans were even more ambitious. He seems to have begun the construction of some large industrial plant and he certainly dreamt of a combined commercial and banking enterprise that " should be unique in the world ". He also acted as spokesman for French financial interests at the Anglo-French discussions at Lille in I797. All these activities, however, came to a sudden end when in I798 his partner returned to Paris and asked to see the accounts. Saint-Simon certainly knew what high living meant, and his house, run by the former ma'tre d'hotel of the Duc de Choiseul, and his kitchen, presided over by an equally reputed chef, were famous. But that all the costs of this should have gone down as expenses on the joint account rather upset the good Saxon count. He withdrew his funds, and Saint-Simon, still in possession of a fortune, substantial but no longer adequate to support further grandiose ventures, found it advisable to withdraw from commercial activity and henceforth to seek glory in the intellectual sphere. We need not doubt that in the mind of the disappointed faiseur vague plans for the reorganisation of society were already formiing; and it is not surprising that he should soon find that all his experiences had not provided him with the knowledge which would enable him to elaborate these ideas. He therefore decided " to employ his money to acquire scientific knowledge ".1 It was at this time that he spent three years in close contact with the teachers and students of the Ecole Polytechnique as a kind of Maecenas-pupil, feasting the professors and assisting the students, one of whom, the great mathematician Poisson, he maintained for years and regarded as his adopted son. The method of study which Saint-Simon chose for him- self was not of the ordinary. Feeling that his brain was no longer elastic enough to pursue a systematic course, he preferred to learn what he could in the more pleasant form of dinner-table conversation. He asked the scholars of whose knowledge he hoped to profit to his house, and appears even to have married for the sole purpose of keeping a house where he could properly entertain the great savants. 1 " J'ai employe mon argent a acquerir de la science; grande chere, bon vin, beaucoup d'empressements vis-6-vis des professeturs auxquels ma bourse etait ouverte, ine procuralent toultes les facilit6s que je pouivais d6sirer ".

Yet this method of study seems to have proved to be of questionable value. At any rate in later life our hero complained to a friend that his " scholars and artists ate much but talked little. After dinner I went to sit down in an easy chair in a corner of the salon and fell asleep. Fortunately Madame de Saint-Simon did the honneurs with much grace and esprit."' Whether it was merely that he became aware that this had been a bad investment and decided to cut the losses, or whether it was that another marriage appeared to him a more attractive method of instruction, but not only the dinners but also the marriage came to an end soon after he had moved to the new place. He explained to his wife that " the first man of the world ought to be married to the first woman " and that, therefore, with much regret he had to ask her to be released. Was it an accident that the divorce was effected in the month after Madame de Stael had become a widow, the Madame de Stael who, in a book that had fired Saint-Simon's imagination, had only just celebrated the " positive sciences " and emphasised that tlhe "science of politics was yet to be created" ?2 It is alleged that as soon as he was free he lhurried to Le Coppet on the Lake of Geneva and proposed in the following words: "' Madame, you are the most extraordinary woman on earth and I am the most extraordinary man; together we shall undoubtedly produce a still more extraordinary child." Legend adds that he also proposed that they should cele- brate their nuptials in a balloon. About the terms in which the refusal was couched the versions vary. 2 The visit to Switzerland was also the occasion of Saint- Simon's first publication. In I803 there appeared in Geneva the Lettres d'un habitant de Geneve a ses contemporains,3 a I Leon Halevy, " Souvenirs de Saint-Simon, " La France litteraire, March, 1832, partially reproduced by G.

It begins by proposing that a subscription should be opened before the tomb of Newton to finance the project of a great " Council of Newton " for which each subscriber is to have the right of nominating three mathematicians, three physicists, three chemists, three physiologists, three litte'rateurs, three painters and three musicians." The twenty-one scholars and artists thus elected by the whole of mankind, and presided over by the mathematician who received the largest number of votes,2 become in their collective capacity the repre- sentatives of God on earth,3 who deprives the Pope, the cardinals, bishops and the priests of their office because they do not understand the divine science which God has entrusted to them and which some day will again turn earth into paradise.4 In the divisions and sections into which the supreme Council of Newton will divide the world, similar local Councils of Newton will be created which will have to organise worship, research and instruction in and around the temples of Newton which will be built everywhere.5 Why this new "social organisation ", as Saint-Simon calls it for the first time in an unpublished manuscript of the same period ?6 Because we are still governed by people who do not understand the general laws that rule the universe. It is necessary that the physiologists chase from.. their company the philosophers, moralists and metaphysicians just as the astronomers have chased out the astrologers and the chemists have chased out the alchemists ".7 The physiologists are competent in the first instance because " we are organised bodies; and it is by regarding our social relationships as physiological phenomena that I have conceived the project which I present to you."8 But the physiologists themselves are not yet quite scientific A.

They have yet to discover how their science can reach the perfection of astronomy by basing itself on the single law to which God has subjected the universe, the law of universal gravitation.' It will be the task of the Council of Newton by exercising its spiritual power to make people understand this law. Its tasks, however, go far beyond that. It will not only have to vindicate the rights of the man of genius, the scientists, the artists and all the people with liberal views2; it will also have to reconcile the second class of people, the proprietors, and the third, the people without property, to whom Saint-Simon addresses himself specially as his friends and whom he exhorts to accept this proposal which is the only way to prevent that "struggle which, from the nature of things, necessarily always exists between " the two classes.3 All this is revealed to Saint-Simon by the Lord himself, who announces to His prophet that He has placed Newton at His side and entrusted him with the enlightenment of the inhabitants of all planets. The instruction culminates in the famous passage from which much of later Saint-Simonian doctrine springs: "All men will work; they will regard themselves as labourers attached to one workshop whose efforts will be directed to guide human intelligence according to my divine foresight. The supreme Council of Newton will direct their works."4 SaintSimon has no qualms about the means that will be employed to enforce the instructions of his central planning body: "' Anybody who I O.S.S.E, XV, pp. 39-40, 55 (39, 6I). The passage in which Saint-Simon praises the significance of that universal law is a curious aniticipation of Laplace's famous wvorld formula (ibid., p. 59 (67)): " Faites la supposition que vous avez acquis connoissance de la maniere dont la matiere s'est trouv6e repartie a une epoque quelconque, et que vous avez fait le plan de l'Univers, en d6signant par des nombres la quantite de matiere qui se trouvoit contenue dans chacune des ces parties, il sera clair a vos yeux qu'en faisant sur ce plan d'application de la loi de la pesanteur universelle, vous pourriez predire (aussi exactement que l'etat des connoissances mathematiques vous le permettroit) tousles changements successifs qui arriveraient dans l'Univers." But although Laplace published his formula only in 1814, we must, no doubt, assume that the idea would have been familiar from his lectures delivered in 1796 to which he later added the introduction con- taining the famous phrase. 2 O.S.S.E., XV, p. 26 (z3). 3 Ibid., p. Z8 (25). 4Ibid., p. 55 (6I). Cf. also p. 57 (65): "L'obligation est imposee a chacun de donner con- stamment 'a ses forces personelles une direction utile a l'humanite; les bras du pauvre continueront a nourir le riche, mais le riche recoit le commandement de faire travailler sa cervelle, et si sa cervelle n'est pas propre au travail, il sera bien oblige de faire travailler ses bras ; car Newton ne laissera sirement pas sur cette plan'ete (une des plus voisines du soleil) des ouvriers volon- tairement inutiles dans l'atelier." The idea of the organisation of society on the example of the workshop, which appears here for the first time in literature, has, of course, since played an important r6le in all socialist literature. See particularly G. Sorel, " Le syndicalisme revolu- tionaire" in MRouvenient Socialiste, November ist and i5th, I905. Compare also the passage in K.

In condensing we have had to try anld bring some order into the incoherent and rambling jumble of ideas which this first pamphlet of Saint-Simon really is. It is the out- pouring of a visionary megalomaniac who sprouts half- digested ideas, who all the time is trying to attract the attention of the world to his unappreciated genius and the necessity to finance his works, and who does not forget to provide for himself as the founder of the new religion great power and the chairmanship of all the Co-uncils for life.2 3 Soon after the publication of this first work, Saint-Simon found that his funds were entirely exhausted and the next few years he spent in increasing misery, importuning his old friends and associates with demands for money and, it appears, not stopping short of blackmail. Even his appeals to now powerful friends of the past, such as the Comte de Segur, Napoleon's grand maitre des ce're'nonies, procured him in the end no more than the miserable and humiliating position of copyist in a pa"wnbroking institution. After six months of this, weakened and ill, he met his former valet, who took him into his house. For four years (i8o6-i8io) until he died that devoted servant provided for all the needs of his ex-master and even defrayed the cost of printing Saint-Simon's next work. It seems that during this period Saint-Simon read more extensively than ever before ; at least the Introduction aux travaux scientifiques du XiXe si?ecle3 shows a wide although still very superficial and ill-digested knowledge of the scientific literature of the period. The main theme is still the same, but the methods proposed have somewhat changed. Before science can organise society, science itself must be organised.4 The Council of Newton therefore now becomes the editorial committee of a new great Encyclopedia which is to systematise and unify all knowrledge: " We must 1 Lettres, ed.

But although the growth of Physicism has now been going on for eleven hundred years,4 the victory is not yet complete. The reason is that the work of the past, particularly that of the French Encyclopedists, was merely critical and destructive.5 It is for the great Emperor Napoleon, " the scientific chief of humanity as he is its political chief," " the most positive man of the age," to organise the scientific system in a new encyclopedia worthy of his name.6 Under his direction the " physicist clergy " in the atelier scientifique will create a work that will organise physicism and found, on reasoning and observation, the principles which for ever will serve as guides to humanity.7 The greatest man after the Emperor, and that is "undoubtedly the man who admires him most profoundly", offers himself for the task as his " scientific lieutenant, as a second Descartes, under whose leadership the works of the new school will be prodigious."8 It need hardly be said that this work is no more systematic than the first. After a vain attempt at coherent exposition it soon becomes a collection of disjointed notes from Saint- Simon's portefeuille. He himself abandoned the ambitious plan outlined at the beginning, as he explains in the sketch of his autobiography, because of lack of funds, or as he admits elsewhere, because he was not yet ripe for the task.9 Yet, with all its defects, the work is a remarkable document. It combines, for the first time, nearly all the characteristics of the modern scientistic organiser.

One could sometimes believe that one is reading a contemporary work of an H. G. Wells, a Lewis Mumford, or an Otto Neurath. Nor is the complaint missing about the intellectual crisis, the moral chaos, which must be overcome by the imposition of a new scientific creed. The book is indeed, more than the Lettres d'un habitant de Geneve, the first and most important document of that " counter-revolution of science ", as their fellow- reactionary Bonald called the movement,3 and which later found more open expression in Saint-Simon's avowed desire to " terminate the revolution " by conscious re-organisation of society. It is the beginning of both moderm positivism and modern socialism, which, thus, both began as definitely reactionary and authoritarian movements. The Introduction, addressed to his fellow scientists, was not published but merely printed in a small number of copies for distribution among the members of the Institut. But although the great scientists to whom he sent it took no notice, he continued to appeal to them for their assistance in a. number of smaller tracts of a similar character. We can pass over the various minor writings of the next few years, which were mainly concerned with the project of an encyclopedia, and during which time to the megalomania of the prophet is gradually added the characteristic persecution mania of the verkannte Genie which expressed itself in violent abuse of the formerly so admired Laplace, whom he suspected of being responsible for his neglect.4 4 There are no important developments in his writings till I813.- Once more plunged into abject poverty by the death of his faithful valet, he starved and in the end fell dangerously ill.

Once again settled in tolerable comfort, his work entered a new phase. Finally disillusioned in his hope of obtaining the collaboration of the physicists, he turned away from the brutiers, infinitesimnaux, alge'bristes et arithmdticiens,1 whom he no longer conceded the right to regard themselves as the scientific advance guard of humanity, and taking up the second strand of thought from his first work, he turned again to the biologists. In his Me'moire sur la science de l'homme (part of which, however, still bears the separate title Travail sur la gravita- tion universelle), his problem is again how physiology, of which the science of man is a part, can be treated by the methods adopted by the physical sciences2 and thus follow those sciences in the progress from the " conjectural " to the " positive " stage.3 With the science of man, as part and summit of physiology, morals and politics must also become positive sciences,4 and thus " the passage from the idea of many particular laws regulating the phenomena of the divers branches of physics to the idea of a single and unique law regulating them all " must become completed. When this is achieved and all the particular sciences have -become positive, the general science, i.e.. philosophy, will also become positive.6 It will then at last be able to become *the new spiritual power, which must remain separate from the' temporal power, since this is a division incapable of improvement.7 With this organisation of the "positive system " we shall have definitely entered into the third great epoch of human history of which the first, or pre- liminary, was. ended with Socrates while the second or conjectural has lasted to the present.8 This development of ideas which we can observe enables us to predict their future movement.9 Since " the cause which acts strongest on society is a change, a perfectioning of the ideas, the general beliefs,"'0 we can do even more, we can develop a theory of history, a general history of man- kind, which will deal not merely with the past and present but. also with the future.

It is " the happiest idea which has ever presented itself to his mind " and he is " enchanted by the conception ",' but for the moment he develops it no further. As with most of his works before 18I4, the idea remained a promise of future things to come, a prospectus of work he would like to have done, but the Mt/moire itself is still' an unorganised mass full of irrelevant detail and bizarre conceits from which one can extract the fertile ideas only because one knows their later development. 5 All this changed suddenly with Saint-Simon's next work, the Re'organisation de la societed europe'enne,2 published in 1814. From that date onwards there issued under his name a stream of books and pamphlets in which ideas were systematically expounded and which sometimes were even well written. It is true that after a new period of abject misery during which he underwent a cure in what looks suspiciously like a mental home he was enabled to make a new start. But the man of fifty-five was hardly likely to have suddenly acquired the gift of lucid exposition. It is difficult to resist the belief that the change had something to do with the fact that from that date he was able to secure the help of young collaborators and that the influence of these young men went beyond matters of mere exposition. The first of these young helpers, who appeared even oh the title page of the Reorganisation as his co-author and pupil, was the future historian Augustin Thierry, then I9 years of age-the same Thierry who was later to become the leader of the new schools of historians who developed history as a history of the masses and of a struggle of class interests and, in this, profoundly influenced Karl Marx.3 The pamphlet on which he first collaborated with Saint- Simon is not of great interest to us, although it has achieved a certain celebrity for its advocacy of an Anglo-French Federation which, after the adherence of Germany, was to IO.S.S.E., XL, p. 287. 2 De la riorganisation de la socilti europeenne ou de la sdcessitd ea des snoyens de rassembler les petoples de l'eturope eni on seul corps politique ent coniservatt d chacun son inidependance nationale, par H.

The fall of the French Empire and the negotia- tions going on in Vienna made Saint-Simon then apply his dominant idea of a reorganisation of society to the whole of Europe, but in the execution of the idea there was little of the old Saint-Simon, except for occasional flights of fancy of which the phrase " the golden age that is not behind us but in front of us and that will be realised by the perfection of the social order " has by its later use as a motto by the Saint-Simonians become widely known.' The collaboration of Saint-Simon and Thierry lasted about two years. During the hundred days, they wrote first against Napoleon and then against the Allies. The great Carnot, always one of Saint-Simon's admirers and then temporarily returned to power, procured for Saint-Simon a sub-librarianship at the Jrsenal, equally temporary.2 After Waterloo he fell for a brief period back into poverty. But he had now young friends among the new generation of bankers and industrialists whose fortunes were rising, and it was to them that he attached himself. The enthusiasm for industry was henceforth to replace the enthusiasm for science; or, at least, as the old love was not quite forgotten, he found a new force worthy to exercise the temporal power at the side of science which was to wield the spiritual power. And he found that the praise of industry was better rewarded than the appeals to the scientists or the adulation of the Emperor. Lafitte, governor of the Banque de France;- was the first to help. He procured for Saint-Simon the con- siderable sum of io,ooo francs per month, to start a new journal to be called l'Industrie litteraire et scientifique ligue avec l'industrie commerciale et manutfacturiere. Around the new editor a number of young men collected, and he began his career as the head of a school. At first the group consisted largely of artists, bankers, and industrialists -among them some very distinguished and influential men. There was even a real economist among the contributors 1 O.S.S.E., XV, p. 247. In the form of " L'Age d'or, qu'une aveugle tradition a place jusq'ici dans le passe, est devant nous " the phrase appears first in I825 as the motto of Saint-Simon's Opinions littiraires et philosophiques, and later as the motto of the Saint-Simonian Producteur. 2 See M. Leroy, Vie de Saint-Sitm0on, pp. 26z, e7, and Hippolyte Carnot, "Memoire sur le Saint-Simonism," Sdances et travaux de l'Acaddmie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, 47e annee, I887, p. 128, where H. Carnot reports the following characteristic of Saint-Simon by his father: " J'ai connu M. de Saint-Simon; c'est un singulier homme. 11 a tort de se croire un savant, mais personne n'a des idWes aussi neuves et aussi hardies ". The only other scholars who seem ever to have given Saint-Simon any encouragement appear to have been the astronomer Halle and, charauLcristically, Cuvier,</page><page sequence="27">1941] THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION OF SCIENCE 35 to the first volume of l'Industrie, St. Aubin, although one whom J. B. Say unkindly described as the "clown of political economy ". He and Thierry appeared as the authors of the discussions of Finance and Politics which filled the first volume of l'Industrie. To the second volume, which appeared in I817 under a slightly changed title,' Saint-Simon himself contributed some considerations on the relations between France and America. This essay is on the whole in the spirit of the genuinely liberal group for whom Saint-Simon was then writing.2 " The sole purpose towards which all our thoughts and all our efforts ought to be directed, the organisation of society most favourable to industry in the widest sense of the term " is still best achieved by a political power which does nothing except to see that " the workers are not disturbed " and which arranges everything in such a way that all workers, whose union forms the true society, are able to exchange directly, and in complete freedom, the products of their various labours.3 But his attempt to base all politics on economic considerations as he understands them, that is in fact on technological considerations, began soon to lead him outside the views of his liberal friends. We need only quote two of the " most general and most important truths " to which his considerations lead: " ist. The production of useful things is the only reasonable and positive end which politics can set itself and the principle respect for production and the producers is infinitely more fruitful than the principle respect for property and the proprietors ", and " 7th. As the whole of mankind has a common purpose and common interests each man ought to regard himself in his social relations as engaged in a company of workers ". "Politics, therefore, to sum up in two words, is the science of production, that is, the science which has for its object the order of things most favourable to all sorts of pro- duction ".4 We are back at the ideas of the Habitant de Geneve-and at the same time at the end of what can be regarded as the independent development of Saint-Simon's thought. 1 L'Industrie ou discussions politiques, miorales et philosophiques dans l'intdre't de tous les hoinnses livres a des travaux indipendanits.

" I cannot conceive of association without government of someone " are reported to have been Saint-Simon's words in the final quarrel, to which Thierry replied that he " could not conceive of -association without liberty ".1 Soon this desertion by his assistant was to be followed by a mass flight of his liberal friends. But this came only after a new assistant of great intellectual energy began to push Saint-Simon further along the road which he had only indicated but had not had the power to follow. In the summer of I8I7 the young polytechnician Auguste Comte, the first and greatest of the host of engineers who were to recognise Saint-Simon as their master, joined him as secretary. Henceforth, to the death of Saint-Simon eight years later, the intellectual history of the two men is indissolubly fused. As we shall see in the next Part, much of what is commonly regarded as Saint-Simonian doctrine, and what through the Saint-Simonians exercised a profound influence before Comte's public career as a philosopher began, was due to Auguste Comte.
