In this, his 17th book, Bernd Heinrich turns, with true delight and a keen eye for detail, to the ecological and evolutionary underpinnings of the nesting behavior of birds. The Nesting Season is filled with examples drawn from years of personal observations of bird nests and behavior. In fact, the first color plate in the book is reproduced from his early forays into ornithology before he was 10-years-old. Now, decades later, he discusses the mating, nesting, and parenting behavior of birds with the same joy he evinced as a boy. The Nesting Season consists of a series of loosely connected essays, each elucidating fascinating examples from ornithology centered on a particular stage in a bird's life. Although there is no larger argument that threads through the book as a whole, Heinrich's narrative gently coheres as it follows a great many bird species through their repro- ductive cycles, from pair formation to nest site selection, nest con- struction to egg recognition, parenting, and finally fledging. In each chapter Heinrich discusses the biological basis of bird behavior. In doing so he implicitly follows Nikolaas Tinbergen's classic framework of the four causes of behavior: proximate (often physiological) causes, their developmental basis, how a behavior functions to help an animal survive and reproduce, and the trait's evolutionary history. Heinrich additionally suggests in his introduction that "almost everything about birds that excites relates, directly or indirectly, to their reproductive behavior" (p. 7). Insofar as many bird behaviors are indeed linked to reproduction, this book serves as a general introduction to the biolog- ical study of bird behavior. (Those behaviors that are not, Heinrich leaves unmentioned.) Heinrich's prose portrays the birds he has spent his life studying as if the individual animals in his narrative have purposive actions. Scien- tifically-trained readers may find this convention anthropomorphic, but Heinrich counters that his decision to portray animals in this way reflects his belief that some "apparent" anthropomorphisms may be</page><page sequence="2">362 BOOK REVIEW more justified than others. For example, he finds "happiness" in a bird's song harder to justify than an individual's "grief' after the death of an offspring (pp. 12-13). One charming consequence of this convention is his engaging, clear narrative voice. Despite his stated willingness to draw his vocabulary from human models, only rarely does Heinrich question what a careful study of bird behavior might be able to tell us about those same human actions and behaviors. His direct comparisons between human and animal behavior are largely limited to his fasci- nating explication of what the concept "monogamy" might mean in birds (and, in this instance, people). As a result, however, Heinrich misses an opportunity to explore more fully the common tendency in the popular media to generalize from animals to people - a convention with which many of his readers will be familiar. Perhaps the most persistent subtheme within the book is the delete- rious role of anthropogenic environmental changes on bird life. These effects occur not only because we are destroying areas where some birds nest, but also because our building structures sometimes confuse birds into making mistakes. One summer Heinrich observed a pair of phoe- bes, in which both partners participate in building a single nest, who accidentally built two separate nests side-by-side along a long stretch of rafter in his outhouse. When the time came to lay their eggs, the birds couldn't tell which was "their" nest and flew away. In a different year, the same thing happened to a pair of robins seeking to nest on a beam in his barn. Heinrich postulates that both these pairs failed to reproduce because the uniform environment prohibited specific nest site recogni- tion (p. 182). Some species, of course, have adapted much more easily to human structures. Here Heinrich describes, among other examples, falcons and other raptors taking advantage of tall human structures for nesting (p. 159), and the numerous birds that visit his feeders, nest boxes, and other serendipitous locales around his New England home. Trained organismal biologists will likely find the evolutionary claims presented in the book unsurprising, although surely they could learn a great deal about the specific behaviors of individual species. For non- ornithologists, however, there is much to chew on - both in terms of the ecological pressures that constrain avian evolution and Heinrich's rich descriptions of bird behavior. My favorite piece of newly acquired bird lore is the capacity of some young birds to "projectile" defecate out of their nest, thereby keeping their home space clean (p. 223). For histo- rians of biology, Heinrich has scattered The Nesting Season with ref- erences and descriptions of classic experiments in bird behavior, including Margaret Morse Nice (p. 107), Daniel Lehrman (p. 99), the</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEW 363 aforementioned Nikolaas Tinbergen (p. 201), and, of course, Konrad Lorenz. The result is an entertaining book that sure to please anyone with a passion for birds. Erika Lorraine Milam University of Maryland</page></plain_text>
