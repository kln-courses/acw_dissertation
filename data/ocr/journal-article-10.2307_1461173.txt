<plain_text><page sequence="1">Humanistic and Scientific Knowledge of Religion: Their Social Context and Contrast WERNER STARK The essential assertion of the sociology of knowledge - borne out both by scientific research and by simple common sense - is that the style of thought of a society depends on its mode of action and that, in the last resort, both derive from the order of values which that society has made its own. More simply expressed, a society thinks as it acts, and it acts in accordance with the valua- tions and value preferences characteristic of it. If we want to know whether or not our modern culture has a specific genius for the study of the phenomena, and of the whole phenomenon, of reli- gion, we must, if we want to follow that lead, try to descend to the last root of all modern mentality, to the supreme value which it pursues and to which it adjusts its thought as well as its more pragmatic life. In a country that spends untold millions on a journey to the moon while its hos- pitals, schools, and cultural institutions languish for lack of money, it can hardly be doubted what that supreme guiding value is: control of the physical universe, the attempt of man to become master of the habitat - both in the wider and nar- rower sense of the word - within which he finds himself. A whole range of in- terests which loomed very large in earlier societies - artistic interests, for instance - are forced, under our dispensation, to take a back seat. They are still there, they get a modicum of attention, but, relatively speaking, they are bereft of that direction-giving power which they enjoyed in an earlier period. To use a simple metaphor, they are not occupying the driver's seat. A society with this supreme aim will, spontaneously and almost unavoidably, channel its mental energies in specific, characteristic ways. It will raise physics and physicists to the pinnacle of glory while demoting art and artists to a modest and marginal position. Other in- tellectual pursuits will be graded in a corresponding manner: They will receive a rather high and honorific place if they are close to the master-value of domina- tion over our physical habitat, and a com- paratively low and humilific one - seen almost as play - if they are remote from it. They will be considered less meaning- WERNER STARK is Professor of Sociology at Fordham University. He holds degrees from the University of Hamburg, Dr rer. pol.

The substance of this paper was presented by Dr. Stark as an address at a joint plenary session of the American Academy of Religion and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, Sanders Theater, Harvard University, October 25, 1969. An address by Robert Bellah, "Theological and Scientific Language in the Study of Christian Tradition," presented at the same time, will be pub- lished in the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 168</page><page sequence="2">HUMANISTIC AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF RELIGION 169 ful, and, in consequence, they will be given less money--a somewhat sordid but by no means unimportant fact - so they will not have the same chance to unfold and flourish as the pet pursuit. The privileged treatment of one sci- ence need not, in principle and by itself, interfere with the inner condition of the sciences that are not so privileged. They may develop more slowly and less broadly, but there is no cogent reason why they should not be seen as the truth, even "the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." Yet in practice even the inner condition of the disprivileged, the secondary, sciences will be disfavorably influenced by singling out one branch of learning as the queen of the sciences. What is apt to happen, what has in- variably happened, is that the proposi- tions and methods of the queen science will have so much prestige that they will become the models for all other sciences and will be applied in and to them whether their own proper subject matter allows it or not. An example that springs to mind at once is La Mettrie's L'Homme Machine. Obviously, the human body is not a machine, for it has life, whereas a mechanism has none. One should have thought the quality of life so basic to the human body and so central to any de- scription and discussion of it that it could not be set aside. If we disregard for a moment the great protest movement known as pre-romanticism and concen- trate on the prevalent and received opin- ions, the orthodoxies of the age, the eighteenth century was so deeply sunk in Newtonianism that, by hook or by crook, it would have a Newtonian, mechanistic physiology as well. The case is particularly instructive for it defies not only the manifest facts and flies not only in the face of simple common sense, it also threatens vital interests. A medical science based on the proposition that all forms of sickness are due to states of disequilibrium is enclosed in a kind of strait jacket; it cannot move freely in an unhampered and unprejudiced pursuit of the real causes of disease; consequently it will not be able to cure many people. Yet in a world like that of the eighteenth century, and like all societies which have made the mechanical control of the ma- terial universe their prime pursuit, mech- anistic modes of thinking are apt to creep into all disciplines and even fill them out and dominate them to an amazing, over- whelming degree. The example which we have given - La Mettrie's treatise L'Homme Ma- chine - is only a small, bizarre, and particularly clear illustration of what is in reality a wide and pervasive tendency. Whole sciences have fallen victim to pan- mechanism. For instance, until very re- cent times, economics was little more than an attempt to elaborate a satis- factory definition of the equilibrium of the market, and classical economists themselves have made it easy for us to see that all they were doing was "to apply" (as they would say), "to ape" (as I would say), the principles of ra- tional mechanics. It took an economic world crisis to shake them, to some degree, out of this mechanistic rut; but the lure of the mechanistic model is with them still. And as there is a mechanistic economics, so there is a mechanistic psy- chology (associational psychology and behaviorism are forms of it), so there is a mechanistic sociology, and so on, in- deed, even a mechanistic music which would regard composition as merely a clever exercise akin to mathematical and logical constructions which has produced works that are at the same time formally interesting and without flavor or savor, without sentiment or soul. In this way there is built up a total world-view of which bias - avoidable, but never avoided - is an integral part. Our task is to ask what influence that bias has on the study of religion, and the answer can hardly be in doubt: in a</page><page sequence="3">170 WERNER STARK society in which control of its physical setting is the overall aim, and in which the physical and the technological sci- ences are allotted pride of place, religion is sure to be regarded as merely a mar- ginal - one might almost go so far as to say, almost an illegitimate - phenome- non. Already biology enjoys a much less favorable position than, say, physics be- cause the living world is much more difficult to control than the world of dead objects, the world of the laws of gravita- tion, the world of inert masses. How much more unfavorable then must be the condition under which the science of re- ligion operates! Religion shows us man in a position of inescapable dependence upon forces he can never hope to manip- ulate; in other words, in the very light in which he, at least in his modern self- conception, does not wish to see himself. The whole subject, therefore, attracts something like a negative value-accent, obviously not a particularly good augury for the attempt to understand the reality of religion, to appreciate it, to discover its greatness. Emile Boutroux has given us a concept which is apposite here: the concept of a sentiment de rationalite. There are sciences that offer us a specific feeling of satisfac- tion, the feeling that we have truly solved the problems with which we are con- cerned. Mathematics is such a science. If we are given three equations with three unknowns, x, y, and z, and if we work it all out, we know in the end, with total certainty and conviction, that we have mastered the matter in hand, and we feel satisfied. Rational mechanics and its associated technological branches are such sciences, too. When a machine is built and it works, we know that we have been successful and nobody and nothing can gainsay our success. But how differ- ent is, how different must be, a study of which mystery is the core! By its very essence, by its very definition, it cannot give us the coveted sentiment de rationalite. Indeed, if we see religion as an element in a comprehensive world-view tied to the wagon of mechanics we soon realize that it must be the spoilsport, the fly in the apothecary's ointment which ruins the whole jar with all its precious con- tents. There will in consequence appear a tendency to dissolve the whole phenom- enology of religion in thin air, and a con- sistent and radical reductionism will use all its tricks to replace religious phe- nomena by other allegedly more basic ones, more mechanical and material ones, for instance, to overlay the subjective ex- periences of the mystics by objectified descriptions of abnormal states such as nervous overexcitement or other forms of pathology. This is assuredly not the way to a fair and full investigation of mysti- cism and its evidence. These are important guideposts to- wards a possible, and certainly desirable, self-criticism on the part of the modem sciences of religion. But the sociology of knowledge can do more for these sci- ences than merely pointing out that their truth-content is threatened by the me- chanistic bias indigenous to a society such as our own. It can open up a second avenue of self-study and truth-control which in the end leads to a somewhat similar result as the first. Ferdinand Tonnies has taught us that we must in all things distinguish between two kinds of society, the one called community and the other association. Communities are close knit. They are unities. The "we" is more important in them than the "I, you, and he." Associations on the other hand are characterized by a loose sort of coherence, by semi-integration rather than by fuller fusion. The "I, you, and he" are more important in them than the "we" insofar as the "we" is conscious, or is valued, at all. They are multiplicities, col- lections of individuals and not historical individuals themselves. The differences in social nature between the two types of life are obvious at once.</page><page sequence="4">HUMANISTIC AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF RELIGION 171 What is far less obvious, although by no means less important, is the difference in the style of thought or in basic philos- ophy which goes with the two contrast- ing principles of organization. In a com- munity man feels himself dependent on the group. He conceives of himself as a new shoot on an old tree or as a new cell in an already existing body. He thinks of himself as somebody made by an older and wider life, not a somebody who is the creator of a new and specific personal life of and for himself. Tradition will be much, if not everything for him; it will be little, if anything at all - it will at most be a nuisance and not a value to the child of an associational society who thinks of his neighbors as competitors rather than as cognates or agnates. The descent group which looms so large in the early history of humankind, whether it is called clan or sib or genos or any other name, is a typical com- munity in the sense which T6nnies has given to the word. In such a descent group the mind of men is immediately and quasi-automatically carried back to the origin of things. If I feel myself to be, not so much Jacob as Isaac's son, and not so much Isaac as Abraham's son, then I raise my eyes towards the founder of my family, then I peer into the dim and distant past. But whether I like it or not, this brings me up against the mystery of being, and I must develop some atti- tude towards it. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob knew themselves to be the sons of Adam, and they could not bring the great chain of being to a close without some- how anchoring it in the last ground of being, in other words, in the beginning- less and endless reality of God. Not only the Judeo-Christian tradition is in this way one of the mental products of clan- society or community, but all the many primitive cults which we call totemic have also sprung from the same root. In one word, the social form of life which we call community is favorable to the development, and therefore also to the appreciation of religious phenomena. It is different with associational socie- ties of which our own is one. In such societies the individual does not consider himself the product of antecedent forces, of the parent society from which he has come, but he thinks of himself as an in- dependent will which acts in and on the future and is more especially the creator of coming social forces and forms. So- cial contract theories are characteristic of associational societies; society is something that is made by man, not man something that is made by society. The reference is always forward, as it were, never backward-looking as in com- munities. This alone militates against a religious or even merely a metaphysical world-view. He who peers into the future, who does not cast his mind back to the origin of things, does not--or at any rate not necessarily - encounter mystery at all. We can see at this point with all desirable clarity how closely akin associ- ational thinking is to that mechanistic thinking we have considered and analyzed before. Even society appears in this ideology as something man-made and not as something grown; it appears, to use the most appropriate, if perhaps some- what brutal term, as something manu- factured. The two biases strengthen each other, as one can see; they coalesce into one master-bias. Man appears as the creator kat exochen; he creates not only things such as tools, he creates also realities which lie above the mechanical- material level such as societies and cul- tures. No doubt, man may feel in this way; he does create societies and cultures as well as tools and other tangible things. But as technological and associational so- ciety limits its horizon by cutting itself off from the past, from its temporal depth-dimension as it were, so it limits its horizon by cutting itself off from its own overall problematic, from its meta-</page><page sequence="5">172 WERNER STARK physical depth-dimension. For, in a true and total view, man is not only a creator, he is also one created, a creature, one dependent as well as one partially inde- pendent. One of the reasons why tech- nological society has achieved so much is precisely the self-imposed, the willingly accepted limitation of its world-view to the facts which are favorable to man, en- couraging to him, which show him as a Promethean figure, a little demiurge. But what is pragmatically useful is not always philosophically true. Modern man lives in a kind of clever man's fools' paradise. Perhaps we see his painful shortcomings best if we think of his impotent way of dealing with tragedy and death. The tran- quillizing pill and the craftsmanship of the mortician are merely miserable shirker's tricks, attempts to sidestep and to bypass the most majestic happenings in human life. But however that may be, it is clear that an individualistic and associational culture which suggests to man that he is in the first place a creator, and a creator with ever-widening potentialities and powers, in other words, a culture which veils and conjures away man's permanent limitations and recurrent catastrophes, is a poor soil for the development of a realistic science of religion. We could well pursue this subject fur- ther. We could show how associational society can at best conceive of God as the form-giver of matter, the great demiurge, and therefore remains, and must remain, in anthropomorphic forms of thought which block any breakthrough to the true religious idea of God as the Abso- lutely Other. We could show on the other hand how community, in which the "we" is ascribed more ontological reality than the "I" and "you" and "he," in other words, in which the species is ascribed more ontological reality than the passing individual, is always apt to en- gender a form of philosophical realism such as we find in Plato, and how this philosophical realism leads by its own inner impetus to a religious conception of the world. If the archetype of the rose is to be more real than the concrete rose which we can smell and see and touch, then it must be located, not in observable, physical reality, where we cannot dis- cover anything but concrete--incar- nate - things, but in a divine mind where the pattern is laid down from which all observable roses are derived and of which all observable roses are copies. But such subtle disquisitions would lead us far beyond the narrow frame within which we must remain here. I would only like to draw one final conclusion from my analysis. Perhaps it is hardly necessary to spell it out, for it springs directly from all I have said. If it is true, as the sociology of knowl- edge asserts, that a society which con- centrates on and excels in machine-build- ing, in applied mechanics, has the ten- dency to produce a mentality to match, a general world-view which is a theo- retical mechanicism driven beyond its proper boundaries, then it is also true, as a brief consideration will show, that that society will achieve its greatest suc- cess in the search for truth again in its chosen field, in that field of reality which is in fact dominated by mechanical laws. Outside that field, it will be less success- ful, partly because it will not try so hard in these areas, and partly also because it is not optimally equipped for the solu- tion of the problems it encounters there. This is in fact so, as an independent study of the history of ideas will show. The development of capitalism started fortis- simo with the great throw of Newton and it has gone on crescendo in this particular line up to the great triumphs of our own day. Other studies have sadly lagged. If they are also to advance, they must first break out of the narrow limitations which the spirit of mechanicism, that is to say the spirit of modem capitalism, has forced upon them. Not everybody will approach the great phenomena of religion with an</page><page sequence="6">COMMENT 173 open mind; not everybody will therefore have even an initial chance truly to under- stand and really to penetrate beyond the shining surface of things religious to their essential core. Only he will have that chance, and only he should engage in this pursuit, who has rid himself of the pre- vailing pan-mechanicism, and this is to say, of the prevailing prejudices, of our epoch. If I may be permitted a somewhat pun- gent formulation, I would say that the first and foremost pre-condition for suc- cessful work in the field of religious studies is a revolutionary act. That way lies the great difficulty, the great chal- lenge, and also the great promise of the science to which we are devoting our lives.</page></plain_text>
