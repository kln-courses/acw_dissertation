By Serge Gruzinski, trans. Heather MacLean. Durham: Duke University Press, 2001 THIS LONG OVERDUE TRANSLATION OF SERGE GRUZINSKI'S I99O BOOK IS A welcome addition to the author s corpus in English. It is, besides, an impor- tant companion to The Conquest of Mexico in that it supplements some of the aspects of the process of Westernization that took place during colonial times to which the aforementioned book did not pay special attention. One of those neglected aspects is the role played by the image throughout the colonial period. One of the objectives of this book is to show that images were very important for the Europeans and that they constituted an extremely valu- able tool for colonization. There are different kinds of reasons for the relevance of the image in colonial times: spiritual (the imperative of evan- gelization), linguistic (as a tool to overcome the obstacle posed by the indige- nous languages to the missionaries message), and technical (the availability and popularization of engravings and of the printing press [2]). Yet the Amerindians did not remain passive before the European aggression. On the • 277</page><page sequence="2">278 • Book Review contrary, they responded to the images that were imposed on them with images of their own creation. That is why Gruzinski asserts that, in good part, the enterprise of colonization was a war of images that lasted several centuries (2). The book begins with a chapter on the Admiral of the Ocean Sea, because in Gruzinski s opinion the importance of the image can be traced as far back as his arrival in American lands. Christopher Columbus's gaze is what the chapter focuses on in its first section. There, Gruzinski analyzes the ways in which Columbus deals with indigenous objects that seem to be representa- tional. Yet it is Fray Ramón Pané (a Catalonian friar) who, in 1496, studies the indigenous objects today known as Cemies, which have many meanings, origins, and forms (10). In spite of the polysemous nature of those objects and the lack of referent points for the task of interpreting them from a com- pletely different culture, Fray Ramón Pané does not describe them as idols that represented false gods or the devil (11). They are, instead, things endowed or not with a life (11). Columbus, for his part, does not call the Amerindians idolaters either (11). Although Gruzinkis attribution of ethnographic sensitivity to Fray Ramón Pané is arguable (because it sounds like a forced attribution of mod- ern values to an early modern subject who- I hasten to declare in order to avoid falling into an anachronism that would eventually be noticed- had no knowledge of anything remotely similar to ethnography), it is clear that the friar tries, most of the time, to describe the indigenous rituals in their own specificity. That is, he does not try to understand them from an exclusively European standpoint but tries, instead, to understand the local context in which they take place. Nevertheless, it can be said that the discourses of Pané and Columbus share one trait with modern ethnography: they are uni- lateral discourses that do not give the Amerindian the chance to produce, in turn, a discourse about the European subject. The following section studies Peter Martyr of Anghieras (humanist and advisor to the Spanish Crown, the first to ever publish an encyclopedic vol- ume on the New World) interpretation of the Cemies as ghosts (13-18) and Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedos (the first royally appointed chronicler of the Indies) characterization of them as figures of the devil (18-22). In both cases,</page><page sequence="3">Gustavo Verdesio • 279 the indigenous object is reduced to something familiar, to something easily understood in the European episteme. Yet, it is with the arrival of Hernán Cortés (the conqueror of Mexico-Tenochtitlan) in the discursive scene that the word "Cerni" disappears and gives way to the most familiar one, at least for a European audience: "idol" (22). According to Gruzinski, with Cortés disappears any interest or concern for the elucidation of the questions about what the idols meant or what they were used for; that is, what replaces Pané s curiosity is a total indifference for the identity and function of the indigenous objects (25). This attitude was the product of a decision and not of an impossibility (25-26). From then on, the idol becomes, if it is made of a precious metal, a valu- able curio (26). The object is now appreciated for its value and, not less importantly, for its beauty: many of them will end up in one of the growing European collections. In that new home (the collection), indigenous objects are separated from their original contexts and are, in that manner, deprived of their usual meaning (27). The first idols seen by Europeans, the Cemies, were not as valuable as the, say, Aztec ones, because they were made of less interesting materials such as stone or wood. According to Gruzinski, the encounter with more complex civilizations such as the Aztecs, first, and the Incas, later, forced Europeans to come up with more elaborate strategies for both domination and conversion (28). Although this characterization may owe a lot to European evolutionary and diffusionist models, it is true that a new strategy developed: that which con- sisted in the persecution of objects that did not exist in the indigenous world; that is, the persecution of the idols- a European construct without a counterpart in any of the indigenous cultures encountered by the invaders (28). Europeans started, then, watching for signs of a complex religious life, for indicators of an easily taken wealth (29). In the second chapter (entitled "War"), Gruzinski tells us that the adver- sary's images are unacceptable if they are meant to be worshipped (30). This notion starts to become dominant with, again, Cortés, who started the afore- mentioned practice: the systematic destruction of the images of the Amerindians (30). It is with Cortés, then, that the persecution of idolatry takes the form of a two-step operation: first, the destruction of the native</page><page sequence="4">280 • Book Review idols, second, the substitution of them by Christian images (31). It was he and not the priests who came with him who both preached against the local idols and replaced them with Catholic images (32). In contrast, some of those priests showed a remarkably pragmatic attitude towards indigenous images: "Why bother taking away their idols from a temple or an oratory now, if they then transfer them elsewhere?" (34). The European invasion, then, "unleashed a flood of Western images onto the American continents" (34). In Gruzinskis opinion, Cortés did not take, from those Western images, their didactic, emotional, or mnemonic capac- ities-and thus their qualities of representation- as much as their material efficacy (37). That is, he tried to persuade the Amerindians that his images were more useful and powerful than theirs and, therefore, that they would be able to satisfy indigenous needs and secular expectations better than their old idols (37). The operation of substitution was not that difficult because, in general, the Amerindians realized that it did not entail a major change in the ways in which things worked: "the sanctuaries, the local clergy were imper- turbably recycled around the new images" and "the profanation remained apparently without consequence on the order of things and the world" (38). However, this process of replacement had not always worked so smoothly. It sometimes encountered unexpected difficulties, such as the "deviational" interpretations the aborigines performed vis-à-vis the Christian images, for example the widespread belief among indigenous communities that all European religious images represented "dioses" (gods) and that, therefore, the virgin Mary s images were the images of god (39). In any case, the Spaniards did not abandon their double policy of bar- tering (gold and silver) and the imposition of images. These two operations were always together, according to Gruzinski, and, in the Western worldview, the exchange favored the Europeans in the economic realm and the Amerindians in the domain of the image: the ones they were acquiring were the true ones (41). The idol, a Western creation, was the heir of a Judeo-Christian world- view, and it only existed in the gaze of the conquistadors (42). In this world- view, the idol is a false image to which a true (that is, Western) one must be</page><page sequence="5">Gustavo Verdesio • 281 opposed (45). In this respect, colonization appears, in the realm of images, as a decontamination (47). The Spaniards had difficulty understanding how the indigenous images worked. They had trouble realizing that the Amerindians images were not figurative and that they were not intended as realistic representations but as a means of communication (50). There is also another form of indigenous representation that was difficult for the Spaniards to grasp: the ixiptla. Gruzinski defines it as follows: The ixiptla could be the statue of a god ... a divinity that appeared in a vision, a priest "representing" a deity by covering himself in adornments, or even a victim who turns into a god destined to be sacrificed. These various "semblances" . . . could be juxtaposed during the rituals: the priest symbol- izing the god placed himself next to the statue he "represented" and there was no need for their appearances to be identical." (50-51) The ixiptla is, besides, the container of a power and the actualization of a power; it does not point to a "beyond" but incarnates the immanence of the forces that surround us as human beings (51). In opposition to this concep- tion we find the Christian image, that is a copy of an original to which, guided by resemblance, it points (51). In this context of mutual misunderstanding, the Amerindians tried to hide their extant "idols" as well as to produce new ones. This was not a very difficult operation for them because, traditionally, the worshipping of gods was done in private. Only on special occasions were the rituals made public, and most of the time they took place beyond the gaze of the populace - con- tact with the gods was reserved for the members of the nobility (55). Yet it was not always necessary for the Amerindians to hide their religious objects from the invaders, because many of them were not even visible to Western eyes. Trained only to perceive idols, the Spaniards were not able to see the religious nature of some objects such as stones, mirrors, clothes, maguey horns, flowers, and cocoa, to give just a few examples (55-56). These non- figurative forms of religious representation were, then, virtually invisible to Western subjects.</page><page sequence="6">282 # Book Review Indigenous religious practices became, therefore, even more private than they had been and, of course, completely clandestine (57). Their beliefs sur- vived mainly in three media: the man-gods (human beings dressed like gods), their visions, and their cult objects (59). Another form in which Amerindian religion survived was a wide variety of syncretisms that consisted in the jux- taposition - not the substitution - of elements from both cultures (59). Yet, in the first stages of the conquest of Mexico, the destruction of tem- ples and "idols" somewhat paralyzed, or at least shocked temporarily, the Amerindians in a way that stopped them from giving an organized response to the aggression (63). The first Franciscan friars who predicated the gospel in Mexico chose to be equipped with very few images to replace the destroyed idols, though: they were afraid that the locals would misinterpret some of the Christian images, such as the representation of Jesus' body on the cross, as referring to something similar to human sacrifices (65). The Franciscan images were the semblance of another thing; they were in lieu of the original (66). They were also more influenced by Flemish paint- ings than by the Italian or Spanish traditions (69-70) and Peter of Ghent, a Fleming, was one of the most renowned masters who taught the Amerindians how to reproduce the Christian art. Frescoes, walls saturated with images, also characterized the Franciscan enterprise and brought to the fore a new organization of space (77). They popularized, also, a very Western pictorial trend: an anthropomorphic kind of painting (78). This trait and many others posed a challenge to the perceptive habits of Amerindians, for whom the Western stylized representation of nature (caves, clouds, and trees, for example) was not by any means obvious (79). The space that organized those represented objects was not, either, self-evident to indigenous eyes, and the actions portrayed belonged to a repertoire unknown to them (80). There were, however, some possible bridges between indigenous and Western forms of representation, as Gruzinski points out: the absence of a background and the proliferation of emblems in some Christian representa- tions; plus the graphic representation of hierarchies allowed some room for at least a partial reception of the Occidental image by the Amerindians (84). What was probably less obvious to the Amerindian consumers of Western</page><page sequence="7">Gustavo Verdesio • 283 images was the imaginary of which they were a part (85). The Franciscans used images in yet another form: theatrical representations that had plenty of special effects and trompe l'oeil (90-91). In chapter 4, the most extensive and heavily documented chapter, Gruzinski studies the baroque image in general and the myth of the virgin of Guadalupe in particular. This latter is reconstructed from its origins, the astute concoction masterminded by the head of the Mexican church, Alonso de Montufar (96 and passim). The framework for the appearance of the cult is the 1570s, a decade that had marked the departure of Peter of Ghent and the arrival of the Jesuits and the Inquisition, which changed the religious sit- uation in Mexico completely (112). The increasing complexity of the baroque image- that included texts as an important part of the visual message - where the elements were the prod- uct of an intellectual construction and the deciphering of it required a cer- tain degree of education, lost a good part of the didactic strength of the Franciscan images (116). During the whole baroque period there is, besides, a proliferation of sacred images, not only in public places such as churches, but also in private homes (137). And those images, far from being simple or modest, were opulent: the materials they were made of cost a lot of money (145). Those images were also very public and massively consumed. They were an instrument used to achieve a goal: the unification of a very hetero- geneous society under a single imaginary (146). Finally, during the baroque era the Inquisition was in charge of the vigilance of the quality of images, which means that the tribunal watched over the respect of aesthetic canons (157). Chapter 5 studies the consumption of the baroque image, not only by European but also by mestizo and Amerindian subjects. The reader is pre- sented with a society in which the image is omnipresent to the point that something like a "colonization of everyday life" starts to take place (161). All kinds of objects were decorated with religious motifs: fans and watches depicting scenes from the Passion of Christ, stockings with saints images, buttons featuring the Virgin, and so on (161). Confronted with this prolif- eration of images, the church had to defend the monopoly it claimed against all these forms of appropriation of the religious images (163). Those</page><page sequence="8">284 # Book Review appropriations could take the form of monstrous clandestine figures, unorthodox commentaries, free interpretations, and so forth (163-64). Yet another form in which the masses appropriated sacred images was tattooing and body painting (165). Other ways in which consumers related to images was by coercing images to fulfill their wishes by attacking and sometimes destroying them (166-70), and by having visions (usually prompted more by hallucinogenic drugs than by religious fervor) or fan- tasies (170-74). However, for the church, the most worrying kind of appro- priation was the insincere use of the images by indigenous subjects who still believed in their ancient gods. Notwithstanding the undeniable existence of these practices, it is reasonable to assume that not all Amerindians con- sciously manipulated Christian images (177). Many of them simply looked at the images in a different way- a way that we should admit escapes us (177). According to Gruzinski, though, there is one thing we can say about indigenous reactions to Western religious images: they seem to have been very receptive to them (177). This receptivity can be explained, in part, by an old Nahua tradition that consisted of bringing back home the conquered gods from their military raids (177). Another reason can be found in the indigenous belief in the effectiveness of the Western image (178). Yet another reason: the missionaries often used the word "ixiptla" to refer to the images of the saints (178). This may have "taken on a tactical role for the Indians and been used to mask the recourse to ancient divinities, but it also fulfilled a function that was analogous to that of the traditional ixiptla. It was considered a living thing, to which one offered food and drink. From the very moment of contact the Western image thus received a native interpretation" (179). The appropriations that the Spaniards viewed as indigenous misunder- standings of the Christian image can be better explained, Gruzinski tells us, by accepting that indigenous interpretations were based less on error than on habits, practices, and notions that could help them understand, and deal with, colonial domination (180). There were, of course, misunderstandings, but they were occasionally mutual, like the equation of saints and idols that took place on both sides of the cultural clash (180). In any case, the indigenous imaginary showed a much more open attitude toward the new than the Spaniards' imaginary, as is shown, for</page><page sequence="9">Gustavo Verdesio • 285 example, in the rapid incorporation of indigenous subjects to the ranks of those producing Christian images (185). Amerindians played, then, from the time of Peter of Ghent on, an important role in the diffusion of Western images (192). Yet their role in the reproduction of the enemy s images changed over time. For example, in the eighteenth century the production of images "became an expression of native resistance that occasionally turned into rebellion. They even became concrete representations of the political, social and religious refusal of colonial order" (202). Little by little, Amerindians began to oppose their own Christian images to the ones produced by Europeans by claiming "the monopoly and the authenticity of Christian worship for themselves. The fake, the impostor, the devil, was the Spaniard" (203). But not all indigenous groups responded in the same way to the challenge posed by the iconography brought by the con- quistadors: the receptivity depended on the different imaginaries that pre- dominated in the different regions of Mesoamerica (205). This is why Gruzinski prefers to talk about indigenous imaginaries in the plural. The conclusion of this book is a very hurried overview of the most recent history of Mexico, from the eighteenth century to the date of publication (end of the twentieth century). In the end, he proposes a nexus between the baroque and postindustrial imaginaries: the baroque proliferation of images somewhat opened the way for "the politics, machinery and effects of the image today. It did so not only through its homogenizing function and its universalizing obsession, but also by creating a singular rapport with the image, making it the basis of a surreality into which the gaze could sink, that abolished the dis- tance from prototype to reflection, erasing the conditions of its production" (225). The whole chapter provides valuable insights, as is customary in Gruzinski, but it lacks sometimes the depth of analysis that one would have desired to see in the conclusion of such a dense and richly documented book. The conclusion is perhaps too short to account for both the long period that it intends to cover and the not-so-clear links between the baroque image and the ones produced by the modern-day Mexican network Televisa. Throughout this volume one gets the impression that Gruzinski could have gone further in the analysis of the cornucopia of documents he pres- ents to the reader. He usually stops analyzing once he has more or less</page><page sequence="10">286 • Book Review squeezed the sources of the information thats relevant to proving his point, which is usually the Westernization of indigenous lives and imaginaires. One could safely say that the pages dedicated to the Westernization of the indige- nous peoples of Mexico by European subjects outnumber, by a wide margin, the ones dedicated to registering indigenous forms of resistance to it. His claim that the study of colonial Latin America is important for the understanding of the present is welcome in an academic world that consis- tently forgets about that region (227), as is the case in postcolonial studies and other progressive scholarly practices. However, there should be better ways to make this connection between an unjust present and an ignomin- ious past than to quickly propose a nexus between the future world pro- posed by the film Blade Runner (or the present world that some, like Gruzinski, identify as postmodern) and the colonial Latin American one. This is how he sees those links: "The blurring of references, the confusion of ethnic and cultural registers, the overlap of life and fiction, the diffusion of drugs, the multiplication of the images bases also turned the New Spain baroque imaginaires into a préfiguration of the neobaroque or postmodern imaginaires that we experience today" (226). It seems to me that this kind of parallelism entails some risks, such as falling into the trap of believing in a transhistoric Zeitgeist shared by the baroque era and postmodernity. It also seems to me that if one intends to make such a risky and difficult-to-prove statement, more documentation and discussion should be dedicated to make the argument more persuasive or at least more plausible. Having said that, it is evident that we are before an important work that contributes to the understanding of the effects of colonization on the peo- ples of Mexico. It is not, perhaps, as illuminating as other contributions by Gruzinski, like, say, The Conquest of Mexico or his most recent El pen- samiento mestizo , but it is relevant nonetheless. It offers the reader a mag- nificent documentation, a series of insightful readings performed by an acute observer, and a focus on the hitherto neglected role of the image in the colonization of that important region.</page></plain_text>
