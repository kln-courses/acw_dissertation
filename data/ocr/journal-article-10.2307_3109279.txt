Or is the one 3, 000 years old truer? -Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko (with Barnett Newman) In June 1943 Adoph Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman sent a letter to the editor of the New York Times in which they expressed their belief in the timeless importance of the archaic symbol. This conviction, it appears, was especially true of Jackson Pollock, though as an artist loath to explain his work, he never communicated it. But his work masterfully did. A month after his contemporaries' letter appeared in the Times, Pollock signed a contract with Peggy Guggenheim and began preparing for his first one-man show at her New York gallery, Art of This Century. When the exhibition opened on 9 November 1943, Pollock had readied at least fifteen paintings along with some gouaches and drawings.' The only work reproduced in the exhibition brochure was the painting Male and Female, depicting two similar vertical forms poised in rigid confrontation (frontispiece). Despite its title, Pollock did not clearly distinguish the masculine form from the feminine one. The resulting ambiguity, intentional or not, endowed the composition with a broader significance-one that might be viewed as the juxtaposition of any number of opposing forces. Since the principle of dualism is central to many belief systems past and present, Pollock's Male and Female seemingly anticipated the challenge issued by the Times letter published only a few months later-to create a universal and timeless art. Although undated, it is generally accepted that Male and Female was painted in the fall of 1942, shortly after Pollock began his relationship with Lee Krasner. The exigencies brought upon by this union are, according to some, played out on the canvas in a confrontation between painted surrogates for Krasner and Pollock. Other scholars have inter- preted the potent dualism in Male and Female in light of the surrealist and Jungian precepts that were then in vogue within the New York art community. While automatism might account for the painting's daring brushstrokes, splatters, and drips, underpinning these gestural marks is a formal structure that Pollock ultimately derived from the Chavin art 9 American Art Jackson Pollock, Male and Female, ca. 1942.

Department of Library Services, American Museum of Natural History, New York City style native to the Peruvian Andes. A comparison reveals that the principal figures in Male and Female are integrally related-in their overall outlines, specific ideographic elements, and gender-to a 3,000-year-old representation of two deified caimans (reptiles resembling alligators of Central and South America) carved on a six-foot granite shaft from the temple complex at Chavin de Huantar, Peru (figs. 1, 2). Known today as the Tello Obelisk after its discoverer, the Peruvian archaeologist Julio C. Tello, this stone monument-like the other mono- lithic carvings from the ruined Chavin temple-never left Peru. Nonetheless, published drawings of the obelisk were widely available in the United States, and these visual records of Chavin iconogra- phy likely inspired Pollock to recast the male and female caimans into the totemic figures of Male and Female. During the thirties and early forties, Pollock would have had ample opportunity to witness the ingenuity of native Andean artists at several New York galleries and museums. Examples of Chavin art, recognized at the time as potentially the oldest in the New World, were less common than artifacts from later Peru- vian cultures, but they were nonetheless accessible to Pollock in the form of goldwork and decorated ceramic and stone vessels. The city's most sumptuous collection of Chavin artifacts belonged to the Museum of the American Indian and included repousse gold crowns, earspools, and other articles of personal adornment.2 The monolithic stone carvings from Chavin de Huantar are in many respects the hallmark of a style that distinguishes many other Chavin temples throughout Peru, but the stones were too heavy to be transported out of the country. Instead, full-size ink rubbings or tracings made from their bas-relief surfaces substituted for the originals in exhibitions that included Peruvian antiquities. 10 Fall 1997</page><page sequence="4">2 The Tello Obelisk on display in the Museo Nacional de Antropologia y Arqueologia, Lima, Peru</page><page sequence="5">Cursory contacts with these displays and exhibitions may have aroused Pollock's interest in Chavin's curious forms, but only a more sustained study of published reproductions could explain the artist's fidelity to its conventions in Male and Female and in other works produced during the same general period. Chavfn iconography even informs what is believed to be Pollock's exploration in self-portraiture, encouraging the idea that in these works Pollock melded his own features and pysche with those of the ancient artist-shaman, as if to celebrate his conquest over the complex and, at times, bewildering canons of Chavin art. The transformation witnessed in Pollock's style between 1938 and 1942 is variously attributed to the consequences of Jungian analysis, to the artist's associa- tion with the Russian-American painter and theorist John Graham, and to his growing interest in the work of the European modernists, particularly that of Picasso. According to Ellen Landau, this shift in artistic focus also signaled a concurrent move away from his earlier "fascination with Mexican and American Indian stimuli," whose last overt expres- sion she pinpoints to the 1941 painting Bird (fig. 3). Landau and others accept at face value Pollock's assertion that any lingering "references to American Indian art and calligraphy" in his work at the time were unintentionally introduced, "probably ... the result of early memo- ries and enthusiasms."3 Pollock's use of a compositional grid, traceable to the influence of Picasso and cubism, typifies his subsequent phase, from 1942 through the mid-forties. Yet this orthogonal structure is equally characteristic of the superimposed blocks of motifs found in Chavln art. Besides this shared gridlike arrangement, Pollock must have perceived other parallels common to both the alien Andean vocabulary and the more familiar Euro- pean idiom. The all-over design, for example, whose potential Mir6 and a few of Pollock's contemporaries had begun to exploit, is another easily discernible-and strikingly modern-feature of Chavin art. For Pollock's generation, the all-over composition represented a wholesale rejection of the bankrupt European tradition's tenets of positive and negative spaces and compositional focus. But the true break with the Western artistic heritage did not occur until Pollock liberated line from its subservience to form. This is the artist's principal achievement, as Michael Fried astutely recognized, and one that has no prece- dent in the prevailing "isms" of his day.4 Rather, Pollock's liberation of the line from form tantalizingly evokes the arabesque lines of the 3,000-year-old relief carvings from Chavfn de Huantar. "Fantastic Creatures" A detailed comparison between Male and Female and the Tello Obelisk suggests that the symbols and rhythms of indigeneous art did not immediately disappear from Pollock's art after Bird but instead became submerged under a "veil" of paint. Hidden beneath the painting's enriched surface are renditions of the obelisk's two principal figures, identified as South American caimans. These reptilian creatures are almost as difficult to discern in the original mono- lith as they are in the painting, for they are similarly obscured by a welter of secondary motifs that invade their primary outlines. Included among these minor motifs are deformed dwarfs, disembodied heads, demonized plants, and the like, whose depictions are made even more menacing by their toothy sneers and vigilant stares. Such monstrous figures vividly recall Lee Krasner's description of the "heads, parts of the body, fantastic creatures" that peopled 12 Fall 1997</page><page sequence="6">3 Jackson Pollock, Bird, ca 1938-41. Oil and sand on canvas, 70.5 x 61.6 cm (27 /2 x 24 in.). Museum of Modern Art, Gift of Lee Krasner in memory of Jackson Pollock the early stages of many of Pollock's most abstract compositions.5 The Chavin caimans appear in profile on the Tello Obelisk, their bodies extending along the length of the shaft and wrapping around all four sides. Only when the incised lines are mapped out on a flat surface do the two supernatural caimans come into view among the plethora of secondary motifs (fig. 4). Each caiman stands bolt upright, so that its snout and clawed foreleg point skyward while the bulk of its body rests on a clawed hind leg and fishlike tail. The incised head, torso, and fishtail of each creature are visible along one of the shaft's two wider faces, while the extremi- ties fold over onto an adjoining narrow side. Their outlines are virtually identical, but differences in the secondary elements signify the complementary natures of the principal totemic pair-the male and female fertility deities. According to Julio Tello, the male caiman was associated with the sky, the rainy season, and plants that occupy watery habitats, while the female repre- sented the earth, the dry season, and seed agriculture. This analysis of the obelisk's fundamental dualism was published in an extensive two-part article in 1923, along with the first roll-out drawing made of the obelisk's complex imagery. Tello later republished the same drawing in his 1929 book Antiguo Peru, a compen- dium of early Andean designs in which he laid the foundation for the importance and pervasiveness of the Chavin culture, later dubbed the "Mother Culture of Peru."6 Unlike the original stone carving, the drawing in Tello's early publications separates the two caimans and places each against its own rectangular black back- ground, a presentation that serves to isolate their individual natures and enhance their secondary motifs. While these celebrated caimans often appeared in later European, American, and Latin American publications, subtle-and not so subtle-differences in the way they were illustrated make these later versions improbable models for Pollock's Male and Female. Only the drawing in Tello's publications corresponds with the exact arrangement presented in the painting. Both Tello's article and book were-and still are-widely available in the United States. Pollock could have obtained copies from the New York Public Library or elsewhere. It is also widely known that Pollock regularly frequented the Ameri- can Museum of Natural History and the Heye Foundation's Museum of the American Indian for their extensive collections of ethnographic art (Antiguo Perui devotes several pages to the discov- ery of a cache of gold Chavin adorn- 13 American Art</page><page sequence="7">ments, which George Heye subsequently purchased for his museum).7 That Pollock may have used reproduc- tions of the Tello Obelisk as a stimulus for "unconscious" inspiration is entirely in keeping with his training and known practice. During the early thirties at the Art Students League in New York, the young artist completed exercises designed If Pollock studied the Chavin vocabulary, he did so ... to secure a legitimate means of bridging ancient and modern visions. by his teacher Thomas Hart Benton to isolate the rhythmic movement in famous works of art. Even after Benton moved to Kansas in 1935, Pollock continued to analyze the "essential rhythms" of master- works from published reproductions of works by Rubens, Michelangelo, El Greco, and Jose Clemente Orozco. Another legacy of Benton's methodology was, according to classmate Axel Horn, a compelling need "to break down the total complex problem of creating a work of art into its smaller components."8 These formative experiences may partially explain Pollock's initial attraction to Chavin art, whose bewildering complex- ity might have challenged the artist to isolate its peculiar components and harness its unfamiliar rhythms. At first sight, "Chavin art is as puzzling as an undeciphered script," wrote the American archaeologist John Howland Rowe in the first systematic analysis of the style's artistic conventions. His examination of the Chavin pantheon of anthropomorphic jaguars, birds of prey, caimans, and other predators demon- strated that all the larger figures are actually composed of numerous separate "minor figures having no very obvious relationship to the main subjects." Nonetheless, the "form and meaning" of the larger figures, Rowe determined, were dependent on the repetition of these smaller ideographic units.9 In other words, these units were the building blocks of the larger images' substantive and symbolic reality. The profusion of motifs, Rowe also observed, is rigidly governed by a network of vertical and horizontal lines. Each caiman on the Tello Obelisk, for ex- ample, can be divided into three vertical sections. Superimposed within these columnar divisions are figurative motifs whose organic shapes have been simpli- fied into geometric constructs of nearly equal width. This tendency, known as "modular width," is common to a number of art styles in Peru. It not only presents the smallest design element aligned along an implied grid pattern, but also fosters a uniformity of scale among and within the constituent parts of the design. Pollock perhaps discerned a relationship between Chavin modular units, as carved on the Tello Obelisk, and Graham's "space units," which "com- mand and imprison space in significant and final shapes."10 If Pollock studied the Chavin vocabu- lary, he did so not to find a ready source of trite archaic symbols, but to secure a legitimate means of bridging ancient and modern visions. The lessons he learned were structural ones. Pollock recognized a surface web of tightly integrated design blocks that disciplined the all-over design of the Tello Obelisk. But he also saw beyond the obelisk's gridlike structure to the monolith's "essential rhythms" and key motifs. Enough of the latter recur in Male and Female to confirm a direct relationship. The essential features of the ancient bas-relief and the twentieth- century painting are outlined and pre- 14 Fall 1997</page><page sequence="8">4 Line drawing of the Tello Obelisk. Adapted by the author from Julio C. Tello, Antiguo Peru: Primera Epoca (Lima: Empresa Editora Excelsior, 1929), pl. 4 sented side by side in figure 5 to highlight the common structural and ideographic elements." Beginning at the base of the left-hand rendering of Pollock's painting, a similar- ity can be noted between the fan-shaped feet that support his two totemic figures (A) and the fishtail fins (a) that denote the caiman's role as-in the words of the anthropologist Donald Lathrap-the "Master of the Fishes" within the Chavin pantheon.'2 About a third of the way up from the figures' feet-fins is another revealing correspondence in the left halves of both works-the mouth band that typically defines the axis of the body in Chavin figural representations. The menacing row of pointed teeth that serves as the skeletal armature for the caiman (b) is reduced in Pollock's version to a series of benign blocks (B). Whereas the Chavin sculptor punctuated his mouth band with crossed fangs, Pollock painted abstracted "curls" at the corners of his toothy grin. Paradoxically, what had been a raw symbol of savage ferocity was tamed by an artist in search of that very quality. A similar transformation is apparent in the heads of the same two figures. The seductive eyes (C), with their heavy lashes, in the upper left-hand corner of Pollock's painting may represent the artist's free interpretation of the snout and eye (c) of the left-hand caiman. (In the Tello drawing [see fig. 4], these Chavfn features were filled in with black and were thus more pronounced.) Pollock's "flirty" eyes may have been suggested by the sweeping line of the caiman's dominant upswept eyebrow, here transformed into a modern cliche. In the same painted profile, the Roman nose and the "pouty" square mouth could also be the result of Pollock's rendition of the ancient figure's four pointed teeth. While the sexual identity of the figures in Male and Female is still debated, most Andean scholarship is in general agree- ment over the gender assigned to the caimans on the Tello Obelisk. In the first study of the monolith, Tello located the genitalia just where this might reasonably be expected-on the underbelly, in front of the hind leg of each creature.'3 The male phallus is represented by a snakelike creature (d in fig. 5), whose head is 15 American Art</page><page sequence="9">5 "Essential rhythms" of Pollock's Male and Female compared to those in the Tello Obelisk. Drawing by the author outfitted with a toothy grimace. From its mouth issues forth a branching plant with eyes (d in fig. 6). When "coupled" with the snake, the plant creates an obvious visual metaphor of an ejaculating phallus. Just as obvious is the object into which the seminal fluid is emitted-the conch shell directly above (e in figs. 5 and 6). The universal popularity of the conch among aboriginal cultures lies not only in the sounds it produces, but also in the beauty of its pearly, pink opening, which intuitively suggests female genitalia and, on a broader scope, the fecundity of the sea. In Male and Female, Pollock painted a spiraling form on the right edge of the canvas (E in fig. 5), which can be inter- preted as a cross-section of the conch shell. Directly below this spiral is a branching plant resembling a pine tree sprig (D), which clearly corresponds to the branching plant in the original obelisk. In the transformation from stone to paint, these forms retain their defining character, indicating that Pollock was not merely responding to their outward shape, but instead drawing a cognitive connection. Noteworthy parallels also can be found with other examples of flora on the Tello Obelisk, specifically those depicted along an imaginary line that runs across the pelvic area of both caimans. Tello found these plant forms significant and illus- trated them individually (fig. 6, a-d). Not surprisingly, many of them refer to fertility. A flowering bottle-gourd vine (a in fig. 6), emerging from a feline head on the lower back of the female caiman, includes both immature and mature fruit. A more overt reference to reproduction on the female caiman is the peanut (outfitted with eyes) on the underbelly above the hind leg (b in fig. 6). Tello recognized this womblike form as an apt visual metaphor for the female sexual organs. On the male caimans, a form of canna-possibly edible-issues from a head on its back (c of fig. 6). Finally, the branching plant that serves as its phallus (d of fig. 6) is securely identified as manioc, a species native to South typical 16 Fall 1997 C . _ _ _ _ n I I I I B E b D I I I I I I I I I I I I e I I I I I_ d I I I I I I I I,, A</page><page sequence="10">6 Details from the Tello Obelisk: (a) gourd, (b) peanut, (c) canna, (d) manioc, and (e) conch shell.

Ce, Ce', Ea, Ea', and Fb America.14 Regardless of their exact taxonomy, it seems likely that Pollock recognized, however superficially, a link between the plantlike forms depicted on the stela and procreative power. Tello's "Mother Culture" and Pollock However compelling the many visual correspondences between Male and Female and Tello's roll-out drawing, evidence suggests that Pollock's awareness of Chavin culture and its significance to New World archaeology did not end with the Tello Obelisk. Tello himself offers one possible source of information, although there is no known personal connection between the two men. It may be more than coincidence, however, that Tello was professionally engaged at the American Museum of Natural History in New York during the early fall of 1936,15 the very year when Pollock was a member of David Alfaro Siqueiros's Experimental Workshop. Siqueiros and Tello may have gravitated together in pursuing their mutual interest in indigenous cultures and in following a shared revolutionary spirit. Tello's involvement in Peru's outlawed Aprista party would have surely earned him the respect of Siqueiros and his "comrades" at the workshop. No doubt the comrades were also intrigued by Tello's pure Andean Indian features and short, barrel-chested physique, the typical body type of Andean highland populations. Even if Pollock never personally met the internationally renowned Harvard graduate, he may have attended one of Tello's popular lecture series presented in the United States. By all accounts, Tello was an engaging speaker. "To listen to his talk, whether in his excellent English or in his perfectly modulated Spanish," wrote the American archaeologist Philip Ainsworth Means in the New York Times Magazine, "is to drink a deep draught from the fount of knowledge, one spiced by a delightful humor." In his lectures, Tello apparently spoke of the obelisk that now bears his name, for the Rochester Post Bulletin reported that the ancient Andean natives "worshipped monsters," or agri- cultural deities "in the shape of alliga- tors," before the advent of Christianity.16 If Pollock's first encounter with the Chavin art was not with Tello himself, there were other enthusiasts of ancient Peruvian art who could have caught his attention. In 1931 Means, who enjoyed a professional association with both the Museum of the American Indian and the American Museum of Natural History, wrote so provocatively of the Tello Obelisk that one can easily imagine its potential to inspire an artist of Pollock's legendary temperament: A still further stage of artistic andpsycho- logical disintegration is made evident by the 17 American Art</page><page sequence="11">carvings on the so-called Chavin obelisk. ... It represents a dragon-like monster, richly decorated and having a formidable head armed withfangs.... The genital organ of the creature is in the form of a fangedpuma-headfrom which issues a plant-like objectperhaps emblematic of fertility. In this element we have a faint suggestion of that wistfulphallicism which so often accompanies the degeneration of art amongpeople desirous offertility who dimly realize that their vitality is at a low ebb.17 An anthropologist, like Pollock's friend Helen Marot, also could have provided an introduction to the seemingly bizarre figures produced by the Chavin culture. In fact, anyone with a modicum of interest in early cultures would have been aware of Tello's discoveries and claims, for they were hotly debated in the anthropological circles of the thirties and early forties. Tello had established a relative chronology for the Chavin culture that, if correct, made his "Mother Culture" not just the oldest civilization in Peru, but in the entire New World. (Excava- tions at comparable Olmec centers of Mesoamerica were not begun until the end of 1938.) Pan-American historians were understandably buoyed by the new discovery, for the Western Hemisphere could now boast of a civilization analo- gous to that of the Greeks, complete with stone temples. Tello's revolutionary claim also grabbed the attention American anthro- pologists and archaeologists, several of whom devoted years studying the ques- tion of the Chavin culture's reputed primacy. Samuel Lothrop, an archaeolo- gist with the Museum of the American Indian, accompanied Tello in 1925 to Paracas, where the "human dynamo" of Peruvian archaeology discovered yet another remarkable find-a necropolis that eventually yielded more than four hundred mummy bundles. Lothrop subsequently wrote an article on the museum's prized collection of Chavin gold crowns and other gold ornaments, pairing their repousse designs with some of the bas-reliefs and a carved head from the Chavin temple.18 In all likelihood, the museum offered similar visual compari- sons-as with most museum installations of ethnographic objects-to help its patrons understand the context of its display of Chavin-style gold ornaments. Tello's work also had a profound impact on the staff and collections at the American Museum of Natural History. Four of the mummy bundles that Tello recovered from Paracas were anony- mously given to this museum by Nelson Rockefeller, who had flown to Peru to personally oversee their transfer.'9 As the only intact specimens in the United States, Rockefeller's bequest not only enhanced the prestige of the institution, but also enlarged its already-substantial Peruvian collection in the South Ameri- can Hall. Two of the bundles were unwrapped by assistant curator Wendell C. Bennett for an exhibition that opened at the museum in January 1938. The larger of the two bundles, the New York Times reported, included numerous mortuary offerings and a desiccated corpse, which was wrapped in over sixty layers "of beautifully woven and embroi- dered textiles." Later that year, Bennett conducted his own excavations in the northern highlands of Peru. He acquired numerous tracings of the stone carvings from Chavin de Huantar, thirty of which he published in a small monograph, Chavin Stone Carving (1942). But it was Bennett's 1944 publication, The Northern Highlands of Peru, that confirmed the priority of the Chavin culture for any remaining North American skeptics.20 At the 1939 New York World's Fair, Pollock had yet another opportunity to witness examples of pre-Columbian Peruvian art. A large reproduction 18 Fall 1997</page><page sequence="12">7 Reproduction of the Raimondi Stela from Tello, Antiguo Peru, pl. 3 (probably an ink rubbing) of the Raimondi Stela from Chavin de Huantar (fig. 7) was prominently hung in the main hall of the Peruvian Pavilion, where the dignitar- ies gathered for celebrations and ad- dresses. Its eye-catching position was due no doubt to Tello's publications, which had drawn international attention to the stela's nearly seven-foot bas-relief of Wira-Kocha, whom Tello identified as the Supreme Deity of the Andes.21 Visitors to the Peruvian Pavilion must have had to struggle at first to make out the outlines of the Chavin deity, whose standing figure fills only the bottom third of the stela, leaving the rest for an elaborate headdress of stacked faces whose mouths issue forth fangs, snakes, and "tongues" with curled tips. That a single shared line between adjacent forms could simultaneously define and separate both of them must have been puzzling to Western eyes accustomed to a separate contour for each individual form. The most curious aspect of the design for art historian George Kubler was that it "required viewing from both ends," not unlike the design of some Peruvian textiles.22 If Pollock had a drawing of the Raimondi Stela from one of Tello's publications, he too might have discov- ered hidden faces in the inverted image. The Peruvian Pavilion also had a large collection of ceramic vessels and other pre-Columbian artifacts on display, but most visitors commented on the fifty mannequins dressed in ancient costumes recovered from the mummy bundles. Displays dedicated to Peru's colonial and modern eras were also featured. A duplicate of Peru's famous Restaurant Populare drew attention as a sign of Peru's social progress. Here, fairgoers, like workers back in Peru, could buy a full meal for a nickel.23 It is easy to imagine Pollock stretching his meager WPA earnings on a hearty plate of potatoes at this Peruvian counterpart to the Ameri- can soup kitchen. Between 1930 and 1942, at least ten shows mounted in the New York area were dedicated exclusively to ancient Peruvian art, and countless more were organized to promote pre-Columbian art or works by contemporary Latin Ameri- can artists. Even the bastion of French modernism, the Pierre Matisse Gallery, bowed to the trend and organized a show of Peruvian textiles, pottery, and sculp- 19 American Art</page><page sequence="13">8 Jackson Pollock, Mad Moon Woman, 1941.

Of the four Chavin-inspired works, only Mad Moon Woman of 1941 is signed and dated. As such it provides an important anchor to a critical period in Pollock's stylistic development, the significance of which is matched only by his transition to the drip paintings of his artistic maturity. Head is thought to have been painted earlier than Woman, perhaps between 1938 and 1941, while the untitled drawing, often considered the study for Head, is awkwardly post- dated to 1941-42. Mad Moon Woman (fig. 8) was included in Pollock's first one-man show along with Male and Female, and like the composition of that canvas, its color and motifs are arranged within dominant vertical bands suggestive of the modular- width organization of Chavin art. A significant clue to the work's origin appears in the lower left-hand quadrant of the painting-the right profile of an animal head, its bulbous snout pointing to the upper edge of the canvas (fig. 9). While only a single motif, this head bears all the identifying features that characterize a Chavin figure, whether that figure is carved in stone, modeled in clay, etched in plaster, hammered in gold, painted on cloth, or woven. The most notable aspect of the animal head is the particular manner in which the eye is represented. Accentuated by a heavy, upswept brow, the eye stares upward, as in most Chavin-style heads (fig. 10), lending the impression that the figure is caught in a trance. Further evidence of a direct correspondence is provided by the head's bulbous nose and agnathous mouth, with its hidden mandible. The latter is a distinct Chavin trait, often associated with the caiman, whose clenched teeth obscure its lower jaw. The jagged line directly below the head also finds a corollary within the Chavin orbit, specifically the continuous mouth band that is rendered on the Tello Obelisk and elsewhere to define the backbone or joints of an anthropomor- phic creature. 21 American Art</page><page sequence="15">12 Jackson Pollock, Untitled, ca. 1941-42.

Tello, Antiguo Peru, fig. 22, and Tello, Chavin: La Cultura Matriz, fig. 90, respectively The Chavin head in Mad Moon Woman can be further identified as belonging to a snake, which, with its collared neck and striped body, resembles the male genitalia on the Tello Obelisk (see d in fig. 6). Snakes, however, rarely appeared by themselves in the Chavin repertoire except as imagery on small artifacts, such as metal objects and ceramic vessels (fig. 11). If Pollock chose a larger figural representation as his model for the snake head in Mad Moon Woman, the other modular units that would have accompanied the head might now lie beneath subsequent applications of paint. In Pollock's untitled drawing, two snakes climb the sides of a disembodied head and meet eye-to-eye at the crown, forming a sort of"topknot" (fig. 12). The visual equation made between snakes and hair in Pollock's drawing is pure Chavin (Medusa notwithstanding). Snakes were routinely substituted for hair, whiskers, tips of feathers, and even wrinkles.25 Tello repeatedly encountered this motif on dozens of large stone portrait heads that once decorated the main temple at Chavin de Huantar (fig. 13).26 Many were carved with monstrous jaguarlike features, signifying a shaman's physical transformation while in a drug-induced trance; others assumed a more humanoid appearance. Despite the individual differences, nearly all have snakes carved-or more commonly, etched-on the rounded surfaces of the head.

Pollock-Krasner Foundation, New York were often presented in a fashionable topknot (fig. 13, bottom), not unlike that sported by Pollock's untitled drawing, a probable self-portrait from the early forties. The richly modeled features of the face itself are atypically plastic for drawings from this stage in Pollock's career, but they bear a noted resemblance to a self- portrait painted a decade earlier (fig. 14). Perhaps Pollock resurrected his earlier style after studying the naturalism and plasticity of Moche "portrait" vessels (fig. 15), descendants of the stone heads from Chavin de Huantar and the more fiercesome portrait vessels of the Chavin era (fig. 16). These Moche vessels (then known as early Chimu) were among the most avidly collected of all Peruvian artifacts, fetching the highest prices on the New York market and holding center stage in such exhibitions as MoMA's American Sources of Modern Art in 1933.27 Pollock may have recognized that both types of portrait vessels-the ferocious Chavin and the benign Moche-were portraits of shamen, only under different states of transformation. His untitled drawing suggests that he did, for the self- portrait in the center melds the naturalis- tic features of the Moche portrait with the characteristic snakelike hair of the Chavin, and a disembodied head in the upper-right corner displays the more pronounced hallucinatory qualities of older Chavin examples. Francis O'Connor and Eugene Thaw, the authors of the catalogue raisonne of Pollock's work, noted a visual similarity between the two heads in Untitled from 1941-42 and the tightly cropped face in Head (fig. 17) from 1938-41. Despite the dates assigned to the drawing and paint- ing, the heads in Untitled were judged to be probable studies for the painted one, often described as an angry bull-man.28 Like Picasso's many depictions of the Minotaur (which Pollock certainly knew), the image is thought to represent the artist's alter ego. Pollock's alter ego, however, is menaced by what some see as a devouring snake in the striped serpen- tine form that crawls along the brow, over the nose, and across part of the bottom lip. Although there are marked differ- ences between Pollock's bull-man and its "studies," their portraitlike qualities and snake motifs evidence a clear affinity. Both Untitled and Head, it now seems obvious, were adapted from the Chavin repertoire of stylistic conventions. Though far from definitive, the canvas bears a more compelling resemblance to 23 American Art</page><page sequence="17">15 Moche pottery jar, A.D. 400-500.

Museo Nacional de Antropologia y Arqueologia, Lima, Peru the characteristic Chavin forms found on a typical stirrup-spout vessel (see fig. 16) than it does to either study. The painting's fierce animal aggression, absent in both studies, is amply recorded on the body of these ceramic vessels, defined by raised bands that typically depict a grimacing jaguar. This class of pottery, which Tello designated as Chavin, usually possesses highly burnished, lustrous black surfaces, which are occasionally embel- lished with the application of red pigment in the recesses of the design or with silver graphite on roughened areas of the surface. The vessels' raised surfaces are conceived as bands of equal width, whether defining the eyebrows or the snarling upper lip. This regularity in Chavin ceramic design demonstrates the same principle of modular width that governs its lithic art. The manner in which Pollock's Head seems to echo the polished blackware vessels of the Chavin era is uncanny. First, the face of the bull-man emerges as a ghostlike apparition against a rich, black background, as if the white paint were merely recording reflected light off a lustrous surface. Secondly, the forms of the face are simplified to bands of equal width. Lastly, the natural recesses of the bull-man's face are filled in with glowing color. Given these fundamental parallels, it is tempting to search for specific features that might be shared with a photograph 24 Fall 1997</page><page sequence="18">17 Jackson Pollock, Head, ca. 1938- 41.

Pollock-Krasner Foundation, New York of a stirrup-spout vessel that Tello included in three of his publications (fig. 18; a dotted line has been superimposed to aid comparison).29 Consider, for example, the striped, black-and-white band that has been likened to a snake in Pollock's Head. Might this serpentine feature be a simple elaboration of the notches that are pressed into the eyebrows just above the nostrils in Tello's example? Likewise, the "bull's horns" could be residual sections from the stirrup-spout, while the central eye crowning Pollock's bull's head could be an imaginative 25 American Art</page><page sequence="19">transformation of the pyramidal shape between the base of the vessel's handles. Finally, the mouth in Head might be seen as the result of the Western artist's compulsion to supply the unfamiliar agnathous mouth with a bottom lip. Pollock did so by wrapping a figure-eight band, or guilloche (another Chavin motif), around the jaguar's two rounded teeth, thereby eliminating the central fang. Yet Pollock's bull-man is far from tame. Fangs menacingly overhang each cheek, reinforcing his ferocious visage. Pollock's reattribution of Chavin sources for Untitled and Head does not alter the impression that both works are essentially self-portraits, nor does it eliminate the possibility that Pollock may have had Picasso's Minotaur in mind when he began creating his own alter ego. Pollock, according to several informants, was fascinated by the half-man/half-beast creatures that populate ethnographic art collections, and he rightly understood them to be portraits of artists-shamen when partially transformed into their alter egos.30 By all accounts then, the artist aspired to the ritual potency inherent in the aboriginal artist's authori- tative forms. Through them, the shaman could heal, receive visions, enter into the spirit world, or be transformed into his "animal other." What better way for Pollock to appropriate the creative force of the "Mother Culture of Peru" than to adapt his own features to the portrait of a Chavin shaman? Transcendent Sight What Pollock discovered in Chavin art was a truly potent artistic language, one that virtually resonated with spiritual meaning. Its primal qualities satisfied his surrealist search for authentic expression, while its set of formal conventions provided him with surprisingly close corollaries to the modernist manipulation of form and space. Pollock's artistic immersion in the Chavin style can thus be understood as the logical consequence of his experience and training. His fascination with its archaic imagery was, first of all, a natural outgrowth of his interest in the spiritual power of native American art from the Southwest and the Northwest Coast, as well as his awareness of pre-Columbian myths as conveyed by the Mexican muralists. Secondly, Pollock's appropriation of Chavfn models to trigger autonomic action was a logical response to the surrealists' ambition to directly access the "unconscious" through "primitive" art and autonomic exercises. Finally, Pollock's application of Chavln formal properties to attain a forceful and legitimate modern expression fulfilled the prevailing expectations of critics and connoisseurs. That New World art had a legitimate role in furthering the cause of American modernism is summed up by Holger Cahill in the catalogue for MoMA's American Sources ofModern Art (1933): "Ancient American art has come to be valued ... as one of the great arts of the world, a profound and original expression of the spirit of man which has much to offer contemporary culture."31 The ubiquity of ancient American art in New York presumably made a lasting impression on Pollock, who was already predisposed to accepting the validity of its forms. But it was illustrations on the printed page that apparently captivated Pollock most. These he studied exten- sively for their inherent rhythms and recurring motifs. Echoes of those pub- lished images still linger in works like Male and Female, Mad Moon Woman, Untitled, and Head. Although illustra- tions of Chavin artifacts appeared in numerous publications prior to 1941, only Tello's "Wira-Kocha" of 1923 and Antiguo Peru of 1929 offered precedents for Pollock's Chavfn-based artwork.32 And yet the drawings and poor-quality photographs in Tello's publications, 26 Fall 1997</page><page sequence="20">18 Chavin-style stirrup-spout vessel from Tello, Antiguo Perui, fig. 67. Area within dotted outline is compared to the features in Pollock's Head however compelling they may have been for Pollock, could not have conveyed the lustrous surface of Chavin blackware or the subtle red or silver coloration that often embellished such ceramics. To truly appreciate the sensual richness of Chavin art, Pollock would have had to see these precious artifacts in person. When Pollock looked at Chavin art, his stare must have been frequently returned, for eyes are the most common figural element in Chavin art. The carved reliefs on the Tello Obelisk or the Raimondi Stela (see fig. 7) intimidate with their profusion of staring eyes. It hardly seems coincidental that eyes are the only clearly recognizable subject in Eyes in the Heat (fig. 19), a transitional work that antici- pates Pollock's more famous drip paint- ings, like Cathedral of the following year (fig. 20). Though the eyes have vanished in Cathedral, its arabesque lines recall their form and resonate with controlled energy. The lines multiply in tautologous profu- sion over the canvas, much as the etched line on the Raimondi Stela extends across the stone in measured rhythms. Much as the stela's Supreme Deity must be seen from both ends, Cathedralcan be viewed from either end without jeopardizing the stability of its vertically structured webs. It is the ambiguity of line, however, that is the critical factor in both the painting and the stone monument. Unlike Western art's contour, the line in Chavin art does not divide the object from its background or positive space from negative space. The line that simultaneously describes two forms belongs to neither. In these paradoxical ways, the Chavin line recalls Michael Fried's assessment of Pollock's singular achievement. "An examination of any of Pollock's finest painting," he wrote, reveals that his all-over line does not give rise to positive or negative areas .... There is no inside or outside to Pollock's line or to the space through which it moves... Pollock has managed to free line not only fiom its function of representing objects in the world, but also from its task of describ- ing or bounding shapes.33 Pollock's refusal to explain his work and his general unwillingness to acknowl- edge sources other than his own uncon- scious mind served to cloak his work in mystery. Shortly after his first one-man show in 1943, Pollock assumed a public stance that left him little or no room for future maneuvering. In an interview with Sidney Janis, he asserted, "To attempt an explanation of the inexplicable could only destroy it."34 But, in fact, the discovery of Pollock's Chavin sources only enhances our appreciation of his struggle to effect a metaphysical leap from archaic models to a "timeless" expression. Even so, the real significance of the visual connection between Pollock's art and Andean imagery lies in what it reveals 27 American Art</page><page sequence="21">19 Jackson Pollock, Eyes in the Heat, 1946.

Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Bernard J. Reis about Pollock's intimate understanding of the central issues that preoccupied the artists of his generation. Far from being a mere vehicle for unrepressed psychic energy and undigested impressions, Pollock absorbed the lessons of Benton's rhythmical movements, Graham's space units, Picasso's grid, and Mir6's all-over design, and-like the surrealists-he sought entry into the unconscious mind through "primitive" art. His search, decidedly private and personal, led him ever deeper into the hemisphere's remote past, until he found that primal echo of the modern "isms." His challenge was "to assimilate the constructive vigor" of the Chavin shaman-artist without, as Siqueiros warned, "falling into lamentable archaeological reconstructions."35 The painting Male and Female has with good reason attracted considerable critical attention since it was first 28 Fall 1997</page><page sequence="22">displayed in Peggy Guggenheim's gallery. Its tense union of freedom and structure suggests the free application of surrealist automatism constrained by the formal arrangement of the cubist grid. On the other hand, there is no logical reason why Pollock's renewed admiration for Picasso in the late thirties would have required that he suppress his ardor for ancient American art. Instead, the two could be grafted together to form a wholly new synergism. The sudden manifestation of Pollock's singular expression, seemingly spontaneous and without precedent, ensued only after a sufficient period of reflection, and like all new developments, it was dependent on causal factors too numerous to extricate from the final, consummate statement. William Rubin convincingly demon- strated that Pollock's art was not an ahistorical phenomenon, but an approach forged from the lessons of impressionism, cubism, and surrealist automatism.36 Missing from this list is the art of the Americas, whose intrinsic rhythms were not abandoned in 1941 but fused instead into the amalgam. It must be more than mere coincidence that the structure of the Raimondi Stela and Pollock's mature drip compositions are similarly characterized by relentlessly repeated curling forms held fast within parallel lines. Just as Picasso had appropriated the geometric forms of African art to redefine European art, Pollock adopted the linear rhythms of Chavin art as a means of both maintain- ing and transcending his American roots. Because of his "fervent desire in the early forties ... to create a 'parallel' version of Picasso,"37 Pollock sought to achieve this goal by welding his own artistic inheritance to a "primitive" tradition. Only this time, the New World-not the old one- would be subsumed in the shamanistic- artistic transformation.</page><page sequence="23">Notes I am indebted to Helen Harrison, director of the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center, for her encouragement and insights.
