The excavation has attracted the attention of scholars because Byzantine Petra remains largely unstudied. The area is best known for its rock-cut tomb façades built by the Nabataeans in the centuries just before and after the birth of Christ. The church measured 78 by 45 feet, had three apses and three entranceways, and its walls are preserved up to nine feet above floor level. Much of the material used in the construction of the church, such as capitals, door jambs, and reliefs, may have come from the already ruined monuments of the Nabataean period. The mosaic floor designs, stylistically dated to the early sixth century, depict native and exotic animals and a variety of vessels, as well as anthropomorphic representations of the seasons, oceans, earth, and wisdom flanked by images of birds, fish, and other animals. Excavators with the American Center of Ori- ental Research (ACOR) in Amman are associat- ing the collapse of the church's walls and columns with an earthquake that hit Petra in A.D. 551. Fire from the quake is thought to have burned the scrolls, which are still readable in places. Byzantine Greek script has been deci- phered on the scroll fragments, in addition to a cursive script yet to be identified. One fragment has been tentatively translated "Flavianus Patri- archus," an apparent reference to Flavianus, a patriarch of Antioch, who was banished to Petra in the early sixth century by the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius. The arrangement of the texts suggest that they were personal writings such as sermons or letters. The structure in which the scrolls were found may have been a monastery. - Glen L.

Greece had claimed that the jewelry was looted in the late 1970s from tombs near Aidonia in the southern part of the country (see ARCHAEOL- OGY, September/ October 1993). The Michael Ward Gallery, which had tried to sell the collec- tion for $1.5 million, transferred the artifacts in the presence of officials from the Greek National Museum in Athens. A Greek-American orga- nization, the Society promotes awareness and understanding of Greek culture. Loukas Tsilas, the Greek ambassador to the United States, announced the return, not- ing "our main purpose was to make a point that objects of this value cannot be sold into private hands. They have to belong to humanity. So this is a great victory." The ambassador characterized the Ward Gallery's action as "made out of respect for the art and culture of Greece." Both sides avoided a long legal struggle, and the gallery will undoubtedly realize tax benefits from the donation.- -M.R.

The images, taken by remote oper- ated vehicles, show amphoras, bricks, and glass bottles lying on the seafloor. According to researchers with Italy's Technical Service for Underwater Archaeology, the Roman galley was carrying the amphoras once filled with olive oil from the Roman province of Africa (modern-day Tunisia) to Rome. Debris from the other two wrecks, which date to the sixteenth or seventeenth century, includes rigging, a large anchor, and guns similar to those used on seventeenth-century Spanish frigates. Because of the site's depth, some 10,500 feet, further investigation of the wrecks is unlikely. All 81 people aboard the chartered DC 9, flying from Bologna to Palermo, were killed when the plane crashed near the island of Ustica almost ten years ago. An investigation failed to determine the cause of the crash. The recent photography of the site was part of a re-investisration requested by relatives of the victims. - - Giovanni Lattanzi March/April 1994 19</page><page sequence="3">C harks Nungesser and François Coli stand in the cockpit of the ill-fated White Bird. A metal fragment believed to be from the Oiseau Blanc (the White Bird), which dis- appeared during an attempt- ed first nonstop flight between Paris and New York, has been found in a pond in southeastern Newfoundland. The plane and its crew, Charles Nungesser and François Coli, both decorated WW I aviators, vanished on May 9, 1927, 13 days before Charles Lindbergh's success- ful flight from New York to Paris in The Spirit of St. Louis. Newfoundland residents reported either seeing or hearing the plane overhead on the morning of May 9. Local stories of a "plane in the pond" led The Interna- tional Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) to survey the site, where they found the metal frag- ment. "A pond would have been a perfect place to land since the plane was designed to land on water," says Richard Gillespie, executive director of TIGHAR, a non- profit organization based in Delaware. L'Oiseau Blanc jet- tisoned its cumbersome wheels on takeoff according to plan, and then headed north over the English Channel, Ireland, and the North Atlantic toward New York Har- bor, where it was to land on its water-tight hull. ; The metal fragment, covered in places with light blue paint, is being analyzed to see if the paint matches that on the plane's wheels, currently on display in Paris 's Air and Space Museum. The TIGHAR team, along with Canadian archaeologists, will return to the pond in May to look for additional evidence. "The engine, if found, will definitively determine if indeed we have L'Oiseau Blanc" says Gillespie. - - A.M.H.S. o 8 3 5 H 0 H 1 0 u 1 X 1 H o.'

I o E The middle-aged well-preserved man, skeleton nailed to of his a middle-aged man, nailed to his coffin with eight-inch iron spikes, has been found in a nineteenth-cen- tury Turkish cemetery near the north harbor of Mytilene, the prin- cipal city of the Greek island of Lesbos. Researchers from the Uni- versity of British Columbia and the Tenth Ephoreia of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities discovered the skeleton in a stone-lined crypt hol- lowed out of an ancient city wall. They had been excavating a gov- ernment-owned plot in a study of Mytilenean archaeology. The man had been nailed through his neck, pelvis, and ankle. According to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century travelers, suspected vampires were nailed to their caskets to keep them from rising from the dead. That a Moslem would be buried this way is of particular interest since such burials were predominantly a Chris- tian practice. - Hector Williams 22 Archaeology</page><page sequence="5">Villa Re-excavation Polychrome mosaics, fluted columns, and PREVIOUSLY UNNOTICED ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS WERE FOUND DURING A RE-EXCAVATION OF THE ANCIENT VlLLA of the Papyri at Herculaneum. The largest Roman RESIDENCE EVER DISCOVERED, THE VILLA WAS FIRST EXPLORED IN 1750 BY SWISS ENGINEER KARL WEBER, YIELDING ALMOST 100 PIECES OF BRONZE AND MARBLE SCULPTURE AND A LIBRARY CONTAINING ONE OF THE LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF PAPYRI FOUND OUTSIDE Egypt. Like similar houses in Pompeii and Hercula- NEUM, THE VILLA WAS BURIED BY THE ERUPTION OF MT. Vesuvius on August 24, a.D. 79. In THE VILLA'S SMALL PERISTYLE, OR ATRIUM, Baldassare Conticello, Superintendent of Antiq- uities at Pompeii, recovered many bases and drums FROM HANDSOMELY FLUTED COLUMNS, ALONG WITH POLY- CHROME MOSAIC STRIPS BETWEEN COLUMNS THAT WERE OVERLOOKED BY WEBER. CONTICELLO ALSO CLEARED POLYCHROME MOSAIC FLOORS IN OTHER ROOMS, RELO- CATED AND MEASURED A POOL IN THE CENTER OF THE VILLA'S LARGE PERISTYLE, AND REMOVED FOR STUDY PIECES OF CARBONIZED WOOD - PERHAPS PARTS OF SHELVES THAT HELD THE PAPYRI. Researchers also discovered that the villa WAS NOT BUILT ON JUST ONE LEVEL, AS WEBER'S ARCHI- TECTURAL DRAWINGS INDICATE, BUT WAS GRACEFULLY TERRACED TOWARD THE SEA. THE ORIENTATION OF THE VILLA WITH RESPECT TO THE WESTERN SIDE OF POMPEII AND THE ANCIENT COASTLINE WAS ALSO CLARIFIED. Excavations at the villa will continue WHEN FURTHER FUNDS ARE RAISED. PLANS MAY INCLUDE REINFORCEMENT OF THE RE-EXCAVATED TUNNELS SO THE PUBLIC CAN SAFELY VISIT THE SITE. - Ann Olga Koloski-Ostrow March/April 1994 23</page><page sequence="6">A well-preserved mosaic of a dog circular guarding mosaic of a dog guarding a pot was recently discovered at the construction site of the new library in Alexandria. The mosa- ic, dating to either the Ptolemaic or Roman period, is ten feet in diameter and consists of four concentric circles enclosing a black-spotted dog with four white paws. "We've never seen anything like it," said Dorya Said, director of the Greco- Roman Museum of Alexandria. The Egyptian government has halted construction at the library in accordance with Egyptian law, which forbids con- struction on sites not declared "free of antiquities." Additional discoveries in the area include an underground cistern and stat- ues of Ptolemy II and his wife dating to the third century B.C. The dog mosaic and the other finds were saved from destruction by Muhammed Awad of the private Alexandria Preservation Trust, who cam- paigned to stop bulldozers from preparing the land for construc- tion. "We just knew the area was once the site of Ptolemaic palaces, so we expected many artifacts. That's why I worked hard to prevent the construction company from using heavy equipment," said Awad. "We stopped the destructive work just in time." - Jos M.

Such a move would have a significant impact on the interna- tional antiquities trade; some art galleries in larger Swiss cities are known centers of artifact launder- ing where recently looted objects are bought and sold. Ratification must be approved by parliment before becoming law.. ..The largest Roman hoard ever found in Britain - some 14,780 gold and silver coins known as the Hoxne treasure (see ARCHAE- OLOGY January/February) - has been valued at £1.75 million ($2.5 million) by the British Museum, where the coins are now being held. The museum will compensate Eric Lawes, the treasure's finder, for its full value. Because the Museum's annual purchasing budget is £IA million ($2.1 million), outside sources of funding are being sought.... The age of a one and a half-inch fig- urine on display at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem is being hotly disputed. Fabio Frachten- berg, the museum's curator for prehistoric periods, claims the object is 300,000 years old, which would make it by far the oldest statuette in the world. Many experts, however, are not con- vinced that grooves in the fig- urine are man-made, or that Stone Age people 300,000 years ago had reached such a state of artistic development. Most schol- ars believe that people first start- ed carving statuettes 35,000 to 40,000 years ago Excavation for Athens's new $2.6 billion metro has yielded a host of finds, including three fourth-cen- tury B.C. metal workshops, part of a main street that led to ancient Marathon, Roman baths from the second century A.D., part of a Roman aqueduct, water pipes, and tombs. 26 Archaeology</page></plain_text>
