Declaration of Independence The truth of truths consists in this, thai it is self-evident, self-subsistent. It is light. You don't get a candle to see the sunrise. Ralph Waldo Emerson This paper is a prologue to what we hope will be an expanded discus sion of trust, vulnerability, and deceit in business organizations in the United States. Its major concerns are 1) identifying an applied ethical or philosophical basis for trust when deceit is pervasive, and 2) de termining what can be done to protect trusters from deceit within organizations. A dismaying fact is the limited systematic philosophical discussion of these issues found during the review of the literature for this paper, a situation unimproved from a decade earlier when Bernard Barber's (1983) similarly fruitless search led him to call for more systematic work on "trust."1 Reflections on the thin literature available have led us to conclude that a sufficient philosophical basis for trust is embedded in social contract reasoning. Although other starting points may produce stronger results, it is fruitless to discuss trust without considering vulnerability and the potential for deceit that arises from trusting relationships. The power that social contract theory brings to this discussion lies in its explicit recognition of the nature of subjugation,</page><page sequence="2">68 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal which often arises from the practice of deceit in trusting relationships (Reiman 1990: 91-96). We agree with Reiman that embedded within social contract theory is a general moral code based on egalitarian relationships which is violated by deceit. We also believe that both vulnerability and deceit must be more directly integrated into discussions of trust, particularly since, as noted below, trusters are often popularly viewed as both naive and gullible. While social contract theory undergirds our form of government in the United States, the "contract" has been incompletely extended. While we sympathize with the view expressed by Capen (1990) that American moral regeneration requires a return to the ethical principles on which this country was founded, we also recognize that the Founding Fathers were more interested in delineating a circumscribed sphere of government activity, separating public from private life, than in defining moral conduct. One result is that in our culture different standards of behavior are often viewed as operative in public versus private life. Those who control private resources under the protections of in corporation as for-profit enterprises frequently are viewed as not having to meet the same standards of conduct as public agents. In response, we shall suggest that the "self-evident" principles of the Declaration of Independence and of popular intuitionist philosophers such as Emer son provide a basis for an extension of social contract reasoning which includes a consistent standard of conduct in private as well as public matters. Contemporary discussions of trust are stimulated by evidence that violations of trust abound in private business and professional life. However, whether some of the "self-evident" and "self-subsistent" propositions of a social contract apply in private affairs may be contested. In the two business cases provided below, the violations of trust are clear to all-they are self-evident and self-subsistent. Yet, no reasonable recourse is offered to the deceived trusters. In fact, the trusters even are censured for their failure to accept deceit with stoic equanimity. Such violations of trust may be considered by many to represent a regrettable but not censorable result of the division and control of wealth in free enterprise economies. However, in terms of</page><page sequence="3">Trust, Vulnerability, and Deceit in Business Organizations 69 Emerson's metaphor cited at the beginning of this essay, we believe such a conclusion can only represent one-candle-power ethics. The philosophical basis for "trust" in the United States is shaky and badly in need of a firmer foundation than has been provided or can be fully provided here. Nevertheless, we hope to shape an argu ment that may contribute to further discussion and research. The argument in this paper begins with a statement of a major concern: The significant body of literature taught at business schools which argues that trusting behavior is personally (and finan cially) rewarding appears inconsistent with views emanating from popular culture. In the section entitled "The Elastic Philosophical Foundation of Trust," we define trust, vulnerability, and deceit in interpersonal terms. We argue that recent attempts, such as those by Barber (1983), to redefine trust in organizational terms merely make an already bad situ ation worse. With the expansion of modern, large-scale organizations and the extension of neoclassical economic theory in which persons are equated with commodities or objects, rationalizations for the violation of trust abound. These rationalizations mark a clear departure from the classical concept of trust. We reiterate an argument made by James Q. Wilson (1991: 139-148) that the most commonly cited proponent of classical economic theory, Adam Smith, viewed the equation of moral sentiments, self-interest, and economic gain as both economically and morally destructive. Our theory of "The Five Dimming Points of Light" argues that deceivers in modern, large-scale organizations will seek to "move" ethi cal discourse into arenas in which violations of trust are obscured by organizational and impersonal rhetoric. We then present two cases of the violation of trust in professional organizations. Last, we argue that discussions of trust, vulnerability, and deceit in business and profes sional organizations must remain in the forefront, and we make modest proposals for correctives. "Don't You Trust Me?" Trust is an interpersonal relation, an intentional relationship between two or more persons. Some recent literature, most notably Barber</page><page sequence="4">70 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal (1983), wrongly suggests that "trust" can also exist among institutions or organizations and even among organizations and persons. Such a definition, we assert, is both methodologically unsound and ethically vacuous.2 Barber's contention is rooted in an anthropomorphic stance we think of more accurately as corpomorphic, and implicitly imbues a legal entity with organic capacities, an argument for moral agency we find implausible at best. Such a definition of trust can be viewed as consistent with attempts to reduce individual ethical responsibility; or, from a cynic's perspective, to create fattened trusting sheep to feed the appetite of the advantaged untrustworthy wolves; or, alternatively, in the metaphor used in this essay, to mistakenly dim the light which should be placed on censurable acts. Trust, as the concept is commonly used, presumes an acceptance of individual vulnerability and responsibility. Although the specific meaning of "trust" is a matter of debate in organizational behavior and management literature, Deutsch (1958), Zand (1972), Giffin (1967, 1968), Argyris (1965), Cressey (1953) and many others recognize that trusting behavior is inherently risky. That is, trusters place themselves at greater risk of unexpected, unpleasant outcomes by trusting than if they do not. A trusting relationship can be established when a person chooses to believe statements of another. Additional necessary conditions for the trust relation are that the truster must believe that the trusted both intends to be truthful and to do the truster no harm. The existence of a trust relationship implies that the truster intends to act on the basis of this relationship, and that the trusted must be aware that this relationship is a basis for the intended acts of the truster. While the final decision to trust rests with the truster, those who are trusted may actively solicit a trust relationship, and this is particularly true of those who intend to deceive. Vulnerability is unavoidable in a trust relationship, since the actual intent of the trusted can only be known ex post, not ex ante. Deceit arises when the trusted, aware that his intentions are assumed to be honorable and that the truster has let down her guard, is either un truthful or intends to do the truster harm; in effect, the deceiver takes advantage of the trusting relationship. While many persons believe they are more talented than others in identifying trustworthiness and in protecting themselves from deceit,</page><page sequence="5">Trust, Vulnerability, and Deceit in Business Organizations 71 such an assertion is more open to debate than most assume. Everyone is potentially susceptible to a "con." Unfortunately, in highly organized, interrelated modern societies there often appears to be no good alter native to trust, even given that the complexity of such societies opens doors to deceit. Indeed, the consequences of pervasive distrust can be econom ically and socially damaging. Economists writing on underdeveloped financial and commodity markets in the Third World argue that op timal markets and economic growth fail to materialize due to lack of trust and trust-worthiness.3 Trust was and remains an essential com ponent in the expansion of the U.S. economy, despite countless examples of fraud and deceit. The American economy would fracture without an assumption that members, while working to maximize per sonal gain, operate under some semblance of trustworthiness. While one should recognize that trust often possesses elements of a social or economic exchange relationship in which the truster accepts some vulnerability in order to obtain something from the trusted, such as expert advice or opinion, the existence and even the utility of such exchange relationships is neither a sufficient nor necessary explanation for why one should trust. Autarchy is a theoretically possible alternative?such as Thoreau at Waiden Pond or Yeats in his "bee-loud" glade on the Lake Isle of Innisfree. Moreover, trusting relationships may arise outside of any explicit social-exchange considerations. The Elastic Philosophical Foundation of Trust Given that trusting makes one vulnerable, that deceit is ubiquitous, and that "trusters" are often perceived to be "suckers," why should one trust? If deceit pays, why be trustworthy? Most would agree that a general obligation to be trustworthy and trusting pervades moral philosophy, but reasons for this obligation rarely are explicitly discussed.4 When "trust" is mentioned in the busi ness and organizational behavior literature, the focus is on definitions and consequences of lack of trust (distrust); the necessity for, even the righteousness of trust is assumed. Our search through earlier, post-Scholastic philosophical discus sions of reasons to trust were not very fruitful until we reached Rousseau. To the extent that trust is discussed at all in earlier writings,</page><page sequence="6">72 Business &lt;? Professional Ethics Journal one finds assertions of the utility both of truthfulness in Montaigne (1588: 30-38) and of the perception of trustworthiness in Machiavelli (1532: 127-131), the distinction between simulation and dissimulation in Francis Bacon (1597: 17-20), and moral assertions such as those of the Due de La Rouchefoucauld (1665, p. 48), who tells us: Tt is more shameful to distrust one's friends than to be deceived by them." These post-Scholastic aphorisms about trust or trustworthiness appear to rest on two incongruous grounds: 1) virtue is its own reward, and 2) a kind of ad hoc skepticism-such as Montaigne's admission that his memory was so poor that he would always be caught in a lie; therefore, he should not lie or deceive. Self-rewarding virtue and ad hoc reasoning are weak grounds on which to stand as the biography of La Rouchefoucauld indicates; however, one might argue that the Due was a poor judge of character or trusteeship.5 Admittedly, in his writings, the Due cautions that only gentlemen be included in noble discussion and, presumably, trust, since the hoi polloi "never do anything because of reason" (p. 28). Yet, if the per spicacious author of the Maxims could not judge trustworthiness in a world of nobility and reason, what hope would there be in the world of the bourgeoisie? The humanist answer to the question "don't you trust me?" based on ascription or reliance on a social code of behavior, appears both weak and dangerous. Thomas Hobbes, an English contemporary of the Due who believes that "the fountain and original of justice is the covenants people make" (1651: 201-202), distrusts trust, and argues the case for a Sovereign monarch to enforce covenants. Otherwise, in Hobbes' emerging bourgeois world "he that should be modest and tractable and perform all he promises in such time and place where no man else should do so should but make himself a prey to others and procure his own certain ruin" (p. 215). There are no reasonable grounds, not even birth or title, Hobbes argues, through which one can trust another except via the Sovereign enforcement of contract or covenants. Hobbes is alluding to the problem that there is no valid way ex ante to judge trustworthiness. Therefore, one should assume all persons are equally ignoble, says Hobbes; "the people" are to accept the vulnerability of trusting relationships, society has an obligation to elimi nate poor trusteeship and protect the truster (264-269). However,</page><page sequence="7">Trust, Vulnerability, and Deceit in Business Organizations 73 Hobbes' prescription may be fatal, for he provides no grounds for trusting a Sovereign trustee. Unlike Hobbes, Locke (1690) and later social contract theorists optimistically assert the inherent "reasonableness" and trustworthiness of all persons. These theorists seek to extend to everyone rights pre viously guaranteed only to nobles. In this sense, social contract theory is ennobling, equalizing, and nonsubjugating. "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. He who believes himself the master of others does not escape being more a slave than they ..." begins Rousseau's On the Social Contract (1762: 141). Rousseau's approach to the social contract is to ask how people can live in a civil order "so that justice and utility do not find them selves at odds with one another" (Book I, Introduction). This moral question is resolved by individuals not only "contracting" with others but within themselves to form an association. Thus, individuals make not only a Lockean-like contract with others but form a "twofold com mitment" in which the individual is part of the "sovereign" and yet "a member of the state toward the sovereign" (Book I, 7). That is, individuals have encompassing dual roles as both sovereign and subject, and a "citizen" is one who harmonizes obedience and liberty (Book III, 13). The concept of the General Will, in fact, emerges as a corollary arising from the existence of this broad "reciprocal commitment." Unfortunately, social contract theory does not provide us directly with comfortable and consistent reasons for answering yea or nay to 'Don't you trust me?" If anything, there is a contradiction built into post-Hobbesian social contract theory between, on the one hand, a widened code of gentlemanly and virtuous behavior to include all persons, not only nobles, and, on the other hand, the empirically observed behavior of materialistic persons inevitably so troubling to Rousseau. In the words of Benjamin Franklin (1736): "He that sells upon trust loses many friends and always wants money." In the bour geois world, Poor Richard is backed by a battery of attorneys, not a copy of Burke's Peerage or Rousseau's Social Contract. Nevertheless, social contract theory 1) extends the old definition of "gentleman" and its implicit moral code to include everyone, a risky business as Voltaire (1759) reminds us in Candide, and 2) it recognizes the interpersonal importance of contract, with a promise of enforcement by organization and law. Yet, it is a pre-institutional theory in that it</page><page sequence="8">74 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal applies only to interpersonal relationships. Social contract theory is an elastic band stretched to its breaking point in a modern institutional ized world of large scale organizations in which individuals often are submerged and "cowardly souls" (Rousseau's terms) seem abundant. A Contract Basis For Trust While it is difficult to extract a theory of trust from social contract rea soning that is applicable to both interpersonal and organizational life, we believe a beginning can be made. Jeffrey Reiman has argued very persuasively that social contract theory provides a basis for nonsubjuga tion, which is the essence of justice and a basis for trust. (1990: 1-22). While we find it difficult to accept Reiman's presentation in toto, the linking of trust with the reasoning behind social contract theory il luminates a number of philosophical and ethical issues. A rightly conceived social contract theory must place "trust" in the center of social relations. First, the operative premise of such a system must be that persons join freely to accept governmental or social ar rangements based upon their belief that such arrangements will do their persons no harm. Second, such a belief must be based on trust of others, since the execution of such an agreement without trust requires subjugation which is itself a violation of the egalitarianism implicit in the theory. All social contract theories require trust? whether in the Sovereign (which is implicitly trusted in Hobbes), in the General Will (realized through a community of trust in Rousseau), or in the separation of Society and the State (which can be trusted due to limited State functions and the right of citizens to rebel in Locke). Furthermore, it appears to us that the only reasonable philo sophical justification for trusting, one consistent with the individual accepting the risk of a trust relationship, is that trust is part of person hood-the recognition that personality or the developed person requires social interaction with other persons not merely to satisfy materialistic ends but as a part of his or her own person. The development of a person requires the ability to empathize with others, and such a result can only arise within relationships which are nonsubjugating. The modern expansion of social contract reasoning post-Hobbes runs parallel to the expansion of the number of potential "trusteds" in a bourgeois world. Instead of one moral order, in which a singular</page><page sequence="9">Trust, Vulnerabilityy and Deceit in Business Organizations 75 Social Contract applies, our bourgeois world has been divided wrongly into a complex of multiple "spheres of justice" (Walzer, 1983). Under a particolored cloak of anonymity afforded by this pluralistic world of large organizations, trusteds often seek to rationalize and gain approval or acceptance of deceit on materialistic or expedient grounds. Or, more directly, one may say that in a world of economic exchange there is a tendency to "move" moral reasoning into consistency with economic or material expediency, particularly when no direct, obvious blame can be attached to the deceit of the trusteds. Spheres of justice provide safe havens for situation ethics. Americans generally accept an ideology of equality within a general moral code which values nonsubjugation, but behave as if civil and economic matters are separable, with the public sphere tightly circumscribed and the private sphere open to competitive, amoral indi vidualism. A major source of confusion can be corrected when one recognizes that Americans have substituted levels or orders of con tracting for a general moral code arising from a Social Contract which emphasizes nonsubjugation. Unfortunately, these levels of contracting have achieved acceptance as "moral codes" used by the trusteds to protect themselves from general obligations as trustees under a Social Contract. Not infrequently, those who are trusted but untrustworthy prefer to and can move the level of moral discourse from a general moral code, of which nonsubjugation is clearly a part, down to one of these lower orders or codes. When deceit is perpetrated, the truster is treated not as a person, but as an object by the trusted, i.e. as any commodity would be treated. To the extent that this can be done without any apparent violation of the rules of social and economic exchange, the modern day sophist can even become a "hero," or at least be rewarded as a shrewd character who knew his chance and took it.6 In our modern world of complex organizations, identifying the existence of a trust relationship becomes especially difficult. There are many reasons for this, perhaps including an increased tendency to lie about or deny the existence of such relationships. Barber's (1983) pre sentation is an example of this confusion. Do people really trust institutions, or is it rather the persons within an institution whom they trust? No ethical justification exists for corporatizing these trust rela tionships, giving them precedence over persons.</page><page sequence="10">76 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal Barber's extension of the concept of "trust" to institutions and organizations not only is anthropomorphic but is also a redefinition of the basic meaning of "trust." Barber does not deal with the traditional notion of trust which is centered on individual and personal responsi bility but with compliance with organizational means and ends. While it is difficult to develop an adequate ethical basis for trust, corporate anthropomorphism (corpomorphism) seems more consistent with Fascism or the mercantilism of Louis XIV than with "trust." Barber's approach represents a retreat from two centuries of gain in social thinking beginning with the Enlightenment and expansion of social contract reasoning. Yet, Barber's approach may be consistent with a form of social thought that has dominated American culture from its colonial and revolutionary beginnings and which depends upon an adamantine wall separating "private" from "public" concerns. At the time of the death of La Rouchefoucauld, the meaning of "contract" and the obligations due under contract were changing in ways well described by Gordon Wood (1992: 162-164). The idea of contract in the pre-Enlightenment world denoted obligations due to superiors by subordinates within patriarchal or patron-client systems. In this pattern of social arrange ments, obligations between individuals were clear, but subject to revision by the superordinate (patriarch or patron). Within such social patterns, La Rouchefoucauld reasonably could suggest that distrust of friends was "shameful" because superiors had rights, divine or otherwise, to unilaterally redefine their personal obligations. Individuals of equal social rank would either act in trust worthy ways or suffer retaliation at the hands of superiors obligated to patron-client networks. Trust was embedded within a social complex of superior-subordinate ties, which aside from the whim of superiors (Hobbes' Sovereign-problem mentioned earlier), could be enforced through ostracism or immediate retaliation, the Bastille or its local equivalent. At least as early as Locke's First Treatise, such patriarchal "con tractual" arrangements were viewed by progressives as "corruption."7 The commercialization of the eighteenth century brought in its wake the idea of contract as a voluntary, explicit, consensual transaction by equal individuals (or agents) based on conscious acts of will, not social obligation. Such views pervaded even the more intimate sides of human relationships. For example, Lord Chesterfield described his</page><page sequence="11">Trust, Vulnerability, and Deceit in Business Organizations 11 own parent-child relationships as evolving into "contracts" of friendship based on "reciprocal merit" (Wood, 1992: 163). The contractarian ideals of British North American radicals?such as James Wilson, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, the Adamses, Thomas Paine, and others-drew explicitly on Locke and largely ignored Rousseau.8 The writings of Locke have been criticized by modern poli tical theorists for omitting considerations of broad social structure, an interest of Rousseau. One such critic, Andrew Hacker (1961: 285), notes that the great undiscussed issue in Locke?"What kind of society is to give rise to the men and governments that liberalism requires?"? leaves unresolved so many of his problems. Apart from questions of economic and political self-interest and Anglo-American francophobia, within the philosophical perspective of eighteenth century America, it is not too difficult to understand the preference for Locke over Rousseau. Paine and others clearly believed that "America was the only spot in the political world where the principle of universal reformation could begin, so also was it the best in the natural world" (Paine, 1791-1792:156). Essentially, America was an uncorrupted society in which the only relevant issues were the political ones raised by Locke; issues related to the nature of society itself, important to Rousseau, were assumed to be resolved or irrele vant. From the colonial perspective, all freeholders were equal, and all were subject to a gentleman's code which had been an exclusive posses sion of only a few in the earlier feudal world. Jefferson understood many of the problems which arose from an American social contract theory which did not directly address both the nature of society and role of the government and state in social order. In fact, he was one of only a few of the Founding Fathers who despite his admiration for Locke?he considered him among the three greatest men who ever lived?foresaw that Locke's approach was deficient for the reasons noted by Hacker and other modern political philosophers.9 Certainly, after two centuries of American experience and in view of criticism by many of the "cautious" philosophical basis of the Ameri can Revolution (Wood, 1992: 3), it should be possible to give a more sympathetic reading to the concerns raised by Rousseau than is com monly done in the United States (Reiman, 1990). The construction of a more inclusive social contract involves a lessening on the part of Americans of Lockean fears of despotic government and an individual and collective recognition of the need for workable linkages between private and social conduct.</page><page sequence="12">78 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal Attempts by Barber and others to extend the concept of trust to private, large scale organizations in the United States works against such efforts. No reasonable person could possibly trust such organi zations unless they desire a return to the feudal manor; that is, they possess the cowardly souls so disliked by Rousseau. In fact, the com bination of large scale organizations with an American ideology based upon the separation of private and collective interests gives glorious opportunity to the most extreme form of manipulable situation ethics. Not only do agents of such organizations define the relevant situation and applicable ethics, but their definitions are in turn defined to be a private, not collective concern. This behavior represents the rejection of a general moral code which is one of the few substantive bases for trust, social solidarity, and civil conduct. The Five Dimming Points of Light The limitations of situation ethics bring us to our theory of The Five Dimming Points of Light. The farther one moves away from the general moral code which includes individual responsibility, the less clear the distinction between trustworthiness and deceitfulness of the trusted. That is, numerous justifications for violations of trust by deceivers can be found which may be inconsistent with nonsubjugation but rationalized within the "de-personalized" ethics of these lower orders. Or, treatment of individuals as objects rather than persons can be more easily rationalized within the dimness of these lower orders. Rather than insist upon behavior consistent with a general moral code implicit in a social contract, the following moral orders are fre quently invoked by "leaders" of organizations and professions: a social code of behavior; a legal code; a code of ethics; and organizational mores. These lower orders or codes are often presented as protective of individuals; but, in fact, these orders often are used manipulatively by deceivers. The cases reviewed for this paper, only two of which will be dis cussed, are striking in that the violated truster, when wronged, appeals to the general moral code, while the deceiver always tries to justify de ceit at one or more of the lower orders where the truster is deemed to have little or no "reasonable" recourse. Brief definitions and examples of these four lower orders follow before the presentation of the two cases.</page><page sequence="13">TrusU Vulnerability, and Deceit in Business Organizations 79 The social code of behavior indicates what social actions are acceptable and which are not within a given social order. Under a social code certain actions peculiar to a specific society may be ac ceptable, such as deference based on religion, wealth, or race, that would be unacceptable under a general moral code. Legal codes claim that justice is blind. Nevertheless, the enforce ment of contract under the law is both time-consuming and expensive and, despite the existence of legal aid, this recourse is essentially available only to persons with sufficient financial resources. A code of ethics defines morally acceptable relationships between professional or associational peers, and governs the professional conduct of members. Such codes are, by definition, exclusionary, yet allegedly are designed to protect the public. For example, the Hippo cratic Oath may be interpreted as requiring that one physician not testify against another, which can be detrimental to enforcement of general moral precepts. Organizational mores or a "club code" often is advanced as a justi fication for violation of general moral obligations. In fact, the use of the organizational imperative, such as "this is the way things have always been done here for the good [survival] of the organization," is frequently invoked to justify violations of trust and deceit of individuals. Attempts to move moral discourse to these lower orders, except in rare instances of confusion, are almost certainly manipulative: an attempt to disguise intent and reconstruct reality in a light which favors the deceiver. The dimmer the order of discussion under these alterna tives to a general moral code the more likely the truster is to be treated as an object rather than a person. In fact, deceitful trusteds justify their acts on "objective" grounds, and avoid or deny the relevance of trust, deceit, or subjugation. That is, the order of discourse is shifted downward to the level of discourse at which the truster's claims seem weakest. On the other hand, the deceived truster usually must appeal to the general moral code for relief, unless the deceiver is "foolish" enough to document his deceit and place undeniable evidence in the hands of the truster. Two Cases Involving Trust, Vulnerabilityy and Deceit Case 1. Examples of the above phenomenon abound, but a particularly disturbing instance was presented in the "What Would You Do?"</page><page sequence="14">80 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal section of Business Ethics (Wallace, 1992) as a "real" scenario. Steve is abruptly told by his new thirty-two year old boss, Jeanette, that he will have to leave the organization immediately due to "reorganization" and "a performance problem." Stunned, he is presented with two memos: a severance agreement and the reorganization plan. Jeanette refuses to discuss the situation, saying the decision is final. Months before, Steve had been surprised by two bad performance reports issuing from Jeanette, the first of his ten year career with the company. Despite the human resources department's promises to mediate at Steve's request, nothing was done to follow up on his concerns. Steve's first poor performance appraisal came after he ques tioned the ethical implications of a proposed international sales policy of the company at a staff meeting during which his "thoughtful perspective" had been solicited due to "potentially volatile public ex posure to the company." The description of the case concludes with these questions from Steve: "Should I seek legal help? Should I protest the decision? What can I do?" All three of the invited commentators on this case believed that Steve was treated highly unethically (an egregious violation of the general code of ethics occurred), yet all advised that he should leave quietly (appeal to a social code of behavior), avoid "Lone Ranger ethics" (appeal to a code of ethics), work with others in the organiza tion to find a solution?although one respondent correctly noted that the fired employee has no status within the organization (appeal to organ izational mores), and only as a last resort litigate (appeal to the legal code). All the burdens for a solution suggested by the "thoughtful commentators" were placed upon the wronged, now income-less, former employee through mechanisms which can and presumably will be manipulated by the abusive trusteds. One of the three commentators explicitly blamed the former employee for not "confronting" his boss earlier, and a second did so by implication. In fact, subsequent paragraphs of the article indicate that the truster indeed did follow the path prescribed by the commentators. Yet, the editor reported that "as we go to press the company has not taken action to resolve the issue." The prescriptions and the result are not surprising to us. Case 2. After his usual 60 + hour work week at a large national seminar training company, Ken was visited by the Director of Person nel and his boss, the Vice President of Marketing. He was told that his</page><page sequence="15">Trust, Vulnerability, and Deceit in Business Organizations 81 skills were not sufficient for the job, though this had never been communicated to him orally or in writing; in fact, his performance reviews had always described his efforts in glowing terms. Further more, he was told that this assertion was fully documented. He was given only two weeks severance pay, and told to leave after more than four years with the firm. Ken was an exemplary employee who had been rewarded and recognized by the company President, and just the week before had been discussing a promotion with his boss. What happened? Several days after his departure, Ken discovered that indeed he had been under consideration for promotion to the Vice President's own job, for which he was better qualified and educated. The Vice President found out about this. Within days, his boss had prepared a "Ken" file of falsified documents containing poor performance ap praisals, negative reports from clients, complaints about Ken from other vice presidents, a series of back-dated increasingly stern warnings from himself to Ken, and a list of mistakes attributed to Ken's careless ness. He then gave this file to the company President. Ken approached other vice presidents to obtain support for his reinstatement or another job within the firm; however, he soon found that some of them had traded their signatures on some of the falsified forms for resources which Ken's former boss controlled. Yet, these same persons told him privately that his performance was excellent, too exceptional for him to be kept around. Many told him he was a politi cal casualty, not to take it too hard, other jobs were available (leave quietly). But, they warned him, he shouldn't make trouble that might ruin his future employment prospects (avoid "Lone Ranger ethics"). Ken found it difficult to believe that the Vice President-whom he had fed ideas to, socialized with, assisted in numerous ways, and often supported at some cost to himself-would deceive him so grossly. After all, Ken had not actively competed for his boss's job, nor had he even been aware that he was being considered for the position. Attempts to talk to the President of the company were not fruitful; in fact, none of Ken's phone calls were returned (an unsuccessful attempt to appeal to organization mores). Consultations with an attorney indicated that were he to sue, Ken was likely to receive a sizable settlement, but his future employment prospects might be permanently damaged (a legal code of ethics is of little help). Ken ultimately concluded that his insistence on minding his</page><page sequence="16">82 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal own business, trusting his superior, and, ironically, doing a good job cost him his employment. Does Deceit Pay? Both cases cynically suggest, as in Thackeray's Vanity Fair, that virtue is not its own reward, at least in cases of flagrant violations of trust. Violators of trust-deceivers-are often protected by their own organi zations. Indeed, the more ethical person in each of the cases carried the entire burden of the situation virtually alone. The cases indicate that, rather than being welcomed as a light in the dark, victims of and resisters to deceit are viewed with suspicion and perhaps contempt. Indeed, it seems that violated trusters have to defend their cases not in terms of the facts (which are rarely con tested), but rather in terms of their motives-perhaps even why they accepted vulnerability. While the acts of deceit presented here were widely known ("self evident" and "self-subsistent"), successful attempts were made to rationalize, justify, or otherwise minimize the most important ethical concern: Was an individual treated in a nonsubjugating manner fully recognizing his own personhood? The answer is "No!" He was violated in the dimly lit corners we have identified. One who believes in divine justice might argue that these organi zations will suffer for their sins in the competitive arena. They may (or may not), but this is little comfort to the violated trusters. Unfor tunately, the postscripts to our cases indicate that the departures of Steve and Ken from these organizations have depressed their personal incomes and psychological well-being, while the deceivers continue unscathed. Deceit has obviously paid for the deceivers. Summary and Conclusions Our reluctant conclusion is that deception pays well-too well-probably better than trust. Public skepticism that trusting, ethical behavior is rewarded is clearly justified. However, if the argument for the cen trality of "trust" based upon social contract ethics is sound, the fact that "civil" and individual practice departs so far from ethical norms should be of great concern. While there does indeed appear to be concern about the low level of ethical behavior, far too much attention has been given to relieving</page><page sequence="17">Trust, Vulnerability, and Deceit in Business Organizations 83 individuals from ethical responsibility for their acts. Often, one may wonder if the central concern of business ethics is ethics or the pro vision of complex, scholastic rationalizations for misconduct. In this essay, we have chosen to attack the proposition that moral agency of individuals in complex organizations can be somehow lessened. In fact, release from moral agency increases the vulnerability of trusters to deceivers. Arguments by Barber and others which anthropomorphize large scale organizations are dangerous to the extreme, equivalent to a new secular "Divine" Right theory of kingship, and should be resisted. Large scale organization may create structural conditions in some situations under which it seems difficult to assign individual respon sibility for deceit or misconduct. However, complicity in misconduct through failure to determine "the facts" or subscription to rationales based upon protecting the well-being of anthropomorphized institutions can be nothing but a morally censurable act (i.e. deceit) itself for which the individual is clearly responsible. The two cases (and others not presented in this abbreviated essay) suggest that after the act most deceit is transparent, except in dimly lit corners. The truth of the case is usually both self-evident and self subsistent outside one-candle-power ethics. Ethical judgment is not beyond the ken of ordinary men and women. Indeed, democratic theory depends upon the fact that com mon people can tell right from wrong (whether under an oak tree or not) because of a general moral code that is "engraved" in their "hearts." Yet, the development of large, complex institutions and an ethics which serves these institutions through dimming lights provide rationales for deceit and hiding the truth. Current ethical confusion and actions of "responsible" persons in complex organizations are resurrecting a feudal order in which powerful individuals define the structure of ethical discourse (choose sufficiently dim lighting), and a Lateran council of ethicists develops rationales of requisite complexity and opacity. It is no accident that many who now call for moral regeneration, such as Richard Capen, Jr., Vice Chairman of Knight-Ridder, suggest that "parameters of our own values" might be reestablished by using the "moral principles upon which our country was founded" (Capen, 1990). After all, the philosophical beliefs of the Founding Fathers were both a gift of the Enlightenment and the death knell of feudalism.</page><page sequence="18">84 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal John Locke is studied, but Sir Robert Filmer's (1680) defense of Divine Right is a quaint relic, perused only by historians of social thought. Locke lives, while Filmer lies buried in the graveyard of the aristocracy. Yet, one may wonder if these royal bones have been resurrected in new public and private corporate structures. In view of this concern, Capen's plea and that of others would appear to be a useful antidote to ethical malaise or confusion in the United States. Unfortunately, a point missed by Capen is that social contract reasoning as espoused by the Founding Fathers provides a necessary but insufficient condition for a general moral code based on nonsubjugation. Concentrating solely on fulfilling a Founding Fathers' version of the social contract which defines an adamantine boundary between private and public conduct can be morally damaging to both public and private ethics. Jefferson came to realize the deficiencies of Lockean social contract reasoning later in life, although it is not appar ent that he foresaw a solution in an expanded social contract theory. A sound basis for ethics can be found in social contract reasoning, but an extension is required to include what is often defined to be pri vate, personal conduct. Many persons may be uncomfortable with such a conclusion, which on the surface appears to violate the separation of public and personal life, one of the cherished achievements of the American Revolution. However, building an impermeable wall between public and personal conduct now appears neither ethically sound nor socially acceptable. It is not sound for the reasons mentioned in this essay, among the more important of which is thai private deceit is des tructive both of trust and the acceptance of vulnerability required for civil order and informed discourse. Furthermore, the redefining of what is socially and politically acceptable has already led to important breaches in the established wall between "public" and "private." Among the more important of these breaches are "civil rights" acts which do not allow persons to dispose of personal property, i.e. rooms to let, houses to be sold, or dining facilities to be used, on the basis of their "personal" and "discriminatory" choices in the use of private property.10 Reaching a viable social contract requires more public discussion and more directed philosophical investigation than can be provided in a brief essay. Nevertheless, this essay can be a prologue or invitation to such discussions and investigations. A few modest proposals are offered to close this essay.</page><page sequence="19">Trust, Vulnerability, and Deceit in Business Organizations 85 Some Modest Proposals 1. Violations of trust, such as those in the two cases discussed above, should be brought regularly and clearly before the public, identifying untrustworthy persons and organizations. 2. Ethical wills, mentioned by Capen, should be written by all persons, including students in business and ethics courses, and most especially by those in leadership positions, periodically throughout their lives; these wills should directly address the issue of individual subjugation within the organization.11 3. A tradition of liberal education should be encouraged within schools and universities, at the minimum to the point at which an understanding of the philosophical basis of a general moral code can be clearly presented. 4. Leaders within organizations should act to institutionalize the value of trust by fostering a general climate which avoids dimly lit corners and candles, including effective reasonable recourse for trusters when wronged. 5. While we agree that "trust cannot be legislated nor mandated by the courts" (Capen, 1990), all must recognize that courts may be the only recourse for violated trusters in a climate characterized by abuse; therefore, greater legal access will have to be promoted and a broader interpretation of what constitutes a legal violation of contract?one more consistent with the general moral code?will have to be developed. 6. Attempts to move the discussion of ethics and ethical behavior from a general moral code to a lower order or code should be firmly resisted. Unless these and other steps are taken, we risk a newly refeu dalized society wherein those with corporate power, both public and private, will build fiefs in which feudal law will prevail for the privileged and the custom of the manor for the rest. Such a society would be more familiar to La Rouchefoucauld than to contractarians, including our Founding Fathers. When Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase suggested the phrase, "In God We Trust," for our currency, Lincoln surely did not anticipate the extension, "All Others Pay Cash." To us, the statement</page><page sequence="20">86 Business &lt;? Professional Ethics Journal "In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash" reflects today's pervasive cynicism, warranted perhaps by moral reasoning which increasingly is based upon the situational ethic. We prefer to believe that where there's an ethical will, there's a way.

Helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper were made by a reviewer. 1. Due to page constraints some recent work of interest cannot be discussed in this version of our paper. References to the work of Annette Baier (1986) and Bok (1978) are not provided. We have major disagreements with Baier: 1) her concept of "unconscious trust" (p. 235) appears to make almost all social relationships (affection, reciprocity, allegiance, etc.) fair game for moral analysis under a single confusing rubric; 2) she neglects dynamic changes effecting an inclusive incorporation of persons into a "social contract"-an issue touched upon in our paper; and 3) she concentrates her analysis on interpersonal obligations outside an organizational network. Her approach is too different from ours to be subjected to a fair appraisal in this short paper. The work of Bok is of some interest, but is not, in our opinion, organizationally focused. We believe that a more thorough discussion is required of trust, vulnerability, ami deceit in organizational life. 2. We believe that despite the title of Barber's book, his discussion is focused on allegiance, authority, and legitimacy-not trust. The former terms may include trust in cases in which specific individuals are successful in evoking trust, but allegiance, authority, and legitimacy can arise from purely instrumental and emotional relationships. As is clear in our definitions and the discussion of the literature, we view "trust" as an interpersonal and ethical concept. A lengthy discussion of</page><page sequence="21">Trust, Vulnerability, and Deceit in Business Organizations 87 our differences with Barber and some other theorists may be required to defend this view; however, such a discussion is beyond the scope of this paper. 3. See, for example, the culturally unbiased discussion in Goldsmith (1969). Also, Uphoff and Ilchman (1973) offer some offsetting com ments about the way Americans often approach developing countries with "a beam in their eyes." 4. A basis for trust can certainly be found in the ethics of Aristotle (c. 300 BC); however, most modern discussion treats trust or non deceit as axiomatic. See Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics {Book /), and Bernard Gert (1988: 6-7). 5. During his lifetime, the Due had his chateau torched, was be trayed by many friends, and was tossed from the boudoir of the sister of the Great Conde at a time convenient for herself. We are aware of Valmont, Dangerous Liaisons, and other literature written in or describing the world of the Fronde and the Old Regime. We are not arguing that trust was less likely to be violated, though we believe this may be the case, but that our modern world offers many hidden corners in which one can attempt to rationalize deceit. 6. We have in mind the macho images of Gordon Liddy and Oliver North. These characters in their egotistical projections of invulner ability as well as revenues obtained from book sales and personal appearances are sad commentaries on the poor quality and cowardly "virtues" of modern American life. These individuals and others like them represent a cynical argument against the existence of a viable general moral code or, at least, against one based on anything but expediency. 7. Important detailed discussions of the emerging American view of "corruption" and "virtue" appear in Bailyn (1967: 283ff) and Wood (1970, Chapter 1). 8. Jefferson had read Rousseau and had recommended his writings to a number of individuals for their personal libraries; however, Locke remained his preferred source in political philosophy. 9. For example, see Jefferson's often-cited discussion of slavery in Query XVIII in his Notes on the State of Virginia (written in 1781-1782 and published in 1787) in Jefferson (1984). Also, see the perceptive biography which deals with these matters in some detail (Mapp, 1987: 93-115; 1991: 361-385). The other two persons mentioned among the greatest men of modern times by Jefferson were Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton.</page><page sequence="22">88 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal 10. Lest one think that the civil rights acts represented only minor adjustments in relationships between private and personal "rights," one need only to move back some thirty years to the writings and speeches of Senator Barry Goldwater. The arguments used by Goldwater that the U.S. Constitution did not provide for then-debated "civil rights" ("they are neither civil nor a right") for "Negroes" were based not upon racism but upon an interpretation of the American Revolution con sistent with the establishment of an impermeable boundary between private property and public affairs. In the 1964 election, the public in general rejected the impermeability of the private-public boundary, at least on these particular issues. 11. Capen correctly places the tradition of ethical wills within a Judeo-Christian context. However, another tradition is that of the early Roman Republic, often taken as a model by our Founding Fathers. Suetonius briefly comments on these wills, reinstituted at the time of Augustus. As Suetonius notes, they can be a two-edged sword. That is, the wills were used by Augustus to obtain information for his own benefit (Suetonius, c. 138: 53-108). This result would not surprise victims of self-confessions in Maoist China. Capen's suggestion, however, is sound. The call to return to an earlier ethical framework deserves more attention than can be given in this brief paper.
