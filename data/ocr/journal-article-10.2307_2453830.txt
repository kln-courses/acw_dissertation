<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NEW MYRMECOPHILE FROM THE MUSHROOM GARDENS OF THE TEXAN LEAF- CUTTING ANT.1 WILLIAM MORTON WHEELER. ON the ioth of April last, with the assistance of Messrs. A. L. Melander and C. T. Brues, I excavated a large nest of leat- cutting ants (Atta fervens Say), situated in a piece of wood- land a quarter of a mile from the University of Texas. The large burrows, nearly an inch in diameter, were found to ex- tend down to a depth of from three to five feet and to open into large chambers, some of which were fully ten inches across and five to eight inches high. A few of these chambers were traversed by the roots of a large cedar, in the shade of which the ants had dug their formicary. Descending into the pit we had dug, and braving the attacks of tens of thousands of infuri- ated ants, we soon discovered the objects of our search - the mushroom gardens heaped up on the floor, or, more rarely, enveloping, as aerial or "n hanging " gardens, the roots that extended across the chambers. The gardens were hastily extracted - I say hastily because putting one's hand into one of these chambers is like grasping the handles of an electric machine, so valiantly do the ants defend their property. The material, reeking with an odor like that of stale honey, was placed in large class jars. These had to serve as artificial nests, as nests of the Lubbock and Janet pattern were obviously not suited to these aberrant ants. By the following day the ants had completely rebuilt their gardens on the bottoms of the jars. These gardens proved to be very similar to those so carefully described and figured by Mbller 2 for several South American species of Atta (A. disc-ei-a Mayr., A.

The mycelium is kept aseptically clean - i.e., free from all other spe- cies of fungi and even from bacteria -and induced to grow in an abnormal way by bringing forth minute swellings which *1 ~~~~~~~~~1 4.

Moller likens these swellings to the " Kohlrabi " of the German kitchen gardens. they had filched from a mill near their nest. Sometimes they prefer to collect seeds or young flower-buds. In winter, when the leaves have fallen from all the trees except the live oaks and cedars - trees which the Attas avoid, probably because the leaves offer too much resistance to their mandibles -they garner the young leaves of the sorrel and lupine. At such times, especially when the land- scape is flooded with the brilliant Texan sunshine, one may, perhaps, not inap- propriately compare the ant procession with a procession of " Sunday-school children carrying banners " (McCook, On the Architecture and Habits of the Cutting Ant of Texas (Atta fervens), Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phil., pp. 33-40, 1879)-</page><page sequence="4">854 THE AMERICAN XA TURA LIST. [VOL. XXXIV. More recently Forel has studied the habits of two other spe- cies'(Atta cep/halotes L. and A. sexdens L.) in Colombia.' He seems to have given some attention to the role performed by the different casts of worker ants -casts which are also repre- sented in our Attct fervens -in this process of collecting and comminuting the leaves and in cultivating the mushroom. At p. 3 I he says: " The largest workers (soldiers) triturate the leaves and defend the nest. They draw blood when they bite. The indigenes are said to use these insects for closing wounds. They induce them to bite the two lips of the wound and there- upon sever the bodies from the heads, which then serve as a suture. The medium-sized workers cut the leaves from the trees, while in the nest the workers of the minim cast are for- ever clipping the threads of the mycelium of the Rhozites, which then develops the ' Kohlrabi,' on which the ants feed." The shape of a mushroom garden is that of a discoidal sponge. On its upper surface the ants pile up the flocculent vegetable debris, threaded in all directions with fungus hypha, in the form of thin, vertical, anastomosing plates, so that as much surface as possible is exposed to the atmosphere of the chamber. This atmosphere must contain a great amount of carbon dioxide and a very small amount of oxygen. The pecu- liar appearance of the surface of two large gardens is shown in the photographs (Figs. I and 2, about '4 the natural size). Although these gardens of At/a fetrves closely resemble those of the South and Central American species observed by Mbller and Forel, I have seen fit to figure them, both because Mbller's work is out of print and may not be readily accessible to the reader, and because, to my knowledge, the gardens of our Texan leaf-cutter have not been figured heretofore. The ants leave several tubular or funnel-shaped openings (clearly shown in the figures), varying in diameter, and extending down into some chambers excavated in the base of the vegetable mass. In these chambers lives the huge queen of the colony, -an insect nearly an inch long, -the newly fledged males and vir- gin queens, together with the larvle, pupa, and attendant ants. 1 Biologia Centrali-A merictzlln II'neilojtt'ra.

The big-headed soldiers -like " Brownie" police officers stalk about slowly over the surface of the comb, descending from time to time into the interior, as if to make sure that the great family is properly attending to its multifarious occupa- tions, while thousands of minims keep moving about through the meshes of the myceliumn, weeding the garden. In the presence of these varied activities and instincts one has a feel- ing of regret that all "anthropomorphism " is now to be ban- ished from the study of ant life, and that we are asked to look at all this elaborate division of labor as nothing but an agglom- eration of machine-like "reflexes."1 It is natural to suppose with \'Vasmaiin 2 that the vast amount of comminuted and decomposing vegetable matter collected by the leaf-cutting ants as a soil, or culture mediumn for the growth of their mushroom diet, would form a most favorable resort for a great number of myrmecophiles. Nevertheless, compara- tively few of these symbiotic animals have been taken up to the present time. Besides the amphisbxenians, which, though often found in the nests of the tropical Attas,3 may not even be myrmecophagous, I find mention of comparatively few species in the literature. These include the following histericd beetles taken in the nests of A/tlafervelzs in Mexico and enumerated in Wasmann's very useful Verzeic/znis 4: Pizi/ister rufulus Lewis, Hister (?) costitaus Mars, Reninus Salvizni Lewis, and Car-cinops (?) imiultistri'cat Lewis.

XXXIV. mentions two species of Aleochara and an Atheta found in the entrances to the nests of Alta sexdcns L. at San Paolo, Brazil. This short list of myrmecophiles led us to sift with consider- able care the gardens of the nest we excavated. The result was a single species of myrmecophile, but this appeared in considerable numbers - more than seventy specimens being taken from three of the large gardens -and proves to be a cockroach (Blattid) of very small size and peculiar structure. With the exception of four males and two females, afl the K, specimens are immature. The WI,!'t~t1S,,, species appears to be undescribed, and as it does not belong to any oenus of which I can find an ac- count, I propose to describe it as *j,,,tl~lflj" the type of a new genus under the name of Attpzsahi/a fuzingicola. 21lllf &gt;lln.'l In the artificial nests above men- tioned the little cockroaches were ',|l frequently seen moving in and out I0Ct&lt; 5 y of the tubular perforations in the vegetable mass. Occasionally one of them would mount a huge soldier that was slowly patrolling FIG. 3.- a filzezirp7 itozwgic n. s p., the surface of the garden, and ride male, dorsal aspect about on its back or enormous head for minutes at a time. The ant did not appear to be in the least annoyed by this performance, nor did any of the other ants pay the slightest attention to the cockroaches when they were encountered in the passages. It is probable that Attaphila, like the ants, feeds on the modified hyph-e of the fungus. This is indicated by the fact that the intestines of several dissected specimens contained a whitish substance which may be the remains of the masticated mycelium. If this supposition proves to be correct, the relationship between the ants and the cockroaches is of a peculiar character. It is, in fact, a kind of myrmecoclepsy, or thieving. As the cockroaches eat the fun- gus cultivated by the ants for their own consumption, this kind of myrmecoclepsy may be said to differ from the typical form</page><page sequence="7">No. 407.] A NEW MYRMECOPZILE. 857 exhibited by the Thysanuran Lepismina and the mite Anten- nophorus. In these cases, as Janet has shown in an excellent paper, the guest steals some of the liquid food while it is pass- ing from the mouth of one ant (Lasizus umnbraizis mizius Nyl.) to that of another. Before passing to a more detailed description of Attaphila, attention may be called to a few of its structural and taxo- nomic peculiarities: i. Up to the present time a genus of diminutive crickets (Myrmecophila) has comprised the only known myrmecophiles i I 11I)1JIl 7T FT I FIG. 4. FIG. 5.

Considering that there is no family of Orthoptera apparently so well fitted to enter into symbiotic relations with ants, it is rather surprising to find that other myrmecophilous Blattickae have not been discovered, espe- cially in the tropics, where the family is rich in species. 1 'tudes sur ics fourmil1is, Zes guIePs, et Zes atbei/cs.

[VOL. XXXIV. 2. While the Orthoptera, as a rule, are large or medium- sized insects, both Myrmecophila and Attaphila are so far below even the average stature of insects of this order that we must conclude either that they have become reduced in size secondarily in adaptation to their present habitat and compan- ionship, or that they were originally diminutive species, and, for that very reason, better able to enter into symbiotic rela- tionship with the ants. The latter alternative seems to be the more probable. 3. The eyes of Attaphila are vestigial in both sexes. This is indicated -by their very small size, the greatly reduced number of their facets, and their irregular orbits (Fig,. 6). There are scarcely more than seventy ommaticlia in either eye, whereas, according- to Miall and Denny,1 there are about eighteen hundred in the eye of the common cockroach (Pcripl/Vantc o-icutalis), and some other species have even larger eyes, and therefore, in all probability, a still greater number of omnmaticlia. The vestigial conci- tion of the eyes in Attaphila is of interest because it shows that the insect has become thoroughly adapted to living in the dark. It is, in fact, a truly cavernicolous form, living F IG. 6.-X A Uaih afun7gi- 17) cola n. sp., eye of adult in caves constructed by its emmet hosts. male. The reduction of the eyes has not, however, proceeded so far as in another diminutive cockroach, iADcticoli Simioii, which is known to inhabit caves in the Philippine Islands. 4. Additional evidence of the lifelong confinement of Atta- phila to the chambers of the ants' nest is seen in the extremely rudimental condition of the tegmina and wings in the adult male, and the complete absence of these structures in the adult female. There can be no doubt that the specimens figured (Figs. 3-5) were mature, as the testes of the male contained ripe spermatozoa, and the ovaries of the female contained large, elliptical white eggs. The obtheca of this form must be an 1 Stwlics in Cemomazrative Anatomy. III. The Structure and Life History of the Cockroach, p. 99.

My specimens were taken too early in the year, as shown by the great number of immature individuals, so that I am unable to make any statements concerning the breeding habits. 5. It is a singular fact that in every one of my specimens of Attaphila the antennae are incomplete, so that I cannot ascertain the full number of joints. There seems to be only one explanation of this, vie., that the antennae have been clipped off by the ants, either by the minims, which are continually trimming the fungus hyphbe, or by the large workers, which cut up the pieces of leaves brought in by the medium-sized workers. It is easy to understand how an insect like a cockroach, living in the midst of thousands of ants which are continually opening and closing their scissor-like mandibles, should be certain sooner or later to have its long antennae cropped. One wonders how the tarsi of the cockroach escape the same treatment. The human habit of cropping the tails of horses and the ears and tails of dogs may be said to be remotely paralleled by the leaf-cutting ants when they inad- vertently clip the antennae of their household insects. The treatment to which the cockroaches are subjected in the nests of Altafeirvens-a treatment which they have probably undergone for ages-suggests an interesting problem for those who may still believe in the inheritance of mutilations. The number of antennal joints that escape the scissors of the ants varies in forty-five specimens, in which they were counted on both sides, from three to eleven. In seventeen of these specimens the number of joints is the same in both antennae, the variations being: 7-7, 8-8, 9-9, and io-io. In twenty-one cases the two antennae differ by only a single joint, the variations being: 7-S, 8-9, 9-IO, Io-iI. In seven specimens the discrepancy between the two antennae is greater, being 3-9, 5-7, 5-9, 7-9. Thus in thirty-eight out of forty- five specimens the cropped antennae are very nearly or quite symmetrical. I am unable to explain this singular condition, which can hardly be a mere coincidence. It is probable that in this symmetrical and cropped form the antennae of the Attaphila are more like those of the ant, and as they are kept</page><page sequence="10">86o THE AMERICAN NA TURALIST. [VOL. XXXIV. in constant vibration, they may on that account more readily simulate the "antennal language" of the host insects. This, however, would be the result, not the cause, of the symmetrical clipping. 6. Judging from the stumps which remain, the antennae of Attaphila differ considerably in structure from those of other Blatticde known to me. The joints are relatively much larger and longer, and therefore of a more generalized or embryonic type than those seen in the nymphs and adults of other species. Can this somewhat hypertrophied condition be the result of the continual clipping to which these organs are subjected? 7. The structure of its antennae suggests that a more extended comparison of Attaphila with other Blattidm may assign it a peculiar, if not unique, taxonomic position. On this matter my limited acquaintance with the insects of this family hardly qualifies me to write. The following is a more detailed description of the myrme- cophile that is the subject of the foregoing general remarks. ATTAPHILA FUNGICOLA, NOV. GEN. ET NOV. SP. Mllalce (Fig. 3). -Length, 3-3.5 mm. Color amber yel- low ; antenna, tibie, tarsi, pleura, tegmima, and overlapping portions of terga and sterna of the thoracic and abdominal segments more brownish. Body about twice as long as broad, glabrous, covered with rather evenly distributed short, yellow- ish hairs. Head scarcely projecting beyond the anterior margin of the pronotum, so that only its posterior edge is visible when the insect is seen from above. Epicranium and front broad, smooth, without any traces of the A-shaped suture and fenes- trw. Labrum not bilobed, but obtusely pointed, extending a little beyond the acute, tridentate mandibles. Labial palpi scarcely half as robust as the maxillary palpi. Eyes very small, with irregular orbits, occupying the extreme lateral portions of the head and separated by a considerable dis- tance from the antennal foveae.

Pronotum evenly rounded in front, considerably broader than the meso- and metanota, and as long as both of these regions taken together. There is a brown spot on either side above the eye. Tegmina rhomboidal, without traces of nervures, covering and extending somewhat beyond the meso- and metathoracic segments, and meeting for a short distance in the mid-dorsal line. Wings very small, vestigial, completely covered by the tegmina and exhibiting only very feeble traces of nervures. Abdominal segments short and broad, the first concealed, considerably narrower than the succeeding, segments ; terga of seventh and eighth without hairs and lighter in color than the preceding segments ; tergum of ninth segment, forming the lamina supra- analis, subtriangular, not more than one and one-half times as broad as long, rounded behind, and fringed with a few hairs. Cerci very short, not longer than broad, ovoidal, one-jointed, covered with radiating hairs except over ,an elongate, glabrous area on the upper surface. Subgenital plate small, rounded and smooth, projecting beyond the supra-anal lamina and turned to the left. Above the subg-enital plate lies a pointecl, spine-like projection (penis ?), which turns to the right side. Stylets apparently absent. Legs short, flattened, the pairs increasing in length from before backwards ; tips of the fore femora far from reaching the pleural edges of the prothorax, those of the hind pair just reaching the lateral edges of the abdomen.
