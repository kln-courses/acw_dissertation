The scope of the Nomads volume is astonishing- the Eur- asian steppes from Eastern Europe through Central Asia and to Mongolia, with a millennial timeframe that encom- passes components of the Late Bronze and the whole of the Early Iron Ages. The anthology's 10 authors, all of whom are recognized specialists on steppe nomad prehistory, syn- thesize Soviet research undertaken between 1960 and 1990. This indispensible, comprehensive synthesis, the initial publication of the Center for the Study of Eurasian No- mads, contains rich, current data and will be a primary resource for many decades to come. A majority of the research on Eurasian steppe archaeology is published over- whelmingly in Russian. Hence, there is a paucity of con- temporary information published in other Western lan- guages; but this treatise on the "Scytho-Siberian world," designed by its editors as a "research tool" (p. vii), contrib- utes significantly to filling this void. The volume focuses upon the Scythian, Sauromatian, Sarmatian, Saka, and early Mongolian nomads who in- habited the Eurasian steppes during the first millennium B.C. A majority of the site and artifact descriptions and interpretations have never been published in English, mak- ing this work essential for any scholar working on Soviet and Central Asian Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages. The anthology will also be valuable to scholars of the Asian subcontinent, Southwest Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Sinitic Far East for its detail and the regional linkages it establishes. This compendium has an elucidating foreword and ed- itorial introduction, followed by five chronological or re- gional groupings containing 20 chapters (varying from four to 41 pages). It concludes with two bibliographies, a useful 21-page three-column index of proper nouns and topics, and a three-page index of contemporary authors. The de- tailed text is supplemented by line drawings of site plans, artifacts, and assemblages. Some of the figures lack scale measurements so that key illustrations of interments and ceramic vessels are compromised. One bibliography has 408 Russian entries with full English translations; the sec- ond contains 26 non-Russian references. The editors claim 900 bibliographic citations (p. vii). Relevant references to Herodotus, Strabo, and Tacitus are incorporated. The chapters, in the main, define a region, chronology, and geographic-ecological characteristics. Despite local varia- tions in burial rituals and contact with classical civiliza- tions, kurgans (semispherical earthen burial mounds) and the Scytho-Sarmatian triad (specialized weaponry, horse harness, and "animal style" depictions) are ubiquitous steppe culture characteristics. Part I has three regional chapters on the Scythians (late eighth to third century B.C.): North Caucasus, Southeast- ern Europe, and Crimea. The authors elaborate burial types, grave goods, ethnogeography, metallurgy, kurgan construction, anthropomorphic lithic stelae, Greek and local ceramics, fortified settlements, and subsistence econ- omy. These essays replace Melyukova's "The Scythians and Sarmatians" in D. Sinor ed., The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia (Cambridge 1990), and update R. Rolle's Die Welt der Skythen (Munich 1980), translated as The World of the Scythians (Berkeley 1989). Part II contains nine chapters detailing Sauromatrian and Sarmatian tribes (sixth century B.C. to fourth century A.D.): a historical overview; analysis of past research; es- says on the Transitional Period and on Sauromatian cul- ture; treatises on early, middle, and late Sarmatian culture; and a review of Sarmatian presence in the North Cauca- sus. The authors suggest that climatic changes resulting in a deteriorating steppe ecology necessitated a nomadic lifeway. Moshkova (pp. 186-88) speculates about tribal unions, class formation, and primitive state development. Part III includes three chapters on the Central Asian Saka: written sources and history, material culture, and ethnogenetic hypotheses. Yablonsky concludes that Saka</page><page sequence="2">408 BOOK REVIEWS [AJA 101 peoples (Iranian-speaking nomadic cattle-breeders) were actively involved in the political and military expansion of the Achaemenid empire, the fall of the Graeco-Bactrian kingdom, and the formations of Parthia and later the Ku- shan empire (pp. 193-95). Regional delineations of kur- gan cemeteries, grave goods, and pottery are made for nine geographic regions. Part IV has four contributions on the Siberian Scyth- ians: a history of past research and problems, the Tuva and Altai Mountain regions, and Tagai culture. Petroglyphs, lithic stelae, and Pazyryk and Arzhan kurgans are reported. Five social groups are inferred based upon burial wealth. This presentation supercedes V.N. Chernetsov and W. Moszy6nska's Prehistory of Western Siberia (Montreal 1974). Part V consists of one chapter on early nomads in Mon- golia and information on the Late Neolithic, Afanasievo, Slab Grave, and Karasuk cultures. Volkov concludes can- didly that "during the period of the great migrations, the nomadic movement literally recarved the ethnic and po- litical map of Asia and areas further to the West" (p. 332). In a work of this magnitude and complexity some typo- graphical and minor errors of commission occur: a radio- carbon date (p. 22) should be attributed to the University of Arizona rather than Tucson; "Amu Darya River" is re- dundant (Darya = "river"); and Mongolia encompasses more than 1.5 km2 (p. 319). The editors recognize (pp. vi- vii) that the authors use inconsistent regional geographic terminology (Central Asia, Middle Asia, Inner Asia), but made no modifications. This compendium complements ET. Hiebert's Origins of Bronze Age Civilization in Central Asia (Cambridge, Mass. 1994) (reported by this reviewer in AJA 100 [1996] 182-83). It enhances three outdated volumes in the Ancient Peoples and Places series: T. T. Rice's The Scythians3 (New York 1961), T. Sulimirski's The Sarmatians (New York 1970), and V.M. Masson and V.I. Sarianidi's Central Asia: Turkmenia before the Achaemenids (New York 1972). Likewise, it supplements UNESCO's History of Civilizations of Central Asia I. The Dawn of Civilization: Earliest Times to 700 B.C., edited by A.H. Dani and V.M. Masson (Paris 1992), and History of Civilizations of Central Asia II. The Development of Sedentary and Nomadic Civilizations: 700 B.C. to A.D. 250, edited byJ. Harmatta, B.N. Puri, and G.F Etemandi (Paris 1994). The other work under review here, a specialized study authored by Telegin (Institute of Archaeology, Ukranian Academy of Science) and Mallory (Queen's University, Bel- fast), will interest scholars of Eastern European archaeol- ogy, historians of religion, and Indo-European specialists. Their work is based upon a revision of Telegin's popular 1991 tome, Vartovi Tysycholit (Sentries of the Millennia). Sum- marized are the archaeological evidence and Indo- European religious iconographic interpretations of early monumental lithic sculptures created by several groups who occupied the Pontic-Caspian region, particularly the area between the Danube and Don rivers, during the 5,000-year period from the "Copper Age" to the early Mid- dle Ages. Over 300 surviving stelae are known and 129 of these are described in an annotated catalogue. The treatise begins with fourth-millennium B.C. Copper Age Kemi-Oba and intrusive Yamna cultures; documents simple life-size anthropomorphic stelae, statue-menhirs, and ritual enclosures; considers some of the published icon- ographic interpretations (anatomy, dress, figure types); and evaluates cultural diffusion from Western Europe. The au- thors also consider Cimmerian, Scythian, and Sarmatian lithic statuary; early Slavic idols, sanctuaries, and offerings; and 11th-century A.D. "Baba" statues created by Turkic- speaking Polovtsians. The authors conclude that stelae functions were not constant through time and that some cultural identifications remain speculative. A minor cor- rection - Bogyt Mountain sanctuary (p. 82) dates from the third century A.D. rather than B.C. This essay supplements only a minor portion of the Nomads volume. CHARLES C.
