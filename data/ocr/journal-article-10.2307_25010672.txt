<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEPHEN G. MILLER The Altar of the Six Goddesses in Thessalian Pherai The purpose of this study is to present two recently dis covered ancient blocks from Pherai in Thessaly.1 Because these two blocks are only part of a much larger monument, and because they have several self-contained anomalies, this presentation must consider the questions of reconstruction and interpretation. Although speculative and incapable of proof, the reconstruction and interpretation of the monument offered here will, I hope, be taken as serious and possible explanations of the peculiarities presented by the blocks and the area where they were discovered.

PROVENIENCE The Acropolis of Pherai2 is a steep-sloped hill situated at the southwestern outskirts of the modern village of Velestino in Thes saly. Although overshadowed by Mt. Chalkodonion to the south,3 the Acropolis is prominent and easily distinguished by its broad table top configuration. To the north the land at the foot of the Acropolis steps down gradually in a series of broad terraces toward the so-called 2 Cf. F.

On the latter side the slopes end in a dry streambed, the 'Makalorevma', which seems to have formed the line of the city walls in this area.6 About halfway up this western slope there is a fairly narrow naturally formed ramp sloping upward toward the saddle which connects the Acropolis with Hill 154 to the south. It was during the bulldozing of this "ramp" in order to create a broader, flatter, and hence more arable area, that Block A was found. When first moved to the museum at Volos, Block A was missing its upper rear left corner. The missing fragment was found in the area of the bulldozed ramp of the Acropolis by the author in August of 1972. At the same time, Block B was found just below the ramp and can be discerned in Plate 3:1 as the white dot to the left of center.7 The discovery of two blocks of the same monument in the same area raises the question of whether the blocks had been in situ before being unearthed by the bulldozer. Another possibility is that the monument once rested on the top of the Acropolis near its western edge and that the blocks fell down onto the ramp and came to rest close to one an other. In either case, since the foundations of the altar are presumably still in place, excavations at the site could determine the original pro venience of the altar. III. DATE Since the blocks were not found in situ, the only evidence for dating is that contained on the blocks themselves. The hook clamps on the top surfaces are most characteristic of the Hellenistic period, and ought not to be earlier than the fourth century B.C.8 The Z clamp (our 4 Y.

The connecting saddle is the site of the Church of the Panaghia, a modern reconstruction of which is presently cutting through a previously well preserved section of the ancient city walls. 6 Bequignon, op. cit. 15. 7 Both Block B and the joining fragment of Block A were taken to the mu seum in Volos in August of 1972. For provision of the funds necessary for workmen and transportation of the block, as well as personal maintenance in Thessaly I would thank the American Council of Learned Societies. 8 R. Martin, Manuel d'architecture Greque I (Paris 1965) 273-279.</page><page sequence="10">236 Stephen G. Miller version is actually a double F) ought to be earlier than the hook clamps and is usually found in late Archaic or early Classical contexts. There are, however, examples known from the fourth century, the most significant of which is in the Daochos dedication at Delphi.9 The letter forms of the inscriptions may give a somewhat closer date. Although there are differences among the three lines (e.g. the sigmas of the last line are more elongated than those of the first), the similarities are more pronounced and argue that the dates of the three lines are relatively close. The slightly splayed tips of the letters of all three lines should place them well into the fourth century, and there is no primafacie reason for dating the letters of the last line later than the early third century B.C.10 On the other hand, there might appear to be a problem with the orthography of the inscribed names which consistently uses eta rather than the typical Aeolic-Thessalian alpha. This use of r for a must be an example of the intrusion of the Attic-Ionic koine which became very widespread in Thessaly, but not until the late second or early first century B.C.11 For example, the letters of Philip V to the Thessalian League from the late third century B.C.12 were originally written in Attic but had to be presented in Larissa together with a Thessalian translation. This general tendency need not preclude, however, the earlier use of the koine in Thessaly. Indeed, the closest parallels for the letter forms of our monument appear in an unpublished inscription from Pherai written in koine and probably dating to the middle of the fourth century B.C.13 It is always tempting to associate monuments with known historical events. If the real date of the altar is in the middle of the fourth century, and the tenuous nature of the chronological evidence must be emphasized, then the damage and repairs to the monument (see below) 9 Ibid. 256. 10 For the closest parallel to the letter forms of the present monument see infra n. 13. 11 Cf. C. D. Buck. The Greek Dialects (Chicago 1955) 151, and Thumb Scherer, Handbuch der griechische-Dialekte 112 (Heidelberg 1959) 55. 12 IG IX2, 517; for the proper date see Habicht. " Epigraphische Zeugnisse zur Geschichte Thessaliens," Ancient Macedonia (Thessalonike 1970) 273-278. 13 Volos Museum no. n 98. I would thank Ch. Habicht for calling my attention to the existence of this stone, for allowing me to use his squeeze of it for comparative purposes, and for discussing its date with me. Mr. Habicht argues convincingly that the text which is a proxeny decree of the Pheraians must, on historical grounds, date to the period before the Macedonian domination of Thessaly.</page><page sequence="11">Altar of the Six Goddesses 237 may have been a result of the capture of Pherai in 344 B.C. by Philip of Macedon.14 Another possible time for this damage is the siege of Cassander's garrison at Pherai by Demetrios Poliorketes in 302 B.C.,15 but neither suggestion can be proven. It is perhaps better simply to date the monument to the late Classical or early Hellenistic period.16 IV. RECONSTRUCTION As previously mentioned, Blocks A and B are two members of a larger monument. These two blocks belong together back to back as is shown by the similarity of heights and lengths, by the alignment of the clamp cuttings, and by the correspondence of the Z and hook clamps of the one block vis-a-vis those of the other. This joint establishes the depth of the monument as 0.635 m., and provides the additional infor mation that the back and one end (probably both ends) of the monu ment were plain, while the front was covered with a series of low relief stelai each of which bore the name of a female divinity. Although we lack the left end of the monument, its original length can be esti mated. This is so because the successive lines of the inscription, the first reading left to right, the second right to left, both begin and end with Hestia and Themis which means that six stelai originally comprised a complete unit. It will be shown below that the six goddesses listed on these stelai comprised the Pheraian version of the female members of the Twelve Olympian Gods. Thus, there are two possible reconstruc tions of the original monument: 1. There were six, and only six, deities worshipped which means that we have to restore only the remaining half stele and a mar gin to the left balancing that to the right. This would be done by means 14 Dem. 8.59; cf. Dem. 7.32; 9.12; 19.260. Bequignon, op. cit. 19, argues that Pherai suffered no damage during the take-over by Philip, but the long history of antipathy between Pherai and Philip would not lead one to believe that Philip was particularly tender with the city; cf. H. D. Westlake, Thessaly in the Fourth Century B.C. (London 1935) 192. B&amp;quignon further attempts to assign traces of burning which he noted on the Acropolis (p. 15) and at the so-called Temple of Zeus Thaulios (p. 30) to the later siege of the Acropolis by Demetrios (infra). Bequignon does not adduce any archaeological evidence for his dating of the fires, and the two fires need not have been from the same cause, nor even at the same time. 15 Diod. Sic. 20.110.6. 16 However, the best time for the establishment of a monument such as ours would seem to be during the Pheraian tyranny, either under Alexander (369-358 B.c.) or under the sons of Jason, the last of whom, Peitholaos, was ejected from Pherai by Philip for the third and last time in 344 B.c. Although perhaps of no significance, it is interesting to remember that the Altar of the Twelve Gods in Athens was also established by a tyranny; cf. Thuc. 6.54.6-7.</page><page sequence="12">238 Stephen G. Miller of a thin slab, 0.12 meters thick, with the remaining half stele carved on one thin end, and having the full depth of the monument of 0.635 m. (fig. 3). The total monument length will have been ca. 1.113 m. The type of construction thus restored, with two relatively thick blocks set back to back and a thin slab masking their ends on one side, is unusual and may not be original. This possibility is supported by a consideration 3. Possible reconstruction of central course of monument. of the difference in the forms of the clamps used on the top surface of the two blocks. We might think of the monument as originally consisting of the two blocks A and gth will have bere 1.113 m. long and bound to gether by a Z clamp at each end. The left end of the monument was subsequently damaged, Blocks A and B smoothed off on this end, and the end covered by the block restored as measuring 0.12 x 0.635 x 0.685 m. The original Z clamp at the left (corresponding to that still preserved at the right) will have been cut away during the repairs and replaced by a new hook clamp further to the right. The new slab will have been bound to the ends of both Blocks A and B by a hook clamp to each block.17 17 If the monument is, as will be argued below, a part of a Dodekatheon, then this reconstruction means that there will have been two separate altars with six deities on each. It will be seen below that the gods were in four groups of three in the Delian Dode katheon, and there was a widespread tendency to split the twelve into four groups of three, six groups of two, or two groups of six in both literature and art; cf. O. Weinreich, Roscher s.v. Zwolfg6tter 842.</page><page sequence="13">Altar of the Six Goddesses 239 2. The second possibility is that the altar was dedicated to all Twelve Gods with the six male deities to the left, the six female to the right. In this case the altar will have had an original length of ca. 2.16 m. Such a possibility, however, would cause an original vertical joint to fall through one stele,18 would fail to provide an explanation for the difference in the forms of the clamps, and would take no account of the fact that the three successive series of inscribed names form a complete unit as they stand.19 The first suggested reconstruction seems more probable. The anathyrosis on the bottoms of the blocks shows that they rested on another stone surface with which a close fitting joint was formed. Since the monument is finished on the preserved three sides, we can best imagine the lower element as a stepped krepidoma with a free standing monument on top. Another element obviously belonged above Blocks A and B as is shown not only by the anathyrosis, but also by the otherwise ex posed clamp cuttings on their upper surfaces. The nature of this missing element cannot be restored with certainty and there are several possi bilities-as, for example, a simple moulded flat slab, or a slab with barriers (plain or decorated) at each end.20 Another possibility is sug gested by a consideration of the inscriptions on the front of the monu ment. In the original line the goddesses were named in the series: Hestia, Demeter, Enodia, Aphrodite, Athena, Themis. In the second line, the series is retrograde, but almost the same: Hestia, Demeter, Enodia, Athena, Aphrodite, Themis.21 Finally, each name in line 2 was turned around in line 3 so that the series reads from left to right, but is now reversed: Themis, Aphrodite, Athena, Enodia, Demeter, Hestia. What is the significance of these changes ? It would appear that the solution to this question is to be 18 With the first possibility discussed above, this vertical joint will have been the result of later repairs, not a part of the original construction. 19 A variation on this reconstruction would be to restore a plain central section and another group of six stelai further to the left, thus making one long monument. Such a reconstruction would require, however, the restoration of so many missing pieces that I refrain from suggesting it. 20 Cf. C. G. Yavis, Greek Altars (St. Louis 1949) passim, for the various possibilities. 21 The only difference in the two series is the inversion of the sequence Aphrodite-Athena to Athena-Aphrodite. There may be a significance in this inversion which has eluded me. It seems better to regard this change as an error on the part of the inscriber of line 2.</page><page sequence="14">240 Stephen G. Miller sought in one of two areas. The first would be in the field of religious superstition or magic. If the explanation does lie here, it is not known to me. It cannot, however, be discounted as a possible explanation since Thessalian women in general,22 and the priestess of Pheraian Enodia in particular,23 were well known in antiquity for their magical powers. In this same religious context one other peculiarity of the altar should be noted. The first named goddess in line 1 was Hestia and the last named goddess in line 3 was also Hestia. It may be purely coincidental, but we should recall the proverb o' 'Earias aPXeaocat or E' 'EaEras apXEra Oat.24 As explained by the story of the birth of the children of Kronos and Rhea (their successive consumption by Kronos, and the stone substituted for Zeus which caused Kronos to regurgitate his children in reverse order), Hestia was both the first and the last of the children of Kronos and Rhea,25 and was worshipped first and last in sacrifices.26 Since, however, the first line of names on our altar was probably erased by the time the last line was inscribed, any connection between the proverb and the changes in the inscribed names on the altar would seem to be fortuitous. A second possible answer to the question of the meaning of the name changes is more prosaic and concerns the possible form of the upper member of the monument. If one considers the names to have been not merely a list of the divinities worshipped at this altar, but as having a more specific function as labels, it is possible to imagine that the upper member of the altar contained images of the goddesses and that the inscriptions were intended to help the viewer distinguish among the images. Such a type of monument is not well-known and yet there is a certain body of evidence which suggests that an altar with a series of statues or statuettes of gods on top was fairly common in antiquity. The evidence has to do with various processions which included images of deities, and specifically with images of the Twelve Gods who were worshipped as a group. A few of the pertinent sources are: 22 See, for example, Aristophanes, Nubes 749-752; Ov. Met. 7.74-99, et al.; Apul. 2.1; Lucian, The Ass, passim. 23 Polyainos 8.43. 24 PI.

Philip is said to have paraded the images (E'3Zs)a) of the Twelve Gods and to have added a thirteenth figure of himself which was included in the proces sion.27 2. At Rome there was an annual procession from the Capitoline through the Forum to the Circus Maximus which was said to have been based on similar Greek processions and which included images (EdKo'VE) of the Twelve Gods carried on men's shoulders.28 3. At Magnesia on the Maeander the stephanephoros of the city was each year to carry the images of the Twelve Gods (odava 7Tdvrovv 'rv 83csE&amp;Ka E 6v) in a procession.29 Our concern here is not with the processions but rather with the place of residence of the images of the Twelve Gods during the rest of the year and with the fact that they could be removed and carried about. Although the sources cited above do not indicate where the images were housed, it is logical to assume that they were kept all together in one place inasmuch as they were worshipped as a group and paraded as a group. Such must have been the case at Delos, for example, where the attested twelve statues30 were almost certainly housed in the Dodekatheon.31 This shrine has been identified32 and the placement of the twelve statues was probably on a series of bases in front of the temple in the temenos.33 An orthostate of one of these bases survives34 and the face of this orthostate is inscribed with the three names [AG10] vs AJto "Hpas. The Delian monument will have looked, then, some thing like the monument in a wall painting from Herculaneum.35 The purpose of the preceding discussion has been to show (1) that there were in antiquity sanctuaries of the Twelve Gods which contained statues or statuettes of these deities; (2) that at least in some 27 Diod.

Miller cases these figures could be detached and carried in processions; and (3) that all twelve figures did not have to be set into a single base. The last point shows the possibility that the monument from Pherai was one of two bases in a dodekatheon with the six male deities on one base and the six female deities on another.36 The first point permits the suggested reconstruction of the upper member of the monument as consisting of statuettes of the goddesses, and the second point would permit those figures to have been removable. But if the images on the Thessalian altar were full-figure statuettes, the use of labels would not have been absolutely necessary.37 There is, in our Thessalian context, another possibility. In the museum of Larissa there is a curious object the purpose of which has never been explained (pl. 3:2).38 Found at Dilophos (Chalitsi) south of Larissa and about 20 miles northwest of Pherai, this object consists of a large poros slab (about 0.20 x 0.50 x 1.00 m.) with three circular holes cut through it. Into these holes are set the marble heads of three females with very similar features. The heads are held in place by a collar of lead around their long shaft-like necks. If we restore some such upper member on our altar, an explana tion for the reversal of the inscriptions on the face of the monument becomes possible. A conjectural history of the monument might have been something like this: 1. The altar is constructed as a free-standing monument on top of a stepped krepidoma with an upper member consisting of a single slab pierced by six holes into which were set the heads of the six 36 Cf. supra n. 17. 37 In the same area where the blocks of our monument came to light there was discovered the fragmentary torso of a marble statue of Athena. Although under life-size, this statue is still too large to allow its association with the monument. The publication of the torso by G. Bakalakes is forthcoming in Thessalika. 38 Larissa Museum no. 948; cf. ZeAT7ov 16 (1960) 183-184. The piece was discovered by Mrs. M. Theochare whom I would thank for permission to cite it here, but has not yet been fully published. Although this Thessalian three-headed slab might seem extraordinary, one might remember the female terracotta heads of the second half of the fifth century B.C. discovered at Brauron. These heads, like those of the Dilophos slab, have elongated necks which obviously served to hold them in place; cf. BCH 87 (1963) 707, and ERGON 1962, 30 32. An effect quite similar to that of the Dilophos slab is achieved by a series of miniature bronze heads recently discovered in Etruria which were set in stone bases. In this case, how ever, a smaller tenon projects down from the base of the neck to serve the same function as the elongated necks of the Dilophos and Brauron heads; cf. M. A. Del Chiaro and A. Taloc chini, AJA 77 (1973) pl. 60.5.</page><page sequence="17">Altar of the Six Goddesses 243 goddesses. The front of the monument is carved with six low relief stelai, one below each goddess, and inscribed with the name of the deity portrayed above. 2. The altar is damaged and in the subsequent repairs the left end is trimmed and replaced by a thin vertical slab onto which is carved the left half of the first relief stele (see above and fig. 3). The upper slab is set back on top of the repaired monument, but turned around 180? (by mistake?) so that the backs of the heads of the god desses are toward the front, and the stelai are reinscribed in retrograde following the original sequence. Thus Hestia, originally the first on the left facing the front of the monument, is now the last on the right facing the back of the monument. 3. The "mistake" is corrected by turning each head around individually (after an annual procession of the Twelve Gods?) so that it faces the front of the altar, and the stelai receive their final reinscription in the form of turning the individual names around so that they read from left to right, but in the reverse of the original sequence. Both the head and the name of Hestia, for example, originally first on the left facing front, then last on the right facing back, is finally last on the right facing front (fig. 4). Although the suggested reconstruction of the altar and its history is highly conjectural and cannot be proven, it would explain the peculiarities on the front of the monument. But if the reconstruction is correct, the form of the monument is unique. A possible parallel might be a rockcut relief of the Roman period in France,39 but the difference in time and place is too great to allow even a hypothetical connection. Similar to the suggested reconstruction of our monument in spirit, but not exactly equivalent in form, are three monuments found in the Bay of Naples and dedicated to the Syrian god Dusares.40 All three are shaped like normal altars. Two have rectangular cuttings for three objects on top, while the third larger monument has cuttings for seven 39 A. Blanc.

It is equally possible that in the relief cited we have to do not with three heads set upon an altar, but rather with a compression of the space dividing two zones so that the relief should be considered in two zones with three busts in the upper and an altar in the lower, a much more common composition for this type of monu ment.

Possible reconstruction of the altar of the six goddesses.</page><page sequence="19">Altar of the Six Goddesses 245 objects. These objects were small simple stelai with rounded tops, as is shown by the discovery of four of them near the larger altar. The lower part of each stele is provided with a tenon which fits neatly into the socket on top of the altar. If none of these monuments provides a precise parallel for the suggested reconstruction of the Pheraian monument, they at least show that curious monuments do exist elsewhere in the ancient world, and that the reconstruction suggested above ought to be considered as a possibility, however remote.41 It should be remembered, moreover, that the suggested reconstruction may be rejected but the suggested history retained by reconstructing full-figure statuettes on the upper element. V. THE FORM OF THE ALTAR Even without the hypothetical reconstruction of the upper element, there are peculiarities which can be best explained in a local Pheraian context. For example, the idea of individual stelai carved in relief on a larger monument is not easily paralleled, and yet there is a fragment of another monument from Pherai which must have been similar to our monument in this respect. This is a fragment of marble from the upper left corner of a monument upon whose face was carved a stele in relief (pl. 4: 1).42 The inscription on the face of the stele is a dedication to Zeus Thaulios.43 Unfortunately, we cannot know if there were more than one stele on the face of the monument, and the form of the stele is much more developed (e.g., pediment, acroteria, etc.) than that of the stelai on the Pheraian altar. 41 Although I have sought to explain the curious nature of the inscription on the face of the monument in terms of the upper element, other explanations are possible. One which has been suggested is that lines 1 and 2 are contemporary on Block A and represent a later copy of an earlier inscription as indicated by the use of retrograde in line 2. These lines are then replaced by the new "edition" of line 3 which does away with the use of "old fashioned" retrograde in line 2. The reproduction of lines 1 and 2 on the monument is to be attributed to a religious conservatism which is, however, then disregarded by the erasure of those lines and the inscription of line 3. 42 Now in the Halmyros Museum, no. 27; cf.

Aniconism was, of course, well known throughout Greece in the historical period, and there are many ancient references to aniconic images. Zeus,48 Hera,49 Aphrodite,50 Artemis,51 and Apollo52 were all worshipped in aniconic form together with other deities and heroes in various parts of the ancient world. These aniconic monu ments are sometimes portrayed in other art forms as, for example, on an Apulian red-figured bell crater in the Cleveland Museum, where a plain stele bears the inscription APPOAITH and must be an aniconic image of the goddess.53 Even more pertinent to the present discussion are the regions where a flourishing aniconism is attested as, for example, at Pharai in Achaea where some 30 squared stones in the agora were worshipped with the name of a god given to each.54 More notable yet is Tegea in Arcadia where Pausanias noted a square image of Zeus and continued with his own editorial comment: "It seems to me that the Arcadians particularly like this form."55 This statement has been well documented by the discovery of nearly 30 such "statues" in Arcadia, mostly from Tegea.56 These rETpdycywa ayaC (ya-ra fall into two categories.

Miller and a toros.57 The variations between these "pyramidal pillars" are small, and it is clear that a formalized aniconism was active in Arcadia in general and in Tegea in particular. One of these monuments is of especial interest in that it consists of three such pillars carved from a single block and inscribed NviuL v.58 Like our Thessalian altar, the Arcadian dedication is a multiple aniconic monument. The "pyramidal pillars" of Tegea and the simple pointed stelai of Pherai are local, but well-defined and formalized, variations of a strong aniconic influence. Although this interpretation accounts for the stelai on the face of the Thessalian altar, it does not take into consideration the (hypothetical) upper member with its female heads. If the reconstruc tion is valid, then the monument as a whole is not purely aniconic. Rather, it would represent a stage halfway between aniconism and ico nism. Such an intermediate stage is well attested elsewhere, particularly with reference to Dionysos. One can, in fact, trace the development of portrayals of Dionysos from a simple aniconic monument59 to a com plete anthropomorphization. Particularly instructive for the inter mediate stage in this evolutionary process are the many instances in vase painting where a pillar, or a column, or even a tree trunk, has a mask of Dionysos affixed to it and wrapped in clothing below.60 The aniconic image is transformed into a quasi-anthropomorphic statue by the addition of a human head. That this practice survived well into the classical period, and probably even later, is shown not only by the portrayal of the custom on red-figured vases, but also by the survival of the masks themselves both in terracotta and in marble.61 It was probably from some such rather temporary com bination that the more formal Herm was developed.62 This is not to 57 IG V2 59-66 (Tegea) and 280, 290 (Mantinea), and eight uninscribed shafts mentioned by Rhomaios, op. cit. 149. 58 IGV2 65. 59 Clem.

Miss Goldman's additional contention, that the Herm was originally and specifically Diony siac is not necessary to our argument; cf. Nilsson, op. cit. 207, n. 4. Miss Goldman herself admits (p. 63) that the mask was not unique to Dionysos, and what is important for us is the existence of the aniconic-iconic intermediate stage which is best documented with regard to Dionysos and Hermes. The use of the quasi-anthropomorphic herm was almost certainly once more universal for, as Miss Goldman points out (p. 61): "the custom of weaving gar</page><page sequence="23">Altar of the Six Goddesses 249 deny the generally accepted derivation of the herm from the wayside piles of stones, or ppa, which served as sign posts,63 but it is to posit an intermediate stage of anthropomorphic evolution. The manifestation of this stage is the attachment of a human head to an aniconic body. Although inconclusive, it is tantalizing to note that the earliest attested Herm was attributed to Hipparchos son of Peisistratos.64 One of these Herms is known, and it shows traces of anathyrosis on its top surface which indicates that the head was attached to the shaft as a separate piece.65 In other words, the Hipparchan Herm may retain the physical manifestations of the first attachment of iconic head to aniconic body. The straight shaft with phallus, stubby shoulder pieces, and bearded human head is best known to us as a representation of Hermes, but there is evidence that this form was once used for many other divinities (cf. notes 48-53). That this form did not remain in use for most deities was due to the impulses toward full anthropomor phization; but in an area, such as Arcadia, where aniconism was particularly strong, this impulse would be resisted. We have already seen that aniconism remained strong in Arcadia, but iconism also inter vened. One possible result of a conflict between the traditional aniconic form and the new iconic form might well be a compromise which took the form which we know as a Herm. In fact, Tegea once again provides evidence that such a compromise could and did take place given the proper conditions of a strong aniconic tradition in a fairly isolated area. That aniconic tradition is represented by the "pyramidal pillars" mentioned above, but Tegea also has a series of human-headed shafts, or Herms, which would not be particularly surprising were it not for the fact that these are all "statues " of gods other than Hermes. Aphro dite,66 Artemis,67 and Agathos Theos68 are all represented by individual herms. Even more interesting is the fragmentary multiple herm now broken at the top, bottom, and right side, but clearly once topped by human heads.69 In its present state we have only three shafts although ments for statues could only have arisen at a time when the full anthropomorphic statue had not yet evolved." 63 See E.

Each shaft is inscribed with a name identifying the image: Zeus, Poseidon, and Demeter. Another multiple herm of six contiguous shafts is sadly defaced and its inscrip tion badly scarred, but it was obviously a monument of this same type.70 If one now looks again at the suggested restoration of the Pheraian altar (fig. 4), it will be seen, I believe, that its spirit and moti vation-its content in an art historical sense-is precisely the same as the Arcadian monuments, even if its form is not precisely the same. Certainly there can be little doubt that Thessaly, like Arcadia, had a strong aniconic tradition, and if this tradition, confronted by the im pulses of anthropomorphization, could produce monuments such as have been seen from Arcadia, then it is possible that Thessaly could have produced, under a similar iconic impulse, a monument such as that which has been restored. One would then have to do with an inter mediate stage in the evolution of anthropomorhization where human heads are set on top of the traditional forms of aniconic images. VI. THE Six GODDESSES We now turn to the deities represented on the altar. As mentioned before, I believe that these six goddesses represent the distaff side of the Twelve Gods in Thessaly, or at least in Pherai. Four of the goddesses are definitely part of the canonical Twelve and require no special pleading for their places here. Hestia, Demeter, Athena, and Aphrodite are all attested in Thessaly and are all charter members of the Twelve Olympians. Normally, one should expect Artemis and Hera as the remaining two goddesses, but nothing is normal about this monument, and Enodia and Themis require explanation. At this point, it should be noted that the Twelve canonical members were not immutable. Although the great bulk of evidence confirms the membership as belonging principally to Zeus, Apollo, Ares, Hermes, Hephaistos, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter, Athena, Aphro dite, Artemis, and Hestia, some of these gods and goddesses were oc casionally replaced by other deities. Dionysos frequently usurps the seat of Hestia, and local deities were sometimes enrolled as replacements 70 IG V2 72. For other such multiple heads upon plain bases see AA 1941, 652 and fig. 130 (Locri), and E. Esperandieu, Recueil general des Bas-Reliefs, Statues et Bustes de la Gaule Romaine IV (Paris 1911) 3426, where five joined female heads from the Museum of Chatillon are shown. Although broken below, these heads may well have belonged on a base like that shown ibid. no. 3411.1.</page><page sequence="25">Altar of the Six Goddesses 251 for less popular divinities. Such appears to have been the case, for example, with the original Twelve Gods worshipped at the shrine in the Athenian Agora,71 and at Olympia the deified Alpheios river was listed among the local version of the Twelve.72 The case for Enodia as a member of the Twelve Gods at Pherai is simple and straightforward. She replaces Artemis.73 Enodia, although well-known throughout Thessaly,74 was particularly venerated by the people of Pherai. She appears on their coins,75 and is frequently called simply Pheraia, or the Pheraian goddess, in literary sources. She is a combination of Artemis and Hekate, with a dash of Alkestis thrown in.76 Daughter of Zeus, Enodia's maternal grandfather was Aiolos, a satisfactory genealogy in Aiolic Thessaly, and her general importance in the area may well have been connected to the prevalence of witchcraft.77 Her iconography is well established, not only by the coins of Pherai, but also by fragmentary dedicatory reliefs from Mace donia, a composite of which shows Enodia seated side-saddle on horse back and bearing a single torch.78 In other representations, as on the coins cited above, she carries a torch in each hand. In addition to Macedonia, Enodia is attested epigraphi cally outside Thessaly at Epidauros,79 Oreos in Euboea,80 and as far away as Issa in Dalmatia.81 Pausanias, who calls her Artemis Pheraia, 71 H.

Miller tells us of her cult in Athens, Sicyon, and Argos.82 Both the Argives and the Sicyonians claimed that their xoana of the goddess had been brought from Pherai. It might be noted in passing that these xoana were of wood and, on the basis of what has been seen of aniconism in Thessaly, it may be conjectured that they were less than fully anthropomorphized. Be that as it may, Enodia was clearly a goddess in her own right, existing in many places side by side with Artemis, but frequently conflated and identified with her as, for example, on a small altar or bomiskos from Demetrias (pl. 4:4).83 We do not know why Enodia was so especially revered at Pherai, but her name provides a clue. Pherai is situated at a cross-roads and controls the passage to Pagasai-Demetrias, the only viable harbor available to the otherwise land-locked Thessalians. Control of this access route was crucial to Pherai,84 and Enodia, the goddess of the road, would have been a natural benefactor to the Pheraians. If one further considers the previously mentioned importance of Enodia to Thessalian magic, it is not difficult to understand why she would replace Artemis among the Twelve Gods at Pherai. The appearance of Themis on the altar is more difficult to explain, and the argument here must also consider Hera, the goddess whose place Themis takes. If the monument is, as suggested, the female part of a sanctuary of the Twelve Gods, then Hera must be missing. At first this may seem incredible, but with closer examination of the Thes salian context it is not so unlikely, for there is evidence that Hera was not welcome in Thessaly. For example, in the hundreds of dedications known from Thessaly, Hera is mentioned only twice. Her first appear ance is in an inscription of the first century after Christ which mentions the priestess of Livia Hera Sebaste.85 This is obviously a reference to a cult of the deified Livia where she is equated with Juno, which is trans lated into Greek as Hera as a matter of course. The other epigraphical mention of Hera in Thessaly86 couples her with Zeus in the canonical fashion, but also belongs to the Roman period. Furthermore, Hera is not represented on any Thessalian coins, nor is there any literary evi dence for a cult of Hera in Thessaly.87 82 Paus. 2.10.7 and 2.23.5. 83 SEG III 485; Halmyros Museum no. 210. 84 Cf.

Themis is attested epigraphically four times in the period ranging from the sixth to the third centuries B.C.88 Moreover, one of the Thes salian months, Themistios,89 was named for her, a fact which obviously gives her a high rank on the religious calendar. In this context it may be noted that Demetrias, the early Hellenistic settlement of Demetrios Poliorketes on the bay of Volos, named its twelve months after the Twelve Gods, apparently along Platonic guidelines.90 Of the twelve month names at Demetrias, ten have been recovered and they represent ten of the canonical Twelve Gods.91 It may be fortuitous, but one of the two missing Olympians is Hera. Future epigraphic discoveries may, of course, reveal Hera among these month names, but if the local tradi tion in Thessaly was adequately strong, Themis may rather be found as one of the twelve-month deities at Demetrias. One other body of evidence lies in the personal names of Thessalians. There are attested some 14 examples of names which are derived from Themis, such as Pasithemis, Themistion, Themison, Themistokles, and, especially popular, Themistogenes.92 Most of these are Hellenistic, the latest are Augustan in date. There are 11 examples of Hera-derived names in Thessaly, such as Herais, Herophilos, and Herodotos.93 Of these, two are late Roman (third-fourth centuries A.D.) and three are slaves. This leaves a proportion of Themis names to Hera names of more than 2: 1. The proportion of Themis to Hera names in Attica is, for example, about 1: 1.94 So far we have adduced only arguments ex silentio, but previously noted the sparcity of evidence for a cult of Hera in Thessaly; Farnell, op. cit. (supra n. 53): " [The cult of Hera does not] appear to have had such vogue in Thessaly and along the northern shores as it had in Boeotia, Euboea, Attica, Sicyon, Corinth and the Pelo ponnese." S. Eitrem, RE s.v. Hera 370: "Thessalien. Die Spuren eines Kultus sind sehr durftig." P. Philippson, Thessalische Mythologie (Zurich 1944) 69: "Hera hat in Thessalien kaum einen bezeugten Kult." M. P.

Miller these arguments are highly suggestive, if not conclusive. They are adequate, I would submit, to formulate the hypothesis that Hera was unpopular in Thessaly, and that Themis was her local equivalent. If one accepts this as a working hypothesis, certain literary passages be come explicable. Most interesting among these is the peculiar situation of Hera in the Argonautica. In this story, Hera is cast as the protectress of the Argonauts and as the patron saint ofJason, but there are anoma lies which have escaped the notice, so far as I can discover, of commen tators. In the first two books of the epic Hera appears only six times; she plays an active role in the story only upon two of these occasions, and in one of them she is actually responsible for an obstacle in the path of the Argonauts.95 It is Athena, not Hera, who is the protectress in these two books. Athena lays the plans for the Argo and aids in its construction; Athena presentsJason with his wonderful robe, the equiva lent of the Shield of Achilles in the Iliad; and Athena pushes apart the Symplegades and helps the Argo pass through.96 Hera's active role, which completely supplants that of Athena, begins only in Book 3 together with the entrance of Medea. The Argonauts have made the passage to Colchis, and are within sight of the Golden Fleece before Hera steps into the action. Her reason for doing so, her avowed purpose in supporting Jason, is to see that Medea returns to Thessaly in order to bring vengence upon Pelias, Jason's half-uncle, who does not pay her honors. This motif is stated several times; Pelias does not worship Hera, and her interest in Jason is based solely upon a self-serving desire for revenge on Pelias.97 This same theme is taken up by [Apollodoros]98 who relates that Pelias and his brother Neleus, finding that their mother Tyro was being mistreated by her step-mother Sidero, chased Sidero, who took refuge in a temenos of Hera. Pelias then slew Sidero upon the altar in this temenos and subsequently refused to pay honor to Hera. This sounds very much like an aetiological tale designed to explain the 95 Ap. Rhod., Argon. 1.997; cf. 2.216, 2.865. At 2.216 it is stated that the Argo is under the special protection of Hera. This is obviously a foreshadowing since Hera has done nothing to this point to deserve the title of Protectress of the Argo. 96 Ibid. 1.110; 1.721-768; 2.598-599. 97 Ibid. 3.64-65; 74-75; 1134-1136; 4.241-243. Although the motif of the revenge of Hera on Pelias is not exploited until the second half of the epic, the stage is set early, for at 1.14 Jason enters to find Pelias sacrificing to Poseidon and all the gods except Pelasgian Hera. 98 [Apollodoros], Bibl. 1.9.8.; cf. 1.9.16.</page><page sequence="29">Altar of the Six Goddesses 255 lack of popularity of Hera in Thessaly as well as her antipathy toward Pelias. While it is not very likely that the reason for this antipathy was that given by [Apollodoros], the ancestry of Pelias vis-a-vis that ofJason may provide a clue. Jason and his ancestors traced their lineage directly back to Aiolos, the eponymous hero of the Aiolic Thessalians. There is no reason to suppose that Hera was unpopular with the Aiolians, and there is evidence of a cult of Hera Aioleia on Lesbos.99 Pelias, on the other hand, although a great-grandson of Aiolos on his mother's side, was sired by Poseidon in the form of the Enipeos river, the large central Thessalian tributary of the Penios river.100 We may suggest that Pelias represents an indigenous culture in which Themis played the role of Hera. This culture may have been represented in historical times by the Penestai, a group of lower-class serfs not unlike the Helots of La conia; the pure Aiolians, such as Jason, would have formed the over lord baronial class.101 The indigenous culture may have had sufficient influence to prevent the replacement of Themis by Hera. There is, moreover, good evidence that Hera was not originally the wife of Zeus, and that she replaced Themis as his consort in the rest of Greece. Hesiod says that Themis was an earlier wife of Zeus,102 and Pindar calls Themis the original wife of Zeus.103 If true, and if Themis remained enthroned next to Zeus in the Thessalian Pantheon, then Thessaly represents, for whatever reasons, a holdover from earlier times. Themis is a member of the Thessalian version of the Twelve Gods and a legitimate holder of her position on the altar of the six goddesses at Pherai. VII. CONCLUSION If the hypothesis is accepted that Themis does hold the position in Thessaly more usually held by Hera in other parts of Greece, then the interpretation of our monument as a part of a sanctuary of the Twelve Gods is considerably strengthened. That this dodekatheon had an element of aniconism can also be regarded as reasonably well 99 Ch. Picard, "La Triade Zeus-Hera-Dionysos dans l'Orient Hellenique," BCH 70 (1946) 456. 100 [Apollodoros] loc. cit. 101 F. Miltner, RE s.v. Penesten; cf. Westlake, op. cit. (supra n. 14) 27-28. 102 Hes., Theog. 901. 103 Pindar, frag. 30 (Snell) 5: &amp;pXalov aMoXov Jdo'. If correct, the theory that Hera was unable to supplant Themis as the wife of Zeus in Thessaly would support the opinions of A. B. Cook, Zeus III (Cambridge 1940) 1065: "the case for Hera as essentially and ab origine the bride of Zeus is neither proven nor probable."</page><page sequence="30">256 Stephen G. Miller established, but the questions of the precise form and, to a lesser degree, the chronology of the monument must be left open. The solutions to these questions which have been offered in this paper are tentative and can be proven or disproven only by future excavations at the site of the altar of the six goddesses on the Acropolis of Pherai. University of California Berkeley Postscript: On p. 250 an intermediate stage in anthropomorphic development was discussed. I have recently found reference to an apparent equivalent intermediate stage of the evolution in Rome. The manifestation was, however, the opposite of that posited on p. 250 with the aniconic head of the Magna Mater set into an anthropomorphic body; cf. Am. Adv. Nat. 7.49.</page></plain_text>
