<plain_text><page sequence="1">Connecting Household History and Labour History MARCEL VAN DER LINDEN Labour historians have always shown an interest in working class men and women who participated in strikes, unions, and political parties. However, even when historians are receptive to the importance of family life behind public activism these scholars continue to use the "public sphere" as an approach for studying the family.1 This approach runs counter to historical logic because the daily life of those who join social movements and organ- izations involves far more than merely labour activism. To understand the true causes of collective resistance among workers, it is necessary to use the "private sphere" as an approach for studying labour protests as well. While this reverse perspective may not prove a panacea for all problems associated with analysing labour history, it will provide insight into the rather obscure motives of the working class for deciding whether or not to support the development of workers' movements. Furthermore, Jean H. Quataert wrote that examining working-class households makes it pos- sible to keep "in focus at all times the lives of both men and women, young and old, and the variety of paid and unpaid work necessary to maintain the unit".2 To the best of my knowledge there has been no systematic effort to establish a link between working-class families and labour movements. While this short paper is by no means an exhaustive discussion of this unexplored field, it does attempt to examine the relationship between labour activism and other strategies for survival and improvement in working-class households. Principles Up to this point I have used "families" and "households" interchangeably. The meanings of these terms, however, are not identical, as kinship forms the primary basis for families, whereas households are mainly economic units based on income pooling. The present paper is about households. 1 For essays using this approach that are excellent in many other respects, see Harold Benen- son's "The Community and Family Bases of U.S. Working Class Protest, 1880-1920: A Critique of the 'Skill Degradation' and 'Ecological' Perspectives", Research in Social Move- ments , Conflicts and Change , 8 (1985), pp. 109-132, and Bruce Scates' "Gender, Household and Community Politics: The 1890 Maritime Strike in Australia and New Zealand", Labour History , 61 (1991), pp. 70-87. 2 Jean H.

It stresses the budget-pooling aspect of households, an approach that serves the purpose of my project. The following reservations apply to using the designation of households: (i) Households do not necessarily consist of two or three generations of one family. They may include several families, other types of biological kinship (such as siblings), or members not related by blood or marriage. (ii) Households do not necessarily entail co-residence, not even accord- ing to Donald Bender's definition that calls for "a proximity in sleeping arrangements and a sentiment similar to that expressed in our folk concept of home".5 For example, at least one member in a household of seasonal migrants is likely to live elsewhere for months at a time and will nevertheless contribute substantially to the household budget. (In the absence of co-residence, it is possible to form what I will call second- ary households.)6 (iii) The focus on economic aspects should not diminish the role of households as culturally significant units shaped by symbolic processes.7 (iv) Rather than being predetermined, the composition of households is a product of negotiations. Factors affecting the composition of a household may include income, marriage prospects for men and women, employment opportunities, and government factors such as legislation and taxation.8 3 It is extremely difficult to provide a generally valid definition of households. Attempts to find "a precise, reduced definition" have been unsuccessful, as households are "inherently complex, multifunctional institutions imbued with a diverse array of cultural principles and meanings".

Members do not necessarily work for the common good of the household; on the contrary, they may be driven by selfish motives. Conflicts of interest are also possible, as well as oppression and resistance against oppres- sion.9 Both dependency and authority may vary according to the member of the household. Laslett pointed out that infants and children have the greatest stake in the household's survival, "since their life chances depend almost wholly on its existence and persistence, on their being accepted and retained as members. But children also have the least power to affect the household's decisions and none whatever to carry them out".10 This statement about influencing household decisions implies that while we should not arbitrarily ascribe a collective will to households, members nevertheless try to find (a variety of) ways to control their fate whenever possible. To this end, they negotiate to devise a strategy for generating and allocating the common budget. In these negotiations, household members must take various aspects into consideration. Contrary to the assumptions of economists constructing models,11 research in social sciences and history suggests that motives are very rarely purely economic,12 but are usually based on meaningful orienta- tions. Three of these interdependent motives keep reappearing. First comes the need for security. Students of the working class13 have confirmed James Scott's statement that "for those at the margin, an insec- ure poverty is far more painful and explosive than poverty alone".14 To maximize the size and stability of their budget, members of households may pursue good employment contracts and social benefits, distribution of risks by diversifying their sources of income, and/or earning part of their income through self-employment. These circumstances justify 9 Judith Bruce, "Homes Divided", World Development , 17 (1989), pp. 979-991; Diane L.

This tendency results from the virtual absence of a social security system covering illness, disablement, and old age, thus forcing those with low incomes to continue to rely on their villages for their security.16 The second motive for attempting to control the household budget is the drive towards dignity and respectability. People are not mere objects. Rather, their innate value is characterised by its non-negotiability.17 While social historians frequently limit discussions on respectability to the more affluent workers of nineteenth-century England, a more general application of this term refers to Barrington Moore's "decent human treatment".18 The third motive for these household negotiations is a desire for justice, which involves the need for reciprocal relationships with other parties and may apply to "social relationships in the institutional areas of authority and social coordination, production, and distribution, or more commonly in all three".19 Expressions of this desire for equality may range from a collective struggle for emancipation through individual attempts at self- improvement to envious behaviour designed to drag others down a notch.20 These three motives are clearly social constructs subject to various inter- pretations by different members of a household (especially according to differences in gender and age) and must always be viewed in terms of their specific social, economic, cultural, and political contexts.

Reinhard Bendix mentioned the link between self-respect and security.21 Julian Pitt-Rivers introduced an aspect of reciprocity with his description of honour (dignity, respectability) as "an evaluation of self in the terms which are used to evaluate others - or as others might be imagined to judge."22 Finally, Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge convincingly argue that workers are also trying to act on behalf of justice when they go on strike for wage increases.23 The existence of a link between the three motives does not mean they are always in harmony with one another. Conflicts may result both from different interpretations by various members of a household and from possible cases of incongruence. Households, like individuals, may for example face a choice between respectability and economic security (if, say, members are forced to do degrading work). Income and Expenditure The function of social budget pooling in households entails income and expenditure. This process need not be exclusively monetary: it may also consist of goods and services. The pattern of expenditure in independent households is composed of at least five types of expenses:24 -Support of household members involved in productive labour. -Support of these same individuals during periods of disability or unemployment. -Support of older household members who used to be involved in productive labour. -Support of younger household members not yet involved in product- ive labour. -Means to make payments to third parties (such as taxes, duties, and payment of debts). This list includes the possibility of economies of scale arising from common use of certain goods. (Whether a household consists of two members or five, its members can make due with one vacuum cleaner.) 21 Reinhard Bendix, Work and Authority in Industry: Ideologies of Management in the Course of Industrialization (Berkeley, 1974), Ch. 7. 22 Julian Pitt-Rivers, "Honor", Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences , 6 (1968), pp. 503-511, 503. 23 Oskar Negt/Alexander Kluge, Geschichte und Eigensinn (Frankfurt/M., 1981), p. 604. 24 This distribution is based in part on Claude Meillassoux's three categories of reproduction costs: "The value of the work force is derived from three factors: supporting workers during periods of employment ( retaining the existing work force), maintaining workers during periods of idleness (such as unemployment or illness), replacing workers by providing for their progeny (known as reproduction )."

These means may include income received from renting out beds or rooms.30 -Means obtained through transfer payments received without immedi- ate reciprocal exchange of labour or commodities, including support from friends and acquaintances in times of need, charity, and social benefits. -Means obtained from theft, including both conventional methods of stealing and, especially pilfering at the workplace.31 25 Kathie Friedman listed the first five of these sources of income in "Households as Income- Pooling Units", in: Joan Smith, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Hans-Dieter Evers (eds.), House- holds and the World-Economy (Beverly Hills, Calif., 1984) pp. 37-55, 46. 26 Bettina Bradbury, "Pigs, Cows, and Boarders: Non-Wage Forms of Survival among Mon- treal Families, 1861-91", Labour!

This statement does not exclude the role of other sources of income. On the contrary, working-class households usually rely on a variety of sources of income, virtually all members generate some income, and individual members (especially over the course of their entire lives) tend to provide income from numerous sources. While these observations do not imply the absence of a clear correlation between age and gender on the one hand and revenue-producing activit- ies on the other, it is likely that the degree of correlation varies according to the source of income.33 Strategies for Improvement The satisfaction of working-class households with their material circum- stances depends not only on whether their income covers basic necessities. Other significant issues include the reliability of the sources of income (the lack thereof may lead to insecurity), the question of whether this income stems from work considered undignified, and the question of whether the acquisition of income involves the acceptance of basic injustices. All these questions determine a household's strategies for survival and improvement. I will start by examining the means for self-improvement at the disposal of individual households. First, they might move to another neighbourhood, city, or country in the hope of finding more satisfactory conditions. Millions have already chosen this option. Second, they can take advantage of better times to take precautionary measures for the hard times that lie ahead. These measures may include saving money34 or 35 (1990), pp. 193-219, and Michael Griittner, "Working-Class Crime and the Labour Move- ment: Pilfering in the Hamburg Docks, 1888-1923", in: Richard J.

Fourth, they can change the way they obtain their income, for example by seeking other work or through diversi- fication of their sources of income. In addition to measures for households to try to improve their living condi- tions independently, there are several strategies involving help from outside sources. First, households may appeal to relatives . Many authors have indic- ated the value of kinship for household survival. Tamara Hare ven wrote that to many American immigrants and urban workers, kin were the main, if not the only, source of assistance and survival. In the absence of public welfare agencies and social security kin were the exclusive source of social insurance. Kin assistance was crucial in handling personal and family crises (such as child-bearing, illness, and death), and in coping with the insecurities imposed by the industrial system (such as unemployment, accidents, and strikes). [Further- more . . . strategies for kin assistance required both short-term and long-term investments over the life-course. Short-term investments entailed assistance in the workplace, in housing, in loaning money or tools, and trading skills, goods, or services. Among the long-term investments, the most pervasive exchange was that between parents and children, - old-age support in return for childrearing.36 Kinship relations outside one's immediate surroundings often proved especially important. An interesting method of distributing the risks involves mutual assistance between rural-agrarian and urban relatives. Heidi Rosenbaum described an example of this system when she men- tioned the importance "of family support from relatives in the country- side" for workers in Linden (Germany) in the early twentieth century.37 Jean Peterson showed how the reverse currently holds true for Philippine peasantry by writing that "some families explicitly plan to establish some siblings [ . . . ] as wage-earners in the city" to generate revenue in cases of crop failure or poor harvests.38 A second source of relief lies in personal communities. These communities consist of informal networks based on companionship, emotional aid, and Geschiedenis, Recht , Economische Funktie en Instellingen (Tielt, 1986), pp. 91-119; Johnson, Saving and Spending , Ch. 4. 35 John Modell, "Changing Risks, Changing Adaptations: American Families in the Nine- teenth and Twentieth Centuries", in: Alan J.

While the networks may be locally based (neighbourhoods), this restriction is not essential to their operation. Per- sonal communities also include kinship networks and require the same investment as strategies for short-term kin assistance (relatively small and readily available skills and services).39 Personal communities have always appeared gendered, although their focus varies depending on the time, the place, and the culture.40 There is often a fluid line between blood relatives and personal communities, as proved by frequent transformations of friend- ships into fictitious kinship relations, such as with compadrazgo (fictitious parenthood usually involving the relationship between parents and godpar- ents to a child) in Latin America41 and the selection of Taufpaten (godparents) among the nineteenth-century German working class.42 Acceptance of patronage is a third strategy. Whereas the first two forms of social insurance are generally horizontal, (the actors pertained to similar social classes), this approach is clearly vertical. As Y. Michal Bodemann wrote, it involves "a form of class rule and class struggle and at the same time its concealment."43 Weak subalterns seek protection from higher, more powerful individuals who help them in emergencies in return for material or other types of services. This relationship is not merely eco- nomic but sociocultural as well, as patrons receive their clients' loyalty and esteem in return for their protection and help. Forms of patronage may vary from political clientelism to patriarchal enterprise.44 A fourth and final strategy for social insurance involves joining or founding social movement organizations to bring about overall improve- ment in the conditions of (segments of) the working class. Examples of this strategy are mutual aid societies, producer or consumer cooperatives, trade unions, political parties, and combinations of these movements. 39 Barry Wellman, Peter J.

How households devise their strategy is of course crucial. Several factors come into consid- eration. The preceding description is taxonomie in that it covers opportun- ities that may arise over time. The various options are actually limited to specific historical contexts. Paternalism, for example, is less likely in advanced industrial societies than in less developed ones.45 Each actual situation will therefore present fewer opportunities than those described here. On the other hand, each strategy consists of several options: for example, those who wish to join social movement organizations can some- times choose from a wide range of possibilities. It is also possible (and even common) to use several strategies at once. Furthermore, the strategies described here are interrelated and can alternatively undermine or rein- force one another. Frequent geographical mobility can work against the establishment of powerful unions in some cases, whereas it might actually form the basis for organizations in other cases.46 Strategies may even inter- mingle. Close non-kin relationships can for example be transformed into fictitious kinship relations.47 Alternatively, kinship and personal commu- nities may provide a valuable basis for a social movement organization.48 45 Robin Theobald and Michael A.

It may also occur with patronage - patrons and patronesses can become godfathers or god- mothers respectively - or self-organizations. Emily Honig's example of female textile workers in Shanghai during the first half of the twentieth century illustrates this point: "After working together for several years, six to ten women would formalize their relationship with one another by pledging sisterhood. Once they had formed a sisterhood, the members would call each other by kinship terms based on age: the oldest was 'Big Sister', the next oldest 'Second Sister', and so forth. [ . . . ] Often the sisterhoods functioned as an economic mutual aid society". Emily Honig, "Burning Incense, Pledging Sisterhood.

Better known than this case of surrogate kinship among women are the countless fraternal organizations that have sprung up in workers' movements over time. For examples, see Mary Ann Clawson, Constructing Brotherhood. Class , Gender, and Fraternalism (Princeton, N.J., 1989). 48 See Zwahr, Zur Konstituierung des Proletariats. Furthermore, Bert Altena convincingly argues that "family acquaintance played an important part" in the formation of early working-class organizations in "The Dutch Social Democratic Workers' Party in the Province of Zeeland, 1898-1920", Tijdschrift voor Sociale Geschiedenis, 18 (1992), pp. 389-403 , 401.</page><page sequence="11">Connecting Household History and Labour History 173 Conclusion As households clearly have countless means of survival at their disposal, the decision to join a workers movement is far less logical and obvious than is often assumed. Labour activism, in whatever form, is but one of several options. Historical research shows that at least a portion of the working-class population is more likely to organize as workers and resist as the share of wage labour in the household budget increases. Despite increased wage dependency, the involvement of working-class households' in labour activ- ism is always partially determined by other factors, such as the job market, labour relations, state measures, and ethnic and religious cleavages. Perhaps an analysis of reasons behind and ways of household engage- ment in labour activities should begin by distinguishing between house- hold, enterprise, and state-centred labour activism. Household-centred act- ivism entails measures taken by wage labourers to accomplish more with the material means at their disposal without necessarily eliciting confronta- tions with entrepreneurs or the authorities. Mutual aid societies, which use a communal fund from several households to provide some protection in cases of unemployment, illness, old age, or death, are one example of this type of activism. Consumer cooperatives that purchase goods for sev- eral households at once are another. Enterprise-centred activism involves efforts to alter the economic balance of power between workers and entre- preneurs. Changes may occur either through battles against capitalist industry for higher wages or improved working conditions (traditionally the unions' job), or through attempts to establish and maintain producer cooperatives. Finally, state-centred activism aims to guide or obtain improvements from the state that would be impossible (or far more difficult) to arrange through household- or enterprise-centred activism. The most obvious organizational instruments for this purpose are, of course, political parties, although it is possible for other organizations to focus their efforts on the state. Once again, these forms of activism overlap. Mutual aid societies have often become unions, and consumer cooperatives have at times become actively involved in national politics. The gap between household history and labour history is also made clear by the lack of research on household-centred forms of labour activ- ism. Although many view mutual aid societies and consumer cooperatives as far less heroic than parties or unions, they have nevertheless played a major role in the improvement strategies of working-class households. Bridging the analytical gap between households and workers' struggles can provide valuable new insights into labour history. Translated by Lee Mitzman</page></plain_text>
