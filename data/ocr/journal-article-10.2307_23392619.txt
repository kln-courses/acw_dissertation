<plain_text><page sequence="1">"A Republic Amidst the Stars" Political Astronomy and the Intellectual Origins of the Stars and Stripes ERAN SHALEV Early modern political discourse commonly understood po litical entities in terms of natural artifacts. Polities, for example, were universally represented as "bodies politic," in which monarchs typically functioned as the head, while the other organs stood for discrete govern mental branches and social classes.1 Within this conceptual framework, and in light of the consolidation of a new type of regime and new ideologies of governance, namely the European nation-state and absolutism, early moderns witnessed the use of a powerful cosmic idiom, particularly a tendency to equate rulers of state with luminous astronomical bodies. Strong monarchs, who were now understood as the embodiment of their respective states (Louis XIV's "l'état c'est moi''' was the bluntest manifestation of this notion), were conveniently depicted as celestial bodies, particularly the sun: Early Eran Shalev is assistant professor of history at Haifa University, Israel.

Decades before Louis XIV became identified as the Sun King, the image was already so familiar that it was lavished on James I on his first progress southward from Scotland to become King of England in succession to Elizabeth, acting out the role of "the new sun after the old one's death."3 2.

It is understandable why old-regime political cultures mobilized anthropomorphic readings of the sun, which by the late seventeenth cen tury was surpassing the Earth in contemporaries' minds as the center of the solar system, if not the universe. The sun, a central, massive, radiat ing body constituting the center and fulcrum of a planetary "system," attracted, repelled, and presumably controlled other lesser bodies. Such understandings easily lent themselves to majestic readings, in which a luminous and dominant planet became the monarchial pivot around various parts of a nation, would revolve. The solar image positioned the king, according to the historian James Daly, as the source of human comfort, the body politic's primum mobile; all other authorities were inferior orbs, while "there was a high premium on each political or social entity minding its own business and respecting the rights of the others." Here was yet another benefit of the celestial imagery: Like a harmonious planetary system, the monarchial political structure would remain har monious as long as established hierarchies, or "spheres," were main tained. Centuries later, revolutionary Americans would resort to comparable reasoning, albeit with a marked republican accent.4 By the eighteenth century Britons were becoming gradually converted to the notion of a heliocentric universe. After a millennium and a half in which the Ptolemaic worldview was not contested, that stable system was critically shaken by the Augustan Age. Nevertheless, although the powerful ideas that Sir Isaac Newton generated certainly licensed a new and pervasive way of speaking about the world, historians are no longer committed to the traditional interpretation of earlier generations of schol ars that the eighteenth century held an "unreserved admiration and ven eration" for Newton; nor do they believe that contemporaries unanimously "understood and esteemed Newton's achievement." On the contrary, historians have charted the survival and vitality of non Newtonian and anti-Newtonian strands in the intellectual culture of the long eighteenth century. They have further demonstrated how various "Newtonianisms" were implanted and authorized through a wide variety of social settings, from new scientific societies emerging across Europe to popular series of lectures, demonstrations, experimentations, and public 4.

In a study of monarchism in colonial America, the historian Brendan McConville has identified and contextualized the articulate solar imagery that the Hanoverian monarchs elicited with increasing frequency early in George II's (1683-1760) reign. That language, which was particularly popular in British North America among colonials (who lacked the En glish îndiiierence to the German-born Hanoverians), became, according to McConville, commonplace by the second half of the eighteenth cen tury. Early in the eighteenth century, colonial Americans could discuss royal rulers as "lights that are set on High" who "must approve them selves fixed in their Orb &amp; move like the Sun, who as a Gyant runs his 5. The Ptolemaic universe consisted of a concentric series of material but trans parent spheres, moving around the earth on a single axis. Above were the spheres of the air, and then those of the moon, the sun, and the stars, which unlike the earthly sphere were deemed perfect and incorruptible.

Such language reflected back to the Sun, which could now be understood in anthropomorphic terms, as a "sovereign . . . accompanied with [its] planetary Equipage."6 As the century progressed, Americans, although rarely referring to the Hanoverian monarchs directly as "sun kings," repeatedly addressed their distant British monarchs in solar and celestial terms. The Georges were deemed "shining sovereigns" spreading their "superior rays," and de scribed as "glittering princes" crowned with "celestial bright" gliding "thro' shining worlds" to govern "Britannia's ruling court."7 The victories in the French and Indian War and the death of George II (1760) elicited a particularly meaningful flurry of analogies of the Brit ish king to the Sun, a planet that colonial Americans, like their European counterparts, understood through a political heliocentric prism as a "glitt'ring monarch." Hence, the string of British victories in Canada evoked analogies between "Sol [who] the glorious Sight displays,/With rising Jöeams with setting Kays, and the Jöntisn monarcñ, who the conquering Scepter sways." The wartime accession of George III could thus be described as the scene of the crowning of a shining star: "all the Skies tempestuous Clouds deform,/With brighter Radiance cron'd, the God of Day,/Clears the thick Storm, and chases night away." George III was, in short, "Britannia's Sun, [who] thro' the Gloom, appears" to lighten British "Hearts, and dissipates our Fears."8 But if the second and third British Hanoverian kings were widely seen by their Americans subjects as "the Georgian Sun,/The happiest Light that e'er on Britain shone," they were not perceived as Sun Kings on the model of their absolutist French rivals.

American colonists believed that Britons across the empire were drawn to their kings' orbit through "love and affection, the human form of Newton's gravity." The English kings, McConville concludes, stood like benevolent suns at the center ot the british uni verse; Protestant, restrained, rational, and liberty-loving.9 We now know that the shift to a universe hosting countless suns with their entourage of lesser satellites pervading a cosmos that was infinite for all practical purposes, and that astonishingly abided by fixed and mathematical laws of nature, was not achieved merely in the solitude of the library, the laboratory, and the scholar's chamber. Rather, this intellectual transformation occurred in unexpected spaces, such as the contentious world of the London coffeehouses, and commercial settings, such as entrepreneurial and profiteering "Newtonian" activity. Neverthe less, whether by solitary scholarly or public activity, pure scientific moti vation, or utilitarian and market-related interests, by the mid eighteenth century the new science had seeped into everyday discourse. With the intuitive belief in the stillness of Earth eroding, and the counterintuitive belief in its circling of the sun quickly gaining ground, journalists, learned societies, coffeehouse-goers, and public lecturers all spoke differ ently about the physical world they inhabited. JNewton s populanzers and the public they addressed were an integral part of the new cosmolog ical view of a universe populated by countless stars, and more boundless and deep than anything previously imagined.10 9.

Indeed, heavenly bodies had been found "to perform their circuits with great exactness and strict regularity," attesting to the sublime reliability of the "nature of attraction, and the laws of circular motion" that took place "universally in all material substances." The force of gravity, which Newton had discovered more than a century earlier, clarified whv bodies were attracted to the center of the earth. But it also explained how, while each star had its own gravity, all bodies attracted each other with respect to their respective masses; that was why the planets, the earth among them, held to their orbits.

Contemporar ies learned that "this earth which we inhabit, forms but a very minute part in that great assemblage of bodies of which the world is composed." The universe now seemed "prodigiously vast; immensely various: and more than mathematically exact." Its "countless Multitudes of Globes .

In this new universe, an American populizer of the New Science pointed out, "[t]he number of suns or fixed stars, are continually increasing, according to the goodness of Telescopes, they are innumerable ... it seems highly probable that they give light and heat to millions upon millions of habit able worlds."

Colonial governor Thomas Pownall (1722-1805) described die British Empire in 1764 as a celestial system in which colonies orbited in their "proper sphere," receiving their political motion from the first mover (the government of Great Britain V In this representation the British government replaced the king as the system's center, reflecting the change in the contemporary balance of power between parliament and king. An impersonal adminis tration had become, like the sun, "the center of attraction, to which these colonies . . . must tend."15 A decade later, in the fifth edition of the same tract, now published at the height of the imperial struggle, the colonies were asserting their autonomy, "the center of power, instead of remaining fixed as it now is in Great Britain, will as the magnitude of the power and the interest of the Colonies increases, be drawn out from the island." The cause of this effect was the operation in politics "of the same laws of nature, analogous in all cases, by which the center of gravity in the solar system, now near the surface of the sun, would, by an encrease of the quantity of matter in the planets, be drawn out beyond the surface." In the years leading to revolution American patriots would become adept at mobilizing celestial imagery in their political rhetoric.1® Revolution itself was, of course, an astronomical concept originally derived from the cycles of stars.

Hence, the revolutionary era may not have necessarily been, as past scholars thought, "a moment when technological languages of politics became prominent." Delbourgo does point out, however, that—as in the case of political astronomy this study traces—"electricity lent itself readily to political use because it provided a language of power."

The adapta tion and confluence of the celestial and the human, of astronomy and politics, m late eighteenth-century America rested on the idea that while human societies, like the numerous stars in space, fluxed in "seeming wildness," both were "governed and directed" by laws.17 This impressive adaptation of the cosmic to the political not only intensified but radically changed in the months preceding independence, as patriotic Americans shifted from monarchical to republican world views. Americans such as Benjamin Rush, who came of age in the years preceding American independence, had been taught "to consider [kings] nearly as essential to political order as the Sun is to the order of our Solar system." Only when the imperial dispute intensified in the 1770s would their cosmo-political worldview, one that perceived, in Rush's words, monarchical government "as fixed and perpetual" as the plane tary motions, experience a revolution. When that intellectual transforma tion was complete, Americans would no longer read the skies as a realm of hierarchical subservience to a solar monarch; they now read the cos mos as manifesting starry republican egalitarianism.18 The months preceding independence were crucial for this unfolding transformation. As American patriots witnessed their ties with the British Empire severed, the skies provided them with more than aesthetic grati fication. Patriots now increasingly found in heavenly constellations justi fication and proof for their experiment in revolution and federalism, and for the new republican world they were making. One may identify the emerging astro-political sensibilities in an oration delivered by David Rittenhouse (1732-96), scientist, surveyor, watchmaker, and member of the American Philosophical Society, in Philadelphia in February 1775, two months before the eruption of armed hostilities.

Revealingly, by dedicating the celebratory oration to the members of Continental Congress, Rittenhouse linked the political and celestial. Those congressmen, upon whom, in the words of Rittenhouse, "the future liberties, and consequently the virtue, improvement in sei ence and happiness, of America are instructed," would soon reconvene to find themselves conducting a war and declaring independence. The relationship Rittenhouse wove between the members of Congress and scientific astronomy, between politics and the cosmos, was foretelling, as the Congress to which Rittenhouse dedicated his astronomical speech in 1775 would soon establish that "the new American constellation" of thirteen states would he represented by thirteen stars in its major national symbols.19 The months leading to independence witnessed the emergence of an American-accented political discourse. One of the manifestations of this new and revolutionary view of the political world was the symbolic gram mar that presented each of the American states as a distinct star and consequently the United States as the American constellation. While the sun had customarily represented a king, with the system of planets surrounding that "king star" representing a political nation, revolutionar ies began treating stars as standing for discrete political societies, the sovereign American states. Theorists and practitioners would debate for decades henceforth the extent and the meaning of the autonomy of the colonies-turned-states constituting their Union. Understanding the American Union as a "system" composed of stars-states enabled them to imagine and communicate the proper relation between the system's starry and self-governing components and its luminous whole, the new American constellation. An early manifestation of this language is demonstrated by a moderate patriot, who explained early in 1776 in the Connecticut Courant that should "a declaration of independency" be pronounced prematurely, 19.

Here was an early expression ot what would become the staple ol American political dis course in decades to come: the analogy of the American (yet-to-be) states to celestial bodies. Like stars lacking a force to bind them in a gravityless world, the urematurelv independent colonies would be in daneer of scat tering chaotically and ruinously. No harmonious existence awaited the American confederation—still thought of as a loosely knit league of inde pendent polities—should it act rashly, before securing an "earthly power" to "support and uphold" the parts that composed it. If they waited patiently, however, the commentator in the Courant believed, the situation would change. Articles of confederation that would be "formed and solemnly ratified and confirmed by all the colonies, as the bond of their union and basis of their government," would create a different po litical cosmos. Such articles would "answer the same purpose in the political, as the centripetal force in the solar system," the commentator argued. Like the centripetal force that "preserve [d] the planets in their natural orbits and prevent[ed] their flying off in excentric courses," so would timely and thoughtful articles of confederation coalesce the colo nies and bind them together.20 If the Old Regime incentive to use stars in political imagery related to their aesthetic appeal, their remoteness and sublime beauty, here was a manifestation of Newtonian-republican aesthetics. Balance, order, and stability were at the center of this cosmic idiom. Constitutions would act as a physical power in revolutionary America to hold the states-planets together, as the laws of nature and laws of republics, of Newton and Machiavelli, would seamlessly regulate the worlds of physical and politi cal bodies.21 In April 1776, a few months after the publication of Common Sense, when complete separation from the British Empire became a viable op tion, one of Thomas Paine's supporters published a remarkable piece in the Pennsylvania Ledger. Perhaps reacting to Paine's own astro-political language ("[i]n no instance hath nature made the satellite larger than its primary planet, and as England and America, with respect to each Other, 20.

Like Dante guided by Virgil and Beatrice through the depths of the Inferno to the heights of Paradise, this author soared—in his imagina tion—up to the sky together with Paine: "aloft into the wilds of fancy, the dull beaten tracks of monarchy, we left far behind us." In the skies the space travelers "found a republic amidst the stars." An ingenious reading; of the cosmo-political meaning; of the universe followed. The Pennsylvanian admitted that in our heliocentric world "the Sun might seem, to admirine mortals below Γ as I the erand monarch of the heavenly bodies." Yet the universe contained not one, but countless "other suns and other worlds innumerable." The vastness of the universe, which made up a practically infinite system of solar systems, a multiplicity of galaxies that formed a cosmic unity, in itself ridiculed the notion of the sun as absolute king of the universe, hence of monarchical claims in general, let alone of "Sun Kings." Indeed, the many suns that populated space "might only be considered as Presidents, not Monarchs, of the vast system." Like Paine, who found the institution of Monarchy unnatural, this cosmological reading too found monarchy unsubstantiated by na ture. On the contrary, "the various constellations which enspangle the sky, [are] united upon the principles of perfect equality." Egalitarian and autonomous republics, not authoritarian monarchies, were written in the skies. Republican equality was demonstrated through cosmic harmony: "gravitating towards each other, with wonderful adjustment, mutually attracted and mutually repelled," the celestial republics existed in peace within themselves and their neighbors. As opposed to monarchical gov ernments that were destructive of happiness, the "republic amidst the stars" was one of Newtonian contentment, of a peaceful and perfect equi librium.2'2 This crucial move from a monarchic Sun to Sun-as-President and starry republicanism, from a celestial kingly hierarchy to astro-egalitarianism, was formalized in the fateful Continental Congress resolution of June 14, 1777, that "the Flag of the thirteen United States, be Thirteen Stripes, alternate red and white; That the Union be Thirteen Stars, white in a 22.

This laconic resolution does not elaborate or explain the meaning or symbolism of the flag's use of stripes, or of the colors red, white, and blue. Since the authorization of a new flag design was, according to a historian of the American flag, "a highly practical affair, without fanfare," we know nothing about the torces and motivations behind the symbolism contained in the Mars and Stripes.23 The use of red, white, and blue as well as the inclusion of stripes, and the use of a canton and field, did not necessitate explanation because they were already in widespread use in contemporary flags and stan dards. The fact that the resolution reserved elaboration only for the choice of stars to represent the thirteen states as "a new Constellation" points to the remarkable symbolic novelty of the new American flag: The united states were written in the skies, a novel and unprecedented politi cal constellation.24 Nevertheless, while studies have been dedicated to the origins and history of most symbolic elements contained in the American flag, the origins of the stars have remained more obscure and typically less ex plored.

Others have simply disregarded the question of its source or meaning.25 As should be obvious by now, the use of the symbol of the American constellation and the state-as-star involved a remarkable intellectual re configuration tightly linked to the emergence of American republicanism. This is not to say that in the late eighteenth century political readings of the heavens were new in the New World. Indeed, since the sixteenth century colonial Spanish Americans have been practicing "patriotic as trology," which expressed their belief in the heavenly beneficial and soothing influences on South America. However, only in the early United States a political astronomy that linked contemporary ideologies with the stars has emerged. Hence, rather than futilely investigating the elusive origin (or originator) of the symbolic representation of the star as-state, it would be more fruitful to uncover the meaning and signifi cance of that language.2fi Flags, the Stars and Stripes in particular, did not hold in the late eighteenth century the enormous importance they would acquire as the nineteenth century progressed. Historians tend to agree that the Flag Resolution, adopted with little ceremony by the obscure marine commit tee of the Congress, made little impact, if any, on revolutionary patriots. However, there is good reason to believe that at least some politically active Americans took notice of the new flag and its novel starry symbol ism.

This language was part and parcel of a discourse taking place in the democratized public and printed sphere. By 1778 patriots were already extolling "the stars, who support the honor of your flag, your new constellation, the thirteen stars," suggesting that soon after the Stars and Stripes became the na tion's official emblem, politically educated Americans may have already been aware of the understanding of the United States as a republican assemblage of stars.

The New Constellation served as an effective language to place the United States in a position and role that justified the unprece dented annearance of a new nation, narticularlv in a world still dedicated to the political value of "usage" and tradition. Here was a novel political language that was not '¿rounded like traditional republicanism in the re vered and ancient histories of liberty-loving yeomen societies. Rather, it was an idiom derived from a star-spangled universe and justified in cos mic, and thus ahistorical, terms.29 The formal enshrinement of the new constellation on the national flag initiated a starry discourse that would characterize U.S. political rhetoric throughout its history. This was the context when Congress created the Great Seal five years after establishing the Stars and Stripes as the official standard, resolving to place "[o]ver the head of the American Eagle . . . a glory, or, breaking through a cloud, proper, surrounding 13 stars, forming a constellation, argent on an azure field." Once again, revolu tionaries could go to great lengths to explain the symbolism of the new American constellation. While the rationale of the use of the different colors was set forth (white signified "purity and innocence," red was "hardiness and valour," and blue, "vigilance, perseverance, and jus tice"), "the crest, or constellation," newspapers reports explained, "de notes a new state taking its place among other sovereign powers."10 The fact that the Latin motto e pluribus unum—"out of many, one,"— was enshrined underneath the Great Seal's thirteen-star constellation un derscores why that metaphor was so effective: Although individual members of an assemblage may logically precede the whole, the starry constellation transformed this order.

It is significant that these Englishmen did not refer to America as a federal constellation of stars but merely as a "new primary planet" that disturbed the European "solar world." While American political astronomy echoed in the former Mother Country, in its British configuration it shed its republican accent.

Political and astronomical objects, "stupendous ou their magnitudes and motions," filled late eighteenth-century Americans "with amazement."32 The American constellation originally consisted of thirteen stars, but was in no sense a closed group. As we well know, the United States was a sprawling entity that looked to expand as soon as the war ended in 1783. Indeed, like the federacy it represented, the constellation incre mentally grew, star by star, tor more than a century. As early as I7ö4, when politically conscious Americans deluded themselves about an im manent Canadian revolt against their formerly shared British "usurper masters," they envisioned Canada as a prospective additional "star in the American constellation."33 They missed the mark again in 1788 when predicting that Kentucky would become "the Fourteenth luminary in the American constellation," and hoped that it would "reflect upon the original States." Their peren nial frustration with Rhode Island's behavior in refusing "to co-operate in this business" of the making of a Federal Constitution in 1787 con vinced them that "the American Constellation" would not "lose one gem thereby"; the still independent state of Vermont, they believed, which eventually would become the fourteenth state, "would more than com pensate the loss" of Rhode Island's star. When the commissioners of New York and Vermont "amicably adjusted . . . that Vermont [was to be] dismembered from the state of NY," a reporter rejoiced that "a four teenth star will be added to the federal Constellation.

When the Confederate government moved from city to city as the states could not agree on a permanent capital, a Boston newspaper jeered, "The high and mighty and most gracious Sovereigns the C[on gres] s, not being stars of the first magnitude, but rather partaking of the nature of inferior luminaries, or wandering comets, again appear in the wandering orb, assuming various directions and courses, sometimes reg ular and uniform, at other times, vain and retrograde."35 In an Enlightened world that valued order and regularity, a failed confederation was equivalent to a chaotic, gravityless, and orderless con stellation, a hellish universe tilled with ominous, unpredictable comets and lacking regularity and reliability. A dysfunctional American confed eracy was equivalent to a dysfunctional constellation. Americans who came to support the establishment of a stronger central government than prescribed by the Articles of Confederation (and were dubbed, ironi cally, Federalists), also believed that "unbalanced by a general govern ment, the human character would be humbled by the distressing but sublime idea of states flying frotn their orbits."36 The debates over the Constitution provided a stage for the further elaboration of the celestial discourse. During the constitutional conven tion John Dickinson presented a position that would become associated with antifederalists, and later with Jeffersonian republicans, when he "compared the proposed National System to the Solar System, in which the States were the planets, and ought to be left to move freely in their proper orbits." James Madison replied to Dickinson in the planetary parlance that the proposed general government "must controul the cen trifugal tendency of the States; which, without it, will continually fly out of their proper orbits and destroy the order and harmony of the political system."37 John Adams, another supporter of a stronger connection between the states, commented from London on constitutional issues in his Defense 35.

What was essential for America was a constitution that would control "those attractions and repulsions, by which the balance of nature is preserved: or . . . those centripetal and centrifugal forces, by which the heavenly bodies are continued in their orbits, instead of rushing to the sun, or flying off in tangents among comets and fixed stars."

Through the use of the language of celestial politics Americans asserted the cosmic underpinnings of their new form of gov ernment and the political philosophy of republican federalism. The heav ens seemed to prove not only that republican equality was compatible with nature and the cosmos but also that sovereignty could be divided into different "spheres." The language of political astronomy grounded the decentralization of the different levels of authority in cosmic harmony and celestial movement. By analogizing orbiting planetary bodies to po litical bodies, contemporaries reinforced the "naturalness" of the unprec edented amalgamation of several polities into one system.39 This language was in no sense an exclusively Federalist idiom but became associated with the larger discourse of early American patriotism. The reoeated use of astronomical images during the nolitical founding of the federacy manifests the relatedness of the notions of America-as constellation and "the redeemer nation." The discourse of the American constellation implied that the American Union was "natural," but also echoed an already existing idiom of mission (had not stars guided travel ers and navigators for millennia?) as well as of America as a chosen nation, God's new Israel, and the "last hope on earth" written in the sky. Such a republican idiom grounded in nature—and not, for example, in the annals of Greece and Rome—potentially exempted the United States from the excesses of human history. Hence, one of the attractions of political astronomy was that it could offer a path to alleviate American anxieties related to the corruption and decline that snared republics in the past, a dreadful moment which we have come to understand as "Machivellian." If so, the celestial metaphor was a significant manifesta tion and addition to the powerful paradigm historians have come to call "American exceptionalism," the belief that America was unique and 39.

Those celestial bodies had a sacred role to fill, those present at the meeting were told, namely to "Prove a luminous Constellation, enlightening the Bewildered, and directing the footsteps of the oppressed of the World to the Shrine of Liberty." This pathos-filled appeal to the world's brow beaten, coming from so unexpected a place as slaveholding and aristo cratic South Carolina, presented an eighteenth-century secularized version of a Model of Christian Charity. It further demonstrates how this cosmology participated in a central idiom of American political language. Characteristically, northerners made even blunter millennial appeals than their southern compatriots. A writer in post-Revolutionary Massachu setts prophesized that "the splendor of our American constellation, may go on encreasing—Until sun and stars, shall be no more; and all the kingdoms of this world shall vanish like a scroll."41 Apocalypse and astronomy, with their separate intellectual tradi tions—the one anxious, millennia-old and religiously metaphysical, the other stemming from the empirical and rational culture of the Enlighten ment—teamed up to position the American constellation in its proper place and to point to its proper function.

The vigorous American flag culture that developed in the nine teenth century attests to the pervasiveness 01 that language: 17 ot the 37 (46 percent) American states that joined the Union after 1776 would explicitly include stars on their flags. Most notable, perhaps, was Texas, "the lone star republic," which was founded as an independent state under the sphere of American political (and flag) culture and eventually attached its star-spangled state banner to the incrementally growing con stellation.46 This language of political astronomy would keep surfacing throughout the antebellum decades in moments of crisis and glory, as the Union was consumed by disputes over state autonomy and federal sovereignty. In that parlance, were the lesser state-bodies to determine the sphere of their respective orbits or would the federal center dictate the limits and course of the American constellation? A celebrated manifestation of these tensions and language emerged as Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Robert Hayne of South Carolina battled in Congress over the "abomina ble" protectionist tariff. Webster on his speech on January 20, 1830 (a week before his renowned "second reply") dreaded the "day, when our 45.

The southern senator chose to reply to Webster by employing the symbolic grammar embedded in the nation s flag. Webster, Hayne pointed out sarcastically, "is for marching under a banner studded all over with stars, and bearing the inscription Liberty and Union. I had thought, sir, the gentleman would have borne a standard, displaying in its ample tolas a brilliant sun, extending its golden rays Irom the centre to the extremities, in the brightness of whose beams, the 'little stars hide their diminished heads.' " Bringing back die solar imagery to the discursive table, Havne was revivine; the monarchical bogeyman—as well as the antifederalist fears of the late eighteenth century—that of a scorch ing central power, diminishing and enslaving all planets in its sphere wiiri us loo-poweriui gravitational pun. /\s opposed to vveoster, nayne s vision was one of "twentv-four stars ... in all their undiminished lustre." Such language of celestial repulsion, compulsion and autonomy contin ued to appear in the decades leading to the Civil War in political debates regarding the relation of the federal government to the states, often dur ing significant moments in the republic's history, such as President Jack son's Veto Message and John C.

Andrewjackson stated that the Union's "true strength consists . . . not in binding the States more closely to the center, but [in] leaving each to move unobstructed in its proper orbit.'''' John C. Calhoun made clear that "to realize its perfection, we must view the General Government and those of the States as a whole, each in its proper sphere independent." Hence, "to preserve this sacred distribution as originally settled, by coercing each to move in its prescribed orbit, is the great and difficult problem." Calhoun further believed that although the federal government was "in reality, a government . . . within the orbit of its powers, it [was], nevertheless, a government emanating from a compact between sovereigns . . . [thus] having, beyond its proper sphere, no more power than if it did not exist."

Significantly, they remained within the American star-ridden symbolic language forged during the previous tour-score years. One oí the first acts oí the Provisional Con gress of the new Confederacy was to solicit ideas from citizens and offi cials alike for the design of a new national flag. Congress received numerous suggestions. Remarkably, in the language of the official report, "nearly all the designs submitted to the committee contained a combina tion οι stars. In tact, out ot the lzU designs received, 1U7 (95 percent) included stars for states, more than any other element in flag. Both the initial design that was adopted (the Stars and Bars), and the saltire or St. Andrew's Cross that by the end of the war would in effect be the Confed erate flag, perpetuated the state-star symbolism of the Stars and Stripes.48 While the Confederacy inherited the symbolic grammar of political cosmology from the United States, it was evident that by 1860 two dis tinct visions of the cosmological nature of the American Union had emerged. A remarkable letter that the soon-to-be president Abraham Lincoln received from a friend attests to the richness that vocabulary had gained as the great crisis of the republic gathered momentum. In this letter, B. F. Lemen impressively expanded the astro-political imaee of the United States. Writing to Lincoln from Colorado, "the large Obser vatory in the Rocky Mountains," Lernen wished that "the labored calcu lations ol the political astronomers oí the South" tail, and that "the great Southern Comet will not Strike, our American Earth and dash it into fragments." In Lemen's depiction the South was not a constellation com posed of state-stars, but a comet bearing a "Firev appearance Iwithl nothing more, than a thin and exceedingly light vapor, or gasseous mat ter." As opposed to the unruly and threatening southern comet, the American, northern "Star Spangled Atmosphere" was "well regulated in its revolutions . . .

Lernen went on to convey to Lincoln the binding forces of the American "galaxy." Our Political world has the Propelling forces, or George Washington power,— which drives onward, amid the meteoric stones and gaseous vapors of wandering Stars—It also has the impelling and repelling Thomas Jefferson, Republican forces— which holds its own matter, and at the Same time, repells Extreme, and obnoctious execrations, or, all extraneous substances. It also has a gravitating or adheasive influence, which is the magnetic blood of the Fathers of the First revolution. That power binds the whole Super Structure toward one Common center. Lernen went on to describe the Declaration of Independence as Ameri ca's "morning, and Evening stars, the Ordinance of Eighty seven, its northern, great Constellation, or Pointers—and it has Liberty and Union, for its Pollar Star." If there were hints of satire in this remarkable exposi tion, they were eclipsed by the elaborate rendition of the American cosmo-poiiticai woria. inaeea, it was tne regularity 01 tne American con stellation that reassured Lernen, and possibly Lincoln, that the American world, like the star-studded universe, will continue to "roll on in its successive order."49 Northerners continued to articulate their cosmo-political vision in the years following the South's secession. In a wartime debate in the U.S. Congress on the future of the western territories of Nevada, Colorado, and Nebraska, House members anticipated that these would "increase the number of stars in the constellation of the Union." Beyond expan sion, however, Congress "hoped that by the same time the eleven way ward, wandering stars of the confederacy, now, like the lost Pleiad, separated from their sisters, will be restored to our political firmament, never again to be driven or drawn from their orbit around the central government by any sinister influence." Reflecting the earlier anxious lan guage of dysfunctional political constellations and the ideal image of po litical Newtonian heavens, these short sentences were suffused with celestial images, from the American constellation to the seven Pleiads and the "political firmament."50 49.

If southerners too imagined the late Union as the great system oi the universe, it was only by the benign and gentle influence of attraction that the bright stars of our constellation can be kept in their orbits." Reminiscent of the century-old persuasive and benign gravitational attraction that McConville associates with colo nial Americans teelings about tne Hanoverian sun kings, as wen ot as Ratification-era antifederalist sensibilities, southerners believed that if the kindness and moderation in maintaining the confederacy were sustained, tnose wno attempt to Driaie or spur tnem [soutnern statesj, win, m toe end, fare like the rash fool who aspired to direct the chariots of the sun." Gravity, a force that in the North strictly kept the states from disobedi ence and from scattering, became in the south a gentle, persuasive power that swayed stars into keeping orbit.5' To recognize the force and appeal oí this language one needs to look no farther than to one of Jefferson Davis's final speeches before the U.S. Senate. On January 10, 1861, just days before he left Congress to be come the Confederacy's president, Davis described the emergence of the American "constellation which was set in the political firmament, as a sign of unity and confederation." Davis elaborated the meaning of "that constellation [which] has served to bless our people . . . [and] its light has been thrown on foreign lands." Davis's following sentences, in which he powerfully reiterated the familiar contours of the centrifugal view of American cosmo-politics, are worth quoting at length: [f our Government should fail, it will not be from the defect of the system, though each planet was set to revolve in an orbit of its own, each moving by its own impulse, yet being all attracted by the affections and interests which countervailed each other; there was no inherent tendency to disruption. It has been the perversion of the Constitution; it has been the substitution of theories of morals for principles of government; it has been forcing crude opinions upon the domestic institutions of others, which has disturbed these planets in their orbit; it is this which threatens to destroy the constellation which, in its power and its glory, had been gathering stars one after another, until, from thirteen, it had risen to thirty-three.52 51.

It provided contemporaries with a language to dis cuss and articulate the proper relation of the separate state-stars to the constellational and federal whole, of the pluribus and the unum. While many revolutionaries, and later antifederalists and southerners wished to restrain the gravitational pull that cemented the constellation, Federalists and later advocates of a strong Union attempted to avert a universe full of anarchic, comet-like states, unaffected by the federal constellation's centripetal force. The broadness and elasticity of this discourse also meant however that it could not help in mitigating the ominous and wideninff fissures that eventually s η lit the American Union.
