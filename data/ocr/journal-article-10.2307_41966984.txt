Paper $25.00, 230 pp. Chris Maser says, "I have set out with you (the reader) on a humble journey through a forest of a thousand years so you may see that the forest primeval represents our spiritual and historical roots as human beings." First Question: Does "forest primeval" refer to the first line of Longfellow's Evangeline ? "Humble" can hardly be the proper adjective to describe a thousand year diary in 230 pages. Criticizing Mr. Masers false modesty is made in the interest of not making my commentary a completely favorable biased panegyric of this extraordinary treatise. Looking for factual or scientific inconsistencies is not my objective since I'm not qualified. I chose to "go with the flow," leaf-like on the powerful current of Maser s philosophical river. He starts with "the burn" in the year 987 (The fifth day of August!) in order to arrive a thousand years later, 1987, when he began writing. He has a firm scholarly grasp of human (Western Civilization) history and makes the reader comfortable by cleverly intertwining historical events which were happening in the world outside of the forest: perspicacious references to Saint Francis of Assisi, Joan of Arc, The Magna Carta, Columbus, Lief Eriekson, El Cid. A perfect marriage between the two diaries. Truffles. My favorite food. Strangely and paradoxically I found myself intrigued by the first tentative stirrings of deer mice after "the burn." Their subterranean activities were stimulated by their "gourmet appreciation of the fruiting bodies of fungi, called truffles." I have had a lifelong in- satiable appetite for the world's most expensive food. And here I am confronted with Maser s mi- nute and complicated description of the deer mice eating, digesting and propagation of my fa- vorite food in their fecal droppings throughout the forest. My truffled trout will never be the same. Speaking of minutiae, it is absolutely astounding to plow through the microscopic, eye-level, and telescopic descriptions about the myriad inhabitants, plants and trees in his forest. Did you know that: A flying squirrel "from a height of about 60 feet can glide about 163 feet at the rate of 6 feet per second" ? Fawns sniff the metatarsal glands of one another's legs once or twice an hour during the day and as often as six times an hour during the night? But babies are usually born within 30 minutes and in normal labor, there may be as few as 10 muscular contractions; and babies are born in a breech position? Very interesting. Masers book was written before Al Gore's "Earth in the Balance," but I believe that they stand close together in their pessimistic predictions on pollution and the inevitable catastrophic conclusion to the ultimate destruction (soon) of Biosphere I. Gore thinks that all technology is evil and wants to abolish all automobiles; our civilization is evil because it is "addicted to the consumption of the Earth (cf. Masers the economics of extinction.)" According to Gore, America, as a whole, is psychologically dysfunctional and 12,000,000 acres should surely be preserved as the spotted owl's sanctuary. Forget about jobs for human beings. Maser s treatise is a marvel of environmental advocacy if only because he is an eminently qualified scholar whose encyclopedic, quasi-religious, anthropomorphic musings are worthy of our attention. Also because he predicts cataclysmic consequences of the indiscriminate use of his metaphor of the destruction of the world's environment: the chain saw. Must read. As a parenthetical, though patently important, observation: you can't have it both ways. Michael Kinsley of Time Magazine has said "You can't have it all." "There is an inevitable trade-off between jobs for human beings and rigid legal requirements of environmental stan- dards. " For example: 1 2 ,000,000 acres for the exclusive use of the spotted owl versus logging jobs. You can't have it all. - A.A. Bernabei. Sida 15(2): 184. 1992</page></plain_text>
