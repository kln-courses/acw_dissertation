(Coniectanea Biblica, Old Testament Series, 42.) Stockholm: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, 1995. isbn 91 22 01664 3. Paper SEK 198. Aniconism is often thought to be one of the distinctive features of Israelite religion. To the extent that there came to be a complete prohibition of the use of images this may be true (though this was also later to be a feature of Islam). However Mettinger seeks to demonstrate that, understood more broadly, aniconism was a rela tively widespread phenomenon in the ancient Near East, and that it belongs to 'Israel's prehistoric West Semitic heritage' (p. 68). There is an underlying question as to how aniconism is to be defined. Some readers will, for example, find it surprising that depictions of the Aten in the form of the solar disc with rays should be classified as aniconic (pp. 49-50). However Mettinger does not use the term to refer to all types of representation but just to those of an anthropomorphic and/or theriomorphic nature. Thus phenomena such as masseboth or betyls (perhaps thought to be the dwelling place of the deity) are deemed to be instances of 'material aniconism' which may have served as 'functional equivalents' (p. 62) to images. There was also 'empty-space aniconism', evidenced in such phenomena as the empty throne or cart on which a deity was thought to be invisibly present. After an Introduction which deals in particular with terminolo gical and phenomenological issues, Mettinger's treatment is geo graphical rather than chronological. There are chapters on Mesopotamia and Egypt; the Nabateans; pre-Islamic Arabia; the Phoenician-Punic world; Syrian Bronze Age cities and Anatolia, and finally on Israelite aniconism. He suggests a movement from the widespread de facto aniconism of the West Semitic world to a programmatic aniconism which involved iconoclasm and the prohibition of images. '... we must reckon with the possibility that Israelite aniconism as a de facto tradition was fairly tolerant, by no means marked by an iconoclastic zeal until Deuteronomistic circles bestowed upon it a status confessionis' (p. 136). The work contains a number of illustrations, the majority of which are line drawings (some clearer than others) and site or building plans, but there are also a few black and white photo graphs. There is a substantial Bibliography, a list of illustrations, and no fewer than six indexes (of Biblical and Jewish sources, other Ancient Near Eastern textual sources, Greek and Roman authors, oriental words, a general index, and an author index).</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 183 There is a wealth of valuable information collected together in what is a relatively slim volume—the actual text, which includes the illustrations, comprises only just over 180 pages. Naturally such a work will raise many questions in the minds of its readers. For example, is it really likely that the Assyrian aniconic cult of the god Ashur would have acted as a stimulus to Israelite anicon ism? It might be thought more likely that Assyrian religion would have had the opposite effect upon its subject peoples. To be fair, Mettinger is only suggesting this as a possibility and not as in any sense providing an explanation of the Israelite phenomenon (pp. 138-39). Or is it probable that relief representations of deities on stelae (such as those of El and Baal from Ugarit) were a 'compromise between the venerated aniconic tradition of West Semitic stamp and the iconic preferences of the east' (p. 134)? It seems more likely that they were simply a particular type of iconic representation. But whatever questions the book may raise, there can be no doubt that it is an important work and that, in bringing together this material, Mettinger has done a real service to those interested in the religion of ancient Israel, its origins, and influences.
