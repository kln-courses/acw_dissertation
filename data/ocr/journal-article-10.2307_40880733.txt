<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SIGH AN INTRODUCTION TO A THEORY OF EXPRESSION * by Erwin W. Straus (Lexington, Kentucky). In his book Expression of the Emotions of Man and Animals, Darwin praises Charles Bell, « so illustrious for his discoveries in physiology », as the one who « may with justice be said not only to have laid the foundations of the subject as a branch of science, but to have built up a noble structure. » Darwin was referring to Bell's essays on the Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression as Connected with the Fine Arts, published in 1806. Both authors, although sharply at variance in their theories, agreed in their estimation of expression as a subject for research. Fascinated by the phenomena and surprised by the problems involved, their interest in the matter never faltered. Bell, who had started the composition of his book on expression « before, » as he said, « the serious pursuits of life began, » published the first edition at the age of thirty-six. This publication marked only the beginning of a long period of renewed and intensified studies. In 1840, two years before his death, Bell, then a septuagenarian, visited the Continent. He went to Italy with the intention of verifying his principles of criticism of art for a revised edition which he was preparing. In the preface to this third edition, published one year after the author's death, Joseph G. Bell says about his brother : « It was from these investigations that he was first led to make those discoveries in the system of nerves which * Presented to the members of a « seminar-day », held at the Veterans Administration Hospital, Lexington, Kentucky, on February 8, 1952.</page><page sequence="2">THE SIGH 675 are now acknowledged to be the most important contributions of modern times to the science of physiology. » Bell was still alive when Darwin began his own collection of data on expression. He continued and expanded his observations for a period of more than thirty years before writing the Expression of the Emotions. In this book, published in 1872, he mentions that his « first manuscript notes on the subject of expression bear the date of 1838. » Summing up the importance of expression, after such a long time of research, Darwin says in the calm undramatic style characteristic of so many of his works, « The movements of expression in the face and body, whatever their origin may have been, are in themselves of much importance for our welfare. ... To understand as far as possible the source or origin of the various expressions which may be hourly seen on the faces of the men around us, not to mention our domesticated animals, ought to possess much interest for us. From these several causes, we may conclude that the philosophy of our subject has well deserved the attention which it has already received from several excellent observers, and that it deser- ves still further attention, especially from any able physiologist. » Bell had a more epigrammatic formulation : « Expression is to passion what language is to thought. » If this is so - and who would doubt it ? - a new effort to solve the riddle of expression requires no justifi- cation ; rather, we need an explanation of why so little attention is given to this subject at a time when psychiatry puts so much emphasis on passions and emotional disturbances, and when psychosomatic medi- cine claims to be a new specialty, or at least a new approach to many old problems. There are theoretical and technical difficulties which everyone who studies expression must face1. But they stopped Bell and Darwin as little as they discouraged Engels, Lessing, and Lavater in earlier days or Duchenne, Piderit, and Wundt later on. Nor is contemporary philo- sophy and psychology lagging in this field 2. Psychiatry alone remains 1.

From a rich bibliography, I mention only Klages, L., Ausdrucksbeiuegung und</page><page sequence="3">616 Erwin W. STRAUS silent, although perhaps nowhere else in human affairs is expression used to the same extent as a practical guide. There must be, in addition to the general and permanent obstacles, some motive for this silence characteristic of our days, which counteracts a natural scientific curiosity. It should not be hard to find it. It must be disdain for what is supposed to be mere description. Research in expression demands patient observation of manifest phenomena. It demands a phenomenological analysis which respects the phenomena as they appear, accepts them at their face value, and resists the temptation to take them for coded signs which reveal their true meaning only after an intricate process of deciphering. This attitude, necessary for research in the field of expression, is met with peculiar disregard. Description, it seems to many, does not penetrate the sur- face : the true nature of psychological experience can be understood and explained only by methods reaching the deeper level of the operating forces which in their dynamic relations, in action and counter- action, occasionally burst forth to the surface producing the observable phenomena. However, one must not forget that the despised descriptive phenomena are the only ones directly accessible to us. The validity of dynamic hypotheses depends on the accuracy of descriptive observation. Whatever physicists may tell us about the structure of the universe, whatever psychologists and psychopathologists may have to say about the unconscious, in the formulation of their thoughts and in the commu- nication of their ideas, they remain bound to the descriptive level. Concepts of irrational forces are in themselves rational concepts - or not concepts at all - ; terms which signify the unconscious are under- standable and communicable only within the realm of conscious expe- rience. Niels Bohr in a paper concerned with the notions of causality and complementarity reminds the reader that also in « dealing with the paradoxical features of quantum theory ... all well-defined experimental Gestaltungskraft, Second Edition, Leipzig, 1921 ; Buytendijk, F.

If we assume with Des- cartes, for instance, the existence of an incorporeal intellect, then, brushing aside sensory experience as deceptive and illusory, we still may hope to reach truth by acts of « pure thinking. » However, if we understand science as a human accomplishment, we must not ignore the fact that science can never disavow its origin in the human world, from which it starts and to which it returns. Scientific truth is in direct rela- tion to the reliability of sensory experience. Before we try to explain anything we certainly have to make sure what it is we want to explain. Explanations which show little respect for the phenomena are not worth much even if they are labelled « dynamic ». Instead of entering into further argumentation about the epistemolo- gical and metaphysical assumptions on which the antithesis Descriptive vs. Dynamic is based, it may be better to test what and how much can be accomplished through careful description. The sigh may serve as the first example and model for our general considerations. The sigh, like so many other expressive motions, has been observed all over the globe, among people of all races and colors, among groups very dissimilar in customs and habits. Wherever human life has been depicted from olden days on - in the Bible or in Homer, in the « Divina Comedia » or in the « Comédie Humaine » - sighing is men- tioned. It is as universal, although not as frequent, as breathing ; but still it is frequent enough. There has never been any doubt about its meaning. Milton, in writing « Nature from her seat, sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe, » assumes that the meaning of sighing is obvious and understandable to everyone. The universality of expression is a phenomenon which has puzzled practically all observers. Because sighing shares with most, if not all, expressions, the character of universality - by that I mean universality 3. Dialéctica, Vol. II, 1948, pp. 312-319.</page><page sequence="5">678 Erwin W. STRAUS of production and of understanding - the discussion of the problem posed by the universality of sighing may be postponed until a later moment. Sighing is a variation of breathing. The sigh interrupts the flow of uniform and inconspicuous breathing. It stands out like a monolith from the plateau of regular breathing. It is a single respiration, dis- tinguished by its length, its depth, and its sound from the preceding ones and those which follow. Deep is the conventional attribute of the sigh. It indicates that a larger volume of air is inhaled in sighing ; however - and this is very peculiar - the air passages are not opened to the air pressing in. While volume and time are increased, there is no corresponding widening of space. The jaw is kept close to the maxilla ; it is not pulled down by muscle action, nor is it allowed to sink down following its own weight. In sighing the lips remain tight, or they are only slightly opened. The tongue, in its middle third, is arched toward the palate. During the sigh the air flows through a narrowed passage. The friction with the contracted walls produces the particular sound which distinguishes sighing from other forms of intensified breathing. The air inhaled in a larger volume has to be removed if breathing is to return to its original rhythm and measure. This is effectuated through an expiration which resembles the inspiration, since it also is longer and louder than the phase of exhaling in quiet respiration ; the air passages remain tightened in the exhaling phase of sighing. The discordance between the volume of air and the calibre of the airways makes it clear that the sigh does not serve a need for increased oxygénation. Sighing is the behavior of an eupneic person. The dyspneic patient and the hyperpneic athlete cannot afford the luxury of sighing. We do not find the sigh in a person afflicted with a circulatory failure or in an athlete regaining his breath after exertion. As Cabot and Adams point out, « a sighing expression ordinarily is not a sign of cardiac or pulmonary disease but is found in nervous, fatigued, or excited per- sons. » 4 4. Cabot and Adams, Physical Diagnoses, XIII Edition, Baltimore, Wilkinson and Wilkinson, 1942.</page><page sequence="6">THE SIGH 679 A patient in cardiac failure, gasping for air, is undoubtedly far removed from sighing. Here the passages, jaw, lips, mouth, are wide open ; the auxiliary muscles enter into function together with the diaphragm and the intercostales. The inspiration is prolonged, and retarded at the turning point from inhaling to exhaling. The dyspneic patient with pulmonary edema tries to increase as much as possible the inner pulmonary surfaces and to hold the air for a maximum of utilization. The hyperpneic athlete, who is not cyanotic and can make full use of the oxygen content of the air, shows a third type of breathing. Here, also, the passages are opened as much as possible; in the athlete's panting respiration the speed is accelerated, the inspiration appears short compared with the expiration which is accentuated and ends in a fast crescendo. If one would like to symbolize sighing by a musical notation, one could do it by marking two half notes not differentiated by any accent. There is as much weight on the inhalation as on the expiration. In the forced breathing of the athlete we would have to write a short upbeat followed by a longer downbeat, ending in an abrupt sforzando. Dyspneic breathing would have to be represented as asymmetrical, the inspiration lasting into the second half of the bar and separated from the expiration by a short rest. White and Hahn 5, in one of the rare cardiographie studies of sigh- ing, found that « sighing is never due primarily to heart disease but always to fatigue or nervousness or other such factor. » In their series of observations « of the eight cases of organic heart disease without effort syndrome but with congestive failure, none showed abnormal sighing. » Among the patients who sighed frequently, the authors did not find «any evidence of faulty action of kidneys, heart, lungs, or metabolism. » White and Hahn's observations are well documented with respiratory tracings, which also illustrate clearly the sporadic occurrence 5.

STRAUS of sighs and the symmetry of inhaling and exhaling in sighing. The sighs are written as single spikes in the midst of regular breathing movements. After a sigh breathing returns to the same level from which the sigh departed. Statistical and experimental studies thus confirm the results of direct observation, which, simple as it seems, has far-reaching consequences. It indicates that sighing is a variation of breathing not caused by « air hunger. » The sigh, obviously, has no physiological causation, or, as Darwin liked to say about expression, it « may not be of the least use, » or « not of any service. » Alexander and French 6 probably have something similar in mind with their statement that expressive inner- vations « are not motivated by utilitarian goals. » If the sigh does not result from specific physiological conditions, we cannot avoid the con- clusion that physiology does not comprehend the phenemenon of breathing in its totality. Breathing belongs in still another context : It is one of the basic experiences of an experiencing being and one of his fundamental modes of conduct. In this region, the region of expe- riencing (Erleben), we may, therefore, expect to gain an understanding of the sigh in particular and of expressions in general. Perhaps someone may still try to claim a physiological purpose to the sigh. He may argue as follows : The respiration of the one who sighs, whether he is depressed, tired, or bored, is not sufficient ; he stands or sits stooped, his head bent downward ; subsequently, his breathing will be shallow and will bring about an oxygen need after a while, which will be satisfied by the more voluminous respiration of sighing. It was on such assumptions that Darwin based the explanation of sighing. In a chapter dealing with « Low Spirits, Anxiety, Grief. . . » he remarked, «The breathing becomes slow and feeble, and is often interrupted by deep sighs. As Gratiolet remarks, whenever our attention is long concentrated on any subject, we forget to breathe, and then relieve ourselves by a deep inspiration ; but the sighs of a sorrowful person, owing to his slow respiration and languid circulation, are 6. Alexander, Franz, and French, Thomas M., Studies in Psychosomatic Medi- cine, New York, Ronald, 1948. ;</page><page sequence="8">THE SIGH 681 eminently characteristic. » In his description of grief Darwin used, besides his own observations, three passages from Gratiolet's work on expression. On one occasion Gratiolet said, « Je ne puis m'empêcher de faire ici une remarque. C'est que l'attention est fixante de sa nature, et que pour cette raison elle n'est jamais sans quelque mélange d'effort. Cet effort suspend pour un instant la respiration. De là ce besoin urgent de respirer et de bâiller après quelques moments d'une attention sou- tenue. Cet état est souvent très-pénible, et comme il est instinctif, la volonté ne la gouverne pas, et les personnes de travail en sont souvent singulièrement incommodées. » 7 The assumption of « air hunger » is in conflict with the paradoxical fact that no open air passages correspond to the increased volume of air. If sighing were intended to serve any purpose of re-establishing the metabolic equilibrium, it would be a very inappropriate means to this end, for the increased time spent in sighing slows down the rhythm of respiration from a ratio of 14-16 to one of 12-15 per minute. Sighing could only increase and not reduce the oxygen deficit. Careful scrutiny of our film strips of patients studied for expressive movements brought to light an occasional sigh - or a few - in a great number of cases. Reviewing this material, we found not one case where any irregularity of breathing would announce an oncoming sigh. Inva- riably, the sigh, as a single act of breathing - a deep inspiration coupled with a deep expiration - interrupted series of inhaling and exhaling, regular in rhythm and volume. Sighing was less frequent when patients were active ; it occurred more often during the short intervals between individual tests or tasks, at a moment when the patients were left to themselves. The absence of any strictly physiological meaning and purpose in sighing can be further demonstrated if we turn our attention from the sigh to the sighing person. He does not increase the action of the diaphragmatic and costal muscles like the hyperneic ; he does not have recourse to auxiliary muscles like the dyspneic ; instead, he lifts and lowers his shoulders synchronously with the inspiration and expiration 7. Gratiolet, Pierre, De la Physionomie, Paris, 1865, p. 232.</page><page sequence="9">682 Erwin W. STRAUS of sighing. One can, as in an experiment, nearly prevent sighing by arresting the excursion of the shoulder girdle. It suffices to cross the arms so that the palms grasp the humérus, a position which does not interfere with hyperpneic diaphragmatic breathing. The lifting of the shoulders adds little to the physiological function of breathing ; in .fact, sighing is of so little use to respiration that if it is done at repeated short intervals it will render a person dyspneic. In hyperventilation, intensified breathing, corresponding to an anxiety state, for example, actually leads to a disturbance of the acid-base equilibrium. The statement that sighing is not physiologically determined needs some qualification. Obviously, sighing, like any other physical perfor- mance, depends on physiological mechanisms. When we say that sighing has no physiological determination, we take the term « physiological » in the specific sense, as it is used by physiology itself. The physiologist considers respiration in so far as it serves the exchange of gases ; he is interested in the chemical and reflex controls of breathing, in the main- tenance of standard solutions of CO2 and O2 in the blood, in the preservation of the acid-base equilibrium, and in the elimination of heat during hyperthermia. Such physiological knowledge of breathing, admirable as it is, has no counterpart in the immediate experiencing of breathing. The dis- covery of the biochemical functions of breathing is of very recent date. Even William Harvey had not yet come to understand or to anticipate the process of oxygénation : « As late as 1649 he emphatically denied that blood undergoes any initial change during its transit through the lungs. » 8 The experiencing of breathing, however, is as old as mankind. It is universal and immediate ; it is every man's property, as indisputably as breathing itself. It begins in the earliest phase of any individual's life. The physiological knowledge, on the other hand, is a possession shared only by a small number of scientists. It is acquired in later years through indirect methods, always open to further argument.

I, No. 172 (1951), pp 22-37.</page><page sequence="10">THE SIGH 683 cal concepts are an abstract knowledge which can never be turned into primary physiognomical experience. The difference between the experiencing of breathing and the physio- logy of respiration is not identical with that of prescientific interpreta- tion and scientific explanation. The physiologist studies processes within an organism. The theme of experiencing is different - so radically different that its meaning and content cannot be pressed into the physiological scheme of stimulus and response. This could only be done if experiencing were « nothing but » an epiphenomenon accom- panying nervous processes, if perceiving were « nothing but » stimu- lation of receivers and afferent nerves, if acting were « nothing but » contraction of muscles. The formulation of a theory of expression will lead to a head-on collision with these assumptions, which, in my opinion, delude psychology and psychopathology. A discussion of the traditional declaration of the incompetency of experiencing has to be postponed at present. We still have to work our way upward from a description of a special phenomenon of expression to an insight into its general problems. Unfortunately, immediate experiencing is ineffable ; it does not know itself, not because it is unconscious but because it is unreflective. Like Sleeping Beauty, who had to wait for her Prince to break the spell, immediate experience has to wait for the one gifted with the power of the word to bring it out into the light. The moment this is accomplished, however, immediate experience is threatened by another danger. Just as objective observations are answers to questions and are, therefore, determined by tradition, training, and expectation, immediate expe- rience may be masked by the very word which enunciated it. Our per- sonal experience also appears to us in the light of tradition, training, interpretation. A questionnaire concerned with the experiencing of breathing would be of little use. The answers probably would be filled with references to oxygen and carbon dioxide. We have lost our naïveté; we are - one may say - scientifically prejudiced. Nevertheless, while the word which reflects immediate experience easily degenerates into a stereotyped formula, we can with some effort return to it its original</page><page sequence="11">684 Erwin W. STRAUS vigor. We may justly expect the meaning of an experience as old and universal as that of breathing to be revealed by language, the true repository of common human experience. In the Biblical words, « And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul », breath is conceived of as the principle of life. Breath is the deity's gift to the creature. It « animates » the orga- nism and transforms the shaped matter into a living being. The breath blown into Adam's nostrils becomes the essence of his individual exis- tence. Yet it preserves the character of its origin. Through breath, a loan more than a possession, man and « anima-ls » partake in the divine principle that permeates the Universe. In inhaling and exhaling, the individual, being monadic in its nature, remains, nevertheless, connected as a part with the whole of the world. The usual Hebrew words for breath «Nesh/mah», breathing «N^sham», and soul « Nesh¿zm¿zh », are in full agreement with the anthropology given in Genesis 2: 7. The Biblical interpretation of life and breath has its exact counterpart in other cultures and in other language families. In Sanskrit « Atman » - which we may spell with a capital « A » - is the all-pervading divine power, the soul of the cosmos, while « atman » signifies breath as the life-giving principle and therefore, also, as the individual soul. In modern German « atman » persists almost unchanged - with « atem » as the noun and « atmen » as the verb - corresponding to breath and breathing. The concept of « Atman », to be sure, barely escaped extinction ; it exists only in a few archaic and obsolete tropes. In contemporary English the original rela- tionship is more hidden than obvious, but the procedure of uncovering does not require much philological information. In Latin and Greek the analogy with Hebrew and Sanskrit is cleer and striking - as in the Latin pair of words : « spirare » (to breath, the root of « respiration ») and « Spiritus », and the Greek pairs : « psychein » and « psyche », « pneuein » and « pneuma », with corresponding connation. The «Sanctus Spiritus» of the Vulgate is in meaning and phrasing the</page><page sequence="12">THE SIGH 685 literal translation of the New Testament Greek word « Hagion Pneu- ma ». One sees how the same idea returns, a true archetype, in various shapes. As these linguistic statistics gain in validity with every new item added to the etymological series, it is worth mentioning that a familiar Latin word for breath and soul, « anima », is a namesake of « anemos », the Greek word for wind. Like parallel lines converging in perspective drawing to the vanishing point, the linguistic parallels converge to the point of their common origin in immediate sensory experience. The complete agreement between terms so different in their ancestral lines of culture and language demonstrates that this common interpretation is but one step removed from the original experiencing. The relation of « Ne Shi Ma » and « Ne Sha Ma », of « Atmen » and « atman », of « pneo » and « pneuma », of « spiro » and « Spiritus » are intuitive interpretations of breathing, half-way between image and concept. Purists, therefore, may condemn them as anthropomorphic. They certainly are anthropomorphic ; but they do not deserve rejection, for human experience can only be anthropomorphic. Here we are interested in how the world appears to a human being, not how, supposedly, it is in itself, that is, how it is conceived in relation to an incorporeal mathematical intellect. One must not overlook the fact that through observation and communication science rests upon those anthro- pomorphic qualities of experience which positivistic scientists want to eradicate. Thus, accepting the counsel offered by language, we conclude that the primary experience of breathing is that of participation and exchange, of receiving and expelling, of doing and suffering, of acting and being compelled. In breathing we experience our vital existence in its dépendance and in its uniqueness, in its never ending contact and exchange with the world. Breathing as a medium of contact does not remain a silent function. Breath carries the voice. It can be transformed into an « utterance ». The first breath of the new born turns into a cry. In crying out, a sound proceeds from my mouth but it returns to me ; I hear myself. In crying out, I experience myself within the world as a part of it ; the traditional</page><page sequence="13">686 Erwin W. STRAUS dichotomy of inner-outer makes no sense. In crying out, I am acting, producing ; but the product, which becomes a part of the surroundings, remains, nevertheless, my voice. In crying out, I surpass the confinement of the body-scheme ; I reach out ; I call for attention. In crying out, I find myself accepted or rejected ; I meet response or indifference, support or resistance. The sound, articulate or inarticulate, appears as if it were the original model of all property, for it is detachable, mova- ble, transferable ; yet it remains mine in all these transactions. In crying out, we experience our power or our infirmity. Breath which, in exhaling, carries our voice brings in, in inhaling, smells and scents. The voice announces to the world our moods and wishes ; smell orients us in the world. The oldest among the senses is assigned as scout and sentry to the indispensable and continuous func- tion of breathing. A foul smell takes away our breath, a pleasant smell induces a deep wide breathing. Smell and breath are in reciprocal relation. Smell is the « warden and warner » of breathing ; breath is the activator of smelling. While circulation - the driving of the blood through the closed « inland-system » of vessels - is exempted from voluntary and anticipatory modulation, respiration, which establishes direct and incessant communication with the world, permits voluntary interference to a limited degree. Indeed, speech and smell both demand such interference. Accentuation, to single out just one factor of articu- lation, depends on accurate timing : retardation and acceleration, increase and dimunition of breath. Likewise, orienting smelling requires voluntary, but less precise, regulation of breathing. Although upright posture, which contributed to the active control of breath, has reduced the importance of smell as a human sense of orientation and searching, still a bad odor chases us away, a sweet fragrance invites us to stay and to absorb. Whether active or passive, smelling reveals the original character of sensory experience : to be dominated by attraction and repulsion. There is a motor element in sensory experience. The psycho- logical content of attraction is that of « not yet being united. » This « not yet being united » is not a statement about two phases, one of unification and the other one preceding it ; psychologically, it belongs</page><page sequence="14">THE SIGH 687 to the first phase itself. Recent research in neurophysiology has cast some doubt on the strict topical separation of sensory and motor functions in the brain cortex. However this may be, sensory experience is not an accumulation of neutral sensory data ; it is the attitude of a movable being, capable of unification and separation. To sum up, the experiencing of breathing has three facets : first, that of participation and exchange ; second, that of power and infirmity ; and, third, that of attraction and repulsion. In this context - the psychology of breathing - the sigh - enigmatic to the physiology of respiration - becomes understandable. Our thesis is that the sigh is a variation of breathing in so far as breathing is experienced as a relation to the world. A sigh occurs when the equilibrium between the individual and the world is disturbed, when pressure and resistance are increased. The focus of this disturbance is irrelevant. The sigh appears to be a futile effort to throw off the burden, and, yet, it is not an action which finally ends in frustration, nor an action at all - for action leads from a start to a goal, it brings about a change ; at the end of action the initial situation is abandoned. Sigh- ing, however, does not lead from a start to a goal, failure is immanent from the beginning. Beginning and end, so to speak, are one. Sighing expresses an intolerable situation ; it does not intend to change it. At this point we may do well to expand our considerations. Thus far we have identified the sigh with the sigh of grief, but there is also the sigh of relief, and there are other forms. According to Webster, the sigh is « a deep and prolonged audible inspiration or respiration of air, especially when involuntary and expressing some emotion or feeling, as grief, yearning, weariness, relief. » Webster does not say what differences, if any, there are between the sighs of grief, of yearning, and of relief. Obviously, the assumption is that we are able to distinguish between them, that we are not to take the sigh of relief for an expression of grief. Even so, sighing could always follow the same pattern : environmental conditions alone would permit a distinction ; but this is not the case. Distinction does not</page><page sequence="15">688 Erwin W. STRAUS depend on a commentary given by the actual situation. Expressive motions speak for themselves. The sigh of relief resembles the sigh of grief in the first phase - that of inhaling. At the turning point, however, a sudden change occurs. The air is not forced out through a narrowed passage as if it were against the resistance of the world. At the turning point the mouth is vigorously opened, the air flows out easily and rapidly, meeting no obstruction. The shoulders do not sink back in fatigue, in resignation ; they are lowered as if freed from all burden. The chest is thrown out, the arms slightly stretched into the surrounding space. The sigh of relief - just like the sigh of grief - is a variation of breathing, in so far as breathing is experienced as a relation to the world. It occurs when emotional pressure is lifted, when resistance has faded, when the equilibrium between the individual and the world has been restored. The sigh of relief - like the sigh of grief - expresses a situation ; it does not intend to produce any change. It does not release tension but expresses relaxation ; the sigh of relief makes it appearance when - after an unexpected message, for instance - the tenseness of a situation has been decreased. If only the sigh could be explained as a means of communication ! The statement, however, that all expressive motions serve communica- tion is a postulate, a dogmatic construction invented to overcome theo- retical difficulties. It certainly would facilitate the theoretical issue if the proposition were correct. Expressive motions could be grouped with a class of familiar functions ; we could avoid the difficulty of explaining why motions not aiming at communication could serve communication so well. Unfortunately, the postulate is not, as the sigh shows, in agree- ment with the facts. The sigh demands no witness ; it has no social function, although it may secondarily affect interpersonal relations and may be arbitrarily produced for that purpose. Interpersonal relations, even if they are paramount in, and decisive for, most human behavior, are not omnipresent. There are elemental relations of the individual to the world - and also, therefore, disturbances of such relations - which are not derived from interpersonal relations. Our thesis explains this</page><page sequence="16">THE SIGH 689 point well. As breathing establishes a relation between the solitary individual and the world, sighing - a variation of the experiencing of breathing - shares in the solitude of breathing. The sigh, it seems, does not fit into any familiar scheme. First we could not discover a physiological condition ; now we are unable to find a psychological purpose. The sigh is an activity but no action. It is communicative but not intended for communication. Its meaning is manifest, but the relation of the sign to the signified, - sighing to grief or sighing to relief - is obscure. The sigh is understandable as a whole but little known in its details. Its spontaneous production evokes imme- diate response, but neither performer nor observer can account for their behavior. The sigh does not have the character of a reflex, but it is not intentional either. Obviously, the traditional frames of reference prove insufficient. This is an alarming situation, a signal for a revision of the basic categories of psychology. Our thesis points to the direction which we should follow. We turned our interest to the sigh with the expectation that an analysis of one of the many of the phenomena of expression would lead to an insight which could be generalized. The possibility of applying our thesis to other expressions than those for which it was originally designed 9 makes it probable that our explanation was not altogether wrong. We may, therefore, assume that the paradoxical situation just described is not limited to the sigh but inherent in expression in general. If this is so, our next move should be an attempt to generalize our thesis and to see whether this generalization will help us to a better under- standing of expressions. Success or failure will decide whether the guiding assumptions have been correct. Applied to expressions in general our thesis may be formulated this 9. Sneering, snarling, and sniggering may be added here, all of which belong, as expressive variations of breathing, in the same group with sighing. They and many similar words share - for good reason - the initial onomatopoetic letters « sn » with sneezing, sniffling, and snorting. They are related by a common denominator : a brisk short discharge of air. However, the vehement reflex action of sneezing serves the clearing of the nasal airways ; sneering and snarling have no such physiological purpose ; they do not produce any change. They express disdain through the accentuated but effortless elimination, the puffing out, of so much superfluous air.</page><page sequence="17">690 Erwin W. STRAUS way : Expressive motions are variations of fundamental functions in the performance of which the individual (man or animal) experiences his existence, his being-in-the- world, in a mode peculiar to him. One could also say that expressive motions are the variations of fundamental functions in the experience of which the individual performs his being- in-the-world. By « fundamental functions » I mean such forms of behavior as, for instance, breathing, keeping upright, walking, seeing, mating. Fundamenetal functions, varying from species to species, de- termine in their specificity for each member of the species the basic dimensions (possibilities and limitations) of his being-in-the-world. If expressions are immediate variations of fundamental functions, every form of behavior needs to be expressive, the calm breath as well as the sigh, the friendly or indifferent look as well as the paranoid one, the nonchalant walk or the gay step as well as the depressed gait. Because the extremes are frequently more easily accessible, we are inclined to give a special label to the extraordinary, which catches our attention most. We forget that the middle between the extremes belongs to the same order. We call smiling an expression, but non-smiling is also expressive - under certain conditions a very strong expression, threatening and frightening. The concentration of research on a limited group of expressive motions, ignoring the ubiquity of expression, can but misguide us and prevent our understanding of the phenomena. In formulating and elaborating our thesis we have found ourselves faced with a peculiar difficulty : thesis and commentary will not reveal their full meaning until a revision of the basic categories has been accomplished. Still I cannot avoid referring to something which does not yet exist in print 10. The remarks in which I will try to explain my 10.

Experiencing beings are directed to the world in which they, never- theless, keep themselves apart, maintaining their identity and integrity as individuals. Experiencing is synonymous with experiencing-the- world and with experiencing-oneself-in-the-world. It is directed to the Other ; but one experiences the Other only in relation to oneself and vice versa. Experiencing is of the I-World relation. This relation, which is not a compound of two parts - I and the World - but exists only as a whole, cannot be translated into or replaced by the sequence « sti- mulus and response. » Experiencing beings do not merely occur. In sleep - or to be more correct in coma - they resemble inanimate things, which are simply present or at hand. Experiencing beings, while awake, always find themselves in a situation. One may as well say, « to find oneself in a situation » - this is exactly what experiencing signifies. Therefore, a motor element must be inherent in experiencing : directions to or fro, attraction or repulsion, attack or retreat. The fundamental functions delineate the possible situations. Men and animals experience and perform their existence as sensory-mobile beings in deporting11 themselves toward the world - in opposing and yielding, searching and fleeing, accepting and rejecting. They experience in their corporea- lity ; experiencing is related, therefore, to gravity, air, light, space, distance, to incorporating, meeting, and avoiding. In every single one of the fundamental functions the being-directed-to-the- world is realized in a particular form. In getting up, for instance, and in keeping upright a man distances himself from the ground on which he finds his support. Thus, in opposing gravity, he experiences, in his exertion, his own strength and at the same time, the counter- forces which he resists ; he experiences his being capable or failing. Expressive motions, we have said, are variations of fundamental 11. I have selected the word deporting because the original meaning of behaving has become obsolete, thanks to behaviorism, which turned the original connotation into its very opposite.</page><page sequence="19">692 Erwin W. STRAUS functions in which a person performs his being-in-the-world in a mode peculiar to him. Take, for example, a depressed person ; his posture - a variation of keeping upright - , his weary gait - a variation of walking - , his a-voluminous voice - a variation of breathing and uttering - make manifest his being overcome by the counterforces, his succumbing. Or, to give another example, let us consider the expression of astonishment, of « breath-taking » amazement - the wide-open eyes, the gaze fixed upon the object, the jaw dropping, the breath arrested at the height of inhaling. There again we have variations - homolo- gous variations - of fundamental functions, this time of seeing, of incorporating, of breathing. These and many other expressive motions are universal and uniform because they are variations of fundamental functions and, therefore, variations of basic human attitudes. We under- stand these and other expressions without preceding instruction because we meet the other one not as a body but as an individual who in resisting and yielding, in searching and fleeing, is related to the world and to us, cor-responding to our own approach. Expressions are not secondary, not additions subsequent to sensory data. The facts to prove this are plentiful and unambiguous. In their early months babies answer in true meaningful responses the expressive behavior in their environment. The children's world of toys and fairy tales is understandable and appeals to them because it is full of physiognomies. That stones and trees, sun and wind, wolf and rabbit, all can talk is not surprising in a world where expressions reign. The existence of the in-animate, of mere things, is a late discovery. The magic world of primitive people is not an outgrowth of archaic functions but of a naive interpretation where physiognomic characters are accepted as manifestations of essential qualities. The elimination of physiognomic characters is a slow process ; it is never complete. They are always present ; they regain their full power, not only in dreams, in inebriety, and in psychoses but in all those situations where we still live in the landscape. The facts tell us that all this is so. The right concept of experiencing will explain that it cannot be otherwise.</page><page sequence="20">THE SIGH 693 Experiencing is the only authentic theme of psychology. Psychology deals, or should deal, with experiencing beings, not with a mind or an intellect, nor with a nervous system or an apparatus, not with a consciousness and data of consciousness, nor with stimuli and motor responses. Psychology can be defined as a branch of knowledge dedicat- ed to the study of experiencing beings in so far as they are experiencing beings. This definition preserves the continuity with prescientific think- ing and acting, which has been interrupted ever since the attempt was made to establish psychology as a science. In everyday life, experiencing is taken for granted. Is is never debated that experiencing alone makes possible interpersonal relations and communication. Everybody realizes that through observation, demonstration, and communication, science itself owes its existence to experiencing. In short, nobody ever doubts that experiencing beings as such are in a unique relation to their world. Experiencing, not as an abstract entity but as a capacity of man and animal, is appraised as an incomparable endowment ; it is respected as a formidable reality. Modern psychology, however, is proud of having risen far above this level of non-scientific, « medieval » belief. Even when the phenomenon is acknowledged, its reality is denied. Experienc- ing has become a mere phantom. In 1900 Freud wrote in his Interpretation of Dreams, « What role is now left, in our representation of things, to the phenomenon of consciousness, once so all-powerful and over-shadowing all else ? None other than that of a sense-organ for the perception of psychic quali- ties. » " A few years later Watson made the final, extreme step ; he denied the very existence of consciousness, for which he could not find any proof 13. Before Watson started the movement of Behaviorism Pavlov 12. The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud, New York, Random House, Inc., 1938, P. 544. 13. Watson's statement is a classical example of a «contradicho in adjectu » ; for a proposition and the statements proving in logical sequence the correctness of its meaning are not physical things. There is no place for proofs in the realm of physical things. They are neither true nor false ; they simply are. Whoever speaks about proofs speaks at the same time, by implication, about experiencing and thinking beings.</page><page sequence="21">694 Erwin W. STRAUS had already formulated his ideas of objective psychology, where a ner- vous system acted upon by stimuli takes the place of the experiencing being in his relation to the world. In a short time Objective Psychology gained wide popularity and - with some modifications - has for a long time retained it despite its radical and patent deficiencies 14. Powerful motives must be at work to make such a destructive trans- formation of the familiar aspects of the world acceptable. The history of Western philosophy tells us what they are and where they are rooted. Passionate metaphysical partisanship is willing to pay the highest price, to tolerate inconsistencies, to ignore deficiencies, and to coerce the phenomena into the Procrustean bed of the theory. Objective psychology and many other schools of contemporary psychology are late stages of a long development which began centuries ago. Since Descartes' metaphysics man, the concrete living individual, has ceased to be - in theory - the subject of experiencing. A thinking substance, the « res co gitans », took his place. It was this incorporeal substance - detached from space and motion - which underwent the mutation to « consciousness ». In the course of time it gradually lost its substantiality and degenerated into an « epi-phenomenon », a lofty « no-thing ». To the unreality of this consciousness - the end product of a long chain of metaphysical metamorphoses - to this consciousness « once so all-powerful and over-shadowing all else » Freud opposed the 14. The deficiencies are radical because they are the unavoidable consequence of the principle of the theory. They become patent whenever the rules of the game set by the theory are strictly observed and the phenomena fully explored and respected. Com- munication is an example, one of many. Two experiencing beings can meet each other, converse together, observe together the same thing. Two nervous systems cannot do anything like it. Two brains cannot communicate, neither by direct nor by indirect methods. While we, my neighbor and I, watch together the same events my brain and his brain - or to be more correct Brain A and Brain B - are activated by different stimuli. Physical agents are turned into sensory stimuli that moment when they bring receivers into activity. Physical agents turned into stimuli act upon the individual nervous system, which in its function remains separate and isolated from any other. We cannot share stimuli. It is loose talk to call light, sound, and heat, stimuli, still more to use this word for visible and audible things. But this confusion is absolutely necessary to hide the weakness of a theory that substitutes nervous systems for experienc- ing beings. Objective Psychology which uses observation, demonstration, and communi- cation cannot account for its own existence.</page><page sequence="22">THE SIGH 695 assumed reality of the unconscious and of the energy-charged Id. Freud's idea of the unconscious was the exact counterpart of the mummified concept of consciousness, this derivative of Descartes' metaphysics. In substituting an apparatus for the experiencing being and thereby consciousness for experiencing, Freud followed the tradition which in all its turns is dominated by the Cartesian dichotomy of mind and body. The truth, however, is that experiencing is still as « all-powerful and over-shadowing all else » as it always has been ; it will remain so as long as men and animals exist as individual organisms. To reach an understanding of expressive motions one has to be careful not to confuse experiencing with consciousness and to see to it that a mind, a nervous system, an Id, does not take the place of the living experiencing being. To regain the genuine theme of experiencing we will have to remove the historical debris under which it is buried at present. When this will have been done the solution of the theoretical problems of expres- sion will be relatively easy, the paradoxes will disappear, and principles for a systematic order of expressions will offer themselves, as I will show in another paper.</page></plain_text>
