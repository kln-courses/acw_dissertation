<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLATO'S THEORY OF FORMS IN the first part of this article5 I confined myself to the ethical sciences, where we should naturally expect Plato to subordinate exact number in its more literal sense to value-norms. At any rate there is so far as I am aware no hint in the dialogues themselves that such things as justice and temperance any more than likeness or otherness are numbers in the sense that the phi- losopher aims to find a specific mathematical equivalent-after the Pythagorean fashion-as their "form". There remains one further and important group of forms of which the same results may not be true. I can best lead up to this however by considering first another problem that was earlier mentioned and postponed-what, namely, Plato intends us to understand by the Good as the most fundamental of the forms. Among all the forms this is the one which it would be least easy to reduce to number, since number according to Aristotle is itself derivative and cannot therefore be used to define the more ultimate principle or principles which generate it. Assuming that it is somehow to this ultimate nature of reality that the concept of the Good applies, there are two ways in which we might set about describing it in the light of what has hitherto been said. If reality is a system, then the Good might be identified with the unity of system itself, the totality of rational order. Or it might be thought of in terms of some principle which system logically presupposes and on which it depends-as the One in its distinction from the Whole.57 There seems no reason why the two interpretations should be incompatible, and in fact one may very well imply the other; nevertheless they represent a difference of emphasis at least. That Plato does at times intend to identify the Good with the first interpretation seems probable,58 though the evidence in no case perhaps is entirely beyond dispute. It appears to be implied in the general doctrine of the Timaeus; here the Creator's goodness shows itself in fashioning the world after the pattern which ' This Review XLIV 5I5. "7Cf. Met.

XLV. eternally exists, and such a pattern explicitly contains within it- self the ideal complexity that is reproduced in the actual universe. About the famous passage in the Republic one can speak with somewhat less assurance, though there is nothing to bar the same interpretation. The fact that it is the Idea of the Good which sup- lies the philosopher with his concrete pattern for ordering the state is evidence in its favor. So likewise are various other statements: that the aim of the philosopher is to become a part of the divine and immutable order of the universe; that the goal of thought is the intercommunion of studies in their mutual affinities; that thought involves the correlation of the sciences to one another and to true being; that the dialectician is one who has a conception of the essence of each thing in the scientific sense.60 On the other hand, when we are called on to "abstract and define the form of the Good", or to look at it as a first principle through which mathe- matical hypotheses are reconstructed to meet the needs of dialectic, it is the second alternative that might most naturally seem to be suggested.6' And here it is time to begin to take Aristotle's testimony into account. According to Aristotle, Plato found the source of all reality in the union of two ultimate principles-the One and the Indeterminate Dyad; and it is with the first of these that the Idea of the Good would appear to be connected.62 The meaning of this doctrine is of course debatable; perhaps we may best approach it through the philosophical point of view sketched briefly in the Philebus.63 Here also "reality" appears as a compound of two factors-the class of the finite, which is the "offspring of the 59 39de, 46c, 68e, 69c. 60 500d; 53 id; 537c; 534b. 61 534b, 5IHb. Just what Plato means by making the Good superior to being or actuality (oioata) is not easy to determine. The reference may be, as Burnet suggests (Greek Philosophy 232), to Euclides' identification of the Good with the One or pure Being, to which also he assigned the name of Wisdom. This not only gives a simple and intelligible sense, but it relieves us of the necessity of trying to find implied in the passage any specific theory of the relationship between Good and Being; all Plato need be thought to mean is that Being in the Eleatic sense supplies no final account of an ethically real universe. The most plausible alternative would seem to be that he is presupposing already a doctrine of the derivation of the concretely "actual" from its logico-metaphysical source. Cf. Phileb. 26d.

Now even if we grant that the Good may be thought of intelligibly in terms of an organic whole, we could still go on to ask, What makes such organization possible? The proximate answer is, in the Philebus, to be found in "measure". Measure not only stands highest in the list of goods, but it is the cause of all other good things in particular ;64 each of the subordinate goods gets its good- ness in the degree of its participation in measure. Measure, how- ever, is itself a consequence arising from the mixture of the two classes-the finite and the "more and less"-for which also there must be a further "cause". How this Cause is to be understood may be postponed a little. Meanwhile in any case we have been brought pretty close once more to the "number" theory. The infinite of the more and less is lacking in reality because, being purely relative, in itself it is nothing in particular; it becomes a possible object of thought only when through the application of the offspring of the limit it takes a form capable of being expressed in terms of definite quantity. And this is not very far at any rate from what Aristotle has to tell us when he makes number the immediate off- spring of the One and the Indeterminate Dyad, these ideal numbers being identified with Platonic forms. Now if this only meant that the orderly relationships which lend reality to the world have a close affinity with mathematics, it would be perfectly consistent with what we have found Plato constantly implying; indeed he seems expressly to say as much when in the Philebus measure and proportion as the sources of all concrete excellence are made to issue from mathematical con- cepts-equality, duality and the like.65 But doubt arises if we sup- pose that Aristotle's account is meant to carry the further impli- cation-as it seems to do-that each form in particular has its own special numerical equivalent.66 In that case the previous results will have to be reinterpreted. To meet the issue here we shall need to return to a distinction whose consideration was earlier postponed. It has appeared that there is one group of forms which Plato himself seems to imply may be describable in terms of numbers-the classes of "natural" 64c, 65a, 66a. 25a-26b. Cf. Met. A ggib9; M io84a 12-25; N iog2b io.</page><page sequence="4">64 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLV. objects. That the forms of the "elements", at any rate, are defi- nitely compounded out of numbers67 is the outcome of the am- bitious attempt in the Timaeus to generate these elements out of the fairest of the triangles; Aristotle, to be sure, held that geometry is not really reducible to number, but Plato apparently thought otherwise.68 And since it is through a combination of the physical elements that animate bodies arise, there is nothing to prevent us from supposing that these too are capable of a mathematical expres- sion.69 Now it is such natural species that Aristotle has everywhere in mind when he is considering the theory that forms are numbers. He is thinking of the natural world and sensible objects70 in the light of his own doctrine of the connection between form and matter; and most of his objections to the "separate" forms are based on the conviction that only "substances" in this sense are ultimately real, which automatically rules out the things that in the dialogues most frequently meet us as Platonic forms. If we exclude the chance that the whole account is only one of Aristotle's blunders-a possibility no doubt, but hardly to be adopted as a first resort-there are two ways in which the diffi- culty might be met. We might suppose that Plato in his later years altered his philosophical point of view by limiting the forms to classes of objects in the natural world. To this, however, there are several objections. It would, for one thing, mean so great a change that we should not be justified in accepting it without strong evidence; if beauty and temperance and justice no longer function as Ideas, then the very things are gone that everywhere evoke his deepest feelings. Certainly we should have expected somewhere some clear notice of the change. In the dialogues, however, there is nothing to indicate that Plato himself was con- scious of any such large revolution in his thought; even in his Tim. 53b, 54d. Met. A 992b I3. Cf. Theaet. I47d. if; Epinomis ggod if ; Met. io36b I3, I090b 2I. We thus should need to distinguish-as Aristotle fails to do- between the numerical essence or formula of geometrical forms and their phenomenal appearance, this last being due presumably to perception in- volving the quasi-form of space (Cf. Laws 894a; Tim. 50c, 5ia; Aristotle, Psychology, 404b I9-27.) This may be what Plato has in mind in making a difference between the geometrical method he is using, "in which the probable is combined with the necessary", and a higher method known only to God and the man who is dear to God (53d).

But Aristotle does not say that the theory of number supplanted the theory of definition ;72 this last continues to appear as a presupposition in his criticisms. And, finally, philosophical tradition makes no mention of a new departure, so that it could hardly have loomed large in the Academy. To this we may add once more the fact that in the only dialogue where Plato comes to grips with natural forms he tells us expressly that here strictly scientific thinking, in which he certainly had not lost his interest,73 will need supplementing; not only that, but even if human powers were sufficient, as conceivably they might be,74 to attain scientific certainty here, the task nevertheless would fall short of his main concern. It might in theory be possible to deduce man's animal functions from the "form" of the human organism as itself a derivative of mathematics; but this still would leave ethics and politics outside the picture. For Plato even bodily "good" comes from the activity of soul, which is prior to body and its inde- pendent master ;75 and to confine the forms to nature would therefore mean turning aside from his whole philosophy of the life of spirit and refusing it scientific standing. We are brought then to a second and somewhat easier alterna- tive. Plato's earlier concern with forms, so we may suppose, was extended by him in the days of the Academy to include a theory of those natural classes about whose right to be called forms he had at the start been not too clear; and the essence of these forms he may very well, following the Pythagoreans, have found ex- plicitly in numbers. But on such a showing it would not need to follow either that he tried to extend such an explicit explanation to all forms alike or that he ceased to call non-naturalistic objects forms; the theory of the form as number in the narrow and Aristotelian sense would be, not a rival of the "earlier" doctrine of definition, but merely a special application of it.

And if we ask how it comes about that Aristotle seems to give a different impression I do not think we shall have to look far for an answer. In the first place we need to remember that Aristotle is concerned not with Plato solely, or even primarily perhaps, but with controversies carried on among members of the Academy; these controversies take their start from the Platonic form, but Plato's views appear along with others, so that it is sometimes difficult indeed to say just what Aristotle does mean to attribute to him personally. Furthermore, Aristotle's own interest as a natura- listic philosopher lies in the application of the doctrine to a limited field. He was concerned with the form as cause-as a way, that is, of explaining natural objects and natural generation; and he rejects both the number-theory and the "separation" of the forms because they appear to him unequal to this task. If consequently Plato had proposed a theory of natural species it is understandable that Aristotle, with his special interest, should have fixed on this as the significant function of the form. But it does not follow that Plato would have agreed with him. There seems no good reason to believe that Plato ever shifted the center of his philosophy to the problem of generation; had he done so we should have expected a much more explicit treatment of the theory and its difficulties than Aristotle's criticisms indicate. What from first to last claimed Plato's attention is not causation, but order; he is engaged in the pursuit of fixity and rational assurance in the processes of think- ig76 tothen in6 to the end that he may discover settled principles for regu- lating the life of man and of the state. It is not easy to explain otherwise his lack of concern for the technical difficulties of which, as the Parmenides shows, he was well aware, and which he very likely would have conceded to critics like Aristotle. I should be disposed to think, then, that the number-theory in its narrower sense is not the equivalent of Plato's conception of the form but its application to a special subject-matter, and that in proposing to take it as an inclusive technical definition Aristotle is illegitimately subordinating the Platonic problem to his own. As a consequence he is forced to rule out certain things which we have reason to believe Plato would have called forms; what he really means is that on his own showing they ought not to be forms, though at the same time it is not denied that they were " Parmen. I35bC.</page><page sequence="7">No. i.] PLATO'S THEORY OF FORMS 67 forms for Plato. Thus for Aristotle the categories cannot be forms because they are not substances; but they do in an eminent degree perform the service which throughout the dialogues Plato re- quires of a form. At any rate there seems to be at least as sound a reason for supposing that Aristotle is thus taking a special formulation of the theory too absolutely as for supposing that Plato has without notice recast his original philosophy and shifted his whole intellectual interest. I may add a few words by way of summary and perhaps of qualification. It is quite possible that Plato may himself have raised no objection to a restricted use of the word Klaos to meet the needs of a special problem, and may even at times have lent his sanction to it.77 It presumably is of some significance that the "theory of Ideas" does not stand out prominently in his later works; and even in the earlier ones, as has been remarked, elaoq is very far from having an exclusively metaphysical sense. The main facts would seem to be explained if we suppose, then, that the doctrine took its start from Plato's recognition of the need for a scientific un- derstanding of the principles embodied in the human and social virtues to which the Socratic dialectic had called attention. Such a need might in a broad and rather abstract way appear to be met by the notion of eternal essences or forms. But for actually carry- ing out his program he was bound to find himself led into fields where "kinds" and "definition" cease to be wholly adequate to his purposes-to the logical analysis of the knowledge-process, to the fundamental "categories", to the ultimate metaphysical source of order or measure in the universe. Since all of these are relevant to the demand for intellectual certainty he could still on occasion continue to call them forms. But it would not be surprising if there also was a tendency to set rather apart from these the specific kinds or species which actual scientific procedure in the form of classification aims to discover,; and once this happened the problem of "natural kinds" was, with the growth of a naturalistic interest, on the way to assume a special importance in the Academy. Otherwise it would not perhaps be quite easy to explain how it was that Aristotle felt himself justified in so limiting the field of the Ideas. Meanwhile this still leaves it open to suppose, once more, that in the looser sense in which number stands for measure, ratio, " Cf. Tim. 5Ibc.</page><page sequence="8">68 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLV. proportion, the mean, Plato himself meant to assign to number, interpreted in terms of an ultimate mathematical logic, a consti- tutive role in all scientific thinking and so in all the "forms", though in practice he continues for the most part to give to mea- sure an interpretation that is primarily humanistic.78 Meanwhile this much at least is true, that in the "natural kinds" we come closest to the residual problem which bulks so large in Aristotle's criticisms, and about which Plato has himself so little comparatively to say. The method of pure dialectic may lead to a system of inter-participating forms of which it is ideally possible we might give a specific logical account. But Plato has no similar plain account to render of the further participation in these forms of natural events and things, and he never attempts any straight- forward answer to the difficulties which he himself raises in the Parmenides. "Reality" may be a comprehensive system. But, as Aristotle complains, it is a static system in a world of absolutes; and as such it offers no explanation whatsoever for anything that by definition is imperfect and relative and changing. Granting that among the Ideas the forms of motion and of generation may be found along with others, this in no way helps to bridge the gap between the changeless and the changing; the Idea of motion no more moves than does the Idea of rest, and it no more accounts for motion in an alien sphere. As a matter of fact Plato explains actual movement in an en- tirely different way-as the work, that is to say, of soul; it is the essence of soul that it is self-moving, and since it is the only thing that has this power, from soul all motion whatsoever, original and derivative, must spring. This is a difficult doctrine which, one might think, ought to have given Plato more trouble than it seems to have done. Since soul can be defined, and logically derived, a "form" of the soul will be present in the ideal realm ;79 but the form of self-motion no more than that of motion is itself in move- ment. To fulfill its function soul must not be an essence merely but a substance, as indeed it plainly seems to be for Plato.80 Aristotle with his more conventional conception of number will not grant that ratio, even, is consistent with the number-theory.

One has to do with our logical right to accept the substantial reality of souls and still talk of what is ultimately real as "essence". Such a question Plato does not raise; apparently he recognizes that the forms must be supplemented'before we can pass from static being to even the appearance of change, and he is a good enough em- piricist to accept the only agency he can discover without exami- ning its credentials too minutely. The fact remains, however, that we seem left with realities of two different orders juxtaposed to constitute the intelligible universe-soul which moves itself and other things, and the Ideas which are absolute and changeless. The other problem has to do with the nature of the changing world itself and of that relationship of participation which in this world holds between the particular object and its form. This is a problem in which, as I have said, Aristotle displays a much keener interest than does Plato-a fact that seems to indicate, once more, that it was of secondary importance for Plato's main ob- jective.8' Incidentally he does, however, drop a few hints more or less relevant to the problem, which he might perhaps have followed up if his interest had been stronger. Mostly these are in connection with a special aspect of phenome- nal existence which does concern him as an ethicist-the problem of evil. In a general way a definition of evil is directly implicated in the theory of forms. In the "real" universe there can be no evil, for reality is system, order, and order is in its own right good and fair. It follows that the nature of evil will need to be identified with disorder, discord, the absence of measure, and this is where concretely Plato finds it; motion is irrational and bad when it is irregular and disorderly,82 and it is everywhere the disorderliness of the vicious life and of the vicious state that leads him to con- demn them.83 But of course this leaves the ultimate problem still untouched. We may object to disorder as evil when we come across it, but why should we come across it? If reality is perfect order why should it ever give rise to anything different from itself? "Aristotle tells us that Plato left the nature of participation an open question. Met. A 987b I3. Polit. 273a-d; Tim. 30a; Laws 898bc. Cf.

Why should the phenomenal world with its imperfections exist at all? There are two rather obvious suggestions we may find in Plato, on somewhat different levels. Most explicitly he accounts for evil as the work of evil souls.84 Motion, it has appeared, is due to soul; and since God can only be the cause of good,85 we must suppose that the disorder of the actual world has its source not in him but in imperfect finite creatures. And empirically of course such imperfect beings not only do exist, but they go in point of fact a long way toward accounting for the concrete facts of human evil. And now we may take a further step. A soul cannot be evil in so far as it participates in the reason which is divine. Its badness must have a different cause, which can only have its locus in con- nection with the body through which man is a part of the un- substantial world of matter. Proximately, at any rate, it is the body to which are due the irregular motions which disturb the serenity of pure reason and result in the aberrations of sensation and physical desire.86 Not that matter as such is bad. But when it is out from under the control of mind, as happens not only in the vicious life but in other natural processes as well, it offers an un- avoidable and fertile field for the evil of disorder. We can hardly stop here, however; for a philosophy such as Plato's finiteness itself is in dispute, and we have no right to assume the existence of finite things in order to account for the consequences of finiteness. By postulating inferior souls we have freed God from the taint of evil. But it still remains to ask how the natural world itself gets any standing, so as to offer material from which the evil in souls can spring. The most immediate reply would seem to be that particularity and manifoldness, and so evil, are a corollary of the reality of not- Being or of the Indeterminate Dyad.87 And logically the conception of an indefinite continuum of more and less does leave us with an irrational remainder after the limit of definite number has been 84Rep 6I7e; Tim. 42e; Laws 896de; 897bd; go4bc.

If it is to serve its purpose not-Being or matter must be, apparently, in some sense itself a thing, an actual substratum. It must have, that is, a nature which is more than the logical nature of an ideal category; and we should have accordingly still to ask what that nature is. Whether Plato himself would have assented to such a conclusion may be open to question. But if he does, we shall probably find his answer in a final suggestion in the Timaeus, where the phenomenal world seems to get its explanation from a curious kind of pseudo- form-the notion of empty space.89 This, however, looks a good deal like an attempt to ride two horses at once. At least space is a form of an unusual sort, and its peculiarity will have to be explained and regularized before a philosophy such as Plato's started out to be can very well rest satisfied with it. And in any case it will hardly serve its purpose as the domain of particularity and motion except on the assumption that space is not just a form but a quasi-substan- tial entity as well; and in that case reality is not merely a dualism of form and soul but has a third dimension also irreducible to either. Meanwhile Plato's recognition of the fact of evil calls attention to one qualifying point about the forms to which I have already made an incidental reference. It is clear that the word ENo has for him no special metaphysical sanctity; he uses it in many ways that carry no direct significance for ultimate theory, and because things form a "class" it does not follow, therefore, that the class must needs have true existence in the ideal world. In other words, I think we shall need to recognize an implicit distinction between forms that are merely instruments of judgment and forms that ' Phileb. i6de. Taken by itself this might perhaps be interpreted in a purely methodological way, as standing for the residual unrationalized matter on which it is the business of science perpetually to encroach. And it may be that in point of fact this is the underlying truth in Plato's doctrine as reconstructed by the modern thinker. But that it was consciously in Plato's own mind I should say is highly dubious; in particular, it fails to take account of the "logical realism" which better than any other term seems to me to characterize Plato's metaphysical point of view, and which the present philosophical generation should find it easier to appreciate than any previous one. a 5od, 5ia, 52ae.

Evil and madness fix terms for human discourse, but they lack that internal harmony which makes of them true verities; the object of definition is "real" only when it bears the imprint of orderly system. For modern science it no doubt is true that the lowliest and most apparently chaotic pro- cesses of nature would to a sufficiently enlightened vision reveal the precision of quantitative law. But to such a faith there is little ground for thinking that Plato has attained, and his aesthetic prepossessions very likely would have led him to reject it if it had been put before him. At any rate, definition will need to meet certain tests before it is taken seriously by the philosopher. Thus it is doubtful whether Plato means to allow a standing to the quasi-scientific forms of bile based vaguely upon color; and he definitely denies scientific character to the different varieties of odor.90 We probably would have to say accordingly-this is what his whole account of the scientific method of division goes to show -that not all possible classes are rationally significant, but only such as represent the natural lines of cleavage into species and sub-species based on some essential attribute.9' It is true Par- menides tries to make Socrates admit that his principle ought logically to lead him to accept the forms even of amorphous and unpleasant things; and it has more commonly been supposed that Plato accepts this as a valid extension of his doctrine. But it is equally possible, and I think more plausible, that the passage is meant as Parmenidean irony, intended rather to cast doubt on the Socratic view than to justify the conclusion drawn.92 There remains one problem of peculiar difficulty about which something will need to be said in conclusion; and to make a start I may return once more to the Philebus. Up to a point, as was previously remarked, the doctrine of the Philebus is strongly sug- gestive of the account which Aristotle gives of Plato's meta- physics. That the "more and less" of the Philebus is the Indetermi- nate Dyad of Aristotle seems pretty clear; the generating Limit is presumably the One; while the "class of the finite" may without 90Tim 83c; 66d f. 91Phaedr. 265e f.; Rep. 454b f.; Theaet. 208d; PoWt. 262b-263c, 285b, 287c; Soph. 267d.

One thing remains, how- ever-the "cause of the mixture"-which- does not appear in Aristotle's scheme. This can hardly be the One; the One is a logical principle, whereas the Cause seems clearly to be thought of as the mind which informs the universe, or God. What then is the place of God in Plato's philosophy? I should not be prepared to deny dogmatically the possibility that Plato intended in the last resort to locate the forms them- selves as active principles in the mind of God, or that at any rate an occasional passage might be thought to point to this.93 But it is certainly not what we should gather ordinarily. Even when in can- vassing various theories of the forms. Plato raises the issue of God's knowledge94 this appears as knowledge of an independent real and not as "thought that thinks itself"; and if Aristotle had been aware of a doctrine so similar to his own it is hard to see how he could have failed to make some reference to it. Nor is there anything in the Philebus to support such a contention if we bear in mind two things. Plato does not here propose an ulti- mate logical analysis; he connects his discussion rather with the familiar convictions of religion and with earlier philosophies as they fall in with these,95 and what he is trying to do is to account concretely for the nature of good in our actual world as a mixture of the finite principles of measure with the class of the infinite. For this mixture he finds the effective cause in a God who orders the existing world and, as soul, is the source of motion and genera- tion in it. But this points clearly to a being like the World-Soul of the Timaeus, as a living compound of mind and body.96 And meanwhile it does not follow that the last word may not still belong to logic; as a matter of fact this is what even in the Philebus is implied. God is the author of concrete goods by imposing measure, but he is not said to generate the class of the finite which renders such goods possible, and which is spoken of rather as the "off- 98 Cf. Sophist 247e, 248c-249a, where, however, Plato is thinking of the knowable universe rather than of an ultimate logic, and where it is implied that the identification of being with power, introduced for polemical pur- poses, may need to be reconsidered. 9 Parmen. 134. 95 8cd, 30d.

Nevertheless, as we know from the Re- public, the mathematical concepts need themselves to be derived; and if therefore Aristotle tells us how he did derive them there is nothing in the Philebus to prevent us from accepting his testi- mony. If we could stop here there would be no serious trouble; a cosmic soul patterned after an independent ideal order offers no great difficulty once we have admitted that such a thing as soul exists. And all that Plato has to tell us about God, with one ex- ception, can be understood, and for the most part needs to be un- derstood, in such relatively simple terms appropriate to religious feeling. The exception is the doctrine of the Demiurge in the Timaeus. If we are to take this doctrine as it stands we shall be called on to accept two Gods-a created God, the World-Soul, and an ultimate Artificer to whose creative activity the reason em- bodied in the universe is due; and this presents some unexpected complications. Now to begin with, it is plain we should not be safe in taking the account of creation in the Timaeus too literally as history; it represents rather a rational analysis given the form of myth or story. What it is easier to overlook is that, of the two Gods, it is the first which we have the least right to dismiss as mythical. That Plato took his World-Soul seriously I think it would be difficult to deny; it plays too important a role in his philosophy. As regards the Demiurge, however, the case is not so clear. As a Creator he would have on Plato's usual terms to be a soul. But actually he never is so spoken of; on the contrary, soul first comes into being through his creative power,98 unless indeed we are to suppose that in some obscure way soul presupposes itself as its own creator. At any rate in Plato's account there is nothing to suggest this; here the logical generation of soul from the Same, the Other and Being apparently is intended to define its essence. Furthermore, we know from Aristotle that Plato found his ultimate source of logical gene- ration in the One; and the One cannot be a soul or its whole func- tion in terms of a mathematical logic would disappear. The alterna- tive would be, accordingly, that the "intelligible" God is only a 97 25d.

Certainly he seems otherwise to occupy a some- what anomalous position; if the One and the Indeterminate Dyad are sufficient to account for essences or forms, and if the World- Soul serves all the purposes of religion and an earthly Providence, there seems no obvious need to interject a further term. And in point of fact it is the logical function which apparently is left after we have gotten rid of what is plainly myth. Under the latter heading pretty obviously will come the anthropomorphic touches which represent the Creator as sizing up his task and thinking out the way to its accomplishment, as free from envy and so moti- vated by the wish to make everything as good as possible, as exer- cising a moral will superior even to the bonds of logic, as follow- ing up in serial order the various steps in the process of creation, as addressing his commands and explanations to the lesser gods. Even the fact that God is represented as possessing Mind has no need to mean more than that the final structure of reality is logical or rational; indeed this is implied in Plato's definite limitation of mind as thought or knowledge to created soul.99 And it is in ac- cordance with this that the creative activity most plainly attributed to him appears to be everywhere of a logical or mathematical na- ture.'00 It is only in this way that it seems easy to account for one peculiar feature in particular which contradicts directly Plato's usual explanation of the source of motion-the original state of chaos and disorderly motion prior alike to the imposition of order and to the creation of soul, and to all appearance independent of the Artificer.101 Such a postulate is mentioned too frequently to be set down merely as a verbal infelicity; unless therefore we re- gard it as a reference to the potentiality of motion and disorder inhering in the Indeterminate Dyad I do not see exactly how it is to be explained. At arty rate it seems a possible hypothesis, and on the whole perhaps the least objectionable one, that the highest God is just the mythical expression of a faith that somehow a mathematical logic is capable of generating both the natural world and the divine soul whose self-movement explains natural pro- cesses for our less ultimate human understanding. 9937c, 46d. 100 Cf. 3ia, 3IC-32C, 35ab, 68de, 69c. 101 3Qab, 53ab, 6gbc.</page><page sequence="16">76 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLV. A special word needs to be added about God's "goodness", which raises a question that requires answering in any case. It is usual to say that Plato's universe is teleological, and in some sense this is plainly so; but in what sense are we to understand such a statement? Teleology is just a word for an abstraction-rational agency or meaning; the more important question still remains: What is the nature of the good end which God or the Universe pursues? Is it "happiness"? Apart from other difficulties, this would at best confine the good to sentient beings. Is it merely an expression for the "argument from design" as an explanation of man's structure, and his organic environment, through a reference to his needs? Plato undoubtedly subscribes to this, although as was earlier remarked, and as is frequently in evidence when he comes to carry out the explanation in detail,102 biological needs are made subordinate to the rational needs of mind; but he certainly did not suppose that the universe looks to mankind for its mean- ing.103 Is it only a vague something hidden in the dark recesses of God's mind, so that we are released from the necessity of defining it? Or is it, as I think, precisely in the last analysis that system of mathematically determined relationships which it is man's good to recognize and to live by? In this last case the goodness of the Demiurge might be simply, and presumably would be, the per- sonification of the logical structure of reality which defines the nature of the good, formulated not in terms of metaphysics but of the traditional wisdom of the sages.'04 There is one aspect of Plato's treatment of the form which has- made no appearance in the previous discussion, but about which I ought perhaps to say a word in conclusion. I refer to his so-called mysticism as a motive in his development of the theory of Ideas. It has been the outcome of the whole preceding exposition that Plato's fundamental interest throughout his life is a professional interest in science and scientific logic as a basis primarily for poli- tics or statesmanship. It is true also that philosophy represents for him a way of life, and beyond all comparison the highest and 1 Tim. 69c ff. 1 It is to be noticed that this particular job is turned over by the Demiurge to the created gods, who alone therefore are the natural objects of "religion". 4ib-d, 42de, 6gc. 104 29e.

The philosopher finds his own blessedness in the realm of true being-in the Idea; the contemplation of its per- fect beauty thrills him and calls forth his love and devotion. And in so far it might be said to possess a touch of mysticism, in the degree that any strong feeling for a value of whatever sort lends itself to an emotional and so in a loose sense to a mystical experi- ence. But distinctively mysticism always has meant something more than this, though what it means it is not perhaps an altogether simple matter to define. Let us assume, after the fashion of some mystics, that man's blessedness is attained through "reason". Such a statement is equivocal, however; concretely in experiential terms it might have two quite different meanings. Reason may be thought of merely as the path which man needs to follow to a goal that, once attained, leaves the process of ratiocination behind; or it may be an intellectual activity which as such is the condition of the highest satisfaction for the thinker. Now in the case of the true mystic it is the first of these goals at which he aims; the end of philosophy is not science, but a state of being where the clear distinctions of the intellect lose themselves in ecstatic feeling. Was Plato a mystic in this latter sense? If we except two dialogues-the Symposium and the Phaedrus -I have tried to show that the mass of the evidence points the other way. There is a sense in which the Platonic goal might be described as "contemplation". But it is an aesthetic contemplation of the rational order of the universe itself; only such a concrete intellectual content is relevant to the practical motive-the social motive in particular-by which Plato's whole philosophical ac- tivity is guided. Meanwhile there are passages which go to indi- cate that it is not so much contemplation even in this aesthetic meaning that Plato identifies with man's highest good as it is the actual work of scientific thinking;105 typically indeed, from the relatively early Meno to the Laws, it is science rather than a pas- sive contemplation of the results of science that appears as the object of the philosophic quest and as the philosopher's reward. There remain it is true, as I have said, two dialogues, and the Symposium more particularly, where the natural interpretation 105 Cf. Republic, 485-6, 54oab; Theaet. I73e, I75c; Tim. gob-d.</page><page sequence="18">78 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW seems to point to a mysticism of the more distinctive sort. But before we attribute this to Plato the possibility at least exists that he is speaking not in his own person but in that of his predecessor Socrates-a possibility for which I believe a good deal of concrete evidence may be found, though I shall not attempt to dwell upon it here. It is hard to see, for instance, how the goal of philosophy as a scientific understanding of the world fits in very well with the genuinely mystical ideal of philosophy, attributed to Socrates, as something not to be attained in any natural existence but only when death has released us from the body and translated us to a higher realm of being.106 So too in the Symposium it is worth noticing how Socrates takes his start from human love and not from partial knowledge; on the road to a more inclusive love science does enter an appearance, but it appears as a particular stage rather than as the underlying method present in every stage alike.'07 It is not altogether clear how we are to identify the scientific ideal that aims at sharply defined objects of intellectual comprehension with this notion of the Good as an eternal pos- session of the soul, an emotional beatitude wherein the meaning of human good and love and beauty come immediately home to feel- ing; at any rate if we try to attribute to Plato himself the double motive we shall have to reinterpret rather drastically most of the evidence that seems plainest, including all that we owe to Aristotle.
