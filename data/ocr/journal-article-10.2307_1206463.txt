<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Divine Purpose in On Religion* Neal K. Keesee / Episcopal College Preparatory, Baton Rouge, Louisiana In this article, I will clarify Schleiermacher's understanding of the divine purpose in the editions of On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers.' His apologetic program in the Speeches everywhere presupposes purposeful divine activity. He precedes his famous definition of religion (to accept everything individual as a part of the whole and everything limited as a representation of the infinite) with a telling assertion: "The universe ex- ists in uninterrupted activity and reveals itself to us in every moment."2 * I delivered an earlier version of this article to a session of the Schleiermacher Group at the American Academy of Religion annual meeting, New Orleans, November 23, 1996. I wish to thank all those who listened and responded to my presentation that day. I also wish to thank B. A. Gerrish for reading an earlier version. SI will draw primarily on the first (1799) edition, with reference to the two later editions when interesting revisions or additions are pertinent. I cite G. Ch. Piinjer's critical text, Ueber die Religion: Reden an die Gedildeten unter ihren Verachtern (Brunswick: C. A. Schwetschke, 1879), as Reden. It includes the 1806 and 1821 revisions in footnotes. Translations are from the two English translations, which I also cite, Richard Crouter's of the 1799 text (Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), and John Oman's of the 1821 text (New York: Harper, 1958; reprint, Louisville, Ky.: Westminster/Knox, 1994). These I cite as "Crouter" and "Oman," respectively. 2 Reden, p. 57; Crouter, p. 105. In 1806 and in 1821, Schleiermacher revises his definition of religion. The final version reads: "To take up into our lives and to submit to be swayed by them, each of these influences and their consequent emotions, not by themselves but as a part of the whole, not as limited and in opposition to other things, but as an exhibition of the Infinite in our life" (Reden, p. 59n.; Oman, p. 48). In the first edition, Schleiermacher rarely uses the word "God" (Gott), instead favoring the language of "deity" (Gottheit) or, as in this case, "universe" (Universum). This should not be understood as a denial of God but, as Crouter explains in the introduction to his translation (see pp. 57-66), as part of Schleier- macher's argument in the first edition that a theism that sees God existing outside of the world represents but one way in which we can intuit the universe religiously. By "universe" Schleiermacher means not simply the physical universe but the whole of things understood organically, given existence, direction, and unity by an inhering divine causality which is a higher, but not external, unity beyond the oppositions of finite things understood individu- ally. The universe acts on us in each individual occurrence, and if we perceive this reli- giously, as a part of a whole, we will intuit the divine or infinite: the unified, purposeful causality within each finite occurrence (see, e.g., Reden, pp. 56-61, 88-89; Crouter pp. 105, 116-17). In the later editions this becomes clearer as he replaces or accompanies much of the "universe" language with references to God. Thus in the 1821 edition he asks, "If you see the world as a Whole, a Universe, can you do it otherwise than in God?" In responding ? 1998 by The University of Chicago.

Toward what end is the divine activity moving? In various places he intimates a divine purpose, but the refer- ences are usually quite brief and vague,3 leaving us with an elusive but tempting vision of what God is doing in the world. A careful examination of the various editions dissolves this elusiveness, yielding a single, consis- tent vision of the divine purpose. In the first half of the article, I will demonstrate that the Speeches contains an apparently humanistic concep- tion of the divine purpose: God seeks to develop in individuals an uncon- strained self-activity and a concomitant open receptivity-Schleiermach- er's notion of lively freedom-in order to contribute to the redemption and moral perfection of humanity.4 Nevertheless, I will go on in the sec- ond half to argue that ultimately the divine purpose in the Speeches is the self-manifestation of God.5 to suspicions of supposed pantheism and atheism, he also says, "I leave it to you to say whether the World can be conceived as a true All and Whole without God" (see Reden, p. 122n., 135; Oman, pp. 94, 103). In "Schleiermacher's Post-Kantian Spinozism: The Early Essays on Spinoza, 1793-94" (Journal of Religion 74 [1994]: 476-505), Julia A. Lamm pro- vides a useful discussion of the relation between God and the world, calling Schleiermach- er's worldview an "organic monism." Examining his critical appropriation of Spinoza, she shows how, for Schleiermacher, the infinite "is found only in the totality of the flux of things finite," yet it contains the "essence and existence" of the finite (Lamm, pp. 487, 489-90). 3 The most extensive is a stirring but vague passage late in the second speech, which consists of six sentences in the German text. See Reden, pp. 104-5; Crouter, pp. 126-27. E S. G. Sack, Schleiermacher's ecclesial superior and the official censor of the first edition, was an early critic of the clarity of the Speeches, calling its language "bombastic" and saying that it "cloaks itself in enigmatic darkness" (Sack to Schleiermacher, winter 1800-1801, in Aus Schleiermachers Leben in Briefen, ed. Wilhelm Dilthey, 2d ed. [Berlin: Reimer, 1860-63], 3:279, trans. Albert Blackwell as "The Antagonistic Correspondence of 1801 between Chap- lain Sack and His Protege Schleiermacher," Harvard Theological Review 74 [1981]:115). 4 In the Speeches, Schleiermacher rarely uses religious terms such as "redemption." In- stead he speaks on a more general level of the "progress of humanity." He speaks of moral perfection mainly in the Soliloquies (Berlin and New York, 1988). The state of freedom that constitutes this progress of humanity is integral to both redemption and moral perfection. Schleiermacher takes pains in the Speeches to distinguish between religion and morality, and it is this distinction that separates the Speeches from the Soliloquies. While ethics focuses on the individual and the process of self-development, religion focuses on the whole, on seeing the individual only as a part of the whole. But however real this distinction between religion and morality is, they do not act distinctly; they are interrelated. Without the freeing vision of religion, our moral self-development would be impeded by our own lack of perspective. On this, see Reden, pp. 34-52, 72-75, 108-14; Crouter, pp. 97-104, 110-11, 128-32. 5 In discussing Schleiermacher and divine purpose, I should make clear that his concep- tion of divine purpose differs strikingly from traditional anthropomorphic notions. Schleiermacher rejects the idea of a deity who has intentions and then works the divine will on the world through means and ends or final causes. For him, the phrase "God seeks" would be a regrettable, if unavoidable, anthropomorphism. This is because of his under- standing of God as living, as an undivided, entirely productive, yet purposeful absolute causality. He discusses this issue most clearly in The Christian Faith (Der Christliche Glaube; 406</page><page sequence="3">The Divine Purpose I. THE PROGRESS OF HUMANITY TO LIFE The Ideal of Lebendigkeit In many places in the text, Schleiermacher describes ideal individuals, those he calls higher representatives of humanity (see Reden, pp. 5-10, 98-99; Crouter, pp. 81-83, 123). These individuals unite in an ideal way the "primal forces of nature," the impulse "to establish itself as an individ- ual,"6 and the impulse of fearing to stand in isolation against the whole, so that they are self-active in a balanced sense. That is, they act out of themselves, out of the uniquely combined causal forces that form their own individually evolving characters, but only out of selves made whole by an open, yet individual, receptivity to the interconnected world. This receptivity gives them the perspective to assimilate widely from the world and thus to broaden themselves so as to act in a unified way and not simply react out of one part of themselves. This is freedom in Schleiermacher's particular sense of the word. The Speeches clearly testi- fies to his belief in a total causal determinism, both within the world and between God and the world.' But individual freedom as he understands it is compatible with this; the free individual acts not in an absence of necessity but out of a unified self unconstrained by isolated streams of hereafter CG) (Berlin, 1830/31), ed. Martin Redeker, 7th ed. (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1960), translated as The Christian Faith (hereafter CF), ed. H. R. Mackintosh and J. S. Stewart (Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1928). God is an absolute unity, and thus "the divine thinking is the same as the divine will, and omnipotence and omniscience are one and the same" (CG, 1:291; CF, pp. 220-21). God does not "act" on resolves with a final cause "in mind." Rather the divine purpose lies in God's entirely free and self-active nature; such a being, as the absolute causality of all things, depends on nothing outside the universe as a means to an end. Everything is a realization of divine causality, a product of God's necessary, outflowing self-expression. God's very nature is a necessary self-impartation, and the divine purpose is this divine activity itself. The teleology of divine causality must be seen, not in the forming of discrete intentions, but in its perfectly realized self-activity, in which "divine omnipotence in all its livingness reveals itself everywhere in the world" (CG, 1:309; CF, p. 234). See Reden, p. 123; Oman, p. 95; and CF, secs. 36-37, 54-55, 109, 168. 6 This is Oman's rendering of "sich als ein Besonderes hinzustellen." A more literal trans- lation would be "to represent itself as a particular." See Reden, p. 5n.; Oman, p. 4. These two impulses, reworded, are the two elementary forces of expansion and attraction, or activ- ity and receptivity, that Schleiermacher describes in the first edition. Compare Reden, pp. 5, 8; Crouter, pp. 80, 82. 7 For examples, see Reden, pp. 98-99; Crouter, pp. 122-23, where Schleiermacher de- scribes the world as a vast, interconnected realm of reciprocally determining causality, a "vast interaction where nothing movable is moved by itself alone and nothing moves only itself"; Reden, pp. 45-46n.; Oman, p. 35, where he tells us of the place of each in the whole and of the world as "mutually conditioned necessity," and Reden, p. 123n.; Oman, p. 95, where he describes God as the "universal, productive, connecting necessity of all thought and existence." 407</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion causal necessity. Thus in an addition made in 1821, Schleiermacher de- scribes the inner unity of the self-the sum of feeling-out of which we may freely act, rather than being constrained to react by momentary, indi- vidual causal forces: "From this inner unity, action springs of its own ac- cord, as a natural branch of life. As we agreed, activity is a reaction of feeling, but the sum of activity should only be a reaction of the sum of feeling, and single actions should depend on something quite different from momentary feeling. Only when each action is in its own connection and in its proper place, and not when, dependently and slavishly, it corre- sponds to one emotion, does it exhibit, in a free and characteristic way, the whole inner unity of the spirit" (Reden, 73n.; Oman, p. 59). This uni- fication of the spirit is only possible through the "universality of sense" given in the religious intuition of all individual things as parts of a whole and all limited things as representations of the infinite. Only this intuition of all things as alike parts of a necessary whole frees us from a contracting focus on individual things so that we may incorporate all things into an inner unity.8 Through religious intuition, individuals become aware both of the necessity of all others and of their own unique part in the whole, and they are thereby freed from the limitations of both their own preju- dices against others and from isolated external influences to unify the necessity of the universe in themselves in a unique way. They may then act freely out of this unique character, and not simply react in a con- strained way to individual causal influences, so that their actions freely and characteristically express the evolving characters they have forged out of the necessity of the universe.9 The result for each is an active life aware of its dependence on the rest and thus eager to shape the world not in its own image but out of its particular embodiment of the ideals of humanity that all share, out of an intuitive connection with "infinite humanity." Empowered by the reli- gious intuition of the whole in all its infinite variety, such individuals may freely appropriate an immense diversity of perspectives, knowledge, ide- als, and the like, until they become "a compendium of humanity; in a 8 See Reden, pp. 68-69; Crouter, p. 109: "Only the drive to intuit, if it is oriented to the infinite, places the mind in unlimited freedom; only religion saves it from the most igno- minious fetters of opinion and desire." See also Reden, p. 187; Crouter, p. 167. 9 Freedom for Schleiermacher does not mean the rejection of causal necessity, but of con- straint by that necessity; it lies in how we confront the necessity in our lives, so that he can speak of necessity "taken up in freedom" (Reden, p. 63n.; Oman, p. 51). This freedom from constraint he contrasts with simple free will, the power of choice, which all too easily is enslaved to narrow desires. On this, see Reden, pp. 15, 71-72n., 150; Crouter, pp. 87, 144; Oman, p. 58; and Uber die Freiheit, in Kritische Gesamtausgabe (KGA), pt. 1: Schriften und Entwiirfe, vol. 1,Jugendschriften, 1787-1796, ed.

He invests this adjective with a technical meaning that describes the actions and characteristics of these free and creative exemplars of humanity. His technical use of leben- dig and Lebendigkeit (vitality or "livingness") describes a quality of exis- tence in humans the evocation of which (as we shall see) works out the divine purpose. Schleiermacher uses a number of terms to describe the distinctive qual- ities of ideal selves, all of which elucidate the technical meaning of the term "living." As we have seen, living individuals are self-active (selbsttdtig), existing freely out of themselves-determined from within their unified selves and not by any one impulse. Schleiermacher generally uses the term to describe expressive activity, as in one "active through his own power ... performing a calm action that must proceed from its own source." 12 But living self-activity is closely linked to a similarly free recep- tivity. Thus "living" also describes an alert, inward, original receptivity, as in those "who, without themselves bringing forth works of art, are never- theless touched and seized by everything that strikes their intuition." The living are the opposite of those who exist in blind imitation of others, who in religion passively "stammer a few inappropriate words that are not their own." Instead, their religion is "free as soon as it lives and goes its own way. As soon as the holy spark flares up in a soul, it expands into a free and living flame that draws sustenance from its own atmosphere (Reden, p. 152; 10 Reden, p. 102; Crouter, p. 124. For a sense of the power of this experience of identifica- tion with the whole, consider Schleiermacher's description of the fleeting moment of reli- gious intuition, out of which we are to exist for self yet in the whole: "It is immediate, raised above all error and misunderstanding. You lie directly on the bosom of the infinite world. In that moment, you are its soul. Through one part of your nature you feel, as your own, all its powers and its endless life" (Reden, p. 55n.; Oman, p. 43; my emphasis). " Reden, p. 8; Crouter, p. 82. I am indebted in this discussion to Albert Blackwell's mas- terly Schleiermacher's Early Philosophy of Life: Determinism, Freedom, and Phantasy (Greenville, S.C.: Scholars Press, 1982). There he makes use of a tripartite classification, itself derived from Schleiermacher, of Schleiermacher's understanding of freedom from constraint which summarizes the active and receptive quality of the existence of the living self quite helpfully. Under the general rubric of freedom as freedom from constraint and not from necessity, he discusses freedom as appropriation, in which the self appropriates the diverse influences of the world in a unique and thorough way, freedom as self-cultivation, in which the self develops and broadens to match in its integrity the new influences, and freedom as self- expression, in which the self gives unconstrained expression to this broadened self. See esp. part 2, chaps. 3-5, 7. '2 Reden, p. 74; Crouter, p. 111. 409</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion Crouter, pp. 144-45; emphasis added). It can do this because it is "spon- taneously (selbsttdtig) and vivaciously (lebendig) implanted in them" (Reden, p. 195; Crouter, p. 172). Being selbsttdtig, they are not, as we have seen, undetermined, but they act out of their distinctive appropriation and cul- tivation of necessity, and thus out of an inner, conscious purpose, a cre- ativity that, far from being crushed by fate, incorporates and responds creatively to the rule of necessity. Other related concepts Schleiermacher uses in describing the living in- clude wholeness, originality, distinctiveness, complexity, and connected- ness. Thus, they seek to act "with the whole soul" (ganzer Seele) and to perceive others in their undivided uniqueness (Reden, pp. 168, 158; Crouter, pp. 156, 148). The living self is original (urspriinglich) and charac- teristic (eigne, eigenthiimlich),'3 so that every "living, original movement" in life begins in a moment of appropriating religious intuition that is origi- nal and not derived (Reden, p. 55n.; Oman, p. 43). As we saw above, free self-activity exhibits, "in a free and characteristic way, the whole inner unity of the spirit." The living is also complex, as through the process of self-formation the individual seeks to include all things in itself. When active and living in the mind, religion makes "everything into an object for itself and every thought and action into a theme for its heavenly imag- ination" (Reden, p. 151; Crouter, p. 144). The living self is thus inherently conscious of its interconnection with the "ornately connected and inter- twined" whole in which "nowhere do you find something simple" (Reden, p. 91; Crouter, p. 118). The more aware of its connectedness, the more complex, rich, abundant, and growing the self is. It exists self-consciously as a dependent part of an interconnected, intricate, living, and directed whole, which elicits original, creative contributions from self-active, culti- vated individuals who are themselves unique products of that whole. These contributions of the living join in the movement of the whole to- ward greater life, so that, in the organic development of the universe, "nothing shall be a dead mass that is moved only by dead impact and resists only by unconscious friction. Everything shall be its own assem- bled, much intertwined, and elevated life" (Reden, p. 105; Crouter, p. 126). Throughout the Speeches, Schleiermacher opposes in this way the tech- nical sense of "living" to an equally technical use of the term "dead" (todt). With "dead," he describes the mechanical, as opposed to the organic, that which exists as an isolated, externally motivated part. A "dead mass" lacks the internally grounded purposeness of the living; it, as we have just seen, '" Oman translates eigne and eigenthiimlich as "characteristic," though "distinctive" is per- haps more reflective of what is unique in the evolving character of each. See Reden, pp. 73n. and 270; Oman, pp. 59, 234. 410</page><page sequence="7">The Divine Purpose "is moved only by dead impact and resists only by unconscious friction"; it is "captive to weight and in so far dead" (Reden, pp. 105, 88n.; Crouter, p. 126; Oman, p. 67). "Lifeless mechanism" goes together with the "slav- ish sacrifice of everything characteristic and free" because the mechanical has its source immediately outside of itself rather than in an individual intuition of the universe (Reden, p. 180; Crouter, pp. 162-63). In this externally motivated, mechanical, passive, one-sided, and uniform exis- tence, the distinctive freedom of vitality-livingness (Lebendigkeit)-is lost in slavery to dead forces, so that those who exist in this way merely con- tinue in a narrow way the chains of necessity around them without any living appropriation, cultivation, and expression of their own: "Everyone is a slave who performs something that should be accomplishable by dead forces" (pp. 214-15; Crouter, p. 187). Schleiermacher does use the term "dead" to denote simply inanimate objects-sheer physical, inanimate matter. But he also clearly intends by it a certain quality of existence, a lifeless imitative passivity characterized by the external motivation of inanimate matter, into which individuals may fall, just as they may, through a self-formation made possible by intuition of the infinite, be- come internally determined and truly "living." The Divine Purpose: The Progress of Humanity to Life The product of living individuals is the progress of humanity toward greater and greater life and perfection. This occurs through their media- tion of the infinite. They strive "to awaken the slumbering seed of a better humanity," so that the climate of humanity will improve to nourish the nobler plants of improving human capacities (Reden, pp. 10, 103; Crouter, pp. 83, 125). They do this awakening by the distinctive activity that gives their individual impress to the whole. For that activity, as it expresses the uniquely cultivated and appropriated necessity of the whole, manifests the infinite, which all must intuit to become more living. We have seen that higher life requires a religious intuition of the infinite, an awareness of all things existing as parts of the whole. The living convey the infinite to others by displaying in themselves the variety of humanity. The variety of humanity is a recurring theme in the Speeches, and it is especially prominent in the pages, late in the second speech, where Schleiermacher discusses humanity as a source of religious intuition of the universe. Humanity and its history provide the supreme source for intuiting the universe, ranking above nature and the mind. If religion is to accept everything individual as a part of the whole and everything limited as a representation of the infinite, then that which most clearly brings the finite world to us in all of its diversity yet shows us that it is a whole so that we may glimpse the infinite represented in it, is what will 411</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion help us in religious intuition. To have religion, we must intuit all things, including ourselves, as in a world, as part of a whole. It is humanity that supremely provides this intuition, and the continual activity of the uni- verse upon us is in vain if we stand aloof from humanity.14 To intuit the infinite and thus to gain that freeing vision of our interconnectedness that allows us to develop our self-active freedom and become living, we should have the diversity and unity of humanity displayed to us. Through it we will discover that all things, including ourselves, exist only as parts of an interconnected whole, that all things represent the divine in vari- ous ways. Schleiermacher spends several pages late in the second speech re- minding the cultured despisers of the uniqueness and importance of ev- ery individual for the whole, that all, even "small souls," are "necessary supplements to the perfect intuition of humanity." Each, no matter how common or uniform, has a moment for which it was created when "through the close approach of a higher being or through some sort of electric shock" it is raised out of itself and attains the pinnacle of what it can be, displaying its uniqueness. The unique worth of each lies in this, and when we consider things not in individual isolation, but each in its connected place, we begin to see how each in their moment of unique creativity enriches our picture of the universe, giving life and fullness to the whole.'5 If each part of humanity enriches, giving life and fullness to the whole, then it must be through its livingness, however small, that the develop- ment of the universe advances. For "living and significant features arise even where genius [of humanity] merely tests its colors or seems to sharpen its brush" (Reden, p. 95; Crouter, p. 121). But while each in the countless multitude provides a small reflection of the whole, the living- those who have cultivated themselves until their personality embraces the whole of human nature-provide the richest revelations of humanity and thus of the infinite that it represents. These "higher representatives of 14 See Reden, p. 94; Crouter, p. 120. It is important to note that, although we are dis- cussing individuals, community is of crucial importance for Schleiermacher. The process of enlivening can only happen through interaction with others, and more remotely, with all of humanity. This is quite clear in this section of the second speech, as it is in the fourth speech, on religious communities. 15 Reden, pp. 96-98; Crouter, pp. 121-22; Oman, p. 74. At the very beginning of the Soliloquies, Schleiermacher gives us a very personal example of this enlivening: "May my feelings here intoned be an accompaniment to the melody within yourselves, and may the shock which passes through you at the contact with my spirit, become a quickening impulse in your life" (Monologen: Eine Neujahrsgabe [1800], in KGA, pt. 1, vol. 3, Schriften aus der Berliner Zeit, 1800-1802, ed. Giinter Meckenstock [Berlin and New York: de Gruyter, 1988], p. 5; trans. Horace Leland Friess, as Schleiermacher's Soliloquies [Chicago: Open Court, 1926; reprint, Westport, Conn.: Hyperion Press, 1991]), p. 9. 412</page><page sequence="9">The Divine Purpose humanity strike the one or the other melodious chords that require no outside accompaniment," The "harmony of the universe, the wondrous and great unity in its eternal work of art," is a kind of "lively diffusion," the mediation of the living between infinite humanity and the limited individual, the busy scattering of "the emanations of those in whom light and truth dwell independently so that they penetrate some people and illumi- nate the surfaces of others in a brilliant and striking manner" (Reden, pp. 98-99; Crouter, p. 123, emphasis added). Those who possess vitality so completely that they are higher representatives of humanity are rare, but the quality they possess-living self-activity-is that which in anyone produces a characteristic revelation of humanity. Each, insofar as they are living in this way, can be a "higher being" for another's rise to the highest pinnacle of her existence. The quality of living self-activity in anyone serves as an illuminating spark to help bring the intuition of the whole of humanity, and thus through it of the infinite, to others. And as we have seen, this helps to develop living self-activity in them, spreading further and further creative vitality and its humane products. It is precisely in this enlivening of humanity, in advancing human prog- ress, that the living work out the divine purpose in the world. The prog- ress of humanity to greater life through the diffusive vitality of individu- als is integral to the teleology that Schleiermacher intimates. We can infer this from various comments he makes. The deity realizes its eternal thoughts, he says, in the eternal play of the two impulses (to self and to whole), which the living self incorporates not into a bland equilibrium but into "a living union," fruitful and productive. Without this creative taking up and expressing of the two primal forces of nature, "the final purpose of nature would be wholly thwarted."'16 Those who combine the two impulses more fruitfully and express them in the world with the be- nevolent, progressive result of increasing life are sent forth by the deity as translators of its will: "By their mere existence such people prove them- selves to be ambassadors of God" (Reden, p. 9; Crouter, p. 82). Schleiermacher's descriptions of the grander perspective of the march of humanity to perfection in history reflect even more clearly the connec- tion of the divine purpose with the progression of the human race to life through individual vitality. He considers history the highest object of religion and so as a rich source for the intuition of the infinite. Religion sees in humanity's progress in history-what we have seen to be a result '6 Reden, pp. 4, 7n., 7; Crouter, pp. 79, 81; Oman, pp. 5-6. In 1799, Schleiermacher speaks in this passage of the final purpose (der Endzweck) of nature being thwarted by bland, unfruitful equilibriums of the two forces. In 1806, he makes some alterations and additions to this passage, including the substitution of the phrase "will of the deity" for "final purpose of nature." 413</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion of individual vitality-"one of the great actions of the universe" from which it seeks to "divine the spirit in which the whole is directed" (Reden, p. 102; Crouter, p. 124). History, then, when seen through the eyes of religion, can tell us something of God's purpose. What appears in looking at history is that humanity is the material of "the greatest work of art ... that the universe forms directly" and that, as we have just seen, the har- mony of the universe, its eternal work of art, is precisely the scattering of the emanations of those who possess light and truth "independently," so that eternal humanity is created and represented in the most varied way.17 The divine artist takes humanity as its material, forming through the nec- essary movements of the whole free, cultivated, living individuals who enrich the representations of the whole available to all and so spread their spark of life to all of humanity. As we consider history through the eyes of religion, we are impressed with the interconnection of all things hu- man, and, losing sight of individual stature, causality, and existence, we see revealed the divine necessity and glimpse the character of all the changes and advances of humanity. Schleiermacher reveals the telos of nature and history to be the evocation of life as he describes human his- tory moving forward in a great redemptive work of love to raise humanity from dead mass to exalted life: While intuiting a universal relationship . .. there then appears to you the form of an eternal destiny ... if you then compare the isolated striving of the individual ... with the calm and uniform progress of the whole, you see how the lofty world- spirit smiling strides across all that tumultuously opposes it. ... If you finally want to grasp the actual character of all the changes and all the advances of humanity, religion shows you how the living gods hate nothing as much as death, how noth- ing but it shall be pursued and overthrown, the first and last enemy of humanity. The vulgar, the barbaric, the misshapen shall be engulfed and transformed in an organic development. Nothing shall be a dead mass that is moved only by dead impact and resists only by unconscious friction. Everything shall be its own assembled, much intertwined, and elevated life. Blind instinct, unthinking habit, dead obedience, everything indolent and passive-all these sad symptoms of the asphyxia of freedom and humanity shall be annihilated. The work of the moment and of the centuries points in this direction; that is the great, ever-continuous redemptive work of eternal love. (Reden, pp. 104-5; Crouter, pp. 126-27) This passage contains the single greatest insight into the divine purpose in the Speeches. A high point of the second speech, it shows God directing history to the evocation of the vitality or "livingness" of freedom and cre- ativity, of individual life lived in the context of the whole and not in iso- lated striving against it. This passage ties together many of the themes 17 Reden, pp. 175, 99; Crouter, pp. 160, 123. In 1806, Schleiermacher changes "universe" in the first passage to "deity" (Gottheit). 414</page><page sequence="11">The Divine Purpose we have been examining. Insofar as individuals temper their impulse to individual self-activity with the religious intuition of the variety of hu- manity and their place in it, they can become truly free and use their free will to pursue their own nature. Freely appropriating, cultivating, and expressing the necessity of the world around them, they are fully alive, acting creatively and giving to the world a distinctive product of their individuality. This product in turn serves to help spread the spark of their vitality to others, who intuit the whole through their unique representa- tion of it and can in turn blossom in individuality. Through this growth of life, individuals are the material of the great divine work of redemptive love. Both in the individual and through the individual in the whole of humanity, God works for vitality, that death, the foe of humanity, be van- quished. II. THE DIVINE PURPOSE: SELF-MANIFESTATION This redemptive evocation of "livingness" in creatures is indisputably the telos of human existence in the Speeches.'18 As this is the work of the world spirit-the redemptive work of eternal love-it also realizes the divine purpose in the world.'9 The living cultivation of an individual's character- istic determination and the resulting progress of humanity fulfills the di- vine purpose. The question remains whether this rather humanistic end is the single divine purpose simply in itself. Is, finally, the redemption or perfection of the human race the single divine end? Schleiermacher rarely mentions teleology in an overt way. But if we read between the lines of the Speeches, regarding the work and its implications as a whole, asking some reasonable questions and drawing some logical conclusions, we have to answer this question negatively. Why, for instance, is the evoca- I8 Richard Brandt sees a twofold meaning to history as Schleiermacher interprets it in the Speeches: the individual combination of the forces of the whole and the general progression to life: "On the one hand, there is the value of the ever-recurring individual combinations of the forces comprising the whole. On the other hand, there is the progressive organization of 'death into life,' of a dull and sensual humanity into the active possessor of the freedom which alone gives man worth in the eyes of religion. This twofold meaning of history indi- cates, I believe, a twofold ideal for conduct: first, as we have said, to manifest the individual nature of the universe, as actualized in any single person; and second, to share in the task of abolishing the inert and the dead, of organizing the world for the ends of freedom." While these two strands are certainly present, they are not in reality separate. As we have seen, the individual's manifesting of the forces of the universe accomplishes the progression of life. See Richard Brandt, The Philosophy of Schleiermacher: The Development of His Theory of Scientific and Religious Knowledge (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1968), p. 141. ~9 To the best of my knowledge, Schleiermacher uses the term "redemptive" (Erldsungs- werk, literally, "work of redemption") only once in the Speeches, at the end of this stirring passage describing the work of the centuries pointing to "the great, ever-continuous re- demptive work of eternal love" which is the evocation of life (Reden, p. 105; Crouter, p. 127). Thus the state of higher life is redemption. 415</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion tion of life valuable, why is it something for which God acts? Why is it, and the freedom, complexity, and activity it includes, the telos of history? The implied answer is, Because in their redeemed activity, living selves manifest the infinite variety of God who is the very definition of life.20 The perfection of the human race through its progress to life is a concom- itant part of a single divine purpose: the manifestation of the living God. The evocation of life involves the redemption of individuals and the prog- ress of humanity. From the perspective of concrete human experience this is what is accomplished in history, and it is from this perspective that Schleiermacher mentions teleology. He never says in the Speeches that the divine purpose is self-manifestation. But neither does he say the divine purpose is simply redemption. What he says is what we have just seen, that history moves forward in a redemptive work to the evocation of life. To ascertain the single divine purpose, we have to draw out the implica- tions of what Schleiermacher tells us of God, the world, and the individ- ual. Since God is an absolute unity, a continuous causality above all oppo- sitions and divisions of the finite world, there can be no division in God; there can be but one divine purpose that encompasses all existence.2' The logic of Schleiermacher's position points to that purpose being self- manifestation. It is the single, nonreducible end that encompasses all oth- ers. In the human experience of history, God works for human redemp- tion by moving individuals to higher life. But this at once manifests God who is living. Consideration of several points will show us that divine self- manifestation must be the one divine purpose, in which individual culti- vation and the resulting progress of humanity play an integral part. Determinism First, recall that Schleiermacher sees the system of the finite world as a reciprocally intermeshing composition of finite causes whose interaction determines the outcome of each event according to causal law. This rule of necessity extends from the highest plain of celestial bodies to the inte- rior of the human soul to the workings of dead matter. This system of finite causal necessity finds its ground in divine necessity, in the inherent, absolute causality of the one, the universal, productive, connecting neces- sity of all thought and existence. The forces taken up by individuals in 20 Brandt's conclusion on this point concurs with mine: "The value of separate existence is that it makes possible the realization of individual forms-the manifestation of the perfect work of art which is the universe. Finiteness is not merely the negation of the Infinite; it is the means by which the Infinite can express its perfection, the means by which its perfect work of art is made possible" (Brandt, p. 138). 21 See Reden, pp. 56, 122n.; Crouter, p. 105; Oman, p. 94. Schleiermacher spells this out more explicitly in his dogmatics. See CF (n. 5 above), secs. 50.1-2, 53.2, 109.3, 120.4, 164.3. 416</page><page sequence="13">The Divine Purpose displaying their unique part of the whole and in raising others to life are not, then, simply the forces of natural necessity. Ultimately they are divine necessity. The characteristic contributions of living selves, which spread life to all, are finally manifestations of the "living" God. If individual free- dom is a characteristic "taking up" of the necessity that is grounded in the absolute divine causality, then we can see that a divine purpose that seeks such individuality seeks through it self-manifestation. By taking up and displaying in a unique way the necessity of the world, individuals also manifest the divine necessity that underlies that world. Divine Self-Revelation in Variety Schleiermacher actually tells us in various indirect ways that the deity seeks to manifest itself through the infinite variety of creation. In the infinite fullness, in the superabundant riches of the fecund world, he writes, the deity reveals itself, so that the universe exists in uninterrupted revelatory activity.22 As we have seen, humanity especially provides the material for the manifestation of deity. Schleiermacher describes God working ever toward unifying deity and humanity, overcoming the en- mity of humanity to itself. This process, a "scattering over the whole" of individual points "that are at once human and divine," results in the manifestation of God in all (Reden, p. 278; Crouter, p. 213). In each, the love of God is to be ignited, and each is to come to what Schleiermacher will later call higher God-consciousness: an ability to intuit the infinite in every finite experience.23 As God pours out divine powers among human- ity, as each comes to consciousness of her belonging to an infinite whole, each becomes an organ of divine abundance, her life furthering the pro- cess of manifestation. A continuous existence of higher life will manifest God in the world (Reden, pp. 279, 284, 67, 175; Crouter, pp. 214, 219; Oman, p. 55; Crouter, p. 160). The Self-Active Life and Religious Experience The symbiotic relationship of living self-activity and religious experience also demonstrates the divine purpose of self-manifestation. As I have noted, the religious experience of the infinite is crucial to a truly self- active life.24 But if the individual can transform the simple song of her 22 Reden, pp. 90, 56, 265; Crouter, pp. 118, 105, 204. 23 Reden, pp. 284, 10, 282; Crouter, pp. 219, 83, 217. See also CG (n. 5 above), sec. 60 and 1:228, 1:455; CF, sec. 60 and pp. 173, 350. 24 Schleiermacher asks, "Must you not, in accord with the eternal laws of spiritual nature, yearn all the more anxiously for the universe and strive for a self-effected union with it the more you are separated and isolated by the most specific formulation and individuality?" (Reden, pp. 119-20; Crouter, p. 135). For a sense of the limitations of self-active virtuosity 417</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion life "into a full-voiced and magnificent harmony" only in the context of the whole given through religious intuition, it is precisely in this living development of the individual that the whole can come to manifestation: self-formation gives form to the universe.25 Self-formation requires reli- gious intuition, but it is no end simply in itself. Rather, it fulfills the divine purpose by displaying what religion intuits-God-in the world. This is particularly noticeable in the mutually affective individuality of the reli- gious community. Livingness holds great importance for religious intu- ition because it enables religion to thrive in the world by ensuring that religion is genuine and original. Religion, like all things belonging to "a truly human life," must proceed from within the uniqueness of the self. Once a person's sense for the universe awakes, she must see with her own eyes and make a contribution to the treasures of religion, revealing to others the originality of the union of herself and her intuition of the uni- verse.26 Religious communities subsist in the mutual communication of such living intuitions of the infinite. These are provided not by those whose religion is external and therefore dead, but by those whose culti- vated individuality offers a living religion grounded in themselves. Within the "city of God" of the ideal religious community, therefore, lies a rich life of individuality manifesting the infinite. The citizens are living both in activity and passivity, both as they express their own unique experience of the universe and as they open themselves to that of others. Each makes her own contribution and expands herself through that of others, so that the universe comes to richer and richer manifestation in their mutually enriching development. Schleiermacher's descriptions of this process clearly show how the vital intuitions of the living manifest God in the world. Consider this one: "Each person knows that he is also a part and a creation of the Universe, that its divine work and life reveals itself also in him. He thus looks on himself as an object worthy of the intuition of the others. With holy reserve but with a ready openness he lays bare everything he perceives in himself of the relations of the Uni- verse, all the elements of humanity that take shape in him in order that everyone may enter and observe. Why should they also hide something from one another? Everything human is holy, for everything is divine."27 without religious intuition, see Reden, pp. 95, 106, 111-13, 49-59, and 51n.-52n.; Crouter, pp. 120, 127, 130-31, 102-5; cf. Oman, pp. 39-40 and 85-86. 25 Reden, pp. 113-14; Crouter, p. 132. See also Reden, p. 166; Crouter, pp. 153-54. Black- well calls this "the fundamental principle of Schleiermacher's romanticism: that only in the whole can the particular come to life, and only in the particular can the whole come to manifestation" (Blackwell [n. 11 above], p. 241). 26 Reden, pp. 151, 118; Crouter, pp. 144, 134. 27 Reden, 216; Crouter, p. 188. See also Reden, p. 184; Crouter, p. 165. 418</page><page sequence="15">The Divine Purpose The Living Self The nature of the living self shows how the manifestation of the divine is possible in it, and shows conclusively that its distinctive life is intended to manifest God. Notice that Schleiermacher says of the participant of the religious community that "he lays bare everything he perceives in himself of the relations of the universe."28 We have seen that an individual's unique, living existence arises out of the relations of the universe as they come together in that individual, that an individual's free appropriation, cultivation, and expression of the determined forces of the world results in distinctive individuality. It is only in distinctive individuality that Schleiermacher believes we may sense the universe as a whole, and thus the infinite. Without our faculty of sense, he says, "no universe is found." And what does the faculty of sense do which enables it to discover the universe? Sense "strives to grasp the undivided impression of something whole. It wants to perceive what and how something is for itself and to recognize each in its unique character" (Reden, p. 158; Crouter, p. 148; emphasis added). As we are receptive to an individual part as it is in itself and not as we, in a limiting fashion, impose our own view on it, as we perceive it as a whole, in its unique character, we find the universe in it. That individual part, perceived in its uniqueness, reveals its distinctive combination of the in- terconnected causality of the universe, and thus reveals the infinite, which is found only in the finite understood as a part of the whole.29 A thing perceived in its individuality, in its creative life, reveals not only itself but the fact that all other things are in it and it in them, and so it reveals the interconnected whole, and becomes an opening for the infi- nite. Schleiermacher says, "Look outside yourself to any part, to any ele- ment of the world, and comprehend it in its whole essence, but also collect everything that it is, not only in itself but in you, in this one and that one and everywhere; retrace your steps from the circumference to the center ever more frequently and in ever-greater distances. You will soon lose the finite and find the infinite" (Reden, p. 170; Crouter, pp. 156-57). In order to understand something as a part of the whole, and thus to intuit the infinite in it, we must see it in its characteristic, determined livingness. In order for the divine to manifest itself, living selves must be cultivated so that a unique impress is made on the forces of the whole. Thus the reason 28 Reden, p. 216; Crouter, p. 188. 29 See Explanation Five to the second speech in the third (Oman) edition, where Schleier- macher writes, "If, however, the single thing does not work upon us as a single thing, but as a part of the Whole, it will be, in acting upon us, an opening for the Whole" (Reden, p. 137; Oman, p. 106). 419</page><page sequence="16">The Journal of Religion the work of history directs itself to evoking living self-activity is, through its unique display of determined interconnectivity, to manifest the divine who is the one in the all. In the variety of individual souls given over to God, the deity "exalts itself through the inexhaustible manifoldness of forms in its entire richness" (Reden, p. 265; Crouter, pp. 203-4). God Is Living Finally, consider the fact that for Schleiermacher, God is preeminently living, the very definition of self-activity. Schleiermacher describes the finite world as a vast interaction wherein nothing is moved by itself alone (see n. 6 above). God, the infinite, is precisely that which does move itself alone, free from all external determination. Thus the ancients intuited the "ever-active, ever-living, and serene activity of the world and its spirit, beyond all change and all the apparent evil that only stems from the con- flict of finite forms." We should not, Schleiermacher tells us, consider God other than as acting, so that the divine activity on an object is the divine existence in respect to that object. He also describes God revealed in the world as "infinite fullness" and the universe as a "rich, ever-fruitful womb," which spills forth occurrences that are revelatory actions. These are images of fecund, organic outflowing, and they are entirely appro- priate to a wholly active God who as such is vitality itself, the "original source of life." God, as ever-living and revelatory activity, cannot affect us except by making "Godself" known to us. As individuals come to varying levels of self active life through intuition of the infinite, they exist freely out of themselves. In doing so, they manifest the living deity whose very nature is to make itself known in an outward flowing, absolutely uncon- strained manifesting activity.30 Recall that Schleiermacher uses the image of an artist to describe divine activity. Humanity is the material of the greatest artwork, formed directly by the deity, and the eternal work of art of the universe is the revelatory variety of humanity (Reden, pp. 175, 99; Crouter, pp. 160, 123). Schleier- macher never elaborates on this image in the Speeches, allowing it to stand 30 Reden, pp. 60, 143, 90, 56, 67, 130; Crouter, p. 105; Oman, p. 115; Crouter, pp. 118, 105; Oman, p. 55; Crouter, pp. 138-39. I have in places, following Schleiermacher, de- scribed individuals being living in their receptivity, meaning that they are free, to use Black- well's tripartite scheme, in their appropriation of necessity, that they do so unconstrainedly so that what is appropriated becomes integrated and does not dominate the self. Such an individual appropriates out of and adds to a whole self. Clearly, God is not living in this sense of receptivity. In applying this analogy to God, God is already completely whole, and neither appropriates nor cultivates, but only expresses. But the identification of self-activity or freedom with life still applies most truly to God. God, unlike all others, is completely free, and completely expresses Godself in the single divine activity. God, in the one divine mode of self-manifestation, always exists out of self, whereas creatures, in their various modes of existence, do so ever only partially. 420</page><page sequence="17">The Divine Purpose alone to intimate his meaning. But in On Freedom, he discusses the work of the human artist in a way that helps us to interpret this image as he uses it in the Speeches. He understands the artist to be presenting her entire character in the artwork, out of creative necessity: "Once we have determined the artistic worth of a piece of work, we are quick to assign the result of our judgment to the artist. Boldness of composition, strength of execution, refinement of feeling, precise observance of relationships in harmony, chiaroscuro, and perspective: all this we ascribe to the artist. The entire character of the artist is thus presented, enticing us to wonder. However, are we on this account any less convinced that it could not have been any other way, given the situation and capabilities of the artist? In fact we do accept this consideration."'3 The human artist presents herself entirely in her work, as a product of the necessary forces of situation and capability within her. Though the human artist will have imperfections and varia- tions that are inappropriate to the divine, this image succinctly evokes the creative, active, and living notion of God that Schleiermacher holds and shows that the very nature of the deity must be to present its living charac- ter in the world. The divine artist-the living God-presents Godself in the artwork of the universe through the outflowing of necessity, through God's entirely active character. The living God produces living selves in the eternal artwork of self-manifestation. Redemption versus Manifestation But could not the divine revelatory activity be understood as entirely for humanity, so that God's single purpose would be simply human redemp- tion? As we have seen, Schleiermacher does describe the revelatory activity of the infinite as a redemptive work of love, aimed at raising all to higher life. Certainly the manifestation of the infinite in the finite is the re- deeming of individuals, and so of humanity. But the redemption of the individual always has a context that points beyond it to the manifestation of God. There are two aspects to this. First, there is the fact that redemp- tion as livingness is by its very nature further activity; the effect of the infinite on an individual never stops with that individual. The result of an intuition of the divine is creative response to the divine, which further manifests God. As soon as one's religious sense awakens, Schleiermacher expects the individual to make use of this, contributing the product of his own religious experience to enrich the divine manifestation, and arousing something similar in another, so that the process continues (Re- " Schleiermacher, Uber die Freiheit (n. 9 above), p. 258; Blackwell, trans. (n. 9 above), On Freedom, p. 44. Schleiermacher develops his use of the artist image to describe God most extensively in The Christian Faith (see sec. 55 and secs. 168-69). 421</page><page sequence="18">The Journal of Religion den, p. 118; Crouter, p. 134). Thus Schleiermacher calls the inner self from whence the religious life arises the "holy workshop of the universe," and of one open to the universe through religious experience, he says, "When you observe him in this exquisite moment of human existence, he reflects the heavenly beam purely upon you" (Reden, pp. 150, 239; Crouter, pp. 144, 189). Second, we must remember that the divine activity never works for individuals or in a merely individual way and thus cannot have individual redemption as its purpose. In Schleiermacher's conception, divine provi- dence has in view neither the happiness and suffering nor the hindering and promoting of individuals, but works to "regulate corruption in great masses," to beget new creations on a scale beyond that of the individual (Reden, pp. 278-79; Crouter, p. 214). Thus, the parts through which the deity works its will do not function for themselves but only as parts of the whole, and they must be understood as such. When we look at things only individually, we see chaos, blind forces unguided by reason, and in- dividuals at vastly different levels of development. Yet taken together, we find that blind force is not left to chance in its effects; understanding directs it through invisible bonds. Individuals belong to an organic whole, a wondrous unity working artistically to spread the divine life through the characteristic variety of creation (Reden, p. 99; Crouter, p. 123). If the divine purpose is not directed at individual redemption, could the redemption of humanity as a whole not be its telos? In considering this question we must remember Schleiermacher's efforts in the Speeches to curb anthropocentrism. As a Christian theologian, he is inevitably an- thropocentric in that he understands God as working to redeem human- ity.32 Insofar as he draws on concrete human religious experience rather than speculation to describe the meaning of history and the divine pur- pose, he can only discuss it from the perspective of the human experience of redemption.33 From this perspective, God acts to redeem, and God's purpose in spreading life must appear to be simply the redemption of hu- manity. 32 He appears to sympathize with the cultured despisers who count things a part of the universe only to the extent they come into connection with humanity: "I do not," he says, "wish to lead you beyond this point of view" (Reden, p. 94; Crouter, p. 120). 3 Schleiermacher discusses his method in the Speeches very little, but a pervasive theme is that things in general and God in particular are known only in their activity on us. If God's activity redeems us, then, from our concrete religious perspective, God is redemptive. In The Christian Faith, he will carefully and explicitly develop this method, which builds dogmatic propositions not out of speculation but strictly out of the data of the Christian religious consciousness. He discusses this issue and its application to the question of divine purpose in sec. 164.2: "It is therefore only within the compass of our own world that the divine government is known by us-within the sphere, that is, in which redemption makes its power felt" (Schleiermacher, CG [n. 5 above], 2:442; CF, p. 724). 422</page><page sequence="19">The Divine Purpose But the Speeches is not free of speculative content, and Schleiermacher takes care to reject the idea that humanity is the limit of existence.34 For the cultured despisers, humanity is the universe, the goal toward which their striving and action are directed. For them, human perfection is a suitable and complete telos for existence. If they believed in God, their God would work for humanity, as many suppose that God does: "To most people, God is obviously nothing more than the genius of humanity. Man is the prototype of their God, humanity is everything to them, and in accord with what they consider its events and directives they determine the dispositions and essence of their God." 35 Schleiermacher quite explic- itly rejects this way of thinking and the tendency of the cultured despisers to equate humanity and the universe. He believes humanity to be but a part of a vast universe in which many forms must exist that circumscribe humanity. "I have told you clearly enough," he writes, "that humanity is not everything to me, that my religion strives for a universe of which humanity, with all that belongs to it, is only an infinitely small part, only one particular transient form."36 It would be hard to find a more definite rejection of the kind of anthropocentrism that puts humanity at the cen- ter of the universe, the pet object of a divine activity that works through the entire vastness of the universe only in order to redeem humanity. Instead of this, Schleiermacher understands every class of beings-hu- mans and otherwise-with their individual existences, as subordinated to the universe (Reden, p. 124; Crouter, p. 136). Each individual, and the class to which it belongs, is finally but a part of an organic whole moving to one end under divine direction. An awareness of this context of the redemption of humanity, of the limited place that humanity fills in the universe, confirms for us that as each individual becomes living, her re- demption must contribute to the single end of displaying the divine life in creation. 4 Just how speculative Schleiermacher is in the Speeches is debatable. Certainly his general tendency is against speculation, and he takes strong exception to Fichte's Idealism in the second speech. Yet he does conceive of a speculation that is tempered by intuition of the infinite. See Reden, pp. 49-52; Crouter, pp. 102-4. Blackwell remarks that the 1799 Speeches contain a good deal more speculation than Schleiermacher was later comfortable with. See Blackwell, pp. 123-24. 35 Reden, pp. 121-22; Crouter, p. 136. 36 Reden, p. 122; Crouter, p. 136. See also Reden, p. 106; Crouter, p. 127, where Schleier- macher gives this additional check to anthropocentrism: "Do you not sense that it is impos- sible that humanity itself can be the universe? Rather, humanity itself is to the universe as individual persons are to humanity; it is only an individual form of the universe, a depiction of a single modification of its elements; there must be other such forms by which humanity is circumscribed and to which it is thus opposed. Humanity is only a middle term between the individual and the One, a resting place on the way to the infinite, and a still higher character would have to be found in the human being than our humanity in order to relate us and our appearance directly to the universe." 423</page><page sequence="20">The Journal of Religion But what, finally, of the fact that Schleiermacher describes the divine activity that directs history to life as "redemptive love"? Surely an act so described has as its purpose the well-being of its recipient, so that to de- scribe the divine work as redemptive love indicates that the divine pur- pose is the redemption of humanity. Schleiermacher does not in the Speeches provide us with a definition of love, and it is less than prudent to assume that he means simply this by his use of the word. In fact, his use of the term "love" in the Soliloquies supports the conclusion I have reached. There he opposes love to sensitivity. Love is self-disclosing activ- ity, a pouring out of the self that expresses creative freedom. It is love in that it benefits the other by enriching her life, providing another manifes- tation of the variety of the whole which helps the other to better discern her individuality. But its enrichment of the other occurs precisely through self-manifestation.37 Certainly the working out of the divine pur- pose achieves human well-being by redemption. But that single purpose is self-manifestation. The wisdom and love of God provide us with the variety of creation, focused especially in the creativity of the living. This enables us to find and develop our own place in the streams of deter- mined causes of the world. We thus in turn contribute to manifesting the variety of life in the whole, that the world will come to new life. From the perspective of concrete human religious experience, this new life is redemption, the result of God's loving purpose of perfecting our race. But seen in terms of the unity of divine activity-in which the human, and all other perspectives-must be subsumed, that love is self- expression, and it fulfills the divine purpose of manifesting the living God throughout the world.

He describes love in the dogmatics in a similar way ("the will to be in another"), and there he applies this directly to God by way of analogy. See Schleiermacher, CG 2:445; CF, p. 726.
