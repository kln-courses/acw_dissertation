<plain_text><page sequence="1">KLAUS POENICKE A View from the Piazza: Herman Melville and the Legacy of the European Sublime literature, from its very beginnings, has developed a tonality distinctly different from that of Europe. During the last decades, a growing number of critics and historians of ideas have tried to seize hold of this elusive otherness, and to reduce it to some simple, manageable concepts. Handled with tact, key-words like "romance," "Adamic," "gothic," "symbolic," "typological," have opened fresh and promising vistas. This essay proposes an extended look from Herman Melville's "Piazza." The view from there, against a background of European ideas, might set off more sharply yet another concept helpful in exploring what is "American" about writing in America. So far, criticism has paid only moderate attention to the title story of Melville's Piazza Tales. "The Piazza" may deserve better. A simple story at a first glance, it turns out to enact, on a minor scale, a quest into the heart of the American experience. The fact that Melville added it, early in 1856 and virtually in the last moment, to a collection in which everything else was reprint, must in itself give it some weight.1 There can be little doubt that Melville meant this story to supply some larger frame of reference, some unifying point of view for what remains to this day his only major collection of shorter prose. "The Piazza" opens with a significant thematic gesture. The narrator (Mel- ville himself, barely concealed behind a mildly eccentric persona) is debating with himself on which side of his house the long-desired piazza should be built. To the east, soft uplands invite his gaze, promising at Christmas the tender white of the first snow, "the season's new-dropped lamb, its earliest fleece."2 The west offers the fresh green of spring; the south, in. May, an 267</page><page sequence="2">268 + COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES "orchard, white-budded, as for a bridal."3 Clearly enough, the tenor of these images is youth and innocence, the agnus dei-moti] mutedly in the background. But for some reason, their charm is lost upon the narrator. Braving both common sense and his Yankee neighbors' scorn, he finally decides upon the sunless north. "But, to the north is Charlemagne" - this is three times the re- frain of his meditation. "Charlemagne," however, is Mt. Greylock, the highest mountain in Massachusetts, the same mountain, moreover, to which Melville four years earlier dedicated one of his most ambitious novels, Pierre. But if Pierre comes back to mind, so do the earlier novels that culminate in Moby Dic'. For the most striking aspects of the mountain are presented through the parallel metaphor of the sea: In summer, too, Canute-like, sitting here, one is often reminded of the sea. For not only do long ground-swells roll the slanting grain, and little wavelets of the grass ripple over upon the low piazza, as their beach . . . but the vastness and the lonesomeness are so oceanic, and the silence and the sameness, too. . . .4 The story prepares for its climax when one day the narrator discovers at the foot of a rainbow, and shining out from the gloomy flanks of Mt. Greylock, a glittering golden roof. This thing of beauty, which so provocatively gainsays the dark truth of the mountain, fascinates him like "spying on the Barbary coast, an unknown sail."5 Invoking Spenser, Shakespeare, but also Cervantes, he sallies out to unveil the secret of that golden house, which seems to him the castle of some fairy queen. At first his path leads him through a valley saturated with mildly luminous colors: A pasture rose before me. Letting down ñvc mouldering bars- so moistly green, they seemed fished up from some sunken wreck - a wigged old Aries, long-visaged, and with crumpled horn, came snuffing up; and then, retreating, decorously led on along a milky-way of white-weed, past dim-clustering Pleiades and Hyades, of small forget-me-nots; and would have led me further still his astral path, but for golden flights of yellow-birds- pilots, surely, to the golden window. . . .• The self-styled hero of romance ignores the warnings of the mild forget-me- nots. His eyes are fixed on the "road-side golden-rods" and the "golden flights of yellow-birds" which beckon him upward toward the richest of colors, the golden roof at the foot of the rainbow. But when he leaves the securely fenced world of the valley, the road darkens. Images of sterility and death move into the foreground, warning him to strive no further after "fruitless growths of mountain-laurel." At last, in the midst of fantastic shapes of rock, he comes upon the enchanted mansion. Instead of a glittering castle, however, he faces "a little, low-storied, grayish cottage, capped, nun-like, with a peaked roof."7 And she who inhabits it, the girl Marianna, is no fairy princess but a being almost crushed and extinguished in her humanity. The knight-errant- emblematically clad in the apparel of his former voyages: yellow hat, white trousers, knees stained seagreen by the ferns- looks strangely out of place and parrot-like in this world. For the realm of Marianna is not dominated by colors, but by extremes of form, as well as by extremes of light and darkness. It is al- ternatively tyrannized by a destructive sun and by the shadow of a towering rock. The sun scorches Mariànna's house. The shadow in turn, hovering over</page><page sequence="3">MELVILLE AND THE EUROPEAN SUBUME + 269 it like Milton's Satan, "at brooding poise on outstretched wings," wipes into itself all the more mild and human tones of the scene. In this world, silence and death reign undisputed. And the narrator does not hesitate to make his escape, returning home to the security of his piazza. There he is tempted once more by the glittering view of the golden roof: But, every night, when the curtain falls, truth comes in with darkness. No light shows from the mountain. To and fro I walk the piazza deck, haunted by Marianna's face, and many as real a story.8 One might here remember a much-quoted passage in the Spectator essays of Joseph Addison. In the sequence on the "Pleasures of the Imagination" Addison discusses Locke's distinction between the primary and secondary qualities of matter, dramatizing it through the image of a knight riding out into an enchanted landscape:* We are every where entertained with pleasing Shows and Apparitions, we discover imaginary Glories in the Heavens, and in the Earth, and see some of this Visionary Beauty poured out upon the whole Creation; but what a rough unsightly Sketch of Nature should we be entertained with, did all her Colouring disappear, and the several Distinctions of Light and Shade vanish? In short, our Souls are at present delightfully lost and bewildered in a pleasing Delusion, and we walk about like the Enchanted Hero in a Romance, who sees beautiful Castles, Woods and Meadows; and at the same time hears the warbling of Birds, and the purling of Streams; but upon the finishing of some secret Spell, the fàntastick Scene breaks up, and the disconsolate Knight finds himself on a barren Heath, or in a solitary Desart.10 The parallel seems inviting because it points beyond mere resemblances in nar- rative detail, taking us close to the story's deeper theme. Of course Addison is only one among a score of writers of his time fascinated by the scientific dis- coveries that were rapidly changing man's outlook on the universe. Even more than Locke, Isaac Newton seems to have engaged the contemporary literary imagination. For generations after, Newton attracted poets and writers not only as the new law-giver to the universe, but also by his experimentation in optics. It was he who unveiled the secret of the rainbow, reducing its multiplicity of colors to the unrefracted white glare of the sun. As Marjorie Nicolson has shown,11 the image of the rainbow recurs in the "Newtonian poems" of the time. This has some relevance to our present concern, since Melville, too, con- stantly relates the appearance of the golden house to optical phenomena, and directly associates its deceptive lure with the Newtonian rainbow. It is the splendor of the rainbow which casts a spell over the mind of the narrator when he first discovers the house on the mountain: ". . . viewed through the rain- bow's medium, it glowed like the Potosi mine."12 The image Melville opposes to the rainbow also points directly back to the eighteenth century. A sun no less cruel than the one tyrannizing the world of Marianna already dominates the "Summer" of Thomson's Seasons. And in "Autumn" all color and nuance is destroyed by the inverted image of the sun, the equally tyrannic night: Order confounded lies; all beauty void; Distinction lost; and gay variety One universal blot . . .1S</page><page sequence="4">270 + COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Important aspects of "The Piazza" seem even more immediately prefigured by a famous passage in Alexander Pope. At the end of The Dunciad, as at the end of Melville's story, night falls like the curtain of a stage. And the first things doomed by the inroad of its reality are the colors and the rainbows: She comes! she comes! the sable Throne behold Of Night Primeval, and of Chaos old! Before her, Fancy's gilded clouds decay, And all its varying Rainbows die away. Lo! thy dread Empire, CHAOS! is restored; Light dies before thy uncreating word; Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall; And universal Darkness buries All.14 This tension of appearance and reality, of color and primal light or darkness translates itself without difficulty into a dualistic theory in aesthetics, which in the course of the eighteenth century assumed growing importance. "Color," as Marjorie Nicolson puts it, "was associated with the terrestrial world and with beauty; light radiated in books or passages devoted to the heavens, and was associated less with beauty than with sublimity."15 And she mentions gold - the color that most lures the narrator toward the magic realm of Marianna - as the purest image of the "beautiful." Nicolson's conception of the sublime as "radiant" and serene, however, differentiates it from the beautiful in degree rather than in kind. Her definition therefore points less to a radical dualism than to the possibility of its final resolution into some kind of transcendental monism, less to Melville than to Wordsworth, Coleridge, Emerson, or Whitman. Some possible precedent for Melville's more radical vision has been inferred from the epistemology of Locke and Newton. To dramatize the contrast between appearance and reality, Addison projected it into the opposing imagery of the garden and the wilderness. But we must turn to the aesthetic empiricism of young Edmund Burke in order to see this dualism expand into a much more inclusive polarity of vision. In his Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757) Burke tries to press all imagery capable of eliciting aesthetic response into one or the other of these two cate- gories. To him the beautiful comprises whatever is graceful, tamed, finite, and comprehensible - all imagery, in short, that pertains to the world of human society and order. The sublime, by contrast, relates to the imagery of vastness and power. Its experience, insofar as it is truly that, will always in its first phase crushingly overreach the physical or imaginative faculties of man. It will push him forward into that dim borderland of experience where the human is confronted by the vast and undomesticated expanse of the nonhuman. What- ever positive emotions the experience may culminate in, can realize themselves only in its second phase. Only after we have sustained the first impact of terror, can the awareness of our own aesthetic distance bring that transcendent joy of relief which, to Burke, is born from nothing but the knowledge of our own security. In the light of Burke's Enquiry (which Melville in an American edition</page><page sequence="5">MELVILLE AND THE EUROPEAN SUBLIME + 271 personally owned) "The Piazza" more convincingly reveals the dualistic ar- rangement of all its imagery, and hence a deeper unity of composition. We may now with more assurance read the image of the golden roof at the foot of the rainbow as a symbol, heightened into the ideal by optical illusion, of that fenced-in, secure world of the valley, the garden, the birds and flowers, from which the narrator sets out at the beginning of his quest, and to which he returns in the end.. Under the same perspective, the imagery of primal light and darkness, which alternately lords it over the world of Marianna, falls in quite naturally with that cluster of images upon which the narrator meditates at the outset of the story: the infinite vastness and sameness of the landscape, its oceanic silence, only broken by occasional Old Testament rages of thunder, and in the center the towering master-image of Mt. Greylock himself. At this point, in turn, the opening action more clearly proclaims its thematic intent. To say that Melville, by focussing the view from the piazza so squarely upon the dark mountain, tries to urge upon his readers' attention the "sublime" experience as such, is perhaps too simple. What he does seem to urge unrelent- ingly, however, is an inquiry into what such an experience may do to human beings. Historically considered, Melville's turning toward Mt. Greylock might at first seem embarrassingly anachronistic. After all, a full hundred years have elapsed between Burke's Enquiry and "The Piazza." By dint of compulsive repetition in innumerable gothic novels, gazing at "sublime" landscapes has become self- parodistic well before the end of the preceding century. But the confrontation of man with an 'infinite' landscape points well beyond the gothic novel and will bear a brief reviewing in wider perspective. The problem of this con- frontation seems to have seized hold of the imagination quite late, as history goes, and with surprising suddenness. David Masson's aphorism that "Shake- speare lived in a world of time, Milton in a universe of space,"16 may be over- stating the case. But historians of ideas have by now securely located the emergence of this theme in the early decades of the seventeenth century. They all relate it immediately to the destruction of the geocentric world-view through the new astronomy. The explosion of the traditional image of space and history faced writers with the task of making this new world habitable again, habitable above all for man's dislocated religious emotions. The first horror vacui was overcome when authors like the Cambridge Platonist Henry More began to consider the very infinity of space, at first so abysmal a threat, as the most "visible" manifestation of an infinite and benign deity that man could ever hope for. Suddenly, the apperception of the spatial infinite promised a religious experience of unprecedented intensity. In due course all phenomena of the terrestrial world that in any way suggested the idea of the "infinite," com- menced to share in the bid for man's newly discovered cosmic piety. To quote once more from Marjorie Nicolson : Awe, compounded of mingled terror and exultation, once reserved for God, passed over in the 17th century first to an expanded cosmos, then from the macrocosm to the greatest objects in the geocosm - mountains, ocean, desert Mountains, who to your Makers view, seem less than mole-hills do to you' are only relatively vast,</page><page sequence="6">272 + COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES yet except for the heavens they are the grandest and most majestic objects known to man. Scientifically minded Platonists, reading their ideas of infinity into a God of Plenitude, then reading them out again, transferred from God to Space to Nature conceptions of majesty, grandeur, vastness in which both admiration and awe were combined. The 17th century discovered The Aesthetics of the Infinite.'17 . The road from here to Shaftesbury, Rousseau and romantic reverence for nature has been sufficiently surveyed. The aesthetics of the infinite reached a culminat- ing point in Wordsworth's deeply pondered homages to the sublime: For I have learned To look on nature, not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes The still, sad music of humanity, Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power To chasten and subdue. And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused Therefore am I still A lover of the meadows and the woods, And mountains;18 Between this and Melville's turn toward Mt. Greylock, two generations have elapsed. Yet while the religious connotations of the experience are still a pre- vailing theme, the tone has radically changed. Instead of Wordsworth's calm serenity, we encounter restlessness, irritation, caustic irony. The narrator is disturbed by the snug passivity of modern religious experience, its detached and static quality: ". . . in these times of failing faith and feeble knees, we have the piazza and the pew."19 For the landscape, as viewed from the piazza, presents but a sequence of "picture-galleries," the mountain itself becomes "framed" as the stage of the Guckfasten-T heater. The narrator, however, seems not so much troubled by the deadness of a landscape conception which already the eighteenth century had not been able to sustain unchallenged. Rather, he suffers from a feeling of being duped by that notion of 'distance' which to all aesthetic theorists is the vital prerequisite of the sublime. This "distance," however, may pro- foundly falsify the effects of an immediate, "lived" exposure to the images causing the sublime sensation. In Melville's story, the problem of human exposure to the sublime, unmiti- gated by aesthetic detachment^ becomes the problem of a specific compositional form: the most striking thing about the view from the piazza, it may be remembered, is not the gloom of the mountains but, in the midst of them, the glittering house of Marianna. Such pictorial arrangement, however, may be directly related to the theory of the "picturesque" which through Gilpin, Price, Knight, and others achieved an enormous vogue toward the end of the eighteenth century.20 This theory principally aims at an interlocking of the traditionally opposed image clusters of the sublime and the beautiful. In this manner, the essentially unpicturesque harshness of the sublime is to be atten- uated by the grace and mildness of the beautiful. In the face of the "picturesque," however, which stresses aesthetic effect at the expense of associational and</page><page sequence="7">MELVILLE AND THE EUROPEAN SUBLIME + 273 thematic implications, Melville - as in another sense Wordsworth before him21- remains rigidly conservative. To him both realms of imagery obstinately retain their antithetical symbolic burden. What turns the glittering abode of Marianna into an obsessive provocation, therefore, is ultimately its "metaphysical" in- congruity: it pledges the possibility of a full flowering of the human in an essentially inhuman world. To test this promise, then, Melville abandons Marianna to the tyranny of Mt. Greylock. The mountain becomes for her a "total world," a form of existence that allows no alternatives. This world is thrown open to the infinite as uncon- ditionally as only the romance can permit: No fence was seen, no indosure. Near by- ferns, ferns, ferns; further- woods, woods, woods; beyond - mountains, mountains, mountains; then - sky, sky, sky. Turned out into aerial commons, pasture for the mountain moon. Nature and but nature, house and all.22 It is at this point also that the romantic quest-motif with which the story has been toying, breaks down. The narrator-hero, finding himself faced not by any Manfred, Montait, or other mortal oppressor, but by the indomitable Mt. Greylock himself, does not even think of saving the heroine. In fact, such deed of knightly valor has never been a real issue at all. If nothing else, the style with its constant drift toward the ironic and even the grotesque has indicated this from the start. It therefore barely needs Melville's black humor - when the narrator first meets Marianna, she stares at him like some sacrificial virgin on Tahiti catching sight of captain Cook - to warn us that a human sacrifice is actually about to be performed. Yet Mt. Greylock, assuming the role of the unpitying villain in the crime, finally stands but deputy for that larger and more pervasive power, the "natural sublime." What, we may ask, could have induced Herman Melville to act out this conspicuous sacrifice of his heroine to a "sublime" environment so ruthlessly and, above all, from the point of view of literary history, so astonishingly late? English literary developments in the mid-fifties, after all, had left Radclifie, Scott, Byron, and also Wordsworth well behind, and these were the times when, following Jane Austen, Dickens, Thackeray, and George Eliot were coming into their own. The new English novelists, it has been noted, again took up that "great tradition" to which the writers of the preceding century, Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, owe so much of their native strength. The con- stituents of this tradition, however, were precisely what to the American writer of the nineteenth century his own country seemed most exasperatingly to lack: a complex, richly stratified society, an inexhaustible cultural heritage, a land- scape full of castles, churches, cloisters, ruins, and historical associations. The only thing America could boast, the only thing with which, compared to Europe, destiny had endowed it to a hitherto unimagined degree, was nature, was a landscape of stunning variety and scope. "Vastness," however, unlimited spatial extent, had long been one of the most important ingredients of that aesthetics of the infinite which had assumed so significant a role in more recent European critical speculations. And the Americans- well aware of the theory as they must have been, considering how long the Scottish rhetoricians, Kames,</page><page sequence="8">274 ♦ COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Blair, Stewart, and others, had been ruling American academic life23 - did not hesitate to adapt the imported concept to their own specific national needs. In a surprisingly strong chorus of voices, the "sublime" was acclaimed as America's most distinctive birthright. Obviously the landscape painters were among the first to take up the message. This is Thomas Cole, one of the most famous among them : It is a subject that to every American ought to be of surpassing interest; for, whether he beholds the Hudson mingling waters with the Atlantic, explores the central wilds of the vast continent, or stands on the margin of the distant Oregon, he is still in the midst of American scenery - it is his own land; its beauty, its magnificence, its sublimity - are all his; and how undeserving of such a birthright, if he can turn toward it an unobserving eye, an unaffected heart.24 Charles Frazer, meditating on the future of painting in America, approaches his subject in a similar manner: If our landscape were favored in no other respect, it would be remarkable for the variety of its scenery. ... In our mountains and cataracts, our forests and lakes, our rivers and bays, our rocks and shores, the lofty and majestic, the wild and picturesque - the simple and beautiful abound. . . . The American landscape painter may be said to imbibe the principles of beauty and sublimity with his earliest perceptions.25 Here as elsewhere, the argument tends to assume the shape of a recurrent pattern. Usually, the opening constitutes a crescendo of images, by sheer force of addition overwhelming the reader with the incredible spread and variety of the American scene. In these catalogues, adjectives like "grand," "boundless," "vast," "immeasurable," "unlimited," hold uncontested sway. Once the bound- less "sublimity" of nature's gifts to America is safely established, however, the argument invariably shifts from the aesthetic to the moral and religious implica- tions: Can he [the American artist] be insensible, too, to the moral interest involved in such an obligation? His converse is with nature in her "un walled temple." He becomes, as it were, a fellow-worker with her, in her great plan of order, beauty, and harmony 26 Works of art allowed to grow out of the experience of such a landscape - and here we have Cole seconding Frazer - "sublime and purify thought." They do so because wilderness and mountain (And what nation could pride itself upon an ampler share of these than America?) still constitute the chosen places for the revelation of the divine : It was on Mount Horeb that Elija witnessed the mighty wind, the earthquake, and the fire; and heard the 'still, small voice'- that voice is YET heard among the mountains! St. John preached in the desert; the wilderness is yet a fitting place to speak of God.27 In a pioneer study of American landscape attitudes, "The Romantic Dilemma in American Nationalism and the Concept of Nature,"28 Perry Miller assigns to an essay by James Brooks the function of a national manifesto. This essay, "Our Own Country," first appeared in The Knickerbocker of 1835, an&lt;^ was soon reprinted all over America. In "Our Own Country" Brooks, amusingly enough,</page><page sequence="9">MELVILLE AND THE EUROPEAN SUBUME + 275 so intoxicates himself upon his own patriotism, that in the end, as a key-term for the national destiny, the word 'sublime' itself seems to him insufficient: There is no such scenery on earth, I verily believe, as ours. There is but one Niagara in its broad circumference ... the vast inland seas ... its boundless prairies . . . its vast havens. . . . Talk not then of Europe as the only land worth a journey over. Its past we may reverence and admire. There is sublimity in it. But the future of our own country - who dare set it metes and bounds? Who will trace it out? Sublime is but a feeble word for the destiny that awaits it29 It was Europe, as has been remarked, that supplied the aesthetic basis for this nationalistic ideology. We may note in passing that among the writers who first associated the imagery of the "sublime" with the facts of American landscape, were several Europeans. Chateaubriand, of course, is the first to come to mind. It was he who, in the two widely admired episodes from Le Natchez, Atala and René, celebrated the liberating power of the endless prairies, contrasting them to a Europe so crowded that it cramped the poetic imagination. James Brooks, for one, readily concedes this debt: "Of all the European travellers, Chateaubriand alone has done us justice."80 But decades earlier an English traveller, Frances Brooke, had returned from a visit to Canada, full of admiration for the "bold, pittoresque, romantic" ways of the New World. She, too, had tried to make literature out of her experience, and in a novel of 1769, The History of Emily Montague, enthusiastically affirmed: "Sublimity is the characteristic of this western world; and a landscape-painter might here expand his imagination, and find ideas which he will seek in vain in our comparatively little world."81 And five years earlier Immanuel Kant in far-away Königsberg had in his early, somewhat impressionistic Beobachtungen über das Gefühl des Schönen und Erhabenen rendered the crown of a "sublime" character to the original inhabi- tants of North America.82 Kant was by no means the only one to relate the sublime especially to the more primitive forms and phases of human society. A similar idea was developed by Hugh Blair. In his Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres which were highly influential in America, he insists: "The early ages of the world, and the rude unimproved state of society, are peculiarly favorable to the strong emotions of sublimity."33 And in 1786 an anonymous reviewer in The European Magazine took an American poet (William More Smith) to task for trying to engage the subtler emotions of the soul. But he amply made up for this attack on American crudeness in all questions of sensibility and manners, by comparing contem- porary America to the Greece of Homer, commending to Americans a Homeric mode of literary creation : From a country like America, where Nature sets before the eyes of the poet the most luxuriant and the most terrific scenes; where the people, yet unaccustomed to those refinements which, while they subtilize the understanding, and refine what, in modern times is called taste, cramp the imagination; we might expect wild effusions of fancy, and those nervous glowing thoughts and expressions, whose irregular beauty and sublimity sets criticism at defiance.34 It is hardly surprising that the Americans finally followed these broad hints, and converted into a blessing what had so long been a burden, by elevating</page><page sequence="10">276 + COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES the very rudeness and primitive state of their social order into an affirmation of its youthful and uncorrupted relation to the primal forces of nature. In The Raven and the Whale,95 Perry Miller has focussed attention on a battle mainly between two periodicals, Duyckinck's Literary World and Clark's Knic'erboc'er, to demonstrate that in the forties the defenders of the national "sublime" were gradually forced to retreat before the onslaught of more cosmopolitan and cityish conceptions. We may, however, begin to work our way back to Melville's "Piazza," by noting that in the early fifties the idea seems still to be going strong. As late as 1852 Putnam, the same publisher that only four years later brought out The Piazza Tales, ventured forth with a Home Boo' of the Picturesque. This was a collection of essays on American scenery which drew contributions from almost all the established authors. And it is ironically significant to find, in a book devoted to the "picturesque," Henry T. Tuckerman earnestly engaged in proving that the outstanding characteristic of the country's landscape is not the picturesque, but the sublime.86 And E. L. Magoon, in a long and rhapsodic introduction, affirms anew the intimate rela- tion between the American scene, American character, and the general harmony of the universe: To our mind, this book on American scenery has an import of the highest order. The diversified landscape of our country exerts no slight influence in creating our character as individuals and in confirming our destiny as a nation. Oceans, mountains, rivers, cataracts, wild woods, fragrant prairies, and melodious winds, are elements and exemplifications of that general harmony which subsists through- out the universe.87 One could barely miss Emerson here, even if one should ignore Magoon's title, "Scenery and Mind." This, however, seems appropriate enough, since it was Emerson who first formulated the promise of the vastness of the American scene to the creative imagination: "Yet America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography dazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for metres."88 And these are the years when in the poems and prefaces of Walt Whitman, delirious with the vastness of space, drugged upon the sheer bulk and quantity of things American, this promise is resoundingly fulfilled. Only a few of the voices evoking this new mood of American landscape piety have been presented here. They seem to make clear, however, that what- ever thematic spearheading Melville may have meant to accomplish in "The Piazza," was aimed at an immediately national target. He did not- as a hasty reading may suggest - abandon his heroine, Marianna, to a setting of histo- rical irrelevance, to the everywhere and nowhere of the fairy tale. Mt. Greylock quite concretely stands for the mountainous regions of western Massachusetts. It represents in its wider meaning precisely that unlimited landscape of the sublime, which all the commentators quoted above so loudly acclaim as the great promise of national redemption. Considered from this angle, Marianna appears to be less a figure of romance than a hard-working young woman on a mountain farm, toiling with her brother to wrest a living from a severe surrounding. Her experience, then, paradigmatically tests that patriotic promise based on the</page><page sequence="11">MELVILLE AND THE EUROPEAN SUBLIME + 277 aesthetics of the European "sublime." Our reading has shown how ruth- lessly the mountain resists being domesticated, how it thwarts all expectations of its "humanizing" influence. Therefore, if Marianna appears to us not as a human being but as a mere marionette, this is because Melville means her to be just that: the victim of an environment to which he violently denies the moral beneficence with which a Rousseau or Wordsworth would endow it. In this instance, he comes much closer to a remarkably sober passage in that romantic mountain enthusiast, John Ruskin. For at least at one point in Modern Painters, Ruskin was forced to admit that the actual life of people in mountain regions is all too often marred by poverty, ugliness, and decay.89 Melville may well have remembered the similar disillusionment experienced by his friend Evert Duyckinck. The editor of The Literary World, after climbing Mt. Greylock along with Melville, Hawthorne, Holmes, and some others, in 1851 glowingly praised the mountain's sublimity, but had to confess in the end that the inhabi- tants of the Berkshires themselves were "not sublimated or refined by this scenery."40 Historically considered, the ideology of the sublime which Melville's "Piazza" puts to the test of actual experience may contain yet a further dimension. All the commentators reviewed so far have interpreted the promise of American land- scape in the terminology of romantic reverence for nature. Let us consider one more text, an address presented in New York in 1844 by George Perkins Marsh, one of the founders of American philology. Its occasion was the two hundred forty-fourth anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrim fathers. In his book The Goths in England (a study devoted mainly to the semantic developments of 'gothic' during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) Samuel Kliger looks upon this address as a strange intellectual aberration, a curiosity in the history of ideas.41 Marsh's speech may indeed look strange, especially when viewed from the vantage point of English literary developments. Against the background of the sources aligned above, however, it appears less isolated, and possibly also less quixotic a case. Marsh simply attempts to find for the American landscape ideology some firmer mooring in the inherited intellectual and religious tradi- tions of New England. Marsh bases his argument, indirectly at least, on the idea of the translatio imperii ad Teutónicos, the god-sent triumph of the Goths over the corrupt civilization of Rome, which European Protestantism so ingeniously exploited as a préfiguration of its own task during the Reformation. For Marsh as for many earlier partisans in Europe, the victory of gothic freedom, virtue, and natural religiosity over the decadence of Rome is repeated in the reformers' defeat of a corrupt Roman Catholicism: "The Gothic mind attained its most perfect development, in the character of the great sect to which the pilgrims belonged."42 In Europe, however, the Protestant idea was diluted by com- promise. Its true inheritors, in Marsh's patriotic view, were the Pilgrim fathers. They alone managed to preserve it in its original purity, by their exodus to America. To the sterner climate, the rougher landscape of the new continent</page><page sequence="12">278 + COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES they brought the two most profound dramatizations of sublimity in literature, Milton and the Bible. In the latter, above all, they found ... the loftiest poetry, the most glowing eloquence, the most terrible sublimity, the tenderest pathos, and the most ravishing beauty, in the vision of the Psalmist and the Prophet, the promise and menaces of the old and new covenant.43 Almost imperceptibly in Marsh, the sublimity of the covenant merges with the sublimity of American landscape: . . . they who were wont to recognize the voice of God, in the dusky terrors of the wintry tempest, the bellowing of the troubled ocean, the avalanche, the torrent, the thunder reechoing from the flanks of the mountain, required not to be told that there needs no anointed interpreter between Earth's children and their Heavenly Father.44 Marsh's address opens, darkly, with a half-apocalyptic, half-biologistic vision of the inevitable doom of all cultures. It ends, somewhat incongruously, with a flourish of patriotic confidence. As long as the landscape of America retains its somber sublimity, the nation (and above all, of course, New England) will preserve its primal virtue and religious vigor, and will thus enjoy a special dis- pensation from the cultural Endzeit. Marsh's attempt to combine the ideology of the sublime with the religious creeds of the American Puritans may still, in retrospect, appear as a syncretism of some extravagance. Yet from one point of view at least, the association may not seem quite so arbitrary. We are no longer prepared to regard Puritanism only as that bête noire of a neurotic guilt consciousness, upon which Mencken and his generation tried to unload the responsibility for all frustrations and hypocrisies in American life. On the contrary, more recent scholarship has made us aware of the strong fascination which the covenant theology of the Old Testament, that predominant concern of Judaism, exerted upon the Puritan imagination.45 Thus it is not by accident that Marsh, in enumerating the "sub- lime" elements of the Bible, even as late as 1848 reserves a prominent place for the "promise and menaces of the old and new covenant." In the country's Puritan writing, the idea of an even newer covenant between God and the defenders of the Reformation heritage in America presents a recurrent theme. The drama of Exodus particularly, the flight of the children of Israel from Egypt, the years in the wilderness and the promise of Canaan, become - skillfully supported by the exegetical tactics of typology- an almost mythic préfiguration of America's own early trials and expectations. And Marsh intuitively senses what the Puritan myth shares with the romantic: a belief in the divinely or- dained preference of one people, the apostolic awareness of a special national mission. In this sense, and obviously in this sense only, a concept which sanctifies America's landscape before that of all other nations as "Nature's unwalled temple," as the hallowed place of a new revelation, may be understood as a romantic transfiguration of the older covenant idea. In this transfiguration the immediate contact between man and a personalized God is supplemented and at last supplanted by his confrontation with the depersonalized sublime of an "infinite" landscape. At this point, we may venture a final glance from Melville's piazza, facing</page><page sequence="13">MELVILLE AND THE EUROPEAN SUBLIME + 279 once more Mt. Greylock and the rainbow that promised the golden realm of Marianna. Having viewed that prospect with Newton, Locke, and the aesthetics of the infinite in mind, it might be well to recall the obvious, the fact that Melville's reading ranged far more widely than the eighteenth century. We know that, among many others, he also perused the writings of the Ameri- can Puritans; and the book which makes its presence most powerfully felt in all his writing, is the one to which all theorists accord the ultimate in sublimity : the Bible. We may hardly, therefore, consider it a coincidence that the first descrip- tion of the rainbow is given practically in one breath with a comparison that associates Mt. Greylock with the Biblical Mt. Sinai. And if Sinai is bound to bring back to memory the special covenant that God concluded with the children of Israel, the rainbow betokens his signature under that earlier and even more radically selective covenant, the one by which he saved Noah from the Flood and promised to him the revocation of the curse upon the earth: And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying . . . This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth . . . and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.46 It is this vision of a special human pact with the sublime which Melville - both in "The Piazza" and on a more complex level in his larger novels- unrelentingly questions. To him any covenant that attempts to reduce the demoniac to the manageable proportions of an anthropomorphic image, is as de- ceptive as the glitter of the rainbow that camouflages the grim facts of Marianna's world. Thomas Cole, we may remember, ended a rapturous com- parison between the national landscape and the ancient wilderness where God first made himself heard to man, with the jubilant assertion: "That voice is Yet heard among the mountains."47 Herman Melville has exerted himself as much as anybody in nineteenth-century America to seize the elusive meaning of this voice. His own decipherings have come to assume some of its very elusiveness and ambiguity. One of his most unequivocal findings, however, is stated in Pierre, a book dedicated to the same indomitable mountain as "The Piazza." That finding is summarized in one short and quiet sentence: "Silence is the only Voice of our God."48 It is no wonder then that Melville's countrymen for generations tried to stop their ears to this dark message, which in the face of romantic American landscape ideology amounted not to just a single, but a double heresy.

Richard Harter Foglc, Melville's Shorter Tales (Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 1960), p. 85, was the first to interpret "The Piazza" as "a Lockeian reflection on the doctrine of secondary attributes."
