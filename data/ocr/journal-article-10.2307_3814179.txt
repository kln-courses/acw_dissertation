<plain_text><page sequence="1">J. W. FERNANDEZ Preying Among Priests and Prophets: Oral Data in the Study of African Religion The Elicitation of Varieties of Oral Data Since the anthropologist until recently has worked principally in non- literate cultures, his material, in large part, has been oral data and his method has been directed towards greater adequacy and validity in the acquisition and interpretation of this data. In this paper I do not intend to do justice to this inevitable preoccupation of the anthropologist. Some of the salient challenges to method involved can, however, be treated by examining the use of oral data in the study of African religion, both traditional and modern. In Africa we would seem to have an illuminating arena for the discussion. The pioneering American Africanist, the late Melville J. Herskovits, always argued that religion was the "cultural focus" of African life and deserved more concentrated study than had ever been given to it. He felt there was overkill in the analysis of social structure and political systems. The concept of focus, we remember, was one of the keystones in his theoretical frame of reference. He meant by focus "the tendency of every culture to exhibit greater complexity, greater variation in the institutions of some of its aspects than in others."' Focal matters tend to dominate the lives of members of a culture. More information is available in this area of their lives and they seek more information. "Because such matters are important to them, people will think and talk a great deal about personalities, events, and possibilities lying in that aspect of culture."2 In short, the religious aspect of African Man and His Works (New York, 1948), p. 542. 2 Ibid., p. 544.</page><page sequence="2">PREYING AMONG PRIESTS AND PROPHETS life should offer the student an abundance of oral data. My own view is that this continues to be true even though the African's notion of the arena of vital interest and crucial choice is shifting rapidly from religion to politics. Educated Africans may be moving towards the models of western science (often political science) in understanding themselves and their situation, but for the vast number of Africans essentials are still explained in terms of an anthropomorphic model. "It is probably true to say, still, that he who wishes to understand many African societies must first understand their religions."3 In fact the literature yields a substantial testimony to this focal interest of Africans - if focal interest it be - although, since much of it was collected by missionaries, it may be the product of the contact of two focal interests. Much of the accumulated oral material from the African religious life is discussed and presented in languages other than English. It may be surprising but it is true that a comprehensive general discussion of African religion can be written in German employing largely German sources.4 The English speaker can take pride and reflection, however, in the work of Canon Callaway whose The Religious System of the Amazulu5 (1870) presents extensive discussion in Zulu (with English translation) by several informants called upon to explain the fine points of ancestor worship and divination. Thus Callaway, at an early date, offered us a model commensurate with the respect with which we now regard oral data. It is not often since, alas, that researchers have granted enough authority to local processes of reasoning as to present oral data directly and unimpeded by analysis. Oral data always tends to disappear in the more important theoretical observations which the foreign student has to make upon the culture under analysis. It is necessary to say that since Callaway when we are being energetically told "how natives think" the oral data which should support the observations is most often fitted in here and there in shreds and patches - if at all. Presumably it is available in field notes. Callaway felt it important enough to be the primary text of his book!6 3 Robin Horton, "Ritual Man in Africa," Africa, XXXIV (1964), 101.

Some feel there has been considerable editing on his part from the oral data - strictu sensu - to the Zulu text which constitutes his book. Another effort comparable to Callaway's, to give primacy to the direct and complete transcription of oral data, is that of William Velten (1896) in his 201</page><page sequence="3">J. W. FERNANDEZ Some distinctions are necessary. By oral data we mean that data which has been spoken or sung by informants and which has been transcribed, as a text, either directly from informants or indirectly from recordings. There is an important difference, for a recording tends to take on a life of its own and the crucial relationship between text and context which we seek to point up here may be lost. Oral data, after all, is not the only data that can be drawn from human behavior. Men in their intercommunica- tions make as much use of nonverbal channels of information as of verbal ones, and these channels are often in an important state of tension or mutual enhancement. The word testimony seems to have gained currency, particularly among historians, as a synonym for oral data. Jan Vansina finds it appropriate in respect to oral history where the informant is brought to testify to his or his people's ideas of the past.7 Whatever connotation of spontaneity and religious expressiveness may be bound up in the original French term employed by Vansina8 (also available in English of course) the primary reference in English is the situation of litigation where parties are con- fronting each other, putting their view forward in the best light, and com- peting for the judgment of some higher authority - in this case, perhaps, history. This is an appropriate usage insofar as, in the interaction of research, the informant produces not "truth" but data intended to put his own case and the case of his people in the best light. Much research, regrettably enough, has either been carried out so hurriedly or with such ulterior intent that informants have felt themselves under judgment9 and hence testifying. Our argument here, however, is that some of the best oral data is obtained when no such pressures are present in the mind of the informant, and that, in part, method should intend to gather such data and develop such situations. But the way that oral data is gathered depends upon the intentions of Swahili texts. These have been recently edited by Lyndon Harries, Swahili Prose Texts (London, 1965). Sections on festivals, spirits and burials are of importance to the student of religion.

We can make the following three distinctions in oral data as we find it in the literature: 1) Primary oral data collected relatively spontaneously, and according to its natural appearance in ongoing cultural life. 2) Secondary (elicited) oral data collected in relatively unfocused and open-ended fashion in a situation set up by the researcher. The specifics of analysis are relatively undefined. 3) Tertiary (specifically elicited) oral data collected in highly focused fashion usually in relation to a set of propositions and with the specifics of analysis well in mind. The literature yields examples of oral data gathered in all three ways. Some feel that we make progress when we move towards elicitation at the third level. But that does not necessarily hold true as I mean to point out, even though in the overall strategy of science it may be desirable to move from induction to deduction - from the abstracting of constructs to the testing of these constructs in the facts defined by them. For the student of religion oral data of the primary kind is well repre- sented in the archives, usually in those journals whose interest is linguistic. Three old German journals, for example, Zeitschrift fur Eingeborenen- Sprachen, Zeitschrift fur Koloniale Sprache, and Zeitschrift fur Afrika- nische und Oceanische Sprachen are rich sources for primary oral data, as are such contemporary linguistic media as the contemporary Journal of African Languages. Most often this primary data is in the category of folklore: proverbs, riddles, tales, legends, myths. The various genres of folklore are usually sufficiently stereotyped so as to permit of being collec- ted virtually in the form and with the content in which they occur spon- taneously in the culture. For linguistic purposes one can be assured that such oral data is close to natural speech. For the student of religion cosmogonic and genealogical myths and legends which relate to the ritual practices of pantheon and ancestral cults are of most importance. These cults may persist to the present day but myths and legends now associated with the activity often have lost considerable detail or at least have under- gone significant change. Hence these collections give us data for com- parison and for estimates of culture change and dynamics. Other valuable materials can be found whose collection, though it be for primary linguis- tic reasons, may yet yield much of value to the study of religion.10 Not 1O Very illuminating analyses of symbolism can be made by close examination of 203</page><page sequence="5">J. W. FERNANDEZ the least valuable contribution is knowledge of the special languages which make spirituality and secrecy synonymous in many African religions."l Oral data, as in the area of folklore, where collection is facilitated by frequency of repetition and relative stereotyping of form and content, is unquestionably valuable to the student of religion. It may not be of relevance to specific problems. And it is with these problems in mind that one moves up to secondary data - data which is acquired with specific problems in mind but which is yet gathered in fairly open-ended fashion. One stimulates the informant in a certain direction and then lets him talk on. Here is Callaway again. He stimulated his informants to talk upon divination and worship of the dead presumably because he felt if they were allowed to talk on, the assumptions and systematics of their point of view would be apparent. If the purposes of the inquirer interfered too much and repeatedly with their train of thought his system would be imposed upon theirs. The French School established by Marcel Griaule has been noticeably sensitive to this methodological problem and they have been especially careful students of oral data. Their method might be called the method of the "entretien" and is exemplified by Griaule in his dialogues with Ogotemmeli, Dieu d'Eau12. These inspired dialogues carried on with the blind Dogon sage over a span of thirty-three days "tie together" in Griaule's opinion "a world system ... a cosmology as rich as that of Hesiod."13 Few vernacular materials are introduced as, in the process of the conversations, the cosmology is elaborated. Most recently Madame Dieterlen has been pulling together the materials gathered with Griaule over three decades.14 We have in this work the full elaboration of the cosmogonic myth of the Dogon. It is based upon the establishment, by inquiry and dialogue, of the systematic connection between the multitude folklore; for example, T. O.

Considerable oral data in the vernacular based upon extensive open-ended conversations with many Dogon is included in the work. Madame Dieterlen describes how the materials presented - and they are presented in the most impressive detail - derive from a decision eventually taken by the Dogon to permit the ethnographers, principally Griaule, to penetrate beyond the ordinary interpretations of their life - "la parole de face" - to the "good word," the "clear word"; this is the final stage of knowledge that is only acquired by the Dogon themselves after long years of application and persever- ance.15 This was a triumph of Griaule's method. It was a consequence of his success in communicating to the Dogon unrelenting interest and respect for their view of the world. Our attention should not only be drawn to the patience and mutual respect bound up in this method but as well to the various levels of informant responsiveness at which the data can be gathered. The object of this French school is the discovery of cosmologies6 - what they call "systermes de connaissance" - and such an object seems to be best accomplished for them by patient elicitation of oral data over a long term. While their method is based upon a profound awareness of the insights available in oral data enriched by careful elicitation, it has been criticized. Two notable critiques have come from a Russian eth- nographer on the one handl7 and a British social anthropologist on the other.18 Sarevskaja, who speaks from the perspective of one with an ideological set of propositions which he is ready to test against reality, points up the "crainte de toute theorie" in Griaule - a kind of "facto- graphie" which is immune to the search for any regularity except a mythological one. "The simple passion of collecting facts fixed by ob- servation is impossible without some kind of classification."19 Richards, who discusses the difference between French ethnology and British social anthropology, states several objections to the method of the entretien. 1 Ibid., pp. 54-55. 16 In Ibid., p. 42, we are to be convinced that "Cette pens&amp;e fait de l'univers un ensemble ordonne." In Madame Dieterlen's Essai stir la Religion Bambara (Paris, 1951), we discover "une pensee religieuse qui prendrait sa place dans la philosophie de l'histoire et dans l'histoire de 1'humanite." 17 B.

W. FERNANDEZ It tends to depend too entirely on one or two minds, and philosophical ones at that, which in their extended contact with the ethnographer begin to concentrate on producing oral data which their fellows would not. And it tends to start with and rely too entirely upon the text produced by these special informants. The specificity with which problems are defined and facts classified does, indeed, change attitudes toward oral data. John Middleton has given us an impressive study of Lugbara Religion not as a "systeme de connaissance" but as a system of ritual and belief with consequences in Lugbara social life. The book proceeds from the hypothesis that the ancestor cult is a set of beliefs and actions which serve to maintain lineage authority. Oral data is gathered and analyzed to either support or refute this hypothesis. It is supported. One feels that a more determined elicitation has taken place here of the tertiary variety. In reading this book we are not as directly involved in the oral data, either in the ver- nacular or in translation as in the Griaule-Dieterlen volume. It goes without saying that oral data has been basic as in all good anthropological studies to the generalizations made, particularly in the cases of litigation, but it is not of primary importance. It does not have importance in and of itself but only as it supports or fails to support the hypothesis which has undergone extensive field examination and subsequent argumentation by reference to empirical situations. The "systelne de connaissance" being explicated here is primarily that of the ethnologist and not that of the Lugbara. Not only is the sense of relevance of oral data moulded by theoretical concerns, it has also been felt to be more relevant in some aspects of culture than in others. An examination of Henri Junod's classic ethno- graphy The Life of a South African Tribe20 is instructive here. The first volume (1912), which is devoted to The Social Life, is to a large extent a description of empirical situations of interaction with the occasional interjection of the oral data characteristic of that situation, say the formulae songs21 taught to the boys at the time of initiation. The second volume (1917), which is devoted to The Psychic Life, is more amply provided with primary and secondary oral data. This naturally occurs in the various folklore genres presented by the author but is also abun- 20 Henri Junod, The Life of a South African Tribe, 2 vols. (London, 1912-1917). 21 Ibid.. I, 85. 206</page><page sequence="8">PREYING AMONG PRIESTS AND PROPHETS dantly present in part six, "The Religious Life and Superstitions,"22 where Junod presents Thonga conceptions concerning nature, man and the supernatural. Here he is embarking upon the study of the Thonga "systemes de connaissance" and oral data carefully gathered and presented is crucial to the success of that enterprise. As it is the author does not allow his informants to speak to us at any length. The tendency shown by this great ethnographer to give closest attention to oral data gathered in respect to the psychic life and in respect to the beliefs and superstitions which to him constituted religion shows where oral data is commonly conceived to be crucial. Insofar as attempts are made to divulge various aspects of the psychic life of other cultures we must expect, if the work is at all adequate, to be provided with considerable oral data as the life is laid out for us, whether we are talking about it as experience or as a system of symbolic meanings. The closer this data is to spontaneous materials of a primary kind, in many ways, the better. And in any case adequate exploi- tation of such matters depends upon a method of entretien which is as nondirective as possible. Two important works from the standpoint of their use of oral data are Geoffrey Lienhardt's book on Dinka religion, Divinity and Experience, and Victor Turner's study of Ndembu Divination, Its Symbolism and Techniques.23 Lienhardt's book is full of just these kinds of oral data of most relevance to the student of religion: songs, hymns, myth texts, tales of marvels and divine interventions, invocations and prayers. Turner presents us with a detailed account of divination in which close attention is paid to the invocations and procedural addresses of the divinatory process - the oral data being included directly in the vernacular - as well as to the extended commentaries of his principal informants and assistants (also included in the vernacular). It is of interest that this monograph is divided into two sections. First Turner makes an analysis of divination as a process in which Ndembu society is represented sym- bolically and by which the diviner makes manifest what is hidden. As representative of social values and social order the diviner identifies those who are most inimical to this order. The second section comprises the frame of ethnographic description. Since the observation of divination 22 Ibid., II, 279-593. 23 Geoffrey Lienhardt, Divinity and Experience (London and Oxford, 1961); Victor Turner, Ndembu Divination, Its Symbolism and Techniques (Lusaka and Manchester, 1961). 207</page><page sequence="9">J. W. FERNANDEZ was very difficult, the ethnographic description, "to compensate for lack of direct observation," is really the full account of his interviews with diviners and other ritual experts. The analytic frame is developed by induction from the ethnographic description. But considerably more data is given in the latter than finds its way into the former and the careful reader of this oral data will find, thanks to the efforts made to be as non- directive as possible in its acquisition, a rich base by which to judge the analytic frame offered as a key to the data. The analysis of the various divinatory symbols - the diviner employs a basket full of symbolic objects which he tosses - demands a particularly careful technique of elicitation. The semantic structure of divinatory symbols is complex. Each symbol has a number of meanings and the particular meaning assigned to it in any given situation of divination is dependent upon the constellation of symbols appearing as the objects are thrown as well as upon the structure of social conflict in which the divination takes place. The kind of oral data which is adequate to an interpretation of the sym- bolic aspect of divination must be as freely volunteered and as extensive as possible. In respect to the more subtle material concerning religious symbolism, the new African religions - the so-called syncretist movements - offer valuable oral data. It is my experience that these materials are better explained in these sects than in traditional contexts. These sects are multitudinous in Africa and their sermons, prayers, songs and scriptural pronouncements are all of value in giving us insight into processes of religious reinterpretation. Sermons, particularly, offer us rich insights as we analyze semantic structures and devices of representation24 for the thematic concerns of changing African life they carry. The very recency of most of these sects gives the possibility of obtaining vivid and accurate accounts of their origins and early struggles. Testimonies to such origins as well as life histories of principal members constitute important data for those interested in these sects as revitalization movements which pass through stages in their development. The presumption has been that reli- gious movements pass from a stage of inspiration through communica- tion, organization adaptation to routinization.25 Inquiry into these 24 James W. Fernandez, "Unbelievably Subtle Words: Representation and Integra- tion in the Sermons of an African Reformation Cult," History of Religions, VI, 1 (1966), 43-69. 25 Anthony F. C. Wallace, "Revitalization Movements," American Anthropologist, LVIII (1956), 264-281. 208</page><page sequence="10">PREYING AMONG PRIESTS AND PROPHETS movements at various stages indicates that the intensity of communica- tion between members and the nature of oral data available in the cult changes from stage to stage.26 One may speak of the metaphors by which the members organize their experience at the inspiration and communi- cation stage becoming routinized as the cult group itself becomes rou- tinized. Living and revitalizing metaphors become dead metaphors as it were. What is pointed up here is the relationship of oral data to the partic- ular stage in the development of the social group in which it appears. We discuss further below this problem of context and evolution of context. Ecstatic behavior is a characteristic of these sects which ought to be mentioned. Frequently these leave some verbal residue in the form of visions or revelations ... sometimes the unintelligible mutterings of glosso- lalia. Direct recording of this kind of oral data has rarely been done and is pertinent to a broad range of psychosocial questions.27 We have said very little about oral data gathered at the third level of inquiry because students of religion have been rather more concerned with case studies, holistic approaches and various kinds of descriptive integration in lieu of the formulation and testing of sets of propositions on human religious behavior. There has been in those who study religion in Africa an awareness of if not a persuasion by the phenomenological argument which stresses a radical empiricism - the phenomena in itself. As such there has been a resistance to a fully hardened scientific method- ology which tends in its slow progress to dessicate as it understands and explains. If one is interested in "experience," "systemes de connaissance," "patterns of religious belief," "constellations of symbols," etc., the formulation of theory seems to produce only a very crude model of the complex, most often paradoxical, patternings by which man and his ultimate concerns are ordered. Moreover the models which have, in the past, been projected by the scientific method against the reality in the field have tended to be mechanistic constructs of the social order based on too facile notions such as the "strain towards equilibrium," or game theory. I do not mean to imply that there is no methodology suitable to secondary elicitation; or that there is no place for the careful elicitation of oral data in relation to rigorously constructed hypotheses. The simple 26 James W.

June Helm, pp. 38-49. 209</page><page sequence="11">J. W. FERNANDEZ point is that students of religion have tended to gather oral data spon- taneously or in a situation of open-ended elicitation with as much of an ear to the wayward and serendipitous response as to the determined check- ing out of sets of propositions in theoretical problem areas. It is perplexing, therefore, to counsel the general field worker on the kind of oral data he ought to elicit and the way he ought to elicit it without knowing the level on which he operates. His intentions depend upon his place in the social sciences as well as the specificity with which he feels he can and ought to define his problems beforehand. At the third level what is regarded as oral data is a function of a theory put forward as propositions to be tested. Various rather loosely stated propositions are present in religious studies, it is true. For example: (1) Ethical rules are stated or implied in the religious life which have consequences for economic, political and social behavior; (2) religious ritual and belief functions to maintain the social order; (3) child training practices determine the definition given to supernatural powers in adult religion. But it is not practical to suppose that anyone but a person well tutored in the inquiry involved would be sensitive to the kind of oral data which would have a bearing on such things as need for achievement, authori- tarianism and tolerance of ambiguity, or role theory and status incon- sistency. Since the testing of hypotheses demands that the set of stimuli by which one is to test them be rigorously comparable the notion had best be given up that oral data can be obtained at the third level without hard training. On the other hand data collected at other levels may be useful at all levels. For example, in respect to need for achievement "the assumption is that any imaginative production in narrative form can exhibit achieve- ment content.28 Hence the field worker can suppose that any imaginative narrative might have relevance to the behavioral scientist. Hypothesis testing in which oral testing is minimized -- and in which informants are asked to react in only the briefest way to stimuli presented to them, as in the study of perception of illusion by Segall, Campbell and Herskovits,29 are almost nonexistent in religious studies in Africa. Spier years ago put forth a test of word association norms30 as a method of 28 Robert Levine, Dream and Deed (Chicago, 1966) p. 50. 29 Marshall H. Segall, Donald T. Campbell and Melville J.

But this oral data, as in most sample surveys, though of real importance, is hardly of the kind that should interest us here. Such elicitation minimizes any complexity in the data for the sake of verifiability in response. The best counsel then (besides a reading of the works to which we have referred) is in favor of a readiness to collect whatever primary oral data that, through its stereotyped nature, is repeatedly available. Though such collections are of most value to the folklorist and the linguist proper yet such relatively stereotyped oral data as cosmogonic myths, prayers and invocations of the supernaturals, songs and chants, and instructions that pass between participants in rites and ceremonies should be included and are of great value to the student of religion. There is by no means enough of such oral data in the literature for purposes of comparison, and collec- tion of this material, while time remains, is urged upon anyone with the least opportunity. The collection of this data is primary in every sense. Should the possibility exist for a more focused elicitation of oral data the field worker can move up to the second level and provoke a good deal of discussion pursuing problems of the nature of man, the nature of his relationship to the universe, the natures and powers of the supernatural and the meaning and origin of various acts and symbols in ritual and cere- mony. Dialogues or elicitations focused towards such behavioral prob- lems as the relation of religion to the social order while constituting a move towards third level elicitation unless very carefully phrased eithercompletely inhibit the informant or overstructure and bias his answer. Here it would seem to be the obvious thing to leave the direct collection of such oral data to those who are out to prove a set of hypotheses. Any imaginative narrative which one can record is likely to be more helpful to them in an indirect way than any direct attempt to find oral data which will answer their questions. Supposing time on a researcher's hands and that one wants to know, substantively, what to ask informants so as to start a process of elicitation the old anthropological standby - Notes and Queries in Anthropology - still contains the basic questions of general ethnographic interest.31 But it is hardly adequate in respect to method to which we now turn. 31 One of the most comprehensive questionnaires on research on religion in Africa is that by Maurice Leenhardt,"Sociologie religieuse. Questionnaire en vue de 1'etablisse- ment d'une carte religieuse de I'A.O.F.," Bulletin de l'Institut FranCais d'Afrique Noire, XV (1953), 767-797. Leenhardt tells us (p. 768): "L'enquete religieuse est, en effet, la plus difficile que soit. Si l'on ne s'attache qu'a l'observation sociologique, l'on saisit 211</page><page sequence="13">J. W. FERNANDEZ The Ethnography of Oral Data It must be said without reservation that the best guarantee of adequate collection of oral data is close participant observation in the life of those from whom one is collecting. Vansina states it simply. "One can never be sure where one might unexpectedly come upon a testimony. The only hope of getting on to the right track is to enter into the life of the group one is studying and become acquainted with their daily routine over a long period."32 Participant observation places the research worker in the best position to collect that oral data characteristic of the daily routine but it also puts him into the position where he will be alerted to spon- taneous events which would otherwise go unrecorded and which cannot be planned for collection. By living in the village of Sougoudzap in northern Gabon, I was able to record illuminating midnight invocations of the ancestors and impreca- tions against fellow villagers by a young fool who for any daytime visitor to the village would have been one of the socially invisible. For this reason the prohibition established by the government of South Africa against living with Africans often deprives one of access to the kind of oral data which is most crucial to an understanding of the real social structure as well as the psychological well-being and level of participation of the members of a collectivity in their cultural life. The point to be made is that there is a great deal of oral data that passes to and fro as part of the life of any collectivity. Much of it may not be significant enough to record but all of it bears testimony in one way or another to l'esprit de collectivite, and participation in it greatly enhances the information available to the field worker upon which he will base his understanding and explanation. Maximum participation in the flow of oral data that characterizes community life is to be recommended, however, for more than ethno- graphic reasons- that is, because it enhances one's total understanding of the society and culture. Maximum participation also enhances one's understanding of the meaning of the particular body of oral data with des figures et des signes sociaux, mais leur signification spirituelle echappe. Si l'on cherche plut6t les croyances et les modalites de la foi on s'aventure dans l'interpr6tation des cosmogonies et des theologies." Leenhardt proposes to put forth a questionnaire that will do justice to both the social and cultural aspects of religion. 32 Vansina, op. cit., p. 189. 212</page><page sequence="14">PREYING AMONG PRIESTS AND PROPHETS which one is dealing. All oral data is composed of items or key words with both referential and affective linkages (denotations and connotations to employ an older vocabulary). These linkages or associations are all a product of experiences had within the culture by those who have produced the oral data. The more participant in-culture experience of the collector of oral data, the more available to him should be the associations bound up in that oral data for those to whom it is a natural cultural event. The availability of dictionaries and lexicon-trained translators reduces the problem of the referential or denotative meaning and the literal text can be fairly easily established. But as Vansina has warned33 the literal meaning is often very far from the meanings the informant intended to convey, or at least is complicated by connotative-affective implications. People in nonliterate cultures often show a great pleasure in symbolic, al- lusive and indirect statement, as has been pointed out.34 This would seem to be even more the case with oral data whose intentions are expressive rather than instrumental, as much religious communication is likely to be. In any case that control over the linkages involved in indirect statement which enables one to adequately interpret meaning is a product of a wide ranging participation. In interpreting and comparing the sermons in two African syncretist sects, one confronts the fact that the old-style multi-aspect ethnography is more useful in this task than a highly focused hypothesis testing job of fieldwork. This is because the ethnographer in broad-scale pursuits in many different aspects of culture is more likely to encounter the various contexts in which the keywords of verbal art appear and which are evoked by them and give them their currency.35 Participant observation implies some degree of language competence. We will pass over here, as elsewhere covered, the linguistic problems which are so crucial to the gathering of oral data with two exceptions: ortho- graphy and esoterica. There is no problem of orthography if one follows accepted linguistic canons and the International Phonetic Alphabet. On the other hand one has an obligation to the orthography of texts, studies and dictionaries previously published. Religious materials in the literature seem to offer a particularly confusing variety of orthographies. 33 Ibid., p. 65. 34 Edmund Leach, "Aesthetics," in Institutions of Primitive Society, ed. E. E.

FERNANDEZ These are the product, it would appear, of a natural interest of mission- aries in religion coupled with a sectarian compulsion for each mission to develop its own orthography. Among the Pahouin of Western Equatorial Africa there are at least four orthographies to choose from.36 It may often be possible to write a more phonemically accurate and parsimonious orthography while at the same time writing one's oral data in a way that enables the reader to move easily from one's materials to other materials previously published and in particular to existing dictionaries and lexi- cons. In any case in the study of religious change, particularly where previous oral data is of importance in establishing base lines and bench marks, this problem of orthography bears reflection. The problem of esoterica is the problem of religious language for which no meaning can be found. Vansina has discussed it.37 In Gabon the members of the Bwiti syncretist cult speak what they call their Latin - a bastardized and virtually unintelligible form of the Mitsogo tongue. The Mitsogo are the people with whom Bwiti originated. In Natal traditional diviners spoke in tongues and this is still prevalent in new cults. I think the policy here must be to record this perfectly legitimate oral data as carefully as possible. This can be done not only for compari- son with other "random seizure-speech" but also on the outside chance that something intelligible may eventually be made of it. This has hap- pened in the case of Bwiti Latin. Although informants who mouthed it could not translate it, Mitsogo informants were later found who could make parts of it out. Other phrases were traced to Kikongo. Above all, effective participant observation in the community should give to the student an understanding of the context in which the oral data in which he is interested appears. In the collection of any ethnographic data, whether this be material culture or mental culture, the more informa- tion which can be provided as to its context, the more fully can one assess its significance. The event from which the oral data has been collected must not only be placed in the yearly, monthly, weekly, daily cycle of the culture but the event itself must be, very likely, broken down into stages. Oral data is most frequently the product of an encounter between persons that, following a dramatic analogy, has its stages or scenes. We are well 36 These orthographies were: Gabon Protestant, Gabon Catholic, Spanish Guinea Catholic, American Mission. This is not to mention the orthography, the most satisfactory by all accounts, put forth by Pierre Alexandre (1958). The Peace Corps is now elaborating a new Fang orthography. 3' Vansina, op. cit., p. 67. 214</page><page sequence="16">PREYING AMONG PRIESTS AND PROPHETS aware that religious events in our own society, meetings, services or masses, have their dramatic stages as man steps forward to invoke the deity; moves on into His presence where the examination of traditional oral data (scripture) and the production of new oral data (sermon) can take place in a particularly hallowed atmosphere, makes his offertory of symbolic self, and then obtaining final blessing concludes the event. To practically all religious events the three stages of Van Gennep's Rites of Passage38 apply: separation, transition, reintegration. The oral data must be located in its appropriate phase. It has been pointed out how even the most casual event - social drinking - has its distinct phases.39 The oral data - the drinking talk - which characterizes this event can be broken down into Encounter Stages and Discourse Stages within each of which verbal acts have a particular focus serving a particular social function. Discourse changes as the nature of the encounter changes its quality and as the roles of the participants are at first manipulated and then crystalized. The point that should be made here is that oral data particularly at our first level is part of a social dynamic. Good method requires that its social and cultural context be specified, the stage of its appearance noted. What we are urging here is what has been called the ethnography of communication in which the study of oral data is part of the study of "communities organized as systems of communicative events."40 Any oral datum is to be understood as a component in a larger framework of organized components. We tend when we collect oral data to concentrate on it rather than upon its relations - or co-relations - with other com- ponents. How, simply put, does the oral data live in the social and cultural life from which it has been taken. Hymes41 has pointed out that any oral data should be analyzed in respect to seven factors: (1) the sender and his status and role; (2) the receiver and his status and role; (3) the form the message takes in respect to style (casual, formal, simple, complex, literal, allusive); (4) the channel employed (in our case always the same); (5) the 38 Arnold Van Gennep, Rites of Passage, trans.

FERNANDEZ code employed in respect to the particular subgroup argot or dialect; (6) the topic or what is being talked about (to be stated in indigenous cate- gories - the local answer to the question "What is he talking about?" being sought in every instance); (7) the setting, scene, or situations in which the oral data appear which subsumes all of the above, and other elements of the setting (also to be presented from the local point of view).42 If systematic answers are provided in identification of these factors one has finally to decide on the principal functions performed by the oral data one has gathered. The seven functions are: (1) Expressive (emotive); (2) Directive (rhetorical, persuasive); (3) Poetic; (4) Contact (phatic); (5) Metalinguistic; (6) Referential; (7) Contextual.43 Hardly any oral data can be found which fulfills just one of these functions and the problem is deciding upon the hierarchy of functions involved in any oral data. Not all oral data can be gathered as the ethnography of communication. But the method implied is important for it pressures us toward a practiced awareness in our collection of oral data. It teaches us that there is no such thing as the simple recording of oral data as upon a recording device. The ethnographer must himself register as much if not a good deal more than the machine itself. An awareness of the above listed factors and functions coupled with a dramatistic sense of dynamic developments in confrontations and discourse stages between participants will prepare the field worker to do justice to his oral data. In the field itself recording activities will thus be constantly accompanied by a wider analysis and evaluation. Conclusion: Preying Among Priests and Prophets Oral data gathered in the area of religion differs little in kind from any other sort of oral data gathered by Africanists. It may be more allusive and the quantity may be greater. The theory of cultural focus argues that many African societies evidence a high degree of articulate concern with religious matters. How one collects this data and what one imposes upon the informant or informants in the act of elicitation depends on the level 42 Hymes, ibid., p. 27, suggests that these factors might be otherwise stated! Who said it? Whom did he say it to? What words did he use? Did he phone or write? Was it in English? What did he talk about? Where did he say it? 43 Hymes, "Ethnography," p. 31. 216</page><page sequence="18">PREYING AMONG PRIESTS AND PROPHETS at which one follows a scientific methodology based on the formulation of propositions. We have distinguished three levels of collection and elicita- tion. Given the degree to which complex allusions, metaphors and para- doxical or indirect speech forms are frequent in the religious life the structuring of elicitation which inhibits such expression while satisfying the requirements of a scientific methodology falsifies such oral data and may not be empirical in the fullest sense. Spontaneous collection (level 1) and the method of "entretien" (level 2) are to be recommended for the collection of oral data on the religious life. Such method demands, as much as should be possible, participant observation. Effective participant observation implies an acquiring of experience sufficient to relate the oral data to its context. By this it is meant that participant observation helps the student to make the right associations (denotations and conno- tations) for the key words in the data. It enables him to locate the oral data in its appropriate stages in the various stages characteristic of the dramatic development of social life. And it enables him to specify factors and rank functions of the oral data as message which, when it was record- ed, was passing from the mouths of priests and prophets to the ears of adepts or circumambient powers. For the sake of social science men are obliged to prey among the world's populations in search of data to test their theories and propositions. However necessary this severe procedure must be, the point of this paper is that if we are to understand the intensity of men's communications with his fellow men and with his gods, a pro- longed participant observation is in order. In short, for adequacy in our interpretation of the oral data of other cultures some degree of commun- ality if not communion is required with our subjects.
