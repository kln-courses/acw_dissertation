Gordon Wasson* The past six years have seen unprecedented activity in the study of the halluci- nogenic mushrooms of Mexico. So diverse and extensive has this activity been, and so numerous are the publications about these mushrooms and their deriva- tives, that we believe a bibliography on the subject is timely. It will prove useful, we hope, in mobilizing our knowledge about them and in facilitating further research. This interest- scientific, cultural, popular- flows directly from the writings of Roger Heim and the Wassons. On February 13, 1956, Professor Heim sub- mitted his first Note about these mushrooms to the Académie des Sciences, Paris, based on the discoveries that my wife, Dr. Valentina P. Wasson, and I had made in the Sierra Mazateca, Oaxaca, in the summer of 1953. This initial Note, pub- lished in the Compte rendu of February 20, has been followed at intervals by others. In the spring of 1957 my wife and I brought out our book, Mushrooms Russia and History , the fruit of almost thirty years of intermittent research. Timed to coincide with its appearance, we published articles of haute vulgarisation on our Mexican mushrooms in Life (illustrated with reproductions of water-colors of the mushrooms by Professor Heim) and in This Week. Meanwhile Professor Heim was enlisting teams of scientists to work on the mushrooms. He himself has naturally coped with the mycological problems, ably assisted by his technician, Roger Cailleux. The scientists of the Swiss phar- maceutical house of Sandoz A. G. were quick to help. Drs. Arthur Brack and Hans Kobel succeeded in developing mass production of the fungal material in *Research Fellow, Botanical Museum of Harvard University. Paper submitted in August, 1962. [25]</page><page sequence="2">the laboratory. Dr. Albert Hofmann (discoverer of LSD-25, a substance kindred to the active principles found in the hallucinogenic mushrooms) isolated the two active agents, psilocybin and psilocin, and with his colleagues defined their mole- cular structure and succeeded in synthesizing them. Dr. A. Cerletti with his colleagues studied their pharmacological and physiological properties. Professor Jean Delay, the eminent French psychiatrist, was the first to head up a team to experiment clinically with psilocybin and psilocin at the Hôpital Ste. Anne in Paris. All of this activity culminated in the appearance of a book, Les Champignons Hallucinogènes du Mexique , large in format and richly illustrated, in the writing and editing of which Professor Heim was the prime mover. I contributed the historical and anthropological chapters, and Professor Heim did me the honor of joining my name to his as co-author on the title page; the Sandoz and Delay teams also made their several contributions. My wife and collaborator died at the end of 1958, and, when the book appeared a few weeks later, it was dedicated to her memory. It is appropriate, even inevitable, that, because of their number and broad scope and the quality of Professor Heim's contributions, his publications and ours be listed together in the first section of our bibliography. The second section, divided into three parts, deals with the past: a) Primary Sources , b) Later References , and c) Archeological. Under a) Primary Sources we give the citations for all references to the sacred mushrooms known to us in the early Mexican writings. As time goes on, more will certainly be uncovered. A promising area to explore lies in the body of surviving Nahuatl literature, largely in manuscript and mostly unread; Nahuatl is the language spoken by the Aztecs and many other peoples of Middle America at the time of the Conquest. Our b) Later References includes such citations as we have found in writers who are posterior to the Primary Sources (the last of these being Bishop Lanciego in 1726) and down to and includ- ing William E. Safford in 191 5. During these two centuries the record shows no first-hand contact by white men with the sacred mushrooms, no field trips, no curiosity about them. The sacred mushrooms of Mexico had never arrested the attention of the great outside world. Now they were known only to a few scholars poring over dusty tomes and records, who occasionally would mention them perfunctorily in their own obscure publications. Then finally Safford appeared on the scene and delivered, as he thought, the coup de grâce by declaring in an elaborate paper read before a distinguished society in Washington (later published with photographs and footnotes in a learned journal) that the vision- producing mushrooms had never existed. They had been, it would seem, an hallucination of the Spanish padres. The entries under c) Archeological are con- tributed by Dr. Stephan F. de Borhegyi, Director of the Milwaukee Public Museum, who for more than ten years has studied the "mushroom stones" of Middle America, those artifacts long considered enigmatic that we interpret as [26]</page><page sequence="3">the symbol of the religious cult of our sacred mushrooms. Following each entry in this sub-section Dr. de Borhegyi has added his illuminating comment. The third section in our Bibliography is anthropological, reflecting the revivified interest in the ways of the Indians leading their own lives today in the mountains of Oaxaca, Puebla, Vera Cruz, and the vicinity of Mexico City. The fourth section ísmycological. The fifth chemical, the sixth pharma- cological, and the seventh psychological, psychiatric, and clini- cal. The entries in these sections five, six, and seven often overlap, and therefore we have made them into a single list, but we have indicated in brackets to which sections each entry belongs. The eighth section covers parapsychological items; the ninth, cases of accidental ingestion of hallucinogenic mushrooms; and finally book reviews are listed in the tenth section. Much has been published on our mushrooms and psilocybin in the lay press, in many countries. Our bibliography does not attempt to cover these articles: perhaps they will be the subject of a brief paper on a future occasion. We have tried to make our entries complete to July i, 1962. The basic papers of Professor Heim that originally appeared in the Comptes rendus of the Académie des Sciences, Paris, were reprinted, except the most recent ones, in the Revue de Mycologie , complemented by specific definitions in Latin and certain other articles ; and finally these pieces were gathered together in three recapitulations : (1) Notes préliminaires sur les Agarics hallucinogènes du Mexique , 1957, hereafter called Notes prélim ... ; (2) Nouvelles Observations sur les Agarics hallucinogènes du Mexique , 1958, hereafter called Nouv Observ ... ; and (3) Deuxième Supplément aux Observations sur les Agarics hallucinogènes du Mexique , 1962, hereafter called Deux Supplé .... These were published by the Laboratoire de Cryptogamie, of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, 12, Rue de Buffon, Paris, Ve.

Reports (p 4) the finding of a square based anthropomorphic (Type C) mushroom stone from the shores of Lake Ayarza (Dept Santa Rosa) in Eastern Guatemala. The Specimen was found by a group of Guatemalan skin-divers who have been engaged in a systematic investigation of the inland lakes of Guatemala since 1954, seeking possible Pre-Columbian lake offerings. To date six mushroom stones (Types C and D) have been found in the waters of Lake Amatitlán in the Central Guatemalan Highlands. The specimen from Lake Ayarza is in the private collection of Manfred Töpke, while the others are in the private collections of Dr. Guillermo Mata- Amado and Jorge Castillo, of Guatemala City. Paper includes (p 7) a preliminary report on the (Type B) miniature mushroom stones found in a cache at Kaminaljuyu, now in the collection of Karl Heinz Notte- bohm of Guatemala City (for final report see next Entry). Also reports the finding of a (Type C) mushroom stone fragment (in the shape of an owl) from the recent excava- tion of the Post-Classic period (1000-1500 A.D.) at the Kakchiquel Maya capital of Iximché, in the Central Guatemalan Highlands. 85 . . "Miniature mushroom stones from Guatemala." Amer Antiq, Vol XXVI, No 4, April 1961, Salt Lake City, Utah, pp 498-504. Offertory cache of nine miniature mushroom stones and nine miniature metates with manos from the Verbena cemetery at Kaminaljuyu in Highland Guatemala, dating from the Late Pre-Classic Miraflores phase, 300 B.C. to 200 A.D. All of the mushroom stones are of the Type B variety with a circular groove around the base of the cap (average height 16cm). A similar but larger Type B mushroom stone, in the shape of a jaguar, has been found in a Miraflores tomb in Mound E-III-3 at the same site (see Shook and Kidder, Entry 103). The cache of nine miniatures demonstrates considerable antiquity for the "mushroom-stone cult," and suggests a possible ceremonial association with the nine Lords-of-the-night and gods of the underworld, as well as the possible existence among the Highland Maya of a nine-day cycle and nocturnal count in Pre-Classic times. The association of the miniature mushroom stones with the miniature metates and manos greatly strengthens the possibility that, at least in some areas in Pre-Colum- bian Mesoamerica, metates were used to grind the sacred hallucinatory mushrooms to [41]</page><page sequence="18">prepare them for ceremonial consumption. The article includes, as Fig 2 and Table 1, a revised chart of Borhegyi's 1957 chronologic distributional table, and brings up to date the mushroom stone and pottery mushroom finds in Mesoamerica. About 50 archeological sites are Usted from Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador where mushroom stones and pottery mushrooms have been found during archeological excavations, or in private collections and museums. All miniature mushroom stones and metates with manos described in this article are in the private collection of Karl Heinz Nottebohm, of Guatemala City. The large Type B mushroom stone (Fig 3), representing a kneeling young woman (a virgin?) with a metate y is from the Hans Namuth collection in New York. To date this is the only comprehensive article on mushroom stones and pottery mushrooms, and the first report on the existence of miniature mushroom stones. 86 . .

Reply by the noted American ethno-linguist to Sapper's suggestion in Globus (1898), Entry 100, that an anthropomorphic mushroom stone illustrated from El Sal- vador was a phallic symbol. Brinton suggests that since the stone resembles a mush- room or toadstool, it may have been intended by its maker to represent just that. Brinton further suggests that, since the Tseltal-Maya word for mushroom is hu and is sufficiently similar to the word used for moon uh or yuh to recall it in sound, the mush- room stones may have been emblematic of the lunar and nocturnal divinity. Accord- ing to him the night growth of the fungus would strengthen this mythical alliance. The Type C specimen referred to is now in the Rietberg Museum collection in Zürich.

Figure 36 (left) (Cat no 2366; Lot no C-69) is probably of the Early Pre-Classic Las Charcas phase (1000 B.C. to 500 B.C.), and as such ranks among the earliest known effigy mushroom stones. Figure 36 (right) is from tomb 1 in Mound E-III-3 at Kaminaljuyu (Shook and Kidder, 1952, fig 78/) and is one of the first examples (Late Pre-Classic-Miraflores phase, 300 B.C.-300 A.D.) of this problematical sculp- ture to be excavated. Both specimens are now in the National Museum in Guatemala City (Cat no 2366 and 3450 respectively). 90. Foster, George M. "Some implications of modern Mexican mold-made pottery." Sthwest J Anthrop, Vol IV, No 4, 1948, pp 356-370. According to Foster, some pre-Conquest Mexican pottery was made using convex mushroom-shaped pottery molds. These molds appear to have originated from the practice of molding pots over the upturned bottom of finished vessels. The same technique is still in use at several places in Mexico. Owing to the fact that some modern mushroom-shaped pottery molds from Tzintzuntzan and Metepec in Mexico (see figs 2, 3) and some Pre-Columbian pot- tery anvils from North America (see fig 6) have a slight resemblance to the Pre- Columbian pottery-mushrooms from Mexico and El Salvador (see nos 46, 47, 48 in Borhegyi's chart), there exists the slight possibility that pottery-mushrooms were used, not in Pre-Columbian hallucinogenic mushroom rites, but to aid in the shaping and manufacturing of culinary pottery objects.

This is the first publication reporting (pp 104 and 142) the discovery of mushroom stones in a scientifically controlled excavation. It describes and illustrates (fig i6oa-h) ten mushroom-shaped stone objects from Guatemala and Mexico. Six of the speci- mens are plain or effigy mushroom stones (Type C), while three belong to the tripod (Type D) variety. Five have been reproduced in Borhegyi' s chart as nos 32, 28, 38, 19, 18. The Type C effigy mushroom stones represent seated human figures, birds, and pisotes. Kidder briefly but concisely discusses their known distri- bution (p 142) in the Highlands and Pacific Slopes of Guatemala and Mexico, and that of similar pottery-mushrooms in El Salvador. He is non-committal as to their use, but refutes previous suggestions that they represent phalli or were used as seats. Of the specimens illustrated in the publication, five (fig 1 6of,h,e,g and fig 42) are in the collections of the Guatemala National Museum (Cat nos 2368 a; 2368 b; 4631, 1903, 2715), and two (fig 1600, b) in the Regional Museum, at Tuxtla Gutiérrez, in Mexico; the whereabouts of the remainder are unknown. 93.

Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, 1961, pp 16 and 28, fig 15b, pi 6j. Illustrates (fig 156, and pl. 6j.) and describes (p 16 and p 28) a Type E pottery mush- room fragment, found in the excavation of Trench 2, in level 4. The fragment is of a coarse-paste, unslipped, unburnished, thick-wall utility ware, subsequently named Chiapifla ware. Although only one fragment is illustrated (upside down), Sanders indicates (p 28) that there were several of these "mushroom" pots or "mushroom" vessels in Trench 2. The Chiapilla period at the Santa Cruz site is equated by Sanders with the Mid- or Late- Pre-Classic (500 B.C. -0 A.D.) Francesa and Guanacaste periods (IV-V) at the site of Chiapa de Corzo. Owing to the fact, however, that level 4, in Trench 2, was a disturbed level (see p 9), it is possible that the "mushroom" vessels are of the later Santa Cruz period, which is of late Pre-Classic or Proto- Classic (0 A.D. -200 A.D.) date. The specimens are now in the Regional Museum at Tuxtía Gutiérrez in Chiapas. 100. Sapper, Carl. "Pilzförmige Götzenbilder aus Guatemala und San Salvador." Globus , Vol 73, No 20, 1898, p 327. Illustrates and describes an anthropomorphic mushroom stone on a square base (Type C) from El Salvador, now in the Rietberg Museum in Zürich (see Wasson and Wasson, Entry 1, Pi XLIII; and Heim and Wasson, Entry 2, Pi XI). Sapper explores the function of these objects, citing Dr. Santiago F. Barbarena, then Director of the National Museum in San Salvador, who believes that mushroom stones represent phalli , and that the nine-pointed star, comprising the head-dress of the figure depicted on the mushroom stone, refers to the nine month pregnancy. (For a Type C effigy mushroom stone with a similar nine-pointed crown, found at Kaminaljuyu, see Kidder, Jennings, and Shook, Entry 92, fig 160J ; reproduced as no 19 on Borhegyi' s chart cited above.) Sapper refutes Barbarena' s suggestion on the ground that the Pre-Columbian Maya Indians used a 20 month year, and that the wide cap of the stone in question does not resemble a phallus.

Illustrates (p 183) and describes (pp 182-183, 236-237) several plain and effigy tripod mushroom stones (Type D) located in private collections by Dr. Seler in die course of his famous reconnaissance trip to Guatemala and Mexico in 1895-96. These stones are reportedly from Chuchun and Los Diamantes on the Pacific Pied- mont area of Guatemala, and from Tecpán, Los Pastores, Pompeya, and El Portal in the Central Highlands. They are referred to as "stone seats." Some of the specimens described were donated to the Berlin Museum in 1896, while others found their way to the American Museum of Natural History in New York (Cat nos 30/3122, 30/5448 and 30/50449).

Describes the chronological occurrences of the Pre-Classic mushroom stones in the Central Highland area of Guatemala. Asserts that simple stone sculpture probably begins during the Early Pre-Classic Las Charcas phase (1000 to 500 B.C.) in the Maya Highlands with the fashioning of effigy mushroom-like objects. Also mentions the finding of the jaguar-shaped tripod mushroom stone (Type B) in tomb 1, at Mound E-III-3 at Kaminaljuyu (cf Shook and Kidder, Entry 103, p 112, fig 78 f and no 15 in Borhegyi's chart, above cited). Shook's premise, that mushroom stones were manufactured during the Las Charcas phase, is not yet fully substantiated. However, mushroom caps (Type A) were discovered in Las Charcas deposits (Guatemala National Museum, Lot nos C-50, C-69, C-43) and are reproduced as nos 8, 10, in Borhegyi's chart. It is also possible that the jaguar mushroom stone (no 12 in Bor- hegyi's chart) is of Las Charcas date. 103 . , and A. V. Kidder.

See p 112, fig 78/, fig 13-no 193. Shook and Kidder describe the finding of an exquisitely carved tripod effigy mush- room stone (Type B) in the rich Mid-Pre-Classic (Miraflores phase, 300 B.C. to 200 A.D.) tomb i at Kaminaljuyu. This jaguar-shaped mushroom stone is reproduced as no 15 in Borhegyi's chart. Kidder and Shook earlier contended (1946) that mushroom stones are products of the Classic period. The finding of this mushroom stone in a sealed Miraflores phase tomb (fig 13, no 193) establishes with finality that at least certain types of mushroom stones (Types A, B, C) are of Pre-Classic date, and that the mushroom stone cult among the Highland Maya was in vogue as early as 300 B.C. The specimen is now in the Guatemalan National Museum collection (Cat no 3450). This Pre-Columbian jaguar mushroom stone is the first reported from a tomb. 104 . .

In his archeological survey of the Central Guatemalan Highlands, Shook describes 103 archeological sites, their location, architecture, and the specimens collected from each site. Seven sites yielded mushroom stones of the effigy (Type B and C) and tripod (Type D) variety. The seven sites are Aeropuerto, Agua Caliente, Alux, Aurora, Cementerio, Eucaliptus, and Kaminaljuyu. They are reproduced as nos 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 27, 28, 29, 31, 38, 39, 40 in Borhegyi's chart Shook's article represents the first attempt to survey the distribution of mushroom stones in the Central Guatemalan Highlands. Most of the specimens referred to in Shook's article are in the collections of the Guatemalan National Museum. 105. Sorenson, John L.

Five pottery mushrooms (Type E) are illustrated upside down and described mistakenly as tall pottery jars with round "bottoms" expanded to bowl shape. The "bottoms" are roughened by textile imprints and by stamping them with crinkled edges of pecten shell. One specimen (fig 65 a-3) was found in a sealed tomb at the site of Isla (near Paraíso and Bellote) in association with typical Maya Proto-Classic (200 to 300 A.D.) pottery (unbridged spouted vessels, mammiform feet, etc.). Four similar pottery mushrooms were found in a shell mound at Ceiba, also near Bellote in the State of Tabasco, not far from the Atlantic. This find helps us to assign a tenta- tive proto-Classic date to the pottery mushrooms found throughout Southern Mexico (Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, Oaxaca, Chiapas) and Eastern El Salvador. Similar (Type E) pottery mushrooms are reproduced as nos 46, 47, 48 in Borhegyi's chart. The specimens found by Stirling are in the Regional Museum at Villahermosa in Tabasco. 107. Stromsvik, Gustav.

Illustrates and describes the only possible mushroom stone fragment (stem and lower portion missing) ever reported from Yucatán where mushroom stones seem to be absent. Fragment was found by Stromsvik in the South East gallery of the Dzab-Na Cave, located near the village of Tecoh, south of Mérida. It was discovered in association with a slate-ware bowl, a wooden statuette, and six broken metates with short manos. The specimen consists only of a cap, so that it cannot be ascertained for sure whether it was a grinding implement or, less likely, the top portion of a mushroom stone. Similar doubt is expressed by Heim and Wasson, Entry 2 (p 117, foot 1). This is why it was omitted from the distributional list of Borhegyi. The fragment along with other material from the cave is in the Regional Museum at Mérida, in Yucatán. 108. Termer, Franz. "Auf den Spuren rätselhafter Völker in Süd-Guatemala."

Termer believes that the specimen may pertain to the Pipil culture, known to have influenced this area during the Classic period (3 00-900 A.D.), and that it represents a fertility idol, in the form of a phallus, attached to the back of this toad. The specimen is similar to a toad-shaped mushroom stone from Cerro Alux, near Mixco (Guatemala [48]</page><page sequence="25">Highlands), reproduced as no 31 in Borhegyi's chart. The whereabouts of the specimen illustrated by Termer is unknown. There are similar specimens in local private collections (Faustino Padilla Collection at Lake Ixpaco, Dept Santa Rosa). 109.

See p 24, figs 19/, 20k Describes and illustrates the finding of tripod mushroom stones with plain stems (Type D) at Finca el Baúl (Dept Escuintla), a site on the Coastal Piedmont of Guate- mala. Several fragments and one complete specimen (fig 20 b) came from the excava- tion of an offertory cache-pit in front of the platform on which stood Monument 3, a huge boulder sculpture, representing an aquiline-nosed, bearded individual. Associated in this cache-pit with the mushroom stones were other small stone sculp- tures, such as yokes, vertically tenoned anthropomorphic and zoomorphic sculptures, and some pottery sherds. On the basis of the contents of the pit, Thompson was able to assign the tripod mushroom stones (Type D) to the Late Classic San Juan phase (600-900 A.D.). This chronological assignment is substantiated by the finds of Gann (1939) at Patulul where a plain tripod mushroom stone was found in association with a Late Classic burial. Thompson refers to the mushroom stones found at El Baúl as stone seats. They are reproduced as no 39 in Borhegyi's chart.

In 1 941 or thereabouts Dr. Singer, working over mushroom collections in the Farlow at Harvard, came upon a specimen that R. E. Schlütes had brought back in 1938 from Huautla de Jiménez and that, according to Schuhes' field notes, the Maza- tec Indians had said was vision-producing. Dr. Singer correctly identified it and he was the first person to associate the genus Psilocybe with the Mexican sacred mush- rooms. His priority lies in this fungal identification in the Cambridge laboratory. Unfortunately his discovery proved to be stillborn. He did not disclose what he had found even to Dr. Schultes, who would have been intensely interested. He published nothing on the subject until about a decade had elapsed, when in the first edition of his work on the systematics of the Agaricales , more than 800 pages long, he dropped in casually two brief, enigmatic allusions, lost in the expanse of that vast work, to the use of Psilocybe sp. by Mexican Indians. He cited no source or authority. Those of us who later became interested in the identification of the species so used would have been helped by Dr. Singer's discovery, had we known of it, and would have been delighted to give him full credit. When we published our book, some 15 years had elapsed from the date of this identification. He had done nothing with it. We were ignorant of it. We owed him nothing. He revealed to me his prior identification of the mushroom specimen when we met him, on the one and only occasion, at Huautla de Jiménez and at the nearby airstrip, on Monday, July 15, 1957, during his hurried passage through an area that we had been studying for some years. By this time we had done much of our work and had brought out our book, here listed as Entry 1. It is understandable that the circumstances should have caused Dr. Singer disappointment, but I must disclaim responsibility for them. In the second edition of his Agaricales, on pp 543-4, Dr. Singer greatly expands his comment on the use and properties of these mushrooms. His cultural observations must be read with caution. He asserts that the Guatemala Indians use the mushrooms as a drug. Until our book came out in 1957 this had never been reported by any student of the indigenous cultures. Since our book appeared no one has reported from Guatemala the use of these mushrooms. In our book we advanced the bold surmise that there had once been a mushroom cult in Guatemala of which the symbols- the archeological artifacts known as "mushroom stones" and pottery "mushrooms"- are occasionally found today. According to our hypothesis, the ritu- alistic use had prevailed for centuries, even millennia, but had died out in the Maya country in Pre-Columbian times, for reasons unknown. The resolution of this problem hangs on evidence that is being slowly accumulated. That Dr. Singer should link the present-day Maya with the use of the Sacred Mushrooms shows how alien to him are the problems of Indian culture. He made a like assertion before, in the Bull of the Chicago Nat His Museum (see Entry 171), whereupon we drew his atten- tion by private communication to his error. He now persists in it. r.g.w. 171 . . "Sacred mushrooms inspire medical research." Chicago Nat Hist Mus Bull , Dec 1957, p 7. 172 . , and Alexander H. Smith. "New species of Psilocybe."

The American mycologist in this review criticized sharply the Wassons and incidentally his confrère Roger Heim for certain alleged inaccuracies in Mushrooms Russia &amp; History, alleged inaccuracies that had no bearing on their general argument. We decided to ignore what we considered his untoward remarks, but in France they aroused lively comment and inspired three replies showing, in my opinion, that Dr. Smith had himself been largely mistaken in his strictures: see Entries 27, 326, and 331.
