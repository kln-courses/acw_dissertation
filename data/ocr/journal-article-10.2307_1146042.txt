<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Presence of Mediation Roger Copeland Then and Now Two productions, precisely 20 years apart, emblematic of their respec- tive decades as well as of the immense chasm that separates the 1960s from the I980s: the Living Theatre's Paradise Now (1968) and Richard Foreman's What Did He See (1988). The former is often regarded as a quintessential affirmation of live, unmediated presence. Its most notorious sequence, "The Rite of Universal IntercourSe," was also its most representative. Julian Beck and Judith Malina described it as follows: "The actors gather near the center of the playing area. They lie down together on the stage floor, embracing. Their bodies form a pile, caressing, moving, undulating, lov- ing. They are breaking the touch barrier. [. . .] If a member of the public joins this group, he is welcomed into the Rite" (1971:74). Twenty years later Foreman's production was intent upon constructing barriers, not eradicating them (or, perhaps more precisely, objectifying otherwise invisible barriers). Here the performer/spectator relationship was "mediated" both aurally and visually. A transparent, Plexiglas wall separated the audience from the performers. The actors' voices were heard "indirectly," filtered through microphones and speaker systems-but not for the conventional purpose of amplification. The performance took place in an exceedingly intimate space (the Susan Stein Shiva Theater in Joe Papp's Public Theater complex). That thin sheet of Plexiglas notwith- standing, there was no conventional reason to amplify the actors' voices. Indeed, the space was so intimate, one could virtually read the actors' lips. No, this mode of technological mediation was there to mediate, not to amplify or to allow for some sort of hypernaturalism or whispered inti- macy. (The body mikes, by the way, were unabashedly and rather grue- somely visible, taped to the actors' cheeks like I.V. needles that had missed their marks.) This may sound like yet another set of classic confrontations between Antonin Artaud and Bertolt Brecht. And indeed, one could easily approach the juxtaposition in that way. Certainly 20 years ago, one would have read it that way. Paradise Now would have been viewed as an attempt to reunify the community in a neo- (or pseudo-) ritual, erasing any sense of theatrical rift. Our word "theatre," after all, derives etymologically from the Greek "theatron" or "seeing place," implying a necessary separation between the audience (those who watch) and the actors (those who do). What Did He The Drama Review 34, no. 4 (T128), Winter 1990o 28</page><page sequence="2">Roger Copeland 29 See, by contrast, intensifies that separation with a series of verfremdungsef- fekts designed to preserve the spectator's perceptual freedom. But I'd like to propose that today there may be a different and more illuminating way of contrasting the ambitions of these two productions: not as Artaud vs Brecht, but rather Artaud vs Jacques Derrida or Jean Baudrillard. Artaud, the apostle of pure, unmediated presence vs those "poststructuralist" thinkers who complicate the distinction between pres- ence and absence. Derrida's Christmas "The absence of presence." This phrase has become such a cliche of poststructuralist criticism that it even serves as the punch line of a pretty good joke: "What's a Derridean Christmas?" You guessed it: "The absence of presents." The fact that this joke works better live (when heard), than it does on paper (when read), may mean that the joke is on Derrida-for his critique of presence hinges on the assumption that someone with whom we have a face-to-face conversation is no more "present" to us than some- one from whom we receive a letter. To use the fashionable formulation: Derrida refuses to "privilege" speech over writing. Thus-according to this argument-even the most spontaneous utterance has already been infiltrated by the spirit of writing. Living speech, in other words, is no less mediated than print. And for those who find Derrida's critique of presence too farfetched or too abstract to be convincing, there's Baudrillard's con- ception of the "hyperreal," a reality so mediated by media that we're no longer capable of distinguishing "the real thing" from its simulation (or maybe it's just that we so often seem to prefer the simulation to the real thing). Note for example, that on Broadway these days even nonmusical plays are routinely miked, in part because the results sound more "natural" to an audience whose ears have been conditioned by stereo television, high fidelity LP's, and compact disks. Much has been written in recent years about the effect of Derrida's ideas on some of our most cherished notions about theatre. But the problem with most of these analyses is that they focus too narrowly on his critique of phonocentrism, the idea that the living voice offers some sort of privileged access to the speaker's authentic self, whereas the very same person's written words are comparatively lifeless, impersonal, alienated ... in any event, less present. Elinor Fuchs, in an essay entitled "Presence and the Revenge of Writing," argues that: "Since the Renaissance, Drama has traditionally been the form of writing that strives to create the illusion that it is composed of spontaneous speech, a form of writ- ing that paradoxically seems to assert the claim of speech to be a direct con- duit to Being" (1985:163). What she says is certainly true of naturalism and realism (perhaps even of some genres of poetic realism), but is it true of all--or even most--drama since the Renaissance? Of Elizabethan, Jaco- bean, and Restoration drama? Of Pirandello, Genet, and Beckett-not to mention Brecht? Do any of these writers try to conceal their literariness? Do they really attempt to create the illusion that the words spoken by their characters are being uttered spontaneously (what Stanislavski called "the illusion of the first time")? Speaking of Helene Weigel in The Mother, Brecht wrote that she spoke "the sentences as if they were in the third person" (in Willet 1967: I74). And even the most conversational readings of Shakespeare don't in any way deny the "literariness" of iambic pen- tameter.</page><page sequence="3">30 Presence of Mediation 1. &amp; 2. The quintessential affirmation of live, un- mediated presence: Paradise Now (1968). The actors in "The Rite of Universal In- tercourse" (plate 1) are "breaking the touch bar- rier." The actors walk among the spectators (plate 2): "If a member of the public joins this group, he is welcomed into the Rite."

Which is not to say that theatre hasn't changed in ways that reflect the insights of Derrida (and, I would hasten to add, Baudrillard). But it's essential that our conception of theatrical presence not be confined to "phonocentrism." For presence in the theatre has less to do with the dis- tinction between speaking and writing than with the way in which the architectural and technological components of the performance space either promote or inhibit a sense of "reciprocity" between actors and spec- tators. (Although I would concede that the speech/writing dichotomy can provide an effective metaphor for discussing other, more pertinent modes of theatrical mediation insofar as language-whether spoken or written- always remains at a distance from the objects it signifies.)</page><page sequence="4">Roger Copeland 31 .... ..... .. _PF:- orr 3. &amp; 4. Richard Foreman's What Did He See (1988) was intent on constructing- or at least making visible- barriers. A transparent Plexiglas wall separated the audience from the performers (plate 3). Although amplifi- cation was not necessary in the intimate performance space, microphones were conspicuously taped to per- formers' faces, mediating their voices (plate 4). (Photos by Martha Swope) The "Essence" of Theatre Indeed, if Derrida and/or Baudrillarid are correct, then most of the tradi- tional arguments about the theatre's essence and raison d'etre cry out for reexamination. Let's run one of the most familiar versions of this argument up the flagpole and see if it still flies: What is unique about the theatre? What can happen there that can't happen at the movies, or in literature, or while standing before a painting or a work of sculpture? Until recently, the answer-no matter who provided it-almost always had something to do with the fact that it's live and unmediated, that it can put us in the presence of other living, breathing human beings. Sure, the movies can cut instanta- neously from Brooklyn to Moscow. They can fill the big screen with close-ups of objects too tiny to register in the most intimate loft; they can</page><page sequence="5">32 Presence of Mediation pan past vistas too vast to be contained on the deepest opera house stage. But they can't rival the face-to-face encounter of actor and audience that constitutes the theatre's unique glory. That at least is the traditional (if middlebrow) argument. This was also the point at which the middlebrow and the modernist met. (Modernism here being defined as an effort to strip each medium to its "essence," jettisoning anything in the art work deemed extraneous to that essence.) If the essence of the medium is defined as "presence" then the theatrical modernist will reaffirm this ancient wisdom with a vengeance. The late '6os work of the Living Theatre may have flaunted the possibilities of live, "unmediated" presence a bit more aggressively than a play by Thornton Wilder, but neither would have taken issue with this time-honored concep- tion of what makes the theatre unique. A recent advertisement for the Denver Center Theatre Company reads in part, "Not available on videocassette, compact disc, album, sixteen mil- limeter, eight millimeter, video disc or eight track ... The Magic of Live Theatre." (A minor scandal ensued some years ago when it was revealed that Liza Minelli was lip synching to her own prerecorded voice during a particularly strenuous song and dance routine in the Broadway musical The Act.) And those who wax nostalgic about Broadway's golden age often argue that the sort of amplification--and unintended mediation- which is now routine in so many theatres amounts to nothing less than a fall from grace. In the mid-'6os, Jerzy Grotowski took a comparably hard line against technological mediation: "What is the theatre? What is unique about it? What can it do that film and television cannot?" he asked in Towards a Poor Theatre (1968:19). And this was his answer: "By gradually eliminating whatever proved superfluous, we found that theatre can exist without make-up, without autonomic costume and scenography, without a separate performance area (stage), without lighting and sound effects, etc. It cannot exist without the actor-spectator relationship of perceptual, direct, 'live' communion" (1968:19). Theatre groups who made use of microphones, film, and video were accused by Grotowski of "artistic kleptomania," of stealing from other media (which had the effect of obscuring-and also mediating-the theatre's "true" source of power). The "poor theatre" (which is the name Grotowski gave to theatre that's been stripped to its "essence"), "[.. .] challenges the notion of theatre as a synthesis of disparate creative disci- plines-literature, sculpture, painting, architecture, lighting, acting [. . .]. This 'synthetic theatre' is the contemporary theatre, which we readily call the 'Rich Theatre'-rich in flaws" (1968:19). Grotowski's blanket dismissal of the "rich theatre" refuses-unwisely in my opinion-to differentiate between brassy, overproduced Broadway musicals and more ambitious exercises in what used to be called "total theatre." But at least during the I96Os, the technological components of the total theatre event-particularly the film and slide-projected images- were usually there not to mediate or complicate living presence but to intensify it: to massage and stimulate the senses, to provide, in other words, the experience of sensory overload (often a simulation of psychedelia). The result-as with psychotropic drugs-was often a heightened sense of presentness, of the here and now (another corollary of presence). And many exercises in total theatre (Luca Ronconci's Orlando Furioso [1968], Ariane Mnouchkine's 1789 [1970]) also tended to surround the audience "environmentally," intensifying the sense that performers</page><page sequence="6">Roger Copeland 33 and spectators share the same space and time, challenging the illusion typically created by the fourth wall (which implies that the spectators are peering into a spatial and temporal dimension different from the one they actually inhabit at that moment). Varieties of Theatrical Presence So, it seems clear that something called "living presence" has always been sacred to the theatre-and never more so than during the I960s. But it's equally clear (even from the handful of examples cited above) that the word "presence" means different things to different people-and that some of these meanings are mutually exclusive. So before we try and determine whether or not presence has become an endangered species in the age of Derrida and Baudrillard, let's examine more closely what people mean when they speak of presence. Do they mean "stage presence," the sort of charisma that enables some performers to grab us by the lapels and command "look at me, look at me?" And if so, how does this sort of living presence differ from the no less mesmerizing aura generated by the mechanically reproduced image of the movie star? Andre Bazin once wrote, "It is false to say that the screen is incapable of putting us 'in the presence' of the actor. It does so in the same way as a mirror-one must agree that the mirror relays the presence of the person reflected in it-but it is a mirror with a delayed reflection [. . .]" (1967:97). (Bazin here seems to be recalling Oliver Wendell Holmes' de- scription of photography as "a mirror with a memory.") In Lee Breuer's production of Beckett's Come and Go (1974), the three actors who comprise the cast were concealed from the audience; only their mirrored reflection was visible. And what is it precisely about an actor's presence--whether live or on screen-that commands our attention? Is presence the ability to project a fictional "character" into the second balcony or is it just the opposite: the performer's ability to strip herself of protean, fictional fabrication and reveal her "authentic" self (as Joe Chaikin seems to advocate in his book The Presence of the Actor [1972]). In his Open Theater production, The Mutation Show (1971), the actors compared their onstage faces to photo- graphs of their younger, offstage faces. Carl Dreyer, commenting on Fal- connetti's extraordinary performance in his 1928 film The Passion ofJoan of Arc (in which the actress wore no makeup) said she was the only performer he knew who went to work by taking off her makeup. Presence in this sense becomes a badge of unchallengeable authenticity (and, of course, a key concept for the decade of the I960s). Ethel Merman singing "Rose's Turn" in Gypsy (1959) and Chris Burden nonchalantly having himself shot in the arm (Shoot, 1971) embody two very different-but equally distinctive-modes of living presence. Perhaps this is the sort of difference Lionel Trilling (1972) had in mind when he traced the transition from the social ideal of sincerity to that of authenticity: the former assumes a correspondence-one that can never really be vali- dated-between what the audience sees and what the performer is pre- sumed to experience inwardly. "To thine own [or the character's] self be true." The latter confronts the perceiver with a certifiably nonfictional situation. Other conceptions of theatrical presence have little or nothing to do with the performer's charisma, capacity for self-exposure, or masochistic risk taking. One can, in other words, be "in the presence of" a thoroughly</page><page sequence="7">34 Presence of Mediation uncharismatic performer. Similarly, presence need not be synonymous with authenticity. Indeed, we spend most of our lives "in the presence" of the inauthentic (or the authentically inauthentic, as in: "It's not fake any- thing, it's real Dynel"). This latter conception of presence requires nothing more than that performer and spectator share a certain amount of time together in the same space. There may be a litmus test for this sort of presence: Perhaps being "in the presence of" a performer means that we could, if we so desired, reach out and touch (that) someone-and touch in a more direct, less mediated manner than Ma Bell has in mind. If so, this would help explain the late '6os compulsion (e.g., Paradise Now) to affirm presence by creating oppor- tunities for the physical interaction of performers and spectators. Megan Terry described the end of Viet Rock (1966) as a "celebration of presence": "One by one they [the actors] enter the audience. Each chooses an audience member and touches his hand, head, face, hair. Look and touch. Look and touch" (1967:104). In the Performance Group's Dionysus in 69 (1968), William Finley as Dionysus (and himself) invited the audience to join an orgiastic celebration of his "nativity." Here two different sorts of presence were affirmed: the presence of the actor (Finley's identity is revealed rather than concealed beneath that of the character) and the sense in which both actor and audience are "present to" one another. Of course, one can be "present to" someone without actually touching her or him, providing that there's some sense of reciprocity, a sense that what transpires onstage-in contrast to the movies-is affected almost as much by what happens in the audience as the other way around. To cite only the most familiar example of this two-way street: When a group of live actors delivers a fast-paced comic dialog to a receptive audience, we expect them to wait until the laughter has died down before beginning the next round of verbal one-upmanship. By contrast when you're part of a large and responsive movie audience watching Cary Grant trade wise- cracks with Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday (1940), you're almost cer- tain to miss some hilarious comebacks. And if performers and audience members are present to one another in space, are they also, by definition, present to one another in time? Does being present also imply a sense of presentness? Robert Edmund Jones, in The Dramatic Imagination, wrote, "This is drama; this is theatre-to be aware of the Now" (1941:40). But whose "now"? The actor's (here and now) or the character's (which may be way back when)? Marsha Norman's 'Night Mother (1982) takes place in a fictional world, but it also attempts to create an exact congruence between onstage time and "real time." (The numerous and highly visible clocks on the furniture and walls of the set correspond exactly to the time we can read on our own watches.) Simi- larly, in Peter Handke's Offending the Audience (1966), the four speakers (who never portray "characters") inform the audience that "Here you are not experiencing a time that pretends to be another time. The time on stage is no different from the time off stage. We have the same local time here" (I969:Io). Handke's play is the ultimate affirmation of here and now, tonight, in this particular theatre. Presence and Representation But Handke's conception of presence is infinitely more radical: It at- tempts to ban representation entirely. With unrelenting obsessiveness,</page><page sequence="8">Roger Copeland 35 Handke's speakers hammer away at the very impulse to signify, the desire to see something as anything other than itself. It's as if his loquacious speakers could exorcise representation by outtalking it: You see no picture of something. Nor do you see the suggestion of a picture. Nor do you see an empty picture. The emptiness of this stage is no picture of another emptiness. The emptiness of this stage signifies nothing. This stage is empty because objects would be in our way. It is empty because we don't need objects. This stage repre- sents nothing. It represents no other emptiness. This stage is empty. You don't see any objects that pretend to be other objects. You don't see a darkness that pretends to be another darkness. You don't see a brightness that pretends to be another brightness. You don't see any light that pretends to be another light. You don't hear any noise that pretends to be another noise. You don't see a room that pretends to be another room (1969:Io). Herbert Blau (perhaps with Handke's utopian project in mind) has written: "Consider simply an object in front of your eyes: on stage it is no longer simple. A real chair used for a real chair in a 'realistic' setting remains though a real chair, a sign for a chair. It is what it is not, though it appears to be what it is" (1977:60). Is it ever possible to suspend this process of theatrical signification and representation? The time has come to examine what Derrida and Baudrillard themselves have to say about presence. Let's begin with Derrida's characterization of Artaud's proposal for a theatre of cruelty: The theatre of cruelty is not a representation [. . .]. Certainly, the stage will no longer represent, since it will not be added as a sensitive illustration to an already-written text, thought and lived outside of it and which it could only repeat [. . .]. It would no longer repeat a present, represent a present which would be elsewhere and before it, whose fullness would be older than its own [. ..] (1978:Io). In other words, Artaud sought a variety of presence, immanence, or sheer "thereness" which preexists and precludes the mediacy and vicariousness of representation. A representation cannot be fully "present" precisely because it signifies or alludes to something that isn't fully there, whose "real" existence lies elsewhere, beyond the confines of the stage. That explains why Derrida claims that Artaud's "Theatre of Cruelty" aspired toward a "closure of representation." The principle confusion of our time, wrote Artaud in The Theatre and Its Double, springs from "the rupture between things and words, between things and the ideas that are their representation." Artaud thus yearns to "return" to "a secret psychic impulse which is speech before words" (1958:7)-a set of Ur-sounds or primal screams in which signifier and signified are indivisible. Such "natu- ral" utterances are thought to be authentically and fully present, un- mediated by a preexisting, impersonal language or the acquired habits of culture. But as Brecht so well understood: "The union of the organs is the only union and it can never bridge the gap of speech" (in Brustein I964:247). (Note that for Brecht-as for Derrida-speech is no less "doubled," no less divisive, than writing.) Artaud's quest for the natural, his sentimental primitivism (e.g., his</page><page sequence="9">36 Presence of Mediation panegyrics about Balinese dance or the peyote dance of the Tarahumara) is a prime example of the impulse Derrida attacks in his twin critique of Rousseau and Levi-Strauss: Non-European peoples were not only studied as the index to a hid- den good Nature, as a native soil recovered, of a "zero degree" with reference to which one could outline the structure, the growth, and above all the degradation of our society and our culture. As always, this archaeology is also a teleology and an eschatology; the dream of a full and immediate presence closing history [. . .] the suppression of contradiction and difference (1976:114-15). But this of course is precisely the sort of closure or full, living presence that Derrida (and less explicitly Baudrillard) dismisses as unattainable. We can't "return" to such a state because it never existed. Presence for Derrida is always shot through and tarnished with traces of absence, of that which is somewhere else. And here his prose-as so often happens with him- gets too convoluted for its own good. So bear with me (or him): Through the sequence of supplements there emerges a law: that of an endless linked series, ineluctably multiplying the supplementary mediations that produce the sense of the very thing that they defer: the impression of the thing itself, of immediate presence, or origi- nary perception. Immediacy is derived. Everything begins with the intermediary [. . .] (1976:226). Derrida is saying in effect that there's no such thing as a preverbal or nonverbal state of perception, that consciousness is always characterized by the mediacy of linguistic structure. Hence the distinctive brilliance of Handke's assault on representation in Offending the Audience: He doesn't aspire to a nonverbal state of "pure" perception-as in, say, Robert Wilson's Deafinan Glance (1970). (In the original version of Handke's Kaspar (1968), the title character declares, "I have been sentenced to reality.") Thus in Offending the Audience, Handke uses sentences against themselves, in the hope of holding representation temporarily at bay. But if authentic presence implies an absence of representation, then Baudrillard's doctrine of simulationism carries this critique of presence a step further: "The very definition of the real has become: that of which it is possible to give an equivalent reproduction [. . .]. The real is not only what can be reproduced, but that which is always already reproduced" (1983:4). If Derrida's linguistic denial of presence remains abstract and untestable, Baudrillard's vision of the hyperreal is all too concrete and easy to observe: "Watch the Farrah Lookalike Make a Real Drug Bust" is the title of a 1989 article in TV Guide. The subject is a "nonfiction" television series called "Cops" in which real-life police officers are purportedly filmed in the course of their duties. But the "real drug bust" is conducted by a cop who was singled out by the producers of the series because she resembles a television personality who first came to national attention while portraying a fictional detective. Baudrillard would probably say that the "real" policewoman on "Cops" will strike us as "authentic" to the extent that she resembles-or reminds us of-Farrah Fawcett. Of course it hardly comes as news to learn that we live in a society which often prefers images to firsthand experience. We all know what happens</page><page sequence="10">Roger Copeland 37 when one's kids visit the Grand Canyon after seeing Technicolor images of it in glossy nature documentaries: it disappoints. One need only recall the old joke about the proud couple who, upon being told how beautiful their baby is, reply, "Oh that's nothing, you should see her photograph." Daniel Boorstein cites that joke in his marvelous book The Image (1961) which complains about the ever-increasing number of "pseudo-events" that have infiltrated the presumably nonfictional media: presidential "photo opportunities," political demonstrations that don't get underway until the news media arrives, etc. In recent years, pseudo-events have played an increasingly prominent role in television news. During the sum- mer of '89 for example, ABC's "World News Tonight" broadcast footage (only belatedly identified as a simulation) which purported to show Felix Bloch, a former State Department employee, hand delivering top secret documents to a Soviet agent. Cross-hairs were superimposed on the screen to make it appear as if the grainy footage was shot by a government surveillance team. But Boorstein is determined to separate the newsworthy wheat from the prefabricated, camera-ready chaff; he wants to rescue the real from a flood of hyperbolic simulacra. Baudrillard is infinitely more pessimistic. In his scenario, we're no longer capable of ferreting out a reality which precedes the (hyper-real) image of reality. The basic relation between the map and the territory has changed: "The territory no longer precedes the map, nor survives it. Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory [. . .] it is the map that engenders the territory" (1983:2). To simulate, he argues, is not simply to feign: someone who feigns an illness can simply go to bed and make believe he is ill. Someone who simulates an illness produces in himself some of the symptoms. Thus, feigning or dis- simulating leaves the reality principle intact: the difference is always clear, it is only masked; whereas simulation threatens the difference between "true" and "false," between "real" and "imaginary." Since the simulator produces "true" symptoms, is he ill or not? (1983:5). And that's why Baudrillard claims that contemporary reality is never un- mediated, that it is "always already reproduced." Baudrillard, one sus- pects, would have been amused by the earnest chorus of disapproval which greeted ABC's Felix Bloch simulation. For Baudrillard, most of what the nightly news routinely broadcasts is already, in some sense, simulated. A great many playwrights have dealt with the way in which dramatic characters have been mediated (or infiltrated) by mass media: Sam Shepard's Miss Scoons (in Angel City, 1976) exclaims: "I look at the screen and I am the screen. I'm not me. I don't know who I am. I look at the movie and I am the movie. [. . .] For days I am the star and I'm not me" (21). (Jean Claude van Itallie's TV [1966] dramatizes the blurring of boundaries between the two sides of the television screen: those who watch are literally absorbed into what they watch.) The quintessential example of the way in which mediated images are absorbed-as if by osmosis-comes in Heathcote Williams' AC/DC (I970). A certifiably schizophrenic charac- ter named Maurice declares, "I was picking up tv programmes in my head like a Jew's Harp. [. . .] every time I kissed Perowne I was forced to desalivate because of course Perowne didn't want David Niven's style of kissing" (197o:61). Baudrillard, in his essay "The Ecstasy of Communication," sees schizo- phrenia as the inevitable result of our current situation in which the body</page><page sequence="11">38 Presence of Mediation becomes an extension of the television screen. Telecommunications, ironi- cally, are too present. Baudrillard speaks of this state of terror proper to the schizophrenic: too great a proximity of everything, the unclean promiscuity of everything which touches, invests and penetrates without resistance, with no halo of private protection, not even his own body to protect him anymore [... .]. It is the end of interiority and intimacy, the overexposure and trans- parence of the world which traverses him without obstacle [ .. .]. He is now a pure screen, a switching center for all the networks of influence (1985:132-33). Presence and the Visual Arts So the critique of presence we find in the work of Derrida and Baudril- lard would seem to hinge on the concept of representation. Pure presence thus implies nothing less than the defeat of representation. Significantly, one of the most influential late-'6os manifestos on behalf of pure presence also called for the defeat of theatricality. I refer to Michael Fried's highly polemical defense of modernist painting, "Art and Objecthood": "I want to claim that it is by virtue of their presentness and instantaneousness that modernist painting and sculpture defeat theatre," declared Fried (1968: 146). (Theatre for Fried is synonymous with-among other evils- temporality or duration; modernist painting is presumably experienced in a moment of pure presentness: "It is as though one's experience of [mod- ernist painting] has no duration-not because one in fact experiences a Noland or Olitski [ .. .] in no time at all, but because at every moment the work itself is wholly manifest" [I968:I451). Stanley Cavell in The World Viewed offered a valuable gloss on Fried's essay. Generalizing about the formalist painting that self-consciously ac- knowledges its two dimensionality, Cavell maintained that "its flatness, together with its being of a limited extent, means that it is totally there, wholly open to you, absolutely in front of your senses, of your eyes as no other form of art is." Flatness is essential to this sort of presence because "total thereness can be taken as a denial of (physical) spatiality, of what three-dimensional creatures who normally walk or sit or turn mean by spatiality. What is in three-dimensional space is not all there to the eyes, in the sense revealed" (1971:I09). This implies that no human being-certainly no performer-will ever be as fully "present" to us as a formalist painting by Frank Stella or Morris Louis. By contrast, minimalist sculpture according to Fried is tainted by theatricality because its "quality of having an inside" makes it "almost blatantly anthropomorphic" (1968:I29). Clement Greenberg, who sired this obsession with two dimensionality, also uses an antitheatrical analogy to sum up the differences between classical and modernist painting: From Giotto to Courbet, the painter's first task had been to hollow out an illusion of three dimensional space on a flat surface. One looked through this surface as through a proscenium into a stage. Modernism has rendered this stage shallower and shallower until now its backdrop has become the same as its curtain which has now become all that the painter has left to work on (1961:I136).</page><page sequence="12">Roger Copeland 39 The curtain functions as a metaphor for the process of alternately revealing and concealing-"now you see it and now you don't"-whereas mod- ernism is envisioned as an act of "unconcealment." Of course, the theatre has traditionally considered it a strength rather than a weakness to conceal as much as it reveals. Hamlet articulates a truth about all great dramatic characters when he declares, "I have that within which passeth show." It's a function of his psychological complexity that he's not all there, spread out on the surface, like a modernist painting. ("You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery," complains Hamlet to Rosen- crantz and Guildenstern.) By contrast, Frank Stella affirmed his own com- mitment to Greenbergian (and Friedian) presence when he said of his paintings that "only what can be seen is there" (in Glaser 1968:158). Fried's conception of presence is antitheatrical in another sense as well: it deplores the reciprocity between performer and audience which figures so prominently in theatrical definitions of presence. "Theater has an audi- ence-it exists for one-in a way the other arts do not. In fact, this more than anything else is what modernist sensibility finds intolerable in theater generally," notes Fried (1968:140). Again, accusing certain modes of min- imalist sculpture of "theatricality," Fried writes: [Such] work depends on the beholder, is incomplete without him; it has been waiting for him. And once he is in the room the work refuses, obstinately, to let him alone-which is to say, it refuses to stop confronting him, distancing him, isolating him. (Such isolation is not solitude any more than such confrontation is communion) (1968:140). Fried could of course be talking about the Living Theatre in Paradise Now where the performers often refused to take no for an answer, where they refused to stop confronting (and no doubt, in many cases, unintentionally distancing and isolating members of the audience). And for Fried, this is the very antithesis of presence. Theatre of Mediation So it's far from clear that theatre ever was the sole or essential repository of presence. And as we've seen in recent years, the very notion of presence, whether in Artaud's "speech before words," or Stella's attempt to banish "content"-and thus representation-from painting, has come under at- tack. Indeed, in the age of Derrida and Baudrillard, Greenberg and Fried have become men the art world loves to hate. Presence, purity, instanta- neousness, anti-illusionism have all beaten a hasty retreat. Now there's a high premium placed on mixing the visual and the verbal, the spatial and the temporal. (One need only think of Jenny Holzer's verbal aphorisms snaking their way across electronic billboards.) But has a body of work appeared that embodies what Thomas Kuhn (1962) would call a paradigm shift in regard to the centrality of presence in the arts? Certainly in the visual arts, the doctrine of "simulationism" is reflected in a wide variety of works ranging from Sherrie Levine's appro- priations of Walker Evans or Edward Weston to Mike Bidlo's meticulous copies of Picasso. Peter Halley's "neo-GEO" recycles geometric motifs from the formalist paintings of the 1960s and redeploys them in a "repre-</page><page sequence="13">40 Presence of Mediation sentational" manner. These are art works that, in Baudrillard's terms, have been "already reproduced." But in the theatre, the assault on presence is best illustrated by one of my original examples, Foreman's What Did He See, where the use of microphones and Plexiglas reflected a fundamental and ever increasing fact of contemporary life: its mediation by media. Similarly, Mabou Mines' Wrong Guys (1981), a theatrical dissection of male bonding in hard-boiled detective fiction, also utilized body mikes for purposes of mediation rather than amplification. Laurie Anderson's "vocoder" is an electronic filter than transforms her light, flat voice into a variety of vocal personae that include a deep, throaty rasp. The resulting Is-it-live-or-is-it-Memorex uncertainty creates an ambiguous form of presence that seems both spontaneous and prerecorded at the same time. In the Wooster Group's Route 1 &amp; 9 (1981) two white actresses dialed tele- phone calls to what sounded like actual restaurants, and-in broad, Amos n' Andy accents-claimed they wanted to order fried chicken for a birth- day party. The audience had no way of knowing whether these conversa- tions were live or prerecorded (for that matter, whether those on the other end of the line were unrehearsed employees of an actual restaurant or actors impersonating them). But in any event, the quality of the sound was unmistakably mediated, as if we'd picked up another phone extension or tapped into the line. In other words, the voices that we hear no longer pretend to be directly or immediately "present" to us. A number of performances are explicitly about technological mediation. Lee Breuer/Mabou Mines' A Prelude to Death in Venice (1979) depicted a character whose relationship with the outside world is doubly mediated: Bill Raymond spoke through a ventriloquist's dummy whose only contact with other characters was over the telephone. Laurie Anderson's talk-song parable "New York Social Life" is about life lived entirely on the tele- phone. And much of her work explores the unintended irony in Ma Bell's insistent urging that we use the telephone to "reach out and touch some- one." (Anderson is particularly fascinated by the ways in which communi- cations technology, which purports to bring us closer together-as members of a "global village"-'actually increases our sense of social isolation.) On one level these artists are simply acknowledging the fact that, like it or not, technological mediation has become an inescapable part of our lives. Most of what we claim to know about the world is acquired vicari- ously or secondhand. We rely on television and other mass communica- tions media to inform us of the public events that shape our collective consciousness. But we have no way of confirming the reality of these events with our own senses. The "instant replay" must be identified as such if we're to distinguish it from the televised "original." (Consider how frequently the word "simulation" appears on the screen when television covers a major space shot.) Some years ago a film called Capricorn I pro- posed the following scenario: An ambitious U.S. space mission goes hay- wire; fearful of losing its congressional funding, NASA simulates the rest of the mission in a television studio. And it seems entirely appropriate, in the age of simulationism, to have learned that a quintessential instance of 1960s "authenticity"-'the leap that's photographed in Yves Klein's Leap into the Void-turns out to have been faked. Ironically, there's no reason to believe that "being there" is always pref- erable to the omniscient detachment provided by advanced technology. Certainly we've all had the experience of watching on television as a gov- ernmental official arrives in some distant land.

(Photo by Terry O'Reilly) video technology, it's not uncommon for the news anchor in New York or Washington to have a better view of who's getting off the plane than the poor "eyewitness" reporter there on the ground. And we shouldn't be too quick to assume that Baudrillard puts the final nail in the coffin of Artaudian ambition. Holographically projected, com- puter-generated images in three dimensions may well provide the only means of effectively realizing Artaud's Jet of Blood (1925), Strindberg's A Dream Play (1902), or for that matter, Heiner Mfiller's Hamletmachine (1977). Perhaps the era of the totally persuasive technological simulation (in which the perceivable difference dissolves between "the thing itself" and its representation in the form of images) is what Artaud was really seeking all the while. After all, this is precisely the way secular, "scientifi- cally" minded people have always viewed the ritualistic state of conscious- ness: Some sort of mind-altering experience (psychotropic drugs, hypnotically repetitive sounds and movement patterns) manages to blur the distinction between images and the "realities" they allude to. Isn't this what Jane Ellen Harrison meant when she distinguished between ritualistic re-presentation and theatrical representation? In other words, the partici- pants of rituals presumably "re-live" rather than merely represent, act out,</page><page sequence="15">42 Presence of Mediation or "impersonate" events of mythological or religious significance. Listen to what Karl Young has to say (in his book Drama of the Medieval Stage) about the absence of theatrical representation in the Catholic Mass: The impossibility of there being impersonation in the liturgy of the Eucharist arises from the fact that since the early Christian centuries this rite has been regarded as a true sacrifice. The central act is de- signed not to represent or portray or merely commemorate the crucifixion, but actually to repeat it (1933:81). To the secular skeptic, indeed to anyone other than the true believer, this amounts to a well-executed con job, a successful act of "simulation," which in this context is not generically different from Baudrillard's techno- logical substitution (transubstantiation?) of signifier for signified. Perhaps ritualistic re-presentation (or the illusion of such) is the only real alternative to representation. And yet . .. there's a big difference between belief and a suspension (willing or unwilling) of disbelief. Actually believing that one has returned to the "origin" is quite different from knowing, or even suspecting, that one can no longer distinguish between the original and a reproduction. But one thing is certain: The balance between what we glean about the world directly through our senses and what we absorb vicariously through the media has been irreversibly tipped in the direction of the latter. And to assume that a few hours of "live" theatre will somehow restore a healthy sense of "being there" is naive and self-deceptive. The ongoing critique of theatrical presence is also valuable insofar as it reminds us that no experi- ence (no matter how "live") is entirely unmediated. The "copy theory of knowledge" was invalidated long ago. The innocent eye never existed. Furthermore, the idea that the theatre's "liveness" is-in and of itself-a virtue, a source of automatic, unearned moral superiority to film and television, is sheer bourgeois sentimentality. In Film Is Evil, Radio is Good (1987) Richard Foreman chose to champion radio rather than "live theatre" as an alternative to the treacherously deceptive "realism" of the cinematic image. (One should also note that the only event in recent years to engen- der the sort of physicalized "audience participation" we associate with the Living Theatre of the late '6os was a cult film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show.) Presence and the Plague It's one of the supreme ironies of Artaud that his major conceits exist essentially as literary metaphors. And his most potent metaphor for the state or pure immanence or presentness is the plague. He credits it with reinventing "necessity" and with obsessively focusing the attention of its victims on the here and now: "The plague is a superior disease because it is a total crisis after which nothing remains except death or an extreme purification" (I958:3I). These words are not easy to stomach in the age of AIDS. Real plagues, we now know, are the enemy of presence. And even if Derrida's and Baudrillard's critiques of presence didn't exist, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome might well have invented it. One of the farthest reaching consequences of AIDS is that we will never again be fully present to one another. Fear of AIDS has robbed us of the ultimate and most desired form of presence: the orgasmic fuckrush, which obliter- ates our awareness of anything other than the present. But now sex is</page><page sequence="16">Roger Copeland 43 saturated with an intensified consciousness of both past and future ("How many other people has s/he slept with?" "Have I become infected? And if so, how long will the virus remain latent?"). Perhaps we should paraphrase Brecht's adage to read, "The union of the organs is the only union and it can never bridge the gap of fear."
