<plain_text><page sequence="1">SITUATION-AND-GOAL SET BY R. S. WOODWORTH, Columbia University Editor, Archives of PsychologJo (Founded in I906) No system of psychology can be accepted as adequate if it fails to do justice to two very obvious facts, which may be roughly designated as the space-span and the time-span of behavior. Their genuineness is attested by introspective as well as objective data. The idea intended by the catchword ''space-span'' is more fully expressed by saying that the organism deals with external objects and events. Dealing with objects is certainly characteristic of man and the higher animals, whose behavior is nicely adjusted to the size, shape, distance, color, weight, and other physical characteristics of the objects. With visual presentation they recognize the same size at different distances, the same shape at different angles, the same physical color under different illuminations; and man at least can recognize hardness, roughness, heaviness, and other physical characteristics through the tactual and kinesthetic senses. We hear "the water running," smell "the fumes from the furnace,'' feel in our head ''the elevator starting or stop- ping.'' It is very difficult by introspection to detect the cues of these various objective facts. Binocular disparity, so valuable a cue of dis- tance, is almost unobservable in ordinary vision. The binaural time difference (0.03 ms.) which can serve as a cue that the source of sound is slightly to the right or left of the median plane is far too small to be observed on its own account. Stimulus-characteristics which cannot be directly observed may thus serve as excellent cues of objective facts. Both perception and motor behavior often correspond better with the objective facts than with the stimuli received. In the reception and utilization of a stimu]us other factors besides that particular stimulus must be operating, and their locus of operation must be in the brain rather than in the sense organs. Without attempting to evaluate the contribution of experience to the perception of size, distance, shape or color, we simply stress the point that the central factor operates in the process of perception itself and not in superadded higher proc- esses. 130</page><page sequence="2">131 SITUATION-AND-GOAL SET Consider for a moment the perception of object color. A white object is seen as white even when it stands in a moderate shadow. Its albedo, the ratio of reflected to incident light, may be 80So, and this albedo is perceived as such, though roughly. If A=albedo, M=intensity of illumination, and S= intensity of the reflected light which reaches the eye, we have the equation, A=S/M. What the observer does, in effect, is to End A when S and M are given. He solves the equation in some direct, non-mathematical way. S is directly given, and M is given by cues of illumination, especially by the depth of the shadow. Let us assume, what is probable, that perception of the situation in general, including the illumination and the shadow, have a slight priority in time over perception of the shaded object; then we can say that the observer is adjusted to M when he receives S. He receives S into a mechanism already adjusted to M, and, therefore, the equation is solved in the very process of reception and A is directly perceived. There need be nothing mysterious in this notion of a central adjust- ment for illumination. The iris adjusts itself to the total illumination and so is a factor in determining the amount of light received by the retina from any given object. The retina adapts itself to light and dark. These peripheral ad justments have been shown to be inadequate to account for the facts of color constancy and there must be some important adjustment further back in the optic path. In the same way we can write an equation connecting the size of an object, its distance from the eye, and the size of the retinal image or stimulus. If the observer is adjusted to the spatial situation in general, including the distance of the object, then retinal size will directly . * . mean o zjectlve slte. The fact that these ''constancies" are never perfect can mean either or both of two things. The adjustments are imperfect, or there is a sensory impression corresponding directly to the retinal stimulus and not affected by the cerebral adjustment to the objective situation. A white under good illumination may look no whiter or only a little whiter than when seen in shadow, yet it does not look the same. In a good light it gives a stronger or more insistent impression. I will not attempt here to compare this conception of illumination set with the somewhat similar concepts used by Katz, Gelb, Thouless, Kardos, and Koffka in explaining the facts of color constancy. There are many other examples, such as the different ways in which the alarm clock is heard when one is awake or asleep, which show the dependence of perception upon one's adjustment to the situation. I</page><page sequence="3">am more concerned to show that the satne general concept can be fruitfully applied in the Eeld of action and learning, where the time span of behavior creates the theoretical difficulty. Behavior as a continuous process should, of course, be describable in time units as short as you choose, a second or a millisecond, and what goes on in any millisecond must be the result of the forces, inter- nal and external, acting at just that time. For psychological purposes, wb are more apt to attempt a description in terms of stimulus-response units. Such a description is likely to become excessively schematic. For example, how shall we break up the horse's walking into a suc- cession of steps? The fore leg and hind leg steps overlap in time and this overlap shows that there is some unity persisting for longer than a single step. The eye-voice span in reading aloud affords a well recorded example of overlapping processes in a behavior sequence. I The eyes keep several words ahead of the voice, a variable number, about four or five words on the average in a good reader. The socal response of pronouncing a word follows the foveal stimulus received from that word by all interval of one or two seconds, which is three to six times the reaction- time in reading single familiar words. While one word is being pro- nounced another word is being seen and intervening words are going through the mill. No real sequence of stimulus-response units can be analyted out of this behavior; the time-span greatly exceeds that of a single reaction and is evidently determined by a central factor. By holding his voice back in this way, the reader secures more continuity, better phrasing and expression, than if he responded to each word separately with his normal reaction-time. Much simpler two-phase movements, like striking a blow with a hammer, show a smoothness which is very different from a sequence of tw-o separate movements. For a many-phase movement, observe the flight of a bird from a tree to a bit of food on the ground. He hops off, makes a number of strokes of the wings and passes smoothly into braking with his wings, extending his legs and landtng. There is a consistent and persistent steer throughout the performallce. If we wish to describe these polyphasic movements as sequences of stimulus- response units we can probably do so, but only on condition that we recognize a persistent steer set up by the original stimulus and con- 1 G.

This inner steer can be called a goal-set or goal-adjustment. Just as the concept of situation-setXincludirg adjustment to illumi- nation and distance is useful in explaining the perception of objects out there as distinguished from stimuli received, so in describing motor behavior, the notion of goal set is a conceptual means of taking scare of the time-span. The goal need be nothing more distant than the outcome of a two-phase movement. Goal seeking in its lowest terms is the following of a consistent temporal pattern under the control of . . a perslstlng set. Situation-set and goal-set are presumably not separate, especially in the more primitive types of behavior. The situation for which one is adjusted usually includes a goal, since the organism is active and engaged in behavior having a time-span greater than that of a simple reaction. If we conceive of an undifferentiated situation-and-goal-set, we avoid the apparent anthropomorphism of attributing rudimentary cognition and goal seeking to animals. The cognition implied in sit- uation-set is not separated from doing, and the goal seeking does not imply ideational anticipation of the goal since the goal is right there in the presented situation. I will not pause to defend the notion of set in general; it has a long and honorable history. I do not see that set is a non-operational and unmanageable concept in the laboratory. Instructions, situations, and goal-objects presented, and skilled treatment of the subjects can be depended on to arouse and maintain the necessary internal adjust- ment. A set is a type of implicit response to complexes of stimuli from the environment. The words 'set' and 'adjustment' are not exactly appropriate since set carries a false suggestion of rigidity and adjust- ment a false suggestion of quietude. In reality these sets are semi-fluid, and are revised from moment to moment in conformity with environ- mental changes. Adjustment to the environment is a readiness for ac- tion. Situation-and-goal-set is an activity in progress. The utility of this concept can be given a preliminary test by apply- ing it in different Eelds of psychology and noting whether it introduces clarity into already known results. My own Erst use of the concept was in 1906, when I was engaged in an introspective study of the immediate antecedents of a voluntary movement.2 It was, in a sense, a study of the delayed reaction. A short delay was introduced between 2 R. S. Woodworth, The cause of a voluntary movement, Studics in Philosophy and Psy- chohJy by Former Studcnts of Charles Edward Garman, I906, 389 ff. 133 SITUATION-AND-GOAL SET</page><page sequence="5">134 WOODWORTH the decision to make a certain movement and the execution of that movement. Either the subject was told what movement to make or he was given his choice between two or more. FIe was to report his "condition of mind'' in the short interval of delay. There were two types of reports which seemed trustworthy as well as instructive. Both types are included in the report of one subject on his preparation to hit at a mark. First the chosen mark became focal and then retreated to the background, to be succeeded by thought of the chosen hand; this in turn retreated to the background leaving a rather blank condi- tion of readiness, and the actual movement emerged out of this blank condition. The two points of interest are: (1) that the act was speciSed in a series of perceptions or thoughts, the partial specifications holding over after once being made; and (2) that the act once speciSed by these perceptions or thoughts remained speciSed during a blank period immediately preceding the movement. In discussing these reports, I said: The nervous system may become set or adjusted for a certain act, and remain so for a time without the continuance of clear consciousness of the act.... The whole situation, as far as it is known, results in a certain adjustment of the nervous system, so that, for example, acts that would be performed while we are alone are not performed or thought of in public. Each sort of situation produces a corresponding set of the nervous system, and is thus a partial determinant of all the acts that are performed within that situation. When a man confronted by a novel situation observes this and that feature of it in turn, each new perception leaves behind in the nervous system a temporary adjustment to the feature observed, until the whole situation becomes-not clearly mirrored in any one moment of consciousness-but dynamically represented by the sum or resultant of these partial adjustments. If he then thinks of some change that he can make in the situation and decides to make it, . . . the intention to act adds a new partial adjustment to the . . , . extst1ng sum ot ac Justments. In revising the above statement to-day, I should want to say that the partial adjustments resulting from perception of features of the situation are not simply added together but are built into a preexisting framework of adjustment to the total situati-on. This adjustment is vague and general at first, and becomes more definite and speciEc as features of the situation are perceived. In the well-known experiments on delayed reaction, goal set is often visible in the persistent posture of the animal during the interval of delay. When the animal is able to move about during the interval and still go promptly to the right door or container, we have to sup- pose some kind of super-posture which amounts to a situation-and-goal set. We need not suppose that this set is ideational or symbolic. It</page><page sequence="6">need not in any degree resemble a map which the animal can carry away and consult elsewhere. It may be completely bound to the pre- sented situation. The set is not to be conceived as a sort of replica; it is not representative, though it corresponds to the situation more or less closely. It is only half of a functional unit, the other half being the actual situation. It is analogous to a resonator tuned to a certain pitch but emitting no sound unless vibrations of the correct frequency strike it. It cannot be identical with Koffka's ''behavioral environ- ment,"3 though there is some similarity between the two. For behav- ioral environment seems to be representative. Koffka says that in ex- ploration it is the behavioral environment that is explored. One can not conceive the situation set as being explored. It incorporates the results of exploration in a dynamic but not a pictorial form. The situation set, at Erst a bare framework, is ISlled in by explora- tion, including tentative manipulation by which mechanical charac- teristics of objects are revealed, such as weight, hardness, flexibility. The characters of objects, the make-up of the situation and the happen- ings that occur there become known, though this 'knowing' is non- ideational and wholly bound to the presented situation. Troland's conception of the retroflex is of great value in understand- ing both exploratory and goal seeking behavior.4 The eferent nerve current to the muscles is immediately followed by afferent currents, both from the kinesthetic end organs and also in most cases from dis- tance receptors, since most movements produce perceptible external effects. A behavior segment never terminates in a movement but always in sensory impulses resulting fronl the movement. Introspectively it is clear that we are almost never interested in the movement itself, as distinguished from the sensations of the movement and especially from the visible or othernvise discernible external consequences of the movement. Muscular contraction in itself is almost never a goal. The human subject is object-directed in his movements as well as in the reception of stimuli. The retroflex therefore consists not simply of sensory impressions but of objective facts perceived. In goal-directed movements the retroflex affords a check on their success or failure. It shows whether one has hit the mark at which the stone was aimed. The terminus ad quem of such a bit of behavior is obviously not the muscular contractions in the arm but the perceived objective results. Exploratory behavior is equally object-directed. A certain spot, ' Kurt lSoffka, Prinaiplcs of Gcstalt Psycholog)/, I935, t7, 37. 4 L. T. Troland, Thc Fgndamcntals of Human Motivation, I9 8, X I5 . 135 SITUATION-AND-GOAL SET</page><page sequence="7">within a place to which one is already adjusted in a general way, attracts the eyes, a saccadic movement gives foveal vision of that spot and reveals some character of the spot which is added as a detail to the situation set. Suppose the subject to be a rat, and let the spot be revealed as a hole: he thrusts his snout into it (tentative manipulation) and is blocked; the hole takes on a negative character, it is not a way out, and this negative character of the spot is incorporated into the situation set. Is it anthropomorphic to credit the rat, inveterate explorer that he is, with an object-directed attitude toward the situation explored? Certainly it would be more anthropomorphic to credit him with a stimulus-directed attitude such as human beings acquire only by train- ing in analysis of sensory complexes. It takes a trained artist to detect the stimulus-colors in a scene, whereas the child, the monkey, and even the fish respond correctly to the color of objects. In lifting a weight it is difficult to detect the sensory cues from skin, joints and muscles, but it is easy to observe the weight of the object. A psychologically unsophisticated rat would almost surely be object-directed. Since we know from the rat's behavior that he explores a locality and becomes adapted to it, it seems safe to assume that his exploration makes him acquainted with the place, his acquaintance being of the non-ideational type which we designate as situation set. If we are allowed to assume that the animal is object-directed and that exploration builds up in him a practical acquaintance with the presented situation? we shall End that many phenomena of animal learning fall readily into line. The "latent learning" which occurs when a rat runs a maze with no reward in the food box is readily understood as place learning. I will not review the evidence for place learning which I have summarized elsewhere.5 Mate learning is chiefly place learning. Once the character of each alley has been discovered and sufficiently drilled into the situation set, suitable locomotion follows as a matter of course. Flooding the maze or laming the animal may necessitate a change in the form of locomotion from running to swimming or rolling, but the right path is still follonved. In the problem box something more than place has to be learned; some mechanical device has to be manipulated and the character of this device must be discovered by trial manipulations. What is learned is not a particular muscular response to certain stimuli, but the character 5 R. S. Woodworth, Psycholop, 3rd ed., I934, zz6&lt;38. 136 WOODWORTII</page><page sequence="8">of a certain object. The door button becomes a thing to turn, or the downhanging string a thing to pull, with claws or teeth, it does not matter which. The law of effect gives some difficulty when the assumption is that a direct connection is formed or strengthened between a given stimulus and a certain motor response, as between the sight of the door button and some speciSc movement. Since the stimulus-response connection operates before the effect becomes manifest, how can the latter work back on the former? Thorndike has indeed shown that this apparent backward working is physiologically conceivable, but the matter be- comes simpler if we assume that the animal is object-directed. While exploring the cage the animal s?ies the door button; he claws at it and it moves. The fundamental problem in learning lies right here. Does the animal thus learn that the button is movable? I assume that this simple behavior sequence-seeing button, clawing it and getttng the retroflex of button movintyields a momentary acquaintance with that object, an acquaintance which may be strengthened by repetition. If so much as this is granted, the door-opening character of the button can be discovered by further manipulation. The character of goodness attaches for the animal not to his movements in manipulating the button but to the button as an object. There is no difficulty in Ending situation-and-goal set in the con- ditioned reflex experiment. Adjustment to the laboratory, to the harness, to the experimenter must Erst be secured. The animal must have explored enough to reach that state of "alert quiet" which Liddell and his coworkers End necessary for the success of the experi- ment.6 A metronome begins to tick; unless it is straight in front the animal turns his head and localizes the sound as something objective in the room. When it has ticked a few seconds, and probably before the animal's attention to it has quieted down, a shock supervenes, delivered by an electrode attached to the animal's foreleg. This being the first shock received, the response is violent and continued, but when the episode is over the animal resumes his alert quiet. After several repetitions of the same stimulus-pair, agitation starts at the sound of the metronome; the two stimuli and their responses have become integrated into a single behavior-pattern and are included in. its time-span. As the shock is after all not very dreadful and as it cannot be escaped, the whole behavior may become (though not in all 6 H. S. Liddell, W. T. James and 0. D.

Monog., II, I934, (no. 5I), I-89. 137 SITUATION-AND-GOAL SET</page><page sequence="9">138 WOODWORTH animals) much more matter-of-fact, and we then witness a very deEnite temporal pattern of behavior. At the sound of the metronomeX the animal raises head and ears, stiffens, half flexes the leg which is to receive the shock, receives the shock and flexes the leg completely, then replaces the leg on the floor and visibly relaxes. The animal has developed a deEnite adjustment to the metronome-shock sequence; he has built into his total situation set a speciSc adjustment to this feature of the situation; he has learned the 'character' of that metronome. If now an extinction experiment follows, the metronome ticking as before but the shock being omitted, the behavior pattern fades out with repeated trials. The situation has changed in one important particular and the animal has readjusted himself. The metronome has acquired the new character of not being followed by a shock. Our assumption can, it would seem, be subjected to experimental test in this case of the conditioned response. If the animal is object- directed, exceptionally quick conditioning should be obtained if the metronome sound (or butz or tone) were emitted by the electrode itself. We can also predict that "sensory generalization" could be readily obtained across modalities, if for example a sound and a light were emitted by the same object; and 'differentiation' between two such stimuli should be diicult to establish. Many interesting questions concerning this whole conception must be deferred for some future occasion. Ideation we can deEne as dealing with objects not present or situations not present. Since the details of a situation need not all be presented at the same instant (as shown by the delayed response) we can readily believe that a situation set can be reinstated by relatively few cues. We could probably End transitional cases between sets that are rigidly bound to the presented situation and those which are revived in the absence of the situation by verbal cues. The origin of situation set in the life history of the individual is a matter for investigation. Our assumption is that the object-directed attitude is a fundamental bent of the individual and that it is the main function of the cerebrum. The existence of an external world does not have to be forced upon the child; he is a native realist from the start. One of the frst characteristics of the world which the child explores is the gravitational, and it is interesting to reflect that the fundamental utdown dimension must be for him, in view of his manifold positions, environmental and not intraorganic. Adults think of their head as up, feet as down, but this is not characteristically true of the child who is</page><page sequence="10">beginning his acquaintance with the world. The child does not 'pro- ject' the utdown dimension from his organism into the world, but finds it in his relations with the environtent. The concept of situation-and-goal set lends itself to the study of maladjustment and disorientation. The individual is not an unbiased registering instrument, and his adjustment may be more in tune with his own drives, preferences and goals than with the ob jective situation. No system of psychology, as far as I know, has made explicit use of the concept of situation-set. It has seemed absurd to bring the external world into a psychological system except as the source of stimuli and the catch-all of responses. My contention is that the environment must be brought into the center of the system, as a cerebral or organismic set, in order to describe, let alone explain, behavior and thought. Existing systems have not succeeded in their descriptions except by tacitly assuming an object-directed attitude in the subject, even when they ruled this attitude out of their systems. Titchener's judgment in the matter is well known: "It is natural and customary to think, not of mental processes, but of the things and events about us, while it is, as I believe, absolutely necessary to get rid of things, and to think only of the mental processes, if we are to have a science of psychology. "7 He trained his observers to report only "content" or "process," and not meaning and ob jective reference. But the observers found it difficult to give a coherent report of their thought processes without telling what they had thought about. Titchener therefore made a concession: meanings might be reported, provided they were sharply distinguished from content. 8 From a very different angle, certainly, Hunter also formally dis- cards the environment: "Nowhere does the anthroponomist study the subject's environment except as a possible source of stimuli for the subject's behavior."9 Yet practically all descriptions of behavior are couched in terms of objects and what the subject does with them. Is this type of description adopted simply to avoid the pedantic circum- locution of referring continually to the detailed stimuli and muscular contractions, or is there not a tacit and inevitable assumption that the animal is dealing with the environment? It might seem that situation-set would be an acceptable concept to 7 E. B.

SITUATION-AND-GOAL SET</page><page sequence="11">140 WOODWORTH the Gestalt psychology; but it is really inconsistent with emphasis on the fundamental role of the stimulus-pattern or of organization in the visual Eeld. The common luan as he looks about is not interested in configurations but in objects, not in the visual Seld but in the objective Seld. We scarcely realize how little stability or practical signiScance inheres in the stimulus-pattern. Let us permit our observer to remove his head from the chin rest and to move freely about the room; or let the observer be a child on a visit, playing in a strange yard. As he in- spects the interesting objects from various angles, and runs all around the yard, his visual pattern is changing from moment to moment. The succession of his visual Selds would make a surprising motion picture. But this continual flux does not confuse the observer. He soon knows the location of the important objects and is quite at home. What he has built up is certainly not a stable visual configuration; it is a set for . . . . t. le o rlectlve sltuatlon. A fundamental principle of Gestalt psychology, as I understand, is that organization in a sensory Xeld is only secondarily controlled by central factors; fundamentally it is impressed upon the field by the stimulus-pattern. A situation-set, however, is already present whenever any stimulus-pattern is received. The stimulus-pattern must St into the framework provided by the situation-set, though it may to be sure cause that set to be revised. The central ob ject-directed factor is primary. The foregoing discussion is offered as a contribution to a movement in progress. Many psychologists have expressed somewhat the same ideas in different form. I hesitate to make a hasty list of them for fear of omitting some who should certainly be included.</page></plain_text>
