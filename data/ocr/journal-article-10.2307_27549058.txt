<plain_text><page sequence="1">D. H. LAWRENCE: "A PASSIONATELY RELIGIOUS MAN" MARK KINKEAD-WEEKES TOO many people nowadays, asked what they associate with D. H. Lawrence, will probably reply (if anything) Lady Chatterleys Lover, whose unbanning seems in retro spect to have signaled the coming of the permissive society and the sexual revolution of the 1960s. But what Lawrence reminded Katherine Mansfield of, as she saw him board a boat with floppy hat and knapsack, was Saint Paul setting off for Macedonia; and Lawrence was certainly, on a scale of one to ten, seven degrees closer to Saint Paul than to Hugh Heffner and the culture of Playboy, which he would have excoriated with jeremiad vigor. Though he rejected the Christian creed at the age of twenty-two when at university, he went on wrestling imaginatively and emotionally with the significance of Christ for the rest of his life; and his description of himself in 1914 as "a passionately religious man," whose work "must be written from the depth of my religious experience," was not only true of that time but provided a constant criterion against which to measure the value and seriousness of his work?including Lady Chatterleys Lover. To try to define his religion is complicated?like most ques tions about him?by the fact that there were several remark ably different "Lawrences" appearing at different times of his life. Indeed his revolutionary fiction began from his rejection of what he called "the old stable ego" of nineteenth-century thought and literature, and his insistence that, on the con trary, human beings are constantly fluctuating and changeful, driven by impulses deeper than their knowing. Indeed he came to believe that change was the very principle of life, and what was static was dead. Moreover, like Blake, he thought growth came about through "contraries" in conflict, ? 2001 by Mark Kinkead-Weekes</page><page sequence="2">380 D. H. LAWRENCE a continual process or dialectic of antitheses. Any sentence beginning "D. H. Lawrence" needs immediately to specify which Lawrence one is talking about and when?needing time as well as complication if one wants an accurate overall view. So, rather than trying to trace the whole complex de velopment of his religious experience, I shall confine myself here to his wrestling with the significance of Christ, and do so by selecting just a few of what seem the most significant mo ments at four antithetical stages?with only a sketchy outline of what lay between. David Herbert Richards Lawrence was the youngest son of a coal miner, whose wife thought herself superior to the world she had married into. She wanted her children to fulfill aspirations thwarted in herself, and she taught them to hate and despise their father. The sickly but clever boy won a scholarship to the high school in Nottingham, but he had to leave at sixteen to work in a factory and help support his mother. He was able later, however, to study as a pupil teacher at one of the new part-time centers, where he won a king's scholarship to Nottingham University College, and he then became a qualified schoolteacher in London. Lawrence was an early instance of how changes in education after the great Education Act had opened new horizons to working class children, at the cost of estranging them from their back grounds. A central part of Lawrence's background was the Congre gational church and the culture which sprang from it. In a late essay, "Hymns in a Man's Life," he sharply distinguishes Congregationalism from the more emotional fundamentalist and revivalist nonconforming sects, and their insistent ques tion Are you saved? ("How can one save one's soul?" retorts the later Lawrence. "One can only live one's soul. The busi ness is to live, really alive.") The Eastwood Chapel and its spire had a beauty very different from the barnlike Primitive Methodist and Pentecostal buildings. And though its members took part in common nonconformist organizations such as the Band of Hope (the temperance association in which all the young Lawrences were emphatically enrolled by their</page><page sequence="3">MARK KINKEAD-WEEKES 381 mother), Christian Endeavour, and others, the Congrega tional chapel was also the hub of a wider social and intellec tual life, spreading from Sunday school and Bible study, through magic-lantern shows, talks and recitation sessions for the children, to the morning and evening services ( at which the minister would preach on a wide range of questions with a high intellectual content) and the Chapel Literary Society on Monday evenings, with talks about travel and geography, science, politics, and theology as well as literature. There were also debates, slide shows, concerts, and recitals, and after each event a gathering of friends for discussion, so that "cha pel" became a center of social life. The young Lawrence grew up soaked in the Bible, its stories, characters, and cadences, all of which he continued to draw on richly throughout his writing life. "Hymns in a Man's Life" bears witness to his abiding love of the hymns he used to sing as he did housework on three continents?"Sun of my Soul, my Saviour dear"; "Angels Ever Bright and Fair"; "Throw Out the Life Line"; "Fair Waved the Golden Corn"?and the essay tells how these helped to awaken in his childhood the sense of wonder which he thought to be the essence of religion. Though he broke with the nonconformist morality he had been taught, he never ceased to believe that both good life and good art were es sentially moral, in a different but not less puritan way. The young man s problems with Christianity were partly youthful rebellion, partly the impact of a ferment of "mod ern" ideas, but much deeper than both of these ran the "prob lem of pain," undermining belief in a personal, loving, and omnipotent deity, together with an inability to experience the Holy Spirit. The rebel can be seen in an account by David Chambers of how on one occasion young Bert?despite his underlying respect for the Rev. Robert Reid, who seems to have deserved it?shocked his friends and his mother by breaking out in fierce denunciation of chapel and a savage takeoff of its minister. It was in earnest, however, that, after lively discussions with the group of young people to whom he was closest, he undertook to write and ask the minister what the attitude of the church now was to miracles, the Virgin</page><page sequence="4">382 D. H. LAWRENCE Birth, the Atonement, the divinity of Jesus, and the theory of evolution. "Reading of Darwin, Herbert Spencer, Renan, J. M. Robertson, Blatchford and Vivian in his Churches and Mod ern Thought," he wrote, "has seriously modified my religious beliefs." He had no time for J. R. Campbell's New Theology and its attempt to blend modern rationalism with "a nebulous atmosphere of religious yearning"?he thought Campbell "practically an agnostic." Nor was he responsive to anti Christian or materialist polemic. He wanted a serious Chris tian answer. But when he got it, in the form of four evening sermons by Reid on religion and evolution, these failed to lay his doubts to rest because?as he realized?his deepest ques tions were actually anterior to the ones he had raised. His second letter is much more personal, indeed confessional; and in it he puts his finger on his inability to believe in God the Father or in the divinity of Christ, and confesses himself un able to experience the Holy Spirit. He cannot believe in a per sonal, loving, and omnipotent God who would permit the in justices and cruelties of the world. He cannot reconcile any such idea with the terrible slums he had walked through daily in Nottingham ( or with the recent death of his sister Emily's baby, which upset him greatly). He cannot believe either in the divinity of Christ, nor that Christ's brief ministry and death could atone for 1900 years of brutality and dreadful suffering. On the other hand, he "cannot be a materialist." He neither hates Christianity nor will "wage any war against it"? but for him "these questions will not be answered." Above all Lawrence knows what spiritual conversion should be, and he has hoped that the Holy Spirit would descend and take pos session of his soul?but however much he longed for this and tried to give himself, the possession never happened, and he could never understand how to achieve the giving. At his most emotional moments "myself has watched myself and seen that all the tumult has risen like a little storm and died away with out great result." If he has been reborn it is into consciousness of human pain, and desire to change its causes. The young schoolteacher would have described himself as a socialist? and soon he would be reading Nietzsche in the Croydon li</page><page sequence="5">MARK KINKEAD-WEEKES 383 brary, reinforcing his own critique of Christianity and feeling for new modes of thought. When his youngest sister, Ada, was going through a similar disturbance several years later, he tried to summarize where he himself had come in relation to Christianity. "Jehovah is the Jew's idea of God?not ours. Christ was infinitely good, but mortal as we. There still re mains a God, but not a personal God: a vast shimmering im pulse which wavers on to some end, I don't know what?tak ing no regard for the little individual, but taking regard for humanity. . . . Whatever name one gives Him, in worship we all strive towards the same God . . . we all stretch our hands in the same direction. What does it matter, the name we cry." But by that time (April 1911) Lawrence had gotten into a personal mess, both before and after the death in December 1910 of the mother who had been the center of his life. This will have to be one of my brief transitions, since I have no time to deal with his broken and thwarted relationships, com pounded by mother-fixation, with Jessie Chambers, Helen Corke, Louie Burrows, and Alice Dax, before he met in 1912 the wife of Nottingham's professor of French, and left with her for Germany two months later. This stark summary may make him seem a womanizer, but he was in fact a deeply di vided and sexually frustrated young man, pulled this way and that by opposite impulses, always with part of himself left unsatisfied?and rudderless after his mother's death. But he was also an established writer, with two novels behind him by the end of 1911, and it was with the liberty of fiction as well as the density of experience?helped also by the gulf which living with a married woman had opened between him and his past?that he finally achieved his first major novel, Sons and Lovers ( 1913 ), probing the nature of the crisis from which his "marriage" with Frieda?as he already thought of it?had rescued him. Again I only gesture at the novel's com plex exploration of the failed marriage of the Morel parents, and the pressures that cause the death of their elder son; or how the younger son is almost fatally split between the spiri tual, aspiring side of him that is drawn to one girl, and the sexual passion with another that seems to put him in touch</page><page sequence="6">384 D. H. LAWRENCE with "life wild at the source"?unable fully to love one be cause she is a rival to his mother, and unable fully to love the other because she cannot satisfy the aspiring and complex person his mother has created. I pass by, for Lawrence's wrestling with "God" then began anew, with a strange unpublished (and ill-named) foreword to Sons and Lovers written after the novel was finished. Here he begins to look to the Bible for a way of going behind and universalizing the personal crises of Sons and Lovers, freely reinterpreting both Old and New Testaments. Genesis and Saint John have got their emphasis wrong, he maintains, for it is the flesh which is made Word, as woman gives birth to man not merely primordially but above all in marriage, enabling him to achieve his utterance. The opposed impulses of the flesh and the aspiring consciousness which, split apart, caused the personal tragedy in Lawrence's life and novel, are seen now as the source of creativity if they are married. God the Father and God the Son operate through the relation of woman and man to create new life and lan guage. In the ensuing year and a half Lawrence wrote three versions of a new novel about marriage which he called The Wedding Ring. Before returning to it to clarify and expand the "metaphysic" behind it, he wrote another extraordinary work, the Study of Thomas Hardy, which was not published until six years after his death in 1930. In Hardy's novels, in painting and sculpture, in the Bible, and in the relationships between men and women everywhere, the great Opposites are seen creatively at work, no longer defined by gender. Both divine forces conflict within individuals of either gender, as well as between them, and sex becomes a religious mystery, "for leaping off into the unknown, as from a cliff's edge." Life according to the impulse he calls "God the Father" is stable, all-embracing, one; a being in togetherness with all created things; an existence in the flesh, in sensation, linking us with the whole natural universe. But equally there operates throughout evolution the opposite force of "God the Son"? the impulse to movement and change, from being to know ing, from undifferentiated oneness to perception of not-self,</page><page sequence="7">MARK KINKEAD-WEEKES 385 defining the self against the other. It is differentiation into the many; into separation, distinct self-awareness, thought, and utterance, ever more complete individuation. The two im pulses are always in conflict, but the conflict is the ground of all growth. From each successive clash is born a new dimen sion of personal life or religion or art. For beyond the Father and the Son is the Holy Spirit. Beyond sexual conflict is con summation, opening up a new world as well as giving men and women to themselves more completely. Out of the dualism in the artist is created the work of art. There can however be no stasis, only a never-ending process in which each consum mation leads to conflict on another level. Conflict is vital to growth. If either force becomes dominant, consummation will be partial or crippled; but always the aim is to come through into new life. At once, having now grasped what he had been trying to say in The Wedding Ring, Lawrence took out the manuscript and rewrote it into the novel we know as The Rainbow (1915)?his attempt at a new prose for God in daily life. Its opening, in charged, almost biblical rhythms, shows the great Opposites at work in the life of archetypal men and women, in a timeless landscape, before announcing the coming of the in dustrial revolution, the canal, the mine, the railroad, the fingerpost tower on the hill that beckons to the nineteenth century city, the modern world. Then, in three generations of Brangwens, we are to compare three versions of the Mar riage of Opposites. When the lovers are both firm in their own integrity (like pillars of fire and cloud) but spring by deep impulse toward each other, able to give themselves completely in sex, they create a relationship that is like an arch, a rain bow, a doorway opening from the wilderness into a Promised Land. But, if either dominates or (conversely) becomes un duly dependent, because lacking in independent selfhood, re lationship becomes partial, crippled, even abortive and de structive. These are bare-bones statements. The strength of the novel lies in the realized human detail of the relationships between complex individual men and women: the stresses of marriage, sex, and pregnancy, the problems of parents, step</page><page sequence="8">386 D. H. LAWRENCE parents, and children, the charting of unconscious as well as conscious impulses. But there can be no doubting that The Rainbow is deeply religious, as the author seeks a new kind of relevance to daily experience in the Old and the New Testa ments. In each generation the great stories of Genesis, the Flood, and the Cities of the Plain, the journey through the Wilderness, the exile, and the burning fiery furnace are played out again, revealing new meaning for everyday lives. But death and resurrection are also absolutely central now to the significance of sexual relationship. It is through the "little death" at the heart of the sexual act that men and women, wholly given over to each other in "oblivion" of self, can be reborn into new life. And at one point in the third story Lawrence makes a vehement criticism of what he takes to be the church's overemphasis on the Crucifixion for sin, at the expense of resurrection, which he believes to be the central religious truth happening here and now, again and again, in ordinary everyday life and committed marriage. The Rainbow is also an historical novel that traces the effects of change between 1840 and 1910: industrialism and urbanization; the spread of education following the 1870 act; the gradual emancipation of women; the growth of skepticism and decline of religious faith; and how each generation is dif ferently affected as these develop. Most significant perhaps is that the more conscious, intellectually emancipated, and skeptical the women of the novel become the harder it is for them to give themselves in marriage to men increasingly less self-confident than they?until the story of Ursula seems to end (about 1910) in a tragedy of destroyed relationship, mis carriage, and breakdown. Only at the end, in her illness, does she come to see how she must "die" to her own self-assertion, must trust herself to the creative forces in the universe, must cease to will relationships, and wait instead for the coming to her of a son of God, "within the scope of that greater power in which she rested at last." The world she is reborn into after her personal chaos and "flood" is an undiscovered land recall ing the language of the book of Genesis?and through her window she sees a rainbow, a covenant still available.</page><page sequence="9">MARK KINKEAD-WEEKES 387 The novel was published in September 1915?only to be denounced for obscenity and destroyed within six weeks by order of the Bow Street magistrate. Blind to its religious imagination, the attackers saw only flagrant sexuality; a preg nant woman dancing naked in her room, exultant; even (hor rors) a same-sex affair between a girl and her schoolmistress. The book would not become available to the reading public in England for another decade. This was a blow from which Lawrence never recovered. It made him a permanent outsider to society, especially since he was also appalled by the plunge into a war that he saw as precipitated by imperialist jingoism on both sides, and still more horrified by the enthusiasm of the young to throw themselves into it. But, because of his views on conflict he could not be a pacifist either, and so he became more and more isolated. The fate of his novel confirmed his sense of a world gone destructively mad; and this intensified two years later when, having got as far away as he could, at the tip of Cornwall, he and Frieda were expelled from their cottage by the military, without explanation or appeal, on suspicion of spying. So what had been intended as "the second half" of The Rainbow turned into a very different novel. Christian language and reference have gone?and in all its characters, seemingly sophisticated and civilized, violence wells up. If there be religious reference, it is to Last Things. He thought of calling it Dies Irae. And, though he decided instead on Women in Love (1920), the novel remains a kind of Last Judgment, in which we see one pair of lovers coming through their violence to new life, but the other pair heading toward destruction and death. The basic belief in growth through conflict remains, but the war had made Lawrence see how great a psychic disintegration might have to take place before r?int?gration could begin; and also how battles for domination and exploitation between men and women could lead to irredeemable destruction of soul and body. As the war grew ever more bloody, Lawrence's condemna tion of his society intensified, until he became convinced that he was seeing the end of a civilization. He wanted nothing more to do with "democracy," a leveling down that had led</page><page sequence="10">388 D. H. LAWRENCE straight to Lloyd George, Horatio Bottomley's John Bull, and the carnage in Flanders, and that conscripted its citizens, treating them ( as he felt he himself had been treated at the call-up) as less than human. Far from civilization's having progressed, the horrors of the First World War showed there must be something radically wrong across the so-called civi lized world with the whole Graeco-Roman and Judaeo Christian heritage. For a new start one would have to go be hind or outside classical Greece and Rome and Mosaic Pales tine to what could be known of other and older civilizations, and look for clues to other ways of thinking in other cultures. For Lawrence, moreover, good and evil were not primarily sociopolitical but began in the individual human soul. A new psychology, capable of diagnosing the imbalance in the souls of millions and suggesting a remedy, was needed. Between 1917 and 1921 he developed a theory which did not, as he thought Freud's did, take disease to be the norm, but began from the original creative division, and redivision, of the ferti lized cell; it could hold out a prospect of health and growth once the drives of opposite impulses could be integrated. An ancient Hindu neurology held that psychic energy could be channeled into wholeness and illumination by bringing the chakras, the chain of nerve centers in the human body, into proper order and harmony. So now Lawrence developed his previous dialectic into a more complex scheme of four op posed kinds of consciousness?located in the nerve centers of the heart, the solar plexus, the upper back, and the base of the spine?two of which united the self with the other ( the upper in spirit and mind; the lower, physically), and the other of which stiffened the self into resistance and individuality. What had gone seriously wrong with human beings, he thought, was that Graeco-Christian "civilization" had more and more developed the upper centers at the expense of the lower ones. What was required now was a reaction in the op posite direction: for people to get back in touch with the sides of themselves that they had been taught to think of as "lower" or "darker" and?if the powerful forces that universally govern growth be "gods"?to get in touch with the "dark"</page><page sequence="11">MARK KINKEAD-WEEKES 389 gods as other civilizations had done but ours had forgotten how to do. As soon as it became possible, Lawrence shook the dust of England from his shoes; and after moving for some time be tween Italy and Germany, he set off in 1922 round the world, to Ceylon, Australia, New Mexico, and Mexico. It was inevi table that he should now, once more, react strongly against Christianity as a major source of imbalance, and see the de velopment of power and leadership by the powerful (mean ing, however, enabling potency and charisma rather than domination) as needing to replace love and democracy in the present crisis. In a story of 1913 he had seen Christ and Pan as opposed "gods" who had to be harmonized in the human soul. But now, remembering the story that at the birth of Christ the mournful cry had echoed round the world "Great Pan is dead," he set out to reverse it, bringing Pan alive again?not the degraded goatish figure of the Greeks, but the powerful vital god who animates all nonhuman life and who should animate human life as much. In poem after poem Lawrence re-created birds, beasts, and flowers in strange in human vitality?a snake, a fish, bats, tortoises, an almond tree, an eagle?not romanticized, not anthropomorphic, not there to reflect moods or ideas of the poet, but vividly alive with their own life, driven by their own "gods," or their own dis tinctive portion of God Almighty, Pan. ( On the other hand there are sardonic poems about what is involved in making over bull, lion, eagle, and man, into Christian symbols of the evangelists; and others, like "Snake" and "Mountain Lion," about the destructive irreverence of human beings for the godly life outside themselves. In St Mawr (1925), one of his best novellas, a magnificent stallion is used to open the eyes of the heroine, a cosmopolitan, world-weary "bright young thing," to the sterility of her life. "The wild, brilliant, alert head of St Mawr seemed to look at her out of another world. It was as if she had had a vision, as if the walls of her own world had suddenly melted away, leaving her in a great dark ness" out of which the horse's eyes, "almost like a god looking at her," pose a lif e-or-death question and challenge. The horse</page><page sequence="12">390 D. H. LAWRENCE becomes a touchstone to the attitudes toward life of all the characters. Ill-treatment of him leads to violence and a terri ble sense of evil; reverence for the power seen through him takes Lou to a ranch in New Mexico, where, in some of Lawrence's finest pages, she learns to see in the wild inhuman beauty and fierceness of the land a spirit with which she must come to terms before she can hope for love and true human relationship. In New Mexico in 1924 Lawrence himself achieved an ex traordinary feat of imagination by getting inside an "alien" culture and religion. Years earlier he had written of Fenimore Cooper's novels about Leatherstocking and the "Red Indians" as a white American s search to rediscover a part of himself that he had denied and almost destroyed. Now, in confront ing the real thing in the Jicarilla Apache Reservation, the pueblos of Taos and San Domingo, and the rocky mesas of the Hopi, Lawrence at first realized the apparently unbridgeable gulf between himself and the native American, but then gradually bridged it in imagination, until in the strange and terrible story of The Woman Who Rode Away (1928), and three fine essays, "Indians and Entertainment," "The Dance of the Sprouting Corn," and "The Hopi Snake Dance," he was able to get inside what had seemed so alien. For the Indian, he wrote, religion best expresses itself in dance, in which the indi vidual is lost in the tribe, which merges with the natural world. There is no God separable from that world. Everything, ter rible or lovely, is godly, and the human body and spirit?no division there either?reaches out in dance to unite with ele ments, powers, and creatures, the gods-in-all-things. The white man's colonialism and racism, however, have upset the balance of forces in the world?and brought an answering violence and cruelty in reaction, as three major novellas of 1924 make clear. It was inevitable that Lawrence should measure the Chris tianity he knew against Indian religion and find it wanting, indeed an obstruction now to human progress. This (he thought) required a revolution, but a religious rather than merely a political one. In Mexico in 1923-24 he wrote a novel</page><page sequence="13">MARK KINKEAD-WEEKES 391 anticipating by thirty years the anticolonialist fiction of our own time. The revolutionaries of The Plumed Serpent ( 1926) aim to liberate native consciousness from feelings of colonial and racial inferiority and (like Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, or Ngugi wa Thiong'o in our time ) to win back dignity and a sense of identity for the colonized by restoring the ancient precolonial culture and religion. Since the Christian church had been an agent of colonialism and its exploitation of native people, it must be expropriated and its images destroyed, if with a modicum of respect. As Christ once supplanted Quet zalcoatl and the other ancient gods, now the time has come, in the cyclical course of things, for Christ to return to his Father, and for Quetzalcoatl to take his place again. Lawrence tries to invent a religious movement, rituals of power, hymns and praise songs?none too successfully in my view. There is a challenging acceptance (anticipating Frantz Fanon) of vio lence as necessary for psychological liberation; and a worry ing readiness to tolerate authoritarianism and arbitrary, not to say kangaroo, justice. Sometimes, as in the fierce denunci ation of the leader's Christian wife as she lies dying, there seems a loss of humane imagination altogether. Fortunately Lawrence proceeded before long to react against himself yet again, proclaiming that his obsession with power and powerful leadership rather than love had been a mistake, and reverting?though with a difference?to his dialogue with Christ and the old insistence (at the time of The Rainbow) that true sexual relationship between man and woman is a way, through the death of the self, to resurrection and new wholeness. This gains in poignancy from Lawrence's lung hemorrhage and his close brush with death when he had finished his Mexican novel?after which he also seems to have become impotent. From 1925 to his death from tubercu losis five years later at the age of forty-five, the likelihood that he had not much longer to live must have been always at the back of his mind. He had seen two close friends sink from hemorrhages to death. Much of his best work in these last years was concerned to set death in perspective as part of continuing life?and finally to die gamely himself.</page><page sequence="14">392 D. H. LAWRENCE I would like to talk of many things and cannot bear not at least to mention Etruscan Places (1932), which sought once more to recover a lost world, and to reanimate the perspec tive on death that he saw embodied in the sheer vitality of the paintings in Etruscan tombs. But I must again pass on quickly?to concentrate only on two intertwined works which make up Lawrence's last exploration of the death and resur rection of the self; his final attempt to amend the Christian view of this and of a holy family; and his last struggle with Christ. Between October 1926 and February 1927 he wrote the first two versions of what became Lady Chatterleys Lover (1928). In April 1927, inspired by an Easter toy, a cockerel coming out of an egg, seen in a shop window while visiting one of the Etruscan places, he wrote part 1 of his long story "The Escaped Cock," misnamed by publishers "The Man Who Died." Between late November 1927 and January 1928 he wrote the final version of Lady Chatterley?and, later that summer, the closely related part 2 of "The Escaped Cock." Though Lady Chatterley seems fixed in people's minds as a novel obsessed with sexual intercourse, orgasm, and four letter words, it too, at its deepest, is a religious book. Since 1913 Lawrence had been maintaining in various ways that sex was a religious mystery, and many of us might have pre ferred him to have called the novel Tenderness as he had at one time thought of doing. I don't myself rate it among his best. Compared with The Rainbow and Women in Love it seems one-sided and overprogrammatic. Indeed Lawrence himself, in defining it later as a novel of "phallic versus men tal consciousness" admitted "there should be no versus . . . but now they are at daggers drawn." However it is mani festly, once again, concerned with the commitment of dam aged, half-alive people to true sexual marriage?if necessary by breaking a false one?and to finding, by the absolute giv ing of oneself in sex, the path through death of the self, to resurrection and new tender life. Odd as it may seem, the seven "sex scenes" are a step-by-step progress recalling the seven seals of the apocalypse (with which Lawrence was much concerned at the time). Mellors has to risk himself</page><page sequence="15">MARK KINKEAD-WEEKES 393 again; Connie must learn to give herself and to overcome shame. At the end, in a kind of pentecost, they find in loving acceptance of her pregnancy the full tenderness of lovers, and are visited by the flame of the spirit, a final commitment to become a family when the baby is born. It should not be sur prising that a bishop agreed to bear witness for the defense at the trial. I don't know, however, what he would have made of "The Escaped Cock." There Lawrence returned to his favorite book of the Bible, the Gospel of John?but this time to imagine a very different ending to the Passion narrative and so com plete his sense of where not only Christianity but Christ him self (and indeed the would-be preacher and teacher in Lawrence) had gone wrong. A man awakens in a rocky tomb in which he had been buried for dead; and, driven unwillingly by an uncontrollable instinct, in spite of dreadful pain and nausea from his wounds, he comes gradually back to consci ousness and escapes out into the world again. As he slowly recovers he is summoned to a new sense of that world by the fiery, insistent life-energy of a cockerel imprisoned in the yard in which he has taken shelter?its vivid plumage and clarion cry a wave-crest, as it were, of the great universal surge of physical life and desire, challenging death, which the man now sees everywhere. In his encounters with his woman dis ciple in the garden and with his ex-followers on the road, the man rejects his former self and teaching. He had wanted to be more than man, had wanted disciples, had given, given without taking or living the richness of life. He had tried to compel others by the power of a spiritual vision?and he had brought betrayal on himself and death to his body. Now he will "ascend to God the Father," not in the sense the disciples think he means, but in the Lawrencian and "Red Indian" sense of life as man in union with a living universe. He will free the cockerel to live its own life, and he will learn to live his own life more fully too, alone, for the moment. This is no mere blasphemy; nor is it even a typically atheist rewriting of scripture. For it is, evidently, not only a serious attempt at a final critique of Christianity from what remains</page><page sequence="16">394 D. H. LAWRENCE a religious point of view, but also a no less severe criticism of Lawrence himself. He had known, three times, what it was to be near death and to struggle back to life through pain and nausea. (He would re-create the experience once more in his "Egyptian" poem "The Ship of Death.") He had often main tained that sickness came when something went wrong with one's living. He too had wanted to be a teacher, a preacher, a salvator mundi (as Frieda often taunted)?he whose sick ness showed that he had not yet learned either how to save himself or how to live in fullness. He too had wanted disciples and felt himself betrayed by them, only to recognize that this was largely his own fault. Yet, even if impotent and only half alive now, Lawrence still insisted on bearing witness again to how he had been given new life in sexual love and marriage. It was perhaps inevitable that, after completing Lady Chat terley, he should add a second part to his story, in which the man finds the sexual awakening, love, postcoital tenderness, and fatherhood he had never had, through a relationship with a young priestess of the goddess Isis. In healing the wounds in his body, she restores his manhood and heals the traumas of his psyche. Through desire both virgin selves are awakened and made fertile. Although the enmity of the world forces him to leave, and though both in fact want not only each other but freedom to be themselves also, he will return, committed to her and to the baby that will come. Lawrence calls on the myth of Osiris to complete what he felt to be most lacking in Christianity: its otherworldly devaluation of the body and of sexual love. The story of Isis and Osiris is also about death and resurrection, but the search of the goddess for the dis membered and scattered parts of the god, to restore him to new wholeness and fullness of life, involves no ascent into some spiritual otherwhere, but embodies the eternal cycle of death and renewal in this world, here and now, again and again, in an eternally creative universe. Against that perspective Lawrence came to terms with his own dying, in the wonderful and moving sequence of his last poems. That they remain the poems of a passionately religious</page><page sequence="17">MARK KINKEAD-WEEKES 395 man is not in doubt: one who faced his dying bravely, know ing that "All that matters is to be at one with the living God/ to be a creature in the house of the God of Life" ("Pax")? but one who also insisted to the last that "Religion knows that Jesus was never Jesus/till he was born from a womb, and ate soup and bread/and grew up, and became, in the wonder of creation, Jesus,/with a body and with needs, and a lovely spirit" ("Demiurge"). It perhaps should be said that whenever I have spoken of "Christianity" it was as Lawrence had been taught to see this in his youth?and by those he encountered later. It is no part of my concern here to argue how far his criticisms apply to Christianity today; though I think they may be more accepta ble, to more committed Christians, than one might suppose, although applying still ( alas ) to much that passes for Chris tianity even now. Though Lawrence's emphasis changed from time to time, his essential objections seem clear?and might have been summed up in his several corrosive portraits of churchmen. Apart from seeing the Anglican church as an essentially middle-class institution, sadly out of touch with working people since the industrial revolution, and satirizing the conspicuous failure of individual clergy to live up to their beliefs, Lawrence accuses Christianity of reducing religion, reducing God indeed, and hence of distorting humanity, in four substantially related ways : in seeing the essence of religion as a matter of mind and spirit, against the body through which we relate most to the world and one another; in (consequent) contempt of the world, overvaluation of humanity in relation to it, and insistence that we are souls in passage to an other where; in placing emphasis (therefore) on Christ crucified and transcendent rather than on the Resurrection as the cen tral everyday religious experience transforming life here and now; and finally by elevating celibacy, and regarding sex as essentially fallen, low, even staining, rather than as one of the cardinal ways in which God operates creatively in love. Law rence thought that Christians failed in reverence for the multi</page><page sequence="18">396 D. H. LAWRENCE pie wonder and glory of Creation, and hence for the multiple plenitude of "God." There are essential Christian experiences and beliefs that Lawrence failed to understand or to share. He did always re main, however, "passionately religious," though with signifi cantly different emphases at different times. He saw God everywhere and in the uniqueness of everything, and he sought continually to reawaken wonder and reverence for all life. He thought the purpose of all created things was to be themselves to the utmost, and he relished their differences from one another. He saw God at work through contradiction and conflict, even in violence and disintegration, and he never lost hope in the possibility of regeneration to new life. Law rence saw the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit in every one, and he thought the Bible profoundly true, though in senses Christians have not understood. He thought the body was divine, indeed the main means of relationship with others and the whole physical world; and consequently that sexu ality, and above all the death of the ego and the awakening to new life and tenderness through sexual intercourse, was an essential religious mystery. He thought that death was, every day and always, an avenue to new life, and that this would be true of one's final death also, so that resurrection, not cruci fixion, was the central religious truth. He thought that direc tion came to us, as to Saint Paul, out of the unknown, and that occurs though "None of us knows the way. The way is given on the way." The poem which is often taken to be a kind of signature of the mature man?"Song of a Man Who Has Come Through"?makes its own noncredal comment on the twenty two-year-old man who longed to experience the Holy Spirit but never had. Not I, not I, but the wind that blows through me! A fine wind is blowing the new direction of Time. If only I let it bear me, carry me, if only it carry me!
