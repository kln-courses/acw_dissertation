<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Representation of Orality in African Fireside Tales, by Phyllis Savory1 M.J. Sheldon-Heeg If questioned about their familiarity with African folk tales, many adult white South Africans would in all likelihood recall reading or hearing such tales as children. More specifically, their recollections of the contents of their childhood bookshelves may well include at least one volume of African folk tales by Phyllis Savory, who has been enormously influential in establishing a particular representation in English of the genre, which is generally considered to be oral. "These Swazi tales have been handed down from generation to generation and represent truly priceless relics of the African continent"; "Children's book, Tales told around the fireside, creatures of the wild, humans who change into animals, a touch of cannibalism, 'collected from the native storytellers, who are the last of their kind'": indeed, descriptions such as these of two out-of-print titles by Phyllis Savory2 are sure to resonate with a significant number of white South Africans who owe their acquaintance with African folk tales to this prolific author. Despite the popularity of her titles, however, little appears to have been written on the subject of Phyllis Savory's work, apart from frequent references to the authenticity of the African folk tales she purports to recount. She is credited with having collected stories for over eighty years, drawing on the tales told by the storytellers on her father's farm and listening to missionaries during the course of her travels through Africa (Tribute 119), and Adey, Beeton, Chapman and Pereira, who briefly discuss her work under the rubric of children's literature, comment that her stories bear evidence of more careful research and objective presentation than the work of her predecessors in the area of interpreting San, Khoi and Bantu legends and folklore (51). Born in 1901, Phyllis Savory has a significant number of collections of African folk tales in English to her credit: a survey of the world- wide library English in Africa 30 No. 1 (May 2003): 103-22</page><page sequence="2">1 04 M. J. SHELDON-HEEG holdings of her titles reveals that her earliest book of folk tales currently featured in a library collection, Zulu Fireside Tales, was published in 1961, and that no fewer than seventeen of her titles appear in library collections throughout the world (Lion Outwitted by Hare, published in 1971 by Whitman, is to be found in the collections of no fewer than 238 libraries) (http://newfirstsearch.oclc.org). Individual tales have also been published, appearing in Drum as recently as 1999 (http://www.sabinet.co.za). An oeuvre of this extent cannot but have contributed greatly to popularising the genre, and entrenched Savory's narrative authority. Nevertheless, in light of the debates on the subject of orality and literacy, including the philosophy that considers them as antithetical, and polarises oral societies (popularly associated with a lack of development) and literate societies (equally popularly associated with all that is progressive), questions may usefully be asked about the particular way in which Savory in her published works represents orality, here taken to be a concept comprising several strata. In this context, orality could thus be viewed at the micro level as referring to mode of communication, specifically the recreation in print of an oral storytelling event. It could furthermore be viewed as referring to genre, specifically the particular way in which a work of oral literature is represented. And lastly it could be viewed at the macro level as referring to culture, with the focus in this instance on the particular way in which Africans, as representatives of the oral societies in which the folk tales originated, are represented. It would seem, therefore, that if one were to explore the scope of her influence, some model or instrument would be needed to guide one systematically through an investigation of these elements. As an investigation of this kind would explore Savory's work in published form, the model would need to take into account not only the textual components of any of her works, but the paratextual as well, which would extend to cover illustrations, illustrations, flyleaf text and forewords or introductions - in fact, any elements other than the tales per se. It was with the intention of undertaking just such a study that the following composite model comprising elements from diverse sources was devised and applied to Phyllis Savory's African Fireside Tales, published in 1982 by Howard Timmins of Cape Town. The critical literacy model proposed by Fairclough is taken as a point of departure, with the addition of further components. The stages in the application of this model permit an analysis of the conditions of production and reception of a text (in this instance, African Fireside Tales), the processes of production and reception of that text, and finally text analysis.</page><page sequence="3">ORALITY IN AFRICAN FIRESIDE TALES 105 These stages Fairclough labels explanation, interpretation and description respectively. Dealing as it does with the relationship between language and power, Fairclough's critical literacy model appears to constitute an appropriate instrument to place the publication as a whole in its socio- historical context and investigate the paratextual elements to establish the manner in which African cultures are represented in this publication, both verbally and through the artwork. The literary characteristics of African oral literature as discussed by Okpewho (71-104) are incorporated into the model as a means of exploring the extent to which Savory draws on such elements in what are purported to be authentic (re)presentations of African folk tales. As stylistic features specific to oral literature Okpewho cites the repetition of a phrase, line or passage, which may take the form of a formula; lexical and semantic parallelism; piling and association, including the use of the core cliché as an associative device; tonality; ideophones and digression. Finally, the question of the recreation in print of an oral storytelling event is explored by the inclusion into the model of a consideration of the skaz narrative technique, as discussed by MacKenzie, and an exploration of strategies for the simulation of spontaneous oral speech in print as proposed by Lakoff. MacKenzie (3-4) explores the debates concerning the precise definition of the skaz narrative technique, noting the distinction between its definition as an orientation simply towards oral speech and its definition as an orientation towards another person's discourse. This distinction, he notes, allows the differentiation between simple and parodistic skaz, the first of which is useful when the author seeks a narrator for the direct expression of his or her own intentions, and the second when there is some form of obstacle to this: "where there is no adequate form for the unmediated expression of an author's thoughts, he must resort to refracting them in someone else's discourse" (Bakhtin 192). Lakoff notes a number of typographical and other strategies used to simulate spontaneous oral speech in written texts, namely the use of quotation marks, italics, capitalisation (specifically the use of initial capital letters) and non- fluencies (including ellipses, repetitions, vocalised pauses, run-ons and fragmentation) (245-252). These strategies could be viewed in light of their contribution to operationalising the skaz narrative technique as outlined above, and thus as a corpus considered a final element in the proposed composite model. African Fireside Tales in fact consists of three collections of tales (Xhosa, Matabele and Batswana)3 combined into a single volume; each collection is accompanied by a foreword and introduction, and each is illustrated by a different artist. Each of the collections can be distinguished</page><page sequence="4">1 06 M. J. SHELDON-HEEG on the basis of specific characteristics: the human and the magical are combined in the Xhosa tales; the Batswana collection, too, combines the human and the magical, but also includes totem tales; the Matabele stories all have animal protagonists. In the case of the Xhosa tales there is no overt indication of mediation or layering in the storytelling; in the case of the Matabele tales Savory acts as frame narrator, the tales themselves being 'recounted' by Chakuti, the African wagon-driver employed on her father's farm in Zimbabwe; and finally, in the case of the Batswana tales, the name of a narrator is supplied at the end of all but three of the thirteen tales; in four instances the narrator's age is given (in one case as sixty, in the others as eighty-five). This provides an opportunity to investigate whether there are any significant stylistic differences across the three collections, and whether there are shared features contributing to a particular representation of orality. Analysis of the Conditions of Production and Reception: Explanation In response to the related questions concerning the socio-historical context in which this publication appeared, the power relations shaping the discourse, and the commonsense assumptions underlying the text posed by this stage of Fairclough's model, it is perhaps easier to offer an integrated response than attempt to answer them individually. African Fireside Tales was published in 1982 by a South African publisher. It is one work in the extensive oeuvre of an established author who had at that time already published a number of similar titles. This title was published in English, one of the two official languages of the day in South Africa, and would have appeared on booksellers' shelves at a time in South Africa's history when the division of the country along racial lines was entrenched in legislation. Savory's authority, as a white author, to publish an extraordinary number of African folk tales (in addition to the thirty-eight in this volume) is accepted without question, as is the fact that of the three artists selected to provide the illustrations, two are white. D. McK. Malcolm, the writer of the foreword to the collection of Xhosa tales, calls attention to the fact that this particular collection has been illustrated by Gerard Bhengu, "a self-taught Zulu artist who, as might be expected, can depict the Bantu people with an accuracy unsurpassed by a European"; that Malcolm considered it necessary to mention this and viewed the commissioning of Bhengu as something of an achievement, and thus unusual, is significant in itself. The illustrations by Sylvia Baxter and Julian Hulme of the Matabele and Batswana tales,</page><page sequence="5">ORALITY IN AFRICAN FIRESIDE TALES 1 07 respectively, pass without comment - not because their drawings are any less valuable, presumably, but because the readership would find it quite unsurprising to encounter a book by a white female author illustrated by a white female artist, particularly if it were a book for children. One of the primary assumptions underlying the production of this publication, therefore, is that the cultures in which the tales originated may or should be 'spoken for,' and that it is perfectly natural for this aspect of their cultural heritage to be represented by a white author (admittedly one who had heard many of the tales first-hand) and white artists. An important question posed during this stage of the critical literacy model as proposed by Fairclough is whether the discourse in question works to sustain or transform existing relations of power, and in this regard, Savory's work can be viewed in more than one light. Horsburg, following her comparison of a published Zulu folk tale entitled "UMshayandlela" by Professor Nyembezi, which appears in his IGoda school reader series, and the English version of the same tale entitled "The Love of Kenelinda" by Phyllis Savory from her collection entitled Zulu Fireside Tales, reaches two conclusions that are of significance here. In her study, Horsburg applies Barthes's model of textual analysis, and, adopting the broad view that recognises versions as translations, divides both the Zulu source text and the English translation into lexias for comparative purposes. She concludes that Savory's text displays evidence of cultural and ideological shifts when compared with the Zulu; one instance of this involves the fact that whereas the Zulu text focuses on the bull, UMshayandlela, Savory changes the animal's gender in the English text, which focuses on the cow, Kenelinda; Western tradition associates the cow with nurturing and bounteousness, whereas according to Zulu tradition the bull is held in higher esteem by reason of his role as progenitor, the means by which the size of the herd - the indicator of wealth - is increased (49, 97). Horsburg concludes nevertheless that Phyllis Savory and Marguerite Poland, the writers of Zulu folk tales in English investigated in her study, "have succeeded in promoting racial understanding through their tales and in further bridging the gap between the literary heritage of young Zulu and English-speaking readers in this country" (100). Although Savory's contribution to popularising the genre is unquestionable, some disquieting elements come to the fore in African Fireside Tales that hint more at a perpetuation of established perceptions of orality through the means of their representation in a published work than at challenging them, and leads one to question whether her work can indeed be seen to live up to the claims made for it by Horsburg.</page><page sequence="6">1 08 M. J. SHELDON-HEEG Analysis of the Processes of Production and Reception: Interpretation Questions posed by this stage of Fairclough's model concern the identity of addresser and addressee, the relations between them, and the context in which the interaction takes place. As a published collection of African folk tales, African Fireside Tales casts the reader in more than one role, depending on which part of the publication one is dealing with. When approaching the various paratextual elements, the reader is required to be just that - a reader, who reads what is written about the three collections in the volume, who reads the brief history of the oral society whose folklore is included in the book, and who views and gains a certain impression from the artwork. When it comes to the tales themselves, however, the reader is asked, while reading, to cast himself or herself in the role of listener. In a similar context Horsburg remarks on the desire of the two authors of Zulu tales in English investigated in her study to fulfil readers' expectations of what a Zulu folktale should sound like, and the consequent careful application of a style intended to create that impression, noting that this is particularly characteristic of Savory's work (99). The reader of this publication is therefore addressed by a number of people, all of whom have something to say about oral societies and oral literature: the writers of the foreword to each collection (D. McK. Malcolm, The Right Honourable Sir Robert Clarkson Tredgold, K. C. M. G., and Seretse M. Khama); the writer of the introduction to each collection (presumably Savory herself, as the introduction to the Matabele tales is clearly autobiographical and in the introduction to the Batswana tales Savory refers to herself in the first person); the compiler of the text on the flyleaf (which is an amalgamation of R. C. Tredgold's foreword to the Matabele tales and Seretse Khama's foreword to the Batswana tales); Savory as narrator of the Xhosa tales; Chakuti, the apparent narrator of the Matabele tales, and Savory as frame narrator; and the various narrators purported to recount the majority of the Batswana tales. However, as will be seen, the lack of any marked stylistic differentiation between the tales in the three collections seems to imply that it is to Savory's voice that the reader 'listens' in all three collections, and it is her particular representation of a folktale that the reader is encouraged to accept as being authentic. Further authority is lent to all these voices by the fact of their presentation in published form. A significant purpose of this stage in Fairclough's model is to identify the ideal reader of the text under analysis. To ascertain the identity of this person, questions must be asked concerning assumptions about what the reader does and does not know, and clues sought in intertextual references.</page><page sequence="7">ORALITY IN AFRICAN FIRESIDE TALES 1 09 Savory is generally acknowledged to be writing for children, and African Fireside Tales, too, is more than likely aimed at a younger readership. The first clue to support this is to be found on the cover of the book, which features one of Sylvia Baxter's illustrations from the Matabele collection (it appears again on 1 19 and depicts Mvuu, the hippopotamus, being garlanded with flowers by a group of monkeys prior to losing his gorgeous silky coat at the hands of the cunning hare, Vundhla); this delightful drawing is typical of children's books in its subject matter, anthropomorphism and rather romanticised setting. A second clue appears in the flyleaf text, which informs readers not only that the tales contained in the book have been handed down "from parent to child and perpetuated," but also that societal changes have come to pose a threat to the oral tradition, which is guaranteed survival through preservation in writing: the inference is that just as the oral tales were told to children, so the written tales in turn will be read to or by children. A more direct indication appears in the foreword by D. McK. Malcolm, who concludes with the statement that "[g]rown up people as well as children, will find this book fascinating." A further fairly safe deduction is that the ideal reader will be white and from an upper middle-class background, as an appreciation of Savory's style depends in part on familiarity with the language of Western story and fairy tale. Moreover, this ideal reader will either be familiar with and accept certain stereotypical representations of oral cultures (which are articulated both overtly and covertly in this publication) and oral literature as embodied in African folk tales, or else will be unfamiliar with these representations but will be prepared to accept them without question. The ideal reader will furthermore be neither puzzled nor offended by the at times pejorative terminology and depictions of the African people whose folklore, if one is to go along with flyleaf text and RC Tredgold's foreword, is being published ostensibly for the purposes of its preservation and to foster understanding of another culture. The racial segregation in South Africa at the time of the publication of this book would have made it unlikely that most white children would have had much exposure to African culture, and there are one or two suggestions in the tales themselves that an audience drawn from a culture other than those in which the tales originated is being addressed: Savory explains variously that Nomathanga and the baby Zim "hunted small fieldmice, modelled tiny clay oxen, and did all the things that small Black children do" (23); that "[e]very Bantu person, man, woman and child learns their own cows' call" (69); and that "[h]is first stop was at an African village up a hill nearby" (120). Had the reader belonged to the culture being represented, these specific references to 'Africanness' and African culture would have been superfluous. Furthermore, given the educational policy of</page><page sequence="8">110 M. J. SHELDON-HEEG the day, it is unlikely that young black readers would have had exposure to this book in the school context; equally unlikely is the chance that the book would have constituted leisure reading for young black South Africans. In sum, therefore, the ideal reader of this collection of tales is one who accepts both the representation of the cultures whose tales are published in this volume and accepts the representation of the tales as being accurate. However, as will be seen in the next phase of the analysis, an investigation of the language used to construct these representations reveals a degree of 'othering' that in fact contradicts the notion of a journey down the "royal road to understanding" (presumably of African people) that readers are invited on the flyleaf to undertake, and that reinforces a number of entrenched stereotypes about oral societies and their cultural heritage. Analysis of the Text: Description, and Application of the Remaining Components of the Composite Model During the description stage of Fairclough's model, the analysis is directed towards examining how language is used to construct a representation of the world; how linguistic features work to position readers/listeners; how the overall construction of the text, including visual elements, contributes to this representation; and whether there are any internal contradictions. Janks provides a comprehensive table of key linguistic features for critical discourse analysis, and while the scope of this study does not permit the degree of detail that her typology allows, the guidance that it has offered is acknowledged with gratitude. Analysis of the Paratext A necessarily brief analysis of the paratext focusing on only the most salient points reveals a number of contradictions in the way that oral cultures and oral literature are represented; the reader encounters a mix of romanticism and paternalism in the guise of historical or ethnographic information, and a number of stereotypes concerning orality are perpetuated. The foreword to the Xhosa tales by D. McK. Malcolm draws on a number of established perceptions about oral literature. As may perhaps be expected, the image of the grandparent as storyteller is invoked, but in unexpectedly contradictory terms, as Malcolm on the one hand acknowledges such elderly folk as expert storytellers, yet on the other is less than complimentary, noting with regard to the majority of folktales that "[o] ften grandmotherly tales wander along without apparent aim or purpose."</page><page sequence="9">ORALITY IN AFRICAN FIRESIDE TALES 1 1 1 Malcolm considers Xhosa tales to be superior to these, however, particularly with regard to the first of three characteristics attributed to the entire corpus of Xhosa folk tales; cited are their careful composition leading to an almost inevitable conclusion, their affirmation of tribal custom and moralistic function, and magic as a feature common to all. This is certainly true of the tales in this collection, many of which conclude with weddings and everyone living happily ever after in a way reminiscent of Western fairy tales. Nevertheless, one can glean from this text a suggestion that the tales contained in this collection will bear signs of mediation: the foreword begins with an accolade that would not be out of place in describing the writer of a string of best sellers ("Phyllis Savory has done it again!"), and Savory is credited with ownership of the stories (she is said to tell "her stories in a language that is simple and direct"). A more marked disjuncture in the description of the Xhosa people is evident in the "Introduction to the Xhosa People" which follows the foreword. Bearing apparent authority through being cast as a quasi-historical account, the style of this text is in parts faintly reminiscent of nineteenth- century ethnographic studies, with the writer assuming the implicit authority to describe her subjects rather as though they were museum exhibits and to assume that external appearance is indicative of moral rectitude: "They are a dignified, bright and courageous people, free from self-consciousness and possessing steady and fearless eyes." Although described in these apparently glowing terms, the Xhosa people are objectified in a number of passive voice constructions culminating in the statement that they "have been conquered only by Europeans." The impression thus created of their inferiority as compared with Europeans is further entrenched by their depiction as being ruled by tradition and traditional beliefs, with the use of scare quotes adding to the condescension in the explanation of the reverence that African people are said to have for snakes: "Often should a snake go into the hut of a Bantu man, he would not kill it, but would vacate the hut and wait patiently until 'his ancestor' had departed of its own accord. This belief still holds among the unsophisticated." The introduction closes with the assertion that the Xhosa people live lives steeped in magic and wizardry, and have "complete trust in the abilities of their own diviners." Tredgold's foreword to the Matabele tales also delivers some implicit messages about oral cultures and folk tales. The foreword begins, for example, with the assertion that the "folklore of a People is very much part of its life." The use of the capital letter reveals a great deal: it emphasises, certainly, but in doing so and in implying that the culture to which it refers has some special quality, it conveys condescension. This is further borne out by the assertion that an understanding of folklore will necessarily enhance</page><page sequence="10">112 M. J. SHELDON-HEEG understanding of the culture in which it originated - one wonders whether Tredgold would have made the same claim for Greek mythology and Greek culture at the time the book was published. The introduction to the Matabele tales describes Phyllis Savory's arrival at her father's farm as a five-year-old girl, and sets the scene for the frame narration sections of the tales that follow. Chakuti, the narrator of these tales, seems to fit the part of the classic African storyteller - his age is emphasised on more than one occasion, and Phyllis and her young friend Farewell turn to his wisdom for explanations of phenomena in the natural world. Although he appears much loved by Phyllis and Farewell, as representative of an African (and by implication oral) culture, Chakuti is, however, at times represented in terms rather at odds with the image of the respected elderly storyteller. Chakuti is described as being ruled by appetite, as in "The hare's rope trick" he is easily bribed by the young Savory to give up a baby hare intended as a meal when offered money - rather as a child would be bribed into giving up something that an adult wanted; in "The death of the chameleon" and "The downfall of Xoxo the frog," Chakuti cuts rather a ridiculous figure in his terror of both of these animals: he is depicted as being bound by the tradition and beliefs encapsulated in the stories for which the frame narration sets the scene. Chakuti, the adult and the repository of the folklore and wisdom of his people, thus appears childlike, whereas the young Savory, the actual child and representative of a literate, Western culture, is depicted as a rational and compassionate figure who does her best to rescue the innocent creatures who fall victim to Chakuti's superstitious beliefs, which he is powerless to overcome. Moreover, Chakuti's status is clearly that of a servant: in the tale entitled "Which tells of how the hippopotamus left the forest lands, and became a creature of the rivers and lakes" the children are given permission to 'borrow' Chakuti for a day's birds-nesting, making him something of a commodity to be reallocated at will, in this case for the amusement of the children. Significant, too, is the way in which gender and status are reflected in the division of labour on this expedition: Phyllis, the only female in the party, prepares food to take along and is entrusted with the boxes for carrying the delicate eggs home; Chakuti is cast in the role of bearer, as he carries a small axe and the bag containing the food; but it is the young white boy, Farewell, who "carried the most important things of all, i.e., the gun and the ammunition" (115). The introduction to the Batswana tales reiterates the notion of grandparents, grandmothers in particular, as being the tellers of tales. Moreover, there is a suggestion of synonymity between oral historical accounts and folk tales, as tribal historians and grandparents are discussed in</page><page sequence="11">ORALITY IN AFRICAN FIRESIDE TALES 1 1 3 quick succession in the same paragraph, and the function of the "old tales" is stated as entertainment, to teach a moral, or "to perpetuate an historical event." A concerted effort is also made to discuss African folk tales in terms of the fairy tales of the Western tradition: Savory seems a little hesitant to accept the African tales on their own terms, and, as will be seen, her representations of folk tales are indeed influenced by aspects of the Western tradition. A final point of note is reference in the closing paragraph to the perception of oral literature as being unchanging across many generations, and authentic only if it bears no evidence of external influence: Savory stresses her efforts to collect tales of "pure Bantu origin," contrasting these with tales of more recent provenance that may have originated with missionaries. These more recent adoptions, we are told, "are to be met with in many parts of civilised Bantuland, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate them from those of pure Bantu origin" - perhaps an appeal to the segregationist notion of oral cultures as traditional and thus somehow more pure, characteristics that would be destroyed through contact with more 'progressive' Western culture, from which they should be kept separate if they are to continue to exist in their original contented and unsullied state. Analysis of the Illustrations As already mentioned, as part of the paratext, the illustrations in African Fireside Tales may also be examined for their contribution to the representation of orality conveyed in this publication. The three artists whose work appears in this volume differ considerably in style, and the intention here is not to express an opinion on the merits of any one in relation to the others, but rather to comment on the contribution of each to the representation of orality within the framework of the publication under review. All of the illustrations contribute to an impression of the folk tales as being remote from the present both temporally and in terms of location. This is achieved in part by the subject matter, and in part by the fact of their reproduction in sepia tones: less stark than black and white, in the case of Bhengu's work in particular this creates an impression reminiscent of an old photograph. In Bhengu's illustrations, in particular, human subjects in traditional dress and accompanied by traditional artefacts are foregrounded against a non-specific, rural mountainous setting: young women and young girls are nude to the waist, and men and boys clothed either for combat in skin kilts with feathers in their hair, or in everyday traditional Xhosa dress. Although Hulme's work differs in terms of medium, her subjects, too,</page><page sequence="12">114 M. J. SHELDON-HEEG inhabit an unspecified, remote rural setting, live in huts, and wear what is generally recognised as 'traditional' dress. These illustrations seem to fix their subjects in the past, contributing to the perception of oral literature as being rooted in an age-old past, and authentic only if it bears no traces of contamination by contemporary phenomena. Even though a storytelling event is recreated in the case of each of the Matabele tales, Baxter's illustrations focus on the animal protagonists. Her animals are skilfully drawn, and not all her illustrations are anthropomorphic, yet one gains the distinct impression that her intention is to appeal to children. In the illustrations with anthropomorphic intent, the animals are depicted with anatomical accuracy and in a plausible setting, yet with just a hint of facial expression and in some cases humour. The creation of a slightly romanticised setting in some cases (the portraits of both Mvuu [119] and the leopard and her wide-eyed cubs [126] are very prettily framed with vegetation) and the depiction of dramatic moments in others all point to a younger audience, again supporting the idea that folk tales in particular are told to children. Analysis of the Folk Tales An analysis of the folk tales themselves reveals the range of strategies that Phyllis Savory has employed to create the impression that the reader is listening to a folk tale as recounted by an African storyteller. Although it is not the purpose of this study to make a comparison, as Horsburg has done, of English and vernacular versions of the same tale, reference will on occasion be made to the work of Harold Scheub to illustrate certain points. Scheub's work on Xhosa folk tales is of interest here because the translations into English that he supplies are in the style of transcripts, which provides a useful backdrop against which to investigate Savory's published representation of Xhosa, Matabele and Batswana tales. Thus, the extent to which Savory's folk tales accord with the remaining components of the composite model will reveal whether these tales display any stylistic features of African oral literature, whether they approximate spontaneous oral speech, and the extent to which the skaz narrative technique, whether simple or parodistic, is employed. However, as this investigation covers thirty-eight tales, not every feature discussed will be apparent to an equal degree in each of the tales: the focus will thus be on the broader representation of orality presented in the publication as a whole. Unless otherwise indicated, the examples for which page numbers are cited in this section are drawn from the 1982 edition of African Fireside Tales,</page><page sequence="13">ORALITY IN AFRICAN FIRESIDE TALES 1 1 5 Although no 'stage directions' indicating performance elements such as gesture are given in any of the actual stories in African Fireside Tales, even though a narrator figure has been created for the Matabele tales and the Batswana tales appear to have originally been narrated by individual storytellers, a number of typographical strategies consonant with those identified by Lakoff are employed, conveying an impression of vocal quality, and strategies conveying idiosyncratic speech patterns of characters are also evident, although not to a significant extent. A notable typographical strategy commonly applied in the first two collections is the use of capital letters, used predominantly in direct reported speech, to convey qualities such as emphasis, urgency, and volume. To cite only a few instances, evidence is found in the warriors' exhortations to the little girl Nomathanga to leave the Zim and return with them to her family, and the Zim's fierce counter-instructions: "THUMA NOMATHANGA!' 'HLALA NOMATHANGA!' growled the Zim. THUMA NOMATHANGA!' from the men, coming nearer. 'HLALA NOMATHANGA!' chorused the Zim and his little son. 'PHUMA NOMATHANGA!' shouted the warriors for the third time." (24) The same strategy is used to convey the vehemence of the instruction issued by Mdinini to his wife, when he tells her: "You must care for our home while I am gone, and whatever comes to pass, YOU MUST NOT USE MY ANCESTRAL BOWL AND SPOON!" (41); the fury experienced by Xoxo the frog on noticing that it is two young girls who have disturbed the tranquillity of his pool is expressed by: "Oh!' he said, 'now I see. It is YOU and yöi/!'" (151); and Vundhla's emphatic instructions for the tug-of-war are conveyed as follows: "'Now,' said Vundhla, 'when I get to the top of that little rise, I will shout PULL - and when I say pull, I MEAN pull - or I will pull you right into the Zambesi river!'" (113). A related strategy, utilised in all three collections and not so closely restricted to direct reported speech, is the use of italics to achieve a similar purpose: again, to cite only a few instances, the fish who exhorts Nondwe to secrecy calls to her "'tell no one that I gave you food!'" (47), the disappointment of the honey guide and the thoroughness of his search are recreated through tone of voice in Chakuti's narration: "Carefully he searched, lest perchance Ncitjana had left something hidden somewhere. But not a honey drop, nor a bee grub did he find" (125), and the menace in the utterance of the monster Leruarua is</page><page sequence="14">116 M. J. SHELDON-HEEG conveyed as follows: "'This time nothing will save you, mother of Tlhako ya Pitse, for you have sacrificed all, that you may live - I am going to eat youP" (221). Further typographical strategies identified in these tales involve the frequent use of em dashes and, more rarely, ellipses, conveying features of spoken language such as pause, a change in the direction of the narrative, or elucidation; in many of these instances other punctuation marks would have fulfilled the same syntactic function, but would have been more characteristic of a carefully constructed written sentence. Thus "[t]he sow saw her coming and tried, too late, to hide her charge behind her big ear - but the wicked woman saw him" (16), "[t]o one tribe He sent the Monkey. To another He sent the noble Lion; to yet another He sent the Jackal - all fleet of foot, and obedient" (130), and "Thakadu the ant-bear, however, badly needed a drink after his meal of peppery ants - he was very thirsty indeed - but as there was nothing that he could do about it, he ambled off into the long grass grumbling and disgruntled" (202). Examples of ellipses are to be found in instances such as the following: "the husband and wife clung together upon their sleeping mat ... too afraid to move" (216), and "'Cousins,' she smiled, 'you have been very quick today; I was delayed . . .' (she omitted to add that she had stayed behind to help an old cripple with her household chores)" (226). Evidence of idiosyncratic speech patterns, though present, are in fact rare in the tales: the baby Zim, unable to pronounce the word 'hlala', instead calls out "SLALA NOMATHANGA!" in an effort to prevent the rescue of his playfellow by the warriors (26); for the rest, evidence of this strategy is to be found in exclamations such as "Ah!," "Mai!," "Eh" and "Ei." What is more significant than the representation or recreation of idiosyncratic speech, however, is the very homogeneity of the style of direct reported speech, of which there is a great deal in all three collections. The complete absence of contractions from all direct reported speech, irrespective of its utterance by humans, animals or fantastical characters and irrespective of the intensity of the emotion of the moment both in the tales and the sections in which Savory operates as frame narrator, lends a certain remoteness and solemnity to the material, which is further reinforced by archaisms and inversions that are almost Biblical. On spotting a sleeping baby, two greedy gulls, for instance, are reported as exclaiming to one another "What strange object is that? ... Let us alight and find out" (74); the young Savory prevents a leveret from being popped into the stewpot by Chakuti by insisting "do not kill Vundhla; my money-box has money in it - for has not my birthday just passed? . . . Give him to me; I shall give you money when we get home" (110); and a dimo threatens a struggling dog that</page><page sequence="15">ORALITY IN AFRICAN FIRESIDE TALES 1 1 7 he is carrying in a bag over his shoulder under the mistaken impression that it is a human boy: "Be still, or I will give you something for which to struggle!" (190). Actual forms of address, too, cannot be said to resemble natural contemporary English speech: people are addressed as "Husband," "Wife" or "Child," or with a direct translation of an endearment such as "Daughter of my daughter," or as "Grandmother" or "my Great- Grandmother" to signal respect for an older person: the emphasis here appears to be on recreating the idiom of the African culture concerned. The narrated portions of the tales, furthermore, display features similar to the dialogue; no contractions whatsoever are used, inversions are frequent, and many of the lexical items have an Arthurian or even Biblical flavour. The distress of the parents on discovering that their baby has been stolen by the gulls mentioned above is described thus: "Sad indeed were the parents when they realised that they had been robbed of their little son, and the weeping mother reproached her grief-stricken husband all along the pathway to their home" (76); Sithembile watches as the boy she has loved for years is at last released from a spell: "This time she held her breath in wonder, for there came out of the depths a youth of wondrous beauty, mounted on the snow- white flawless ox, and he hailed her joyfully as he reached her side" (98), and Chakuti describes Vundhla's trick to deflate Mvuu's ego: "With great care, so as not to put out the precious embers that he was carrying, he crept to the hippo's resting place. With equal care, he set fire at many points, to the circle of dry grass that he had so carefully laid" (120). These homogeneous representations of another person's speech, whether the speech of Savory taking the role of an unidentified narrator, as in the Xhosa tales, Chakuti's speech in the Matabele tales, or the speech of the individual narrators of the Batswana tales, certainly are not recreations of natural, spontaneous speech; however, the conscious construction of a very specific style of speech as uttered by another person could well be considered a form of skaz, employed in this case specifically to contribute to a sense of remoteness in time and location, and to the representation of another's culture and possibly even language. These efforts to construct a style of expression for the narrator of an African folk tale might perhaps be seen in the light of the often invoked need to preserve oral literature, which is frequently perceived as being under threat: Savory is concerned with preservation rather than assimilation into a contemporary setting. However, the form of skaz employed here falls within the category of simple rather than parodistic, even though her particular representation is archaic and exists more comfortably in the realm of story than spontaneous conversation: the very uniformity with which she applies it - irrespective of</page><page sequence="16">118 M. J. SHELDON-HEEG who the narrator is - seems to suggest remoteness and agelessness rather than a deliberate attempt at parody. A number of the tales in the three collections display features identified by Okpewho as literary characteristics of African oral literature. Repetition, for instance, can be identified, in the form of both repeated phrases and repeated episodes; this strategy is certainly evident, for instance, in "A race between the tortoise and the hare" from the Matabele collection, and "Leruarua" from the Batswana collection. It is a significant feature of the very first tale in the Xhosa collection, entitled "The wicked chieftainess": central to the structure of this tale is a sequence of episodes in which a baby whose life is threatened by one of his father's wives is successively placed in the care of a number of animals: to arrive at the truth of his identity, the sequence is subsequently reversed, and he is restored to his parents. The second tale, entitled "Nomathanga," contains three repetitions of a rescue attempt, each of which is further characterised by repeated dialogue. The third tale, entitled "The bridegroom snake," is structured around the parallel journeys by two sisters to meet their bridegroom: the journey is undertaken first by the uncompliant sister, who undergoes and fails a series of tests, thus losing her chance to marry the intended bridegroom, and then by the compliant sister, who faces and passes the same tests, and is rewarded with a successful marriage. Scheub has collected a similar story, entitled "Two girls set out to find work," which displays very similar parallelism and repetition (367-73); in the translation that he supplies, however, the girls seek work rather than a bridegroom, and it is the compliant sister's tale that is told first; the tale does not, therefore, conclude with the happy ending so characteristic of most of Savory's Xhosa tales. Both Okpewho and Scheub highlight the use of the core cliché as an associative mechanism and characteristic feature of African oral literature (Scheub notes its use in the Xhosa folk tale or 'ntsomi' in particular), and a single verse or repeated refrain in the style of the core cliché is featured in a number of folk tales from all three collections in African Fireside Tales; from the Xhosa tales, in "The story of Nomehlomancinane," a little bird sings the following song to distract the cannibalistic giantess: "It is a wonderful thing that you do, Nomehlomancinane; You have killed so many, Nomehlomancinane - But still you need more, Nomehlomancinane; Even your own relations, Nomehlomancinane - Tomorrow it will be your own child, Nomehlomancinane!" (37,39)</page><page sequence="17">ORALITY IN AFRICAN FIRESIDE TALES 1 1 9 In "The moon girl Thangalimlibo," while trying in vain to comfort the crying Dantalasele, the little nurse sings: "Dantalasele is crying, The moon is shining' The baby is crying!" (64) In "The cow Chalaze," the following refrain is repeated three times, with an English translation supplied on the first occasion: "Kala, kala njalo, nkomo ka Baba; Si funa Mama, nkomo ka Baba" (69,71). Ncitjana sings the honey song in "The honey-guide's revenge" from the Matabele tales: "Quiri ra makuti, makuti, makuti, - den den den, Tsa-tsaga-tsa, gwarang-ga, quiri-ra" (125). From the Batswana tales, in "The crocodile prince," a mischievous bird repeatedly undoes the labour performed by Masilo and his wife by singing "Mix-up, mix-up, oh Masilo's land. Become uncultivated, Masilo's land!" (205, 206). A point arising from the material quoted above makes a slight digression from the stylistic features of African oral literature necessary at this juncture, and this is the decision by the author to include text in African languages in her tales. In addition to the core clichés cited above, many of the stories in African Fireside Tales include words or phrases in the language of the culture in which the tale originated. Where a translation is necessary for the purpose of understanding the story, the word or phrase is glossed either in the text or as a footnote, although, interestingly, in the case of the honey song, no translation is given. One has the sense that these elements have been included to add to the sense of the authenticity of the tale, and in the case of the honey song, it is probably immaterial whether the reader understands the text or not. Similarly, a pronunciation guide and glossary appears at the end of the Xhosa tales, and in "The story of Nomehlomancinane" from this collection, a guide to the pronunciation of this name is supplied in a footnote. Despite the apparent helpfulness of this</page><page sequence="18">120 M. J. SHELDON-HEEG strategy, it is notable, however, that these so-called guides to pronunciation in fact do no more than divide the words into syllables; they are not phonetic transcriptions, and include no indication of which syllables are stressed and which unstressed. Of further note with regard to the animal tales making up the Matabele collection is that the majority of animals are referred to by their African names. Collectively, these elements are an appeal to the discourse of authenticity, and have been included to suggest to the reader that he or she is 'listening' to a 'real African' folk tale. However, to return to the stylistic features of African oral literature identified by Okpewho: both he and Scheub identify ideophones as being an important literary and performance element in African oral literature, and this feature is present, although to a very limited extent, in African Fireside Tales. In "Nomathanga," for instance, the ideophone "r-weeee!" accompanies a description of the Zim mowing down Nomathanga's rescuers with his long, sickle-shaped finger nail; in other instances, however, an effort has been made to create an English equivalent of the ideophone, as Savory has used onomatopoeia to recreate the honey-guide's call of "che-che- che" (125), and the hornbill's call of "Ooop-ooop-ooop" (163). However, although Savory's work does seem to accord in some measure with the linguistic features of African oral literature identified by Okpewho, there are also areas in which Savory has departed from a strictly traditional model. Her inclusion of Xhosa tales again allows us to turn to Scheub's transcripts and translations, all of which feature very distinct opening and closing formulae, such as "Now for a ntsomF and "The ntsomi is ended, it is ended." Savory's tales are not explicitly contained within the recognised Western formulae of 'once upon a time' and 'they lived happily ever after,' yet the majority open with a phrase placing the tale in an unspecified, remote setting: "In a lonely valley in Xhosaland there lived a husband and his wife . . ." (68); "One day Farewell and I went out with Chakuti and the wagon to collect a load oftall thatching grass . . ." (109); "In a small pretty village on the edge of a gloomy forest in Botswana . . ." (188). Their closure is a little more varied: the Xhosa tales are drawn to a careful conclusion, generally with a happy ending (marriages are frequent) and the implicit message that good is rewarded and evil punished; the Matabele tales, too, are drawn to a careful conclusion, often with Chakuti offering an explicit summary of the message behind the story or a comment, and Savory then effecting a return to the frame narration situation; the Batswana tales, although they do not all end happily, are drawn to a carefully structured close, with all loose ends tied up and the sense that the story has been told for a specific illustrative purpose. Of interest, however, is the closure to the totem tale entitled "The power of Tawana," which appears in this last</page><page sequence="19">ORALITY IN AFRICAN FIRESIDE TALES 121 collection. This tale, for which a narrator is identified, concludes with the words "Retribution had been meted out to one who had transgressed the 'totem law.' It is finished'' The italicised portion is glossed as follows in a footnote: "There is nobody who can alter the outcome, for the totem of a tribe is all-powerful." Having noted the similarity of this sentence to the closing formulae recorded by Scheub, one cannot but wonder whether Savory has perhaps misinterpreted its function, possibly being overly concerned to have the folk tale end in the style of Western storytelling. A final point of note with regard to the text analysis relates to the possible sanitisation of the tales that Savory has included in her collections. Included among the Batswana tales is one entitled "The crocodile prince," in which a bird is captured that produces curdled milk or 'madila' when a plug above its tail is removed. Scheub has collected several versions of a Xhosa tale that follows very similar lines, except that he labels this group of tales "A bird defecates amasi," and in the translations of the transcripts themselves 'shit' replaces the more neutral 'defecate'; moreover, the bird has no plug located decorously above its tail. "The crocodile prince" is one of the three tales in the Batswana collection for which no narrator is named, and one might well ask whether Savory, as ostensible narrator, has not perhaps practised a little censorship so as not to offend the sensibilities of the audience for which she had intended the book. The application of all the elements of a composite model devised specifically to investigate the representation of orality in both the textual and paratextual components of African Fireside Tales by Phyllis Savory reveals aspects such as the power relations shaping the discourse and the socio- historical context in which this published collection of African folk tales appeared, and the identity of the ideal reader as an upper middle-class white child, cast in the role of, inter alia, listener to what the author would have her audience believe are authentic African folk tales. Moreover, it becomes evident that although in this publication the necessity of conserving folk tales is highlighted (thus tacitly emphasising their value as cultural items), a number of popular assumptions regarding oral literature and oral cultures somewhat at odds with this emerge. Testing the folk tales against those components of the composite model included specifically to explore the strategies that Savory employs to create the impression of an oral storytelling event in print and to appeal to the discourse of authenticity demonstrates that she has to a certain extent drawn on aspects of all three, as the tales display elements from the typology presented by Okpewho, there is clear evidence of the recreation of a specific discourse for the purpose of storytelling, and the text contains typographical elements reflecting aspects of oral speech. However, despite the presence of these and other strategies employed as an</page><page sequence="20">1 22 M. J. SHELDON-HEEG appeal to the discourse of authenticity, comparison with the work of Scheub nevertheless reveals in Phyllis Savory's folk tales elements of sanitisation and an appeal to Western paradigms.
