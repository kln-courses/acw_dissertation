<plain_text><page sequence="1">IJMA\ AN INTEGRATING FORCE IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY AHMAD HASAN The Qur'an repeatedly calls the Muslims an Ummah (Community)1. This appellation, i.e. the Ummah, by its very definition, presupposes unity, integration and solidarity, not only in external organization but also on the ideological plane. The Qur'an does not mean by this nomenclature a nominally united group?united externally but split up internally. It exhorts the Muslims to be united and to keep away from drastic division and disagreement.2 The Prophet after his arrival at Medina formed a larger Community for political purposes which con sisted of the Jews as well.3 This larger community was shortlived and the non-Muslims were eventually excluded from the Islamic Community. Now the Islamic Community stands on certain fundamentals which can be broadly categorised into law, dogma and rituals. These formal institutions give an external shape to the community. The process of the integration of the Ummah commenced after the migration of the Prophet to Medina* The Community secured its standing in its integrated form at Medina. The first step taken by the Prophet in respect of integration was the exclusion of the non-Muslims from the Community after they had violated the pacts concluded with them. Simultaneously, the institution of brotherhood (mttdkhat) united the Muslims in a single whole. The Qur'an talks of the Muslim brother hood as a* blessing from God.4 On a certain occasion, when a blood feud arose between the tribes of Aws and Khazraj, the Qur'an allayed their hostile feelings by calling the believers brothers.5 Since there was no ideological disagreement among the Muslims during the time of the Prophet, such as appeared in later times, this ideological cohesion was a vital binding force. The Qur'an repeatedly talks of the Muslim brotherhood and exhorts them to cooperate with each other.6 This moral teaching of the Qur'an for external and internal unity gave a momentum to the integration of the Community. The ideological cementing force during the time of the Prophet was the Qur'an and the Sunnah. The need of integration was acutely felt when, during the caliphate of Abu Bakr, a number of tribes refused to pay gakdh to the state.</page><page sequence="2">390 AHMAD HASAN Abu Bakr took situation seriously and intended to fight them. He wanted to preserve the state of religion as it stood during the Prophet's time. The non-payment of J?akdh was very serious for Abu Bakr, but 'Umar and some other Companions viewed the situation from a different angle. As the people were neo-Muslims, they wanted to treat them with leniency. 'Umar is reported to have remarked: "How do you fight people while the Prophet has said: I have been commanded to fight people until they utter 'there is no God but Allah'. When they utter this credo, they save their lives and property from me except with their right." But Abu Bakr did not agree with him. He is reported to have replied: By God, I shall fight a man who separates what the Prophet had united.7 There are different versions of Abu Bakr's state ment; yet all of them indicate the grave situation. Abu Bakr's reply to 'Umar and his determination to fight such people is of capital import ance for the purpose of the inquiry as to how the legal definition of a Muslim developed in later history. 'Umar seemingly desired to save the Community from disintegration, and wanted to include in it the persons who refused to pay ?akah in the Muslim Community. According to him, violation of an obligatory duty could be tolerated for a more important purpose. Hence he quoted the Prophetic tradition which provides the legal definition of a Muslim. But to Abu Bakr, standing of the Community on a firm basis and following the practice of the Prophet's time was more important for integration. Abu Bakr regarded the discontinuation of the previous practice as deterioration of religion (nags fil-din). This model practice (Sunnah) in the later ages proved to be the unifying force of the Community prior to the emergence of the principle of Ijmd6. 'Umar is reported to have changed his stand and ultimately agreed with Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr gave battle to these tribes and brought them to submission. From this we conclude that in the early days of Islam ideological integration was emphasized even at the cost of losing some Muslim tribes. And this was achieved through adherence to the model practice. From this model practice (Sunnah) in the long run there emerged divergent sects in Islam. The radical groups as well as the moderate groups claimed to be the followers of the model practice. The moderate group ultimately dis tinguished itself from others by its appellation ahl al-Sunnah wa'l Jamd'ah. After the demise of the Prophet it was not possible to extend the Prophetic Sunnah per se in the changed circumstances. Hence the Sunnah assimilated in its ambit some other elements not originally coming from the Prophet. It contained local customs, practice of the Muslims and</page><page sequence="3">IJMl', AN INTEGRATING FORCE IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY 391 the legal rules framed by the political authorities during the early centuries. So long as the Sunnah in its wider concept conformed to that of the Prophet and the practice of the Muslims remained pure and continuous, it was taken as the Sunnah of the Prophet. The practice of the Muslims during the first four Caliphs was comparatively pure and continuous. One finds nominal differences in the fields of law and dogma. Hence the practice of the first four Caliphs is considered normative practice, being a part of the Prophetic Sunnah. These Caliphs are generally known as aHmmat al-huda" (leaders of guidance) in the early Fiqh literature, and al-rdshidun (rightly guided) in medieval Islam. Although the latter appellation owes its origin to a tradition of the Prophet, yet it marks a distinction between the early Caliphs and their successors, i.e. Umayyads and Abbasids. With the emphasis of al-Shaf?! on the Prophetic traditions the wider concept of Sunnah was narrowed, and eventually identified with the Prophetic traditions recorded in the well-known collections of Hadith. Still the concept of the Sunnah of the first four Caliphs and the Sunnah of the Companions survived in medieval Islam. Now until the time of al-ShafTl there existed three channels to know the model practice, (1) Prophetic traditions, (2) the traditions of the first four Caliphs, and (3) the practice of the Companions on record. With the movement of the compilation of Hadith in the third century of the Hijrah, the Hadith literature swelled. This gave rise to the problem of the conflict between the well-known and the solitary traditions. The Hadith collections contained mostly the isolated traditions which did not coincide with the practice. These collections of Hadith, however, prevailed over the well-known traditions which represented the established practice of the Muslims. The domination of Hadith in different fields resulted in the justification of law, dogma and rituals on the basis of Hadith. Al-Asheari, the eponym of the moderate school, sums up 'the orthodox tenets' by saying: "This is the epitome of the beliefs of Ashab al-Hadith wa'l-Sunnah, and at another place he remarks: "This is what is followed by Ahl al-Hadith w*al-Sunnah.s Through the efforts of al-Shafi?i and later on of Ahmad b. Hanbal, the orthodoxy took its threads from Hadith Al-Ash'arl tends to refer by the appellation ahl al-Hadith to the group which stands on Hadith. The word Sunnah in this appellation points to the moderate school which follows the practice of the Prophet through Hadith. Al-Ashcarl calls the groups who differed from the orthodoxy ahl al-bioVah, ahl al-ahwd\ ahl al-zayghw'al-tadlil.^ He applies these names to the Murji'ah, Khawarij, Mu'tazilah, and ShI'ah. The Mu'tazilah laid stress on the well-known</page><page sequence="4">392 AHMAD HASAN Sunnah. They refused to recognize the solitary traditions not known and practised among the Muslims. Their attitude toward Haditk is pretty clear from the works of al-ShafVI, al-Jahiz, and al-ghayyat. Refuting the isolated traditions advanced by the Shi'ah in support of their stand, al-Khayyat replies to al-Rawandi: "This is because the Sunnah of the Prophet is well-known (marufah), transmitted by the Community at large. Whoever reports an isolated tradition which contradicts his (Prophet's) Sumahs, his lie will be known to all and his report shall be rejected.10 Even the early Shi'ah did not accept a tradi tion contradictory to the Qur'an and to the consensus of the Muslims.11 The Khawarij too looked askance at the isolated traditions. This is obvious from their criticism on Hadith in Ibn Qutaybah's Ta'wil Mukh talif al-Hadith. With this background in view the reason can be easily discerned for the appellation ahl al-Hadith waH-Sunnah applied by al-Ashcari to the right wing. So far our hypothesis shows that the institution of Sunnah was the unifying force in the Community prior to Ijmd'. Although the term Ijma6 was recurrently used in the early Islamic literature of the first and the second century in its non-technical or semi-technical sense, it did not carry the same force of authority as the term Sunnah did. For this we have two reasons. Firstly, the Sunnah was an institution already recognized in the pre-Islamic Arabian social order. If anything appeared as a Sunnah in the society, it had a psychological appeal at least to those who were conversant with this institution. Moreover, the significance of this institution was already known to the Arabs. Secondly, it had the support of the Qur'an at its back. The Qur'an emphasized obedience to the Prophet. Sunnah was, therefore, an authoritative force for unifying the Community. Things attributed to the Prophet had to be followed by the Muslims. If they were rejected, this was not because they were Sunnah, but because of some defect or weakness in their transmission or attribution to the Prophet. We have shown elsewhere 2 that roughly until the middle of the second century of the Hijrah, Sunnah remained so close to Ijma' that both these terms were used interchangeably, rather sometimes they were identified. With the break in the established practice after the orthodox Cali phate a state of chaos emerged in different spheres. Differences arose almost in every legal problem; the theological sects shook the foundations of the faith. This resulted in the division of the Sunnah. At this stage, one could hardly claim that such and such point is the agreed practice of the Community at large. Since Ijmae was emerging out of disagreement,</page><page sequence="5">IJMA: AN INTEGRATING FORCE IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY 393 al-Shafi'i was correct in his attack on this principle. It appears that the principle of Ijmd' was institutionalised to save the Community from disintegration. Ijmd6 and Sunnah were henceforth separated. Sunnah was replaced by fladith and Ijmd' now became the term of reference. The concept of Ijma6 grew up with the emergence of the majority group (ahl al-Sunnah) vis-a-vis different theolpgical sects. The majority group claimed to be the follower of the right and ideal practice. Hence Sunnah became a part of their appellation. The institution of jamd'ah was stressed, it is believed, at this stage as the extremists were declared heretics by the majority group. From al-ShafTls discussions on the problem of Ijmd' and isolated traditions13, it appears that orthodoxy justified their stand on the basis of isolated traditions. But when different sects quoted Hadith in support of their view-point, and this created a chaotic state of affairs with the increasing Hadith literature, the moderate group receded and again had recourse to Ijmd\ The titles Ahl al-Hadith, ahl al-Sunnah and ahl al-Ijma' now became identical. During the third century we find emphasis on jama'ah. Ahmad b. Hanbal who completed the work of al-Shafi'i. divides the whole Community into three groups with respect to prayer ($aldt). First, he groups together Khawarij. Rawafid and ahl ai-Bid'ah. This group, he remarks, despises public prayer and regards the Muslims as heretics. Second, he refers to people devoted to ease and pleasure holding ignoble assemblies of drinking and other evil deeds. The third group is ahl al-jamd'ah who attend public prayers in the mosques regularly. This group, according to him, is the best of all.14 By ahl al-jamd'ah Ibn Hanbal does not refer only to the people who say their prayer in con gregation, but presumably he means the moderate group. The term ahl al-jamd'ah is the second phase of the development of the appellation ahl al-Sunnah. In the first stage they were known as ahl al-adl wa ahl al-Sunnah. We come across this name in an epistle of Abu Hanlfah addressed to 'Uthmafi al-Battl who levelled the charge of irja' on him. Abu Hanlfah refuting this charge replied: "Let it be known that the best of things that you should learn yourself and you should teach people is Sunnah. You should know people who have learnt it by necessity. As regards the title 'al-murji'ah it may be remarked that it is no sin if a group believes in moderation (cadl). The people of innovation (ahl al-bid'ah) have applied this name to this group. But they are, in fact, ahl al-adl wa ahl al-Sunnah (people of the middle of the road and followers of the established practice). The antagonists have applied this name (murji'dh) to them."13 This shows that ahl al-Sunnah and ahl al-bida'h</page><page sequence="6">394 AHMAD HASAN were earlier divided. Ahl al-bid'ah represented the left wing comprising all the groups who opposed orthodoxy. The concept of jama'ah in the context of the integration of the Community emerged for the first time in the first century of the Hijrah. The year 41 A.H., when Mu'awaiyah became the caliph after his com promise with al-Hasan b. cAli, is known as cdm- al-Jamdcah (the year of unity).16 The reason for this seems to be that the dual caliphate was henceforth abolished and the conflict between cAli and Mu'awlyah now came to an end. Although politically this year was the beginning of in tegration, al-Jahiz (d. 255 A.H.) portrays this year as the beginning of schism, absolutism and kingship.17 The term 'dm aUjamd'ah indicates that the Community was absolutely disgusted with the internecine wars and it needed both internal and external integration. We have shown that the rise of the heretical sects in Islam was the result of the political upheaval since the time of fUdiman. This reached its climax during the reign of 'AIL The external disunity was thus redeemed by the movement of jama'ak. We shall discuss presently how Hadith literature accelerated this movement by laying emphasis on the adherence to the majority or jama?ah. The internal disagreement or the ideological chaos was removed by the dominating concept of the Sunnak. The title ahl al-Sunnah ufal jamd'ah which represents the moderate and majority group, emerged as a via media out of radical trends. To establish this modus Vivendi, law and theology cooperated with each other. The doctrine of tag lid (con formity) conserved the legal heritage of the first three centuries with the process of systematisation. The development of orthodox theology pioneered by Ahmad b. Hanbal and accentuated by al-Ash'arl standardis ed the dogma in Islam. In this process of standardisation the doctrine ofljmd' which must have been derived from the concept of jamaedh played a paramount role. Although the term Ijmd1 was in currency in pre Islamic Arabia, it gained momentum in its technical form, emerging as an authoritative force, with the emergence of disagreement in Islam. The orthodoxy was identified with ahl al-Ijmdc in its culminating phase of development.18 The force of Ijrnd' can be imagined from the fact that even the left wing justified their views by referring to Ijindi and excommunicated their opponents on its basis.19 The civil wars which resulted in the emergence of the concept of jamd ah are known as jitnah in history. This is termed as fitnah Samma9, 'arnyd' and sometimes bakma* (deaf, blind and dumb schism) in Hadith literature.20 The word jitnah and its adjectives have been presumably derived from the Qur'anic verse : "And they thought that there would</page><page sequence="7">1JMA\ AN INTEGRATING FORGE IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY 395 be no affliction and so they became blind and deaf; then Allah turned to them mercifully but many of them (again) became blind and deaf."21 It is reported that Ibn 'Umar was once asked about the meaning of jitnah. Quoting the Qur'anic verse: And fight them until there is no persecution and religion is only for Allah,22 he remarked : 6'Do you know what jitndh is ? The Prophet was fighting the infidels (so that they might embrace Islam and might not return to their religion). The return to their religion was known as jitnah and not the battle that you are fighting for worldly hegemony."23 This shows that these civil wars were very serious in the eyes of the people, and they took them as perversion of the Community. But Ibn 'Umar held a different view of the civil wars and disillusioned people by giving a new interpretation of jitnah. The report, however, indicates that there was confusion in the minds of people as to the meaning of jitnah. The concept ofjama*ah seems to be a reaction against the rise of schism (jitnah) in Islam. The Hadith literature supports our hypothesis. Nearly all the collection of Hadith which belong to the third century of the Hijrah contain the chapters of Fitan. The main theme of these chapters is the prediction of the rise of sects and disinteg ration of the Community. The traditions of Fitan lay emphasis on the integration of the Community in a jama? ah. All these traditions of the Prophet were quoted by the Orthodoxy in support of their stand. The juxtaposition of the terms jitnah and jama9ah in Hadith literature is a proof that they were coeval. The predictory traditions concerning the rise of sects in Islam and the adherence to the Community (jama?ah) are copious. It will lead us far afield if we quote them in toto. We, therefore, analyse some relevant and important traditions in this context. The Prophet is reported to have said: "The people of the Book before you were divided into seventy groups; you will be divided into seventy-three groups. Seventy-two of them will go to hell-fire, and only one of them will enter paradise. This single group is the jama'ah".2* This tradition has different versions. The most important and interesting is the one which tells that only ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-jama'ah shall get deliverance. This version also defines ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-jama'ah as the followers of the Prophet and his Com panions.25 The occurrence of the title ahl al-Sunnah wcfl-jama'ah in the Hadith is astonishing. This shows how the moderate group justified their school and even their title on the basis of Hadith. Earlier we have shown the development of this title and concluded that ortho doxy stands on Hadith. This is illustrated by the remarks of al-Isfra*ini (d. 741 A.H.): "There is no sect out of so many sects in the Community</page><page sequence="8">39^ AHMAD HASAN more obedient to the Prophet and more faithful to his Sunnah than these people (moderate group). This is why they are called ashdb al-Hadith and their title is ahl al-Sunnah wa9ljamd(ah.2$ Another Hadith runs : "Disagreement will appear after me. If you find a man who separates himself from the Community or designs to shatter the practice of the Community of Muhammad, kill him, whoever he may be. This is because Allah's hand is upon the Community (jamd'ah) and the Satan goes with a man who dissociates himself from the Community.';27 Such traditions predict the aftermath of the civil wars when the Community fell a prey to drastic disagreement and required a total integration. It does not permit the slightest difference of opinion from the general views of the Community and constitutes an over emphasis on integration. The concept of the strict adherence to the jamd'ah gave rise to the idea of the infallibility of the agreed decisions of the Community. The following Hadith reflects this notion : "My Community will not agree on an error. When you see disagreement, you should follow the over* whelming majority.' 28 This Hadith is the basis for the justification of the principle of IjrruV. The emphasis on jama''ah in medieval Islam for the sake of the sta bility of the Ummah leads to the repudiation of the entity of the individual. This gave a setback to individual thought. Alongside the adherence to the jama'ah we find also stress on the unquestioned allegiance to the Amir. Strict adherence to the jama(ah coupled with obedience to Amir left no freedom for the individual. This was done as a makeshift, but unfortunately it became permanent. The following Hadith illustrates the point in question : Hudhayfah b. al-Yaman reports : "People used to ask the Prophet about good, but I used to ask him about evil for fear of getting it. I said, "O Prophet of Allah, we were in ignorance and evil, Allah brought this good for us; will there be any evil after this good? He said, "Yes." I said, "Will there be "good after that evil ?" He said, "Yes. There will be dakhan (dinginess)." I asked, "What is this dinginess?" He replied, "People will follow the Sunnah other than mine, and lead a life without guidance; you will find in them good and evil." I asked, "Will there be evil after good?" He said, "Yes. People will invite to the gates of hell-fire. One who responds to them, will be thrown in it." I said, "O Prophet of Allah, tell me their qualities." He replied, "They will be from our group, and will speak our langu</page><page sequence="9">IJMA\ AN INTEGRATING FORCE IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY 397 age." I said, "What do you advise me to do if I get them?" He said, "Follow the Community (jama*ah) of the Muslims and their leader." I said, "If they have no community and leader, what should I do ?" He replied, "Leave all the sects, even you take shelter in the root of a tree until you die in the same condition."29 Another Hadith goes: "If anyone of you finds his leader doing some work detestable to him, he should tolerate it patiently. This is because one who separates himself from the Community (jamd'ah) by a span, will die the death of ignorance."30 The traditions which lay emphasis on obedience to Amir reflect want of political unity and stability. Since the Umayyads and 'Abbasids could not main tain the standard established by the Prophet, and continued to some extent by the early Caliphs, the masses were not satisfied with their behaviour. Hence the term 'Sunnah of the rightly-guided caliphs emerged to distinguish the practice of the first four Caliphs from that of the later caliphate. The following Hadith emphasizes obedience to the first four Caliphs : "I advise you to fear Allah and obey the leader, even if he be a negro slave. One who survives me shall see profound disagreement. You should then follow my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided Caliphs. Hold fast to it and follow it to the last letter. You should desist from following new practice, because every new practice is innovation and every innovation is error."31 Although the Hadith in question does not name the rightly-guided Caliphs, it is generally interpreted as referring to the first four Caliphs. It seems that the term Cal-Khulafd' al-Rdshidin must have gained currency during the third century of the Hijrah, because it is not traceable in the literature of the first two centuries. The title might have been derived from the Hadith in question. One concludes from the aforesaid traditions that emphasis was laid equally on adherence to the Sunnah and the jamd'ak. In other words, Sunnah and jama*ah at one stage became identical. And this was natural because the majority group grew out of the radical schools and identified their views with the Sunnah. Therefore it has been well said in a Hadith that abandonment of the Sunnah is tantamount to separation from the jama'ahf2 The question of the definition of Ummat al-Isldm or millat al-Isldm (the Islamic Community) is a corollary to the concept of jamdiah. It also involves the problem of excommunication (takfir). This was introduced probably to establish the orthodox standards in different</page><page sequence="10">398 AHMAD HASAN spheres vis-a-vis the standards of the opposed groups. Al-Shafi'I empha sized strict allegiance to the Community. But he did not lay down any definition of the Community. During the second century of the Islamic era the theological sects arose, as is evident from al-Shafi'I's use of the term ahl al-Kalam, and also from Abu Hanifah's letter to Uthman al-Batti. Moreover, the term ahl aV-adl wa'l-tawhtd in this letter indicates the emergence of the moderate group. But the standard definition of the Ummah or millah is not traceable until the death of al-Shafi'i (204 A.H.). The reason may be that the doctrinaire aspect of Islam in its systematic form was in evolution, and the process of theorisation was developing. With the diffusion of Hadith during the third century of theHijrah coupled with the emergence of Kalam simultaneously, the questions of the defini tions of a Muslim and that of the Community arose. The definition of the Community (jama'ah) perhaps owes its origin to the jamd'ah of the prayer. Ahmad b. Hanbal tells us that the Khawarij, Rawafid, and ahl al-bid'ah did not offer their prayers together with the rest of the Muslims in their mosques, and they held them heretics rather separate from the Community.33 Besides, the Azariqah, a sect of the Khawarij, regarded the territory of the Muslims as dar al-Kufr. They had their own separate camps which they called dar al-Islam. It was obligatory, according to them, for a Kharijl to migrate to their camp, because one who lived with the Muslims in dar al-Kufr was an unbeliever [Kafir) in their eyes.34 Such trends of separation must have paved the way for defining the Ummah of Islam. We do not find any standard definition of the Ummah before cAbd al-Qahir al-Baghdadi (d. 429 A.H.). We come across, of course, sporadic statements regarding the definition of the Community. Al-Jahiz refutes the charges of the Shl?ah of his time that Abu Bakr was an un believer. He tells them : "You agree with us on the point that he (Abu Bakr) uttered the credo of Islam, ate the flesh of the legally slaughtered animal, and exhibited Islam.. Therefore, according to the rule (qiyas), it is essential to regard him as a Muslim on the basis of our agreement upon his obvious belief."35 Whether a Muslim becomes an unbeliever by committing a grave sin was a serious problem. It appears that until the time of al-Asfcari Ijma' was established on the point that a Muslim who belongs to the ahl al-Qiblah does not become a Kafir by committing a grave sin like adultery, theft and so on. Al-Ashcarl regards a Muslim who commits a grave sin as a believer. He considers this belief as an article of faith of the moderate group (ahl al-Hadith wa'}l-Sunnah) .36 He remaks that there are two view-points concerning a man who commits a grave sin.</page><page sequence="11">IJMA\ AN INTEGRATING FORCE IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY 399 One holds him to be an unbeliever, while the other regards him as corrupt (fdsiq). The former is the view of the Khawarij, and the latter of ahl al-Istiqdmah. According to him none before Wasil b. cAta' opined that a Muslim who commits a grave sin is neither a believer nor an unbeliever. Further, he remarks that since Wasil separated himself from the Community by making such a statement and opposing the IjmbV on the definition of a Muslim, he was called Mu'tazill. Again, he says that all the Muslims are agreed upon the fact that a sinner from among the ahl al-Saldt (people of the prayer) is a believer. The agreement of the Muslims on this point excommunicates him (Wasil) and his opinion stands rejected.37 The term Ummah or Millah, however, was not sharply defined by al-AshcarI. The ahl al-Qiblah and the ahl al-Saldt, according to him, constitute the ummah or millah. It compre hended the moderate as well as the extreme groups. The definition of the ummah of Islam crystallized during the time of al-Baghdadl (d. 429 A.H.). He records the definitions of ummah as given by al-Ka'bl (d. 319 A.D.), al-Karramiyah and a group of ahl al Hadith. He refutes the definitions of these groups and takes his own as the standard one. According to al-Ka'bi, he observes, the name millat al-Isldm includes a man who confesses to the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and holds that his teachings are true; let him say anything after this confession. The name ummat al-Islam} according to al-Karramiyah, is applicable to persons who utter the credo (Kalimah) of Islam, whether they believe in it sincerely or not. Accord ing to a group of ahl al-Hadith the name ummat al-Isldm, stands for people who believe in the obligatory duties, i.e., offering prayer five times facing the Ka'bah. Finally, he brings forth his own definition which represents the beliefs and doctrines of ahl al-Sunnah. The definition says: "What is true, according to us, is that the name millat al-Isldm includes a man who believes in the temporary existence of the world, oneness of its Creator and His eternity, and that He is Just, Judifcious, and rejects the doctrine of anthropomorphism and the negation of divine epithets, and confesses along with it to the prophethood of all His prophets and the validity of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and that he was sent as a Prophet to all and sundry, and that God helps His SharVah, and that his teachings are true; and that the Qur'an is the source of SharVah and that offering five times' prayers, payment of %akdh, fasting during the month of Ramadan and Hajj pilgrimage are obligatory duties on some particular persons. One who confesses to this is a member of the Islamic millah. If one does not confound one's faith with the</page><page sequence="12">400 AHMAD HASAN evil innovation (bid'ah) leading to unbelief, one is a muwahhid (a believer in the unity of God) and a Sunni (moderate).38 The above definition clearly reflects the Ash'arite prejudice because it does not allow an opponent of the orthodox view-point to be a member of the Community. Nonetheless, al-Baghdadi is not clear in the excommuni cation of all heretical sects, but he is strict in the case of their leaders. He treats them sometimes on a par with the apostates and occasionally with the magians.39 Al-Shahristani is more logical in his definition than al-Baghdadi. He defines the terms millah, minhdj and Sunnah as follows : Mankind requires association with their fellow beings in order to earn their liveli hood and to make preparation for the next world. This association should be established in a form by which solidarity and cooperation may be achieved. By solidarity one can protect one's right; and by cooperation a man can acquire what is not owned by him. The associa tion established on this pattern is known as millah. The particular way which leads to this body (JiafaK) is called minhdj (method), sharVah (path way) and Sunnah (trodden path). The acquiescence in this Sunnah is termed as jama'ah. God says : "For everyone of you We appointed a law and a way40 (5 : 48). This definition shows that the terms minhdj, sharVah and sunnah are vaguely synonymous. The definition also draws a distinction between the millah and the jamd'ah. The jamd(ah is the mainstay while the Sunnah and other allied terms are instrumental to the jama1 ah. The link between the Sunnah and the jama!ah is also clear from the above definition. Millah is a wider concept than jama?ah. Even jamd'ah, according to this definition, is conducive to millah. With the establishment of the creed through the theologians of Islam, the idea of excommunicating the opponents developed. The definition of a Muslim put forward by the orthodoxy became the standard for excommunication. Since orthodoxy stood on Ijma\ the denier of Ijmd6 in principle was declared heretic.41 The theologians frequently excom municated their opponents with the result that the study of theology became a point of dispute. Numerous tracts were written in favour of as well as in opposition to the study of this science.42 Al-Ghazali (d. 505 A.H.) expressed his vehement opposition to the frequent excommunication of the Muslims. Disbelief, according to him, means belying the teaching of the Prophet. He thinks that the Jews, Christians, Hindus and atheists are unbelievers because of their disbelief in the Prophet of Islam and also in the Prophets before him. Explaining the seriousness of excommunication, he states that, as is the</page><page sequence="13">IJMA\ AN INTEGRATING FORCE IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY 401 case with slavery and freedom, certain religious commands are associated with disbelief also. For example, if a Muslim is declared Kafir he becomes eligible for condemnation to death and for residing eternally in the hell-fire. Al-Ghazall thinks that disbelief can be known through textual evidence (nass) or by analogy. He does not regard the persons who interpret Islam allegorically as unbelievers in so far as they follow the law of allegory (qanun al-tdwil). He contends that there seems no reason to declare the allegorists unbelievers because every sect of Islam has recourse to it. As regards the essentials of Islam, al-Ghazall presumes that one who changes the external meaning in toto without furnishing any proof, is necessarily an unbeliever. It seems, however, that he was very careful in excommunicating the Muslims. He has left a valuable counsel concerning excommunication which we reproduce literally: "You should deter yourself as far as possible from excommunicating the people of the Qiblah (ahl al-Qiblah) so long as they utter the credo of Islam, without contradicting it. Contradiction means belying the Prophet with reason or without reason. Excommunication is signally hazardous, while silence has no danger."43 The doctrines of Islam are based on three sources, namely, con tinuous and well-known traditions, isolated traditions, and Ijmdc. One who rejects the doctrines based on tawdtur (continuous report) is an unbeliever, according to al-Ghazali. while one who denies solitary reports is not a Kafir (unbeliever). As regards the rejection of the doctrines based on Ijmdc, he observe that it is not disbelief because it is a disputed point whether Ijma' is in itself an authority. Moreover, he raises the same objections to Ijmae as al-Shafi'i had done before him* He thinks that it is difficult to know whether a point in question was agreed upon by Muslims. Finally, he decisively remarks that a man who opposes Ijmd\ which is not still proved according to him, is ignorant and erroneous but not an unbeliever. He, therefore, cannot be excommuni cated.44 Al-Ghazall does not accept the definition of a Muslim furnished by the SunnI theologians as the standard one. He shows his abhorrence of the schoolmen who narrowed the mercy of God and confined Paradise to the theologians alone. He lays down his own definition of a Muslim which seems to be more reasonable than those furnished by his predeces sors. He remarks : "What is clearly true is that one who believes firmly in the teaching of the Prophet and the content of the Qur'an is a believer (mu'min), no matter if he is ignorant of the evidence. Rather the belief based on theological evidence is fairly weak; the strong belief is the belief</page><page sequence="14">402 AHMAD HASAN of common men which they obtained in their hearts in childhood through continuous heresay (tawdtur).^ The term Ijmd' in its etymological sense shows that its concept must have emerged when disagreement raised its head in Islam. A brief discussion of its semantics will prove our supposition. The root meaning of Ijmd' is 'to collect5, 'bring together', 'gather up', 'assemble', 'congregate', 'muster', or 'draw together'. The term has been derived probably from the Arabic idiom c-^JI ?**+?&gt;\ (I collected together from every quarter the camels?taken as spoils from the people to whom they belonged, and drove them away). It signifies simply 'the driving of camels together'.46 Abu Zuwayb, a huzaili poet, is generally quoted by the lexicographers in support of the meaning of the word (Ijmdc. He says: (The wild ass and her mates?seemed below in the hollow vale of Nubayic and the ravines that lead to the Dhu'l-Arja' steep, a fresh plundered herd of camels) ,47 The Arabic idiomv S^ki is an appropriate example to justify the sense of Ijmd6. The phrase means an open ground in which people are assembled, and they are not separated from each other lest they should go astray. The ground is, therefore, called mujmia'h because it unites them together.48 The word Ijmd6 is also used for binding the teats of a she-camel together with a tie.49 This shows that the term carries the root meaning of uniting separate things. Besides, the term has another meaning. It means 'composing and setting a thing which has been decomposed' (and unsettled); as an opinion which one determines, resolves, or decides upon. Therefore, it stands for determining, resolving or deciding upon an affair so as to make it firmly settled (after it had been unsettled in the mind) or after considering what might be its issues or results, and saying at one time 'I shall do this,' and at another time. T will do this.' Hence the phrase, ^ VI c^u^l or ^VlJ^ (I determined, resolved or decided upon the affair).50 The Qur'an used the word Ijmd6 in this connotation.5! The term, it is believed, has both the meanings i.e., unity and determination. The early scholars utilised it for the unification of the affairs of the community after a period of chaos, and for the established and agreed practice. The term, however, owes its origin to the pre-Islamic Arabic idioms. Whether the term of Ijmd6 was borrowed from the Stoics, as Professor Simon Van den Burgh presumes, is a difficult question to answer. It seems that this concept emerged in Islam as a socio-political necessity.</page><page sequence="15">IJMA', AN INTEGRATING FORCE IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY 403 And such social institutions arc universal in different cultures and religions. Conformity (taqlid) and Ijmac went hand in hand since the gate of Ijtihdd was closed. Rather conformity proved an integral factor in bringing about the operation of Ijma* as a regulating and binding force in medieval Islam. It is difficult to pinpoint the period of the closure of the gate of Ijtihdd and the domination of taqlid. We have discussed in detail elsewhere52 that personal allegiance in different regions of legal activity started since the second century of the Hijrah. This is the period when the early schools were in the process of formation. These trends culminated in the strict personal conformity during the fourth century of the Hijrah. The door of Ijtihdd was not closed down all of a sudden. But this was done by slowing down the creative thinking and original legal activity. We find some clues in the legal texts of the fourth century of the Hijrah how conformity permeated Islamic jurisprudence. Abu'l Hasan al-Karkhi (d. 340 A.H.) produced a tract on the principles of HanafI law. In this tract he lays down the following rules : "Any Qur'anic verse which contradicts the opinion of 'our masters' will be construed as abrogated, or the rule of preference will apply thereto. It is better that the verse in question be interpreted in such a way that it becomes reconciled with the opinion." Further he remarks : "Any tradition which contradicts the opinion of 'our masters' will be construed as abrogated, or it will be deemed that the tradition in question contra dicts some other parallel tradition (which coincides with the opinion of the masters). The argument will, therefore, be based on the parallel tradition (which conforms to the opinion). Or, if there is no parallel tradition, the rule of preference will be applied as was done by 'our masters'. In case the rule of preference be not applicable, the tradition will be interpreted in such a way that it harmonises with the opinion. The interpretation will be made according to the indication. If there is the indication of abrogation, it will be interpreted accordingly. If not, we shall apply some other method.'153 These two principles framed by al-Karkhi, an eminent authority of HanafI law, reflect the trend of the legal activity during the fourth century of the Hijrah. The 'opinion of our masters' was in the process of being converted into Ijrruf? the only mainstay for decisions. As a result of this conformistic attitude toward Islamic law, the Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet began to be interpreted in the light of the decisions of 'our masters' (early jurists) and not independently. The Iraqi jurists who were noted for their dynamism in legal thinking were not stamped with rigidity. But it</page><page sequence="16">404 AHMAD HASAN should be noted that the early jurists are themselves reported to have been opposed to conformity (taqlid) in legal matters.54 Al-Tabari (d. 310 A.H.) in his Ikhtildf al-Fuqahd' describes the disagreement of the early jurists, e.g., Abu Hanlfah, Malik, al-Awza'i and al-Shafi'i. on legal problems. But for the point on which they are agreed he uses the word ajmcfu (agreed). It is for the first time that the term Ijmd6 is markedly used for the agreement of a definite number of the jurists whose names are known. Malik uses this term in al-Muwat0 frequently for the general agreement of the jurists or people of Medina. The same practice is noticed in al-Shafpi and his contemporary jurists. It is, however, clear that disagreement and agreement were coeval, rather agreement grew out of disagreement. At a later date when law was standardised, disagreement was ruled out and agreement became the standard. Still at this stage of taqlid we find some jurists during the fourth century of the Hijrah differing from the early jurists. For instance, Abu Elanlfah, Abu Yusuf and al-Shaybani are agreed upon the unlawfulness of eating spiny-tailed lizard (al-dabb). Tahawi discusses this problem at full length and refutes the arguments of al-Shaybani in his Shark ma'dni'l-Athar.tt But this creative and independent thinking is rarely seen in the Middle Ages. Henceforth limited Ijtihdd within the framework of a specific school of law began, and independent ijtihdd came to a standstill. Consequently conformity (taqlid) took root in the legal sphere. Ijmd* recognised the authority of the four Sunni schools of law and negated the validity of the remaining early schools. Any opinion other than that of the four schools of law became a solitary opi nion carrying no weight. Conformity provided sustenance to Ijmd6 and a death-blow to creativity. Ijmd6 henceforth became the basis of religion, as was truly remarked; iCIjmde is the strap and support of the SharVah, and to it the Shari6ah owes its authenticity".56 This sort of rigidity and conformism resulted in the reaction against taqlid. Ibn IJazm (d. 456 A.H.), Ibn Taymiyah (d. 727 A.H.), Ibn Qayyim (d. 751 A.H.) and al-Shawkani (d. 1250 A.H.) expressed vehement opposition to taqlid and laid great stress on independent Ijtihdd.</page><page sequence="17">IJMI , AN INTEGRATING FORCE IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY 405 NOTES 1.
