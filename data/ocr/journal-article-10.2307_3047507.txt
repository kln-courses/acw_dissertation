<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PRADO EPIPHANY BY JEROME BOSCH* LOTTE BRAND PHILIP I SF the four large altarpieces by Jerome Bosch which have come down to us in their entirety and as originals, the one with the Epiphany in the Prado Museum (Fig. I) has the most traditional theological program. Whereas the Hay Wain in the Escorial, the so-called Garden of Delights in the Prado, and the Temptation of St. Anthony in Lisbon are subjects entirely new as a central theme in Christian altar painting, the Adoration of the Magi had often been represented before as the main subject of a large and important altarpiece. Students of the history of art have been aware that in the Prado Epiphany a traditional theme has been rendered in quite a new and untraditional manner, and scholars have sought to interpret this scene of the Adoration according to their knowledge of the fundamentally new aspects of the art of Jerome Bosch.' A satisfactory explanation, however, has not yet been attained. Nevertheless, there is one figure in the scene that furnishes us with the key to a complete interpretation, although it has not heretofore been recognized as a possible clue. The Adoration takes place in front of the stable of Bethlehem, represented as a tumble-down kind of shanty with two visible openings. In the opening on the right the head of a donkey in profile appears; in the opening at the left we see a strange and puzzling representation of a number of standing figures (Fig. 4)-2 This latter opening consists of the frame of a door with an adjacent window-like aperture separated by a wooden post. Standing in the doorway with his right hand against the post, and his left arm protruding through the window and resting on the sill, a half- clothed bearded man appears, visible almost in full. Behind this figure inside the hut we see the faces of five other men. The first is seen in full in the window opening, beside the face of the main figure. It is the face of an old man with white hair and beard who is holding the front figure with both hands. The other four faces appear further inside the hut, darker, less distinct and partially overlapped. The front figure is striking in its strange appearance, and is overloaded with symbols and attributes. Half-nude, his body showing through a sheer shirt, and draped in a scarlet cloak similar to that of Christ as he is represented during the Passion and after the Resurrection, with a crown of thorns around his turban-like helmet, this figure is a picture of the Jewish Messiah.

Fried- Inder, Die altniederlhindische Malerei, v, 1927, pp. 89f.; Charles de Tolnay, Jerdme Bosch, Basle, 1937, PP. 43f.; Ludwig von Baldass, Hieronymus Bosch, Vienna, 1943, pp. 39f., 60, 247f.; Jacques Combe, Jheronimus Bosch, Paris, 1946, pp. 42, 93f. 2. Friedlinder (op.cit, p. 90), interprets the group inside the hut as persons of the royal cortege of the three Kings. Tolnay, in a lecture at the University of Hamburg, 1932, suggested that the half-nude figure represented John the Presbyter, who, according to the legend, was a descendant of one of the three Magi and went, like his ancestor, again and again on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. In his book of 1937 (op.cit., p. 44), Tolnay interprets the group as the suite of the Kings waiting their turn "behind the scenes" to adore the Child, thus forming a second link of a chain of eternal adora- tion. Baldass (op.cit., pp. 40, 60, 248), also interprets the figures inside the hut as the following of the Kings. Sir Lionel Cust, in his article on the replica of the Prado painting at Petworth (Apollo, 1928, VIII, pp. 55ff.), takes the figures for the messengers sent by Herod to report upon the event, thus being the first writer on the subject who recognized the hostile attitude of the group. The only author who really stressed the fact of the hostile, heretical appearance of the figures is Combe (op.cit., pp. 42, 94), who interprets them as a symbol of heresy, as bad, untrustworthy shepherds who seem to spy upon the majestic scene. A precise interpretation, however, has not been attempted. D. Bax (Ontcijfering van Jeroen Bosch, The Hague, 1949, p. 248), refers to the group in the doorway in a short passage, calling it the suite of one of the Kings.</page><page sequence="2">268 THE ART BULLETIN identified with certainty by two of the attributes, which point to two different legends well-known in Jewish scriptures.3 The golden chain by which the arms of the figure are fettered points to a legend frequently mentioned in mediaeval Jewish literature, and the fact that the Messiah is chained and a prisoner forms a most important feature of this legend.' According to it, the Messiah is born on the day of the destruction of the Temple. From that time on, he lives in Paradise. He resides there as a king with an old chancellor and four privy counselors." He is anxious to rescue his suffering people, but is not allowed to do so until the right time has come. He is a young man of strength and beauty and so impatient to help the Jewish people that he is bound by a golden chain in order to restrain him from starting the work of redemption at the wrong time. He receives the visits of prophets and other Biblical personages who come to comfort him. When he learns anew of the misery of his people, he is overcome with rage and anger and tries to go to their rescue. His companions have to hold him back by force, and could not succeed in doing so without the golden chain by which the Messiah is bound. The other Jewish legend is found in the Babylonian Talmud.6 Here the Messiah, in accordance with the famous messianic prophecy of Isaiah 53:3, is a poor man stricken with disease and an outcast. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi asks Elijah: "When will the Messiah come?" "Go and ask him himself," is the reply. "Where is he sitting?" "At the entrance." "And by what sign may I recognize him?" "He is sitting among the poor lepers: all of them untie [their sores] all at once, and rebandage them together, whereas he unties and rebandages each separately, thinking, should I be counted (it being time for my appearance as the Messiah), I must not be delayed." The figure in Bosch's painting is characterized as a leper' by the white color of his skin and by a large sore on his leg visible through a fancy gold-framed transparent bandage which resembles the crystal tube in a metal setting familiar in reliquaries. That the painter of a late mediaeval altarpiece, or his clerical advisers, had knowledge of these very popular Jewish legends is in no way surprising. The study of Jewish books had never been abandoned during the Middle Ages and, especially during the time of Mysticism, Jewish material made its way into Christian ideology. Knowledge of Hebrew scriptures played an important part in the public and private disputations on the Messiah which were frequently held between Christian and Jewish theologians throughout the Middle Ages.8 It also played an important part in the 3. I am indebted to Mr. Abraham Berger of the New York Public Library for his help in pointing out the original source material for the two Jewish legends. 4. I came across this legend in reading Heinrich Heine's book, Ludwig B6rne (Werke, 7th ed., Elster, Hamburg, I840), where, in Book Iv, it is recounted in a very touching and poetical way. Reading this passage and recognizing the connection between the golden chain of the Jewish Messiah and the attribute given to the puzzling figure in Bosch's altarpiece was the starting point for the entire investigation presented in this paper. The legend about the Messiah in Paradise which occurs in different versions in several mediaeval Jewish scriptures is recounted in detail, and with distinct reference to the fact that the Messiah is chained, in the Midrash Conen, a work written before the eleventh century. Editions: Wilno, 1802; Lemberg, 1850; Adolph Jellinek, Jerusalem, 1938. (The passage in question can be found in the latter edition in Bet ha-Midrasch II, pp. 29f.) French translation: Jean-Joseph Brierre-Narbonne, Le Messie souffrant dans la litterature rabbinique, Paris, 1939, p. 64. The Pesikta Rabbati, a scripture still older (second half of the ninth century), recounts a different legend which, in one respect, however, is similar to the story in the Midrashl Conen. The Messiah also appears as a suffering person; he is kept a prisoner, but instead of being chained, he is put into an iron yoke. Editions: M. Friedmann, Vienna, i88o, pp. I59a and i6ia; Brierre-Narbonne, op.cit., pp. 32 and 35. References to the Messiah who is bound occur, according to the informa- tion given to me by Dr. Boaz Cohen, in Ibn Esra's Com- mentary on the Bible, Gloss on Canticles 7:6, and on Isaiah 52:13 (eleventh century). In none of the above-cited sources is the legend of the fettered Messiah actually told as a story. They do not give the reason why the Messiah is chained. This feature is only mentioned, and even in the Midrash Conen the text reads as though it were assumed that the legend was known. I have been unable to trace the real source of this apparently very old tale. Heine's book is, so far as I know, the only text where the story is actually told. 5. This feature appears only in Heine's report of the legend; it is not mentioned in any of the scriptures quoted in note 4. So far I have been unable to find an older source. 6. The Babylonian Talmud, English ed. by J. Epstein, London, 1935, Seder Nezikin, Sanhedrin 98a, p. 664. 7. Baldass (op.cit., p. 40), has noted that the person in question is a leper, but he takes the figure for a leprous noble- man in the attendance of the three Magi. See note 2. 8. According to Joseph Sarachek (The Doctrine of the Messiah in Medieval Jew~ish Literature, New York, 1932, p. 177), the principal disputations were: 1240 (Paris); 1263 (Nahmonides with Pablo Christiani before King James of Aragon); ca. 1373 (Pampeluna) ; 1375 (Burgos and Avila); February 1413 and November 1414 (Tortosa); ca. 1430</page><page sequence="3">THE PRADO EPIPHANY BY JEROME BOSCH 269 controversial literature, in which Jewish sources were published in Latin translations. In the Pugio Fidei by Raymundus Martinus, for instance, a controversy against Islamism and Judaism by a Spanish Dominican of the thirteenth century, the passage from the Babylonian Talmud about the leprous Messiah has been quoted and translated.! This book, however, or any later work in which one or both legends were mentioned,10 can hardly be considered as the direct source of the painting. Both legends, belonging to very old Jewish traditions, furnished the material for the answer to the usual question, "Why doesn't the Messiah come?"" It seems only natural that they appeared in this answer also, when the question was asked by a Christian. Thus these legends were probably known to Christians since very early times, forming a verbal Christian tradition which had been kept alive all through the Middle Ages, very likely through renewed oral information.12 That the Jewish Messiah in Bosch's Adoration stands for a symbol of the Synagogue is obvious from the way in which he and his companions are placed in the traditional settings of the Adoration scene. He appears in the door of the ruined hut, which itself is a symbol of the Old Law and is meant as such where it occurs in earlier Flemish paintings of the Adoration of the Magi and of the Nativity, as, for instance, in the painting by the Master of Flemalle in Dijon (Fig. 2) and in Roger's Adoration of the Magi in Munich. To portray the Synagogue as a declining structure is familiar in later mediaeval art. In the miniatures of some fourteenth century calendars-for instance, in the Breviaire de Belleville (Fig. 3)'"-the idea of Judaism in delapidation is rather drastically expressed by a building from which in successive months an Old Testament worthy pulls out a stone and hands it to an Apostle. Thus, at the end of the year, the structure has become a heap of ruins. It is possible, in my opinion, that the idea of comparing the Synagogue to a fallen structure may have originated in the text of a famous messianic prophecy of the Old Testament: Amos 9:11I. "In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old." This passage could also have been the basis for transforming the stable of Bethlehem into a ruined structure in pictures of the Nativity, thus giving it symbolic meaning as the fallen hut of David in which the son of David was born. (Granada). It is also known that Hildegard of Bingen had a disputation with the Jews of Bingen (twelfth century). See Hans Liebeschiitz, Das allegorische Weltbild der heiligen Hildegard von Bingen, Studien der Bibliothek Warburg, Leip- zig, Berlin, 1930, p. 159, note i. 9. Raymundus Martinus, Pugio Fidei adversus Mauros et Judeos, Leipzig, 1687, Secunda Pars, Cap. vI, 4, p. 351. Martinus also refers frequently to the legend about the Messiah in Paradise. He quotes the Pesikta Rabbati. The text of the Midrash Conen, however, with the reference to the chain, and the passages in the Commentary by Ibn Ezra do not seem to be mentioned by him, though the latter work is well known to him and frequently quoted. See note 4. For calling my atten- tion to the work by Martinus I am indebted to Prof. Louis Ginzberg, and to Dr. Boaz Cohen for help in the tedious task of checking the voluminous book for quotations. Io. In the introduction to his Treatise on the Messiah (Yeshuot Meshiho, ed., K6nigsberg, 186o, Introduction, p. 3) Isaac Abarvanel (1437-15o08), a contemporary of Bosch, alludes briefly to both of the legends. He remarks concerning those who ask complainingly "why the son of Jesse has not come to rule out of prison, why are the steps of his chariot late . . . it is the old plague of leprosy, they say." For quota- tion and translation of this passage I am indebted to Dr. Boaz Cohen. 1 i. Cf. Hermann Gunkel, Sch'pfung und Chaos, G6ttingen, 1895, P. 224. I2. It is probable that Bosch's personal source of informa- tion was a converted Jew named Jacob van Almaengien who, like the painter, was a member of the Confraternity of Our Lady in 's-Hertogenbosch. In his article, "Hieronymus Bosch in seiner Auseinandersetzung mit dem Unbewussten," in Du: Schweizerische Monatsschrift, xI, October 1951, pp. 7ff., Wil- helm Franger sets forth the details he discovered about this curious fellow-citizen of Jerome Bosch. This discovery, how- ever, does not seem to yield enough ground for the far-reaching conclusions which Fringer draws from it. According to Fringer, Jacob van Almaengien was the Grand Master of a secret sect for whom Bosch painted some of his altarpieces. The hypothesis that Bosch was a member of this heretic brother- hood, which is quite untenable and has already been refuted in some of its details by Bax (op.cit., pp. 297-305), and by Jan Mosmans (Maria en Sint Jan, on bekend en laat Schilder- werk van Jheronimus Bosch, 's-Hertogenbosch, I950, p. 20), was brought forward by Fringer in two previous studies: Wilhelm Frdnger, Hieronymus Bosch I Das Tausendjdhrige Reich, Grundziige einer Auslegung, Coburg, 1947 (English ed.: The Millennium of Hieronymus Bosch: Outlines of a New Interpretation, London, 1952); and Wilhelm Fringer, Die Hochzeit zu Kana.

The interesting feature here is that the donkey alone is represented, and this painting is, so far as I know, the only representation of its kind where such is the case. There exists a tradition in Christian iconography according to which the two animals have adopted a specific meaning. Whereas the ox that protected the Holy Child with its horns signifies the New Testament, the donkey that tried to uncover the Child with its teeth is a symbol of the old corrupt law. In some examples of the Nativity of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the idea becomes quite apparent, especially when St. Joseph is shown stopping the donkey in its evil inten- tions, as in one of the miniatures of the Book of Hours, Ms 303 of the Morgan Library in New York."1 A quite unmistakable representation of the ass as the animal of the Synagogue can be found in the earlier miniatures of Herrad of Landsberg's Hortus Deliciarum. In the large illustra- tion representing the Crucifixion, the female figure of the defeated Synagogue is depicted as actually riding a donkey, while the victorious Ecclesia is sitting on a fantastic animal, a combination of the four symbols of the Evangelists. Thus it becomes clear why Bosch represents only the ass without its companion. It is visible inside the hut as another symbol of the Old Law, forming a counterpart to the group at the left."5 Just as important, however, as the fact that the ass is represented alone is the circumstance that the animal is not rendered in full sight, but only partially. The picture visible in the frame is not a donkey but a donkey's head. With this observation we arrive at a still deeper insight into the meaning of this representation. That the Jews adored the head of a donkey in their Temple is one of the oldest calumnies against Judaism known in history."6 The accusation of ass-worship, a familiar weapon of Jew-haters since antiquity, which also appears in one of the apocryphal Christian books," may even be the underlying reason for regarding the ass as the animal of Synagogue, and for the identification, in mediaeval art and poetry, of the donkey at the Nativity with the Old Law. Jerome Bosch very probably was aware of the original meaning of the symbol, and the donkey head in his painting is a far less harmless reference to Judaism than is the diaper-eating ass of an earlier Nativity scene. As a matter of fact, the whole scene-the hut in decay, the Jewish Messiah with his companions, and the large animal head-is not harmless at all. It is not only a representation of the Synagogue but an elaborate illustration of evil, as such. We arrive at this conclusion when we seek to answer the question as to who the man in the doorway really is. This question can be approached from two different angles. We can simply ask where the Jewish Messiah occurs in Christian ideology; or, on the other hand, start to decipher the various other attributes of the man in the hut, and the many symbolic details on the front wall of the building, above the doorway. The two paths lead to the same conclusion. In Christian ideology the Jewish Messiah occurs only once. He is the Antichrist, the false prophet who will be sent to the Jews as a punishment because they refuse to believe in the true Messiah.'8 14. See Meta Harrsen, "Morgan Manuscript 303, A Book of Hours for Paris Use," Die Graphischen Kiinste, N.F., III, 1938, pp. 91-97, where examples in fourteenth and fifteenth century art and their parallels in earlier mediaeval poetry are named; cf. also Erwin Panofsky, Albrecht Diirer, Princeton, 3d ed., 1948, II, p. 7.

The book gives the reason for Zacharias' being slain by the Jews in the Temple. It relates that Zacharias detected that the creature adored by the Jews had the shape of an ass, and that they killed him for having revealed this secret. 18. In the collective Christian tradition, based chiefly upon the famous passage in II Thessalonians 2:8-i2, its parallel in John 5:43, and the exegesis thereof by the Fathers of the Church, the Antichrist is a satanic pseudo-Messianic figure who comes from the midst of the Jews and is accepted by them as their Messiah. Thomas Malvenda in his voluminous work De Antichristo (Rome, 1604; Valencia, 1621; Leyden,</page><page sequence="5">THE PRADO EPIPHANY BY JEROME BOSCH 271 Before interpreting the other attributes of the figure and the details of the hut it seems necessary to survey the origin and development of the legend of the Antichrist and to point out its content in the late Middle Ages." It was already fully developed in the pre-Christian Jewish tradition, deriving in part from Daniel, but no doubt to some extent independent of the prophetic books. Its roots are probably in a very ancient primeval myth of creation which was later transformed into an expectation of events at the end of the world. In Babylonian mythology the tale appears with the following features. The Dragon of Chaos, a frightful marine monster who had already been defeated in a primordial battle before the creation of the heavenly lights, was again to rise in the last days and contend in heaven-storming battle with the divine power. In this final battle before the end of the world, the Dragon, incarnation of the power of evil, was to be killed by the son of the upper gods. Although in popular Jewish belief this battle was simply the final struggle of Satan directly with God, anthropomorphic transformation, which led to the legend of the Antichrist, took place in pre-Christian times. The appearance of the Messiah is spoken of as occurring at the end of all struggles and judgments, and gradually the last enemy of the Kingdom of God came to be thought of as the antitype of the Messiah. Thus the expectation of a personal opponent to the Messiah is found in pre-Christian Judaism. The writer of the Revelation of John thus found a fully developed tradition of the legend, and the Apocalypse as well as the passages in the Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament which deal with the Antichrist are based on such a tradition.20 The legend appears to have contained the following elements: The coming of the Antichrist was prevented by the Roman power. When this power fell, the Antichrist, not of foreign birth but a Jewish false Messiah, would establish himself in the Temple at Jerusalem and require men to worship him. By means of his miraculous power he would convert the world to his side. Later, his real character would be exposed; having fled into the wilderness, the believing Jews would be pursued by him; and he then would be slain by the true Messiah with the breath of his mouth.21 The legend, having the characteristics of secret lore principally transmitted by oral tradition, was reconstructed through the analysis of other Christian and Jewish scriptures, such as the Jewish and Christian Sibylline writings, the later Christian and Jewish Apocalypses, and the patristic commentaries on the passages of the Bible referring to the Antichrist. Far from containing only later versions or embellishments of the legend, these scriptures show its original features more clearly than the canonical Christian books. Owing to its double character as a mythical tale and a political prophecy, the legend constantly assumed new aspects under the shifting conditions of time. The identification of hated rulers of the present or past with the Antichrist was usual; they were also often called forerunners or images I647), in which the traces of the old Antichrist tradition are carefully collected, states (ed. Leyden, 1647, Lib. III, Cap. XI, p. 158): "Judeos servare in Babylonica falsam &amp; ementitam successionem Principum tribus Judae, &amp; stirpis Danidicae, ex qua falsum suum Messiam expectant: cum tamen recepturi sint verum Antichristum, natum ex Tribu Dan." For the Antichrist as the Jewish Messiah, cf. Wilhelm Bousset, The Antichrist Legend, London, 1896 (trans. from the German: Der Anti- christ in der Oberlieferung des Judenthums, des Neuen Testa- ments und der alten Kirche, G6ttingen, 1895), pp. 133-138, 166-174, 182, 186.

I, Munich, Staatsbibliothek, ed. by Kurt Pfister, Leipzig, 1925. 20. The name "Antichrist" is first found in the Epistles of John (I. 2:18, 22; 4:3 11.7). In the earlier Jewish tradition, the name of the Anti-Messiah is Belial or Beliar; in later Jewish apocalyptic writings he is called Armillus. The Johan- nine Apocalypse gives his name as Apollyon or Abbadon. 21. In this brief passage the author has adopted the very concise formulation by Beckwith, op.cit., p. I95.</page><page sequence="6">272 THE ART BULLETIN of him. In earlier times the Antichrist most frequently appeared as Antiochus Epiphanes or Nero Redivivus. This led to separately developed versions which might even appear side by side in the same scripture, with the effect that, especially in the earlier sources, the Antichrist often has a double.22 However, the mythical character of the figure always remained predominant. Thus even in the later Christian scriptures the prototype of the Antichrist, the old monster or dragon, left its traces. Hence, the Antichrist was sometimes still identified with the devil himself. About 954, at the request of Queen Gerberga, the monk Adso wrote a treatise on the Antichrist which has often been called the classical version of the Antichrist legend.23 It contains practically the same features as the eschatological discourses of the high Middle Ages, such as the passages on the Antichrist by Honorius of Autun, Hildegard of Bingen, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, and Bonaventura. Here we already have all the details which formed the concept of the Antichrist in the late Middle Ages, and which occur in the popular woodcut books and the miracle plays of the second half of the fifteenth century. After the time of Jerome and Chrysostom, the assumption that the Antichrist is the devil himself practically dies out of ecclesiastical tradition. He is human, and in the popular belief of the fifteenth century is not even the son of Satan. He is to be begotten by a sinful father with his own daughter. At his conception the devil is of course present. He comes from the tribe of Dan and will be born in Babylon shortly before the end of time and the Last Judgment. He is circumcised in Jerusalem and tells the Jews that he is the true Messiah whom they have expected for such a long time. In Bethsaida he leads a very immoral life, and in Chorazin he engages in the study of black magic, learning conjuring tricks in order to deceive men. In the meantime, the Jews begin to rebuild their Temple in Jerusalem, thinking that their Messiah has come. He shows himself in the old Holy Places, where Christ lived and taught, preaching a new devilish law and burning the old Holy Books. He works signs and wonders, among which the old magician's trick of making a dead and dried-up tree blossom again plays an important part. He even raises the dead through the power of the evil spirit. Thus he gains an enormous number of followers and great power. Finally, he sends messengers to the three Kings of the world and wins them over through money, treasure, and miracles. The connection of the Antichrist with the Kings of the world24 is a very old and original feature of the legend, as is his relation with Gog and Magog,25 the ruthless warrior hordes, the terrible enemies who appear at the end of all days directed by their seducer, the Antichrist. In the late mediaeval legend they join in the great exodus of all the nations to whom he has sent his messengers. All these nations are coming to Jerusalem to worship the Antichrist. In the course of the conversion of those who follow his call, he marks the ones who believe in him with a sign inscribed on their foreheads and right hands, and he starts a cruel and pitiless persecution of those who refuse to follow him. Fearing the terrible new tortures which the Antichrist has invented, the few who remain faithful flee into the wilderness. In the meantime, Enoch and Elijah, the two Old Testament prophets, who have never died but have been conveyed alive to Paradise, have left their residence in order to preach against the impostor. They convict him of falsehood and denounce him as a liar. But, as he did with his other 22. In the Johannine Apocalypse the Antichrist figure occurs occasionally in as many as three different mutations. See Bousset, op.cit., p. 188. 23. Adso, Libellus de Antichristo, J. P. Migne, ed., Patro- logise Cursus Completus: Patrologia Latina, cI, pp. i29I-I298. 24. Though the number of the Kings given in the dif- ferent sources varies, it is usually three. This seems to be an original feature of the oldest form of the saga which left its traces in Daniel 7:24: ". .. and shall subdue three kings." It formed part of a tradition which was still known to Irenaeus and Hippolytus, and probably the same which was the basis for Jerome's commentary on Daniel (Bousset, op.cit., pp. 64f.). Jerome knows that the three Kings will be the King of Egypt, of Libya, and of Ethiopia (ibid., p. 28).

However, after three days, their bodies are raised up again from the dead by the Archangels. In accordance with the axiom, "The Antichrist is the ape of Christ," he now continues his treacherous imitation of the life of Jesus. He pretends to be dead, and after being mourned he fakes his resurrection. He makes fire fall from heaven upon his followers, thus imitating the event of Pentecost. Finally he calls together all the people, claiming that he is going to perform the Ascension. He actually flies upward toward heaven, but there, by the command of Christ, he is struck down by Michael the Archangel, who kills him and thrusts him into the Gehenna of fire. Upon his death his servants and followers begin to lead a tumultuous, dissolute life full of gaiety and diversion. However, Enoch and Elijah again take up their preaching, and in expectation of the imminence of the last day bring mankind back to Christianity. Then follow the fifteen frightening forebodings of the end of time and the Last Judgment. Such is the legend of the Anti- christ in the popular version of the fifteenth century. The Antichrist in Bosch's altarpiece, besides being designated as the Jewish Messiah by the two attributes discussed above, is particularly characterized as a Jew by his long, dark beard. This fits into the specific context of the program of the altar and is remarkable, since in the contemporary block-books the Antichrist always appears as a handsome, blond, and beardless youth (Fig. 5). In art the representation of the Antichrist has never developed a standard type.26 The rarely represented figure has a different appearance in each new context. Thus most of the other symbols of Bosch's Antichrist are just as unique as the chain and the leper sore taken from the Jewish legends. The scarlet cloak and the crown of thorns are doubtless meant as indications of his deceitful imitation of the life and Passion of Christ. The fact that the thorns are wound around a metal turban probably insinuates the falsehood of this imitation. The thorns cannot really hurt him.27 On top of the turban Bosch's Antichrist wears a glass through which one of the thorny twigs grows upward and is transformed into a living branch with leaves and blossoms. There can hardly be any doubt that this is an allusion to the Antichrist's magic trick of making a dead tree blossom, a miracle illustrated in the Hortus Deliciarum and in the printed Antichrist books of the late fifteenth century (Figs. 5, 6). The glass is probably simply the alchemistic gadget used at the magic performance. Between the legs of the figure a little bell, undoubtedly also a symbol, hangs down from a ribbon adorned with frogs. The frogs, though a familiar general emblem of evil,28 seem to imply here a special allusion to the Antichrist. They probably signify the unclean spirits who, according to Revelation 16:13-14, look like frogs and come out of the mouth of the false prophet as the messengers who go forth unto the Kings of the earth.29 26. Karl Kiinstle (Ikonographie der christlichen Kunst, Freiburg, 1928, p. 524) expresses his astonishment that the figure of the Antichrist, playing such an important part in the homiletic and poetic literature of the Middle Ages, is so rarely represented in art. He names only a representation of the Last Judgment in S. Maria in Porto near Ravenna and Signorelli's fresco in Orvieto. He does not mention, however, the many existing book illustrations depicting the figure, such as the miniatures of the Hortus Deliciarum, in which Antichrist is repeatedly represented, the woodcuts of the German fifteenth century books on the "Endchrist" and the late mediaeval illus- trations of the Revelation. In one of the woodcuts of Diirer's Apocalypse (B. 73), the Antichrist has been discovered by Clemens Sommer ("Albrecht Diirer's Woodcuts of the Apoca- lypse," in University of North Carolina Record, Research in Progress, xxI, no. 371, October 1941, Graduate School Series, no. 40, p. 14o). 27. The turban itself is the usual exotic attire to characterize the man from afar. The thorny twig has also another evil symbolic meaning; it is an attribute of the fool and madman. In the St. Anthony altarpiece it appears on the head of a figure, the possible interpretation of which as the Antichrist is con- sidered by Bax, and it occurs in numerous other compositions by Bosch. See Bax, op.cit., especially pp. i i, 97, 199, and figs. 3 and 38. I think that the origin of this symbolism is Biblical (Proverbs 26:9). The fact that the figure in the hut is nude, besides being an allusion to the Christ-figure of the Passion and Resurrection, has unguestionably also an evil meaning, "nuditas criminalis." See Petrus Berchorius, Dic- tionarii sev repertorii moralis . . . pars prima-tertia, Venice, 1583, "Nudus, Nuditas." I owe my acquaintance with this passage to the kind information of Dr. William S. Heckscher. 28. Bax (op.cit., pp. 33, 37, 43, Io4, 117, 302), giving an abundance of examples, specifies the manifold evil meanings which frog and toad have assumed in art and literature (p. 33, notes 19, 2o, as symbol of the Jews). 29. Cf. the very interesting passage by Gunkel (op.cit., p. 387, note 2) dealing with the mythological origin of the symbol; and Bousset, op.cit., pp. I89f.</page><page sequence="8">274 THE ART BULLETIN There are various possibilities for the interpretation of the bell and, in fact, the little symbol seems to make several allusions. As we shall see later, it happens frequently in the art of Jerome Bosch that ideas taken from different contexts are amalgamated and find their expression in one single visual symbol. Besides being a familiar instrument of the fool who, in fifteenth century ideology, is still identical with the sinner and evildoer, the bell is also an object worn by shepherds. Although here the bell differs considerably in shape from the bell of the tree-climbing shepherds in the same panel, it probably nevertheless characterizes the false Messiah as the Bad Shepherd. (This would correspond with one of the leading ideas behind the painting, an idea which will later be discussed in detail.) The bell, however, indubitably has still another signification. It is the bell of the Jewish High Priest who, as the particular context of Bosch's painting indicates, is the Jewish High Priest in a very specific sense.80 The distinct juxtaposition of the Antichrist with the ass in the two openings of the decaying hut makes him appear as the priest of the ass. Bosch has unquestionably represented him as such. This representation is reminiscent of the afore-mentioned story recounted by Epiphanius, in which the old calumny of Jewish ass-worship was repeated." According to the writer of the book, the donkey adored by the Jew had a priest, and at the hour of worship, when the priest entered the Temple, the animal hid inside so that nobody might detect the "likeness of its shape." The priest, so said the writer of the book, was commanded by the lawgiver to wear bells. He gives as the reason for this regulation the fact that the animal would thus hear the priest entering and be able to hide in time. It is, of course, not intimated that Bosch must have known the lost apocryphal book or Epiphanius' quotation. It is very probable, however, that he knew the story or a similar one, and that the Antichrist's bell is meant also as the warning bell of the donkey's priest. A most striking feature of Bosch's depiction of the Antichrist is the object in his left hand, which looks like a large metal vessel. Compared with the size of the figure holding it, it is much too large to be a crown or a helmet. However, if we compare its size with that of the King's head next to it, disregarding the laws of perspective, we find that it would fit perfectly. It may very well be meant as the helmet of this figure, especially since its coloring and jewels match those of the King's cape- like collar. The head-covers of the other Kings are both'represented in the painting, and it seems very improbable that the second King alone should be shown as not owning a hat or a helmet. In the hand of the Antichrist, however, the object has adopted a specific signification. Turned upside down and much too large to look like the covering for a human head, it has become an attri- bute of Antichrist himself. With its large opening on top and small aperture at the bottom it is reminiscent of the large metal bowls that were still used in the seventeenth century as the middle part of a fire pan, the top opening serving for the fuel and the small hole below to let in the draft. The oven is in fact the only fixed attribute which the Antichrist figure had acquired during the Middle Ages. This is the instrument which the Antichrist probably carried in all the mystery plays. It can be proved from early sixteenth century municipal bills in Dresden that it was this object which was carried by the person who played the part of the Antichrist in the Saint John's Day procession of this city.82 The burning oven occurs also in a Low German poem on the Antichrist.8 That the oven came to be the Antichrist's attribute has its roots in Revelation 9:2, and in the allegorical interpretations of this passage. In addition, a comparison is made between Nebuchadnezzar, who thrust the three children into the fiery furnace, and the Antichrist, who in his time will throw the three Kings of the world-that is, entire mankind-into the fire of tribulation.4 30.

Thus he shapes the bottomless vessel into a picture of Hell. According to Dante's conception, the Inferno is a funnel-shaped structure and consists of a vestibule and nine circles, the successive circles narrowing as they descend to the lower end of the cone. In Botticelli's illustrations of Dante the introductory chart of the Inferno gives a picture of this structure (Fig. 7)." If one compares this Diagram of the Inferno by Botticelli with the attribute of the Antichrist by Bosch, striking similari- ties will be found. That Bosch knew the illustrations of Dante by his contemporary is not altogether impossible, but need not necessarily be assumed. The basis for the relationship of the two representations is the general conception of Hell common in Europe and derived from Dante's description. The companions by whom the false Messiah is surrounded are doubtless meant as his ministers, often referred to in the patristic commentaries and in later eschatological literature.36 In the same way as Christ is accompanied by his Apostles, Antichrist has his disciples and messengers who propagate his evil law. According to Ambrosiaster,37 they are human, and they are called unclean spirits in the apocalyptic text because "demons shall dwell in them and shall speak through their mouths." In the German fifteenth century mystery play Von den Herz'gen von Burgund, which; of all the Antichrist plays that have come down to us is the one showing the most prominent anti-Semitic tendency, the figure is accompanied by a number of Jews.3 In Bosch's altarpiece, however, the ministers are not characterized as Hebrews but show a variety of types, including a man of Negroid features. This probably is intended to indicate the widespread influence of their master, whose apostles are recruited from all nations of the world."3 The burlesque types are reminiscent of the inclination of the mediaeval stage to represent the wicked as comical persons and to enliven the action through their boisterous buffoonery. The Antichrist's chief companion, the frightful old man who holds him with both hands, is probably the same person who appears with the opponent of Christ in a number of mystery plays, and who is his chief adviser, sometimes called the "doctor.""? Bosch represents him in such a terrifying way, with a dark purplish face and a glowing red nose, that one is almost tempted to see in him the Devil in person.4* Above the infernal group, at the top of the door of the ruined cottage, the breaches in the wood- work are stuffed with bundles of straw (Fig. 8). Straw is a symbol of the wicked and of the false prophets, who in numerous passages of the Old Testament are compared with remnants of threshed grain ready to be thrown into the furnace.42 Still further up, directly below the roof, the decaying building shows curious formations of rotting roofing-felt, with a handful of straw tied and attached to it by a piece of cord. At the left, placed on the upper crossbeam of the cottage, a lizard and a little owl appear as additional symbols of uncleanness and devastation.43 The bunch of straw with little flowers spread out on top may allude 35.

Bax, op.cit., pp. 52, 95, 215, 307, and especially p. 0io. The owl is also unclean (Leviticus 11 :6, I7), and indicates devastation (Isaiah 13:21 and 14:11). The material adduced by Bax to illustrate the symbolism of the owl is enormous. For the many page numbers, see his "Register," p. 319: s.v. "uil." Bax does not, however, give, the important passages in Isaiah, nor does he quote John 3:20, the passage which obviously formed the basis for the owl being used as</page><page sequence="10">276 THE ART BULLETIN to the bundle of tares mentioned in Matthew 13:30, but in any case, with its long ends coming down like rays, it looks like a star. In combination with the cloud-like shape of the decaying roofing- felt, it is doubtlessly meant to be a fake star in a fake heaven, a symbol of the fake Messiah. This false heaven with its false star forms a contrast to the real sky with the real star of the Saviour represented in brightest cloudless beauty at the top of the panel. Taken as a whole, the Antichrist with his companions at the left and the large animal head at the right (Fig. 13), the two representations framed by the hut and distinctly contraposed to each other, look like an illustration of an idea expressed in the Apocalypse. In Revelation 19:20 (and again in 20:Io) the false prophet who deceived men through miracles and the beast whose image was worshiped are referred to in connection with each other. Both appear as representatives of the evil power, and according to the apocalyptic prophecy they are to be defeated and "cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone." In the text of Revelation, the "beast" occurs as the double of the anthropomorphic Antichrist." It is quite obvious that the writer had a dragon in mind; the apocalyptic text, however, does not give any description of the creature. Thus in Bosch's painting the "beast whose image was worshiped" can appear as a donkey. It is interesting to observe how Bosch achieves an elaborate scenic representation of evil which combines an idea of the book of Revelation with familiar features of the pictorial tradition. The beast- idol of Revelation 19 is represented by the painter as the traditional ass of the Adoration scene, the "tertium comparationis" being the old calumny of Jewish ass-worship. The false prophet appears in the disguise of the traditional attendant of one of the Kings, although actually charac- terized as the priest of the ass-idol, and that a man with a Negroid face appears among his com- panions, a feature paralleled in the traditional following of the three Kings, makes the disguise still more perfect. The traditional decaying hut of the Adoration scene, already implying the concept of the declining Synagogue, now actually adopts the signification of the Jewish Temple in forming the shelter for the ass-idol and its priest. The somewhat speculative method of amalgamating ideas taken from different spheres into an organic pictorial unity is characteristic of the art of Jerome Bosch. It is to a great extent responsible for the mysterious charm of his paintings. The modern spectator is usually familiar with only a very few of these ideas, and is hardly ever aware of the context from which they are taken and of their complicated interrelations. For him, chiefly attracted by the pictorial qualities of the painting, this specific kind of representation has only the additional appeal of abstruseness. For the art-lover of his own time, however, Bosch's pictures must have been a most fascinating experience.45 Recog- nizing familiar ideas in a brilliant, new, and surprising combination must have induced an immediate psychological effect comparable to the pleasure given by a clever joke. Besides the elements discussed above, Bosch's representation of evil includes a number of features taken from still another context. These derive from the ideas of a Biblical parable found in John Io, the parable of the Good and Bad Shepherd. This chapter of the fourth Gospel provided the painter with some of the basic ideas of his representation of evil concentrated in and around the decaying hut, and furnished him, as will be shown later, with one of the leading thoughts of his entire composition. An odd feature of Bosch's scene of the Adoration is the unusual way in which the shepherds are represented (Figs. 9, I1I). Not only is it remarkable that one of them is peering through the defective wall like a spy, but that his companions should choose to climb up the tree and lie down the symbol of Jews, sinful people, and all vices that fear the light. Cf. also the passages on the owl in H. W. Janson, Apes and Ape Lore in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Lon- don, 1952, especially pp. 178 and 196, note 9I. 44. Cf. Bousset, op.cit., pp. 183-188. 45. Philip II of Spain, who owned the altarpiece discussed in this paper, though living a hundred years later than Bosch, was probably still able to "read" the paintings without "re- search." The pleasure he must have found in deciphering them possibly accounts to a great extent for his enormous apprecia- tion of the artist's work.</page><page sequence="11">THE PRADO EPIPHANY BY JEROME BOSCH 277 on the roof of the cottage in order to look upon the scene is an absolutely unique way to represent the Adoration of the Shepherds. In fact, Bosch does not really represent them as adoring, but rather uses the traditional figures of the shepherds to add another feature to his representation of evil. The cottage in the center panel of Bosch's altarpiece is not only the stable of Bethlehem and the fallen hut of David, symbol of the Old Law, but also the symbolic sheepfold of the parable told in John. In John 10o:7-9 the Lord calls himself the sheepfold's door, emphasizing that all who enter through this door will be saved, and all who came before him he calls thieves and robbers. In Bosch's presentation, likewise, the door of the stable is still occupied by the "thieves and robbers," the Antichrist with his companions. Bosch's Antichrist is undoubtedly also the Bad Shepherd of the Johannine Gospel. He is the hireling described in John 10:12-13 who sees the wolf coming and flees. It is not only the figure standing in the door with the bell hanging between his legs that proves the relation of the picture to the Biblical passage; it is, above all, the strange behavior of the shepherds. The chapter begins with the words of the Lord: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber." This "climbing up some other way," sign of the foolish behavior of the lost soul who does not enter through Jesus, the door, is certainly what Bosch wanted to illustrate by the strange way the shepherds are depicted. The shepherds in Bosch's painting are thus another symbol of evil and perdition. They are not represented as the worshipers of Christ, but belong to the realm of the fallen hut. The way may have been prepared for this very strange reinterpretation of a traditional feature of Christian iconography-turning it into its very opposite-by some lost representation of the parable of the Good and Bad Shepherd invented by Jerome Bosch before he painted the Prado altarpiece. It may be that Brueghel's representation of the Good Shepherd, which has come down to us as an engraving, shows a reflection of this composition (Fig. io)."4 In the engraving the thieves' climbing up the roof is a very prominent feature. The complex representation of the hut in Bosch's painting is composed in such a clever, cunning way, hiding its real meaning by the use of traditional features, that the naY've worshiper was probably not much bewildered or disturbed by it. In the compositional context of the central panel, the representation of the hut forms the partition between the scene in the foreground and the scenery behind. It works as a screen separating the Madonna and the Child and the three worshiping Kings with the Negro boy-servant from the landscape background. In order to develop a tabernacle for the Madonna, who is really sitting in front of the actual building, Bosch invented a free-standing additional wall which, at the right side of the hut, is joined at an angle to the front wall of the cottage. Thus he finds the way to form a corner for the Madonna, and by elongating the roof which rests in the rear on this additional wall, he creates a canopy, though only a very slight one, for the divine Mother with her Child. The front corner of the roof is supported by a tree trunk. It is the only part of the hut which actually reaches into the foreground of the picture. This trunk separates the adorers from the object of their adoration, dividing the width of the panel in the pleasing proportions of the "golden section." The trunk, however, not only separates the Madonna with the Child from the Kings, but also functions as one of the outlines which hold the two divine figures apart from their infernal surroundings. This becomes clear when we look at the elements of the painting as they are arranged in the two-dimensional plane, and forget for a moment about their layout in three-dimensional space. To look at paintings in such a way was still natural to the 46.

The modern observer has to concentrate on it, especially when con- fronted with a composition in which the laws of perspective are generally observed. Looking in this way, therefore, at the figure of the Madonna (Fig. I ), we notice that it is framed by three very distinct lines formed by the wooden parts of the hut: the straight line of the post at the right, the broken line of the roof, and the curved line of the tree trunk. The demarcation at the bottom, rather than the frame of the painting, is the lower outline of the Madonna's dress connecting the two wooden posts at their ends. The curved line of the tree trunk cuts the satanic donkey out of the immediate neighborhood of the divine figures, the lines of the two other wooden parts do the same with the shepherds. Only two elements of the entire representation are included in the region of the deity, the gift of the oldest King and the face of the elderly kneeling shepherd peering through the hole in the wall. That the golden gift is included in the divine region is hardly accidental. Representing Abraham's Sacrifice, it is the only element of the panel which alludes to the Crucifixion, the only symbol hinting at the completion of the work of the Redemption. The human face in the rear of the Madonna looks as if it were behind the bars of a cage.47 There is another face appearing at its side, darker, farther away and overlapped by the bars in such a manner that the features are almost entirely covered, and one cannot even recognize whether it is male or female. The face of the elderly man, however, is very distinct; it bears a worn, disappointed expression, much in contrast to the merry faces and the boisterous behavior of his foolish com- panions. He is very eager to catch a glimpse of the deity, whom he can see only from the back through the bars, and who for him seems to be entirely out of reach. There is no doubt that he belongs to the foolish crowd. He is a fool and sinner like all the others, and perhaps destined to perdition like his companions." Yet he very much longs for salvation and, I think, it is as a symbol of this human longing that his face is included in the divine region. I am unable to name a Biblical passage or any other text as a firm base for this interpretation. I am convinced, however, that a text existed which provided the painter with the idea. If this free interpretation is correct, the human face behind the bars, as well as the golden gift, the two details represented in close relation with the divine figures, would have a very intimate connection with each other. While the latter typifies the act of Redemption, the first would be a symbol for the human need of it.9 While the Madonna with the Holy Child is distinctly separated from all the infernal symbols of the picture, the spectacular figures of the adorers are depicted in the closest relation with them. The Antichrist fills the space between the standing Negroes and the two kneeling Kings; the donkey appears between the latter worshipers and the tree trunk that divides the group from the figure of the Madonna. The complex of the hut is, in its larger part, the actual background for the three Magi. This is no accidental feature of the composition. Bosch actually saw a very close inner relation between the Antichrist and the three Kings. The fact that the Antichrist holds the helmet of the second King makes this relation quite clear. Jacques Combe has already mentioned that in the attire of one of the Kings there may be signs which point to the survival of evil.50 The chief representation, however, on the pompous collar of the younger kneeling King (Fig. 13) obviously shows the Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon; and 47. Representation of one of the shepherds peeping through a hole in the wall had already occurred earlier. Cf. the en- graving by Master A. G. (Albrecht Glockenton?) (B.I). Max Lehrs, Geschichte und kritischer Katalog des deutschen, nieder- lindischen und franz6sischen Kupferstichs im XV. Jahrhundert, vI, Vienna, 1927, pl. I55, no. 408, text p. 92. 48. The cage-like bars in Bosch's painting, reminiscent of the Nativity of the Master of Fl1malle, may symbolize the fact that the human soul is caught in its own sins. It is certainly not without significance that the bars belong to the evil hut. The bird in the cage was probably a symbol for the soul caught in its sins. For the bird as a symbol of the human soul, cf. Janson, op.cit., pp. 178 and 196, note 90; and Psalm 124:7. 49. It is tempting to think that the painter uses his own features for the face of this figure, which is very similar to the face of the pointing man behind the curtain who appears at the left side of the reverse of the same altarpiece (Figs. 21, 24); and which is in keeping with other faces discussed by D. Bax as self-portraits (op.cit., p. 19; notes 17, 18, 19, on pp. 20-21). 50. Jacques Combe, "Analytical Notices," no. io8, op.cit., p. 94.</page><page sequence="13">1.

These two representations taken from the Old Testa- ment prefigure the New Testament story of the Adoration of the Magi. The gift of the oldest King represents Abraham's Sacrifice prefiguring the Crucifixion of Christ. Thus each of the three Kings is depicted with at least one symbol the integrity of which is above suspicion. Other symbols on the costumes of the Kings, however, are allusions to heresy and signs of the equivocal character of their wearers. Not only are the waggish fish and bird decorations of the garments worn by the Negroes symbols of evil, but also the helmet in the foreground belonging to the oldest King and the second King's helmet held by the Antichrist show emblems of obviously diabolic character." This, however, is not very surprising. The wise men from the East who, according to Matthew 2, came to pay homage to the new-born King of the Jews were pagans and magi and their heathen character is very much emphasized in the Gospel. In fact, the chief tendency of the Biblical story- and on this all ancient and modern expounders agree-is to illustrate the fact that the Jews rejected the true Messiah, while the pagans made the long journey in order to worship the future Redeemer of the world." In Bosch's painting, however, the three Kings are not represented as pagan converts in contrast to the unbelieving Jews." On the contrary, they have a very intimate relation to the Antichrist, who is here characterized as the Jewish Messiah. The emblems of their costumes cannot be interpreted as symbols of converted paganism, but indicate rather that their wearers are under the temptation of the wicked. As shown above, it is characteristic for Jerome Bosch to combine ideas taken from different contexts. The equivocal character of the worshiping Kings is another example of such a conjunction. In the mediaeval tradition, the wise men from the East who, in the text of the Gospel, are only called magi, have become three kings who have left their countries in order to bring gifts to the infant Messiah. The text of Psalm 72:Io, which has made its way into the liturgy of the Epiphany, is probably chiefly responsible for this concept, and the passages of the Apocalypse in which Christ is called "King of Kings" (Revelation 17:14, 19:16) are very much in accord with this conception. In mediaeval representations of the Epiphany, Christ is the King of Kings, and the three Kings symbolize the three continents of the world known at that time." Thus compositions depicting the Adoration of the Magi are representations of Christ as the Master of the entire world. This explains to a great extent why, after the turn of the fourteenth century, this subject becomes more and more the prevailing theme in Christian altar-painting, and why so many altarpieces of the fifteenth 51. "A swan is offered to a king" (ibid., p. 94) is a mis- interpretation. Another incorrect interpretation is "Noah's Sacrifice" for the scene under the Visit of the Queen of Sheba on the younger King's collar (Tolnay, Baldass, Combe). It is rather, as Prof. Kurt Bauch kindly informed me, the Sacrifice of Manoah. 52. The big fish eating the small one at the hem of the boy-attendant symbolizes evil in a greedy world, where the powerful devour the weak (Bax, op.cit., p. 29). The apple on the boy's head, which occurs in very similar manner on the heads of the Negroes and Negresses in Bosch's Garden of Delights (Combe, op.cit., pls. 88 and 89), is probably a symbol of Superbia, signifying arrogance (Bax, op.cit., p. 20o, note 3, and p. 88, note 120). It is possible, however, that it has, besides, a sinful sexual meaning. The pictured flange at the hem of the Negro King's tunic definitely presents symbols of sin in a sexual sense. For the erotic meaning of the bird, cf. ibid., pp. I9, io8. The combination of birds' bodies with human heads probably has its origin in the popular com- parison of human beings with birds (ibid., pp. 6of.). For the sexual meanings of the bird picking at a fruit, cf. ibid., p. 66. This representation is, however, also a symbol of the vice of Superbia. Cf. Brueghel's Superbia (ibid., p. 7o, note i1). On the helmet of the eldest King, the two herons with fruits in their beaks are obviously evil emblems. Bosch frequently uses the long-beaked bird as a symbol of unchastity (ibid., p. 70, note 51; pp. 102, I73). The second King's helmet also shows herons, and demons and monkeys playing with them. For the ape in combination with large, long-necked fowl, cf. Janson, op.cit., p. 120. 53. See the article by P. P. Levertoff and H. L. Goudge, in A New Commentary on Holy Scripture, New York, 1928, pp. I32f. 54. The unbelieving Jews are actually represented in some paintings of the Adoration of the Magi. Cf., for instance, the copy of Hugo van der Goes in the collection of Don Juan de Valencia, Madrid (Friedlinder, Die altniederliindische Malerei, Iv, pl. xxxii); the painting by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, in the National Gallery, London (no. 3556); and a composition with many figures by a follower of Botticelli in the Uffizi, Florence (Alinari no. 6o6a). 55. For the allegorical interpretations of the Adoration of the Magi, cf. the article "Drei K6nige," in Michael Buch- berger, Lexikon fiir Theologie und Kirche, III, Freiburg, 1931, p. 452. The interpretation of the three Kings signifying the three continents occurs in Bede (Migne, xc-xcv).</page><page sequence="22">280 THE ART BULLETIN century show this incident of the childhood of Christ and not the Crucifixion as the main representa- tion of the central panel. The same book, however, which emphasizes that Christ is the King of Kings indicates in various passages that the Kings of the earth are seduced and ruled by evil. In Revelation 16:14, 17:18, and 18:3, for instance, this is stated quite clearly. This coincides with the prevailing trait of the legend of the Antichrist, which makes him the seducer and the leader of the Kings of the world."6 In mediaeval book illustrations the Antichrist is frequently represented as the seducer of the Kings. While in the fifteenth century block-books he appears with only one King at a time, he is depicted with two Kings in one of the miniatures of the Hortus Deliciarum (Fig. 15). It is quite obvious that Bosch has combined the two ideas, and that he represents the same three Kings who are worshiping Christ as the three Kings who are under the influence of the Antichrist, and who will be seduced and led to perdition by the impostor. Although this surprising and daringly direct connection of ideas is unique in Christian tradition, and only possible in the gruesomely pessimistic philosophy behind the art of this late mediaeval painter, the thought seems to have already been potentially in existence. In the Sacramentarium"' Honorius of Autun compares Nebuchadnezzar with the Antichrist, and he states on this occasion that in his time the Antichrist will cast the sons of Noah into the furnace of tribulation. When Honorius explains that the three sons of Noah signify entire mankind from all three parts of the world, Asia, Africa, and Europe, this reads precisely like an exposition of the Epiphany. I do not think, however, that the idea of the connection between the three worshipers of the infant Christ and the three Kings led to perdition by the Antichrist has ever been actually expressed in literature. By placing the three Kings in this manner between good and evil, Bosch makes them a symbol of the world existing between the divine and the infernal powers. This, I think, is the essence of the painting; through it all other features of the altarpiece can be explained. That the act of the Adoration is performed in a way which is very similar to the celebration of the Mass, an observation on which Tolnay has based his entire interpretation, is unquestionably correct. Abraham's Sacrifice, on the golden gift, prefiguring the Sacrifice of Christ, points very distinctly in this direction. The Catholic Mass is a continuous actual renewal of this Holy Sacrifice through which mankind has been redeemed. The thought is, however, not nearly so predominant in the context of the picture as Tolnay and, following him, all recent interpreters assume. It is only one of the many and various ideas of the altarpiece, and the far-reaching conclusions which Tolnay has drawn from his observation have proved to be untenable."5 It is true that the Kings are worshiping Christ as though they were celebrating Mass. The Redemption, however, accomplished through the Sacrifice of Christ, which is celebrated and repeated in this liturgical act, is only a possibility given to mankind. It is no guarantee for the actual salvation of men, since, according to Bosch, the evil powers are lying in wait in the background, alert and very efficient. Much in contrast to earlier fifteenth century representations of the Adoration of the Magi, which show a triumphal celebration of Christ's mastery over the world, Bosch's composition has this deeply equivocal character. The Kings are placed between the divine and the infernal powers. True, they worship Christ, not the Antichrist; and, having overcome the powerful temptation, are represented as efficient helpers against evil, as the Church has always seen them. Yet Bosch took great care to show the dangers of temptation in extensive details, thus giving a distinct predominance to the infernal powers in his painting. Although Christian ideology offers a vast selection of elements for enriching 56. Cf. above, p. 272 and note 24. 57. See above, note 34. 58. Charles de Tolnay, op.cit., p. 44. From his interpreta- tion of the Adoration as representing the Holy Mass, a cele- bration which will be repeated again and again in the future, Tolnay concludes that the second link of this chain of con- tinued adoration is represented in the group of the persons inside the hut (see note 2). That Tolnay's study on Bosch, which is basically correct and indispensable, has to be revised in some of its details does not affect its fundamental value.</page><page sequence="23">THE PRADO EPIPHANY BY JEROME BOSCH 281 the representation of divinity, such as angels, virtues, and saints, the divine is represented here only in the figure of the Madonna with the Child. Bosch has depicted her in hieratic attitude and in an overlarge size, and it is interesting to observe how the copyist who painted the replica in the Johnson Collection has changed the height of the figure several times in order to bring it down to more naturalistic proportions.5 Yet the space the Madonna fills is small compared to the area taken up by the overwhelming multitude of the demonic crowd, and although Bosch has emphasized her importance in size and attitude, her appearance is not interesting or striking at all. She is not the magnificently adorned heavenly Queen, but a humble mother with a tiny, helpless child. Divinity is rare, simple, and reserved, while evil is manifold, spectacular, and aggressive."o It is hard to find and go the right way, and very easy to be attracted by evil, which is waiting for men everywhere and in various shapes and guises. The preponderance of evil becomes clearly evident as we look at Bosch's altarpiece in its entirety. Evil plays an important part in the world-landscape which appears in the upper section of the central composition, and which is continued on both wings in such a way that it forms the background for the representations of all three panels. This is not only the world before the Redemption; it is the godless world, as it was, is, and always will be, a symbol of the world in all its worldliness-of the world in which evil is active. In the background of the left wing the brighter and more agreeable aspects of everyday life are portrayed. The donor with St. Peter, his patron saint, and with his coat-of-arms is represented in the foreground, kneeling, in adoration, and in seemly distance from the central scene from which he is separated by the vertical parts of the altar frame.61 In the middle section of the same wing, St. Joseph appears as a very small figure (Fig. 18), and as though he were a part of the brighter side of common life. In Bosch's representation he had to move out of the hut and the central panel, since the stable is inhabited by the demonic gang. The Antichrist and his companions have set up their quarters here with a lighted fire and a soup bowl and spoon ready near the stove. Thus Joseph is sitting in a corner of another ruined building represented on the wing, most likely the manor house to which the hut of the middle panel originally belonged as the stable." The portal of the ruin is decorated by a frog, demons, and a statue, all diabolic symbols. Joseph is sitting on an over- turned basket and is drying the swaddling clothes of the Child at a fire. The scene takes place under a provisional roof which is a later affixture to the ruined wall, but already also decaying. A peculiar feature of this representation is that the smoke vent of the former upper story of the destroyed mansion appears right over the provisional roof under which the fire is burning. It is jutting up into the open uselessly, since the ruin is open anyway. This may be more than just a witty, ironic detail, and the smoke vent may have a meaning in the specific context of the whole. Considering the role the smoke vent plays in superstition throughout the centuries as the passage by which demons and witches make their entrance into the house and find their way 59. John G. Johnson Collection, Catalogue of Paintings, Philadelphia, 1941, p. 21, no. 354- 6o. As Friedlinder (op.cit., p. 1 2) puts it: "Es gab nur eine Tugend aber viele Siinden, nur einen Gott, aber viele Teufel. Und die durch die Tradition belastete Vorstellung von Himmel, von der Gottheit, von den Heiligen wurde mit scheuer Behutsamkeit und geringem Anteil verbildlicht, wahrend die Vielheit der Begierden, die Fiille der Strafen im Innern der H6lle Visionen von unendlichem Reichtum anregte." 61. The coat-of-arms appearing underneath the motto: "Een voer al" belongs to the Bronckhorst family. 62. Whereas in the Middle Ages the building near the stable was thought of as the palace of King David as well as the house of his son Solomon, this manor house in Bosch's representation is probably the ruined palace of King Solomon (I Kings 7 and Io). Dr. Panofsky has drawn my attention to the direct reference to the Palace of David in Bethlehem found in the Portinari altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes, where the tympanum of the building shows his coat-of-arms, the harp. Lehrs (op.cit., VI, p. 92) mentions the legendary belief that the Adoration was thought to have taken place in the ruins of Solomon's house. The thought obviously derived from the visit of the Queen of Sheba in Solomon's house pre- figuring the Adoration of the Magi. In the belief of the Christian Middle Ages, Solomon was the great sorcerer, the king of all magicians and fortunetellers, the master over all spirits and demons. Cf. the article, "Salomo," in M. Buch- berger, op.cit., Ix, pp. 128f. Thus Bosch has probably repre- sented in the manor house the decaying magician-palace of the old Jewish king.</page><page sequence="24">282 THE ART BULLETIN out again,6 it becomes clear that this smoke vent belongs to the satanic realm and stands in close connection to the frog- and demon-decoration on the portal of the ruined mansion. The engraving of Brueghel, St. James and the Magician Hermogenes, shows a similar fireplace serving as a passage for witches.64 Just as the Madonna on the central panel is placed against a background of satanic contrivances, Joseph also appears sitting in front of a ruined building furnished with demonic emblems. Looking at the specific arrangement of entrance, roof, and the place the sitting figure occupies, the parallelism becomes very obvious. As Meyer Schapiro expressed it, Joseph was for the religious fantasy of the later Middle Ages one of the main figures in the divine plot to deceive the devil."65 Thus Bosch gives him a place within his immediate surroundings similar to the one occupied by the Virgin Mother in the central panel. But, in contrast to the Madonna, Joseph as a husband and artisan belongs to the world. In the cult of the saint which was spreading in the early fifteenth century, his familial virtues, his domestic and bourgeois qualities are celebrated. Thus Bosch, who represents him as the fosterer and provider," with the hatchet, the characteristic tool of his craft, right next to him, does not render him within the context of the central panel, but places him as a very small figure on one of the wings, as part of the world. According to the place Bosch gives him in the painting, he belongs to the more private and personal world represented as the background for the human figures of the donors, and not to the large public world rendered at the top of the central panel, where, as we will see later, the great universal, historic events take place. Above this representation of Joseph in the ruined mansion, peasants are dancing in the landscape of the background (Fig. 16). This is a delightful picture of human amusement and obviously is meant as a contrast to the horrors of the corresponding representation of the other wing. However, as so many elements in Bosch's art have more than one aspect, the dance of the peasants is also a picture of human folly and the unwise behavior of the lost soul. When we recall that in one of the engravings after Pieter Brueghel's compositions the Foolish Virgins are depicted as dancing peasant girls (Fig. 19),67 we realize what Bosch wanted to express. The dancing peasants, wasting their time in shallow diversions, are dancing to perdition like the Foolish Virgins of the parable."68 The two peacefully grazing unbridled horses69 and the couple just about to enter a dark hidden footpath are representations of the same idea: the world, thoughtlessly entangled in sin, neglects its salvation. In the right wing, forming a barrier which separates the donatrix7? and her patron saint from the background, two rocks are depicted closing the sides and leaving an opening in the center, forming the entrance to the scene in the rear. At the right of this entrance, as well as by the rock at the left, dead and dry trees are rendered. These are symbols of devastation, preparing the spectator for the gruesome view of danger, death, and destruction which opens behind the rocks, where wolves are attacking a man and chasing a woman (Fig. 17). This is a picture of the darker side of human life in the world. The location is characterized as a place of execution, but the wheel on top of the 63.

This article contains a brief but most enlightening passage on Bosch (p. I87); on Joseph, cf. p. 184, notes 17 and i8. 66. Although in earlier representations Joseph is usually depicted as cooking a soup, he is also sometimes represented drying the diapers at a fire. Compare the early fifteenth century panel of the Nativity in the John G. Johnson Collection, Philadelphia, no. 756. That this feature occurs in the context of the Adoration of the Magi might have something to do with an old legend, according to which the Magi brought back one of Jesus' swaddling clothes which was proof against fire and was preserved with veneration. Cf. James, op.cit., p. 80. 67. Bastelaer, op.cit., no. 123: La parabole des vi'rges sages et des vitrges folles. 68. Both Brueghel's Foolish Virgins and Bosch's peasants are dancing to the music of a bagpipe. For the bagpipe as a diabolic symbol, cf. Bax, op.cit., p. I9. 69. Probably a symbol of the unbridled senses. The horses, already occurring in the Old Testament as the animals of un- restrained lust (Ezekiel 23:20o), have become an erotic symbol, a meaning which is still obvious in Baldung's woodcuts of the horses (Curjel, 8i, 82, 83). Cf. Panofsky, Albrecht Diirer, I, p. 88. 70. Her coat-of-arms belongs to the Bosshuyse family.</page><page sequence="25">THE PRADO EPIPHANY BY JEROME BOSCH 283 hill is already broken down and half-destroyed. It is a place of execution in a deserted region that is not in use any more, thus being doubly a picture of destruction. The scene by the wasteland road is taken from the same Biblical context which has provided some of the ideas for the central composition, the parable of the Good and the Bad Shepherd. Depicting the results of the criminal negligence of the Bad Shepherd, the representation does not show really one scene, but rather two successive incidents. The picture is an exact and literal illustration of the end of verse 12 in the tenth chapter of the Johannine Gospel. Only one wolf is intended, but he appears twice in the picture, since according to the text he is doing two different things. He catches the poor deserted sheep, and he scatters them. The first part of the sentence is illustrated in front where the wolf attacks the man; the second part, farther back, where the wolf is chasing the woman.7 It is interesting to observe what care the painter took to separate these scenes and the landscape in which they are placed from the two figures in the foreground. The barriers described above are very far away in space from the donatrix and her saint. Thus they appear above the two figures and are not anywhere overlapped by them. Right in front of the left barrier a little lamb is represented lying underneath the dead and broken trees, very much alone and far away from any other figure of the composition. Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly the attribute of the patron saint, who is thus characterized as St. Agnes. However, the lonely lamb obviously has also another meaning. Although in Christian iconography the lamb is generally a symbol of the Saviour, I do not believe that this interpretation would be correct here. Considering the nature of the context in which it occurs, it must rather have a relation to the Bad Shepherd, and is the lamb that went astray and is deserted and lost. Not only in the famous parable of the lost sheep in Luke 15 is the animal that went astray a symbol for the human soul in danger; this comparison is quite usual in the books of the Old and New Testament, and occurs, for instance, in I Kings 20:17, Psalm I19:176, Isaiah 53:6, Ezekiel 34:5, Matthew 9:36, 1o:6, 15:24, Mark 6:34, and I Peter 2:25. In all these passages, the human soul is compared to the lost sheep deserted by the shepherd. Thus, in my opinion, the lonely lamb in Bosch's composition is a symbol for the deserted soul, and the shepherd's shovel lying in front of the lamb probably depicts the instrument thrown away by the fleeing hireling. This would mean that Bosch expressed the same idea in two different ways: once in the lamb flanking the entrance to the scene in the background, and the other time in the scene itself. The lamb obviously also has a third meaning. Being the attribute of the patron saint and being represented not over the Saint's head but above the donatrix who bore the Saint's name, it is indubitably also an emblem of the donatrix. In this symbol the actual or desired virtues of this female human worshiper are embodied-patience, gentleness, and tenderness, the very qualities which are so important when the symbol stands for an image of Christ. According to the place the lamb occupies within the entirety of the altarpiece, it is the exact counterpart to the small figure of St. Joseph on the left wing. This unquestionably has a very definite meaning. While the lamb embodies the ideal female virtues, the figure of Joseph is an image of male perfection. As the picture of the perfect husband and provider, the figure of St. Joseph appearing above the kneeling donor and looking at him is evidently meant as an emblem of the donor. Both representations, however, besides being male and female emblems, signifying ideal human qualities, are, as was shown above, also part of the hostile, devilish world. Thus they belong to the scenes still farther in the background, the dance of the peasants and the wolf attacking the couple. What is shown here, however, is not only the evil world, but the evil world in a very specific sense. The scenes have a close connection with the main representation of the central panel. They depict the result of the Antichrist's activities in the world, showing man as a victim of the wicked. Not only the perils of the couple attacked by the wolf are caused by the cowardly negligence of the impostor; 71. Tolnay (op.cit., p. 44) assumes that Bosch represented in this scene a bear and a wolf. This is an error. It is un- questionably the same animal which is shown in both parts of the scene.</page><page sequence="26">284 THE ART BULLETIN to the Antichrist is also due the foolish behavior of the peasants. Considering the apparently close connection between this representation and the parable of the Foolish Virgins, it becomes evident that it is the Antichrist who is the peasants' seducer. It seems that in the belief of the Middle Ages the seducer of the Foolish Virgins is not the devil himself, but the still more anthropomorphic opponent of the Lord. Looking at the figure of the seducer of the Foolish Virgins in late thirteenth century portals, as it appears in Strasbourg (Fig. 14), Freiburg, and Basle,72 the statue is obviously not a portrait of Satan. It has an elegant, princely appearance, and shows neither horns, nor a tail, nor any of the usual features of the devil. In art history this statue is always called simply: "The seducer" or "The prince of this world." However, judging from its resemblance to the Antichrist figure of the Hortus Deliciarum (Fig. 6), this statue is apparently a portrait of the Antichrist. This is exactly what might be expected, considering the close connection of the Antichrist and the Last Judgment on the one hand, and the Last Judgment and the Wise and Foolish Virgins on the other. In the central panel of the altarpiece, the corresponding section of the background (Fig. 2o) is gradually transformed into a landscape of yellow dunes, though level land still appears in front, with an inn at the left and a watercourse with a bridge at the right. The inn (Fig. 8) with its sign of the white swan is, as already mentioned by Tolnay, an evil place." It is suitable for clandestine meetings, thus indicating the world's sin and corruption. The couple standing arm in arm are watched by a man who is slyly peering around the corner of the plateau in front of the inn. The bridge (Fig. 9) indubitably has an evil meaning also. As places under which demons and witches are believed to dwell, bridges have always played an important part in superstition."1 Besides, Bosch has characterized this bridge as a ruin, an unsafe, decaying structure which has not been used for such a long time that the shrubbery at the left has already grown together. Thus it is avoided by the horsemen at the right, who prefer to make their way through the water rather than to cross the bridge. The man who is standing behind the tree in front of the structure and whose pennant is leaning against it is probably a scout, sent out to explore the territory. The treacherous bridge is most likely a symbol for the untrustworthy world."7 Between the bridge and the inn, right in the center of the landscape (Fig. I), a mountebank holding the bridle of a mule that carries an ape is traveling across the country. The entertainer with the monkey and mule is part of the traditional train of the Magi. He appears, for instance, in the fragment of the Adoration of the Magi by Sassetta.76 In Bosch's painting the charlatan with the monkey and mule, detached from the tradi- tional context, must be a symbol of folly and sin, as are all the other scenes of shallow diversion. In the rear of this representation, in the midst of the dunes, a heathen idol is depicted, standing on a column and topped by a crescent, an outspoken sign of ungodliness, a towering landmark charac- terizing the entire area (Figs. I, 9)- The chief action taking place in this region of the middle panel is the encounter of three hordes of warriors. One horde is in the center, far back near the city; two others, closer to the front of the landscape (Figs. 8, 9), are represented at the extreme sides and are even overlapped by the panel frame. These three armies are, in my opinion, not simply hordes of warriors signifying the evil in a godless world, as is assumed by Tolnay77 and, in agreement with him, by all other recent interpreters. These are unquestionably the armies of the three Kings. This representation was 72.

However, this encounter cannot portray the joyous meeting of the three Magi before the act of the Adoration. It is hostile, and in this I agree with Tolnay." This part of the painting can be interpreted only with the general context of the entire altar- piece in mind. The altarpiece represents the powers of evil in the complex composition of the hut in the center panel, whereas in the background, as interpreted so far, the results of their activities in the world are depicted. Considering that the two prevailing scenes in the background of the wings show the effects of the work of Antichrist, it seems very probable that the same is represented in the background of the center panel. While the side scenes appearing over the donors' portraits depict the results of Antichrist's actions so far as average mankind is concerned, it seems very likely that the corresponding scene of the middle panel, appearing above the Adoration, shows the three Kings as the victims of the Antichrist. If this is really the case, the scene with the three warrior hordes represents the results of the Antichrist's seduction of the rulers of the world. The nature of these results is not very clear in the Antichrist legend. It is quite obvious, how- ever, in the book of the New Testament which has already proved to be of great importance as a source for Bosch's painting. In Revelation 16:14, 19:19, and 20:8 it is recounted, in varying terms, that the Kings of the world, seduced by the messengers of the wicked, will gather together for the final battle at the end of time. This battle, as is expressly told in Revelation 20:8, is the war of Gog and Magog. In the legend of the Antichrist these legendary nations also make an appear- ance.so There, however, they are not precisely identified with the three Kings, but are only men- tioned as joining them in the great exodus of all nations of the world. There can hardly be any doubt that the representation in the background of the center panel is the gathering for the final war, the terrible battle which will be instigated by the Antichrist and fought by the three Kings of the earth. Revelation 20:8 indicates that the nations will be gathered together from the four quarters of the earth. A feature of Bosch's representations that has a possible connection with this description is the little windmill appearing above the dunes, right in the center of the middle panel (Fig. 20). Standing at such a marked spot of the composition, it looks almost like a signpost point- ing to the four quarters of the earth. The bare, yellowish mountains, on the other hand, are probably a feature taken from an Old Testament description of the war of Gog and Magog. Ac- cording to Ezekiel 38:8, this battle is to be fought in "the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste." Representing the three armies of the Kings as gathering for the final war, Bosch again resorts to his characteristic method, which was employed in the representation of the shepherds in the central panel. He takes a traditional feature of the Adoration scene, transforms it for his own purpose, and thus turns its meaning into its very opposite. As already mentioned in the case of the shepherds, the nal've worshiper has probably always taken this part of the painting for a familiar representation. He most likely took the armies for a picture of the traditional meeting of the Kings' trains before the Adoration. This, I think, was exactly what Bosch intended. 78. Ms lat. 17.294, Nativity, fol. 56v. In this representa- tion it is a cross and not a heathen symbol that characterizes the territory in which the meeting of the three Kings takes place. 79. There actually are representations which show the retinues of the Magi preparing for a fight at their unexpected meeting before the Adoration. The late fourteenth century Epiphany on the left shutter of the "Small Bargello Diptych" (Grete Ring, A Century of French Painting, 4 00-1500, Lon- don, 1949, fig. 16) shows one of the horsemen brandishing his sword. I cannot, however, find any sign of a battle in the other example mentioned by Joseph Schaefer (Les primitifs frangais du XIVe et du XVe siecle, Paris, 1949), the Adoration of the Magi by Bartolo di Fredi, illustrated in R. Van Marle, The Development of the Italian Schools of Painting, II, The Hague, 1924, p. 491, fig. 318. This probably is an error. Compare the battle in the background of Leonardo's Epiphany, Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi, and the miniature from the Hours of Etienne Chevalier by Jean Fouquet (Ring, op.cit., fig. 70). I am indebted to Dr. Panofsky for drawing my atten- tion to the passage in the book by J. Schaefer. 8o. See above, note 25. Cf. also the text of the late fifteenth century German block-books (note 19).</page><page sequence="28">286 THE ART BULLETIN Within this traditional context, the town at the top of the middle panel (Fig. 20) would have been taken for the historic town of Jerusalem, the original destination of the Magi. That Bosch actually meant to portray this Biblical city and not the town of Bethlehem can, in my opinion, be safely assumed. There is more than one reason for this supposition. On the one hand, the city is characterized as very important and is filled with religious monuments. On the other, it has, within the non-historical and purely symbolical context of Bosch's conception, a very special significance. This symbolical conception has a prophetic character; it embodies events which are to happen in the future. According to the Apocalypse, the present world of evil will fall after the last terrible war. A new heaven and a new earth will appear. This is the glorious beginning of the new messianic era. The apocalyptic symbol for this new era is, as expressed in Revelation 21:2 and Io, the New Jerusalem, the heavenly city, adorned like a bride for her husband. If the present interpretation of Bosch's altarpiece is correct in its general idea, then there can hardly be any doubt that this is the city which Bosch meant to portray at the top of the central panel. Whereas the "waste moun- tains of Israel" are characterized as the old evil world by the idol with the crescent, the entrance to the heavenly city, situated at the left front tower, is marked by a cross at the road. Although this detail is very small and difficult to recognize, it is, except for Abraham's Sacrifice represented in the gift of the King, the only symbol pointing to the Crucifixion, the completion of the work of Redemption. The representations at the top of the wings possibly still belong to the old evil world. The buildings in the far background of the left wing, being of more rustic character, prob- ably mark the hamlet of Bethlehem, but in addition they may have a symbolic meaning (Fig. 16). As for the right panel, the symbolical character of the city on the island (Fig. 17) is very obvious, but the nature of the symbolism still seems problematic. The light-colored fairy-tale town, how- ever, at the top of the middle panel, appearing right under the glorious star of the Saviour, is definitely a celestial emblem; it is the heavenly Jerusalem, city of divine promise and symbol of the triumphant Church. II On the other side of the altarpiece, when the triptych is closed, the representation is again one large scene, the Mass of St. Gregory, in grisaille (Fig. 21). The composition consists of two dis- tinctly separated parts, one below showing the persons celebrating the Mass, the other at the top representing the vision of the Saint. In the lower section (Figs. 24, 25), St. Gregory is depicted kneeling in front of an altar which, in strict frontality, is placed in the center of the space without any indication of an architectural setting. The other persons rendered in the foreground are a deacon and two donors. In the rear two groups are represented behind the curtains of the altar: at the right side, the followers of St. Gregory, carrying his tiara and crosier; at the left are the followers of the donor. This donor (at the left) is unquestionably a different person from the man portrayed by Bosch in the Adoration of the Magi. He does not appear with his wife as does the donor of the Epiphany, but with his young son (at the right). The dry and dispassionate atmosphere is a most remarkable feature of this scene. In front of the large bare form of the completely unadorned altar the four single figures in the otherwise empty foreground look isolated, stern, and unmoved. Not one of them shows any sign of the emotion which would be expected of persons witnessing the miracle of the Host turned into the real body of the suffering Christ.8' Upon analysis of the upper portion of the composition, the 8 1. The legend, which cannot be found in earlier sources, was probably not developed before the fifteenth century. Cf.

The legend originated from the</page><page sequence="29">THE PRADO EPIPHANY BY JEROME BOSCH 287 reason for this aridity becomes apparent. Here the representation is not a miracle to evoke ecstatic emotions, but a moral lesson in the guise of a religious vision. In this upper section (Figs. 22, 23, 26) Bosch has rendered this miracle, traditionally indicated by depicting the Man of Sorrows and only the instruments of the Passion,82 as a gigantic vision of the real story of the Passion in a series of scenes. This representation occurs on a border around a large round-arched surface which appears to be an altarpiece. In front of this altarpiece, adorned by nine angels, the Man of Sorrows emerges from his sarcophagus on the altar.83 The particular type of the reanimated body of the dead Christ as Bosch depicts it here is unusual in this context. While in all earlier and contemporary representations of the Mass of St. Gregory the Man of Sorrows appears as a figure in active motion, showing his wounds or even stepping forward toward the Saint,"8 Bosch has represented the Man of Sorrows in the so-called Gregorian type,"8 with his head bent and his hands crossed in front of his body, utterly sad, motionless, and completely passive. The border with the Passion scenes appearing around this figure is a curious formation with a kind of outgrowth at the top (Fig. 26). The first four scenes of the Passion, two at the left and two at the right of this altarpiece within an altarpiece, look almost like representations on the wings. Higher up, however, the little figures in the scenes are no longer rendered as though ex- isting within the boundaries of a frame. They have come to life and emerge into the open space. Thus the representation has actually adopted the character of a vision. Contemplating the curious formation of the border as a whole, with its strange outgrowth at the top, it becomes quite apparent that the entire structure is meant as a mountain. The Passion scenes depicted on this mountain start with the Agony in the Garden at the lower left (Fig. 22). The story proceeds from here in serpentine lines upwards, alternating from left to right until, at the upper right scene, the Carrying of the Cross, the figures actually begin to climb up the hill. They climb up, again in a serpentine line, to the top of the mountain, where the Passion ends with the Crucifixion on the Mount of Calvary. In this scene of the Crucifixion (Fig. 26) we find the key for the understanding of the under- lying meaning of the entire composition painted on the back of Bosch's altarpiece of the Epiphany. The Crucifix is represented surrounded by St. John and the Holy Women. At the left side of this scene, farther down the hill, the cross of the repentant thief appears. Bosch has not represented him as crucified, but as standing on a ladder still waiting for his execution. Looking at the other side, where the cross with the unrepentant malefactor should be expected, no representation of this pictorial tradition and chiefly remained one. In this tradition, the miracle is not always clearly defined as an actual transub- stantiation. Most representations show both the wafer and the body of Christ, thus indicating that the latter is merely meant as a miraculous apparition confirming the transubstantiation. I am greatly indebted to Mr. Earl Rosenthal for letting me use his personal notes on the subject. 82. Cf., for instance, the copy of a painting by the Master of Fl6malle (Friedlinder, op.cit., II, pl. lxii) ; the small panel by a follower of Memling, New York, Metropolitan Museum, z21.34.3B; and the painting ascribed to Bernt Notke in Liibeck, Burger, Schmitz, Beth, Die deutsche Malerei yeom ausgehenden Mittelalter bis zum Ende der Renaissance, Handb. d. Kzw., Berlin, 1917, fig. 571, p. 470. The instruments of the Passion, or "Arma Christi," were kept and worshiped in the Church of S. Croce of Jerusalem in Rome, where the miracle was thought to have been witnessed by St. Gregory. 83. The doctrine of the nine angelic hierarchies, in Diony- sius the Pseudo-Areopagite, Caelestis hierarchia, vI, 2 (Migne, III, zooD), was propagated by St. Gregory. In connection with this doctrine, the Spanish liturgy prescribes for every Mass that the Host be divided into nine sections. Cf. Konrad Burdach, Der Gral, Stuttgart, 1938, pp. zo4f. 84. Cf., for instance, the examples given in note 82, another one reproduced in Kiinstle (op.cit., I, p. 493), and the Utrecht altarpiece (G. J. Hoogewerff, De Noord-Nederlandsche Schilderkunst, I, The Hague, 1936, fig. 322, p. 568). For an example contrasting particularly with Bosch's representation in the lively motion of the Christ figure, cf. the altarpiece ascribed to the Burgundian School in the Wadsworth Athe- naeum, Hartford, Conn. 85. Cf. Gabriel Millet, Recherches sur l'iconographie de l'Evangile, Paris, 1916, pp. 483ff.; Emile Male, L'art religieux de la fin du moyen dge en France, 4th ed., Paris, 1931, PP. 98ff.; Erwin Panofsky, "Imago Pietatis," in Fest- schrift ffir M. J. Friedlinder, Leipzig, 1927, p. 261. The so-called Gregorian type of the Man of Sorrows, thought to have been the basis for the development of the legend, was, strangely enough, rather neglected in representations of the Mass of St. Gregory. See Gert von der Osten, op.cit., p. 29. Except for the altarpiece by Enguerrand Charonton in Ville- neuve-ls-Avignon (Ring, op.cit., fig. 67), hardly any exam- ples can be named before the sixteenth century.</page><page sequence="30">288 THE ART BULLETIN kind can be found, and only the trunk of a broken tree appears instead."8 The cross of the un- repentant thief has not yet been erected; it is being carried up by two underlings, a scene represented at the part of the hill under the Cross of Christ. The malefactor himself is led up by a soldier, with hands bound, looking back to the Cross-carrying Christ. Though the traditional counterpart of the unrepentant thief is lacking, in actuality there is a counterpart representation next to the tree stump, slightly farther down the hill. This is Judas, who has hung himself from a tree and whose soul is being carried away on a pole by a flying devil surrounded by large diabolic birds."' That the painter does not render the cross of the unrepentant thief at its traditional place but depicts the hanging Judas instead is unique in Christian iconography and deeply significant for the context of Bosch's composition. The hanging Judas is, in a way, similar to the Antichrist figure of the scene of the Adoration, the key figure for the understanding of the entire representation. In the belief of the Middle Ages, Judas has become the villain kat exochen. The legend ascribes to the traitor of Christ every possible crime, and his suicide, especially, mentioned in the New Testament, makes him appear as the worst of all evildoers. According to Augustine, the suicide of Judas, expressing his loss of hope in Divine Grace, adds to his guilt instead of expiating it, and the manner of his death is the deepest reason for the general belief that his soul is doomed to eternal punishment." Thus, Judas, and especially the hanging Judas, came to be thought of as an image of evil comparable to the figure of the Antichrist. In actual fact, Judas was compared to the Anti- christ, and early descriptions of the personal appearance of the two are sometimes identical." Moreover, both figures were regarded as the evil Jew, and in later representations Judas frequently appears with prominent Jewish features. In Bosch's composition the hanging Judas is coupled with the figure of the devil, while, at the opposite side, next to the cross of the repentant thief, the clouded sky opens to send forth an angel floating in a ray of light. Judas and the devil appear at the right side, which, viewed from the Crucifix, really is the left and thus the evil side. It is the side on which in allegorical representa- tions of the Crucifixion the figure of the defeated Synagogue occurs. The hanging Judas of Bosch's painting thus can stand for the Synagogue. We can already find the figure of Judas as a counter- part to Ecclesia in earlier art. In miniatures of French fourteenth century breviaries the hanging Judas appears as an image of Despair."o He is juxtaposed to a female figure symbolizing Hope in Divine Grace. This figure is distinctly characterized as Ecclesia, making it quite apparent that the hanging Judas is meant as a symbol of the Synagogue. The hanging Judas in Bosch's composi- tion, just as the Antichrist figure in the Adoration of the Magi, is undoubtedly also a symbol of all evil. 86. It is not quite clear from Bosch's representation whether a tree stump is meant or a broken cross from a previous cruci- fixion. For the latter, cf. the so-called "Triptyque de Loches," School of Fouquet (Ring, op.cit., fig. 95). For the negative meaning of the tree stump, see Frederick Hartt, "Lignum vitae in medio paradisi: The Stanza d'Eliodoro and the Sistine Ceiling," ART BULLETIN, XXXII, 1950, pp. 130, 138ff., and Panofsky, Albrecht Diirer, II, no. 213. 87. For the iconography of the hanging Judas, cf. Oswald Goetz, "Hie hencktt Judas," in Form und Inhalt, Festschrift fiir Otto Schmidt, Stuttgart, 1951, pp. 105-137. The diabolic birds already occur at an early stage of the development of the subject. In the so-called Prayerbook of St. Hildegard of Bingen (Munich, Staatsbibliothek, Clm. 935), a miniature painted in the last quarter of the twelfth century shows the hanging Judas surrounded by large hovering birds. He is not yet represented with the devil carrying away his soul (Goetz, op.cit., fig. 8, p. I 5). Goetz calls the diabolic birds "the envoys of hell" (ibid., p. i 6). It is obvious that this representation is in strict accordance with a specific feature of the legend, which was also taken over and used in the text of the Legenda Aurea; "Judas ought not to die on the earth because all earthly creatures ought to hate him, but in the air where wicked spirits be, because he had deserved to be in their company." (The legend of Judas is recounted in the chapter on the Apostle Matthias, ed. Th. Graesse, Leipzig, 1850, pp. 183ff.) 88. Augustinus, De civitate dei, I, 17, ed. Dombart, Leipzig, in Aedibus B. G.

Goetz, op.cit., pp. 133f.</page><page sequence="31">THE PRADO EPIPHANY BY JEROME BOSCH 289 In the particular place in the Crucifixion which is the traditional place for the symbol of evil, Bosch needed a figure of much greater significance than the unrepentant thief. He needed a figure which could be charged with responsibility for the evil deeds carried out in the course of the Passion. This, according to the Gospels, could only be Judas the traitor. Bosch, indeed, has represented the entire Passion not only as the outcome of Judas' treason, but as the result of evil as such, for which Judas stands as a symbol. Looking at the individual representations in St. Gregory's vision, we find that each of these scenes of the Passion of Christ is rendered with the idea that what is taking place is the result of human vice. In the Gethsemane scene (Fig. 22) the sleeping St. Peter with his sword lying idly at his side is a picture of Sloth, while in the following scene, the Arrest of Christ (Fig. 23), the same St. Peter, uselessly and furiously attacking with his sword, is a picture of Anger. In fact, Bosch probably meant to represent in these scenes of the Passion the Seven Deadly Sins. Besides the Crucifixion, there are seven individual scenes. It is noteworthy that in some of them accessory details and figures are rendered, the connection of which with the main action is not at once ap- parent. The sitting man with the monkey, for instance, at the Flagellation, and the two men with the dog relieving himself at the Croz&amp;ing with Thorns have no relation to the Biblical story. They are, however, very important in the context of the Deadly Sins. Since the actions of some of the small figures, as well as the tiny representations in the many niches, are not recognizable today (even on the original), the following identifications should be taken as suggestions only. The Agony in the Garden, as indicated by the sleeping Apostles, represents Acedia.~" The Arrest of Christ, by St. Peter's brandishing his sword and by the other attackers, is characterized as Ira. In the scene of Christ Before Pilate, Pilate, his peeping wife wearing a very fashionable head- dress, may represent Superbia."2 The obviously delighted onlooker with the monkey at the Flagella- tion is apparently a picture of Luxuria." The fat men accompanied by the misbehaving dog (per- haps in connection with the unidentified representation in the niche) probably stand for Gula.94 The unrepentant thief turning to scowl at Christ, at the Carrying of the Cross, probably indicates that the scene is meant as Invidia," and a picture of A varitia is obviously intended in the unusual representation in the Undressing of Christ, where the soldiers do not throw dice but actually battle for the garments." 9I. The vice of Acedia is always represented by a sleeping person. Compare Jerome Bosch's painting of the Seven Deadly Sins on a table-board (Madrid, Prado; Baldass, op.cit., fig. 13). See Erwin Panofsky, "Zwei Diirerprobleme," Miinchner Jahrb. d. bild. Kunst, N.F. viii, 1931, pp. iff., for some discussion of the sleep of Acedia. On the choir stalls of 1435 in the Cathedral of St. John in 's-Hertogenbosch, which have a cycle of the Seven Sins (most of them symbolic animals), Sloth is represented by a scene of the Agony in the Garden. See De Kathedrale Basiliek van St. Jan te 's-Hertogenbosch, 's-Hertogenbosch, 1949, P. 44, fig. a. Thus Bosch took this idea from the tradition of his city. (For drawing my attention to this, during a recent visit to 's-Hertogenbosch, I am most grateful to Mr. Frans van Valderen.) 92. Compare the representations of Ira and Superbia on the table-board (Baldass, op.cit., figs. 12, 13). 93. Compare the very prominent part a flagellation plays in Brueghel's Luxuria (Bastelaer, op.cit., no. I3Ii drawing, in Karl von Tolnai, Die Zeichnungen Pieter Bruegels, Munich, 1925, no. 33. 94. In the Hay Wain Bosch has also represented a dog as an emblem for Gula. Baldass, op.cit., fig. 36. Cf. Bax, op.cit., p. 37, note 40. 95. This scene is obviously meant as the railing at Christ by the unrepentant malefactor, as told in Luke 23:39. According to the Gospel, the incident occurs after the Crucifixion has taken place. In his endeavor, however, to connect each of the seven Passion scenes with one of the Seven Sins, Bosch has represented this incident with the Carrying of the Cross. It seems strange at first that Bosch should have seen a manifesta- tion of envy in Christ's being mocked by the thief. The thought is probably based on the next verses (40-41) of this chapter: both are in the same situation, yet the wicked man still directs his evil thoughts toward the virtuous man. Keeping in mind that in the late Middle Ages Invidia had a much more general meaning than the modern envy, that Invidia was opposed to Caritas, and meant an evil attitude toward other men in general, Bosch's representation becomes understandable. Bosch has rendered the thief as turning and looking back at Christ. The idea and etymology of Invidia implies the element of looking at somebody in an inverted or oblique way. The element of "looking" is very prominent also in Bosch's repre- sentation of Invidia on the table-board (Baldass, op.cit., fig. I5). 96. To represent the greed of gain Bosch has exaggerated the Biblical story. The peaceful settlement of the issue as recorded in the Gospels did not sufficiently serve his purpose. The fight for the cloak can already be found in the German tradition of the fifteenth century. See, for instance, Die Anfainge der Miinchner Tafelmalerei, Ausstellung, Munich, 1935, nos. 18, 23, 31. That the painter represents the Parting of Christ's Garments together with the Undressing of Christ is characteristic of his endeavor to connect each of the seven Passion scenes with one of the Seven Sins. According to the Gospels, the incident happens after the Crucifixion.</page><page sequence="32">290 THE ART BULLETIN Thus the Passion of Christ has been transformed by Bosch into a gigantic procession of the vices, and the Mount of Calvary has been turned by the painter into the Mountain of the Deadly Sins, an enormous emblem of the evil in the world. The very outgrowth at the top, insinuating an unpleasing physical abnormity,"7 characterizes the strange structure as something diabolic. Ab- normal human and animal formations, such as cripples, monsters, and the diseased, have always been-and not only in the compositions by Bosch-symbols for the evil and the Satanic in mediaeval and Renaissance art." The idea of a Mountain of Vices may already have existed in contemporary art. If we compare the woodcut by Erhard Schoen showing the Mountain of Lies (Fig. 27)," we find a very similar idea expressed in a very similar way. For Bosch, the Passion of Christ is the result of evil in the world. From this point of view, the significance of the specific type of the Man of Sorrows used by Bosch in this representation becomes at once apparent. Christ is represented only as the image of his sufferings caused by evil. He is not the Redeemer triumphant in spite and because of his sufferings, as he usually occurs in pictures of the Mass of St. Gregory. In Bosch's representation Christ looks down from his tomb in great sadness, as though he were saying, "Behold, what the evil world has done to me! "''? This, indeed, is the essence of the entire painting. Christ appears to warn mankind of evil. His image is an ad- monition to the spectator to avoid the vices and sins represented in the painting, to renounce the wicked ways of the world, and to fight the Judas in his own soul. The didactic intentions of the composition become perfectly clear when we look for a moment again at the hanging Judas as he appears at the top of the Mountain of Sins.o"' In the later art of the Northern Renaissance, the picture of the hanging Judas, conceived as an isolated representa- tion, has become a familiar emblem expressing an ominous warning of evil. A miniature in a volume of poems on the Passion composed by Jacques le Lieur (Fig. 28) shows such a single picture of warning.02" Bosch's representation of the hanging Judas, though still occurring within the context of the Passion, already has the quality of an isolated didactic emblem. Together with the representa- tion appearing at its lower right side, it forms a complete idea in itself which could retain its specific significance even when detached from the larger context. This representation at the lower right shows two shadowy little figures appearing within some elements of a landscape. They are a man with a little boy. The father has raised his arm to point out the hanging Judas to his small son, as though he were saying, "Look here, this is what happens to a wicked man!" This scene of the hanging Judas pointed out as a warning example by a bystander to his little son has a very important meaning in the context of Bosch's entire composition. Although Bosch represented this incident as a historical scene, i.e., as happening during the Passion of Christ, the father and the child are unquestionably at the same time also intended as the figurae of the donor and his son appearing before the altar. In the relation of these figures in the lower part of the composition and the two small figures appearing in the vision at the upper part of the representa- tion, we find the final clue for the understanding of Bosch's painting. The whole composition, 97. In an engraving by the Master BxG (Lehrs 34), apparently a copy of a lost original by the Master of the Amsterdam Cabinet, a large bump or outgrowth appears on the forehead of a fool. In fifteenth century ideology, "fool" and "evildoer" are still very closely connected. Cf. Janson, op.cit., pp. i99f. 98. Cf. Elisabeth Sudeck, Bettlerdarstellungen vom Ende des XV.

This is the place where the subject seems to belong according to the tradition. In a small tempera painting in the Louvre, School of Avignon, about 1390, showing the Carrying of the Cross, the hanging Judas also appears in the background of this scene (Ring, op.cit., fig. 9). A miniature of the Book of Hours of Etienne Chevalier (Paul Wescher, Jean Fouquet and His Time, Basle, I949, pl. i1), and a painting by Derick Baegert (formerly Duenwege) (Robert Nissen, "Derick Baegert aus Wesel," Westfalen, xxII, 1937, p. 216 and pl. xvii) also show the hanging Judas in the background of the Carrying of the Cross.

It is a moral lesson, paid for by his wealthy father kneeling at the left of the altar, and painted by the man behind the curtain who, by his pointing gesture, is characterized as the demonstrator of the scene.104 III The Passion scenes represented on the reverse side of the Bosch painting conclude the theological program of the altarpiece in a traditional way. Whereas the Adoration of the Magi, the basic Bib- lical motive of the front representation, implies the idea of Christ's appearance in the world and of his miraculous Incarnation, the representation on the back shows his Passion and sacrificial Death. However, though the motives of both sides, front as well as back, are traditional and taken from traditional contexts, the real and actual subject of both scenes is not a traditional one. The facts of the Redemption are not the real subject of Bosch's altarpiece; his real and entirely new subject is the world. It is the world which is represented in the three Kings who have come to worship the infant Christ. Making use of one of the many allegorical expositions of the three Wise Men, interpreting them as the three continents, Bosch has shaped these three figures into an impressive, pompous picture of the world in all its worldliness. The emblems of the world's vices and temptations ap- pearing on their garments and other attire are an unmistakable characterization of the three Kings as an allegory of the world. The close connection of the Kings with the large realm of evil, rendered in and around the diabolic hut, makes this underlying idea quite apparent. In addition, the incidents depicted in the landscape, showing the results of the evil contrivances in the hut, are definite proof that Bosch actually meant to portray, in the entire representation, the world in contrast to the Kingdom of God, as it always appears in the Biblical texts.10' In the painting on the reverse side of this altarpiece Bosch also has given a picture of the evil world, and even Christ and the Passion are seen sub specie mundi. This new perspective brought about a very serious change in the character of the Christian altar- piece. Christian altar painting presenting to the vision of the believer the Divine Personages and the acts of the Redemption had, since the beginning of the fifteenth century, adopted a new realism. The particular and fascinating process by which the new worldly values penetrated the sphere of religious representation has frequently been made the subject of scholarly studies.106 The result of this process was the creation of a new symbolism and a powerful new vividness given to the Holy Personages and to the Biblical scenes. Yet, until the work of Bosch, all this still served the original purpose of the altarpiece, to reassure the faithful spectator of the Redemption of his soul accomplished by the Incarnation and Death of the Saviour. Io3. It seems relatively safe to assume that the wife of the donor was dead at the time of the commission of the painting, for otherwise she too would have been portrayed. Her probable recent death may even have something to do with the dedica- tion of the picture. The indulgences one could receive by going before the image of the Gregorian Man of Sorrows were usually passed on to deceased persons, and the Gregorian Masses were held to relieve the dead of some of the punish- ments for their sins. 10o4. See note 49. I05. In the New Testament this juxtaposition occurs many times. The most important text on the world is I John z:I 5-18, containing the famous passage on the Antichrist. These verses can be regarded as the leading text for Bosch's entire work. In representations like Bosch's depicting the wicked world as opposed to the Kingdom of Heaven, the interest is necessarily centered on the infernal and evil, while everything good and virtuous automatically assumes a negative quality. This accounts for the paleness and insignificance of the divine and saintly figures painted by Bosch. Compare notes 6o and ioo. io6. Cf.

This brought the altar painter and the altar painting into what may be called a tragic predicament. Bosch, the first "painter of the world," appears as the moral rejector of his own subject; and the very representation of this subject has changed the character of the Christian altar- piece. Since Bosch not only pictures the world as evil, but the Passion as the result of its wicked- ness and Christ as a helpless sufferer from it, the original purpose of the altarpiece has actually been abolished. Christ and his life no longer appear as powerful reassurances of the accomplished Redemption. Thus in Bosch's paintings the Christian altarpiece is virtually deprived of its most essential property: it has lost its traditional character as an image for religious devotion. In his hands the Christian altarpiece has moved from its original emotional sphere of religion into a new intellectual sphere of moralization. The interpretation of the Mass of St. Gregory on the reverse side of Bosch's altarpiece has made it obvious that the Adoration of the Magi must also have a specific didactic character. The diabolic realm shown on the front of the altarpiece is not represented merely as an impressive demonstra- tion that evil is predominant in the world; it implies also-and above all-a severe warning, a call to renounce it. Thus Bosch has converted the Christian altarpiece into a medium for didactic representation. This may have been one of the reasons why the altarpieces painted by Bosch soon disappeared from the churches during the period following his death. All of them are found very early in private collections.0"' The Reformation can hardly be responsible for this in every case. Perhaps the following generations came to realize that the satiric, didatic character of these paintings made them unsuitable for public devotion.'0' Both Protestants and Catholics had good reasons for ob- jecting to them, and it is not surprising that they were removed from the churches. On the other hand, Bosch's creations appealed immensely to the taste of private art collectors and were eagerly bought up by them, for the character of his paintings, if it made them, in a way, unfit for ecclesi- astical purposes, made them extremely desirable for religious and moral meditation and specula- tion in a secular atmosphere. I do not believe that the enormous popularity which Bosch's work found with the early art collector was merely based on aesthetic reasons. The programmatic scope of his paintings must have been at least equally important in securing them new homes in secular surroundings. Thus the art of Jerome Bosch marks a turning point in the history of Northern painting. His work led very definitely to secular art. Although in Northern painting secular creations can be found long before his time, the work of Jerome Bosch laid the basis for the first really large and im- portant paintings with a wide and elaborate scope expressly created for secular purposes. A great and official secular painting became possible now, finding its models in the great and official religious art, in altar painting turned "worldly." These paintings not only supplied secular works with new technical and artistic accomplishments, but with the basic programmatic ideas essential for the estab- lishment of a new secular art. Io07. The Prado Epiphany, for instance, belonged to a private estate, even before Philip II acquired it for his collec- tion. In 1568 the king had it confiscated from Jan Casembrot, Master of Backerzeele. io8. This objection seems still more justified after looking at other paintings by Bosch, such as the Marriage at Cana or the Garden of Delights. The strange and untraditional charac- ter of these works, however, can by no means be explained by assuming that they were commissioned by an heretical sect (see note I2). Their surprising representations are the result of the same new symbolism, one of satiric, didactic character castigating the sins of an evil world, a symbolism based on a strictly Catholic conviction. The negative character of this symbolism shows clearly the tragic religious situation of the generation before the Reformation. How much Luther's mes- sage, that man's soul will be saved by faith alone and not by good works, must have meant to his contemporaries becomes apparent upon a glance at Bosch's altarpieces. There we see a deep awareness that man is living in a devilish world, and a vivid consciousness of the powerful obstacles to moral behavior and good works.</page><page sequence="35">THE PRADO EPIPHANY BY JEROME BOSCH 293 While the religious painters of the following generations had to make use of the accomplish- ments of the Italian Renaissance in order to establish a new ecclesiastical art, Bosch's work became the basic influence for the work of Pieter Brueghel who, two generations later, resumed the ideas of Jerome Bosch and transformed them for his own secular creations.
