<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chapter 1 A Review of the Research on Student Conceptions in Mathematics, Science, and Programming JERE CONFREY Cornell University Since the time of Piaget, researchers have been keenly interested in how students view the concepts of science, mathematics, and, more recently, programming. In their annual review of research in science education, Shymansky and Kyle (1988) mention nearly 100 studies on student con- ceptions since 1984; Pfundt and Duit (1985, 1988) have amassed a bibli- ography of 1,500 citations in science education alone. Review articles (Driver &amp; Easley, 1978; Driver &amp; Erickson, 1983; Eylon &amp; Linn, 1988; Fisher &amp; Lipson, 1983; Wittrock, 1977) report similarly high levels of activity. In mathematics A. Graeber and M. Johnson (personal communi- cation, May 1989) report collecting over 600 articles on student mis- conceptions, and in biology Mintzes and Arnaudin (1984) report on 68 studies. Reviews on probability (Hawkins &amp; Kapadia, 1984), statistics (Well, Pollatsek, Konold, &amp; Hardiman, 1984), and programming (Pea, Soloway, &amp; Spohrer, 1987) confirm the evidence of vigorous research ac- tivity. At two international conferences at Cornell University (Helm &amp; Novak, 1983; Novak, 1987), researchers gathered from many countries to report on studies in this area. Given the sheer numbers of studies, an ex- haustive review of student conceptions literature is prohibitive; however, these studies show evidence of reemerging themes, issues, and findings that provide a framework for this article. To bound this endeavor, I will use the following selection procedure: (a) Research will be selected from mathematics (including statistics and probability), science, and programming; (b) research will focus on concept-specific studies and thus will exclude research on problem solv- ing, novice/expert studies, and Piagetian stage research; and (c) within the This work is funded under a grant from the National Science Foundation, No. MDR-8652-160. 3</page><page sequence="2">4 Review of Research in Education, 16 concept-specific studies, the selected research will have employed alterna- tive methodologies to short-answer, paper-and-pencil tests that report only on the performance level of students. Although these decisions will eliminate from the review a variety of provocative and influential reports on learning, it allows for a review of a reasonably coherent body of literature. These selection procedures can be argued for on the grounds that all the research included is founded on the assumption that students enter instruction with firmly held beliefs and explanations for phenomena and relationships, and these beliefs are sub- ject matter-specific and can be identified and confirmed only through methods that encourage children to be expressive and predictive. WHAT ARE STUDENT CONCEPTIONS AND WHY STUDY THEM? Osborne and Wittrock (1983) summarized the position of researchers on student conceptions succinctly in their statement that "children de- velop ideas about their world, develop meanings for words used in science [mathematics and programming], and develop strategies to obtain expla- nations for how and why things behave as they do" (p. 49 1). These catego- ries of children's beliefs, theories, meanings, and explanations will form the basis of the use of the term student conceptions. Other researchers use other terms for these constellations of beliefs, including the following: children's science (Osborne &amp; Freyberg, 1985), children's arithmetic (Ginsburg, 1977), mathematics of the tribe (Steffe, 1988), preconceptions (Ausubel, Novak, &amp; Hanesian, 1978), naive theories (Resnick, 1983), conceptual primitives (Clement, 1982), private concepts (Sutton, 1980), and alternative frameworks (Driver, 1981). When those conceptions are deemed to be in conflict with the accepted meanings in science, math, or programming, the term misconceptions (Nesher, 1987; Perkins &amp; Simmons, 1988) is used. (See Abimbola, 1988, for an interesting discus- sion of the significance of the different terms.) Researchers' interest in student conceptions has been provoked by nu- merous studies indicating that (a) before formal study, persons have firmly held, descriptive, and explanatory systems for scientific and logico-mathematical phenomena, that is, systems of belief; (b) these sys- tems of belief differ from what is incorporated into the standard curricu- lum; (c) certain constellations of these belief systems show remarkable consistency across ages, abilities, and nationalities; (d) these belief sys- tems are resistant to change through traditional instruction (Champagne, Gunstone, &amp; Klopfer, 1983; Osborne &amp; Wittrock, 1983). Because of these findings, researchers in these traditions are united in (a) their rejection of the tabula rasa assumption that students enter in- struction with no preconceptions about a topic before it is taught, and (b) their belief that these naive ideas cannot easily be ignored or replaced</page><page sequence="3">Confrey: Student Conceptions 5 through direct instruction or lecture (Gilbert, Osborne, &amp; Fensham, 1982). The framework for the review will consist of a proposed distinction among and discussion of three traditions of research on student concep- tions and student learning, implications of this research for teaching, and suggestions for new directions for the research. THREE FRAMEWORKS: PIAGETIAN GENETIC EPISTEMOLOGY, THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE, AND SYSTEMATIC ERRORS The foundation for research on student conceptions comprises three major traditions, and each has its own epistemological assumptions. These are Piagetian studies in the tradition of genetic epistemology (Piaget, 1970); applications of the philosophy of science in the tradition of conceptual change (Kuhn, 1970; Lakatos, 1976; Lakatos &amp; Musgrave, 1970; Popper, 1959, 1962; Toulmin, 1972); and research on systematic er- rors (Davis, 1980; Perkins &amp; Simmons, 1988; VanLehn, 1982, 1983). Re- search in the first two areas tends to be on student conceptions in science and mathematics, whereas research in the third area focuses on mathe- matics and computer programming. As a way of distinguishing these three areas, I will refer to the first as Piagetian approaches to student con- ceptions, the second as philosophical approaches to students' alternative conceptions, and the third as information processing approaches to stu- dent misconceptions or systematic errors. These three categories are not exhaustive, nor are they mutually exclusive; they do, however, provide an organizing framework for this broad base of research and can be helpful in interpreting the commonalities, controversies, and inconsistencies within it. Piagetian Studies of Student Conceptions: Research in the Tradition of Genetic Epistemology Genetic epistemology is the study of the development (or genesis) of particular concepts over time in children. Considering the history of cur- riculum reform in the post-Sputnik era helps us to understand the role that Piaget and this Piagetian approach to research on student concep- tions have played in the last three decades, particularly in the United States. In 1960, Bruner published The Process of Education, a report of the Woods Hole conference where a prestigious group of physicists, psy- chologists, educators, biologists, chemists, and mathematicians convened to devise a plan for overhauling and updating the curriculum in science and mathematics. In this report, Bruner emphasized the importance of structure in "fitting concepts together and aiding transfer," reviewed the Piagetian stage theory, and introduced the idea of a spiral curriculum.</page><page sequence="4">6 Review of Research in Education, 16 Common Misinterpretations of Piaget's Genetic Epistemology Stages as limitations. Bruner's discussion of stage theory (pp. 34-46) reveals the tendency for individuals who advocated structuring the cur- riculum in forms consistent with the structure of the discipline (as de- fined by practicing mathematicians, scientists, etc.) to misinterpret Piaget's genetic epistemology. Rather than interpreting Piaget's position as providing evidence that young children's conceptions may differ quali- tatively from those of the experts, they interpreted Piaget as suggesting that certain ideas cannot be learned. For instance, Bruner characterizes the preoperational stage as a time of establishing relationships between experience and action but principally as a stage that lacks reversibility. Bruner concludes, Because of this fundamental lack the child cannot understand certain fundamental ideas that lie at the basis of mathematics and physics. ... It goes without saying that teachers are limited in transmitting concepts to a child at this stage, even in a highly intuitive manner. (p. 35) In other sections of the book, however, Bruner seems sympathetic to the qualitatively different views of children. He describes the concrete opera- tional stage as operating either directly through manipulation of objects or internally through representations. He emphasizes that operations must be internalized and reversible, unlike simple actions or goal- directed behavior. He discussed internalized structures as the way the child represents the world. Bruner then claims "It is into the language of these internal structures that one must translate ideas if the child is to grasp them" (p. 37). Stages as the basis for acceleration. In his discussion of the other stages, Bruner shows evidence of another tendency of American readers of Piaget: to interpret the research on stages as implying that one should at- tempt to accelerate children's progress toward the abstraction of formal operations. The stage of formal operations is based on the child's ability to operate on hypothetical propositions, to deduce, predict, and check. Bruner states, "What is most important for teaching basic concepts is that the child be helped to pass progressively from concrete thinking to the utili- zation of more conceptually adequate modes of thought" (p. 38, emphasis added). He followed this with a statement that turned out to be a major issue of debate at the conference: But the intellectual development of the child is no clockwork sequence of events; it also re- sponds to influences from the environment, notably the school environment. Thus instruc- tion in scientific ideas, even at the elementary level, need not follow slavishly the natural course of cognitive development in the child. It can also lead intellectual development by</page><page sequence="5">Confrey: Student Conceptions 7 providing challenging but usable opportunities for the child to forge ahead in his develop- ment. (p. 39) Inhelder was in Woods Hole as a representative of the Piagetian school and responded to this position with a concern that was to prove propheti- cally accurate: that researchers in the United States would focus on trying to accelerate the child's progress rather than on "seeing what goes on when a child passes to a new level of understanding." Piaget and Inhelder did not deny that learning environments could be more or less conducive to aid the intellectual development of the child; however, as Piaget put it, for him the question was not how fast we can help intelligence to grow but how far we can help it to grow (in Duckworth, 1987, p. 38). Duckworth re- ports on a conversation she had with Inhelder: Physicists and psychologists, including Bruner, generally reproached the Genevan research- ers for the observational passivity. In effect, they said, "You've done nothing but document the child's unaided development, you don't intervene. Surely each of the notions you have studied is composed of other simpler notions. Surely it is sufficient to decompose each of the complex notions into its simpler parts, to teach the simpler parts and to aid the construc- tion of the whole notion in this way." The parallels with physics are clear. The world of phys- ics is infinitely manipulable. If one knows the constituent mechanisms, one can unmake and remake a process in innumerable ways, taking it apart and putting it together as one wishes. In contrast, the biologists, on the whole, understood Inhelder's point that a child's thinking was not as manipulable as a physical phenomenon ... a child's thinking responded with the integrity of a biological organism and not like the separate components of a physical mecha- nism." (p. 34) Duckworth then reported that, of all the physicists, Friedman best un- derstood this claim. He and others then created the Elementary Science Study, the program she claims is "most consistent with the work of Piaget and Inhelder in psychology" (p. 34). What we witness in this exchange was to have a dramatic influence on research on student conceptions in the United States. The new curricula emphasized the "structure of knowl- edge" of the disciplines and, in doing so, sought to weave these organizing concepts into the curriculum from the early elementary grades and on. Less attention was given to the claim that children may have their own idiographic ways of understanding these ideas and that these ways might differ or conflict with the views held by scientists and mathematicians. The result in many cases was that the curriculum became formally more current and sophisticated, but the child's world was neglected in the pro- cess. The lesson in Piaget that was ignored was his biological view of human development: that, through the process of maturation as defined in relation to experiences in the environment and culture, a child develops certain perspectives and beliefs that are functionally adaptive, and these</page><page sequence="6">8 Review of Research in Education, 16 perspectives and beliefs may or may not correspond well with the views of disciplinary experts. Positive Influences of Piaget's Genetic Epistemology The impact of the curriculum reform of the sixties on student concep- tions was by no means solely detrimental: It focused on concepts (as op- posed to rote procedures) and it encouraged subject-area experts to develop a keen interest in educational issues. Both of these outcomes were necessary in providing the context in which student conceptions research was to thrive. Furthermore, the Piagetian perspective required a radical shift from the behaviorism that then dominated the American educational programs, and this shift included increased awareness of the importance of students' direct physical interactions with objects, that is, the use of manipulatives. It can be argued that these reforms were ex- actly what was needed for developing more constructivist views of class- rooms that were to recognize the schism between the formal account provided by experts and the physical, intuitive, and pragmatic world of the child. Emphasis on students' conceptions. To understand that the Piagetian stage research provided a framework for the focus on student concep- tions, one needs to recognize that Piaget's stage research constituted a macrostructure that examined such fundamental topics as space, time, causality, conservation, and object permanence. By identifying the broad, stable changes in structure, Piaget hoped to allow for the development of other studies that focused on the microgenesis (or development) of spe- cific concepts held by students. Researchers who recognized these possi- bilities in the Piagetian tradition established a vital tradition of task-oriented research on student conceptions (Davis, 1975, 1976, 1980; Duckworth, 1987; Easley, 1977; Ginsburg, 1976; Hawkins, 1974). Children's views of knowledge. Duckworth (1987) provided a careful analysis of the Woods Hole controversy in a chapter entitled "Either We're Too Early and They Can't Learn It or We're Too Late and They Know It Already: The Dilemma of 'Applying Piaget."' She then articu- lated the basis for curriculum development (or for research) on student conceptions. In trying to explain why some people pursue an idea deeply, whereas others are satisfied with superficial explanations, she draws at- tention to the view of knowledge as a lens by which certain qualities of our experience gain clarity. She acknowledges that "all the rest of the world passes us by unless we think of thinking about it in that way" (p. 40). Pro- viding examples from the Genevan work, she identified certain qualities that distinguished merely completing a task from understanding: (a) the child has a theory so that, when it conflicts with his or her expectations, he or she can revise it; and (b) three types of knowledge interplay-</page><page sequence="7">Confrey: Student Conceptions 9 perceptual knowledge (the way things look over time), action knowledge (the way I have done things before), and conceptual knowledge (the name I give things, the way it has been represented, that is, an idea, word, or for- mula). To explore the children's theories and their knowledge in these three modes, Duckworth (1987, p. 42) quotes from Blanchet (1977): "A good experimental situation must permit the child to establish plans to reach a distant goal, while leaving him wide freedom to follow his own routing" (p. 37). Learners' need for time. A commitment to allowing the child (or teacher) enough freedom and time to explore an idea has become a basic tenet of work in the tradition of genetic epistemology. For instance, Duckworth (1987, chap. 6) and Bamberger and Duckworth (1982) report on their work with teachers, which lasted over a year, on phases of the moon. In summarizing the needs of learners to explore phenomena more fully, Duckworth (1987) wrote, Teachers are often, and understandably, impatient for their students to develop clear and adequate ideas. But putting ideas in relation to each other is not a simple job. It is confusing; and that confusion does take time. All of us need time for our confusion if we are to build the breadth and depth that give significance to our knowledge. (p. 82) Other research in this tradition includes the work of Papert (1980) on Logo, Franz and Papert (1988) on time, and Lampert (1986) on multiplication. Karmiloff-Smith and Inhelder (1975) described an early example of the Piagetian genetic epistemology approach in their article, "If You Want To Get Ahead, Get a Theory." In an experiment in which 65 children ages 4 years, 6 months and 9 years, 5 months were asked to balance a variety of blocks across a narrow bar so that they did not fall, the researchers were to conduct "experiments on children's spontaneous organizing activity in goal-oriented tasks ... [where] ... the focus is not on success or failure, per se, but on the interplay between action sequences and children's theories in action, i.e., the implicit ideas or changing modes of representa- tion underlying the sequences" (p. 196). They distinguished two kinds of approaches: action-response (judged as success or failure to balance) and theory-response (judged as collaboration or refutation of the theory). Those children who developed a theory such as "the geometric center is the point of balance" were unlikely to give it up. In cases where the blocks were unevenly weighted, these children were likely to label the task impos- sible. When they were encouraged to try it with their eyes closed, they could balance them, but when they opened their eyes, they denied the le- gitimacy of their solution and moved the blocks to the geometric center. In many cases, they performed less well than did their younger counter-</page><page sequence="8">10 Review of Research in Education, 16 parts. The authors explored three possible strategies for assisting them in changing their theories: (a) the use of counterexamples, (b) changes in general cognitive competence, such as differentiating length and weight in their possible impact on balance, and (c) integration of proprioceptive in- formation (e.g., information from physical sensations) gained by tactics such as placing their finger over the spot of contact (like a nail), or holding the block at opposite ends to sense the distribution of weight and deriving a sense of the multiple forces from this experience. This research is particularly relevant to our discussion of student con- ceptions, because it represents the movement of Piagetian researchers away from the more fixed stages of macrolevel structures toward an explo- ration of the psychogenesis of ideas both within and across stages, al- though still using the stages as frames for viewing the data, but in a dynamic developmental context. Furthermore, this shift indicates the presaging of (a) the role of students' theories in learning, (b) the initial de- crease in the flexibility of students' ideas accompanying the development of a theoretical position that later may lead to integration of information previously considered disparate (e.g., the proprioceptive information), and (c) the progressive development of these theories in response to counterexamples. As stated by Karmiloff-Smith and Inhelder: Our observations indicate that children hold on to their initial theory for as long as they can. Even where they finally do take counter-examples into consideration, they first prefer to cre- ate a new theory, quite independent of the first one, before finally attempting to unify all events under a single, broader theory. (p. 209) Critical barriers to learning. Hawkins and his colleagues at the Moun- tain View Center in Boulder, Colorado, have devoted considerable effort to the exploration of student conceptions in science (Hawkins, 1974, 1978). In 1982, Hawkins, Apelman, Colton, and Flexner published a re- port on the phenomena they called "critical barriers to learning." They provided the following operational definition: First, critical barriers are conceptual obstacles which confine and inhibit scientific under- standing. Second, they are critical, and so differ from other conceptual difficulties, be- cause: a) they involve preconceptions, which the learner retrieves from past experiences, that are incompatible with scientific understanding; b) they are widespread among adults as well as children, among the academically able but scientifically naive as well as those less well educated; c) they involve not simply difficulty in acquiring scientific fact but in assimilated conceptual frames for ordering and retrieving important facts; d) they are not narrow in their application but, when once surmounted, prove key to the comprehension of a range of phenomena. To surmount a critical barrier is not merely to overcome one ob- stacle but to open up new pathways to scientific understanding; e) Another hallmark of the class is that when a distinct breakthrough does occur, there is often strong affect, a true joy in discovery. (p. c-l)</page><page sequence="9">Confrey: Student Conceptions 11 Hawkins et al. believe that these critical barriers need to be distinguished from other learning difficulties, which include disruptions in students' lives outside of school, poorly planned teaching, or overly quick or confus- ing instruction. They claim that "certain kinds of conceptual difficulties which students experience are indeed intrinsic to the growth of scientific understanding" (p. c-22). Examples of critical barriers explored by this team include size and scale, heat and temperature, and light and color. Listening to students. Easley and Driver also are pioneers in research on student conceptions. In On Clinical Studies in Mathematics Education, Easley (1977) offered examples of clinical interview studies and ex- plained that their methodological validity depended on assumptions dif- ferent from those of more traditional psychometric statistical studies. When a clinical researcher focused on the elaboration of a single case, Easley argued, a different form of generalizability resulted than from studies with large samples: "Clinical researchers feel that they can genera- lize from a study of a single case to some other individual cases because they have seen a given phenomenon in one situation in sufficient detail and know its essential workings to be able to recognize it when they en- counter it in another situation" (p. 2). One Piagetian study Easley re- viewed in some detail was on the relationship between conservation of volume and the operation of multiplication. He investigated the relation- ship between the use of mathematical ideas as descriptions of mental phe- nomena and how such a use intertwines epistemology, psychology, philosophy, and history. He concluded this section by writing, There seems to be no escaping the implications .. . that teachers would have to understand rather well the process of cognitive development and listen to and observe children carefully so as to grasp with reasonable accuracy what kind of mental operations they are bringing to bear on a given task. (p. 21) This statement captures a fundamental commitment of these research- ers to the belief that teaching is most effectively improved when the teacher learns to listen to students' thoughts and to interpret students' ac- tions and thoughts from their perspective as children. Driver and Easley (1978) distinguish between nomothetic and ideo- graphic studies to focus on the idea of modeling the child's world. Nomothetic studies assess the correspondence between student's views and the accepted scientific views; in contrast, ideographic studies are those in which "the pupils' conceptualizations are explored and analyzed in their own terms without assessment against an externally defined system" (p. 63). In mathematics, Davis and Ginsburg (Davis, 1976), working col- laboratively on the Madison Project, also were learning to articulate stu-</page><page sequence="10">12 Review of Research in Education, 16 dents' perspectives. Put simply, researchers in the genetic epistemology tradition learned to listen to students. Largely as a result of work by ear- lier psychologists, such as Piaget (1970, 1973a) and Brownell (in Weaver &amp; Kilpatrick, 1972), these researchers sought to describe how concepts and tasks appear to students, rather than compare students' performance against a set of preconceived categories. Value is placed on the process of solving a problem, not just its outcome. As stated by Erlwanger (1975), "If children develop their knowledge of mathematics largely through their own activity as they learn mathematics in a particular environment, then evaluation should be an attempt to discover from their point of view just what they have learned and understood" (p. 166, emphasis added). To look at the ideas from a student's point of view, these researchers chose to use flexible interviews and to study individuals or small groups. What they discovered was stated bluntly in an early issue of Children's Mathematical Behavior, wherein Davis (1975) wrote, "The fact that what was mathematically necessary for the solution of the equation: 3/x = 6/3x + 1 differed considerably from what was cognitively necessary, and the details of how they differed, constitute the main value of the 15-minute interview for us, if not for Henry" (pp. 8-9, emphasis in the original). Intuitive mathematicians versus blank slates. Davis (1976) and Ginsburg (1976) collaborated on early work at Cornell University, re- ported in the same issue of Children's Mathematical Behavior. Ginsburg (1975) introduced another theme of great significance in conceptions re- search. He wrote of the young child as an "intuitive mathematician" (p. 63). Rejecting the tabula rasa view of the child, he suggested that "through spontaneous interaction with the environment, he develops var- ious techniques-perceptual skills, patterns of thought, concepts, count- ing methods-for coping with the quantitative problems" (p. 63). In Children's Arithmetic (1977), he offers five observations about errors: 1. Errors result from organized strategies and rules ... 2. Faulty rules underlying errors have sensible origins ... 3. Too often children see arithmetic as an activity isolated from their ordinary concerns ... 4. Children demonstrate a gap between informal and formal knowledge ... 5. Children often possess unsuspected strengths. (p. 129) Early work on student conceptions undertaken in the Piagetian tradi- tion was devoted to legitimizing small, intensive studies on how students viewed particular concepts. It emphasized the importance of exploring er- rors rather than suppressing them. It recognized the significance of exam- ining the psychogenesis of concepts rather than the meanings given to concepts by disciplinary experts. It also raised questions about the inter- play of formal schooling and everyday experience.</page><page sequence="11">Confrey: Student Conceptions 13 Constructivism. Also in the Piagetian tradition, we witness the develop- ment of an approach to children's learning known as constructivism (Confrey, 1985; Easley, 1977; Hunting, 1986; von Glasersfeld, 1984b). The roots of constructivism are many: Steffe and Cobb (1983) trace their roots through structuralism (Brownell, 1945) and operationalism (Bridgman, 1927). Nik Azis Nik Pa (1986) compares these schools. Steffe's work with students focused on early number (Steffe, von Glasersfeld, Richards, &amp; Cobb, 1983) and, more recently, on the develop- ment of multiplication in relation to the concept of counting and the evo- lution of increasingly complex schemes about units (Steffe, 1988; Steffe &amp; Cobb, 1988). Methodologically, constructivist research demands extensive interac- tions with students over months and years and the detailed analysis of videotapes. Its focus is on building a model of the details of the students' views, abilities, beliefs, and inclinations about certain mathematical ideas (Cobb &amp; Steffe, 1983). Steffe (1988) refers to these descriptions as "the mathematics of children" (p. 122). Steffe (n. d.) wrote, Individuals who believe that mathematics is the way it is rather than the way human beings make it to be might reject my work out of hand because they may not believe that mathe- matics of children is legitimate mathematics. I find this to be particularly unsettling, be- cause in my way of thinking, the mathematical knowledge of the other should be taken as relative to one's own frame of reference. It can be known through interpreting the language and the actions of the others-by forming a conceptual model. These models are under- stood as springing from the conceptual operations that are available to the knower. They are nothing other than a constellation of available conceptual operations that are formed in organizing or making sense of experiential encounters with children. Such models con- stitute mathematics of children even though they are not taken to characterize how mathe- matical the knowledge of children really is. They are taken as fit rather than a match (Von Glasersfeld, 1983). (p. 13) A central construct in the work of Steffe is that of a scheme, which Piaget defined as that which is repeatable and generalizable in an action. This idea of a scheme provides the vehicle for examining the local devel- opment of a concept, because its size and plasticity allow for a more flex- ible evolution than is connoted by the term mental structures. Essential to the constructivist view is the recognition that "the essential way of knowing the real world is not directly through our senses, but first and foremost through our material or mental actions" (Sinclair, 1987). Thus, the parts of the scheme are not situations that exist independently from the child, but are only recognized in relation to the child's current forms of operation and action. Steffe proposes an elaborate model of functional and metamorphic accommodation, which he uses to elaborate on the process of reflective abstraction. Schemes thus function as the</page><page sequence="12">14 Review of Research in Education, 16 mental activity that can be acted on and transformed into knowledge through reflection and abstraction. The Piagetian framework makes certain fundamental assumptions about the learner as an epistemological being. Von Glasersfeld stresses the importance of examining epistemology (the study of knowledge), rather than ontology (the study of the nature of being). He rejects the pos- sibility of the position that knowing is ascertaining the accuracy of the correspondence between our knowledge and the external world on the grounds that a claim of certainty about the accuracy of the correspon- dence would itself be a product of human knowing and thus fail to test the correspondence objectively (a classic argument dating back to the skep- tics). Accepting that we are trapped in our own human ways of knowing, he suggests that we seek "fit" rather than "match" in our conceptual struc- tures, as a key fits a lock (1984a). By using this metaphor, he is suggesting that we need to determine if our concepts seem practically viable, rather than objectively true. Therefore he argues that biological adaptation is more appropriate than correspondence for examining learning. In a dis- cussion of Piaget's concept of cognitive adaptation, he argued for this use of viability: I have elsewhere discussed the misleading connotation of "adaptation" and suggested the term "viability" would be more adequate. From the organism's point of view, on the biologi- cal level as on the cognitive one, the environment is no more and no less than the sum of con- straints within which the organism can operate. The organism's activities and operations are successful when they are not impeded or foiled by constraints, i.e., when they are viable. Hence it is only when actions or operations fail that one can speak of "contact" with the en- vironment, not when they succeed. (1982, p. 615) Explaining further, he adds a quote by Piaget, "D'autre part, l'objet se laisse faire" (Piaget, Inhelder, Garcia, &amp; Voneche, 1977, p. 64) and comments To say that the object-and here this refers to the "ontic" object... -permits the opera- tions the subject carries out is an elegant way of saying that, in a given context, the object, the environment, the "reality" in which the acting subject is embedded, does not hinder or pre- vent the subject's actions, and it is this absence of obstacle or constraint that makes the ac- tion viable. (1982, pp. 615-616) Von Glasersfeld expresses in these excerpts a key perspective on appar- ent errors or deviations. He emphasizes that it is through discrepancy, perturbation, or encounters with the unexpected that we can envision the qualities of our constructs; these key moments in our activities of reflec- tion are opportunities to glimpse our own constructs. However, he also warns us that our "problems," that is, our perceptions of deviance, may</page><page sequence="13">Confrey: Student Conceptions 15 not coincide (and probably will not coincide) with those of children. Thus if we want to investigate their conceptions, we need to seek out their prob- lems, not to impose ours. Another example of research that evolved within the Piagetian tradi- tion can be seen in the work of Kamii on early number. In Young Children Re-invent Arithmetic: Implications of Piaget's Theory, Kamii (1985) de- scribed her work with Clark redefining the activities of a first grade classroom in arithmetic to be constructivist in its approaches. Kamii's discussion of Piaget's contrast between empirical abstraction (e.g., the ab- straction of color from objects) and reflective abstraction (e.g., the abstrac- tion necessary to create number) expresses her constructivist position. She wrote that Piaget defined empirical abstraction as learning to focus on a certain property while ignoring others. She then indicates the crucial interplay between these two kinds of abstraction. She describes reflective abstraction as follows: Reflective abstraction, in contrast, involves the construction of relationships between/ among objects. Relationships ... do not have an existence in external reality. The similarity or difference between one chip and another does not exist in one chip or the other, nor any- where else in external reality. This relationship exists only in the minds of those who can cre- ate it between the objects. The term constructive abstraction might be easier to understand than reflective abstraction to indicate that this abstraction is a veritable construction by the mind rather than a focus on something that already exists in objects. (p. 9) Summary Piagetian work on student conceptions examined the development of student understanding of particular mathematical and scientific concepts over time. Piaget's (1970) fundamental assumption is that knowledge is a process, not a state. Hence knowledge needs to be examined in relation to its developmental associations (its local ecology of ideas). Therefore Piaget studied conceptions, not misconceptions. Second, he recognized the interplay between subject and object and declared, "Intelligence ... organizes the world by organizing itself" (Piaget, 1973b, cited in von Glasersfeld, 1982, p. 613). To summarize the influences of genetic episte- mology on research on student conceptions: 1. Researchers focus on the development of microstructures, in con- trast to stage research, which focuses on macrostructures. 2. In looking at the development of particular concepts, researchers seek to examine through tasks how a child acts, perceives, and operates. 3. Mental operations (i.e., an internalized action which is reversible, involves an invariant, and exists within a structure of operations) form the basic roots of conceptual development. 4. These mental operations are embedded in schemes (sequences of ac- tions), which become active when a certain situation is encountered.</page><page sequence="14">16 Review of Research in Education, 16 5. The construction, refinement, and internalization of these schemes occur within a theory-building approach complete with experimentation. 6. Reflective abstraction is assumed to be the process by which the schemes are stabilized. As Piaget stated in 1964 at a conference in the United States, "The ac- cent must be on auto-regulation, on active assimilation-the accent must be on the activity of the subject. Failing this there is no possible didactic or pedagogy which significantly transforms the subject" (Ripple &amp; Rockcastle, 1964, p. i). Studies of Students' Alternative Conceptions: Research in the Philosophy of Science Tradition Developments in the last century in the philosophy of science consider- ably influenced views of teaching of science and to a lesser degree, mathe- matics. Many of these were inspired by the work of Kuhn and his predecessors and colleagues. Kuhn's revisionary account of the history of science and his discussion of the sociology of schooling and its impact on the work of the scientist spurred avid interest in considering how the de- velopment of disciplinary knowledge might inform us about the develop- ment of an individual's knowledge. When Kuhn published The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1970, he made widely accessible the claim and evidence that science does not proceed by a simple progressive accretion of scientific fact. He wrote of the dilemma facing historians of science, who can no longer view their discipline as one that "chronicles both [the] successive increments and the obstacles that have inhibited their accumulation" (Kuhn, 1970, p. 2). Kuhn continues: Simultaneously, these same historians confront growing difficulties in distinguishing the "scientific" component of past observation and belief from what their predecessors had readily labeled "error" and "superstition." The more carefully they study, say, Aristotelian dynamics, phlogistic chemistry, or caloric thermodynamics, the more certain they feel that those once current views of nature were, as a whole, neither less scientific nor more the prod- uct of human idiosyncrasy than those current today. If these out-of-date beliefs are to be called myths, then myths can be produced by the same sorts of methods and held for the same sorts of reasons that now lead to scientific knowledge. If, on the other hand, they are to be called science, then science has included bodies of belief quite incompatible with the ones we hold today. Given these alternatives, the historian must choose the latter. Out-of-date theories are not in principle unscientific because they have been discarded. That choice, however, makes it difficult to see scientific development as a process of accretion. (pp. 2-3) As an alternative to "progress through accretion," Kuhn introduced the idea of a paradigm: theoretical and methodological commitments shared</page><page sequence="15">Confrey: Student Conceptions 17 by practicing members of a scientific community. During periods when a paradigm is thriving, the members practice normal science (puzzle solv- ing). "And when ... the profession can no longer evade anomalies that subvert the existing tradition of scientific practice-then begin the ex- traordinary investigations that lead the profession at least to a new set of commitments, a new basis for the practice of science" (p. 6). He named these "tradition-shattering" episodes scientific revolutions. His work spurred the attention of many science educators to the nature of scientific thought. Kuhn's position had evolved from an exciting revision of the views of scientific thought, which can be traced to Popper (1959, 1962). Popper re- jected the verification principle of the logical positivist, denying the pos- sibility of restricting scientific inquiry to that which was observably verifiable. However, he inserted in its place the requirement that scien- tific ideas must be refutable-that is, they cannot be verified, but they can be rejected. Thus, he argued that one did not prove theories; their acceptance rested on a failure to discredit or refute them. Elaborating on this theme, Lakatos (1970) further argued for a model of a "research programme" (akin to Kuhn's paradigm), which placed an ir- refutable core at its center, surrounded by a protective belt of less essen- tial theoretical positions, and finally terminating in an external boundary of empirical fact. He classified research programs as progressive, if they were gaining in explanatory potential, or degenerating, if outstanding problems were accumulating. Both philosophers of science took the posi- tion that observations are theory-laden and hence rejected a simple in- ductive model of "the scientific method." In Human Understanding (1972), Toulmin proposed to replace Kuhn's revolutionary view of science, where paradigms overthrew previous para- digms in relatively dramatic changes, with an evolutionary view. He ar- gued for examining the periods and conditions of change in order to examine the rationality behind a theoretical position: "Questions of 'ra- tionality' are concerned, precisely, not with the particular intellectual doctrines that a man-or professional group-adopts at any given time, but rather with the conditions on which, and the manner in which, he is prepared to criticize and change those doctrines as time goes on" (p. 84, emphasis in original). Based on Toulmin's work, the conditions under which conceptual frameworks are altered became known as "conceptual change." This work in the philosophy of science by Kuhn, Lakatos, Toulmin, and others (see Phillips, 1983) spurred the imagination of science educators, who formed an intellectual tradition in which they could interpret work that was being undertaken under the heading of preconceptions (Ausubel, 1968; Novak, 1985) and misconceptions (Clement, 1981). The attrac-</page><page sequence="16">18 Review of Research in Education, 16 tiveness of the philosophy of science to science educators was based in part on three converging factors: (a) It allowed these researchers to cri- tique the underlying inductive conception of science, which permeated the textbooks in the form of "the scientific method"; (b) it rejected theo- retically neutral observations and, hence, could support the position that students enter instruction with firmly held beliefs or preconceptions; and (c) it strongly supported the claim that student conceptions relied on a configuration of beliefs, commitments, and expectations and thus to alter these preconceptions and misconceptions would require intellectual transformations akin to those that accompanied transitions in paradigms, a weak view of "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny." Early Work on Preconceptions and Misconceptions Although I have placed the work of Ausubel under the framework of philosophy of science, it did not derive from it. In fact, the work of Ausubel (1963, 1968) and his prot6g6s (e.g., Novak, 1985) predates the popularization of the conceptual change approaches by at least a decade. However, the merging of these two perspectives marked the beginning of the most active period of research on misconceptions and alternative con- ceptions; hence I have joined these perspectives in my discussion. As explained in Novak and Gowin (1984), Ausubel distinguished be- tween meaningful and rote learning. Rejecting the verbatim repetition of definitions and the algorithmic reproduction of procedures of rote learn- ing, he specified the conditions for meaningful learning: appropriate ma- terials, the disposition of the student to relate old and new ideas, and preconceptions, which allow the student to act on this disposition. He saw cognitive structure as hierarchically organized, an idea he elaborated on in his use of the terms subsumption, the use of general concepts to acquire and organize new concepts; progressive differentiation, in which new link- ages are formed between related concepts; and integrative reconciliation, in which relating previously discrete concepts resolves conflicts in meanings. The importance of this work comes from its emphasis on examining "what a student already knows." Because the framework in which Ausubel worked depended largely on the logical operations of differentia- tion and integration, it fit particularly well into the research on biological sciences, where concepts and terminology are structurally and function- ally interrelated. Using this Ausubelian framework, Novak and his stu- dents (Fisher &amp; Lipson, 1983; Novak, 1985) developed the technique of concept mapping as a way of visualizing relationships among proposi- tions. Others use propositional skeletons (West, Fensham, &amp; Garrard, 1985) or semantic maps. These tools drew students' attention to an over-</page><page sequence="17">Confrey: Student Conceptions 19 view of a field of study and led to the inclusion of metacognitive perspec- tive in the work on student conceptions. Clement's work (1981) provides a classic introduction to approaches to research on misconceptions in the early phase. In this work (conducted considerably earlier than its publication date), Clement and his col- leagues administered four word problems to a sample of 150 freshman en- gineers, two of which required particular numerical results, and two of which were general equation problems of the "students and professors" type. (Students were asked to write an algebra equation for the statement: At a certain university, there are six times as many students as professors.) Their performance on writing equations for particular problems was over 90%; on the two generalized equation problems, it fell to 63% and 27%, respectively. Clement systematically demonstrated the compulsion of the errors by placing a warning with the problems. He comments on their apparent simplicity with the statement, "The data reveal a class of problems which should be trivial for a scientifically literate person, but which are solved incorrectly by large numbers of science-oriented students" (p. 17). In other work on this same class of problems, he demonstrates the perva- siveness of the "misconception," because similar error patterns are found across different symbol systems: equations, tables, word sentences, and pictures. Clement also demonstrates a characteristic trend in this research when he creates two explanations of the source of the errors: a word-matching strategy and a static comparison strategy. He hypothesizes that these strategies can be used to interpret the statements students make as they think aloud the solutions to problems during interviews. He contrasts those strategies with an "operative approach," in which a student "views the equation as an active operation on a variable quantity" (p. 21). Nowhere in the paper does Clement define explicitly the term miscon- ception. He uses various alternative phrases: "conceptual stumbling block" (p. 29), "inconsistent semi-autonomous schemes," and "cognitive processes responsible for errors in problem solving" (p. 16), whose re- ferent may be "misconceptions," but the relationship is never offered explicitly. In sum, the early phase of misconceptions research established certain parameters and themes. The dominant perspective was that, in learning certain key concepts in the curriculum, students were transforming in an active way what was told to them, and those transformations often led to serious misconceptions. Misconceptions were documented to be surpris- ing, pervasive, and resilient. Connections between misconceptions, lan- guage, and informal knowledge were proposed. The maturing of conceptions research quickened as the work on stu-</page><page sequence="18">20 Review of Research in Education, 16 dents' preconceptions and misconceptions was interpreted within a more explicit epistemological framework. It was postulated that students held "mini theories": configurations of beliefs that were likened to the broad theoretical commitments held by communities of scientists. Individual beliefs were set within an overall framework of beliefs about science, its content and conduct, and the certainty of its conclusions. Conflicts be- tween the informal use of language and formal scientific usage were seen as a source of confusion and misinterpretation for students. As in the phi- losophy of science, a key transformation of the field of science and mathe- matics education began to gain acceptance. Similar to historians' rejection of the progress of science by accretion, science and mathematics educators began to reject the idea that learning proceeds by the accumula- tion of facts or rules. The dominant paradigm in classroom teaching of science had been to assume that new information would be assimilated nonproblematically and that concepts were basically collections of shared attributes. During this period, researchers began to make statements sim- ilar to the following: "* There is a parallel between how theory influences observation and how preconceptions influence future learning (Novak, 1977b). "* Students possess well-established beliefs when entering instruction, and those beliefs are more akin to minitheories than to propositional knowl- edge (Claxton, 1987; Osborne, 1984). "* To change individual conceptual frameworks, one would have to chal- lenge the overall conception of science held by many students and teachers (Confrey, 1980; Driver &amp; Bell, 1986). These perspectives led to an interest in conceptual change research and eventually to conceptual change curriculum development. To discuss this rich set of work, I am proposing a set of themes that rep- resent the conceptions research in science. My summary of this work will rely on reviews by Driver and Erickson (1983), Driver and Easley (1978), Gilbert and Watts (1983), Gilbert et al. (1982), Champagne et al. (1983), Osborne and Wittrock (1983), Pope and Gilbert (1983), Helm and Novak (1983), Novak (1987), Eylon and Linn (1988), and the book, Cognitive Structure and Conceptual Change (West &amp; Pines, 1985). Samples of the research in science education on these topics follow. For a more complete listing, see Eylon and Linn (1988, Table 1, pp. 254-255). Preconceptions. Researchers in science were often motivated to exam- ine students' conceptions because it was believed that an understanding of a student's prior knowledge determined the appropriate starting point for instruction (Ausubel, 1968; Bruner, 1960; Novak, 1977a, 1977b). As Hawkins et al. (1982) wrote,</page><page sequence="19">Confrey: Student Conceptions 21 In some contrast with studies which have the ... aim of paying attention to what students don't know ... our purpose is always, at least in principle, to find out conjecturally, and more firmly where possible, what students do know, and then how this knowledge can be raised by them to the level of consciousness-retrieved for their own use in further learning. (p. C-3) The focus on preconceptions represented a basic rejection of a tabula rasa approach to learning. The assumption was that students connect new ideas to existing ideas, and that the existing knowledge thus serves as both a filter and a catalyst to the acquisition of new ideas. To understand what students will learn, one must first determine what they currently believe. Some of the earliest work on student conceptions was undertaken in physics (Clement, 1982; McCloskey, Caramazza, &amp; Green, 1980; McDermott, Rosequist, Popp, &amp; van Zee, 1983; Minstrell, 1982). In this area, researchers report that students hold naive conceptions of force such as "a force is a push or a pull" (Minstrell &amp; Stimpson, 1986), or that "continuing motion implies a continued force in the direction of the movement" (Clement, 1982). Other areas of preconceptions in physics in- clude torque (Barowy &amp; Lochhead, 1980), simple circuits (Fredette and Lochhead, 1980), curvilinear motion (McCloskey et al., 1980), and posi- tion, velocity, and acceleration (McDermott et al., 1983). Conceptual structure. A second theme stresses the structure of relation- ships among concepts. Pines (1985) describes the meaning of cognitive structure: Cognitive means "of the mind; having the power to know, recognize and conceive; concern- ing personally acquired knowledge," so cognitive structure concerns the individual's ideas, meanings, concepts, cognitions and so on. Structure refers to the form, the arrangement of elements or parts of anything, the manner or organization; the emphasis here is not on the elements, although they are important to a structure, but on the way those elements are bound together. (p. 101) The importance of structure derives from the interrelationship among concepts. Often, concepts (e.g., force, mass, and acceleration; rate, time, and distance) are intricately interwoven into related concepts. Hawkins et al. suggest that such a tight weave is characteristic of scientific knowledge, as opposed to common sense knowledge, and warns that it leads to a kind of instructional paradox. They wrote, To understand any one concept, a node in the network logically connected to other nodes, it is necessary to understand many others as well. This logical tightness of scientific ideas, their mutual interdependence, suggests immediately a paradox: they cannot be learned: not in isolation from each other; not all at once, hence not at all. Such a paradoxical conclusion only states, in extreme form, the origin of many of the student difficulties. (pp. ci 5-c 16, em- phasis in the original)</page><page sequence="20">22 Review of Research in Education, 16 For some, methods of creating conceptual maps, semantic networks, and so forth, are important to provide a more holistic and relational per- spective on concepts (Novak, 1985; Pines, 1985). Others emphasize the need to not only understand what is known, but to examine how it is or- ganized (West et al., 1985). Still others emphasize an instructional valid- ity for the methods, finding them useful tools to promote consideration of alternative organizations and to reveal misconceptions (Champagne, Gunstone, &amp; Klopfer, 1985). White (1985) proposed nine dimensions of cognitive structure to explain the variation among students: extent, preci- sion, internal consistency, accord with reality or generally accepted truth, variety of types of element, variety of topics, shape, ratio of internal to ex- ternal dimensions, and availability. Pines (1985) expressed the impor- tance of variation as he described "these bundles of meaningful relations we call concepts [which] are, on the one hand, capable of change, and, on the other hand, can never be acquired in any finalistic fashion. Any new relations will affect, to some extent, the total framework of relations" (p. 110). For Pines (1985), this allows a definition of a misconception within conceptual structures as viewed across time and circumstance. He wrote, Certain conceptual relations that are acquired may be inappropriate within a certain con- text. We term such relations as "misconceptions." A misconception does not exist indepen- dently, but is contingent upon a certain existing conceptual framework. As conceptual frameworks change, what was deemed a misconception may no longer be a misconception; conversely, what is a central conceptual relationship in one framework may be a profound misconception within another framework. The history of science is replete with such exam- ples. (p. 110) Conceptual change. An alternative but complementary position to the examination of cognitive structure is a focus on conditions under which students will choose to modify, reject, or extend their conceptions. Re- searchers in this tradition, often building from the work of Toulmin on the evolution of conceptual systems, argue that concepts are similar to theories and paradigms; the preconceptions will act as a filter for new concepts, and the new concepts must not only be shown to explain or pre- dict the phenomenon, but they must be regarded as providing an accepta- ble solution within the current framework (Confrey, 1980; Johansson, Marton, &amp; Svensson, 1985; Strike &amp; Posner, 1985). Working in the area of Newtonian and Einsteinian physics, Posner, Strike, Hewson, and Gertzog (1982) borrow and refine the Piagetian terms assimilation and accommodation. They use accommodation to de- scribe the times when a student may need to replace or reorganize his or her existing conceptions and argue for the conditions under which this is likely to occur. They require that a student be dissatisfied with an existing</page><page sequence="21">Confrey: Student Conceptions 23 conception and find a new conception intelligible, plausible, and fruitful. They further indicate that accommodation is facilitated when anomalies exist within their current belief system; when analogies and metaphors as- sist the student in accepting a new conception and make it more intelligi- ble; and when their epistemological, metaphysical, and other beliefs support such a change. Hewson (1981) elaborates on this position by dis- cussing how conceptions can be in competition with each other and how, in such cases of conflict, a student will raise or lower the status of one con- ception relative to another. Formal versus informal knowledge. The importance of examining not only what is taught in schools but also how it is taught can be demon- strated by research on informal learning contexts. Ginsburg (1977), in Children's Arithmetic, wrote specifically of the differences: "One of the most significant difficulties in children's arithmetic is the gap between in- formal and formal knowledge. The phenomenon is widespread: many children have trouble with written work but can cope with the same kind of problem in an informal manner" (pp. 179-180). Ginsburg reminds us of the importance of reducing the gap between formal knowledge, "seen as a meaningless game," and informal arithmetic, which "has already proved of some utility" (p. 181). Champagne et al. (1985) explicitly discuss this gap, specifying potential sources of imprecision in students' interpretation of propositions. These include the presence of informal meanings for technical terms, errors in determining the scale of measurement (either as inappropriately large or small), and attempts to formulate general rules for concepts (e.g., motion) from their experience. The terms informal and formal need to be analyzed into their compo- nents and possible referents. To date, the following interpretations of the distinctions seem plausible, and often their use does not distinguish among them: 1. Formal refers to that which is taught in an organized, structured ed- ucational institution where certain constraints and conditions operate that differ from outside life; informal is that which is not taught in such an institution. 2. Formal refers to a system of interrelated definitions and proofs, ex- periments and arguments; informal refers to more tentative intuitive conjectures. 3. Formal refers to written methods; informal refers to mental strategies. 4. Formal refers to the abstraction of a procedure from its context, where the procedure is specified and justified independently; informal re- fers to routines that are carried out mechanically, by habit or tradition, to complete an activity required on a daily basis.</page><page sequence="22">24 Review of Research in Education, 16 5. Formal refers to knowledge one accepts as legitimate because it has been demonstrated by experts; informal refers to knowledge one has gen- erated or learned through one's personal actions. The appeal of the formal/informal distinction in researching students' conceptions is great; it captures an expression frequently uttered by stu- dents in which they distinguish between what is required or expected in school and what is required or expected in daily life apart from school. However, if one accepts the first definition, then any distinction attrib- uted to the formal and informal cannot be altered by institutionalized schooling. This is a conclusion most researchers would be reluctant to draw. Two areas of research in which the contrast between formal and infor- mal knowledge is great are in biology and statistics. In biology, we find nu- merous examples of beliefs of young children that can be attributed to their egocentric view of the world and are charmingly reminiscent of the myths of other cultures. In a review of research on student conceptions in biology, Mintzes and Arnaudin (1984) present findings on children's ani- mistic concepts of life; their portrayal of death as temporary and personi- fied; their restrictions of categories of plant and animal; their versions of anatomy and physiology; and their views of reproduction, genetics, evolu- tion, and growth. Many of these demonstrate explicitly that in spite of formal instruction, these informal ideas persist. Knowledge of statistics is frequently populated by a mixture of intui- tion and formal procedures. Most students demonstrate an intuitive un- derstanding of a mean, but when circumstances call for a weighted mean, over half continue to rely on the simple mean (Pollatsek, Lima, &amp; Well 1981). Demonstrating the parochial character of informal knowledge (perhaps another version of egocentricity), Tversky and Kahneman (1971) found that many students believe that a small sample will be repre- sentative of a large sample. They have named this (incorrect) belief the "Law of Small Numbers," in contrast with the (correct) "Law of Large Numbers." The belief that small samples are representative leads stu- dents to predict that, in a population of equal numbers of boys and girls, a birth order of BGBGBG is more likely than BGBBBB with an n of six (Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1972). Sense data versus theory. Science educators are particularly interested in how students relate their sensorial experiences to their formal knowl- edge. Many researchers have documented the isolation between these forms of knowledge. Other studies have suggested that misconceptions re- sult from the lack of isomorphism between students' theoretical perspec- tive and sensory inputs originating in the real world. The work of Nussbaum and Novak (1976) shows how the connection between theory and sensory input is not simply keen observation. In astronomy, they doc-</page><page sequence="23">Confrey: Student Conceptions 25 umented children's views of the earth and identified an egocentric view in which the children predicted that, because objects drop down on their side of the earth, they must drop "down" (which they described as "away from the earth") on the opposite side of the earth as well. Another belief they documented was that the earth is flat like a pancake. The complexity of the relationship between theory and data is illus- trated in the review article by Driver and Erickson (1983). They com- mence with a quote from Einstein and Infeld and then state their position on this relationship: Science is not just a collection of laws, a catalogue of unrelated facts. It is a creation of the human mind, with its freely invented ideas and concepts. Physical theories try to form a picture of reality and to establish its connection with the wide world of sense impressions. (Einstein &amp; Infeld, 1938, p. 294) A fundamental distinction can be made in science or in any field of empirical enquiry be- tween two general kinds of activities. On the one hand there is the cataloguing of sense im- pressions, the experience of the phenomena; on the other there are our attempts as humans to impose some regularity on experience by creating our models or theoretical entities. (p. 37) As a result of the assumption of this dichotomy, the authors propose the following definition of a conceptual framework: "By the construct 'con- ceptual framework,' we shall mean the mental organization imposed by an individual on sensory inputs as indicated by regularities in an individ- ual's responses to particular problem settings" (p. 39). This passage captures one of the most interesting issues within the mis- conceptions tradition in science education: the relationship between on- tological claims (claims about reality) and epistemological claims (claims about knowledge). In the passage, the term sense impressions is used first in the Einstein quote and then by Driver and Erickson. In their defini- tion, they shift to the use of sensory inputs. Inputs, a mechanical, computer-based metaphor, often is assumed to imply that an external world imposes certain signals on individuals; these are chaotic and can be interpretable by the individual only through the means of mental organization. Thus it appears that the authors differentiate sensory inputs as originating externally, and mental organization as personally constructed. If this characterization is correct, then Driver and Erickson might con- clude that somehow one can assess the accuracy of students' mental orga- nizations (internal) in relation to these sensory inputs (external). The assertion that one can assess the accuracy of an internal representation in relation to an external stimulus has been criticized since the time of the skeptics, because any such assessment would necessarily be another inter-</page><page sequence="24">26 Review of Research in Education, 16 nal act of comparison and would fail to overcome the internal/external gap (von Glasersfeld, 1984a). Another, more obvious, example of such a distinction was stated by Fisher and Lipson (1983), who write, "We are more or less constantly engaged in assessing the 'goodness of fit' between our mental models and the world around us" (p. 1). The passage from Driver and Erickson (1983) is ambiguous and there- fore allows an alternative interpretation, wherein sensory impressions and conceptual frameworks would both be firmly placed within the indi- vidual (albeit influenced by social and cultural forces). Hence impres- sions are not regarded as external signals, but internal experiences of them. Then the relationships one wishes to examine are the interactions and relationships between perceptions (organized frameworks of sensa- tions) and other conceptual tools (language, symbols, and theories). Thus, the issue of ontology (what is reality?) is minimized, and the relationship among systems of knowledge (of which sensory impressions is simply one of many) is emphasized. Pines (1985) seems to take this position: Sensation-the raw data from the sense organs-on its own, without perceptual organiza- tion, is devoid of meaning. Organized sensation-namely, perception-enables the aware- ness and mental recording of objects and events. In human beings, such perception is facilitated by language-words or sentences, and thus experience is conceptually and propositionally punctuated into meaningful distinctions, relations, and complexes of such relations that transform "raw sensation" into perception. (p. 103) If we take the position that knowledge consists of a coordination of in- ternal representations, rather than as a more and more accurate portrayal of "the way things really are," then one is left with one more issue in the definition of conceptual frameworks offered by Driver and Easley (1978). They refer to conceptual frameworks as mental organization, as indicated by regularities in an individual's responses to a particular problem set- ting. What is left unanswered is the question, Whose perception of regu- larities are they referring to? If the answer is an observer's perception of regularities, then a conceptual framework is not necessarily the individual student's own ways of organizing experience, but the observer's model of the student's responses. If the model refers to the observer's own frame- work, then we are left with the possibility that a conceptual framework may be invisible to, or inapplicable for, the student operating within it. The answer to the question, Who is the observer?, is perhaps not as im- portant as the recognition that a phrase such as "regularities in responses" implies a hidden observer who needs identification. Nonetheless, it is clear that in science one must give careful attention to the role of sense impressions. Students often consider sensory impressions as noncontroversial, given, objective, dependable, and the bedrock on</page><page sequence="25">Confrey: Student Conceptions 27 which theories are inductively inferred. The phrase "to make sense of it" is evidence of the security provided to us by translating abstract phenom- ena into sensory forms. The chicken and the egg relationship between conceptual frameworks and selected and recorded evidence is a serious epistemological issue, which, as this research makes evident, must be ex- plicitly included in our science curricula. Language. The role of language in the construction and maintenance of misconceptions has received considerable attention in misconceptions research in science education. Some researchers have focused specifically on defining and labeling concepts in relation to the structure of a disci- pline (Ashlock, 1987). In this case, the naming of a significant set of rela- tionships indicates its value within the discipline. Pines (1985) described the important function of language: "A word is like a conceptual handle, enabling one to hold on to the concept and manipulate it" (p. 108). Other work has been devoted to describing the relationships between the use of scientific terms (e.g., force, energy, heat) in daily life and the precise definitions these terms have within their discipline. Solomon (1983) expressed this relationship well: Meanings which are in daily use cannot be obliterated by science lessons, however convinc- ingly presented. Even when the concepts and theories of science have been learnt, the older meanings, and loose explications of the life-world, will still linger on.... This implies that our students will acquire, through their instruction in science, a second domain of knowl- edge which is radically different from the first but coexistent with it. Under these circum- stances we shall want to know if they are aware of these two competing sets of meanings and, more importantly, how they decide which one to use during problem-solving exercises. (p. 129, emphasis in original) Within this tradition it is frequently emphasized that the role of lan- guage in the construction of understanding extends beyond labeling and communication of propositional knowledge into the social construction of knowledge (Skemp, 1971; Vygotsky, 1978). Scientific language is exam- ined in the larger cultural and social context (also described by Wittgenstein as "language games") in which scientific meanings are es- tablished (Confrey, 1981; Head &amp; Sutton, 1985). Sutton (1980) distinguished denotative meanings in science (rigorous definitions) from connotative meanings in everyday experience (a frame- work of associations and implications). He suggested that science often proceeds by redefining and making precise everyday terms, and that sci- entific terms are also incorporated into a culture through metaphoric ex- tensions of their meanings. Hewson (1985) provided an example of such cultural-scientific mingling in her study of the conceptions of heat held by the Sotho group in southern Africa. Other studies indicate a confusion among the terms heat, cold, and temperature.

Analogy. More recently, researchers in science education have concen- trated not only on students' formal ways of tackling difficult problems, but on students' use of informal but powerful analogies and models in their attempts to understand scientific conceptual systems (Gentner, 1980; Norman &amp; Rumelhart, 1975). These analogies can both promote and hinder conceptual development as witnessed in the use of analogies such as flow in electrical circuits. Clement (198 1) explored the analogical relations that doctoral students and professors in technical fields invoked in trying to solve a problem concerning the stretch of a spring. He found that "spontaneous analogies have been observed to play a significant role in the solutions ofa number ofscientifically trained subjects" (p. 1, emphasis in original). In addition to documenting the use of analogy, he also ex- plored the processes of generating and extending analogies. Clement (1987) studied 59 analogies generated by 16 freshman engi- neering majors in 24 problem-solving episodes. Half of these episodes were anthropomorphic, referring to their own body actions. Many were erroneous from the perspective of expert physicists. Occasionally, the stu- dents generated a sequence of analogies or formed a generalization based on an analogy, and used these occasions to suggest that analogies are an effective source of conceptual change. From this, Clement concluded that students are able to exhibit creative solution strategies of an analogical form, which encourages conceptual change. Historical perspectives. Researchers in this tradition have often found the historical development of a concept to be a rich source for (a) describ- ing potential misconceptions, (b) demonstrating at least one developmen- tal sequence that leads to the current concepts, and (c) providing a variety of problems that provoke consideration of alternative frameworks (Clement, 1983; Lybeck, 1985; Lybeck, Stromdahl, &amp; Tullberg, 1985; Marton, 1978). Research on the history of the concept under consideration provides access to the milieu that often assisted people in that field in the develop- ment of the concept. For example, Confrey (1980) examined the history of the calculus and suggested seven different conceptions of number that mathematicians held. She documented that, according to Boyer (1949), it was the combination of (a) the outstanding problem in the sciences to de- scribe growth and change, (b) the reimportation of algebra from the Mid- dle East, and (c) the awkwardness of the theory of ratios, which created a setting in which the fundamental concepts of calculus were developed. In examining this history, it became apparent that most students were being introduced to calculus without an understanding that the application of discrete methods to continuous quantities led to disturbing paradoxes.</page><page sequence="27">Confrey: Student Conceptions 29 Without this understanding, students were baffled and therefore resistant to the complexities of limits. Epistemology. These researchers have debated three levels of epistemo- logical questions: (a) the epistemological underpinnings of each discipline (e.g., physics, biology), (b) the epistemological basis that guides students as they learn science, and (c) the epistemological basis for the conduct of research on misconceptions. Disciplinary epistemology is characterized by a rejection of empiricist/ positivist traditions in which science is conceived of as inductive genera- lizations of observations. Building from current work in the philosophy of science (Lakatos, 1976; Lakatos &amp; Musgrave, 1970; Toulmin, 1972), sci- ence is characterized as theory-laden throughout, from its observations to its theories. The progress of scientific theories is explained in terms of meta-level considerations such as parsimony, elegance, explanatory power, and increasing acceptance by scientists. It is emphasized that the development of scientific ideas will not necessarily parallel the proof. Misconceptions research suggests that, educationally, the development of ideas may be fertile ground for providing educational researchers with in- sights into the nature of learning. (See Strike &amp; Posner, 1985, for an excel- lent discussion of empiricist commitments.) Much of this work has been the basis for the development of constructivist theories of knowledge in science, and such a reexamination of researchers' own conceptions of science and mathematics must precede any examination of students' conceptions. In epistemology ofstudents, the implications of"the child as scientist" that result from such a reconceptualization have been highly endorsed by the community (Osborne &amp; Freyberg, 1985). Building from the work of Kelly, a constructivist, Gilbert, Watts, and Osborne have promoted the view that what needs to be investigated is "children's science," as opposed to "adult science." The emphasis here is on the hypothesis that a child may not be "seeing" the same set of events as a teacher, researcher, or ex- pert. It suggests that many times a child's response is labeled erroneous too quickly and that if one were to imagine how the child was making sense of the situation, then one would find the errors to be reasoned and supportable. In more recent work, researchers have not only documented that stu- dents are acting reasonably, but they have begun to describe the basis for students' epistemological beliefs. In mathematics, Confrey (1980) argued that students see mathematics as external, unchanging, and noncontro- versial. Schoenfeld (1985) suggested that students are "naive empiricists" and that formal procedures often are not used in problem-solving circum- stances requiring discovery rather than proof. DiSessa (1983) hypothe- sized the existence of phenomenological primitives, which compete in</page><page sequence="28">30 Review of Research in Education, 16 problematic situations and create a significant fragmentation in what stu- dents know. In a fascinating review of the research on probability, Hawkins and Kapadia (1984) describe four conceptions of probability: a priori, frequentist, subjective and intuitive, and formal. The authors explicitly reject the view that only formal probability can be legitimately taught, and argue instead that "subjective probability is an area which is often ne- glected in classroom-oriented research, although it may be a fundamental precursor for the formal probability taught in schools" (p. 350). They crit- icize the research of Piaget and Inhelder (1975) for its formalist stan- dards, preferring instead the work of Fischbein (1975), with its emphasis on social mediation. In an interesting application of disciplinary episte- mology, they apply the idea of standard error to the idea of misconcep- tions and argue that perhaps researchers should seek precision (the lessening of inconsistency in student responses over time) rather than ac- curacy (the convergence of student concepts with expert opinion). Science educators have taught students to consider epistemological is- sues through techniques such as the application of Gowin's Vee (Gowin, 1987), as they struggle with the question of how to overcome the oversim- plification of philosophy of science implied by "the scientific method." Gowin uses vee diagrams to map events by showing the two components (conceptual and methodological) that are linked to the focal event (hence the vee). Together with Novak's conceptual maps, these tools aid students in learning and provide teachers with alternatives to the dominant modes of evaluation of learning that currently exist. In research epistemology, examining the epistemologies underlying the content and the student methods led to vigorous debates about the con- duct and claims of the research itself. This debate was manifested in part in the discussions on what terminology to use for misconceptions, alter- native conceptions, or child science (Abimbola, 1988) and on how struc- tured the interviews needed to be (Steffe &amp; Cobb, 1983). Some argued that the conceptual change approach was in conflict with the Piagetian stages (Gilbert &amp; Watts, 1983), and others argued that it was compatible (Steffe, 1988). Metacognition. Within the science and math education community, some have emphasized the metacognitive elements of knowing. Research- ers have been concerned not only with a student's beliefs, but with the stu- dent's awareness of that belief system. Captured succinctly by Novak and Gowin's phrase, Learning How To Learn (1984), the research in this area often documents how difficult it is for students to describe their beliefs, their methods, or their processes for solving problems. Whimbey and Lochhead (1984) developed methods to increase students' awareness of their own knowledge in their methods of paired-problem solving.</page><page sequence="29">Confrey: Student Conceptions 31 Multiple representations. Researchers have become increasingly aware that many of the students' misconceptions have evolved from the narrow- ness of their means of representing phenomena. For example, in repre- senting real world phenomena, students often rely solely on representing functions as a graph, a table, or an algebraic equation, with little facility in moving among these representations or in seeking convergence in meaning. One misconception that results from this occurs when students assume that a graph of position (y) and time (x) is identical to the physical path of an object (McDermott et al., 1983; Schuster, 1981). With the de- velopment of effective computer technology, researchers emphasized that students can access graphical portrayals rapidly; these graphs can then be manipulated dynamically (Dugdale, 1986-1987) or connected to mea- surement tools (Barclay, 1986). Others advocate skepticism, indicating that these representations, like any others, need interpretation and cannot be assumed to be viewed in the ways intended by designers (Goldenberg, 1987). Regardless of the apparent complexities of multiple representa- tions, its advocates in physics (DiSessa &amp; Wiser, 1987), statistics (Rubin, Rosebery, &amp; Bruce, 1988), and mathematics (Confrey &amp; Smith, 1988; Kaput, 1986) see this as the basis for deeper conceptualizations. Cultural and social dimensions. A small segment of this literature is concerned explicitly with the cultural and social dimensions of miscon- ceptions. As reported earlier, Hewson (1985) explored the conceptions of heat held by natives of Sotha and found interesting relationships between their cultural and cognitive beliefs and those of formal science. In another study (Hewson, 1986), she found relationships between cognition and ethnography in examining tasks on floating and sinking. Ogunniyi (1987) researched the interaction between the traditional and scientific view of cosmology and also showed interactions between traditional culture and scientific instruction. In other cross-cultural work, researchers have stud- ied the use of arithmetic and measurement in Third World workplaces and found significant discrepancies between the formal and informal performances of the workers (Carraher, Carraher, &amp; Schliemann, 1985; Lave, 1977). This research challenges the Western tradition of assuming that cogni- tion can be examined relatively independently of culture, and it has gained widespread interest in the alternative conceptions community due to its immediate implications for the informal and formal aspects of schooling. The extent to which it will actually encourage researchers and curriculum designers to reconceptualize the legitimacy of relying solely on formal scientific or mathematical approaches to their disciplines will be evident as the interest in this research area increases.</page><page sequence="30">32 Review of Research in Education, 16 Summary Alternative conceptions research has documented students' beliefs in- dicating that they enter instruction with conceptual configurations that are culturally embedded; are tied into the use of language; are connected to other concepts; have historical precursors; and are embedded in a cycle of expectation, prediction, and confirmation or rejection. For students as for scientists, it appears that the course of learning is not a simple process of accretion, but involves progressive consideration of alternative per- spectives and the resolution of anomalies. The philosophy of science pro- vides a rich resource for these investigations. Studies on Systematic Errors: Research in the Information-Processing Tradition The third framework for research on student conceptions has a long his- tory in errors research. This research has connections with behaviorism in the United States, although in Germany the connections are closer to Ge- stalt theory, and in the Soviet Union to curriculum revision (Radatz, 1979). The emphasis in this area is on errors in procedural knowledge and, as a result, the approach is dominant in the area of mathematics and programming. The selection of procedural knowledge as the focus leads the researchers to select topics in which calculations or production of pro- grams is constrained by the rules of the system, to select information- processing models of cognition, and to employ large-scale diagnostic tests. Procedural misconceptions in mathematics. Radatz proposes a categori- zation of errors and relates them to an information-processing approach. He wrote, "Various causes of errors that cut across mathematical content topics can be identified by examining the mechanisms used in obtaining, processing, retaining and reproducing the information in mathematical tasks" (p. 164). The categories he identifies include (a) errors due to pro- cessing iconic representations; (b) errors due to deficient mastery of pre- requisite skills, facts, and concepts; (c) errors due to incorrect associations or rigidity of thinking leading to inadequate flexibility in decoding and encoding new information and the inhibition of processing new informa- tion; and (d) errors due to the application of irrelevant rules or strategies. Newman (1977) developed an alternative classification of errors, re- viewed and reported in Clements (1980). Newman suggested that errors occur in the interaction between the question and the person attempting it and that, in the process of problem solving, the sources of errors include (in order from lower or earlier stages to higher or later ones) reading, com- prehension, transformation (selection of appropriate model), process, and encoding. Other general sources include carelessness and motivation.</page><page sequence="31">Confrey: Student Conceptions 33 In testing and developing this hierarchical framework, Clements reports that Newman found 47% of her population of low-achievers (grade 6) made errors prior to the process stage (of which 12% were at the transfor- mation stage). Clements found in an average fifth, sixth, and seventh grade group, fewer errors were made at the two lower levels; one-quarter of the errors were at the transformation stage. Clements interprets this data to emphasize that failure in the early stages of problem solving can lead to selection of incorrect processes later. Errors are like misconceptions in that they result from nonrandom ap- plications of rules based on certain beliefs. They are unlike misconcep- tions (as defined in the previous framework) in that they typically are not well-connected into a theoretical position, or the theoretical connections lack articulation by the researcher. For example, when a student cancels the x in the algebraic expression (x + 3)/ (x + 5) to get 3/5, it is described as an error. Systematic errors are defined as errorful rules that produce a pattern of incorrect responses. However, many researchers in the information-processing tradition use the terms error and misconception interchangeably. For example, Nesher (1987) uses misconceptions to mean these systematic errors and describes them as "a line of thinking that causes a series of errors all resulting from an incorrect underlying premise, rather than sporadic, unconnected and non-systematic errors" (p. 35). In the widely known work on Buggy undertaken by Brown and VanLehn (1980), the terminology of slips, systematic errors, and bugs is introduced. In a 1982 paper, VanLehn offers definitions of each: A slip is an "unintentional, careless mistake in that a little extra care apparently makes them disappear" (p. 6); a systematic error is "a testable prediction about what new problems a student will get wrong" (p. 6); and a bug is de- fined as follows: Once we look beyond what kinds of exercises the student misses and look at the actual an- swers given, we find in many cases that these answers can be precisely predicted by comput- ing the answers to the given problems using a procedure which is a small perturbation in the fine structure of the correct procedure. Such perturbations serve as a precise description of the errors. We call them "bugs." (p. 7) In this same article, VanLehn continues to explain how the bugs are used within a larger framework, which he calls "Repair Theory." VanLehn wrote, Repair Theory is based on the insight that when a student gets stuck while executing his pos- sibly incomplete subtraction procedure, he is unlikely to just quit as a computer does when it can't execute the next step in a procedure. Instead the student will do a small amount of problem solving, just enough to get "unstuck" and complete the subtraction problem. The</page><page sequence="32">34 Review of Research in Education, 16 local problem solving strategies are called "repairs" despite the fact that they rarely succeed in rectifying the broken procedure[;] ... they result in a buggy solution. (p. 9) Buggy is exemplary of the early work on systematic errors in that its treatment of errors relies heavily on inductive reasoning. Errors are col- lected and categorized according to their procedural similarities. The choice of procedurally based categories (as opposed to other features of subtraction, for example, its ties to addition, its roots in human activity, its connections to informal language such as "take away") constitutes a key decision by researchers regarding their approach to the study of sub- traction. Subtraction becomes identified with the rule for carrying out the procedure. This reliance on a procedural, rule-governed view of mathe- matical knowledge is somewhat characteristic of the work in this frame- work and, in the case of Buggy, the authors are surprisingly candid about their decisions: The initial task chosen for investigation is ordinary multidigit subtraction. Its main advan- tage, from a psychological point of view, is that it is a virtually meaningless procedure. Most elementary school students have only a dim conception of the underlying semantics of sub- traction, which are rooted in the base ten representation of numbers. When compared to the procedures they use to operate vending machines or play games, subtraction is as dry, formal and disconnected from everyday interests as the nonsense syllables used in early psychologi- cal investigations were different from real words. This isolation is the bane of teachers but a boon to the psychologist. It allows one to study a skill without bringing in a world's worth of associations. (VanLehn, 1983, p. 201) Other work on systematic errors shares the characteristics of a strong reliance on procedural competence as a claim for knowledge. Three fac- tors may account for this: 1. The topics of study in this area are often ones in which calculation (Resnick et al., 1989) or symbolic manipulation (Davis, 1980; Matz, 1979) is at issue, and these topics are frequently treated procedurally- not only as individually rule governed, but as constrained within a system of interdependent rules. Thus, epistemologically, validity relies heavily on consistency. 2. By selecting the information-processing paradigm as the guiding metaphor, the researchers tend to speak of knowledge as bits of informa- tion and of the mind as a processor of programs (procedures), wherein the issue is typically one of how that information is stored, processed, or re- trieved (Cobb, 1987; Fisher et al., 1983). 3. This research typically employs methods of large-scale diagnostic testing followed by clinical interviews to aid in interpretation. Improving diagnostic tools frequently is an explicit goal of the work. Work by Davis (1980) on the concept of frames illustrates the tie be-</page><page sequence="33">Confrey: Student Conceptions 35 tween the procedural focus and the information-processing metaphor. He distinguishes two kinds of mathematical ideas: "thought processes that are essentially sequential and consist of 'more primitive' steps" (p. 169), and frames, "a specific information-representation structure that a person can build up in his or her memory and can subsequently retrieve from mem- ory when it is needed" (p. 170). After giving some examples of frames, in- cluding the Buggy work, the work of Matz (1979) in algebra, and the "students and professors" work (Clement, 1982; Kaput &amp; Sims-Knight, 1983; Rosnick &amp; Clement, 1980), he offers a set of characteristics of frames. Some of these are as follows: "* They serve as "assimilation schemas" for organizing input data. "* Their inner workings are revealed by the errors they produce. "* They were "correct" in a more limited setting. "* They demand certain input information and will not function correctly unless all of this input information is provided. "* They are persistent. "* Their creation and operation follow orderly rules. "* Their retrieval may be cued by brief, explicit, specific cues. In their report entitled, "The Conceptualization of Mathematics Learning as a Foundation of Improved Measurement," Davis and McKnight (1979) offered the most elaborate example of using a proce- dural, information-processing approach to systematic errors. In this work, explicitly concerned with devising diagnostic measurement tools more sophisticated than simple counts of correct and incorrect answers, the authors propose a structure for algebraic understanding that includes procedures, sub- and super-procedures, visually moderated sequences, in- tegrated sequence, frames, assimilation, heuristics, and metalanguage. Dissatisfaction with an overreliance on procedural knowledge has more recently encouraged systematic error researchers to seek a more concep- tual basis for errors. As Resnick et al. (1989) expressed in their research on decimal fractions, researchers are attempting to extend the work of "buggy algorithms" (which they characterize as lacking reference to con- ceptual content or meaning) to investigate whether children's efforts to make conceptual sense of new mathematics instruc- tion in terms of their already available knowledge may sometimes lead them to make sys- tematic errors. In particular, we explore the possibility that children overgeneralize concepts from a familiar domain of mathematics in order to interpret a new domain. (p. 9) Building from the rules that Sackur-Grisvard and Leonard (1985) found in fourth and fifth grade French classes, Resnick et al. attempted to explain the rules in terms of previous knowledge and overgeneralization.</page><page sequence="34">36 Review of Research in Education, 16 Sackur-Grisvard and Leonard suggested that students' tendency to pre- dict that the number with the most decimal places is larger (found in 25 to 40% of fourth and fifth graders) was connected with students' correct be- lief that the more places a whole number has, the larger it is; they called this a "whole number influence." They further predicted that the rule that "the more decimal places, the smaller the number" (found in &lt;6% of fourth and fifth graders) was due to the (correct) belief that, because tenths &gt; hundredths &gt; thousandths, and so on, the value of the decimal decreases with increasing length. Finally, some children (incorrectly) pre- dicted that the whole number rule applies except when there are zeros to the right of the decimal point (i.e., 3.02), and that these numbers are nec- essarily the smallest, depending on how many zeros there are. Resnick et al. predicted that an inadequate whole number place value concept gener- ated this error. This more conceptual work, as contrasted to approaches that generate only an inductive generalization or rule for prediction, actually attempts to specify the relationship between the rule and other mathematical ideas. Researchers can construct measurement items that validate their predic- tions, and the explanatory potential of this approach exceeds that of pre- vious work. Resnick et al.'s conclusions exhibit similarities to the work on student conceptions in science education, in that these researchers see er- rors as a necessary part of instructional process. They concluded, Errorful rules, on this view, are intrinsic to all learning-at least as a temporary phenomenon-because they are the natural result of children's efforts to interpret what they are told and to go beyond the cases actually presented. Several analyses . .. have shown that these errorful rules are intelligent constructions based on what is more often incomplete than incorrect knowledge. Errorful rules ... are best regarded as useful diagnostic tools for instructors, who can often use the children's systematic errors to detect the nature of chil- dren's understanding of a mathematical topic ... [and to document] errors and the concep- tual understanding that underlies them. (p. 26) Systematic error researchers such as Resnick et al. have advanced be- yond inductive empiricism in that they express their concern for under- standing that is deeper than procedural. They do not, however, expressly define what they mean by conceptual understanding. In this particular work, it appears that conceptual sense means relating an idea to previous knowledge. However, it can be argued that the previous knowledge they select is itself procedural knowledge-knowledge of how fractions and whole numbers behave. Is there any other way of understanding decimals than as symbolic representations? Labinowicz (1989), operating in the Piagetian framework of genetic epistemology, examined how students come to understand place value in general first and then are able to apply it to decimals.</page><page sequence="35">Confrey: Student Conceptions 37 An interesting quality of research on systematic errors is that it contin- ues to evolve toward the other two frameworks, but is inhibited in doing so by its epistemological naivete. An example is Nesher's concept of a "Learning System" (Nesher, 1987). Building on the work of Popper on refutation, Nesher makes a strong case for the importance of errors as a source of insight for students. She claims, "We need our beacons in the form of errors, that mark for us the constraints and limitations of our knowledge" (p. 37). The question that continually remains unexamined is the one that creates the need for a model of learning-an essential inade- quacy in this work. The question again is, erroneous from whose perspec- tive? In the systematic errors work, the errors are seen from the perspective of the expert. How is the student to come to recognize these as "erroneous"? In fact, this is exactly the question that caused philosophers of science to reject Popper's position; students cannot see their solution as erroneous until they have constructed a new problem and a new solution. Doing this usually means revising their previous belief so that number of digits is not the defining characteristic of magnitude, but a combination of place and value is the determinant. It is these changes that Piaget sug- gests occur through reflective abstraction and accommodation, and that philosophers of science explain through an evolutionary or revolutionary combination of sociological and psychological juggling of methodologi- cal, epistemological, linguistic, and other complex forms. Nesher's (1987) solution is to propose a Learning System with two components: knowledge and exemplification. Knowledge is "an articula- tion of the unit of knowledge to be taught based upon expert knowledge" (p. 37); exemplification is "an illustrative domain, homomorphic to the knowledge component" (p. 37), but intuitively familiar. She writes, "The selection of the exemplification component should ensure that the rela- tions and the operations among the objects be amenable to complete cor- respondence with the knowledge component to be taught" (p. 38). Her example is to use the folding of a piece of paper and pin pricking of the outline of a figure as an exemplification component for the knowledge component of reflection of a figure on a plane about a given axis. The elegance of her proposal lies in her acknowledgement of a child's need for quick, convincing, and familiar feedback. This is reminiscent of the careful design of experiments conducted by Douady (1986) and col- leagues to explore similarity. They created a group project on jigsaw puz- zles in which each member was assigned to enlarge individual pieces and then test their solutions by "refitting" the pieces. The researchers looked for evidence of additive versus multiplicative strategies (Hart, 1988) and for particular transformations that appeared easier or harder. Success or failure was determined by the group. What remains unaddressed in this framework is the question of what</page><page sequence="36">38 Review of Research in Education, 16 makes a mathematician or scientist claim that one system is homomor- phic with another. In Nesher's example of an exemplification system, the child was asked to predict the location of a stick figure after reflection about a given axis. Then the student was to fold the paper and create a copy of the figure with pinpricks to check his or her results. This activity was labeled "discovery from the child's point of view." Epistemologically, this is a weak form of discovery. The child was as- signed a predictive task and then discovered whether he or she made the "right" prediction. The teacher operationalized reflection as the action of folding. Little is known about whether the child would later confuse trans- lations and reflections, because the framework excluded any other trans- formations. Nor could one ascertain whether the student would recognize reflections as they occurred in mirrors or water. Furthermore, the child did not invent the procedure and thus could have carried out the task without insight. Thus, the situation is declared homomorphic, although to the child the lack of continuity in the lines or the transference of shape (but not color) might lead the child to see the task as isolated or irrelevant. Researchers in the information-processing tradition of systematic er- rors tend to hold the position that mathematical or scientific structures exist independently of the viewer; hence these structures' existence is im- perative and they await discovery. They seldom consider seriously the possibility that another interpretation of the structures is possible and thus that one can view evidence of student errors only as deviations from their own or from the dominant perspective. The question of what it is that will bring a child to see the exemplification as homomorphic is ne- glected in the discussion. Nesher (1987) ultimately turns the authority for truth and correctness over to the mathematician: Clearly the child cannot reach conclusions about the truths of mathematics with such rigor- ous methods as those applied by pure mathematicians. While mathematicians can demon- strate the truth of a given sentence by proving its coherence within the entire mathematical system, young children cannot. (p. 38) Not all work in the systematic error tradition is limited to considering primarily procedural knowledge. Davis and Vinner (1986) describe re- search on students' misconceptions about limits, which proceeds from a different origin. Rejecting the "empty vessel theory," they offer a view of naive conceptualizations as prior knowledge that may conflict with the new ideas the teacher hopes to teach. They indicate their epistemological interest by using situations in which a student may hold two competing ideas and will "retrieve" the erroneous response rather than the new one. They studied this one summer in a lab school by examining students' un- derstanding of the limit of sequences after the students had demonstrated</page><page sequence="37">Confrey: Student Conceptions 39 competence with the material during the school year. They also knew that the original introduction to limits of sequences had been done through in- formal examples, construction of sequences, use of geometric representa- tion, and, finally, formal definition. This work was based on the idea of a concept image, a term used to refer to the configuration of mental pictures of concepts, examples, pictures, applications, and so forth, which enrich and compete with the formal definition. Nonetheless, Davis and Vinner found that significant errors resurfaced, and identified five sources of errors: 1. Language. Limits are bounds, as in speed limits, and are seen as mathematical bounds; hence only monotonic increasing sequences are allowed. 2. Assembling mathematical representations from premathematical fragments. Mathematical ideas have their basis in premathematical expe- riences, which can be confusing. 3. Mathematical ideas are built gradually. A partial representation can overwhelm others. 4. Specific examples can dominate. Monotonic sequences are the most common in instruction. 5. Students misinterpret their own experience. What applies in one case (algebraic transformation) will apply in another. They drew an interesting conclusion from this experience: "It was clear that misconceptions were part of the students' ideas about limits" (p. 301). From the perspective of conceptual change or the Piagetian theo- rists, this conclusion would come as no surprise. In fact, these researchers would see it as an opportunity for further research. Davis and Vinner, however, show evidence of their commitment to the framework of system- atic errors as they added that, if retrieval is the issue, then they needed to focus students' attention on the "crux of the matter" and "to provide a more explicit confrontation between a student's correct ideas and his or her incorrect ideas" (p. 301). Misconceptions in programming. Much of the research on students' conceptions of programming fits within the third framework on system- atic errors in that the errors are described, but learning is not considered to be adaptation. Little attention is given to the students' alternative model, only to their deviation from the approach of experts. Further- more, this literature is easily assimilated into the research on systematic errors in that as the student learns to work with the computer, the re- searchers assume that their mind acts as its own processor, storage, and retrieval system. A significant contrast between the research on programming and the re- search on systematic errors in mathematics is the state of evolution of programming languages and their relative novelty. The mathematics that</page><page sequence="38">40 Review of Research in Education, 16 dominates the school curriculum is relatively uniform and stable. In con- trast, programming has multiple instances of alternative strategies for ac- complishing programming tasks. In studying programming, researchers have the leeway to imagine and even propose changes in the languages to "fit" more appropriately with the users' cognitive tendencies. Soloway, Bonar, and Ehrlich (1983) demonstrate this in a study of Pascal program- ming. They found that most people in the general population prefer to have the computer read a value before processing (the read/process ap- proach), rather than solve a basic averaging problem using a process/read method. They found that most people in the general population get higher performance and fewer errors when they use Pascal-L (which facilitates the read/process approach) than when they use Pascal (which is most compatible with the process/read method). However, experienced pro- grammers appear to be accustomed to the process/read approach, and they demonstrate equally strong performance with either version of Pascal. A second difference between research on programming and systematic errors research is its close ties to problem-solving strategies. Plans and strategies are typically basic constructs in programming investigations. For example, Soloway and Ehrlich (1984) propose that two types of knowledge are basic to expert programming: programming plans and rules of programming discourse. They liken programming plans to the no- tion of a scheme, where a scheme is defined as generic knowledge struc- tures that guide the comprehender's interpretation, inferences, expecta- tions, and attention. This use of schema is similar to that of Davis's frames. They found that expert programmers do rely on these plans, and their performance drops dramatically when the assumptions typical of plans or rules of discourse were violated. In a review of the research on programming bugs, Pea et al. (1987) de- scribe three types of bugs: programming language-independent concep- tual bugs, knowledge unavailability bugs, and knowledge retrieval bugs. The transition to formal programming also requires recognition of the limitations of the computer, which students often have difficulties accept- ing. Evidence is provided that students tend (a) to lack precision in their instructions; (b) to expect the computer to carry out commands concur- rently rather than sequentially; and (c) to attribute intentionality to the computer or assume that it will respond to their egocentric but inexplicit intentions. These last three bugs are subsumed under the "superbug," wherein a student imagines that an intelligent and interpretive mind re- sides in the computer. Hancock, Perkins, and Simmons (n.d.) report on a study of children's programming difficulties in learning Logo (ages 8-12) and Basic (ages 10- 16). They found that the students (a) often avoided challenging questions</page><page sequence="39">Confrey: Student Conceptions 41 by declining to accept the problem; (b) exhibited a slippage in their goals when their programs produced unintended results; (c) were bounded by their templates for subroutines; (d) had difficulties transferring if there were even minimal changes in context; (e) could not effectively employ hand-executed methods of checking; and (f) could not monitor the flow of control or use primitives. Interestingly enough, these difficulties led to their introduction of critical components of the programming process: goal formation, planning, coding, checking, testing, diagnosing, and re- pairing. Like the work on systematic errors, the literature on program- ming misconceptions does not typically specify a model for learning. However, in certain ways, these critical components suggest a potential view of learning as problem solving. Perkins and Simmons (1988) offer a comprehensive treatment of mis- conceptions under the framework of systematic errors. They identify four levels (or frames) of knowledge and suggest that "misunderstandings can in part be explained by a shallow repertoire in the noncontent frames and that appropriately designed education can do much to foster understand- ing by addressing all the frames and their interactions" (p. 306). The four levels are "* The content frame: the facts, definitions, and algorithms along with the metacognitive facility for monitoring their use. "* The problem-solving frame: the domain specific and general problem- solving strategies, beliefs, and autoregulative processes. "* The epistemic frame: domain specific and general validation strategies, explanations, and evidence. "* The inquiry frame: domain specific and general strategies for challeng- ing, critiquing, and extending work. Using these four levels, Perkins and Simmons describe how three pat- terns of misunderstandings might occur. They suggest naive concepts might result from lack of content knowledge or from preferring one con- cept over another (rigidity over springiness in describing a table). In addi- tion to the content frame, they describe how the epistemic and the inquiry frame could contribute to the persistence of beliefs. Ritual patterns emerge in students who have a high degree of technical and formal knowl- edge when their formal knowledge exists in isolation from their intuitive knowledge. Their content frame and problem solving appear relatively sophisticated in verbal or formulae-rich areas, but their epistemic and in- quiry frames lack development. Using these frames, the authors also dis- cuss Gordian concepts wherein expert knowledge appears erroneous in hindsight, and where the four frames weave together to conceal the defi- ciencies. In discussing applications of their approach, Perkins and Simmons deny the necessity of a learning theory and argue that a mix of</page><page sequence="40">42 Review of Research in Education, 16 direct instruction, personal discovery, and proceduralization will be suffi- cient to ensure learning, provided teaching involves all four frames. Summary The third framework of this review approaches misconceptions as sys- tematic errors. Like the researchers on misconceptions in science educa- tion, systematic errors researchers see these difficulties as unavoidable and necessary in the development of knowledge. Unlike researchers in the other two traditions, they do not consider them epistemologically legiti- mate, but rather developmentally primitive. Research in this area is largely concerned with diagnosing errors and remedying them through exposure and rejection. No learning theory is seen as necessary to account for these errors, beyond the recognition that the errors represent overgeneralizations on the part of the students. The research on program- ming was categorized within the systematic error framework due to its ties to the information-processing perspective and the tendency of re- searchers in this area to describe error patterns as atheoretical phenom- ena. An exception to this was discussed in the article by Perkins and Simmons, where multiple frames were postulated to account for the misunderstandings. IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING The work on student conceptions is heavily oriented toward examining student learning through methods that take place outside the classroom in interview settings. Although many researchers attempt to relate their studies to classroom processes through observation or examination of materials, the links remain relatively distant and tentative. As Romberg and Carpenter (1986) state, We currently know a great deal more about how children learn mathematics [or science, pro- gramming, probability, statistics] than we know about how to apply this knowledge to math- ematics instruction. Research is clearly needed to explore how knowledge of children's learning of mathematics... can be applied to instruction. The learning research provides a starting point for designing instruction. It also provides extremely powerful tools for evalu- ating the effects of instruction. This may be the most significant implication that current cognitive research ... has for research on instruction. (p. 859) Research on teaching in ways that are informed by the work on student conceptions is increasingly evident. However, the impact of the research on student conceptions on research on teaching will vary depending on the framework in which the work is interpreted. Gilbert and Watts (1983) warn of this:</page><page sequence="41">Confrey: Student Conceptions 43 Work conducted with the classical view of concept will regard misconceptions as simply "wrong." An extreme response might be to merely ignore any evidence of misunderstanding on the part of the student and to "start from scratch" following a tabula rasa view of teaching (see Gilbert, Osborne, &amp; Fensham, 1982). There might be some temptation to merely repeat earlier teaching sequences, perhaps under the illusion that simple repetition or precisely formed phrases are sufficient to engender formal understanding. (p. 83) They go on to suggest that a more appropriate view of concepts might be that of "concept formation," because it leads toward a relational view of concepts. However, they prefer a conceptual development perspective, by which they mean "proposals that accept the existence, and value to their users, of alternative frameworks and seek to educate by the expan- sion of applicability of those frameworks or seek to modify them towards the consensus view of formal science" (p. 83). Within the community of those researching student conceptions, there are increasingly more studies of how one might use the rich database of research to improve instruction. Nussbaum and Novick (1982) designed an instructional strategy for eliciting student conceptions that they hope will lead to cognitive restructuring. They suggest that a teacher should (a) create a situation that requires students to invoke their conceptual frame- works; (b) ask them to describe their framework verbally and pictorially; (c) assist them in stating their ideas clearly, avoiding evaluation; (d) have students debate the pros and cons; and (e) support the most highly generalizable solution. Rowell and Dawson (1979) point out three possible forms of resolution when students have conflicting concepts: One alternative may seem more logical; an analogous situation may make one concept more attractive; or neither alternative may seem appropriate and a new unifying idea is con- structed. Hewson's (1981) analysis of conceptual change indicates that change is relatively difficult to obtain unless one is dissatisfied with his or her present belief and sees an alternative framework as intelligible, plausi- ble, and fruitful. Smith and Lott (1983) conducted research on practicing teachers and found that teaching teachers to teach for conceptual change was indeed difficult. They found that students often were uncertain about which empirical generalizations were important, that communication often involved sources of ambiguity, that framing of essential issues was lacking, and that instruction often addressed the wrong preconception. A number of French researchers use the term didactical theory for their work on classroom instruction (Brousseau, 1986; Vergnaud, 1982). Balacheff (1987) summarized this approach by introducing the epistemo- logical framework of the research, which consisted of hypothesizing that students must actively interpret and make sense of experience, and that problems are the origin of knowledge. Given this, they assume that teach-</page><page sequence="42">44 Review of Research in Education, 16 ing is the process of socializing the students' conceptions, because mathe- matics is a social construction. They conduct research in cooperation with classroom teachers, and they design instructional activities to elicit student conceptions through the formulation of problems, to require stu- dents to act on and validate their constructions, and to lead toward insti- tutionalization of the curriculum through public discourse and resolu- tion. They then study the effectiveness of the materials and methods in this ecologically valid setting. Other instructional strategies include scheme change theory and ide- ational confrontation (Champagne et al., 1983). Both of these approaches require dialectic exchange in the articulation and revision of conceptions. Watts and Gilbert (1983) suggest that three processes seem to be present in successful interventions: "* Explication: performance of a task or concept analysis to lead to the ar- ticulation of a conception. "* Expectation: verbalization of a prediction based on the conception. "* Exploration: testing models and comparing results, given the conceptions. Minstrell (1982) and Pope (1985) state the need for a classroom envi- ronment that invites and encourages open discourse and trust. Minstrell argues for a free-speaking context with encouragement for articulation, a variety of first-hand experiences with objects at all grades, and encour- agement to seek the simplest rational solution. Pope adds the dimension of affect to the discussion, warning that if conceptual change is rushed or forces students to abandon their beliefs prematurely, it may cause anxiety, fear, or threat. She encourages the use of Kelly's Fixed Role Therapy, wherein a person is encouraged to see his or her current constructs as hy- potheses and to express an openness and willingness to change. Pope also recognizes the importance of holding an approach to teacher education that is compatible with the epistemological and psychological assump- tions of student conceptions and reviews work in this framework. The concern expressed earlier by Romberg and Carpenter (1986) must be addressed if we are to create large-scale change in teachers' practices. However, a sweeping statement declaring the absence of research on teaching in these three frameworks ignores the detailed and extensive studies by researchers such as Kamii (1985), Easley (1977), and Duckworth (1987). Though these studies have often involved small num- bers of participants, they provide a rich resource of knowledge on the kinds of intervention necessary to create lasting changes and on the ways teachers can contribute to this process.</page><page sequence="43">Confrey: Student Conceptions 45 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: SUGGESTED DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH The field of student conceptions is healthy and, in Lakatosian terms, represents a progressive research program. A review of the research indi- cates that the field remains vigorous and attractive for researchers and teachers alike. Unlike much educational research, its roots lie in discipli- nary competence. By focusing on particular concepts, researchers have demonstrated that cognitive development needs to be informed by the microgenesis of particular concepts and by constellations of concepts, as well as by broader stage theory and by theories of thinking and learning. Although this review called for more integration of teaching and learning perspectives, it also warned that such a movement must be well informed by exemplary (e.g., interview-based) research on learning. Otherwise, re- searchers risk losing the quality and specificity of their conceptual analy- ses in the complexity of classroom interactions. An overly narrow focus on disciplinary content also has limitations. Researchers exhibit a tendency to read and reference the literature within their field and subfield (e.g., science, chemistry). Therefore their work could benefit from a more careful consideration of cross-disciplinary, cross-field contrasts. One of the most striking aspects of this review is the tendency for researchers to use their disciplinary commitments as a lens for viewing the phenomena of cognitive development itself in a recursive way. Thus researchers of conceptions about programming view the mind as an information-processing machine; educators in biology stress adap- tation and development; physicists and chemists analyze into compo- nents; and those interested in probability view misconceptions as systematic errors. Though these interactions between content and cogni- tion are appropriate if one views the mind as both a lens (as it frames our experience) and as a phenomenon (which is itself an experience), more specific comparisons across disciplines would produce worthwhile cross-fertilization. Cross-fertilization is argued for on the grounds that the different aca- demic disciplines introduce approaches and distinctions in the literature that will promote the long-term viability of the field of conceptions re- search. For instance, there is a value in considering how the issues of plan- ning and goal specification, discussed in the programming literature, and prediction, from the probability literature, might be useful for research in science and mathematics education. The review also suggests the value of careful consideration of the con- trasts and similarities among the three frameworks for research: genetic epistemology, alternative conceptions, and systematic errors. The re- search on systematic errors deserves praise for its immediate relevance to</page><page sequence="44">46 Review of Research in Education, 16 and attractiveness for classroom teachers, but it also needs to reconsider its treatment of learning and its premature assimilation of alternative perspectives to formalist views. This weakness is attributed in part to its failure to consider sociopsychological perspectives and environmental factors. The research on alternative conceptions can be lauded for its attention to the role of everyday experience and language in the development of conceptions and its clear emphasis on exploring students' idiographic methods. In this tradition, as in the others, there is a significant subgroup whose attention to documenting failures and labeling them erroneous be- comes redundant and stifling to the development of the field; as the field matures, more attention to criticism and rigor is warranted. However, the continued vitality of this research seems largely dependent on two factors: the continued exploration of how these conceptions evolve and are af- fected within classroom interactions, and the complementary sense of community developed within this research community. It was also argued that this community could benefit from a more sympathetic and broader reading of the Piagetian literature, particularly on operations and their basis in human action. Taken alone, beliefs have a rather static quality, which often hides their ties to actions and situations. The work on anal- ogy (Clement, 1981, 1987; Clement &amp; Brown, 1984) could be productive in this direction. Finally, researchers in the Piagetian tradition are encouraged to seek the broader perspective evident in the work on systematic errors by an- choring their work in the larger field of literature and by addressing some of the issues identified in the section on alternative conceptions. How- ever, this should not lessen the importance of their detailed consideration of the processes of the child or alter their commitment to reconsidering the parameters of appropriate mathematics or scientific content, which is the strength of this work. In mathematics, more consideration of genuine problems is suggested, so that the definitions of operations extend beyond Piaget's logical operations into the variety of human actions we witness and participate in in the world. The review also suggests a few issues for future examination. In all areas, more attention needs to be paid to the issue of memory and reflec- tive abstraction. Although a "storage container" view of memory has proven useful, it has not explained convincingly why certain conceptions are so persistent and how reconstruction, not retrieval, is undertaken. Differences in the form of memories (theoretical, analogical, iconic, and phenomenological) must be clarified. Work on phenomenology and constitutionalism by Marton (1981) and Marton and Neuman (1988) may prove useful in this area. Second, the contextual quality of tasks can be criticized for its narrow-</page><page sequence="45">Confrey: Student Conceptions 47 ness and its tendency to replicate the formal and detached quality of schooling; this was especially apparent in the work in mathematics, prob- ability, and programming. Modeling real-world phenomena and a stronger use of context are encouraged (see de Lange Jzn, 1987; Rogoff &amp; Lave, 1984; Van Den Brink, 1984). In doing so, I suggest that the view of cognition needs to include more social dimensions (Wertsch, 1985), both in terms of the view of subject matter embedded in the work and in the ex- amination of classrooms. Finally, researchers are encouraged to undertake research on teacher education in a more sophisticated manner, without recreating the imma- ture myopia of early research on misconceptions. It seems contradictory for researchers to expect that the frameworks they have developed for looking at student conceptions will necessarily be sufficient for looking at teachers, and yet this appears to be a common perception. In conducting research on teachers, it is hoped that time documenting failures can be minimized; instead, the emphasis should be on descriptive studies of in- terventions designed for the greatest possibility of success.
