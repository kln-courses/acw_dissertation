Despite limited resources he started collecting: he bought his first African pieces at the marche aux puces (the flea market) and kept abreast of the Paris art world through contacts with the most famous artist-collectors of the time, like Lhote, Giacometti, Picasso, Zadkine, and Epstein. In 1931 Brignoni visited the ethnographic museum in Basel and became acquainted with Oceanic art. At the same time he met the famous ethnographer Paul Wirz, who had just returned from British New Guinea with numerous works of art. Brignoni bought some, and thereby started his Oceanic collection. Later, on ceaseless travels through Europe and especially Germany, he built up an important private collection. For two decades Brignoni has sought a per- manent home for his collection. In 1985 he of- fered it to his hometown of Chiasso, but the authorities, unaware of its value, refused. As coordinator of Lugano's Department of Mu- seums and Culture, I was fortunate to hear of the offer. Lugano received the donation and engaged to build a museum for "primitive art." The complete Brignoni collection will be on display when the new museum opens, some- time in 1987. Paolo Morigi Lugano, Switzerland ART OF THE DAYAK James Willis Gallery, San Francisco May 30-July 7, 1985 This exhibition of sculpture from the Dayak of Kalimantan, Borneo had the subtlety charac- teristic of Romanesque art. Color was nearly absent. Natural shades of gray, black, and white predominated, with touches of tur- quoise and red. Since most objects were kept outdoors the frequent rains washed the sur- faces until the wood turned gray, contrasting with the backdrop of green jungle. Of equal subtlety were the carved forms, restrained and basic in outline. Even when the artists ornamented the surfaces of masks or small bamboo containers with flowing whorls and curlicues, their imagination was controll- ed by ancient design traditions. The one out- standing exception was a ritual staff made from gutta-percha (rubber sap). Depicting St. George slaying several dragons, it seemed Baroque in comparison. Although it roughly imitated European conventions, it retained a vigor all its own. Of the approximately thirty-five pieces in the show, ten were very small amulets, each one a dynamic sculpture. The display also included five tuntun, the familiar wild-pig trap markers. Most of the large carvings, known as hampa- tongs (anthropomorphic sculptures used to commemorate ancestors or protect the villages) were exported from Borneo in the nineteenth century. Cracked and eroded, these heavy hardwood figures had a stately, austere beau- ty; subdued grays and blacks were their only colors. Juxtaposing these large carvings next to the small ones illustrated the wide range of style in Dayak art, while it also emphasized its restrictions in style. To my knowledge this was the first all-Dayak art show in the United States. It was a remark- able achievement for the Willis Gallery to have gathered so many wonderful examples of the rare art of Kalimantan. Gregory Ghent San Francisco ARTE DELL'OCEANIA Museo di Villa Ciani, Lugano March 14-April 20, 1986 The Brignoni collection consists of over 500 pieces of rare beauty and quality that docu- ment the art of New Guinea (Asmat, Maprik, Mimika, and Sepik), New Caledonia, New Ireland, New Hebrides, Borneo, Sumatra, Celebes, Flores, and Timor. Recently 98 of these pieces were shown in the Museo di Villa Ciani in Lugano. Born in Chiasso, Switzerland, in 1903, Serge Brignoni spent his childhood in Bern, where at the age of eight, on a school visit to the His- torical Museum, he encountered "primitive 75</page></plain_text>
