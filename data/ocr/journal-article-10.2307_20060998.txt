<plain_text><page sequence="1">Richard Perkins, Thor the Wind-Raiser and the Eyrarland Image. (Viking Society for Northern Research, Text Series, 15.) London: Viking Society for Northern Research, University College London, 2001. Paper. Pp. xi, 177 plus color frontispiece; 35 black and-white figures. ?12. This book is a remarkable treatise by virtue of the breadth and depth of scholarship that Richard Perkins displays in his investigation of the nature and significance of the small bronze statuette found at Eyrarland, in northern Iceland, at the beginning of the nineteenth century. This helmeted, but otherwise apparently naked, figure is seated on an armless chair; he has a luxuriant moustache and a forked beard, which he clutches with both hands, but below his fists the two parts of the beard reunite to form a crosslike object, with rounded ends, resting on his knees. The Eyrarland image is the single most important antiquity associated today with the Viking-age origins of Iceland, so the question is: what is it? Is it, as many have thought from the time of its discovery, a representation of the pagan god Thor, made about the time of (or soon after) the official conversion of Iceland to Christianity (in 999/1000)? Or is it, more prosaically, an eleventh-century playing piece? the king, maybe, for the board game hneftafl? The latter theory was advanced by the late Kristj?n Eldj?rn, director of the National Museum and subsequently the president of Ice land, in a deliberate attempt to provoke discussion of this iconic object. His interpretation was the one I propagated when the image was displayed on both sides of the Atlantic, during 1980/81, as part of The Vikings exhibition (J. Graham-Campbell, Viking Artefacts [London, 1980], no. 101). Perkins is convinced not only that the Eyrarland image is a representation of Thor but also that it represents Thor as "wind-raiser," one of this god's attributes being his ability to raise a favorable wind by "blowing into his beard." Before commenting further, I should state that Perkins develops a most careful and convincing interdisciplinary case in support of his interpretation, but that is not to say that I agree with all aspects of his thesis, par ticularly when he expands his discussion to other Viking-age images found in Scandinavia. Perkins's thesis is based in the first instance on his reading of Icelandic literary sources, assessed against the background of anthropology and iconography, developed in the light of archaeological finds. He warns his readers that when "I stray from my home ground of philology and allied subjects ... I tread far less confidently" (p. ix), but the only weakness in his overall methodological approach would seem to be, to this reviewer at least, the lack of any broader art-historical context for his iconographical/archaeological discussion.</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 1371 However, given that this is a volume that contains material that will be of interest to a range of medievalists, it is regrettable that the abundant Old Norse is, for the most part, left untranslated. My main reservation concerning Perkins's conclusions is that, having argued his case for the Eyrarland image being Thor blowing into his beard, he develops the beard-clutching element of the figure into an argument for other Viking-age beard-clutching/pulling figures as also representing Thor, without acknowledging the existence of other medieval instances of this striking motif, both earlier and later in date, from other European contexts. The beard-pulling figures that decorate the columns of the canon tables in the Book of Kells are clearly not depictions of Thor, but the motif could well be illustrative of the act of cogitation by venerable men. On the other hand, the single beard-pulling man who appears in the canon tables of the Barberini Gospels squats naked while pointing to his genitalia with his free hand. In this case, he is being attacked by serpents and so would appear to belong to the genre of the damned sexual sinner, but he serves to introduce the important concept, overlooked by Perkins, of the beard as a secondary male sexual characteristic representative of virility?and thus of lust in Christian iconography (see A. Weir and J. Jerman, Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches [London, 1986], pp. 108 10). On the other hand, the numerous pairs of mutual beard-pullers appear, to my knowl edge, always to be fully clothed, and so this specific motif, seemingly representative of dispute and disorder, can be left aside for present purposes. The relevance here of beard clutching/pulling concerns not only the Eyrarland image but also the three that form the subject of chapter 3: a seated walrus-ivory figure from Lund, a half-length amber figure from Denmark, and a squatting bronze figure from Chernigov in Ukraine. The two small figures from southern Scandinavia do both appear to be clutching (rather than pulling) their unforked beards because they use both hands, but they might be doing this in pensive rather than wind-blowing mode, if they are (as I and others have argued) playing pieces rather than cult images, being well suited for use in a board game by virtue both of their size and of their flat bottoms. They also differ from the Eyrarland image in lacking moustaches, and both are bald (as opposed to being helmeted). The ar guments presented for the identification of the Chernigov figure as Thor (alongside the Eyrarland image) are, as Perkins notes, "possibly the strongest," but I do not follow him in supposing that "a single explanation for all three objects is desirable" (p. 74). In dismissing the board-game argument for the two Scandinavian finds, Perkins rejects also a similar identification of a whalebone figure from a tenth-century grave at Baldurs heimur, in northern Iceland, in the form of a man squatting on a flat circular base while clutching his forked beard; the beard emerges from below his circular face in such a way that his (closed?) mouth has no contact with it. How, then, can this also be supposed to be Thor blowing into his beard? It was, after all, found together with a set of plain playing pieces made from cattle bone, but Perkins argues against the image's having formed part of this set, as its king, because not only is it made of a different material (whalebone) but also "where sets of playing-pieces have been discovered in Viking-Age graves, the 'king' does not seem to have differed from the other pieces in anything like the degree that [the Baldursheimur image] differs from the twenty-four pieces of cattle-bone alongside which it was found." He supports the latter statement by reference to the set found in grave 624 at the Swedish Viking-age town of Birka (p. 136). Had, however, he looked instead at the set of twenty-five (similarly shaped) glass pieces found in Birka grave 750, he would have discovered that their king is indeed an anthropomorphic figure (if lacking both beard and arms!). There is no space here to argue this point further, but suffice it to say that I remain unconvinced that the Baldursheimur figure is a cult object, rather than a playing piece, even if an Icelander may have chosen to carve this king somewhat in the image of Thor. We come, finally, therefore to the one image found in Scandinavia that provides both</page><page sequence="3">1372 Reviews technically and stylistically, as well as by virtue of its size, the closest parallel to the Eyr arland image. This is the squatting ithyphallic figurine from R?llinge, in Sweden, who pulls his beard with one hand while the other frames his erection; at the same time, his nakedness is accentuated by the wearing of a helmet. There is widespread agreement that this is a cult image of the fertility god Frey, although Perkins (p. 135) feels unable to dismiss completely the possibility that this, too, is a wind-raising Thor (but then, as noted above, the beard as sex symbol is not discussed by him). I have three minor complaints on which to end, all of which are addressed to the editors of the Viking Society for Northern Research: a volume of this range and complexity de serves an index; the image on the cover is not that named in the title; and, more significantly, too many of the illustrations were scanned at too low resolution for clarity.
