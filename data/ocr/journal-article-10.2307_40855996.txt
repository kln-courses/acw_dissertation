They are concerned with the excavations at two prehistoric sites at opposite ends of Chios, at Ayio Gala in the north, where the late Miss Edith Eccles made soundings in a pair of caves in 1 938, and at Emporio in the south where I directed work for the British School at Athens from 1952 to 1955. The material from Ayio Gala is divisible into two chronological groups: an earlier, of which Dr. Audrey Furness (Mrs. Ozanne) has already published a careful study, and a later which appears to be assignable to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. The earlier material is certainly Neolithic in Aegean terms, and has been assigned by Dr. Furness to a very early phase of the Aegean Neolithic. This assignation seems to me correct. The great interest of Emporio is the stratified sequence for the early prehistoric periods obtained in the main Area A of the excavations. The oldest occupation levels of the site were not reached here, since they lay below the existing water table. The earliest pottery recovered has been classified by some of those who have seen it as Late Neolithic in Aegean terms, and that was my own view of it at first. But further study of this material has convinced me that it belongs to a much older horizon, and that it goes back in time before the earliest occupation at Ayio Gala. It is therefore I believe assignable to the beginning of the Early Neolithic in Aegean terms. The bulk of the prehistoric material recovered at Emporio belongs to these early periods, that is (in Aegean terms) to the Neolithic and the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. This material has been divided among ten Periods, based upon major building developments in Area A. The ten Periods fall into five main groups which are marked by distinct changes in pottery fashions. The first of these groups (Periods X-VIII) seems to cover a relatively early phase of the Aegean Neolithic, while the latest part of it (Period VIII) can be correlated with the earliest known phase of settled occupation in the Troad (Besjk Tepe and Kum Tepe I A) . The pottery of the second group (Periods VII VI) is closely related to that of Kum Tepe I B in the Troad. This second group (Periods VII VI) appears to overlap with the end of the Middle Neolithic and part of the Late Neolithic on the Greek mainland. The third group consisting of Periods V and IV with pottery akin to that of the Trojan region seems to fall within the earlier part of Troy I. The fourth group (Periods III II) follows a destruction of the Period IV settlement by fire. It should overlap with the later stages of Troy I and with the beginning of Troy II before the manufacture of wheelmade vases there. The fifth group (Period I) with the first appearance of wheelmade pottery at Emporio seems to correspond with a late stage of Troy II. The pottery of Ayio Gala and that of the early periods at Emporio evidently reflect quite separate traditions. The pottery from the two sites is in fact so different that it is hard to establish a chronological relationship between the two sequences. The earliest pottery from Ayio Gala, however, appears to fall within Periods IX VIII at Emporio; but occupation continued in the caves there into the time of Emporio Periods VII VI and perhaps V-IV. The marked divergences in the pottery from these two sites at opposite ends of Chios seems to be the effect of settlers reaching the island from different regions at different times. The first to arrive established themselves in the fertile south of Chios in the area of Emporio. They made vii</page><page sequence="7">viii PREFACE dark-surfaced pottery distantly related to that of the earliest horizon known in Anatolia (e.g. Çatal Hüyük) and in Syria (from Amuq Phase A onwards) . These immigrants probably came to Chios from the south or south-east. Early pottery from caves in the region of Antalya on the southern coast of Turkey has features reminiscent of pottery from the lowest levels reached by excavation at Emporio. The earliest pottery of Ayio Gala on the other hand is red-surfaced and obviously related to that known from Hacilar in south-western Turkey. Similar pottery appears to have been noted at Morali in western Turkey opposite Chios. The immigrants who first occupied the north of the island and settled in the region of Ayio Gala may therefore have reached Chios from some neighbouring part of the Turkish mainland. The later stages of the Early Bronze Age, the period of Troy III-V, were not certainly represented at Emporio by architectural remains or deposits in the areas excavated. But fragments of pottery suggest that there was continuity of occupation at the site throughout the Early and into the Middle Bronze Age overlapping with the opening phases of Troy VI. A little imported grey Minyan ware and some of the local matt-painted ware recovered at Emporio may be of Middle Bronze Age date; but the decoration of much of the matt-painted ware seems to reflect Cretan fashions of the earlier part of the Late Bronze Age (Late Minoan I). There was some evidence for Mycenaean occupation at Emporio as early as Mycenaean III B. An important Mycenaean settlement undoubtedly existed there during the following Mycenaean III C period, and this was finally destroyed or abandoned in an advanced phase of Mycenaean III C. A number of complete or restorable Mycenaean III C vases was recovered from this horizon of destruction or abandonment. These two volumes of Prehistoric Emporio and Ayio Gala were conceived as one, and the line of division between them is arbitrary. The pages, text figures and photo plates, as well as the pottery, have therefore been given consecutive numbers. Volume I begins with a survey of prehistoric sites known in Chios, and describes the excavations at Ayio Gala with the pottery and other finds from the caves there. It continues with a discussion of the relationship between the sequence at Ayio Gala and that at Emporio, followed by an account of the excavations at Emporio, with a report on the pottery of the earlier periods from the main Area A there. This brings the story of Emporio down to the point where the settlement was destroyed by fire towards the beginning of the Early Bronze Age in the time of Troy I. Volume II continues with the report on the pottery from Area A and from other parts of the site (Areas B-F) at Emporio. It includes a survey of what is known about occupation at Emporio in the latest phases of the Early Bronze Age and in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages together with an account of the Mycenaean pottery. Descriptions of other finds apart from pottery are followed by a report on the animal bones from Emporio by Juliet Clutton-Brock, and one on the chipped stone assemblages from Emporio and Ayio Gala by Perry Bialor. Volume II ends with a section on the chronological position of the Chian Neolithic and Early Bronze Age sequences as known from the excavations at Emporio and Ayio Gala.</page><page sequence="8">Acknowledgments The work of Miss Edith Eccles at Ayio Gala (1938) was financed by the late Dr. Philip Argenti and Mr. Eumorfopoulos. Excavations at Emporio (1952-55) were made possible in the first instance by the generosity of an anonymous donor. Other donors who wished to remain anonymous were inspired by his example to help finance the excavations. I and the other members of the excavation party would like to join the Committee of the British School of Archaeology at Athens in expressing our deepest gratitude to them all for what they did. We are also most deeply grateful to that wise and good citizen of Chios, the late Mr. George I. Choremis, not only for his generous financial support of the Emporio excavations from year to year, but also for his active interest in the results, which extended to the problem of the eventual housing of the finds in a worthy manner. The fine new Museum which has since been built in Chios town represents a noble consummation of his dreams. The soundings at Ayio Gala were made in 1938 by the late Miss Edith Eccles with the assistance of Miss Lilian H. Jeffery, and Mr. (now Sir) David Hunt. Illness prevented Miss Eccles from returning to Greece after the war to complete her work on the material, and she kindly invited me to undertake the publication of it in connection with the excavations at Emporio from 1952 to 1955. It is not possible to list by name all those who took part in the Emporio excavations; but among those who were in charge of trenches in the prehistoric sector were Miss Mary Williams (now Mrs. William Elliott), Miss Rachel Simmons (Mrs. Sinclair Hood), Miss Colina MacDougall, Dr. Michael Ballance, and Mr James Mellaart. Our foreman at Emporio was Mr. Ioannis Theotokas, then mayor of the neighbouring village of Piryi, without previous experience of excavation work, but a man of great character, efficient in organisation, loyal and shrewd. Mr. George Laspis, his brother-in-law, was outstand- ing among the workmen. Mr. Michaeli Kokolis was in charge of the pot-washing. Our vase-mender and technician was Mr. Stelios Katsarakis. Some of the pottery from the Upper Cave at Ayio Gala was mended by Mr. Argyri Marinis. All those who have worked on the archaeology of Chios since the Second World War owe much to the help and friendly interest of the local Epimelete of Antiquities, Mr. Antonios Stephanou, and it is a pleasure to record our indebtedness to him in connection with the excavations at Emporio where he was a frequent and welcome visitor. We also enjoyed the support of the Ephors of Antiquities for the region which included Chios, the late Professor Nicolas Kontoleon, and Mr. A. Vavritsas who succeeded him. The earlier survey work at Emporio was done by the late Mr. David Smollett, but the final plans of the area were made in his own clear and uniquely strong and distinctive style by the late Dr. Michael Ventris, assisted by Mrs. Betty Ventris. The pottery was drawn by Miss Audrey Petty (now Mrs. Spencer Corbett), Miss Wendy Biggar (Mrs. Lardner-Dennys), Miss Rachel Simmons (Mrs. Sinclair Hood), and Miss Elizabeth Crowfoot. Drawings of the other finds were made by Miss Petty (Mrs. Corbett), Miss Christine Sapieha (Mrs. Freeman), and Miss Deborah Pawson (Mrs. Ruscombe-King). The final tracings of the pottery are mostly the work of Miss Elizabeth Crowfoot and Mrs. Patricia Clarke. Mrs. Clarke has also laboured with skill and ix</page><page sequence="9">x ACKNOWLEDGMENTS patience to make the final ink drawings of most of the trench plans and sections. The arduous task of typing the text has been successfully completed by Mrs. E. T. Templeton. Miss Olga Krzyszkowska has read through the accounts of bone objects and made some helpful suggestions in connection with them. Mrs. Helen Hughes-Brock has kindly answered questions and given advice and references about spindle whorls and beads, Dr. Oliver Dickinson about Minyan ware and ring pendants (metal 17). I am grateful to Dr. David French and to Dr. William Phelps for permission to cite their unpublished doctoral theses lodged respectively in the libraries of the British School of Archae- ology in Athens and the Institute of Archaeology in London. The thesis of Dr. Phelps represents an important contribution to Aegean Neolithic studies. I am also obliged to Mr. J. A. MacGilliv- ray for allowing me to refer to his unpublished account of pottery from the Mt. Kynthos settlement on Delos, available in the library of the London Institute of Classical Studies.</page><page sequence="10">Abbreviations The following abbreviations are used in addition to those current in BSA: AAA Athens Annals of Archaeology AASyr Annales archéologiques arabes syriennes Aberg, Chronologie iv N.

Period III GENERAL The material assigned to this period in Area A came from the retaining walls 53 and 54 and the fill of stones dumped in the ruins of the Period IV houses behind them in order to make a terrace or platform at a higher level round the well. It looks as if this platform and the terrace walls supporting it were built more or less immediately after the Period IV destruction, without any appreciable interval of time during which the site was deserted. Some of the pottery from the fill of stones, including a few more or less restorable vases, clearly belonged to the Period IV destruction level and has been incorporated with the material of V- IV. At the same time a certain amount of pottery indistinguishable from that found in levels of Period II was recovered from the upper part of the stone fill, which was evidently contaminated to some extent with material of Period II or later.

EMPORIO jugs with finely burnished black surfaces, were decorated with ribs in relief; one was a base (III G 19) with a rib round the bottom and a vertical one rising from it. Another fragment, apparently from a jug with a black burnished surface, appeared to have a circle in relief with a wart at the centre, a motif of decoration also attested in Period II (e.g. 1803, 1804). 141 2. (Ill Qstone fill behind wall 53) Fragment of large vase with elaborate incised decoration. Grey clay; surface grey inside, brown outside, very worn. Possibly a stray of Period VIII. vi. Period II GENERAL The pottery of this period from Area A consisted entirely of fragments coming from a deep fill of rubbish dumped against the latest face (54) of the Period II terrace wall in the eastern parts of trenches Q, X and R. This rubbish seems to have been piled behind a new terrace wall constructed somewhere beyond Area A to the east. The rubbish may have been dumped in two distinct stages, separated by a certain interval of time, since the pottery from the upper group of levels (5 and 6) appeared to be somewhat more developed in character and to reflect improvements in fabric and finish. Some of the lowest levels assigned to Period II were mixed with material from IV. The pottery of Period II has every appearance of being evolved from that of IV. There is nothing to suggest any outside influence such as might have been expected if a group of people with a different pottery tradition had settled at Emporio after the Period IV destruction. The dominant type of bowl was still the carinated type 9 as in V-IV. As in V-IV the finest burnished finish appeared to be reserved for bowls with outward curving rims of types 13 and 14. Incision, often with a white fill, remained the standard way of decorating vases, and was especially characteristic of large jars of fine burnished ware descended from the collar-necked jars with elaborate incised decoration of Period IV (e.g. 1239). FABRIC As in earlier periods all of the pottery was handmade, and the bulk of it was still burnished. It was fairly uniform in fabric, the clay being tempered with straw and grit even in the case of small vases of fine burnished ware. There was still no sharp line of division between fine and coarse wares, but the larger vases tended to have a more aggressive temper of straw and grit and less well burnished surfaces. Some large vases of comparatively coarse fabric, however, were given a very high burnish. The firing was usually not very thorough or even, and the colour of the clay in the break can therefore vary in different parts of the same vase; it is often grey in the centre. The surface colour, as in Periods V-IV, was in general sombre - shades of dark brown, grey-brown, or black; but sometimes light brown or red. The surface normally seemed to agree in colour with the clay, depending on the way the vase was fired: the clay being dark grey or black in the case of black surfaces, reddish or light brown in that of red or light brown ones. But there was evidently a good deal of control over the firing, and certain types of vase consistently appear to have had the same surface colour, which must have been a matter of deliberate choice. Small vases with a very fine polish-like burnish, for instance, tended to be black; and small bowls of the standard carinated type 9 were apt to have black or dark brown surfaces, while the larger type 9 bowls, and large jars of fine burnished ware, were more often variegated, with surfaces mottling from light brown to red and black: this variegation, however, may simply reflect the greater difficulty experienced in controlling the firing of the larger vases.</page><page sequence="25">3. AREA A. PERIOD III 433 There was some evidence for an improvement in the fabric and finish, especially of the fine burnished wares, in the upper levels of Period II. The fabric became noticeably harder, which should imply better firing. The colour of the clay in the break now tended to be light brown or light grey in contrast to the darker greys, browns and blacks, dominant earlier. The temper in the pottery from the later deposits of II was also more even in character, with the use of grit of a more regular and uniform size. The burnishing was apt to be finer, leaving the surface with an almost metallic sheen. There appeared to be a greater degree of uniformity in the surface colour of vases from these upper levels. Surfaces now tended to be shades of brown or red, whereas in the lower deposits of II the fine burnished wares at any rate were normally either black or a vivid red, bowls being on the whole dark-surfaced, jars reddish. Small well-made bowls of type 9 with finely burnished black surfaces were more in evidence in the lower levels of II. In all phases of the period, however, some of the smaller vases, jars as well as bowls, had a very fine burnish like a polish, with the marks of the burnishing implement hardly if at all visible. The surfaces of this fine burnished ware were usually black or dark grey-brown, but sometimes red, occasionally light brown. As in Periods V-I V a very fine polish-like burnish appears to have been especially favoured for bowls with outward curving rims of types 1 3 and 14; their surfaces, grey-brown or black in colour, are apt to feel soapy, and in a few cases incipient rippling has developed reminiscent of the rippling of the finest burnished ware of the Middle Neolithic in Crete. Large vases such as storage jars and pithoi tended to have a summary 'stroke' burnish, with the marks of the burnishing implement clearly visible. But some large vases were evidently given a very fine burnish rivalling that of the most carefully finished of the small ones. Others, however, including one or two large carinated bowls of type 9, were left without any burnish at all. Even some of the very smallest vases (e.g. 1536 of type 13) were unburnished or had only a slight and superficial burnish. Some if not all of the red-surfaced vases had been coated with a red wash. Where the surface had been thoroughly burnished the existence of this was difficult to establish; but a red wash was clearly distinguishable in a number of cases where the surface was unburnished or had only been given a superficial burnish. As in earlier periods a red wash had evidently been applied to many of the dark-surfaced vases, and some fragments of jugs, with burnished outside surfaces grey-brown to black with a reddish tinge, had splashes of matt red paint on their insides. A tinge of purple or red was often apparent in the dark burnished surfaces of vases, reflecting it seems the original red of a wash deliberately transformed in the firing. This feature recalls the 'wine-red tinge, almost like an undercoat, which shows through the black surface' on a variety of the Luster Ware that first appears at the end of the Late Subperiod of Troy I (Troy i 53). One or two fragments, coming from closed vases as well as from bowls, appear to have been coated with a lustrous or slightly lustrous black wash which had not been burnished (e.g. plate 90 no. 16). Even in these cases the wash may have been red in colour when it was applied; and one fragment from the top of level 5, belonging to a large but thin-walled jar, seemed to have a slightly lustrous red wash on the outside. These fragments with a lustrous wash might have belonged to imported vases, but there was nothing in the fabric or shape to indicate this. White Burnished Ware. Several fragments, all apparently from jugs, had a burnished white slip on the outside. The white of the burnished slip might shade to dusky and dark grey in colour. The clay was grey-brown and indistinguishable from that of the mass of pottery of local fabric. These white burnished vases may therefore have been made in the area, and might represent a continuation of the tradition of the White Slipped Ware of earlier periods at Emporio.</page><page sequence="26">434 III. EMPORIO White Burnished Ware differs in fabric from the fragments described under White Coated Ware which appear to come from imported vases. Cooking Pot Ware. A distinctive Cooking Pot Ware could now be isolated from the mass of the coarse ware. Some of the vases in this fabric were quite thin-walled; the clay being characteristically iron-grey in the centre of the break, red-brown at the edges, and fired very hard; the surfaces normally shades of purple-brown and unburnished. This fabric was used for making tripod cooking pots of type 27 and for jars such as 1589 and 1591. Foreign fabrics (see also under 'Imports'). The wares below were distinguishable to a greater or lesser extent from the mass of local wares, and all of them may be of foreign origin. (1) Micaceous Wares. As in the earlier periods a whole group of fabrics could be distinguished with shiny mica-like particles in the clay. Some if not all of the vases of these micaceous fabrics were imported, perhaps from the Cyclades. (a) Standard micaceous wares. A number of the distinctive slashed handles, which appear to have belonged to large jars of Cycladic types, were of a characteristically hard fabric, the clay being sandy, normally light grey in the centre of the break, and red shading to pink or orange at the surface, which might be well smoothed or burnished. The mica in the clay, always more or less abundant, was for the most part silvery, but golden particles were frequently visible as well. The grit used as temper was often white, suggestive of marble. Most of the vases of this fabric seem to have had a red or buff wash on the outside. But one slashed handle ( 1 71 7) with abundant white grit in the clay had been given a thin steaky black-brown slightly lustrous wash; while another similar handle, of hard sandy orange clay with gold and silver particles in it together with abundant fine white, grey and red grit, preserved traces of a thick black to dark brown truly lustrous wash of which the surface had crackled: in this case the wash had evidently been splashed over the outside of the vase in a way reminiscent of the trickle ornament common on jars of the Early and Middle Minoan periods in Crete. (b) Black burnished micaceous ware (plate 90 no. 1 7) . One or two fragments of vases, mostly it seems jugs, with black burnished surfaces from the latest deposits of II were made of sandy clay with a little silvery mica in it suggestive of a foreign origin. The clay was reddish brown, fired an even colour throughout. The outside surfaces (but not the insides) were black with a very fine polish-like burnish. (2) Obsidian Ware. This rare but distinctive ware, described under Periods V-IV although already attested in levels of VII-VI, was in effect a variety of micaceous ware. It may correspond to Trojan Scored Ware. The fabric is noticeably hard, and the sandy clay has some mica in it together with shiny black particles suggestive of bits of obsidian. Parts of two vases of this ware (1809) were recovered from levels of II. (3) Fine Light Grey Burnished Ware. Varieties of this presumably imported fabric occurred sporadically from Period X onwards. Two fragments ( 1 8 1 o, 1 8 1 1 ) were found in levels of II. The clay was very fine, light grey throughout, or dark grey at the core and light grey at the edges. The surface was light grey and burnished. Mica might occur in the clay, but traces of it were not always visible. (4) White Coated Ware. Two groups of fragments with a white slip are considered here.</page><page sequence="27">3. AREA A. PERIOD II 435 All may come from jugs, like the fragments of the apparently local White Burnished Ware; but the fabric suggests that the vases in this case were imported. The Gritty Ware of early Troy II, described as 'often coated with a thin, dull, milky slip', sounds as if it might have been similar (Troy i 223 f.). (a) Four fragments (181 2) from level 7 and the top of 14 (plate 90); all perhaps from the same vase; thick- walled, of soft, sandy clay, shades of pale grey, pink and brown, and in fabric somewhat reminiscent of Middle Helladic matt-painted ware. The grit used for temper, some of it very large, was brown, red, yellow and white in colour. The thick white slip was confined to the outside surfaces, suggesting that the fragments came from a closed vase or vases; but the insides appeared to have been roughly smoothed if not burnished, while the outsides were left untreated, except in one case where the outside had also been smoothed. (b) Three fragments (181 2 A) , all from the same deposit in level 5, but apparently from three different jugs (plate 90); the clay orange or grey in the break, with large grit; the outside surfaces creamy white with a brownish tinge, roughly burnished. Some particles of mica showing in the surfaces of the fragments suggested that they came from imported vases. SHAPES (a) bowls 2. Dishes 1413 (fig. 197) The only fragment of a dish recovered has pattern burnish typical of Period VIII and appears to be an earlier stray. 141 3. (II X 5) Profile. Light grey-brown; fine burnish. Outside with pattern burnish: alternate groups of diagonal bands cf. Period VIII. 3. Baking pans There were a few fragments of these from the levels below 6; all might have been earlier strays. 4. Open bowls with straight or slightly curving sides 1 4 1 4- 1 420 (fig. 197) Rims assignable to this type were not uncommon. One (1420) has a large horizontally perforated lug on the outside. Upright rims of coarse fabric like 14 14 may come from tripod cooking pots (type 27) rather than bowls. 1414.

They shade into ones assignable to types 6, 7, and 9, especially type 9D (e.g. 1 438) . The rims may be thickened, and are occasionally flat-topped (e.g. 1 42 1. 1434). Bowls of this type evidently came in a wide variety of sizes, but many were small with diameters of less than 15.

AREA A. PERIOD II 437 bowls of type 9. One or two bowls appear to have had some very elaborate form of vertical handle (e.g. 1437). The rim 1442 has a horizontally perforated lug; but 1441 with an incipient trumpet lug may be an earlier stray. Warts and solid lugs are not uncommon (e.g. 1435-6, 1444), those of the horned type being well represented (1445-7). One horned lug (1443) has a pair of vertical perforations through it. The flat top of the unique rim 1430 from a shallow bowl (type 5C) was decorated with a row of finger-nail impressions. The small bowl 1759 with an elaborate combination of incised decoration and areas of burnish appears to have been of type 5. 1 42 1. (II R 16) Coarse gritty clay, dusky to orange; surface light greyish brown mottling to red, evidently well burnished, but worn. 1422. (II Q6/5) Purplish to red, burnished. Several rims of similar shape in various fabrics from levels below 6. 1423. (II 0,6/5) Clay grey at core; surface light brown to reddish, well burnished.

(II 0,6/5) Rim from bowl of type 5C, with fingernail impressions along flattened top. Dark grey-brown with a reddish tinge; fine polish-like burnish. A jug rim 1391A from III G level 19 with similar fingernail impressions along the flattened top may be a stray of Period II. Rims with nicks or impression along the tops appear to be a feature of the Late Neolithic on the Greek mainland (e.g. Corinth: Hesperia vi (1939) 509 fig. 27). They were evidently common in the earliest Tsangli (Dhimini 1) phase of the Late Neolithic in Thessaly (e.g. Arapi pls. 1: 24; 3: 3, 8), but are also attested in the Early Bronze Age there (e.g. Argissa iii pls. 3: 15; 9: 15). Jar rims with impressions of this kind similarly occur in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of Macedonia (PMac 84 note 8, 175 no. 204, 196 f. nos. 358, 366). Small bowls (diameter less than 15) 1 43 1. 1432. Rims of standard type common in levels above and below 6; some with side handles set on or just below rim.

Bowls with inward-leaning rims 1 448- 1 45 2 (fig .197) These occurred, but do not seem to have been common. The rims grouped here merge into those assignable to types 7 and 8. Some of the rims are squared or flattened on top (1448-9) . Warts are found on the outside of the rim, as on bowls of types 5 and 9 (e.g. 1450). The scrap 1452 with traces of pattern burnish must be an earlier stray, probably of Period VIII. 1448. (II R 7 A) Grey clay; surface pitted, grey outside, light greyish brown inside, burnished. 1449. (II X 7) Grey-brown, burnished. One or two others similar. 1450. (II R 9) Circular wart on outside. Soft fabric; surface reddish to light brown, burnished. 1 45 1.

Light brown clay; surface light reddish brown; remains of fine polish-like burnish. Earlier stray, probably of Periods VIII or VII-VI. 7. Bowls with inward-leaning rims and high shoulders 1453-1455 (fig. 197) This type had by now virtually merged with type 9. The few rims grouped here include ones like 1453 which are probably from bowls of type 9 with the carination somewhat rounded; the others are either anomalous, or may be earlier strays. The unique rim 1454 with a bold finger-impressed rib around the outside apparently comes from a bowl rather than ajar, but might be classed under type 38. 1453. (II Q7) Stump of side handle. Grey-brown, burnished. Possibly better classified under type 9. 1454. (II X 5) Horizontal band of relief ornament below rim. Hard grey clay; surface purple-brown, burnished inside and out. Possibly from ajar cf. type 38. 1455. (II O 5) Large disc-shaped wart on outside. Dark brown; fine burnish. 8. Bowls with carinated shoulder s and tall rims 1 456 (fig. 197) The one or two rims of this type from levels of II may all be earlier strays. 1456. (II O 6/5) Surface dark grey-brown; comparatively slight burnish inside, well burnished outside. 9. Carinated bowls 1457-1518 (figs. 198, 199) As in Periods V-IV bowls of this type were by far the most common. Indeed the proportion of type 9 bowls was if anything higher in Period II than it had been in IV. There was a great range in the size of these bowls, and some were very large with diameters in excess of 40 or 50. At the other extreme came a series of small bowls with diameters of about 15 or less. These small bowls were evidently just as common and characteristic as the large ones; but bowls of an intermediary size with diameters of c. 20-25 seemed to be less in evidence, in marked contrast to Periods V-IV when type 9 bowls of the intermediary size were more or less standard. In the case of the larger bowls (notably those from the upper levels 6 and 5) there is a tendency for the rims to be of classes B and D, rather than of class A, which was normal in Periods V-IV. This may reflect the fact that the larger bowls of type 9 in Period II were apt to be shallow, evolving towards the very shallow varieties (some of them wheelmade) characteristic of the following Period I; but deep as well as shallow varieties were represented among the smaller bowls with diameters of about 15 or less. Several rims from the lower group of levels (below level</page><page sequence="31">3. AREA A. PERIOD II 439 6) are hollow on the outside (class C) like many type 9 bowl rims in Periods V-IV (e.g. 1467). A number of rims of all classes are markedly concave below the carination, and this concavity may give the carination itself a profile like that of a rib in relief (e.g. 1457, 1465, 1467, 1479, 1488). Bowls of type 9 merge into ones assignable to types 6 and 7. But the distinction between rims of various types was perhaps sharper in the material from the upper levels 6 and 5, since the carinations of type 9 bowls from these levels tended to be neater and more clean-cut. At the same time the finish of bowls from the upper levels seemed to be more regular, and their surfaces more even. The surfaces of the smaller type 9 bowls from all levels of II tended to be shades of dark grey-brown to black; but they often had a reddish tinge, making them appear a dark purplish brown. As in earlier periods the surfaces of the larger bowls were apt to be less uniform in colour, and were often shades of light brown or red: now as earlier this no doubt reflects the comparative difficulty of controlling the firing in the case of large vases; but red surfaces, when they occur, are probably for the most part deliberate and imply the application of a red wash. A few rims of bowls, mostly of large size, from the upper levels 6 and 5 had unburnished red washes. Even small bowls, however, might have unburnished surfaces (e.g. 1489), or burnished surfaces with reserved areas unburnished as in the case of 15 18. As in Periods V-IV side handles, set on or immediately below the carination and rising above the level of the rim, were standard on type 9 bowls and might occur in pairs (e.g. 1500). These handles were normally circular in section, but some were more or less triangular. What appeared to be the stump of a vertical strap handle was noted on a rim akin to class B from II Q, level 5. Trumpet lugs of class 3a (fig. 191 ) were attested on type 9 bowl rims from levels above as well as below 6 (e.g. 1505); they were uncommon, but did not appear to be earlier strays. As in V-IV warts were usual on the carinations of type 9 bowls. These were normally circular or oval; large oval warts, often upturned, were characteristic (e.g. 15 14-15). Square-ended (151 7) and horned warts (15 16 cf. 1516A: plate 83 (a)) also occur. There is a group of three vertical warts on the rim 1506. No complete profile of a type 9 bowl with joining rim and base was recovered from a level of II, but many bases it seems were as fig. 109, class 8, which was characteristic of Period II. Some of the common pedestal bases and ring feet (fig. 109, classes 2 A, 3 A) may also come from type 9 bowls. The small rim 15 18 with the stump of a handle has elaborate incised decoration, the undecorated parts being reserved without burnish. This combination of incised decoration with reserved areas is also found on a number of small bowls of type 13 from levels of II. ( 1 ) Large bowls A. Rims at open angles 1457.

But type 9 rims with incised decoration already occur in early Troy I contexts (e.g. Troy i 1 15 fig. 261: 6, 7). 1 2 . Bowls with straight rims, thickened and usually differentiated on the inside 1 5 1 9- 1 520 (fig. 200) The few rims of this type from levels of II may be earlier strays. 15 19. (II R ?g) Surface uneven, lightish brown, stroke burnished. 1520. (II Q,7) Trumpet lug on outside. Dark grey clay; surface pale whitish brown, burnished inside and out. 13. Bowls with outward-curving rims, internally differentiated and thickened 1 52 1-1547 (figs. 199,200) Bowls of this type and of the allied type 14 were characteristic of Period II, although not as common as those of type 9. As in Periods V-IV the best finish seemed to be reserved for bowls of these two related types, the most finely burnished surfaces tending to be black in colour. At the same time some bowls of these types either had a very poor burnish or were left altogether unburnished (e.g. 1528). Rims of type 13 were sometimes neatly squared or flattened at the tips. In several cases there was an incised line or groove round the inside of the rim (e.g. 1525-6, 1529-30, 1542). Indentations or projections of various shapes, biting into or rising from the rim, appear to have been very common on bowls of types 13 and 14 in Period II. For indentations, see 1543 and 1760, 1765, 1768 (plate 82). Projections may be single, or double and horn-like (e.g. 1769, 1 771, on plate 82). Projections with a large hole through them approximate to lug-handles (e.g. !54O). A few bowls of these two types were provided with vertical strap handles rising above the rim (e.g. plate 82: 1770); sometimes at any rate such handles clasped the rim from both sides (e.g. 1538). A number of bowls of type 13 including 1538 had elaborate incised decoration as seen on plate 82; these richly incised bowls were for the most part small and thick-walled. In the case of some of these incised bowls parts of the surface had been reserved, without any burnish (e.g. 1545); the incised designs normally occupied the burnished parts, but occasionally it would seem the roles were reversed, the reserved areas being incised and the burnished ones left plain. The decorative effect might be still further heightened by the addition of red paint, contrasting with the white fill in the incisions.</page><page sequence="35">fig. 199. Period II.

Incised lines appear round the outside of one or two thickened rims like 1550, which are in effect undifferentiated versions of type 13 rims. Some small bowls as 1 559 were rough and shapeless; the surfaces of these were normally light brown to reddish with very poor burnish or none at all (e.g. 1 560) .

Dipper cups 1566-1568 (fig. 200) A number of fragments of vertical handles, mostly as 1566, appeared to come from bowls akin to types 4-7. Some bowls with vertical handles were evidently large; but most were probably quite small, and classifiable as dipper cups. 1566. (II 0,6/5) Rim with stump of vertical handle.

Three low warts on belly, as found on jugs of other types. Outside grey-brown, burnished; inside rough. Incised decoration on body and rim. Traces of white fill. Jugsof standard types 1571-1577 (figs. 199, 201, 202. plate 81 (g)) Fragments of these were abundant. As in earlier periods this abundance may reflect some ritual of breaking jugs in the area of the well. The vases from which the fragments came were evidently of various sizes, some being very large. Rims might be flat without a spout (fig. 201: 157 1); or might rise steeply into a pointed spout as 1573, cf. 1576. Pointed spouts of this kind appear to have been very common and characteristic, but cutaway necks (fig. 201 : 1572) also occurred. In 1571 ' V 1573 1574 1572 the case of jugs with pointed spouts the cutting away of the neck gives the rim an angular shoulder (fig. 201: 1574, cf. 1576). The wart on the tip of the spout 1576 is a feature which appears to have been more at home in the upper levels 6 and 5 than in those below 6. Several jug necks had a sharp ridge or carination running down the throat (e.g. fig. 199: 1575). Throat ridges of this kind seem to be something new and characteristic in Period II. The bodies of jugs were also sometimes carinated; the evidence for carinated bodies being perhaps more forthcoming from levels below 6 than from the upper levels 6 and 5. The rim 1577, apparently from a jug, has a lug on the outside with a hollow in the top and a small hole sunk into the bottom of it as if for the insertion of a twig or rod of some kind. A fragment of neck with a horizontally perforated lug at its base ( 1 724) may also come from a jug. One jug rim with a finely burnished black surface (III/II Qfill between walls 53 and 54) had a circular wart on the outside. Jug handles might be set to the rim or below it; but handles were now more commonly set below the rim than to it, in sharp contrast to the situation in earlier periods, when jug handles were almost invariably to the rim. The handles of jugs from levels of II characteristically have neat semi-circular (fig. 108 no. 6) or, less commonly, lunate (no. 7) sections; circular- or oval-sectioned handles as fig. 108 nos. 1 and 2 are now exceptional on jugs. The outside surfaces of jugs were normally burnished, shades of grey-brown to black, dark and light brown, and red. The insides of jug bodies often showed traces of having been wiped with a bunch of twigs of which the impressions might be very bold and clear. 1 571-1574.

Tripod cooking pots 1578-1586 (fig. 202) These were evidently in common use during Period II to judge from the large numbers of feet counted. Some of the cooking vessels with tripod feet were shallow and bowl-like, as 1586; but the majority of them appear to have resembled jars with everted rims of class B III f. Feet (1578-86) (plate 84) normally ran to a point, but a few from the upper levels 6 and 5 were square-ended (fig. 202: 1582-3. plate 71 (/) no. 3). Themost elegant feet swung outwards and were triangular in section, like 1578 (fig. 202. plate 84). But sections were normally oval, somewhat flattened on the outside, as fig. 202: 1580. Some feet from the upper levels 6 and 5 were neatly semi-circular in section. Tripod feet with similar neat semi-circular sections occurred in the evolved Blue period at Poliochni (Poliochni i pl. lxxi). One large foot from Emporio (II X 5) had a diamond-shaped section, while 1581 (II X 5) was wide and flat. The largest foot noted (1580A from II R ?9) (plate 84) was over 15 in length; but most were ^MÊk^Jrù fi 1576 84 1 ' I x ' ' ' ' I I ill ••" ' I x ' ' ' 1 ' ; ' '-{ ' I I -I * ill 1586 ' 'S' l^'J / d'I -,,,,,,,,,,,,,,^ I 1582 ' 1 ^^^^r m x^^ 1 I ' I I 5oo ' 1 11 ÍÑ7Q ^^^^^^ Hi m J I ' m -jiuiiii '1 W I vi 'J m D □ -jiuiiii</page><page sequence="41">3. AREA A. PERIOD II 449 considerably shorter. The small foot 1584 (II R 7 A) of normal thick oval section had a rib in relief down it (fig. 202. Cf. 1582 A on plate 84). In one or two instances the tops of tripod feet were neatly differentiated (e.g. fig. 202: 1586 cf. 1585 from II Q,7); these differentiated feet may come from bowl-like cooking vessels, as seems clear in the case of 1586. There are examples of tripod feet with the tops differentiated in this way from Poliochni (Poliochni i 238 pl. lxxii: f, evolved Blue period) . The surfaces of tripod feet were characteristically dusky brown or reddish, with poor burnish, or even altogether unburnished; but some were very well burnished. Large coarse unburnished feet of cooking pots were more noticeable in the upper levels 6 and 5. 1586. (II Q14) Rim of tripod bowl with top of foot. Hard grey clay with large grit; surface with poor burnish, lightish grey inside, light brown to greyish and dusky outside. (c) JARS I587-1638 (FIGS. 203, 204) There were many rims belonging to storage jars akin to types 38-40; large strap handles of coarse fabric evidently came from these. Jars of other types often appear to have been coated with a red wash. Many of the jars with finely burnished surfaces may have had such a wash, which was more obvious, however, in the case of jars with a poor burnish or none at all; on these the surface colour tended to vary from red to shades of purple. Large jars were apt to have light-coloured surfaces, shades of red or light brown, the surfaces of small jars being shades of darker brown to black; but there was no absolute rule. Simple upright or inward curving rims, differentiated (classes B I- II) or undifferentiated (class All), were much in evidence. Jars with such rims evidently ranged in size from large pithos-like vessels to small pyxides akin to type 44. Even the largest jars with rims of these classes might have finely burnished surfaces. Many jars of all sizes had a pair of vertical strap handles, either set below the rim, or joining rim and shoulder, or on the shoulder. In the case of jars of fine burnished ware the handles were often of neat semi-circular or lunate section like those of contemporary jugs. The smaller differentiated rims of classes B I- II sometimes had an incised line at the base of the neck (e.g. 161 1, 1613). A number of class B I- II rims appear to have come from jars of all sizes with elaborate incised decoration. The elaborately incised lids of the cover type 63 from levels of II must have belonged to such jars, and imply that they had simple upright rims over which the lids could fit. While many body fragments of decorated jars were recovered, only one or two rims had traces of incised decoration on them. This suggests that the rims of incised jars were normally left plain, like that of the richly decorated jar 1239 of type 47 from the Period IV destruction level. The larger examples of Period II incised jars appear to have been supplied with vertical strap handles set low on the shoulders. In shape therefore the larger jars would have approximated to type 47. The smaller incised jars on the other hand were evidently pyxides akin to type 44 with vertically perforated lugs as fig. 106 nos. 31 a-c and e. The swellings on these incised jars, both on those oflarge and on ones of small size, were frequently carinated. Indeed it would seem that the small pyxis-like jars akin to type 44 were more often carinated than not. Some of the largest jars decorated with incision were evidently of very great size; fragments over 1.5 thick were recovered. While the outsides of these decorated jars, whether large or small, were regularly given a very fine, often polish-like burnish, the insides were left rough. The burnished outsides of the large jars were in general grey-brown to black, usually with a purplish or reddish tinge, shading to light brown and red. Reds and lighter browns were more in</page><page sequence="42">450 III. EMPORIO evidence than darker shades of grey-brown and black. But the burnished outer surfaces of the decorated lids which appeared to belong to these large jars were normally dark grey-brown with a purplish tinge, although light brown and red surfaces also occurred. The inside surfaces of the large incised lids were usually treated to a rough stroke burnish. Horned lugs, solid or occasionally perforated, were much in evidence it seems on the lids; but simple unperforated lugs (e.g. 1669) also occurred. The incised designs on the large jars and on their lids were evidently elaborate, and often incorporated rows of circles made with the ends of reeds. The incisions tended to be bold, and were in many cases, but not it seems invariably, filled with white. The small incised jars (pyxides) akin to type 44 and their lids were in general dark-surfaced, grey-brown to black, often with a purplish tinge, but occasionally light brown or even red. Fragments of small incised jars occurred in all levels of II, but were perhaps more evidence in those below 6. On the other hand small pyxis-like jars of the finest burnished ware, but with plain surfaces and no incised decoration (e.g. 1597, 161 2), appeared to be more in evidence in the upper levels 6 and 5, although one or two rims as 161 2 were recovered from II Q, level 7. Rims of class B III from jars cf. type 47 occurred in all levels of II, together with the handles, whether vertical or horizontal, which may have belonged to such jars. Class B III a rims tended to be internally differentiated as B III a: variety 3. Short everted rims of class B III f were common; most of them came from cooking pots, which were probably of the three-footed type 27; several had a vertical wart on the outside (e.g. 1637-8), and this was often the centre of a triangular projection rising from the rim. Vertical warts (e.g. 1593, 1600, 1607) and sometimes ribs (1592) also appeared on rims of other classes. Circular warts were common on jar rims; one rim (1595) had a double circular wart below it.

(e) pithoi 1641-1647 (fig. 204) Rims of these normally seem to have corresponded to jar rims of variety 3 of class B III a (e.g. 1642-3). Large vertical strap handles from pithoi include several with incised decoration consisting of chevrons, cross-hatched bands or diamonds, or with bold grooves or channels running down the length. Two of these decorated handles had a large hole made before firing at one (probably the top) end. Pithoi might be very thick-walled, but were usually well-fired and of hard fabric. The outsides normally seem to have been coated with a red wash, although this often shades to purple in colour. Outside surfaces were burnished, but the burnish can be very superficial. One large pithos (1645) appears to have had a lustrous black wash. Bases might be flat as 1646, or splayed (e.g. 1647). Four or five fragments from large pithoi preserve a horizontal band of diagonal incisions which seems to have encircled the base of the neck as on pithoi of Periods V-IV. The making of pithoi may have been the work of itinerant specialists, as suggested for earlier periods at Emporio. 1641. (II Q, walls 57 and 58) (plate 90) Fragment of large vase, apparently pithos.

(f) lids i 648-1 696 (figs. 199, 205) These seem to have been in more general use in Period II than they had been in V-IV. Flat lids of type 60 were the most common, many being of coarse cooking pot type ware, although some were well burnished. A number of these flat lids were adorned with circular or oval warts (e.g. 1652, 1655). One or two evidently had strap handles in the centre and belonged</page><page sequence="47">fig. 205. Period II. Lids. Scale 1/3. 3. AREA A. PERIOD II 455 to type 61 . Small flat lids with incised decoration may have covered pyxides akin to type 44; one (1656) had a raised flap with a string-hole through it. Cover lids (type 63) of all sizes were also very well represented. The larger lids of this type probably came from largejars with rims akin to classes B I- II. Many of these large lids had finely burnished surfaces with elaborate incised decoration (plate 87); they presumably belonged to the largejars with finely burnished surfaces and ornate white-filled incised designs which were a feature of Period II. Small lids of type 63 (plate 86) were evident from small jars with rims of classes A II or B I- II including pyxides of type 44. At least one small lid of this type (II Q5) with burnished surface shades of light and dark brown to reddish appears to have had a central handle, circular in section. A flat-topped knob from a surface level (1685) evidently came from the centre of a small incised lid which may have been of type 63. Lugs of various shapes, perforated or solid, are found round the edges of type 63 lids from this horizon, there being two, or more commonly perhaps four, to each lid. Horned lugs, perforated or solid, were not uncommon (e.g. 1686-7). j '' /^i ^^^^^^^^^ ' vxX j?" n 1648' 1652* " ^^ I 1654 _ ft^^^t} 1649 "*' 16¿" ^^r"^S^V ""j" 1656 J' /4É i ' ,66, __J S / ' *- a^&gt; ,662 .,-' ^ S ,669 *- ^ p^ &gt;^| ^ ^ /^^% f~' '667 /) [V/' A ^°r£ :~^ -664 ^^| "^!^' i by 4 16ÌÌ_jfc c22 16î' c « i by 4 c22 c «</page><page sequence="48">456 III.

As in Periods V- IV some types of bowl were provided with handles, either horizontal, or less commonly vertical. (a) Vertical. About a dozen fragments of bowls with vertical handles were recognised from levels of II. Some of these bowls were evidently large - of types 5 or 1 3 where the shapes could be identified; but others were small and classifiable as dipper cups of type 16. The handles were either set on the outside of the bowl as in the case of 1566 of type i6, or were placed clasping it from the inside and outside (e.g. 1537-8 of type 13, and 1567 of type 16). The massive stump projecting from below the rim 1437 of type 5 appears to be part of some kind of vertical handle. (b) Horizontal. Bowls of certain types, notably those of the common type 9, were regularly provided with side handles, usually it seems with only one, but sometimes no doubt with two set opposite each other (e.g. 1500). In at least two instances (on bowls of types 5 and 9 from X level</page><page sequence="50">458 III. EMPORIO 7) a couple of handles appeared to have been placed together side by side. These side handles often rose at a steep angle above the level of the rim. They were in general of the simple rounded shape as fig. 107 no. 1; but pointed (2) and ogival (3) handles also occurred. Some forty-five handles of the pointed or ogival shape (fig. 107 nos. 2, 3) were counted from levels of II; nicked and horned handles as fig. 107 nos. 4 and 5 seem to have been unusual, however, and only about a dozen were recognised in all. A number of the ogival handles were remarkable for their elegance (e.g. 1699, 1 700) . Side handles from bowls were normally circular in section as fig. 190 no. 1; but some of the finest of all shapes were triangular (fig. 190 no. 2) or rectangular (3), and one from a level below 6 was hollow on the outside as fig. 190 no. 4. Lug-handles. Characteristic of this horizon, although not common and confined it seems to bowls of types 13 and 14, were triangular or horned lug-handles with large circular holes through them as 1540 (cf. plate 88 (a)). Similar projections, but without holes, also occur on bowls of these types (e.g. 1541). Triangular projections may be combined with vertical warts (e.g. 1542 of type 13; 1563 of type 14); in some cases at any rate the fragments with these appear to come from jars or cooking pots. Trumpet lugs. These occurred throughout II, but were not common. Some of the dozen or so examples noted may have been earlier strays. Five or six had been set on bowl rims as fig. 191, class 3 a, the bowls being in at least three cases of type 9 (e.g. 1505). Most of the other trumpet lugs appear to have been as fig. 191, class 1 a; but at least one (II R 7A) might have come from a closed vase, the outside being dark reddish brown with a fine burnish, the inside rough and unburnished. Horizontal trumpet lugs are found on the bellies of some Early Helladic III jars on the Greek mainland and on that of an Early Bronze Age jar from the Mount Kynthos settlement on Delos (e.g. Lerna: Hesperia xxix (i960) pl. 70: j. Delos xi 37 fig. 35). Two other trumpet lugs from levels of II might have been set vertically on jars or jar-like bowls of the type which flourished at Emporio before Period V. Both of these, in view of their anomalous fabric, might be earlier strays; one (II R 10) has a grey-brown surface, burnished but worn, the other (II Q, 7), of soft sandy orange clay, preserves traces of a light brown burnished surface. 1697, 1698. (plate 83) Horizontal side handles of standard types varying from pointed to slightly ogival, as found throughout II. Smaller varieties as 1698 appeared more at home in levels below 6. 1699.

Some 8,400 fragments of such handles, mostly belonging to jugs, were recovered from levels of II. Those of fine quality with a good burnish tended to be semi-circular or lunate in section. Handles of fine burnished ware might be differentiated at the base (e.g. 1 7 1 2-1 6) . A very few handles, only some twelve in all (less than 1 : 900) , were ribbed; most had a single rib, but one from a low level of II had a double rib. These ribbed handles tended to be of fine fabric, and often had a very high burnish; in four instances the burnished surface was red.</page><page sequence="52">460 III. EMPORIO One of the ribbed handles was surmounted by a wart. But handles with warts, common during Periods V-I V, were now excessively rare; only about a dozen examples in all were noted from levels of II, and some of these were almost certainly earlier strays, although others, like 1 708 with a bold flat- topped circular wart, appear to be definitely of this period. The comparative rarity of warts on handles is the more striking since they were still commonly placed on the bodies of vases of all kinds - bowls, jugs, jars, and lids. Incised decoration was similarly less common on vertical handles of jugs and jars than it had been in V-IV; only some 24 examples of such incised handles were noted in levels of II, an average of less than 1 :45o. Jug handles from levels above 6 were often 'pushed-through', and such 'pushed-through' handles also occurred in levels below 6 (e.g. 1712). The objects 1 709, 1 7 10, with a single perforation through the end made before firing, might have belonged to 'anchor ornaments' on the analogy oîPoliochni i 657 pl. clxvii: 3-5. But no other fragments attributable to these were recognised at Emporio. The unique twisted handle 171 1 was evidently from an imported vase. Horizontal side handles. These were common on jars as well as on bowls. Several of those from jars were of the slashed type which appears to be of Cycladic origin. Some vases with slashed handles were evidently imported to Emporio from the Cyclades, but such vases were also imitated there. Some of the slashed handles from levels of II were circular (171 7), others semi-circular (1719) in section. 1708. (II Q, 14) (plate 83) Vertical handle surmounted by large flat-topped wart cf. 2245.

Vertical handles of fine burnished ware, differentiated at base. Gf. Troy i 106 fig. 240: 17, 18, for comparable fragments from Troy I c regarded as handles. But it seems just possible that some of these are illustrated upside down, and that they actually come from the tops of tripod feet like 1586. 1 71 7. (II O 5) Side handle of slashed type. From a thin-walled vase. Very fine fabric; hard grey clay, orange at surface, which has abundant large white marble-like grit and silvery mice showing in it. Outside with a thin, streaky, black shading to brown, slightly lustrous wash. Presumbably an import. Four others similar from levels below 6. One, 1 718 (II R 7 A) (plates 88, 90), evidently an import; sandy grey to orange clay with fine grit and gold and silver mica; surface with traces of a thick red wash, which crackled. Two, without mica in the clay, may be local imitations: one (II 0,6/5) of soft grey clay, orange at surface, with abundant grit, has remains of a very thick red wash; the other (II R 9) of similar fabric has the surface light brown with traces of smoothing or burnishing. 1 719. (II Q5) Side handle of slashed type. Hard sandy grey clay with very fine grit (some white, marble-like) and silvery mica; surface orange with traces of smoothing or burnishing. Presumably an import. Another, 1 720, similar (II X 15-1 3, 7) (plates 88, 90) also appears to be an import: sandy orange clay with abundant mica; surface with 'trickle ornament' in thick black to dark brown lustrous paint. (3) Lugs 1 721-1738 (fig. 207) Trumpet lugs have already been discussed under ( 1 ) Bowls, from which most of those recovered from levels of II certainly came. Lugs of other types with horizontal perforations were not common. They occurred, however, on bowls (e.g. 1420, 1721), and on some closed vases. The vertical lug with horizonal perforation 1 724 was evidently set in the angle of a jar neck. This and</page><page sequence="53">fig. 207. Period II. Lugs and warts. Scale 1/3. 3. AREA A.

Vertically perforated lugs were more in evidence. Although rare on bowls they occurred on jars of all sizes, and especially on small ones of the pyxis type 44. These lugs were characteristically upturned, and triangular in shape (as 1727) or sometimes horned. Compar- able lugs, horned (e.g. 1659) or triangular (e.g. 1661) in shape, were also placed on lids. The circular 1 728 is unique; the double 1 729 may come from a bowl. The double tubular lug 1 730 is interesting for comparisons with Crete and the Cyclades. Solid lugs were of common occurrence on bowls, as well as on jugs or jars, and on lids. Like the vertically perforated lugs they were often upturned and somewhat triangular in shape. Solid horned lugs were also not rare. Solid lugs shade into circular or oval warts, which were extremely common, except on handles. One unique lug set on the outside of a jug rim had a hollow top with a hole let into it (1577). 1 72 1 . (IV/II Q22) Horizontally perforated lug, set on outside of rim of bowl cf. type 5.

Troy i 1 12 fig. 266: 7, set below rim, possibly of a tripod cooking pot, from an early level of Troy I. Comparable pairs of lugs are found on vases of the Early Bronze Age in Crete (e.g. VTM 9 No. 4193, assigned by Xanthoudides to E.M. I or the beginning of E.M.

A large number of pedestal and ring feet, however, as fig. 109, classes 2 A and 3A, were recovered from levels of II and seemed to be more in evidence in the upper levels 6 and 5 than in those below 6; most if not all of these appeared to come from bowls. One high ring foot (1743) was perforated with holes like a strainer (fig. 109, class 3B). Low ring feet (as class 4B and occasionally as 4A), and flat differentiated bases (classes 8A and B), were evidently characteristic on large bowls of fine burnished ware. Sunk bases, apart from low ring feet of class 4B, seemed to be rare. The fragment 1749, resembling a small square base with incised decoration on the underneath, was unique. Tripod feet were very common, and have already been considered in connection with cooking pots of type 27 to which they belonged. A number of short feet of fine burnished ware appeared to come from jugs of type 21 (e.g. 1570) or small three-footed jars akin to type 44. 1 739. Pedestal foot (class 2A) .

EMPORIO DECORATION 1758-1807 (fig. 208) As in Periods V-IV decoration when it occurs is normally incised; but even incised decoration is not as common as it was earlier. Rare, but apparently characteristic of Period II, is the combination of incised decoration with contrasting areas of burnish and non-burnish. This represents the use of burnish for decorative effect; but pattern burnish of the classic type as found in Period VII is excessively rare, although something of the kind seems to have been used on occasion. Decoration in white paint was also very rare in Period II, although one or two fragments with white-painted decoration appear to be of contemporary fabric rather than earlier strays. Red paint, however, was occasionally used in Period II in conjunction with white-filled incised decoration to create a polychrome effect (e.g. 1 759) . Warts, and the solid lugs which merge into them, were regularly placed on vases as decoration. Ribs in relief, when they occur, are often curved, in striking contrast to the rectilinear character of the vast bulk of the incised decoration. Pattern burnish A few scraps with classic pattern burnish resembling that common in Period VIII are evidently earlier strays (e.g. 1413, 1452). But the burnishing instrument was sometimes used for decora ti ve effect in Period II, as on 1544 of type 13, and on 1761. Such burnishing may on occasion approximate to pattern burnish of the classic type; the fragment 1758 for instance has a widely spaced net pattern on the outside. An uncommon but very striking form of decoration which appears to be characteristic of Period II is the combination of areas with fine burnish and incised decoration with contrasting areas left reserved, without burnish or incision. This elaborate system of decoration seems to have been mostly used on small bowls of type 13 (e.g. 1545), but is also found on a bowl of type 9 (15 18) and on lids (e.g. 1659). For other examples, see 1987-8, 2106, 2298, 2369, 2422, 2431, 2503 (from a deposit of Period I). Once at least (1759) the scheme was reversed, areas with incised decoration being left without burnish, while the undecorated areas were burnished; the decoration in this case was further heightened by triangles of matt red paint outlined with incision. This latter system of decoration recurs at different times in different places. It is paralleled on two fragments from Samos (Tigani 134 pl. 24: 8, 9). In Cilicia it is found at the beginning of the Chalcolithic and again in the Early Bronze Age (Mersin 62 fig. 37 pl. x: 1 . Tarsus ii figs. 230: a, b; 254: 270, 274). The reserved slip ware of Levels XIII-XIV of E.B. 2 at Beycesultan sounds comparable (Beycesultan i 167 pl. xxii, a: 4). The same system of decoration occurs at the beginning of the Cretan Neolithic on a few fine E.N. I pieces from Knossos (BSA lix (1964) 212 pl. 46 (4): 1). It is also apparently found in the Middle Neolithic of Thessaly (Milojcic, Ergebnisse fig. 11: 3, 8. Thessalika iv (1962) 82 f. fig. 7, from Soufli Magoula) . 1758. (II Q7) (plate 81) Fragment of bowl. Inside red with fine burnish; outside dark brown, unburnished except for widely spaced net pattern made with thin burnishing implement. 1 759. (II Q7) (plate 82) Fragments including part of rim from small bowl of type 5.

(II no level) (plate 82) Rim with projection, from bowl of type 1 3. Surface dark purplish; very fine burnish in areas with elaborate white-filled incised decoration; areas without decoration left unburnished. 1 76 1. (II Q,6/5 (plate 81) Jar rim. Surface red; inside burnished; outside with vertical strokes of burnish, apparently spaced for decorative effect.</page><page sequence="57">3. AREA A. PERIOD II 465 Paint Painted decoration was very rare in Period II, although both red and white paint were occasionally used on vases then. ( i ) White paint. A scrap from ÇHevel 5 with a light brown burnished surface decorated with thin lines of white paint may be an earlier stray. A fragment of a jug, however, from Q level 7 with a black burnished surface decorated with broad stripes in white seems to belong to a contemporary vase. (2) Red paint. In several instances matt red paint was used for decoration in conjunction with white-filled incision (e.g. 1 762-4) . The paint normally, although not invariably, seems to have been applied after the surface had been burnished. The effect of the contrasting red and white against the dark burnished surfaces of the vases would have been similar to that of the red and white painted decoration of Cretan Kamares ware. In the case of 1 759 matt red paint was combined with incised decoration and reserved areas left without burnish. 1762. (II Q, 14) (plate 82) Fragment, apparently from bowl of types 13 or 14. Surface grey-brown with very fine burnish. The area on the outside not occupied by incised decoration seems to be unburnished and is coated with bright red matt paint. 1 763. (II no level) (plate 82) Small base, cf. class 8, apparently from bowl. Surface dark to light brown with very fine burnish; outside with incised decoration filled with white. Traces of matt red paint round join of base and bowl. 1764. (II Q, 14) (plate 82) Fragment, apparently from just above ring base of bowl. Surface brown to black, burnished. Traces of matt red paint round point of junction with base cf. 1763. Incision This was by far the commonest form of decoration in Period II, although not as much in evidence as in V-IV. It was largely confined to vases of certain types, notably bowls of types 13 and 14 (plate 82), large jars with collar necks (plates 88 (c), (/);8g (e)) and their lids (plate 87), and small lidded jars of the pyxis type 44; but a number of fragments and some strap handles decorated with incision (fig. i 17) from levels of II may have belonged to jugs. The incisions, made as in earlier periods while the clay was still damp and soft, were normally deep and bold, and often retained traces of an original white fill. One fragment from what may have been a small jar akin to type 44 - the outside surface purple-brown with fine polish-like burnish - had what appeared to be an attempt at decoration roughly scratched after firing, presumably by the owner of the vase. Elaborate designs combining white-filled incision with contrasting areas of burnish and non-burnish, sometimes with the addition of red paint, have already been described under Paint and Pattern burnish. The motifs of incised decoration used in Period II were essentially similar to those current in V-IV, although the designs were more varied. This can be seen in comparing the incised designs on handles from levels of Period II on fig. i i 7 with their equivalents of V-IV (fig. 116). Some of the designs on fig. i 16 (nos. 1,8, io, 11, 13-15) also come on handles from deposits of Period II. Apart from these, the Period II designs of fig. i i 7 nos. i and 2 correspond to fig. i 16 nos. 2 and 3; fig. 1 1 7 nos. 3, 4 and 5, to fig. i 16 nos. 9, 14 and 15; while fig. i i 7 nos. 7-12 can be regarded as elaborations on the theme of fig. i 16 no. 17. Decoration was still dominantly linear, and curvilinear motifs were exceptional; the very few possible examples of curvilinear motifs included the neck of a jug or jar (1798) with a row of dot-filled circles, comparable with the dot-filled oval on the neck fragment 1351 from a level of V. Chevrons and zigzags, and areas filled with dots (pointillé) or with cross-hatching (lattice),</page><page sequence="58">466 III.

Reed-made circles occurred on some vases in Period IV, but were distinctly rare then. In Period II they were especially prominent in the elaborate schemes of decoration adorning the large collar-necked jars and their lids. Semi-circles made with a reed are also attested in II. Relief Warts and the large solid lugs which merge into them were common, especially on the</page><page sequence="60">468 III. EMPORIO carinations of bowls of type 9, and on the swellings, sometimes carinated, of jugs; they also occurred perhaps on the swellings of jars. These warts and lugs were often characteristically upturned or horned. Double warts are also attested (e.g. 1595). The five examples of flat, disc-shaped warts were all apparently from closed vases (e.g. 1800). One fragment of a closed vase (1802) had a diamond-shaped wart on the outside. Vertical warts or ribs were regularly placed on the outsides of the rims of jars and cooking pots (e.g. 1592-3, 1600, 1607), and occasionally it seems on those of bowls (e.g. 1506 of type 9). Ribbed ornament was by no means rare, and the ribs were often curved (e.g. on the rim 1564, assigned to type 14. Cf. 1805-6): a contrast to the almost invariably linear character of the incised decoration of Period II. Horseshoes in relief were noted on the bodies of jugs or jars in seven instances; some at any rate were set high on the shoulder of the vase just below the spring of the neck (e.g. 1807). In one case (II R 9) what seems to be an inverted horseshoe appears immediately above the carinated swelling of the vase. There were two possible examples of circles in relief with a wart at the centre (1803-4) comparable with one from a level of Period III. Horizontal ribs with bold finger-tip impressions or notches were noted in two instances: below the rim 1454 assigned to a bowl of type 8, and on another fragment also apparently from a bowl, and like 1454 from level 5. 1800, 1 80 1.

IMPORTS 1808-1815 (fig. 208) Various fabrics which have already been described under Fabrics appeared to be foreign to Emporio; the vases made of these fabrics were presumably imports. (1) Micaceous Wares (a) Standard Micaceous Ware. The unique twisted handle 1 7 1 1 which appears to come from a jug, and the distinctive slashed handles 171 7-9 which evidently belonged to jars, were of this fabric. Other possible imports on the basis of mica in the clay include 1701. 1 808. (II Q,7) (plate 90) Thin strap handle, perhaps from a jug, and two fragments which may have belonged to the same vase. Hard grey clay, red-brown at the edges, with mica; surface light brown with fine polish-like burnish. Cf. Thermi pl. xxxiv: 9, from Towns IV-V. (b) Black Burnished Micaceous Ware. This wasvonly represented by one or two fragments, mostly from jugs. The two illustrated on plate 90: 20, 2 1 (bottom centre) (II R 7A, X5) are from closed vases of sandy reddish clay, the outside surfaces black with fine burnish. (2) Obsidian Ware Parts of two vases of this distinctive fabric, already noted in earlier periods, were recovered from levels of II.</page><page sequence="61">3. AREA A. PERIOD I (WELL) 469 1809. (II X 15-13, 7 and Q, 14 and 7) (plates 89 (/), 90) Fragments from body of jar, which may have had a collar neck like 1243 of similar fabric from V/IV. Hard sandy clay, grey in break; inside surface mushroom pink, rough, with occasional specks of mica and hard shiny black particles showing in it; outside grey-black with even burnish, decorated with a row of boldly incised hatched triangles set just above the swelling. Fragments decorated with hatched triangles which look very similar are illustrated from the E.B. I- II horizon at Ikiztepe on the Black Sea coast of northern Anatolia (Y. Yakar, Tel Aviv ii (1975) 138 pl. 27: 1). (3) Fine Light Grey Burnished Ware Two fragments assignable to this fabric were recovered from levels of II. 18 10.

(4) White Coated Ware The two groups of fragments with a white slip grouped under this heading have already been described under Fabric. 181 2. (II Q, 7) (plate 90) Three fragments, and another from top of level 14, all perhaps from the same closed vase; thick-walled; soft sandy clay, shades of pale grey, pink and brown, with grit (some very large) brown, red, yellow, and white in colour; inside surfaces roughly smoothed or burnished; outsides with thick white slip, not burnished, and in only one case smoothed. 181 2A.

Hard grey clay with large grit, dominantly white and brick red, showing in surface, which pocked, and has an unburnished orange to dusky wash. 1814. (II R 7A) Rim of jar (class B III a: variety 3). Possibly wheelmade. Sandy orange clay with fine red, grey and white grit, and some mica; surface with traces of smoothing rather than burnishing. 1815. (II R 7A) (plate 88) Large vertical handle with thin oval section. Sandy orange clay, grey-green at core, with abundant white marble-like grit and silvery mica showing in surface, which has traces of a red wash. Shallow grooved decoration. vii. Period I (the well) (level 4) 1816-1822 (fig. 209) GENERAL Most of the material from the well had evidently fallen into it after the collapse of the stone-lined sides. It came from deposits of earlier periods behind the collapsed sides, and appeared to be largely of Periods V-II with a little of VII-VI. One or two fragments with a red wash from vases that may have been made on the fast wheel (e.g. 182 1 ) suggest that the well continued in use into the time of the horizon identified as Period I (Troy II or later) in Area F on the Acropolis hill above. But all other traces of this horizon had disappeared from Area A owing to erosion of the slopes there. SHAPES (a) bowls 1816. Thickened club-like rim from large bowl of type 7.

IX-VIII) 471 DECORATION Like the rest of the pottery from the well, this reflected a mixture of periods. Paint. Two scraps of fine black burnished ware with decoration in white appeared to be of Periods VII-VI. Incision. This was better represented than any other form of decoration, and was mostly of Periods V-IV rather than later. Relief. A curving rib with a wart from a vase of black burnished ware is comparable with two examples (1803-4) from levels of II and another from III. vii. Surface 1 825-1 828 (fig. 209) The fragments of pottery from surface levels in trenches G, Q,and X, were mostly assignable to Period II, but there were some later elements, including Greco-Roman. From the parts of Area A down the slope to the north-west (trenches H and R), where there was a deepening deposit of stoney hill wash, the bulk of the surface pottery was post-Bronze Age, including Archaic and Classical Greek and Roman; but a few Mycenaean sherds, and one or two handles which might be of Middle Bronze Age date, were also recognised, as well as fragments of Early Bronze Age red burnished ware. The following appear to be of Period II unless otherwise stated. 1825. (G 1) Rim of large carinated bowl (type 9) with side handle. Grey clay; surface shades of brown to black; fine burnish. Cf. Poliochni i 618 pl. ex vi: i, Green period. 1826. (X 1 ) Rim of large jar (class A II) with string-hole. Hard grey clay, light brown at edges, with greyish grit and a little gold and silver mica; outside surface with a creamy slip, well burnished. Possibly an import in view of mica in clay. 1827. (X 1) Rim of jar (class B II a). Orange clay; surface with burnished red wash. Perhaps of Period V or earlier. 1828. (R 1) Small tripod foot (?). Grey-brown with a reddish tinge, burnished. Another, perhaps from same vase. (f) Pottery from Areas B-F i. Area B Stage 1 Trench B level 5 Amount c. 2 zembils 1829-1836 (fig. 210) Periods IX-VIII with some later admixture GENERAL The pottery described below comes from trench B level 5, except for 1833, which is from the surface level 1 in trench B. The bulk of the pottery from this small deposit (level 5) lying immediately above the rock in trench B was early in character, reminiscent of material of Periods IX-VIII; but there were elements of VII and of later periods in it. Thus 1835 is from an incised bowl of type 13 assignable to Period II, and the handle 1836 may date from the same period or later still.</page><page sequence="64">(1) Periods I X-V III There were fragments of bowls of type 8, including one or two rims with traces of pattern burnish (e.g. 1833). Dishes of type 1, characteristic of the earliest periods at Emporio, were also in evidence (1829-30). But a horizontal trumpet lug set on a rim evidently came from a bowl of type 10 which was more at home in Period VII than earlier or later. One or two fragments of the large bowl handles characteristic of the early periods were also noted from the deposit, together with two large elegant horned handles like 335, 337; while two fragments of pithos had bold ribs in relief of sub-triangular section as found on early pithoi at Emporio (fig. 137 no. 1). A scrap with incised decoration consisting of multiple chevrons also appeared to be of early date. 1829. Profile of dish (type 1). Coarse gritty orange clay; inside surface grey-brown to dusky with poor burnish; underneath rough. 1830. Profile of dish (type 1). Diam. very large. Coarse clay with straw and grit; inside surface grey-brown, poor burnish; unburnished brown wash on outside of rim; underneath rough, with straw impressions. 1 83 1. (plate 91) Profile of baking pan (type 3). Coarse clay, shades of light brown to dusky and reddish; inside surface coarsely burnished; outside rough, wiped; underneath with abundant straw impressions. 1832. Rim of bowl (type 4C). 1833. (plate 91) Rim, perhaps from bowl of type 8, with elaborate pattern burnish. 1 834. Rim of jar (class AI). Grey clay; inside surface grey, outside light brown mottling to red and dusky, burnished. (2) Period II or later 1835. (plate 91 ) Rim of small bowl (type 13) with incised decoration inside and out. Shades of light and dark brown; fine burnish. 1836. Handle, possibly from a lid of types 63 and 64. Shades of light and dark brown, well burnished on rounded outside, less well on flat inside. Stage 2 Levels 28-27 Amount c. '' zembils 1837-1854 (figs. 211, 212) Period V with earlier elements GENERAL The predominance of carinated bowls of type 9 in this deposit, together with the presence of tripod feet and the general appearance of the pottery, suggest that the bulk of the material from it is assignable to Period V. A number of fragments, however, notably from the lowest level 28, are clearly earlier, of Periods VH-VI, if not of X-VIII. These include three bowl handles like 1851, and fragments of pithos with triangular-sectioned ribs, cf. fig. 137 no. 1, as found in stage 1. The pieces described are from the upper level 27, unless otherwise stated. 472 III. EMPORIO c 35 C.40? L ________^________ 2# Jjf 1832 ""^V 1835 ^e Wfflm f777ZrfWZS' 1831 1834 ^ fig. 210. Area B.

The rim has a rib around the outside like 749 of Period VII, and there is a curving rib on one of the other fragments; the ribs being sharply triangular in section as fig. 137 no. 1. In addition there was a large pithos handle of thick oval section from level 28, the surface light to dark brown and reddish with a slight burnish. (f) lids (fig. 212) One certain (1850) and another possible fragment came from flat lids of type 60. 1850. Lid (type 60) with circular wart. Shades of light and dark brown to dusky; coarse burnish.

SHAPES (a) bowls The burnished surfaces of the twelve bowl rims from this deposit were in general shades of grey-brown. One rim (1856) with pattern burnish may be an earlier stray. Four others came from carinated bowls of type 9: one with the stump of a large side handle below the carination, another (1857) with a horizontally perforated lug, and the remaining two with warts on the carination. 1855.

(b) jugs and tripod cooking pots Jugs A handle surmounted by a wart and set to a rim may have belonged to a jug. Another rim fragment with the stump of a handle set to it seems to come from a jug of Light Brown Burnished Ware of the kind at home in Periods VII-VI. 2 7 . Tripod cooking pots Four oval-sectioned feet, one of them large, evidently came from tripod vases. One foot was square-ended.

A rim of class B I, of soft grey-brown clay with coarse grit, the surface light brown, burnished, together with a vertically perforated horned lug (as fig. i 06 no. 3 1 e) of similar fabric, and a fragment with a wart and white-filled incised decoration, evidently came from small pyxis-like jars akin to type 44. 1859. Rim, cf. class B II, with vertical handle. Shades of light and dark brown; coarse stroke burnish inside and out. (e) pithoi A large handle, apparently from a pithos, with an unburnished red wash, was sharply rectangular in section like 1295 of Periods V-IV. (i) HANDLES A handle surmounted by a wart may have belonged to a jug, as already noted. Three other vertical handles from jugs or jars were oval or slightly lunate in section. (k) bases There were two bases of bowls as class 6C with grey-brown burnished surfaces. The base fragment i860 of grey-brown clay has a mat impression on the underneath (plate 92). For mat-impressed bases cf. 1942, and under AG 40 in volume i with references. DECORATION This was not much in evidence. The fragment 1861 is decorated in white paint, and another fragment, apparently from a small pyxis-like jar akin to type 44, had a wart and white-filled incisions, as already noted. 1 86 1 .

Stage 5 Levels 15-12 Amount c. 3 zembils 1873-1896 (fig. 215) Period IV (?) GENERAL Some of the material from this deposit seems to belong to the Period IV destruction like that of stage 4; and there is nothing that need be later, apart from a large horned lug (apparently from a Period II lid) from a mixed level of 15-13 with 9. SHAPES (a) bowls Nearly half of the bowl rims (about twenty out of forty-four) from the deposit belonged to the carinated type 9; the burnished surfaces were dominantly grey-brown, but sometimes light brown or reddish; one had the stump of a side handle on the carination. These type 9 rims shaded into ones of type 7 with a curving instead of carinated profile. A rim from level 1 3 with the stump of a vertical handle rising above it may have belonged to a large variety of dipper cup (type 16) like 1874 below.

DECORATION There were three examples of decoration with incision, including 1899. A fragment from the body of a similar pyxis-like jar had finely incised cross-hatching (lattice) with possible traces of white fill, while a vertical handle of oval section (1900) with light brown burnished surface was decorated with multiple chevrons (plate 93). Stage 7 Level 9 Amount c. 6 zembils 1 901-1949 (figs. 216-219) Period II: early phase GENERAL Fine burnished surfaces were dominantly grey-brown, sometimes light brown, or red; but the finest burnished ware tended towards black in colour. Bowls were as a rule finely burnished, as were many jugs, and some jars including the large ones with elaborate incised decoration characteristic of Period II. Jars tended to have crimson red and dark red surfaces, and while these might be well burnished, they usually had a poor burnish or none at all. Some jar surfaces were dull shades of lightish brown to dusky in colour. SHAPES (a) bowls (fig. 216) About one half of the three hundred or so bowl rims from the deposit were assignable to the carinated type 9, while another third (about 100 rims) belonged to small hemispherical bowls of type 5A. Small bowls of type 5A with a very fine burnish (e.g. 1902-3) seem to be characteristic of this horizon, and are not in evidence in earlier periods. Many of them are in effect small bowls of type</page><page sequence="77">3. AREA B. STAGE 7 (PER. II: EARLY) 485 9 with the carination rounded away by hard burnishing of the surface. The sides of some of these little bowls lean slightly inwards so that they might equally well be classified under types 6 or 7. Diameters range from 10 to 20, with an average of c. 15. Like carinated bowls of type 9 these little bowls of type 5A normally appear to have had a side handle set just below the rim, and three warts, one opposite the handle, and one in the middle of each side. The warts tend to be large in relation to the size of the bowl. The handles are either rounded (fig. 107 no. 1 ) or pointed (no. 2) in shape. Surfaces are characteristically grey-brown to black with a very fine polish-like burnish, but the burnished surface may shade to dark or light brown or reddish. There were one or two miniature bowls of the shallow type 5C (1905-6). The surfaces of the abundant carinated bowls of type 9, especially in the case of the smaller bowls which merge into those of type 5A, tended to be grey-brown to black in colour; but a large number of fragments of type 9 bowls were shades of lighter brown or red. Side handles and warts set on the carination were much in evidence and seem to have been normal. In two instances small vertical handles were noted rising from the rims of type 9 bowls, like 10 18 of Periods V-IV. One rim with a red wash, burnished but much worn, had a trumpet lug resembling 1505 of Period II. A miniature bowl of type 9D (1909) was decorated with incision. Less than fifty bowl rims, only about one sixth of the total number, were assignable to other types. Several of these were certainly earlier strays, including one possibly of type 8, and two of type 10 (one as 1058 from a level of IV, the other with a trumpet lug as 540 of Period VI). Straight-sided bowls of type 4 were distinctly rare. One of the seven rims grouped under type 7 had a wart on the outside. Most of the rims (7 out of 13) assignable to type 13 had incised decoration, consisting of a single zigzag inside and, in all except one case, outside as well. A fragment with a horizontal trumpet lug had double chevrons incised on the inside of the rim like 1081 of Period IV. Bowls of type 1 2 were less in evidence than those of type 1 3, but they formed a distinct class on which incised decoration was not attested. The few rims assignable to type 14 were atypical and might have been earlier strays. Only one certain fragment of a dipper cup (type 16) was noted. 1 90 1. Rim (type 4). Angle not certain.

In most cases (twelve in all) handles were set to the rim as in Periods V-IV; but there were two examples of jug handles set below the rim as characteristic of Period II in Area A. Two out of the four spouts recovered were as fig. 2 1 7 no. 1 with a sharp ridge down the front of the neck; the other two were cutaway as fig. 2 1 7 no. 2. One fragment of a large jug with an unburnished red wash had a wart set just below the rim each side of the neck. Three fragments from the bellies of small jugs were carina ted. 27. Tripod cooking pots (figs. 218, 219) There were large numbers of tripod feet, mostly oval or thick oval, but in a very few instances semi-circular or lunate in section. Two feet (1919, 1920) - one of neat lunate, the other of semi-circular section - were clearly differentiated at the top where they joined the body of the vase (plate 93). This way of differentiating the top of tripod feet does not seem to be attested before Period II at Emporio. Many rims from the deposit were attributable to cooking pots. These were of coarse gritty clay, with surfaces shades of light and dark brown through purplish to red, some having clear traces of a red wash; mostly unburnished, but sometimes with a very poor burnish. The rim 192 1 seems to belong to a tripod bowl rather than to a jar-like vase. In a number of cases rims 12 3 4</page><page sequence="79">fig. 219. Area B. Stage 7 (Period II: early).

The surface colour and finish of the large rim 1927 were exceptional. A number of rims of class A from small jars had surfaces shades of light and dark brown and red with a poor burnish or none at all.

There were also many scraps of everted rims as Class A III: one with the stump of a vertical strap handle below it; another, lightish brown with poor burnish, internally thickened and differentiated (class A III d) like 1228 of Period V. A number of fragments came from small jars of the pyxis type 44 with vertically perforated lugs and incised decoration. Two small feet presumably belonged to jars of this kind. Rims of large jars akin to types 45-47 also occurred (e.g. 1929). 1927. Rim, class A I. Irregular. Surface shades of whitish to light and dark brown; coarse burnish inside and out. 1928.

Some fragments had ribs in relief, and others rows of boldly slashed diagonal grooves. (f) lids (fig. 219) Among fragments of lids were two of type 60, one (1933) small with incised decoration; and several of type 63, mostly small with incised decoration belonging to pyxis-like jars, cf. type 44. Two of the latter (1934-5) had perforated horned lugs, and one (1936) a central wart cf. type 63D. 1933. Rim (type 60).

(i) HANDLES AND LUGS (1) Bowls While many bowl handles were rounded like 1937 on plate 83, others were pointed in shape as fig. 107 no. 2; but only one was certainly of the horned class (fig. 107 no. 5). In two instances the stumps of handles were noted rising from the tops of bowl rims: once from a rim akin to type 5, the surface shades of dark and light brown with a rather poor burnish; in the other case (191 8) apparently from above a long horizontally perforated lug which may have been trumpet- shaped. There was one certain example of a trumpet lug, set on a rim of type 9 like 1 505 of Period II; the surface grey-brown with traces of a red wash, burnished but worn. (2) Jugs and jars etc. Vertical handles were common. Some of these with finely burnished grey-brown to black surfaces, apparently from jugs, had an elegant taper. Several, especially among those with finely burnished surfaces, were lunate or rectangular in section; but the cruder handles tended to have oval or semi-circular or triangular sections. There were only two handles surmounted by warts: one was very small with the surface light to dark brown, burnished; the other ( 1 938) to the rim of a jug, with the burnished surface light brown to dusky, was large and rectangular in section, with a bold oval wart across the width of it (plate 94). Three 'pushed-through' ends of handles were noted; all perhaps from jugs, although the outside surfaces, shades of light and dark brown, were unburnished or had only a poor burnish. Perforated lugs from small pyxis-like jars akin to type 44 or from their lids were not uncommon. In four instances these were simple, in twelve horned as fig. 106 no. 3 1 e. Two small solid upturned horned lugs or warts evidently came from the bellies of small jars of this kind; but similar unperforated lugs or warts also occurred on bowls.</page><page sequence="81">3. area b. stage 8 (per. ii: classic) 489 (k) bases These were normally flat. A single neatly differentiated base 1 939 of class 8 may belong to a small bowl, or to a pyxis-like jar of type 44, like the two small feet ( 1 940-1 ) on plate 93. One fragment of base (1942) had a mat impression on the underneath like i860 of stage 3. 1939. (fig. 219) Base (class 8A). Lightish brown, burnished inside and out. 1942.

A single fragment from ajar, probably of type 42, with the stump of a strap handle joining neck to shoulder, had a pair of broad diagonal stripes in thin matt white on the light brown burnished surface. It appears to have been an earlier stray. Incision. This was the standard form of decoration, occurring on bowls of type 14, on small jars of the pyxis type 44 and their lids (e.g. 1935, 1943-9), and on a few fragments of the large jars of fine burnished ware characteristic of Period II; three of the latter were decorated with circles made by the ends of reeds. 1944.

Outside red shading to light and dark brown; fine burnish. Rows of short vertical strokes filled with white. Relief. Warts were common, especially on jugs and bowls, but they also occurred on jars, large and small. Two fragments with ribs in relief came from large jars or pithoi. Stage 8 Levels 8 and 7 Amount c. 1 2 zembils 1950-2046 (figs. 220, 221) Period II: classic, as Period II in Area A GENERAL The pottery from this deposit is dominantly of Period II; but a number of fragments assignable to Periods VII-VI and V-IV appear to have become incorporated in it from earlier deposits exposed on the slopes above. Unless otherwise stated the pottery described is from level 7. FABRIC The pottery is in general of better fabric, and fired harder than was usual in Periods V-IV. The surfaces when finely burnished tend to be more regular and even. The clay, however, is still apt to be rather coarse, tempered with grit and straw. In a few instances vases with a coarse burnish or with the surface unburnished had noticeably larger grit in their clay; but on the whole there did not seem to be any real difference in fabric between vases with finely burnished surfaces (e.g. bowls, jugs, and some jars) and those (mostly jars) with a coarse burnish or none at all. The vases might be fired an even colour throughout; but more often the clay is dark, shades of grey or black, at the centre of the break, lighter shades of colour at the edges.</page><page sequence="82">fig. 22O.

The burnish always appears to be stroke burnish; and even on the most finely burnished surfaces with a polish-like lustre the marks of the burnishing implement can usually be detected. Where the burnish is coarser the marks are more obvious. Coarse burnish is simply the effect of less intensive burnishing - where the burnishing is comparatively superficial or poor.</page><page sequence="83">3. AREA B. STAGE 8 (PER.

Unburnished surfaces similarly display a wide range in colour, but are dominantly dull shades of brown, or grey, or red due to a wash. Cooking Pot Ware. This amounts to a distinct fabric. The clay has abundant straw temper, the straw showing prominently in the surface of the vase, which may be shades of brown or red, often with a purple tinge. The surface is given a coarse burnish or left unburnished; it is often dusky as from use of the vase over a fire. Many if not most of the fragments of this fabric may come from cooking pots, but some cooking pots were of ordinary fabric with finely burnished surfaces. SHAPES (a) BOWLS (FIG. 22O) Carinated bowls of type 9 were by far the commonest, but a certain number of rims, some of them with incised decoration, came from bowls of type 13. Horizontal side handles were much in evidence, while perforated lugs were rare, although they included three trumpet lugs. 2. Dishes (1950-1952) Two profiles of dishes were recovered (1950-1). The base 1952 might have come from a dish of some kind, unless it belonged to a baking pan of type 3; but no baking pan rims were noted in this deposit or in any other in Area B after stage 2. 1950. Profile. Inside surface grey-brown with fine burnish; outside light brown, with slight burnish or worn. Possibly an earlier stray. 1 95 1. (plate 96) Sandy orange clay, well fired; surface very irregular, shades of light and dusky brown to reddish, wiped on inside; outside coarsely wiped, or perhaps impressed with marks of some kind of basketry of which it served as lining. 1952. Fragment of wide base. Baking pan type fabric; coarse sandy clay, grey to dusky orange at core; surface a dirty brown, very irregular and rough, with marks of wiping on inside. 4. Open bowls with straight or slightly curving sides Some fifteen rims were assignable to this type. A number approximated to rims of carinated bowls of type 9D. One rim had a wart, and another a tubular lug set below it; the lug had a slight rib in the middle. 5. Open bowls with curving sides ( 1953- 1956) There were many rims assignable to this type from bowls of all sizes (1953-6). Some of the rims were thickened and pointed, as if they came from bowls of type 9 with the carination rounded away in burnishing (e.g. 1953). About six rims had stumps of side handles set below them (e.g. 1953). Warts occurred on or just below five other rims. The burnished surfaces were dominantly grey-brown to black, sometimes shading to light brown or red. 6 &amp; 7. Bowls with inward-leaning rims (1957- 1959) Rims of these were not common. Some approximated to type 7 with high shoulders. One or two had stumps of side handles as 1958.</page><page sequence="84">492 III. EMPORIO 8. Bowls with carinated shoulders and tall rims The only scrap of rim from a bowl of this type was evidently an earlier stray; the surface light brown, with darker pattern burnish consisting of alternate groups of diagonal lines as character- istic of Period VIII. 9. Carinated bowls ( 1 960- 1978) Rims of these were extremely common. About a quarter of those recovered came from large bowls with a diameter of c. 30 or more ( 1 960-5) , and some bowls appear to have been very large indeed; another quarter of the rims belonged to bowls of medium size with diameters between c. 1 5-30 ( 1 966-7 1 ) , but nearly half were from small bowls c. 1 5 in diameter or less ( 1 972-6) . Rims in general resembled those of Period II in Area A; examples like 1460 and 1463-4 (type 9B), 1474 (type 9D 1) and 1481 (type 9D 2), were noted. Surfaces were normally well burnished, shades of grey-brown to black, often with a purple tinge; sometimes light brown or red, mottling to dark brown or dusky. One rim from a bowl of medium size and another from a small bowl had unburnished red washes. There was no evidence that any of the small bowls was provided with a handle, but this may be accidental, since remains of side handles were noted below four rims from medium-sized bowls and one or two from large ones. The complete profile of a small bowl (1976) with very thick walls, the surface grey-brown, finely burnished, has a trumpet lug rising above the rim. There is a trumpet lug set on the carination below the large bowl rim 1977 which comes from level 10 mixed with stage 6 (plate 96). Warts were not uncommon on the carinations of type 9 bowls; one or two Were upturned (e.g. 1965), and one was horned (1969). Two rims (plate 93) may come from the same bowl 1978 with the burnished surface shades of light and dark brown to red, incised decoration, and a wart on the carination. 1 1 . Bowls with inward-curving rims, internally differentiated and usually thickened A single scrap of rim as 584 of type 1 iA from a level of Period VI has the surface red to light brown, burnished but worn, and appears to be an earlier stray. 1 2 . Bowls with straight rims, thickened and usually differentiated on the inside ( 1 979) The one rim 1979 assignable to this type had a lightish brown burnished surface. 1 3 . Bowls with outward-curving rims, internally differentiated and thickened ( 1 980- 1 990 ) Rims of these were relatively common. The surfaces were invariably more or less well burnished, ranging from grey-brown to black in the case of the finest polish-like burnish, through shades of dark and light brown to red. Lug-handles as fig. 106 nos. 8 a, 8 b, consisting of lugs or projections rising from the top of the rim with large holes through them, appeared to be at home on bowls of types 13 and 14 in the Period II horizon of Area A (e.g. 1540, and plate 88 (a)); and fragments of one or two lug-handles of this class associated with type 1 3 rims were recovered from levels of stage 8 in Area B. In the case of the rim 1989 with a finely burnished grey-brown surface a hole of this kind had evidently been made through the side of the vase below a vertically perforated lug. A small rim (1986) with finely burnished grey-brown surface had a bold groove round the outside. Six other rims had been decorated with incision. In the case of three of these, all from small bowls, 1^87-8 (plate 91) and 1990 (plate 95), the decoration had covered much of the outside of the vase as well as the inside of the rim: their surfaces were finely burnished, shades of</page><page sequence="85">3. AREA B. STAGE 8 (PER. II: CLASSIC) 493 light and dark brown (1987, 1990) or grey-brown (1988); two (1987-8) had areas among the parts without incision left reserved without burnish. Small bowls elaborately decorated with incision and with parts reserved free of burnish were characteristic of Period II in Area A; but no fragments of them were recognised in levels of stage 7, assigned to an early phase of II. The rim 1989, with the unique arrangement of lug and hole through the side, was also unusual in having traces of crude pattern burnish, apparently cross-hatching or lattice of some kind, along its top. The small rim 1985, with a burnished surface shades of light and dark brown and red, had a wart on the outside. Three rivet-holes of hour-glass shape, made after firing, are preserved on 1982: two through the rim, and one lower down, as shown on fig. 220. 1 4. Bowls with outward-curving rims, not internally differentiated, but sometimes thickened ( 1 99 1 - 1 992 ) The few rims assignable to this type included 1992 with traces of decoration in white paint; it appears to be an earlier stray. Two or three fragments had remains of handles in the form of lugs or projections rising from their tops with large holes through them as found on one or two bowls of the previous type 13. A rim with a light brown to red burnished surface had an unperforated projection of this kind rising from it. 1 99 1. Rim. Grey-brown; very fine burnish. 1992. Rim; diagonal hatching in white paint on inside, cf. 618 of Period VII. Soft fabric; orange to grey clay tempered with straw rather than grit; surface light brown to reddish, burnished. Apparently a stray of Periods VII-VI. 15. Carinated bowls with outward-spreading rims ( 1 993) The two or three small rims like 1 993 assignable to this type may have belonged to dipper cups of type 16. (b) jugs and tripod cooking pots (fig. 221) &gt;^(i994-i997) These were not much in evidence, a situation very different from that noted in deposits of Period II in Area A; but fragments of jugs of all sizes were recovered. Many had finely burnished surfaces ranging from black to shades of dark and light brown through purplish to red. In contrast to what was observable in stage 7, handles were now usually set well below the rim; thus in five out of seven cases the stumps of handles were set below the rim, and in only two cases did they slope into it. Spouts included two or three of the pointed class with a ridge or carination running down the front of the throat as on 1994, which had a dark purple-brown surface with very fine burnish. At least two spouts were cutaway like 1995. One fragment of rim (1996 from level 8) with a finely burnished grey-brown surface had a kink in it. The small neck 1 997, with the surface grey-brown to black, finely burnished, has the top of the handle set well below the rim, and seems to have been leaning backwards like the necks of Cycladic jugs. A fragment of a carinated belly with a light brown burnished surface appeared to come from a large jug, but might have belonged to ajar. One fragment of neck, the inside grey, left rough, the outside grey-brown to black with fine burnish, had a groove round its base as if a string had been tied there and left in place while the vase was burnished (cf. 842, 1251, 1403, 2086, 2584). The rim 2023 with the stump of a vertical handle may come from a small jug akin to type 2 1 with wide flat mouth and tripod feet.</page><page sequence="86">fig. 221. Area B.

AREA B. STAGE 8 (PER. II: CLASSIC) 495 17. Tripod cooking pots (1998-2006) (fig. 221) The rims of these tended to be everted, like jar rims of classes A III and B III f, and many such rims evidently belonged to cooking pots whether these had legs as type 1 7 or not. Rims of cooking pots were characteristically raised at the front opposite the handle, and perhaps in some cases at the sides as well, to form triangular projections as 1998-2002 on plate 94. Thirteen rim fragments with projections of this kind were noted from levels of stage 8, and four of these had vertical warts on them (e.g. 1998-9). The surfaces of rims assignable to cooking pots might be shades of light and dark brown to dusky in colour with poor burnish or none at all. But cooking pots with finely burnished surfaces were now in evidence, and were to become characteristic of the succeeding horizon of Period I. The clay of these finely burnished cooking pots was apt to be well levigated, and fired an even colour, light brown to orange, throughout; the surfaces were normally crimson red or dark red shading to purple-brown and dark brown, sometimes light brown. The tripod feet belonging to cooking pots of fine burnished ware (e.g. 2003 on plate 84) could be very large, neatly triangular in section, and flat or hollow on the outside; one large foot had a subrectangular cross-section. Tripod feet of standard fabric, however, like 2004-5 on plate 84, were semi-circular, oval, or thin oval in section. One or two small feet had a marked outward curve. Many cooking pots of this horizon appear to have been provided with a vertical handle set immediately above the back foot, like 1 1 78 of Period IV. In the case of 2006 the handle merged with the top of the foot to form a kind of rib projecting from the body of the vase, which had a red wash with poor burnish inside and out. (c) JARS (2OO7-2O23) (FIG. 221) About a dozen rims came from large jars, cf. types 38-40. Most of these appear to have had an unburnished red wash, but one or two rims (e.g. 2007) had been well burnished; and others with surfaces shades of light or dark brown preserved traces of poor burnish, as 2008. Two large rims (2009, 2010) of class A III, of standard Light Plain Ware characteristic of the early periods at Emporio, were probably strays of VII-VI. Some sixteen rims of classes A I- II belonged to small jars (e.g. 201 1-12), and nearly half of these (seven in all) had stumps of vertical handles set on or just below them; they probably came from jars with a pair of opposed handles as 1 187-8, Most of these rims were unburnished, shades of light and dark brown to dusky, or coated with a red wash; but a few showed traces of poor burnish, and one with a light brown surface was finely burnished. Two rims of class A II had warts on the outside. Some half a dozen rims evidently came from large collar-necked jars akin to types 45-47 (e.g. 2013-14). Two widely everted rims (2015, 2017) were assigned to class B III e, as they seemed likely to belong to jars rather than to bowls of type 14, although both had finely burnished surfaces. Six or seven small jar rims (2018-22) approximated to classes A III and B III f. One of these (2022) had a red wash, but the surfaces of the others were shades of light and dark brown and grey-brown, more or less well burnished. Some of these rims may have belonged to tripod cooking pots of type 17. Small jars of the pyxis type 44 with vertically perforated lugs and incised decoration were represented by fragments. Rims which might have come from such jars included 2016; but 2023, with the stump of a vertical handle, could have belonged to a small jug of type 2 1 with tripod feet.</page><page sequence="88">496 III.

(f) lids (2024-2025) (fig. 221) These were in evidence, and of various types and sizes. Two fragments came from flat lids of type 60, with a diameter of c. 15, and coated with unburnished red washes; one had an oval wart on the outside edge. Large covers of type 63 were represented by some ten fragments, mostly with fine burnish on the outside; but one with a horned lug resembling 1662 of Period II had an unburnished red wash, and another with a solid triangular lug like 1 669 of II, an unburnished wash shades of light and dark brown; two others had solid horned lugs (e.g. 2024). Five of these cover fragments preserved traces of incised decoration. Only two fragments were noted of small lids which might have belonged to jars of the pyxis type 44; one (2025) came from a flanged cover of type 62, the other apparently from a cover of type 63; both had incised decoration. 2024. (Stages 6/8, level 10) Lid (type 63) with solid horned lug. Outside shades of light and dark brown, well burnished; inside brown, smoothed. 2025. Lid (type 62), belonging to a small jar. Surface grey-brown, burnished but worn. Rough incised decoration. (i) HANDLES AND LUGS (FIG. 22 I ) (1) Bowls (2026-2029) Side handles from bowls were common. These were mostly rounded in shape as fig. 107 no. 1, but a good many were pointed (as no. 2) or ogival (as no. 3) (2026-8 on plate 83). No side handles of the nicked or horned shapes (fig. 107 nos. 4 and 5) were noted, apart from the unique 2029 (plate 83) from level 8 with a grey-brown burnished surface. Most handles were circular or thick oval in section, one or two being pointed oval as fig. 1 90 no. 2. A fragment from a bowl of uncertain type with grey-brown burnished surface appeared to have a projection springing from the rim with the stump of a side handle below it. Some half dozen fragments were recovered of lug-handles as fig. 106 nos. 8a, 8b, belonging to bowls of types 13 and 14, formed by projections rising from the rims with large circular holes through them, as already described. Trumpet lugs. There were three examples of horizontally perforated trumpet lugs from bowls: one ( 1 976) set above the rim of a bowl of type 9, the other two - one from level 8, the other (1977) from level 10 with a mixture of stages 8 and 6 - on the swellings or carinations of bowls of types 6, 7 or 9.</page><page sequence="89">3. AREA B. STAGE 8 (PER. II: CLASSIC) 497 (2) JUSS and jars etc. (2030-2035) There were large numbers of vertical handles of all sizes, many of them with finely burnished surfaces, black, grey-brown, dark and light brown, or red in colour. Several, especially of the smaller handles with fine burnish, had an elegant taper. Finely burnished handles were often lunate in section, sometimes semi-circular. Two or three handles with coarse burnish were more or less rectangular in section. Handles which were oval or thin oval in section invariably had a coarse burnish or none at all. One handle was distinctly kidney-shaped; it was coated with a coarsely burnished red wash. The only ribbed handle was also coated with a red wash; it was large and evidently came from a pithos. One vertical handle was circular in section, with a hole made through the top end like some handles of Periods IX-VI; it may be an earlier stray. Many of the handles from this deposit appear to have had the lower end 'pushed through' the side of the vase. Side handles from jars were normally rounded, sometimes pointed in shape. One or perhaps two stumps (2030-1) may have belonged to handles of the winged type like 1701 of Period II (plate 88). The large twisted handle 2046 (plate 88) evidently came from an imported vase. Vertically perforated lugs on small jars of the pyxis type 44 were often if not usually horned. Two examples of double perforated lugs were noted: one on the carination of a vase with incised decoration, either a bowl of type 9 or a small jar of type 44; the other set below the rim (class A I) of a jar, unless it was from a bowl of type 6, of grey-brown burnished ware. Solid lugs or projections, perhaps from lids, included 2033 with a square top, and 2034. Three fragments from jars, two of them evidently very large, had traces of holes bored through them after firing, presumably for string to mend or strengthen them. 2033. (plate 83) Lug, perhaps from lid. Grey-brown to reddish; very fine burnish. 2034. (plate 83) Lug, perhaps from lid. Shades of light and dark brown; fine burnish. 2035. (Stages 6/8, level 10) Vertical wart, apparently from belly of large jar, as 1926 of stage 7. Outside surface dark brown with reddish tinge, coarsely burnished; inside red, smoothed. (k) bases (2036-2040) (fig. 221) These were normally flat. Five - three apparently from bowls, two from closed vases - were of the differentiated class 8. One fragment (2036) came from a high pedestal base of class 1. Pedestal feet (class 2A) and high ring feet (class 3A) (e.g. 2037-8) were not uncommon; most were evidently from bowls with finely burnished surfaces, grey-brown, or sometimes shades of light and dark brown and red. One pedestal foot was solid (class 2B) like 1332 of Periods V-IV, and may have been an earlier stray; its surface was light to dark brown with fine burnish. Two bowl bases of class 4B were noted (e.g. 2039). 2036. Fragment of pedestal base (class 1 ) . Coarse fabric, with red wash inside and out; inside rough, outside smoothed but not burnished. 2037. 2038. (Level 8) High ring feet (class 3A), from bowls. Grey-brown; fine burnish. Another much larger (diam. c. 15?) is evidently from a closed vase; outside surface purple-brown with fine burnish, inside rough. 2039. (Level 8) Base (class 4B), from bowl. Grey-brown; fine burnish inside and out. 2040. Base (class 6A), from bowl. Red, burnished. DECORATION (2041-2045) This was virtually confined to incision. Pattern burnish. The scrap of rim already described from a bowl of type 8 was clearly an earlier</page><page sequence="90">498 III. EMPORIO stray. But the top of 1989 from a type 1 3 bowl with vertically perforated lug of unusual form has rough pattern burnish, apparently cross-hatching or lattice of some kind. Paint. The only two fragments with white-painted decoration may be earlier strays: one was from the belly of a jug (?) with grey-brown burnished surface showing traces of a pair of broad vertical stripes in white; the other was 1992 from a type 14 bowl. Incision. This was not uncommon, thirty-two fragments having incised designs characteristic of Period II, many of them with traces of white fill. Five or six of these were from type 13 bowls (1987-8, 1990), but incised decoration was also attested on one or two small carinated bowls of type 9 (e.g. 1978). Four incised fragments came from large finely burnished jars, and two others from their lids; some ten from other closed vases, whether jugs or jars; and five or six more from small pyxis-likejars of type 44 (e.g. 2041-2 below). In two instances (1987-8) incised decoration on small type 1 3 bowls was combined with areas left free of burnish as noted on examples of such bowls from levels of Period II in Area A (e.g. 1545). 2041, 2042. (plate 95) Fragments from bodies of small pyxis-likejars of type 44 with vertically perforated horned lugs. Outside surfaces grey-brown or lightish brown with fine burnish, insides rough. Incised decoration including vertical or horizontal rows of diamonds filled with dots. 2043. (plate 95) Fragment, perhaps from ajar of type 44 as 2041-2. Outside surface grey-brown to black with fine burnish, inside rough. Incised decoration: vertical row of diamonds filled with dots, cf. 2041. 2044. (plate 95) Base of small jar or jug. Outside surface shades of dark to light brown, unburnished or with burnish worn; inside rough. 2045. (plate 95) Handle. Shades of light and dark brown to red with fine burnish. Incised decoration: multiple chevrons. Relief. A good many warts were noted. These came from bowls, mostly of the common type 9, and from the bellies of jugs, as well as from jars. Some were large. IMPORTS The large slashed handle 2046 is evidently from an imported vase. 2046. (plate 88) Sandy orange clay, greyish at core; surface worn. Stage 9 Levels 6-4 Amount c. 8 zembils 2047-2109 (figs. 222, 223) Period II: classic, and virtually indistinguishable from stage 8 FABRIC The pottery from levels of stage 9 was similar in fabric to that of stage 8. Fine burnished surfaces were dominantly shades of grey-brown to black, often with a purple tinge; occasionally light brown mottling to red. The marks of the burnishing implement remained visible even when the surface was given a high polish. Surfaces with coarse burnish were in general lighter in colour than finely burnished ones, dominantly shades of light and dark brown and red; while unburnished surfaces were shades of light and dark brown, greyish, and red, the red being clearly due to a wash. One or two sherds seemed to have a thin matt white slip. Insides of closed vases, such as jugs or jars, might be wiped or impressed with some kind of matting like 2047 below. 2047.

Bowls of types 13 and 14 were also still quite well represented, however, and some of them evidently had lug-handles formed by projections rising from the rim with large circular holes through them (fig. 106 no. 8a) as noted in stage 8 and in the Period II horizon in Area A. 4. Open bowls with straight or slightly curving sides Only two or three rims were assignable to this type. 5. Open bowls with curving sides (2048-2051) These and bowls of types 6 and 7 merge into carinated bowls of type 9. Two of the fifteen rims assigned to type 5 had stumps of horizontal side handles set just below them. 6 &amp; 7. Bowls with inward leaning rims (2052-2053) Some half a dozen rims with grey-brown burnished surfaces were assignable to these types, which like type 5 merge into the carinated type 9. 35* 17 J6 J6 357 ^ J6j 2048 M 2049 A 2050 I 2051^ 2052 M 2053 1 J *0k* ... 1^ ^ ®) ^_ 40, „, „_ ,6* bo ' 2054 / B 2056 ^ 2057 M 2058 ■ 2059 ' M - * » * iv B 9 .2. a, 2i&gt; 2067 M W M W * ¡ÕeTfc 2062 l2O63|~| 2065^ X*^ J i f f 2071 Ê f 2064 ^ 2068 &gt;v T F - ^r r^* ' 2075 r 2076 W 2077 2072 2074</page><page sequence="92">500 III. EMPORIO 9. Carinated bowls (2054-2066) Rims of these were commoner than those of all other bowl types put together. Bowls of this type in stage 9 appeared to be indistinguishable from those of stage 8. As in stage 8, while some rims belonged to large bowls with a diameter of over 30, about half appeared to come from small ones with a diameter of 15 or less. Carinated rims of type 9 merged into those of types 5-7, and parts of the rim on the same bowl might be distinctly carinated while other parts were not (e.g. 2060). In the case of small bowls with very fine burnish the carination had often been rounded away by thorough burnishing of the surface. As in stage 8 the burnished surfaces of type 9 bowls were dominantly grey-brown in colour, surfaces with the finest burnish (notably those of small bowls with a diameter of 15 or less) often having a purple tinge; but the surfaces of the largest bowls tended to be shades of light brown or red. In one or two instances type 9 bowls were left unburnished (e.g. 2060). Side handles were noted belonging to type 9 bowls of medium and large size; but none were certainly attributable to small bowls with a diameter of 15 or less. The same apparent dearth of side handles in connection with small type 9 bowls was also observed in stage 8. But 2054 with a diameter of c. 15 has an elegant trumpet lug rising above the rim. Warts do not seem to have been common on the carinations of type 9 bowls, and only about half a dozen examples were noted from levels of stage 9, two of the warts being of the exotic horned type as fig. 193 no. 1 1. 2054. (Level 4) (plate 95) Rim with elegant trumpet lug rising above it. Light brown shading to darker brown, burnished. 2060. (Wall 3) Rim. Very irregular, and in one place without carination. Inside with a thick red wash, smoothed or with poor burnish; outside with a light brown wash, unburnished. 2066. (Level 4) Rim, very roughly made and irregular. Light brown to buff; coarse burnish. 13. Bowls with outward-curving rims, internally differentiated and thickened (2067-2073) Rims of this type were not uncommon. All had finely burnished surfaces, dominantly grey-brown in colour, but with light browns and reds somewhat more in evidence than in the case of carinated bowls of type 9. Two of the rims drawn (2068-9) were somewhat irregular, and might be strays of Period IV; the spring of a base - of classes 2 or 3 perhaps, or of 4 or 8 - is preserved on 2068. At least two lug-handles of the type with a large circular hole through a projection from the rim (fig. 106 no. 8a) belonged to type 13 bowls. Some of the other eight handles of this kind noted from levels of stage 9 may have come from bowls of this type rather than of type 14. Two rims from small type 1 3 bowls had remains of elaborate incised decoration; that illustrated (2073 on plate 91) is c. 15 in diameter with the surface lightish brown to red, burnished but worn; the incisions are unusually light and thin. 14. Bowls with outward-curving rims, not internally differentiated, but sometimes thickened (2074-2077) Rims of these were not rare. The most characteristic tended to have finely burnished surfaces. Some rims assignable to this type with a coarse finish may have belonged to tripod cooking pots. But the small 2076 appears to be from a bowl although it has the lightish purple-brown surface rough and without burnish. Similarly the large 2077 is irregular, with the surface shades of light and dark brown, coarsely burnished outside, without burnish inside. Some of the ten lug-handles, consisting of projections rising from the rim with large circular</page><page sequence="93">3. AREA B. STAGE 9 (PER. II: CLASSIC) 501 holes through them as fig. io6 no. 8a, evidently belonged to bowls of type 14 (cf. 1540, and plate 88 (a)). (b) jugs and tripod cooking pots Jugs Jugs were not well represented. Some fourteen fragments of jug rims were noted, and four of these had remains of handles, of which three sloped into the rim, but only one was set below it in the characteristic Period II manner. Spouts, however, were of the V-shaped or cutaway types standard in Period II. A large fragment from level 6, from a thin- walled jug with a finely burnished light brown surface, had a spout of the cutaway type and a handle with a neat semi-circular section. There were two scraps of sharply ridged jug throats as fig. 217 no. 1 characteristic of Period II. One or two fragments of carinated jug bodies were recovered. The surfaces of jugs with fine burnish were grey-brown with a purple tinge, reddish, or light brown. But some jugs had a poor burnish, and two fragments of jugs with a light brown surface were altogether unburnished. 27. Tripod cooking pots (2078-2079) A good many rims of various kinds, both (A) undifferentiated and (B) differentiated, appeared to come from cooking pots which mostly no doubt had tripod feet as type 27. The rim on the same vase might vary from everted (as class B III f) in one place to upright or inward leaning (class B I- II) in another. Many of the (B) differentiated rims evidently had triangular projections of the kind noted on thirteen stage 8 cooking pot rims; but only one such projection had a vertical wart on it, as opposed to four (nearly a quarter of the total) of those from stage 8. A number of fragments from cooking pots of all sizes had finely burnished surfaces, dominantly red in colour, but shading to light and dark brown, dusky, and purplish. Some rims, especially ones of class All, may have belonged to very large red burnished cooking pots akin to those noted from levels of the succeeding Period I. But other cooking pots it seems were only given a very superficial burnish, or were left without any burnish at all; some fragments of these preserved clear traces of a red wash; but the surfaces of others were shades of light and dark brown to dusky - often, however, with a purplish tinge, which may reflect the application of a red wash transformed in the firing. Tripod feet (e.g. 2078-9 on plate 84) were of various sizes, although none was immense. Some - all burnished, and three of them with finely burnished red surfaces - had more or less neat semi-circular sections. The remaining feet - some of them well burnished, but others without burnish - were for the most part roughly semi-circular in section, but a few were thinnish oval. One foot from level 5, brown with a coarse burnish, was differentiated at the top where it joined the body of the vase (cf. 1585-6). (c) jars (2080-2094) (fig. 223) About twelve rims of classes A I- III (e.g. 2080) had evidently belonged to large store jars cf. types 38-40. The surfaces of these were shades of light or dark brown, or had a red wash; some had a good, others a poor burnish or none at all. One rim, the surface red to light and dark brown with a coarse burnish inside and out, had a vertical strap handle like 1590 from an upper level of Period II in Area A.

Rims of classes A I- II from smaller jars were not uncommon; two had vertical strap handles set below them. Their surfaces were mostly shades of grey-brown, or dark and light brown, with coarse burnish; but some had a red wash, burnished or unburnished. A few rims of class A II, however, resembling 1 596-7 from upper levels of Period II in shape, were of finer fabric with well burnished surfaces, grey-brown or dark purplish brown in colour. A number of rims were of the simple upright type differentiated from the shoulder, as classes B I- II. Most of these (2081-6) belonged to rather small jars, but one or two (e.g. 2087 with a</page><page sequence="95">3. AREA B. STAGE 9 (PER. II: CLASSIC) 503 burnished red wash) came from large ones. A large rim of this kind resembling 1608 from an upper level in Period II in Area A but somewhat thinner, had the clay well fired, brick-red throughout, and the surface red, wiped on the outside, smoothed inside. Small jars with rims of class B I included the complete profile 2086. Several of the rims of this class may have belonged to cooking pots; their surfaces shades of light and dark brown to dusky, usually with rather poor burnish (e.g. 2084). But even a rim like 2081, which is well burnished, appears to come from a cooking pot. Some rims of class B I, however, with finely burnished surfaces (e.g. 2082-3) evidently belonged to small pyxis-like jars cf. type 44, all of which may have had incised decoration like 2085. Class B III rims also covered a wide range in size and fabric. Some, like 2093-4 which have burnished red washes, were evidently from large collar-necked jars of type 47; while others (e.g. 2088-9) came from smaller jars of this general type. At the other end of the scale were little rims with incised decoration (2090-1) from pyxis-like jars akin to type 44. Rims of classes B I- II 2081.

Coarse grey-black clay, light brown at edges; inside surface with a wash, shades of lightish brown and red, unburnished; outside shades of dark and light brown to dusky and reddish with very fine burnish. A narrow band round the base of the neck was left unburnished, as if a piece of material of some kind had been tied in place there at time of burnishing, cf. 2584 from a level of Period I, and 842, 1251, 1403.

Coarse grey-brown clay with large grit; surface light and dark brown to reddish and dusky; rough inside, very poor burnish outside. 5 1 . Double vase One fragment of a double vase was recognised; the outside surface of this was grey-brown, burnished, with traces of incised decoration. (e) pithoi (2096, 2097) Fragments included a scrap of rim (2096) of a type characteristic of Period II, and a ribbed handle (2097). The handle belonged with a fragment from the join of shoulder and neck; at the base of the neck on this was a rib in relief with diagonal cuts on it.</page><page sequence="96">504 III. EMPORIO 2096. (Level 5) Rim, as 1642 from an upper level of Period II in Area A. Hard coarse grey clay, reddish at edges; abundant straw and grit showing in surface, which has a red wash with very poor burnish. 2097. (Level 6) Handle with rib, as fig. 108 no. 14. Surface with a purple wash, smoothed. (f) lids (2098-2 10 i ) (fig. 223) Fragments of lids and covers of types 60 and 63 were noted. The knob 2101 may come from a cover with 'crown' handle of type 64. 2098. (Level 4) (plate 93) Flat lid (type 60). About half preserved. Grey-brown, unburnished on under side; upper side burnished, and decorated with fine incision: six groups of multiple chevrons; traces of white fill. 2099. (Level 6) (plate 96) Flat lid (type 60), with two opposite pairs of string-holes. Parts round one pair of these missing. Diam. 8.4. Brown clay, lightish on under side, rather darker on upper side; poor burnish. 2100. (Level 6) Horned lug from cover (type 63). Grey-brown, burnished. 2101. (Level 4) Knob, perhaps from point of intersection of handles of flanged cover of type 64 B. Grey-brown, burnished. (i) HANDLES AND LUGS (1) Bowls Side handles from bowls were common, some being rounded in shape as fig. 107 no. 1 , but many pointed as no. 2. In section most were more or less circular, but the sections of one or two approximated to thin oval, and one small handle was rectangular. Some ten fragments were noted belonging to lug-handles of the type formed by projections rising from rims of bowls of types 13 and 14 with large circular holes through them (fig. 106 nos. 8a, 8b). (2) Jugs and jars etc. There were many vertical handles from jugs and jars; these were of all sizes, and often had finely burnished surfaces, grey-brown, light brown, or red. Two, one of them very small, were elegantly tapered. In section these handles were mostly rather thin oval, sometimes thicker oval, occasionally semi-circular or lunate. The comparative rarity of semi-circular or lunate-sectioned handles no doubt reflects the scarcity of remains of jugs in deposits of stage 9 as compared with their abundance in those of Period II in Area A. Two handles, one of them - apparently from a pithos - with a red wash, were rectangular in section. Two thin strap-like handles were recovered from level 4: one with the surface light brown to reddish, unburnished; the other with a finely burnished grey-brown surface, sloping into the rim of a jug, or perhaps of a bowl of the dipper cup type 16. A small ribbed handle surmounted by a wart from level 4, the burnished surface grey-brown with a reddish tinge, appears to be a stray of Periods V-IV. Only one example of a 'pushed-through' handle was recognised; this again no doubt reflects the relative scarcity of jug remains in deposits of stage 9. Side handles from jars were circular in section. One from level 6 of the slashed type as 1 7 1 7 of Period II has the surface light brown with traces of a red wash in places; it may come from an imported vase or from a local imitation of one. Lugs from jars or their lids were of the horned type, perforated or solid. (k) BASES (2 102-2 IO5) (FIG. 223) These were usually flat as class 6C, but sometimes as class 6A (e.g. 2102). There were several</page><page sequence="97">3. AREA B. STAGE 10 (PER. II: LATE?) 505 pedestal and high ring feet (classes 2 A and 3A), mostly it seems from bowls, but some from jars (e.g. 2086). Some bases of large bowls were of the differentiated class 8. Sunk bases were not much in evidence, but one (2103) of the rare class 5D was noted. A small solid foot (2105) with grey-brown burnished surface evidently came from a pyxis-like jar cf. type 44 (plate 93). 2102. (Level 6) (plate 96) Pedestal foot (class 2A), from bowl. Light brown; fine burnish inside and out. 2103. (Wall 3) Sunk base (class 5D), from bowl. Grey-brown; fine burnish. 2104. (Level 4) Flat base (class 6A), from jar. Brown, with coarse burnish outside; rough inside. DECORA TION (2 1 06-2 1 09) Incision. This was dominant as in stage 8, being represented on more than twenty fragments, coming from bowls of types 13 and 14, large jars of fine burnished ware with carinated bellies, some jugs and jars of smaller size (e.g. 2 106-7), and small pyxis-like jars (e.g. 2108) and their lids. The fragment 2 106 had areas reserved from burnish contrasting with burnished areas serving as a ground for white-filled incised decoration, as found on a number of type 1 3 bowls from levels of stage 8 (1987-8) and of Period II in Area A. The motifs of incised decoration were ones characteristic of Period II, including multiple chevrons (e.g. 2108), cross-hatched triangles (e.g. 2107), and areas or bands filled with dots (e.g. 2106). The incisions were sometimes light and fine, as on the lid 2098; in a few instances they were very shallow, amounting to grooves or channels. 2 1 06. (Level 6) (plate 93) Fragment from jug or jar. Inside greyish, rough; outside grey-brown, with parts occupied by incised decoration burnished, rest of surface reserved without burnish. Incisions with traces of white fill. 2107. (Wall 3) (plate 93) Fragment from belly of jug or jar. Inside greyish, roughly smoothed; outside chestnut brown with very fine polish-like burnish. 2108. (Level 4) (plate 95) Fragment from belly of small jug or pycis-like jar with sharp carination. Inside rough; outside shades of light to dark brown with fine polish-like burnish Relief. This was virtually confined to warts on type 9 bowls and on the bellies of jugs or jars. The warts were mostly large, and normally circular, but sometimes upturned or vertical. Upturned warts occurred on large bowls of type 9, but two small upturned warts from levels 6 and 5 appeared to come from jugs,their surfaces rough inside, grey-brown with fine burnish outside. A flat-topped disc wart resembling 1800 of Period II evidently adorned the belly of a large jug or jar, the inside surface being rough, the outside light brown to red with coarse burnish. A group of three vertical ribs decorated a fragment (2 109) from the body of a large jug or jar from level 4; the inside of this was rough, the outside light brown with fine burnish. IMPORTS The handle of the slashed type already described might have come from an imported jar, but from the fabric it could be classed as a local imitation. Stage 10 Levels 3-1 Amount c. 9 zembils 21 10-2 1 71 (figs. 224, 225) Mixed, but dominantly Period II: late (?)</page><page sequence="98">fig. 224. Area B. Stage 10. Bowls. Scale 1/3. 506 III. EMPORIO GENERAL In levels of this deposit there was a certain amount of intrusive wheelmade pottery, including Mycenaean and some Greco-Roman. But no wheelmade pottery of the type in use during Period I was recognised, with the possible exception of the rim 2134 described under type 14. The virtual absence of Period I wheelmade pottery suggests that the deposit as a whole belongs to Period II, even if to an advanced phase of it. In general the pottery from levels of stage 10 resembled that of the preceding stage 9. But there were possible signs of an improvement in firing, a good many sherds being of hard fabric and fired an even colour throughout. Moreover orange, reddish, and dull brown surfaces, with poor burnish or none at all, were much in evidence. Sherds described came from level 3 unless otherwise stated. (a) bowls (fig. 224) 4. Open bowls with straight or slightly curving sides (2 1 10-2 1 1 1 ) The only two rims assignable to this type had well burnished surfaces, shades of grey-brown to purplish (21 10), and light brown to red (21 1 1). 5. Open bowls with curving sides (21 12) About ten rims from bowls of all sizes, some of them small as 21 12, were assignable to this type. All were burnished, with surfaces mostly grey-brown, but once at least light brown. wrpyfrr '{ - - ^^ m - ^ - i - k - à *-* ^-y -■ - -j ■ M 2121 M 2122 ■ 2123« 2124 1 2125» 2126 J M N^-_J^^ 'y i / / W / g / 2120 N^-_J^^ W g - - -m ^-M ^-a JS-m X2128 212^213^^ * ■ y'y i / ^ ^j_ V * #2134 ^136 ^2137</page><page sequence="99">3. AREA B. STAGE 10 (PER. II: LATE?) 507 6 &amp; 7. Bowls with inward-leaning rims (21 13-21 16) Rims of these were not uncommon. They came from bowls of all sizes, some of them evidently very large. Several rims had the stumps of side handles set just below them. Light brown and reddish surfaces appeared to be more in evidence on bowls of these types than they were on carina ted bowls of type 9. 9. Carinated bowls (2 1 1 7-2 1 26) The rims of these were abundant, exceeding those of all other bowl types put together in the proportion of about 3:2. Carinations were often rounded by burnishing, so that the line of division between bowls of this type and ones of types 6 and 7 was somewhat indeterminate. About half a dozen rims preserved stumps of side handles set on or below their carinations (e.g. 21 19). One large rim had an upturned wart like 1965 of stage 8. Four other type 9 rims with warts were noted; one of these (21 18) was roughly made and had a burnished red wash. The burnished surfaces were dominantly grey-brown, however, although shades of lighter brown or red were not uncommon. 12. Bowls with straight rims, thickened and usually differentiated on the inside (2127) One rim with incised decoration on the inside was assignable to this type. 2127. (No level) Shades of grey-brown to purplish brown; rather coarse burnish. Inside with boldly incised zigzag; traces of white fill. 13. Bowls with outward-curving rims, internally differentiated and thickened (2 128-2 130) These were evidently not common, and only one (2130) out of the half dozen rims assignable to type 13 had incised decoration. 2 1 28. (Levels 4, 3) Rim. Well and evenly made; surface shades of light and dark brown, finely burnished but worn. 2129. (Level 1) Rim as 2128, but smaller and less regular. 2130. (Level 1) Rim of small bowl. Surface presumably grey-brown or light brown, burnished but worn. 14. Bowls with outward-curving rims, not internally differentiated, but sometimes thickened (2 13 1-2 138) A few rims assignable to this type were finely burnished and evidently came from bowls (e.g. 2131-2). But the larger number belonged to a distinctive class of coarse burnished ware (e.g. 2134-7). Some or all of these were probably from cooking pots, whether from ones with tripod feet as type 27 or not. These cooking pot rims tended to be small, and to have a distinct bead; they were for the most part rather roughly made and irregular, of coarse fabric, with burnished surfaces shades of dark and light brown to red. The large rim 2134, however, assigned to this class, was of noticeably superior fabric, and apparently better fired, although with poor burnish; it was reminiscent of rims of some wheelmade vases of Period I, and might have come from one. The rim 2 1 38 with a projection rising from it and elaborate incised decoration may be a stray of Periods V-IV. 2 1 31. Rim. Grey-brown; fine burnish. 2132. Rim. Outside dark purple-brown with fine burnish; inside red, less well burnished. 2133. Rim with large upturned wart below it. Gritty orange clay; surface light brown, burnished. 2138. (Level 1) (plate 91) Rim, with spring of projection, perhaps of lug-handle of type with large circular hole through it as fig. 106 nos. 8 a, 8 b. Surface light brown to red, burnished. Incised decoration: zigzags round outside and inside of rim; diagonal band of dot-filled lozenges on outside. Possibly a stray of Periods V-IV.</page><page sequence="100">508 iii. emporio (b) jugs and tripod cooking pots Not many rims of these were recovered from levels of stage io; but in the four instances where the stumps of handles were preserved they were set below the rim in the characteristic Period II manner. The only two spouts were both of the cutaway type. One fragment of a sharply ridged throat was noted, the surface being grey-brown with fine burnish. Other jug fragments had surfaces shades of grey-brown, light brown and reddish. 2 7 . Tripod cooking pots ( 2 1 39-2 141) A good many rims evidently belonged to cooking pots of one type or another. Some rims of coarse burnished ware assigned to type 14 bowls, as well as others described under jars, both (A) undifferentiated and (B) differentiated, may have come from them. Surfaces were shades of light and dark brown, or red due to a wash, varying to dusky and purplish; usually smoothed or with coarse burnish. One rim (2 1 39) of class B II with a burnished red wash appeared to be from a large cooking pot of the type found in the horizon of Period I. This had a slight triangular projection rising from it; and similar projections were noted on two other rims, one of which (2 140) from level 2 with the stump of a vertical handle set below it also had a burnished red wash. A small rim (2 141 ) also from level 2 and with a red wash had a distinct bead and a vertical wart on the outside. The tripod legs recovered were all more or less oval in section and of rather coarse fabric, their surfaces shades of brown, apparently unburnished. (C) JARS (2 I42-2 I57) (FIG. 225) There were some four rims from large store jars of types 39-40, one from ajar of type 40 having a vertical handle below it; all appeared to show traces of a red wash with poor burnish. Rims of smaller jars of classes A I- III were not uncommon, those of class A II being most in evidence. One class A I rim had a vertical handle set below it; one (2149) of class A III was thickened and differentiated on the inside. All these jar rims were of coarse burnished ware, their surfaces shades of grey-brown or brown, or red due to a wash. Some rims of classes A II- III may have belonged to cooking pots of one type or another. A few rims of classes B I- III evidently came from collar-necked jars akin to types 45-47 (2150, 2154-5). Some smaller rims of classes B I- II (e.g. 2152-3) belonged to pyxis-like jars cf. type 44 of very fine burnished ware. The small rim 2156 of class B III a: variety 2 with its elaborate incised decoration must come from ajar of similar kind. Another small rim 2159 of class B III had incised decoration consisting of a row of dot-filled diamonds like a couple of rims (2090-1) of stage 9. Rims of classes A I- II 2 142. (Level 2) Clay with grit, some very large; abundant mica showing in surface, which shades of light brown with coarse burnish. The mica suggests that this may be from an import, although the fabric is otherwise indistinguishable from that of local wares. 2143. Surface with a red wash, shading to dusky brown; poor burnish. 2144. Surface grey-brown to dusky; coarse burnish.

(f) lids (2 i 59-2 i 63) (fig. 225) One or two fragments evidently came from covers of type 63 (e.g. 2160). There were also fragments of flanged covers of type 64, two of them very large (2 16 1-2). Some perforated lugs of the horned class like 2165-6 may have come from lids. 2160. (No level) Cover (type 63) with perforated lugs. Grey-brown, burnished. 2 1 6 1 . (Levels 3, 2) (plate 96) Large flanged cover (type 64B) . About one quarter of rim preserved. Ht. 1 o. Diam. 34. Stumps of what appear to have been crown-like handles which crossed above centre. Outside surface with fine burnish, dominantly purplish, shading to red and light and dark brown; inside shades of brown, roughly smoothed. A hole made after firing may be for string to strengthen or mend the cover. Another (2162) similar with surface grey-brown, burnished inside and out. A fragment of a smaller cover (diam. 1 1) of this type had a light brown burnished surface with traces of incised decoration. Other fragments from levels of stage 10 may have come from such covers. 2163. (plate 96) Knob, apparently from lid. Surface grey-brown, burnished. Similar knobs appear on simple lids of the Red period at Poliochni (Poliochni i 645 pl. clix). Brea notes that lids with knobs of this type were also at home in the Gumelnitsa culture of the Balkans. Part of a lid of this kind, but with incised decoration, was recovered at Thermi (Thermi 1 14 no. 267 pl. xxix: 1, Town III). (i) HANDLES AND LUGS (1) Bowls Side handles from bowls were common as in stage 9, many of them being pointed (fig. 107 no. 2), and one ogival (no. 3) in shape like 1699 of Period II in Area A. These handles were normally more or less circular or thick oval in section; but two of pointed and one of rounded shape had roughly rectangular sections. (2) Jugs and jars etc. (2 164-2 166) Vertical handles, all apparently from jugs or jars, included one or two neatly triangular or semi-circular in section, and two or three which were markedly lunate. Three handles were thin wide straps, their surfaces grey-brown to reddish, or light brown, with traces of fine burnish. One handle from the shoulder of a large jar (the outside surface shades of light and dark brown to purple-brown and red with fine burnish, the inside rough) was elegantly splayed at top and bottom.</page><page sequence="103">3. AREA B. STAGE 10 (PER. II: LATE?) 511 Large side handles, apparently from jars, included a fragment of a 'winged handle' (2164), and a twisted handle like 171 7 of Period II, apparently from an imported vase. Some perforated lugs of the horned class as fig. 106 no. 31 e belonged to small pyxis-like jars and their lids. The flanged cover 2161, and a fragment from a large jug or jar from level 2, had rivet-holes bored after firing. 2164. (fig. 225. plate 88) Tip of winged handle. Neat and elegant. Surface light brown with traces of fine burnish, but worn. 2165. (plate 95) Perforated lug of horned class. Possibly from a bowl. Thin; surface light brown with very fine burnish. 2166. (plate 95) Perforated lug of horned class. Probably from a lid or cover. Surface grey-brown, burnished but worn. (k) bases (2 167-2 i 71) (fig. 225) As in stage 9 these were normally flat, bases of classes 6B and C occurring on both open and closed vases; but one large bowl had a base of class 6A. Pedestal bases (class 2A), and ring feet, high and low, as classes 3A and 4A, were also in evidence. At least one fragment (2167) came from a large pedestal of class 1 . 2167. Fragment of large pedestal (class 1 ) ; trace of opening. Grey clay with fine grit; silvery mica, and straw showing in surface, which greyish brown, evenly burnished, outside; inside light brown to reddish, without burnish. Fabric and finish are suggestive of an earlier period (VII-VI ?); but the fragment may come from an imported vase in view of the mica in it. 2168. Pedestal foot (class 2A), apparently from a bowl. Darkish brown, burnished. 2169. (plate 96) Pedestal foot (class 2A). Sandy clay fired red-brown throughout; some mica showing in surface, which worn, but may not have been burnished. Possibly from an import in view of the mica. 2170. Pedestal foot (class 2A). Grey-brown, burnished. 2 1 71. High ring foot (class 3A), from a bowl. Grey-brown, burnished. DECORATION This was dominantly incised, as in stage 9. But ribs in relief occurred on large jars or pithoi, and the scrap described below suggests a contemporary if rare use of pattern burnish. Pattern burnish. One scrap, evidently from a jar, the burnished outside surface dark purple-brown, appeared to have deliberate pattern burnish in the shape of diagonal lines crossing to form lattice-work. Incision. This was the most common form of decoration and was indistinguishable in character from that of stage 9. Relief. Warts occurred as in stage 9, but only one was certainly from the belly of a jug. Some upturned warts were noted on type 9 bowls. A vertical wart appears on the outside of the small cooking pot rim 2 141. Two fragments of large jars or pithoi had ribs in relief: one decorated with diagonal cuts, the other with finger tip impressions along it. IMPORTS A large handle of the slashed type appears to come from an imported vase. This was semi-circular in section like 1719 of Period II in Area A. The vase to which it belonged was evidently thin-walled, the clay sandy with mica in it, grey at the core, light brown at the edges; the inside surface being wiped, the outside having a pale greenish matt wash.</page><page sequence="104">512 III. EMPORIO Traces of mica were noted in the clay of a number of other fragments from levels of stage io (e.g. 2142, 2149, 2153, 2167, 2169); but these may not all come from imported vases, since in other respects they were indistinguishable in fabric from the obviously local wares. ii. Area G The bulk of the pottery described below came from the main eastern series of trenches in the area (C. 1 ) . But later phases of the Bronze Age after Period II were only preserved in the two trenches HHandJJin Area C. 3. (a) AREA C. 1 A large amount of material from the upper levels (6-1 ) in these trenches was of post-Bronze Age date. The latest Bronze Age deposits here were assignable to Period II (levels 1 2-7) . Level 1 3 was evidently the destruction horizon of Period IV, and level 14 below it could be referred to an early phase of IV or to V. Stage 1 Levels 14 and 13 Amount c. 6 zembils 2172-2235 (fig. 226) Periods V/IV (level 14), and IV destruction (level 13) GENERAL The bulk of the material of this stage came from trench LL, and largely from level 14 there. The rims drawn and described are from LL level 14 unless otherwise stated. SHAPES (a) bowls (2 i 72-22 i 2) Types 4 (2172-3); 5 (2174-7); 6 (2176-9); 7 (2180-2); 9A (2183-92) 9 B (2193-5); 9 0(2196-7); 90(2198-2201); 11 (2202); 12 (2203); 13 (2204-8); 13/14(2209); 14 (2210-12). About a hundred bowl rims were recovered from levels 14 and 13 in LL, and half of these were of the carinated type 9. These type 9 rims varied in diameter from c. 15 to 40 or more, and closely resembled ones from levels of Periods V-I V in Area A; one from LL level 1 4 had a vertical strap handle like 10 18 of Period V-IV, and the stumps of side handles were preserved on others. Warts were not uncommon on rims of type 9, and included one of the horned class as fig. 193 no. 11. One type 9 rim had a trumpet lug as fig. 191 no. 3 a, but with the waist apparently sunk below the line of the rim, which was, however, very irregular, grey-brown to black, burnished. Most of the eight rims assignable to type 4 were thickened like 2173, and one of these thickened rims had a vertically perforated lug on the outside. Rims of types 5-7 merged into those of type 9. One type 5 rim preserved the stump of a side handle. A single rim (2202 described below) was assignable to type 1 1 .</page><page sequence="105">fig. 226. Area C. i. Stage i (Periods V/IV and IV).

EMPORIO Rims of the distinctive type 1 3 were in evidence. Several of these, and some of the related type 14, bore incised decoration. One of type 13, elaborately decorated with incision including a chain of dot-filled lozenges on the inside, had a long horizontal lug outside; the incised design on the outside of this rim and on most of the other decorated rims of types 13 and 14 consisted of a single zigzag (e.g. 2208 described below). The rim of a large type 13 bowl from FF level 13 was adorned with a double zigzag as fig. i 14 no. 5 inside and out. The rim 2207 from a small bowl of this type had a trumpet lug on the outside (plate 58). Some rims may have belonged to dipper cups of type 16. 2202. (FF 13) Rim (type 1 1) with horizontally perforated lug. Grey-brown to black; very fine burnish. This type of bowl rim was characteristic of Periods VII-VI in Area A; but the fabric and condition suggest that 2202 is of contemporary date (Periods V-IV). 2206. (FF 13) Rim (type 13). Irregular. Light to dark brown; coarse burnish. 2208. (FF 13) (plate 97) Rim (type 13). Shades of dark brown and red-brown; fine burnish. Incised decoration: single zigzag on inside of rim; dot-filled design outside; white fill. 2209. (FF 13) Rim, cf. types 13 or 14. Grey-brown to black; fine burnish. Incised decoration: zigzag on inside of rim; white fill. 221 1. (FF 13) Rim (type 14). Irregular. Light brown mottling to red and dusky; rather coarse burnish. (b) jugs and tripod cooking pots Jugs Fragments of these were shades of dark and light brown and red; outside surfaces might be well burnished, or have coarse burnish or sometimes none at all. Seven scraps of rim were recovered. A spout of the simple pointed type as fig. 175 no. 1 A from level 13 in LL had a red wash, smoothed but not burnished. A rim from FF level 13, the surface grey-brown to purplish with very fine burnish, retained the stump of a high-swung handle decorated with white-filled incised decoration; it may have belonged to a jug of type 23 B like 11 58 of Period IV. Two or three fragments of carinated bodies evidently came from jugs; one from level 14 in LL had a strongly emphasised carination which continued as a ridge up each side of the handle. 2 7 . Tripod cooking pots There were ten tripod feet from deposits of this stage - an average of less than two per zembil. Most were oval in section, but one was roughly semi-circular; one at least was square-ended like a few from levels of Period II in Area A (e.g. 1 582-3) . Some jar rims of classes A I - II, B I- II and B III f, may have belonged to cooking pots with or without tripod feet; several had vertical warts on the outside. (c) jars (2213-2232) Rims of class A I (2213-6); A II (2217-22); A I/III (2223-4); B Ï 2225-6); B III (2227-32). Surfaces were in general shades of dusky black and dark and light brown to reddish, with a coarse burnish or in many cases none at all. Fine burnish seems to have been more or less confined to collar-necked jars like 2226 and 2228. Rims of classes A I- II were common; some of the larger evidently came from store jars of types 38-39 (e.g. 2213, 2217), while many of the smaller may have belonged to tripod cooking pots (e.g. 2214-5, 2219, 2221); one or two (e.g. 2220) had vertical strap handles set below them. Two class A II rims were thickened and internally differentiated like 1 228-1 230. Several of</page><page sequence="107">3. AREA C. STAGE 1 (PERS. V- IV) 515 classes A I- III had vertical warts on the outside (e.g. 2223-4 on plate 75). A pair of warts is preserved on 2231. The rim 2232 has a vertical wart like an upturned nose as fig. 193 no. 8. Descriptions of selected rims: 2213. Class A I. Inside surface red, outside shades of dusky purple-brown, smoothed but not burnished. 2216. Class A I. Surface light purple-grey with burnish on outside. 2217. Class A II. Surface with a wash, dark purple-brown inside, reddish to purple-brown outside, wiped. 2218. Class A II. Surface reddish to purple-brown, smoothed or wiped, but not burnished. 2220. Class All, with stump of vertical handle. Surface light brown to red, much worn, but apparently once burnished. 2225. Class B I. Inside surface red, outside light brown to dusky, with coarse burnish. 2226. Class B I. Grey-brown, well burnished. 2227. (FF 13) Class B III a: variety 1. Grey clay, light brown at edges; surface with a red wash, smoothed. Rivet-hole made after firing at base of neck. 2228. Class B III a: variety 3. Grey-brown, burnished. 2229. Class B III c. Surface with a wash, red to dark purple-brown, burnished, outside; red without burnish inside. 2230. (FF 13) Class B III c. Irregular. Light brown, burnished. (e) pithoi Rims and handles recovered were of types characteristic of Periods V-I V in Area A. A ribbed handle from level 14 in LL resembled that on 1291 and had a red wash. (f) lids (2233) The fragment 2233 from FF level 13 appears to come from the top of a lid with a knob at the centre (plate 97). The surface of this is light brown shading to darker brown, burnished inside and out, with incised decoration. (i) HANDLES AND LUGS (2234) (1) Bowls Vertical handles occurred on bowls, but horizontal side handles were more usual, one or two of these being of the horned class as fig. 107 no. 5. There were four examples of horizontal trumpet lugs on bowls; three of these had been set on or slightly below the rims of carinated bowls of type 9; the fourth was the elegant 2207 below the rim of a small bowl of type 13 (plate 58). A rim (2234) apparently from a bowl of type 14, with a light brown burnished surface, had a horned projection rising from it with a horizontally perforated lug below (plate 70) reminiscent of 1898 from Area B, and others on bowls of type 1 3 from the Period IV destruction level in Area A (e.g. 1073, 1 081. fig. 106 no. 23 etc.). A vertically perforated lug of the simple type (fig. 106 no. 32 a) was preserved below a thickened rim of type 4. (2) Jugs and jars etc. Vertical handles from jugs or jars were mostly lunate, thin oval, or sub-rectangular in section; only two of these handles were surmounted by warts, but one or two had traces of incised decoration. A fragment of a small pyxis-like jar with incised decoration had a vertically perforated wart as fig. 106 no. 31 c.</page><page sequence="108">516 III. EMPORIO (k) bases These were normally flat as classes 6A and B. The only sunk base was of class 5C, and apparently came from a bowl. A fragment with a burnished red wash from FF level ?iß evidently belonged to a pedestal foot (class 2A) with four circular holes or windows in it. DECORATION Incision. Motifs were reminiscent of those current in Periods V-IV in Area A. One jar fragment with traces of a red wash had a design identical with that on the large jar 1 23 1 of Period IV. The fragment 2235 with a boldly incised zigzag on the carination evidently came from a very large jar, a fore-runner perhaps of the jars with finely burnished surfaces and elaborate incised decoration characteristic of Period II. The boldly incised zigzag on the carination of this was apparently made after the burnishing and firing of the vase, which is unusual. 2235. (FF 13) (plate 97) Carinated fragment. Clay grey-brown at core, light brown at edges; surface with a wash, light purplish, roughly burnished or smoothed, inside; shades of dark brown and red, burnished, outside. Zigzag apparently cut after vase burnished and fired. Relief. Warts occurred on vases of all kinds, but especially it seems on jugs. A fragment from FF level 14, apparently from ajar, the inside surface light to dark brown, wiped or coarsely burnished, the outside light brown with traces of burnish, had a horseshoe in relief like fig. 194 no. 1. Stage 2 Level 12 Amount c. 5 zembils 2236-2245 (fig. 227) Period II: early phase (?), with some admixture of IV. GENERAL While this deposit was basically of Period II, and apparently reflected an early phase of it, some Period IV material seems to have become mixed with it. SHAPES (a) bowls (2236-2242) One rim with holes through it belonged to a baking pan of type 3. Little bowls of fine burnished ware of types 5-7 (e.g. 2237-9), and small carinated bowls of type 9 of similar fabric (e.g. 2240), resembled those characteristic of Period II in Area A. Several other type 9 rims were like 1465 of Period II, or like 1 5 1 2 with an oval wart on the carination. But one rim of a type 9 carinated bowl with a finely burnished grey-brown surface had a vertical strap handle like 1018 assigned to Periods V-IV. The rim 2242 from a type 13 bowl with vertical handle may also be a Period IV stray. 2236. Rim (type 5). Very irregular. Surface with a wash, red to light brown, mottling to dark purple-brown, smoothed but not burnished. 2237. Rim (type 5). Grey-brown; fine burnish.</page><page sequence="109">fig. 227. Area C. i.

Two at least of these were square-ended like 1582-3 of Period II in Area A. (C) JARS (2243-2244) The rim 2243 with a pair of vertical warts appears to come from a cooking pot of some kind. 2243. (plate 75) Rim (class A III) , with pair of vertical warts . Surface dark brown to purple-brown; coarse burnish. 2244. Rim (class Billa: variety 2) Coarse orange clay, fired an even colour throughout; surface with abundant straw impressions and traces of red wash on outside. (f) lids A scrap of a cover resembling 1 297 (type 62) of Period IV had the outside surface light brown to red, burnished, and an unburnished red wash on the inside. (i) HANDLES AND LUGS (2245) (1) Bowls Vertical handles were noted on a bowl of type 9 and one of type 13. Side handles included one of ogival shape as fig. 107 no. 3 with a light brown burnished surface. One side handle had a neat square section. The two trumpet lugs from this deposit evidently came from bowls; one with a medial rib like fig. 191 nos. 1 b, 2 b, may be a Period IV stray. (2) Jugs and jars etc. The small handle 2245, °f grey-black clay, red-brown at the edges, with a red wash, is</page><page sequence="110">518 III. EMPORIO surmounted by a disc-shaped wart. An Early Bronze Age handle from Vardaroftsa looks similar (PMac i8ofig. 52 (ii) e (Argissaiiipl. 83: 18)). A perforated lug of the horned class as fig. 106 no. 3 1 e evidently belonged to a small pyxis-like jar. A large solid horned lug akin to 1 664 from levels of Period II in Area A, the surface light brown with traces of a purple-brown to red wash, wiped not burnished, may have come from a lid. (k) bases Two pedestal feet (class 2 A) were noted. DECORATION Incision. Some fragments had simple incised decoration of a kind with parallels both in Period IV and in II. Stage 3 Levels 1 1-7 Amount c. 10 zembils 2246-2301 (figs. 228, 229) Period II: classic GENERAL The largest deposit of pottery assignable to this horizon came from level 1 1 in NN. But a number of complete or nearly complete vases were recovered from AA in a level which seemed to correspond to 8 in LL. (a) bowls (2246-2269) (fig. 228) Carinated bowls of type 9 were much in evidence. Rims of these formed nearly one half (23 out of some 53) of the bowl rims from level 1 1 in NN. The type 9 rims of this horizon had profiles characteristic of Period II. Some came from large bowls, notably two from level 1 1 in NN resembling 1482 of Period II, with finely burnished surfaces shades of light and dark brown to red; but most were from small bowls with diameters of c. 15 or less. Some type 9 rims (e.g. 2559) had characteristically large warts on the carination. One (2260) was unique in being decorated with hatching in matt red paint. Bowls of type 1 3 were also much in evidence, although not as common as those of type 9. One or two were evidently decorated with incision. Five or six rims (e.g. 2261-2) appeared to come from unusually steep-sided bowls of type 1 3 A. Four or five rims from bowls of types 1 3 or 14 had traces of lug-handles of the type formed by projections with large circular holes through them, as fig. 106 nos. 8 a, 8 b. 2246. (NN 11) Rim (type 5), with stump of side handle. Light brown, burnished. Another similar; the inside light brown, wiped; outside light brown to reddish, apparently unburnished. 2247.

(b) jugs and tripod cooking pots Characteristic features of Period II jugs found in levels of stage 3 included spouts with a ridge or carination down the front (e.g. 1575) and handles set below the tops of rims. Four spouts from NN level 1 1 had warts on the tip, like 1575-6; one of these, with an unburnished red wash, had a ridge down the front like 1575 and the rim cutaway at the sides like 1576. 2 1 . Tripod cooking pots Some forty or fifty fragments of feet from tripod cooking pots were noted. These were of all sizes, one or two being very large; at least one was square-ended like 1582-3 of Period II in Area A. Cooking pot feet tended to be oval in section, but some were roughly lunate, and one from AA level ?8 had a neat sharp-edged lunate section. A very large foot from NN level 1 1 was sharply triangular in section; it was coated with a red wash, and may have come from a large cooking pot of red burnished ware like those from the horizon of Period I in Area F. Rims and fragments with a red wash, unburnished or with coarse burnish, may have belonged to cooking pots, whether provided with tripod feet or not. One or two of these rims rose in a low triangular projection, while others had vertical warts, some exaggeratedly long, on the outside.</page><page sequence="113">fig. 229. Area C. i.

(f) lids (2285-2288) (fig. 229) Fragments of several lids were noted. These included 2285-7 of type 60, and the handle 2228 from a flanged cover of type 64 A. A fragment from CC level ?8 apparently came from a large cover (diameter c. 25 ?) of type 63: the outside surface finely burnished, shades of light and dark brown with a slight purplish tinge, both shape and fabric being characteristic of Period II. Another fragment of a smaller type 63 cover from AA level ?8, with a finely burnished grey-brown surface, had a solid triangular lug like 1669 and was decorated with white-filled incision. 2285.

(i) HANDLES AND LUGS (1) Bowls Side handles of bowls might be ogival in shape as fig. 107 no. 3. One scrap from AA level ?8 with light brown burnished surface appeared to come from a handle of horned shape as fig. 107 no. 5. The only trumpet lug noted presumably came from a bowl. Four or five bowl rims of types 1 3 or 14 had remains of projecting lug-handles with large circular holes through them as fig. 106 nos. 8 a, 8 b. (2) Jugs and jars etc. Vertical handles included some with thin lunate sections. One very wide handle, measuring 4.6 across, from NN level 1 1 , with an unusually thin oval, virtually flat strap-like section, was of hard fabric, the surface grey-brown, finely burnished. Two ribbed handles as fig. 108 no. 13 were recovered; one from CC level ?8 was of characteristic Period II fabric, with purple-brown burnished surface. A large handle (AA level ?8) from ajar with coarsely burnished red wash had</page><page sequence="115">3. AREA C. STAGE 3 (PER. II: CLASSIC) 523 a hole made before firing through the top end like a number of handles of Periods IX-VI in Area A (see fig. 104). Lugs included some from small pyxis-like jars as fig. 106 no. 31 e. One from AA level ?8 resembling fig. 106 no. 31 c came from a bowl of types 13 or 14. (k) bases (2289-2291) (fig. 229) These included four or five pedestal or high ring feet of classes 2 A and 3A (e.g. 2289, 2290), and some bases of class 8 characteristic of Period II (e.g. 2291). A base of class 5D like 1747 of Period II in Area A was recovered from NN level 1 1 . 2289. (NN 1 1) Pedestal foot (class 2A). Grey-brown with a strong purple tinge, burnished. 2290. (GC level ?8) High ring foot (class 3A). Grey-brown with a reddish shading to purple tinge, burnished. 2291. (NN 11) Flat differentiated base (class 8A). Grey-brown, burnished. DECORATION (2292-2298) This was mostly incised, but some examples of decoration in matt red paint were noted. Paint. The rim 2260 from a carinated bowl of type 9 had vertical hatching in matt red. An unburnished area coated with matt red paint contrasts with a zone of burnish acting as the field for incised decoration on the shoulder of the small closed vase 2298 below. Incision. This was common, and was often used for elaborate designs in the manner of Period II. Dot-filled bands and lozenges were much in evidence, together with reed-made circles (e.g. 2292) which were extremely rare as a motif of decoration before Period II in Area A. A number of fragments, mostly from NN level 1 1 , belonged to large jars with finely burnished surfaces and very rich incised decoration (e.g. 2292-6) as characteristic of Period II. Two fragments of smaller vases displayed the Period II system of decoration by means of burnished areas acting as a field for incised decoration and contrasting with areas which were reserved without burnish. One of these (AA level ?8), a scrap apparently from the rim of a large bowl of types 13 or 14, had incised decoration (double chevrons or zigzags) on the inside contrasting with a reserved area there without burnish. In the case of the other more elaborate example, 2298 below, the unburnished area was coated with matt red paint as already mentioned. 2292. (NN 1 1 ) (plate 97) Fragments of large jar, to which the rim 2274 may have belonged. Sides in places as much as 1 .5 thick. Fairly hard fabric. Gritty clay, greyish to orange in break. Surface apparently with a wash; outside black, well burnished; inside dull purplish. 2293. (NN 1 1 ) (plate 97) Fragment of large jar, perhaps the same vase as 2294. Outside surface dark red, burnished; inside pale reddish, rough and unburnished. 2294. (NN 11) (plate 97) Handle from large jar, perhaps the same as 2293. Thick triangular section. Gritty orange clay; outside with traces of a red wash, burnished but much worn. 2295. (NN 11) (plate 97, where upside down) Fragment from carinated belly of large jar.

EMPORIO IMPORTS (2299-2301) Three fragments appeared to come from imported vases. 2299. (NN 1 1 ) (plate 98) Rim (class B II), with ridge for lid on outside, and long horizontally perforated lug below it. Apparently handmade. Sandy, pale orange clay, slightly dusky at core; abundant fine grit including silvery mica showing in surface, which seems to have a slip of same colour as the body clay; smoothed but not burnished. Probably Gycladic. A complete jar from Antiparos with rim and lugs exactly like this is illustrated by Renfrew, Emergence pl. 9: 5. Cf. AE 1898, 1 75 pl. ix: 38, from Paros, Pyrgos.

Stage 4 Surface levels in AA, CC, DD Amount c. 3 zembils 2302-231 1 (fig. 230) Period II and later GENERAL The Bronze Age pottery from the upper surface levels at the south-western end of Area C. 1 was still dominantly of Period II; but it was mixed with some later, Greco-Roman, material. A number of complete or nearly complete vases from AA (e.g. the jugs 2304-5) probably belong to AA level ?8 of stage 3. SHAPES (a) bowls (2302-2303) One or two rims like 2302-3 assignable to type 4 resemble those of shallow bowls of the horizon of Period I, but appear to be handmade and not wheelmade. 2302.

EMPORIO (b) AREA C. 3 Stage 5 JJ level 3 Amount c. 1.5 zembils 23 1 2-23 1 7 (fig. 230) Period I (?) GENERAL Material assignable to Period I was only recovered in Area C in the most westerly trench JJ, where a deposit of it (level 3) overlay a horizon of Period II. There were some earlier strays in this material, but on the whole the deposit appeared to belong to the horizon of Period I as identified in Area F on the Acropolis hill. One or two fragments seemed to come from wheelmade vases. Burnishing was usual, but was not very fine. The burnished surfaces were dominantly shades of brown to orange and red; black surfaces with fine burnish hardly occurred. Many fragments of rather large vases of coarse fabric were noted together with a good deal of pithos. SHAPES (a) bowls (2312-2316) Two rims belonged to baking pans of type 3, and were of the coarse fabric peculiar to such vases. The larger of these, which was very thick-walled, had the inside surface light brown, burnished. These may be earlier strays, but one or two other bowl rims were closely paralleled by ones from the horizon of Period I in Area F; one from an open bowl of type 4 C appeared to be wheelmade. 2312. Rim (type 4). Light grey clay, brown at edges; surface light brown, burnished. 2313. Rim (type 4 C). Light brown; fine burnish. 2314. Rim, cf. type 7. Irregular. Reddish brown clay fired an even colour throughout; surface light brown to red with poor burnish. 2315. Rim (type 7). Light brown; fine burnish. Cf. 2479 of Period I in Area F. 2316. Rim (type 7). Light brown to reddish and dusky brown; fine burnish. (b) jugs and tripod cooking pots Two handles, evidently from jugs, were set below the rim as became usual in Period II; one of these was of neat semi-circular, the other of lunate section. Over a dozen fragments of feet from tripod cooking pots (type 27) were counted; one had a neat semi-circular section. (i) HANDLES AND LUGS (23 I 7) (1) Bowls There were two or three fragments of horizontal side handles from bowls, one being of the nicked class as fig. 107 no. 4. A rim from a large type 4 bowl with a vertically perforated lug below it appeared to be an earlier stray.</page><page sequence="119">3. AREA D. STAGE 1 (PER. IV) 527 (2) Jugs and jars etc. Some twenty fragments of vertical handles were recovered. One surmounted by a wart may be an earlier stray. Two with neat semi-circular and lunate sections were set below rims of jugs as noted above. Another, with the burnished surface shades of brown to red, was very wide, flat and strap-like in section. The curious lug 2317 may be a stray of Periods V-IV. 2317. (plate 83) Lug with traces of perforation. Upper surface shades of light brown to red, well burnished but worn. Bold incised decoration. DECORATION Three small fragments besides 2317 were decorated with incision. One of these, from a bowl of types 13 or 14, may be a stray of Periods V-IV like 2317; the other two were from the bodies of jugs or jars. The wart noted came from the body of a jug or jar with a red wash on the outside. Stage 6 HH level 2 Amount c. 1.5 zembils 2318-2320 (fig. 230) Middle Bronze Age (?), mixed with Late Bronze Age including Mycenaean This deposit was virtually unstratified, but a good deal of Middle or Late Bronze Age material was recovered from it, including a fragment of a strainer base with matt-painted decoration in black. The plate 2318 and the bowl rim 2319 may belong to the Middle Bronze Age. 2318. Plate (type 1). Handmade (?). Underneath rough and irregular; inside shades of light and dark brown, burnished. Shape and profile are reminiscent of plates common at Knossos in Crete from Middle Minoan times into Late Minoan I. 2319. Rim of bowl cf. type 8. Probably wheelmade. Light brown; very fine burnish. 2320. (plate 98) Lid (type 60). Diam. 5.8. One side bent upwards and pierced with a hole. Light brown to dusky, burnished. iii Area D The stratified deposits in trench Q,(L) were of later Bronze Age and Mycenaean date, and the pottery from them is considered under Mycenaean. But in the small trench M on the terrace above trench Q (L) a deposit of burnt destruction (stage 1) assignable to Period IV was preserved on the sloping rock. Sherds from the levels (stage 2) immediately overlying this Period IV deposit were datable to Period II. Stage 1 Burnt deposit above rock in trench M Amount c. 3 zembils 2321-2336 (fig. 231) Period IV GENERAL From the burnt deposit above the rock two large pithoi (2332-3) and a number of other complete or nearly complete vases were recovered.

All of them corresponded to types current in Period IV, and the burnt destruction here appeared to be the same as that of Period IV in Area A. As the deposit was close below the surface a number of later sherds had become incorporated in it. Some of these were assignable to Period II; a few were Mycenaean. SHAPES (a) bowls (2321-2328) Bowls of the carinated type 9 predominated, accounting for nearly two thirds (28 out of some 50) of the profiles and rims. Most of these carinated bowls were evidently of medium size with diameters of c. 20-25 as found in Period IV; the small bowls with diameters of 15 or less characteristic of Period II were not in evidence. Surfaces were shades of grey-brown, light brown or red, and invariably burnished. Remains of side handles were preserved on three or four type 9 rims, while others had warts on their carinations. The complete bowl 2325 of type 13 had four double projections rising from the rim. There were three lug-handles as fig. 106 nos. 8 a, 8 b, on rims of types 13 or 14; one of the projections was horned as fig. i 06 no. 8 b, the other two being of simple rounded shape (fig. i 06 no. 8 a) ; one of the latter (2326) had a long horizontal lug set below it. A simple zigzag was incised on the inside of a scrap of rim from a type 13 bowl. Dipper cups of type 16, characteristic of Period IV, were represented by two complete examples (2327-8) and fragments of others. A thickened rim of type 7 resembling 958 from a level of Period V in Area A may have been a stray of Periods VII-VI; the surface was light brown with a reddish tinge, finely burnished. 2321. Profile (type 5), possibly from dipper cup (type 16). Grey-brown to black; fine burnish. 2322. Profile (type 5), possibly from dipper cup (type 16). Grey-brown to deep purplish red, burnished. 2323. Rim, cf. type 6; stump of possible side handle, and two irregular channels below rim. Inside light brown, outside grey-brown, burnished. 2324. Rim, cf. type 8, with sharp carination.

Relief band with boldly incised chevrons round neck. Six massive vertical handles of kidney-shaped section arranged in two opposed series of three each; between them, low down on one side and just above the base, a large oval hole (7 x 5-5) evidently made after firing, presumably for a wooden bung, cf. 1283, 1287. Rounded base. Fabric as pithoi of Periods V-IV in Area A; soft grey-brown clay with abundant straw; surface full of straw impressions, smoothed but not burnished; outside with a wash, red shading to dark and light brown; inside a dull lightish brown. Inside of base black as if a fire had been lit in it. 2333. (plate 100) Virtually complete. Ht. 102. Max. width c. 60. Diam. of rim c. 40, of base c. 10.

Six vertical handles of flat oval section arranged in two opposed series of three each as on 2332; between them, on the shoulder each side, large circular flat-topped warts or discs. Small flat base. Fabric cf. pithoi of Periods V-IV in Area A; coarse grey-brown clay with large grit, showing together with straw impressions in surface, which has a wash, red shading to brown, discoloured in places by fire of burnt destruction. (i) HANDLES AND LUGS (2334-2336) (1) Bowls Dipper cups of type 1 6 had large vertical handles, that of 2327 being surmounted by a wart. One side handle from a bowl was of pointed shape as fig. 107 no. 2, while two others were horned (no. 5) or nicked (no. 4) . One side handle was sub-rectangular in section. The horned fragment 2334, with incised decoration, may come from a projecting lug-handle, cf. fig. 106 no. 8 b, on a bowl of types 13 or 14. A large bowl rim of types 5/6 or 9 had a solid horned lug resembling that on 15 16 of Period II. The curious serrated lug 2335 may come from a bowl. 2334. (plate 92) Horned handle or lug-handle. Grey-brown, burnished. The upper side decorated with very fine, rather irregular incision. 2335. (plate 92) Serrated lug. Grey-brown, burnished.

Sandy grey-brown clay; surface with a red wash, apparently unburnished. Incised decoration. DECORATION This was mostly incised, and appropriate to Period IV. One fragment of a large jar, however, the outside surface dark brown with fine burnish, had boldly incised lattice with reed-made circles in the diamonds as on 1787 of Period II in Area A (plate 89 (e)). Warts were in evidence on bowls of type 9 and on jugs or other closed vases. One fragment from the body of a jug or jar, the outside surface light brownish grey, burnished, may preserve part of a circle in relief with a wart at the centre like 1802-3 from levels of Period II in Area A.</page><page sequence="123">fig. 232.

Most of these were of Early Bronze Age type and assignable to Period II; but they included one or two scraps of Mycenaean. (2) A complete jug (2343) and large fragments of two other vases - a carina ted bowl of type 9 (2342) and ajar (2344) - were recovered from the fill of the tomb chamber. These did not belong with the burial there, and appear to have washed down into the hollow left by the collapse of the tomb chamber from another tomb higher on the slope. This may have been a pithos burial, since fragments of a pithos including part of its rim (2345) were also recovered from the fill. The bowl 2342 is assignable to Periods V-IV, and the other vases are consistent with such a date. (3) On the floor of the tomb, and clearly associated with the burial in it, stood a couple of small pyxis jars; one of them is 2346, assignable to Period II; the other was stolen from the tomb, apart from a small foot left behind in the earth.</page><page sequence="124">fig. 233.

Among bowls those of the carinated type 9 were predominant, and remains of them included one complete profile 2348. The little rim 2353 of type 1 o is unusual. Rims of type 1 2 included one (2354) which had incised decoration on the inside, like 2356 of type 13. The ribbed trumpet lug 2360 evidently comes from a bowl. The type 9 rim 2351 with a double vertically perforated lug below the carination may be of Period II date.

Fragments of two or three large covers (type 63) with horned lugs and incised decoration (plate 105 (b) top row) evidently belonged with the characteristic Period II decorated jars of which fragments are illustrated on plate 105 (a), (b) bottom row. Two small incised covers of this type with simple perforated lugs (plate 105 (d)) came from pyxis-like jars cf. type 44. A fragmentary plain cover (2400) was of type 63A. 2400.

(k) bases Bases, apparently from bowls, included one high ring foot (class 3A) like 1 741 of Period II, and one sunk base of class 5B like 1747 together with three or four of class 8B like 1753 of the same period. DECORATION Incision. This was much in evidence, with motifs characteristic of Period II, notably on fragments of large jars with finely burnished surfaces (e.g. plate 105 (a), (b) bottom row). Relief. A fragment with the surface light brown, burnished inside and out, had part of a curving rib, perhaps a horseshoe like 2359 (plate ioi). Warts occurred on vases of all kinds including jugs and jars. The unusual long horizontal wart or ledge-lug on the small type 9 carinated bowl 2387 has interesting parallels on the Greek mainland and elsewhere. IMPORTS Four fragments of wheelmade vases were among the material alleged to belong to stage 3. A scrap from a bowl of Period I type had no doubt strayed from the levels above. Three other wheelmade fragments, however, all of the same fabric, of orange clay with a white or greyish white slip on the outside, and evidently from one or more closed vases, seem more likely to be imports. The fragment 2402, which has an even better claim to be regarded as foreign, may also come from a wheelmade vase. 2402. (plate 105 (c)) Fragment of large but thin-walled, apparently closed, vase. Possibly wheelmade. Sandy red-brown clay; some mice, both silvery and golden. Inside surface even and smooth; outside with a lustrous black to dark purple-brown wash.

The presence of a certain amount assignable to the horizon of Periods VIII-VI suggests that there was occupation of some kind on the summit of the Acropolis hill then, although no walls or floors were identified there earlier than Periods V-IV.

Stage 4 Trenches B, D, F, S Amount 25 zembils 2432-2610 (figs. 241-252) Period I GENERAL This horizon was well preserved with floors and house walls throughout the area excavated in trenches B, D and F. Several complete vases were recovered, especially from above the floor of room I in trench B. Among these complete vases were some bowls made on the fast wheel, which is first certainly attested at Emporio in Period I. While complete vases and large fragments found above the relevant house floors may be assumed to belong to this horizon, a large proportion of the isolated fragments from deposits of Period I were evidently earlier strays, and some later strays had also become incorporated with them in excavation. Thus two fragments of matt-painted ware assignable to the early part of the Late Bronze Age were included with the fragments of complete vases in the deposit from above the floor of room I in trench B. The deposit here was very thin, however, and the top of it not easy to distinguish. At the south end of trench D the Period I deposits were deeper; but in F the situation was very confused, and the sections here were of no help in disentangling it. Two deposits (A and B) from trench F as excavated seem to consist of Period I material coming from room V. But only the vases from above the floor in room I in trench B (B level 8) are entirely reliable, and give a key to the character of this horizon. The complete vases, notably those from trench B level 8, suggest that Period I overlaps with the later part of Troy II. Tankards like 2532 of type 77 in particular seem characteristic of Troy II rather than of later Trojan phases. It is noteworthy that although several fragments of such tankards were assignable to the horizon of Period I at Emporio, no remains of the tall, thin depas amphikypellon (Troy shape A 45) were noted. Similar horizons of Troadic pottery, including tankards of our type 77 (Troy shape A 43), have been revealed at the base of the settlement mound of Lefkandi in Euboia and at Ayia Irini in Kea. At Chalandriani in Syros a comparable horizon, assignable to the period of Troy II or III, has produced several depades of Troy shape A 45, but apparently no tankards of our type 77 (Troy shape A 43). Fragments of cups with one or two handles (Troy shapes A 39 and A 43) and of wheelmade plates (Troy shape A 2), all presumably imported, have been noted from a good many sites on the Greek mainland (French, Thesis 130). FABRIC The fabric of the handmade vases was not very different from what it had been in Period II. Even in the case of vases with finely burnished surfaces the clay tended to be coarse, tempered with</page><page sequence="137">3. AREA F. STAGE 4 (PER. I) 545 straw and grit. Surfaces were still for the most part burnished, although the burnishing might be very poor and superficial. As in Period II finely burnished surfaces ranged in colour from shades of light and dark brown through grey-brown to deep purple-red and black; but light-coloured surfaces, red or light brown, were now more dominant. The insides of a number of vases appeared to have been scraped with a comb of some kind; and the outside surface of a small vase from Area F, trench B level ?g, had been combed in this way before being coated with an unburnished red wash. White Burnished Ware. Some possible jug fragments from deposits of Period II were of this ware. A fragment, apparently from a jug, from B level 8 of Period I in Area F also seemed to be assignable to it; this was of very soft gritty orange clay, with the inside surface rough; the outside surface had a thick greyish white slip, burnished but crackled, with grit showing in it. A neck fragment of comparable fabric from Deposit A in trench F of Area F may have belonged to the same vase. Wheelmade Wares. About sixty-five fragments from deposits assignable to Period I in Area F were identified as coming from vases made on the fast wheel. This represents an average of about three wheelmade sherds per zembil. There were over twenty rims among these sixty-five sherds and at least seven fragments of bases. Many of the rim and base fragments evidently belonged to more or less shallow dish-like bowls akin to type 75. But a few bases like 2620 with aggressive wheel marks on the inside must have come from small closed vases - tankards of type 77 or some allied type perhaps; a few rims attributable to tankards appeared to show traces of the fast wheel (e.g. 2535, 2538). All of the wheelmade pottery from the horizon of Period I at Emporio may have been imported. The fabric of the wheelmade wares was in general soft, occasionally very soft, and the clay often shaded in colour from the standard orange to greyish, reflecting comparatively low temperatures of firing. The firing indeed appears to have been markedly less good than it was in the case of the local handmade wares. Small amounts of mica could often be detected in the clay, which was normally sandy and coarse, with grit, sometimes quite large, showing in the surfaces. The vases were as a rule coated with a red wash, usually thick but in some instances thin. Light brown, dark brown with a purplish tinge, and black washed surfaces were also attested, although red was the dominant colour. The wash used seems to have been slightly lustrous, but the surfaces of the vases were often smoothed - more rarely burnished - after it had been applied. A few wheelmade fragments assigned to Period I were noticeably better fired than the rest. Some of these at any rate may be later intrusions, contemporary with stages 5 or 6 in Area F. SHAPES (a) bowls General Bowl surfaces were mostly burnished, although the burnishing was apt to be rather rough and superficial. Shades of red or light brown were very prominent, accounting for at least half, or more than half, of the total number of rims and fragments from bowls. The wheelmade bowls with their red-washed surfaces were normally flat and dish-like; and there was a marked tendency even among the handmade bowls (e.g. those of type 5 and of the carinated type 9) to be shallower and more dish-like than those of the preceding Period II, although deep varieties of small type 9 bowls were still current it seems (e.g. 2489).</page><page sequence="138">fig. 241. Area F. Stage 4 (Period I). Types 1-5. Scale 1/3. 546 III. EMPORIO Carinated type 9 bowls of all sizes, whether made by hand or on the fast wheel, were still common, but they had been largely replaced by bowls with rounded incurving rims assignable to type 7; these type 7 bowls, however, were in effect type 9 ones with the carination rounded away. Handles and lugs appeared to be much less in evidence on bowls of Period I than on earlier ones. Some of those noted as from the horizon of Period I may have been earlier strays. 1. Plates 2432 (fig. 241) Part of a plate was recovered from above the floor in room I of trench B. This seems to be in a contemporary Period I context, in spite of the fact that fragments of plates with similar profiles were characteristic of the earliest Periods X-VIII at Emporio. Another plate fragment (2318) came from an upper (Middle or Late Bronze Age (?)) level in trench HH of Area C. 3.

Troy shape A 16) 2456-2481 (fig. 242) These were evidently common, and rims assignable to such bowls were very much more plentiful in proportion to rims of the carinated type 9 than they were in levels of Period II. But a number of rims assignable to the high-shouldered type 7 are in effect type 9 rims with the carination rounded, and the rim on the same bowl may be more or less sharply carinated as type 9 in one place and rounded as type 7 in another. At the same time some of the large rims (e.g. 2456-8) assigned to type 6 may come from jars of some kind rather than from bowls. Handles and lugs were not much in evidence on these bowls, but a double vertically perforated lug is preserved on the large fragment 2460 of type 6 and also on 2465, while a rim of type 7 like 2473 had a horizontally perforated lug. The type 7 rim 2481 is of great interest, since the outside surface is decorated with pattern burnish. It might therefore be considered as a stray from the horizon of Period VIII, when pattern burnish was common. But neither the shape of the rim nor the style of the pattern burnish are typical of the early periods at Emporio, and the fresh condition of the fragment suggests that it is from a contemporary Period I vase. 6.

Carinated bowls (Troy shape A 12) 2482-2495 (figs. 243, 244) These were much in evidence, although less than they had been in Period II. As in Period II bowls of this type showed a considerable range in size, and rims of class 9 D were still common. Characteristic, however, of the Period I horizon was a wide shallow variety of carinated bowl with a rim cf. type 9 B (e.g. 2485); some of the bowls of this shape were made on the fast wheel (e.g. 2494-5). Handles and lugs appear to have gone out of favour by Period I, and the virtually complete 2364 for instance had no lug or handle of any kind. But small deep type 9 bowls with side handles and warts were still well represented (e.g. 2489) . Most of these had finely burnished surfaces and were indistinguishable in shape and fabric from the little carinated bowls common in Period II; some of them at any rate may therefore be earlier strays. The small rim 2493 had a neat solid horned lug above the carination. ( 1 ) Large bowls 2482. (B 1 1 /9) Rim (type 9 A) . Rough and irregular.

Shallow bowls with internally differentiated rims 2507-2508 (fig. 246) Four rims from Area F were assignable to this type. All came from trench F, and therefore from a somewhat uncertain stratigraphie context, allowing the possibility that they dated from later phases of occupation contemporary with Troy III-V or even VI. Two of the rims approximated in shape to the unstratified 2612 from Area D. All four appeared to belong to wheelmade vases. Two had an overall red wash, one a dark purplish brown wash; these washes looked slightly lustrous, but the surface of 2507 at any rate was burnished. Somewhat comparable rims occur in Troy II on bowls assigned to shapes A 16 and A 18, both of which continued into Troy III-V (Troy i 365, 370 fig. 414: 25, 28). 2507. (F 5/3/2, Prooms Vor VI) Rim.

Bowls with inward-curving, S-shaped or bead rims 251 1-2516 (fig. 246) The rim 25 1 1 with the stump of a side handle may be from a handmade vase. Some of the other rims, however, evidently belonged to wheelmade bowls with overall red washes. Most were from relatively good Period I contexts. The bowls from which these rims came seem to have been akin to Trojan shape A 2 1 , which first appears in Troy II b but continues at least as late as Troy V (Troy i 227 f.; ii 241 f.). For comparable rims from Troy II contexts, e.g. Troy i 276 fig. 412: 2; 319 fig. 414: 16, both of red-coated ware. 25 1 1 . (D West 6) Rim, with stump of side handle.

Orange clay; surface with a light brown wash, burnished. 73. Carinated bowls with outward spreading bead rims 251 7-2518 (fig. 247) Several fragments of wheelmade bowls and at least one rim (2518) from a bowl which may have been handmade were assignable to this type, which is reminiscent of the earlier type 15. It is comparable with some bowls of Trojan shape A 18, which first appears in Troy II d and continues into Troy V-VI, although fragments from VI may be earlier strays ( Troy i 227; ii 25, 124, 240; iii 42). A deep example from Troy III is close in shape to 2517 (Troy ii 25 fig. 66: 37.1122). 2517. (D West 6, 6A) (plate 108) Fragments, including parts of rim and base. Wheelmade; aggressive marks of manufacture on fast wheel. Very soft coarse sandy clay with some mica, orange shading to dusky at surface, which has grit showing in it; overall black wash, well smoothed and soapy to feel. 2518. (F 5/4 Deposit A, ?room V) Rim. Surface with a red wash, shading to dark purple-red outside, light brown and dusky inside, burnished. 74.

Two rims from Troy II b and d recall 2520 but are larger and thicker (Troy i 260 fig. 413: 12; 300 fig. 413: 32). 75. Shallow bowls with more or less well marked bead rims 2521-2530 (fig. 247) Such bowls were relatively common at Emporio. Some 15 rims, mostly from quite large bowls with diameters of c. 25-30, could be assgned to this type. Smaller rims included the very neat and well made 2530 with a wash outside but not in. Most of the bowls, however, appear to have been covered with an overall wash, normally red in colour. But 2525 came from a bowl with a white wash, and one or two other rims had a pale greenish slip inside and out. Type 75 bowls were evidently akin to ones of Trojan shape A 2, which occurred in vast quantities in the later levels of Troy II and were still common in Troy III [Troy i 225 f.; ii 24). Some A 2 rims from Troy II are very similar to type 75 ones (e.g. Troy i 300 fig. 413: 29-31; 301 fig. 414: 7-8). Such bowls have also been found at Lefkandi and Manika in Euboia (Lefkandi 7 f. fig. 7: 1, 2. ASxvi (1966) 53 fig. 7). 2521. (D West 6A) (plate 107) Rim. Wheelmade.

Tall goblet with solid 'foot 2531 (fig. 248) This unique handmade vase was among those lying on the floor of room I in trench B. It is somewhat reminiscent of the much smaller electrum cup from one of the Troy II treasures (SS 230 f. no. 5864. Tul 351 fig. 280a). In a general way it resembles the cups with a vertical handle and low ring base of Trojan shape A 35, which seems to belong to the end of Troy II ( Troy i 228 f. fig. 414: 39). Similar handled cups from Siphnos and Syros assignable to Early Cycladic II have more curving sides and high feet (AE 1899 pl. 8: 3, 4). A vase from Kiiltepe has a very similar profile to 2531, but is smaller, with four lugs or handles on the rim (K. Bittel, Prähistorische Forschung in Kleinasien (Istanbul, 1934) 69 pl. viii: 3). 2531. (B 8: floor, on side against wall 13) (plate 109) Broken, but virtually complete. Ht. 18.5. Rather irregular in shape; mouth roughly oval (diam. 1 2.5-1 3.5). Orange clay with grit, including some large red and white; surface red mottling to light and dark brown, with fine stroke burnish inside and out. 77. Tankards 2532-2538 (fig. 248) This type corresponds to the Trojan shapes A 39 and A 43, with one or with two handles. It was not in fact certain whether any of the tankards from Emporio had two handles (Troy shape A 43) as suggested in the reconstruction of the large fragment 2532 from the floor in room I of trench B. A couple of small wheelmade bases like 2538 may have come from tankards, but they and some of the rims grouped here could have belonged to vases of the related type A 38 with no handles. Examples of all three types from Troy and elsewhere in Anatolia are listed by P. Z. Spanos, 1st. Mitt. Beiheft 6 (Tübingen, 1972) 108 ff. Even in Anatolia the one-handled tankard as Troy shape A 39 appears to be much commoner than the two-handled variety (shape A 43). A 43 tankards were characteristic of Troy II, but were already rare in Troy III and are not it seems attested afterwards (Troy i 229 fig. 380; ii 26 f. Cf. SS nos. 2001-2, 1207-9, 1 156-7, 2122-3). The silver two-handled vase, SS 232 no. 5873, from one of the Troy II treasures, is of this shape, but has a rounded base. The one-handled variety (A 39) may have already occurred I ^ V ' M ^^^ 2532 2531 I I 2¿^7 * V / ' ( r*W / P^, * 2534 2535 's 2537</page><page sequence="149">3. AREA F. STAGE 4 (PER. I) 557 at the end of the Late Subperiod of Troy I, and was at home from Troy II-IV and even later {Troy i 64, 229; ii 25 f., 126 f., 242). The handleless A 38 seems to be an innovation of Troy II a and is not recorded after the end of Troy II {Troy i 229). Two-handled tankards akin to those of Troy shape A 43, some handmade and others wheelmade, were at home at Tarsus in E.B. Ill {Tarsus ii 141 f. nos. 471-482 figs. 265, 356). They were found there alongside one-handled cups akin to those of Troy shape A 39 ( Tarsus ii 141 nos. 467-470). A variety of handleless jar reminiscent of the Trojan shape A 38 occurred in the same horizon {Tarsus ii 149 f. nos. 573-585 esp. no. 576 figs. 274, 362). There were also many two-handled depades in a wide range of different forms {Tarsus ii nos. 483-513) together with single-handled and handleless goblets resembling some of them in shape. This wide group of related forms appears to have developed in Cilicia, and the fashion for vases of these shapes probably spread from there to the Trojan area in the time of Troy II along with the technique of the fast potter's wheel which is first attested in Troy II b. At Karata§-Semayuk tankards of Troy shape A 43 were found in E.B. Ill contexts {AJA lxix ( 1 965) 250 pl. 65 fig. 36; lxxi ( 1 967) 259 pl. 83 fig. 46) . Mellink calls the shape 'a hallmark of the E.B. Ill period, Troy II, Cilician E.B. Ill A'. Fragments of handmade vases, with two handles or handleless, and with rims like 2534-5 coated with a red slip and burnished, occurred at Beycesultan as imports in the latest level (XIII a) of E.B. 2 there {Beycesultan i 190 if. fig. P. 46: 2, 5; sheet 5 shape 38. Cf. ibid. 202 f. fig. P. 47: 60 from level XII of E.B. 3 a). It is interesting that both depades and tankards with one or two handles appear to be rare in settlements (if not in graves) in the hinterland of north-western Anatolia (D. French, AS xix (1969) 68 under 12 (c) and (d)). A unique (imported ?) example of the one-handled variety (Troy shape A 39) identical with one from Tarsus is assigned to Alishar II but came from an area with frequent remains of Alishar I {Alishar 1928-29 i 114 fig. 134 pl. xii: b 2536. Aberg, Chronologie iv 96 f. fig. 190. Cf. Tarsus ii 141 no. 467 fig. 266). Tankards with one or two handles like Troy shapes A 39 and A 43 do not appear to be attested at Thermi. But one-handled tankards (A 39) occur on Samos {Samos i pls. 15: 6 (47: 6); 21: 1), and in the Red period at Poliochni {Poliochni i 639 pl. cxliii: a-f, k). The Poliochni tankards usually seem to have the top of the handle attached to the shoulder rather than to the neck, as if they were direct imitations of Cilician E.B. Ill models instead of Trojan derivatives (e.g. Tarsus ii fig. 266: 467. Mersin 200 f. fig. 1 24: 10) . The same type is standard at Aphrodisias in Complex VI which appears to be contemporary with an early phase of Troy II {A JA lxxv (1971 ) 137, 138 pl. 25: fig. 4). The two-handled tankard (Troy shape A 43) does not appear to be at home in the Cyclades or further west. But the one-handled variety (A 39) is well represented in the islands in Early Cycladic II and on the western side of the Aegean in contexts assignable to late E.H. II or early E.H. Ill (e.g. Delos xi fig. 41: top row, 2 and 4 from left. Cf. MacGillivray 1979 fig. 9. Naxos: several in Apeiranthos Museum. Syros and Siphnos: AE 1899 pl. 9: 7, 1 1 .

(C) JARS 2544-2584 (FIGS. 249-251) These all seem to have been handmade. Some rims of classes A I- III appear to come from small jars which may have been used as cooking pots as in earlier periods; the surfaces of these were dusky brown, sometimes with a red wash, rough or with little or no burnish. One rim (2545) of class A I was bevelled on the inside. Jars with a pair of handles set opposite each other, either on the shoulder, or joining shoulder to neck (or occasionally shoulder to rim), were much in evidence, and of all sizes, ranging from store jars as 2554 to small pyxis-like vases. The larger ones had irregular surfaces with a coarse burnish, shades of light and dark brown to reddish, the red surface sometimes at any rate being the result of a wash; while smaller ones might have finely burnished surfaces as in Period II. Some large two-handled jars were wide-mouthed as 2554. Narrow mouths like 2578 may come from jars with a pair of vertical handles on the belly resembling those of Trojan shape C 10 common in the destruction level marking the end of Troy II. Two large jars with globular bodies and a pair of vertical handles joining neck to shoulder had high ring feet (2555-6). There seem to be no close parallels for these jars from Troy or Thermi. A single-handled cup from Thermi IV has a comparable profile, but is much smaller ( Thermi 1 25 no. 438 pl. ix) . Ring bases like those of 2555-6 are in evidence on jars of other shapes from the Yellow period at Poliochni, which should overlap with Troy II (e.g. Poliochni ii pls. xcv-xcvii). The surviving upper part of a two-handled jar from a late phase of the local Early Bronze Age at Servia in western Macedonia looks remarkably similar to 2555-6 {Servia 224, 222 fig. 16: 1 1 1). More or less globular jars akin to type 47 (e.g. 2573) still seem to occur at Emporio in Period I, and these may have a pair of horizontal side handles instead of the more usual vertical ones. A few jars had everted rims of class B III f (e.g. 2582-4). The small jar 2584 is interesting, since the base of the neck seems to have been covered with a band of some kind of material other than clay at the time the vase was burnished. A similar phenomenon was noted in the case of some finely burnished jar necks from levels of Period II (e.g. 2086). Traces of red paint inside 2584 may be remains of its original contents; but thick matt red paint inside jars and lids from deposits of Period II sometimes at any rate appears to have been decorative (e.g. 2399).

EMPORIO to have been the lower end. The fragments 2589, all perhaps from the same vase, include a rim, cf. 2345, a vertical handle with sharp rectangular section, and a rather small, slightly sunk base. The clay for pithoi was normally coarse, but well fired, tending to light brown or orange in colour; surfaces were often, but not always, coated with a red wash, and usually smoothed or burnished. Decoration on pithoi in Period I seems to have been confined to a raised band around the base of the neck with diagonal or vertical cuts on it. 2585. (B ?8) Rim. Coarse orange clay with grit, some very large; surface irregular, coated with an overall wash, red inside, dark purplish red-brown outside, smoothed or burnished.

(f) lids 2591-2597 (fig. 252) A good many fragments of lids were noted in levels assignable to Period I. Some of these were evidently large, of coarse fabric, their surfaces shades of light brown to dusky with poor burnish or sometimes none at all. Among lids of coarse ware flat ones of type 60 were in evidence; three or four had solid horned lugs on the edge like 2592. One fragment of a lid of uncertain type, of coarse fabric with an unburnished purple-brown wash, was surmounted by a handle flanked by a pair of string-holes. Two solid triangular lugs resembling 1669 of Period II, with light brown to red burnished surfaces, evidently came from large covers of type 63; but small covers of this type belonging to pyxis-like jars were not much in evidence in deposits of Period I. The scrap 2594 from a small type 63 cover has the surface finely burnished, but no trace of incised decoration; it may be of Period I date. But the fragments of a pyxis-like jar and small cover decorated with incision on plate 105 (d) nos. 2, 6, although from a level (B under wall 22) assignable to I, look as if they might belong to Period II. Three fragments (2595-7) evidently came from varieties of covers of type 64B with 'crown-handles'. 2591- (F 5/4 Deposit A, ?room V) Edge of flat lid (type 60) with oblong wart.

(i) HANDLES AND LUGS 2598, 2599 (FIG. 252) (1) Bowls Bowls of types 6 and 7, and ones of the carinated type 9, sometimes appear to have had side handles, but these were not as much in evidence as in levels of Period II.

A rim (D East ?6) with grey-brown burnished surface, apparently from a type 5 bowl, had the stump of a handle rising from its top like bowls of the early Periods X- VIII; it may be a stray from that horizon. Several fragments were recovered of horned lug-handles with large circular holes through them as fig. 106 no. 8 b, rising from the rims of bowls, apparently of type 14; their surfaces light brown, or shades of light and dark brown to reddish, burnished. Such lug-handles (fig. 106 nos. 8 a, 8 b) were not uncommon in Period II. One or two circular-sectioned handles like 2537 evidently belonged to tankards of type 77 or to vases of related types. A large horizontal trumpet lug (F 5 Deposit B, room V) may come from a bowl. Vertically perforated lugs of various kinds seem to have occurred on bowls, but were evidently rare. (2) Jugs and jars etc. (2598-9) Vertical handles from jugs and jars were much in evidence. Most of these were oval in section, or hollow-backed, resembling earlier kidney-sectioned handles but thinner. Only one handle was noted with a neat lunate section; it was evidently from a jug, with a finely burnished black surface, and may have been a stray of Period II or earlier when similar handles were common. A number of handles had 'thrust-through' ends of a modified kind; they presumably came from jars, aggressively 'thrust-through' handles being confined to jugs, whose narrow necks prevented the potter from putting a hand inside to smooth over the handle end. A fragment of a side handle (F 5/4 Deposit A, ?room V) like 1701 of Period II was noted. Another fragment came from a handle of the slashed type like 171 7. The curious lug-handle 2598 is somewhat reminiscent of those representing arms on Trojan 'Face Urns'. Solid horned lugs or warts occurred on vases of various types, on the sides of bowls (e.g. 2493), and on flat lids (e.g. 2592). 2598. (B 1 1 ¡g) (plate hi) Lug-handle from side of jar. Outside surface light to dark brown, with fine burnish; inside of jar rough. Two others similar from B 9, stages ?3/4, and E (F ?4/i) In a general way cf. the solid arms of Trojan 'Face Urns' (Troy shape C 30) attested from the end of Troy II until Troy V (Troy i 236; ii 31, 133 f., 246). 2599. (D West ?5B) (plate hi) Large lug-handle, apparently from side of jar. Hard gritty grey to red-brown clay with mica showing in it; surface with a paler wash, unburnished. Possibly from an imported vase in view of the mica. (k) bases 2600-2607 (fig. 252) These included several pedestal feet and high ring feet, mostly it seems from bowls (e.g. 2489- of type 9), although the pair of jars (2555-6) from room I in trench B had high ring feet. One foot (D East 6A) of class 2A was evidently perforated with four circular holes. The unique goblet 2531 of type 76 has a solid pedestal foot (class 2B). Sunk bases do not seem to have been common, but one or two were noted; that on the little jar 2584 is very marked. One small conical foot of a pyxis-like jar was recovered (F ?5, ?room V) . Bases from wheelmade vases included 2605. A couple of little bases like 2620 could have belonged to wheelmade versions of type 77. Unless otherwise stated the bases described below are either certainly or probably from bowls. 2600. (F 5/4 Deposit A, ?room V) Pedestal foot (class 2A), apparently from ajar.

DECORATION This was not much in evidence compared with earlier periods. Pattern burnish. The fragment 2481 from the rim of a bowl of type 7 was decorated with true pattern burnish. Pattern burnish was characteristic of the horizon of Period VIII at Emporio, and was hardly represented in levels of VII-VI and only by earlier strays it seems in those of later periods from V-II. But neither the shape of this rim nor the style of the pattern burnish are typical of Period VIII, nor is the fragment at all worn. There is nothing apart from the decoration to suggest that it comes from an imported vase. A theriomorphic vase from the fourth level in the Mound of Protesilaos assignable to the period of Troy II appears to have been decorated with a variety of pattern burnish {Protesilaos 61 fig. 79). Incision. This was the commonest form of decoration, although comparatively few incised fragments - only some twenty-three, or less than one per zembil - were recovered, and most of these could be regarded as strays of Period II. The rim 2536, however, with large incised circles, may come from a tankard of type 77 and is almost certainly of Period I date. Apart from this, the motifs of incised decoration from levels of Period I were indistinguishable from those attested in II, and the shapes of vase on which such decoration occurred, including bowls of types 13 and 14 (e.g. 2503), large carinated jars with finely burnished surfaces, and small pyxis-like jars (e.g. 2581), were equally if not more at home then. Relief. Decoration in relief occurred, but was not common. The rim of a bowl of type 7 (S ? 1 1 ) had a crescent in relief on the shoulder. There was a group of curving ribs on a fragment (B ?g) which may have come from the body of a jug. A fragment (B 8) from ajar (?) had a vertical rib descending to a thick circle. Horizontal ridges of a distinctly metallic kind appear on 2068; but this may be later than Period I.

A rim (B ?ioA) with a long vertical wart like 1 593 of Period II may come from a large store jar akin to 2554. The jar rim 2553 of class All has a wart below it. 2608.

(TROY VI) 571 (4) Middle Bronze Age (Troy VI) 2645-2688 (figs. 255-257) No pure deposit of this horizon was identified in the excavations, and no remains of any structure that could with certainty be assigned to it. But a considerable number of sherds with traces of matt-painted decoration, and some fragments of grey Minyan ware, mostly from Areas D and F, evidently reflect occupation at Emporio during the period covered by the early phases of Troy VI. Large fragments of two matt-painted jugs (2658-9) from Area F suggest that at least one building level of this period had existed on the Acropolis hill. Some of the matt-painted designs and shapes seem to reflect Cretan influence of the periods Middle Minoan III B-Late Minoan I A, which suggests a date after the middle of the seventeenth century b.c. and into the sixteenth. The grey Minyan similarly appears to be of an advanced type, and some or all of it might be contemporary with the matt-painted. But while all the fragments of matt-painted came from mixed surface levels or levels from which Late Bronze Age or Mycenaean pottery was reported, a few pieces of grey Minyan were from contexts that seemed earlier. Fragments of late matt-painted ware and one fragment at least of grey Minyan were found in a walled bothros at Tigani in Samos along with Mycenaean painted ware and plain cups akin to our Late Bronze Age/Mycenaean types 1 1 and 12 {Tigani 1 17 f., 194). The contents of this and of other late pits at Tigani appear to date for the most part to the beginning of the Late Bronze Age (early Mycenaean in Greek mainland terms) (Samos xiv 134 ff., 137). While the matt-painted ware found at Emporio appears to be of local fabric, most if not all of the grey Minyan was evidently imported. ( 1 ) Grey ware including Minyan 2645-2654 (fig. 255) This was not common, and was only represented by about 36 fragments, of which 15 belonging to at least eight vases came from Area D, while 2 1 belonging to more than five vases were from Area F. Five of the fragments from Area F were reported to be from levels assignable to Period I, including B 8 and D East 6A and ?6. All fragments of this later grey ware from Emporio appear to belong to vases made on the fast wheel; in most cases wheel marks are clearly visible. Several of the fragments are of standard Minyan ware, the clay being grey throughout and the surface finely burnished. But other fragments with grey or grey-brown clay are also included here; the fabric of these is described. Their comparative rarity suggests that all these grey wares were imported, whether from the mainland of Greece or from Anatolia. In most cases the clay had traces of mica, indicative of a foreign origin. But some fragments of vases of typical Minyan fabric and shape (e.g. 2654) had no such traces, and there appeared to be no mica in the clay of the jugs 2652-3. ( 1 ) Cups and bowls 2645. (Area D, Q2/1) (plate 113) Two fragments of rim, one with stump of vertical strap handle; ring foot which may belong to same vase. Grey-brown clay with good deal of mica; surface burnished.

(2) Matt-painted ware 2655-2688 (figs. 256, 257) GENERAL This was much more in evidence than grey Minyan, and most of it at any rate seemed to be of local manufacture. The matt-painted ware of Emporio does not closely resemble that of the Middle Helladic period on the Greek mainland, but like the later matt-painted of the Cyclades it shows signs of being strongly influenced by the dark-on-light painted pottery which began to replace the light-on-dark of Middle Minoan tradition in Crete in Middle Minoan III B-Late Minoan I A. Much of this early dark-on-light pottery in Crete was decorated in two colours, red as well as black, and bichrome decoration of this kind is similarly prominent on the matt-painted ware of Emporio. The Emporio matt-painted is in effect a simplified local version of Cycladic matt-painted as known from sites like Phylakopi in Melos. SHAPES One virtually complete jug (2658) and large parts of another (2659) were recovered, together with over 200 fragments (about 1 10 of them from Area F and over 100 from Area D) bearing traces of matt-painted decoration. Most of the rims and nearly all the body fragments appeared to be from closed vases of some kind. A few rims, however, certainly belonged to bowls or cups; the everted rims 2656-7 may have come from handled cups of a type current in Crete during Middle Minoan III B-Late Minoan I A and imitated in Melos (e.g. Phylakopi pl. xxvi: 1,3). One section of a small strap handle may have belonged to a cup. Most of the rims evidently came from jars. One (2660) was thickened on the inside like some metal-imitating rims of Cretan vases. The bridge-spout 2661 is also reminiscent of Crete, as is the strainer base 2675. A fragment from a closed vase (plate i 16 (b) no. 3) has a rib around the join of neck and shoulder. Ribs at the base of the neck like this are a regular feature of jugs of the</page><page sequence="166">574 HI. EMPORIO Middle Minoan III B-Late Minoan I A horizon in Crete. The two largely completejugs 2658-9 had carinated bellies. Fragments of jug spouts are shown on plate i 15 (b) nos. 2, 3. Handles of jugs were usually set to their rims. Jug and jar handles were mostly circular, sometimes thick oval, in section; one (2673) was kidney-shaped. A thin strap handle (plate i 14 (è) no. 4) may come from a jug, like the circular-sectioned handles set to rims on plate i 14 (é), cf. 2673. Other circular-sectioned handles were set below rims, however, like plate 115(6) no. 6. One handle (2674) had a long cut at the lower end, made before firing and perhaps to facilitate it. FABRIC Some of the fragments with matt-painted decoration from Emporio may have come from handmade vases, but most show clear signs of the fast wheel. The clay was normally orange, but where the firing had been more intense it might be reddish or purplish in colour. The firing appears to have been somewhat irregular; and although the fabric was usually rather soft, in some cases it was very hard. It was noted - but the impression may have been a false one - that fragments from Area F tended to be of harder fabric, as if they had been subjected to more intensive firing, suggestive of a later date for them than for the bulk of the matt-painted ware from Area D. The clay was often rather sandy, and might have mica showing in it. But in spite of the mica the quantity of matt-painted ware recovered suggests that the bulk of it was locally made, although some fragments, like 268 1 , may come from imported vases. The outside surface usually had a slip, which might be a light shade of orange or buff, or in many cases greenish; the surface was normally quite even, but not smoothed or burnished. DECORATION The decoration was in black, or more often than not, in black and red combined. The paint was usually thick, standing out in marked relief from the surface of the vase. It was almost invariably matt; the rim 2669 was unique in having a lustrous black wash on the inside. The fragment 2672 from Area B is atypical in several respects. It seems to come from a handmade vase, and the handle surmounted by a wart is of a traditional Early Bronze Age type; the clay is brick-red, and the surface has a greenish slip smoothed or burnished; the painted decoration appears to have been in matt red-brown. Some sherds of matt-painted ware from Tigani on Samos ( Tigani 166, 194, pls. 49: 3, 4; 70: 1 ) sound comparable with this matt-painted ware of Emporio, which in fabric and decoration evidently corresponds to that of the Middle and the early part of the Late Bronze Age in the Cyclades and on the Greek mainland. The bichrome decoration in black and red in particular is reminiscent of the Melian Black and Red ware with shapes and designs inspired by those of Cretan pottery of Middle Minoan III B-Late Minoan I A (Phylakopi 118 ff.). The Emporio repertory of designs is very much more basic in character, but similarly appears to reflect the influence of Cretan vase decoration ofthat horizon. While more complex Cretan motifs taken from nature (Plant Style) are lacking on the Emporio matt-painted ware, nearly all the motifs found on it can be paralleled on Cretan vases of the Middle Minoan III B and Late Minoan I A periods: namely groups of horizontal bands, alternately red and black; wavy bands, single or multiple; foliate bands; running spirals; and cross-hatching or lattice. Horizontal bands (e.g. plate 116 (b) nos. 9, 10). Groups of these were evidently common on</page><page sequence="167">fig. 256. Matt-painted ware. Scale 1/2. 3. M. B. A.

EMPORIO jugs and jars, especially it would seem round the lower parts of the bodies; and they were often alternately black and red as on the jug 2658. The same system of alternate red and black horizontal bands is found on jugs and jars of Middle Minoan III B-Late Minoan I A in Crete. Wavy bands. These may be single, as on 2676 (plate 1 16 (a)), or multiple (e.g. 2678-9, and plate 1 16 (à) nos. 1 1- 13). As in Crete in Middle Minoan III B- Late Minoan I A, multiple wavy bands are much in evidence, running horizontally round the body of the vase, or in one case at any rate used as filling ornament (2680 on plate 116 (b)). The wavy band shows a tendency to degenerate into a saw-like band (e.g. plate 116 (a) no. 7), which merges into a band with a fringe of pendants below as seen on the jugs 2658-9. Foliate bands. One straight foliate band (2681) was noted, and one that was apparently spiraliform (2682 on plate 115 (a)). The fragment 2681 with the straight foliate band may be from an imported vase. A matt-painted fragment from Athens has a foliate band of this type (Hesperia ii (1933) 360 fig. 31). Running spirals (e.g. 2683 and plate 116 (b) nos. 5, 8, 9). These were evidently not uncommon. The spirals might be open-centred like 2683, and the angles between them were sometimes filled with ornament as was the fashion in Crete during Middle Minoan III B-Late Minoan I A (e.g. 2684 with a dot in the angle; 2685 with three crosses). Rows of spots. Two rows of rather irregular spots appear on the fragment 2686 (plate i 16 (a)). Cross-hatching (lattice). This was only attested on 2671 (plate 115 (a)). Rockwork. What may be a reminiscence of a very characteristic although not common motif on Cretan vases of Middle Minoan III B-Late Minoan I A appears on two fragments, 2686-7. Handles. These were normally decorated with straight hatching in black or alternate red and black (e.g. plate i i 4 (b) ) . But the handle 2674 (plate i i 4 (d) ) of thin oval section evidently had a pair of vertical black stripes down its length. CATALOGUE 2655. (Surface) (plate 115 (b)) Rim of bowl, cf. type 14 C.

(5) Prehistoric pottery from the area of the Early Christian basilica church 2689-2699 (fig. 258 and Plan, fig. 48) Some deposits with fragments of prehistoric pottery were encountered during the excavation of the Early Christian basilica church. None of this pottery looked as it if need be earlier than Period II. The pottery from the lowest levels reached in (A) trench U on the south side of the apse of the church was of Period II date, and the deposit above them was assignable to the horizon of Period I (Troy II) if not later (Troy III-V). A deposit which appeared to be contemporary with this was struck in (B) trench RR inside the northern part of the apse; but twelve scraps of pottery from level 1 1 in (C) trench M in the south aisle of the church were all handmade and might date from Period II rather than later like the material from the lowest levels in (A) trench U. One or two scraps of prehistoric pottery were recovered further west in (D) trench T, and seven scraps - mostly at any rate from wheelmade vases - in level 5 of (E) trench N just north-west of trench T. This material seemed distinctly late, and might belong to the horizon of Troy III-V or to the Middle Bronze Age (Troy VI). Sections will appear with Roman Emporio. (A) Trench U. Inside the apse of the church on the south ( 1 ) Level 1 1 . Period II (?) .

(6) Late Bronze Age and Mycenaean Pottery (a) General The Late Bronze Age and Mycenaean pottery found at Emporio mostly came from three areas: from parts of the settlement on the northern side of the Acropolis hill (Area F) and on its lower western slopes (Area D), and from a cist grave (tomb 3) in Area E. The dominant character of the pottery recovered was Mycenaean III C, and nearly all the complete or restorable vases with painted decoration were assignable to that period. But there was some evidence for a Mycenaean presence at Emporio before Mycenaean III C. Two Mycenaean building levels were identified in Area D. The earlier of these (stage I) ended with a destruction by fire. Both it and the later building level (stage II) appeared to belong to Mycenaean III C. The walls of stage II were on a rather different alignment from those of stage I. The stage I buildings evidently consisted of groups of rectangular rooms. Little was left of those of stage II. Two or perhaps three building levels assignable to the Late Bronze Age were identified in Area F. The latest of these (stage 7) ended with abandonment or destruction in Mycenaean III C. A number of complete or restorable Mycenaean III C vases were recovered from above the floor of a house in trenches B, J, K (walls 36, 37, 40). The earlier building level (or levels) of stage</page><page sequence="172">580 III. EMPORIO 6, represented by two successive floors in trenches B and F, may have fallen entirely within the Late Bronze Age, but in a period before there was any Mycenaean presence at Emporio. The buildings of this stage were on a different alignment from those of stage 7. Some of the pottery discussed below clearly belonged to stage 6 and to a pre-Mycenaean phase in the history of the settlement. This non-Mycenaean pottery included bowls of type 4 and plain cups with handles of type 1 1 , as well as many if not all of the plain handleless cups grouped under type 12, together with thejugs of types 15 and 16 and the pithoi of type 24. The two best preserved vases of matt-painted ware (2658-9) came from deposits of stage 6 in trenches F and K. Much if not all of the matt-painted ware from Emporio probably belongs to this horizon and dates from the earlier part of the Late Bronze Age. There was evidence to suggest that Emporio was already a Mycenaean settlement in Mycenaean III B. Desborough, who made a careful study of all the Myceanaean pottery kept from the excavations, was of the opinion that only one or two sherds were earlier than III B, and that there was not much III B (LMS 33, 159). But the four vases from the cist grave (tomb 3) were all Mycenaean and were assignable to III B and not later. Moreover, a number of fragments of Mycenaean pottery found scattered in the surface levels of Area D look older than III C and may derive from occupation deposits of an earlier phase of Mycenaean that had existed higher on the slopes of the Acropolis hill from which they had washed down. Mycenaean occupation at Emporio may therefore have begun in Mycenaean III B: it is even possible that successive Mycenaean groups followed each other at Emporio as they appear to have done at Lefkandi (Lejkandi 34); but no building level and no floors that could be assigned to Mycenaean III B were identified in the areas excavated. The final destruction or abandonment of the Mycenaean III C settlement at Emporio may have taken place at a relatively late stage of the period. The solitary askos (2852) with late affinities seemed to be assignable to the latest building level (stage II) in Area D. Vases from Area F belonging to stage 7 included amphorai of a late type with handles to the neck instead of to the rim: the most complete of these (2838), which had been repaired with rivets in ancient times, corresponds to Furumark's type 70, ascribed to a late phase of his Mycenaean III C 1. Conical bowls of type 2 identical in their system of decoration with 2704 from Emporio were recovered from Lefkandi Phase III and from the Temple deposit at Ayia Irini on Kea, both assigned by J. Rutter, Hesperia xlviii (1979) 383 f., to his fifth and last phase of Myc III C. S. Iakovidis, AJA lxxxiii (1979) 455 ill. 1 No. 42, similarly places conical bowls like 2704 in his third and last phase (c) of L.H. Ill C 1 immediately before L.H. Ill C 2 equated with Submycenaean. There are also comparable bowls from Tarsus in Cilicia. Desborough, LMS 159, noted that the deep bowls with an overall wash or decoration of a simple character suggest an advanced stage of III C. He also observed, however, that there was little from Emporio to indicate the latest phase of III C as found on the mainland of Greece; although this did not necessarily mean that some of the Emporio pottery was not contemporary with it, since it would be reasonable to expect some degree of conservatism, a time-lag in fashion, here on the fringes of the Mycenaean world. Decoration of double or triple wavy lines as on 273 1 and plate i 29 (e) is characteristic of late III C according to Schachermeyr, Die myk. £eit 301 (see also under 2731). Double and triple wavy lines are prominent on Mycenaean type pottery from Enkomi in Cyprus including that from the very late Level III C (Enkomi iiia pl. 84). A number of fragments came from vases that were not Mycenaean in fabric, and had features such as incised decoration and warts found on Trojan pottery in the horizon of Troy VI-VII. Some of these could belong to the Middle Bronze Age or the earlier part of the Late Bronze Age.</page><page sequence="173">3. L. B. A. &amp; MYCENAEAN.

Lamps See Appendix B for Table of Quantities (c) Fabric of the Mycenaean vases The smaller vases, as might be expected, tended to be distinctly better in fabric and more thoroughly fired than the larger ones. But in general the clay was not well refined, and</page><page sequence="174">582 III. EMPORIO occasional lumps of grit were often apparent in the surfaces even of small decorated vases with thin walls, like some of the little bowls of type 2. The clay was normally shades of orange or buff, sometimes green, and occasionally white in colour. The use of white clay seemed to be largely confined to some bowls of types 2 and 3, and to kylikes (type 8). This white fabric may correspond to the 'white ware' which is a feature of the latest Phase III of Myc. Ill C at Lefkandi (BSA lxvi (1971) 334, 344) . Vases from the Myc. Ill C Temple deposit at Ayia Irini on Kea, which look very comparable in shape and style of decoration with ones from Emporio, were apparently of similar ware (Hesperia xli (1972) 400). Some vases (including several kraters) of White Ware have been identified from Myc. Ill C deposits at Corinth contemporary it seems with Lefkandi Phase II b (J. Rutter, Hesperia xlviii (1979) 370 f., 390 and note 37 for the character of Corinthian White Ware). Traces of fine silvery mica were often visible in the clay, and the presence of mica appears to have been normal in the Mycenaean pottery of Emporio. This is in striking contrast to the lack of mica in the pottery of earlier phases of the Bronze Age there: the signs of mica in this were so exceptional that they were taken to be a safe indication of foreign origin. It is difficult, however, to believe that the bulk of the Mycenaean ware with traces of mica in it found at Emporio was not made in the area. Most of the kylikes (type 8) and some vases of other types had a dark overall wash and no decoration. The presence of many fragments of small vases with an overall dark wash appears to have been a feature of the latest Mycenaean, assignable to Myc. Ill C, at Phylakopi in Melos (BSA xvii (1910-11) 19). Where vases had painted decoration they were normally first given a slip which was a paler shade of orange or buff than the body clay, or (notably in the case of jars of types 17 and 18) greenish in colour. A white slip or wash is found on some decorated vases of various types, especially on bowls of type 2. The surfaces of decorated vases were normally smoothed or burnished. The paint used for decoration ranges from red through shades of brown to black, and may vary a good deal in colour on the same vase. While the paint sometimes has a high lustre, it is often only slightly lustrous, and upon occasion appears quite matt; but in some cases at least this matt appearance may be the effect of wear. (d) From the cemetery (Area E) 2700-2703 (fig. 260. plate 117) Four vases were recovered from a cist grave (tomb 3) in Area E on the slope facing the Acropolis hill. None were of types recognised from the settlement, except for the plain handleless cup 2702. This group of vases seems assignable to Myc. Ill B, but not necessarily to the end of the period. The cup 2702 in particular might pass for Myc. Ill A 2. 2700. Shallow semi-globular cup with one horizontal handle (type 1). Complete and unbroken. Ht. 5. Diam. 15.

(e) From the settlement (Areas D and F) 2704-3000 (figs. 261-281) The stratigraphie evidence for Late Bronze Age and Mycenaean occupation in Areas D and F was not altogether satisfactory. The relevant deposits were much telescoped and separated by earth floors which were difficult to detect, while the walls of buildings were for the most part only preserved in patches. The two building levels (stages I and II) identified in trench Qof Area D (figs. 79, 81) both appeared to belong to Myc. Ill C. The earlier of these, stage I, ended with a fire. Only one Mycenaean building level (stage 7) was noted in Area F (Plan, fig. 89). The building level or levels (stage 6) below this and above the horizon of stage 4 (Period I) seemed to be assignable to a non-Mycenaean phase of the Late Bronze Age (Plan, fig. 88) . Two floor levels of stage 6 were visible in the eastern section of trench B (fig. 91 ), and two, which may or may not have corresponded to those in trench B, were noted in trench F (fig. 95, with restored section). But the situation in trench D was obscure, and while the apparent levels in which pottery was found there are given in the Catalogue, no attempt has been made to assign the levels to stages (Sections, figs. 93, 94). When the study of the pottery from stages 6-8 in Area F was first undertaken it seemed that no safe stratigraphie observations could be made, and that Mycenaean wares occurred in deposits of all three stages. It was therefore decided to treat the pottery from these three stages together. The matt-painted and Minyan wares, however, were obviously earlier than the Mycenaean occupation at Emporio, and assignable to the Middle or the beginning of the Late</page><page sequence="176">fig. 261. Mycenaean type 2: conical bowls. Scale 1/3. 584 III. EMPORIO Bronze Age. In view of this they were ascribed to a stage 5 between stage 4 of Period I and stage 6. It was only after the final publication numbers had been given to the pottery that it became clear that the Myc. Ill C material, forming the great bulk of the Mycenaean, could only in fact be assigned to stages 7 and 8, and that the deposits of stage 6 must date from an earlier phase of the Late Bronze Age. Some at any rate of the matt-painted ware including the two most complete vases (2658-9) evidently belonged to stage 6. The pre-stage I levels in Area D similarly appeared to contain material of this horizon. In the Catalogue the area (mostly D or F) is given first in italics, followed by the trench and level, and the stage where known. 2 . Conical bowls with one horizontal handle 2 704-2 709 (fig. 261) These appear to have been used as drinking cups, and correspond to Furumark's type 242. Such bowls were not common at Emporio; they were recorded, however, from both the earlier and the later Mycenaean horizons (stages I and II) in Area D and from stages 6B and 7 in Area F; but none were attested from stage 6A in F. Outside surfaces were normally light-coloured, often with a whitish slip. They were frequently decorated with a horizontal stripe or band around the rim or just below it, and with other stripes round the body; but one of the two complete profiles from Area D (2705) had the outside coated with an overall wash except for a pair of reserved bands below the rim. Insides were normally given an overall wash, usually red but often black in colour. The two complete profiles (2704-5) from Area D both had a reserved circle at the bottom of the base. But six rims from Area F (nearly one-fifth of the total number, about 28 in all, assignable to bowls of type 2) were decorated with horizontal stripes on a light ground inside as well as out. None of these rims from Area F were clearly stratified, but a fragment from the lower Mycenaean building level (stage I) in Area D, with a whitish slip similarly decorated with horizontal bands in lustrous black paint, appears to come from a type 2 bowl. A small base (2922) from a pre-stage I deposit in Area D, decorated with a spiral inside and horizontal bands outside, might also have belonged to a bowl of this type in spite of the early context. Furumark only lists four examples under his type 242. The first of these, from the Acropolis at Athens, is very crude and not like our type 2 (ADelt i (191 5) Par. 37 no. 49). More closely comparable, although small, is Furumark's no. 2 from the Kolonaki cemetery at Thebes assigned to Myc. Ill B (ADelt iii (1917) 127 no. 5 fig. 90: 7). The variety with high conical foot like one from Tragana dated by Furumark to the very end of Myc. Ill C (AE 19 14, 105 no. 6 fig. 6: 5) was not in evidence at Emporio. Bowls of this type with one horizontal handle appear to have been at home in Athens, however, and many fragments of them were recovered from the Mycenaean spring deposit on the north side of the Acropolis there (O. Broneer, Hesperia viii (1939) 337 ff. figs. 59, 60.</page><page sequence="177">fig. 262. Mycenaean type 3: small deep rounded bowls with horizontal handles. 3. L. B. A. &amp; MYCENAEAN. AREAS D &amp; F 585 Desborough, LMS i5g). Broneer suggested that the shape might have originated in Attica, and S tubbings noted a possible ancestor in a deep version of our type i (2700) common in Attica but extremely rare in the Péloponnèse (BSA xlii (1947) 59, 35, 33 fig. 14: C). Type 2 bowls are very rare in the Argolid, and have not yet been found in the Corinthia, according to J. Rutter, Hesperia xlviii (1979) 370. The Emporio type 2 bowls seem to be closely akin to those from the Athens Acropolis spring deposit. At Lefkandi such bowls appear in Phase II of Myc. Ill C, and in Phase III almost entirely replace the kylix as the normal drinking vessel (Lejkandi 14 fig. 20, 22 fig. 52.ÄS^41xvi (1971) 340 ff.). Five were recovered from the Perate cemetery; Iakovidis comments that they are characteristic of the second half of Myc. Ill C 1 (Perate ii 222-4). Iakovidis reports bowls of this kind from Naxos, where they have been found both in tombs and in the Grotta settlement (Perate ii 223); several, including unusually large examples, are on exhibition in Naxos Museum. Such bowls have also been recovered in Cos, at Enkomi in Cyprus, and in the Myc. Ill C horizon at Tarsus where they seem to have been common (Cos 292 fig. 260: a.

There was a great deal of variation in the fabric of type 3 bowls; the coarser, more thick- walled examples merge into bowls of type 4, which are in effect crude, and usually somewhat large varieties of type 3. Type 3 bowl rims fell into three classes: (A) Rims with a dark wash inside and out, as Perate classes 1-3 (Perate ii 220 f.). The wash covers the whole of the inside and outside, or a wide area below the rim, and ranges in colour from red through brown to black. Small scraps of rim with an overall wash were hard to assign as between type 3 bowls and kylikes (type 8), but it looks as if between one in three and one in four bowls of type 3 at Emporio had a wash covering most of the inside and outside. At Lefkandi rims of type 3 bowls were mostly as class (A) in the earliest Phase I of Myc. Ill C there {Lefkandi 16 fig. 27). A number of class (A) rims from Emporio have a reserved band just below the top inside (e.g. 271 1-13, 2727). At Lefkandi reserved lines inside the rim began to come into fashion in Phase II, and were general there it seems by Phase III {Lefkandi 19, 22. BSA lxvi (1971) 340). The complete profile 2729 has a reserved band inside the rim, and a reserved circle in the bottom of the base as well. A reserved circle in the bottom of the base may have been not unusual at Emporio (e.g. 2921); but a number of bases of type 3 bowls seem to have been covered with a</page><page sequence="179">3. L. B. A. &amp; MYCENAEAN. AREAS D &amp; F 587 solid wash inside. Some at any rate of the bowls with an overall wash and reserved band round the inside of the rim also had a stripe reserved around the lower part of the body outside, like 2727. One fragment (Area D, QJevel 2, stage II), which might have come from a type 3 bowl, had a poor lustrous wash of purple-brown colour with traces of horizontal bands in thick red paint over it inside and out. (B) Rims with an overall wash inside, but a light ground outside, as Perate classes 4 and 5 (Perate ii 221). Most of these rims had a band of paint round the top (or in one case at least just below the top) on the outside. The body of the bowl below this band might be decorated with horizontal bands, or wavy bands or stripes of varying degrees of thickness (e.g. 2716, 2722-4, 2729-31); but sometimes the decoration on the outside was more elaborate in character (e.g. 2715, 2717-21). Some class (B) rims, like a number of those of class (A), had a reserved band below the top inside (e.g. 2716, 2722, 2729-30, 2732). (C) Rims without an overall wash inside or out. Bowls with rims of this class might be decorated with a wavy band on the outside like 2724. Bowls from Area F are described first (2710-2724), followed by ones from Area D (2725-2736).

At Perate double wavy bands of this kind were exceptional, and only appeared on vases belonging with the latest burials in the tombs where they were found (Perate ii 105). But double wavy bands occur on vases from House G at Asine assigned by Furumark to Myc. Ill C: 1 b transitional to c [Op Arch iii (1944) 206, 209 fig. 3: 10, 1 2.

Scale 1/3. base 2741 (the latter two from pre-stage I deposits in Area D) seem to correspond in a general way to Troy shape A 57 which was at home in the early and middle phases of Troy VI ( Troy iii 45). But a two-handled krater-bowl with ring base of a somewhat comparable type occurs at Pylos (PNestor i 397 ff. pl. 376, type 60), and rims like 2739 and 2740 may come from Mycenaean vases akin to this. Such vases would have been in effect crude and somewhat large versions of type 4 bowls merging into ones of type 5. Some rims have only a slight S-curve, and others are virtually straight. In some cases the swelling has a slight carination. Bases were evidently of the ring type like 2471. The bowls were coated inside and out with a dark wash, which was normally rather thin and only slightly lustrous, shades of red, or less commonly purple-brown or black in colour.</page><page sequence="182">590 III.

Several large fragments together with a number of scraps from bowls of this kind were recovered. All it seems were light surfaced, and several were elaborately decorated. There was evidently a good deal of variation both in fabric and in rim-shape: the rim of 2742 is simple, that of 2743 flat-topped, and that of 2744 everted. 2742.

Deep conical bowls (kalathoi) 2757-2759 (fig. 266) Bowls of this type do not seem to have been common at Emporio. Similarly at Lefkandi such bowls (kalathoi) occurred in Phase II of Myc.

A good many, however, were recovered from the Perate cemetery of more or less contemporary date (Perate ii 252 ff.). The few examples from Emporio all appear to correspond to Furumark's latest variety (type 291) assigned to Myc. Ill C 1 (e.g. BSA xxv (1921-23) 53 pl. xi: 1, from Mycenae). One of the handles of 2757 and the stump of a handle on 2759 are associated with imitations of the rivets by which the handles of metal bowls of this shape were fastened.</page><page sequence="185">3.

Kylikes ( stemmed cups ), with pair of low strap handles 2766-2793 (figs. 267, 268) This distinctive type of drinking cup appears to have been quite common at Emporio, but the kylix with high-swung handles (type 8B) was hardly represented. Three main varieties of type 8A could be distinguished: (1) Small, rather squat, as Pylos shape 29a; (2) Tall with shallow bowl and high stem, as Furumark type 259; (3) Straight-sides with deep bowl, as Furumark type 274. On the analogy of Pylos it was assumed that kylikes of variety ( 1 ) at Emporio were two-handled. But in the tholos tomb at Tragana one-handled kylikes of comparable shape, mostly with an overall black wash, are said to have been common (AE 19 14, 1 10 f. fig. 20, left). Common, but less in evidence at Tragana were kylikes as variety (3) of Emporio type 8A, while only four fragments had high-swung handles as Emporio type 8 B (ibid. 1 1 1 fig. 20, right). ( 1 ) Small, rather squat kylix, as Pylos shape 2ga. The only complete kylix profile recovered at Emporio (2766) belonged to this variety. In this the rim diameter is less than 1 5, and the height is rather less than the diameter. But some, if not most, of the rims grouped under this variety may have belonged to taller kylikes of more standard types recorded by Furumark (e.g. FMP type 266) . These rims are all more or less upright; most have a lip, but some lipless rims (as 2783-4) may have come from kylikes. The kylikes grouped here, whether they were of this squat variety like 2766 or of more standard types, were usually of rather coarse fabric, and not very well made or regular in shape. The clay was tempered with grit, which often showed in the surface. This was normally smoothed or burnished after the application of an overall, rather poor lustrous wash, most</page><page sequence="186">594 III. EMPORIO commonly reddish in colour, but often shades of purple-brown to black; the wash usually, though not always, covered the underneath of the foot as well as the outside and inside of the vase. Some fragments, however, which appeared to come from kylikes, had a light orange or buff slip instead of a dark overall wash. Cf. PJVestor i 368 shape 29a. One of the two types of kylix from the destruction level at Koukounaries on Paros similarly dated to late Myc. Ill B appears comparable (Davis and Cherry 1 60, 1 73 fig. 1 9) . A kylix from Khasambali in Thessaly with an overall red wash assigned by M. Theochares to FMP type 264 (Myc. Ill A) looks similar (Thessalika iv (1962) 46, 44 fig. 10). Some of the kylikes grouped under shapes A 84 and A 85 as found in the Middle and Late Subphase of Troy VI may also be akin to this variety. Tall kylikes (diameter of bowl less than height) with an overall wash occur in Lesbos (e.g. BSA xxxi ( 1 930-3 1 ) 1 70 pl. xxviii: 2 from Antissa, as FMP type 266) . A fragment of a kylix with an overall wash from Kazanli in Cilicia in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, was shown to me by Mr. T. Burton Brown. A number of upright rims as 2769 evidently belonged to larger kylikes of this or other shapes. Some of these rims were plain, with a slip or an overall dark wash; but a few had painted decoration (e.g. 2770-3). (2) Tall kylix with shallow bowl and high stem, as Furumark type 25g. A very few fragments were assignable to kylikes of this shape. Such kylikes appear to have been at home in the eastern Aegean, and there are good parallels from Rhodes for the system of decoration on 2774 as well as for its shape as reconstructed. The fabric of the few fragments classifiable under varieties (2) and (3) was markedly superior to that of the bulk of the material assigned to variety (1). Possibly therefore the kylikes represented by these varieties were imported from elsewhere. (3) Straight-sided kylix with deep bowl, as Furumark types 274, 273. This standard Myc. Ill C shape was only represented for certain by one large fragment (2776) and a couple of rims; but three other rims with more or less distinct carinations (2779-81) may come from kylikes akin to this. This corresponds to Broneer's variety b from the Mycenaean spring deposit at Athens (Hesperia viii (1939) 375 ff. pl. 58: a). Two kylikes of this type with simple banded decoration on bowl and stem were recovered from the Myc. Ill C Temple deposit at Ayia Irini on Kea (Hesperia xli (1972) 400 pl. 98, M 1 and 2). The kylikes from Myc. Ill C levels at Lefkandi correspond to this type; rare in Phase I, they occur in Phase II, but have been entirely replaced by cups of our type 2 in Phase III (Leflcandi 16 fig. 27; 19 figs. 49, 50; 22). Kylikes were not common at Lefkandi in any phase of the Myc. Ill C occupation there, and only three were recovered from the extensive Myc. Ill C cemetery at Perate [Per ate ii 224 f.) . The relative abundance of the kylikes grouped under variety ( 1 ) therefore suggests the possibility that they are of an earlier, Myc. Ill B date, like the closest parallels for them from Pylos and elsewhere. A number of fragments of kylikes attributable to variety ( 1 ) were reported from pre-stage I deposits in Area D. The comparative rarity of the obviously Myc. Ill C kylikes of variety (3), and the absence of bulged or ridged stems at Emporio, suggest that the kylix may have gone out of use as a form of drinking cup before the end of the Mycenaean occupation there as at Lefkandi. The stems of kylikes of type 8 A ranged from medium to tall like that of 2774 of variety (2).</page><page sequence="187">fig. 267. Mycenaean type 8: kylikes. 3. L. B. A. &amp; MYCENAEAN. AREAS D &amp; F 595 The taller stems tended to have a noticeable taper, becoming thinner towards the foot. One fragment of stem (plate 122 (a) no. 1 ) had a hole running through its length - a feature common in kylix stems found in Crete, but unusual in those of the Greek mainland, although it occurs in a stem from Marmariane in Thessaly in the Sherd Collection of the British School at Athens (plate 122 (a) no. 2). Feet were mostly varieties of 2795; but about one third of the total number recovered were as 2796. One foot, however, apparently from a kylix, was altogether flat (2797). In some cases it was clear that the kylix had not been made in a single operation, the bowl and the stem having been thrown on the wheel separately, and joined together afterwards while the clay was still wet. A conical projection left at the foot of the bowl was then fitted into a depression at the top of the stem. The conical projection might be scored with gashes to give a better purchase for the clay cement, as visible on 2769. Some kylikes from Karfi in Crete were fitted together in a comparable manner (BSA lv (i960) 25 pl. 12 (¿)). A number of kylikes of comparatively fine fabric were light-surfaced and had painted decoration. Some nine or ten rims and body fragments of such decorated kylikes were recovered from Area F, and eight or nine from Area D. In addition there were four kylix stems from Area F with stripes round them (e.g. 2772 of variety (2)), and four others from Area D. At a rough estimate it would seem that about one in every ten kylikes in use at Emporio had painted decoration. Some if not all of these painted kylikes may have been imports.

Kylix (stemmed cup), with high-swung handles Two long handles of oval section with an overall red shading to black lustrous wash may come from kylikes of this type, more at home in Myc.

Small one-handled kylix (stemmed cup) The fragment 2798 with a marked carination might come from a kylix akin to FMP type 267. Cf. PNestor i 366 f., shape 27. One of the two versions of kylix from the late Myc. Ill B destruction level at Koukounaries on Paros is of this type (Davis and Cherry 160, 173 fig. 19). But the type continues into Myc. Ill C. Examples were recovered from the Mycenaean spring deposit at Athens (Broneer, Hesperia viii (1939) 376 f. fig. 58: b, c, shape 7 c). 2798. (F, B, stages 5-7) (fig. 268) Rim with stump of handle. Orange clay; surface smoothed. 9. Semi-globular cups Some of the rims classified as belonging to kylikes may in fact come from cups of this type which corresponds to FMP type 215 assigned to Myc. Ill C 1 early. Many examples of this and allied types, including plain ones like 2799, were recovered from the Perate cemetery [Per ate ii 2 1 3 ff.) . In shape 2799 corresponds to variety Bat Pera te (ibid. 216). Cf. 2?&amp;4xxv (1921-23) pl. xi, j, from Mycenae: Granary Class. Cups of this type, but with simple decoration, were the normal drinking vessel in Phase I of Myc. Ill C at Lefkandi, being less in evidence in Phases II- III (Lefkandi 16, 19, 22 fig. 25). A plain example, and one with simple decoration, are illustrated from the Myc. Ill C Temple deposit at Ayia Irini on Kea [Hesperia xli (1972) 400 pl. 98, M 3 and 4). 2799.

AREAS D &amp; F 599 1 1. Plain cups with S-shaped rims and strap handles 2800-2803 (fig. 269) Rims of this type are characteristically S-shaped, but more or less straight rims occur on cruder versions like 2802. The thin strap handles normally rise high above the line of the rim. Bases are more or less splayed, and flat underneath; their flat under sides show concentric marks left when the vases were cut away with string from the turning wheel. The clay is orange or buff, occasionally with a greenish tinge. Surfaces are plain, unsmoothed or merely wet-smoothed, without any kind of decoration. Cups of this type were extremely common in the Late Bronze Age levels at Emporio. Fragments of them were recovered from above the earliest Late Bronze Age floor (stage 6A) in trench B of Area F, and they were well represented in later deposits of stage 6. This distinctive type appears to be a non-Mycenaean one that was current at Emporio in association with matt-painted ware before any Mycenaean occupation began there. Some plain handled cups assigned to Phase F (end of the Middle Bronze Age) at Ayia Irini on Kea are reminiscent of type 11 in shape, but are heavier and clumsier {Hesperia xli (1972) 391, 389 fig. 11, F 46). Handled cups from Thermi, interpreted as imitations of Late Helladic II ones from the Greek mainland, are somewhat comparable {Thermi 140 ff. pl. xviii no. 645). Even more closely comparable perhaps is a cup with thin strap handle found in the walled bothros at Tigani on Samos along with some Mycenaean painted ware; it was thought to be an import ( Tigani 1 1 7 f., 192 pl. 67).

Plain handleless cups 2804-281 1 (fig. 269) Like handled cups of type 1 1 these were extremely common and seemed to occur in about the same numbers. Three main varieties could be distinguished: ( 1 ) Tall with straight sides as 2804; (2) Tall with curving sides (2805-10); (3) Low with curving sides (281 1). Variety (1) seems to have been exceptional, and only a single example of it was noted. Tall cups of variety (2) appear to be somewhat more in evidence than those of (3) in the proportion of about 4:3. While variety (3) corresponds to the standard type of Myc. Ill handleless cup (e.g. FMP type 242. PNestor i 359 f., shape 1 1), variety (2) is much closer in shape to a type that was current in Crete in Late Minoan I. The tall cups of variety (2) are comparatively thin- walled and in fabric indistinguishable from cups of type 1 1 . But the low cups of variety (3) tend to be thick-walled and coarser in fabric, the clay being more sandy. No type 1 2 cups, however, appear to have had a slip or wash; the surfaces were invariably it seems untreated, without any kind of decoration. One or two rims of variety (3) were blackened, suggesting that the cups had been used as lamps, as was often the case with comparable handleless cups in Crete. In trench B of Area F at Emporio handleless cups were most numerous above the earlier Late Bronze Age floor (stage 6A), and the few virtually complete examples (2805, 2807, 281 1) are all assignable to this horizon. But profiles were recovered from deposits of stage 6B, and a number of fragments from those of stage 7. In trench Q,of Area D many fragments of handleless cups were reported from levels of stages I and II, although they also occurred in pre-stage I deposits there. Parallels for 2804 of variety ( 1 ) and for 28 1 1 of variety (3) are to hand at Ayia Irini on Kea in Phases F, G and H, covering the end of the Middle and the early part of the Late Bronze Age. At Tigani on Samos plain handleless cups of all three Emporio varieties were recovered from the walled bothros along with some Mycenaean painted ware {Tigani 1 17 f., 191 f. fig. 5: 3, 4). Handleless cups of all kinds were in abundant use in Crete for many different purposes in Late Minoan I and earlier, and the types and their prolific use eventually spread to mainland centres like Mycenae. But at Mycenae handleless cups become less common after the end of Late Helladic II, as they do in Crete after Late Minoan I (BSA xxv (1921-23) 151); while at Pylos it appeared probable that such cups were not in general use at the time of the destruction of the palace there towards the end of Myc.

Large jugs with trefoil mouths 2826-2827 (fig. 271) One complete jug of this type was recovered, and fragments of others. The complete example (2826) was very well stratified, as it was found standing in the pithos hearth L associated with the second Late Bronze Age floor (stage 6B) in trench B of Area F. The bases of these jugs appear to have been flat, or slightly rounded as in the case of 2826. The fabric tends to be somewhat coarse, the clay gritty, and orange in colour; the surface orange to buff, or with a greenish slip. One trefoil jug mouth was of cooking pot ware. Several fragments of comparable fabric, which might have come from jugs of this type or of the following type 16, had traces of simple decoration consisting of horizontal stripes round the base, body and neck, in red almost matt paint. But 2826 is plain and undecorated, and this may have been normal. Type 16 seems to correspond to the Trojan shape B 35, abundant throughout Troy VI, and still found in Troy VII A and B (Troy in 58 f., esp. fig. 321: 37.1058 (late Troy VI); Troyiv 33 f., 167). 2826.

Large jugs with flat circular mouths 2828 (fig. 271) Jugs of this type were only represented by fragments. In fabric they were indistinguishable from jugs of type 15. One fragment from a jug of this or similar type had part of a sign of some kind engraved while the clay was still soft before the greenish slip was applied. The base of the handle on 2828 was perforated, either for string, or to help the firing of the thick mass of clay in this part of the vase. Other fragments of handles that may have come from jugs of this or similar types were perforated at the top at the point of junction with the rim. 2828.

PJVestor i fig. 368 no. 608 (shape 37), with similar ridge at base of neck. Miscellaneous jug rims 2829-2832 (fig. 271) Various rims of similar fabric may have belonged to jugs of type 16 or allied types. Some of these were squared on the outside (2830) , others rolled (283 1 ) ; while several were distinctly hollow on the inside like 2829. One fragment of similar fabric to jugs of types 15 and 16, and with a thin green wash, evidently came from a large jug with cutaway neck. Two small cutaway spouts from smaller jugs were also of plain fabric like the large jugs of types 1 5 and 1 6.

One restorable hydria (2833) and fragments of others were recovered at Emporio. A large number of rims from hydrias, or from jugs or amphoras of basically similar shape, were hollow in the inside like the rim of 2833. Rims with hollow lips of this kind are said by Furumark to be characteristic of the Mainland pottery assignable to the later part of Myc. Ill C 1 (FMP 82). But at Lefkandi hollow lips are found as early as Phase I a of Myc. Ill C, although they become more marked in Phase 1 b and still occur in Phase III (BSA lxvi (1971) 333, 336, 335 fig. 1 no. 7, 345 fig. 7 no. 2). The decoration on 2833 consists of a bold double spiral on the swelling of the body, with a tassel (derived from a bud or spray) hanging from a band round the base of the neck. Such tassels/sprays are characteristic of the Myc. Ill C 1 Granary Style at Mycenae (FMP 409 Mot. 72 no. 7). While 2833 has a single tassel opposite the vertical handle, other vases of this shape from Emporio (whether hydrias or jugs) were decorated with several tassels, like a hydria from Mycenae (BSA xxv (1921-23) pl. x: f), and one from Phase 1 b of Myc. Ill C at Lefkandi (BSA lxvi ( 1 971) 335 fig. 1 no. 7). 2833. (F, J (B 4) , stage 7) (plate i 24) Broken; large parts including one of side handles missing. Ht. 48. Diam. of body 40, of rim 15.5. Hollow lip; vertical handle to rim; pair of circular-sectioned side handles on body. Rather soft fabric; orange clay. Decorated in lustrous red shading to dark red-brown: tassel (FMP Mot. 72 no. 7) on shoulder, above double spiral (FMP Mot. 48 no. 3), opposite vertical handle, which has a wavy band running down it.

The motif is still found in this position at the very end of the period (e.g. Kerameikos i pl. 26 no. 421, an amphora from Submycenaean Grave 67). Double spiral (scroll) and tassel appear together, but in a reversed position with the tassel below, on another hydria from Lefkandi Phase I b {Lefkandi 17 fig. 29 (BSA lxvi ( 197 1 ) pl. 51 no. 6), cf. an amphora from Mycenae (Wace, Chamber Tombs 7 no. 5 pl. xii)). 2834.

Amphoras 2828-2840 (fig. 272) These vessels resemble hydrias (type 1 7) in shape, but have a pair of vertical handles in place of one vertical and two side handles. Amphoras appear to have been less in evidence than hydrias at Emporio, and 2838, the most complete of the fragmentary examples recovered, had been mended in antiquity, which suggests that it was considered to be of some value. This fine vase and the few other fragments certainly attributable to type 18 have the handles with their tops set below the rim as FMP type 70. This type is assigned by Furumark to the later part of Myc. Ill C 1 . But at least one amphora with handles set below the rim in this manner was recovered at Pylos, destroyed at the end of Myc. Ill B, alongside others with handles to the rim like FMP type 69 (PNestor i 381 f. type 45, pl. 371 no. 675). 2838. (F,J (B 4), stage 7) (plate 124) Broken, large parts including base missing.

Ten rivet-holes (diam. 3-4 mm.), eight of them in pairs, made after firing. Rather gritty orange clay; surface orange buff, decorated in lustrous red: two elegant double spirals (FMP Mot. 48 no. 3) on shoulder between handles, which have snake-like wavy lines ending in blobs at top and thin tails at bottom. There is a similar amphora with comparable decoration from the Myc. Ill C Temple deposit at Ayia Irini on Kea [Hesperia xli (1972) 400 pl. 98, M 12). For snakes pictorialized from wavy lines in Myc.

Diam. of rim 16.5 Perforations at top and bottom of each handle as on 2838: one of the bottom perforations is sealed at one end, which suggests that they were not made for string, but for help in firing of the vase. Soft sandy orange clay; outside surface with a green wash, decorated in black to dark brown and shades of red-brown and red. 2840. (F9 B 2, stage 7) (plate i 25) Fragments, with stumps of a pair of vertical handles. Pale greenish clay; decorated in lustrous brown. An hour-glass (double axe) sign incised after firing below the base of one handle. This fragment was stolen from Chios Museum before it was studied and drawn. The hour-glass sign appears incised on vases of different periods in widely separated areas: e.g. Poliochni ii 280 pl. ccxxi: d, Yellow period; Tarsus ii 2 1 1 no. 1 149 fig. 319, among signs on L.B.

EMPORIO Rims probably from jugs , hydrias, or amphoras (types zó^/c?,) 2841-2843 (fig. 272) All of these rims are painted solid, and have the lip more or less hollow on the inside. 2841.

Amphoriskos 2844 (fig. 272) One rim, with a reserved band round the inside of the lip, may come from an amphoriskos (FMP type 59) of the kind at home in Myc. Ill C and well represented at Ialysos in Rhodes. The shape may have originated in the Dodecanese according to Desborough, LMS 8, 13. But amphoriskoi were evidently common at Lefkandi in Phase I of Myc. Ill C, although still found there in Phase II (BSA lxvi (1971) 336, 343 fig. 6 no. 2). The reserved line inside the rim of 2844 suggests a mature phase of Myc. Ill C: at Lefkandi the reserved line was introduced on the inside of the rim of deep bowls in Phase II (BSA lxvi (1971) 340). There are comparable amphoriskos rims from Tarsus (E. French, AS xxv (1975) 56 f. fig. 2). 2844. (F, B 5 stage 6B) (plate i 19) Pink clay; outside surface with an orange slip, decorated in lustrous red to deep purple-brown and black. Reserved band inside rim. Cf. FMP type 59, esp.

Perate ii 198 ff. 21. Stirrup jars 2845-2851 (fig. 273) A number of fragments of vases of this distinctive type were recognised, but they were evidently not common. The rarity of stirrup jars was noted as characteristic of the latest Mycenaean at Phylakopi in Melos, and also as a feature of the Myc. Ill C pottery of Lefkandi (BSA xvii (1910-11) 19; lxvi (1971) 334). In view of their comparative rarity it seems possible that the stirrup jars found at Emporio were imported. All the fragments of them except 2851 were from small vases, some of them evidently with elaborate painted decoration. The air-hole at the base of the spout 2847 is a late feature, and indicates that it comes from ajar of advanced Myc. Ill C date: only one example of such an air-hole was detected in the material from the Mycenaean spring deposit at Athens (Hesperia viii ( 1 939) 389) . But some of the other Emporio stirrup jars may have been earlier. The neat even stripes and flower design on 2848 for instance are more reminiscent of Myc. Ill B than of III C. 2845. (F, A Roman wall) (plate 126) False spout, rising in cone. Orange clay; surface smoothed. Decorated in lustrous dark red-brown to black: concentric circles on top of disc. The false spout rising in a cone is characteristic of Myc. Ill C, but already occurs in III B (FMP 85 f. fig. 23). Concentric circles are common on discs in Myc. Ill A-B (FMP 336 Mot. 41 no. 14), but are still found in III C, as on many examples from Perate (Perate ii 156 f. fig. 26: 3, 4). 2846. (F, D 1) (plate 126) Spout, possibly from same vase as 2845. 2847. (F, D ?5) (plate 126) Spout, with air-hole at base. Orange-buff clay, decorated in lustrous red to dark brown and black. 2848. (F, D 1) (plate 126) Shoulder with stump of handle. Orange clay; surface greenish buff, very well smoothed. Decorated with fine, well-drawn, horizontal stripes between wider bands. These and the flower above them (cf. FMP Mot. 18) suggest a date in Myc. Ill B rather than later. 2849. (F, B 2, stage 7) (plate 126) Fragments, apparently from body of small stirrup jar. Fabric as 2848, but decorated in red to red-brown. 2850.

Askos 2852 (fig. 273) Only one example of this distinctive type was recognised, but this was largely complete, and came from a comparatively safe context of the upper level (stage II) above the burnt destruction (stage I) in trench Q of Area D. 2852. (Z&gt;, Q2, stage II) (plate 125) Fragment, with double handle; mouth and tail missing. Probably baseless, as FMP type 1 94. Soft fabric; fine orange clay; outside surface with a whitish slip, and traces of linear decoration in lustrous red shading to dark brown and black. The design appears to have been a variety of zig-zag as FMP Mot. 61 no. 17: Myc. Ill C 1 late. Askoi like this are not common, but there are several from Attica (BSA xlii (1947) 52 f.), although only two were recovered in the Perate cemetery (Perate 1 392 pl. 1 15 no. 781, 412 pl. 122 no. 850; ii 250 f.) They are also found in Crete, and the decoration on our example is reminiscent of that on askoi from the Subminoan Spring-Chamber deposit at Knossos (PM ii 136 fig. 69: N) and from Karfi (BSA lv (i960) 27 fig. 20 pl. 1 1, b). 23. Large flask 2853-2854 (figs. 273, 274) Many fragments were recovered in Area D belonging to a large closed vase, apparently a flask, which may have been lentoid in shape (2853). This had at least one handle, and the rim 2854 might have belonged to it. Furumark gives lentoid flasks with rounded bases a range from Myc. Ill A 2 to the end of III C (FMP 67, 616 type 186), the few examples of large globular flasks</page><page sequence="200">fig. 274. Large flask of Mycenaean type 23. 608 HI.

FMP Mot. 32 no. 5) on two of the fragments is hard to parallel after Myc. Ill B; and, while the fragments of the vase were recovered over a wide area, many of them from surface levels, one at least was reported as being from a pre-stage I deposit in trench Q, of Area D.

Pithoi 2899-2906 (fig. 276) The bases of a number of pithoi were found sunk into the earth floors of stage 6 in Area F. These bases were normally small, between 14 and 16 in diameter, either ring bases (2899, 2900), or more commonly simple bases with a rib immediately above like 290 1 ; this type of base may have been made to sink into the floor as far as the rib. Handles seem to have been confined to the shoulder area. One pithos (2899) had alternate vertical and horizontal side handles on the shoulder, which was decorated with a pair of horizontal grooves like the jar rims 2880-3. But more usually these pithoi seem to have had two or three side handles on the shoulder, and to have been adorned with a series of horizontal channelled ribs - as a rule double, but often single, and once at least treble. There were normally finger-tip imprinted hollows at the base of the handles. Two restorable pithoi of this type (2900-1) were recovered and many fragments of others. A pithos from Phase H (L.M. I B-L.H. II) at Ayia Irini on Kea is vaguely comparable in shape and in the position of the three handles on the shoulder with pithoi of this standard type of stage 6 at Emporio (Hesperia xli (1972) 397 pl. 94, H 29). A pithos used for a burial at Thorikos (AE 1 895, 260 f. pl. 1 1 : 3) is similar in shape and has a small base encircled by a rib like 290 1 ; but the handles on the shoulder are vertical instead of horizontal. Pithos fabric was hard, the clay gritty, usually grey in the break and orange or reddish at the surface. One fragment had a thick yellow wash on the outside; another, traces of a thick white wash inside. The two rims (2904-5) are of different fabric from the norm; they come from the uppermost Mycenaean levels in Area F, but may be earlier strays. Some fragments from Area D including 2906 evidently belonged to a vase or vases corresponding in size to pithoi, but with painted decoration, like Palace Style jars of Late Minoan II- III at Knossos, or some large jars from Pylos destroyed at the end of Myc.

Pot stand 2907 (fig. 277) One fragment was assignable to a stand with window-like openings. Furumark cites a stand with windows (FMP type 336 b) from Rhodes, and suggests that the type may have been taken there in Myc. Ill C 1 from Crete, where such stands are attested earlier (FMP 70 f,). Our fragment, however, seems more likely to belong to a distinctive Trojan type found throughout Troy VI and in Troy VIIA [Troy iii 75 shape D 45, esp. 310 figs. 295 and 443 no. 22: Troy VI late; Troy iw 43 f.). 2907. (D, Q?2, stage ?II) (plate 127) Part of rectangular window-like opening preserved. Orange clay. 26. Ziúfr 2908-291 1 (fig. 277) Lids seem to have been rare, but three fragments were recognised from lids of FMP type 334, with a hole in the centre, apparently for a string loop. Lids of this type were in evidence in the late Myc. Ill B destruction level at Koukounaries on Paros (Davis and Cherry 160, 171 fig. 14). But they continue to be at home in Myc. Ill C. One from Athens is assigned by Furumark to Myc. Ill C 2 (Kerameikos i 20 pl. 21, Grave 33). The decoration on 2909 is comparable with that on a lid from Asine (Asine 414 no. 34 fig. 270: 14) assigned by Furumark to Myc. Ill C 1. One or two other scraps may come from lids of this type, or from squat jars with angular profiles (FMP form 19). 2908. (D, Q?2, stage ?II) (plate 127) Hard gritty reddish clay, greyish at core; outside surface with a lustrous black shading to purple-red wash, decorated with concentric rings in thin white paint. 2909. (F, A (B ?2/i), stages ?7/8) (plate 126) Orange clay; outside surface with a buff slip, well smoothed or burnished; decorated with concentric circles in lustrous red. 2910.

(F, D 1 ) (plate 1 26) Fine orange clay with some mica; outside surface with a buff slip, smoothed; decorated in red. Handles and lugs 2912 (fig. 277) A number of large vertical handles with painted decoration were recovered (plate i 29) . Most of these appear to have belonged to hydrias and amphoras (types 17 and 18). They were usually flattish oval or thin oval in section, occasionally circular, and once at least ridged (cf. FMP 91 fig. 24). Four fragments of twisted handles from mixed or unstratified deposits seemed to be Mycenaean; one of these had a hole through the base. Such holes commonly occurred at the tops and bottoms of other large vertical handles (e.g. 2838-9), and also at the ends of horizontal side</page><page sequence="206">fig. 278. Small Mycenaean bases. Scale 1/2. 614 III. EMPORIO handles. It seems unlikely that these holes were meant for string, since in one or two cases (e.g. 2839) the openings had become blocked with clay before the vase was fired. Probably they were made to help the firing where the handle joined the vase and the clay was exceptionally thick. Vertical handles might be decorated with straight or wavy bands, occasionally with crossing diagonals (fig. 272: a-e). One twisted handle with a hole through the base had a wavy band flanked by straight bands like fig. 272: e. Side handles were more or less circular in section. Both side handles and vertical handles often had finger tip impressions at the points where they joined the body of the vase. Lugs were evidently rare (cf. FMP 95); but one horizontally perforated lug (2912) that might be Mycenaean was recovered from a surface level in Area C.3. 2912. (Area C.j, trench JJ, surface) (plate 129) Sandy orange clay; outside surface with a buff slip; traces of decoration in lustrous dark brown; lug painted solid. Cf. Annuario v-vi (1923-24) 183 fig. 107, on a Mycenaean jar from Ialysos. Spouts Jugs of the Late bronze age type 15 had trefoil mouths, and some other contemporary jugs were evidently provided with cutaway spouts. One small open spout on a rim of cooking pot ware might have belonged to a tripod cooking pot (cf. PNestor i 413 fig. 395, shape 69 no. 275). Bases 2913-2946 (figs 278, 279) Vases of plain ware or cooking pot ware normally had more or less simple flat bases. Rounded bases seemed to come for the most part from jugs of the Late Bronze Age types 15 or 16, but one (2945) apparently belonged to an open vase. Most of the Mycenaean vases with painted decoration, however, had ring bases of one kind or another, including some which approximate to Furumark's disc, or torus, or torus-disc (FMP 91 fig. 24).</page><page sequence="207">fig. 279. Large Mycenaean bases. Scale 1/3. The bases 2913-2943 described below are from decorated vases, and are divided between (A) Small and (B) Large. Most of the small bases (2913-25) appear to be Mycenaean and to come from bowls of types 2 and 3. Many of the large ones (2926-35) on the other hand are evidently pre-Mycenaean, and most of them may come from jars, although some (2936-43) could be from bowls of types 5 and 6. (A) Small bases, all from bowls, mostly at any rate of types 2 and 3 One raised base (2913) came from a small decorated bowl; but the other small decorated bases were ring bases, mostly as 2914-5 in section. In a few cases (7 out of 40, or less than 1 in 5, in Area F) the space below the base was distinctly conical (e.g. 2923-4); and bases with a conical space like 2923-4 may have been characteristic of the latest Mycenaean occupation of the site. Small ring bases were often decorated on the inside with concentric circles (e.g. 2918-19, 2925), and once at least (2920) with a solid blob in the centre. When the whole of the inside of the vase was painted solid, a circle was usually left reserved in the centre (2916, 292 1 , 2924) . One or two bases had spirals inside like 2922. 29*3- (¿s D 0 2914.

Cooking pot ware 2947-2968 (fig. 280) This was clearly differentiated from other varieties of coarse ware, and was virtually confined to vases that might have been used in cooking, although a large trefoil mouth from trench F in Area F clearly belonged to a jug of type 15. The fabric of cooking pot ware is hard, the clay well fired, very gritty, and shades of grey, dark and light brown and red. Mica is sometimes visible in the clay. 27. Cooking jug 2947-2952 (fig. 280) This type of one-handled jug appears to have been the standard Mycenaean shape in cooking pot ware. Most such jugs were evidently made on the fast wheel, but some like 2948 were handmade. The handmade jugs usually had their surfaces smoothed or burnished by contrast with those made on the wheel. Rims were normally simple outward-curving or everted; handles were circular or oval in section, and sometimes had finger-impressed hollows at the point of junction with the body of the vase. Bases were usually differentiated, the wheelmade jugs like 2947 having ring bases, the coarse handmade versions raised or hollow bases. Some of the vases grouped under FMP type 65 correspond to jugs of this type, notably Asine 370 fig. 240 no. 65. Although the type occurs before Myc. Ill C according to Furumark, it appears to have no exact parallels in the array of Myc. Ill B domestic ware from Pylos. On the other hand such jugs occur in the Myc. Ill C settlement at Lefkandi {Lefkandi 18 fig. 3i.2?&amp;41xvi ( 197 1 ) 336 f. fig. 2 nos. 5, 6); and there are two from the Perate cemetery (Perate i 138 pl. 41 no. 1056; 208 pl. 62 no. 720; ii 227 f. fig. 91). A jug which appears to be handmade from a Mycenaean context at Iolkos in Thessaly is comparable, although rather elegant, with the handle rising above the rim (PAE 1 961, 51 f. fig. 3). A handmade jug from Kerameikos Submycenaean grave 10 is not altogether unlike 2948 (Kerameikos i pl. 25 no. 427). Rutter, Hesperia xlviii (1979) 371, 390 f., notes the presence of both wheelmade with smoothed surfaces and handmade burnished cooking pot ware in Myc.

Rims of cooking pot ware 2953-2963 (fig. 280) No other shape of vase in cooking pot ware from Late Bronze Age or Mycenaean levels could be wholly reconstituted apart from jugs of type 27. The large jar 2964 was nearly complete, but the base of it was missing. Rims of cooking pot ware were mostly simple, outward-curving or everted, like those of type 27; but some were squared (2957-9) or rolled as 2960, and a number were sharply differentiated on the inside (2961-3).

Sandy cooking pot type ware with some large grit; outside surface shades of red and brown to dusky, smoothed; inside black, as if a fire had been lit in the vase. Bases 2965 (fig. 280) Bases of cooking pot ware normally seem to have been differentiated in some way, like those of type 27 jugs. Some four or five high ring feet resembling 2938 and 2943 were of cooking pot ware; the majority of these came from wheelmade vases, but one or two seemed to be handmade. 2965. (D, Q7, pre-stage I) Hard gritty orange clay. Another similar base from the same pre-stage I deposit appears to be handmade; coarse gritty clay, grey-brown at core; surface reddish to dusky with poor burnish. Tripod feet 2966-2968 (fig. 280. plate 129) Tripod feet were not much in evidence, but some nine were recovered from Late Bronze Age or Mycenaean levels in Area D and four others from those in Area F. These late tripod feet at Emporio appear to have been wide, more or less oval in section, and straight (2968) or rounded (2966) at the bottom. Two of those from Area D were somewhat triangular in section (2967-8). All of these tripod feet may pre-date Myc. Ill C. Tripod cooking pots had apparently gone out of use at Lefkandi by Phase III of Myc. Ill C there, and no certain fragments of them were found in late Myc. Ill C deposits at Corinth (BSA lxvi ( 197 1 ) 344. Hesperia xlviii (1979) 370). 2966. (F, D 1 (B 2), stage 7) Gritty reddish cooking pot ware with a pale slip. 2967-8.

Decoration Paint A considerable amount of the Mycenaean pottery carried decoration in red, shades of brown, or black lustrous paint on a light ground. On the whole the motifs were characteristic of Myc. Ill C, but in a few cases (e.g. the kylix 2785 with whorl shell decoration) they seemed to reflect an earlier tradition. Wavy lines (FMP Mot. 53), often crudely drawn and irregular, were very much in evidence. They might be set vertically or horizontally, and appear either single (alone, or flanked by - or alternating with - straight lines) , or double, or even triple (e.g. plate i 29 (e) , right) . Horizontal</page><page sequence="212">fig. 281. Lamp (type 28) and Mycenaean decoration. Scale 1/2. wavy lines appear to have been especially common on deep bowls of types 3-6. In some instances wavy lines have been transformed into snakes in a way that seems peculiar to Myc. Ill C. The heads of the snakes round the inside of the type 7 bowl 2757 are formed by the imitation clay rivets; but wavy bands running down the vertical handles of amphoras and hydrias (types 18 and 17) can also be converted into snakes (e.g. 2838). Panelled patterns (FMP Mot. 75) were well represented. In some, if not in most cases, they formed the central triglyphs of antithetic spiral patterns (FMP Mot. 50) as seen on 2743. Tassel patterns (FMP Mot. 72) commonly hang from bands round the bases of the necks of hydrias and amphoras (types 17 and 18). Such tassel decoration is regularly found on vases of these types in Mycenaean III C (e.g. Lefkandi: BSA lxvi (1971) 333, 336). At Emporio the shoulders or swellings of hydrias and amphoras were often, it seems, decorated with bold double spirals (scrolls) or quirks (FMP Mots. 47 and 48) (e.g. plate 129 (e), left). Other characteristic Myc. Ill C motifs well represented at Emporio are joining semicircles (FMP Mot. 42), and isolated semicircles (FMP Mot. 43), which include several with solid centres (e.g. 2975-6). What seems to be a goat (FMP Mot. 6) is preserved on the bowl fragment 2745. The design on the inside of the type 7 bowl 2758 may include part of a fish or bird. It is curious that no remains of the Myc. Ill C octopus stirrup jars, developed in the Cyclades and abundantly represented at Perate (Perate ii 142 ff., 181 ff.), were recognised at Emporio; unless the fragment 2973 comes from one, but the design looks more like some kind of Mycenaean flower hybrid. A papyrus or lily derivative (FMP Mot. 18) is depicted on 2972, and 2848 may have the tip of some other variety of Mycenaean flower. Running spirals occur, and in one instance (2753) they appear to have been in two registers. A few Mycenaean vases seem to have been dark-surfaced with decoration in white (e.g. 2987-8). 2970. (F, A Roman level) (fig. 281. plate 121) Fragment of bowl.

One or two fragments which might have come from similar jars had wavy lines impressed in the clay while it was still wet (2989-90) . This type of incised decoration was very much at home at Troy in the horizon of Troy VI, VII A, and VII B (Troy iii 77; iv 21 f., 177). 2989. (D, O?2&gt; stage ?H) (plate 128) Fragment of large vase.

(F, B 2/1, stage 7 or 8) (plate 128) Fragment from shoulder of small closed vase. Soft greyish orange clay; decorated with thin grooved wavy line. 2991-2993. (F, unstratified) (plate 128) Fragments from closed vases, decorated with grooved lines. String-impressed ware (plate 128 (é), bottom row) Six fragments from Area F were unusual in having bold horizontal string impressions on the outside. These came from large thick-walled vases, which seemed to be wheelmade; their surfaces were shades of red and buffin colour. Rather similar string impressions occur on pottery classified as Knobbed Ware from Troy VII B, which might have overlapped in time with the Myc. Ill C occupation at Emporio (e.g. Troyiv 195, 234 fig. 282 nos. 10-12; 197 fig. 285 no. 8). But two of the fragments came from level 2 in trench F of Area F assignable to stage 6, and all six may belong to this pre-Mycenaean horizon as their fabric also suggests. Relief Horizontal ribs in relief were found on pithoi and large jars like 2906. The ribs decorating pithoi were characteristically sunk in the middle, and they were often combined in groups of two or even three. Two fragments had wide flat-topped ribs as 2994. Warts occurred on small vases of various kinds, but were extremely rare on true Mycenaean ware, where they were normally it seems conical in shape. The conical warts on the insides of bowls of type 7 (e.g. 2757, 2759) were evidently meant to imitate the rivets which fastened the handles of comparable metal vases. But there is a pair of conical warts on the fragment 2977 from a Mycenaean jug or jar decorated with a series of crude vertical wavy lines. Warts also occurred on vases of plain ware (2998-3000) which seem to be pre-Mycenaean, includingjars with incised decoration (e.g. 2998) comparable with that on Trojan vases from the horizon of Troy VI and VII. Similar warts were not uncommon on the pottery of Troy VI and continued to occur on that of Troy VII A and VII B (Troy iii 79; iv 46, 178 f.). Two fragments of plain ware (2996-7) had oblong warts; these are not easily matched in Troy VI or VII A, but comparable 'ovoid or elongated horizontal lugs' are frequent on the Coarse Ware of Troy VII B (cf. Troy iv 1 78 fig. 286 nos. 1-7), and they also appear on the related handmade ware from Myc. Ill C contexts on the Greek mainland (e.g. J.B. Rutter, 'Ceramic Evidence for Northern Intruders in Southern Greece at the beginning of the Late Helladic III C Period', AJA lxxix (1975) 17-32 esp. 21 ill. 8 pl. 2 fig. 9). The fabric of the Emporio fragments, however, does not seem to resemble Trojan Coarse Ware or its Greek relatives, and one of them (2997) was from an early and apparently pre-Mycenaean context. The same cannot be said of 2995 which appears to come from a handmade vase in fabric not unlike Trojan Coarse Ware. This fragment is unique at Emporio in being decorated with a row of finger-tip marks, comparable with those on the Coarse Ware of Troy VII B and the related wares from Myc. Ill C contexts on the Greek mainland. Perhaps the vase to which it belonged was an import, whether from the Trojan area, or from the north or west. 2994.

The spoons evidently varied in size, with bowls between 5.3 (1) and 2.6 (2) in width. The largest example (1) was unfortunately not from a stratified deposit. A spoon (3) of Period V had the handle in the same plane as the bowl, while in the case of (2) from a deposit of IX the handle was raised; but this difference may not have any chronological significance, to judge from Thermi, where both types were represented. At least two spoon handles were perforated at the end (e.g. 3) like some of those from Thermi. All these spoons from Emporio appear to have been irregular in shape and crudely made, of coarse fabric; the surfaces shades of grey-brown, light and dark brown, red-brown or reddish, normally with a poor burnish, but sometimes unburnished, especially it seems in the case of the earlier examples.</page><page sequence="216">624 III.

Many clay spoons resembling those from Emporio were recovered from so-called Neolithic levels in the Aspripetra cave on Cos (Aspripetra 287 fig. 73). Similar spoons occurred in all Early Bronze Age levels at Thermi, and three are illustrated from Samos ( Thermi 159 fig. 45. Sarrios i 51 pls. 23: 2, 17; 34: 7; 36: 1; 39: 41). But there only seems to be one from Poliochni (Poliochnii 589 pl. lxxxiii: q, Blue period). Such spoons are similarly not much in evidence, although attested, at Troy (SS nos. 8836-43). Schliemann assigned some to his Third, Burnt City, corresponding to the end of Troy II, but noted that they were 'very rare' (Ilios 410 nos. 474-5); he thought that they might have been used in metallurgy like the crucibles which he recovered (Ilios 408 f.). Rough clay spoons, or ladles as they are often called, had a wide distribution in early times. They are found in Iran (e.g. Hissar 184 pl. xliv: H 3026, Hissar III); in Mesopotamia in the Uruk and Jemdet Nasr horizons, in the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age of Palestine and Syria, and in Predynastic times in Egypt (Amiran, APHL 25 f. pl. 2:19. Teleilat Ghassul i 104 fig. 55 pl. 44. Megiddo ii pl. 255: 3, 4, Level XVlll.Judeideh 181 fig. 142: 44, Phase E. Childe, New Light 38 f. fig. 14) . A stone spoon of similar shape from Egypt is dated to Dynasty I (Emery, Archaic Egypt pl. 39 (a)). Some early Oriental clay spoons, like those common in Gawra VIII, are quite elegant in shape (Gawra i 44 pls. xxxi b, lxxv: 211). Anatolian clay spoons, apart from those already noted at Troy, include some from Hacilar II (AS viii (1958) 149 pl. 32, c. Hacilar 293 pl. cxxi: c, fig. 70 no. 8, Hacilar II B. Cf. ibid. 261 fig. 55: 19-21, from Hacilar VI, described as 'scoops' and more elaborate). There are examples from Late Chalcolithic deposits at Büyük Güllücek, Aphrodisias, and Beycesultan (Belleten xii (1948) 483 pl. 90 fig. 18: 8. AJA lxxv (1971) 129, 140, from 'Pekmez' level VII e at Aphrodisias. Beycesultan i 269 fig. F. 2: 14, level XXX). A fragmentary spoon from Beycesultan level VI is reminiscent of the long-handled spoons of the Early Helladic period in southern Greece, and those of the Cucuteni-Tripolye and related cultures in the Balkans (Beycesultan i 25 1 fig. P. 7 1 : 7) . A golden spoon with a long thin handle was recovered from Tomb L at Alaca (Alaca 1937-39 pl. cxcvii fig. 1). A clay spoon was apparently found in a Hittite level at Alishar (Alishar 1930-32 ii 2 73 fig- 3°6- c. 501). One was recovered from Mersin level XVI and another from an E.B. I context at Tarsus (Mersin 138 no. 1367, fig. 86. Tarsus ii 103 no. 136, pl. 243). Clay spoons are attested in the Cretan Neolithic (ÄS^xlviii (1953) 133 fig. 5^ 7,8;lix (1964) 220 fig. 57: 15-18, Knossos Neolithic Levels VII, VI, II). A number of clay spoons was found at Mochlos in a deposit assigned to Early Minoan I (Mochlos 93 fig. 48: 29, 30, 41, 42); but such spoons do not seem to be a feature of later phases of the Bronze Age in Crete. There are clay spoons from various Neolithic contexts on the Greek mainland. One comes from Prosymna (Prosymna 370 fig. 622: 1208); and fragments of what seem to have been rather elegant spoons (described as long-handled scoops or ladles) are reported from the Franchthi Cave (Hesperia xxxviii (1969) 365 f. pl. 97, b). Some clay spoons from Asea were classified as Neolithic (Asea 114 fig. in: 2-4). One or two were recovered from Choirospilia on Levkas (Dörpfeld, Alt-Ithaka 334 pl. 83: a). Ones from Elateia, the wells in the Athenian agora, and Kefala on Kea are assigned to the Late Neolithic (Elateia 199 pl. 66, c: 7. Athenian Agora xiii 1 3 no. 127. Kephala 9 no. 168). In Thessaly clay spoons occur as early as the Protosesklo and Presesklo</page><page sequence="217">fig. 283. Clay objects (CLAY 1-7, 9). Scale 1/2. 4. CLAY (SPOONS) 625 * ' I d /■ X.

At the same time they are attested, although rare, from mature Dhimini (L.N.) contexts in Thessaly, and from Early Bronze Age ones there and in Macedonia [Ayia Sofia Maguía 1 1 pl. 18: 1, 8. DS 347 f. fig. 285. PMac 184 no. 259, from Saratse). Clay spoons in dark grey-brown burnished ware which sound like ones from Emporio are reported from Eutresis Group V (end of Early Helladic I or beginning of E.H. II) [Hesperia xxix (i960) 146). But in general clay spoons from Early Helladic contexts in southern Greece tend to be more elegant, often with long shapely handles (e.g. Asine 224. fig. 164: 3,4. Hesperia xxiv (1955) 45 pl. 23, c (Lerna: E.H. II) . ^jgouries 107 f. fig. 94. PAE 1953, 1 15 fig. 1 1 (Rafina: end of E.H.)).

EMPORIO Plain clay spoons like ones from Emporio appear to have been at home in the early Neolithic Körös (Starcevo) Culture of Hungary, and in the later Mound Culture (Gumelnij;a horizon) in Bulgaria (Kutzian, Kords- Kultur a pls. i: 7, xlvii: 13-16. Gaul, Neolithic Bulgaria 98, 133, 165, 178 pl. xxxvi: 3-5). They are also found in the Boian-Gumelnij;a horizon of Romania (Childe, Dawn 96 f. Berciu, Contributii figs. 85: 19, 121:5, Salçuta I and IV: the latter has a hole through the top of the handle). Clay spoons occur in the Cucuteni-Tripolye Culture further east (e.g. Materiale Arheologicei (1953) 270 fig. 45: 1, 2, from Poieneçti); but the most characteristic Cucuteni-Tripo- lye spoons have painted decoration, and are elegant in shape with long handles, like Early Helladic ones in southern Greece (e.g. Häbäsejti pls. cvi-cviii. Izvoare 195 ff. figs. 199-206). Plain clay ladles were still current during later periods in the Balkans and in Europe further north (e.g. Homolka 80, 323, 422 pls. xl: 9; lv: 17, 22; lviii: 4, 13. Gimbutas, Prehistory 159 fig. 94: 3, 4); they occur in the Bronze Age in Romania (D. Popescu, Die Frühe und Mittlere Bronzezeit in Siebenbürgen (Bucharest, 1944) 57 fig. 16: 2. Mat. si Cercetari ii (1956) 59 fig. 19: 9, 122 fig. 75: 1-4). Clay spoons are also widely distributed in the western parts of Europe. They appear in early levels in Liguria, and on Western Neolithic sites, as well as in the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age of the British Isles {Arene Candide i 141, 234 fig. 62, pls. xv: 2 D, E; i: i (Levels 28, 26, 14, 12). Cf. ibid. pl. xlix: 3, from lower levels at Pollera. Piggott, Neolithic Cultures 75, 144. Déchelette i 554 fig. 202 nos. 1-5: the handle of no. 1 has a hole through the top. Préhistoire française ii 258 fig. 2:15, 16. Ilios 410). Seals 5-7 (fig. 283. plate 130) One stamp seal (6) and part of what may have been another (5) were recovered from levels of V and II. The seal 6 of Period II belongs to a well-known type with a wide distribution. The fragment 5 is less easy to parallel. The lump 7 from a level of VIII may be part of a sealing. 5. (A, H ?5O, Period V) (plate 130) Broken. L. preserved 4. Pinkish red clay. This seems to be a fragment of a seal. The holes might suggest that it was a brush handle like those from Troy II-IV, but these are normally of unbaked clay, and the surfaces with holes for the bristles are regular in shape (e.g. Troy i 219, 283 f. fig. 369). Elongated clay seals are found in the Neolithic of Macedonia (e.g. Nea Nikomedeia: ILN 1 1 April 1964, 607 fig. 20. AA 1 97 1, 376 fig. 65. Servia: PMac 165 fig. 35: r, s, pl. x: r, s: s has serrated edges somewhat reminiscent of 5). A clay stamp of comparable shape from Gremnos in Thessaly is assigned to Protosesklo (AA 1956, 146 fig. 4). Cf. An irregularly shaped clay seal from Sesklo (CMS i no. 4) , and some early Cretan ivory seals such as CMS ii. 1 no. 290 from Plátanos. Other Cretan ivory seals have a handle to one side like 5 (e.g. CMS ii. 1 nos. 3 1 7-20 from Plátanos tholos B, and 424 from the early palace at Phaistos). For the design on 5 cf. CMS i no. 1 (Zervos, Nais i pls. 296-7), a clay stamp seal from Sesklo, and some early Cretan seals like CMS ii. 1 no. 496 and no. 335 from Plátanos tholos B. The same type of design also occurs on some early Near Eastern seals (e.g. Gawra ii 182 pl. clxii: 74, 75 (Levels XII, IX) . Judeideh 130 fig. 101: 6 (First Mixed Range), 387 fig. 297: 1 (Phase H)). 6. (F, B 13/12, stage iAor2, Periods IV (?) or II: early phase (?)) (plate 130) Handle broken. Diam. of face 3.5. Ht. preserved 3. Brown clay; surface reddish brown. Face boldly incised with opposing groups of chevrons. The design appears to be a devolved version of the filled cross, which is found on stamp seals in early Elam, and on ones of the Ubaid horizon and later in Mesopotamia; it also occurs on seals in Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, Greece, Crete, and the Balkans. A clay stamp seal of similar shape to 6 and with a very comparable degenerate version of the filled cross motif comes from a level of Lerna IV (Early Helladic III) (Hesperia xxxviii (1969) 509 no. 197 pl. 130).

CLAY (FIGURINES) 627 392 no. 7 (Early Bronze II) for the design in a neat early form on a stone seal. Cf. the impression on a vase fragment, Mersin fig. 54: 1 1, probably from Level XVI. The design is extremely common on stamp seals in Anatolia, and continued late there, if the evidence from Alishar is to be trusted (e.g. Alishar 1927 ii 44 fig. 35: 3094; ig28-2g ii 64 fig. 87: a 184; 1930-32 i 81 f. fig. 87; 1930-32 iii 91 fig. 90, 347 fig. 272). But only evolved and derivative forms of the filled cross seem to be attested on seal impressions from Karahöyük, contemporary with the Assyrian trading colonies in the early part of the 2nd millennium (S. Alp. Cylinder- und Stempelsiegel aus Karahöyük bei Konya (Ankara, 1968) 208 f. nos 169-75). Many Anatolian stamp seals with this design are made of clay (e.g. Archaeologia lxxxvi (1936) 30 fig. 12: 19 (Kusura B), but the face of this is rectangular; others from Karatas-Semayiik: A J^41xix (1965) 250 pls. 64 fig. 33, 65 fig. 37;lxx (1966) 249; lxxi (1967) 264 pl. 84 figs. 54-6, 59, Early Bronze II, which seems to overlap with Troy I). A vase from Troy has a row of circular impressions that appear to show a design of this type (Ilios 412 nos. 482-3, from Schliemann's Third or Burnt City, which should correspond to the end of Troy II) . Closely similar to our seal are a clay one from Poliochni assigned to the Blue period (Poliochni i 232, 587, 653 f. pl. clxviii no. 9), and another from Sesklo (CMS i no. 3. Zervos, Mais i pls. 296-7). An elegant version of the design was impressed on a jar handle of E.H. II date found at Lerna (Hesperia xxv (1956) 169 pl. 44, d. Cf. ibid, xxxviii (1969) 508 no. 192 pl. 1 29). A cruder version adorns the rim of a contemporary hearth at Ayia Irini on Kea (Hesperia xxxiii (1964) 319 pl. 48, k). The design also appears on the bottom of the stone cylinder seal from Amorgos assigned to E.C. II (B. Buchanan, Catalogue of Ancient Mear Eastern Seals in the Ashmolean Museum i Cylinder Seals (Oxford, 1 966) 1 35 no. 741 . C. Renfrew, AJA lxxi (1967) 7, 18 pl. 4 no. 19). A conical seal with this design was recovered from a very late Mycenaean deposit on Naxos, but may have been out of context (PAE 1951, 217. Desborough, LMS 150). The design is found on early seals in Crete (e.g. CMS ii. 1 nos. 96, 435, 463. BSA xxxvi (1935-36) 96 f. fig. 21: 5, 7). Many derivative versions of it were eventually current on Cretan as they were on Anatolian seals. The filled cross does not appear to be as common as the spiral on clay stamps in the Balkans; but it is attested in Romania in Cucuteni B (Childe, Dawn 1 42) , and one stamp with this design has been dated to the end of the Early Neolithic (Berciu, Contributii 31 fig. 3: 2, from Verbi fa, assigned to Milojcic's Period III of Starcevo-Cris). 7. (A, Q 145, Period VIII) Coarse clay, grey-black at core, light brown at edges; inside surface light brown, and rough, with the impression of a very thick cord in it; outside rough, with remains of a dark brown to black wash and possible traces of crimson red paint over this. Possibly part of a clay sealing applied to the lid of a jar or box. Alternatively a lug, probably from a dish akin to type 3. What seem to be clay sealings with string impressions are recorded from the Protosesklo (E.N. II) horizon in Thessaly (Otzaki-magula 60 pl. x: 30, 3 1 ), and from the perhaps contemporary 'shrine' at Nea Nikomedeia (ILM 18 April 1964, 606 fig. 12). Compare the clay jar stopper from Mersin level XXI (Mersin 76 fig. 51). Crucibles 8-9 (figs. 283, 284. plate 130) Two fragments, both from levels of Period II, may have belonged to crucibles. For crucibles from Troy, see SS 268 f. nos. 681 7-51 . Ilios 408 f. nos. 469-70, from Schliemann's Third (Burnt) City, which should correspond to the end of Troy II. Schliemann records evidence for the use of no. 469 for 'some operation connected with the metallurgy of gold.' 8. (B, C/D9, stage 7, Period II: early phase) (fig. 284. plate 130) Broken at one end. L. preserved 16. W. 12. Th. 7. Flat on one side, with a shallow basin on the other; bold channels down the edges, ending just short of a wide perforation. Coarse clay, grey-brown at core; surface red shading to light and dark brown and dusky, with poor burnish. A fragment from Korucutepe, like this in shape but without the perforation on top, is described as an andiron (Korucutepe ii pl. 1 36: A, E.B. II- III) . But a rather similar fragment from Thermi appeared to be a crucible; it had remains of slag in it ( Thermi 157 fig. 44: 31.72. Branigan, Aegean Metalwork 203, C 7) . The perforation through the end might be for help in binding the crucible to a cleft stick which fitted into the channels along the edges. 9. (A, Q14, Period II) (fig. 283. plate 130) Fragment, perhaps from a crucible like 8. L. preserved 7. Grey-brown clay; surface burnished. Figurines 10-21 (fig. 285. plates 130, 131, 132) Very few clay figurines were recovered. Six little strips of clay ( 1 1 - 1 4) moulded into irregular shapes may have been meant for female</page><page sequence="220">fig. 284. Clay objects (CLAY 8, 27). Scale 1/4. 628 HI. EMPORIO figurines, but are more likely perhaps to have been calculi, as noted below. All except one came from levels of Period VII, but only two (12, 13) appeared to be complete. Three of the fragmentary examples had possible traces of a white slip (e.g. 11). Some clay rods of unknown purpose from Saliagos look comparable, although more regular in shape with smoother surfaces {Saliagos 79 fig. 84 pl. 1). Similar objects from the Stratum XIII well at Tepe Gawra were interpreted as perhaps votive offerings rather than sling pellets (Gawra ii 1 73 f. pl. lxxxvi: b). Another rather similar object (5.3 long) was found next to a cluster of clay sling bullets on a Period 1 (Early Neolithic) floor level at Elateia (Elateia 202 pl. 68, c: 2) . A series of flat clay bars of about the same size as 1 1- 14 was recovered from Hacilar VI (Hacilar ii pl. clix: e, fig. 234). Some irregular clay objects from Alishar assigned to the Chalcolithic are also comparable (Alishar 1930-32 i fig. 101: c 1707-8, c 1587, c 271). Some or all of these objects, including the strips from Emporio, may be examples of the 'calculi' of various shapes which appear to have had a wide distribution in Mesopotamia and elsewhere in the Near East including Anatolia from very early times until the 4th millennium B.C. and later (Denise Schmandt-Besserat, AS xxvii (1977) 139 ff., 150). A particularly interesting group of roughly made cylinders of clay, usually 2-3 long and 1-2 wide, together with fragments of others and clay cones and balls, has been recovered at the early site of Suberde in south-west Turkey (J. Bordaz, TAD xvii no. 2 (1968) 43 ff., 51). This suggests the possibility that the clay ball 23 assigned to Period VIII may be another example of such an object. The art of writing appears to have developed as an extension of the use of such 'calculi' (P. Amiet, Glyptique Susienne (Paris, 1972) i 69 f., and Archeologia 1966 No. 12, 20 ff. Cf. Denise Schmandt-Besserat, AJA lxxxiii (1979) 19-48, and Syro-Mesopotamian Studies i. 2 (Malibu, 1977). I am grateful to Professor Maurice Pope for these references). The fragment 10 of Period IX with pattern burnish on one side may be part of a vase handle. But 1 5 belongs to a class of schematic female figurines which occur in stone as well as clay at Troy and elsewhere in the Aegean area in Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age contexts. The female figurine 16 with breasts and upraised arms was virtually unstratified. It is reminiscent of Mycenaean figurines of the Psi type, and is probably to be assigned to Myc. Ill C; although the fabric might suggest an Early or Middle Bronze Age date, and comparable figurines occurred in Thermi III-IV. The base 18 is certainly from a Mycenaean female figurine. The only animal from a pre-Mycenaean context was the fine ox protome 1 7 which appears to have been the handle of a vase. Two Mycenaean bovine figurines (19, 20) were recovered, together with the horn of a third. The dappling on the body of 19 is unusual. Some fragments of wheelmade figures from the area</page><page sequence="221">4. CLAY (FIGURINES) 629 of the Greek sanctuary (2 1 A-D) have been claimed as Myc.

Orange-buffclay. Decorated in dark brown to black with vertical wavy stripes. The stripes stop at a horizontal band, instead of continuing to the bottom of the skirt as appears to be the normal rule (see E. French, 'The Development of Mycenaean Terracotta Figurines', BSA lxvi ( 197 1 ) 101 ff. passim). This may be a late feature for which parallels can be found on some Psi figurines from the Greek mainland assignable to Myc. Ill C or the end of III B (e.g. French, op. cit. 139 f. pl. 22 (c-d) 30, from Amyklai) . At Prosymna at any rate wavy stripes appear to have been commoner on the skirts of Psi type figurines than on those of Phi type ones where they were usually straight (Prosymna 357, 359). 1 9. (F, D ?2, Mycenaean) (plate i 32) Figurine of bovine. One leg, one horn and tail missing. L. 8.5. Fine pinkish buff clay; surface smoothed, and decorated in lustrous orange-red: body dappled with irregular dots above bands. The dappling of the body in this manner is unusual (cf. E. French, BSA lxvi (1971) 159). 20. (plate 132) Figurine of bovine, found with 19. Horns and part of one leg missing. L. 7.5. Fine buff clay; decorated in lustrous dark brown: band down top of back, and body with vertical stripes forming a ladder pattern (cf. E. French, BSA lxvi ( 197 1 ) 157 ff.). Similar zebra-like stripes were the regular system of decoration on animal figurines of the latest type (c) at Prosymna; but these had upturned tails. The hanging tails of 19 and 20 are more characteristic of animals of the earlier Prosymna type (b) , which were normally decorated with horizontal stripes, and in only one instance with vertical ones like 20 (Prosymna 362 f., figs. 457 no. 132 (type (b)), 491 and 615 (type (c))). 21 A-D. Wheelmade figures from area of Greek sanctuary (Greek Emporio 188 f., 195 f., nos. 48, 25-28, pls. 73-4). These fragments of wheelmade figures of a female votary and horses were assigned to the I3th-i2th centuries by R.V. Nicholls, 'Greek Votive Statuettes and Religious Continuity c. 1200-700 B.C.', in Auckland Classical Essays Presented to E.M. Blaiklock (Auckland, 1970) 7, 14 f. If this dating is correct it would strongly suggest the previous existence of a Mycenaean sanctuary on the site of the later Greek one by the harbour. But there does not appear to be any other evidence for Mycenaean occupation in this area, and the best preserved horse (Greek Emporio 188 f., 195 no. 26) was evidently standing on top of a lid in a Geometric manner. The 8th-century date for the figures proposed by J. Boardman in Greek Emporio therefore seems preferable. Miscellaneous 22-25 (FIG- 2^5- plate 131) 22. (A, Q?i45, Period ?VIII) Knob.

Some of the decorated clay balls from Bogazköy assigned to the end of the Early Bronze Age were evidently rattles with little stones inside (W.

Clay dark grey at core, buff at surface, with much mica, suggestive of an import. This seems to belong to a class of objects, small enough to hold in the hand, and characteristically semi-circular in section, with a groove down the length of the flat side. Most are made of stone, but a few are of clay like 24. Those of stone at any rate appear to have been used in pairs for shaping sticks and in particular the shafts of arrows which were drawn up and down between them (A.M. Tallgren, ESA ii (1926) 1 18, 57 fig. 40: 3-6). Stone arrow-shaft straighteners of this kind have been found across Europe from South Russia to the British Isles. Buchholz has listed examples from the Greek mainland, where they seem to be first attested in E.H. Ill ( JdIXxxw'û (1962) 4 ff. fig. 1). If, as he suggests, they were developed in South Russia, they could have been introduced into Greece from the North during that period. Buchholz stresses that none have been found in the eastern Aegean, but there is one from the Aspripetra cave on Cos (Aspripetra 284, 277 fig. 62, D). It is said to come from the Neolithic levels, but some of the pottery published looks Bronze Age. Two from Troy ( Tul 378 fig. 340, 388 fig. 368. SS no. 8683) are noted by Buchholz, who argues that they must date from after the period of Troy II. Grooved stones which may have been employed for a comparable purpose are reported from Çatal Hüyük and Hacilar, but these do not conform in shape (Hacilar i 158; ii 170 pl. cxvi and 455 fig. 173: 3). The few clay objects of this shape like 24, although indistinguishable in appearance from stone arrow-shaft straighteners, may have had a different function, serving as moulds for bronze pins or wire, as suggested for Thermi 159 fig. 44: 30.20, from Thermi I. Cf. Buchholz, Jdlixxv'û (1962) 5 note 23. A clay object of this kind of grey burnished ware ('Proto-Minyan') from Corinth is assigned by Walker Kosmopoulos, Corinth 46 pl. iii: f, to her Period II (Middle Neolithic). 25. (D, Q,2, stage II) (plate 131) Mycenaean spool. Solid, unperforated. L. 6. 1 . Max. diam. 4.3. Coarse clay, shades of light and dark brown to reddish, with rough unburnished surface. Solid clay spools were in use in the Neolithic and at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age on the Greek mainland (e.g. Otzaki-magula i 26 f., 31, 36, 40; ii pls. x: 25-27, xvi: 20, xix: 22, xxiv: 8, 9). But rather elegant perforated clay spools resembling modern cotton reels were more characteristic of later phases of the Bronze Age there and at Troy. Clumsy unperforated clay spools, however, like 25 appear to be at home in the latest Mycenaean of the Aegean area, and have analogies in Europe to the north (e.g. Gimbutas, Prehistory 132 fig. 73, c). 'Many enigmatic unbaked clay spools' of this kind are reported from the earliest Phase I of Myc. Ill C occupation at Lefkandi (Leflcandi 1 3 fig. 1 6) . A spool from Troy VII b is closely similar to 25 ( Troy iv 1 5 1 f. fig. 256: 37.172). Spools of this kind are also found in the Late Bronze Age in Macedonia [PMac 101, 231 fig. 104: v, w, from Boubousti). Unperforated clay spools continued in use in Greece into later times (e.g. H. Payne, Perachora i (Oxford, 1940) 248 pl. 1 1 1 no. 268. Cf. BCHxxx (1906) 37 fig. 61, from Argos. A.

EMPORIO Loomweights 26-29 (figs. 284, 285. plate 132) Objects of clay that might have been used as loomweights were curiously rare in all periods at Emporio. Four types were represented, all by single examples, except in the case of type (B). These were: (A) Subrectangular (?) with at least two vertical perforations; (B) Large oval with thick cross-section, and single perforation at the top running parallel to the longer horizontal axis; (C) Oval, small in size than (B), with thin cross-section, and single perforation at the top through the shorter horizontal axis; (D) Circular, with groove for a stick along the top, and large horizontal perforation. The loomweights of type (B) were all found close together in House IV of Area A destroyed by fire at the end of Period IV. The solitary fragment of type (A) came from a context of Period VI in Area A, the example of type (C) from one of Period II there. The type (D) loomweight was from a dominantly Mycenaean level in Area F. (A) Subrectangular (?) with at least two vertical perforations The completed shape of the fragment 26 is uncertain, and the object may not have been a loomweight at all. But rectangular loomweights, normally with four perforations, are found in Crete from Neolithic times onwards (BSA lix (1964) 235 (Knossos: Neolithic); lx (1965) 305 nos. 37-40 (Palaikastro: Middle Minoan), cf. BSA xl (1939-40) 47 f. fig. 32. Études Cretoises iv (1936) 37 pl. xviii: k (Mallia)). One from Boubousti in Macedonia is assignable to the local Late Bronze Age (PMac 10 1, 231 fig. 104, x); and they are common in Portugal. Cylindrical loomweights with two vertical perforations are reported from Early Helladic and later contexts on the Greek mainland (Asine 25 1 . Korakou 1 04 fig. 1 29 nos. 4, 5. ^ygouries 191. Eutresis 1 93 (Middle Helladic) ) . 26. (A, G 93, Period VI) (plate 132) Fragment. L. 7.2. Gritty light brown clay; surface grey with traces of burnish. ( B) Large oval with thick cross-section, and single perforation at the top running parallel to the longer horizontal axis The few loomweights of this type were all found in trench H of Area A at the north end of House IV destroyed by fire in Period IV. They were in and around the storage bin (fig. 62) in the corner of the house; one was recovered from inside the smashed jar 1 184 which was in the bin. It is difficult to see how the corner with the storage bin could have been occupied by a loom like the one of which traces were noted at Troy (Troy i 350 f. figs. 333-4, 461: late Troy II). Possibly the weights were resting on a wooden lid covering the bin, or on a shelf or sleeping platform above it. Fragments of six loomweights, or of seven at the most, were noted. All were large, measuring between 13 and 14 in length, and made of coarse gritty clay. They were very fragile, perhaps because the clay was unbaked, and only hardened to some degree by the fire which destroyed the house. Similar loomweights from Troy appear to have been made of unbaked clay (Troy i 338 fig. 369). These are described as being of flattened pear shape, wider at the top, and with the perforation running parallel to the longer horizontal axis as in our type (B) loomweights. It was observed that the type seemed to be peculiar to Troy, no parallels from other sites having been noted. Such loomweights were attested in the Early Subperiod of Troy I, became very common in Troy II, and remained the prevailing type in Troy III; they were less in evidence in Troy IV, when a type akin to our type (C) began to be more common; but the only loomweight from Troy V is of this type (Troy ii 15, 74, 115 f., 169, 233, 261 figs. 53, 55, 150: 37.87 (Troy IV), 236: 37.135). The examples from Troy III-V seem to be somewhat sharp-edged with a subrectangular rather than rounded oval cross-section (cf. Ilios 559 f. no. 1203).</page><page sequence="225">4. CLAY (LOOMWEIGHTS) 633 27. (A, R against wall of house in bin in 26, Period IV) (plate 132) Complete. L. 13. Coarse gritty orange-brown clay. (C) Oval, with thin cross-section, and single perforation at the top through the shorter horizontal axis The only example of this type from Emporio comes from a level of Period II. At Troy such loomweights occurred alongside ones of type (B) in Troy I- II and IV {Troy i 338, 104 fig. 221: 35.458; ii 169 f., 172 fig. 150. Cf. Thermi 163 fig. 43: 31.31, the most common type there, but circular instead of oval). Similar loomweights are found in Anatolia at the beginning of the Bronze Age and earlier, and they continue into Middle and Late Helladic times on the Greek mainland (Troy ii 1 16 with references). The loomweights from the Late Neolithic (Gumelnija) levels at Dikilitash in eastern Macedonia appear to be of this type (BCH xcii (1968) 1072, 1068 fig. 5). But in the Balkans this type of loomweight is already found in the Körös (Starcevo) horizon of Early Neolithic (Kutzian, K'òfòs- Kultur a pl. vii: 16, 17). 28. (F, B io, stage 3, Period II) (plate 132) L. 7.2. Light yellowish brown clay; surface rough. (D) Circular, with groove for a stick along the top, and large horizontal perforation The only loomweight of this type came from on or immediately below the lowest Late Bronze Age floor in trench B of Area F. No other clay loomweights were recovered from Late Bronze Age or Mycenaean levels at Emporio apart from this. Two similar loomweights from the Harbour Sanctuary were assigned by Boardman to the early Iron Age [Greek Emporio 234 f. fig. 156: 515, 516). If they are of this date and not Late Bronze Age strays they would appear to reflect the survival in Chios of this distinctive Bronze Age type making it ancestral to the disc weight common later. Loomweights of similar type are characteristic of Late Troy VI ( Troy iii 9, 31. Cf. SS 295 no. 8147. Tul 399 fig. 391). The type was probably derived from Crete, where it was standard from Early Minoan times onwards (e.g. Myrtos 212, 220 f., 243 fig. 96, assigned to E.M. II. BSA xxx (1928-30) 73 pl. xiitf: 27 (PMiw 71 fig. 51: 27),fromaM.M. I A house below the West Court at Knossos). The loomweights from the Loomweight Basement assigned by Evans to the end of Middle Minoan II were evidently of this type (PM'' 253); but at Knossos at any rate it appears to have been superseded by a globular type towards the close of the Middle Minoan period. At other Cretan sites, however, such as Palaikastro, the earlier flat type of loomweight persisted in use until the end of Late Minoan I if not into Late Minoan III times (BSA lx (1965) 304 fig. 19 nos. 27-36. Cf. BSA xl (1939-40) 47 f. fig. 34). Other examples, some of which may date from L.M. I, are published from Gournia (Gournia 32 pl. iii: C 9, 10), Mallia (Études Cretoises iv (1936) 37 pl. xviii: g-j), andTylissos (Etudes Cretoises ii (1934) 105 pl. xxx: 1 , which shows how they were attached to a stick, but this should be horizontal at the bottom of the warp, whose threads were tied to it). Outside Crete loomweights of this type were still current in some areas in the Late Bronze Age. Such loomweights were evidently in general use at Kastri on Kythera in Middle Minoan III B-Late Minoan I, and at Akrotiri on Thera at the time of the abandonment of the settlement therein Late Minoean I A before the eruption (Kythera 206 f., 217 f. pls. 59: 1 1-16; 60: 17, 156 a, b, 374 c. Thera i 21 f. fig. 22; ii 47 pl. 39). There are also loomweights of this type from Cos (Cos 279 fig. 240). 29. (F, B ?7, stage ?6A) (plate 132) Complete. Diam. 7.5. Light orange-brown clay. Anchor ornaments (?) The fragments of pottery 1709, 1710, from levels of Period II, with a single perforation made</page><page sequence="226">634 III. EMPORIO before firing, might belong to 'anchor ornaments' on the analogy of Poliochni i 657 pl. clxvii: 3-5. But no other bits attributable to these were recognised at Emporio. Sherds used as rubbers A certain number of sherds from vases had worn edges and appeared to have been used as rubbers like AG 4 and 78 from the earlier horizon of material at Ayio Gala (cf. Kephala 9). Some worn sherds, however, had evidently been brought along with pebbles from the beaches or stream beds in the area. This was the case with the many worn sherds recovered from the pebble-filled channels under the floor of the presumed granary of stage 6 in Area B. Discs cut from sherds 30-41 (plate 132) There were two varieties of these: (A) Unperforated, (B) Perforated with a single hole through the centre. Out of more than seventy such discs noted, some twenty were as (A) unperforated, the rest, more than fifty in number, had a hole through the centre as (B) . The unperforated discs were mostly between 4-5 in diameter, with an outside range of between 2.2 and 7.5. Those with a hole through the centre varied more in diameter, most falling between c. 2.5-7.5, but one small example being only 1.8 across, and four having diameters of as much as 8, 10, and 1 1. Two unperforated discs were recovered from levels of Period IX, and others were assignable to VII/VI, VI/V, and IV; but only one was recognised from a deposit of II. In contrast to this, discs with a hole through them were most abundantly represented in Period II, and, while relatively common in levels of VI-IV, were not attested before VII. Both unperforated discs and those with holes through them were cut from vases of all fabrics, including comparatively thin-walled vessels of fine ware and thick-walled jars of coarse ware. Sherds with incised decoration, however, seem to have been avoided, doubtless because the incisions might produce lines of weakness along which the sherd would break when cut or bored. The discs were sometimes true circles with neatly trimmed edges; but the shapes were often irregular and the edges jagged and uneven. In the case of at least two of the unperforated discs the edges had been worn by rubbing. These discs may have been sherds of circular shape used as rubbers; but four or five of the discs with holes also had their edges rubbed smooth. The considerable range in the size of the discs, especially of the more numerous class (B) with holes, suggests that they were prepared for a variety of uses. Some of the unperforated ones, for instance, may have been employed as counters, some of those with holes as spindle whorls. The larger discs of both classes (A) and (B) might have served as stoppers or vase lids. Discs cut from sherds, with or without holes, have a wide distribution in time and place. Discs with and without holes were recovered from Saliagos (Saliagos 70 figs. 84, 85). On the Greek mainland perforated discs are assignable to all periods of the Bronze Age and earlier ( Troy i 49 f. with references). Perforated discs cut from black burnished ware were recovered from Late Neolithic contexts at Corinth (Hesperia xlviii (1978) 426). Many sherd discs are reported from the Early Neolithic at Servia in western Macedonia (Servia 1 95) . Discs without holes occur in the Protosesklo and Presesklo horizons of the Early Neolithic in Thessaly (Otzaki-magula i 59). They were also noted from the earliest level (Phase I A 1 ) at Kum Tepe in the Troad (Kum Tepe 323) . The range of perforated discs (class B) at Troy is interesting. They occurred in the Early and Middle Subperiods of Troy I (Troy i 49 f., 96, 105, 114, 143 figs. 221, 237, 242). Schliemann reports large numbers from Cities I-V (Ilios 231, 422); but none is illustrated or recorded by the American excavators from Troy II- III, although there are several from Troy I V-V ( Troy ii 1 50,</page><page sequence="227">4. WHORLS 635 171, 188 fig. 151; 269, 281, 285 fig. 236), and some from Early VI [Troy iii 125, 173 fig. 352 no. 15). (A) Unperforated discs 30. {A, Q 156, Period IX) (plate 132) Diam. c. 5.

(2) Whorls WHORL 1-56 (figs. 286-9. plate 133) The majority of these were made of clay, but thirteen out of a total of one hundred and fifty-one were of stone. Most had diameters ranging between 2.5 and 5, but a few were less than 2.5 and one or two more than 5 in diameter. In several instances the hole through the centre tapered, as if made by or designed to fit a tapered stick; and most of these objects, whether of stone or clay, were no doubt employed as spindle whorls. A copper spindle with clay whorl in position has been found at Karata^ Semayük in Lycia (AJAlxxiii (1969) pl. 74 fig. 23. Cf. Pétrie, Tools and Weapons 53 pl. lxvi. Kish i pl. xviii: 2). But some of the smaller, notably the stone whorls of type 1, may have been used as beads. Whorls of any kind were very rare at Emporio before Period IV. One of stone (11) came from a level of IX, but the earliest clay whorls from stratified contexts were one (6) from VIII, and another (41) from VI. A similar situation has been noted elsewhere in Greece according to Jacobsen, who reports that in the Franchthi Cave clay spindle whorls are first attested in the Middle Neolithic, but are rare before the later stages of the Late Neolithic and the Final Neolithic which succeeds it {Hesperia xlii (1973) 276 f.). Clay whorls were similarly rare in the Late Chalcolithic (pre-Troy I) levels at Beycesultan {Beycesultan i 277). This does not necessarily mean that spinning was little practised, since spindle whorls could have been made of some perishable material like wood. Wooden spindle whorls in shape like our type 4 are in use in Chios today. Some of the clay whorls from Emporio were of fine, others of coarse fabric. Most of them had burnished surfaces, except in the case of those assignable to the Mycenaean period, when surfaces were normally it seems unburnished. Incised or punctuated decoration occurred on sixteen whorls, nearly 10 per cent of the total recovered. One of these was the Mycenaean stone whorl 53 of type 20. Apart from this and one clay whorl (47) of type 15, decoration was confined to clay whorls of the common types 9 and 10;</page><page sequence="228">fig. 286. Whorls. 636 III.

In several instances traces of white fill were preserved in the decoration. Two decorated whorls were recovered from levels of Periods V and IV; but decoration appeared to flourish most in Period II, equated with the end of Troy I or early Troy II. At Troy itself decorated whorls were comparatively rare in Troy I, became more common in Troy II- III, and eventually outnumbered plain ones in Troy IV-V; but they suddenly grew rare again in Troy VI. Similarly at Poliochni incised decoration was virtually unknown on whorls of the Blue period, rare on those of the Red, but very common on ones of the Yellow contemporary with Troy II (Poliochni ii 280) . At Thermi on the other hand most of the decorated whorls came from Towns I- III, and while they occurred in Town IV, they had virtually disappeared in V. On the Greek mainland whorls with incised decoration seem to be confined to the Middle Helladic period, Early Helladic whorls being plain and undecorated (Eutresis 192 fig. 265, 198 pl. xix. The plain whorls are all classified as 'Loom Weights', but in size and shape they are comparable with spindle whorls from Troy and Emporio etc.). The designs on the Emporio whorls are mostly simple. Punctuated dots appear in horizontal or vertical rows. Orice (24) very fine dots are used as a fill. Linear decoration includes chevrons, zigzags (combined with rows of dots on 36), and irregular patterns (e.g. 25, 35). The cross-hatched triangles on 32 of type 9 are exceptional, as is the rosette-like design on top of 47.</page><page sequence="229">4. WHORLS 637 Enormous quantities of clay whorls were recovered in the successive excavations at Troy. Those from the old excavations were typed by Dörpfeld and later by Schmidt. The system of classification adopted here is based upon that used by Biegen for the whorls from the later excavations (see esp. Troy i 29, 49; ii 305 Table 27). While the shapes of the Emporio whorls correspond in a general way to those found at Troy, there appear to be certain local variations. Thus whorls of Group C, with countersinking at the top (as Troy type 1 7) instead of at both top and bottom, were not recognised at Emporio, although they were not uncommon in the horizon of Troy II-V. The whorls have been classified under 21 types divided between five Groups (A-E). The corresponding Trojan types on the systems of Biegen, Schmidt, and Dörpfeld, are given where they can be distinguished.

The flat stone whorl 1 1 of Period IX is interesting for its early connections. Pierced stone discs of spindle whorl size occurred at Jarmo in Mesopotamia (Jarmo 44). A fragment of a flat stone spindle whorl was found in a late level of the Neolithic at Sukas on the Syrian coast (Sukas iii 44 f. fig. 108). But flat clay whorls occurred in the Aceramic Neolithic of Syria at Tell Ramad I (Archaeology xxiv (1971) 280), and some from later Neolithic levels there and at Bougras had incised decoration (AASyrxiv (1964) pl. I A: 100pp. 122; xiii (1963) 206 f. fig. xiii: 6). Perforated stone discs were recovered in large numbers along with clay ones from Late Neolithic deposits at Byblos (Byblos v 1 64) . Such discs were interpreted as spindle whorls at Neolithic Sotira in Cyprus (Sotira 202. Cf. Khirokitia 285 nos. 393, 836, but these seem large for spindle whorls) . The earliest spindle whorls at Mersin were made of stone and were of a comparable shape, which was eventually reproduced there in clay (Mersin 32 f., 52, 7 1 , 75 f. figs. 1 8, 3 1 , 40, 47) . Similarly in the Neolithic at Knossos two perforated stone discs from Levels VI and V anticipate the first appearance of clay whorls (some of similar shapes to our types 6 and 7) in Levels IV and III there (AM lix (1964) 233). Tsountas noted that flat clay whorls were characteristic of the Thessalian Neolithic, but occurred in Bronze Age levels (DS 343 pl. 44: 1-1 1. Cf. Ayia Sofia Maguía pl. 18: 16, 18, Late Neolithic). At Kusura in Anatolia flat clay whorls were characteristic of the earliest period (Kusura A) (Archaeologia lxxxvi (1936) 30 fig. 13: 1). There are flat varieties of our type 4 among the clay whorls from the Knossos Neolithic (BSA lix (1964) 233 fig. 56: 10). But flat hemispherical whorls continue into the Bronze Age in Crete; some of this shape, made of clay, stone, and ivory, were found in the Early Minoan circular tomb at Krasi (ADelt xii (1929) 121 ff. figs. 15-6 nos. 45, 48, 53). Rather flat whorls with bevelled edges like 8 and 9 of type 4 from the Kitsos cave in Attica are made of bone and clay and assignable to the Late Neolithic (BCH xcviii (1974) 744 f. Tableau 1 : II, III). Both flat and standard varieties of type 4 occur in Late Neolithic contexts in Thessaly (e.g. Ayia Sofia Maguía pl. 18: 15, 20), and in Early Bronze Age ones in the Cyclades (Doumas, Burial Habits pl. xlvi: f-h, from Naxos: Ayioi Anargyroi). The standard hemispherical shape of type 4 may have originated in whorls made from the rounded joints of long bones. There is a bone whorl of this type for instance from Chalcolithic Mersin (Mersin 159 fig. 96 right, Level XV B); and others, apparently made from human bones, from early levels at Alishar (see BONE 54) . Hemispherical whorls are found in Egypt in the Middle and New Kingdoms (Pétrie, Tools and Weapons 53 nos. 138, 141-2). On the Greek mainland whorls of this shape are attested from the beginning of the Early Bronze Age if not</page><page sequence="234">642 III. EMPORIO before (e.g. Eutresis: Hesperiaxxix (i960) 142, III. 23; 157, VIII. 68, pl. 53. Perachora: BSA lxiv (1969) 68 fig. 8, Phases Y and Z, called loomweights. Stone whorls like 1 and 2 of type 1 have a long history, occurring for instance in the Neolithic of Cyprus {Khirokitia 284 f.). The two whorls 14 and 15 of types 7 and 8 apparently came from levels of Period I, assignable to the horizon of Troy II. Cylindrical whorls of this kind were at home in the Twelfth Dynasty in Egypt (Pétrie, Tools and Weapons 53 no. 140). Well over half the whorls found at Emporio (eighty-eight out of a total of one hundred and fifty-one) belonged to Group C, and most of these were assignable to type 9. Biconical whorls with a ridge at the centre like this were the commonest at Troy throughout the Early Bronze Age there (Troy I-V). They were also in evidence at Kum Tepe in Phase I C contemporary with Troy I {Kum Tepe 342, 350, 354 f.). Further east in Anatolia whorls like our type 9 are characteristic of E.B. 1 and 2, regarded as parallel with Troy I- II. At Beycesultan such whorls were displaced by other types at the beginning of E.B. 3 {Beycesultan i 277) . Biconical whorls akin to type 9 were similarly peculiar to Period A and the early stages of B at Kusura {Archaeologia lxxxvi (1936) 34 fig. 13 no. 10. Cf. ibid, lxxxvii (1937) 254). One of type 10 with countersunk ends and incised decoration was found alongside whorls of type 15 in Complex II at Aphrodisias {AJA lxxiii (1969) 58, 62 ill. 1 1 E, pl. 26 fig. 25). Whorls of biconical shape occur much earlier than this, however, in Anatolia and elsewhere in the Near East. They are reported from Hacilar VI {Hacilar i 1 64; ii pl. cxvii) , and are said to be frequent in the 'Early Chalcolithic' at Korucutepe in the Keban dam area {JNES xxxii (1973) 358). Similarly at Mersin they first appear beside the earlier flat types in the Early Chalcolithic Level XXII {Mersin 75 f. fig. 47). Still further east at Gawra biconical whorls, mostly with incised decoration, occur in Stratum XIII and are common in XII contemporary with the Uruk period of Mesopotamia {Gawra ii 168). At By bios biconical clay whorls were at home by the Middle Neolithic {By bios v 123), which may correspond to the earliest Pottery Neolithic of Jericho and to Ugarit V B (ibid. 67, 89) . The biconical shape was still dominant at Byblos in the Late Neolithic, and several Late Neolithic whorls had simple incised or punctuated decoration (ibid. 163 f. pl. cviii). Biconical whorls with incised or punctuated decoration are also attested at Mersin in the Middle Chalcolithic there {Mersin 103 fig. 60; 178 f. fig. 1 16: 5th row, left). Mersin 103 fig. 60 with rows of punctuation is reminiscent of one from Matarrah, where biconical whorls vastly predominated {JNES xi (1952) 18 pl. ix: 3). On the Greek mainland plain biconical whorls are said to be at home in the last stages of the Late Neolithic and in the succeeding Final Neolithic in the Franchthi Cave {Hesperia xlii (1973) 276) . But a crudely formed biconical whorl from Nemea is assigned to the Early Neolithic {JVemea 272 pl. 69: 9). Some whorls from Middle Neolithic contexts at Sesklo seem to be of biconical shape (Theochares, Neolithic Greece pl. 121). A biconical whorl is reported from the Early Neolithic at Servia {Servia 195). Other biconical whorls from Neolithic contexts in Greece include one from the Skoteini Cave (Tharounia) in Euboia {AAA ix (1976) 53 f. fig. 11). One from Doxat-Tepe in eastern Macedonia is assigned to the Late Neolithic {ADeltxxx (1975) 225, 216 fig. 6: 23). Biconical whorls occur alongside ones of other shapes in the latest Neolithic of Crete (Phaistos: Annuario 1 - li (1972-73) 91 fig. 78: 11, 15). In Macedonia, steeped in influences from the Trojan area, whorls of this biconical shape seem to be first attested in the Late Neolithic, which may overlap with Troy I, but they were still normal there at the end of the local Bronze Age {PMac 78, 87, 93, 101, 108). This is interesting, because biconical whorls of primitive appearance with burnished surfaces occur further south on the Greek mainland during Myc. Ill C. Mrs. Helen Hughes-Brock tells me that good parallels</page><page sequence="235">4. STONE (VASES) 643 for the small biconical whorls 28 and 29 from Mycenaean deposits at Emporio come from Myc. Ill C contexts at Nichoria in the southern Péloponnèse. There are also whorls of our type 21 from Dark Age (Myc. Ill C- Protogeometric) contexts there; some of these have decoration comparable with that on the stone example of this type (56) [Hesperia xliv (1975) 120 pl. 32: f, right). Whorls of the biconical type continued to be at home in later times in Greece. Several whorls of this type were recovered from deposits of the Harbour Sanctuary at Emporio [Greek Emporio 235 fig. 156: 511, 512). Biconical clay whorls are also found in the Neolithic of the Balkans (e.g. Häbäsesti 267 f. fig. 27, associated with others of shapes akin to our types 2, 17 and 18 (ibid. fig. 28)). Some of those from Anzabegovo in Jugoslav Macedonia assigned to Anza IV (early Vinca) have simple incised decoration [Anza 148). Apart from a few assignable to Period I (the horizon of Troy II) all the stratified examples of whorls of Groups D and E at Emporio came from Late Bronze Age or Mycenaean levels. But a good many of Group D, and some of E, were from mixed deposits in Area F, and some of these may have belonged to the horizon of Troy III-V. Whorls of type 14 (Troy type 2 1 ) were very common in Troy VI, and although some ofthat shape occurred earlier in Troy II-V, none were attested from levels of Troy I. Related types at Beycesultan were characteristic of E.B. 3 there. Clay spindle whorls of similar shapes are found in early Mycenaean contexts in the Argolid (Wace, Chamber Tombs 218. Prosymna^i^); butin Myc. Ill A-B clay whorls were largely replaced by stone ones of our type 20 and other shapes. Whorls with a countersunk top like type 15 were first attested at Emporio in Period I. Conical whorls (as our Group E) with countersunk tops are found in very early contexts in the Near East (e.g. JJVES xi (1952) 18 fig. 17: 8, from Matarrah). At Troy whorls with countersunk tops were characteristic of Troy II: only three whorls with countersinking at one end were recovered from Troy I, one from the Middle Subperiod and two from the Late; but over 60 of various shapes came from the horizon of Troy II [Troy i 49 types 10, 23; 217 types 10, 11, 17, 22, 23). Similarly at Poliochni such whorls (a scodelletta incavata) are a new type which suddenly becomes prevalent in the Yellow period contemporary with Troy II [Poliochni ii 280). At Aphrodisias further south in Turkey such whorls are described as seeming peculiar to Complexes E and I assignable to an advanced phase of E.B. Ill [AJA lxxv ( 197 1 ) 135); but some are illustrated from the preceding Complex II, which may be contemporary with the end of Troy II [AJA lxxiii (1969) 58,62 ill. 11: A-C, pl. 26 figs. 24, 25, 27). At Bogazköy such whorls are dated to the end of the Early Bronze Age ( W. Schirmer, Die Bebauung am unteren Bùy'ùkkale- Nordwesthang in Bogazkqy (Berlin, 1969)) pl. 47). At Argissa in Thessaly whorls of this type with countersunk tops do not appear to be attested until FThess III when some of the pottery is reminiscent of Troy II or later [Argissa iii pl. 51: 22, 23). One whorl of this type was recovered from an Early Helladic III context at Lerna [Hesperia xxiv (1955) 37 pl. 22: i). There are some from a Middle Bronze Age tomb on Kea [Hesperia xli (1972) 386 pl. 89, E 42). Such whorls are attested from Phylakopi on Melos [Phylakopi 213 pl. xxxviii: 15).

STONE (VASES) 645 Period VIII, another (2) from one of V. The marble seems to vary in character. The vases were presumably imports. The situation at Emporio seems to be comparable with that at Tigani in neighbouring Samos. Stone vases were not attested in the earliest phase of occupation revealed by the new excavations there; but a good many fragments of marble vessels were recovered from later deposits which may overlap with Emporio VIII-VI (Samos xiv 130, 132 note 24, 133). Six fragments of white marble vases, apparently Cycladic imports, were recovered at Thermi, five of them from deposits of Towns I- III (Thermi 177). The only fragment of a marble vase from the latest excavations at Troy came from a level of the Middle Subperiod of Troy I (Troy i 46, 159 fig. 217: 38.99). Two from Schliemann's excavations were thought to be assignable to Troy VI (SS nos. 7906-7). But vases of white marble were in use long before the time of Troy I both in the Troad and elsewhere in Anatolia. Thus a fragmentary marble bowl was found with the burial of a woman belonging to the earliest phase (I A 1 ) of occupation at Kum Tepe (Kum Tepe 311,322 no. 1 39) . White marble bowls were recovered from Levels IV and VIA at Çatal Hüyük (AS xiv (1964) 84), and two pieces of them from the aceramic settlement at Hacilar. No remains of them were attested from Hacilar IX-VII, but they abounded in Hacilar VI and were found in levels of V-II although not in those of I (Hacilar i 149 ff.; ii 166-8, 439-46). It does not seem to have been established where these early Anatolian stone vases were made. In some of the Cycladic islands a flourishing manufacture of stone vases, mostly of white marble, is attested at the beginning of the local Bronze Age. This island industry may have begun in Neolithic times; but the evidence for it is so far curiously thin. Doumas, Burial Habits 16, indeed says that marble vases do not appear in the earliest stage of Early Cycladic I. Only two fragments of white marble vases were recovered from Saliagos (Saliagos 65 fig. 22 pl. xiv: 3). In Crete there appears to be no evidence for the manufacture of stone vases of any kind before the Early Bronze Age. The few stone vases from Early Helladic contexts on the Greek mainland seem to be imports, except perhaps at Ayios Kosmas on the coast of Attica where marble cups and bowls of Cycladic types may have been manufactured for local use (Ayios Kosmas 187 s.v. marble). Fragments of stone vases are not uncommon, however, on Neolithic sites on the mainland, and they seem to have been made at various centres there. Thus marble vases were much in evidence at the Early Neolithic site I by Lake Nesson in Thessaly; some of these were made of the local green marble, but others were of white marble ( Thessalika iv (1962) 80) . Fragments of white marble vases have been recovered from other Neolithic sites in Thessaly and elsewhere on the mainland. Two from Gentiki were assigned by Theochares to the Early Pottery (E.N. I) phase immediately succeeding the Preceramic (Thessalika iv (1962) 75 pl. viii: 1). White marble bowls were abundantly represented in the Protosesklo (E.N. II) horizon at Argissa according to Milojcic, Ergebnisse 9. One from a level assignable to Protosesklo at Sesklo was unfinished, as if it were being made there (Ergon 1963, 29 f. fig. 35. PAE 1963, 41 pl. 30). White marble bowls were common in levels of the earlier Neolithic at Nea Makri on the east coast of Attica (PAE 1954, 120. Nea Makri 24 f., 26). Fragments of vases that appear to be made of white marble have been reported from Middle Neolithic levels in the Franchthi cave (Hesperia xxxviii ( 1 969) 37 1 pl. 98, c) ; a miniature footed bowl of marble is said to have been found with an Early Neolithic infant burial there (AR 1 973-74, 13). There is a fragment of a marble bowl from Late Neolithic Akropotamos in eastern Macedonia (A JA xiv ( 1 94 1 ) 565) . A white marble bowl fragment came from the top soil at Elateia (Elateia 204 pl. 69, g: 1). Vessels were being fashioned out of white stone of one kind or another from very early times in the Near East. White stone bowls appear in the Aceramic Neolithic of Syria and may have</page><page sequence="238">646 III. EMPORIO been imitated in the artificial white plaster ware which preceded the making of pottery in that region (AASyr xiii (1963) 182, 206 f. fig. xiii: 2, 3; xiv (1964) 127. Archaeology xxiv (1971 ) 280. Mellaart, Neolithic Near East 62 f.). 1. [A, Q, 145, Period VIII) Fragment, roughly rectangular, measuring 4x2x0.2 thick. Perhaps from a straight-sided cylindrical pyxis, cf. Warren, MSV ^2 P 458, 459, with references. White to brownish marble with very fine crystals. The ends are worn smooth, as if the fragment had been used as a rubber. 2. (i4, R 59, Period V) Fragment 5 x 3 x 0.8 thick. White marble with large crystals. 3. (Z), Q,?7, pre-stage I?) Rim of bowl. Veined white marble with fairly large crystals. 4. (F, D 1, Mycenaean) (plate 134) Foot. Greyish white marble. Many Cycladic marble vases of the Early Bronze Age have feet like 4. Two fragments of marble pedestal feet of this kind were found at Corinth in levels assigned to the Late Neolithic (Walker Kosmopoulos, Corinth 62 fig. 46, Periods III and IV). The fragment 5 comes from a compartmented dish of some kind. It seems to be made of stone, not clay, although it is very light in weight. The boat-shaped clay dish from Tsangli offers a vague parallel (PThess 1 13 fig. 74: c. N.I. Giannopulos, AM xxxv (1910) 63, 60 fig. 3). Compare also some Early Cycladic clay boxes illustrated by Doumas, Burial Habits pl. xlvii: a, from Naxos: Ayioi Anargyroi. 5. (A, Q21 by wall 22, Periods IV/III) (plate 134) Soft, black, flaky stone (?), with white inclusions. Very light in weight. Lamp 6 (fig. 289) Part of a stone lamp was recovered from the area of the Greek Temple. It was clearly of Bronze Age date and may have been imported from Crete, where plain undecorated lamps of this type were made in Middle Minoan Ill-Late Minoan I times (Warren, MSV 52 f.). Lamps of this Cretan type have been recovered from Mycenaean contexts on the Greek mainland and in the islands (e.g. Cos 273 f. fig. 229). A similar but more elaborate type of stone lamp was found at Troy {Troy iii 17, 230 fig. 298: 38.116. Warren, MSV 55). 6. {Temple Area, trench F) Fragment of lamp. Blue-grey marble. Mortars and door sockets 7-1 1 (fig. 291. plate 135) Mortars like saddle querns (12, 13) were normally made of hard, coarse, gritty stone, perhaps of local volcanic origin. One fragment (7) came from a mortar of rectangular shape; both the shape and the material of this were exceptional. The other mortars noted were more or less circular, but often had one side projecting in a rough triangle. Anyone kneeling down to use the mortar could have clasped this triangular projection between their knees to steady it. Most of the mortars came from the Acropolis (Area F) , but the only two from a datable context there were in levels of Period I, assignable to the horizon of Troy II. One of these was found upside down. Another mortar was similarly found upside down on the floor of the fire-destroyed Period IV House IV in Area A. No doubt mortars were placed this way when not in use to keep dirt from settling in them. In some cases (e.g. 9) holes had been worn in the bottoms of mortars (cf. PThess 121). Mortars have a long history in this part of the world. They were common in Periods II- III at Neolithic Khirokitia in Cyprus (Khirokitia 259 f.), and are well represented in the Neolithic of Knossos, where they appear to be mostly oval in shape (BSA lix ( 1 964) 23 1 fig. 53) . They are also attested at Saliagos (Saliagos 71) and in Thessaly in the Neolithic there (PThess 72, 121, 191, fig.</page><page sequence="239">fig. 291. Stone objects (STONE 7-10, 16). Scale 1/4. 4. STONE (MORTARS) 647 7 ' - " 8 JL ^*****^^ g 70. Zervos, JViaw ii pl. 478). Mortars seem to be common at Poliochni from the Blue period onwards, but one exceptionally regular in shape is illustrated from the Black period, which should be contemporary with Emporio VII-VI (Poliochni i 547, 610, 675, pls. iii: c (Black period), civ: 1-6 (Blue period), clxxxviii: 1-7 (Green and Red periods). A few mortars are recorded from Troy I- III (Troy i 1 1 1, 114 fig. 218: I 1,13 (Troy I); 352 fig. 363: E 6. 65 (Troy II). Troy ii 39, 70, 84 f., fig. 49 (Troy III). Cf. Phylakopi 199 f. fig. 173. Aspripetra 282 figs. 65-8, from the Aspripetra cave on Cos) . Stones with circular hollows like those of mortars but only c. 8-10 across might have been door sockets. These were common at Thermi (Thermi 8 with references), and throughout the Bronze Age at Troy ( Troy i-iii index s.v. pivot stone. Cf. SS 306 nos. 9267-8 1 ) . They occur in the Bronze Age in Crete and on the Greek mainland, but on the mainland they are already attested it seems in the Early Neolithic (e.g. Elateia 166. Cf. PThess 72) . One hollowed stone from Saliagos may have been a door socket rather than a mortar (Saliagos 71 fig. 90: 4). Five stones of this type were found at Emporio. None of them was noted in a clear association with a door, but the small size of the hollows and the character of the stones of which they were made suggest that they were not mortars. 7. {A, unstmified) (plate i 35) Period unknown.

(F, unstratified) (plate i 35) Period unknown. Door socket (?) Hollow 8 in diameter. Dirty white to reddish stone. Saddle Querns 12-13 (plate 135) These were flat or saddle-shaped on the upper grinding surface. Querns of this kind were recovered from levels of all periods from VIII onwards. A wide variety of stones was used for querns, but most were made of hard igneous rock, probably of local volcanic origin (cf. Troy i 46) . About 25 per cent were of a distinctive hard gritty stone, much pocked, and greyish green or purple in colour; similar stone was used for the mortars 8-10, and for some pounders like 16. Querns or fragments of them were sometimes incorporated in house walls (e.g. 12). 12. {A, G wall 12, Period VIII) (plate 135) Length 34. Whitish conglomerate with pebbles of all colours in it. 13. (F, B 10, stage 3, Period II) (plate 135) Length 31. Green stone with fine grit dominantly white and black in colour. Pounders and rubbers 14-21 (figs. 291-2. plate 134) Three varieties of these could be distinguished: (1) Roughly spherical or cubical; (2) Tall conical; (3) Waisted. (1) Roughly spherical or cubical (P.M. Warren, BSA lx (1965) 310 f.: Group I) Pounders and rubbers of this shape are common in early times throughout the Aegean area. They are small enough (measuring between 5-7 across) to hold in the hand; they are characteristically made of hard stones, and usually show clear traces of wear. One standard use for them was no doubt as rubbers on querns, as shown in Troy i pl. 363: E 6.61, 86, 62. Cf. Rios 569 f. no. 1283. For other examples e.g. Tarsus '' 271 fig. 414 no. 16, E.B. 11.

Coarse-grained greyish brown stone. 15. (F, F 1, stage 7, Mycenaean) (plate 134) Light greyish brown igneous rock. Top and bottom worn flat by use. (2) Tall conical. Pounders or rubbers of this type would have been suitable for use in mortars. Only one (16) was recorded from Emporio, but they were common in early times throughout the Aegean area and elsewhere. E.g. Poliochni'1609 pl. civ: 27-9 (Blue period) with references; 675 pl. clxxxix: 1-5 (Green and Red periods). Elateia 205 pl. 70: b, Early and Middle Neolithic. 16. (A, unstratified) (fig. 291. plate 135) Period uncertain. Grey igneous rock. (3) Waisted. These distinctive objects, measuring when complete between 6-9.5 l°ng&gt; might be interpreted as weights; but they are made of hard igneous rock of the kind used for mortars and querns, and have traces of wear on their ends. They are therefore likely to have been pounders or rubbers of some kind. Waisted grinders of comparable shape are found in Egypt as early as Dynasty I (Abydos i 25 f. pl. liii: 29, 32); and they also occur in Palestine (Megiddo i pl. 106: 2 (Stratum II)). One like our</page><page sequence="241">4. STONE (MACEHEADS) 649 examples is illustrated from Troy (Ilios 570 f. no. 1286. Schliemann, Troy and its Remains 97 no. 64); a number similar to this were recovered from levels of City II at Troy in the 1882 campaign according to Schliemann, Troja 173. There is one from Level I (contemporary with Troy I) of the Mound of Protesilaos (Protesilaos 22 fig. 22: 4). A number of similar tools, described as hammers, were found in levels of the Green, Red, and Yellow periods at Poliochni {Poliochni i 67 4. pl. clxxxix: 9-13, 15-18; ii 309 ff. pl. cclxii: 1-4). Pounders resembling the ones from Emporio also occur in the Cyclades (e.g. AE 1899, 123 fig. 33. Cf. AE 1898, 175 pl. 8: 8 (broken)). What may be waisted pounders of this type are illustrated from Malthi on the Greek mainland (Valmin, SME 352 pl. xxvi: L. 4-6). I have seen one made of coarse white limestone (L. 10) in Tanagra museum. Related but less comparable tools with narrow waists, making them easy to haft as double hammers, have been recovered from Poliochni {Poliochni ii pl. cclxii: 5, 8, 9 (Yellow period), and pl. cclxiii: 6 for possible method of hafting). There are similar tools from the Cyclades {AE 1898, 175 pl. 8: 14. Cf. Phylakopi 200 fig. 173, top left); and Crete (e.g. FTM 50 pl. xxxiii: 10 18, from the shrine at Koumasa). The perforated stone double hammers of Middle Minoan Ill-Late Minoan I times in Crete (e.g. Zervos, ACr 356 pl. 522) may be sophisticated versions of this type. Double hammers of this narrow-waisted kind occur eastwards in Anatolia (e.g. Alishar I93°~32 i 1 85 fig- 187:6410, said to be 'relatively frequent' in the Copper Age. Cf. Alishar ig28-2g i 62 fig. 7 1 : b 488, b 1 557, from Stratum I) . But one from the Early Bronze Age horizon at Alishar has a wider waist and closely resembles our type (3) {Alishar 1930-32 i 267 fig. 270: e 2314. Cf. ibid. ii 423 fig. 481 : e 692, assigned to the post-Hittite Phrygian period, and ibid, iii 93 fig. 91 : d 1 197, of the first half of the first millennium). Hammers or pounders akin to our type (3) also come in the horizon of the Gumelnija culture of Romania (e.g. Dacia ii (1925) 193 fig. 47: 4, from Cäscioarele). 17.

(F, B ?9, stage ?4, Period ?I) (plate 134) L. 8. Greyish igneous rock mottled with white. Maceheads 22-23 (FIG- 292) Clubs or maces with stone heads were employed as weapons in early times in many parts of the Near East, including Egypt, Mesopotamia, Syria and Anatolia, as well as throughout Europe. They were still in use in some areas of the civilised world during the Bronze Age, and (although only perhaps for ceremonial purposes) until the very end of it (e.g. J. du Plat Taylor in Cape Gelidonya i26ff. Cf. PMac 107, 240 fig. 112: a, from Vardaroftsa, assigned to the Early Iron Age). Stone maceheads were current during the Neolithic in Crete {BSA lxiii (1968) 270; lix (1964) 229 f. fig. 52 pl. 55 (4): Levels VI-I), and a few have been recovered from Bronze Age contexts there (e.g. Archaeologia lxv (1914) 15 fig. 25). A considerable number have been reported from Thessaly, where they mostly appear to be of Bronze Age date {PThess 42, 71, 165, 202. DS 322-4. Cf. Zervos, Nais ii pl. 488); Tsountas commented upon the Bronze Age contexts. Maceheads seem to have been less common in the Neolithic and Bronze Age of southern Greece, although they are recorded from a number of sites there (e.g. Ayios Kosmas 30 fig. 169: 65 (E.H. II ?). Asine 246 (assigned to E.H. III). Dendra NT 9 fig. 7: 1, from the Acropolis).

The head from which this came may have been spherical or pear-shaped with a cylindrical hole. Maceheads were similarly rare at Poliochni, where only two fragments of them were recovered {Poliochni i 605 f. pl. c nos. 7, 8 (cii nos. 5, 4), both of the Blue period, with references). But there were a few from Thermi (Thermi 182), and many from the old excavations (although none it seems from the recent ones!) at Troy (SS nos. 7295-7342, in a large variety of shapes, some assignable to Troy I, others later. Cf. Tul 323, 377). The object 23 with hour-glass perforation comes from a Roman level, and may be a weight of that period. A somewhat similar object, however, weight or macehead, was found in Town I at Thermi (Thermi 182 fig. 59, 9: 30.52). Some of the maceheads from Levels VI-I of the Neolithic at Knossos have hour-glass perforations, but a stone with hour-glass perforation from the earlier Level IX is interpreted as a digging-stick weight (BSA lix (1964) 231, 146 pl. 58 (4)). 22. (A, G 103, Period VI) Fragment, apparently from globular or pear-shaped macehead with cylindrical shaft-hole (diam. c. 1.8). Hard greyish brown Plimestone. 23. (F, D Roman level) Only half preserved. Diam. 8.3. Hour-glass perforation. Greyish white limestone. Surface evenly rounded, but rough. Celts 24-27 (fig. 292. plate 134) Only four cutting tools of ground or polished stone were recovered at Emporio. This might suggest that metal was in general use there for tools from relatively early times. But many stone celts were found at Troy in levels of all periods of the Bronze Age ( Troy i-iii indices s.v. Celt. SS 271 f. nos. 6930-7174); and they were common at Thermi (Thermi 185 ff.). Five were recovered from levels of the Blue period at Poliochni, and a substantial number from those of the succeeding Green and Red periods (Poliochni i 606 f., 674 pls. c, ci, clxxxvii). Three of the Emporio celts, none of them unfortunately from stratified contexts, had axe-like blades, but the fourth (24) from a level of Period X was an adze. 24. (A, G hearth in 163, Period X) (plate 134) Humped section with adze-like blade. Cutting edge chipped. Surface polished. Hard black stone resembling slate. Cf. Thermi 185 f. fig. 55: 31.107, from Town I: the only celt with a humped section like this found there. But there were a good many from Troy (SS 272 nos. 71 17-7174). 25. (F, D Roman level) (plate 134) Axe, cf. Tsountas type A. Butt squared flat; oval section. Mottled black and white igneous rock. Surface finely polished. 26. (A, unstratified) (plate 134) Axe, cf. Tsountas type B. Thin oval section. Hard dark grey close-grained stone. Butt rough, as if from battering. Surface, especially of blade, well smoothed. 27. (Temple Area, Roman level) (plate 134) Blade of Pchisel. Subrectangular section. Fine green stone with light yellow veining. Surface polished. Whetstones 28-32 (fig. 292. plates 134, 136) These are all made of some variety of dark greyish schist-like stone. Three of the complete examples have a hole for suspension through the narrow end; once (30) this is combined with notches near the wider end. Whetstones like these were in use in the Aegean area throughout the Bronze Age and into much later times (cf. Archaeologia lxxxvi (1936) 50 f, for discussion and references apropos of those from Kusura). Thus 32 from the Late Roman destruction level in area F may be of that period rather than earlier. 28. (A, R 48 below floor of clay bin in NW corner of House IV, Period V) (plate 136) L. 4.2. Neat rectangular section; hour-glass perforation. Purplish grey stone. Cf.

Possibly a pendant (female idol?) rather than a whetstone, as surfaces show no signs of wear. Cf. Thermi 192 f., for the difficulty of distinguishing pendants from whetstones. An object similar to 30 is illustrated from an early level at Vardaroftsa (BSA xxvii (1925-26) 33: Period A (Macedonian E.B.A.)). But a whetstone with a notch for string and no perforation was found in the Cape Gelidonya wreck dating from the end of the L.B.A. (Cape Gelidonya 128 St. 9 figs. 137-8). 31. (F, B ?7, stage ?6A) (plate 136) Broken at one end. L. preserved 7.2. Grey-green stone. 32. (F, F Roman level) (plate 134) L. 7.8. Flaky greenish blue micaceous schist. Bracelets 33-34 (fig. 292. plate 134) Two fragments of stone circlets were recovered from levels of Periods VIII and VII. One of these (33) of which the diameter could be restored was only c. 4.5 across the inside, too small to be worn as a bracelet even by a child (cf. BSA lix (1964) 237, apropos of similar objects from early Neolithic levels at Knossos). Perhaps these stone circlets were pendants, variants of the ring-pendants which have a separate hole for suspension (see METAL 17). But a stone circlet from the Upper Cave at Ayio Gala (AG 333) was large enough to serve as a bracelet, and AG 330 looks as if it was part of another large example.

Neither of the two stone examples described below is certainly prehistoric. The disc 35 apparently came from a Mycenaean level, but the parallels for it suggest an Iron Age date; and it may have been a spindle whorl rather than a bead. The bead 36 was recovered from a mixed deposit with both Roman and Bronze Age material. Pendants include the small irregular perforated stone 37 of Period VIII, and the converted mould 39. 35.

One (2401) is almost exactly similar in size to 35, but the others are larger. There are comparable large discs from neo-Hittite levels at Arslantepe (P.E.

Such moulds were normally made of stone, but sometimes of clay (e.g. SS nos. 6758-6763 from Troy: some of these Trojan moulds are cut in fragments of pithoi (Troy i 283 fig. 369: 37.127. Tw/368 pl. 45, i))- Several hollows for casting different types of tool or different varieties of the same type might be combined together. There is a good series of multiple moulds of this kind from the old excavations at Troy assigned to the horizon of Troy II-V (SS 265 ff. nos. 6723-7. Tul 368 pl. 45, V). These are more elaborate than our mould, with hollows for casting a variety of objects, although flat celts predominate as being the basic type of metal tool. Others from Troy (SS 265 f.) and one from Poliochni (Poliochni i 108, 658 pl. clxxxvii: 13, Green period) are more comparable with 38. Early Aegean moulds are listed by Branigan, Aegean Metalwork 201 f. Moulds of this kind were still being used in the Aegean in the Late Bronze Age for making flat chisels; a rectangular mould with no less than 1 3 separate casting hollows was recovered from the L.M. I B destruction level of c. 1450 b.c. at Gournia in Crete (Gournia 32 pl. iii: 67). Moulds for making flat axes have been found in Romania (I. Nestor, P^xix (1928) 131 fig. 2:</page><page sequence="246">654 III. EMPORIO i, Glina III), and as far west as Ireland (MJ. O'Kelly, 'A Stone Mould for Axeheads from Doonour, Bantry, Co. Cork', Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland xcix (1969) 1 17-24). 38. (A, X ?26 south of wall 49, Period IV) (plate 137) Wedge-shaped stone with two hollows 1 5.3 and 1 3.3 in length for casting flat axes. Greyish brown stone. The remarkable little mould 39 for making a butterfly-shaped ornament is Mycenaean or Late Minoan. Stone moulds for beads and ornaments from the Aegean area are assignable to the Late Bronze Age, and were used for making objects of gold, glass and faience (Wace, Mycenae 1 10. Higgins, Greek and Roman Jewellery 42 f.). Such moulds are listed by E. Vermeule, Bulletin of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts lxv (1967) 31 note 4. For others see Helen Hughes-Brock, in J.N. Coldstream, Knossos: the Sanctuary of Demeter (London, 1 973) 121, and Hesperia xliv ( 1 975) 1 2 1 pl. 28: a. Insects interpreted as bees or chrysalis-like objects appear on moulds from Mycenae and Nichoria (Kadmos v (1966) 144 ff. Hesperia xliv (1975) 121 pl. 28: a). Butterfly ornaments have been considered by Evans (PM ii 787 ff.), and more recently by Ch. Tzavella (Acta of the Second Cretological Congress i (Athens, 1968) 263-7). The creature of our mould is close to some of the gold butterfly ornaments from Mycenase shaft grave III assignable to L.M./L.H. I (Karo, SG 51 pl. xxvi no. 51). But the rosette-decorated wings of the pair of confronted butterflies in profile on the blade of a type A sword from Mycenae shaft grave circle B are not serrated (Mylonas, Circle B 1 18 pl. 99, a). Other gold ornaments from early Mycenaean contexts on the mainland show butterflies with serrated wings of this type in profile. There is one from a chamber tomb at Mycenae (JHS xxiv (1904) 323 f. no. 4902 fig. 1, c). Several in the shape of pairs of confronted butterflies like this come from a tholos tomb at Peristeria in Messenia (Ergon 1965, 92 fig. 1 14. ADelt xxi (1966) Chron. 1 67 pl. 1 70) . Similar butterflies appear in profile on the bowsprit of one of the ships in the miniature fresco from Akrotiri ( Thera vi col. pi 9, bottom left) ; this is datable to Late Minoan I A in Cretan terms. The fine butterfly in relief on a bronze double axe from Phaistos assignable to Middle Minoan III B- Late Minoan I A has wings of this kind (A. Mosso, The Dawn of Mediterranean Civilization (London, 19 10) 318 f. fig. 180. O. Montelius, La Grèce préclassique (Stockholm, 1924) pl. 5: 6. W. Deonna, BCHlxxviii (1954) 253 n. 9, for other references. Evans, PM ii 787 f., for the date). Representations of butterflies like these also appear on seal impressions from Crete (e.g. PM ii 789 fig. 515, from the Little Palace at Knossos). The same kind of wings are found adorning a sphinx and in other contexts on seal impressions from the Late Minoan I B destruction level at Zakro in eastern Crete (JHS xxii (1902) 83 f. fig. 19 (No. 74). PMi 705 figs. 528-9). A butterfly with outspread wings comparable to that on our mould occurs on a three-sided prism seal from Thebes (CMSv. 2, 551 No. 677, b). Outspread wings with serrated edges of a debased form are seen on butterflies on gold plaques from the Tombe dei Nobili at Phaistos assignable to Late Minoan III A (MA xiv (1904) 601 fig. 66). But the butterfly on a spear-head from a warrior grave of Late Minoan II- III A 1 at Knossos is entirely different and has gone far down the road of degeneration (BSA xlvii (1952) 267, II (4), fig. 15, b). The evidence above suggests that our mould was made at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, before the end of Late Minoan I/Late Helladic II A, c. 1450 b.c. In that case it may be one of the earliest moulds for jewellery known from the Aegean area. It was almost certainly not made at Emporio, and the material, chlorite schist, suggests the possibility that it originated in Crete, where stone of this kind abounds and was much used for vases (Warren, MSV 1 29 f.) . The</page><page sequence="247">4. STONE (IDOLS) 655 conversion of the mould into a pendant or amulet may date from much later, Myc. Ill B or C times, before or after it reached Chios. The choice of the mould for use in this way may have been guided by the object carved on it. Butterflies appear to have had some religious or magical importance for the peoples of the Aegean area during the Bronze Age. Evans argued that in Minoan Crete they were regarded as the souls of the dead, or emblems of their souls or spirits, as in later Greek and Roman times (PM ii 787 fiT.; iii 153 f. Cf. S. Alexiou, Minoan Civilization (Heraklion, 1969) 1 20 f). This interpretation is in harmony with the appearance of a pair of burterflies on the Ring of Nestor. The authenticity of the Ring is disputed, but a pair of butterflies is also manifest on a gold signet ring engraved with a cult scene from a tomb at Arkhanes south of Knossos (I.A. Sakellarakis, Archaeology xx ( 1 967) 280 fig. 1 3) . In the light of this the excavator of the tomb has advanced strong arguments for considering the Ring of Nestor genuine (J.A. Sakellarakis, 'Über die Echtheit des sogenannten Nestorringes', Acta of the Third Cretological Congress i (Athens, 1973) 303-18). 39. (F, B 2/1, stages 7/8, Mycenaean) (plate 137) Mould for making butterfly-shaped ornament; later bored with hour-glass perforation for use as pendant or amulet. L. 4.5. Green chlorite schist, very fine grained (I am grateful to Dr. Hans-Ude Nissen for identification of the stone) . Both ends sawn smooth; the upper and lower surfaces and the long sides less smooth. The ends may have been sawn to reduce the mould in size when it was converted into a pendant. The butterfly itself is 2.5 long and 3 across the tips of the wings. The nose is joined to a deep cutting for moulding a perforated bar by which the ornament could have been suspended. Pendants with perforated bars for suspension like this tend to be relatively early according to Mrs. Hughes-Brock. Compare a faience pendant from the Temple Repositories at Knossos (PM i 498 fig. 356, top right). DisCS 4O-4I (FIG. 293. PLATE 1 36) A large flat stone disc 38 in diameter from the fill of tomb 1 in Area E was evidently a pithos lid. It had no doubt been used to close the mouth of a pithos used for a burial. But the two discs 40 and 41 seem rather small for lids. One (41) has rough incised decoration. 40. (Early Christian basilica church, Section 9, U 11, Period II (?)) Diam. 4.8. Greyish brown stone. Roughly chipped into a circle. 41. (A, unstratified) (plate 136) Period unknown. Diam. 5.5. Soft white stone. Plano-convex cross-section. Rough scratched decoration: the rounded 'upper' surface with radii, the flat 'lower' surface cross-hatched. Weight 42 (fig. 293) The large flat violin-shaped stone 42 from a level of Period II may have been a weight. Weights of similar waisted shape, but smaller in size, were found at Saliagos (Saliagos 71 fig. 87 pl. li). They were made by taking a flattish stone and cutting notches for a cord in the sides. The large size of our stone would have rendered it suitable for use as an anchor. Idols of this shape appear to have been at home in Troy II- III (Troy i fig. 360: 34.1, 35.208, 35.40 (Troy II); Troy ii fig. 48: 34.429, 33.292 (Troy III); Troy iii 124 fig. 298: 37.334 (Troy VI, but almost certainly of an earlier period) ; and they are also attested in the Early Neolithic of Macedonia (PMac 1 38 fig. 6: j, k, pl. iv, called axes).

Except in the case of the largest (49) the stone of these is white or yellowish white, and probably came from the neighbouring Mount Prophètes Elias; it is too soft for making tools, and the objects show no signs of wear. They vary in size and shape, but are all elongated (measuring between 6 and 22 in length when complete) and usually somewhat triangular. Two (43, 48) with bulbous ends and of circular cross-section have marked traces of fire on them. While some may be natural stones selected for their shape, others appear to have been worked.

This small stone ball may have been used for a game, like some from Gawra (Gawra ii 84 f., 91 , 205 pl. xcvi, a: Strata XI and XI A). But stone balls, usually rather larger than ours, from Eutresis and elsewhere in the Aegean area have been interpreted as sling bolts (Eutresis 206 fig. 276: 1, 2 (E.H.). Poliochni i 611 with references for others). They were very numerous in the Blue period at Poliochni (Poliochni i 610 pl. civ: 7-25). The Poliochni balls were nearly all made of sandstone, and were somewhat larger than ours, between 2.3-5.1 (mostly c. 3.5) in diameter. A few comparable stone balls are published from Troy (Troy i 37, 87 fig. 217: 35.120, of light brown stone (Troy I); Troy ii 149 fig. 148: 33. 122 (Troy IV)). But small oval-shaped stones which occur in Troy II-IV also appear to have been used as sling bolts (Troy i-ii s.v. Pellet). Similar elongated stone bolts have been recognised from the Late Neolithic of Macedonia (PMac 164 fig. 34, d, e: Olynthus); and from Cyprus (Sotira 202). These are reminiscent of the glandular form of clay sling bolt which was at home in early times in the Near East, and in Thessaly and Bulgaria (V.G. Childe, 'The Significance of the Sling for Greek Prehistory', in Studies Presented to D.M. Robinson i ( 1 95 1 ) 1-5). At Troy, however, clay bolts of this kind are only attested in the Late Subperiod of Troy VI ( Troy iii 3 1 , 232 f., fig. 305) . Lead bolts of glandular shape were standard in later Greek and Roman times. 52.

They may have been brought from some distance, as no caves with stalactites appear to be known in the area of Emporio today. Possibly they were acquired for religious or magical reasons.

METAL (PINS) 657 Pumice Two small lumps of pumice stone were noted in levels of Periods V and IV. An abundant deposit of pumice was revealed in a trial sounding at the head of the bay of Emporio. It lay just below the modern ground level, and the pumice had evidently been washed there by the sea. Coral A lump of pink coral (measuring 3.8 across) was recovered in a deposit, apparently assignable to Period I, in trench F of Area F.

The interesting object 17 which appears to be from a ring-pendant came from a level of Period IX. The tip of a blade (14) and a small lump of copper or bronze were found in one of VIII. The recovery of these small objects and scraps of metal from levels of Periods IX and VIII makes a welcome addition to the list of metal from early contexts in the Aegean.

EMPORIO working. Fragments of what may be crucibles (CLAY 8 and 9) were recovered from levels of Period II. But the mould (STONE 38) for flat axes assignable to Period IV shows that metal working was already practised at Emporio by that time. There is an interesting series of pins (1-4) from the horizon of Periods VI-IV. The needle (7), fish hook (11), and flat celt (13), are all characteristic artefacts of the Early Bronze Age in this part of the Aegean. The fragment of a Late Bronze Age ingot (18) is an unusual relic. Pins 1-6 (fig. 295. plate 138) Six complete pins were recovered and fragments of others. Four of the complete examples and several fragments came from levels of Periods VI- IV. Two of these from levels of Periods IV and V are of standard Aegean Early Bronze Age types; but the other two (3, 4) found close together in a level of V belong to an unusual type which appears to have few parallels. The roll-headed pin 5 of Period II is a common type with a wide distribution in time and place, while the pomegranate pin 6 of Mycenaean or perhaps earlier date is interesting for its relationship to a group with a long history and extensive connections. Type 1 Round, domed head, differentiated by a sharp angle from the shaft. This is a standard type in the Trojan area, with ancestors and relatives in the Near East. It appears to be very well represented in Troy II and in the Yellow period at Poliochni; but it is attested in the horizon of Troy I both at Poliochni and at Thermi. Pins of this type also occur on the Greek mainland where they are found in Middle Helladic contexts. Cf. Branigan, Aegean Metalwork 35 Type V. 1. (A,R 35, Period IV) (plate 138) Bent, but complete.

Pins with pomegranate heads abound in Cyprus from Middle Cypriot times onwards. Some were made of ivory, others of copper or bronze, and perhaps of gold (Jacobs thai, Greek Pins 38 f., 185 ff.). Bronze examples cited by Jacobsthal from Lapithos Tomb 406 are from a context of Cypriot Geometric I (SCE i pl. 46: 1 , nos. 15 b, 17 b, 1 01; pl. 153: 11). But two fine gold pins with pomegranate heads may be of Bronze Age date (Jacobsthal, Greek Pins, 39, citing J.L. Myres, Handbook of the Cesnola Collection (1914) 392 nos. 2522-3). Pomegranate heads merge into and are difficult to distinguish from the more common vase-shaped heads, and the Lapithos pins are classified as vase-headed by Catling, Cypriot Bronzework 239. The pin from Kaloriziki Tomb 26 (Late Cypriot III B) may also belong with this group (Catling, ibid. 239 pl. 41 : j). Vase-headed pins (Branigan, Aegean Metalwork 37 Type XI I la) have a long range in time and space (Jacobsthal, Greek Pins 160 ff.). During the Bronze Age at any rate pins with heads of this shape, like ones with pomegranate heads, seem to be more common in bone or ivory than in metal. The heads were not necessarily and in every case meant to represent vases; the earlier pin heads of this group are more elongated, less vase-like, than the later ones (e.g. Tarsus ii 314 pl. 438 nos. 50-1: E.B. II, both of bone). Gold pins with elaborate vase heads and spirals have been recovered at Troy in deposits of the final destruction of Troy II (Maxwell-Hyslop, Western Asiatic Jewellery 55. 7W355 fig. 292: b, c. 7/^488, 490 nos. 849, 850. Troy i 367 pls. 356, 357: 37.709). Simple vase-headed pins of copper or bronze include one from Troy ( Tul 355 fig- 292: a- SS 258 no. 6486, possibly of Troy II-V, but assigned by Jacobsthal, Greek Pins 161 , to Troy VII B); and one assignable to the E.B.A. from Syros (AE 1899, IO1 pi- I0: J4» found in Tomb 343 with a silver jug-headed pin, ibid. 101, 108, pl. 10: 10). There are two silver vase-headed pins from Early Cycladic cemeteries on Naxos (Doumas, Burial Habits pls. xlix: h, 1: d). Needle 7 (fig. 295. plate 138) The only needle recovered came from a deposit assignable to Period I, but with some intrusive later material. Its date is not therefore certain. 7. (F, D (west side) ?5 B, Period I (?)) (plate 138) L. 14.3. Circular section. Aegean needles during the earlier part of the Bronze Age were of three types (cf. Branigan, Aegean Metalwork 30) : ( 1 ) with the shaft split to form the eye some way below the head; (2) with the eye at the top made by bending the wire of the shaft back into a loop; and (3) with the eye in a flattened piece at the top (e.g. AE 1899 pl. 10: 22. Zervos, ACycl pl. 261, top left: Syros, Chalandriani). Our needle is of type ( 1 ), which is a good deal less common than type (2) in this part of the Aegean area. Thus the seven needles listed from Thermi are all of type (2) ( Thermi 167 f. fig. 48 b); while at Poliochni type (2) needles occurred in the Blue period, and throughout the Red and Green periods, those of type (1) being attested for the first time in the Yellow period (Poliochni i 595, 665; ii 297 pl. ccxxxviii: 25). But a type (1) needle was recovered from the Early Subperiod of Troy I, although other Trojan needles of this type came from later contexts ( Troy i 42 f., 86 fig. 215: 36.417 (Early Subperiod of Troy I); ii 1 1 f, 94 fig. 47: 37-758 (2 (?) from Troy III). Cf. Tul 407 fig. 412, apparently from Troy VII. SS 257 nos. 6465-73). Needles of type (1) occur on the Greek mainland (Dendra NT § f. fig. 6: 2, from the Acropolis of Midea. Athenian Agora xiii 196 pl. 42, Grave XI no. 6). They are also found in Crete alongside ones of type (2) (Gournia 34 pl. iv: 38, 39, both from Hill House 7. Cf. J. Boardman, The Cretan Collection in Oxford (Oxford, 1 961) 35 no. 153). None of the many needles from Alishar seems to be of type ( 1 ), but there are three of the type from Kusura B (Archaeologia lxxxvi ( 1 936) 39 fig. 18:3); and two from Aphrodisias (Complexes II and IX) (AJA lxxiii ( 1 969) 59, 62, 65 pl. 27 fig. 29). Needles in Egypt from Predynastic times onwards appear to correspond to type ( 1 ) (Pétrie, Tools and Weapons 53 pl. lxv). A variety of toggle-pin current in Syria, Palestine, and Cilicia, somewhat resembles a type ( 1 ) needle</page><page sequence="253">fig. 295. Metal objects (METAL 1- 17).

Top with a rather chisel-like end. Rectangular section. Awls are probably the most ancient metal tools. While they may have been primarily designed for working skins and leather, they were evidently put to many other uses. Awls of copper or bronze were current in most parts of the Near East throughout all periods of the Bronze Age, and are attested in South Russia and the Balkans (Lists in Deshayes, Les Outils i 39 ff.; ii 1 ff. pis i-ii. See especially Tarsus ii 282 f., 289 f., with a range from E.B. I-L.B. II. Archaeologia lxxxvi (1936) 41 fig. 18: 21-27; lxxxvii (1937) 258 fig. 21: 2-6: very numerous in Kusura B and C. Catling, Cypriot Bronzework 65, 97 f. Emery, Archaic Egypt 221 fig. 129: Dynasty I, with wooden handle). Not many are recorded from Troy ( Troy i-iv index s.v. awl or brad. Cf. ££251). But awls with a rectangular section like 8-10 were abundant at Poliochni in levels of the Blue period and later (Poliochni i 593 f. fig. 322 (with many references), 665 pls. lxxxviii, clxxvi). Two awls of the Blue period retained their original bone handles (ibid. pl. lxxxvi: b, c); and other bone handles might have belonged to awls (ibid. pl. clxxiv: a-c). Cf. Troy iii 29, 186 pl. 301: 37.425 (Middle Troy VI); iv 1 99 pl. 254: 37.494 (Troy VII B). A bronze awl with bone handle from Akrotiri on Thera must date from the early part of the Late Bronze Age (Thera vi (1974) 34 pl. 84, c). But awl handles may have normally been made of wood, as found in Egypt. Traces of a wooden handle survived with an awl in a Late Helladic tomb at Mycenae (Wace, Chamber Tombs 92) . Awls with silver handles were recovered from the royal tombs at Alaca (Alaca igßa, 61 pl. ccvii: 647-50; ^57-5^ 170 p1- cxcvii). The awls of the Blue period at Poliochni varied a good deal in size, ranging in length from c. 2 to 14. Some were circular in section at the working end (Poliochni i 595), and such awls appear to have been much in evidence at Thermi (Thermi 168 fig. 49, called 'bits and drills'). But the circular sections may be the effect of wear and successive sharpenings of awls which were originally rectangular in section. Fish-hooks 11-12 (fig. 295. plate 138) There were two possible fish-hooks of the simple type without a barb, cf. Branigan, Aegean Metalwork 29 Type I. But one of these (12) may be a bent awl. 11.

Simple copper fish-hooks of this type are found as early as the beginning of the Aeneolithic at Byblos (Byblos v 207 f. fig. 1 35), and the Protodynastic period in Egypt (Childe, New Light 53 fig. 20: 9. Cf. Pétrie, Tools and Weapons 37). But there is a barbed metal fish-hook from Predynastic Jemdet Nasr in Mesopotamia (Childe, New Light 135 fig. 67), and some barbed examples occur in Egypt during the Old Kingdom, although most Egyptian fish-hooks are still barbless (ibid. 90)-</page><page sequence="255">4.

Axe 13 (fig. 295. plate 138) The only example of an axe of copper or bronze came from a context of Period II. It corresponds most closely to Deshayes class 63 a, with a wide distribution including India, Mesopotamia, Syria-Palestine, Cyprus, Anatolia, and Greece, and a range in date from the third quarter of the third millennium until late in the second millennium B.C.

There is also one very similar from Aphrodisias Complex II {AJA lxxiii (1969) 57 pl. 24 fig. 10). Vrokastro 120 fig. 70 D, from the town, described as a 'bronze wedge', looks much like 1 3, and might be Middle Minoan or earlier rather than Geometric. Catling, Cypriot Bronzework 63 f., 85 f., 290 (Late Cypriot hoards !). Our axe seems to correspond to Catling's class (c) with a range from Early into Late Cypriot. Adze-like blades appear to be considerably less common than axe blades in Cyprus (ibid. 64, 86 f.). This type of thin flat celt had a wide distribution in the Near East from Early Dynastic to Sargonid times (e.g. Chagar Bazar: Iraq'w (1937) 135 fig. 13- 1. Brak: Iraq ix (1947) 169 pl. xxxi: 9. Gawra i 108 pl. xlviii: 8 (Level VI) closely resembles 13). It is also found in the Balkans; some of the many flat axes from Bulgaria appear to be of this type (e.g. Gaul, Neolithic Bulgaria 82, 123, 139, 154, 175 pl. xxxiv: 11; 151 pl. xxxiv: 10; 193). Knives 14-16 (fig. 295. plates 138, 139) The tip of a knife or dagger blade (14) was recovered from a level of Period VIII. The complete single-edged knife 16 comes from a Mycenaean deposit.</page><page sequence="256">664 III. EMPORIO 14. (A, G 141, Period VIII) (plate 138) Tip of blade. L. preserved 0.7. W. 0.4.

This corresponds to Sandar's basic type 1 a, with a range in Crete from Middle Minoan times until the end of the Bronze Age or later (PPS xxi (1955) 174 ff.). But Deshayes, Les Outils i 313 ff., thinks that knives like 16 (his type K) do not in fact occur in Crete as early as the Middle Minoan period, and suggests that the type originated in the Argolid on the Greek mainland. Our 1 6 seems to belong to his subtype K 1 a, with flanges on the hilt, which is very common in the Aegean, being attested in the Mycenae shaft graves, and occurring in Crete at least as early as Late Minoan I B. It was current until the end of the Bronze Age or later. Our knife resembles one from Punta del Tonno (Tarentum) (Deshayes, Les Outils i 314; ii 130 pl. xlii: 6. Notizie degli Scavi 1900, 464 fig. 22). Miscellaneous 17-19 (fig. 295. plates 138, 139) The small ring 1 7 which appears to be part of a ring-pendant is of great interest, coming as it does from a level of Period IX. The fragment 18 from a Mycenaean level is from an ingot, probably of 'ox-hide' shape. 17. (A, Q, 1 56, Period IX) (plate i 39) Ring pendant (?) . The ring had an attachment of some kind, doubtless a loop for suspension, which has broken away. Diam. 2.4. Th. 0.5. Presumably copper. Roughly formed; uncertain whether shaped by hammering or cast; the hole somewhat rectangular. Ring-pendants have a long history in the Near East. They are also found in Anatolia and the Aegean, and across Europe as far as the British Isles. The objects classifiable as ring-pendants in the early Near East may not all have had the same intention. Some in Anatolia at any rate appear to have been used as belt hooks, while others are found incorporated in necklaces or bracelets as beads; some may derive from pendants representing stylised 'Eye Goddesses' as found at Byblos (Byblos v 323 f. fig. 197 pl. clxii, Late Aeneolithic; but these have a very small central hole and a pair of 'eyes' in place of a single string-hole above). Large ring-pendants are worn as the central ornaments in necklaces by figures in the Mari frescoes; this suggests that they were talismans or charms of some kind. Mesopotamia: one of stone from Arpachiyah is assignable to the Halaf period (Iraq ii (1935) pl. vii (b): 889). It was compared by Dikaios with primitive varieties of ring-pendants from Khirokitia in Cyprus (Khirokitia 303 type XIII pls. c, cxli) . A small copper ring from Stratum XVII of the Ubaid period at Gawra looks remarkably similar in size and appearance to our 1 7; but it does not appear to be a broken ring-pendant, and any resemblance may be fortuitous (Gawra ii 213 pl. xcviii, a: 5). But ring-pendants of various materials - paste, mother-of-pearl, and gold - come from Gawra Strata XII-X (Gawra ii 195 pl. clxxiii: 41, 42 (Strata XII and XI); 89 pl. cvii: 49 (Stratum X ?). Cf. Childe, New Light 121, 209): the ninety gold ones found with a burial had evidently formed part of a bracelet (Gawra ii 89) . Gold ring-pendants incorporated in a neck lace from Brak are dated to the end of Sargonid or beginning of Ur III times (Iraq ix (1947) 1 77 f. pl. xxxv. Maxwell-Hyslop, Western Asiatic Jewellery 29 pl. 27). A stone ring-pendant from Judeideh is assigned to Phase F, which appears to overlap with a late phase of Uruk in southern Mesopotamia (Judeideh 252 fig. 190: 9). Anatolia: a. bone object of somewhat comparable shape from Çatal Hüyük is thought to have been a belt-fastener used in conjunction with bone hooks (Mellaart, Çatal Hüyük 156 pl. xv). A similar but cruder object from Hacilar is interpreted in the same way (Hacilar i 1 63; ii 467 fig. 1 85: 4, from Hacilar VI) . Objects with several rings, all of the same size, from Çatal Hüyük are also called belt-fasteners (Mellaart, Çatal Hüyük fig. 102). A bone object with a couple of equal-sized rings was recovered from the E.B. II horizon at Tarsus ( Tarsus ii 31 7 pl. 440: 107, 108). There are some elaborate pendants with knobbed rings from the royal tombs at Alaca (Alaca 1937-39 pls. ccvi, ccvii). A simple ivory ring-pendant from Alishar assigned to the Early Bronze Age is described as an 'implement suitable in form but scarcely strong enough for drawing a bowstring' (Alishar 1930-32 i 270 fig. 272: c. 2 141). A lead object from the Late Chalcolithic level VII e of the Pekmez site at Aphrodisias is grouped with ring-pendants by K. Branigan, Antichita Cretesi: studi in onore di Doro Levi i (Catania, 1977) 98 no. 9 (wrongly assigned to E.B. 2); but this seems to have no suspension hole, and it is described in the report as 'a small broken lead figurine (?)' (AJA lxxv ( 1971) 127, 131 ill. 8: 1550. 1). The lead object from Poliochni similarly grouped with ring-pendants by Branigan, ibid. 98 no. 10, may be a spindle whorl (Poliochni i 659 pl. clxxvii: 28). Aegean: a typical stone ring-pendant was found at Troy, and was assigned by Schliemann to his 'Third, Burnt</page><page sequence="257">4.

More interesting for comparison with 1 7 are a couple of ring-pendants from Poliochni, one of silver and the other of bronze, both apparently of the Red period (Poliochni i 376, 659 pls. clxx no. 3, clxxvii no. 25; 434, 663 pl. clxxvii no. 28). Thermi pl. xvii: a shows what looks very much like a deliberate representation of a ring-pendant in relief on a fragment of a clay vase. There is a stone ring-pendant from what appears to be a Late Neolithic context in the Kitsos cave on the Greek mainland (AAA vii (1974) 9 fig. 3. BCH xcviii (1974) 744, 746 fig. 19: a). A fine silver example from the Alepotrypa (Diros) cave in the Mani may also date from the Late Neolithic (AA 1971, 352, 359 fig. 53). Ring-pendants are similarly attested in the Late Neolithic of Thessaly; one of light green schist from Dhimini was thought by Tsountas to be a stone version of the gold object from Sesklo assigned to the Dhimini horizon there (DS 337 pl. 43: 8, 350 f. fig. 291 ); Tsountas noted that this gold ring-pendant was the only metal object which he found certainly dating from the Neolithic. There is also a clay ring-pendant from the Rakhmani horizon at Pevkakia (BCH xcvi (1972) 718 fig. 305) . Much later in date and of quite a different type are the amber ring-pendants from Kakovatos Tholos A (AM xxxiv (1909) 279 f. pl. xv: 22). Four ring-pendants of bronze plated with gold and one of stone were recovered from the Ayios Onouphrios deposit near Phaistos in Crete, and are assignable to Early Minoan or the beginning of Middle Minoan times (K. Branigan, Antichità Cretesi: studi in onore di Doro Levi i (Catania, 1977) 98 f. Cf. Aegean Metalwork 194 Nos. 3141-4. AJ. Evans, Cretan Pictographs and Prae-Phoenician Script (London, 1895) 109 f. figs. 95, 96, 96 bis. O. Montelius, La Grece préclassique (Stockholm, 1924) 22 f. figs. 81, 87). To the same early horizon belongs a remarkable silver pendant from a burial cave opposite the Cave of Eileithyia near Amnisos (S. Marinatos, PAE 1 930, 98 fig. 9) . This has a very small hole in the centre, and 'breasts' in repoussé; it has been compared with the series of gold ring-pendants from Hungary and Romania, assignable it seems to the Bodrogkeresztur and Cucuteni A-B horizon, and evidently versions of female idols (V. Milojcic, Germania xxxi (1953) 8). In three instances these Balkan 'idols' have been found in the graves of women, twice being worn in pairs on the head (H. Dumitrescu, Dacia v (1961) 69-93). For these and other types of ring-pendants see now J. Makkay, Acta Archaeologica xxviii (1976) 251-300. Bone ring-pendants have been found in Bulgaria (Gaul, Neolithic Bulgaria 142 pl. xxxv: 6, 7, 11, from Denev, assigned to the Mound Culture i.e. Maritsa or GumelniÇa horizon). Ring-pendants from other parts of Europe have been collected by R.A. Maier, BRGKxiii ( 1961 ) 260 ff. fig. 4, 305 fig. 1 1: Ringscheiben. Gimbutas, Bronze Age Cultures 35 ff. figs. 5-9 pls. 5, 6. Cf. Childe, Dawn 44, 91 fig. 47, 98, 194, 198. Some from South Russia are made of copper (e.g. Gimbutas, Prehistory 68 fig. 38: 5. Sulimirski, Prehistoric Russia 235 fig. 58). For examples from the British Isles assignable to the Early Bronze Age there, e.g. Archaeologia lxxxvi (1935) 206 pl. 64: 5, 6. PPSiv (1938) 83 f., 74 fig. 12: 3; xxii (1956) pl. 5: 14. 18. (F, B 2, stage 7, Mycenaean) (plate 139) Fragment of ingot, measuring 6 x 6 x 4-4.5 thick. The edges irregular, broken; the upper and lower surfaces roughly flattened.

This may be fortuitous, in view of the limited character of pure deposits of I, but it could reflect the increasing use of metal for tools at the time. Bone objects are divided into (A) End tools (types 1-11), and (B) Awls, pins, needles, and ?idols (types 12-30).</page><page sequence="258">fig. 296. Tools and other objects of bone. 666 IH.

Small bone awl, with a sharp point at each end Bone awls of this type appear to have been cheap substitutes for metal ones like METAL 8-10. One doubtful example (32) was recovered at Emporio, and such awls were never really popular at Thermi, while only two are recorded from the latest excavations at Troy. But bone instruments of this shape seem to have been relatively common at Poliochni. It must be remembered, however, that arrowheads consisting of a bone pointed at each end were in use during the Bronze Age and later in parts of the Near East (e.g. Alishar 1930-32 ii fig. 270, Hittite period). 32. {A, R 26, Period IV) Broken short at one end.

For others see SS nos. 7845-7866; Ilios 430 f. nos. 562-4, 572) . An embryo pin of this type was found in a level of Town I at Thermi; but in general such pins do not appear to be common there before the horizon of Towns IV-V {Thermi 201 pl. xxvii: 11; 199 f. type 11). Rib-headed bone pins are attested in Thessaly {PThess 191 fig. 139: p (Lianokladhi II)). In southern Greece they are standard during the Middle Helladic period and continue into Mycenaean times {Asine 255 fig. 180: 12 (M.H.). Eutresis 213 fig. 284: 9, io (M.H.).

Eastwards rib-headed pins seem to appear earlier. A number were recovered from levels of Periods G and H at Judeideh {Judeideh 338 fig. 256: 8, 9; pl. 74: 13, 14; 391 fig. 299: 4 pl. 74: 4). There are two atypical heads from Early Bronze II levels at Tarsus, but one of orthodox type comes from a Late Bronze Age deposit there ( Tarsus ii 314 fig. 438 nos. 54, 55 (E.B. II), no. 63 (L.B.)). Bone pins with segmented heads are found in the earliest Bronze Age of Central Europe (e.g. Gimbutas, Bronze Age Cultures 39 fig. 10: 20, 23, from an early Unitice cemetery near Nitra in Slovakia, along with 'needles' of type 16 and segmented and other faience beads). Type 16. 'Needle', with wide flat perforated head These objects, resembling pins of type 14, but with a perforation through the head, were classified at Troy and Thermi as needles, and may have been used as such. They were probably the bone equivalents of, if not the prototypes for, metal needles of type 3 (see under METAL 7, e.g. Zervos, ACyclpl. 261, top left).

The type is also attested from the Macedonian Late Neolithic {PMac 165 fig. 35: b, pl. x, from Servia), and occurs in Thessaly {PThess 125 fig. 68: n, from Tsangli). One from Corinth was assigned to the Neolithic there (Walker Kosmopoulos, Corinth 45 fig. 1 7 (Period II)). There are others from Neolithic Khirokitia and from Early Bronze Age Tarsus {Khirokitia 294 pls. xciii, cxl: 41 1, 413, 1029. Tarsus '' 315 pl. 438: 69-71 (E.B. II)). Afew were found at Judeideh in deposits of the Second Mixed Range and Phase G {Judeideh 328 fig. 256: 12, pl. 74: 10, 16). There are some from levels of all periods at Alishar {Alishar ig28-2g ii 83 fig. 129: a 1 134 (broken) (Stratum V); I93°-32i9I %• 94 (three) (Chalcolithic); 193 fig. 194: d 2148 (Copper Age); 270 fig. 272: e 2200 (E.B.

The type occurs in Central Europe from the Neolithic into the Bronze Age (e.g. Berciu, Contributii figs. 167: 15, 198: 1 (Gumelnija I a). Gimbutas, Bronze Age Cultures 40 fig. 10: 18, 19 (Nitra, E.B.A.)). Type iy. Leg bone of small animal with the joint used as a head and perforated There were only two bone objects that could be assigned to this type. The hole through the joint seemed to have been deliberately made in each case. But only the perforated joint has survived in the case of 38 from a level of Period IX. Thus it could have been when complete, not an implement, but an object like the small bones from Troy I which appear to have formed part of a necklace or some other ornament {Troy i 102 fig. 215: 35.80 etc.). 38. {A, G 154, Period IX) (plate 141) Broken.

Flat spoon-like objects or spatulas of one kind or another have a very wide distribution both in time and place in the Aegean area, ranging from the earliest Neolithic at Knossos (BSA lxiii ( 1 968) 2 7 1 ) to the Late Bronze Age at Troy ( Troy i 48, 123 fig. 220: 37.375 (Early Subperiod of Troy I); Troy in 29, 264, 272 fig. 301: 36.138, 36.41 (Late Troy VI)). The two examples from Emporio are most closely comparable with some of those from Troy and ones from neighbouring Thermi (Thermi 200 type 13, pl. xxvii: 14, 15, from Towns III-IV). There is what looks like a</page><page sequence="266">674 III. EMPORIO similar spatula from Vardaroftsa assigned to the Macedonian Early Bronze Age (PMac 202 fig. 66: i). Miss Olga Krzyszkowska has pointed out that these spatulas are in fact scapulae from pigs which required little or no modification to adapt them for use as spoons or scrapers. They are therefore very different from the spatulas described below which are elaborately worked with well-differentiated flat or spoon-like heads. The spatulas of this kind from Neolithic Knossos are virtually flat with broad heads, like one from the Late Neolithic at Sesklo in Thessaly (BSA lix (1964) 236 fig. 55 pl. 60 (3). Cf. DS 357 pl. 46: 8). At Knossos at any rate, and in the Balkans (Childe, Dawn 85), it seems possible that such bone spatulas were used for scraping flour from querns after it had been ground. But some of the examples from Thessaly are distinctly spoon-like (e.g. PThess 42 fig. 271g, from Rakhmani; this appears to have an animal's head on the handle like some from Hacilar VI (Hacilar ii fig. 180)). For bone spatulas from Anatolia, e.g. Kusura: Archaeologia lxxxvi (1936) 54 type 18, fig. 24: 31 (Period A). Aphrodisias: AJA lxxv (1971) 140 (Late Chalcolithic).

Maier, BRGK xiii (1961) 183 ff., 273 ff., 300 fig. 6 pls. 38, 39. Homolka pl. 1: n). Ones with large perforations very similar in appearance to 53 from Middle Neolithic levels at Knossos are thought to have been used as whistles (BSA lix (1964) 236 pl. 60 (4): 2, 3).

Similar objects were found at Poliochni, where they were interpreted as pommels on the ground that they were too light for use as whorls. They occurred there alongside bone whorls of hemispherical shape. Bone whorls of both the truncated conical and the hemispherical shape were also found together at Sesklo in Thessaly and at Zygouries. Hemispherical whorls made from femur heads, apparently of humans, were recovered in early levels at Alishar and were thought to have been used as charms (Alishar ig28-2g i 179 fig. 232: b 722 (Stratum II ?). Cf. ibid. 1930-32 i 91 fig. 94, and one from Aphrodisias [AJA lxxv (1971) 128, 125 ill. 4), which are Chalcolithic. Three bone spindle-whorls made from the heads of femurs of large herbivores from the Kitsos cave in Attica are presumably Late Neolithic (BCH xcviii (1974) 744). One made from the caput of the femur of a bovid and interpreted as a loomweight was recovered from Anzabegovo in Jugoslav Macedonia (Anza 190 f. fig. 123, Anza IV).

Shell 57-65 (figs. 298-9. plate 142) The pestle 57 and the winged or phallic pendant 58 made from Spondylus are the most interesting of the few shell objects recovered at Emporio. Spondylus shell with conveniently thick patches was used as an alternative to fine stone or ivory in early times in the Aegean. Besides beads, amulets and pestles, objects made from it included inlays and seals (e.g. Poliochni i 602 pl. lxxxvi: g (Blue period)). /. Pestle 57. (F, B 12, stage 2, Period II: early phase (?))

They are very well represented in deposits of the Early Bronze Age on the Greek mainland and are found in contexts of that period in the Cyclades and other islands of the Aegean, but are curiously rare in Crete. One, however, from the Trapeza burial cave in Crete appears to be made of Spondylus shell like 57. While these pestles are most at home in the Early Bronze Age, some have been recovered from Late Neolithic and others from Middle and Late Helladic contexts on the mainland.

Beads or pendants of this winged or phallic type have a wide distribution (e.g. Childe, Dawn 54, 1 56, 254, 297) . There are several from Cycladic tombs assigned to the Early Bronze Age (Renfrew, Emergence 161. AE 1898, 161 pl. 8: 37, 38 (Antiparos, Tomb 1 15); 165 pl. 8: 28 (Despotikon, Tomb 135); cf. 159 pl. 8: 44, 45 (Paros, Tomb 102). These are made of stone, but shell ornaments occur in the same horizon (e.g. AE 1 898, 1 60 pl. 8: 18, 19). One from the Kitsos cave appears to come from a Late Neolithic context (AAA vii (1974) 1 1, 9 fig. 3. BCH xcviii (1974) 746 fig. 19: c). A stone object resembling 58 was found at Gawra (Gawra ii pl. xcii: 6, of grey marble, from the dump, unstratified). Winged or phallic pendants in South Russia are thought to have been copied from Early Cycladic ones, but are made of copper or amber (Gimbutas, Prehistory 89 fig. 50) . Similarly shaped objects occur westwards in Malta, Liguria, and the south of France (Arene Candide i 236, 241 fig. 69, assigned to the horizon of the Lagozza Culture. Childe, Dawn 297 fig. 143: j, n. Préhistoire française ii 262 fig. 4: 19-20; 272 fig. 3: 7; 285 fig. 3: 27; 287 fig. 4: 22). Little bone and ivory amulets of Upper Palaeolithic date in stylized female shapes might be remote ancestors of European versions of these pendants (Archeocivilisation v (1968) 14, 16 fig. 7). The twin bone pendants found with Natufian burials in Palestine could also be related to them (PBA xliii ( 1 957) 22 1 pls. iv, vi) .

Judeideh 342 fig. 258: 2 pl. 78: 3 (Phase G), of faience, resembles ours in shape. 5. Shells with a single perforation for suspension as weights , pendants or beads The single heavy oyster shell 64 might have been used as a loomweight rather than a pendant. But a number of limpets (62, 63), mostly from levels of IX-VIII, were evidently beads. Felsch notes bored shell pendants as characteristic of the earliest phase of occupation revealed by the new excavations at Tigani (Samos xiv 130). An isolated Cardium shell perforated as a bead (65) came from a level that appeared to be assignable to IV. 62. (A, G 154, Period IX) (plate 142) Limpet shells (Patellae), about 30 in number, varying in size from 1.2-4. 1 across, with the tops perforated for use as beads. Cf. Phylakopi 201 pl. xxxix: 10, but the perforation here is larger. 63. (A, H 26, Period IV) (plate 142) Limpet shell bead as 62, but perforated through the side instead of the top. 64.

Perforated, apparently for use as a weight, perhaps a loomweight. Clay loomweights are not attested before Period VI at Emporio, and then only by a single example (CLAY 26). But clay weights which first appear in the Middle Neolithic (Stratum III) at Knossos are likely to have been loomweights like some from the Middle Neolithic horizon in the Franchthi Cave (BSA lix ( 1 964) 233. Hesperia xlii (1973) 277). The existence of an upright loom requiring weights for the warp threads by Periods VII/VI or even VIII at Emporio is therefore not impossible. 65.

Amber 66 (figs 299, 306, 307. plate 142) Three fragments of amber were recovered from the same Mycenaean deposit. Professor Curt W. Beck and Christopher A. Shustak kindly examined these, and their report appears as Appendix A at the end of this volume. They have established that the fragments (a) and (b) come from two different objects, and have suggested the possibility that (a) with traces of a perforation might have been one end of a rectangular spacer, while (b) could have been part of a large disc bead. The amber is certainly Baltic. 66. (F, D 1 (B 2), stage 7, Mycenaean) (Plate 142) Three fragments: (a) 1.3 x 1 , flat on one side, humped on the other; (b) 1.5 x 1; (c) scrap. IV. Faience 67-68 (figs. 298-9. plate 142) The only objects of faience were a couple of beads, one (67) from a level of Period I, the other (68) apparently Mycenaean; both seem to be imports. 67.

Persson, The Royal Tombs at Dendra near Midea (Lund etc., 1931 ) 30 no. 23).

THE ANIMAL BONES (Juliet Clutton-Brock) (figs. 300-1. plates 143-4) The work for this report was carried out under the supervision of the late Professor F. E. Zeuner, and it was included as part of a thesis submitted for the degree of Ph.D. (Clutton-Brock, 1962). The present account was prepared for publication in 1966. My thanks are due to the Committee of the British School of Archaeology at Athens who arranged for the transport and loan of the animal remains from Emporio to the Institute of Archaeology of the University of London.

The Neolithic and Bronze Age site of Emporio on the island of Chios was continuously occupied for several thousand years and a complex sequence of deposits was built up during this time. The animal remains have been studied in relation to this sequence of levels. The main part of the prehistoric excavations took place in a large series of trenches which were labelled Area A. The pottery from here reflected occupation from an apparently early phase of the Aegean Neolithic until a horizon in the Early Bronze Age around 2000 b.c. Other trenches which were less extensive and which produced fewer animal bones were in Areas B, C and D. The material from Area B was Early Bronze Age ranging from c. 3000-2000 b.c. Area D contained Late Bronze Age material, mostly assignable to Mycenaean III C, datable c. 1 200 b.c. The Neolithic and Early Bronze Age series was divided into ten periods, the dating being based on the pottery sequence and correlated with the change in levels. These ten periods are shown on the chart (fig. 300) under Area A. Each animal bone was labelled according to the trench and period from which it came. Approximately one-third of the animal remains were excavated from levels of Period II in Area A; this consisted of piles of rubbish that had been dumped as a fill behind a terrace wall. The absolute numbers of the animal remains increase greatly in the later levels, but the overall pattern of the faunal assemblage remained the same throughout all periods of the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. This is to be expected as the way of life of the people did not change; in fact, goats are still the principal source of meat on the island at the present day. The almost complete absence of donkey from the prehistoric excavations is of interest. There is only one bone that can be identified as donkey; this came from the last phase of the Early Bronze Age period, that is from the well of Period I in Area A assignable to the time of Troy II c. 2000 b.c. There were surprisingly few fish bones recovered from the excavations, considering that the site is so near the sea, but perhaps this is because they had disintegrated in the soil. The ten species of mammal identified from the prehistoric levels of the excavations at Emporio are listed below: ORDER CARNIVORA ORDER ARTIODACTYLA Vulpes vulpes L. Domestic pig Domestic dog Dama dama L. Ur sus arc tos L. Domestic cattle Fe lis sp. Domestic goats ORDER PERISSODACTYLA Domestic sheep Domestic donkey The remains of goat were the most numerous, making up approximately 40 per cent of the whole collection. The remains of domesticated cattle were the next numerous, followed by pig. Fallow deer {Dama dama), presumed to be wild, are present as approximately 10 per cent of all the animal remains, and a few bones and horn cores of sheep have been identified. These five species comprise the principal food animals, and their percentage frequency and actual numbers of bones and teeth found in levels of each period are shown in the chart (fig. 300).</page><page sequence="273">5. ANIMAL BONES 681 Order Carnivora Vulpes vulpes L. One fragment of a right horizontal ramus has been identified as belonging to a fox. It is assumed to be the common red fox of Europe and Asia. The three premolars and the first molar are present in the jaw. The teeth are worn. The mandible fragment comes from Area B. The remains of foxes are commonly found in prehistoric middens; presumably the animals were killed when found scavenging in or near the village. Domestic dog Twenty-two mandibles, eleven maxillae, and some skull fragments and skeletal bones were found throughout all levels of the Neolithic and Bronze Age. A total number of thirteen individuals is represented by left mandibular rami. There are no very old animals; the majority of the jaws being from adult animals whose teeth were not very much worn, but there are also three puppies that have no permanent teeth. The dogs were all small animals comparable in size to a present-day terrier. This collection of dog remains shows a feature that is commonly found in domestic dogs, namely that there is a marked variability in the size of the teeth relative to the length of the jaw. Although showing this variability the adult dogs are all approximately the same size. Presumably breeding was at random amongst such a dog population, and the size and degree of crowding of the teeth must be a natural variation that is probably augmented by the effects of domestication. Measurements from two extreme variants are given below: Length of the tooth row, together with the actual lengths of each tooth, of two mandibles, to show the variation in size and degree of crowding of the teeth Type I Type II (mm.) (mm.) Length of tooth row from the anterior edge of P2 58.50 62.05 to the posterior edge of M3 Depth of mandible below P4 18 approx. 19.7 approx.

If the added lengths of the teeth P2 - M3 are expressed as a percentage of the directly measured length of the tooth row, from the anterior edge of P2 to the posterior edge of M3, then this index can be used to show the degree of crowding of the teeth. It was not possible to measure the entire tooth row because none of the mandibles was complete. In the mandible of Type I, whose tooth measurements are given above, where the tooth row is short and the teeth large, the index is 102.8 per cent, whereas in the second type, where the tooth row is absolutely longer, and the teeth smaller, this index is 72.6 per cent. In the material from Emporio, the second type of jaw - that is, with small, widely-spaced teeth - is more common than the first type, only two mandibles from a total of nine having large compacted teeth.</page><page sequence="274">682 III. EMPORIO The only limb bones of dogs from Emporio that are well preserved are the humeri. The medio-lateral widths of the distal epiphyses of these bones are given below: Width of distal Area Period epiphyses (mm.) A X Left humérus 26.20 A VIII Left humérus 26.20 A V/IV Left humérus 29.10 A II Left humérus 28.05 C. 1 V-II Right humérus 23.15 These measurements show that the dogs represented were rather larger than an English fox terrier. The widths of the distal epiphyses of humeri of two fox terriers from the British Museum (Natural History) are 20.15 mm. and 20.50 mm. Ursus arc tos L. The proximal end of the left radius of a brown bear, Ursus arctos (plate 144 (a)), was found in Area A in an early level of Period X. The break in the shaft of the bone is an old one and the staining of the bone is identical on the shaft and round the break. The bone is also slightly polished, so it is conceivable that this fragment is part of some imported artifact or talisman. Bears are not found at the present day on Chios, and the island is so small that this animal could not have survived long once the island was heavily populated by man. Felis sp. The few remains of cat from the Bronze Age levels have no diagnostic features that enable them to be distinguished as wild or domesticated. Only three bones were found, one distal end of a tibia, the distal end of a humérus, and a radius. These bones are from different animals as they were all in separate levels. The tibia is charred and blackened. It was found in the debris of a fortification wall. The European wild cat is found in Greece today (Ellerman &amp; Morrison-Scott, 1951), and it is probable that this species was living on Chios in prehistoric times. Order Perissodactyla Domestic donkey One proximal end of a right metacarpal bone of an ass was found amongst the animal remains excavated from the well in Area A assignable to Period I (the horizon of Troy II, c. 2000 b.c.). The complete absence of ass bones from all the earlier deposits is surprising, for it is to be expected that the ass was a common draught animal in Bronze Age Greece. Probably asses were not eaten, however, and therefore when an animal died its carcass was no doubt left on a hillside, so its bones would not be incorporated in the food remains of the village. Order Artiodactyla Domestic pig The bones and teeth of pig were found in nearly all levels, but they become more frequent in Area A after Period VI, that is in the time of Troy I. A total number of six bones and one tooth came from levels earlier than Period VI, and in levels of Periods VI-I in Area A there was a total</page><page sequence="275">5. ANIMAL BONES 683 number of 234 bones and 55 teeth. Whether this actually reflects a change in the economy of the people such that they depended more on pig meat in the later periods is difficult to decide, because fewer animal bones of all species were found in the earlier levels covering periods X-VII (see chart, fig. 300). The majority of pig remains consist of skull and jaw fragments, whereas in other species of food animals the most frequent bones are foot bones, metapodials, and the tough ends of long bones such as the tibiae and humeri. This is partly accounted for by the fact that the cranium of the pig is made up of very thick bones, quite different from the much thinner crania of sheep, goats, and deer. The pig skulls from Emporio have all been chopped through the parietal bone, presumably for extraction of the brain. The cuts are most often through the nuchal crest and occipital bone and forwards through or near the parietal suture, so that the skull is bisected. Some of the skulls have been cut through the fronto-parietal sutures. Thirty-five occipital portions of skulls were found. None of the cranial bones is from an adult animal, and some are from very young pigs. No measurements are, therefore, given of these crania, because they give no clear indication of the size of the animal when adult. Eighteen of these fragments are from Period V, that is from house floors and deposits of rubbish assignable to an early phase of Troy I. A total number of 25 left and 28 right maxillae of pigs were found. Three of these are from animals of less than six months of age; 2 1 are from animals of less than twenty months, and 19 are from animals of two years or more. The remaining 10 maxillae are too fragmentary to age. The age of animals at death was determined from the eruption of the teeth (following Brown, 1949; Sisson, 1930). The mandible of the pig is a heavy bone and the two halves become anchylosed at the median suture very soon after birth. Forty left mandibular rami, 37 right mandibular rami and 8 symphysal parts were found in the Neolithic and Bronze Age levels. Twenty-six of these mandibles are from animals of less than six months, 22 from animals of less than twenty months, and 29 are from animals of more than two years. Three of the mandibles are too fragmentary to assess their age. Three pairs of complete tusks from male animals were found in Area A assignable to Periods V-IV (Troy I); two other tusks came from levels of this horizon, and 1 2 other fragments of tusk from all other levels. The complete tusks from levels of IV might represent stores of tusks lost when fire destroyed houses at the end ofthat period. None of the tusks or fragments shows signs of human workmanship except for one small (recently broken) tip of a small female tusk which is very highly polished. This could have come from a necklace. Altogether a total of 79 isolated tusks and teeth have been recorded. The lengths, widths, and percentage ratios of the upper and lower third molars are given in the table below. These measurements may be compared with those of Miller ( 1 9 1 2, p. 96 1 ) for the European wild boar, Sus scrofa scrofa. It can be seen that the pig teeth from Emporio are considerably smaller than those of the wild boar. Skeletal bones of pig Large numbers of the pig bones are from immature animals, and they have lost their epiphyses. The bones from adult animals, however, show that the pigs were very small. The bones that are more or less complete are listed below, and of these, measurements for the humeri and tibae are separately tabulated.</page><page sequence="276">table i .

A total number of 41 metapodials were found - 15 of these are without distal epiphyses; 4 phalanges, and 1 hoof core. On the floor of House VIII in Area A, destroyed by fire at the end of Period IV, the bones of three pig feet were found, under fragments of a pithos. They lay near a hearth and were presumably in a cooking pot when the house was burnt down. The bones are from a young adult pig, for the epiphyses of the metapodials are not fused with the shafts. (The trotters of this small 'unimproved' breed of pig could hardly have been a delicacy.) The herds of pigs kept by the prehistoric inhabitants of Chios were probably half wild and survived on very little food. This would explain the very small size of the bone remains. McMeekan (1940) has shown that the food intake of pigs is directly related to their growth and that pigs reared on insufficient food are very much smaller than control animals reared on a properly balanced diet. Dama dama L. The deer remains from Emporio have all been identified as fallow deer. There are two living species within the genus Dama. These are, Dama dama L. and D. mesopotamica Brooke, 1875. It was believed until recently that D. mesopotamica had become extinct, but it has now been rediscovered in the Near East (Haltenorth, 1961). The two species can be identified from differences in the shape of antlers, but in all other respects their skeletons cannot be distinguished from each other. In D. dama, whose range covers Western and Central Europe and the Mediterranean countries at the present day, the antlers have the brow tine and the trez tine separated by a long, curved beam with a circular cross-section. (There is no bez tine in the fallow deer.) Above the trez tine the beam is palmated. In D. mesopotamica the beam is flattened from immediately above the brow tine; this flattening then merging with the palmation of the extremity of the antlers. The type locality of this species is in Persia. Antlers of D. mesopotamica have been identified from the Neolithic sites of Khirokitia and Erimi in Cyprus (King, 1954), from the Bronze Age site of Myrtou-Pigadhes on Cyprus (Zeuner, 1957), and from Mount Carmel (Bate, 1937). All the identifiable antler fragments from</page><page sequence="278">table 4. Description of the antler fragments with measurements 686 III. EMPORIO Emporio, however, belong to D. dama, and as it is not possible to distinguish the species except from the antlers, all the deer remains have been ascribed to this species. Several of the antler fragments have been used as picks that were apparently discarded after they had broken (plate 143 (a)). A description of the antlers with measurements is given in table 4. Description Area Period (measurements in mm) A II The most complete piece of antler, with the pedicel, brow tine, and part of the beam. Medio-lateral width of burr = 46 approx. Anterior-posterior depth of burr = 49 approx. This is not a shed antler but has been cut off the skull. It has been used as a pick (plate 143 (a): A). II A piece of cast antler which has been made into a pick, for the end of the brow tine is worn. The burr, brow tine, and part of the beam is present (plate 143 (a): B). Width of burr = 47 approx. Depth of burr = 50 approx. II Fragment of antler. II 5 fragments of small tines. II Part of a pedicel and burr. The burr has been cut round and this antler must have been intended for an artifact. IV Charred antler fragments that were found in the clay-lined bin in the north-western corner of House IV, destroyed by fire at the end of Period IV. Presumably this was a store of antler intended for picks and other artifacts. Width of the burr of one antler = 40 approx. IV Part of the beam of an antler with a small tine. The beam has been cut off from the rest of the antler at its lower end. Possibly this is the discarded upper end of an antler pick. V The largest antler. Probably used as a pick. The burr and the brow tine are present. Width of burr = 52 approx. Depth of burr = 59 approx. IX A fragment of a tine with a much worn tip. Probably this is a brow tine which broke off from the beam after it had been used as a pick. B II The same as the above, but the tip has been freshly broken. II The same as the above. It is probable that antler picks were the main digging tools of the Bronze Age people on Chios as they were for prehistoric people all over Europe. These picks are, in fact, extraordinarily efficient and very tough, as has been shown by their use in digging part of the experimental earthwork constructed on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire (Jewell, 1961). The race of fallow deer that is represented by the teeth and bones from Emporio comprised rather small animals, and this means that their size range overlaps that of the bones of goat and sheep from the site. It is difficult to distinguish fragments of the bones of goat, sheep, and deer when the species overlap in size. Limb bones that can be immediately recognized as belonging to Dama species are the metatarsals and the proximal ends of the metacarpals. Measurements of metapodial bones from Emporio that can be identified as belonging to D. dama are given in Tables 6 and 7, together with similar measurements from Recent specimens in the British Museum (Natural History).</page><page sequence="279">table 5.

Asia Minor 21.40 27.55 29.30 It can be seen from these tables of measurements that the British race of D. dama has larger metapodial bones than those from Chios. The one skeleton from Asia Minor contained in the Museum collection is, however, comparable in size with the Emporio material, so that the small size of the Emporio bones cannot in itself be taken as an argument that this deer was domesticated or at least to some extent dependent on man for food. The deer may have been herded by man, however, in much the same way as pigs were. This is suggested by the very large proportion of young animals that are represented by the mandibles and teeth, for if hunting was the only means of killing the deer it is more likely that the bone remains would represent a random selection of age groups. It is not believed that young ruminants are more easy to catch and kill than adult animals, for within a few days of birth they are as agile as the parents. There is no doubt that shed deer antlers were collected for making picks and probably other artifacts. Domestic cattle The bones and teeth of domestic cattle were found in levels of all the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods but, as with the other species, the number of specimens is much greater in the later deposits in Area A, that is in ones of Periods VI-I, and in the deposits of Areas B and C. i assignable to the horizon of Periods V-II. After those of sheep and goat the cattle remains are the most plentiful at Emporio. They are all from small animals of the short-horned type. Cattle horn cores Only four horn cores of cattle were found in the prehistoric levels. One of these had been cut off</page><page sequence="281">5. ANIMAL BONES 689 from the frontal bone. Two of the horn cores are circular in cross-section, whilst the other two are flattened on the anterior side and rounded on the posterior side of the core. The flattened cores are most likely to have come from bulls. Three of the cores show cutting marks, and it is most probable that the horns of killed cattle were used as utensils and perhaps also for musical instruments and decorative objects. Jaw fragments and teeth Maxillae. Only two fragments of maxillae were found. One is a right maxilla with three molar teeth. These are well worn and the third molar has closed roots. The second maxilla has one well-worn second permanent premolar. Mandibles. There are eight right mandibles and six left mandibles. Eight of the mandibles are from old animals with well-worn teeth that have closed roots, three are from young adult animals and three are from juveniles with milk teeth. Six of the mandibles have been chopped along the base of the horizontal ramus, presumably for extraction of the marrow and possibly for obtaining bone for making pins and other artifacts. Isolated Teeth. Upper series: from all the levels, approximately 65 upper cheek teeth have been counted. There are no milk teeth amongst these. The teeth are mostly well worn except for 3 third molars that are just erupted (from 2-year-old animals). Lower series: 9 incisors, 24 premolars, 72 molars. There are two left and two right milk premolars that are possibly from one individual but, apart from these, the teeth are all from adult animals and they exhibit all stages of wear. There are 18 lower third molars, all of which are erupted. Because of the close similarity in structure of the three upper molars, the only measurements that have been recorded are from the readily identifiable lower third molars. These are given in Table 8 (only complete teeth have been measured and some of these are set in the mandible fragments). It can be seen from the crown heights that all stages of wear are present. A crown height of 50 mm. or over indicates for these Chios animals that the teeth are little worn and from young adults of approximately 2 years old. Out of 20 teeth in which the crown height is measurable, it can be seen that 5 exceed 50 mm. Skeletal remains (other than teeth) of cattle Some of the bones are charred and all the long bones have been broken, presumably for extraction of the marrow. They are mostly from adult animals. Measurements and lists of the bones are given below: Scapulae: 7 fragments; only one of these has part of the blade present, and it is charred. Humeri: 4 left distal ends and 5 right distal ends.

This proportion is the same as that for the other principal food animals; pig, deer, and goat/sheep. It is, however, noticeable that whereas in these other animals old individuals are rare (this assumption being based on the wear of the third molar tooth which is the last tooth to erupt), old cattle are numerous. This suggests that some calves were killed for food but that adult animals were used for draught and threshing, as they are at the present day, and were killed off for hides and food when they were old (plate 144 Domestic Goats and Sheep At the time of writing this report very little evidence had been published that could be used to support identifications of post-cranial skeletal bones as sheep or goat, and there was not enough comparative material available to the author to justify original research into possible distinctions. The goat and sheep remains from Emporio were in a very fragmentary state and this added a further complexity in that it was found that in many cases the bone fragments could also have belonged to fallow deer. The goat/sheep bones, with the exception of the horn cores, were therefore considered as an entity and they were counted as such but not measured. Domestic goats The genus Capra contains five living species that are found in the Palaearctic region (Ellerman &amp; Morrison-Scott, 1951): C. aegagrus Erxleben, 1777; C. falconeri Wagner, 1839; C. ibex L.; C. caucásica Güldenstaedt &amp; Pallas, 1783; C. pyrenaica Schinz, 1838. Capra aegagrus is found today in certain Greek islands, in Asia Minor, Persia, Western Sind, Baluchistan, and Turkmenia. The presence of a sharp anterior keel and the general shape of the goat horn cores from the prehistoric levels of Emporio indicate that the animal represented has affinities with C. aegagrus even if it is not a pure domesticated form of the present-day wild type. In the wild C. aegagrus both sexes have horns. Goats and sheep were the main food animals in prehistoric Chios as they are at the present day. Their remains were found in large numbers in all levels at Emporio, and are represented by</page><page sequence="286">694 III. EMPORIO a few skull fragments, large numbers of goat horn cores and a very large number of jaws and isolated teeth. Horn cores As observed by Dalimier (1954) and Zeuner (1955), two main types of domestic goat have been found on archaeological sites in western Asia and Egypt. The first and most primitive type is straight- or scimitar-horned, and the horn core has an anterior keel. The second type, which was introduced into western Asia during the early Bronze Age, has twisted or screw horns. Both types of horn cores are found in the Bronze Age levels of Emporio (plate 143 (b): A and B). Scimitar horn cores have been found in the Prepottery Neolithic of Jericho. They probably came from domesticated goats. Zeuner (1955) has shown that these horn cores differ from those of the wild Capra aegagrus by the rounding of the horn core which becomes almond-shaped in male specimens. Horn cores of this type have also been found on the Neolithic site ofjarmo in Iraq (Reed, 1961 ). In wild male C. aegagrus the horn has a typical quadrangular shape with a flattened antero-external surface and a sharp anterior keel. In both wild and domestic female goats of this species the horn has a tendency towards the almond shape found in the male specimens from Jericho. The twisted horn cores from ancient Egyptian sites, studied by Zeuner, differ from those of Jericho in that the medial side of the core is flattened, whilst the outer side is convex and rounded. The cores are therefore not quadrangular as in the wild C. aegagrus and are not almond-shaped as in the Jericho specimens. There is one twisted horn core from the early Bronze Age levels of Jericho, and this has an almond-shaped cross-section. Zeuner has pointed out in the same paper (1955) that the scimitar horned goats (C. aegagrus) described from the Neolithic sites of Khirokitia and Erimi in Cyprus by King (1954) were replaced in the Late Bronze Age site of Myrtou-Pigadhes (1300 b.c.) by twisted-horned goats. These had an almond-shaped cross-section like the Jericho goats and unlike the ancient Egyptian. All but two of the goat horns from Emporio were found in levels of Periods VI-I in the main Area A. The remaining two horn cores were found in Area C. 1 in contexts of Periods V-II. Twenty-four scimitar horn cores were found, 16 of these coming from levels of Period II in Area A, that is from the deposits of rubbish dumped as fill behind the great terrace wall, assignable to a late phase of Troy I or the beginning of Troy II. Nine twisted horn cores were found in levels of Period II in Area A, and one fragmentary core that was probably twisted was found in one of the Area C. 1 trenches assignable to Periods V-II contemporary with Troy I. The cross-sectional outlines of five of the scimitar horn cores and six of the twisted horn cores are given in fig. 301. The cross-sections were taken at the end of the basal third of the core as were Zeuner's (1955). All the horn cores in fig. 301 are from levels of Period II in Area A. It can be seen from these cross-sections that both the almond-shaped cores and those with flattened internal sides are represented by the scimitar horn cores and the twisted horn cores from Emporio. In order to compare the size and shape of the goat horn cores from Emporio with those described by Zeuner ( 1 955) , measurements of each one were taken at the end of the basal third of the core and a cross-sectional index calculated from the antero-posterior diameter and the lateral thickness. Where the whole horn core is not present the basal third has had to be estimated from the size and curvature of the basal portion.

EMPORIO Emporio horn cores may be compared with those from Jericho and Cyprus (quoted from Zeuner, 1955) in Table 9. It may be noted that the twisted horn cores from Emporio are larger than the scimitar horn cores, and it is possible that the twisted-horned goats were larger animals.

INTRODUCTION The chipped stone and obsidian from Emporio was taken to Athens, where Perry G. Bialor studied it along with the material from the Lower Cave at Ayio Gala preserved in the National Museum there. The material from the Upper Cave at Ayio Gala had already been studied by myself in the mosque-museum in Chios town. Supplies of flint were apparently available in Chios. Lumps of greyish flint banded in hard white limestone were noted by me in the summer of 196 1 on high ground between Piryi and Tholopotamoi. A large lump of the same material was found on the surface at Emporio. In the following accounts the dimensions of pieces of flint and obsidian are given in millimetres, with length x width x thickness, in that order unless otherwise stated. 2. THE CHIPPED STONE ASSEMBLAGES FROM EMPORIO AND FROM THE LOWER CAVE AT AYIO GALA (Perry G. Bialor) (1) Emporio (figs. 302-3) From a total of some 6 1 2 pieces and 4 pebbles recovered, 5 1 7 came from the stratified sequence in the main area of the excavations (Area A) (sections i-viii) . The remainder includes over 20 from deposits of Period I (contemporary with Troy II) in Area F (section ix), and 35 from Late Bronze Age and Mycenaean levels in Areas D and F, together with a number from Roman deposits or surface levels (section x) . There is a high percentage of waste, 83 per cent, mainly small broken bits, rather than clear waste flakes; these have been designated 'broken pieces' in the report following. It seems that there must have been little leeway in the choice of materials for the chipped stone tools, as a variety of poor quality, veined flints, sometimes even limestone, was pressed into service; this includes sizes down to small pebbles. Much of the flint or chert is in the form of small nodules with a heavy buff weathered matrix. There are relatively few obsidian pieces, most of them of small dimension; some no more than microlithic slivers. (a) Descriptive catalogue i. Period X Shaped implements Flint: 2 One small round 'fingernail' scraper and one end scraper on a blade. The former is of tan chert; retouch is restricted to the edge around half the circumference (20 x 21 x 5) (fig. 303: 3, 699</page><page sequence="291">fig. 302. Emporio.

CHIPPED STONE INDUSTRIES One edge of the blade is also retouched or chipped from heavy use from the point of the diagonal end halfway toward the bulbar end of the blade. The rather thick, stout point formed on one side of the blade may have been some sort of pressure tool (41 x 15x4) (fig. 303: 6, from G 141). The implement was found associated with 22 other flint pieces and 30 pieces of obsidian, mainly minute, on the floor and in the curving wall of the D-shaped house in trench G.

Obsidian: 31 Most are microlithic slivers, 1 7 of which come from the floor of the D-shaped house in trench G; they include only two complete blades, 23 and 29 in length (fig. 303: 11, 12, from G 141). Of those blades which are not from the floor, one is used on both edges (23 x 16), another is a trapeze-like segment, but as the ends are not retouched it cannot be considered a true trapeze (16 x 16x3) (fig. 303: 5, from Q 145). Three other blades, with no signs of use, are thin and narrow (9, 12, 14 wide). Only three blades show some use or wear chipping; they are irregular and come from a trimmed core surface. Blade-like flakes Flint: 6 No signs of use. Flakes and broken pieces Flint: 56 Thirty-six are waste flakes; the rest broken fragments. Many of the pieces seem to be from the same or similar blocks of mottled dark brown chert with heavy matrix. Obsidian: 25 Only two show signs of use. Most of the flakes come from the floor of the D-shaped house and are quite small (14). Cores Obsidian: 9 There are four blade core remnants, three of which are complete. The tip ends are trimmed on a diagonal in the direction of the blade scar surface; the backs are flat single plane scars, perhaps broken. The fourth remnant is missing its tip end, but falls within the same size and form groupas the others (lengths: 42, 29, 41, and 48) (fig. 303: 10, from G 141). The lengths of blades struck from the three complete cores are about 34, 36, and 27. Three other core fragments are only small remnants; two of them are uni-directional cores (lengths: 27 and 52), producing rather irregular blades. The remainder consists of one small tip end of a core, which may have been re-used along one edge of the break, and one thin core remnant with none of the original striking platform preserved; in proportion it is almost like a blade (38 x 16x5). Although there is a relatively greater number of obsidian pieces in this level, core blocks were small and thoroughly used up. Though many blades are microlithic, most are not particularly uniform. Obsidian must still have been precious. iv. Period VII Shaped implements Obsidian: 1 A small projectile point made on a blade segment. The bulbar end is trimmed by slight retouch from both sides to create the tip; there is a small notch on one side at the opposite end, which is broken (19 x 13 x 3) (fig. 303: 14, from Q 130).</page><page sequence="295">704 IV.

(b) Summary Although the whole assemblage is fairly uniform through time, showing no apparent major breaks in tool types, and is, therefore, probably a single industry, there is also somewhat greater consistency to be observed in the materials found in levels of Periods IX-VI, than there is in those from levels of X-IX or from VI to V-II. The bladiness of the industry in Periods IX-VI is from 30 to 40 per cent, compared to much lower bladiness percentage in Periods X and V to II. The ratio of obsidian to flint is also higher in Periods IX to VI. The 3 small arrowheads which appear in a level of Period VII, and in ones of Period II and of the Roman period (fig. 303: 14, 2, 1 ) are partially retouched; one is stemmed, another probably was stemmed, and the third of Period VII is broken at a point which makes it impossible to know whether it was stemmed. The sickle elements are snapped blade segments used on one or both edges, though the single-side sheen blade predominates. These appear only sparsely in all Periods. A slightly greater number appear in levels of IX- V than before or afterwards. The edges are sometimes serrated, as on the arrowhead from a post-Bronze Age deposit on the Acropolis (Area F) (fig. 303: 1). The 3 scrapers appear in levels of X and VIII: small round scrapers in levels of X and VIII, an end scraper in one of X. A single diagonal end blade from Period VIII completes the list of shaped tools. No awls were found, although in the Lower Cave at Ayio Gala a type of awl with trimmed base is the most prominent shaped tool in the assemblage. (2) The Lower Cave at Ayio Gala (FIG. 304. PLATES 13, 14) The collection of chipped stone described below was recovered from the Lower Cave at Ayio Gala. The deposit from which it comes was not stratified, but had apparently been precipitated from some other cave at a higher level. The associated pottery is principally Neolithic with some slight admixture of later sherds. It is likely that the stone assemblage is also Neolithic in date. However, any interpretation of the following data must keep in mind the possible heterogeneity and the rather small size of the assemblage, consisting only of 164 pieces. Shaped implements There are 8 clearly shaped implements. These include 1 end scraper on a blade, a knife blade, and 6 awls, of which 2 are retouched on the basal end as well as toward the tip. The end scraper is on a thick blade with core matrix along one edge; the opposite edge is retouched (55x21 x 6) (fig. 304: 4. plates i 3 (a) , 1 4 (b) ) . The flint is a dull pitch black, a kind of</page><page sequence="300">fig. 304. Ayio Gala: Lower Cave. Chipped stone and obsidian. Scale 2/3. 2.

CHIPPED STONE INDUSTRIES flint not found elsewhere in the assemblage, which consists of flints in shades of grey, black, and brown. The 6 awls are on blades with sides retouched to a heavy long point at the bulbar end of the blade. The rest of the blade to the broken end is left unworked (lengths: 68, 62, 60, and 36). In 2 cases the end opposite the tip is retouched on the bulbar face, which blunts and rounds the base of the awls (fig. 304: 1,12. plates 14 (a), 13 (a)). One of them is almost leaf-shaped due to its greater-than-usual width, and extensive low angle retouch of both base and tip (54 x 25 x 7. fig. 304: 1). The basal retouch was probably to facilitate hafting or cushioning in the hand. The other awls may also have had basal trim when in their complete state, but it is now impossible to know as the ends in question are missing (fig. 304: 2, 3. plate 14 (a), (b)). Sickle elements The 3 sickle blades are on typical blade mid-segments with silica sheen on the right-hand edge only (fig. 304: 1 1 (32 x 10 x 5). fig. 304: 6 (36 x 14 x 4). fig. 304: 5 (42 x 13x3)). There is also 1 long parallel-sided blade, used on one edge, the opposite edge blunted by matrix; the bulbar end is retouched on the edge at one side of the bulb of percussion, the tip end is missing (85 x 1 7 x 3.5) (fig. 304: 9. plates 13 (0), 14 (a)). Blades There are 80 flint blades and blade fragments, of which 10 are whole or nearly whole blades. The whole blades range in length from a very irregular one 37 to the longest one 86, which is used on one edge. Of the 80 blades and blade fragments, only 7 show use chipping on one edge; none is chipped on both edges. (There are 44 bulbar ends, only 2 tip ends, and 24 mid-sections: a skew in favour of bulbar end fragments is not unusual, but the great disproportion evidenced here is somewhat unusual, and may, therefore, be significant even in this small collection.) There are also 7 blade fragments of obsidian, which constitute all the obsidian found in the Lower Cave (fig. 304: 7, 9. plate 14 (¿)): most of these are less than 10 wide. Of the flint and chalcedony blades 7 are 10 wide or less, 47 are between 10 and 15, 8 between 15 and 20, and 1 wider than 25. The blades are therefore of rather consistent narrow width, i.e. only 9 are wider than 15, although many are not regular parallel-edged blades. There is also 1 irregular core trimming blade without signs of regular preshaping of core (length: 48). The 8 shaped implements described above are also made on blades, bringing the blade total to 92 pieces. Utilized irregular blades and blade-like flakes There are 5 blade-like flakes of chert. Two are only slightly retouched, probably by use, along one edge; 1 has some end use as a scraper (48 x 20) and another heavy irregular retouch along the right-hand convex edge (fig. 304: 10, length 57). One large blade is blunted by heavy retouching on one edge, but the opposite edge is also blunt due to core matrix. The blade is complete (75 x 20 x 7). (3) Comparison with Mykonos Site To the south-west of Chios lies the island of Mykonos at a distance of less than 100 km, with no islands intervening. Although there has been no excavation on the island, the presence of a prehistoric site was brought to the attention of Professor Saul Weinberg during the summer of i960. The Mykonos site is probably Early Bronze Age in date, with possibly Late Neolithic origins,</page><page sequence="302">3. AYIO GALA: UPPER CAVE 711 according to the sherds, most of which are plain and quite coarse. Of the 914 pieces of chipped stone examined, 48 were type specimens and provide some useful comparisons with the 2 assemblages from Chios. Impressionistically, although not in detail, the Mykonos assemblage resembles that from Chios. Sickle blades are noticeably lacking; present are a number of notched blades and flakes (which may have served the same purpose as sickle blades), a variety of small scrapers, and awls on blades and flakes. The small stemmed projectile points are quite conspicuous (12): they are sometimes neatly bifacially retouched with long tapering stems, although the degree of retouch varies considerably. The mean length of these small points is about 3, comparable in size to the 3 from Emporio. The 3 projectile points from Emporio are, however, somewhat smaller and certainly cruder in workmanship than those from Mykonos. One striking contrast between the 2 collections is that the Mykonos surface assemblage is completely of obsidian, with the exception of a single red flint projectile point and a quartzitic projectile point, whereas obsidian is scarce at Emporio, and even more so at Ayio Gala; the relatively closer proximity of Mykonos to Melos (the supposed source of Greek obsidian) should partially account for this major difference in source materials. 3. THE CHIPPED STONE ASSEMBLAGE FROM THE UPPER CAVE AT AYIO GALA (Sinclair Hood) (fig. 305) What was preserved from the Upper Cave in the mosque-museum in Chios after the Second World War consisted of 95 pieces of worked flint or chert and 9 of obsidian. Hardly any of this material had survived with a record of the deposit from which it came and it has all therefore been treated together. The proportion of obsidian to flint or chert is much less than at Emporio, in the region of 1 : 1 o as opposed to about 1:5. In the Lower Cave it was even less: only 7 pieces of obsidian out of a total of 1 64, or less than 1 : 23. In contrast to this it is reported that most of the chipped stone tools at Tigani in Samos were of obsidian (Tigani 197). But the majority of the chipped stone tools not of obsidian published from Tigani are on large lumps like our nos. 1 6-20 ( Tigani 1 96 ff. figs. 7-9) . W. Buttler suggested that these tools on lumps might conceivably belong to a period before the beginning of the Neolithic; but according to R. Felsch, Samos xiv 1 29 note 2, they probably date from towards the end of the Late Neolithic. It is interesting that tools on lumps of this kind were not in evidence in the material from the Lower Cave at Ayio Gala nor at Emporio. (1) Flint and Chert: 95 Material The dominant material was a flint, very dark brown, almost black in appearance, or dark grey; but some pieces were a lighter brown in colour (e.g. fig. 305: 1 3) . A chert, mostly of a fairly deep shade of brown, but in some cases a paler whitish colour, appeared to be virtually confined to blades, a large proportion of which (about half) were made of it. It would be interesting to know if these blades, or the material used for them, were brought to Ayio Gala from elsewhere. The dominant dark brown to black and dark grey varieties of flint, of which the larger implements like fig. 305: 4 were made, was presumably local to the area. Shaped implements: 7 There were only a few shaped implements, the most striking being the 'fabricator' (fig. 305: 13)</page><page sequence="303">712 IV. CHIPPED STONE INDUSTRIES (L. 58) made on a thick blade of flint a rich yellowish brown in colour with a white streak in it - a distinctive material not represented in the collection apart from this. It had a slight bulb of percussion at the lower end, and the edges had been neatly blunted by secondary working. One of 2 awls (fig. 305: 14) (L. 52) was on a blade of triangular section of translucent brown flint; it had neat secondary working on the upper face down the sides to blunt them. The other (fig. 305: 15), on a large rough blade (L. 74) of black flint with a good deal of cortex left on the upper surface, had rather rough secondary working of this kind to blunt the sides. The 4 scrapers included one on a large thick lump of black flint (L. 70. W. 60) (fig. 305: 16, from a depth of ?2. 05-1. 90); scraping edges had been made round three sides by secondary working on the upper face. Another scraper (fig. 305: 1 7) (L. 29. W. 33) was on a small lump of pale brown flint. A third (fig. 305: 18) (L. 50. W. 46) was on a core of very dark brown flint; it had two working edges made at opposite ends and on opposite faces. The side scraper (fig. 305: 19) (L. 57) was on a flake of dark grey flint; the tip had been blunted by secondary working on the lower (bulbar) face; the working edge was in mint condition and still sharp. Sickle elements: none I expected to find these, and was surprised by their absence. None of the blades or blade sections, however, appeared to show any trace of lustre suggestive of use as sickle blades. Blades'. 10 (fig. 305: 21, 22) These range in length from 62 to 34. Their striking platforms had been almost entirely battered away before removal from the core. The blades were for the most part three-facetted, but one was triangular in section. The material of which a large proportion of them was made, described above, may have been imported. Blade sections'. 19 (max. L. 55) Blade core: 1 (fig. 305: 20) This (L. 44) was of brown flint; rather rough, with cortex still preserved down one edge. It had an unprepared striking platform. Blade-like flakes: 14 These (max. L. 66) appeared to have been struck from blade cores, but they were much wider in proportion to their length than blades. The facets on the upper face were often very irregular, not continuing for the whole of the length. The striking platforms were usually large and unprepared. Some flakes and blade-like flakes showed signs of use or secondary working along the edges. One blade-like flake (fig. 305: 23) (L. 50) of dark brown flint had neat secondary working on the upper face along the whole of one side and part of the other. (2) Obsidian: 9 There were 5 blades and 4 blade sections of obsidian (L. 38-20). The 2 smallest pieces were of a very transparent variety, the other 7 being more or less opaque. The blades (e.g. fig. 305: 24) have battered striking platforms like the flint blades. The blade section fig. 305: 25 (L. 23) has neat secondary working down one edge on the under face, due perhaps to resharpening of the edge: the upper end was apparently snapped across along a line of weakness made by secondary working.</page><page sequence="304">fig. 305.

INTRODUCTION References have not been repeated in this section. They will be found in the appropriate place in Volume I, Part III, Chapter 3 Section (2) (b), on Pottery Types, or, in the case of features like handles and lugs, in the sections on these by Periods (Chapter 3 Section (2) (e), on Pottery from Area A). The references for comparison with individual numbered pieces appear after the description of these in the text. The Early Bronze Age Periods V- I at Emporio are relatively easy to fix in their archaeological context. The pottery of Emporio then is essentially like that of the Troad, although with local variations. Period I seems to correspond to some late phase of Troy II; Period II to late Troy I and probably the early part of Troy II; Periods V-IV to the early and middle phases of Troy I. Periods VII-VI have clear affinities both with Kum Tepe I B in the Troad and with the Late Chalcolithic of south-west Anatolia as represented at Beycesultan. The correlations for the earlier periods, Emporio X-VIII, are more problematical. Some of those who have examined material from deposits of these periods in Chios Museum have formed the impression that they are to be equated in time with the Anatolian Late Chalcolithic and with the Late Neolithic of Greece. Thus Renfrew, Emergence 76 Chart, sets Emporio IX-VIII parallel with the Late Neolithic and Emporio X at the end of the Middle Neolithic in terms of the Greek mainland. Hope Simpson and Dickinson in Gazetteer (1969) 369 suggest that occupation at Emporio began in the Late Neolithic. It was indeed my own impression at first that the earliest occupation there did not date much before the beginning of the Bronze Age (e.g. Antiquity xxix (1955) 32. Archaeology viii (1955) 246. /ZJV 31 Dec. 1955, p. 1144). The whole of the pottery sequence at Tigani in Samos broadly corresponding to that of Emporio X-VI has been similarly ascribed by R. Felsch, Samos xiv 1 29 ff., to the Late Neolithic on the basis of the evidence from the recent excavations. There are certainly arguments for such a dating for the early part of the sequence from Emporio; but for the reasons detailed below I am inclined to believe that Emporio X may go back to a very early phase of the Aegean Neolithic, and that Emporio X-VIII may have affinities with the Early Neolithic of the Greek mainland, although the end of VIII may lie within the borders of the Late Chalcolithic of south-west Anatolia on the one hand and of the Middle Neolithic of the Greek mainland on the other. At the same time I have suggested in Volume I, Part II, Chapter 5, that the sequence at Ayio Gala is roughly parallel with Emporio IX/VIII-VI/V. An argument for a relatively early date for Emporio X-VIII can be drawn from the succession of fabrics: a phase of essentially dark-surfaced wares (Periods X- IX) being followed by one (Period VIII) with a certain amount of red- and brown-surfaced pottery associated with a primitive variety of incised decoration and with pattern burnish. This is succeeded by a horizon (Periods VII-VI) of Fine Black Burnished Ware with decoration in white paint associated with Light Brown Burnished Ware. These two fabrics seem to correspond to the black burnished ware with decoration in white of the Anatolian Late Chalcolithic on the one hand and 715</page><page sequence="306">716 III. EMPORIO AND AYIO GALA to the Urfirnis ware characteristic of the Middle Neolithic and the early part of the Late Neolithic on the Greek mainland on the other. The implication that the beginning of the Late Chalcolithic in Anatolia overlaps with the Middle Neolithic on the Greek mainland may appear surprising. But the Chronological Table published by Mellaart, Neolithic Near East 14 f., implies this, although it must be emphasized that Mellaart's conclusion was reached by a different route and is set in a very different general context. The sequence in the Troad appears to be comparable with that at Emporio, and may go back to a time contemporary with Emporio X-IX. Thus Kum Tepe I A has some affinities with Emporio VIII and perhaps with Emporio IX. It seems very possible that occupation at the important site of Beçik Tepe in the Troad began earlier than Kum Tepe I A, as Mellaart, Studia Balcanica v (1971) 119 ff, has indicated (although he places it late in relation to Poliochni, making it contemporary with the Black period and the early part of the Blue there). The earlier levels at Beçik Tepe may prove to have affinities with Emporio X-IX, but little has yet been revealed about the material from them. In any case it looks as if the Trojan sequence throughout its long history developed to a large extent separately from the sequences in the interior of Anatolia as known from sites like Hacilar and Beycesultan. The Troad may have derived new ideas, and perhaps actual immigrants who brought them, from Cilicia or Syria by the sea-route along the southern coasts of Anatolia and past islands like Samos and Chios. The situation of the earliest known Troadic sites like Beçik Tepe and Kum Tepe near the sea is suggestive. Biegen, Troy and the Trojans (London, 1963) 40, indicated that Kum Tepe might well be the place where an enterprising band of immigrants, arriving by ship, made good their first foothold on land. The pottery from caves of the Antalya region of Pamphylia shows distinct links with the early pottery of Emporio and with the comparable material from Tigani in Samos. Some of the pottery from these caves near Antalya is thought to be contemporary with or (in the case ofthat from layer B in the Beldibi cave) earlier than the Kizilkaya culture ofthat region and to pre-date the Late Neolithic of Hacilar IX. 2. EMPORIO X-VIII The two most characteristic vase shapes of this earliest horizon at Emporio - bowl-jars of various types and jars of type 41 - can be traced back to very early times in the Near East. The bowl-jars of Emporio X-VIII resemble those of Hacilar, and appear to be closer to those of the Neolithic levels IX-VI there than to ones of the Chalcolithic levels V-I. The Cilician Neolithic (Mersin XXXII-XXVI) includes shapes that might be ancestral to the bowl-jars of Neolithic Hacilar alongside prototypes of jars of Emporio type 41 . There are bowl-jars similar to those of Emporio X-VIII in the Early Neolithic of the Greek mainland, including that of Thessaly and western Macedonia (Nea Nikomedeia) . In harmony with this is the occurrence of jugs of type 20 in levels of Periods X-VIII at Emporio, but not later. These are in shape akin to jars of type 41 , but they have a single handle to the rim instead of a pair joining neck and shoulder. In Emporio VII-VI they give place to jugs of types related to those of the Late Chalcolithic of south-west Anatolia (Beycesultan) and Cilicia (Tarsus). Type 41 jars with a pair of handles joining neck to shoulder were very characteristic of the early periods at Emporio, and especially of Period VIII. Jars of a similar type occur in the Early and Middle Neolithic at Byblos, and have many relatives in the earliest pottery of the Near East. Thus jars of comparable shape, although without any handles, are at home in the lowest levels at Hassuna. The type does not seem to have been illustrated from Çatal Hüyük, however, and</page><page sequence="307">CHRONOLOGICAL POSITION 717 comparable jars do not appear to be attested at Hacilar before level VII there. Jar rims akin to those of type 41 occur in the earliest Neolithic of Crete and of the Greek mainland as well as at Saliagos. A variety of this type with a pair of handles on the shoulder or the belly (like AG 205 from the later horizon of material at Ayio Gala) is at home at the beginning of the Late Chalcolithic (level XVI) at Mersin and in the Late Neolithic of the Greek mainland. It must be admitted that certain features in the pottery from levels of Emporio X-VIII might appear to suggest a relatively advanced date for them. This is especially true in the case of some varieties of handles and lugs. But the great variety of lugs and handles from levels of Emporio X-VIII is not in itself an objection to an early date. J.D. Evans, BSA lxiii (1968) 271, for instance, has noted the varied handling devices on the earliest (Early Neolithic I) pottery from Knossos in Crete. Some of these Cretan Early Neolithic handling devices can be paralleled from levels of Emporio IX-VIII (e.g. 325-6 and CLAY 22, comparable with examples from deposits of Early Neolithic I and II at Knossos). The following are among features which might be regarded as suggesting a relatively advanced date for the early levels at Emporio: (1) Horned handles were characteristic of the earliest periods at Emporio, and especially of Emporio X. Such handles appear to be a feature of the Late Chalcolithic in Anatolia and of the Late Neolithic on the Greek mainland. They also occur at Byblos on the Syrian coast in the Late Neolithic and succeeding Aeneolithic, equated by Braidwood with Amuq E and F and with the Late Chalcolithic levels XV-XIII at Mersin. But horned handles are present in the earlier as well as in the later horizon at Ayio Gala. Since the study of Furness published in 1956 there has been a tendency to assign the earlier horizon of material from Ayio Gala to a relatively early period in time. Thus Mellaart, Neolithic Near East 15, sets it contemporary with Hacilar VII-VI or V onwards. This is more or less in agreement with the conclusions which I have reached, equating it with Emporio VIII and perhaps with Emporio IX. The fact that horned handles have been recovered from the early site of Be§ik Tepe in the Troad may be in harmony with their appearance in Emporio X-IX and at Ayio Gala; but it has still to be proved that occupation at Beçik Tepe goes back to a relatively early period of time as I have assumed that it does. (2) The fragment 338 with the join of three handles from a level of Emporio X can be paralleled from the Late Neolithic of the Greek mainland and from Kephala on Kea. A possible parallel from Rakhmani in Thessaly, however, might be Middle Neolithic or even Early Neolithic in date. (3) Handles with sophisticated-looking semi-circular sections are attested as early as Period X at Emporio, and ones with lunate sections occur in Emporio IX. There are basket handles with comparable sections, however, from Çatal Hüyük West assigned to the Early Chalcolithic (AS xv (1965) 148 fig. 11: 16, 17). (4) Even more evolved in appearance and more difficult to parallel from an early context are the kidney-shaped sections of the handles 93 from a level of Emporio IX and 348-9 from ones of VIII. There are very comparable handles from levels of the beginning of the Late Chalcolithic at Beycesultan. (5) Lugs with relief tails from deposits of Emporio VIII and possibly from ones of IX may be compared with the 'Ayio Gala' lugs on vases from the Lower Cave at Ayio Gala belonging to the earlier horizon there. But they also have parallels from the wells of the Athenian Agora and from Kephala on Kea assigned to the Greek Late Neolithic. Rather similar lugs, however, are found in Hacilar VI and II B. (6) White painted decoration is most at home at Emporio in Periods VII-VI, but it is attested from Emporio X onwards. While decoration in white paint is very characteristic of the</page><page sequence="308">718 III. EMPORIO AND AYIO GALA Late Chalcolithic of south-west Anatolia, as known from Beycesultan, it is found in the top of the Late Neolithic (level VI) at Hacilar. At Saliagos white painted decoration was most at home in the earliest phase i . It is not well represented on the Greek mainland until the Middle Neolithic, but it is already present in the Early Neolithic there. (7) The occurrence of large pithoi in levels of the early periods at Emporio from X onwards might be considered an indication of a relatively late date. But pithoi with comparable rims seem to occur in the Neolithic of the Levant, being illustrated from coastal sites like Sukas and Ras Shamra. (8) Coarse baking pans of type 3 with holes through their rims are found at Emporio from Period X onwards, but they are especially at home in Periods IX and VIII there. Baking pans of this type occur at Saliagos. They are very characteristic of the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age on the Greek mainland and on Kea. In Thessaly they appear to be most at home in the latest phase of the Early Bronze Age, Early Thessalian III. But vessels of a similar kind, although apparently just sun-dried, not deliberately fired, occur at Ras Shamra in the earliest pottery-bearing horizon of the Neolithic (Ras Shamra V B). (9) A copper ring-pendant or belt-fastener (METAL 17) was recovered from a level of Emporio IX, and two scraps of copper from ones of VIII. The occurrence of this metal in these levels might be taken to indicate they were of relatively late date. But copper was apparently being employed for making beads and trinkets, even small tools, from very early times at Cayönü and Çatal Hüyük in eastern Anatolia, and it was evidently in quite general use at Can Hasan by Level 2 B there (Mellaart, Ancient Near East, 120). It therefore seems as if relatively early parallels are forthcoming for most of the 'advanced' features in the pottery and other finds from levels of Emporio X-VIII. At the same time there is positive evidence in favour of a comparatively early date for this horizon at Emporio: (1) White slipped ware is attested from levels of Emporio IX and VIII. It also occurs in the Early and Middle Neolithic of the Greek mainland. (2) Plates of type 1 are virtually confined to Periods X-VIII at Emporio. Such plates have parallels at Çatal Hüyük and in the Early Neolithic of Crete and of the Greek mainland. (3) The large horizontal handles rising from the rims of bowls which are such a distinctive feature of Periods X-VIII at Emporio, and especially of Emporio IX, have close analogies at Çatal Hüyük from Level VI onwards into Early Chalcolithic I. Similar handles are also attested from the lowest level IX of the Late Neolithic at Hacilar, and from the Early Chalcolithic Level XXIII at Mersin. The fragment of such a handle from the Karain Cave near Antalya looks very much like some from Emporio; although this is assigned (but on grounds which are not made clear) to a relatively late period, the Chalcolithic or Copper Age. (4) The perforated lugs recovered from levels of Emporio X-VIII appear to show early features. Thus developed trumpet lugs, at home in the succeeding Periods VII-VI at Emporio, are not attested from levels of Emporio X-VIII. Long perforated lugs from those levels (e.g. 356) tend to be triangular in section: an early feature at Çatal Hüyük and Hacilar, and noted in the case of lugs on some of the complete bowl-jars from the Lower Cave at Ayio Gala assignable to the earlier horizon there. Simple upturned vertically perforated lugs like 351-4 of Emporio IX-VIII are a feature of the Early Neolithic pottery of Çatal Hüyük and Alan Hüyük. (5) The relief decoration of these earliest levels (Periods X-VIII) at Emporio can be paralleled from the Early Neolithic in other parts of the Aegean and from very early contexts in Syria (Byblos and Judeideh). Several details of the pottery and of other aspects of life noted in connection with Periods</page><page sequence="309">CHRONOLOGICAL POSITION 719 X- VIII at Emporio have relatively early parallels elsewhere in the Aegean area as well as in Anatolia and the Near East. (A) Period X (1) The skulls recovered from the lowest level of Period X reached in trench Q of the main area of excavation (Area A) were apparently beneath a floor and are suggestive of very early practices in the Levant, Anatolia, and Thessaly (Pródromos I). (2) The comb decoration on 381 is vaguely reminiscent of the cardium ware of the Presesklo phase (Early Neolithic III) in Thessaly; but it also has parallels from the Early Neolithic at Knossos in Crete and from the Neolithic of Tarsus in Cilicia, as well as from the lowest level 15 at Chagar Bazar in Syria, which appears to be contemporary with Early Halaf, Judeideh B, Byblos Early Neolithic, and the latest Neolithic to Early Chalcolithic at Mersin (Braidwood, in Ehrich, Chronologies (1965) 82 Chart. Mellaart, Neolithic Near East 16 Chart). (B) Period IX ( 1 ) The bowl rim 92 with a horizontal handle below it can be paralleled from Kum Tepe I A. (2) The pointillé decoration on 389 is made with short jabs instead of with circular holes. Areas of similar jabbing appear on fragments from the Early and Middle Chalcolithic at Mersin, and on vases from Can Hasan levels 3, 2B and 2A assignable to the same horizon. (3) The fine but irregular scratched incision on 390 is reminiscent of some of the cardium-decorated ware found at Byblos from the Early Neolithic onwards. Fragments of Early and Middle Chalcolithic incised ware from Mersin offer even closer parallels for it. (C) Periods IX or VIII Several important fragments were recovered from contexts assignable to Periods IX or VIII. ( 1 ) The close-set barbotine on 42 1 can be paralleled at Saliagos, in Nea Makri A II (the later part of the earlier horizon of Neolithic there), in Stratum IV of Early Neolithic II at Knossos, and in Judeideh C which appears to overlap with the Early Chalcolithic (levels XXIV-XIX) at Mersin. (2) The fragment 422 was recovered from the same deposit as 421 above. The distinctive seed-shaped warts set diagonally have parallels in the Early Neolithic of the Greek mainland, and especially, it seems, in the latest phases of it. (D) Period VIII (1) The plate rim 5 has possible analogies in the Presesklo phase (Early Neolithic III) of the Thessalian Neolithic. (2) Dishes of type 2, which seem to be especially well represented in levels of Emporio VIII, can be paralleled in Kum Tepe I A and also in Ras Shamra V A (Late Neolithic) and IV. (3) Animal head lugs are very characteristic of Period VIII at Emporio and do not appear to be attested there earlier. The Emporio lugs seem to have analogies with ones which first appear at Hacilar in level VIII and are common there from V-II. A comparable lug from the Karain Cave near Antalya is assigned to the Neolithic. Versions of this type of lug were at home in the Late Neolithic of the Greek mainland, but these look in general more evolved than the examples from Hacilar and Emporio and could be later in date. (4) The tripod feet from levels of Emporio VIII were not necessarily from cooking pots and have possible analogies in feet from Kum Tepe I A. (5) Pattern burnish was a distinctive feature of Period VIII at Emporio. It was not attested</page><page sequence="310">720 III. EMPORIO AND AYIO GALA from levels of Emporio X, and only doubtfully from ones of IX. It was similarly absent from the earliest deposits revealed by the new excavations at Tigani (Samos xiv 131, 133). The pattern burnish of Emporio VIII seems to be related to that of Beçik Tepe and Kum Tepe in the Troad. But there are examples of pattern burnish from levels of Emporio VII-VI, and some of these at any rate appear to be of contemporary date, not strays of Period VIII. This method of decorating vases was certainly at home at the end of the Late Neolithic in some parts of the Aegean, at Kephala on Kea, for instance, and on the island of Aegina, as well as at various sites on the Greek mainland. At Kephala it appears on the insides of bowls including one assignable to type 11 characteristic of Emporio VII-VI (Kephala pl. 41: H). Pattern burnish also flourished in Crete at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age there in Early Minoan I. Pattern burnish is attested on the Greek mainland, however, from the end of the Middle Neolithic, and in Thessaly it occurs still earlier, in the Presesklo (Early Neolithic III) if not in the Protosesklo (Early Neolithic II) phase. Pattern burnish was also at home at a relatively early stage in the Levant, in the Early and Middle Neolithic at Byblos, in Ras Shamra V. 3, Judeideh phases B and C, and Sakçe Gözü I- III. The pattern burnish of Emporio VIII may be linked with these earlier manifestations of pattern burnish in the Levant. In that case Emporio VIII could overlap in time with Beçik Tepe in the Troad and with the end of the Early Neolithic (Thessalian Presesklo) on the Greek mainland. (6) Incision was the most popular form of vase-decoration in Emporio VIII, where it was even more abundantly represented than pattern burnish. This incised decoration of Period VIII at Emporio is very different in character from that which was in fashion after an interval (Periods VII-VI) in Emporio V-IV. It is distinguished from the latter by the character of the designs, by the absence of white fill in the incisions, and by the shapes of the vases bearing it. The incised decoration of Emporio V-IV is related to that current in Troy I. The closest analogies for the incised decoration of Emporio VIII on the other hand are to be found in the Early Neolithic of the Greek mainland, notably at Nea Makri in Attica and at Nemea in the Péloponnèse. At Nemea as at Emporio in Period VIII the incisions were not apparently filled with white. The incised decoration of this Early Neolithic horizon on the Greek mainland has been compared by Theochares followed by Weinberg with that of the latest Neolithic and Early Chalcolithic at Mersin in Cilicia. Comparable incised decoration of about the same date has now been recovered from Levels 3 and 2 B at Can Hasan in the Konya plain. An isolated fragment, apparently from an imported vase, found in the lowest level IX of the Late Neolithic at Hacilar bears incised decoration very much like that of Emporio VIII. (7) The fingernail-impressed decoration on 418 closely resembles that on some vases of the latest (Presesklo) phase of the Thessalian Early Neolithic. But it must be admitted that decoration of this kind appears to continue later in surrounding regions including the Balkans. (8) The rows of circular warts or raised pellets on 423, of which one fragment came from a level of Emporio VIII, the other, apparently from the same vase, from one of VII, can be paralleled in relatively early contexts on the Greek mainland. Thus rows of circular warts set vertically or diagonally were a feature of the later part of the Early Neolithic at Elateia. 3. EMPORIO VII-VI The fashion for bowls of the distinctive types 10 and 1 1 link this horizon at Emporio with Kum Tepe I B in the Troad. At the same time the white-painted decoration on the Fine Black Burnished Ware connects it with the Late Chalcolithic of south-west Anatolia as known from Beycesultan. The implication is that Kum Tepe I B roughly corresponds in time to the Late</page><page sequence="311">CHRONOLOGICAL POSITION 721 Chalcolithic of Beycesultan. This cannot be reconciled with the attempt made by Mellaart, Studia Balcanica v (1971) 1 19 ff., to place the whole of Beycesultan Late Chalcolithic before the beginning of Kum Tepe I A. There are other grounds, however, for thinking that the Late Chalcolithic of Beycesultan, or at any rate the earlier phases of it, correspond in time to Kum Tepe I B in the Troad. Thus a few rims akin to Emporio type 10 were recovered from levels of Beycesultan Late Chalcolithic 1 and 3; a scrap of a type 1 1 rim comes from a level of Beycesultan Late Chalcolithic 1 , while another rim somewhat comparable to type 1 1 was recovered from a level of Late Chalcolithic 2. The latest phase of occupation at Tigani in Samos as revealed by the new excavations appears to have features which link it with Emporio VII- VI, with the Black period at Poliochni, and with Beycesultan Late Chalcolithic ((Samos xiv 133). At the same time correlations with the Greek mainland suggest that, while Emporio VI may overlap with the Late Neolithic there, Emporio VII could go back into the Middle Neolithic. This would imply that the beginning of the Late Chalcolithic at Beycesultan overlapped with the later part of the Middle Neolithic on the Greek mainland, as indicated by Mellaart, Neolithic Near East 14 f. Chart. The Light Brown Burnished Ware characteristic of Periods VII-VI at Emporio appears to be related to, if it is not identical with, some varieties of the Neolithic Urfirnis of the southern part of the Greek mainland. The appearance of Urfirnis has been taken to mark the beginning of the Middle Neolithic in southern Greece; but in the Franchthi Cave its most flourishing period seems to have been in fact the last of the three phases into which the Middle Neolithic there can be divided. The occurrence of Fine Black Burnished Ware alongside Light Brown Burnished Ware in Emporio VII-VI is reminiscent of the conjunction of Urfirnis ware with fine black burnished ware - sometimes decorated in white - in the horizon described as transitional Middle Neolithic-Late Neolithic in the Franchthi Cave. This corresponds to the Bothros horizon assigned to the end of the Middle Neolithic (or beginning of the Late Neolithic) at Elateia in Central Greece. Bowl rims akin to Emporio type 1 1 occur in this horizon. Type 10 bowls were equally well represented in levels of Period VII and in ones of Period VI at Emporio. They are found in the horizon of Kum Tepe I B 2 and 3 in the Troad, in the Black period at Poliochni, and in Thermi I. They are still attested at Emporio in levels of Periods V-IV, at Poliochni in ones of the Blue period, and in Thermi II. Rims comparable to those of Emporio type 10 from Corinth are assigned to the Late Neolithic, and ones from Koufovouno in Thessaly to the beginning of the Late or very end of the Middle Neolithic. Type 1 1 bowls were most characteristic of Period VII at Emporio, although they were still common in levels of Emporio VI; but they are hardly attested after the end of Period VI at Emporio. In the Troad they were similarly at home in the horizon of Kum Tepe I B, but none is recorded from Troy. A few, however, were recovered at Thermi; and at Poliochni, although they occurred in the Black period, which seems to overlap with Emporio VII-VI, they were more in evidence in the evolved Blue and the Green periods contemporary with Troy I. This led Brea to equate the early part of the Green period at Poliochni with Kum Tepe I A and B. Mellaart, Studia Balcanica v ( 1 97 1 ) 1 1 9 ff, has similarly placed the evolved Blue as well as the Black period of Poliochni before Troy I, making Kum Tepe I A begin towards the end of Poliochni Blue. But the occurrence of type 1 1 rims in the Blue and Green periods at Poliochni can be explained as a survival in a region not yet wholly penetrated by Trojan fashions in pottery. Type 1 1 bowls were at home in the Grotta-Pelos phase (Early Cycladic I) in the Cyclades. They also occur at the end of the Middle Neolithic and in the Late Neolithic in the southern part of the Greek mainland. In Thessaly they are attested somewhat later, in the Rakhmani phase</page><page sequence="312">722 III. EMPORIO AND AYIO GALA assignable to the latest Neolithic or Chalcolithic, and perhaps at the beginning of the local Bronze Age (Early Thessalian). In eastern Macedonia they are found as early as the first period at Sitagroi. Well-developed trumpet lugs first make their appearance at Emporio in the horizon of Periods VII-VI. The trumpet lugs of Emporio VII-VI are comparable with ones of the Kum Tepe I B phase in the Troad, and they can be paralleled at Saliagos in the Cyclades and in the Late Neolithic of the Greek mainland. None of these early trumpet lugs is ribbed, as are some of those from the succeeding horizon of Emporio V-IV and Troy I. White-painted decoration in Emporio VII-VI was largely confined to jugs of Fine Black Burnished Ware. But it also occurs on the insides of a few bowl rims, especially ones of type 14 (616, 618, 626). Decoration of this kind in white paint on the insides of bowl rims is a feature of the Late Chalcolithic of western Anatolia, and can be paralleled from the earlier part of the Late Chalcolithic at Beycesultan. Other features of interest for correlations from levels of Period VII include: (1) The rim 568 of type 10 has a hatched triangle in white paint on the inside. This motif is found on the insides of Late Chalcolithic bowl rims from the Akhisar region of western Anatolia. The same motif, but in dark paint on a light ground, appears on the insides of bowl rims from the Bothros horizon at Elateia in Central Greece assigned to the end of the Middle or beginning of the Late Neolithic. (2) The unique bowl-jar 656 probably belongs to an early level of Period VII; but one fragment was recovered from a possible context of VIII, and another from a deposit of VI. The system of decoration combining rows of triangular jabs with bands of red paint is found on pottery assigned to the early part of the Sesklo horizon (Middle Neolithic) in Thessaly. A rather similar, although not so closely comparable, system of decoration is attested from the Late Chalcolithic at Mersin. The concentric loops which form the chief motif of the decoration on 656 are reminiscent of a standard Ubaid design. Concentric loops of this kind occur on Late Chalcolithic painted ware from Mersin. They are found earlier in Syria, however, on the insides of vessels assigned to Middle and Late Halaf, but apparently reflecting Ubaid influence. A fragment of a bowl attributed to the Neolithic from the Çarkin Cave near Antalya has painted concentric loops on the outside closely resembling those on 656. (3) A solitary animal head lug (768) reminiscent of ones from Hacilar and from levels of Emporio VIII was recovered from a context of VII. (4) A fragment of what may have been a wide ring base of a type at home on vases of the Sesklo horizon of the Middle Neolithic in Thessaly was noted from a level of VII. Other features of interest for correlations from levels of Period VI include: (1) The rim 569 of type 10 with a row of incisions on the swelling is comparable with some from the Athenian agora assigned to the Late Neolithic of the Greek mainland. (2) What appears to be a fragment of an imported vase of matt-painted ware (791) was recovered from a level of Emporio VI. Matt-painted ware is the hallmark of the Late Neolithic on the Greek mainland, but had evidently gone out of fashion by the time of the Final Neolithic there. The Final Neolithic of the Greek mainland seems on other grounds to overlap with the early stages of Troy I. (3) A scrap of fluted pottery (812) has analogies with the fluted ware of the latest Neolithic on the Greek mainland.</page><page sequence="313">CHRONOLOGICAL POSITION 723 4 EMPORIO V-IV These periods at Emporio evidently overlapped in time with Troy I and apparently with the earlier phases of it. There are many points of resemblance between the pottery of Emporio V-IV and that of Troy I. In an even stronger sense perhaps than during Periods VII-VI Emporio was now part of the same culture area as the Troad. Nevertheless, as might be expected, certain local differences can be detected. Thus in Troy I and at Thermi bowls rarely if ever have true handles, but these are common on bowls of Emporio V-IV. The trumpet lugs, however, standard on bowls in Troy I and at Thermi, are also found on bowls of Emporio V-IV, although they are not as common as handles. This predominance of handles on bowls might be taken as evidence that Emporio V-IV corresponded in time, not to the earlier phases of Troy I, but to the end of it or later. Thus French, Pottery Groups, Notes on Table fig. 1 8, equates the Period IV destruction level at Emporio with Troy II. But handles do in fact occur on bowls of the much earlier Kum Tepe I A phase in the Troad. Thus the rarity of handles on bowls of Troy I may reflect some local fashion. In any case the evidence suggests that Emporio II is to be equated with a late phase of Troy I and early Troy II, making Emporio V-IV contemporary with the earlier phases of Troy I. Type g bowl rims are hardly attested before Period VI at Emporio, but they abound there in Periods V-IV and are still common in Emporio II. Bowls with such rims (Trojan shape A 12) were more common than any other type in the Early and Middle Subperiods of Troy I, but they had become rare by the end of the Late Subperiod. At Poliochni, with a pottery tradition which in these early periods seems to have developed to a large extent independently of that in the Troad, rims of type 9 were very rare; but most of the few examples noted came from levels of the evolved Blue period which should correspond to the earlier stages of Troy I. At Alishar the most numerous and characteristic type 9 bowl rims seem to come from deposits of the Chalcolithic, although type 9 rims were still at home in the Copper Age there. This suggests that the Chalcolithic of the Alishar region may in fact overlap with Troy I. Type 9 rims were at home at Tarsus in Early Bronze II, but not it seems in Early Bronze I; those illustrated from levels of Tarsus Early Bronze II look very comparable with ones from Emporio V-IV. On the Greek mainland type 9 rims occur in deposits assigned to the Late Neolithic and to Early Helladic I, and are standard on bowls of Early Helladic II. This is in harmony with the view that the earliest phases of Troy I overlap with some part at any rate of the Greek Late Neolithic, although the Middle and perhaps Late Subperiods are contemporary with Early Helladic II. Rims assignable to type 9 appear to be attested in the earliest phases of Gumelni^a and Säleuta in Romania, suggesting that these may not go back before the beginning of Troy I. Bowl rims of the distinctive type 13 were common in Periods V-IV at Emporio, but were even better represented in Emporio II. This type is included together with Emporio type 12 in Trojan shape A 6, which was at home in Troy I but not later. Type 13 bowl rims are already attested, although they are rare, in levels of Emporio VII and VI. There are also some rims of this type assignable to the earlier horizon at Ayio Gala. Such rims occur at Beycesultan from the beginning of the Late Chalcolithic there. In Thessaly they are at home from the end of the Early Neolithic (Presesklo) into the Middle Neolithic (Sesklo) . The type may be derived from a variety of rim found in Middle and Late Halafware (e.g. Mellaart, Neolithic Near East 163 fig. 98, 167 fig. 102, 168 fig. 103). Dipper cups of type 16 are only attested from the horizon of Periods V-II at Emporio. Cups of this kind appear to be rare at Troy, and ones like those from levels of Emporio V-II are</page><page sequence="314">724 III. EMPORIO AND AYIO GALA assignable to Troy II or later. But comparable dipper cups are found as early as the horizon of Troy I in other parts of Anatolia. In Thessaly and eastern Macedonia they are in evidence at the beginning of the local Bronze Age. Such cups occur at Eutresis in Groups III-IV assigned to Early Helladic I, which may overlap with the earlier part of Troy I. Three bowl rims of the distinctive type 18 were recovered at Emporio, from levels of Periods V, II and I. In the Troad comparable rims (Trojan shape A 14) have only been recorded from the Early Subperiod of Troy I. One such rim has been recognised by French from a Late Neolithic site in Macedonia. Remains of pyxides of type 44 were at home in Periods V-IV at Emporio and occurred in levels of Emporio II. These pyxides correspond to types current at Troy from the Early Subperiod of Troy I into Troy II. Other features useful for correlations include the raised projections with serrated tops of two bowls (859) from the Period IV destruction level. These have analogies from Troy I, from Kephala in Kea assigned to the Late Neolithic, and from the Baden horizon in Moravia. 5. EMPORIO II This period seems to have covered a relatively long span of time. The comparisons for the pottery suggest that it corresponded to a late stage of Troy I and the early part at least of Troy II. ( 1 ) The jugs of Emporio II often have the tops of their handles set below the rim. This feature is already attested in Troy I, but appears to be more characteristic of Troy II. (2) Some Emporio II jugs have a sharp vertical ridge on the throat (e.g. 1575). This is paralleled on a jug neck from Beycesultan Level XV of Early Bronze 2, which appears to be contemporary with an early phase of Troy II. (3) Lids of type 63 were first attested at Emporio in Periods V-IV, but they were extremely common in Emporio II. At Troy such lids were virtually confined to Troy I, and at Thermi to Towns I- III. At Poliochni they were found in levels of the Blue and Green periods which appear to be contemporary with Troy I, but they were not reported from the succeeding Red period which should correspond to an early phase of Troy II. This might suggest that Emporio II fell more in the horizon of Troy I than in that of Troy II. (4) On the other hand flanged covers of type 64 B with crown handles, corresponding to Trojan shapes D 7 and D 8, occur at Emporio in levels of Periods II and I, but do not appear at Troy before Troy II, and are only found at Thermi in Towns IV-V. Similarly at Poliochni such covers are first certainly attested in the Red period, and only become common in the Yellow, both it seems contemporary with Troy II. At Beycesultan covers of a comparable type occur from the beginning of Early Bronze 3, equated with Troy III. (5) A distinctive type of lug-handle in the form of a projection rising above the rim with a large circular hole through it (fig. 106: nos. 8a, 8b) is first attested at Emporio in Periods V-IV, but only becomes common in Emporio II. Similar lug-handles appear to have been at home at Troy in the Middle and Late Subperiods of Troy I and in early Troy II. They are found at Tarsus in Early Bronze II there. (6) The incised decoration of Period II seems best paralleled at Troy from Troy I. It also has analogies on red slip ware of Class A II from Zygouries assignable to Early Helladic II. 6. EMPORIO I Period I with its wheelmade wares seems to fall within the boundaries of Troy II rather than later.</page><page sequence="315">CHRONOLOGICAL POSITION 725 (1) The changes in cooking pots (Emporio type 27) observable at Poliochni in the Red period, corresponding to an early phase of Troy II, appear to agree with what can be seen happening at Emporio in Period I, and less clearly at Troy in Troy II, at Thermi in Towns IV-V, and at Beycesultan in Early Bronze 2. (2) Type 77 of Emporio I is akin to Trojan shape A 43, which was characteristic of Troy II, but rare at Troy later. Vases of this type also occurred at Karataç-Semayiik in Early Bronze III which can be equated with Troy II and with Tarsus Early Bronze III a. (3) Spindle whorls with countersunk tops (Emporio type 15) are first attested in Emporio I. They also make their appearance at Troy in Troy II and in the Yellow period at Poliochni. They are not apparently found at Beycesultan, however, before Early Bronze 3 there. 7. CONCLUSION It has long been recognised that Neolithic occupation on the Greek mainland and in Crete must go back to a very early horizon in the Near East. C 14 dates are in harmony with the evidence from archaeological correlations for this view. The only C 14 date obtained for Emporio was for the Period IV destruction level: P-273 (AJA lxv (1961) 367. Radiocarbon iv (1962) 152) of 3980 + 97 B.P., which is 2149 B.C. with the 5730 half-life, or 2580 B.C. using MASCA calibration. The Period IV destruction at Emporio appears to fall within but not at the end of Troy I. The assignment of the earliest periods of occupation at Emporio to the horizon of the Early Neolithic of Crete and mainland Greece is therefore based entirely upon archaeological evidence. It would be reasonable, however, to expect that the islands of the Aegean and the coasts of western Turkey with a climate and ecology similar to those of Crete and the Greek mainland attracted Neolithic settlement at an early date. The evidence from Emporio seems to indicate that this was the case, and it implies that the earliest traces of settled occupation at Tigani on Samos and in the Troad also go back to relatively early times. Similarly occupation at Saliagos in the Cyclades, with material comparable to that of Emporio IX-VIII, may fall in the horizon of the Early Neolithic of Crete and mainland Greece rather than in that of the Middle and Late Neolithic as the C 14 dates would seem to indicate; the best comparisons for the shapes and decoration of the pottery from Saliagos are with Halaf and the Early Chalcolithic of Anatolia and the Levant rather than with Late Chalcolithic and Ubaid. Early Cycladic I (Grotta-Pelos) which appears to derive from Saliagos was evidently more or less contemporary with Kum Tepe I B in the Troad and with Emporio VII-VI. The long sequence of Periods X-I at Emporio may therefore span the greater part of the Aegean Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, a period of perhaps some 4,000 years from around 6000 to 2000 b.c. on the evidence of C 14 dates. Scantier traces suggest more or less continuous settlement at Emporio throughout the period of nearly a thousand years covered by the remainder of the Bronze Age. Prehistoric occupation there ended in a mature phase of Mycenaean III C in the 12th or early 1 ith centuries b.c.</page><page sequence="316">Appendix A Provenance of Late Mycenaean Amber from Emporio, Chios Infrared spectroscopy has shown that the bulk of Mycenaean amber finds is of 'Baltic amber', i.e. of the fossil resin succinite that is native to northern Europe.1' 2' 3' 4 But there are interesting exceptions: the Vayenas tholos contained both succinite and another resin5 which more recent and as yet unpublished work indicates to be local pine rosin. Without individual analyses, therefore, the origin of new Mycenaean amber finds may be presumed with a fairly high degree of probability but not known as a fact. It is a welcome opportunity to add the amber fragments from a Late Mycenaean deposit at Emporio to the list of Aegean Bronze Age amber that has been provenanced by spectral analysis. The three fragments are of a uniformly reddish yellow colour (Munsell Soil Colour Chart No. 7.5 YR 6/8) . Fragment 66(a) weighs 0.50 g and has clearly been worked: what remains of the original object would appear to be the end of a rectangular piece with one flat and one convex large surface. There is evidence of a probably incomplete perforation at an angle to the preserved short side. The fragment broke off along that perforation in antiquity, for the weathering process, which renders the amber opaque, has been at work both from the external surfaces and from the perforation, so that only two thin portions of the interior, one on either side of the perforation, retain the transparence of the original material. Along this ancient perforation, which is now only a groove, weathering has produced a cleft that would eventually split the piece in two (fig. 306). The fragment is no kin to any Aegean perforated amber bead; it could well be the end of a rectangular spacer with (originally) multiple perforations, but the remaining evidence is too slight to raise such an identification above the level of a suggestion, and one that opens more questions than it answers: all the known Greek spacer beads have two essentially planar large surfaces (though plane-convex spacers are known elsewhere6) and all can be dated to about 1600-1450 b.c.7 and are thus substantially older than the Chios finds. Fragment 66 (b) weighs 0.63 g and is of irregular shape, with the only two remaining original surfaces covered by a thin weathering crust. Its thickness increases rapidly over a distance of about 10 mm from little more than 1 mm at the outer edge to a full 7 mm toward the interior of the original object. The fractures along the edges are all recent and reveal the perfectly transparent interior. There are no signs of any perforations. The piece could be a part of one of the large plane-convex and biconvex disc beads that were common in the European Bronze Age and that have been attested in Mycenaean contexts.3' 8 Fragment 66 (c) weighs only 0.04 g. All of its surfaces are covered with an opaque weathering crust. The piece is too small and too undifferentiated to encourage speculation about its original condition. Partial infrared spectra of 2 mg samples taken from the three fragments are shown in fig. 307 over the diagnostically most useful range of 7.5-9.0 fi. Also shown for comparison is the corresponding partial spectrum (No. 5001) of a piece of Baltic amber that was submitted for analysis by Professor George O. Poinar, Jr. of the University of California at Berkeley in the course of an electron-microscopic study of a fly (Mycetophilidae: Diptera) enclosed in it.9 The comparison spectrum, which has not suffered the oxidative changes invariably affecting archaeological amber finds, illustrates the characteristic absorption pattern that distinguishes 727</page><page sequence="317">fig. 306.

Baltic amber from all other European fossil resins.10 The spectra of the three Chios fragments repeat that pattern which includes a broad, nearly horizontal shoulder between 8.0 and 8.5 'i followed by an absorption maximum near 8.7 'i. The progressive loss of the intensity of absorption compared to the geological reference is typical of archaeological finds and correlates with the degree of weathering they have undergone: the transparent sample taken from Fragment 66 (b) (Spectrum 5010) absorbs most strongly of the three; there is some loss of intensity in the sample taken from Fragment 66 (a) which includes some weathering crust and still more in the sample from the small, shapeless and thoroughly weathered scrap 66 (c) (Spectrum 501 2) . The same correlation obtains for the very vulnerable spectral feature at 1 1 .3 'i (outside the range shown in fig. 306) which is due to an easily oxidised terminal double bond.1 1 The presence of that absorption is a necessary condition for the identification of transparent FRAGMENT 6 6 ( b ) FRAGMENT 6 6 ( a ) 5010 5011 FRAGMENT 66 (c) BALTIC AMBER 5012 5001</page><page sequence="318">APPENDIX A 729 Baltic amber, but not a sufficient one, since it is shared by some Italian fossil resins12 and, indeed, by both recent and fossil copals.13 Further confirmation may be had from the relative intensities of the carbon-hydrogen deformation bands just below and above 7 /i14 (also not included in the partial spectra of fig. 307). The infrared spectra of the three Chios fragments positively identify them as being of Baltic amber (succinite).

S. Savkevich, 'Physical Methods used to determine the Geological Origin of Amber and other Fossil Resins; Some Critical Remarks', Physics and Chemistry of Minerals vii ( 1 98 1 ) 1-4, it seems necessary to reiterate three points that we have made since 1964: (i) All provenance assignments are made by considering the entire infrared spectrum from 2.5 u to 16.0 fi, even though only the most salient features may be reproduced in publication. (ii) The spectrum of Baltic amber distinguishes it from all other European fossil resins, but is not unique in the world: succinite-like resins in North America (J. H. Langenheim and C. W. Beck, 'Infrared Spectra as a means of determining Botanical Sources of Amber', Science cxlix (1965) 52-55) and in Siberia (Savkevich, op. cit. p. 1 ) have important palaeobotanical and perhaps geological implications, but are obviously irrelevant to European prehistory. (iii) 'Baltic amber' is not just amber from the shores of the Baltic Sea; it is a synonym for the mineralogical species succinite that has been distributed by diluvial and alluvial events across northern Europe and into western Russia.
