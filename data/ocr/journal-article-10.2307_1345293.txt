<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nathalie Sarraute and the Practice of Writing STEPHEN HEATH The publication in 1968 of Nathalie Sarraute's new novel, Entre la vie et la mort, confirmed the continuity of work which extends along a clearly defined central line of pursuit. Her five novels to date, together with an initial collection of prose pieces, the critical essays and studies and the radio plays, have a coher- ent relationship that it would not be easy to find surpassed in the writings of any other novelist. This tightly integrated body of work has been produced over a considerable period of time (some thirty-five years), but it is difficult as yet to point to any really adequate critical assessment of its achievement. The reasons for this are complex, and to a great extent the complexity stems from the work itself; from a certain ambiguity of approach suggested by it that, in writing which can be so readily characterized in terms of its coherence, inevitably seems paradoxical. The problem posed by the novels, and here lies the difficulty of adequate assessment, is largely one of reading, and what might relevantly be attempted in the present essay is in some sort the disengagement of the premises for the reading of Nathalie Sarraute's work, an attempt that will not perhaps be without some general interest with regard to a certain history of the novel form. The habitual approach to Nathalie Sarraute's novels is made in the vital context of discussion of the "nouveau roman." Such an approach, however, can also be misleading, as misleading as the concept of the "nouveau roman" itself, which is popularly defined with reference to certain theories of Alain Robbe- Grillet. This is a procedure that has led to the consequent creation by critics of literary "schools" into which the most unlikely novelists, Nathalie Sarraute among them, are then grouped. Simply to call to mind a few important publica- tion dates is to place Nathalie Sarraute at this level in a rather different history: 1938, La Nausee; 1939, Tropismes; 1942, L'Etranger; 1945-49, Les Chemins de la liberte; 1948, Portrait d'un inconnu (with a preface by Sartre); 1951, Malone meurt, Molloy; 1953, Martereau, Les Gommes. The habitual approach via the context of the "nouveau roman" thus tends to involve a focus on purely negative elements in her novels, on the terms of the rejection of certain assumptions basic to the traditional, "Balzacian" novel common to a group of contemporary French novelists (but common equally to more or less the whole range of "modern" novelists, to Virginia Woolf, for instance), and so fails to distinguish the par- ticular quality of Nathalie Sarraute's work. If there are significant connections to be made between this work and that of, say, Robbe-Grillet, they can only be made by considering the meaning of the two quite separate bodies of work for the novel form, and not by discussing the one in terms of the other. Indeed</page><page sequence="2">NOVELIWINTER 1970 Nathalie Sarraute's novels can seem in many respects to demand rather the work of Dostoevsky, Proust, Joyce and, precisely, Virginia Woolf as the proper context for their understanding. Nathalie Sarraute's work stands, in fact, at the opposite end of the spectrum to that of Robbe-Grillet, and she has herself defined their differing emphases: both of them attempt to seize a basic reality, but, "Cette realite je la cherche dans les mouvements psychologiques a l'etat naissant, ce que j'ai appele les 'Tropismes'. Robbe-Grillet la poursuit dans l'apprehension directe, sans recours aux moyens de la description traditionelle de l'objet."' It is open to doubt whether or not this is an adequate account of the tentative of Robbe-Grillet, who seems to hold not merely to the idea ascribed to him here by Nathalie Sarraute of the novel as the medium for cleansing, anti-anthropomorphic de- scription, but also to the idea of the novel as the medium of extreme subjectivism and, finally (the impetus of the writings of Raymond Roussel will be recognized here), of the novel as linguistic fiction, its realism, as Roland Barthes has insisted, lying essentially in its demonstration of the "realite irreelle" of language.2 Be this as it may, Nathalie Sarraute's own theory of the novel is fundamentally concerned with the novel as a representational, mimetic medium, a medium suitable in this respect for the psychological realism that she defines as the aim of her writings. She can speak of the novel in an almost Zolaesque manner as a laboratory for scientific research, and she has specifically rejected the conception of the novel in terms of a self-reflective linguistic structuration, what Robbe- Grillet has called "le roman lui-meme qui se pense" 3: Je pense que toute exploration du langage qui ne comporterait pas, mieux, qui ne se justifierait pas par la creation d'une substance inconnue, qui perdrait contact avec un ordre de sensations neuf, qui se contenterait de n'importe quel contenu, meme naivement banal, indifferente a ce contenu et enfermee dans le miroitement du langage, ne pourrait pas echapper a l'esthetisme, a l'acad- emisme. Her idea of the novel is set out in the series of essays, written "pour me justifier ou me rassurer ou m'encourager," collected in L'?re du soup9on. The context of her work, as she there defines it, is less a recognized tradition than the creation of a new one depending on the conjunction of Dostoevsky and Kafka, of the "roman psychologique" and the "roman de situation." Dostoevsky commands respect by virtue of the insights he gives the reader through his characters into the subconscious world that exists beyond the boundaries of the individual, into the realm of instinctive, impersonal movement rendered, for example, through the spasms and tortured antics of Fyodor Karamazov in Father 1 Times Literary Supplement, 13 March 1959, p. 145.

The conjunction of Dostoevsky and Kafka in these terms brings us to the very heart of Nathalie Sarraute's work as she conceives it and so, necessarily, to the question of her attitude to psychology in the novel. In a now notorious passage of L'?re du soupqon (Paris, 1956, p. 83) she remarked that, "Le mot 'psychologie' est un de ceux qu'aucun auteur aujourd'hui ne peut entendre prononcer a son sujet sans baisser les yeux et rougir." The remark was made, however, in an essay the initial development of which, despite a certain complexity, is evidently ironical and indeed some few pages later the interest of the modern novel is described as its "mise au jour d'une matiere psychologique nouvelle" (p. 94). The stress falls on the "nouvelle"; what Nathalie Sarraute is keen to reject is a traditional approach of the "psycho- logical novel": Qu'entendez-vous par psychologie? Si vous entendez par la l'analyse des sentiments, la recherche des mobiles de nos actes, l'etude des caracteres, alors je crois qu'aujourd'hui une oeuvre romanesque non seulement peut ne pas etre psychologique, mais encore qu'elle ne doit pas l'etre.5 If she clearly separates her work from that of Proust, it is in terms of the close- ness of her focus on the inner dramas of the present moment and her endeavor to "les faire revivre au lecteur dans le present" (L'Tre, p. 98), in contrast to what she sees as the distance in Proust from such moments which are observed "au repos, et comme figes dans le souvenir" (p. 97), and it is thus that she can regard Dostoevsky as a healthier influence. She fully acknowledges her debt to the achievement of the novelists who have preceded her; her work must be "un petit pas plus avant dans l'exploration psychologique: la ou de grands ecrivains comme Dostoevski, Proust et Joyce ont fait des pas de geant."6 The nature of the "matiere psychologique nouvelle" that Nathalie Sarraute intends to render in her novels is explicit in the title of her first published work, Tropismes, for the concept of tropisms is at the center of all her writings: "Les tropismes ont continue a etre la substance vivante de tous mes livres."7 Tropism is a term from plant physiology, defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as meaning, "the turning of an organism, or a part of one, in a particular direction (either in the way of growth, bending, or locomotion) in response to some external stimulus, as that of light." In the world of Nathalie Sarraute's novels the external stimuli are found in the ordinary everyday encounters between B Tel Quel, No. 9, p. 50. 6 Letter to Ren6 Micha; cit.

Man's external life, the public reality of these conversational encoun- ters, is an inauthentic surface that masks a kind of Sartrean drama of conflict (the Preface to Portrait d'un inconnu belongs to the same period as L'Jtre et le neant), a continual attack on and flight from the other. This conflict is neutralized in a recognized middle ground of banality, of Heideggerian Gerede, a "Grenzland zwischen Einsamkeit und Gemeinschaft," in Kafka's phrase. Beneath this neu- tralization of the surface world, however, lies the violent world of tropistic movement-"une matiere etrange anonyme, comme la lymphe" (Portrait d'un inconnu, Paris, 1956, p. 72)-which Nathalie Sarraute calls the world of sous- conversation. Under every phrase of a banal conversation a drama of reception and response is taking place. Phrases from the surface world of conversation act as stimuli, setting in motion a swirl of tropistic movements in which people struggle back into the protective shelter of the next neutralized cliche, thus re- furbishing the fabric of the conversational Grenzland or "zone mitoyenne." This drama is the immediate focus of Nathalie Sarraute's novels: diese kleinen Regungen-sie sind nie unmittelbar gezeigt, sie sind immer innen, verborgen, man kann sie nur erraten durch die Oberfliche, aus der Konversation oder unseren Handlungen, ganz banalen Handlungen. Und was mich interessierte, war zu zeigen, was sich hinter diesen ganz banalen Worten oder Handlungen verbirgt.8 She seeks not to create individual "characters," but to render "un meme fond commun," or, as Gide put it in Paludes, "l'histoire du terrain neutre, celui qui est a tout le monde."9 The feel of her work and the vision it embodies is summed up by this passage from Hugo von Hofmannsthal's dramatic prologue to Brecht's Baal: Our time is unredeemed; and do you know what it wants to be redeemed from? ... The individual. . . Our age groans too heavily under the weight of this child of the sixteenth century that the nineteenth fed to monstrous size . . . We are anonymous forces . . . Individuality is an arabesque we have dis- carded.?1 If individuality is an arabesque to be discarded, then it is clear that similar treatment must be accorded to the conventional structural patterns of the novel. The consequences of Nathalie Sarraute's vision for her development of the novel form are of crucial importance here. The traditional concept of "character," the Balzacian urge to "camper un heros de roman," is seen by her as totally false to the psychological realism she is seeking to achieve. "Les personnages . . . ne parviennent plus a contenir la realite psychologique actuelle" (L'?re, pp. 70-71).

Balzac gives the people in his novels names, occupa- tions, houses, sets of personal possessions, a full complement of external signs intended to fix for the reader their individuality. In Nathalie Sarraute's vision this individuality is seen as no more than a flimsy envelope covering the auto- matic flow of impersonal, anonymous tropistic movement, common to all men. The age of innocent belief in the firm, hard outlines of individual personality has given way to the age of suspicion; the well defined contours of the miserly Pere Grandet to the shifting nonentity of the old man in Portrait d'un inconnu which, by virtue of its "undoing" of the novel form, Sartre characterized in 1948 as an "anti-roman." As few people as possible are given names in Nathalie Sarraute's novels, and there is an absolute minimum of particularizing action: the reader is to be firmly dissuaded from reading them as traditional novels. "I1.. . faut em- pecher le lecteur de courir deux lievres a la fois, et puisque ce que les person- nages gagnent en vitalite facile et en vraisemblance, les etats psychologiques auxquels ils servent de support le perdent en verite profonde, il faut eviter qu'il disperse son attention et la laisse accaparer par les personnages . . ." (L'lre, p. 71). Realism lies not in the slavish representation of the surface world but in the rendition of the deeper world beneath it which gives it its structure. Nathalie Sarraute is fond of quoting Paul Klee's statement to the effect that art does not reproduce what can be seen, it makes things visible. These are the terms of her rejection of the traditional structures of the novel: how then can the novelist proceed? She acknowledges Ivy Compton-Burnett and Henry Green as pioneers 1 in the handling of the level of conversation, but the main difficulty lies inevitably in the rendering of the sous-conversation, and this difficulty has remained unresolved so far in the development of the novel: On n'a pas encore decouvert ce langage qui pourrait exprimer d'un seul coup ce qu'on perqoit en un clin d'oeil: tout un etre et ses myriades de petits mouve- ments surgis dans quelques mots, un rire, un geste. (Le Planetarium, Paris, 1959, p. 39) Her answer is precisely the creation of such a language, depending on a set of images and imagistic expressions that can contain the movement of the sous- conversation. Any page from her novels is immediately recognizable because of this language with its series of recurring key terms. The people wear shells ("coquille," "carapace") like the shells of turtles or snails, protection for the deadly struggle that takes place in the arena of conversation-"ils luttent front contre front, engonces dans leurs carapaces, leurs lourdes armures" (Portrait, p. 48). Like serpents they twist, turn, writhe ("se tortillent"), spitting venom at one another, or else like octopuses attempt to grapple one another with tentacles. When some chance phrase shatters their defenses, a repugnant sticky matter spurts out ("jaillit") from them and they flow into the anonymous current of tropistic movement, frantically attempting to clamber back into the security 11Though not necessarily as influences.

Nuit noire. Ou etes-vous? Repondez. Nous sommes la tous les deux. 1tcoutez. J'appelle, repondez-moi. Juste pour que je sache que vous etes toujours la. Je crie vers vous de toutes mes forces." (Les Fruits d'or, Paris, 1963, p. 20). The overall central image of this world is that of the planetarium; people live as though in a planetarium, protected by the reassuringly smooth sham sky from the turbulence of the real one beyond it.12 The basic urge is to huddle ("se blottir") under this sham sky, under the shelter of cliche, out of reach for the moment of the violence that is the dominant reality of this world: "On vivait en pleine terreur," some- one remarks in Les Fruits d'or (p. 172). It is a world not without affinity with that of Ionesco's theater where again everyday unthinking chatter masks a latent and essential violence capable of manifesting itself at any time.'3 Martereau (Paris, 1953) is typical of Nathalie Sarraute's work, and, in its de- liberately explicit and subversive use of a named character (Martereau), affords a very clear insight into the recasting of the novel form her vision structures. The narrator of the novel is a hyper-sensitive young man with a highly attenu- ated grasp on his reality as an individual. He feels himself to be "un jardin public livre a la foule" (p. 27), and this passive malleability makes him a peculiarly effective catalyst in the process of the revelation of the world of sous- conversation. It is the movements of this subterranean world indeed that fas- cinate him, and he takes a luxurious pleasure in observing them, "C'est une veritable volupte que j'eprouve a les contempler" (p. 39). So much so that he sets up experimental situations in order to study the movements in all their aspects, and watches the results with "l'excitation du savant qui voit son hy- pothese hative confirmee par l'experience" (p. 69). His field of observation is also the field in which he is himself a participant-his immediate family circle, consisting of his uncle, his aunt, and their daughter. Together the four of them play a violent game of endlessly changing liaisons; now uncle, aunt, and narrator against the daughter, now aunt and narrator against the uncle, and so on. The 12 This image is explicit only in the title of Le Planetarium, but it is a key image for Nathalie Sarraute herself from the very beginning of her work. In 1939 she collected a group of prose pieces under the title of "Le Planetarium," but the volume was never published. 13 It might be noted here that the idea of the inauthentic level of conversation is also central in Proust. Earlier I used the expression "zone mitoyenne," an expression that occurs in a crucial passage in which Bergson comments on what he sees as the inadequacy of language, its generalization, hence its banality: "Nous nous mouvons parmi des generalites et des symboles . . . Nous vivons dans une zone mitoyenne entre les choses et nous, exterieurement aux choses, ext6rieurement aussi A nous-memes" (Le rire, Paris, 1958, p. 118). The same distrust of language at this level is manifested and elaborated by the narrator of A la recherche du temps perdu, and both the similarity and the difference of the emphasis from that in Nathalie Sarraute's work can readily be grasped. For both novelists the level of conversation (in Proust "causerie," the realm of "parole") is superficial and the task of the novelist is the rendering of a deeper level which involves a work on language (Proust's theory of metaphor, Nathalie Sarraute's creation of tropistic imagery), but of which the object, the nature of this deeper level, is essentially different in the two novelists. Where Nathalie Sar- raute seeks the anonymous, Proust, as the quotation from Bergson will have already suggested, seeks the individual (and it is this that conversation masks); "ce residu reel que nous sommes obliges de garder pour nous-mames, que la causerie ne peut transmettre . . ." (III, 258). "On a entre soi et chaque personne le mur d'une langue etrangere" (II, 522). Nathalie Sarraute's 'characters' are equally alone, but alone in their anonymity, and in a common language that stimulates the tropistic movements that unite them in separation.

("Ces mots, anodins en apparence- mais seuls les non-inities pouvaient s'y tromper." Le Planetarium, pp. 50-51.) The action of the novel is the unceasing repetitive movement of the sous- conversation and the minimal "plot" of the novel-the buying of a country house and the strategy employed in order to avoid embarrassing questions from the tax authorities with regard to the money used for its purchase-is unim- portant except as the context of this action, as indeed the members of the family are important only as the terrain for a study of the anonymous world of tropistic undulation, for "les etats psychologiques auxquels ils servent de support." Into the family circle comes Martereau, the only named "character" in the book. The fact of the name is significant, for in Martereau the narrator discovers precisely a character, an individual contained within a firmly defined outline, "un seul bloc" (p. 101), apparently master of the turbulent subterranean world into which the others ceaselessly dissolve, able to mold it into a hard and durable personal reality. "Martereau ne 'tique' pas. Ce n'est pas son genre: il n'a pas de ces mouvements rapides, caches, un peu honteux, aussit6t reprimes . . . Pas une ombre ne le traversa" (p. 133). The narrator is filled with wonder at the sight of such a spectacle and he derives a voluptuous contentment from the con- templation of Martereau's family photo album, which seems to epitomize his fixed solidity.14 Martereau becomes for the narrator an island of certainty in the sea of fluid anonymity that surrounds him; "la certitude, la securite se trouvent la" (p. 96). It is the uncle who introduces Martereau into the narrator's world, since he needs him for the purposes of his attempt at tax evasion: Martereau is to buy the country house in his name (note the importance even in the surface action of Martereau as a name), thus shielding the uncle. Little by little, however, Martereau's solidity begins to be called into question. Suspicion encircles him. Does he or does he not mean to acknowledge the uncle's owner- ship of the house, or will he try to keep it for himself? He becomes a function of the guerilla warfare in the family whose members group themselves into factions for or against him. The firm outline of his character begins to blur until he too flows into the same sea of anonymity as the others. As the narrator rue- fully remarks at the end of the novel, "cela fremit en lui, se souleve, bouillonne, tourbillonne, myriades de particules infimes, mondes qui gravitent, cela deferle de lui sur moi, ce que je redoutais" (p. 285). The dissolution of Martereau is the essence of the novel: the arabesque of individuality is discarded before the very eyes of the reader to make way for, on Nathalie Sarraute's terms, the more profoundly realistic study of the impersonal life. The formal problem that Nathalie Sarraute faces in Martereau lies in the structure of the narrative. In L'lre du soupqon she argues in favor of the first person singular narrative form, since with such a form "le lecteur est d'un coup 14 Photographs have, of course, a quite opposite effect for Proust's narrator or for Virginia Woolf's characters for whom they evoke not solidity but, on the contrary, the passage of time. 107</page><page sequence="8">NOVELJWINTER 1970 a l'interieur, a la place meme oiu l'auteur se trouve, a une profondeur oiu rien ne subsiste de ces points de repere commodes a l'aide desquels il construit les personnages. II est plonge et maintenu jusqu'au bout dans une matiere anonyme comme le sang, dans un magma sans nom, sans contours" (p. 74). The "je" functions, as it were, as a midway stage between the author's voice and that of a Balzacian "personnage," floating responsively on the swirling sea of tropistic movement. There is some falling away from this conception in Martereau: the narrator is at once a seismographic register of the sous-conversation, a role akin to that of the novelist herself and that involves him in the same problems of rendition that beset her ("je ne peux que retrouver par bribes et traduire gauchement par des mots ce que ces signes representent" p. 34), and also situ- ated within the world recorded to some extent as a definite individual, as the nephew caught in a particular action, minimal though it may be. There is con- siderable awkwardness about the status of the narrator and this awkwardness is felt especially in the context of a central device of Nathalie Sarraute's tech- nique, the repetition of the same conversational scene over and over again in order to capture the movements of the sous-conversation underlying the outward responses of all the participants. It is not surprising that in Le Planetarium and, above all, in Les Fruits d'or Nathalie Sarraute modified this narrative form to a considerable extent, moving away especially from a central narrator figure. In Les Fruits d'or there are no named characters and no action; the book simply records the cocktail party small-talk that greets the appearance of a novel called "Les Fruits d'or" and the myriad tropistic movements that eddy beneath it. The "je" here becomes truly disengaged, passing from present speaker to present speaker in the conversations, and while it may well be possible to identify one or two groups of speakers with some small degree of continuity, this is of negative importance: what is important is the sous-conversation which is here rendered completely within its own right. Anonymity has become the scope of the novel. This definition of the scope of the novel in terms of the representation of autonomous impersonal experience poses crucial problems that have to be faced in any critical assessment of Nathalie Sarraute's work in connection with its relationship to the novel form, and certain obvious criticisms can be indicated readily enough from within the context of the novel form's history, a context which Nathalie Sarraute's theory can seem to justify. One can, then, question the value of her achievement. The exclusive focus on the impersonal intention- ally works against the individual, denying the possibility of the creation of distinguishing patterns and perspectives. Furthermore, it involves a concomitant denial of time, and hence of narrative. Time is "une eau dormante au fond de laquelle s'elaborent de lentes et subtiles decompositions" (L'?re, p. 65). The novels are structured to portray an endless series of present moments ("was ich versuche-es sind Augenblicke"15), the motionless movements in the stag- nant pool of time: thus the repetition of conversational scenes from every angle 15 Der Monat, p. 28. io8</page><page sequence="9">STEPHEN HEATH NATHALIE SARRAUTE in order to render all the underlying movements, "the moment whole," to use an expression of Virginia Woolf's.'6 The idea of meaningful development of time, the continuity of narrative, is necessarily missing from her novels, since all moments are the same at the level of sous-conversation. The sameness is contained in the language with its sets of recurring images and its sliding pro- nouns. It is worth calling to mind here a famous passage in a letter from Lawrence to Edward Garnett, concerning Lawrence's intentions in the writing of The Rainbow: You mustn't look in my novel for the old stable ego of character. There is another ego, according to whose action the individual is unrecognisable, and passes through, as it were, allotropic states which it needs a deeper sense than any we've been used to exercise, to discover are states of the same single radically unchanged element. (Like as diamond and coal are the same pure single element of carbon. The ordinary novel would trace the history of the diamond-but I say, "Diamond, what! This is carbon." And my diamond might be coal or soot, and my theme is carbon.)17 Though Lawrence is evidently a very different novelist from Nathalie Sarraute (one might note in passing that sexual themes as such are almost totally absent from her novels), there is nothing in this passage taken at its face value with which she would disagree. Lawrence too is opposing "character" with a deeper impersonal world, "to whose action the individual is unrecognisable"; his "car- bon" parallels her "matiere etrange, anonyme, comme la lymphe." Note also the dependence on terms drawn from biology common to both of them- Lawrence's "allotropic states" matches Nathalie Sarraute's "tropismes."'8 Yet it is clear that Lawrence's novels narrate an exploration of the relationships that structure human reality, between conscious and unconscious, male and female, individual and society, and so on. The intended theme may be carbon, but in the actual novels it is rather this set of relationships. It is this narrative significance that Nathalie Sarraute has deliberately abandoned in her novels and it has to be asked where lies the relevance or indeed the originality of what she has gained thereby with regard to the development of the novel form. There is a moment in Daniel Deronda when the simple Rex Gascoigne, who is infatuated with Gwendolen, asks her how she would feel were he to leave Pennicote: "Should you mind about my going away, Gwendolen?" "Of course. Every one is of consequence in this dreary country," said Gwendolen, curtly. The perception that poor Rex wanted to be tender made her curl up and harden like a sea-anemone at the touch of a finger. (I, VII) 1 A Writer's Diary, ed. Leonard Woolf (London, 1953), p. 139. 1i Collected Letters, ed. H. T. Moore (London, 1962), I, 282. "The status of the term "tropisme" in Nathalie Sarraute's theory can only be strictly metaphorical. The ex- tension of the concept of tropisms from plant physiology to sessile animals even has been strongly con- tested, and the comparative psychologist F. J. J.

(L'homme et l'animal, Paris, 1965, p. 88.) o109</page><page sequence="10">110 NOVELJWINTER 1970 The image in that passage, an example of what F. R. Leavis has well termed George Eliot's "psychological notation,"19 might have come from the pages of a Nathalie Sarraute novel. It renders a tropistic movement, the inner hardening against the other, the automatic response on Gwendolen's part as she registers the perception, derived from the stimulus of his conversational phrase, that Rex wishes to be tender; it renders, in short, the sous-conversation below Gwen- dolen's "Of course." But the brief passage does a great deal more than this. It distinguishes Rex and Gwendolen. Gwendolen's character, her nature as an individual, emerges in the subtly positioned "curtly" (note the carefully placed comma), and in the cruelly slighting answer to Rex. At the same time, her "dreary country" commands a measure of assent, her England is sterile and deadening, she inhabits the same world that Esther Lyons rejects in Felix Holt because of its "moral mediocrity" (Ch. XLIII). "Dreary" gives the bored, spoilt, inactive life of Gwendolen, but relates also to the whole movement of the novel, to the theme of the need for a firm moral tradition, the need for the regeneration that is Daniel's quest. Similarly, "poor" is both a fact about Gwendolen's char- acter-this is her characteristic condescending dismissal of those she feels to be weaker than herself-and about Rex, who is "poor" in his pathetic attempt to get Gwendolen to respond to his infatuation. The important point about this passage is its complexity of reference, a complexity that is properly narrative and that demands to be read in this way. George Eliot has the movement of the sous-conversation rendered, but in terms of its interaction with the temporal reality of the surface world, with individual and with social realities, the sum of these interactions being the significant form of the novel. It is this kind of narrative realism which, historically, has been a central distinction of the novel, and that is absent from Nathalie Sarraute's work. Has she not taken rather than, as she claims, one step forward, one step backward, since the rendition of sous-conversation can be read equally in the work of those novelists she acknowledges as the impetus for her advance; in that of Joyce ("Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: 'I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.'"20), and in that of Virginia Woolf whose novels indeed offer in many ways close parallels with Nathalie Sarraute's writings. Phillip Walsh's insight with regard to the self in Mrs. Dalloway, for instance, is very Sarrautian, down to the very imagery, and even to the concept of Gerede ("gossiping"): For this is the truth about our soul, he thought, or self, who fish-like inhabits deep sea and plies between obscurities, threading her way between the boles of giant weeds over sun-flickered spaces and on and on into gloom, cold, deep, inscrutable; suddenly she shoots to the surface and sports on the wind- wrinkled waves; that is, has a positive need to brush, scrape, kindle herself gossiping.2' 19 The Great Tradition (London, 1948), p. 102. 20 Ulysses (London, 1960), p. 8. 21 Nathalie Sarraute has always rejected the parallel between her work and that of Virginia Woolf. "Je crois que nos sensibilites sont vraiment a l'oppose l'une de l'autre" ("Virginia Woolf, ou la visionnaire du 'mainte-</page><page sequence="11">STEPHEN HEATHINATHALIE SARRAUTE Raymond Williams has remarked, in a discussion of what has here been called narrative realism, that in The Waves "all the furniture, and even the physical bodies, have gone out of the window, and we are left with voices and feelings, voices in the air,"22 and this description fits even more accurately Les Fruits d'or, where the "extension" of Virginia Woolf in the narrowing of the focus to the impersonal movements of the present moment leaves the reader totally deprived of narrative contours. Williams helps to define a further element of the problem posed by Nathalie Sarraute's work when he comments on "the strange case of the Virginia Woolf 'charwoman' or 'village woman' "whose entrance is accompanied by "the sudden icy drop in the normally warm sensibility,"23 for something of the spirit of this can also be applied to Nathalie Sarraute. It is not, as Williams suggests of Virginia Woolf, that the world of the novelist herself is socially closed in this way, but that this kind of closure is to be found in the range of her novels. The narrator in A la recherche du temps perdu sees the works of any novelist as one total work, communicating one central insight, one special knowledge, and he takes Dostoevsky as his example (III, 379). "Cette beaute nouvelle et terrible d'une maison, cette beaute nouvelle et mixte d'un visage de femme, voila ce que Dostoevsky a apporte d'unique au monde . . ." Were one thus to seek to char- acterize the unique contribution of Nathalie Sarraute's novels, it would have to be in terms of her portrayal of the rarefied, narcissistic world of a particular section of the post-war Parisian haute bourgeoisie, the world and language of Passy and Auteuil. Le Planetarium, its characters maniacally coveting socially and aesthetically unimpeachable furniture and dreaming obsessively of possess- ing the perfect apartment, epitomizes this. The term "character," it will be noted, has crept back into the picture, for the fact that her work can be seen in this way is to say of it, as Nathalie Sarraute herself has said of Proust's, that "toutes ces particules se collent les unes aux autres, s'amalgament en un tout coherent . . . ofu l'oeil exerce du lecteur reconnalt aussitot un riche homme du monde amoureux d'une femme entretenue, un medecin arrive .. . une bourgeoise parvenue" (LW're, p. 84). The portrayal of the totally impersonal co-exists with the portrayal of the particular social reality.24 This points to a fundamental nant/,' " p. 3). And it is clear that the theme of time, crucial in Virginia Woolf (and which is finally behind Phillip Walsh's insight), is absent from her work where the focus on the present moment involves her "characters" in a state of hyper-activity very different from the "stream of consciousness" of, say, Mrs. Dalloway or Mrs. Ramsey. (The differences are stressed in Ruby Cohn's "Nathalie Sarraute et Virginia Woolf," Revue des lettres modernes, 1964, Nos. 94-99). Nevertheless a close parallel between the work of the two novelists could be demonstrated, and the essential difference finally might well be found to lie in a reduc- tion of narrative complexity in the novels of the later writer inherent in her minute study of the impersonal. The difference may then pose more relevantly a problem of reading, felt already with regard to Virginia Woolf as Williams' comment suggests. 22 The Long Revolution (London, 1961), p. 279. 23 The Long Revolution, p. 283. 24 This insight is the foundation of the revaluation of her work by Sartre: "elle croit atteindre par les echanges protoplasmiques qu'elle decrit, des relations interindividuelles et elementaires, alors qu'elle ne fait que montrer les effets abstraits et inflnitesimaux d'un milieu social tres defini . . . ni l'individu n'est vraiment replace dans le milieu qui le conditionne, ni le milieu dans l'individu: nous restons sur le plan indifferencie et illusoire de l'immediat."

Ill</page><page sequence="12">NOVELJWINTER 1970 weakness in the theoretical writings, of which the dubious concept of tropism is a symptom. That Le Planetarium, in addition to the representation of fluid anonymity, also achieves the study of a specific social milieu is inevitable, for whatever the status of the sous-conversation, the very fact of the level of con- versation immediately involves a surface particularity, no matter how banal this may be kept: banality is not some unchanging absolute, but socially and hence historically defined. It is this lack of historical awareness that is so weak- ening in Nathalie Sarraute's theory: man is there seen as a fixed and absolute entity, not as relevantly situated in a particular social reality. This is the basis of the curious way in which she speaks in L'Ere du soupgon of the traditional psychological novel as having exhausted one aspect of man and of its therefore being necessary for the novel to turn to the study of another aspect, with the implication that one day all the aspects will have been covered and the novel will become redundant, and of the lack of interest shown in the theoretical writings in the relationship between conversation and sous-conversation, in the construction of the latter as opposed to its description. In this respect there is one vital area that is all the achievement of the novels, with regard to which, in an age of suspicion, the theoretical writings show a strange innocence-the area of language. It is here that I want to return to the occasion mentioned at the beginning of the present essay, the recent publication of Nathalie Sarraute's latest novel, Entre la vie et la mort. This novel, while clearly continuous with those that precede it, manifestly achieves a kind of narrative realism and, simultaneously, in the very evidence of this achievement, suggests the shift of emphasis it entails from the traditional idea of this realism, thus offering, so to speak, a means of recasting the whole approach to Nathalie Sarraute's work, of recasting, that is, the reading of the novels. Where Les Fruits d'or was the record, at the level of conversation, of the career of a finished novel in the world of literary gossip, Entre la vie et la mort relates, as it were, the preceding stage, the life and death struggle that is the creation of a novel. This theme gives the novel an immediate narrative coherence. By putting the creation, the writing, of a novel at the center of her book, Nathalie Sarraute meaningfully narrates the interconnections of conversation and sous- conversation, of individual and collective, of conscious and unconscious. The same focus on tropistic movement and the same recurring modes of description are carried through from the earlier works, but they are now distinctly ordered round a central figure, the writer (whom Nathalie Sarraute warns the reader in a note on the cover not to try to build up into a "hero"), and the eddying move- ments of the sous-conversation beneath the conversational world in which this central figure moves are given significance in their connection to the whole process that is his struggle to create. The opening page of the novel puts before us the writer and the activity of writing ("J'arrache la page ... Je jette. Je prends une autre feuille."), and the novel closes in the middle of his dialogue with "la seule grande forme" to which he is giving life. The stuff of the novel is his creation, both in the sense of the book he is creating and in the sense of the 112</page><page sequence="13">STEPHEN HEATHjNATHALIE SARRAUTE creation of the writer himself, and the two senses are fused in the connections that the novel narrates. The writer's childhood sensations and memories-his first train journey, a teacher, the reactions of his mother and father to the accept- ance for publication of his first book-interconnect with scenes of conversation in the style of those in Les Fruits d'or-a party given over to literary chit-chat, a visit the writer receives from a group of curious admirers. The changing liaisons in the violent world of conversation, such as were described above in the discussion of Martereau, are present here, but generally and essentially from the standpoint of the writer. It is he who is ranged against "ils" throughout the book, flitting and reflitting rapidly from confrontation ("ils") to conversation ("vous") to alliance ("nous"), always to fall back into the isolation of confronta- tion ("je suis seul dans le camp ennemi," pp. 44-45), and always sustaining the dialogue with the form that is within him between life and death ("elle"). The coherence of the novel can thus be indicated in these terms in a manner reminis- cent of that in which the coherence of Daniel Deronda could be indicated, but such terms are precariously inadequate; they stop short of the novel's reality, of which nevertheless the image is centrally present-the practice of writing. That the theme of the novel has increasingly been the writing of the novel is often a subject of critical comment, and that such a theme is sterile-there is talk of the "narcissism" of the novel-is easily and quickly said. Huxley's Philip Quarles in Point Counter Point toys with the idea of the novel within a novel within a novel within . . ., and there is a kind of clever gratuitousness in the display. Entre la vie et la mort is not, however, to be understood in this context, for what is here in question is, finally, less a novel about a novel, than the act of writing that is the novel and such a "theme" (the term is properly impossible) is not sterile, but, on the contrary, of the most crucial importance: it is, in the definition of its focus at the level of the organization of language itself, the idea of the construction of the real, "le 'reel' (image fabuleuse sans laquelle nous ne pourrions pas lire)."25 This context is the shift that in the history of the novel form is represented especially by the names of Joyce and Proust, a shift which we are far from understanding and of which the "nouveau roman," readable in these terms alone, is a part. The situation of this shift is not to be grasped in traditional accounts of a change from Balzacian realism to psychological realism or whatever, but at the level of writing, the practice of which is now the experience of that practice; "l'ecriture (l'experience radicale du langage) est une question de vie ou de mort."26 Philippe Sollers's phrase, the radical experience of language, expresses the essence of the realism of the novels representative of this shift, and the image of life and death follows with a lucid necessity. It is an image that is evident in differing forms in Roussel, Proust, Joyce, Robbe-Grillet (Dans le labyrinthe), Sollers himself (Drame, Nombres), and, of course, in the very title even of Entre la vie et la mort; an image of limits, the reality of which is structured and grasped precisely at the 25 Roland Barthes, Introduction to Verdure (A. Gallien, Paris, 1967), p. 12. 26 Philippe Sollers, Logiques (Paris, 1968), p. 73. 115</page><page sequence="14">NOVELlWINTER 1970 level of this radical experience of language, whether in, as for Roussel, an ex- perience of writing mining what has been characterized as an "espace tropo- logique,"27 in the research of Proust's novel that establishes, across a play of presence/absence, "grand jour"/"obscurite," "causerie"/"silence," and so on, that is its foundation, the text as the sole possible mode of presence, milieu of "la seule vie par consequent reellement vecue," 28 in the attempt at totality in Finnegans Wake,29 in work on what might be called the syntax of the novel form as in Dans le labyrinthe, or in the activity of writing as here in Nathalie Sarraute's novel. "Herault, heraut, heros, aire haut, erre haut, R.0" (p. 28), the rhythm of the progression of words themselves. "Des mots suintent en une fine trainee de gouttelettes tremblantes . . . se deposent sur le papier" (p. 242). But someone speaks, "Heraut . . . -Mais qu'est-ce que tu marmonnes depuis une heure?" (p. 30); someone writes, "Je reprends une nouvelle feuille . . . Sur la page blanche les mots, les phrases se forment. Miracle. Comment peut-on?" (p. 8). Words and their articulation, all the activity of the text, the principal movement of which lies in the pronouns. Entre la vie et la mort is a play of pronouns; play as game, their regulated and active exchange; play as the full range of pronouns, je, tu, il, elle, nous, vous, ils, elles; play as theatrical representation, their mise en scene in the space of the writing that is in itself all the drama. In a now famous essay on verbal categories and the Russian verb30 Roman Jakobson characterizes various ways in which code and message in language can take themselves as objects of reference or "overlap" one another. To sum- marize very schematically: 1) A message can send back to a message, as, for example, in reported speech, simultaneously a message within a message and a message about a message ("He told me he would come to tea"); 2) A code can run back in a circle into the code. Jakobson's example is the proper noun, "la signification generale d'un nom propre ne peut se definir en dehors d'un renvoi au code. Dans le code d'anglais, 'Jerry' signifie une personne nommee Jerry."31; 3) A message can refer to the code, overlapping with it, as, for example, in explanations of words or phrases, ("The word leveret means a young hare"); 4) Every linguistic code contains a special class of grammatical unities which Jakobson proposes to call shifters and the peculiar characteristic of which is that they cannot be defined other than with reference to a message. It is this last category that is of interest here since it is as a shifter that Jakob- son defines the pronoun "Je." On the one hand, the sign "Je" is, as such, a conventional part of a particular code, the French language, and it changes following a change of code, becoming "I," "ego," "ich" and so on, while on the 27 Cf. Michel Foucault, Raymond Roussel (Paris, 1963), ("II ne veut plus doubler le reel d'un autre monde, mais dans les redoublements spontanes du langage, decouvrir un espace insoupronne et le recouvrir de choses encore jamais dites," p. 25). 28 III, 895. 29 Cf.

Je ne peut etre defini qu'en termes de "locution," non en termes d'objets, comme l'est un signe nominal. Je signifie "la personne qui enonce la presente instance de discours contenant je." Instance unique par definition, et valable seulement dans son unicite.32 The first person singular pronoun, far from belonging to the most elementary and primitive stratum of language, is described by Jakobson as one of the most complex and difficult to handle verbal signs, one of the latest and most trouble- some acquisitions of the child and one of the first losses in aphasia.33 Considering the other pronouns, it is evident that "tu" is similarly a shifter, necessarily linked, as the French authority Emile Benveniste has stressed in his extension of Jakobson's work, on an existential axis with "je," (" 'tu' est necessairement designe par 'je' et ne peut etre pense hors d'une situation posee a partir de 'je' ")34 although on this axis "tu" opposes "je," "comme la personne non- subjective en face de la personne subjective que 'je' represente." 35 The axis je/tu excludes the third person, which is, as it were, "outside," so much so indeed that Benveniste questions the very idea of "person" used in its respect. "Nous" is "je" plus "non-je," whether "toi," "lui," "elle," "vous" or "eux"; as such, it is a "false" plural, a fact rendered by the change in sign found in most languages, je/nous, as opposed to a normal pluralization, je/jes: "'nous' est, non pas une multiplication d'objets identiques, mais une jonction entre 'je' et le 'non-je,' quelque soit le contenu de ce 'non-je.'" 36 In the light of these distinctions from linguistics it is perhaps easier to read a page of Entre la vie et la mort: "Moi je n'ai rien a dire. Moi qa ne presente aucun interet . .. Non, je vous en prie, ne vous moquez pas de moi . . ." Tout ebouriffe, echauffe, je me degage, je cours me refugier parmi eux. Me voici de nouveau l'un d'eux, un chatnon anonyme. Nos yeux sont fixes sur lui. Nos regards appuient sur lui . . . "Continuez. Dites-nous. Vous aviez deja commence . . .

(p. 11) All the action here depends on the pronouns and the shifting series of axes moi/vous, je/eux, nous (je+eux)/lui, nous/vous, nous/lui. The problem, the 32 Emile Benveniste, Probl4mes de linguistique ggndrale (Paris, 1966), p. 252. S3 Cf.

"Vous" (polite singular) is the moment of the slide into the problematic "je," here under the fire of the phrase "Dites-nous," and as such, in the face of "nous," is the passage into solitude and otherness, the exclusion of "il," "II se tait. Sous la pression de nos regards il rentre en lui-meme, s'enfonce . . ." This is the play of Nathalie Sarraute's writing: where then is the unity of its action? The answer lies in the "je," in the construction of the "subject." As a shifter "je" is a moment at which the code of which it is a part overlaps with the message in which it is articulated, convention overlaps with existential relation. Within the given language, the milieu in which man constitutes himself as subject, "je" is thus, as it were, the crucial and difficult point in that dialectic of langue and parole, code and message, defined by Saussure in the Cours de linguistique generale;37 a dialectic described by Merleau-Ponty from the point of view of the individual subject as follows: La parole est donc cette operation paradoxale ou nous tentons de rejoindre, au moyen de mots dont le sens est donne, et de significations deja disponibles, une intention qui par principe va au-dela et modifie, fixe elle-meme en derniere analyse le sens des mots par lesquels elle se traduit.38 This dialectic has a reality, though the status of this reality is not one of direct equivalence, at the level of the traditional distinction with regard to the novel between discourse and narrative, discours and histoire. Each term of this distinc- tion has a set of grammatical categories appropriate to itself, notably verbal tenses and pronouns, "je" and "tu," for example, for the reasons indicated above in their description as shifters, evidently belonging to the realm of discours. In Entre la vie et la mort, however, the distinction is subverted: there is neither discours nor histoire, or, more exactly, the latter overlaps completely with the former in a practice of writing which sets its own image at the center of the text, "Je reprends une nouvelle feuille . . . Sur la page blanche les mots, les phrases se forment." "Je" sends back always to the present of the text before the reader; as "je" of the conversation defined in the unique moment of its enunciation, textually held in the play of its limits, "tu," "il," "elle," "nous," "vous," "ils," "elles," (attempts to construct a hero, comments Nathalie Sarraute in the cover note, will find "un heros, fait de pieces disparates, qui peut difficile- ment tenir debout"); as "je" of the writing the practice of which is the narrative, a narrative that is thus never "finished" but ever present as the moment of its articulation, grasped "entre la vie et la mort," "C'est mort. C'est vivant. Et c'est mort" (p. 99). Writing that is the narrative is doubled by the narrative of the writing, the doubling fused in the pronouns: 87 For a discussion of the legitimacy of the identification of langue/parole with code/message, cf. Roland Barthes, "llements de s6miologie," Communications, No. 4, p. 95. Barthes regards it as certainly acceptable in the context of Saussurian linguistics. 38 La Phenomenologie de la perception (Paris, 1945), pp. 445-446.</page><page sequence="17">117 II a pris pied de ce co6te.

Such a hesitation is not in the individual words themselves (there is no work on language in the sense that there is in Finnegans Wake), but, precisely, in the writing, "les mots he'sitants" (p. 242). The meaning is always direct, "des mots de Ila-bas . .. leurs mots," but always, if the expression may be allowed, hovered, and it is the overlapping of discours and histoire that founds this hovering. Everything refers back to the context of its enunciation, to its representation in the space of the writing and is to be read, as the image of writing indicates, in this space, present as the moment of its mise en sc'ene in a practice of writing. It is here that Roland Barthes's definition of realism, briefly mentioned at the beginning of the present essay, is important. Barthes more than any other critic, as Le degre' ze6ro de 1'e&amp;riture bears witness, has been concerned to understand the shift in the history of the novel form referred to above, which in his terms is a part of the growth of the consciousness of a "'proble'matique de 1'e6criture,"'0 and his remarks with regard to realism are to be understood in this context: Le re'alisme, ici, ce ne peut donc e'tre la co pie des choses, mais la connaissance du lan gage; l'oeuvre la plus "re6aliste" ne sera pas celle qui "peint" la re'alite', mais qui, se servant du monde comme contenu (ce contenu eu-mme est d'ailleurs e6tranger a'i sa structure, c'est-a'-dire a' son etre), explorera le plus pro fonde6ment possible la re'alite' irre6elle du lan gage.4 This is not some call for "irresponsible verbal pyrotechnics," but, on the con- trary, a recognition of the reality of language and of the writer's responsibility with respect to that reality, responsibility the consciousness of which is the basis of the work of Lautre6amont, Mallarme, Roussel, Proust, and Joyce, 2 and which is the situation of the "nouveau roman." Barthes's definition is at the level of writing itself, what has here been characterized as the practice of writing, not at the level of a general rhetoric which serves as an instrument for representing 39 Cf. Philippe Sollers's reading of Marcelin Pleynet's Comme; "pour approcher ce texte nous devons donc entendre par "nous" ou "eux": les mots; par "ii": le langage; celui qui 1'incarne fictivement; par "elle": la pense'e, la page" (Logiques, p. 220). 40 Le degre z6ro de l'ecriture (Paris, 19.53), p. 12.5. 41 Essais critiques, p. :164. 42 The remarkable work effected in the pages of the review Tel Quel has demonstrated the fundamental im- portance of these authors in this connection.</page><page sequence="18">NOVELIWINTER 1970 an exterior reality. These novels that practice writing propose their own rhetoric,43 which is not the servant of expression but the activity of the novel, a grasping of limits within language itself, its mise en scene as writing. The activity of writing, practiced as such, transcends dialectically the limits it defines in that definition in which it is included, as Nathalie Sarraute's text is a play of pronouns in all the senses of that word. Here evidently is the problem of reading, for what a text such as Entre la vie et la mort demands is not the decipherment and recognition of a code or series of codes, as in Balzac where everything is a code that the writing is to read to the reader ("la table est le plus sur thermometre de la fortune dans les menages parisiens. Une soupe aux herbes et a l'eau de haricots, un morceau de veau aux pommes de terre . . . Enfin tout trahissait une misere sans dignite"44), but the grasping of the code of the writing itself (language) as an area of activity (transformation) in the demonstration of its play (limits). There is the radical experience of language, in the reading, "le lecteur est... a la place meme ou l'auteur se trouve" (L're, p. 74), what Valery meant perhaps when he described the ideal of literature as "finir par savoir ne plus mettre sur sa page que du 'lecteur.' "45 Lucien Goldmann (writing before the publication of Entre la vie et la mort) has stressed Nathalie Sarraute's position at the close of an established tradition rather than at the start of a new one,46 and an attempt was made in the first part of the present essay to demonstrate the possibility of such an assessment. Her work can be sighted as an extension of that of Proust, Joyce, and Virginia Woolf, in so far as the work of these novelists itself is sighted in traditional terms, and the extension which her work represents will then be seen as a discarding of the varied elements, the interconnection of which gave the narrative structure of the novels of her predecessors, in favor of a narrow, and theoretically dubious, focus on an area of impersonal and anonymous experience, from which narrative significance is inevitably absent. Yet such an assessment, in the light of Entre la vie et la mort, is deeply problematic; perhaps literally a misreading of the novels, misreading which is a refusal to understand a fundamental change in the novel form, fundamental in a way that is not grasped by the idea of a change to "psychological realism," and which the continuity of the large majority of novels published has masked. The continuity of these novels, whether "social," "psychological," "documentary," or whatever, their innocence is indeed a direct target of the "nouveau roman" in the reactivation of its research in the novel form. The practice of writing is the definition of Nathalie Sarraute's age of suspicion of the novel. 43 Cf.
