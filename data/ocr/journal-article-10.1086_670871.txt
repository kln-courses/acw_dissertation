      <p>Mythology is popularly supposed to belong to that realm of superstition and ignorance that science has been steadily conquering: myths are thus just-so stories projected onto the world by our ancestors, for whom any explanation was better than none. Serious mythologists, however, like artists and storytellers down the ages, see deep significance in these memorable narratives, shaped by oral traditions, that mark people's attempts to construct big pictures and make sense of life. That involves wrestling with mortality, with right and wrong, with triumph and defeat—raising questions that have no straightforward answers. Myth is therefore not primitive (or lazy) science but something quite different, and Gregory Schrempp's title is less paradoxical than it seems. <italic>The Ancient Mythology of Modern Science: A Mythologist Looks (Seriously) at Popular Science Writing</italic> addresses not science as we find it in peer-reviewed publications, but contemporary popular science—or “science writing,” as it is called when penned by established scientists. Looking particularly at John Barrow, Stephen Jay Gould, and George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, he finds in their big pictures powerful echoes of the anthropomorphic stories that constitute the fuzzy, indefinite, resonant world of myth. Behind their compelling rhetoric and efforts to bridge two cultures, he sees science writers remythologizing the cosmos.</p>
      <p>In Barrow, Schrempp picks up the Prometheus story that explicitly underlay Mary Shelley's <italic>Frankenstein</italic>, a Panglossian belief that ours is the best of all possible worlds, and the anthropic principle that puts humankind back in the center of interest. He sums it up: “Conceived to account for art through science, Barrow's fire scenario more satisfactorily illustrates the reverse. Beneath the graphs lies something more elemental: an ancient and poetically powerful tale, which carries Barrow along in its currents. Such is the power of myth!” (p. 71). In Gould, Schrempp finds mythical features in the replication of patterns at different levels, in powerful analogies from diseases and games, and in metaphors and reversals as crucial components in the depiction of a world of contingencies in which we are not evolution's telos. Both authors offer, in his words, “limited findings spun into grand visions through impressionistic moves and the infusion of cultural preferences, political leanings, and humanistic sentiments (however noble these might be in themselves)” (p. 108). He is skeptical about transitions from limited, local observations to cosmic wisdom.</p>
      <p>Turning to the wonderfully resonant and overused term “Copernican Revolution,” Schrempp deals with Lakoff and Johnson and the popularizing of cognitive science and artificial intelligence. He sees a regress as “homunculi” are invoked to account for thought and actions in books and movies that use images from society to portray processes in nature (a classic feature of myth), projecting ideas of kinship, hierarchy, gender, division of labor, and the tension between the individual and the collective. Behind a Comtean view of religious and metaphysical worldviews giving way, as we and society grow up, to positive knowledge, he finds nostalgia for a lost Eden and then reaffirmation in scientific terms of an anthropocentric universe. This is just the comfort that myths have always supplied: we are significant.</p>
      <p>In demythologizing science writing Schrempp is partly doing what the philosopher Susan Stebbing did to James Jeans and Arthur Eddington in <italic>Philosophy and the Physicists</italic> (1937). It has to be said that he does it less elegantly: myth may be a foggy category, but that does not mean that writing about it need be foggy too. It is an important job, because popular science, in the form of science writing and less august dissemination depending on it, is all around us, forming our Zeitgeist. Those working on nineteenth-century science have come to appreciate the huge importance of popular writings, lectures, and exhibitions in promoting public interest and support for what went on in laboratories, museums, universities, and learned societies: it cannot be dismissed as froth or ballyhoo. Science writing then and now did and does not simply mean deserting research in a quest for celebrity, as some crabby colleagues suppose: public understanding of science is vital. But so then is critical appraisal, and for that, detection of underlying myths, metaphors, and cultural assumptions is crucial. Schrempp's remarks about “Copernican Revolutions” remind those of us working in history of science that we need to be alert to the role of myth in our own field: his thoughtful, serious look at current popular science writing is thus welcome and useful and has implications beyond its immediate focus.</p>
