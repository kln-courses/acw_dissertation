The images are very intelligent, but beyond that, they have true heart and emotion. Jessica is, of course, an extraordinary actress. I have had the privilege to photograph her several times over many years: first when she was a young mother with her baby daughter, Alexandra, and then again on the sets of films: Tootsie, Big Fish. And along with her acting career, Jessica is an excep tional and truly admirable human being. She is also a very gifted photographer. When I heard that Jessica made pictures I somehow knew that they would be strong. Jessica's photographs very much reflect her personal ity. They are delicate, but powerful at the same time. They are loving, warm, and extremely poetic. She waits for the perfect moment, when everything falls into place, to make an image. Consider her photograph of a man on a carnival ride in Mexico: he is caught running, in an ideal position to make a complete frame. Another photograph—not included here—is of a caged bear in Romania. The bear is so anthropomorphic: you feel his entrapment and long to open his cage and set him free. This is how a good image can move you: you want to jump inside the picture to set things right. I have been going to Mexico for years, and I find Jessica's photographs of Mexico to be absolutely true to the country's spirit. Her image of a dog perched on the roof, perfectly framed by sky and electrical wires, immediately takes me back to constantly engage both her fellow actors and her audience.

She says: "Absolutely. It's a way of being able to work There are two approaches to documentary photography, completely alone without having to depend on anyone else.
