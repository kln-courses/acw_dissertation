Paris: Centre de Re- cherches Archeologiques, Analyse Documentaire et Calcul en Archeologie, Centre National de la Recherche Scien- tifique, Paris. 45 francs. By Jacques Bordaz and Louise Alpers Bordaz This code for the analysis of pettery shapes is one of several descriptive schemes devised and elaborated be- tween 1955 and 1969 by Jean-Claude Gardin and his col- leagues at the Centre d'Analyse Documentaire pour l'Ar- cheologie in Marseille. This particular code, derived from a study of several thousand culturally and chronologically diverse ceramics, concentrates on a core sample of 1500 vessels of Near and Middle Eastern Bronze Age origin. Gardin's brief introduction to this collaborative study re- fers to the major theoretical questions concerning ana- lytical codes and states the objectives of the project. The main text (45 pages), in which the principles of analysis are presented in detail, is followed by thirty-five tables which express by means of numerous drawings the various dimensions of the attributes and the symbols (primarily let- ters and numbers) used to represent these descriptive vari- ables. In the appendix, the actual application of the scheme is demonstrated by twelve examples from the Near Eastern corpus coded on standardized forms. The brief bibliog- raphy comprises references to theoretical articles and sev- eral archaeological studies in which the code in question was applied to European collectiohs. The limited success that such analytical schemes have achieved requires consideration of their general nature and the specific merits and weaknesses of this code. Failure of ambitious attempts to develop exhaustive universal codes and multi-purpose data banks or bases can, on the whole, be attributed to a number of causes. Archaeologists con- cerned with specific problems of stylistic change, artifact function, or chronology have often found the available schemes far too imprecise to be effective or even totally Jacques Bordaz is an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania; Louise Alpers Bordaz is an assistant professor of art history and archaeology at Columbia University.</page><page sequence="2">136 BOO K REVIEWS lacking the capacity to record apparently significant attrib- utes relevant to their research. Furthermore, since most traditional archaeological classifications/descriptions are made in terms of intuitively derived "types," descriptive schemes based on individually delineated attributes and at- tribute combinations have appeared alien, tedious and, above all, not clearly advantageous. The authors of the present code are well aware of this situation and their intent here is not to propose a code de- stined to supersede all others but rather to offer one cohe- rent scheme of attribute analysis for pottery to serve as a general model in the broader search for more efficient data retrieval and comparative studies in archaeology. Admit- tedly, other archaeologists have in recent years constructed descriptive codes for specific ceramic industries, but the present study, constituting the first published ceramic code with a declared universal application, therefore deserves special attention. This scheme relates primarily to attributes of shape and specifically to those vessels which-having a regular circu- lar, elliptic, or rectangular horizontal cross-section- represent the majority of ceramic forms. Anthropomorphic or zoomorphic vessels, multiple vases, lamps, lids, etc. can also be coded according to this system but not with the same precision. Similarly, characteristics of production and decoration are only summarily included for general reference. According to the code, the vessel is initially di- vided into several sections-lip, neck, belly, base- according to clearly stated conventions of segmentation based on height and width ratios. The code itself is sub- which should serve to inspire greater explicitness and compatibility in future schemes of ceramic analysis. This code is coherent, flexible, and precise and should aid any archaeologist involved in ceramic analysis. The benefits lie in several realms. They range from the funda- mental and critical insistence on a standardized precision in archaeological description to more universal and equally relevant concerns with problems of attribute definition and data retrieval. Accordingly, the initial time investment necessary to comprehend the principles and application of the code (minimum of ten hours) should not be viewed as a deterrent. The shortcomings of the publication include oc- casional confusing misprints, inconsistencies in the direc- tion in which vessel profiles are described, and a lack of clarity in certain of the illustrations accompanying the examples in the appendix. In addition, it is obviously re- grettable that the authors did not choose to develop the incipient descriptive units of dimension, technique, decora- tion etd., although the code does provide a general struc- ture for these attributes and potential for eventual elabora- tion. Archaeologists are increasingly concerned with codes based on attribute analysis. This important publication of J.-C. Gardin and his colleagues presents a sound example divided into five "zones" comprising 19 units which in- clude a total of seventy entries of descriptive data. The unavoidably ambiguous cases are entered multiply on the forms to cover all possibilities and, when necessary, the descriptive dimensions are left open-ended to accommo- date additional variations.</page></plain_text>
