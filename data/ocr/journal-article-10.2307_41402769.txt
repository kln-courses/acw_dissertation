The man poems wanting come to be when a painter they come and , I and see myself headed back in that direction . The poems come when they come , and will keep coming, I feel certain. But what I really want to do with the next twenty years is to paint. I just turned 54 on Sunday and much like the idea of starting to do something about which I have so much to learn. Three years ago we moved three thousand miles to a house that was only one-third the size of the one we had been living in. Something had to go. Many things. Among them, letters I'd been keeping, in boxes and file drawers, from over the years. Personal letters, business letters, literary letters - or, more accurately, letters that arose from my life in literature: from writers around the country, poets whose work I had reviewed, people whose work I had published, readers, editors, agents. Letters from lovers and newfound friends. From my beloved professor, my colleagues, my sons. Missives from people I have never met. I had decisions to make. Shit! The У on this typewriter just went before my eyes (no pun) I hate that! A few weeks ago, the e* similarly disappeared, and I spent $81.50 having it and several other letters replaced. This is a consequence of my now extremely ragged two-finger typing, once superb, which results in metal fatigue (so I understand) as letters awkwardly plucked pile into one another like stuttered rhymes. . . . I am part of a dying breed. I remember filling fountain pens, recall the twice- daily arrival of cream-colored envelopes with the name, town, and state (no zip code) in spidery handwriting under the three-cent stamp; I can conjure [471]</page><page sequence="2">472 THE GEORGIA REVIEW the days of party lines and the distinct spondee of the operator s "Num-ber plee-us" when you lifted the receiver. By the time I was in high school, mail was delivered only once a day and the dial tone was ubiquitous. By college, the world had changed even more. We allowed ourselves the occasional long- distance call- not just for emergencies but for extravagance. The typewriter had become the norm, at least for term papers and more businesslike occa- sions - but just try thanking my grandmother in anything but your own hand- writing! Perhaps my major accomplishment of the past six months is my partially learned but steadily growing ability to think and write on this word processor ; I never was able to think over the noise (or the "permanence") of a typewriter, so I always wrote everything out before typing it up. But now I sit at this thing and simply bang out whatever I feel like saying- then I look over it and edit it a little. The result is long-winded , but you have never been known to complain about my letters' being too long. Can you hear my voice through this dot-matrix printing? Did I lose my voice when I learned to use it? Now we worry that cellphones and e-mail have taken the correspondence process one step closer to extinction. Time zones melt. Gone are the leisurely pace, the ruminative voice, the intervening hiatus, the long-anticipated answer. We expect our connections to be instantaneous. We forget civility in favor of efficiency. When we all speak in 12-point Times New Roman or 13-point Arial, will we begin to sound alike? Now to my real motive, which is to say that if you would have the consideration to write a little less well you would not be so discouraging to others who try to use language. In my early forties, by the time I was having what might pass for a modestly "literary" life, I found myself entering an already antiquated tradition. We sent long, laid-back letters across the country, a long-distance social life based on a common love of books and bookishness. Letters, I realized, were the "other" side of writing. They served the art: in them we could test the waters of idea, exchanging something more than gossip or news as we drank the wine of con- nection; in them we found our counterparts, even as they found us.</page><page sequence="3">JUDITH KITCHEN 473 Your note and the enclosures- gleefully received in the mail today- give me a chance to loft you the enclosed souvenirs from our gathering at Bread Loaf I like to be part of a world in which so good a thing can happen as that lucky afternoon when you all casually dropped in and found a congenial group flourishing! The experience of the whole two weeks is still puzzling to me , but some time it would be fun to talk about it, and to catch up on things in your part of the scene. Out here , we are amid yellow leaves , sunny days , a serene autumn. Who are we after we enter that disembodied two-way street? At once vulner- able and invincible, we willingly peel back our defenses to reveal that interior we name the self At once real and imaginary, we present ourselves at our informal best- even when that best is ornery or argumentative. And we dis- cover a different self for every correspondent. Never more real, and never more imaginary, we become all mind - and style. To continue on Faulkner (I do better in writing ), I read Absalom, Absalom again. It flows well if you dont worry about meaning. However even in this respect he has an exasperating habit. When he slips and writes a fairly straight forward sentence , he throws in a parenthetical statement which doesn't add to the mean- ing and subtracts from the flow. I suppose one could ignore the parentheses but I am a compulsive reader of footnotes and parentheses. . . . As to the characters I would classify them as "purple cows"* They range from certifiable lunatics to neurotic nerds. *i never saw a purple cow Nor ever hope to see one But I tell you here and now Г d rather see than be one Interesting how letters work, bringing to life inside you a voice so far away. They hold your attention and at the same time whet the appetite, so you rush through, skimming, toward the last page where you will see, maybe, how you're supposed to read the whole. How youre supposed to feel after you've read what you aren t yet- quite- reading. And then the slow savoring. In the last years I taught the biography course- by then changed to a course solely in autobiography- the nature of memory was central to our discussions. Have</page><page sequence="4">474 THE GEORGIA REVIEW you read Nabokovs Speak, Memory? It is a beautiful exercise in the nature and function of memory- as is also Conrad Aiken's Ushant -which I recall mention- ing to you during lunch in Hanover This, too, will be lost so soon. Even now, when I tear open the envelope, what falls out is not the tangible personality of handwriting but the still-needing-to- be-personalized product of the LaserJet. Before, voice came already coded in the slapdash, near- unreadable scrawl of one mind or the tiny, perfected loops of another. Quite often when I was moving, I could sort what I wanted to keep from what I would throw away by merely glancing - a recognition of who I was keeping, and who I was letting go. You say your writing is at a standstill right now because you dont know who or where you are at the moment. You must know this isn't a good enough excuse ; there is no excuse for not working and one needs no excuse not to work, but this is probably just the time you should be working. If as you say writing is the only certainty you have, you are subjecting yourself to uncertainty by not writing. Odd, what we keep and don't keep. What it hurts to discard (but we do it any- way), what it doesn't (but we don't shed it lightly). I did not need my mothers round schoolgirlish hand, her lists of daily activities, her words that never struck a chord- not even twenty years after her death. Personal letters remain just that, and they do not have an overly long shelf life. Yet I brought with me to my new home letters from a grandfather I never knew to an aunt I knew well, letters equally quotidian but conveying a mind I would like to get to know - do get to know, briefly, in his lines. And between his lines. Before long, I had tucked away a collection of letters that, if they were addressed to someone else, would make me jealous. I would want something said to me in precisely these ways. As Donald Hall framed it for poetry, they are the inside of one person speaking to the inside of another. You may be feeling that non-fiction is your natural voice, blah, blah, blah, all that bullshit we tell ourselves when were struggling with something. And I dont know, the truth is I don't know whether it's bullshit, I can't dismiss it so easily as that sentence seems to do, you know yourself better than I do, certainly. But if this novel is any indication, it doesn't matter whether or not non-fiction is your natural voice, because if it is, your unnatural voice, your fictional one, is pretty</page><page sequence="5">JUDITH KITCHEN 475 damn amazing. And whats a natural voice anyway ? Half of writing is struggling with unnatural voices , other voices , new voices, different voices. Not all of my family and friends have style - that kind of style - and what I keep of them is something else. Photos, artifacts, memory. But the letters I saved were the ones that engage me through a turn of mind, a turn of phrase; a turn of the head and I'm back there, in an earlier life, chronicling the history of my shrinking correspondence. Thanksgiving was fine. I cooked like a Julia Child wind-up toy and the children were no more full of mixed feelings than kids whose lives were being revised by parental reshufflings ought to be. Of course I can always take the boys outside to shoot baskets &amp; grunt. Male bonding is depressingly easy. Here, safely settled in my new desk, is my younger sons Mothers Day card from - lets see - f d say from when he was around eight or nine, judging by his ability to print and draw. In the top right corner hes sketched a smiling sun and a red single-propeller airplane trailing a banner that says Happy Moth- ers Day To You. Below, there's the ubiquitous childlike house with the sloping roof, the chimney spouting smoke, a tree, a dog (our Seamus, with his name spelled wrong), tiny stick figures that represent father, older brother, him, and me. Inside, the sun still smiles over the same scene, and now the planes return- ing so you can read the other side of the banner, which says From Matt with Love. Hes added more stick boys kicking a soccer ball, two tossing a football, a sailboat, a rowboat, someone fishing on the bank, another dog labeled "?" and a strange S-shaped thing in a flowing cape labeled Super Worm. On the back of the card, however, there's a tear-streaked sun over strangely anthropomorphic clouds with lightning feet, rain pelting down on the scene where the plane, its banner crumpled, has obviously crashed on the roof shearing the chimney, and in the lower right corner a red devil with the words needs no explanation, then an asterisk and the sentence its gonna be a great day! Now that is style! What kind of a mother was I that he could wish me well with a mangled plane and a pitch-dark sky? Whoever I was then, I hope a bit of her is with me still. thank you for the Yehoshua book! Iam absolutely thrilled to have it!!!!! Yes , I considered the timing of that call (my father needing permission forms fathers</page><page sequence="6">476 THE GEORGIA REVIEW work) one of the best oddities ofthat week. It's starting to feel normal, all these great connections through your living room!!! Who am I, inside this record of my evolution? In this one-way correspondence, I am not really there, except as I'm mirrored in the way others address me. Yet I have every faith that if you were to read these letters you would know me: not the writers of the letters (they remain mysterious), but that part of the me I create for others to know. Good golly, Miss Molly! After a long, confusing, task-laden, and hellishly hot summer here in The State That's Banned Evolution (hey: don't even start me . . .), I'm finally getting around to doing Things I Actually Want To Do, and making joyous headway into your book is one of them. I'm not anywhere near done yet, but I surely don't want you thinking I've relegated your expansive, regenerative prose to some secondary level of consideration- far from it- and, if I can optimistically hope that the New Semester doesn't crumple me up like an ill-used tissue sometime soon ... if, as I say, I'm not soon worn down to afine grist, I'll pleasurably continue making my way through the honeycombed recesses of your protagonist's head. Here's what I like: the intimacy, the way the writers have felt, in varying degrees, like letting down their hair. Letting me in. lhe way they talk to me about their work, about my work, about our generic "work." I give them to you piecemeal, a paragraph each from different people, in different times, with their differ- ing ways of knowing me. They include a former teacher, my older son, my (then-future) husband, my quirky-to-say-the-least uncle, an editor, a student, prominent poets, acquaintances, friends. I give you my documented history in its hodgepodge of voices and styles and sensibilities. I agree with you about memoir. It's not enough to experience, even if your experi- ences are extraordinary. You have to convey some of the full power of what you've learned from that experience, in all its imperfect complexity, and in a way that rivets the reader, if you can manage it. I think it adds something if the writer himself is learning as he writes. (This letter is turning out that way! I'm sorry it's long, but I am learning as I write. I figure you won't mind.) In any writing worth reading, but especially in creative nonfiction, the self is only the starting point. If it doesn't have universal resonances, it's going to fall flat. It's so lonely, really,</page><page sequence="7">JUDITH KITCHEN 477 to be a human being. Were marooned inside ourselves. Creative nonfiction is a way into somebody elses head and heart. A way to see through someone elses eyes for a little while. At its best, it alleviates a little of the burden of existential loneliness while celebrating the uniqueness of the viewpoint. Two of these selections are from e-mails- testimony that style does not depend on the medium but on the mind working within it. I'd defy anyone to guess which of these passages was sent on lined yellow legal paper, which on a post- card, which on the flimsy blue waft of airmail, and which on the flimsier waft of cyberspace. What oozes from black ink on rough brown paper, what slips the noose of its elegant navy script. I'd almost defy you to guess the years the letters were sent, so little do they, for all their canceled stamps and return addresses, occupy temporal space. It really doesnt matter what you name the book . If its good it will be remembered by its name , good or bad. Titles bring the work to mind just as names bring a person to mind. I had no control over my name , and your work will have no control over its name , but I doubt either one will suffer for it. So here you have it, my thirteen-voiced multiple personality, full of its excla- mation marks, its ellipses. All my doubts and triumphs, the fruits of my long days of motherhood, my long days of the blank page, blank screen, blank envelopes - filled suddenly with my need to connect. I receive them now - here- again! - as though they had just made their way fresh from both the living and the dead. Relieved of my finitude, they live the full unfettered life of the active mind.* * Excerpts printed with permission from (not in the order of appearance) Jennifer Culkin, Albert Goldbarth, William fötchen, Ted Kooser, Kent Meyers, Howard Munford, Naomi Shihab Nye, Stan Sanvel Rubin, and Reg Saner- and with permission from the estates of Stanley W.
