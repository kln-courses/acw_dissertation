<plain_text><page sequence="1">33 KAILÀSA - THE STYLISTIC DEVELOPMENT AND CHRONOLOGY M. K. Dhavalikar The Kailasa, cave No. 16 at Eilora, is undoubtedly the finest of its class and represents the verv acme of that architec- tural idiom- the rock cut tradition- which flourished in Western India. Although a cave temple, it is a copy of structural monument, and thus marks a departure from the rock-cut tradition. It is the largest and the most complex edifice, having a number of subsidiary shrines in its precincts, and hence an enquiry into its various phases of architectural growth. Surprisingly enough, «o serious attempts so far seem to have been made in this direction save the solitary exception of that by Hermann Goetz.1 Although there is definitive epigraphical evidence to show that Kailasa was executed under the patronage of the Rashtrakuta monarch Krishna I (757-72 A.D.), there appears to be the general view-that such a gigantic edifice could not have been conceived and completed during the short region of a single monarch, and consequen- tly it is thought that the architectural activity at the site was going on for a number of years. Fergusson and Burgess, the leading . authorities on the cave temples of India, were the first to observe : "It is indeed difficult to understand how so vast a work as the Kailasa, with its surroundings, could have been completed in less time with limited mechanical means available at that age. Even allowing all the time this would imply, and granting that all the superflous wealth of the Rathor (Rashtrakuta) prince was placed at the disposal of the Brahmanas, to commemmo- rate their triumph over the Buddhists, the Kailasa must always remain a miracle of patient industry applied to well defined purpose. It far exceeds, both in extent and in elaboration, any other rock cut temples in India, and is and must always be considered one of the most {remarkable monuments that adorn a land so fertile in examples of patient industry and of the pious devotedness of the people to the service of their gods."2 This was also the presumption with which Herman Goetz commenced his study. He stated : "The Kailasa is generally dated into the middle of the 8th century approximately, on the evidence of reference in inscriptions of the Rashtrakuta dynasty which attribute its erection to Krishnaraja I (757-72). However, on a closer inspection the problem appears not so simple. The Kailasa is not a homogenous building erected under one ruler. Its very size alone excludes the possibility of its having been excavated and sculptured within the fifteen years of Krishnaraja's reign. For the narrowness of space and the technical resources then available had to keep in bounds even the ambitions of such a strong ruler."3 Goeti in his masterly analysis of the various components of Kailasa, has traced its development through eight distinctive architectural phases, spanning -the reigns of seven Rashtrakuta and one Pratihara kings, ranging in time from eighth to thirteenth centuries A.D. It is nearly a quarter century since Goetz published his exhaustive study, but no dissident voice has so far been heard,</page><page sequence="2">34 M. K. DHAV ALIKAR and we may therefore safely conclude that his verdict has generally been accepted as final.4 However, a careful analysis of the different architectural motifs and sculpture styles would lead one to question Goetz's far reaching conclusions. The present paper is an attempt to study the stylistic evolution of Kailasa and to construct chronological framework for it. Temple (Figs. 1 &amp; 2) Before analysing architectural motifs and sculpture styles it is better to describe the temple first. The temple proper has a most imposing front which consists of a storied entrance gateway of the gopura type in the enclosure wall having niches divided by pilasters. They contain images of several divinities and among them are included the asta-dikpalas , Siva Nataraja, Narasimha, Trivikrama, Vishnu as varãha, Vishnu with Garuda, Brahma, etc., all of gigantic propor- tions. The entrance doorway is flanked by Ganga &amp; Yamuna. Nearby are a nāga king and his queen and at the base are rows of elephants, lions and vyãlas. On entering through the gateway we find rooms on either side, slightly on a higher level. The front door is flanked by Sankhanidhi and Padmanidhi, the guardians of wealth. Facing the entrance is a huge panel of Gajalakshmi, who is shown sitting on a lotus and is being bathed by elephants. In the open court on either side are free standing life size elephants carved in the living rock. On the left wall of the gopura are carved panels showing Mahi§amardini, Krishna lifting Gòvardhana, and Käma, the - god of love and his consort, Rati. Of these the Mahisamardini panel (Pl.V) is note- worthy because the buffalo demon is shown in it in the human form and recalls to the mind that at Mahabalipuram. The temple has the typical Dravida sikhara and is almost an imitation of the Virupaksha temple at Pattadkal. The edifice stands on an inordinately high plinth on which are carved life size elephants and lions. On either side of the tempie proper steps have been provided for going ,up in the shrine. Around the garbhagriha is a small antarala to which is joined a large sabha - maņdapa which can be described as the nayaranga maņdapa because of the four sets of four pillars which divide it into nine squarish compartments. It has ardha - mandapa on sides and the agra-maņ4apa at the front. The nandi-maņdapa is carved in between the gopura and the agra-maņ4apa of the shrine, and all the three parts are joined by a sort of, rock cut bridge. On either side of the nandi-maņdapa are huge monolithic pillars, about 17 m. high. They afe similar to the pilasters inside the sabhamandapa and were once crowned fey tridents. The entire edifice is of the tritala - three storied variety of the Dravidian order. It would be clear from the above description' that the edifice was carefully planned in all respects and then executed accordingly. There should be little doubt that the subsidiary shrines in the scarp on either side and the gallery at the back resembling a cloister are decidedly later additions and we -shall discuss later how late they are. So far as the main temple (Pl.I) is „ concerned, its planning and even execution need not have taken an inordinately long period, for the shrine, as is known to every student of Indian art, is an almost exact replica of the Virupaksha ' temple at Pattadkal which, in its turn, is constructed with the Kailasanath temple at Conjeevaram as its prototype/ As a matter of fact, the three shrine? built by different kings and situated so distantly from each other, share so many elements in common that there are hardly any other structures which are so</page><page sequence="3">•KAILAS A - THE STYLISTIC DEVELOPMENT AND CHRONOLOGY 35 identical with each other. But at the same time they also have significant differences in the matter of details for Kailasa is more than twice the size of Virupaksha. All the same, in the case of Kailasa the artists were translating a structural temple into living rock. One is simply amazed at the massive volume of the shrine. But once conceived, the task may not have been as difficult as one might, think considering the expertise in rock cutting available in those days. Rock cut art hás been a distinguishing quality of the artisans of Maharashtra for centuries and Walter M. Spink has discribed how they were moving from one site to the other wherever and whenever the patronage was available.6 They could accomplish the task without much difficulty or delay with the assistance of those very artists who had just then constructed the Virupaksha temple at Pattadkaļ. In this connection Benjamin Rowland Jr's observations are pertinent. He states : "Although we may marvel at the amount of labour that went into such a gigantic carving, it should be pointed out that there was probably less expenditure of work in literally quarrying the entire complex from mountainside than would have been required for transporting the cut stones necessary to build it."7 Here the stone masons had to start from the top and for this they selected a spot in the rocky hill with proper configuration. First, they had to dig three large trenches measuring approxi- mately two each of (270 X 50 X 100ft) and one of (150 X 30 X 100ft) respectively, in the hill in order to isolate a rectangular mass of rock in the middle. But considering the configuration of the rock mass, it is only in half the area that the trenches would be so deep. On a fair calculation we can estimate that roughly one and half to two million eft of rock was excavated. If one person is taken to cut about 4 eft of rock per day, 250 labourers can be said to have taken about five and half years to dig these trenches and isolate the mass of rock in the middle where the artists did the carving.8 Of course the carving began right from the beginning when sufficient rock surface was available for the purpose, "or each portion of the carved detail appears to have been completely finished as the work progressed downwards, thus, avoiding any need for scaffolding."9 Of the temple proper, the iikhara was the first to be* completed and not the gateway as Goetz would have us believe.10 After this the work would commence from top to bottom, from the upper storey to the lower storčy and from the front to the interior, and even within the shrine proper from the ceiling to the floor. Simultaneously the work of carving pilasters, decoration on pillars and other areas was also undertaken. The whole work therefore must not have taken more than ten to twelve years to complete. This is of course hypothetical, but is nonetheless plausible, and the main purpose here is to demonstrate that it was not impossible for the artists to execute the Kailasa temple within the short duration of the reign of Krishna I. It now remains to be seen whether the artist really achieved it. The entire monolithic temple with its entrance gateway, the nandi-maņdapa , the couris, the elephants in the courts and also the victory pillars (dhvaja-stambhas) (Pl.I) were no doubt planned originally and none of them appears to be an afterthought, although Goetz thinks that some of these were added later.11 We shall therefore examine the architectural evidence to find out whether it was at all possible to make such additions once the main temple was carved out or at least its upper storey was executed. First and foremost among these</page><page sequence="4">36 M. K. DHAV ALIKAR are the victory pillars ( dhvaja-stambhas ) which, according to Goetz, were carved out in the second architectural phase. But this appears to be impossible for the simple reason that they are not structural but monolithic, and hence could not have been added later but on the other hand, when the long trenches on the north and south of the main temple were being dug out, the area of these monoliths must have been left out. They must therefore have been in the original plan or else they could not have been executed later. Once the rock mass for the monoliths was isolated on both sides, the carving on them was undertaken. Stylistically these victory pillars are akin to the pillaste» carved on the exterior of the temple. In Goetz's scheme of architectural phases of Kailasa, the lion and elephant frieze on the lower plinth of the temple (P1.II) was carved under the Paramara king Bhoja of Dhara (1000-1065 A.D.).'2 Although we agree that the temple was carved from the top downwards, and hence the plinth must naturally be the last to be carved, this is indeed a bold statement. It implies that the temple plinth was plain and undecorated for two hundred years from the middle of 8th century.13 But the massive plinth with a number of offsets appears to have been reserved for carving the elephant lion frieze in the original plan of the temple and it would not have been possible to execute it after two centuries. The frieze seen sideways shows that the animals have been carved in bold relief, nay they are almost free standing and project out considerably. Unless this was originally intended, the plinth would not project out to such án extent. Moreover, there is convincing evidence to show that the episodes from the RâmByaita and the MahSbhSrata were carved on the exterior of the temple basement after the elephant-lion frieze was carved. On the outer wall of the temple on north where some scenes from the MahSbhSrata have been carved on the lofty basement, we can very clearly see that the artists, while carving these episodes, did not disturb the left paw of the lion (sãrdãla) at the corner and the figures near the creature are unfinished. In fact the entire figure of this standing SSrdūla is seen protruding out. On the south side too we find that the Rāmāyaņa scenes in the lower register, end near the tail of the sārdūla. It is necessary to state in this connection that, according to Goetz, the Rāmāyaņa and the Mahabhārata panels were executed during the reign of Krishna I.M Consequently the lion-and- elephant frieze has also to be dated to the time of Krishna I. Moreover, the epic panels must also have been originally planned because they can certainly be said to have been inspired by those in the Virupaksha temple. The manner and style of carving these panels at both the sites is so similar that they can bè taken to be the work of the same artists." The inordinately high plinth on which Kailasa stands is not found in the Virupaksha temple. In Kailasa it was more of an expedient because it was necessary to release the whole temple out of the pit in which it would have otherwise sunk, and only elephants would have served the purpose. The Rashtrakuta artists were certainly not ignorant of the gajathara motif, and the nearest one at hand was that at Pitalkhora which, however, was already a thousand years old.16 And for the Chalukyan artists it was simply a matter of magnification for even in the Virupaksha temple elephants and lions have been carved, but on a much smaller scale.17 Similarly the free standing elephant statues in the front corts on either side of the entrance were also in the original plan and Goetz is of the opinion that they</page><page sequence="5">•KAILAS A - THE STYLISTIC DEVELOPMENT AND CHRONOLOGY 37 were carved in the first phase which he assigns to the reign of Dantidurga.18 Entrance gateway There should be little doubt that the entrance gateway to the Kailasa was being carved out when the work on the principal shrine was underway. It is not an isolated structure but forms a part of the edifice to which it is connected by the nandi-mançlapa (P1.I) Since its upper storey is in line with the upper storey of the nandi-maņdapa which further leads to the agra-maņdapa of the shrine, Goetz thought that only this part - that is, the upper storey of the gateway - was first completed along with the upper stories of nandi-maņdapa and the agra-maņdapa of the temple.19 But it should be borne in mind that the entire edifice virtually does not have an upper storey as such; it appears to be so because of the high massive plinth which was a necessity or else the temple should have sunk down considerably and consequently could not have been visible from a distance. This in itself would show that such a high plinth was already thought of in the original plan of the temple. Moreover, the upper storey of the gopura has a kaksāsana at the front and no entrance is provided. It is therefore hard to agree with Goetz that the so-called upper storey was completed first. The upper storey of the entrance gateway was thus an expedient for the sake of alignment. Although it was intended as an entrance, we do not think that it was quite common even in ancient times. Since the lower courts with the elephants and the victory pillars were also completely carved along with the principal shrine, there is very likelihood of die entrance being provided from the 'lower storey' of the gateway. Obviously, therefore, it was also executed along with its upper part. We are therefore of the opinion that this entrance gateway with its upper and lower storeys was completed under Krishna I. Goetz too is of the same opinion, but according to him the work under Krishnaraja constitutes the second phase of activity at Kailasa since the carving had begun first under Dantidurga.20 The foregoing analysis of the architectural peculiarities of Kailasa, that is, the main shrine with its plinth, the entrance gateway, the nandi-maņdapa, the interior courts and the elephants and the victory pillars, leads us to infer safely that the temple and all its architectural adjuncts were planned as a coherent whole and were also executed accordingly in all probability under the patronage of Krishna I of the Rashtrakuta dynasty. We have also seen that the temple, though stupendous and most extensive of its kind, could have been carved out during the short span of about ten years. We will therefore be justified if we credit to Krishna I as the Baroda copper plate grant, though of a later date, tells us.21 It is bard to believe- that Dantidurga had any share in it for he was fighting battles with his hostile contem- poraries all his life ; he did not even have enough time at his disposal to incise the inscription on the nandi-maņdapa of the Dasavatãra cave (No. 15) at Ellora. On the Other hand, Krishna was a mature man of 45 when he succeeded his nephew in 756 or 757 A.D., and the final defeat of Kirtivarman, the Chalukyan monarch of Badami, was the achievement of Krishna notwithstanding the fact that the expedition was planned and even carried out by Dantidurga.22 After the final victory only Krishna, who must have been impressed by the newly constructed Virupaksha temple in the Chalukyan territory, could have brought the Chalukyan</page><page sequence="6">38 M. K. DHAV ALIKAR architects and sculptors as war prizes to Ellora and entrusted the work to them. Among these artists there must have been some from the Paliava court because, as the Virupaksha temple inscription records,they were brought there by Kirtivarman himself after his conquest of the Paliavas of Kanchi.23 Sculpture The stylistic evidence of sculptures in the Kailasa also furnishes corroborative evi- dence. The enormous wealth of sculpture that is carved on the exterior of the temple and its adjuncts is divisible, at least stylistically, into the following two broad categories : i) Sculptures which were carved in the area especially reserved for them, as for example the Gajalakshmi panel at the entrance. ii) Sculptures carved in order to fill in the vacant spaces. There are, however, a few sculptures in the former category. They are vast compositions which must have been thought of when the entire complex was conceived and obviously they are contemporary with the temple proper. Among these .are the panels depicting Gajalakshmi flanked by elephants bathing her which is carved near the entrance, the Gajasuravadhamurtj (Pl.III) and Siva as Mahayogi in the Nandi- maņdapa. These compositions are gigantic in size and are closely related to those in the upper floor of the Dasavatāra cave 15 at Ellora.24 They are characterised by massive forms and tremendous vitality and, because of their outburst of energy, they almost appear to be stepping out of their frames. Their powerful representations on such a colossal scale have no parallels in Indian art. They share air the characteristic traits of the Rashtrakuta style. Some of the sculptures, however, are stylistically of a different category. Thus the Mãrkandeyãnugraha-murti of Siva carved pn the west face of the north staircase in Kailasa, is interesting from stylistic point of view. It has an exact parallel in the Dasãvatãra Cave.25 Superficially at least both of them have many points of similarity, but the one in the Dasãvatãra, which is much larger, is characterised by tremendous force and vitality, a distinguishing feature of the Rashtrakuta sculpture. It shows Siva springing out of the linga to the rescue of his worshipper - Märkandeya - for Yama. The representation in Kailasa, however, is static and almost lifeless; even the god of death, Yama, is shown in a supplicant's attitude. The relatively slendour human forms and the tall conical headdress of Siva are rather in the Chalukyan tradition. One somehow feels that we have here a Chalukyan sculptor who was asked to copy an earlier Rashtrakuta panel. The same holds good in case of the standing Lakulisa on the south wall of Kailasa which has its counterpart in the Mallikarjuna temple at Pattadkal. There are a number of panels in the Kailasa complex which do not stylistically conform to the Rashtrakuta style, but belong more to the Chalukyan school. This obviously is due to the presence of Chalukyan artists at Ellora since the edifice itself, as is known, was being carved out on a Chalukyan prototype. In fact some of the themes from the latter are to be met with in Kailasa. The narrative sculptures depicting episodes from the epics are present at both the places; they are carved in narrow</page><page sequence="7">♦KAILASA - THE STYLISTIC DEVELOPMENT AND CHRONOLOGY 39 running bands.?6 But there are larger panels such as those depicting the fight between Vali and Sugriva, Jatayu attacking Ravana for abducting Sita, both of which have been carved on the south wall at both the places.21 Similarly the Varaha incar- nation of Vishnu in Kailasa and that in thé Virupaksha temple have many common features.28 Also comparable is the Lingod- bhava- murti at both the sites.29 The figures of Kamadeva and Rati from Kailasa are not far removed from a couple in the Papanatha temple at Pattadkal.30 The Narasimha panel (Pl.IV) has been carved on the south face at both the places. The similarities between these sculptures from Kailasa and Pattadkal show that thfcy were the handiwork of Chalu- kyan sculptors. It must not have therefore been very difficult, but on the contrary easy, for the Chalukyan artists to repeat their performance at Eilora. Paliava influence is also discernible in the sculptures in Kailasa, though not as strong as the Chalukyan. There are two panels, both depicting the Mahija-mardini Durga, one on the north wall of the entrance gopura (P1IV) and the other on the south wall of the entrance corridor. According to Goetz, these are imitations of Chalukyan reliefs. He observes that "This is especially evident e.g. in the Mahisamardini on the north wall of the entrance gopura which is a variation oí a Mahisa-mardini in the Mallikarjuna of Pattadkal, which latter again is an elaboration of the famous Paliava relief in the Mahisāsura-maņdapa at Mamallapura."31 But it is necessary to emphasize that among the various forms of the goddess we find that Mahisāsura, the buffalo-headed demon, was usually depicted in his zoomorphic form in the Chalukyan sculpture whereas in the Paliava art he was shown in an anthropomorphic form as .is evident from the famous panel at Mahabalipuram.32 The two panels depicting the goddess subjugating the demon are related closely to that from Mahabalipuram, and it is therefore highly likely that the artist who carved these two panels in Kailasa may also have hailed from the Paliava country. He might have been brought by Kirtivarman to Badami and hence to* Eilora by Krishna. All this is no doubt hypothetical but is certainly plausible. Perhaps the most important and the most artistic of the sculptures in Kailasa is the panel on the south which depicts Ravana shaking the Kailasa mountain (PI. VI). This colossal sculpture is carved in the Rashtrakuta tradition because it is full of vitality and is marked by tremendòu» movement and energy. But the figures of Ravana, Siva, Parvati and others are not inordinately heavy as those in the Rashtrakuta panels in the Dasavatãra cave and a few ones in the Kailasa itself. In fact there is every possibility of the temple being named Kailasa after this panel as first suggested by D. R. Bhandarkar." This is one of the finest sculptures in the whole range of Indian art and we can do no better than quote Sherman E.Lee, a renowned authority on oriental art. He states : "The composition is treated not only in terms of light and shade in depth, but also sculpturally and representationally in depth - The result is a-massive, large scale composition unique in Indian art and worthy of any great tradition at its peak."34 The crucial question is the date of this sculpture. It has been carved on the south face, cutting the moulded plinth of the temple, and has been deeply inset in such a manner that the maximum effect of light</page><page sequence="8">40 M. K. DHAV ALIKAR and shade can be obtained. Stylistically it is certainly later than the main edifice but how late is the problem. Its location below the rock bridge joining the temple and the first storey in the Paralanka would suggest that it may not have been carved when the bridge was existing, for the simple reason that the panel under the deep shadow of the bridge would have been constantly in the dark and hence would have lost all its dramatic effect. In all probability, therefore, it would have been carved after the collapse of the bridge as a result of which the spot was well lighted. As we shall see later the panel in question is stylistically akin to that in the Lankeshwar portraying the tāņdava dance of Siva. The rock bridge can therefore be said to have collapsed some three of four decades after Kailasa was completed. Paralanka and YajÄa-sälä The rock bridge joining the Kailasa and Paralanka is a convincing proof of the after being in the original plan of the edifice, and even contemporary with it. The kudu motif on the kapota moulding of Kailasa is repeated on the facade of Paralanka; the pillars with ghata-pallava capital in Kailasa are present in the first floor verandah of the Paralanka; and the Andhakasura-vadha- murti on the northern face of Kailasa has an almost exact parallel on the southern face of Paralanka. The idea of excavating storied cave temples was not new to the Rashtrakuta artists; Do Thai (No. 12) Tin Thai (No. 13) and Dasāvatāra are a clear enough proof of that tradition. Paralanka first floor thus appears to be contemporary with Kailasa. The Yajnasãlã, which is on the same level with the first floor of Paralanka, has some exquisite sculpture. Among them are a group of Sapta-mātrikās (actually eight) with Ganeta, Durga, Kala and Kali (PI, VII) and on the east are a queen flanked by chāmara dhārinis and a dwarf (gana). All these figures have shed the heaviness which marks the sculpture in the DasSvat£ra and have consequently gained elegance, but at the same time they have nothing, of the attenuated forms of the Chalukyan sculpture in the Virupaksha temple. They are, however, related to the representations of Ganga and Yamuna on the doorway of the garbha-griha of Kailasa itself. Although many of the statues in the YajiTasälä are badly multilated, they exhibit the refinement in the female form achieved by the Rashtrakuta artist. "They are amongst the most glorious works of Indian sculpture of an overwhelming might, vivacity and beauty" observes Goetz, who further adds that here "vitality and refinement meet in a poised exuberance."35 There is no evidence to suggest that the yajnasãlã was in the original plan and it therefore appears to be an afterthought. But much time must not have elapsed between the two, and the Y ajfta&amp;lá can be dated to the last quarter of the 8th century. Goetz also dates it to the period of Govinda III (793-814), but on different grounds. He found certain Pratihara influence on the art of the time of Govinda III, but the prototypes cited by him such as the sculptures from the temple at Osian in Rajasthan have hardly anything to compare with those in the Yajnasalã.31 The Pratihara sculpture, though elegant and vivacious, displays far too slender forms and we can feel that a certain degree of stylization, which marks the early mediaeval sculpture, has already set in.38 The sculpture in the YajHasãlá is free from such stylization and may not therefore be later than Circa 800 A.D.</page><page sequence="9">Fig- 1 : Kailasa, El lora , plan of ground floor.</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 2 : Kailasa, Ellora, plan of upper floor.</page><page sequence="11">$ - i&gt; - «o d) c 0) O (O (O J0 CO 0) •M - 0.</page><page sequence="12">sz c E 0) -C H (0 v&gt; jO (D 4) •W jfl IL</page><page sequence="13">i 5 Tl § S t5 e (O Z o &gt;» ® o W 0) £ 0 &lt;D .C C C 3 S 1 (D SZ 73 CD &gt; (O 3 CO &lt;0 (O O t (O CO JO rö SC O -M J2 E</page><page sequence="14">Plate IV ; Kailasa - Narsimha-Killing Hiranykasypa</page><page sequence="15">Plate V : Kailasa - Mahisa-Mardim Durga</page><page sequence="16">Plate VI ; Kailasa - Ravana shaking Kailas</page><page sequence="17">Plate VII : Kailasa - Durga, Kali and Kala in Y ajna-sala</page><page sequence="18">Plate VIII : Kailasa - Siva dancing tandava in Lankeshwar</page><page sequence="19">•KAILASA - THE STYLISTIC DEVELOPMENT AND CHRONOLOGY 41 Lankeshwar The Lankeshwar cave, carved in the northern escarpment of Kailasa, is a unique edifice in many respects. Stylistically it marks a further stage of development of the Rashtrakuta art nay it is the very acme of the early mediaeval art of Maharashtra. Its plan is similar to that of Kailasa, a large hall supported by four sets of four pillars each and the rectangular garbha-griha at the back around which a pradaksiņā-patha is provided. The pillars are remarkable in that they are squat or stumpy and more massive than those in Kailasa, and their decoration- is more florid too. They must have served as prototypes for those in the Indra Sabha and Jagannath Sabha of the Jain group. The figure sculpture in Lankeshwar has undergone a noticeable change which is best illustrated by the famous panel showing the tāņdava dance of Siva. (PI VIII) It is no doubt conceived after the Daáavatâra prototypes but has none of their heaviness. Here the supreme Lord is at once elegant and agile and has electrifying energy. The twisted body in the tribhanga posture as if in a somersault has a solitary parallel at Ellora where in the scene showing Ravana shaking Kailasa on the southern face of the principal shrine, one of the female attendants of Parvati is seen running in panic with her body squirmed in a similar fashion. This betrays the stylistic relationship between the two panels, but the similarity cannot be stretched beyond this. Although the figure is badly mutilated below the waist, this Nataraja is perhaps the one of the finest of its class. The massive pillars, though akin to those in Kailasa, have a facted and ghata- pallava shaft and cushion capital and also sometimes have female figures on brackets which are reminiscent of much earlier Chalukyan brakcet figures at Badami. There is neither epigraphic nor much stylistic evidence to securely date lhe Lankeshwar but the beginning of 9th century may not be far off the mark in view of the similarity of pillar types in Indra Sabha, which is dated to the close of 8th or the beginning of 9th century.39 The Shrine of the River Goddesses In the northern face of the rock on the left and to the west of Lankeshwar is the shrine of the river goddesses which contains images of Ganga in the middle and Yamuna and Saraswati on her left and right respectif vely. Although the river goddesses are soror- what worn out and have lost some ©fcťheir relief features, they are all extremeķ$elegant, and mark a further advance of thè Rashtra- kuta art. They each stándina highly orna- mental arch issuing out of the mouths of cro- codiles- makara-torana- which is distantly related to the Chalukyan prototype whereas the elongated female fingures are remini- scent of the Chalukyan tradition. Their slender forms with attenuated waists have % close parallels in the female attendants of Matanga and Siddhayika in the Jaina group at Ellora,40 which, however, lack the delicate and sensitive modelling of the river goddesses. Only Indrāni from the Indra Sabha approaches Ganga to some extent, so far as the sensous form is concerned.41 It is quite likely that this shrine was carved by Govinda III in order to commemmorate his victories in north India, where the three mightly rivers meet at Prayag. The shrine may therefore be assigned to the first half òf 9th century. Gallery at the back On level with the ground floor of the main temple is carved a gallery which surrounds</page><page sequence="20">42 M. K. DHAV ALIKAR the entire back half of the court. The back wall of the gallery is divided into compartments by means of pilasters each containing a sculptured panel. There are forty -three such panels, all of gigantic proportions reminiscent of those in the DaÜvatära.They represent several forms of Siva, Vishnu and Sakti and are of great iconographical interest. They are all characterised by overelongated forms, extremely slender bodies and tall conical headdresses which are to be noticed in the late Paliava and early Chola art. They can therefore be dated to late 9th century. Goetz has assigned them to late 12th*l3th century A.D. because he is of the opinion that they are comparable with the late Chola sculptures. This would be patently absurd because if such a late date is accepted, we should be able to find in them those traits which are met with the Yadava temple sculpture. But that not being the case, the late date has to be rejected. We are of the opinion that the artistic activity at Ellora comes to a grinding halt by the middle of 9th century or precisely with the death of Krishna III (839-868) who was the last great monarch of the Rashtrakuta dynasty. The considerable southern influence on the sculptures in the back gallery was undoubtedly due to the southern conquests of Govinda III (793-814); he had overthrown the Cholas, captured Tanjore and marched down south to Rameshwar and had in fact annexed the northern portions of the Chola territories to his empire.42 The foraging analysis of the architectural and the sculptural peculiarities of the Kailasa complex shows that the principal shrine Kailasa with its gateway, nandi- mandapa, the so-called lower storey, the elephant-lion frieze, elephants in the courts and the victory pillars were all executed during the reign of Krishna I (757-72). We have also seen how it was possible to carve such a stupendous edifice - of the size of Parthenon in Athens - during a short span of 12 to 15 years. Its architect was therefore justified in singing he praise of its divine character as described in the Baroda copper plate grant of Karka II. Knfl«« in mediaeval times Although the rock temple is commonly known as Kailasa, it seems that in the mediaeval times it was popularly known as Manikeshwar and perhaps earlier still as Ghrishneshwar, and was regarded as one of the twelve jyotirlingas. The Baroda copper plate grant refers to the edifice as Kailasa and compares it with the Himalayan abode of Siva, and describes it as svayambhu implying thereby its divine character Consequently it came to be worshipped as a jyotirlinga. But the present temple known as Ghrishneshwar is a late mediaeval structure built by Ahilyabai Holkar (1765-95), a pious princess of Indore state. It is worshipped even today by Hindus who believe that it is a jyotirlinga. But the present temple known as and there are ao traces of any earlier remains, it is hard to believe that it is the original jyotirlinga and was named m Ghrishneshwar because the shrine was chiselled out of living rock.43 The original lingam was destroyed by Muslims in mediaeval times and hence a new temple was by Ahilyabai. There is considerable literary evidence of the mediaeval period which refers to this rock temple as the Manikeshwar cave temple, because it was built by a certain queen Manikavati of the King of Elapura.44 The story goes that a certain king of Alajapura (modern Ellichpur in Amaravati</page><page sequence="21">•KAILASA- THE STYLISTIC DEVELOPMENT AND CHRONOLOGY 43 District, Maharashtra) had committed a certain sin in his previous birth, and as a result, was suffering from some incurable disease. Curiously enough, the king suffered from the disease only during the night whereas during day time he was his normal healthy self Once the king went on a hunting expedition to Mahisamala (Mhai- samala near Ellora) and bathed in the tank at that place. After bath he found that he was cured of the disease probably because the sin which he had committed in his previous birth was washed off. The queen, who had accompnied the king, worshipped the god Ghrishneshwar at Elapura (Ellora) and took a religious vow that if the king was cured, she would build a temple in the honour of Siva. Naturally therefore when the king was cured, she requested the king to build the temple immediately. She decided to observe fast until she saw the sikhara of the temple. The king agreed, but no architect on earth would have been able to build the temple is such a short time. The king summoned many artists, but they all said that it would take at least sixteen months to build a temple complete with its sikhara. There was, however, one šilpi who would do the job; he was one Kokasa, a resident of Paithan near Aurangabad (ancient Pratishthan), but he would not start his day without a bath in the Godavari. He was summoned and the king told him his predicament. Kokasa accepted the challenge and assured the king that the queen could have the daiSana of the iikhara within a week's time. Kokasa then began to carve, out the rock temple which naturally had to begin from the top. He completely carved out the sikhara within a week and saved the royal couple from their predicament. The temple was then named after the queen as Manikeshwar and the king established a settlement at the site which was named after him as Elapura (modern Ellora). The Master Artist Kokasa Although the Baroda copper plate grant refers in glowing terms to the achievement of the master artist of Kailasa, it does not record his name. It has generally been thought, because of the striking similarity between Kailasa and the Virupaksha temple at Pattadkal, that in all probability the very same artists who built the latter edifice were responsible in the carving of the former. But the Virupaksha temple inscription, as already seen, does make a mention of its architect, one Sutradhārī Gunda, who has been described as the greatest silpi of South India. If he had been entrusted with the work at Kailasa, his name certainly would have occurred in some inscription in the temple. That not being the case, we can be certain that Gunda was not the Silpin of Kailasa. The mediaeval Marathi literature, as shown above, mentions the name of one Kokasa, a vãdhiya i.e. a carpenter ( Vardhakin Sk. badhai Hindi vãdhiya Marathi) who has been described as an incarnation of Visvakarma.45 He was an inhabitant of Paithan but at one place he is said to have been living at Puntambe (Taluq Rahuri, Ahmednagar District, Mahara- shtra).46 This indicates that the name of the" master artist of Kailasa traditionally did survive even after five ôr six centuries. It should also be mentioned in this connection that there are some inscriptional records in Central India datable to 11th to 13th century A.D. which mention the names of some sculptors who were born in the illustraious family of Kokasa.47 It is therefore not unlikely that the family or the successors of Kokasa later shifted their activity to central India where they found work.</page><page sequence="22">44 M.

An inscription in the Virupaksha temple records that it was built by Sutradhari Gunda, the greatest silpin of the southern country, for Lokamahadevi, the queen of the Chalukyan king Vikramaditya II in commemmoration of his conquest of Kanchi {I A, X, p. 162) whereas a copper plate grant of Kirtivarman II, son of Vikramaditya II, mentions that the latter was highly impressed with the sculptures in the Rajasimheshwar temple. He therefore made lavish gifts to the temple and overlaid some sculptures with gold. He was thus struck by the temple at Kanchi (South Indian Inscriptions, I, p. 147). 6.

It should be noted that the Baroda copper plate grant which so vividly describes the grandeur of the Kailasa rock temple, was issued in 812-13 A.D. This would imply that the entire temple complex except the shrines in the northern and southern escarpments and the gallery at the back was completed long before the close of 8th century.

Kirtivarman was ruling as late as 757 A.D., that is, three years after the last known after the last known date of Dantidurga and one year before the first known date of Krishna I and hence the final defeat of the Chalukyan king was obviously the achievement of Krishan I. 23. IA, X, p. 162; South Indian Inscriptions, 1, 147. 24. The Datívatãra cave temple has been attributed to Dantidurga because of a fragmentary inscription on the nandi-maridapa, a monolithic shrine which has been carved out in the courtyard of that cave. The record itself is incomplete and would suggest that it was incised when probably the mantfapa only was carved out while the work on the cave proper was underway. We have already seen that Dantidurga's campaigns would have left him very little leisure to devote time to arts and hence we would like to suggest that even the Da&amp;vatára cave which may have begun under Dantidurga, was completed under Krishna I. This would explain the similarity between the sculptures in the Daéivatâra and Kailasa; in fact Sometimes we come across the same motifs executed in an almost identical manner. Thus the nidhis on the sikaara of the nandi-mantfapa of DasfivatSra at the four cardinal points have exact parallels in the iikhara of the front porch of Kailasa. See Jas.
