<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ACTIVITIES OF THE MISSIONARIES AMONG THE CHEROKEES.* LINTON McGEB COLLINS, M. A. The Cherokee Indians derived their name from "Che- ra," meaning fire, according to Adair, which was their re- puted lower heaven.1 According to the Report of the Bu- reau of Ethnology, their tribal name is a corruption of Tsalagi, or Tsaragi, the name by which they commonly call- ed themselves, and which may be derived from the Choc- taw "Chilukke," meaning "cave people," in allusion to their numerous caves in their mountainous country. They were a branch of the Iroquois Indians. At one time the Cherokee Nation was the largest single tribe of Indians in America. Their territory in the six- teenth century, when first known, consisted of all the south- ern part of the Appalachian Mountains, embracing the Ohio River on the North, extending South to the head- waters of the Savannah and Broad Rivers in Georgia and South Carolina, and as far west as the Tennessee (or Cherokee) River and its tributary streams, from their sources down to the vicinity of Muscle Shoals.2 The natives made two divisions of their country - "Ayrate," low and "Ottare" Mountainous.3 The former was on the headwaters of the Savannah River; the latter on the eastern-most rivers of the great Mississippl. Their towns were always close to a river or creek. The lan- guage had three principal dialects : Elati, or lower ; middle and Atali, mountain or upper. On the west side of the Savannah River, the Cherokees were confronted on the south by the Creeks, the division * Presented at the Eighty-Third Annual Meeting of the Georgia Historical Society, April 12, 1922. 1.

He engaged in several combats with them, seeking and digging metal, especially gold, in their country. But it was not until one hundred and fifty years later, that any relations with the colonists were begun. Royce said that traders from Virginia moved among them as early as 1540. About that time there were eight thousand within the nation. In 17 15 they were estimated in number about eleven thousand, two hundred and ten, including four thousand warriors, and living in thirty villages.2 In 1729 they were computed to number twenty thousand, distributed in sixty four towns, and affording at least six thousand warriors.3 Adair said that in 1735 they were a "very numerous and potent nation, with at least sixty four towns and villages, populous and full of women." In 1739 they are said to have received a "most depop- ulating shock by the small-pox" and rum, which according to Adair, reduced them one half after a years time. The weight of authority is that they lost one thousand warriors. This decrease was steady until after the Revolutionary War, for they lost heavily in the encounters with the whites. In 1 8 10 the state of Georgia was composed of thirty nine counties, with a population of approximately 225,000. The Cherokees occupied 16,815 square miles, their terri- tory being one hundred and sixty miles and ninety-nine and one half miles broad. The Creeks at that time occupied fourteen thousand nine hundred and eighty one square miles, which was one hundred and forty two miles long, by one 1. Antiquities of Southern Indians - 0. C.

Therefore, the area of Georgia that was laid out by white people, was fifteen thou- sand one hundred and thirty four square miles, one hun- dred and fifty miles long by thirty miles across. This was less than one fourth of the whole. By 1825, through various cessions, the Cherokees had ceded a good portion to the state, but still owned 9,537,920 acres of land in northwest Georgia. There were at that time about nine thousand Cherokees within the nation.1 By the time of removal, there were sixteen thousand five hundred and forty two.2 The treaty relations between the Cherokees and the colo- nists began as early as 1721, when jealousy of French ter- ritorial encroachments persuaded Governor Nicholson of South Carolina to invite the Cherokees to a congress with a view to conclusion of peace and restoration of the trade relations. At that time an agent was appointed to superin- tend the affairs.3 The first intercourse with the English had been as early as 1623 when the English in Virginia massacred a number of Cherokees, and in 1666, when the Virginians first came in contact with them. In 1693, twenty chiefs of the nation went to Charleston to secure the aid of the Carolinians against the Etaws and the Congarees.4 In 17 12 they fur- nished two hundred warriors to South Carolina in her at- tack upon the Tuscaroras. In 1729 Carolina was divided into two states: North and South Carolina. It was deemed necessary to secure the alliance of the Cherokees. Sir Alexander Cumming was sent over by Great Britian in 1730 to negotiate the treaty which was made with both states on April 3 of the same year. The Indians acknowledged themselves dutiful subjects of King George II, and at Sir Alexander Cum- mings' request, six or seven warriors went to England to do homage to the king. They were received in court and on June 30, 1730, a treaty was signed at Dover, whereby 1. Georgia Baptist Compendium.- (Compiled by The Christian Index -1881) 2. Report of Bureau of Ethnology.

Augusta was al- so headquarters for furnishing the English among the Cherokees with ammunition to prevent the French from secured their aid.2 There was also a road built from Savannah to the Cherokee Nation, through Augusta. Large numbers of the Cherokees came annually to Augusta to trade with the Georgians and Carolinians for powder and lead, and more especially for rum.3 The majorty of the Cherokees still went to Pensacola, Florida, which was a large Spanish trading center.4 Occasional strife between the colonists and the Indians occurred, but the greatest trouble of the colonists lay in their efforts to keep out the influence of the French. As early as 1736, the French had sent a German named Chris- tian Priber, among the Cherokees to secure their aid a- against the English and to organize their government on a civilized basis. This mission failed, but after a number of attempts, in 1759 the French finally secured their sym- pathy in a war against Great Britain. They moved a- gainst the English in South Carolina in 1759, but Governor Littleton defeated them and forced them to sign a peace treaty in 1760, agreeing to kill all resident Fenchmen.5 The Cherokees fought on the side of the English during the French and Indian wars from 171 1 til 1716.6 Mean- while the French became formidable competitors for the Indian trade. Through their trading posts in New Orleans and Mobile they continually took advantage of the Chero- kees. Ther efforts amounted to very little until 1759 when, 1. American Colonial Tracts, No. 3.. 2.

The Cherokees retaliated but were repressed for a short time by Gov. Littleton of South Carolina, who held a large number of their envoys as hostages. After this the war became general. In 1760 and in the first half of 1761, the tribe gave much trouble around Charleston. In June 1761, Colonel Grant, with an army of twenty-six hundred, composed of regulars and of the South Carolina militia, won a decisive victory.1 During the Revolutionary War the Cherokees were friendly to and aided the English, and continued the strug- gle almost without interval until 1794. Up until that time there had been no serious disturbance with any of the In- dians in Georgia. In the first part of the war, an expedition under Colonel John Twiggs, John Jones and Captain Mas- bury had been sent out, which was victorious. Earlier in the war, the Cherokees had given trouble in North Caro- lina, along the Watauga Valley, but had been conquered. Virginia, South Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee had all suffered from the Indian attacks. The Tories, who were fugitives, had taken up their residence among the Chero- kees and were continually stirring up strife. The Spanish under Alexander McGilliray, were trying to extend their influence. All these, with various other reasons, caused the prolongation of the Indian troubles. In 1793, Sevier, with a band of East Tennesseans, and in 1794, Robertson, with a party of West Tennesseans, overcame the offending Cherokees, burning their villages and killing without mercy. From that time the Cherokees were peaceful.2 Among the last treaties made under the Continental Con- gress was that of July 1871, between the Cherokees and Virginia and North Carolina.2 At that time.

The Cherokees had been continuing hostilities with the whites in these states for some time, but after inter- ference by Major General Green, had sued for peace. The following men were appointed from Virginia as delegates: William Christian, William Preston, Arthur Campbell and Joseph; Martin» Robert Severe, John Se- vere, Evan Shelby, Joseph Williams were from North Caro- lina. These men were to meet the Indians "for the purpose of treating on the adjustments of the respective limits of each party; and exchange of presents; a suspension of hos- tilities; conclusion of a peace; and one thing else, for the establishment of harmony and understanding between the contending parties as might seem proper."1 Five hundred Indians came to an island in Holston River in June, but because of an insufficient number of commission- ers from the United States, the meeting was postponed un- til July 26. On that date the parties began their negotia- tions with the usual formalities: smoking, shaking hands, and exchange of gifts. The Cherokees were assured by Colonel Christian that the treaty was for all thirteen states, Georgia, South Caro- lina, and others, and that if they "raise a hatchet against one, raise against all" fur "we are one people linked to- gether." Colonel Severe told them, "it is want of acquain- tance that we have disliked you." Much was said concerning the exchange of prisoners that were being held. It was later agreed that they would re- turn all whites held in thirty-six days. It was here too, that for the first time, the question of establishing schools in the Indian territory, for the benefit of the Cherokee boys, was discussed. One Tassell, the leader of the Cherokees, laid before the commissioners the Indian claims to the land they were then "standing on". According to the treaty drafted at the same place, 1777, their claim was justified, and the United States commissioners admitted their owner- 1.

After that permanent boundaries were fixed. There were a number of English living among the Chero- kees who advised war with the colonies, because they were people "possessed of evil spirits." Tassell and Clanuseh denounced this, admitting their surprise and telling the whites that their country was forever open to them, asked an ideminity from North Carolina for their former en- croachments. Upon the conclusion of the conference, the Cherokees were unable to agree to the treaty, because of lack of funds. The Governor of Virginia appropriated 200,000 pounds of Virginia money for an agent, the expense of making the treaties, and for ammunition, powder and lead, which was to be donated to the Cherokees for their winter hunt. After this there were no treaty relations with Virginia un- til January 7, 1806, when Long, or Great Island, in Hol- ston River, was ceded to the whites. This was the last of the Cherokee land in the state of Virginia. There were, however, a number of treaties between the United States and the Cherokees, in which there were cessions made. At the close of the Revolution, the Cherokees ceded to Georgia, May 31, 1783, land between the Oconee and Tug- alo Rivers.7 This was the last treaty under the Articles of Confederation. North Georgia was being rapidly de- veloped and settled, and new lands were in demand. Fre- quent conventions were held by commissioners of the United States, and the Cherokee chieftains, at some of which rep- resentatives of Georgia were present. But the tribe held fast to its land. In 1785, by the Treaty of Hopewell, the Cherokee Nation placed itself under the protection of the United States, and after that all treaties were made with the Federal Government, each time a specified boundary be- ing fixed, and the United States solemnly guaranteeing to the Cherokees all their land not therein ceded.1 After 1795 no considerable portion of the Cherokee Na- tion was at any time seriously inclined to war. They be- 1. Indian Affairs, American State Papers, Vol. II.</page><page sequence="8">292 THE GEORGIA HISTORICAL QUARTERLY gan to take up various pursuits and industrial careers. The old nomadic life was given up for agriculture by many, the forests were cleared and the lands were cultivated. The Cherokee land was, according to Worcester,1 the best cotton land, and after the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, the price of cotton went up, and consequently be- came the main crop of the Cherokees. In fact though, the Creek lands were better adapted to cotton, with the then prevailing system of agriculture. When the Creek lands had been secured for settlement, the state authorities be- gan to make strenuous efforts toward expelling the Chero- kees. Thereafter, during the intervening years, until their removal, moderate steps were taken. As will be shown, they became the most enlightened tribe of Indians in America. This was due to the efforts of the missionaries, who established vocational schools among them, and to the whites, especially the Tories, who had taken up their residence among the natives. The Cherokees established a constitution and form of government, the leading features of which they borrowed from the United States. They divided their government into three separate departments, legislative, judicial and ex- ecutive. They adopted a code of laws, both civil and crim- inal, and directed eight district courts, with circuit judges, to expound and apply them. They had a Superior Court which met annually in their capital, New Echota, to which decisions might be appealed. Their legislative branch of government consisted of two houses, the National Commit- tee or upper house, with thirteen members, and the National Council, the representative body of the people, with thirty- two members, besides the speaker. The executive power was vested in two principal chiefs, who held office during good behavior.2 One of the greatest steps toward civilization came in 1825, when Sequoyah, George Guess, an illiterate half 1.

He had heard of the "whites talking leaf on which they could put down a "talk" and "it would stay there." He first attempted it by writing with a flat stone, making a mark for every word. Soon he had several thousand marks for every word he knew. This necessitated his dividing the words into parts, whereby one character would answer for a part of many words. Then, assisted by an English spell- ing book he knew nothing of, he adapted the alphabet to his use, by making figures that could be easily written.1 As early as 1803, President Thomas Jefferson gave to the question of emigration its first official impulse.2 But it was not until 1808 that any actions was taken by the Chero- kees. In that year a number of the tribe visited the west- ern land at the suggestion of Return J. Meigs, agent for Indian Affairs. They were favorable to removal, but action was postponed. They sent two delegations to Washington in that year, one from the upper towns, which asked for a permanent allotment of their proportion of the lands that they might settle down in perpetuity, and follow a civilized life. The delegation from the lower towns, which repre- sented only one-third of the nation, asked for an exchange, that they might go west of the Mississippi, where they could indulge in their hereditary passion for the wigwam and chase. According to Meigs, there were two thousand willing to go, but the governor was then unable to finance their removal. Again in 1 8 1 1 an attempt was made which failed. Meanwhile small families, or groups of individuals, continued to emigrate westward. According to Royce the very first actual emigration took place in 18 15, soon after the Treaty of Hopewell. A num- ber of dissatisfied Cherokees descended the Tennessee, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers in pirogues, reached and as- cended the St. Francis in Louisiana, then possessed by Spain, where settlement was formed. In a few years these moved to a more satisfactory location on White River. There a 1. Renort on the Indian Tribes-Pacific R. R. Documents. 2.

In 1822, three Cherokee chiefs were in Mexico, seeking a contract with the Governor for lands in Texas. They were Boles, Fuldo, and Nicolet. Later a number moved into that state. Let us now turn to the religious life of the Cherokees, the activities of the missionaries, and their influence to- ward emigration. THE RELIGION OF THE CHEROKEES. The original religion of the Cherokees was a polythe- istic zoolatry, or animal worship. The first religious be- liefs that we can discover, show that they recognized neither a paradise nor a place of punishment, neither a Supreme Being nor a Spirit of Evil. Whipple said, uthe Cherokees know nothing of the Evil One and his domain, except what they have learned from the white man."1 All of their gods, neither good or evil, dwelt in Galu- lati, or the upper world above the sky. The Cherokee tribe consisted of seven clans : Wolf, which was the largest and most important; Deer; Bird; Paint; Ani-Sahami; Ani-Ga- Tagawi and Ani-Ga-Lahi. These tribes were frequently mentioned in the ritual prayers. There were with the early Cherokees four types of gods; viz; animal gods; elemental gods, such as the sun, water, fire, winds, clouds and frost; inanimate gods, stones and flint; and anthropomorphic gods, thunder, in person of "Red Man" and "Red Woman." This was a type of higher pantheism, though the animal gods were of more importance. The Cherokees connected the four points of the compass with colors and superstitions.2 To the Cherokees, as with i:he Egyptians, religion entered into every phase of life. They had a complete priestly system at one time, known as Shamans. These were highly jealous of the white physicians. The heart of the whole ancient belief centered about the medico-religious methods 1. Manuscript in the De Renne Library-Savannah, Georgia, 2. History of the Missions of the Moravian Church-J. T. Hamilton.</page><page sequence="11">THE MISSIONARIES AMONG THE CHEROKEES 295 of these Shamans, such as bathing, bleeding, rubbing and blowing. Though a great many of the original beliefs of the Cherokees were retained, the first effect of the missionaries upon them was the evolution of their faith into that of Christianity by gradually merging the two. This was done through their efforts to decentralize their religious power, which was in the form of socio-religious organizations. These had an initiation and ritualistic exercises which were said to resemble present free-masonry. The Priest, or Shaman, was at the head of these organizations. Mc- Gowan states that from the most remote times one family was set aside for the priestly office. The family of Nico- tani was the first known to the whites. They were mas- sacred when the missionaries pointed out to some of the Indians how they were abusing their office. A large number of the Cherokees always clung to their original beliefs, however; Christianity spread over the na- tion and through its effects and the efforts of the missionaries, in the space of twenty years they were the most enlight- ened tribe of Indians in America. Elias Boudinot, who was one of the earliest converts and advocates, said in Savannah at the First Presbyterian Church, on May 26, 1826, the following irt regard to the religion of the Cherokees : "The Cherokees have had no established religion of their own and perhaps to this circumstance we may attribute in part the facilities with which missionaries have pursued their ends. They cannot be called idolaters, for they never wor- shiped images. They believed in a Supreme Being, the Creator of all, the God of the white, the red and the black man. They also believed in the existence of an evil spirit who resided, as they thought, in the setting sun, the future place of all who in their life time had done iniquitously. Their prayers were addressed alone to the Supreme Being and which if written would fill a large volume, and display much sincerity, beauty and sublimity. When the ancient customs of the Cherokees were in full force, no warrior</page><page sequence="12">296 THE GEORGIA HISTORICAL QUARTERLY thought himself secure unless he had addressed his guard- ian angel; no hunter could hope for success unless before the rising sun he had asked the assistance of his god and on his return at eve, he had offered his sacrifices to him."1 Early in colonial history we have record of the beginning of missionary effort on the part of some individuals. As aforesaid, Christian Priber, who was probably a Jesuit, did the first mission work among them as early as 1736. The Moravians, as a sect, were the first to undertake mission mork among them. Sprangeberg secured grants of land from the trustees of the colony of Georgia in Eng- land, for the sole object of commencing missions among the Creeks and Cherokees. A group of them reached Savannah on Feb. 6, 1735.2 In 1740 John Hagen visited among the tribes, and again in the sixties, Ettwein attempted to negotiate with the head chiefs at Bethabara. Both of these missions failed and it was probably because of the very unsettled state of the country. Nothing else was attempted until soon after the Revolutionary War. Martin Schneider visited the Cherokees on the Tennessee River in 1783, but his mis- sion also failed because of the ill will toward the colonists. In 1799 and 1800 journeys of exploration were under- taken with encouraging results by Abraham Steiner and Frederick Christian Von Schweinitz, of Salem. With the aid of Captain Butler, of the United States Army, a great council of from three thousand to four thousand Indians was gathered at Tellico Blockhouse on Sept. 23, 1800, and they were able to arrange for a mission through the in- fluence of James Vann and Charles Hicks, two Cherokee chiefs. This was permanently established in April during the year of 1801, by Steiner and Gottlieb Byham at Spring Place, which is now the county seat of Murray County Georgia. Many obstacles were presented, especially the intrica- cies of the Cherokee language and the lack of an intepre- 1. The History of the Missions of the Moravian Church - Hamilton.

However the In- dian Council decided in 1803 to make the school permanent. In 1804 there were six scholars. John Wohlfarth suc- ceeded Steiner and he was succeeded in 1805 by Rev. and Mrs. John Gambold. The first Cherokee conversion was in 1 8 10, Margaret Vann, daughter of James Vann, being baptized with an impressive ceremony. The next was Charles Hicks who afterwards became a leader. Abe de Serra, in an account of his tours to the United States, said of this mission: "I saw there the sons of the Cherokee Regulus learning their lessons and reading their New Testa- ment in the morning and drawing and painting and assisting Mrs. Gambold in her household work, or Mr. Gambold in planting corn.1 As early as 1799, Rev. Gideon Blackburn of Tennessee, first introduced the subject of schools among the Cherokees to the Union Presbytery. In 1803 he introduced the idea to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church. This body appropriated $200 and at his request appointed him as a missionary to the Cherokees for a peroid of only two months. A collection was further taken, amounting to $43°- Colonel Meigs, the Indian agent, assisted in gathering the natives together for a great council meeting to gain their assent. More than two thousand met at a place selected near the Hiwassee River. In 1804, the next year, the school was opened at Maryville, Tenn., with twenty-one pupils. This was the first school among the Cherokees. In 1807 there were forty-five or fifty scholars, and the interest and desire for an education among the Cherokees had grown, until they plead for another one to be established . in the lower nation,which opened with twenty to thirty scholars. Mr. Blackburn opened this upon his own responsibility, but private aid continually came in. After getting his school started, he gathered Indians and whites together for a treaty of friendship and cooperation.2 Mr. Blackburn's 1. History of the Missions of the Moravian Church-Hamilton. 2.

But some four or five hundred Chero- kees were able to read the English Bible and there were over six hundred in circulation. In 1 8 16, Rev. Cyrus Kingsbury visited the Cherokee country under a temporary commission from the Cherokee Missionary Society. He passed through Washington, D. C. and had an interview with Colonel Meigs, the chief of one of the clans and two native Cherokees. They told him that they had long desired the establishment of schools and had even thought of "devoting a part of their annuity to the object, but in consequence of some embarrassment had felt themselves unable." Upon the success of Mr. Blackburn, Mr. Kingsbury asked the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Mis- sions if they would support them. President Madison through the Secretary of War, advised him : "In the first instant the agent for Indian affairs will be directed to erect a comfortable school house and another for the teacher and such as may board with him, ¡in such part of the nation as will be selected for that purpose. He will also be directed to furnish two plows, six hoes, and as many axes, for the purpose of introducing the art of cultivation among the pu- pils. If there are any female students, also a female teacher to teach them to spin, weave, sew; a loom, a half dozen spinning wheels, and as many cards." In October, 18 16, Mr. Kingsbury put the object of his mission before the General Council of the Chiefs of the Cherokees and Creeks. After consultation a chief said "You have appeared in our full Council. We have listened to what you have said and understand it. We are glad to see you. We wish to have the school established and hope it will be of great advantage to the nation." Another chief was appointed to assist in selecting a site. A farm was bought on Chickamauga Creek. The mission was called Brainerd. Rev. Kingsbury arrived January 13, 1 8 17. The school was a compound of missions, boarding school, and agriculture college. By June there were twenty-</page><page sequence="15">THE MISSIONARIES AMONG THE CHEROKEES 299 six natives and the mission was rapidly advancing. The Indians were showing much interest. Upon the failure of the government contractor to build the houses agreed upon the missionary and several of the Indians engaged in mak- inf twenty thousand bricks, burning lime, digging cellars, besides the hardship of bringing their meals for forty miles. L. S. Williams and Moody Hall joined the mission on March 7th. Hall managed the school and Williams the business departmentt. Mr. Kingsbury preached regularly to an audience of about one hundred and there was a Sun- day School attracting large crowds. As early as 1801, some of the local Baptist associations in Georgia were advocating a mission among the Chero- kees, and for a number of years occasionally a preacher would have a chance to speak to them through an inter- preter. In 1 8 16, the Sarepta Baptist Association sent mis- sionaries among them and supported schools.1 In 18 17, the American Baptist Board of Foreign Missions estab- lished a school and mission in western North Carolina, just over the border from Georgia, at Valleys Town. Rev. Humphrey Posey was in charge. The Baptist school grew very fast, and in a brief time three branches were estab- lished. These were Tinsawattee and Coosawattee in Geor- gia, and one Nottle, in North Carolina. There were a number of native preachers at each mission.2 In 1 8 1.8 the Moravians established another station at Oochgelogy, in Gordon County, Georgia. By that year eight natives had gone to Cornwall, Conn., for advanced education. Among these were John Ridge, who had be- gun education at Spring Place. He later went to Princeton University.3 On May 27, 18 19, President Monroe, after the treaty with the Cherokees, visited the mission at Brainerd. He was so impressed with the work and improvements among the Cherokees that he gave orders for a much better build- ing for the girls school, at the public expense. 1.

There was a hesitancy about accepting him, but through his importunity, he was finally admitted. Later he per- formed a great work among his own people. During 1819 the system of local schools was commenced. In 1820 there were several new missions opened under the American Board, and again in 1823 the Board had six missions among the Cherokees three of which were in Georgia. They were Carmel, Hightower, and Haweis. By 1828 the Board had eighteen schools, according to Elias Boudinot. There were a number of cases of missionaries marrying the converts, who would change, or rather take, a Christian name upon baptism. There was a great desire evidenced on the part of the Cherokees to take advantage of every opportunity given them.1 The mission work conducted by the Methodists is quite differentiated from that of the other denominations. It was under the direction of the Conference of Tennessee, Rev. William M. Mahan being superintendent. They had four stations, located at the following places : Creek Path, Chat- tooga Court House, Pinelog, and Oochgelogy. There was a school at each, and in 1828 there were one hundred schol- ars. None of these stations was permanently fixed, but subject to be continued or discontinued as expedient. The Methodists did not seek church members, but "Members of Society,1' that is, those desiring to learn. The schools were itinerating and the missionaries on their rounds em- braced every family in the neighborhood, and yet they did not want to stay long enough for the Cherokees to estab- lish a national identity with the whites. There were three large circuits, Ross's Postoffice, Riley's House, and Grand River, embracing sixty preaching places. In two of these circuits the gospel was preached in English, at the others in Cherokee. The superintendents were Rev. James I. Trot, 1.

Greenbury Garrett and Turtles Fields. In 1830 they had over eight hundred "Members of Society," or "Seekers," as they were called.1 The United Brethren also had a few missionaries among the Cherokees, but they never accomplished much. John Ross gave them credit for only fifty four members in 1830.2 Meanwhile the Baptist Mission at Valleys Town had been growing. Rev. and Mrs Evan Jones had succeeded Mr. Posey as superintendents. The school had scholars ranging from five to eight years of age. The mission and school at Hickory Log was under Rev. Dr. Duncan O'Bryant assisted by a number of natives.3 Thus we see that the missionaries did a great work in civilizing these tribes. To them belong the credit of the Cherokee enlightment which brought them forward as the most advanced and skilled of all American Indians. As has been shown the greatest help that came to them was the invention of the Cherokee alphabet by Sequoyah, or George Guess, in 1825. David Brown, a native, who was one of the best scholars of the nation, a graduate of Cornwall, translated the New Testament and it was soon circulated in manuscript. In 1827, the Supreme Council of the Chero- kees requested the Provincial Committee to secure for them a font of type, a press and furniture which was to be paid for out of the Cherokee treasury. On Feb. 21, 1828, the first edition of the Cherokee Phoenix was published. With the itinerant policy adopted by the majority of the missionaries, and especially by the natives going from place to place, teaching twice a week, it was less than two years before half of the whole nation could read and write their own language. By 1830 more than one thousand Gospels of Matthew were printed, and eight hundred copies of 1.

After the revision of their consti- tution in Ib28, they made the selling of property, or planning of emigration westward a capital offense. 2. Georgia Journal, Jan. 30, 1827. 3.

There were at that time, according to Worcester, two hundred and nineteen members of the Pres- byterian churches, one hundred and sixty seven of these be- ing natives. There were ninety Baptists and forty-five members of the Moravian churches. The Methodist So- ciety claimed eight hundred and fifty "seekers" who were not regenerate. By 1833 more than twelve hundred students had been received in the schools, the great majority of whom were Cherokees. (about ninety percent.) About five hundred of these had been qualified for common busi- ness. Printing was in large demand. More than fourteen thousand copies of the Testament and Pslams had been dis- tributed.1 As early as 1820 the Council adopted the compulsory education law, that if the child withdrew from school be- fore it had received an education, "That would make it use- ful, then the parent who had taken him out prematurely would have to pay the expense of support while there." The chiefs of the nation required the most suitable pupils to serve an apprenticeship at the most useful mechanic arts. In 1828 the Cherokees decided that the annuity from the government was not adequate, and they appropriated money from their own treasury, and secured native teach- ers for the new schools that they had established within the nation. THE RELATION OF THE CHEROKEES TO THE GOVERNMENT OF GEORGIA. By the Treaty or "Compact of 1802," Georgia ceded to the United States all her rights and titles to the territory westward of a certain line, the lands which now comprise the states of Mississippi and Alabama, for $1,250,000, so that she might meet the demands of those who lost in the Yazoo Fraud. At the same time, April 24, 1802, the United States assumed the obligation of extinguishing for the use of Georgia, as soon as it could be obtained "peace- 1.

In 1823, fifty thousand dollars were appropriated by Congress for fur- ther treaties with the Cherokees, upon the charge of bad faith from Georgia to the United States. Duncan G. Camp- bell and Major James Meriwether were appointed as a com- mittee to make a treaty. October 4, 1823 they met the Cherokees in Council at New Town and asked for further acquisitions. To this the chiefs replied, "We beg leave to present this commusication as a positive and unchangeable refusal to never dispose of one foot more of land."2 Again in 1827 they declared that they would uno never," cede any more land. As early as 1821 they were enacting laws in their council to prohibit the natives from selling their land.8 Meanwhile the state of Georgia, through her legislature was enacting laws, extending her jurisdiction over the Chero- kee country. On December 26, 1826 the following law was assented to: "Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, in general assem- bly met, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, that from and after passage of this act, no Indian, and no descendant of an Indian, not understanding the Eng- lish language, shall be deemed a competent witness in any court of justice, created by the constitution or the laws of this state." Again on December 20, 1828, the civil and criminal jurisdiction of Georgia was extended by the fol- lowing act: "Be it resolved That all laws, usages and customs made, established and in force in the said territory, by the said Cherokee Indians, be, and the same are hereby, on and after the first day of June, 1830, declared null and void."4 1.

The Cherokee country had become a rendezvous of robbers, and earlier, the majority of the Tories who were dodging the Georgia law, had taken up their residence with them. These were giving a great deal of trouble a- long the frontier. From the press of that day, it appears that the greatest trouble with the Cherokees was robbery, and more especially horse stealing. It was natural that the missionaries who had become devoted to their work and to the Indian cause, were ever striving for a betterment of relations. At this time the capital of the Cherokee nation was New Echota, Georgia. At this place were missions of the various denominations of the American Board. Also there were in New Echota at this time, 1829, the leaders and head chiefs of all the Cherokees and there had developed among them quite a bit of politics and animosity over the removal to the west. One party headed by John Ross, was against emigration, which seemed to be the much greater party. Charles Hicks was the leader of the minority, in favor of removal.1 So one immediately sees that New Echota, being the capi- tal of the nation, was a hot-bed of politics. The mission was the center of all this, for it was very much like the present day court-house, or general meeting house of the town. Rev. Samuel Worcester, of Vermont, was at the head of this mission. He was very popular with the natives, and it seems that various papers, though not authentic, state that he assisted the Cherokees in the making and exe- cution of their laws. According to Cotter, several of the missionaries had drafted the constitution in 1826.2 At any rate these missionaries throughout the nation thought the extension of the Georgia laws over the nation unconstitutional and protested against them. From the Cherokee Phoenix, we find that meetings were held, in which numbers of memorials were drafted and sent both 1. History of the American Board of Foreign Missions, 1831. 2. Hamilton, History of the Missions of the Moravian Church.</page><page sequence="21">THE MISSIONARIES AMONG THE CHEROKEES 305 to Congress and to the State Legislature. These poured in from every missionary of the Board, who were all New Englanders, from the other denominations, and especially letters and pamplets signed by "William Penn," which were written by Dr. Jeremiah Evarts, who was Corres- ponding Secretary of the Board at the time. It is true that her laws were contrary to the treaties that had been made, but Georgia had been waiting patiently on the government for twenty six years, and now she was carrying out the policy suggested by the Indian Agent, Col- onel McKenny, that Georgia "take them kindly by the hand and tell them that they must go." The lower class of whites in the territory gave quite a bit of trouble. The Tories were still bitter, and they encour- aged opposition to Georgia. All this resulted in the law passed at the next Legislature, December 1829, requiring that all white men within the nation leave, or take the fol- lowing oath of allegiance: "I, A. B., do solemnly swear, or affirm, as the case may be, that I will support and defend the Constitution and the laws of the State of Georgia, and uprightly demean myself as a citizen thereof."1 Then followed a widespread denunciation of Georgia and her laws. The missionaries complained that the laws were enacted because of them, they having been falsely in- dicted for interfering with the politics of the Cherokees. The American Board drafted and sent resolutions. The following is a portion of one : "The Cherokees refused to treat for the sale of their country; their unwillingness to sell ascribed to the influence of the missionaries, who it was said were acting inconsistently with their professed character, by giving advice on political questions. If the missionaries, by the direction of their employers, had given advice on every question that came before the Cherokee peo- ple, they would only have exercised an undoubted right, and no person on earth would have had any just reason to complain, but the charge was false." 1. History of the American Board of Foreigs Missions</page><page sequence="22">306 THE GEORGIA HISTORICAL QUARTERLY Throughout the Cherokee Nation, meetings of denuncia- tion were held, defying the laws of Georgia. The most of these meetings were held around the missions of the Board, the missionaries always expressing their sympathy. At one meeting the following was read in the form of a memorial in behalf of them: uThe Indians had better stand to arms We will take up arms for the Indians in such a war with as much confidence of our duty as we would stand on the shores of the Atlantic, to repel the assults of the most barbaric invader m On December 29, 1829, a meeting was held at New Echota of five missionaries of the Board, two Moravians and one Baptist, "for the purpose of making such a public declaration as the state of things seemed to require." Rev. Mr. Butrick was made Chairman, and Rev. Worcester Sec- retary. The following resolutions were adopted, and pub- lished in the Cherokee Phoenix. "Resolved, That we view the Indian question, at pres- ent so much agitated in the United States, as being merely not of a political nature, but of a moral nature, inasmuch as it involves the maintenance or violation of the faith of our country, and as demanding therefore, the most serious consideration of all Americans, not only as patriots, but as Christians. "Resolved, That we regard the present crisis of affairs, relating to the Cherokee Nation, as calling for our sym- pathy, and prayers and aid of all benevolent people through- out the United States. "Resolved, That the frequent insinuations which have been publicly made, that missionaries have used an influence in directing the political affairs of this nation, demand from us an explicit and public disavowal of the charge ; and that we therefore solemnly affirm that in regard to ourselves at least, every such insinuation is entirely unfounded. "Resolved, that while we distinctly aver that it is not any influence of ours, which has brought the Cherokees to the resolution not to exchange their place of residence, yet 1. History of the American Board of Foreign Missions.</page><page sequence="23">THE MISSIONARIES AMONG THE CHEROKEES 307 it is impossible for us not to feel a lively interest in a sub- ject of such vital importance to their welfare; and that we can perceive no consideration, either moral or political, which ought in the present crisis, to prevent us from a free and public expression of our opinion. "Resolved, therefore, that we view the removal of this people to the west of the Mississippi, as an event to be most earnestly deprecated, threatening greatly to retard, if not totally arrest, their progress in religion, civilization, learning, and the useful arts; to involve them in great dis- tress, and to bring upon them a complication of evils, for which the prospect before them would offer no compensa- tion. "Resolved, That we deem ourselves absolutely certain that the feelings of the whole mass of the Cherokee people, including all ranks, and with scarcely a few individuals ex- cepted, are totally adverse to a removal, so that nothing but force, or such oppression as they would esteem equiva- lent to force, could induce them to adopt such a measure. "Resolved, as our unanimous opinion, that the establish- ment of the jurisdiction of Georgia and other states, over the Cherokee people, against their will, would be an im- mense and irreparable injury." The Georgia laws went further and prohibited the Chero- kees from assembling together in council, and arrested a number of them. The Cherokee Phoenix printed all ac- counts of these laws and all the resolutions from organi- zations throughout the country, which produced a bit of in- dignation on the part of the natives. The Cherokees were struggling for their cause, and were procuring false arrests and having mock trials. It is tfue that the whites shame- fully intruded. The laws of Georgia had gone so far that no Cherokee was allowed to work for a white, under pen- alty of forfeiting all his property. This is illustrated by a white, begging an Indian to transfer him across to Coosa River, on his ferry, to see his daughter stated by him to be dying. The Cherokee refused at first but finally carried</page><page sequence="24">308 THE GEORGIA HISTORICAL QUARTERLY him across, upon which the white told him of his intrigue and took possession of his ferry and property.1 For vengeance the Cherokees did many barbarous acts. The case of Jesse Stansal furnishes an illustration. He was arrested under pretense of violating laws and was detained in custody for two days without trial, and then suspended by the wrists to a tree and given fifty lashes on his bare back, mith large hickory sticks, which almost killed him.2 This missionaries denied emphatically any interference politically with the Cherokees. There is no direct evidence that they did interfere, except through the psychology of their sympathies, as embodied in the various memorials and resolutions. The Methodists of Tennessee rebuked the charge, but asked their missionaries to withdraw soon afterwards. The Baptist missionaries took the oath, but the members of the Board refused, Messrs. Butler and Worcester saying, "The law was designed to operate, and did operate, as an interruption to missionaries' labor The expulsion of the missionaries was the particular object of the law." They felt that if they took the oath, it would mean their endorsement of what Georgia was doing. Meanwhile the United States troops had been withdrawn from Georgia and the Georgia Guard was in control. They had quelled several riots between the two political parties, and had made a number of false arrests. Their behavior on other occasions had been the cause of much indignation on the part of the citizens of Georgia and the whole coun- try. Colonel Charles H. Nelson was in charge. One inci- dent is recorded of their unbecoming behavior at the Bap- tist mission at Tensewatee, where Rev. Duncan O'Bryant was in charge. He was baptizing several of his mission in a stream near the church. During the exercises the men of the Georgia Guard, "claiming to be possessed by the spirits," tried to run over the Indians in order to baptize their horses. After getting in the water, they mocked relig- ion and baptism.3 1. Historical Collections- White 2. The Athenian, Nov. 3. 1829 - Cherokee Phoenix, Dec. 3, 1829. 3. Georgia and State Rights - U. B. Phillips.</page><page sequence="25">THE MISSIONARIES AMONG THE CHEROKEES 309 In January, 1831, the missionaries at Carmel, Hightower, Haweis, and New Echota, the missions of the American Board in Georgia, received copies of the law of Georgia requiring all resident whites to swear allegiance and secure a license from the governor, or leave by March first. Wor- cester denounced this, because of the fact that the United States controlled the relations over the Indians; that the missionaries had the consent of the President to work a- mong the Cherokees; and that if he yielded to the law which he branded as unconstitutional, it would have a very unfavorable effect upon the Cherokees. It is to be noticed that only the missionaries of the Board, who were from the North, received these letters. The Methodists complained of this through their organ, The Repertory, published in Macon, but the Cherokee Phoenix denied this, Elias Boudinot, the editor said that "all were arrested and all put in chains.'' From both the Phoenix and the Georgia Journal one would acquiesce in the state- ment that they gave more trouble in defying the laws than the other missionaries. Wilson Lumpkin in a speech to Congress, said that they, together with the "Canting fa- natics" of the North, who were the members of the Board, cost the Government more than $100,000. . . But few missionaries left at first. On March 12, 1831, a detachment of the Georgia Guard, composed of twenty- five men under Colonel Nelson, arrived at Carmel and ar- rested Mr. Proctor. On Sunday, March 13, they went to New Echota, which was thirty miles away and arrested Mr. Worcester. March 14, at Hightówer they arrested Mr. Thompson. These were all conveyed to headquarters on the next day, March 15th, at Camp Gilmer. On March 17th, through their council, Chester, Underwood and Har- ris, they were released on habaes corpus proceedings, be- fore the Superior ,Court of Gwinnett County. Judge Clay- ton overruled the motion that the law was unconstitutional and void. But as the missionaries were employed in ex- pending the United States money, for the education of the Indians, and as Mr. Worcester was postmaster at New</page><page sequence="26">310 THE GEORGIA HISTORICAL QUARTERLY Echota, he held that they were agents of the government. Worcester says in his letters, that at this first time they were arrested, they were treated with as much civility and kindness as could be expected. On May 7th following, Mr. Butler was arrested, but was released because of ill- ness in his family.1 Gotlieb Byham, who was postmaster at Spring Place, the Moravian mission, was arrested but was soon released. He, together with the other Mora- vians, escaped to the home of Captain McNair, just across the border in Tennessee. Harry G. Clauder continually visited his members until March 21, when he was arrested but released to withdraw from Georgia within ten days.1 When Georgia in 1832 divided the lands of the Chero- kee country by lottery, the mission property at Oochgelogy was taken from the church and seized by strangers. In 1833, three families moved in and compelled Clauder, who had succeeded Byham as postmaster, to give up half of the mission house at Spring Place, and then an alleged agent of Georgia drove off the missionaries. After Spring Place was made the county seat, this church was turned into the courthouse. After the release of the missionaries, Governor Gilmer took up correspondence with President Jackson in regard to the status of the missionaries as agents of the United States. The President replied that he did not on any sense regard any of them as such. Upon request of Governor Gilmer, Worcester was removed from the office of post- master. On May 16, Governor Gilmer informed the missionaries of the Board by letter of the attitude of the general gov- ernment towards them. On June 7, Dr. Butler and Wor- cester replied, stating fully their attitude as above. Messrs. Butrick Proctor and Thompson removed with their families to Brainerd. Mr. Thompson continued to preach and visit at Hightower. June 22, Colonel Nelson notified Miss Fuller, who was left in charge of the station at the last named place, that he 1. Removal of the Cherokees - Lumpkin. Vol. 1, p. 43.</page><page sequence="27">THE MISSIONARIES AMONG THE CHEROKEES 311 would take over the mission on the next day. When Mr. Thompson heard of this he wrote to him, greatly objecting. He was arrested, chained and made to walk through for- ests asd swamps for fifty miles to Camp Gilmer, where he tayed in jail for only a few minutes. Colonel Sanford cen- sured him for too great freedom of speech, and then with- out assigning any reason for his arrest, released him. On July 7, Worcester was again arrested and taken ten miles, where they met Colonel Nelson and detachment with Rev. J. J. Trott, a Methodist missionary who had a Chero- kee family, and a Cherokee by the name of Proctor. They were made to march on foot for twenty-two miles. On their way, they met Mr. McLeod and Mr. Wells, two other Methodist ministers, who asked Trott if he had been chained. Upon an affirmative answer, McLeod said, "It seems they proceed more by order, than by law. "This* together with several other impudent remarks, gave offense, and Colonel Nelson ordered him to leave and to return to Tennessee. He replied, "I will, but you will hear from me again." He was then arrested and made to walk on with them. Wells galloped off on his horse in a different direc- tion. Sergeant Brooks compelled McLeod to keep in the middle of the road, threatening to thrust his bayonet through him if he turned aside. Thus he had to walk through mud and mire for thirty-five miles, and nearly every step of the way, Brooks tormented them with the vilest and most profane language. He continually said, "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom." At night the prisoners were chained together in pairs. Mr. Wells had met Mr. Thompson with the guards and followed to aid McLeod. When Nelson saw him, he cut a large stick and drove up behind him and gave him a severe blow on the head. Meanwhile Dr. Butler had been arrested and was on his way to the prison. He had been chained by the neck to the horse, with the danger of falling or stumbling. When it became so dark and Dr. Butler had walked until he could</page><page sequence="28">312 THE GEORGIA HISTORICAL QUARTERLY go no further, the guard put him behind his saddle on his horse. The chain around the neck of Butler and the horse, drew the neck of the horse back and he stumbled and fell upon the two. Neither one could move and they were forc- ed to stay in that position until some one passed and helped them. As a result, two of the guard's ribs were broken. When they reached the prison, Brooks said, uThere is where all the enemies of Georgia have to land, there and in Hell.". They were all chained by the necks to the walls. By writ of habeas corpus, Butler and Worcester were re- leased on bond, from the Inferior Court of Gwinett Coun- ty, to appear before the Superior Court in September. Worcester went to Brainerd, where he stayed until August 17, when he was called to New Echota, on account of the death of his infant daughter, and the illness of his wife. He arrived there on Tuesday, August 16. Wednesday morn- ing he was arrested by a disguised guard at his home, but was released. On September 15, Butler, Worcester, Thompson, Wells, Proctor, McLeod, Trott, Wheeler, Nellum, and Mayes were all tried in Lawrenceville and sentenced by Judge Clayton to four years of imprisonment in the penitentiary, recom- mending them to executive clemency, if they would take the oath. They were sent to Milledgeville and on September 22, all were pardoned who promised to leave the state, by Governor Gilmer. Butler and Worcester refused, at the suggestion of the Board, that they be martyrs of their cause, if necessary. The prison was a rudely made house, with only one open- ing, and that the door. The floor was made of logs split in half, and there was no furniture. After they were in Milledgeville, Worcester and several others, wrote Colonel Charles Nelson the following: "Col. Ch. H. Nelson. Sir: If it be consistent with the necessary regulations, it would be a high gratification to some of the prisoners, if Mr. Trott and Mr. Worcester, might be permitted to hold</page><page sequence="29">THE MISSIONARIES AMONG THE CHEROKEES 313 a meeting, tomorrow evening, at some place where such of the guard and of the neighbors as are disposed, might at- tend. If the favor can be granted, be so kind as to give us an answer as soon as convenient. We wish to be understood that we should all greatly desire the privilege of attending." (Signed.) S. A. Worcester J. J. Trott Elizur Butler Samuel Mayes The note was returned with the following written on the outside : "We view the within request as an impertinent one.

If your object be true piety, you can enjoy it where you are. Were we hearers, we would not be benefitted, devoid as we are of confidnce in your honestly* (Signed) C. H. Nelson.1" The Prudential Committee, of the Board send a memorial to President Jackson in behalf of the missionaries. He replied through the Secretary of War, that he could not interfere since the Georgia laws had been extended. At the same time Worcester and Butler had carried their case to the Supreme Court, with an able counsel in the person of William Wirt, former Attorney General, and John Sar- geant, who had been counsel in the case of the Cherokee Nation versus the State of Georgia. The Court hagl sent a citation to the Governor for Georgia to appear before that body on the first Monday in March, 1832, and answer why they were held and why a writ of error should not be granted. But Georgia did not appear. In the decision of the former case, the court had refused the injunction prayed for, which was favorable to Georgia. This time, Chief Justice Marshall rendered the decision in favor of the missionaries. He held that the laws of Georgia were unconstitutional and void, and ordered that all pro- ceedings on the indictments against the missionaries "do 1. History of the American Board of Foreign Missions.</page><page sequence="30">314 THE GEORGIA HISTORICAL QUARTERLY for ever surcease" and they "be and hereby are, dismissed therefrom."1 On March 17, 1832, Mr. Chester, supported by Mr. Underwood and General Harden, moved in the Superior Court of Georgia that the mandate be received and obeyed. The court refused, and to keep the United States Supreme Court from enforcing its decision, would not allow its own decision to be recorded, or any matter relating to it. To support this decision, Chester made an affidavit and Judge Clayton signed it, certifying the facts. Mr. Chester then applied by letter to Governor Lumpkin for the release of the prisoners. He refused to answer in writing, saying "You got 'round Clayton, but you shall not get 'round me." The Georgia Guards had been stationed in the build- ings of the Board at Carmel and Hightower. The pro- duce of the fields was consued and destroyed, together with the fowls and swine belonging to the mission. Mrs. Wor- cester and Mrs. Butler, who had been residing at their old homes at New Echota and Haweis, were ordered to leave, or they would be ejected by the guard. The property was to be sold or rented for the benefit of the state. They removed to Brainerd. January 8, 1833, upon the advice of the Prudential Com- mittee, Messrs. Butler and Worcester notified Attorney Wirt not to push their case in the Supreme Court. They also notified the Governor and the Attorney General that they *had dropped it. In their letter to Governor Lump- kin, they stated, "We have not been led to the adoption of this measure by any change of views in regard to the prin- ciple on which we have acted." Governor Lumpkin thought that this was disrespectful, and "determined that as long as they regarded the 'principle on which they acted' so high- ly, they might stand by it in the penitentiary." When they learned of the Governors attitude, they wrote again.2 1. The Cherokee Nation VS1 Tre State of Georgia 5 Peters P. 1. 2.

Sir: We are sorry to be informed that some expressions in our communication of yesterday were regarded by Your Excellency as an indignity offered to the state, or its authorities. Nothing could be further from our design. In the course we have now taken, it has been our intention, simply to forbear the prosecution of our case, and to leave the question of the continuance in confinement to the magn- animity of the state. We are respectfully yours (Signed) S. A. Worcester, Elizur Bulter. On January 14th, after serving from September 15, 1 83 1, sixteen months, they were released and immediately left the state. At that time the legislature of Georgia re- pealed the laws that had been enacted. After the final treaty with the Cherokees was made in 1835, the government reimbursed the various missionary boards, whose property they had taken and destroyed. They also set aside money to care for the removal of the missionaries. Elias Boudinot said that the actions of the Georgia Guard in their treatment of the missionaries in such an uncalled for manner, had an adverse effect upon them. The Georgians had objected to their efforts, because it was said that they were instilling into the Indians a love for their country. THE REMOVAL OF THE CHEROKEES Thus it is clear, that the Indians were determined not to leave Georgia. By the Compact of 1802, as has been seen, the United States had guaranteed to Georgia alone the l exclusion of the Indian title. In 1828, the United States had received in cessions 1,612,800 acres in Alabama, (1805); 1,209,600 acres in Alabama and Tennessee,</page><page sequence="32">316 THE GEORGIA HISTORICAL QUARTERLY (1806) ; 26,760 acres in South Carolina, (1816); 1,887,360 acres in Alabama, March 22, 18 16; 1,395,200 acres in Alabama, (October 4, 1816) ; 1,437,260 in North Carolina, (1819); and 738,560 acres in Tennessee, (1819). This makes a total of 8,542,540 acres, which was eight times as much as the Cherokees had in Georgia, and for which the government had paid twelve millions of dollars. It was no wonder that the Georgians blamed the nation- al government for bad faith. They felt that the United States had encouraged, to an extent, the attitude taken by the Cherokees,' by continually receiving their delegates with diplomatic courtesies, and treating with them as a foreign power. In 1830 Governor Troup took issue with Presi- dent Monroe's message to Congress, that the government "was under no obligation to use other means than peace- able and reasonable ones."1 He said that the Indians were that they were tenants at will. At a convention in New Echota on July 26, 1827, a national constitution was adopted by the representatives of the nation. It asserted that the Cherokee Indians con- stituted one of the sovereign and independent nations of the earth, having complete jurisdiction over its territory, to the exclusion of the authority of any other state.2 Thus they had advanced in civilization, to an extent that it rendered it rather hard and impracticable to enforce any of the laws of the United States, in regard to inter- course with them. The United States government pro- hibited any man from settling on any Indian country, or trading or trafficing with any article,' unless under special permit or license from the legal authority of the United States.3 In total disregard of this, the Cherokees resolved through their Committee and Council "to suffer no man to settle in their limits and trakc and trade with their people without first obtaining a permit or license to do so, from the Cherokee authorities.4 1.

Under such circumstances, something had to be done. The President of the United States notified the Cherokees, through the Indian agent Montgomery, that their new constitution could not be considered in any other light, than as regulations of a purely municipal character, and that their relation to the general government, stood unchanged.1 The following year, Governor Forsyth, in his last mes- sage to the Georgia Legislature, recommended the exten- sion of the Georgia laws over them, instead of expelling them, but suggested that the President ask them to remove from the State. Accordingly on December 20, 1828, by an act, the Georgia laws were extended over all whites within the territory, and it was also enacted that on and after June 1, 1830, all Indian residents therein, were to be subject to such laws and all of their law would be null and void.2 Following this was the great rush for gold in Chero- kee Georgia, by thousand of whites from Georgia and other states. These intrusions were unlawful under three sepa- rate governments, but none of the three were able to check the prevailing disorder. Georgia attempted it first. Oc- tober 29, 1850, Governor Gilmer wrote to the President, and told of Georgia's recent legislative enactments, and asked that the United States troops, which had been sta- tioned to quell disorder and to prvent intruders from set- tling on Cherokee soil, be withdrawn.3 General Andrew Jackson, who was in charge, was in sympathy with Georgia, and being opposed to President Adam's policy, immediately complied with Governor Gil- mer' s request.4 After other laws were enacted, entending the jurisdiction of Georgia over the Cherokees, the chiefs determined to resort to the Supreme Court, for an injunc- tion,/ in a final effort to save themselves. 1.

Judge A. S. Clayton took a prominent part in this meeting, because most of his district was in the Cherokee country, and because the case of George (Corn) Tassel was to come up under him in the next Superior Court of Hall County. On trial, November 22, 1830, Tassel was convicted and sentenced to be hunged December 24, 1830. Judge Clayton refused to grant an appeal by writ of error to the Supreme Court, and even refused to certify that Tassel was tried. He was executed in defiance of the writ of error sanctioned by Chief Justice Marshall and served on Governor Gilmer, on December 22, only two days before the execution. The citation called for Georgia to appear before the Supreme Court on the second Monday in January and to answer why Tassel was tried and convicted. Governor Gilmer turned it over to the Georgia Legislature with the follow- ing message: "So far as concerned the exercise of the power which belongs to the Executive Department, orders received from the Supreme Court for the purpose of stay- ing or in any manner interferring with the decisions of the courts of the states, in the exercise of their constitu- tional jurisdiction, will be disregarded and any attempt to enforce such orders will be resisted with whatever force the laws have placed at my command." The Legislature in joint assembly, resolved their regrets as to the interfer- ence, and requested all citizens of Georgia, the Governor and other officers, uto disregard any and every mandate and process that has been or shall be served upon him or them, purporting to proceed from the Chief Justice or any associate Justice, or the Supreme Court of the United States, for the purpose of arresting the execuion o any of the criminal laws of the state. And be it further resolved, that His Excellency, the Governor, be, and is hereby author- ized and required,* with all the force and means placed at his commands by the onstitutional laws of this state, to re-</page><page sequence="35">THE MISSIONARIES AMONG THE CHEROKEES 319 sist and to repel any and every invasion from whatever quarter upon the administration of the criminal law." Soon after this, the case of the Cherokee Nation versus the State of Georgia was docketed in the Supreme Court. The bill of the complainant set forth the fact that they were a "foreign state, not owing allegiance to the United States, nor to any state in this union, nor to any prince, potentate, or state other than their own." They further declared themselves to be the owners of the land, because of the right of first discovery, and that they were an independent, sover- eign state, taking into consideration the former treaties with the Cherokees. The bill was brought, praying an injunction to restrain the State of Georgia from the execution of certain laws of that state, especially to declare null those of 1828-29; these laws they averred, went to annihilate the Cherokees as a political society, to seize for the use of Georgia, those lands which had been guaranteed to them by the United States, in solemn treaties, repeatedly made and still in force. The case came up for hearing in the January term, 1831. The counsel cited fully all grievances, especially the later ones, as the action of the state of Georgia in defiance of the writ of error, in re George Tassel, the laws of Georgia preventing the assembling together of the Cherokees for any other purpose than to cede land,' the authorization by the Georgia Legislature of a survey of the Cherokee lands, for the lottery, the taking possession of the gold mines, and the stationing of armed forces at the mines, and throughout the nation, for the enforcement of the Georgia laws. No coun- sel appeared in behalf of Georgia. In rendering the decision, Chief Justice Marshall granted that the Indians were a state, but were not a foreign nation. He said, "they may more correctly perhaps be denominated domestic dependent nations." Quoting further: "If it be true that the Cherokee nation have rights, this is not the Tribunal in which those rights are to be asserted. If it be true that wrongs have been inflicted, and that still greater</page><page sequence="36">320 THE GEORGIA HISTORICAL QUARTERLY are to be apprehended» this is not the tribunal, which can redress the past or prevent the future. The motion for an injunction is denied."1 It has already been seen how the Cherokees were given the decision long hoped for in the personal cases of Wor- vester vs. Georgia, and Butler vs. Georgia. The laws were declared null and void, and the judgments of the Georgia courts were received. Yet these decisions established the permanent triumph of Georgia's policy, and rendered it only a question of a very few years when the Indians would be driven from their territory within the limits of the state.2 Again in 1834 there occurred a controversy between Georgia, the Supreme Court, and the Cherokee Nation. For a third time a citation summoned the State of Georgia through her representative to show cause why the error in a certain case should not be corrected. In this instance it was the case of James Graves vs. Georgia, who had been tried and convicted of murder, and who was later executed ac- cording to the sentence of the Georgia court. Governor Lumpkin and the legislature again denounced the Federal government.3 It is interesting to note Governor Gilmer's action in disregarding the decision in the case of Georgia vs. Cunetoo, which had been tried by Judge Clayton in Walton County. The defendant was ¡ailed for digging gold on his own land, but Judge Clayton had released him, because, he said, that the Cherokees had the use of the precious min- erals found on their own lands. It is also to be remembered with reproach that the Geor- gia Legislature tried to impeach Judge John W. Hooper for refusal to enforce the Georgia laws, and for granting so many injunctions to the Cherokees. Meanwhile the lands had been distributed by the land lottery system in 1834, and the people were moving in. President Jackson persisted in his attempts to persuade the Cherokees to leave in a body. 1. The Cherokee Nation vs. The State of Georgia. 2. Georgia and State Rights - Phillips. 3. Removal of the Cherokees - Lumpkin.</page><page sequence="37">THE MISSIONARIES AMONG THE CHEROKEES 321 In the same year, 1834, the Cherokees fell into two parties, which division hastened their removal. One of these was headed by John Ross, who was opposed to removal and further treaties, and which party was the stronger, and the other by John Ridge, in favor of emigra- tion. These two factions engendered much ill feeling among the tribe. OnDecember 29, 1835, at New Echota, the final treaty was concluded between the United States agents, William Carroll and John F. Schermerhorm and the Ridge fac- tion, because the Ross faction opposed it, which providd for the cession of all the Cherokee land east of the Mis- sissippi, to the United States for $5,000,000. It was al- so agreed to give to hem seven million acres west of the Mississippi to pay the eypenses of removal, allowing $600, 000, and to give them two years in which to remove.1 Public sentiment throughout the United States became stirred with sympathy for the Indians. Webster said, "There is a strong and growing feeling in the country that great wrong has been done to the Cherokees by the Treaty of New Echota. " Henry Clay sympathized be- cause of the injustice and "because the wrong would inflict a great wound on the character of the American Republic." Henry A. Wise of Virginia said that the treaty was null and void, because there was no assent on the part of both parties. President Van Buren preferred a compromise and gave to the Cherokees two more years in which to withdraw. To this Governor Gilmer objected, because he feared it was another attack upon the sovereignty of the state. He declared his determination to take charge of the removal in person if the Federal government should fail.2 Elias Boudincot, perhaps the most educated Cherokee, after he was converted to emigration, said that John Ross and his party were "ignorant of their true situation, and are so completely blinded as not to see the destruction that awaits them." 1.

Georgians, Gilmer.</page><page sequence="38">322 THE GEORGIA HISTORICAL QUARTERLY By 1838 only two thousand one hundred and three had removed to their new homes. General Winfield Scott was ordered to assume command of the Federal troops with power to collect an additional force, comprising a regiment of infantry and six companies of dragoons. He was to put the Indians in motion at once, and to call upon the Governors of Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and North Carolina for militia and volunteers, not exceeding four thousand in number. During the summer, six thousand were under the direc- tion of the officers of the army. John Ross finally agreed to go, and at his request the Cherokees were to remove themselves, and be allowed sixty-five dollars and eighty- eight cents for the cost of removal. December 4, 1838, the last party of the Cherokees took up their westward march. Ross said that 13,149 removed under his direction, for which he received $486,939.50. The one sad thing that stand out above everything else in regard to their removal, is that nearly one fourth of the emigrants died on the way side. According to Captain Stevenson, who received them on arrival, there were only only 11,504; Captain Page, the disbursing agent, said that of the sixteen thousand that left for the West, there were only 11,721 to reach their new home.</page></plain_text>
