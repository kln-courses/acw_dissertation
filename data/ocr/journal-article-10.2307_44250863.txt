This paper examines competing visions for the future Hanford landscape focusing on the narratives told by agriculturists and environmental preservationists. I show that their narratives, what I call 'future-histories', rely on historical geographies of the region to make moral as well as material arguments about the future uses of the landscape. The example of Hanford future-histories leads to several conclusions about landscapes. First, that landscapes are both material and symbolic: they require both physical and mental labour. Second, that an ontology of landscapes must take seriously the work of nature, and moreover that people necessarily impute and ascribe meaning to that labour. The essay seeks to promote a relational and solidly materialist ontology of the physical and mental labours necessary for the production of future-historical landscapes. Think back to a decision by a tiny handful of men more than half a century ago who put us on a course of action that got us here tonight and how very different it is that we are going to be making choices in the next coupte of years that will affect huge areas potentially for centuries. It really is a profound thing that you are engaged in. And so I ask you here tonight to take the long view. [Land use at Hanford] is, in fact, one of those great questions that we rarely get to think about.1 This use paper planning examines process the at the influence Hanford of nuclear competing site narratives in south-eastern on a post-Cold Washington War State. land use planning process at the Hanford nuclear site in south-eastern Washington State.

More theoretically, I will use the land-use planning process to argue that narratives of landscapes are neither groundless fictions nor meaningless description. Landscapes are both material and symbolic. They are products of corporeal labour with material nature - the work of hands in soil and lungs breathing. But landscapes are also a product of labours of the mind - the study, contemplation and organization of landscape knowledge using various discursive strategies such as history, biography, and science. Landscapes are best understood as constitutive of people's ideas, their work, and material nature itself. Likewise, a story about a landscape, be it history, biography or science, is itself material and symbolic. The seductive alternative is that stories are no more than a system of signs, a view that falsely divides the world into two incommensurable ontological dimensions: one that is experienced but has no meaning and another with meaning but no experience. This insidious ontology allows scientists to claim that their stories contain nothing but the objective facts, and literary critics to claim that stories have no material basis. A material-semiotic ontology of stories and landscapes argues that meaning, morals and purposes are necessarily bound to earth, air, and people. The story about land-use planning at Hanford told here illustrates the material-semiotic life of stories and the landscapes that inhabit them. Hanford is a land of superlatives. Due in part to its designation as the first plutonium production factory in the world, it became one of the most worked landscapes imaginable. Its inception as a plutonium factory initiated arguably the most rapid and well-co-ordinated industrial deployment of labour in American history. Over the course of the Cold War it would become the most contaminated landscape in the country. Now, in the era of clean-up, Hanford has become perhaps the most studied landscape on earth. All of this labour has been in the service of some meaningful purpose and plan: nationalism and defence, moral responsibility and the protection of human health. The meanings people ascribe to the landscape today will influence the morphology of the future landscape even if they do not control future interpretations. After all, people maintained old but also conjured up new meanings for Hanford's landscape throughout its 57-year history, despite the intense secrecy that surrounded it. The future land-use planning process is a forum where people express these meanings for Hanford's past and use them to comprehend and shape its future in what I call future-histories. The following section is a brief recapitulation of Hanford as a plutonium production facility, the better to understand the context of later stories. Enframing Hanford Hanford as we know it today began with an idea: that plutonium, a substance all but unknown in nature, could be manufactured from naturally occurring uranium 238. Making plutonium would be a dangerous task. General Leslie Groves, responsible for the project, searched for a large, vacant landscape, distant from human habitation, with ready water supply to cool the production reactors, defensible from invasion, having reasonable transportation access and easy building sites. After Groves saw the Hanford landscape he 36</page><page sequence="3">Future histories of Hartford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape wrote favourably that 'most of the area was sagebrush suitable only for sheep ... the total population was small and most of the farms did not appear to be of any great value.'2 Just weeks later, in early 1943, the federal government began acquiring private land by condemnation and public land through established transfer processes. In all, the new site encompassed 640 square miles of sagebrush prairie, sand dunes, hillside grasslands, wetlands, nearly 50 miles of the Columbia River and the areas formerly occupied by towns of White Bluffs, Hanford and their associated orchards (Figure 1). By May 1944, 47 000 people were at work on hundreds of new buildings. The first manager of the Hanford project, a specially created arm of the Army Corps of Engineers FIGURE 1 This infrared aerial photo of Hanford shows the surrounding cropland irrigated by the CBP The dark thread is the Colombia River next to the reactors. The border is approximate. 37</page><page sequence="4">Doug Mercer called the Manhattan Engineering District (MED), drew labourers from throughout the region, even nationally. Of course, the technical expertise required to build the one-of- a-kind facilities had to be imported from all over the world. Manual and mental labourers together built the plutonium processing and separation facilities, called the 200 and 300 areas, as far as possible away from population centres. Along the Columbia River they built the first full-scale plutonium production reactor in the world, ambiguously christened 'B'. These workers lived in barracks near the two major construction sites for the initial construction phase, then later in the south-east corner of the site that would, in the 1960s, become the Ail-American City of Richland. Secrecy was crucial. Few knew the purpose of the massive effort, even among the labourers of the mind. Groves designed the administrative structure of the MED and Hanford such that the chain of command for each division - procurement, construction, design, etc. - remained entirely separate until it converged at his authority. This structure, called 'stovepiping', made it difficult for anyone in the organization1 to understand the scope or piece together the purpose of the work. The legacy of stovepiping continues to hinder clean-up efforts today. But from a civil engineering perspective the system worked exceptionally well, and by 26 September 1944 the B reactor was in operation.3 Plutonium for the first nuclear test exploded in the Alamogordo Desert and that for the Nagasaki bomb was made in the B reactor. Two-thirds of the weapons-grade plutonium manufactured in the US during the Cold War would eventually be made at Hanford.4 Decommissioned in 1968, B is now a national historic monument but remains too contaminated for public visits. Richlanders were immensely proud of their work at Hanford and that pride has become part of its iconography.5 The demographic and economic changes brought by Hanford operations to the region have been permanent. Average employment at Hanford since the first influx of employees has been nearly 15 000. Currently, about 65 per cent of total employment, and something of the order of 85 per cent of indirect and induced employment income, is derived from Hanford.6 Hanford employees were relatively well paid, an island of affluence in a fairly poor region. Income levels are high because so many labourers of the mind work at Hanford. Richland has among the highest rate of PhDs per capita of any town in the US, its principal rivals being other isolated DOE company towns such as Los Alamos, Idaho Falls and Savanna River. While in the first years the speed of production was of paramount importance, Hanford scientists also studied the environmental and health effects of plutonium production. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), a five-member civilian panel created by the Atomic Energy Act in 1946, managed these efforts. Most of these latter scientists were located in the Medical Instruments Division, and its first strong leader was H.M. Parker. This division included the aquatics, health effects, and monitoring branches. Their work would lay the foundations for the new field of health physics. By the 1960s Hanford research division and other AEC research offices like it were leaders in systematic ecology. The importance of such labour increased in the 1970s as the Cold War thawed, coupled with the emergence of a potent environmental consciousness. That new consciousness led to new environmental legislation that would fundamentally change priorities at Hanford. Throughout those years the AEC claimed it was exempt from such laws as the 38</page><page sequence="5">Future histories of Hanford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and from virtually every other federal and State Law governing air and water quality and waste management; but the Supreme Court eventually differed and required it to comply. The AEC hired staff to organize and plan production around new environmental, public and occupational health requirements. The mandate of the AEC broadened to conservation when portions of Hanford's buffer zone on its north slope of the Columbia River were designated in 1974 to be wildlife areas. The area, called the Wahluke Slope, will figure prominently later in this paper. By the early 1980s Hanford employment began to climb, increasing in response not only to new environmental regulation but also to the Reagan Administration's rekindling of the Cold War arms race.7 In 1989, as the Soviet Union crumbled, the DOE (which replaced the AEC in 1977) made beleaguered and belated admissions that their past waste disposal practices might have put site workers and the public at risk.8 Manufacturing plutonium required a whole host of chemicals and raw materials: solvents, anticorrosive agents, radioactive ores and much more. Virtually all these ingredients, and the strange new materials that were produced when they were mixed together, became waste. At first, managing agencies spread these wastes among Hanford's scraggly sagebrush swales, in manmade evaporation ponds and trenches, and dumped them into the Columbia River.9 Eventually engineers designed, and labourers built, 177 huge underground tanks to receive these miscellaneous liquids. At best the record of what went into these tanks is poor, and the resulting chemical brews are so complex and volatile that even their description remains elusive. Some of the tanks have leaked.10 The DOE claimed it was safe to walk around the majority of Hanford's land, despite the potpourri of potentially deadly concoctions that lay underfoot.11 Some of the materials slowly percolated downward through the vadose zone, into groundwater, and crept toward the Columbia River. The evidence now indicates that some has in fact reached the river. Plutonium itself is extraordinarily dangerous, and not just in bombs. If inhaled, a single dust-speck- sized particle can kill a person. Particles of plutonium are lodged in the air ducts of old buildings, behind peeling paint and cracked foundations and mixed in the liquid waste tanks. Many of the other wastes - including strontium 90, cobalt 60, caesium 137, tritium and uranium 238 - are also deadly. While some waste materials from Hanford have already decayed into inert substances, such as thyroid cancer-causing 1-131, dozens of others will persist in the environment for thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years.12 Plutonium's half-life is 24 000 years. These very material realities have profound implications for knowledge production, labour needs and politics at Hanford. Already, the DOE's budgeting demands have dramatically changed. It created a new office responsible for environmental restoration and management that now commands over 60 per cent of the total budget.13 At Hanford this averages out at $1.5 billion annually. Estimates of the costs of cleaning up Hanford range up to $100 billion.14 Depending on future technological developments, contamination surveys and desired degrees of clean-up, Hanford may become the largest land reclamation project in American history. What will the future Hanford landscape look like? Whose dreams will become reality? What politics will enable it? Whose labour will be needed? 39</page><page sequence="6">Doug Mercer What is a landscape? The questions posed above cannot be answered without some consideration of basic ontological and epistemological issues. What is a landscape? How do we come to know landscapes?15 In the beginning (at least in the US) was Carl Sauer and the Berkeley school of cultural geography. Reacting against the environmental determinism that had led geography into some disrepute, Sauer sought to place culture, material human activity, at the centre of landscape change. First, he had to set the frame of reference against which he could plot change. Influenced by ecologically oriented biologists, including Odum and Clements, Sauer chose what we might call a past-perfect, the premise of an original condition of nature, untouched by human labour. He argued that these natural landscapes were transformed by human activity into 'cultural landscapes'. Given sufficient attention to detail, a cultural landscape reveals its etiology, the inscriptions of people's activities and intentions in nature, through an objective reading of its morphology.16 Thus Sauer's ontology of landscapes was premised on a conceptualization human culture as separate from nature. The cultural landscapes that result from interaction of the two are epistemologically objectifÃ¬able phenomena, according to Sauer. Given a discerning eye, one could read human and natural history in a landscape. Beginning in the 1970s, the work of Denis Cosgrove, Steven Daniels and Jim and Nancy Duncan (among others) began to shift the focus in landscape geography toward representation and circulation of meanings rather than the material transformation of landscapes.17 Duncan's seminal work, City as text , brought contemporary literary theory into the heart of landscape scholarship. He showed that rulers of the historical city of Kandy on the island of Lanka used landscapes as a signifying system 'through which a social system is communicated, reproduced, experienced, and explored'.18 Those endowed with social power used landscapes as a semiotic device to make their power appear to be part of the natural order. Duncan's most original contribution was to show how landscapes deployed textual tropes such as metaphor, synecdoche and irony to convey meaning. The great legacy left by textual approaches was to demonstrate forcefully that the landscape might be read in a myriad of ways - that meaning was not stable even given the same 'text'.19 Conversely, intertextual analysis has perhaps distracted geographers from the materiality of landscapes. Where Sauer conceptualized people and nature separately, geographers following in the landscape-as-text tradition commonly elide (literally, write over) material landscapes focusing on the circulation of meaning. Geographers writing in this tradition seem so wary of the dreadful taint of mimetic positivism that they waver agnostically between epistemological and ontological idealism and materialism.20 A critic of intertextual approaches is Don Mitchell. Although not seeking a return to Sauer's simple conceptualization of cultural landscapes, he would like to see a return to materiality. Whereas Duncan focuses on cosmology and plans, Mitchell privileges the labour of human hands and hoes, what he called an 'ontology of labour' - the human labour that went into manufacturing the landscape.21 Mitchell adopts an economic and political approach informed by the Marxist scholarship of Raymond Williams, Gramsci and Stuart Hall. Despite their differences, Mitchell's analysis of the central California landscape shares a similar insight with Duncan: that people built and maintained a 40</page><page sequence="7">Future histories of Hartford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape landscape to convey a particular meaning. Behind the iconography of Jefferson's agrarian ideal - bucolic fields, stately farmhouses and the appearance of political and social order - worked migrant labourers, toiling under the merciless Central Valley summer sun, whose story was displaced by the powerful networks of landowners' relationship to governments and consumers. At times Mitchell's 'ontology of labour' gives the impression that culture and politics are incidental artefacts of the means of production (the landscape being another product of production). He recently made more explicit which politics he believes structure power relations in society, including sexual identity and gender politics and labour politics. He is not without allies in landscape scholarship and the broader literature on productions of nature.22 A point of agreement between intertextual and materialist landscape scholars, shared also in this paper, is that landscapes (or at least interpretations of landscapes) are contested. People use their political and economic power to create and maintain a particular social order and landscapes are an important tool in that enterprise. To use Mitchell's definition: Landscape is thus best understood as a kind of produced, lived, and represented space constructed out of the struggles, compromises, and temporarily settled relations of competing social actors: it is both a thing (or a suite of things), as Sauer would have it, and a social process, at once solidly material and ever changing.23 That is landscapes have no essential or fixed identity. They are always represented by people and so must necessarily be a social process. Even the contours of taken-for- granted objects (such as what constitutes a landscape) could be renegotiated, a perspective drawn selectively from the social study of science.24 What Mitchell does not make explicit but which is central to the literature on the sociology of science is that nature itself is an actor in the agonistic negotiation of its ontological existence. If we incorporated landscapes as actors in their own production and accepted that people's semiotic deployments are in part produced and shaped by material experience, we would have an explicitly material-semiotic ontology of landscapes. Further, if we accepted that landscapes are products of necessary compromises between material and semiotic actors then we would find power (or work or labour) as a network of relations.25 Richard White, a historian, has written arguably the best landscape narrative in this nascent relational and material-semiotic epistemological tradition. In his history of the Columbia River, White wrote: Arguments over the river proceed as if everyone speaks about one river in one tongue. But, in fact, this is a river subdivided in to separate spaces whose users speak to each other in a Babel of discourses: law, religion, nature talk, economics, science, and more ... As the century comes to an end, the river we have partially created changes before our eyes, mocking our supposed control. It changes, and as it changes, it makes clear the insufficiencies of our own science, society, and notions of justice and value.26 In this passage, White argues that people sought to explain the river and its purposes in a myriad ways, hoping to make it behave according to their designs, like a machine. They failed. The river remained part organic, unpredictable, because it was also a product of nature. White's strategy for narrating this theme treats the work of nature and people as 41</page><page sequence="8">Doug Mercer a network of relations linked by the flow of energy or work. His narrative strategy eclipses the simple binary of nature and society (where society has mitigated agency over nature, but not vice versa) that has hampered much of political ecology and environmental history. The book's passages about Hanford question the validity of making distinctions between the worlds of humans and nature. 'Everything at Hanford seemed to produce its opposite, and then blur the distinctions between them.'27 Plutonium was largely unknown in nature, but production of plutonium 'created space in which nonhuman species could survive'.28 Over time people discovered and gave meaning to the natures that cracked asphalt roads, burrowed into compacted soils and old evaporation ponds and eroded mounds of contaminated earth. As White demonstrates with his history of the Columbia River, people take any number of purposeful discursive paths - science, art, history, biography - to give their intentions power in the society of humans and nature. Nature, of course, has no purpose in the sense of intentionality, but this does not mean that it cannot act, participating in its own future as if it has agency Whereas the agency of people may be the couplet of action and inten- tion, the agency of nature is its ability to act, and its purposes are immanent to its action.29 This may seem a small difference, but I think it is an important one. Scholars have too often treated the landscape as if it were inert, a passive resource to be shaped and manip- ulated by people, like putty. But one cannot turn putty into gold. If overheated, it will crack. Sculptors have to work with their medium. Sauer saw landscapes as malleable by the hands of culture, but at least material earth and human labour were explicit. Duncan takes landscapes as palimpsests, parchments upon which people wrote and rewrote mean- ing. His landscapes recede behind people's ideas of them, a reflecting screen rather than a participant. Mitchell, in his rejection of idealism and fundamentalist return to material- ism, implicitly accepts a putty-like role for landscapes as had Sauer, but now privileging the economy of labouring hands and backs above mind and nature. We need a conceptu- alization of landscapes that is neither putty nor palimpsest. With the foregoing in mind, I offer these suggestions for conceptualizing landscapes. Landscapes are socio-material processes that, due to the action of both people and nature, continuously undergo morphological change (in the most material sense) and revision (in the sense that landscapes are viewed by people). Landscapes are the contested networks of material-semiotic relationships, provisional alliances between people and things, and contested representations viewed from a necessarily situated perspective. We might understand landscapes as the semiotic and material actions of people (both the work of hands and minds) and the agency of the landscape itself, animated by the ongoing struggles over both a landscape's material- semiotic territory and semiotic-material meaning. Such a landscape would be alive with uncertainty and ambiguity, always resisting people's efforts to control it semiotically or materially. People must ally themselves with the material landscape and the meanings people assign to it if they want a meaningful role in its future morphology. The following analysis of the Hanford future land-use planning process turns to texts - scientific documents, maps, stories, position papers, public presentations - based on the premise that they represent, though not mimetically, real landscapes, and act in very material ways in the production of new landscapes. The power of these discursive 42</page><page sequence="9">Future histories of Hanford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape strategies relies on their allegiances to people and the landscape itself. Stories must convince people and institutions that they represent the meaning and material reality of Hanford. Effective story-tellers were aware of the need for both types of ally. Political actors involved in the future land-use planning process took very seriously both meaning and materiality. They knew that a powerful story was one that allied itself with the materiality of the landscape. HanforÄs future land-use planning process In 1992, four years after their change in mission, DOE managers published a notice of intent to write an environmental impact statement which would evaluate a range of alternative land uses that would assure compliance with a legally enforceable agreement between agencies called the Tri-Party Agreement. The document would be called the Hanford Remedial Action Environmental Impact Statement (HRA-EIS). The DOE sought to link land use to clean-up standards, as had been done for contaminated sites elsewhere. For this reason the DOE linked the HRA-EIS to a Comprehensive Land Use Plan.30 If they could establish restrictive land uses for parts of Hanford they could decrease the cost of clean-up required by the Comprehensive Environmental Restoration, Compensation and Liability Act, 1980 (commonly called the Superfund Act). Residential standards generally require very thorough clean-up and are thus very costly to implement. On the other hand an industrial-use scenario can be much cheaper because the regulator (usually EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency), making certain assumptions about worker activity on the site, assumes the likelihood of exposure is low. In their newfound regard for public participation, the DOE contracted with a Seattle consulting firm to establish a citizens' working group to identify desirable future land uses for Hanford. The working group eventually included representatives from agricultural, environmental, local government and tribal interests. (THbes, not appreciating being relegated to stakeholder status, chose to participate only in government-to-government deliberations with the DOE and state agencies.)31 The working group's efforts laid the early foundations for the HRA-EIS and presaged struggles over land use for the next six years and more. The working group largely agreed that the central plateau area would probably remain a waste management site for the foreseeable future. There was somewhat less agreement over the Arid Lands Ecology Reserve (ALE), an area the DOE has managed as a natural area preserve since the 1960s. Most believed the area should remain protected, although agricultural interests believed at least some of the land was suitable for farming. There was considerable disagreement over the proper use of the northern third of the site, managed cooperatively with state and federal wildlife agencies, called the Wahluke Slope. Agricultural interests predictably advocated farming and environmental interests favoured preservation. The DOE's solicitation of advice stimulated a mini-land rush for control over Hanford's future. Political actors (individuals, organizations, governments and agencies) mustered their forces in an effort to control the HRA-EIS. They accumulated information that they could use to construct their own vision for Hanford. Local governments claimed the authority to plan future uses of Hanford land. Area counties saw the shift to clean-up at 43</page><page sequence="10">Doug Mercer Hanford as an opportunity to reclaim land that they believed belonged in agricultural production. In 1992, commissioners of the agriculturally dependent Grant and Franklin counties adopted a land-use plan for the Wahluke Slope that lies in their jurisdiction and dubbed it the Wahluke 2000 Plan. Local and national environmental groups such as The Nature Conservancy (TNC), Sierra Club and Audubon Society advocated continued federal protected status for Hanford, preferably by the Department of Interior Agencies. The focal point of the battle was the 51-mile Hanford Reach of the Columbia River that flows through the nuclear reservation and buffer-zone lands like the ALE and Wahluke Slope. Preservationists advocated and supported an EIS written by the Department of the Interior to assess the ecological and scenic values of the Columbia Reach. Published in 1994, that EIS concluded that Hanford had sufficient natural virtues to be in some kind of protected status.32 The DOE plodded along toward a rational engineering solution to the land-use issues across the site, including the Hanford Reach. DOE planners built a geographical information system (GIS) containing all the data they could find about Hanford's environmental conditions. They compiled dozens of thematic layers for such characteristics as topography, vegetation, geomorphology, estimated extent of groundwater contamination, location of known waste disposal sites, cultural resource sites (such as known Native American gravesites, and the old Hanford town site), seeps and springs, location of threatened and endangered species and their habitats and legal constraints imposed by environmental laws. Their preferred alternative was to be the 'optimal use of site land' based 'on the principles of ecosystem management and sustainable development'. 33 If finalized in a record of decision, their preferred alternative would become a legally binding contract, the official template for the future landscape at Hanford. Meanwhile, Washington's congressional representatives squared off over protection of the river. Democratic Senator Patty Murray fired the opening salvo. She proposed a bill in 1996 (Senate Bill 2000) that would designate the Hanford Reach a Wild and Scenic River. Murray's senatorial nemesis, Republican Slade Gorton, blocked the measure, while his ally, the US representative for the Hanford region, Doc Hastings, proposed an alternative House bill that would establish a local area commission to manage the Reach and surrounding lands. Both preservationists and agriculturists, along with their champions, Murray and Hastings respectively, rooted their narratives in Hanford history. The ostensible theme of the debate was local versus federal control, but the implicit debate was about what form of labour would be permitted along the river and its surrounding lands. What constitutes appropriate future uses of land has everything to do with history. Grant and Franklin counties laid out their Wahluke 2000 plan in public meetings and comment periods. The Wahluke 2000 map is a clear expression of what the counties thought the DOE ought to do with the north slope: turn it over to county control for agricultural development (Figure 2). Accompanying the land use map was this historical justification: Prior to the establishment of the Hanford Atomic Works, the Wahluke Slope was a significant homestead farming area. There is abundant visual evidence of the roads, home sites and former communities carved out by hardy settlers who recognized the unique potential of the Wahluke 44</page><page sequence="11">Future histories of Hartford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape S Ã I 'S I I &lt;2 Â§ ' ! li P .2 &lt;Ã *! i 8 5 Â¡ CM Q E I jjjjiii1'' Va â¢ !H1!Ã¬iL o o s a Â«Ã® Ã¤ Â§ i o WÅÃ­ &lt; ISlO i i ! fp^tf f. i 1 I ! mm nui / ! 51 ; i I y â  Â® &lt; &gt;.

Far from being ancient history, this is the evidence of recent agricultural development, and should be considered as such. The settlers of the communities of White Bluffs, Wahluke and the rest of the Wahluke Slope, many of whom are still alive today, were displaced from homes and property in the interest of national security and witnessed the complete destruction of their years of effort. In the end, virtually no significant use was ever made of their land, except to serve as a security buffer zone. Had this land remained in private ownership, there is no doubt whatsoever that it would have been fully developed for irrigated agriculture today.34 The narrative trajectory traced by this passage swoops upward toward the fulfilment of the region's agrarian ideal, establishing a clear moral imperative for allowing agriculture on the north slope. In a sense, many Grant and Franklin county residents believed that agricultural designation in a land use plan would simply acknowledge the inevitable. 'Places like this present a kind of last frontier for young farmers to get a start. The fact of the matter is, that land will be farmed. Eventually,' said a Grant County resident.35 Stakeholders supporting preservation also used history to support their vision for future land use at Hanford. Among the most influential and knowledgeable was The Nature Conservancy (TNC) which had been conducting biological sampling on the Hanford site since 1992. In spring 1996, on the eve of the DOE's release of the draft HRA-EIS, the TNC distributed a special issue of their magazine, Washington wildlands , on Hanford, hoping to increase awareness of the ecological qualities of the site. The issue began with an essay, 'Balance and common sense', by the editor, Gordon Todd, that framed Hanford history very differently from the terms of Wahluke 2000. Following good rhetorical practice TNC, like Wahluke 2000 supporters, extracted from the history of the Hanford region a narrative trajectory that supported its conclusions about future land use. My dad and elder cousins, those who grew up in the Columbia Basin during the Great Depression, saw these lands that buffer the Hanford nuclear site as the last remnant of what their childhood home was like. In their 70s now, they remember the majesty of the desert that once extended unbroken for hundreds of miles, but is now largely gone forever. These are people who value their Washington heritage and their home. They also believe in fairness, balance and common sense. But these values and the natural lands at Hanford are threatened. Despite Hanford's rare natural riches and its centuries of history, there are people who want to convert most of the Hanford lands into farms and other development.36 Todd's central theme - a majestic landscape under siege from agricultural development - was typical of preservation-oriented stakeholders and their organizations. Preservation of Hanford's biological resources was popular, especially down-river in Portland and upwind in Seattle, and increasingly in the Tri-Cities of Richland, Kennewick and Pasco adjacent to Hanford. A Hanford host county survey of public attitudes toward land use at Hanford indicated support for continued preservation of the Arid Lands Ecology Preserve (ALE), as well as other portions of the site. Even the Republican-dominated Richland City Council supported federal management of the Columbia River corridor. An Audubon Society survey of Tri-City residents found that 70 per cent supported the Council's position. Nearly 60 public interest organizations ranging from local to national in membership would eventually submit comments to the final EIS advocating preservation of most of Hanford. 46</page><page sequence="13">Future histories of Hanford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape In 1996, after a flurry of public meetings, much political haranguing and $15 million spent, the DOE released its 'optimal' landscape engineering plans for clean-up. It called for a mix of potential uses, the dominant uses being preservation and light recreation. Agricultural and preservation-oriented stakeholders as well as tribes excoriated the 1996 DOE draft EIS. Most Grant and Franklin county residents believed at least that some of the clean land should be turned over to agriculture. Richland and Benton county eco- nomic development interests felt that the plan did not allow for sufficient residential and industrial opportunities on the site. Preservationists were mostly appeased by the draft plan but sought more restrictions on livestock grazing and development. Tribal nations and most environmentally minded activists did not like the plan because it implied incom- plete clean-up (perhaps even less than in an industrial scenario). Local governments believed they should control land use for areas the DOE no longer needed for its mission. DOE went back to the GIS database, seeking a way to salvage their investment in a rational planning approach premised on continued federal ownership of the site. It took another four years to produce a significantly scaled-down document that they renamed the Final Comprehensive Land-Use Plan Environmental Impact Statement (CLUP).37 To demonstrate that it had seriously considered stakeholders' plans, the CLUP used stakeholder drawn maps as its alternatives. The maps were drawn by the Nez Perce tribe's Department of Environmental Restoration, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla, a coalition of local governments (including the City of Richland, Benton County, Franklin County and Grant County's Wahluke 2000 plan), a coalition of natural resources trustees supported by preservationists who advocated a federal stewardship role for managing valuable national resources on the Hanford site, and a DOE alternative. The Wahluke 2000 and Natural Resources Trustees plans are shown in Figure 2. The maps illustrate in the pithiest way Wahluke Slope counties' and preservationists' divergent dreams for the Hanford landscape. The map on the left is the local government's plan including the city of Richland, Benton County, and Wahluke 2000 plans. The Wahluke portion of the plan would provide for agriculture, mining and grazing; however, a strip along the river and three small upland areas would be reserved for wildlife preservation. Causing particular concern among environmental preservationists were the potential consequences of farming in the so-called Red Zone. The AEC created the Red Zone to protect easily eroded white sandstone bluffs that could slough into the river, damaging salmon spawning grounds directly below. There are three federally listed salmon runs, spawning 85 per cent of the wild salmon from the main stem of the Columbia River. On the right in Figure 2 is the Natural Resources Trustee land use plan. It would place virtually all of Hanford in preservation status, including the Wahluke Slope. Some mining and grazing might be allowed in the most heavily affected areas, and waste management would expand in the central plateau as well as in the eastern portion of the site, where uranium enrichment and plutonium extraction had occurred. No land whatsoever would be available for agriculture. What histories inspired these maps? How did stakeholders construct and use history to frame their dreams for Hanford's future? The next portion of the paper focuses on the Natural Resources Trustee (focusing on TNC's support for the plan) and local govern- 47</page><page sequence="14">Doug Mercer merits' plans (focusing on the Wahluke 2000 component). Their visions represent two dominant logics about landscapes: it is improved through work, or alternately, nature is degraded by human work. The two visions privilege different sorts of labour: agricultur- ists the gritty work of human hands, TNC the labour of scientific investigation and the work of nature.38 Both rely on nature being amenable to their plans. Focus on the tension between these two Anglo-American orientations should not be read as dismissive of the importance of the alternative maps supplied by two Native American governments. In the Hanford context, Native American narratives of the Hanford landscape are just now emerg- ing from many decades of silence imposed by the dominant Anglo narratives and legal sys- tem. I did not have the access to tribal communities or their histories which would have been necessary for a fair analysis of their land-use plans. The issues of tribal sovereignty and land tenure deserve more expert and appraisal than I can manage here.39 Material-semiotic actors of the Hanford landscape The material landscape of Hanford was both something from which people drew meaning and for which they had a purpose. Meaning, purpose for and knowledge about the Hanford landscape were mutually constitutive, bound up in historical relationships with the material landscape and expectations for its future. Throughout the land-use planning process, stakeholders invoked diverse agents to influence the HRA-EIS and land-use plan: their constituencies, history, meaning, and scientific knowledge about Hanford. From these historically constituted productions, people constructed what we might call future- histories, narratives that linked historical relationships to the landscape with prospective landscapes. Future-histories derived meaning from and conferred meaning on landscapes based on selected aspects of people's historical experience. They privileged certain kinds of work, biological conditions and political arrangements. Future-histories had to conscript the landscape in their stories, too. Agriculturists had to demonstrate that the land was fecund, and preservationists that pristine nature had reasserted itself. In an analysis of two historical accounts of the Great Plains, environmental historian William Cronon argued that historical narratives necessarily invoke meaning: Narrative succeeds to the extent that it hides the discontinuities, ellipses, and contradictory experiences that would undermine the intended meaning of its story. Whatever its overt purpose, it cannot avoid a covert exercise of power: it inevitably sanctions some voices while silencing others. A powerful narrative reconstructs common sense to make the contingent seem determined and the artificial seem natural.40 To paraphrase Cronon, narrative succeeds when it makes a past-perfect from a turbulent stream of historical events. I use the phrase 'past-perfect' in the grammatical sense, to indicate that the order of events occurred prior to a point of reference. In this paper, the points of reference are the public meetings where stakeholders debated the future of Hanford's landscape. To retain their logical coherence, narratives filter events that belong in the narrative and those which do not. A narrative that makes a series of contingent historical events seem determined suggests that the future is also predictable. A future-history is a narrative trajectory established by a past-perfect projected into the 48</page><page sequence="15">Future histories of Hanford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape future. Thus future-histories are narratives that people tell about the past that, because of the appearance of order, legitimate a particular future land use. Following good rhetorical practice, future-historians framed the region's history to justify a particular future for Hanford. To preservationists, Hanford accidentally but fortunately protected ecological values that would otherwise have been trammelled by development. For agriculturists, Hanford unjustly removed land that should have been open to agricultural production. The following pages will trace the past-perfects of two narratives but then show how those thematic trajectories were constructs of a particular way of thinking about landscapes and history. The best way to demonstrate the situated nature of a past-perfect is to put alternative histories in conversation with each other. This is not to imply that the narratives are false, rather that the past was not so perfect and the future far more contingent than either story implies. Agriculturists' history of the Hanford region The history of the Columbia Basin was ripe with facts which agriculturists harvested to support an ascendant narrative of the region's development and which, in the context of the new clean-up mission and land-use planning at Hanford, inspired the Wahluke 2000 plan.41 Early Anglo-Americans viewed the Columbia Basin as virtually empty and nearly desolate but potentially productive, not unlike General Groves in his assessment of Hanford. Whereas Groves believed the land suitable for plutonium production to protect democracy, early Anglo settlers believed that with proper husbandry the landscape could produce both the fruits of the earth and agrarian social order. The landscape was amenable. Given water and work and a vision, it became productive. The Columbia Basin population grew tenfold in the closing decades of the nineteenth century. Inspired by the impressive yields, settlers pushed up into the Horse Heaven and Rattlesnake Hills on the southern border of Hanford, despite difficulties accessing water. The Wahluke Slope itself was hot real estate after big wheat harvests in 1897-98. As the region grew more affluent, proud residents dubbed it the 'inland empire', as if to assure themselves of its manifest destiny. Manifest destiny, however, did not come without good planning both as a material and as a rhetorical practice. Late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century settlers, along with state and federal representatives, envisioned a certain form of settlement based on the Jeffersonian agrarian ideal. The federal Homestead Act of 1862 and later the Washington State legislature provided land grants of 160 acres to aspiring farmers as long as they could improve the land 'to help them live better than they are living now'.42 The agrarian vision became the template for the spatial reordering of the landscape. Not all land was equally cooperative. Boosters and agricultural visionaries sought help from the federal government to divert water from the Columbia River to recalcitrant lands. In 1933, the first shovels broke the ground for Grand Coulee Dam, inaugurating the development of the Columbia Basin Project (CBP). The CBP planners expected that Grand Coulee would transform 1 100 000 acres of desert into productive farmland, while Hanford planners condemned 680 square miles for a secret plutonium production factory. It is easy to see how the narratives of agriculturists and the proponents of Grand Coulee 49</page><page sequence="16">Doug Mercer Dam twined together.43 In October 1937 Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke from a pulpit high above two massive concrete buttresses that directed the river to a narrow torrent. Roosevelt's New Deal, back-to-work projects provided part of the justification for the terrific expense of Grand Coulee, but the powerful rhetorical strategy of settlement was what he chose to highlight in his speech. There are thousands of families in this county who are not making good because they are trying to farm on poor land, and I look forward to the day when the valley is dammed up to give the first opportunity to these American families who need some good farm land in place of their present farms.'44 Fully developed, the Grand Coulee Dam would produce greater good for seemingly everyone. CBP planners anticipated that newly available irrigation water would bring a new round of settlement and contribute to state and national economies. The dam would control flooding and improve transportation. Run through turbines, falling water would make lights glow, radios crackle and washing machines spin throughout the region. For a time it seemed as if the inland empire's trajectory seemed assured. But maximizing development of the region required engineering society as well as the landscape. CBP planners successfully enlisted the land's fertility, water resources and people to produce economic and social benefits.45 Planners and legislators codified the economy and ideology of family farm-based agriculture. They gave qualified settlers a piece of the territory if they conformed to the desired social system. Grand Coulee Dam had its own Homestead Act, the Columbia Basin Project Act (CBP Act), which strictly defined the size of single family 'farm units' based on productivity, and doled out one 'unit' per family. Estimates of the land's potential productivity defined the number of viable farm families. In effect, CBP planners calculated the social output of dams and ditches in terms of numbers of people and value of crops. The law required settlers to reside on acreage they owned, grow much of their own food and sell the rest to local markets.46 In effect, the law required settlers to join the region's dominant ascendant narrative of agriculture.47 Planners could not discipline the landscape or society sufficiently to make the future entirely predictable. Speculators illegally bought land they had no intention of farming, instead hoping to resell later at a profit. In response, state lawmakers created the Washington Antispeculation Act of 1937, which established acreage, tenancy and resale restrictions to maintain the intended social order. Average farm size quickly exceeded the legal limits set by the Homestead Act and CBP planners. By 1955 irrigated farms in the CBP were nearly twice the size of farms in other parts of the north-west. Increasing numbers leased their allotment such that over 60 per cent of the land was rented by 1956. These non-owner tenants were more efficient than were owner-operators.48 Crop choices changed, too, making nonsense out of CBP-produced projections.49 Planners expected that the common cash crops would be beets for the sugar market, wheat and corn. No one in the Hanford region grows beets as a cash crop today, and precious few grow corn. While the population did grow as the planners anticipated, the character of population growth proved as unpredictable as agricultural output. Town planners in Moses Lake, just north of Hanford, projected that their 'population growth would be governed almost entirely by farm settlement'.50 But declining numbers of immigrants were actually farmers. The hearty settler, envisioned by CBP legislators, intent on growing 50</page><page sequence="17">Future histories of Hartford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape subsistence or small-scale cash crops, was being replaced by a new generation of settlers who more interested in well-tended lawns. The Hanford region was changing despite the concerted efforts of social engineers and lawmakers to maintain their past-perfect. Whereas construction of the Grand Coulee Dam fitted into the ascendant narrative of the inland empire, federal condemnation of 640 square miles of land along the Columbia River by the Manhattan Engineering District (MED) for Hanford proved awkward. The northern third of the withdrawn lands, called the Wahluke Slope, was slated to be part of the CBP, as was the orchard town of Hanford on the south side of the river. Withdrawal of CBP land and other land already under the plough threatened the continued upward trajectory of agricultural development, already wavering from changing farm tenancy patterns. Condemnation of land was reprehensible, but perhaps justifiable for the temporary purposes of national defence. Agriculturists hoped, and gained promises from the AEC, that land would be released for development after it was no longer needed for making plutonium.51 In fact, the AEC released 87 000 acres of land on the Wahluke Slope in 1953, and then more in 1958 in response to the pressure from area residents who wanted to get on with their story of agricultural expansion. Washington's powerful Senator, Henry 'Scoop' Jackson, facilitated the public meetings held in Richland that led to the 1958 release of land. Speakers reiterated the importance of the land to the region's economic development, and said they were more than willing to accept the risk of living in such close proximity to the site.52 Not a peep was heard about wildlife preservation, wilderness or Native Americans, and no one questioned the expertise of Hanford officials. Over the ensuing three decades, through the waxing and waning of the Cold War, the Wahluke Slope remained a sore point to Grant County residents. But it was not until the defence mission ended in 1988 that the next window of opportunity opened to re- establish the rtarrative of agricultural development on Hanford land. The Wahluke 2000 plan adopted by Grand and Franklin counties was designed precisely for this purpose. To ensure that the 'unique opportunity' to reallocate land to agriculture would be taken, explained the Wahluke 2000 commentary, the plan would give special consideration to settlers displaced by condemnation and to 'young farm families'.53 As with the Columbia Basin Act, the Wahluke 2000 plan would impose acreage limitations to ensure against land speculation. Thus, it would extend the past-perfect into the future, a future-history. There are other stories about the region's past that agriculturists either disregard or to which they made only oblique references; the past was not so perfect as the story implied. The comments submitted to the EIS on the Columbia River corridor distinguishes 'recent' from 'ancient history' in order to privilege settler history over alternative histories.54 This was a narrative adjustment to Native American claims about Hanford history Evidence of Native American occupation of the Hanford region dates back 10 000 years.55 Between the time of first European contact and the end of the nineteenth century the land was 'cleared' of Native Americans, including the Wanapum, who occupied the Wahluke Slope. Many of the region's tribal nations signed the treaties in 1855 and 1856 with (then territorial) Governor Stevens guaranteeing signatory tribes use of ceded territories for 'usual and accustomed purposes', a promise local, state and federal governments have in large part since denied.56 Agriculturist narratives rarely 51</page><page sequence="18">Doug Mercer mentioned the cattle and sheep ranching that dominated the Basin's economy before the turn of the century.57 I will spend more time on ranching history as part of another future-history of Hanford, that of preservationists. In future land-use deliberations at Hanford, agricultural supporters offered an imagined (or remembered) future from a simplified past. Public comments in support of the Wahluke 2000 plan framed history with a particular time and geography to justify agricultural development in parts of Hanford. They said that the land could produce a society of farm families and they were right, but the land could also produce other societies of people and nature. One of them, championed by TNC among other organizations, used natural history to argue for preservation of the same lands agriculturists sought to farm. Preservationists' natural history of Hanford Like supporters of the Wahluke 2000 plan, the essay by Gordon Todd in Washington wildlands (quoted above) framed history to justify a particular future land use: ecological preservation. Todd situated Hanford in a geological time scale of natural history to suggest that the intensification of agricultural development was poised to corrupt the last remnants of nature's past-perfect. Conjuring his father's and cousins' memories of Hanford, Todd suggested that youthful perspectives failed to grasp the importance of a natural-history perspective. Given a more expansive view, one would appreciate 'Hanford's rare natural riches and its centuries of history'. Seen from the past-perfect of natural history, agricultural development in the region became a spatially vast but temporally minuscule deviation from the long narrative of unspoiled nature. The theme of untrammelled and delicate nature was also common in preservation-oriented commentary. One tour boat operator's brochure referred to Hanford as 'a place that time forgot', when the 'Columbia River flowed free and salmon spawned in inconceivable numbers'. From a preservationist's perspective, these magisterial images made the time- frame employed by Wahluke 2000 supporters seemed constrained and provincial. Todd's trope of the historical landscapes as pristine was the mirror image of the agriculturists, who viewed unused land as useless land. However, the two strategies were identical in that both tropes protected a privileged past-perfect. The preservationists' past-perfect needed rhetorical interventions to accommodate the region's unfettered past. Whereas in the ascendant narrative of agriculture that inspired the Wahluke 2000 plan, Hanford interrupted the good narrative of development, preservationists saw the establishment of Hanford as a stroke of good fortune. Because Hanford removed the Wahluke Slope from the CBP, a piece of the main story-line, natural history, was fortunately protected from the ravages of development. To quote from TNC 's comment in the HRA-EIS, 'the Hanford Site is home to a spectacular, unduplicated and irreplaceable natural legacy ... it is a vital - and perhaps the single most important - link to preserving and sustaining the diverse plants and animals of the Columbia Basin Ecosystem.'58 Thus the unlikely establishment of Hanford that would become one of the most contaminated places on earth was, at the same time, an island of nature in a sea of development. 52</page><page sequence="19">Future histories of Hanford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape FIGURE 3 The cover of TNC's Washington wildlands special issue on Hanford documents the remnants of an ecological past-perfect (with permission of The Nature Conservancy of Washington) KÃ  IllilllliilSIlSiii JBK I TÃ± ^Ä¼jjÄ¼Ä¼ s III lip PnfÃ¬psl III BB Kl IllilllliilSIlSiii JBK mÄ &amp; ^Ä¼jjÄ¼Ä¼ III lip III BB Kl IPIil ^ - JUbs^KÃUBB^ 53</page><page sequence="20">Doug Mercer Whereas Wahluke 2000 supporters claimed that Native American history was too old to merit consideration, preservationists naturalized Native Americans' historical effects on the landscape. The image of an encroaching ocean of European agriculture on nature's shore relegated aboriginal peoples' lifestyles to little more than a footnote that might read: 'Native Americans had relatively little real impact on the native ecosystem.' Considerable evidence indicated that the region's aboriginal inhabitants altered their landscape in dramatic ways by fire and by crop husbandry, and that they significantly influenced salmon runs.59 Rarely do preservationists acknowledge the ubiquitous effects of cattle and sheep grazing on the Basin's landscape. In fact, ranching dominated the economy before agriculture. Range agronomist J.S. Cotton came to eastern Washington to work on range degradation issues. In 1904 he reported that virtually every coulee and hillside had achieved the nadir of range conditions.60 Range scientists in the early 1900s did their best to find study plots of undisturbed vegetation with little success. Failing to find a large undisturbed area, Cotton established an experimental station on overgrazed Rattlesnake Hill 'to find out what could be done to improve these conditions'.61 These very test plots are now part of what TNC calls the best native shrub-steppe in eastern Washington. The next generation of researchers was even more hard pressed to find good study plots. In 1942, Daubenmire and Colwell had to be satisfied by a quarter-mile strip of 'artificial butte' in Franklin County created by a railroad cut 28 years earlier.62 Even that had been subjected to grazing prior to its isolation. The preservationists' narrative had to negotiate the facts of nature as well as the meanings people assigned to nature. In an ironic twist of meaning, Cotton wrote that 'the heavy over-stocking of the range with sheep, together with the presence of large bands of Indian horses, soon made the greater part of the range land a wilderness'.63 Range degradation, when taken to an extreme, became a 'wilderness', meaning a wasteland, useless to people. Depending in part on the DOE's future land use plan, Rattlesnake Ridge and Wahluke Slope will become a wilderness in the modern semiotic and material sense.64 Maggie Coon, writing for TNC in Washington wildlands , hoped that by preserving the ecological character of Hanford 'we will help create a new vision for this remarkable place and begin to transform Hanford's symbolic legacy'.65 Indeed, if TNC were able to send a message back in time to J.S. Cotton that people were trying to turn Rattlesnake Ridge into a wilderness, Cotton would no doubt be saddened that the ridge had become a useless wasteland. When convenient (which was often), preservationists departed from the historical aspects of natural history and asserted scientific claims to know nature. These claims to nature found their way into Todd's editorial note through the term 'functioning ecosystem', but references to nature's fragility are common among preservationists. Said one science-minded preservationist in a public meeting: 'Vast land areas once existed as a stable desert environment of native plants and grasses adapted to arid conditions . . . weaving an integrated biosphere attuned for survival in an arid environment.'66 Understanding ecosystems was the work not of historians but of ecologists - and ecologists have had a lot to say about Hanford. An ecophysiologist working at Hanford stood on the summit of the ALE and told a reporter, 'All of the earth's surface is being 54</page><page sequence="21">Future histories of Hartford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape disturbed by one animal. To understand the consequences of that we need an area that's undisturbed.'67 Hundreds of ecological researchers have worked at Hanford documenting the works of nature. Environmental groups and natural resource agencies (principally the Department of Interior agencies) used the evidence to help develop the Natural Resources Trustee's land use alternative shown in Figure 2. One biological monitoring effort at Hanford entailed development of a measure for pristine conditions called biological integrity.68 The researchers' premise was that biological integrity could be defined against the baseline measure of 'an unimpaired condition or the quality or state of being complete or undivided; it implies correspondence to some original condition .'69 Change from that baseline condition inherently implied a downward narrative trajectory. Places measured for biological integrity can never aspire to a higher standard than that assigned by scientists to a pristine moment in the past (as defined by the condition biological researchers found in the present). In this way the biological integrity of Hanford land becomes tied to some historical moment, preserved in the land that time forgot. Despite preservationists' hard work incorporating material nature in their stories, both the landscape and history conspired to produce narrative twists that preservationists and TNC preferred to forget. The cover of the Washington wildlands issue on Hanford (Figure 3) is a photograph of two sun-tanned biological technicians grinning like big- game hunters next to their trophy: a new species of plant never catalogued before. (In all, TNC researchers identified 41 species and two sub-species new to science.) The find was exciting and, if one looked no further, unproblematically suggested that Hanford really was a healthy, pristine ecosystem. However, the photograph could tell many other stories depending on the frame of reference. Wisps of the aggressive exotic invader, cheat grass, crowded the indigenous herb. Draped around the botanists' necks were dosimetry tags required for site visitors to monitor radiation exposure.70 The presence of an exotic grass and the possibility of radiation from nearby contaminants were not idle actors in the Hanford landscape, but to the writers in Washington wildlands they were distractions from the narrative of Hanford as a healthy, relatively undisturbed ecosystem. One could easily reverse the narrative and argue that the newly discovered plants were inconsequential aberrations in the inevitable colonization of Hanford by exotic plants! But the goal, as Maggie Coon wrote, was to create a new symbolic legacy of Hanford that TNC and other preservationists could use to enhance certain material aspects of Hanford and its natural history. Requirements for an ontology of landscape Landscapes require nature's labour Narrators of the agricultural and preservationist future-histories constructed their stories in reference to other stories as well as to what people understood of the landscape itself. This brings me back to Mitchell's argument: that the real story of the making of California's Central Valley was that of migrant labour. The lie of the land, he argued, was that field labour was hidden behind icons of pastoral beauty. An unjust economic system 55</page><page sequence="22">Doug Mercer maintained the lie in the service of capital accumulation. Indeed, a history of the making of the California landscape without the story of migrant labour would be impoverished. Similarly, at Hanford many workers were exposed to dangerous materials from its historic operations, and clean-up will surely involve significant occupational risks to those who will dig up contaminated dirt, treat contaminated water and vitrify high-level radioactive waste sludge.71 Stories of labouring hands and backs are unquestionably important. But if we accept the argument that landscapes, including things as well as people, were in constant and covalent acts of landscape production, then the land would tell the truth only when the stories of human and non-human actors were immanent in narratives. Places like Hanford, the Kandyian kingdom and California's Central Valley cannot be understood as derivative of a system of economic relationships between human actors in a passive world.72 This can be read as a cautionary note to Mitchell's efforts to reassert materiality in the production of landscapes. As his story goes, migrant labourers were exploited in vicious and carefully planned manoeuvres of landowners, commonly with government's culpability. The landscape proved an effective ally of landowners because the land was incredibly fertile. Combined with the physical toil of migrant labourers, the (often cruel) organizational acumen of landowners and the work of sun and soil itself, the Central Valley became one of the most productive landscapes on earth. The labour of the landscape as well as of other people cannot be understood without the hard mental labour of making meaning. Hanford scientists, CBP planners and TNC researchers rilÃ«asiifed Hanford's contours, flora, fauna and fertility. The preservationist future-history relied on the work of biologists, citizen-advocates who mapped the labour of non-human nature at work amidst the ageing Cold War buildings and salmon spawning in caesium-contaminated river gravel. Agriculturists watched the wheat grow in dusty soil, apples grow heavy on their trees and birds sing from their branches. People placed these experiences in a particular frame of space and time and represented it in their magazines, newspapers, books and in public meetings and letters to the EIS. Each appealed to the work of the landscape. An ontology of labour that fails to include the hard work of nature and of representing nature will fail to describe, explain or produce just landscapes. Landscapes require meaning Agriculturist and preservationist narratives are unstable when put into conversation with other histories of the landscape. My own history of Hanford and the land-use planning process is also unstable (but I have sensibly protected it from contrary narratives). Each negotiates a complex semiotic and material terrain. Meaning and materiality could not be separated in these stories: one informs the other to say something about what ought to be done at Hanford. In that sense none of these stories is innocent, but does that make any of them disingenuous or even unjust? Many landscape scholars have argued that Naturalizing' meaning in a landscape - that is, to convince people that some work of people on the landscape was part of the natural order - is an attribution of meaning to an amoral landscape. The work seeks to reveal hidden and possibly diabolical deployments of power.73 Olwig's critique of the idolization 56</page><page sequence="23">Future histories of Hartford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape of wilderness landscapes is a good example. Using Yosemite and Mt Rushmore as examples, Olwig shows that landscapes are screens upon which people project meaning. . . . meaning is confused when physical nature is not seen to be an expression of human values but rather is seen to embody those values in and of itself. The values that human's place in physical nature are displaced and obscured when they are made to appear to derive from the objective authority of that nature rather than from a subjective human source. It then becomes difficult to discern the true origin and meaning of these values, and the resulting confusion can be quite diabolical.74 When a landscape does not conform to a desired meaning, people go about refashioning a landscape better to reflect prevailing notions of how it should look. Successive rulers of Kandy, described by Duncan in City as text , had cityscapes built to represent how they wanted people to think of them as kings, celestial beings and gods. California's Central Valley only appeared to be the agrarian ideal. For those whose labour actually shaped the land, its pastoral beauty was, to use Mitchell's word-play, a lie of the lanÄ. Similarly, future-historians of Hanford wanted the landscape to represent (or reflect) their story. Their past-perfects attempted to neutralize elements of Hanford history that might have destabilized their logical coherence. If past-perfect achieved the level of doxa, a reflexively understood and uncontested mode of thought, then they became part of the permanence of a place, protected from the contingencies of history by the imagination of people.75 This was precisely the kind of 'diabolical' naturalization of landscape meaning of which Olwig wrote.76 But deriving meaning from landscapes is both an inevitable and necessary part of inscribing or working in landscapes. Ecosystems, farms, wilderness or wastelands have to be created semiotically before they can be transformed materially. Stakeholders' stories about Hanford were inextricable from 'real' Hanford because one cannot be constituted without the other. People should be encouraged to find meaning in the landscape even if we, as scholars, attempt to situate them in the context of other stories, including our own. My purpose in juxtaposing and deconstructing narratives in this paper was to show how meaning was necessarily a part of imagining and planning future landscapes even if they were constructions, even when they contradicted one another, even if they did not conform to accepted historical evidence, even when one was more powerful than another, even when one was relegated to the margins of civil discourse.77 The danger was not that Hanford stakeholders derived meaning from amoral landscapes; it was from unequal access to the areas of civic discourse where people made formal or ad hoc plans to semiotically and materially reconstruct landscapes based on meanings. Which attributions and inscriptions on the Hanford landscape are diabolical and which are not? The EIS process conducted by the DOE was to be the ostensible arbiter of whose meaning and map - whose dream - would become the preferred alternative for the future Hanford landscape. The ongoing story of land use at Hanford The DOE conducted public meetings and solicited written comment as a part of the EIS process. Tom Ferns, the EIS manager, held meetings around the region in Portland, 57</page><page sequence="24">Doug Mercer Richland and Spokane, the de facto capital of the 'inland empire', as well as in Mattawa, Grant County, the home of Wahluke 2000 plan. Mattawa residents were acutely aware that they were fighting a battle they would probably lose. DOE Secretary Bill Richardson foreshadowed presidential intervention just days before the meeting in an announcement of his support for the preservation-oriented plan. Ferns told his Mattawa audience that he hoped to 'get some different opinions . . . Right now I can tell you I have about 150 letters supporting the [Natural Resources Trustee Alternative] from all over the state of Washington, from Oregon, too, and I have one letter supporting [local governments and Wahluke 2000].'78 Speakers in Mattawa fruitlessly reasserted their historical and moral claims for a just return of land to agricultural use. Said Matt Morton, Grant County Planner, 'The DOE has been charged with returning these excess lands, making best use out of them. At this point, from Grant County perspective, that would be returning it to some the original ownership . . . the constituents of Grant County.' Speakers appealed to the past, the future, and nature. 'Farming a portion of the Wahluke Slope is our future. And if you look at this area, you'll see what kind of agricultural economy we have. It is beautiful. We have lots of orchards, lots of vineyards, lots of high intensity crops. This ground (the Wahluke Slope) is not any different than what's out there,' said Mike Conley.79 Lois Thiede correctly said ' [the Wahluke Slope] is not pristine habitat. Much of it was formerly used for farming and grazing, and we want some of it available for similar purposes.'80 The special growth out there,' said Jim McCurdy, 'it's a pile of weeds. That's all it is, weeds. There is hardly any wildlife out there.'81 Commentators reminded Ferns that 'the Wahluke Slope contains land particularly well suited for irrigated agricultural production. We cannot allow these lands ... to be tied up in wildlife refuges. We need them for food production.'82 But the logic and meaning of agriculturists' future-history had been destabilized by complex events including the declining dependence of national and regional economies on agriculture, corporatization of agriculture, and the emergence of material and semiotic nature as something that deserved protection. The preservationists' story - featuring newly discovered species at Hanford, the necessity of enforcing legal mandates and agency missions, and the narrative of a vanishing ecosystem - found many allies in local and national environmental groups. Native American tribal groups also supported the Trustee's plan, despite two tribes having their own land-use plans in the EIS. The preservationist-Native American alliance was built on an overlapping semiotic understanding of nature that included a romantic image of Native Americans as part of nature, not its despoilers (that role is firmly secured by agriculturists and plutonium factories).83 For their part, tribal representatives believed that their ability to conduct traditional ceremonies, hunt and gather and have sweat lodges would be compromised by any residual contamination.84 Furthermore, tribes and local governments had great enmity towards each other. Tribal leaders recognized that they were unlikely to gain ownership or planning authority for Hanford, but they definitely didn't want local governments in control of land use.85 The future-history of agriculturists lost out to claims that the land should be preserved for the work of nature, and the contemplative labours of people. However, the DOE did not choose the preservationist-supported Natural Resources Thistee Plan either. They 58</page><page sequence="25">Future histories of Hanford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape chose their own plan. But their preferred alternative was quite preservationist in orientation, even more so than had been the HRA-EIS plan rejected by stakeholders in 1996. This new CLUP alternative would set aside approximately two-thirds of Hanford, including all of the Wahluke Slope, the ALE and the river corridor, as well as Gable Butte and Gable Mountain (two topographical features important to Indians), and would retain most of the central plateau for waste management and quarrying of materials. The story of future land use at Hanford was not quite over. There remained the political endgame between Senator Murray and Representative Hastings. Local governments still thought they might trump the DOE's land-use plan by congressional fÃ¬at. Though neither Murray's nor Hastings' proposal of 1996 made it to the President's desk, local planners and political representatives had begun their own planning effort based on the Hastings local-control concept, hoping that Congress would eventually grant them authority to manage land use along the Columbia River and Hanford's buffer lands. Their hopes were dashed in May when Murray persuaded President Clinton to designate as a National Monument the Hanford Reach, along with all of the Wahluke Slope and the ALE. Hastings was incensed. In a Tri-Cities herald editorial the next day, he used language echoing Wahluke 2000's public comment. 'These lands were taken from local residents prior to WWII and the federal government promised to return the lands when the mission at Hanford was over ... It seems the only way we can trust the promises [the administration] makes is by turning a blind eye to the promises they break.'86 Murray's editorial in a later issue of the same paper resonated with Gordon Todd and preservationists. As a child, I always treasured my family's trips to Kennewick. My grandfather had settled in the area in 1916 ... I remember watching the hydros and swimming in the river with my six brothers and sisters.' She asserted the need to protect dwindling salmon runs and the Hanford Reach. 'Now it's time to extend protection to the Hanford Reach, so generations of Americans can enjoy its natural beauty, understand American Indian history, and learn about the area's historical significance.' With the felicitous air of a victor, Murray wrote, 'There is no place for partisan politics in protecting the Reach. If you have floated the Reach, you have seen the scars left on it by human activity. And doing the right thing means keeping your promises.'87 The preservationists had won again, at least for the time being. Communitarian conclusions Landscapes are the ephemeral products of the collective labours of people with nature. Hanford's landscape was certainly a product of human work, but human work cannot precede ideas people had for it, nor can it be separated a priori from the landscape itself. People always have purposes, make plans, and constitute meaning as a necessary condition of labouring in landscapes. As Donna Haraway put it, nature cannot pre-exist its construction.88 This is not an idealist position that denies the physical world, as Braun and Castree correctly observed, but rather an assertion of the necessarily political character of understanding, acting in and with the world.89 Certainly political actors deployed simplified histories, past-perfects as I called them, but that does not make them wrong or even necessarily diabolical. I have argued that drawing meaning from landscapes 59</page><page sequence="26">Doug Mercer should be valorized rather than vilified, even if it is a purposeful exercise of power. A separate question is how to sort the diabolical from mere deployments of stories about landscapes. Neil Smith has hesitantly suggested that nature might be re-enchanted with some kind of pragmatic social scientific appreciation for the experience of being in nature (which of course we never, ever left) and becoming transformed by it. Smith warns that the project 'is as dangerous as it is inevitable. Any thought of romancing nature or re- enchanting nature has first to unearth itself from the ideological mucus with which such ideas and concepts come to us.'90 He could be thinking of wilderness idolization, the sagebrush rebellion's assertions of western independence, or the transcendental organicism behind the Gaia hypothesis. The project is likely to remain dangerous because, as scholars from diverse disciplines have noted, there is no single position from which one might distinguish between romancing stones and a practical appreciation for stones ... or landscapes.91 Agriculturists, preservationists and the DOE (as well as other stakeholders not discussed here) believed their future-histories were eminently reasonable.92 Who has the perspective to arbitrate between romantic and practical, or diabolical and just uses of future-histories? In my view, the answer is no one and everyone. Past-perfects and the landscapes they represent must come into contact with each other to the fullest extent possible, both inside and outside formal deliberative arrangements like public meetings, in the necessary and inevitable production of new future-histories. As Cronon has argued, we speak as members of communities. To the extent that those communities are open and even contentious (especially when they are contentious), stories will be disciplined by the work of nature and the diverse semiotic products of human minds. The communitarian approach to stories liberates geographers to write positioned, reasonable, radical, even ridiculous geographies of landscapes, with the goal always to communicate rather than condemn, invite rather than exclude the alternative stories.93 A just landscape is not a land use designation, it is a process of deliberation and engagement with the world. Braun and Castree wrote that 'nature is multiple; its social production proceeds according to no single temporality, occurs with no one underlying logic, follows no unified plan. Accordingly, struggles over the social production of nature are multifaceted; they occur at various levels, involve a large cast of actors (not all of which are human), and follow a plurality of social and ecological logics that cannot be reduced to a single story.'94 It would behove geographers writing in the landscape tradition to make room in their stories for the unexpected. Those who remain wedded tÃ³ texts alone, or exclusively to an ontology of labouring human hands, will not be taken seriously in the practical politics of land use at Hanford. One needs to take seriously at Hanford the works of nature and all manner of storytellers, from preservationists to agriculturists, planners and scientists, to senators, even if they are romantic future-histories. Making landscapes is as much about dreaming as it is about moving dirt. 60</page><page sequence="27">Future histories of Hartford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape Acknowledgements This paper would be incoherent without the tough-minded material and semiotic labours of Richard White, Katharyne Mitchell, William Beyers, Richard Morrill, Don Mitchell, Tom Leschine and anonymous reviewers.

Thirteen thousand bombs of the type and size used on Nagasaki could be made from plutonium made at Hanford. The storage and disposal of this material is a story itself. 5 See J. Findlay and B.

Perhaps the best overview is Gerber's, On the home front. 10 There are 149 single-shell tanks, most with capacities of over half a million gallons. The 28 double-shell tanks hold a million or more gallons per tank. Two-thirds of the nation's high-level nuclear waste is contained in the tanks. The DOE believes that 67 of the tanks leak and have released 600-900 000 gallons into the environment. See DOE, Environmental impact statement 61</page><page sequence="28">Doug Mercer for the tank waste remediation system (Richland, WA, DOE, 1996). The tanks are often in the news. The headlines of Seattle newspapers for one week in 1999 were that the materials in tank SY-101 have expanded beyond the capacity of the tank and could lead to a rupture, putting at risk the nearby city of Richland.

See PNNL, Hanford site: 1997 environmental report (Richland, WA, PNNL, DOE, 1997). 13 The 1999 EM budget for Hanford was $995 million of the $1.566 billion, and their 2000 budget is to be $1.065 billion. 14 DOE, Baseline environmental management report (Washington, DC, DOE/EM, 1996). 15 For a more complete discussion of landscape scholarship see D. Mitchell, Cultural geography: a critical introduction (Maiden, MA, Blackwell, 1999). 16 C. Sauer, 'The morphology of landscape', in J. Leighly, ed., Land and life: a selection from the writing of Carl Sauer (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1963). His formulation of landscapes influenced decades of landscape interpreters. The collection edited by Meinig is emblematic of this tradition: D. Meinig, 'The beholding eye', in Meinig, ed., Interpretation of ordinary landscapes (New York, Oxford University Press, 1979). 17 S. Daniels and D. Cosgrove, eds, The iconography of landscape: essays and the symbolic representation, design and use of past environments (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1988). 18 J. Duncan, City as text: the politics of landscape interpretation in the Kandyan Kingdom (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. 17. See D. Cosgrove, The Palladian landscape: geographical change and its cultural representations in sixteenth century Italy (Leicester, Leicester University Press, 1992), in which Cosgrove used theatre as a metaphor for interpreting landscape change. 19 This was not entirely new. For example, Donald Meinig, a descriptive historical geographer of the first order, had made similar arguments in Interpretation of ordinary landscapes. 20 Planning scholars have employed similar approaches and deserve mention here, as I am investigating a planning effort. See e.g. J. A. Throgmorton, 'Planning as a rhetorical activity', foumal of the American Planning Association 59 (1993), pp. 33 4-46. Also S. Mandlebaum, 'Reading plans', Journal of the American Planning Association 56 (1990), pp. 350-58. 21 D. Mitchell, The lie of the land: migrant workers and the California landscape (Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1996). 22 Notably S. Zukin, Landscapes of power: from Detroit to Disney World (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1991). Neil Smith and David Harvey are among the noteworthy scholars who take a Marxist and materialist stance on the production of nature in geography. Working in a humanistic tradition, Kenneth Olwig similarly argues for a more materialist conceptualization of landscape: see 'Recovering the substantive nature of landscape', Annals of the Association of American Geographers 86 (1996), pp. 630-53. In that essay he also argues that Sauer recanted much of his earlier bifurcation of nature and culture upon which 'Morphology of landscape' was premised. 23 Mitchell, 'Lie of the land', p. 30. 24 In 'Lie of the land' Mitchell used Latour's concept of boundary objects for his landscape definition. Latour argues that objects are only defined as ontologically distinct entities from the network of things and people through 'trials of strength'. People and things negotiate what constitutes an object of study. Geographers interested in geographical information systems (GIS) 62</page><page sequence="29">Future histories of Hanford: the material and semiotic production of a landscape and science studies have done excellent work on boundary objects. See F. Harvey and N. Chrisman, 'Boundary objects and the social construction of GIS technology', Environment and planning A 30 (1998), pp. 1683-94. 25 Indeed, a number of geographers are pursuing this kind of ontology. In addition to the work of Harvey and Chrisman see N. Bingham, 'Object-ions: from technological determinism towards geographies of relations', Environment and planning D: Society and space 14 (1996), p. 645. The most recent expression of interest is B. Braun and N. Castree, eds, Remaking reality: nature at the millennium (London, Routledge, 1998). All the contributors attempt to negotiate an epistemology for representation and reality, many of them turning to the science studies scholar Bruno Latour (including Latour himself, who also has an essay in the volume). The most directed and programmatic book of his work is We have never been modern (Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1993). In some ways the most relevant to this paper is the strange hybrid book by Latour, Aramis or the love of technology (Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1996), the story of a failed mass transportation system in which Latour creates anthropomorphic voices for the non-human actors and presents them alongside quotations from interviews with politicians, planners and engineers. He welds these together using a fictional relationship between a graduate student and an adviser. Feminist science studies scholar Donna Haraway uses the metaphor of the cyborg, a creature made of both machine and organism, to argue for such a material-semiotic approach to nature: Simians, cyborgs, and women: the reinvention of nature (New York, Routledge, 1991). 26 R.

Following a strikingly similar logic, Native American scholar Kimbely Blaeser argued that the issue of control over places is as much about 'ideological possession, because to a large degree the two have gone hand in hand:' 'the new "frontier" of Native American literature: dis-arming history with tribal humor', in A.R.

See G. Lindeman, 'Golden harvest: wheat farming on the Columbia plateau', Colutiibia 6 (1992). 42 President Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the Grand Coulee construction site on 2 Oct. 1937, quoted in an undated brochure on the dam's construction: Bureau of Reclamation, The Grand Coulee Dam and the Columbia Basin Project (Washington, DC, US Printing Office 6-9781), p. 2. 43 For a history of the Grand Coulee as an ascendant narrative that develops this theme, see R Pitzner, Grand Coulee: harnessing a dream (Pullman, Washington State University Press, 1994). 44 President Franklin D. Roosevelt, quoted in Bureau of Reclamation, Grand Coulee. 45 In the interest of enlisting people, the CBP distribute numerous promotional pamphlets, e.g. Bureau of Reclamation, Farming opportunities: Columbia Basin Project (Bureau of Reclamation, Ephrata, WA); and Columbia Basin Project relative land productivity and income (Agricultural Experiment Stations, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, State College of Washington in cooperation with US Bureau of Reclamation, Bulletin 570, Oct. 1956). 46 See Washington Agricultural Experimental Station [WAES] , Economic problems and progress of Columbia Basin Project settlers (Pullman, WA, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, 1959). 47 Scholars have used the development of federally funded water projects to erode the illusion that the West was won by the heroism of men and by their individual labours.

The treaties are reprinted in full in DOE, CLUP. 57 The Columbia Basin has experienced wave after wave of colonization. Anglo ranchers displaced Indians, farmers displaced ranchers, Hanford displaced some areas of agriculture. The waves of colonization produce successive economic and social injustices. Wahluke 2000 supporters also have defensible claims of economic injustice. Despite extensive irrigation of Grant County land from the CBP, it has grown poor relative to Benton and Franklin counties, who benefit from direct and indirect economic effects from Hanford operations. Grant County, too far from Hanford for residential and business development, receives none. Residents of Grant County seek privatization of the land to augment county tax roles to make up for this inequity. Grant County receives Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) money based on the assessed value of the land. Grant County's counter-claim is that the PILOT money should be based on lost revenue as well as land value.

The DOE maintains a database of all site visitors and their accumulated dose as measured by the tags. 71 Geographer Roger Kasperson wrote nearly two decades ago about the unequal standards applied to workers and the public: 'Responding to the double standard of worker/public protection', Environment 25 (1983), pp. 6-11. Agencies generally permit higher exposure for workers than for the public. The logic is that workers are generally more knowledgeable and can make informed decisions about the risks, and are compensated for those risks. 72 Environmental historians have hotly debated the issue of the agency of nature. For a fascinating dialogue on the matter, see Journal of American history 76 (1990), in which many of the seminal environmental historians - including Donald Worster, David Pyle, Carolyn Merchant, Richard White, William Cronon and Alfred Crosby - debate their differences over the agency of nature. Perspectives range from a strong Marxist base (nature) superstructure (culture) of Worster to the more post-structural (but always grounded) position of White. 73 Among the prominent geographers making this argument are Cosgrove and Daniels, Iconography of landscape, Duncan, City as text , and Mitchell, The lie of the land. 74 K. Olwig, 'Reinventing common nature: Yosemite and Mount Rushmore - a meandering tale of a double nature', in Cronon, ed., Uncommon ground , pp. 379-408. 75 I borrow the term 'doxa' from Pierre Bourdieu. 'Doxa' (from 'orthodox') refers to those social norms which have become the assumptions on which individuals predicate their actions. They are the unexamined, implicit rules of behaviour. For a discussion of the role of doxa in Bourdieu's theory, see D. Swartz, The sociology of Pierre Bourdieu (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1997). The manner in which I use 'permanence' was developed in D. Harvey, Justice , nature and the geography of difference (Maiden, MA, Blackwell, 1996). Harvey's use of the term was to justify relatively enduring (if nonetheless constructed) place-based identities that can be tied to socialist strategies. 76 Olwig often uses an etymological methodology to convey the complex cultural baggage of commonly used terms such as 'landscape' and 'nature'. In this sense his approach is consistent with the conflictual understanding of meaning and its problematic relationship to landscapes adopted here. Olwig cautions that environmental history's materialist and conservationist impulses tend to conceptually divide society from nature: 'Environmental history and the construction of nature and landscape: the case of the "landscaping" of the Juntland heath', Environment and history 2 (199 6), pp. 15-38. In a similar vein, see Olwig, 'Recovering substantive nature'. 77 There is an industry of work deconstructing narratives, maps and plans. See e.g. T. Barnes and J. Duncan, eds, Writing worlds: discourse, text and metaphor in the representation of landscapes (London, Routledge, 1992). The social-historical contextualization of maps found in D. Cosgrove, ed., Mappings (London, Reaktion, 1999) also contributes to the literature. The work commonly seeks to reveal covert or diabolical uses of social power. 78 DOE, CLUP , public comment, p. 776. 79 Ibid ., p. 788. 80 Ibid., p. 809. 81 Ibid., p. 796. 82 Ibid., p. 845. 83 Pulido has defended ethnic groups who have communally managed resources.

Indians predicated their maps and stories on assertions about living harmoniously with the land in the years before Europeans colonized the area. Their future-history would return the land to tribal subsistence uses. DOE's future-history was that they had control over the landscape since the 1940s, and that that history of control could be traced into the future. 93 Native American trickster stories may be a model for environmental planning and discourse. Tricksters are material-semiotic articulations of nature and society ubiquitous in pre-industrial oral traditions. See J. Vizenor, ed., Narrative chance: postmodern discourse on native American Indian literatures (Albuquerque, University of New Mexico Press, 1989).
