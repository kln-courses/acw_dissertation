Bd., S. io-. 107), Mr. James Mooney has an article, "The Origin of the Plei- ades: an Arapaho Myth." The Arapaho, like the Cherokees and the Kiowa, reckon the Pleiades as originally seven in number. Their name for the group is Banikuth, "The Sitting Group." They are considered to be six brothers and a sister, who were carried up by the growth of a tree which they had climbed until they reached the skies. At the end of the myth is the tag: "People must not tell these stories in the daytime, or they will go blind." Micmac. In the "American Anthropologist" (vol. viii. pp. 31-42), Mr. S. Hager has an article on "Micmac Customs and Traditions." Descriptions of the dice-game of wltsh5mkw6n, of the ckoogickoo yajik, or serpent-dance of the water-fairies, and of the culloo-bird, are given. Under the title "Fra i Micmac" ("Among the Micmacs ")' Profes- sor Mantegazza contributes to the "Archivio per 1' Antropologia," Florence (vol. xxiv. pp. 313-325), a lengthy recension of Dr. Rand's volume reviewed in the Journal of American Folk-Lore (vol. vii. p. 163). Onomatology. Mr. W. W. Tooker has, during the year, published several of his acute and discriminating analyses of Algonkian folk and land names : " Some Indian Fishing-stations upon Long Island (" Brooklyn Daily Eagle Almanac," 1895, pp. 54-57), a paper read before the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in August, 1894, in which more than two dozen Indian names are carefully interpreted; "The Name Chickahominy, its Origin and Etymology" (" American Anthropologist," vol. viii. pp. 2 57-263). In the same volume (p. 91) Dr. A. S. Gatschet discusses the ety- mology of "Tecumseh's Name," which he derives from Shawnee ni/a ni tkamdtkka, "I cross the path, or way (of an animate being)." The name "belongs to a totem of one of the round-footed animals, as that of the raccoon, jaguar, panther, or wild-cat, and not to the hoofed ones, as the deer." This accounts for several of the free translations or paraphrases of his name. In the "American Anti- quarian" for January, 1895, Mr. Tooker has a paper on "The Dis- covery of Chaunis Temoatan in I 86," which clears up a most diffi- cult problem in Algonkian ethnography. CALIFORNIA. - In "Anthropologie," the Parisian anthropological journal, M. L. Diguet has a "Note sur Ia pictographie de la Basse- Californie" (vol. vi. pp. 160-175).</page><page sequence="2">318 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. CHINOOK. - The publication of the year is Dr. F. Boas' "Chinook Texts" (Washington, Government Printing Office, 278 pp., 80). This volume, which is embellished with a portrait of Charles Cultee, from whom the texts were obtained, covers a wide field of folk-lore: Ani- mal myths (in which the Salmon, Raven, Gull, Coyote, Crane, Crow, Skunk, Robin, Blue-jay, Panther, etc., figure); Tales, Customs, and Beliefs about the Soul, Guardian Spirits, Pregnancy, Birth, Puberty, Marriage, Death, Hunting, Whaling, Potlatch, War, etc.; Histori- cal Tales. The Texts are recorded in phonetic transcription, with interlinear translation followed by a good rendering into ordinary English. CHOCTAW. - To the "American Antiquarian" (vol. xvii. p. 157) Mr. H. S. Halbert contributes a note on "The Choctaw Robin Good- fellow" - Bohpoli (" the thrower ") or Kowi anukas/za (" the forest- dweller "). HAIDAH. - "The Hidery Story of Creation," by James Deans (" American Antiquarian," vol. xvii. pp. 6 1-67), is an interesting and valuable contribution to the literature of the mythology of the north- west coast. Creation, the obtaining of fresh water, the flood, are the chief topics treated. The Hidery seem to have been good evo- lutionists, and to have anticipated both the Greeks and Darwin, to judge by Mr. Deans' outline of their theory of human develop- ment. Another interesting essay by Mr. Deans finds place in the same volume (pp. 208-213)' - "A Little-Known Civilization," in which the author treats of the sociology and mythology of the Hai- dahs. KOOTENAY. - In the "American Antiquarian" (vol. xvii. pp. 68- 72), Dr. A. F. Chamberlain writes of the "Mythology and Folk- Lore" of the Kootenay Indians of British Columbia, treating cos- mogony, origin of sun and moon, clouds, men, animals. In the beast-tales the Coyote is the chief figure. The thunder-bird, the arrow-chain to the sky, and the origin of insects from the ashes of a witch, are noteworthy incidents in Kootenay mythology. NAVAHO. - In the "American Anthropologist" (vol. viii. pp. 223- 240), Mr. F. H. Hodge has an interesting paper on "The early Na- vajo and Apache," and to the same number (pp. 287-294), Capt. J. G. Bourke contributes some critical remarks on Mr. Hodge's paper, to which the author briefly replies (pp. 294, 295). NORTHWEST COAST TRIBES. - Throughout the year Dr. F. Boas</page><page sequence="3">Record of American Folk-Lore. 319 has continued, in the "Verhandlungen der Berliner Gesellschaft fur Anthropologie" (Jahrg. xxvi-xxvii. 1894-1895), his studies of the folk- tales of the Indians of the northwest coast, under the title, "Sagen der Indianer an der Nordwest-Kiiste Amerikas." The author's con- tributions continue still the most valuable, accurate, and extensive collection of myths from this region yet published. Another myth from the northwest coast is given by Mr. G. C. Teal (" American Antiquarian," vol. xvii. pp. 203-204), "The Soil which made the Earth." This is the diving episode so familiar to students of Algonkian mythology. Here the loon is the successful diver, and is rewarded with the friendship of the man. When the latter died, "the loon went off alone, and to this day has not ceased to mourn for him." The Tenth Report (B. A. A. S., Ipswich, 1895) on the Northwest- ern Tribes of Canada (pp. 71, 80) consists of Dr. Boas' "Fifth Report on the Indians of British Columbia." Though mostly concerned with physical anthropology and linguistics, the report contains socio- logical and folk-lore notes, accounts of ceremonials, songs, etc., of the Ts'Ets'.'ut (a Tinneh tribe on Portland Inlet) and the NiskA, who speak a dialect of Tsimshian. Very interesting is the creation legend of the Ts'Ets'a'ut given at page 48. PUEBLOS. - Tusayan. In the "American Anthropologist" (vol. viii. pp. 118-141), Dr. J. W. Fewkes makes a detailed "Comparison of Sia [Keresan] and Tusayan Snake Ceremonials." The author dis- cusses the influence of Christian belief on the religious life of the Pueblos Indians: "Christianity has exerted a great influence on most of the eastern Pueblos, and this belief has profoundly modified the religious life of the majority of the people," - earth-gods, sky-gods, world-quarter-gods, animals, supernatural beings, the tiponi altar, ceremonies at the altar, invocation to the rain-gods of the six world- quarters, ceremonies with living snakes. One of the conclusions at which Dr. Fewkes arrives is, that "the original Tusayan cult has kinship with that of the Keresan [to which Sia is said' to belong], the oldest of the linguistic stocks of the Pueblos." In the "Proceedings of the Boston Natural History Society" (vol. xxvi. pp. 422-45 8), Dr. Fewkes has a valuable paper on "The Tusayan New Fire Ceremony." The essay has been reprinted in pamphlet form (37 pp., 80). Walpi. Captain J. G. Bourke, in the "American Anthropologist" (vol. viii. pp. 192-196), publishes some notes on "The Snake Cere- monials at Walpi," in reference to Dr. J. W. Fewkes' study of the Snake Dance of the Moquis.</page><page sequence="4">320 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. To the "American Antiquarian" (vol. xvii. pp. 205-207) Mr. R. H. Baxter contributes an account (written in 1893) of the "Moqui Snake Dance." The "American Antiquarian" (vol. xvii. p. i6o) has a note on "Prints of the Human Hand in the Ruins of the Cliff-dwellings." The fashion of making the impressions is as follows : "The left hand would be held flat against the surface of the wall, and the paint spattered on between the fingers and around the outside by the other hand. Thus, when the left hand was removed, the outline would be left upon the wall in more or less perfection.'' In the "Amerian Anthropologist" (vol. viii. pp. 142-I 52), Mr. F. W. Hodge writes of "the first discovered city of Cibola," award- ing that distinction to the village of Hawikuh. SALISHAN. - In the "Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society" (vol. xxxiv. pp. 31-48), Dr. Boas publishes some "Salishan Texts." YUMA. - In the "American Anthropologist" (vol. viii. 264-267) Mr. G. R. Putnam describes "A Yuma Cremation" as witnessed by him in March, 1892. GENERAL. - In his article on "Anthropomorphic Divinities," in the "American Antiquarian" (vol. xvii. pp. 79-100), Rev. S. D. Peet takes a general survey of anthropomorphism in the mytholo- gies and religions of the North American Indians, giving special attention to the Navajos. Another extended study of Dr. Peet, "The Story of the Creation among the American Aborigines a Proof of Prehistoric Contact" (" American Antiquarian," vol. xvii. pp. 127-I 50), contains a mass of useful information gathered from many sources. In "Am Ur-Quell" (VI. Bd., 5. 82-84), Dr. A. F. Chamberlain continues his studies of "Nature and Natural Phenomena in the Myths and Folk-Lore of the American Indians," treating of the "Milky Way." In "Sphinx" (the organ of the German Theosophical Society) Dr. L. Kuhlenbeck, of Jena, treats of "Das Damonische der In- dianer" (vol. xx. s. 295-300), and in the same volume is an article by the same author on "Die 'Medizin' des nordamerikanischen Indianers" (vol. xx. 5. 380-386). Schoolcraft is the chief source of information. Dr. Kuhlenbeck contributes to vol. xxi. the following articles also: "Das Schamanentum des nordamerikanischen In- dianers. Eine Ethnologische Studie" (vol. xxi. 5. 35-40), - Krause on the Thlinkits is here utilized; "Das Modus Operandi des</page><page sequence="5">Record of American Folk-Lore. 321 indianischen Medizinmanns" (s. 144-145); "Catherine Ogee Wyan Akweet Okwa, die Prophetin von Chegoimegon" (s. 146-151); here again Schoolcraft is utilized. The last article tells the story of the noted "medicine-woman" of the Odjibwas of Lake Superior. MExIco AND CENTRAL AMERICA. - The most important publica- tion of the year is Dr. D. G. Brinton's "Primer of Mayan Hiero- glyphics" (Boston, 1895, 3-152 pp., 80), in which are summarized the investigations of American and foreign scholars, and which contains, besides, many of the bright thoughts and original interpretations of the author, whose contributions to the subject are so many and so valuable. P. J. J. Valentini publishes an "Analysis of the Pictorial Text inscribed on Two Palenque Tablets" (Worcest'er, Mass., 24 pp., 80), being a reprint from Proc. Amer. Antiq. Soc., October, 1895. To the "American Anthropologist" (vol. viii. pp. 205-222) Dr. J. W. Fewkes contributes a plentifully illustrated article on "The God 'D' in the Codex Cortesianus." Prof. Cyrus Thomas' paper, "Prehistoric Contact of Americans with Oceanic Peoples," in the "American Antiquarian" (vol. xvii. pp. ioi-i i i), trenches upon very doubtful ground of myth-compari- son and word-equation. It must be confessed that no connection between Mayan and East Indian languages, culture, or mythology has yet been made out satisfactorily. The third paper of Professor Thomas (vol. xvii. pp. 191-203) does not strengthen his position. Another path somewhat dangerous to tread is entered upon by R. G. Haliburton in his essay on the "Survival of Dwarf Races in the New World" (Proc. Am. Ass. Adv. Sci. vol. xliii. pp. 337-344). SOUTH AMERICA. - During the year several articles upon Peru of interest to the folk-lorist have appeared. Anong these are the fol- lowing: "The Huacos of Chira Valley, Peru" (" American Anthro- pologist," vol. viii. pp. 8-2 2), by S. S. Scott, who, besides describing the grave-technique of the old Peruvians, notes the fact that "At Cata- caos, near Piura (the old San Miguel de Piura, the first permanent city founded by the Christians in Peru), there exists to-day a very curi- ous community of Indians, whose manners and customs differ greatly from those of their Cholo neighbors;" "Primitive Trephining in Peru," by J. H. McCormick, in the "Journal of Practical Medicine," New York (vol. x. pp. 437-442); "The Character and Antiquity of Peruvian Civilization" (reprinted from "Denison Quarterly," Gran- ville, 0., io pp., 80). Dr. Jacopo Danielli, in the "Archivio per I' Antropologia e la Etnologia" (vol. xxiv. pp. 105-I i5), publishes a "Contributo allo</page><page sequence="6">322 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. Studio del Tatuaggio negli antichi Peruviani." The study is based on the collection of mummies preserved in the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, and elsewhere, and is accompanied by four plates containing forty-three figures of various tattoo marks. The "American Antiquarian" (vol. xvii. pp. 167-170) contains an article (a translation from the Spanish of Acosta) on "The Cal- endar System of the Chibchas." In the "List of the Tribes in the Valley of the Amazon," by Clements R. Markham (" Journal of the Anthropological Institute," London, voL xxiv. pp. 236-284), are included some items of folk-lore and onomatology. To the "Viaggi d' un artista nell' America meridionale. I Cadu- vei (MbayX o Guaycudi)," Rome, 1895, 339 pp., Dr. C. A. Colini contributes an interesting historico-ethnographic preface, while the author himself, Guido Boggiano, a painter, gives his impressions de voyage among these primitive people.
