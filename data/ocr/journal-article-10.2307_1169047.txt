<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER VII An Elementary Survey of Statistical Decision Theory MEYER A. GIRSHICK STATISTICAL decision theory was originated some 15 years ago by Abra- ham Wald. In the past decade, great strides have been made in this field by Wald and others. However, so far these developments have had but little impact on experimental research in the social and physical sciences. There appear to be two basic reasons for this: one is the natural lag between theory and practice which so often occurs in science; the other, which in the present case may be more fundamental, is that decision theory to date has been too much concerned with the mathematical foun- dations of the subject and less with its immediate application. Curiously enough, here is a situation in which the foundational development, difficult as it is, is easier than the application to actual problems. What is decision theory? In its broadest sense, decision theory deals with the problem of decision making in the face of uncertainty. But since life is beset with all kinds of uncertainties, this definition is all-embracing and consequently nonilluminating. The truth of the matter is that the methods of decision theory are all-embracing, and could be said to en- compass the whole science of inductive reasoning. But being statisticians and not philosophers, we attempt to narrow down the field. This narrowing down consists mainly in a specification of the kind of uncertainty with which we are dealing and an insistence that the decisions to be made must be based on observations obtained from an experiment. The notions of decision theory may be introduced with an illustra- tion which, tho mathematically simple, exhibits all essential features. A few years ago Professor Merrill Flood, then at the RAND Corporation and presently at Columbia University, requested assistance in solving a prob- lem which he and his group encountered in their experimental work with learning models. For our purpose it is not essential to know the exact nature of the experiment except that it dealt with the question of how a person utilizes available information to make decisions. The problem, which is an abstraction of the real situation, can be presented in the form of the now famous "two-armed bandit" problem. In this formu- lation, we are given a slot machine with two arms, a right and left arm. The probability of paying off is different for each arm, one having a probability co of paying off, and the other a probability 0, with co greater than 0. When either arm pays off, the amount is a monetary units. The subject is told the values of o and 0, but he is not told which arm is associated with which probability. The subject is allowed to pull either arm at any time for a total of N pulls. The problem is to study how, at 448</page><page sequence="2">December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION each stage, the subject utilizes the information thus far obtained to de- cide which arm to pull next so as to maximize his total take. As often happens in social science research, the formulation of an ex- perimental situation is immensely easier than the interpretation of the collected data. In this particular situation, the experimenters quickly realized that it would be impossible to analyze the behavior of the subject in any meaningful way since how to classify behavior in a situation of this sort or what constitutes an optimal mode of behavior for the subject was not known. It may be of interest to note that, after almost two years of battling with the "two-armed bandit" by a number of people, it still remains essentially unsolved, except for some special cases. One such special case I shall consider here in detail. It is the case in which the sum of co and 0 is unity, but their values are not announced to the subject. In addition, for the sake of somewhat greater generality, we assume that the payoff of the right arm is a and of the left arm is b, with a not necessarily equal to b. It is easily shown that this special case is equiv- alent to a simpler situation, namely, that of a coin-tossing experiment. The experiment can be reformulated in the following manner. The ex- perimenter selects a biased coin, the bias being subject to his choice. That is, he selects a coin that has a probability o of falling "head" and hence a probability 0=1-co of falling "tail," where co is any number between zero and one, and is at the control of the experimenter.1 The same coin is tossed N times where N is some integer, say 100, and is part of the design of the experiment. Prior to each toss, the subject has to bet on its outcome, and as an inducement to the subject, we assume: if he bets "head" and "head" appears, he receives a monetary units; if he bets "tail," and "head" appears, he receives nothing. Similarly, if he bets "tail" and "tail" appears, he receives b monetary units; but if he bets "tail" and "head" appears, he again receives nothing. For the sake of concreteness, we shall take a = 100, b = 150. The payoff to the sub- ject for each bet is summarized in Table 1.

S. Mint will not be discussed here. It suffices to say that even more complicated experiments are being performed on electronic machines by employing random numbers. How to utilize these numbers most economically is itself an interesting decision problem which has been solved. 449 December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5 We shall now exhibit the essential elements of this experiment. As we shall see later, these elements are basic to every statistical decision problem: (a) After the first toss, the subject can base his decisions on in- formation supplied by the outcomes of the previous tosses. (b) The in- formation will come to the subject thru a random mechanism, namely, the tossing of a coin. (c) The outcome of the toss depends in a probability sense on the bias in the coin. (d) The extent of the bias, here the value of o is completely at the control of the experimenter and is unknown to the subject. (e) The payoff provides the subject's inducement to do well, and he will presumably wish to maximize the total income for the N bets. The experimenter would clearly be interested in the decision procedure employed by the subject. Note that what we are after is not what bets the subject makes, because this can be easily noted, but rather the deci- sion procedure which he employs. More technically, what we are after is the strategy of the subject. From the outset, it is imperative that we un- derstand the notion of a strategy. When the layman says that he has a strategy, he usually implies that he has what he thinks is a good way of behaving in a given situation. This is not what is meant by the word strategy in the technical sense. The word is to be taken in an absolutely neutral sense. It carries with it no value judgment. A strategy simply is a prescribed mode of behavior, be it good, bad, or indifferent. It is a complete description of what a person is going to do under every possible eventuality with which he might be confronted in the situation under consideration. Improvising on the spur of the moment does not constitute a strategy. This type of behavior cannot be evaluated or its consequences predicted. On the other hand, a strategy considered as a rule of behavior can be evaluated since it prescribes not only what one is going to do at this instant, but also what one's behavior will be at all times whenever he is confronted with situations of this sort, even tho the eventualities in the situations may differ. All too frequently research workers have confused the decision which they make after an experiment has been performed, with a strategy for deci- sion making in experiments of the type contemplated. A decision based on the information supplied by an experiment must be an outgrowth of a rule previously determined, and it is the consequences of the rule and not the particular decision that lends itself to statistical evaluation. An objection usually raised is that in many situations it is humanly impossible to formulate a strategy in all its detail. For example, it would probably take endless volumes to describe a reasonable strategy for the game of chess. Altho this is true, it should be pointed out that (a) the notion of a strategy is still tremendously fruitful and often makes it possible to prove theorems about games like chess even tho we cannot write down the instructions which would constitute a strategy, and (b) in many situations in statistics it has been found possible to characterize not only a single strategy but whole classes of strategies which have 450 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5</page><page sequence="4">December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION optimal properties. The concept of a strategy will become clearer as we progress with this discussion. Let us return to the coin-tossing experiment. In order to understand what is meant for the subject to have a strategy in this experiment, we must visualize the possibility of the subject not being present at the experi- ment. Instead he sends a proxy who cannot make any decisions of his own volition and must follow the instructions of the subject to the letter. In order for the proxy to function in this experiment, the subject has to specify in detail how he is to behave in every possible situation, that is, what he is to do initially before the first toss of the coin, and thereafter how he is to bet for every possible outcome of the previous tosses. As an illustration, consider the case in which the experimenter will toss the coin only three times. A strategy for the subject must specify (always think of the instructions he gives to the proxy) what bet he will make on the first toss when he has no information, and what he will do on the second toss after he knows the outcome of the first toss. More specifically, if H represents head and T tail, the possible strategies available to the statistician are summarized in Table 2. Strategy 1 instructs the proxy to bet "head" on the second toss no matter what he sees on the first toss.

H H T T T ............................................ H T H T Strategy 2 instructs the proxy to bet on the second toss whatever he sees on the first toss. Strategy 3 tells the proxy to reverse the situation. Strategy 4 tells him to bet "tail" no matter what he sees. After two tosses, the strategies available for the third toss are 16 in number and are summarized in Table 3. Consider, for example, strategy TABLE 3.-POSSIBLE BETTING STRATEGIES ON THIRD TOSS OF A COIN Strategy on third toss Outcome of first two tosses 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 H H..............H H H H T H H H T T T H T T T T H T..............H H H T H H T T H H T T H T T T T H..............HH T H H T H T H T H T T H T T T T..............

This strategy says: bet "head" unless the results of both tosses are tails. In strategy 7, to give a second example, the instruction is to ignore the first toss and to make the bet agree with the outcome of the second toss. In general, the number of strategies available to the subject after N N tosses is 22 which is a huge number for any sizable N. Moreover, a grand strategy for all N tosses would consist of a selection of an initial strategy and then one from each of a sequence of tables such as Tables 2 and 3. Even this huge number does not exhaust all the possibilities available to the subject. For example, suppose he contemplates the following strategy for betting on the third toss: He bets "head" if both previous tosses were heads; he bets "tail" if both previous tosses were tails, but if either HT or TH appears, he is hesitant to make a positive bet. To express this hesitancy in the form of a strategy, he might decide to carry along with him his own coin with bias subject to his own control (probably in favor of tail because of the higher payoff) which he will toss in this case and bet according to the outcome. He can clearly also accomplish the same objective by the following device: Prior to the experiment, he can toss the coin to decide whether in Table 3 he will employ strategy 2 or 12. Space does not permit going into any detailed discussion of these types of strategies which are known as randomized or mixed strategies, but it suffices to say they form an integral part of game theory and statistical decision theory, and we shall encounter them again in what follows. At first glance, the immense number of strategies available to the subject might appear highly discouraging. However, as we shall see later, most of these strategies are not worthy of consideration in rational behavior, and a major task of statistical decision theory is to discover methods for separating the wheat from the chaff. Before the winnowing can be under- taken, however, we must have a clear definition in mind of what is "wheat" and what is "chaff," or in more technical language, what con- stitutes an "admissible" and what constitutes an "inadmissible" strategy. Because a strategy is a rule of behavior and not a particular choice of an action at a given moment when such an action is called for, its evaluation is based not on the payoff at any specified time but rather on the expected payoff in the long run. From this point of view we can now examine several of the strategies enumerated above, and eventually formulate the notions of admissible and inadmissible classes of strategies, as well as the concept of "minimax" strategies which one encounters in game theory and decision theory. Let us begin with the examination of possible strategies for the first bet of the subject when he has no information about the behavior of the coin. The class of nonrandomized strategies available to him consists of the following two: S1-always bet "head"; So-always bet "tail." Assume now that the experimenter's coin has probability co of falling head. If we represent by I(S1co) the expected income from strategy S1 and by I(Solo) the expected income from strategy So, then since the subject 452 Vol. XXIV, No. 5 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH</page><page sequence="6">December 1954 SRE FSAITCLDCSO receives 100 monetary units if he bets "head" and head appears, and 150 monetary units if he bets "tail" and tail appears, but receives nothing otherwise, we have: l(S,lo) =100Xo+OX (1--o) 100 I(S2lw) =0Xo+150X (1-Co) =150(1-o) If we plot l(Sl(o) and I(Sloc) as functions of co, we get two straight lines intersecting at co=.6, as can be seen in Figure I. That is, when I(S1lo)=I(Solo), we have 100o=150(1--0) or 150 (o=---=.6. 2506 A randomized strategy Sr consists in the subject's selecting a coin with a known probability r of falling head, and always betting according to the outcome of a toss of this coin. Let I(Srl o) denote the expected income if strategy Sr is used. Then, since on any toss the subject's coin has probability r of falling head and his expected income in that case is I(Slco0), while his coin has probability (1 - r) of falling tail and his expected income is then I(SIoco), it follows that: I (Sr,]) =rI(SI,lo)+(1-r) I(Solo) =250rco-150r-150co+150. Clearly, for any r, I(Srlo)) is a straight line which passes thru the intersec- tion point of I(Sl Io) and I(Sol0o). This is true since when 0-=.6, I(Sllo) =I(Solco) =60 and I(Sr|co) =60 for all r. An example of such a line with r= .6 is given in Figure I. For values of o) between zero and .6, the subject will do best by playing strategy So rather than any other strategy, pure or randomized so that the maximum attainable expected income when co is less than .6 is given by I(Solco). For values of co greater than .6, the subject would do better by employing strategy Si than by employing any other strategy available to him. Thus, the maximum attainable expected income when (o is greater than .6 is given by I(S1co). The curve of the maximum attainable income is then given in Figure I by the two heavy line segments joining at 0)=.6. For any value of co, the ordinate of this curve represents the maximum amount the subject can get, on the average, if he knows the experimenter's choice of o. We call this curve the maximum attainable income curve on a single toss. (It will be remembered that the income curve for any strategy represents the expected payoff in the long run, that is, the average income the subject expects to receive if the strategy were used consistently in a long series of repetitions of the experiment.) Suppose the experimenter were to behave in the following manner: He wishes to select a value of co such that the most that the subject can attain, 453 December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5 on the average, even if the value of (o were known to him, is as small as possible. Clearly then, the experimenter would choose the value cw=.6. In his turn, the subject might examine possible expected incomes that he can get for various values of r at his disposal and come to the conclusion that with one exception, namely, r-.6, he runs the risk of getting less than 60 monetary units, on the average, for some choices of co by the experimenter.

I REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5</page><page sequence="8">December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION r=.6 for the subject are known in the language of game theory as minimax strategies. Roughly speaking, minimax strategies in a game have the prop- erty that to one of the players, the strategy guarantees that his expected income will be at least a certain amount regardless of the second player's strategy and to the second player it guarantees that his expected loss will be at most a certain amount whatever be the strategy of his opponent. Thus, in a certain sense, minimax strategies are safe strategies, and one would be tempted to use them in a situation where the opponent is assumed to be rational and is motivated by a desire to obtain the maximum from the contest. No method can be given here for determining minimax strategies in the general case. However, there is available a simple criterion for testing whether a given strategy is minimax. The criterion is this: A minimax strategy for the first player, say, is such that (a) it guarantees him an ex- pected income of at least a certain amount no matter what the second player does; and (b) the second player can be shown to possess a strategy which will make it possible, on the average, for him to hold the first player to this amount. How does the situation change as the experiment progresses and the subject is confronted with observations on previous tosses of the coin? We have seen that the number of strategies available to him become enormously multiplied and supply a larger class from which to choose; consequently, he has a better chance of finding one which is in some sense optimal. Again, without observations, there exists no strategy that will guarantee the attain- ment, on the average, of the values of the maximum income curve for all values of co. However, with a proper choice of a strategy based on observa- tions, this objective comes closer to being realized, and in fact, as the num- ber of observations increase, the expected income curves based on properly chosen strategies are no longer straight lines (see Figure III) and ap- proach the maximum attainable income curve. What constitutes properly chosen or admissible strategies will be taken up next. Let us first consider the income curves of each of the four strategies based on a single observation, given in Table 2. The income curve for strategy 1 which we designate by I(l11o) is clearly the same as I(Sl?o) and that of strategy 4 which we designate by 1(4|1o) is that of I(Sol)o). However, for strategies 2 and 3, the income curves 1(21co) and 1(31w) are parabolas. The income curve I(21co) is computed as follows: The only time when the sub- ject receives nonzero income is when he bets on head and head appears, or he bets on tail and tail appears. In the former case, he gets 100 units, in the latter case 150. Strategy 2 tells him to bet on head if head appears in the first toss. The probability that he wins on head is the product of the probabilities that the first toss is a head (and hence he will bet on head) and the second toss is a head (and hence he will win). Similarly, the prob- ability that he wins on tail is the product of the probabilities that the first toss is a tail and the second toss a tail. Consequently, the probability that 455 December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION</page><page sequence="9">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5 Expected Income Curves for Specified Strategies with One Observation 150 LI V.

It follows that: 1(2 w)) =100()2+150(1-w)) 2=250()2--3000+150. A similar argument shows that the income from strategy 3 is given by: I(3 o=250)(1-l-). The four income curves are plotted in Figure II. In addition to these four curves, Figure II also has the curve for the minimax strategy in which the 456 I /1 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5</page><page sequence="10">December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION first observation is ignored, namely, I(S.6lo), as well as the expected in- come l(Sio) from a randomized strategy S which selects strategies 2 and 4 (see Table 2) with probabilities 2/3 and 1/3, respectively. This curve is com- puted from: l(So) =2/31(2o)) +/31(41o)). A study of Figure II shows the following: 1. The maximum attainable income curve is given by curve A for values of o greater than .6, and by curve D for values of o less than .6. 2. At c)-.6, all the curves yield an expected income of 60 monetary units. This will also be true for any probability mixtures of these curves, i.e., randomized strategies. Thus, if the experimenter selects c)-.6, the subject cannot in the long run get any more than 60 units no matter what strategy he employs. For any other value of co, there is a strategy for the subject which will yield him an expected income of more than 60 units. For example, for wo=.8 either strategy A or B will accomplish this, or for co=.2, one of the three strategies B, F, or D will accomplish this. The value o--.6 may, therefore, be considered the least favorable value of co from the point of view of the subject. 3. There is a strategy, namely, strategy 2, whose income curve B begins to approach the maximum attainable income curve and, indeed, has three points in common with it, namely, the expected incomes for co0, .6, and 1, respectively. 4. Strategy 2 guarantees the subject for all values of oz an income which, in the long run, is never less than 60 monetary units. Since, if the experi- menter chooses 0co=.6, there is no strategy which will guarantee the subject an expected income of more than 60 units, it follows from the criterion given above that strategy 2 is a minimax strategy. 5. Strategy S.6 yielding the constant income curve E of 60 monetary units is also a minimax strategy. This strategy is one in which the subject ignores the result of the first observation, and tosses his own coin with r-.6 to determine his bet on the second toss of the experimenter's coin. However, strategy 2 which makes use of the first observation and takes advantage of any departure on the part of the experimenter from his minimax strategy co-.6, is manifestly superior to strategy S.6. For, if we examine the corre- sponding income curves B and E, we see that while they coincide for c0=-.6, curve B is higher than curve E for all other values of co. Thus, while both strategies are "safe" strategies, strategy 2 which utilizes the observation is as good, in terms of expected income, as strategy S6 for the least favor- able value of co, and better everywhere else. From the point of view of rational behavior, it is clear that the constant income minimax strategy S.6 should be discarded in favor of strategy 2, that is, the constant income minimax strategy can be classed as inadmissible. 6. Consider now strategy 3 yielding the income curve C. Here again we see that this curve is never above curve F so that it too should be classed as inadmissible. 457 December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION</page><page sequence="11">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5 We have now exhibited two strategies which are inadmissible, one strat- egy which is inadmissible among all general strategies, and one which is inadmissible among the minimax strategies. What constitutes an inadmis- sible strategy should now be clear from the context. A strategy S is inadmis- sible if there exists another strategy S* yielding an expected income which is never smaller than that of S for any value of c0, and is greater for some values of c). By contrast, then, a strategy S is admissible if no S* satisfying the above conditions exists. A little reflection will show that it is usually easier to demonstrate that a strategy is inadmissible than that it is admissible, for in the former case it is only necessary to produce an example of a better strategy, while in the latter case, one apparently is required to examine the whole class of strat- egies to be sure that no better one exists. But fortunately mathematical ingenuity comes into play here, and makes it possible often to characterize quite simply the whole class of admissible strategies. Thus, for example, in the case of one observation, all admissible strategies are of the form, "If head appeared in the first toss, bet on head, but if tail appeared in the first toss, then toss a coin with probability r for head, and bet according to its outcome"; or alternatively, "If head appeared in the first toss, toss a coin with probability r for head and bet according to its outcome, but if tail ap- peared, bet on tail." To get a better conception of the way in which decision theory separates the wheat from the chaff, let us consider the situation confronting the sub- ject prior to the (n+l)st toss of the coin, ignoring for the moment the problem of dovetailing the strategies from toss to toss. As we have pointed out, even if we discount the possibility of randomized strategies, the num- n ber of nonrandomized strategies available to him is 22 . However, decision n theory tells us that we never need to consider all of the 22 strategies since we can ignore the order in the sequences of heads and tails in n tosses, and base our decision entirely on the number of heads in each of these se- quences without affecting the realizable income. This immediately cuts down the number of nonrandomized strategies to 2n+l. Next, decision theory shows that of the totality of all possible strategies, randomized as well as nonrandomized, only those strategies are admissible which are of the form, "If the number of heads in the sequence of n tosses is less than c, bet on tail; if the number of heads in the n tosses is greater than c, bet on head; if the number of heads is equal to c, then toss a coin with probability r for head, and bet according to its outcome." Here c is an integer between zero and n, inclusive, and O&lt;r&lt;l. Moreover, it can also be shown that given any strategy which is not of this form, we can find one of this form which never is below it in terms of the resulting income curve. That is, in technical language, this class is complete. We see then that after the subject has observed the outcome of n tosses of the coin, a strategy for him, if he behaves in a reasonable way, consists in a choice of an integer c and a fraction r. We designate such a strategy 458 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5</page><page sequence="12">December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION Expected Income Curves for Specified Strotegies with Five Observations in i 125 I( i ) E o 0 o 75 c a, 50 25 0.4 w 0.6 0.8 1.0 FIGURE III by Sc,r.

Moreover, it can also be shown that this strategy is the only admissible minimax strategy with n observations. Figure III gives the income curves for the following three strategies for n-5: S1,o, S3,.76, which is minimax, and S3,0. A few remarks about the curves in this figure are in order. 1. The minimax strategy which yielded the income curve I(21[o) in Figure II remains a possible minimax strategy for this situation as well. It is a strategy which requires ignoring four out of the five observations and betting on the outcome of the fifth. But this minimax strategy is uni- formly worse than the strategy S3,.76, whose income curve is plotted in Figure III, except for the points co=0, o=1, and o=-.6, at all of which the two curves agree. 2. It is important to emphasize here once more that if the experimenter wishes to hold the subject to a maximum expected payoff of 60 units, he will never depart from o=.6. On the other hand, even if the subject had good reason to believe that this is the intention of the experimenter, it is still true that a rational way of behaving for him is to play the minimax strategy c-3, r-.76. This argument might appear more reasonable if we changed the setting from the rarefied atmosphere of pure research in learn- ing models, to a gambling house where the subject has to play red or black in roulette. Here the experimenter, now the house, will definitely try to construct a roulette wheel in such a way as to hold the maximum expected payoff to a minimum, but an optimal strategy for the subject, now the gambler, after observing the outcome of n plays, is a betting strategy which guarantees him at least that minimum, but at the same time takes advantage of any possible bias in the machine that is due to mechanical or other reasons. 3. If we examine the income curves of the remaining two strategies in Figure III, we see that curve A, the expected income from the strategy c=l, r=0, gets closer to the maximum attainable income curvefor co greater than .6, but this is accomplished at the expense of a relatively large depar- ture from the maximum attainable income curve for co less than .6. Curve B for the strategy c-3, r=O, on the other hand, reverses this situation. This is a general property of admissible strategies. They can be chosen so as to yield a substantial improvement for some values of co at the expense of other values. This suggests that a choice of a particular strategy from a class of admissible strategies would be facilitated if some prior information as to the possible choices of the value of co by the experimenter were avail- able. The type of information most commonly considered in decision theory is that of a known a priori probability distribution on the possible values of ?o with which the experimenter selects a particular co for his coin. An admissible strategy in this case is one which maximizes now the expected 460 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5</page><page sequence="14">December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION income with respect to this distribution. Such a strategy is known as a Bayes strategy. Bayes strategies play an important role in decision theory because they often are admissible and their totality generally forms a complete class of strategies. By this time, the reader may begin to be puzzled by the twist which has occurred during the course of the exposition. As a scientist interested in learning, he undoubtedly expected that some statistical wisdom would be unfolded as to how the learning experiment should be designed, conducted, and analyzed. Instead, he finds that thus far the major portion of the dis- cussion concerned itself with the rationality of the behavior of the subject. However, this twist, altho not altogether intentional, is highly fortunate from a conceptual point of view. In the general formulation of decision theory, nature plays the role of the experimenter in our illustration, and the decision-maker or statistician plays the role of the subject. Without wishing to give any anthropomorphic interpretations to the physical universe, it is highly instructive to consider nature as continuously tossing coins and per- forming other experiments with various random devices. The order we observe in the chaos around us can be conceived of as having the same structure as the order we observe in the sequence of tosses of a coin, and what is unknown to us in the random mechanism employed by nature is of the same structure as the bias in the coin put in by the experimenter in our illustration. The consequences of our actions and decision depend on these unknowns basically in the same manner as the expected income for the subject depends upon the value of co chosen by the experimenter. Finally, we can gain partial information as to the structure of the random device employed by nature by observing outcomes from it and basing our strategies upon these observations. But, unlike the case considered, obser- vations are usually costly, and a large part of decision theory is devoted to the problem of how to balance the cost of observations against the addi- tional information gained from them. Technical difficulties and space do not permit the formal development of the above ideas in their full generality. At best we can give a short out- line of some of the fundamental concepts involved and relate these to the illustration previously given. One of the fundamental concepts is that of an experiment. As is the case with the word strategy the everyday meaning of the word is too vague and ambiguous to be useful. When a layman thinks of an experiment, he may think of vials and test tubes if he has in mind a chemical experiment; of dials and electronic tubes if he thinks of an experiment in physics; or of a group of students memorizing nonsense syl- lables if he thinks of an experiment in education or psychology. However, in decision theory, an experiment is not what a scientist performs in a laboratory at any given time, but rather a set-up conceived in somewhat more abstract terms in which there are (a) a collection of possible ob- servables, (b) a collection of possible states of nature in the given situa- tion, and (c) for every state of nature in this collection, a probability distribution over the observables. The collection of observables is tech- 461 December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION</page><page sequence="15">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5 nically known as the outcome space, and is denoted by Z with elements z. The collection of possible states of nature is called the space of strategies for nature and is denoted by Q with elements o. Then, for each state of nature, the probability distribution on Z is denoted by p(zlco). In most sta- tistical problems, o plays the role of a parameter in the distribution, and Q is called the parameter space. In terms of our previous example, the outcome space Z consists of all possible sequences of heads and tails obtained by tossing a coin N times. The space Q is the interval of real numbers between zero and one from which the experimenter selects a value o as the bias for the coin. For any co, the probability distribution on Z is the binomial distribution. Thus, if z is a sequence in which the first n tosses contain r heads and n-r tails in a specified order, p(zlCo) =or(1Cl- )n-. As another example, the space of outcomes Z might consist of all possible time periods required by a subject to memorize 25 nonsense syllables. An element o in Q might consist of a pair (Mt, o) where !i is the mean and a is the standard deviation in the distribution of these time intervals. The form of the distribution is assumed to be normal, that is, p(zlo) is a normal density. We note that a data-collecting procedure is not necessarily an experi- ment as we have defined it, unless the above ingredients can be delineated in some manner. What usually makes an experiment poorly designed is the lack of specification of what constitutes Z, Q, and the class of probability distributions that are being contemplated. In addition to the notion of experiment, two other notions, that of an action space and that of a loss. function, are basic in any statistical de- cision problem. An action space is simply a collection of all possible actions or decisions available to the decision maker. The action space is usually denoted by A with elements a. Presumably, the problem of the decision maker is to choose an action from this collection, that is, an a from A. The specification of possible actions available to the decision maker is again less trivial than it appears. Thus, an investigator often may not realize that other courses of action are open to him, such as deferring judgment until further information is available, and because of this, he is forced into making an unwise decision. The concept of a loss function is somewhat more difficult. To begin with, decision theory puts the motivation of the decision maker in a some- what gloomy setting. Instead of evaluating each decision or action in terms of how much he can gain by it, he evaluates it in terms of how little he can lose by it compared with another decision or action. But whether we evaluate in terms of gain or loss, it is important at the outset to realize that this evaluation must depend not only on what he does but also on the actual state of nature. For example, the payoff to our subject in the illustra- tive example depended not only on what he bet, but also on the outcome 462 Vol. XXIV, No. 5 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH</page><page sequence="16">December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECTSTON of the toss which in turn depended on the o selected by the experimenter. For any a in A and any to in Q, the loss function is represented by L(co, a). Here again we see that decision theory demands a great deal of the deci- sion maker. It demands that he be in a position to evaluate numerically for every possible state of nature in the situation under consideration the consequences of any of the actions that he might take. It has been argued by many that no human being possesses the ability so to evaluate the utility of the various actions in all possible states. While this is not the place to enter into an extensive discussion of this subject, we shall merely state that the inability of the decision maker to formulate clearly the loss func- tion is, in fact, a stumbling block in determining what a rational mode of behavior is for him. More bluntly, it is impossible to tell a person what is an optimal way for him to behave if he is unable to formulate clearly what he is after. However, the inability to define a specific loss function should not prevent us from studying the consequences of various hypo- thetical loss functions. Also, great progress has recently been made in ob- taining important results in decision theory which are independent of the particular form of the loss function. Finally, decision theory acts as a gadfly to the research worker. It says to him: You cannot solve your problem unless you more clearly define your goal and the consequences of your decisions. Such a prodding is likely to be healthy. In addition, it must be emphasized that the classical Neyman-Pearson way of evaluating decisions by the size of the probability of being wrong is still available, and is easily incorporated in this new framework for statistics. As we have noted, the outcome space Z, the parameter space Q, the probability distributions p(zlco), the action space A, and the loss function L(w, a) constitute the elements of a statistical decision problem. A strategy for the statistician in this situation is called a decision function. It is a rule which specifies what action a in A will be selected for every outcome z in Z. A decision function is usually designated by d and the class of all possible decision functions or rules by D. \We have already seen examples of decision functions in the learning model problem. Note that for any z, d(z) is an element in A. For any decision function d and any co in Q, the loss is given by L(o, d(z) ). The expected loss, averaged for all z with respect to the prob- ability distribution p(zlco), is known as the risk and is designated by p(co, d). For a fixed d, p(o, d) when plotted against co yields a risk curve which is not unlike the income curves we studied in the learning model problem. We wish to emphasize here that a decision function is usually selected without the knowledge of what o is, since Co is at the control of nature. Minimax decision functions, admissible decision functions, in- admissible decision functions, and complete classes of decision functions are defined in a manner parallel to that for the illustrative example. In addition to defining these classes of strategies, decision theory often offers constructive methods for generating them. 463 December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DRECISION</page><page sequence="17">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5 As has been mentioned, decision theory is in the process of develop- ment and is not yet a completed science. It takes for its domain the problem of rational behavior in the face of unknown states of nature. It gives a logical foundation and framework to mathematical statistics which it has never had before. It grapples with the problem of design of experi- ments in a manner never before attempted in statistics. It insists that cost considerations and consequences of decisions be taken into account in every statistical investigation. In doing so, it has brought sequential theory into the general framework and has made sequential decision procedures the rule rather than the exception. It bridges the gap existing in classical statistics between testing hypotheses and estimation by showing that the distinction lies merely in the structure of A, which in one case is finite and in the other infinite. In its attempt to clarify the nature of the sta- tistical decision process, it exposes the limitations as to what is attainable in the face of ignorance and raises serious problems concerning rational behavior. One such problem, for example, is how to select a specific strategy from a class of admissible strategies if no prior information is available. This problem becomes particularly pertinent if we question the wisdom of the minimax approach against a neutral opponent, such as nature is for the statistician. Finally because decision theory deals with the problem of decision making in its greatest generality, every particular statistical prob- lem can be immediately placed in a general framework and thus exhibit its ramifications and implications. To illustrate the last remark, let us return once more to the coin-tossing experiment. We observe that the subject is never testing any hypothesis, null or otherwise. Instead, he takes actions; namely, he makes bets. Simi- larly, in many research situations there is a need to change the emphasis from hypothesis testing to decision making. For example, suppose co repre- sents the proportion of children who can learn certain arithmetical con- cepts in a given period of time by a new teaching method. Then the deci- sion to recommend this method or not, based on results of an experimental group is not dissimilar to the decisions of the subject in making bets on head or tail. Also, as in the case of the coin-tossing experiment, the prefer- ence of the research worker might be to recommend the new method for some values of co, and not to recommend it for other values. The important thing is that the region in which the true value of co lies is unknown, and the decision has to be based on the observations. The only intrinsic dif- ference between the two problems is that while the subject had a precise evaluation of what it meant for him to be right or wrong, the research worker is not in this happy situation. This makes the problem more dif- ficult, but not, on that account, essentially different. In the coin-tossing experiment, the subject was forced to make decisions after every toss, and his decisions were based on an increasing amount of information. It is not difficult to visualize the educational experiment mentioned above being carried out over a period of years, with additional 464 REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5</page><page sequence="18">December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION information being obtained each year. It is also conceivable that the re- search worker might be willing or be asked to commit himself on a tenta- tive yearly recommendation, allowing the possibility that from year to year he might reverse his decision. Now, in reference to the coin-tossing experi- ment, we have indicated that there is a problem of dovetailing the strat- egies from one toss to the next. That is, while for each sample size n we can describe an admissible class of strategies for the subject, it is not true in this case that an arbitrary selection from the class of admissible strategies for each n results in an admissible grand strategy prescribing the ac- tions thruout the whole course of the N tosses. What constitutes an admis- sible class of grand strategies for this as well as other cases has recently been found, and might have immediate applications to the kind of running experiment mentioned above. We observe that the subject in the coin-tossing experiment at each stage is making a prediction concerning the outcome of a random variable, namely, the result of the toss of a coin. But this is a special case of the general problem of prediction when formulated in decision theory lan- guage. More precisely, in a prediction situation, the experimenter has ob- tained a sample of observations from a distribution with an unknown wo and he is concerned not with co itself, but rather with the outcome of a future observation from the distribution specified by it. The loss function in this case will usually depend on the difference between the value of the random variable which occurs and the predicted value. The general predic- tion problem is now being analyzed from the decision theoretic point of view and the final results will undoubtedly find applications in the field of social science in general and education in particular. One feature which the coin-tossing problem does not exhibit, but the more general problem of the two-armed bandit does, is that of design. In the two-armed bandit problem, with (o+O not necessarily equal to unity, the subject's aim is to decide as soon as possible which arm has the larger probability of paying off. But he has several courses of action open to him in order to arrive at such a decision. He can pull the left arm for a specified period of time, or the right arm, or alternate between the right and left in some prescribed manner. What is the optimal design? Here once more we have a problem which is not mere idle curiosity. Very often in research, we have two alternative experiments available, each shedding light on a given problem, and we may want to know how many of each experiment to perform and in what order. Interest heightens in such prob- lems when the cost of performing the two experiments differs. To summarize, statistical decision theory is statistics looked upon from a broader and more unified point of view. To those who have mastered the concepts of decision theory, it gives a new way of looking at problems and furnishes new tools for attacking them. As yet there exists no general elementary treatise on statistical decision theory to which the reader can be referred. The only nontechnical discussion appears in a review by 465 December 1954 SURVEY OF STATISTICAL DECISION</page><page sequence="19">REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol. XXIV, No. 5~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Savage (4) of Wald's book, Statistical Decision Functions (5).

The book Design for Decision by Bross (2) presents a philosophical discussion of the deci- sion problem, but does not consider statistical technics in the general framework of modern statistical decision theory. A review of the litera- ture on the economic theory of decision making and of psychological ex- periments relevant to it, together with a discussion of some of the concepts of game theory, was given by Edwards (3).
