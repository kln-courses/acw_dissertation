<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letters On animal "abuse" The title of a recent TST article by Michael W. Fox and M. Andrea Ward reads, "Are Science Fairs Fair to Animals?" [Sept. TST, p. 31. ] The answer is clearly "No." In my opinion, science fairs have been di rectly responsible for downgrading proper standards of animal use by stu dents. Animal abuse in science competitions has been with us for many years. In the 1960s teenagers were commonly re warded for botched monkey surgery. In 1969 a high school student blinded spar rows, then starved them to death. This "experiment" won a prize. After protests were made, amateur monkey surgery stopped; and after the sparrow episode, the Westinghouse Science Talent Search imposed strict rules banning vertebrate animal studies, which have effectively prevented further animal abuse. The protests made by responsible teachers, scientists, and humanitarians have been helpful in improving stan dards. However, despite some changes, the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), with the support of the Na tional Society for Medical Research (NSMR), retains permissive rules which sanction high school projects involving animal surgery and induction of crippling diseases in small animals. Dr, Fox and Ms. Ward briefly docu ment some of the problems which inevit ably persist. Let me add more. The 1976 ISEF included teenage projects in animal surgery, at least one of which was un supervised and conducted at home, where public health concerns alone should preclude such activities. Another prize-winning project involved spraying the ears of the student's own kittens with hair spray to try to induce deafness. A completely unscientific project on the "bends" resulted in the death of all the animals used. Other students adminis tered harmful substances to small mam mals to demonstrate the well-known fact that sickness and death result. Each year there is a preponderance of projects such as these both at the ISEF and at local fairs. Often the work is performed in unsani tary and inadequate facilities, is unscien tific and of poor quality. None of these projects are humane, and none are educa tionally sound. The students are not to blame for this unsavory state of affairs. An enthusiastic 16-year-old once boasted to me that she had killed 1000 small mammals for her competition project. She had been led to believe by her sponsors that these deaths somehow enhanced the importance and worthiness of her project. Clearly, she was an innocent person who had been seriously and, who knows, perhaps ir revocably, misguided by her adult men tors. In my opinion, the teachers, scien tists, and administrators who promote such values do a disservice to science. In his published response to the article by Ward and Fox, Thurman Grafton, writ ing on behalf of NSMR, dismisses the au thors' criticisms of science fairs, calling them "anthropomorphic" and "an tivivisectionist." He states that the article tells a "big lie" in asserting that animal pain and suffering can be compared with human suffering. No such assumption is made in the article. NSMR's charge that this article repre sents a "kind of propaganda commonly used by antivivisectionists" is also mis leading. Three years ago when I too crit icized animal use in science fairs, NSMR publicly named me an antivivisec tionistâ€”despite my known record as a medical research worker who con sistently upholds the justification for animal experimentation by professional scientists. (NSMR later retracted this charge.) To attempt to suggest that any one who speaks up about improper ani mal use is, ipso facto, an antivivisec tionist, and against all animal experimen tation, is ill-founded. There are many people and organizations having no an tivivisectionist beliefs that nonetheless deplore the standards of animal use found in science fairs. The solution to the problems of animal use in science fairs suggested by NSMR is unrealistic. They suggest that all will be well if affiliated science fairs adopt the rules used by 1SEF. However, since 1SEF does not demonstrate acceptable stan dards, how will imposing the same weak standards on other fairs remedy the situa tion? Far more stringent measures are re quired. A satisfactory solution has been found in Canada. After years of trying different approaches, the Canadian Council on Animal Care now finds that the only suc cessful way to control improper animal use in science fairs is to ban all vertebrate animal experimentation. This ban, im posed also by the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, is necessary in extracur ricular activities because of the frequent lack of supervision and of adequate facilities for animal care. However, non painful vertebrate studies are permitted by the Canadian Council for curricular, classroom projects Similar rules are promulgated in the U.S. by the Humane Society of the United States and the Animal Welfare Institute, and have been adopted by several school systems. The ISEF would do well to listen to criticisms and take bolder steps to elimi nate inappropriate animal use. F.
