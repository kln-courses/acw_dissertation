<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS T. R. N. Edwards, Three Russian Writers and the Irrational: Zamyatin, PiTnyak, and Bulgakov, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, London, New York, 1982,220 pp. Edwards is concerned in this book "to examine aspects of the irrational in the works of Zamyatin, P?'nyak, and Bulgakov" (p. ix). Although his expUcit and immediate goal is to examine the irrational in these three writers, and but secondarily to see the entire nineteenth and twentieth century literary tradi tion as in some sense bound up with the irrational, there is nevertheless a pervading underlying assumption that Zamyatin, PU'nyak, and Bulgakov are but examples of a commitment to the irrational that goes deep into Russian Uterary history. This is made clear by Edwards when he explores the ties and influences of nineteenth-century Russian literature, in particular of Gogol, and, more substantiaUy, Dostoevsky, but even of Lermontov (whose Hero of Our Time he sees as a forerunner to Dostoevsky's 'Underground Man'), on the three selected writers, and the influence of the irrational on the nine teenth-century giants (again, especiaUy Dostoevsky). Why does Edwards choose to focus his attention on Zamyatin, PU'nyak, and Bulgakov, if aU of Russian ? including Soviet (he mentions Solzenitsyn and Sinjavsky, too, for example) - Uterature is rooted in the irrational? Simply because he accounts this troika of writers as the best of Soviet writers in the period of the Civ? War and New Economic PoUcy (1920s and 1930s). Clearly another reason for his choice of these three writers, a reason which w?l read?y occur to Edwards' readers by the time they have completed this book, is that aU three take up in their writings the issue of the relation of the creative writer to the formal structure of the Union of Soviet Writers and the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (in Bulgakov's Master i Margarita, especiaUy, which satirizes the 'estabUshment' writers of 'MassoUt'). In fact, as weU shaU see, this rebeUiousness is itself an aspect of what Edwards caUs the 'irrational', but which, more comprehensively, should be caUed 'duxovnaja kul'tura'. AU three members of this troika came in for their share of criticism from orthodox Soviet writers and critics, and the work of each, to varying degrees, conse quently suffered. This anti-estabUshmentism proves to be a symptom of something deeper, something which pervades the duxovnaja kul'tura generaUy, and Russian literary history at least since its modern inception with Radiscev in the time of Catherine the Great. In fact, we can And it very much earlier, in Awakum's Studies in Soviet Thought 25 (1983) 227.</page><page sequence="2">228 REVIEWS Zitie, for example, and even in the Ufe of ancient Kiev. It belongs to the ideological struggle between spiritual freedom and secular authority. Edwards identifies this ideological battle with the tension between the irrational and the rational. If he is correct, then we must redefine Irrational' here and bring it closer to 'spiritual'; particularly, we must understand it in the sense of the Russian 'duxovnyf, with its full range of associations and connotations of the spiritual, the mental, the reUgious. That means that the historical tradition has its antecedents in the Nikonian reforms and in the Petrine aboUtion of the Patriarchate. Edwards at one point (pp. 88-89) closely identifies PU'nyak's sensitivity to nature, which he [Edwards] understands as romanticism, with the same sensitivity found in the Zitie of Awakum, Nikon's principal opponent, just as, earUer (pp. 15-16), Edwards makes the same identification of Awakum's underground dungeon with the room under the floor of Dostoevsky's Underground Man. The raskoV can be understood as the unity of several interrelated conflicts. On the one side are the traditionaUsts, who prefer to preserve their orthodoxy as it has been handed down to them by their ancestors. In this can be found an inheritance from the ancient Slavic ancestor worship, since there is a sacred element to the dziady; the ancestors were minor deities, and they might weU be aroused if their religious tenets, the true orthodoxy, were violated by the breaking of the ancient traditions. On the other side are the modernists, who aimed at correcting the accumulat ed errors and excrescences of the ages, to return to the original standard. On the one side are those who might weU be caUed the irrationaUsts, they who wished to preserve the emotional content of the Uturgy as it had been handed to them through the generations. On the other side are the rationalists, or better, the inteUectuaUsts, who wished to apply their Greek scholarship to purify the corrupted texts. On the one side are those who might be called the symboUsts, for whom every deta? of the ritual held a symbolic meaning with emotional content, and for whom reUgion consisted in the spiritual value of the rituaUstic deta? of every word and gesture. (Thus, it is not merely a question of whether one crosses oneself with two fingers, expressing the dual nature of Christ, or with three fingers, expressing the Trinity.) On the other side were the formalists or purists, for whom the structure of the religious service was the essence of orthodoxy, and for whom corruptions and accre tions of the past had to be excised or corrected. On the one side are the realists or naturaUsts, who sought the mystic and the human; on the other side the metaphysicians, who eschewed the human and the practical. On the</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 229 one side are the faithful, the spirituaUsts; on the other side the legaUsts, the bearers of authority. To use Edwards' terms, on the one side are the irrationa lists, i.e. the duxovniki, on the other the rationaUsts. Each of the troika speaks for the duxovniki. Certainly each raises support for some strong feature characteristic of the duxovniki, Zamyatin for the raskoVniki: "If you compare the Church Slavonic Uterature of the Old BeUevers with the Orthodox texts, you w?l discover enormous differences between them. And this difference is not in favor of the Orthodox books ..." [Edwards, p. 83, quoting Zamyatin, '? jazyke9]. PU'nyak for the traditiona Usts: "What do you think moves the world ... ? Work? Knowledge? Love? No, nothing Uke it! ? Memory, memory moves the world" [Edwards, p. 100, quoting Jakov Skudrin in P?'nyak's Volga vpadaet v kaspijskoe more]. And PU'nyak, for humanism against metaphysicaUsm; '... mountains of books heaped up in aU the corners ? but a simple book about simple human love ..., - a book Uke that was not to be found at Popov's". [Edwards, p. 131, quoting P?'nyak, 'Ch?dhood and Boyhood', p. 36.] And Bulgakov, Edwards suggests (p. 160), saw the intimate connection between practical skiU and reUgiosity, expressed in Master i Margarita. The duxovniki are dissidents, they are placed outside of the reUgious estabUshment, and many become priestless {bispopovci). Interestingly, but understandably, unsurprisingly, the raskoVniki became the core of many popular revolts against the authority of the ruUng classes. The peasant jacquerie is not a political revolution, but precisely a bunt, a spontaneous and egregious pogrom (riot) whose aim is undefined; it is an emotional outburst releasing frustrations with legaUsm and authority, and may therefore be understood as an expression of riih?istic freedom. Here is one sense in which we can understand Berdyaev's aphorism, "svoboda vkorennina v nebyte Hi v n??to". This trend becomes even more pronounced in the aftermath of the Nikonian, and again the Petrine, reforms, in the rise of the streltsi and in the RazinMna and Pugaievliina, as well as in the minor upheavals of the stranniki and beguny foUowing Peter's violations of the reUgious sensibiUties of the raskoVniki, and again in Peter's abolition of the Patriarchate and its replacement with the Holy Synod. We misunderstand, I think, if we claim that, by this latter act, Peter made reUgion an instrument of the state; what he had done was to secularize, and thereby rationalize, reUgion, by making it a department of government, consummating Caesaro-papism. This gives the bunt poUtical as weU as reUgious, i.e. spiritual, impetus. From this, it is a</page><page sequence="4">230 REVIEWS natural step to the political resistance to Tsarism among the revolutionary parties in the nineteenth century. The revolutionary parties have been charac terized, almost uniformly by historians, to possess reUgious, that is moral spiritual, zeal. Here, I think, are the roots ofthat characteristic, which in fact is best understood as a smefStonnafa religioznosf, a displaced sense of reUgion. But here we may, indeed must, think of religioznosf as duxovnosf. A dialectical tension has thus been created between spiritual freedom and secular authority, the former blending traditionaUsm, irrationaUsm, symbo Usm, spirituaUsm, naturaUsm (or sensuaUsm), emotionaUsm; the latter blend ing modernism, rationalism (or inteUectuaUsm), formaUsm, legaUsm, reaUsm (or metaphysicaUsm), scientism. In the nineteenth century, the tension gives rise, once the large-scale bunt recedes after the PugafcevSSina, to a tension between the orientalism of the Slavoph? and the occidentaUsm of the Westernizer; and this theme, increasingly poUticized and secularized, domi nates the intelligentsia. Edwards focuses the nineteenth century debate on Dostoevsky, the duxovnik, and his main adversary ?ernyaevskij, the secularist rationaUst. AU three of the authors Edwards considers are to some important degree heir to the Dostoevskian legacy, of irrationaUsm {duxovnosf). Thus, Edwards (p. 84) concurs with the view of A. KaSin that Zamyatin was a "thinker with a displaced sense of religion"; displaced because, rejecting materiaUsm and sterile rationaUsm, Zamyatin directed his attack against the organization of the [Soviet] state, a purely rational construct, a highly order ed system bu?t along ideological Unes that are directed by the laws of reason (a concretion of Marxist philosophy and its dialectical laws, absolute laws of Reason, the concretization of the HegeUan law of the Geist or Absolute Reason). Thus, wh?e Zamyatin supports the February revolution as a bunt, he rejects the October revolution as a poUtico-ideological rational movement - a vystuplenie). In PU'nyak, the association between the Bolshevik revolu tion as a bunt, "a Russian people's revolution, a bunt ? and nothing more" [Edwards, p. 105, quoting P?'nyak's Golyy God, p. 95], and Marxism is made, and the October revolution consequently rejected, as he saw Marxism as objectionable inasmuch as it is a German product, an effulgence of Western, hence decadent, rationaUsm. Interestingly, the nineteenth-century intelUgen tsia had a deep interest in HegeUan thought, however. Does this fascination with HegeUan Reason contradict Edwards' understanding of duxovnaja kul'tura in the Russian Uterary tradition? I think that, in associating the tradition of the irrational, as duxovnosf,</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 231 with naturaUsm (itself a product of HegeUan ideaUsm), Edwards merely scrapes the surface of the Uterary psyche of these authors, and misunderstands the Russian soul. The kind of naturaUsm which Edwards has in mind is the radical logical outcome of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century romanticism. Edwards sees the influence of Hegel on nineteenth-century writers as evidence of this romanticism. As further evidence, he cites [p. 6] a letter (of February 22, 1859) in which Dostoevsky requests Hegel's History of Philosophy, and even Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. It is even true that Lenin recommends Hegel as a prerequisite to any reading of Marx. There must, therefore, be something more than romantic rationaUsm that ties both a Dostoevsky and a Lenin together in duxovnosf. The clue to what this might be is given in Zamyatin's evocation of the Scythian (in his novel My and his essay 'Skife-lfV). But not as Edwards understands this evocation. For Edwards, the Scythian, the w?d horseman of the steppe, is merely the pagan, whose free spirit forces him to remain outside of the One State, 'beyond the waU', outside, that is, of the rational order of authority. But the evocation of izbanaia Rus\ of ancient wooden Russia, by the Slavoph?s and their twentieth-century descendants, Zamyatin, Pil'nyak, and Bulgakov, among others, is precisely not an evocation of a Rousseauian state of nature, and the Scythians of Zamyatin's We {My) are not the noble savages of romantic Europe. Nothing could be more clear, as indicated by the skazki of PU'nyak and the magic somnambuUc phantasmagoriae of Bulgakov. But again, Edwards misreads these. To see exactly how far Edwards misread the evidence which he himself cites, consider the quotation which he gives (p. 107) from PU'nyak's Golyy God (p. 84): But Orthodox Christianity came along with the tsars, with an aUen power, and the people went away from it - into sectarianism, became soothsayers. Admittedly, he comes close, when, in introducing this passage, he reminds us that [PU'nyak's S?'vestr writes about] "pagan Russia and its beUefs and customs which, according to him [S?'vestr], Christianity has never replaced". This is the closest that Edwards come to a reaUzation of the true nature of duxovnosf, of the spiritual content, duxovnaja kul'tura, of the Russian psyche, or of what I have labeUed 'Perun's Revenge Syndrome' (my review of Xenia Gasiorowska, The Image of Peter the Great in Russian Fiction, Studies in Soviet Thought 23 (1982), 174). Perun, ancient Slavic thunder god, the creator of fire, was forcibly baptiz</page><page sequence="6">232 REVIEWS ed by his immersion into the Dniepr. Perun's revenge is the so-caUed dvoeverie or 'double faith' of the ancients, the intrusion of pagan elements into the duxovnaja kul'tura of the people, and their resistance to pravoslavie, to orthodoxy, to 'right praising'. The reference which Edwards makes (p. 54) to Dostoevsky and Stavrogin's preference for Christ over istina, if they should prove to be different, emphasizes a dual preference, which is imputed to Dostoevsky through Stavrogin, for spiritual freedom, or duxovnosf, over external control and foreign or authoritarian (i.e. Caesaro-papist) domination, whether prophetic or profane, and for the anthropomorphic and mystical over the metaphysical, the theoretical. It is a preference for Christ over God the Father. The appeal is to Perun, to his nature as lord of fire, in his dual role as Satan of the furnace of fire and as Christ of the baptism *with the Holy Ghost and with fire". The first aspect of this choice and the second are both represented, with emphasis on the personal aspect of both, by PU'nyak's Donat, who proclaims [Golyy God, p. 119; quoted by Edwards, p. 109] that "there is but one rule ? our spiritual conscience and brotherly customs", which is as precise a definition of Sobornost' as one may hope to find. In Zamyatin's My, the rational order of the One State is opposed to Beyond-the-WaU, to the free spirit and duxovnosf of the Scythian. Yet even within the waUs, guarded, is found the Ancient House, the Uving museum of tradition. In PU'nyak, we find an evocation of the ancient folk culture, deeply rooted in animism, the hylozooic anthropomorphism of Slavic paganism. PU'nyak's stories are skazki, and often the distinction between human, animal, and god is blurred, as it was for the ancients, and as it remains preserved in the folk tales of tradition. This comes through clearly in his 'God ix Zizni, where Makar, the bear, lives Ufe on human terms, with humans, but is a demigod. In Master i Margarita (and other works) of Bulgakov, is found a supernatural parody of the orthodox sacraments and orthodox theology, a Russian Faust legend, whose heroes in fact are shamans, pagan Slavic volxvi, in the guise of supermodern scientist-magicians. It is the Satanic figure of Woland who is the dispenser of mercy, and it is he who teaches Faustian resistance to conformity to the rational order, pravoslavie, of Zamyatin's One State. Bulgakov's Woland, Zamyatin's Scythians and Mephi, suggest Dostoevsky's choice of Christ over istina, and, more deeply, suggests the identification of both Satan and Christ in the lord of fire, Perun. Each writer, therefore, emphasizes to varying degrees each aspect of what I have caUed the Perun's Revenge Syndrome.</page></plain_text>
