<plain_text><page sequence="1">Performing the body in pre-Hispanic Central America ROSEMARY A. JOYCE Making bodies Judith Butler notes that a beginning point for many feminist analyses of gender is an argument that genders are "ways of culturally interpreting the sexed body," means by which particular symbolic value is given within specific cultural circumstances to human bodies with distinct sexual characteristics (1991:24-25, 112, 134-141 )J Such approaches presume the prior reality of the body and perpetuate a dichotomy between nature (sex) and culture (gender) that is ultimately insupportable; sex, as much as gender, is culturally constructed. Butler argues that the "production of sex as the prediscursive ought to be understood as the effect of the apparatus of cultural construction designated by gender" (Butler 1991:7). The illusory, transparent existence of the "natural" body is itself a byproduct of discourse about bodily materiality (Butler 1993:1-16, 101-119). In Butler's view, particular physical characteristics of the body are isolated as signifying sex through the performance of gendered activity, while this embodiment misleadingly casts an air of naturalism on the already cultural categories of sex. Instead of presuming that sex acts as a kind of grounding, a preexisting essence, for gender, Butler views sex itself as a cultural and symbolic interpretation of bodily materiality (1991 ). Not denying the real existence of the body, Butler instead argues that bodies are only made intelligible in terms of specific cultural readings that mutually construct sex, gender, age, race, and other embodied ways of being. It is with this understanding of the social construction of bodies, as the imposition on the flesh of certain forms of intelligibility, that I wish to begin. I take as a model the analysis of the cultural construction of the sexed body in the European tradition. Thomas Laqueur demonstrates that the literary texts of early European philosophy and later European science, by their denotation of different aspects of material bodies, effectively naturalized the definitions of organs that Euro-American societies accept as subdivisions of the body today (1989, 1990). He illustrates the way that scientific drawings presented isolated parts of bodies according to schema of bodily divisions and identities of parts of male and female bodies, subordinating the observation of nature to culturally specific models of difference in the body, but lending these models an aura of objectivity through conventions of realism. Butler argues that, within the Euro-American tradition, representations in both visual and textual media reiterate limits on the intelligibility of the body (1993). Representations of the body, whether in words or in ?mages, are themselves the media through which bodily partitions are made to appear as natural facts and alternative construals of bodily materiality are excluded as unthinkable and unintelligible. I argue that the same slippage between representation and bodily existence is discernible in pre-Columbian images from Central America.2 Among the earliest and most enduring subjects of representation in pre-Hispanic Central America are 1. The present paper is a greatly revised version of one presented at the conference "Gender and Material Culture: From Prehistory to the Present" at the University of Exeter. I would like to thank Drs. Moira Donald and Linda Hurcombe for accepting the original paper for the conference and allowing the paper to be read in my absence. The latter duty was ably carried out by John Gerry, whose assistance was appreciated. The paper incorporates part of the discussion I prepared for the session "The Decorated Body" at the 1994 College Art Association meetings in New York City, organized by Michelle Marcus. I would like to thank Michelle Marcus for the invitation to be part of the session and all the participants in that session. Their papers provided the stimulation to present a paper on related topics at the 1995 meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America and to contribute to a volume developing from these two sessions, in which I pursue other points made in my original presentations. A substantial part of the discussion of Costa Rican material was fostered by an invitation to curate a temporary exhibit at the Davis Museum and Cultural Center of Wellesley College in 1993. I would like to thank the museum's director Susan Taylor, Judy Hoos-Fox, and especially Joseph Giuffries for facilitating this exhibit, and Peabody Museum staff, especially Viva Fisher, Gloria Greis, and Steve Burger, for help in arranging loans and photography for the exhibit and accompanying publication. 2. I use Central America throughout only in the sense of the geographic region extending from Mexico to Panama. As will become clear, I explicitly assume that many of the practices I discuss are more widespread and recognize that any boundaries on what should be thought of as a hemispheric network of interconnected societies are ultimately artificial. In this case, the delimitation is one dictated by my own familiarity with materials. I avoid the use of the term Mesoamerica because in my view it is largely a reification of specific contemporary interests on the part of prehistorians (see contributions to Graham 1993 for further discussion).</page><page sequence="2">148 RES 33 SPRING 1998 human bodies and body parts. In making human images in a wide range of media?modeling pottery effigies and figurines and stucco figures, incising low relief on stone, shell, and bone, and painting on paper, plaster, and ceramic vessels?pre-Hispanic artists in Central America selected some features of the body for representation and excluded others. The choices they made materially constructed the body as a subject for reflection and discourse. Dan Sperber labels such cultural constructs "public representations" and assigns a crucial role in creation of society to their dissemination and circulation (1992:60-64). Such public representations mark the limits of intelligibility of the already culturally formed prediscursive body (in Butler's terms [1991, 1993]). Following Laqueur's example, I argue that the construction of representations of bodies and body parts actively constituted theories of the body, its limits and subdivisions, and of difference in the body (1990). Like Butler, I suggest that such theories were not dispassionate, but highly charged, marking some ways of being in the world as unacceptable and others as of greatest value. Formal characteristics of Central American human representations allow us to see the process of concretization of philosophies of the body in these societies and to begin to examine the kinds of bodies they imply. These representations suggest human appearance and behavior through resemblance or iconic relations. Michael Herzfeld notes that iconic representations "because they either look natural' or can be 'naturalized', are a good deal more labile [than more 'arbitrary' signs], and lend themselves with particular ease to totalizing cultural ideologies" (1992:68-69). Because they appear to be chosen merely to establish resemblance, the selection of features to be incorporated is a means by which stereotypes of natural or essential human behavior may be promulgated. The use of the human body as a form for ceramic vessels in Central America and of patterning to suggest the presence of a surface combine to present the body as a skin enclosing contents. The representation of body parts, notably heads but also isolated limbs, suggests an alternative, but not contradictory, representation of the body as made up of parts delimited through their ability to stand alone as self-sufficient subjects. The coherence of the pre-Columbian Central American body was thus questionable in at least two ways: first, through the fluidity of passage of bodily contents in and out of the containerlike skin; and second, through the potential independence of part from whole as a separate and willful subject of action and intelligibility. Making bodies in pre-Hispanic Costa Rica I begin with a consideration of these two aspects of presenting the body in Costa Rican pottery and stone sculpture.3 Devoid of clothing, Costa Rican figures present the surface of the body itself to the viewer's gaze (fig. 1). The nudity of the bodies, revealing genitalia, entails their explicit sexual identification. Incising on stone sculptures and incising and painting on pottery sculptures delineates their surfaces as skins bounding the three-dimensional modeled form of the body (Snarskis 1981b:cat. nos. 66, 84-86, 193). Skin singled out through body markings defines the person as a physically bounded body integrated by this membrane, but also implies the potential partition of skin and contents dramatized by the public representation of bodies as containers (fig. 2). Markings drawing attention to the body's surface as an analytically separable unit are complemented by the partitioning of the body into pieces in stone and pottery sculptures. Costa Rican figurai sculpture isolates the head in particular as a subject, portraying freestanding heads and full figures displaying severed heads (fig. 3; compare Leibsohn 1988). The execution of pottery effigies in which the head is a lid that can be removed and replaced identifies pottery containers as subject to the same partitioning of head and body (Snarskis 1981b:cat. no. 59, 60). Contemporary material practices tied these representations to the fleshed body. Snarskis (1992:158) reports that a stone sculpture of a head was interred in a burial in the highlands of Costa Rica, dating circa 1000 a.D., a practice that identifies the representation with the human body for which this was a resting place. Pottery stamps from Costa Rica were probably used in fact to mark human skin, demarcating it through practice as a distinct body part (Carlsen 1988:193). As a motif found on stamps, the decapitated body marked living bodies with headless bodies, the flesh displaying its own separability (fig. 4; Carlsen 1988:196-198). The use of the human form for effigy vessels identified skin, which 3.

Actual practices of partitioning bodies are dramatically attested to by the recovery at Barrial de Heredia of human thigh bones used as axe handles for precisely the kind of tool held aloft by apparent decapitators in stone sculpture (Snarskis 1981 b:211 ). Despite the existence of practices of body processing, the range of partial bodies represented is quite restricted. The pre-Hispanic Costa Rican body is presented as a textured surface enclosing unrepresented contents, uniting generic hands, legs, and genitalia with more differentiated, separable heads. Conventionalized facial features crosscut male and female figures and render the sexual identity of detached heads indeterminable. Counterpoised to the generalized character of facial features is the particularity of hair treatment of each sculpture (fig. 1 ). This elaboration creates a unique appearance for each head through the use of motifs otherwise categorically employed to ornament pottery and stone carvings and to indicate textile decoration. Marked in the same manner, the heads of Costa Rican figures are identified with inorganic products of human labor, manufactured cultural forms, rather than as organic elements of nature. Even the species identity of Costa Rican bodies is unstable. Figures combine animal heads and humanoid bodies (fig. 5). Mark Miller Graham (1981:122-123; 1992:183) and Michael Snarskis (1981b:cat. nos. 144-146, 196-198) describe these composite figures as masked impersonators of gods or ancestors. Masking would have underlined in performance the fluidity of boundaries between species and the disintegration of the unified body, just as sculpted images presented these same propositions about the body as a public representation subject to discourse (compare Snarskis 1981b:cat. nos. 23-31, 160-164). Practice, representation, and the pre-Columbian body The interrelated practices of construction of representations of bodies and body parts, of performance of hybrid bodies through masking, and of literal processing of bodies were not unique to pre Columbian Costa Rica. They framed discourse about the body in a wide area, extending at least from Mexico to</page><page sequence="5">Joyce: Performing the body in pre-Hispanic Central America 151 Figure 3.

Motifs of headless bodies from Costa Rican stamps, circa a.d. 1-700. Denver Art Museum. After Carlsen (1988). Peru.4 Decapitation and dismemberment?at its most developed, the separation of arms, legs, and head from the torso?are themes in art and are attested in practice throughout this range (Benson 1975:106; Gillespie 1991:321-330, 333-339; Klein 1988; Moser 1973; Silverman 1988:422; Townsend 1985:129-131). Throughout the same area, the skin was singled out through permanent and impermanent modification, including tattooing and body paint (for example, for the Maya, Thompson 1946, based primarily on Landa's descriptions; see Tozzer 1941:89, 91, 125-126). In the Aztec world, the isolation of the skin was enacted through ritual flaying (Brown 1984; Wilkerson 1984:107-108; see also, Gillespie 1989:68-78, 84, 210-213). In northern Central America, the removal of the heart from the body cavity and its representation as a separate subject most vividly illustrate the propensity throughout this area to analyze and present the body as a set of separate parts (Duverger 1989). Disembowelment is depicted in Postclassic Central Mexican manuscripts, which Klein (1990-1991, 1993:24-25) argues refer to the punishment actually meted out for sexual transgressions, and in murals depicting defeated warriors at Cacaxtla (Baird 1989:113, fig. 7). Even when bodies were represented as unified, an underlying understanding of their potential separability into discrete parts was implicit because of the currency of such cultural practices of body processing. Masked performance was apparently similarly widespread (see Couch 1991, Markman and Markman 1989). Masking is implied in Costa Rican art by composite beings combining animal facial features with a human body. But animal masks themselves were not produced in permanent media. Instead, human masks, which may be connected to the ultimate processing of the body in mortuary ritual, are found. Snarskis writes that pottery masks "in the Costa Rican archaeological corpus almost certainly symbolize death heads. The series of small perforations around the perimeters suggests that they were sewn onto something, either large effigy figures or, more likely, funerary bundles" (1981 b:188). Esther Pasztory notes that stone masks in Teotihuacan style, although commonly considered likely to have been used to provide a face for funerary bundles, have never been found in burials by archaeologists, but she characterizes them as substitute "faces" for perishable sculptures of composite ancestor spirits (1992:294-295, 1993:54). Wooden and painted textile masks were a common feature of Andean 4. Perhaps testifying to their successful naturalization, I can cite few general sources on body processing, which is usually discussed explicitly only in passing in the context of some other goal. The citations in the following paragraphs are thus intended to be exemplary, not exhaustive, of the topics mentioned. I have elsewhere presented arguments that body processing, including skull shaping, scarification, tattooing, piercing, hair cutting, body painting, and clothing were the primary means by which children were socialized and transformed into adults, and adults were further transformed into elders and ultimately, post-mortem, into ancestors, in pre-Hispanic Central America (Joyce 1994, 1995a, 1995b, 1996).</page><page sequence="7">Joyce: Performing the body in pre-Hispanic Central America 153 Figure 5.

At the end of the fleshed existence of the body, the dismemberment implied by Costa Rican sculptures of severed heads is partially reversed through the manufacture of an attachable visage. Where a severed head retains unique hair treatments, the mask presents as focal the animating features: fleshy mouth, eyes, and nose (compare fig. 6). The severed head, already shown as separable from the body, is further partitioned between the generalized human face and the distinctive marks of particularity lent by the texturing of hair. In Maya and Mexican representations, the place occupied in Costa Rican representations by unique hairstyles is taken by elaborate headdresses that signify rank and sometimes incorporate individual names or titles (for example, the names of Stormy Sky on Tikal Stela 31; Coggins 1975:184-186; compare Kelley 1982). The difference between the Costa Rican severed head as an entirety, individuated by the cultural processing of hair, and death masks of the fleshed visage, recalls the analysis by Houston and Stuart (1998) of the Maya concepts of bah (self, person, body, head), associated with iconography of decapitation, and ich (eye, face, surface). Mexico's earliest representational traditions document the same analytic approach to the body, its integration, and identity. Making bodies in Formative Period Mexico As in Costa Rica, Mexican Formative Period art is replete with representations of the body and its parts. Ceramic, wood, and stone sculptures include both full body effigies and isolated body parts of humans and human/animal hybrids (compare Pohorilenko 1996b). The most dramatic examples are, of course, the colossal stone heads from Gulf Coast sites (de la Fuente 1992).5 Each head wears a helmet, and no two are identical in the details of their elaboration, incorporating such materials as feathers and small bird heads, bird claws and jaguar paws, plaited cords, and beads (fig. 7). The individuality of these sculptures has led to their interpretation as portraits of specific rulers of the major Olmec towns (Coe 1977:186; Grove 1981:65-67; de la Fuente 1996:48-49; Cyphers 1996b). Like the Costa Rican stone and ceramic sculptures of severed heads, they also establish the separable quality of the head as a 5. A complete catalogue of the 17 examples documented as of 1996 was produced as part of a special, apparently undated, edition of Arqueolog?a Mexicana distributed in conjunction with an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1996. It includes black and white drawings to a single scale in the front endpapers, color photographs on unnumbered pages bound in following page 91, and a commentary by Ann Cyphers 11996b].</page><page sequence="8">154 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Figure 6.

This separability was commonly put into practice through the decapitation of three-dimensional human figurai sculptures (Grove 1981:50, table 1). In an enactment of the identification of these figurai sculptures with their human subjects, the head removed from one such stone sculpture was placed in a human burial at Chalcatzingo, Morelos, a burial proposed as that of the person portrayed in the sculpture (Grove 1981:57-58; Grove and ?ngulo 1987:125-126; Merry de Morales 1987:103, 122). While reminiscent of the incorporation of a sculpture of a severed head in a burial noted in Costa Rica, this Mexican practice further blurs the line between body and its representation: in place of a sculpture made to represent an already severed head, a three-dimensional statue is treated as if it were a body to be decapitated (see fig. 8). This practice permanently Figure 7. Gulf Coast Olmec stone colossal head, San Lorenzo Phase, 1150-900 b.c., San Lorenzo Monument 2. H: 2.69 m.

The actual practice of decapitation and dismemberment of human bodies is directly associated with representations of partial bodies in the form of wooden busts preserved at the site of El Manat? in the Gulf Coast. Associated with most of the documented sculptures were the remains of newborn infants "whose bodies had apparently been dismembered and/or cut into sections (some with the extremities still articulated). These fragmentary infant remains occur dispersed around certain sculptures. In some instances the bones had been covered with powdered hematite. The most exceptional of these discoveries is the infant cranium found near Sculpture 17, with its man-made U-shaped cut and attached cord" (Ortiz and Rodriguez n.d.). The infant cranium processed for use as a body ornament further blurs the line between the materialization of subjects in the flesh and in representational media in Formative Period Mexico. The wooden sculptures themselves, like the colossal stone heads, are individuated by the use of costume, including ear spools</page><page sequence="9">Joyce: Performing the body in pre-Hispanic Central America 155 Figure 8.

The preservation of much of the upper body in the wooden busts, an area not represented on the colossal stone heads, allows their costuming to also incorporate pectoral ornaments. Like the stone sculptures, the wooden busts are identified as probable portraits: "the individuality of the busts could indicate that they were representations of chiefs or rulers or personalities who achieved a high level of prestige, leading to an attempt to immortalize them with images" (Ortiz and Rodriguez n.d.). Surface wear suggests that the wooden busts were interred after a use-life. It is possible that these wooden busts were originally more complete, then were dismembered like the infants that accompanied them, and buried like the severed head of the stone sculpture at Chalcatzingo and like the flesh and bones of innumerable inhabitants of Formative Period sites in Mexico. Just as patterns of terminal processing and disposal of representational sculptures and human bodies overlapped, so did practices of materialization of the body recorded in representations and the remains of buried bodies. Stamps and seals depicting body motifs (fig. 9) were likely used in body painting, as attested to in contemporary figurines (for example, atTlatilco; Garcia Moll et al. 1991:223, fig. 95:20). Human footprints, hand/paw motifs, and isolated animal heads were subjects of these devices (Field 1967; Garcia Moll et al. 1991:fig. 106:1; Grove 1987:fig. 16.5a-e). A stamp from Chalcatzingo (compared by David Grove to one reported from Tlatilco) depicts a body with concentric circles in place of the head, reproducing the theme of the decapitated body noted in stamps from Costa Rica (Grove 1987:275, fig. 16.5f). As in Costa Rica, living bodies would have carried these images as markings on their skin, inscribing the separability of the body on the living flesh. Overlapping practices of body processing and representation began in infancy. AtTlatilco in Central Mexico, 58 percent of adults buried at the site and 77 percent of the females had their skulls shaped by frontal occipital flattening, with the effects of this process evident in children as young as nine months (Joyce 1995a, based on data reported in Garcia Moll et al. 1991). The elongated form of the head on Formative Period sculptures (fig. 10), interpreted as a naturalistic representation of this shaping, was further emphasized in many cases by the absence of any indication of hair, a feature usually described as shaving (for example, Ochoa 1996b, Castro-Leal 1996a, Niederberger 1996).</page><page sequence="10">156 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Processing of hair, like the shaping of the skull, treated the physical body as raw material to be worked into socially interpretable shape, much like the stone, wood, and clay used to form effigies. Hair cutting was a major means by which later Mexican peoples shaped adult identity (Joyce 1994, 1995a, 1995b, 1996). Unlike cranial modification, which is attested to by the shaped skull itself, Formative Period hair treatments can only be inferred from their already stylized re-presentations in sculpture. As depicted, they do not fully conform to any single interpretive dimension: neither presumed gender, age, activity, nor material medium seems to account for the variation noted (Benson 1996:221). Formative Period Mexican sculptures do not exhibit individualized hair treatments, as was true of the human images from Costa Rica. Instead, hair is either completely covered by a headdress, shaved, or parted at the center, with parallel lines or sets of pu notations representing the substance of the hair (for example, on a ceramic acrobat figurine from Tlatilco; Ochoa 1996c). On Formative Period ceramic figurines of the Honduran Playa de los Muertos style, punctation represents closely cropped hair and forms one alternative in a series of hair styles that employ shaved and beaded areas to achieve unique appearances in which hair length and elaboration correlate with age (Joyce 1997). The difference between these two contemporary representational traditions is that the unique features of the heads of Mexican Formative Period sculptures are not integral, but take the form of detachable headdresses. Lacking a headdress, a Formative Mexican sculpture is generic, but the detachable headdresses are no less a part of the materialization of the body than the beaded locks of hair on the Honduran figurines (fig. 11). Formative Period representations explicitly present the body as subject to partition that does not terminate, but rather extends, the possibilities of action of the liberated body parts. The lower leg and foot are subjects of multiple Formative Period Mexican representations. An effigy vessel from Tlatilco depicts a human leg from the knee down (fig. 12). Knobs on the calves suggest the presence of rattle-balls, hollow ceramic spheres found in burials at this location, ornaments that transformed the legs of their wearers into musical instruments. Such figurai sculptures isolated and marked this bodily practice (Joyce 1995a, based on data in Garcia Moll et al. 1991). Contemporary pottery stamps (fig. 9) represent a human footprint at sites such as Tlatilco (Garcia Moll et al. 1991:230) and Chalcatzingo (Grove 1987:275). By the end of the Formative Period, emergent scripts employed the human footprint as a sign, apparently standing for movement in space, for example on Monument 13 from La Venta. Like the lower leg, the foot was defined through representation as an independent body part and linked to typifying action. A similar process isolated the hand as an active performative part, the subject of independent representation (compare Pohorilenko 1996b:123). At La Venta, hands are isolated as a subject through their execution as jade ornaments and through abstraction of an anthropomorphic representation incised on a celt (Castro-Leal 1996b, 1996c). The celt presents only the minimal bodily features, hands and eyes, required to establish typical action; the hands grasp instruments of ritual action, the eyes gaze out from the surface of the celt providing the visage that allows the headdress depicted to be animated. Like the footprint, the hand came into use in Late Formative scripts as an iconic element in signs for verbs (for example, Macri and Stark 1993:27-28,47,49). Figure 9.

By permission of the University of Texas Press. The separation between the face and the top of the head noted in Costa Rica is also typical of Formative Period Mexican stone sculpture. In place of hair, the top of the head is covered by a helmet or other headdress, in which are concentrated those elements that can be traced as markers of specific identity from colossal stone heads to low-relief sculptures and from one site to another (Grove 1981:65-67). The face, the fleshed visage from which eyes look out and in which lips and tongue stand ready to speak and ears ready to hear, was executed in life-size perishable wood and permanent stone masks (for example, Pohorilenko 1996a; Matos 1996). Unfortunately none of these masks have been recovered in primary context, so the possibility that they were used to attach a visage to the flesh less body, like their counterparts in Costa Rica, cannot be evaluated. Following the logic of identification between the flesh and its stone counterpart that is characteristic of Formative Period Mexican societies, however, James Porter has demonstrated that some figurai sculptures were subjected to terminal processing that eradicated all but the face and its unique headdress, transforming thrones with their full-body portraits into colossal heads (1989). Grove argues that the "physical transformation, from ruler's 'thrones' to ruler's portrait heads, was a significant symbolic transformation as well. Those conversions were presumably carried out following the death of the rulers, i.e., when they themselves were transformed into ancestors" (n.d.). The Formative Mexican representations and practices raise urgent questions about the relationships that ensued when durable media replaced transitory flesh. Practices of inscription and the durability of the body Raul Connerton (1989:72-73), in a consideration of the ways that societies create social memory, distinguishes between what he calls bodily practices and inscriptional practices. Bodily practices are intimate, internalized, and fleeting. They take place in what Michael Herzfeld calls social time, "the grist of everyday experience. It is above all the kind of time in which events cannot be predicted but in which every effort can be made to influence them. It is the time that gives events their reality, because it encounters each as one of a kind" (1991:10). Dance, haircutting, and body painting exemplify bodily practi s. Inscriptional practices, in contrast, make permanent more ephemeral actions and appearances. They separate these actions from their locally situated position in the bodies and lives of particular persons and submit them to wider social comment and evaluation. Inscriptional practices facilitate the creation of histories. Histories are written in monumental time, the "bureaucratic measure of history"</page><page sequence="12">158 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Figure 11.

Histories project the local into a more universal framework, placing the determination of action outside the control of individuals, naturalizing and concealing the exercise of power. Their monumental time "is reductive and generic. It encounters events as realizations of some supreme destiny, and it reduces social experience to collective predictability. Its main focus is on the past?a past constituted by categories and stereotypes" (Herzfeld 1991:10). The interplay between bodily practices and inscriptional practices, between social time and monumental time, will consequently be complex; monumental time is managed so as to appear to be simply the writing large of social time, and inscriptional practices are deployed in ways that delimit the scope of intelligibility of bodily practices (in Judith Butler's terms; see Butler 1993:111-115, 162-166). Carol Ivory's analysis of body ornamentation in the Marquesas Islands exemplifies the complexity of these transformations (1994). Marquesan artists isolate the surface of the body as a focus of decoration in both the permanent form of tattoo and the impermanent forms of bleaching and painting. Tattoo has the effect of accumulating through time, in palimpsest. Regardless of the readability of individual designs, heavily tattooed bodies exhibit the traces of the duration of participation in this practice. The impermanent practices of bleaching and painting mark the bodies of youths temporarily involved in hospitality, singing, and dancing. These two kinds of skin markings deliberately contrast statuses with and without history. At the same time, they both signified status in ways strikingly different from the use of fans, staffs, and other ornaments that could be detached from the body. We might describe the difference between these categories of practices as one of degrees of intimacy, inalienability (Weiner 1992), or individuation (Munn 1986). Modifications of the body's own substance are forceful transformative acts, but the close association of certain cultural goods with the body makes clothing and ornaments equally intimate media for materializing the body. The use of ornaments and items of dress in turn requires and leads to changes in the flesh itself. The distension of perforations made for labrets among Northwest Coast Indians from the weight of the labrets, damage to teeth from the ornament, and difficulty in Figure 12.

Body decoration, whether displayed directly on the living body or represented in other media, serves to transform the raw material of flesh, bones, and hair into the culturally prescribed form of a person. Terence Turner described practices of body ornamentation in Amazonia as the gradual creation of a "social skin" (1980). The transformation of the body into a person through processing of skin and hair and the attachment of culturally appropriate ornaments makes of the body a field of signification. In a contrary flow, the presentation of the body as in some sense natural, or perhaps better as given, implied by the process of socializing it through marking, simultaneously facilitates the naturalization of those signifiers that are attached to it. It is the act of marking that begins to separate the body from prior states by creating a visible history of its socialization. The inalienability of a marking transforms</page><page sequence="14">160 RES 33 SPRING 1998 the social time of bodily practice into the monumental time of inscribed practice. When the practice of proper adornment is memorialized in stone, as it was in Costa Rica and Formative Mexico, body decoration is inscribed as a subject with a particular history, an aesthetics, and a social force beyond the interests of particular persons in their own lives and bodies. Costa Rican sculptors made the head the seat of individual distinction, which was expressed through unique hair treatment. The elaboration of actual hair treatments on living people would have transformed the given, natural material into differentiated cultural form, a transformative process not unlike those involved in creating pottery and stone sculptures. Severed heads displayed evidence of the social creation of individual distinction in the hair treatments they inscribed. The separation of the head from the body denaturalized the apparent integration of the whole. In Costa Rica, the creation of effigies of the whole body and its parts, in stone and pottery was an exercise in the creation of social personhood as surely as was the decoration of the living body. But unlike the living body, subject to death and dissolutipn, the sculpted body was permanent and has endured. The permanence of the sexed body The consequences of the analytic approach to the body that Central American body processing, masking, and figurai sculpture created and reinforced are exemplified by the materialization of gender. Butler argues that gender is "an incessant or repeated action of some sort" on the part of sexed bodies (1991:112). And not merely action in general, but those highly stereotyped actions that she calls citational (Butler 1993), actions that are repeated according to social conventions and subject to social evaluation, actions taking place in Herzfeld's monumental time that "reduces social experience to collective predictability" (1991:10). For the constructed and potentially separable bodies of Costa Rican sculptures, the body parts that carry gender must be those that are the media for gendered citational performance. Costa Rican sculptures with male genitalia raise axes and detached heads, actions that conflate the agricultural labor of field clearing with the political labor of harvesting war captives (Graham 1992). Figures with female genitalia hold infants, serving bowls, or their breasts, embodying their performance of food production and reproduction (Joyce 1993). While Costa Rican sculptures of detached heads lack both sexual and gender specificity, detached hands engaged in selected gestures are intelligible as gendered body parts. As Snarskis writes of one stone sculpture holding hands on its chest, "although neither breasts nor genitals are shown; perhaps the posture was sufficient to characterize the sculpture as female" (1981b:217). The observation that hands, more than genitalia, were the bodily locus of gender in Costa Rican sculpture underscores Butler's argument for a "radical formulation of the sex/gender distinction" in which "it does not follow that to be a given sex is to become a given gender. . . sexed bodies can be the occasion for a number of different genders, and further, that gender itself need not be restricted to the usual two. If sex does not limit gender, then perhaps there are genders, ways of culturally interpreting the sexed body, that are in no way restricted by the apparent duality of sex" (1991:112). That this is more than an abstract possibility is, I suggest, made indisputable by formal characteristics of representations of the body in Central America. Depiction of genitalia was not a constant feature. In order to speak of gendered citational performance by "sexed bodies," we must allow for a body whose sex is neutral, a possibility that was materialized in at least one Central American representational tradition, that of Formative Period Mexico. Some Formative Central Mexican figurines depict explicit male and female genitalia, but these traditions also include naked figures without genitalia. Generally called "babies" (Coe 1965a, 1965b), in a naturalistic assimilation of their pudgy "infantile" proportions to narratives of dependency embedded in depictions of similar figures held in the arms in contemporary monumental stone sculpture and small-scale pottery figurines (Joralemon 1981), they may equally be related to similarly proportioned figures in monumental sculpture identified as "dwarfs" (Pohorilenko 1996b:121?123). A representative pottery figurine from Tlapacoya (Ochoa 1996a), for example, shares many of the formal features of the Atlantean dwarfs on a throne from Potrero Nuevo (Cyphers 1996a). While the naturalistic assumption of their infant identity might make the suppression of genitalia in these figures intelligible (Pohorilenko 1996b:121), the presence within the class of supernatural or adult human actors without genitalia, such as the ceramic transformation figure from Atlihuayan, Morelos (Ochoa 1996b) makes</page><page sequence="15">Joyce: Performing the body in pre-Hispanic Central America 161 this line of argument less compelling. In the presence of contemporary traditions of figurai representation that explicitly depict sexual characteristics, these sexually neutral figures mark an alternative form of bodily materiality.6 Central American sculpture displays the construction of bodies as the culmination of many separate, social acts. The endowment of the head with unique character through the embellishment of hair and headdress, the sensory engagement for which the parts of the face serve as vehicles, and the performance of embodied and sexed action, even the marking of the skin as body boundary through painted designs, are re-presented in durable sculptures. The bodies constructed through the body processing and its public representation are a record of and instrument for experience. Stone and pottery human images form a record of the bodily practices particularly significant in these societies. By giving permanent material form to selected practices, pre-Hispanic Central American artists exposed fleeting aspects of human experience to reflection, shifting bodily practices to inscribed practices. As the unreflective reenactment of traditional postures and action, bodily practices reinforced the status quo. Their inscription in material media shifted the temporality of experience further toward reiteration, citation of precedent. As Francisco V?rela writes of embodiment, "sensory and motor processes, perception and action, are fundamentally inseparable in lived cognition . . . [because] cognition depends on the kinds of experience that come from having a body with various sensorimotor capacities ... [a body] embedded in a more encompassing biological and cultural context (1992:329-330), society and environment. It is through the body that knowledge is created, as Pierre Bourdieu would have it, through "a durable manner of standing, speaking, and thereby of feeling and thinking" (1977:93-94). Unexamined bodily practices learned in a particular society through observation and imitation form the ground for social memory, including social memory of what it is to be in the flesh and how bodily being can be understood. The interp?n?tration of experience of the body and its representation in Central American societies powerfully advanced particular theories of the body by naturalizing them in experience, transcribing them in durable form, and subjecting them to discursive reflection. 6. The examples of this gender-neutral class of figure that I cite are all from secure proveniences. Unfortunately, this is not the case for many examples of complete "baby" figurines, including some in which infantile characteristics are strongly marked. Since it is impossible in these cases to rule out contamination of the visual record by knowledge of scholarly speculation on the part of modern artists catering to the art market, I exclude them from my discussion. This exclusion does not affect the thrust of my argument. I have no doubt that infants could have been explicit subjects of artistic representation. But if they are, and if the baby-faced figurines are "infantile", then infancy itself is presented as a form of bodily being in which sexual organs are immaterial. In other works I argue that we might usefully regard infancy and childhood as a distinct gender in at least some Central American traditions (Joyce 1994, 1995b).
