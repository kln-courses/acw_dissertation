<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XXXVI JANUARY, 1926 No. i THE MONIST AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY I. WHAT IS MEANT BY PHILOSOPHY IN GENERAL, it may be described as "the thinking consideration of things" (denkende Betrachtung der Gegenst nde), said Hegel. It is, however, neither the only nor the earliest form of thinking : thinking in the first instance, and still for the most part, is practical or rather instrumental to practice. But thinking is prompted at length by the curiosity which leisure brings : necessity may be the mother of invention but "wonder is the mother 01 Knowledge" as an end in itself.1 Science and philosophy are alike in so far as, in both, truth for its own sake is said to be what we pursue. Nevertheless, neither the end nor the motive in the two cases is quite the same. In the sense in which we talk of many sciences we do not talk of many philosophies, and in the sense in which we talk of many philosophies we do not talk of many sciences. There are several sciences, because each has a restricted domain, deals with some special class or aspect of things ; whereas in that sense philosophy is one, for it purports to embrace the whole of things. On the other hand, while we recog nize only one science of physics or chemistry or biology, we find almost as many philosophical systems as there have been philosophers : all of them striving to present an intel ligible Weltanschauung or "synoptic view" of the concrete whole. It might strike one as odd, but for the familiarity i Cf. Aristotle, Metaphysics, 982b, 10-27.</page><page sequence="2">2 THE MONIST of it, that philosophies are often named after their authors, Platonism, Epicureanism, Cartesianism, Spinozism, Hegel ianism, etc., while no science ever bears a human name. This difference we may find presently to be due to the fact that philosophy is primarily a personal matter. Science seeks to know the what and the how of this or that : phil osophy seeks to know the zvhy or meaning of the whole. And meaning in experience varies with the experient: to no two men is the world quite the same. But much as philosophies have varied, "the philosophic spirit" has been always essentially the same-the habit of reflecting upon one's stock of knowledges2 in the hope of unifying them all in one concrete "intuition" or "Idea." And to "knowledge" here we must give a wide meaning, including whatever is accepted as true, whether actually true or not. Thales did not philosophize the less, because he regarded the magnet as alive ; or Plato, because he be lieved in the pre-existence of souls ; or Aquinas, because he held the doctrine of transubstantiation; or Schelling, be cause he believed in clairvoyance. Given certain materials -knowledges or what are reputed such-the philosophic habit is a species of mental rumination in which the mind endeavors to elaborate the various items of experience into such form and order as to render them an intelligible and organic whole. It is important, then, to distinguish be tween the "informing" or organizing spirit of philosophy and the outcome in a particular instance: for the latter is often so crude and imperfect that we, with our wider knowledge and clearer insight, may fail to see anything in it deserving to be called philosophic at all. Few, we may suppose, nowadays begin the study of early Greek philoso phy without feeling this. Most of us found it hard to see 2 This "term in frequent use by Bacon (and others), though now obsolete should be revived" (Hamilton, Metaphysics I., p. 57 fin.)-a proposal which Herbert Spencer seconded, and which has moreover the support of French and German usage.</page><page sequence="3">AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY 3 anything but absurdity in the doctrine of Thales for in stance, that the principle or aQX'H of all things is water ; or in the doctrine of Anaximenes that all the variety of nature is due to a thickening or thinning of another primeval ele ment, viz , air. Even the more abstract speculation of the Pythagoreans-of whom Aristotle tells us that they re garded number as the essence of all things, and the organi zation of the universe as but a harmonious system of num bers and their relations-even this will appear as barren and empty from excess of abstraction as the Ionian phil osophies seemed crude and confined from defect of it. But very much the same feeling might possess us on observing the earliest attempts at pictorial representation, the rude scratches on mammoth tusks, for example, no more like a man than the conventional diagrams of Homo sapiens full face and profile combined-which school-children draw on their slates. But the point is, both are pictures, however bad as likenesses : they are the outcome of the idea of pictorial representation, the result of an artistic pur pose. So it was with the earliest attempts at philosophy. Here, too, we must distinguish between the idea and its execution : all the pregnant worth of these primitive essays lay in the idea that there is an aQyr\ or first principle; so that all the diversified plurality of the world may be traced to some fundamental One. II. PHILOSOPHY AND MYTHOLOGY We may realize the significance of this early philosophy more clearly by contrasting it with the mythology that preceded it. In that imagination was dominant, and there was no tendency to generalize: behind the concrete facts of sense there were only the concrete creations of fancy. "Mythology ran riot in a plurality or multitude of powers</page><page sequence="4">4 THE MONIST which it invoked, and to which it assigned the government of the universe ; but philosophy, on the contrary, aimed at a unity of agency or causation in all things. [Thus] the very conception of reducing the diversified exuberance, the infinite plentitude, of nature to the unity of one principle, showed a speculative boldness which proved that a new intellectual era was dawning on mankind."3 Still we must not forget that unity here implies continuity and in fact, looking closer, we find a certain continuity even between mythology and philosophy. The savage, too, has his metaphysics : as Andrew Lang has well said, "The chief distinction between his mode of conceiving the world and ours is his vast extension of the theory of personality. To the savage ... all nature wa;* a congeries of animated personalities."4 This anthropo morphism, so flagrant in the th ogonies and cosmogonies of polytheism, we still recognize without difficulty as shap ing the literature as well as the art of religion even in the present day.5 But the like is equally true, though less obvious, in the case of philosophy. Thales for instance not only, according to Aristotle, connected his doctrine with the ancient myth that Oceanus was the father of gods and men, but supposed all things to be full of gods.6 Even Plato turned old myths to account and invented several new ones, if what is deliberately invented by one man may be called a myth. Altogether, Plato is credited with some dozen myths of one sort or another.7 We seem justified, then, in maintaining the presence of anthropomorphism or "poetical metaphysics" not only in the speculation of primitive man but even in those of philosophers down to our own time. But "dogmatic anthropomorphism," as Kant called it-which had lingered on both in theology and 3 J. F. Ferrier, Lectures on Greek Philosophy, 1875, pp. 41, 40. 4 Andrew Lang, "Mythology," Ency.

Stewart, The Myths of Plato, 1905.</page><page sequence="5">AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY 5 philosophy, though assuming ever worthier forms as humanity itself advanced-was finally rejected as "not proven" in Hume's famous Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. Admitting this, Kant nevertheless maintained that "symbolic anthropomorphism/' an anthropomorphism that is to say, based on analogy, is still necessary as fur nishing us with "regulative Ideas."8 But the philosophies of the Absolute that have been in vogue since Kant's day and flourish still, claim-at any rate as "barely theoreti cal"-to have eliminated all such analogies. Granting this and leaving aside for the present the ques tion how far philosophy can be called "barely theoretical," we may still point out that the "real categories"-substance and attribute, cause and effect, end and means-which even these philosophies recognize, are themselves anthrop omorphic.9 But here what philosophy has failed to do, positive science claims to have now done. This brings us to a new point. III. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY Here again we are reminded that unity implies contin uity, and again, in fact, we find it. Philosophy presupposes knowledges, even when it essays to take the royal or a priori road ; but it does not necessarily presuppose science. In western thought indeed philosophy is comparable to a primitive nebula from which the sciences in a certain order were gradually set loose as satellites. The need for that division of labor which the advance of knowledge has involved was hardly felt before the six 8 Cf. his Prolegomena, 1783, Secs. 57, 58, pp. 173ff. 9 Cf. The writer's Psychological Principles, 1918, ch. xiii, sec. 6 ; and on the question generally, the late F. Paulsen's essay "Die Zukunftsaufgaben der Philosophie" in Systematische (edited by P. Hinneberg), 1908, pp. 407ff.</page><page sequence="6">6 THE MONIST teenth century. The ancient philosophers in particular were all more or less polymathic : all the general knowledge of their time they knew, and to systematize and extend it was the main business of their lives. But some knowledges took scientific form sooner than others; and there were two sciences in particular-mathematics and logic-which, though developing alongside of philosophy are really, and were from the first, largely independent of it. This inde pendence they owe to their purely abstract form and exact character which seemed to betoken a certain transcendence, complete freedom, in other words, from all the presupposi tions which concrete things imply. In consequence, they have themselves powerfully influenced the course of phil osophy down to our own day; for reality without restric tion is its theme ; and logic and mathematics seem to cover everything and yet, as formal, to depend on nothing. It was this exaltation of the exact sciences that led Greek philosophy to disregard the empirical and historical-a strange outcome of the desire to find the meaning of things. Let us try briefly to note how the philosophic spirit was thus first diverted from thinking about things to thinking about thoughts. It is perfectly possible, however, to think about both without inverting their relations. But this is not what happened in Greece, where our western philoso phy took its rise. Had civilization begun in England or Holland, for example, where industrial and mercantile in terests are so absorbing, the history of this philosophy would have been vastly different from what it is.10 The intellectas sibi permissus, that wrong way of attaining truth which Bacon exposed, might then not have retarded the progress of empirical knowledge for two thousand 10 F. A. Lange thought that even as it was, from the standpoint of Sophists like protagoras a development of Knowledge was already possible that would have obviated or short-circuited "the great digression (Umschwung) which led the world for thousands of years into the false path of the Platonic idealism."

As it was, while the natural sciences were still un born, the Greek mind gave birth to what is known as dia lectic. I. Logic. Beginning with this we may consider first the influence on philosophy of logic, which in fact was the offspring of dialectic. According to Aristotle, dialectic was the invention of the Eleatic philosopher, Zeno : in fact, however, it seems to have been for him a necessity of the situation rather than a method deliberately devised. He was bent on refuting the pluralists who were his philoso phical opponents, and he developed the contradictions im plicit in their doctrines simply as the most effective way of refuting them. But his negative results were so imposing that it is no surprise to find Socrates-and Plato, still more consciously-employing this dialectical method with the positive aim of eliciting knowledge by turning thought in wards "to recollect itself." In doing so they exerted an influence on the future of philosophy second to none beside. Ignorant alike of psychology and philology-professing, in fact, to know nothing-nevertheless, Socrates in his endeavor to evoke the meaning or definition implied in words helped at once to prepare the logical instrument of knowledge and to prevent its efficient use. Misconceiving the relation of words to thoughts and of thoughts to things, Plato, the disciple whom he inspired, then pro pounded his famous "realism"-commonly called the Pla tonic idealism-thereby inaugurating a philosophical myth ology that in one form or another lasted on till its consum mation in the Logic of Hegel.12 Plato maintained that "universals" were entia prior to and independent of fientia, the particulars perceived by sense.13 12 In the preface to the second edition of his Logic, written within a week of his death, Hegel himself refers sympathetically to Plato as his forerunner. Cf. p. 13. 13 Cf. G. Grote's Aristotle, 2nd. ed., 1880, App. I. "The Doctrine of Uni versals."</page><page sequence="8">8 THE MONIST More than that, he also maintained that the one way to knowledge of entia, to philosophy that is to say, was the dialectical way of immanent logical development : to empi rical knowledge no philosophical validity was to be allowed at all. So, from that day to quite modern times, philoso phy, as Bacon said, was engrossed with its own anticipatio mentis and diverted from the interpretatio naturae; while the empirical sciences, so long as they remained under its step-motherly tutelage, scarcely progressed at all. There were, it came to be assumed, two sources of knowledge, reason and sense, and two kinds of knowledge, that of noumena and that of phenomena-to use the old terminol ogy which Kant revived-the one constituting what he at one time called the mundus int elligibilis, the other what he called the mundus sensibilis. The former had come to be spoken of as the world sub-specie aeternitatis, beyond not merely time but space as well;14 this was the world of ideas, where alone according to Plato truth could dwell. The latter was the world of nature, the empirical world of change in space and time : this for Plato was the sublunary abode of passing shadows, the domain of opinion and prob ability at the best. After all, it may be said, the intelligible world seen by the light of reason, is surely the world that philosophy should strive to understand; can it be that the pursuit of such knowledge will ever be abandoned ? At any rate the dialectical method of attaining it has come to be regarded more and more as delusive and unsubstantial-negatively in consequence of continual crises in the history of philos ophy itself, and positively in consequence of the progress of science in spite of it. The first great crisis in the development of philosophy began at once with Plato's own disciple, Aristotle. Dialec 14 As regards space, however, perhaps all rationalists were not equally clear-Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz, for example, held conflicting views.</page><page sequence="9">AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY 9 tic never meant for Aristotle what it meant for his master. Nevertheless, he improved the imperfect instrument that Socrates and Plato had made out of it. But it is a mistake, although a common one, to identify logic as Aristotle con ceived it with the so-called formal logic into which it was ultimately transformed.15 Aristotle's Logic was no mere instrument (or organon) of that maieutic art which Socra tes professed ; and Aristotle never regarded it as such. It was that, but it was much more.16 True, he raised the stand dard against the Platonic realism, but he only modified it : he never broke with it altogether. As Prantl has said, he was still Platonic, and without Plato would be unintel ligible. He still admitted the reality of universals; and denied only that they were independently and antecedently real: their reality for him consisted in their embodiment in particulars. On the other hand, even Plato allowed that the particular had a certain semblance of reality, because it participated in or adumbrated a universal. As regards particulars then, the two philosophers had some common ground; yet their methods were different: Aristotle started where Plato ended, that is to say, with the actual things with which he found himself surrounded. These were either natural or artificial : he began with the latter first of all as the better known, for man had made them. So he came by his famous doctrine of the four causes-the material, the formal, the efficient and the final. But in the case of artifacts, the three latter are connected together in the individual artisan, who for the sake of the end devises the form and effects its embodiment or mate rialization. In this owfretov as Aristotle called it, the form is the determining factor, but the artisan is the indispens able agent or "moving cause." But Aristotle left the effi 15 Cf. Prantl, Geschichte der Logik, I, pp. 135-140. 16 No sharp line can be drawn between the subject-matter of Aristotle's so-called Logic and that of his metaphysics or "first philosophy"; nor in fact between this and what he called physics. (Cf. Grote's Aristotle, pp. 62, 422.)</page><page sequence="10">IO THE MONIST cient agent-for a time at all events-out of account, and regarded the universal or form as if it were what Prantl describes as ein sch pferische Wesensbegriff, or had itself "notional causality," as Grote translates the term. If we stop here, many thinkers have felt that after all Plato's position was the better of the two: for according to that, the "ideas" were real anyhow ; whereas, according to Aris totle, the forms not being real per se, but only notional, could surely not effect their own realization. Merely to deny Plato's position did not help him to establish his own ; for it is inconceivable how two non-entities can effect the synthesis whereby they become xo8s xi, hoc aliquid. So far, Aristotle's procedure had been primarily ana lytic. It is, however, only fair to him to say that he did not ignore this further problem concerning the synthesis itself which the particular as compound (awo ov) implies. Accordingly the correlatives, matter and form, are now supplemented by another pair-bringing the moving cause again upon the scene-viz., potentiality (Swaine;) and actuality or energy (evegyeia). The former correlatives, matter and form, were relevant to the question what the concrete particular is; the latter, potentiality and energy are concerned in the question how it comes to be. The venue is thus completely altered : Aristotle now for a time leaves the domain of "logic," to which change and process are altogether foreign, for that of "physic" or nature,17 where they are always dominant and at home. The new terms, as we have seen, found their clearest exemplifica tion in mankind; for potentiality means power or faculty, as "latent," and energy faculty or power, in overt action. Now-since any movement suggests some prior potenti ality-we may bring the changes in nature into line with the chanp-es we make. 17 Etymology, often helpful in revealing conceptual along with lexual roots, may be usefully appealed to here. Cf. &lt;t&gt; &lt;ris and natura.</page><page sequence="11">AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY II But potentiality in Greek has another meaning which Aristotle expressly distinguished, viz., possibility. The two meanings are indeed connected, since potentiality as such implies logical possibility; and Aristotle plays fast and loose with the two. "We must not seek a definition of everything," he says, and here "must be content to grasp the analogy."18 But what is this analogy? The statue is to the marble block as the man actually studying to the man when he is not. But the relation of the statue to the block of marble is the relation of form to matter, while the rela tion of the man when he is studying to the man when he is not is the relation of energy to potentiality. The man not studying can study if he likes : the process here starts from the faculty. But the shapeless block cannot begin of itself to take on form: the so-called potentiality then is here no faculty; it is just bare possibility-a fact which Aristotle himself brings out when he follows back the notion of matter to its limit. So far as becoming a statue goes, the block can do nothing. But as mere matter, mat ter as such is not potential; so pure form, form as such, cannot be actual : to be that it must be real.19 How then could Aristotle assume any inherent efficiency in form, and yet refuse to recognize the independent "real ity" which Plato attributed to it? This question still awaits an answer. Meanwhile several of Aristotle's ablest com mentators have pointed out that his analogy so far from dispensing him from definition hampers him with contra dictions of which he seems dimly conscious and yet does not seriously face20-contradictions so glaring that a well meant attempt has recently been made to relieve him of 18 Metaphysic IX, vi, init. 19 These two pairs of correlatives pre-eminently characteristic of Aris totle's phlosophy have remained fundamental in the terminology of philosophy till our own day without ever being adequately scrutinized. 20 Cf. Heyder, Aristotelische u. Hegel'sche Dialektik, 1845, i, pp. 181ff.; Bonitz., Aristotle's Metaphysica, ii, 1849, pp. 379, 395, 569; Zeller, Aristotle, Eng. trans., 1897, pp. 373ff. ; Gompertz, Greek Thinkers, iv, 1912, pp. 85f.</page><page sequence="12">12 THE MONIST them by attributing all the confusion to his editor.21 Instead then of demolishing the Platonic structure, Aristotle only remodelled it on the old foundations: he too was still a "realist" but less thorough than his master and less con sistent. In short, in a case of "either-or" he was some thing of a trimmer. No wonder, then, that this difference between the two master minds lingered on for centuries unresolved by the comparatively feeble thinkers who followed them : no won der that Platonists and Aristotelians came alternately to the fore, till at length it was assumed that every man must be one or other : no wonder that the chief gain to philoso phy of ages of scholastic wrangling was only a certain "precision and analytic subtlety" of language which the ancients did not possess.22. Words still masked the face of things with a veil like that of Isis, which-till the modern era-there was scarcely an attempt to uplift. 2. Mathematics. We come now to the influence on phil osophy of the other exact science, that is mathematics. Mathematics is historically the oldest science ; and it is the first that everybody has to learn-hence perhaps its name, commonly attributed to the Pythagoreans. Like logic it is beyond scepticism and beyond cavil : in this respect it is conjoined with logic-science as nothing else is. That it should have influenced the course of philosophy profoundly is therefore not surprising: it has, in fact, done so; and that in two ways. First, in respect of method-of such in fluence the classic instance is that of Spinoza; this, how ever, which we may call its epistemological result, does not for the present concern us. But, secondly, it helped to determine the content, the subject matter of philosophy, 21 Cf. W. Freytag, Die Entwicklung der gie chi sehen Erkenntnistheorie bis Aristotles, 1905, p. 85. 22 A gain, however, that has been generally under-rated. But cf. the mot toes at the beginning of Mill's Logic.</page><page sequence="13">AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY IS notably in the case of Plato. This we may call its ontologi cal result : a remark or two on this seems here in place. As Plato regarded "ideas" of which things are only im perfect semblances-so the Pythagoreans regarded the numbers of the decad and the geometrical forms which they imagined these to imply. The whole sum of things, modelled accordingly to the principles of number, was a cosmos, as Pythagoras is said to have first called it.23 Indeed, the similarity between "ideas" as Socrates had led him to conceive them and "numbers" as conceived by the Pythagoreans it was-some have supposed-that finally led Plato to his so-called realism. At any rate he event ually included the Pythagorean theory within his own. So the two so-called "rational sciences" seem to be enthroned as presenting the essence of all things ; and Hegel's dictum, "all that is real is rational" to have been anticipated. Yet, in fact, the true meaning of reason was thereby only ob scured. But of this later. Meanwhile the important point is this syncretism of Plato and Pythagoras, of logical form and mathematical form, which claimed to be in one respect the last truth of things; as if indeed God, as Plato said, "always geometrizes." So we are led naturally from math ematics to physics, where mathematics is "applied." 3. Physics. Here Plato's Timaeus has an interest for us that is unique ; since, as Grote remarked, it is "the earli est physical theory that has come down to us in the words of its author." Having elsewhere expounded his philoso phy of what always is and has no becoming-the world of ideas or forms-he here attempts to face the problems of the sensible world with all its bewildering multiplicity of 23 His discovery of the mathematical proportions of musical intervals as exhibited in the length of the strings producing them (1:2 for the octave, 2:3 for the fifth, 3:4 for the fourth) revealed the connection between number and harmony, which he boldly generalized and applied in all directions. Regarded in the light of number not only was there a "music of the spheres" beyond our sensibe ken, but the very chaos of sense itself became a cosmos. Shall we with Bacon call this a superstitio crassa; or, reminded of Galileo watching the swinging lamp and Newton the falling apple, shall we call it "a flash of genius" ?</page><page sequence="14">14 THE MONIST transient appearances, where as Heraclitus maintained, all is flux. Certainty is no longer possible, but problems are there none the less. Wie viel Schein, so viel Hindeutung aufs Sein, said Herbart ; and Plato, unable to deny this im plication of being in the phenomenal world, as the Eleatics affected to do, casts about to determine wherein this impli cation or Hindeutung lies. What he required was, so to say, a mediating term between Sein and Schein, the eternal world of ideas (or entia) and the endless diversity of the world of fleeting show (or fientia). With such a clue the Pythagoreans provided him through mathematics. The sensible world was rational just so far as "God had ordered all things in it by measure and number," as Lotze said. There was, however, a still older physical theory that bore considerable resemblance to the theory of Plato's Timaeus, viz., the atomic theory of Democritus, a man whom Plato never mentions and is said to have detested. According to Democritus the world of the naive man is to be explained by the configurations and motions of innum erable, invisible and unchangeable elements variously aggregated or combined in the sensible objects which are all that he actually perceives.24 This Democritean world, though unmistakably implied in Plato's Timaeus was there so smothered by the myths and fanciful conjectures with which it was overlaid that it could never have been taken for genuinely Platonic doctrine, even if Plato himself had treated it quite seriously. In fact, however, he allowed that imaginary world building was at best a pastime ; but one permissible enough when dealing with what after all were only probabilities.25 But the rejection by Democritus of all teleology marked off his philosophy as essentially mechanical, that is as materialistic: whereas the corner stone of all Plato's thinking, the idea of the Good as the 24 These elements or atoms Democritus oddly enough also spoke of as &lt;rxhlxaTa or l at. 25 Cf. Timaeus, 59c. Jowett's Plato ii, 553.</page><page sequence="15">AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY 15 alpha and omega of his cosmos defined his philosophy as through and through spiritualistic in intent. Again, Aris totle's entire rejection of atomism-the chief defect of his physics-and his own strenuous advocacy of teleology, conjoined with Plato's, sufficed to arrest the steady devel opment of mechanical theories till comparatively modern times-to the great detriment of science, it is needless to say.26 Nevertheless, during all this long period Democri tean revivals, so to call them, occurred at irregular inter vals27 till Newton's Principia led back to atomism as one of the problems involved in what he called natural philoso phy. But it was a problem which he himself did nothing to solve. He too was content to deal with the phenomena of nature according to mechanical, i. e., mathematical prin ciples, leaving philosophy strictly so-called entirely aside.28 4. Psychology. The sharp distinction between matter and mind, though now a commonplace, is nevertheless quite a modern acquisition. In the crude anthropomor phism of primitive man, as we have already noted, every thing is animated. At the same time, the etymology of such words as anima, ravella, spirit, clearly shows that mind was regarded as but a subtler form of matter : while objects were personified, subjects were reified. In short, the Cartesian dualism, round which so many of our problems nowadays revolve, was at first unknown. Even for Aristotle, with whom empirical psychology as a science is supposed to have begun, ^vrfj\ answers more nearly to life in a wide sense than to the subjective factor in experience, as now commonly understood. Like the modern biologist, Aristotle contemplates living organisms as advancing from the purely physiological functions of 56 The use of the term physicus, which long prevailed to denote not a physi cist, but a medicus or physician, as we still call one who prescribes "physic," is a curious confirmation of this fact. 27 As chief in this catena Epicurus and Lucretius may be mentioned, and then skipping the darkness of the Middle Ages-Giordano Bruno, Galileo and Descartes. (Cf. Lasswitz, Geschichte der Atomistik, 1890.) 28 Cf. Prin., Bk. III, ir.it.</page><page sequence="16">i6 THE MONIST plants at one extreme to the purely intellectual functions of man at the other. Again he differs from the modern materialist only in the use he makes of his Machtspruch as a German might call it-his famous doctrine of the four causes, that is to say. The term ^v%r\ for him connotes formal, efficient and final, but not material, cause. Insofar as cause implies efficiency, and that surely is its primary meaning, matter is neither a cause nor yet an effect. How what according to Aristotle is in itself so entirely negative, can have any part in the wonderful series of definite trans formations which in his De Anima it is said to undergo, he appears never to have thought of inquiring. However, so long as the organism is concerned-when, that is to say, sense-data are in any way involved, the account given is physiological or rather, strictly speaking, physical. But on reaching intellection as a faculty, Aristotle's definition of tyv%r\ gives out; for intellection, he maintained, has no bodily organ. Soul instead of being the form of the living body becomes something-or perhaps we should say is re placed by something-essentially disparate from the living body. So Aristotle seems to end where Descartes began, but only by traversing the wide gulf between matter and mind. For Plato this rational soul was the real soul and immor tal, its temporary connection with the body being not a help but a hindrance. So he perhaps might, on account of his semi-mythical speculations, be called the father of "rational psychology" ; but that is not science. For empirical psychology, on the other hand, which aims at being scientific, he had, as has been well said, only a step-motherly regard.29 His handling of sense-data and whatever is connected with them is more crudely physical than that of Aristotle, as a reference to Timaeus, where mainly they are dealt with, would suffice to show. 29 Cf. J. I. Beare, Greek Theories of Cognition, 1906, p. 42.</page><page sequence="17">AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY 17 5. Epistemology. As regards physics and psychology, then, the two main divisions of empirical science, we find that little or no progress was made till they succeeded in liberating themselves from the thraldom of philosophy-to the great advantage of themselves and of it. In the wake of this advance the discussion of questions as to the validity and the limits of knowledge, which had long been debated in a more or less inchoate fashion, at length began to take shape as an independent theory of knowledge or epistem ology. This science is often called the propaedeutic of philosophy, since it is now recognized as an indispensable preliminary of philosophy in the stricter sense: the two, however, must obviously be closely connected. IV. THE RELATION OF PHILOSOPHY TO HISTORY History is still frequently and at first was universally regarded as outside the circle of the sciences, and so, as beneath the notice of philosophy. All historical knowledges were merely empirical-confined to "the that" (TO 0x1) but never explaining "the what" (xi axi) or "the why" (810x1) of things. "Aristotle therefore calls his empirical work on animals, History of Animals; Theophrastus, his empirical work on plants, History of Plants; Pliny, his empirical book on nature in general, Natural History/'30 Similarly Bacon regarded history, both natural and civil, as non-scientific, because it pertains to memory and not to reason ;31 and Hobbes, because "such knowledge is but ex perience, or authority, and not ratiocination." 32 Locke and Hume relegated historical knowledge to the region of unphilosophical probability exposed to the devouring tooth of time, from which certain knowledge "depending on the 30 Hamilton, Metaphysics, i. 56. 31 Advancement of Learning, I, i, i-iii, 5. 82 Computation or Logic, i, 8.</page><page sequence="18">i8 THE MONIST agreement or disagreement of ideas" is free.33 Kant too distinguishes historical knowledge as cognito ex datis from rational knowledge as cognitio ex principiis, and Schopen hauer contrasts history, confined to particulars, as ever crawling along on the bare ground of experience, while the genuine sciences, embracing universals, soar above it.3* Finally, Dr. Bosanquet has recently told us that "History is a hybrid form of experience, incapable of any consider able degree of 'being or trueness'."35 On the one side were principles, reasoning and "law"; on the other particulars, conjecture and "chance"; there we could know and predict, here we must wait and can only rarelv foresee. In a word, even when narrating facts and not telling "stories," history was too like the hurly burly that Schopenhauer had called it, to engage the atten tion of philosophers. Not till the eighteenth century was nearing its close do we find a philosophy of History begin ning to take its place beside the long standing philosophies of Nature and of Mind. But once in being the progress of this latter-day philosophy was rapid: by the middle of the nineteenth century the new "historical method" was already invading and transforming all departments of thought; and before the century closed, a very competent observer pronounced "a belief in this method" to be "the most widely and strongly entertained philosophical con viction" of the day.36 "Nature's routine " its perfection viewed statically as a, closed mechanism, has had in fact to yield in importance to the continual "novelty" which the world viewed historically presents. Here it is the open possibilities for development which der Trieb der Perfectibility, the striving for better ment, as Hegel called it, involves, that are being continu 33 Locke, Essay IV, xv. ; Hume, Treatise I, iii, 13. 34 Welt als Wilie u. s. w., Bd., ii, ch. 38. 35 Individuality and Value, 1912, p. 78. 36 Cf.

So far then as the historical extends, not chance indeed but cer tainly contingency, enters into the very heart of things the contingency, that is to say, of the actions of one free agent, relatively to those of others, all alike bent on self conservation and animated by some idea of the Good. Here first we reach the standpoint whence at length we can see that the world has a meaning which we can understand; whereas from the standpoint of a philosophy of Nature alone it has none: only when regarded as subservient to mind does Nature become intelligible. Here then-and this above all, it is important to remember-the entia are not Platonic ideas but living agents, and the fientia are not primarily phenomena, but the actual deeds of such agents. How far this historical domain extends, we have no means of empirically deciding. It remains an open question whether there are any entia devoid all together of that striving which characterizes life. This is one side of the things which philosophy has to consider.
