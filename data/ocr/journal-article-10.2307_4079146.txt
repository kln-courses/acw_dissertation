<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mrs. Govan's 'Wings at my Window.'-What small events may completely change the current of our livesl In this little volume we learn how the sight of a small blithe Chickadee appearing on her piazza rail in the midst of a winter snowstorm brought new courage and inspiration to a disheartened invalid at a crucial time of stress; how the companionship and daily care of the many birds that later came to bird-shelf, feeding boxes and water pans, developed into an absorbing interest and pleasure; how, through forgetting her own discomfort, she overcame physical distress and at length regained normal health; how she became an ardent bird- bander and felt the thrill of welcoming in succeeding years her bird friends with their numbered bracelets; and how at last she was able to establish a permanent sanctuary for birds near her Lexington home. In all this, the author's enthusiasm is contagious; she takes the reader frankly into her confidence, so that we come to know not only her birds but the whole family as well, and like them! Many interesting observations on habits are recounted and there are excellent directions for preparing attractive bird foods. Of course, the 'cold scientist' will criticize the humanizing of the birds and the interpretation of their actions as at times 'anthropomorphic,' nevertheless he will scarcely deny that birds do have</page><page sequence="2">Vol.58] Recent Literature 273 personality. And perhaps one who in the course of a single year strews over six- hundred pounds of special food for the wild-bird visitors she loves, is entitled to regard them with motherly affection. Thus in our more sober pursuit of facts and their meaning, we learn that aesthetic values too are precious and that 'the charm of birds' may prove healing to the soul. In this bright narrative,1 running over with enthusiasm, the author can hardly fail of her purpose-to impart to others, old and young, some measure of her own delight in the observation and companionship of these fellow creatures.-G.
