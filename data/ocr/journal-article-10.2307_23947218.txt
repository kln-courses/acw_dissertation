<plain_text><page sequence="1">465 CHRONICLE OLD TESTAMENT. (1) Lie. Dr G. Diettrich, to whom we are already indebted for three works which throw a good deal of light on the history of the text of the Peshitta, namely, Die Massorah der ostl. urtd westl. Syrer, Eine jakobitischejakobitische Einleitung in den Psalter (1901), and a study of the Nestorian commentator Isho-dad (1902), has now published a very complete Apparatus Apparatus Criticus to the Peshitta version of Isaiah. Five editions, twenty-eight MSS, and the works of Ephraim, Aphraates, and Barhe braeus, have been searched for various readings. The number of important readings thus discovered seems relatively small, but on the other hand the text of the Peshitta Isaiah has now been established beyond any reasonable doubt. The work has been done with a thoroughness which leaves almost nothing to be done by future scholars. It is, however, to be regretted that Dr Diettrich in citing Ephraim and Aphraates has not indicated in what part of their works the various Isaianic quotations are found. On p. 180 1. 15, there is a misprint in the Syriac, and four lines below, where Aphraates is cited, no men tion is made of the fact that the reading of the Father is itself doubtful. But such small blemishes only set off the thoroughness with which the work as a whole has been done. (2) Part II of Dr E. G. King's work, The Psalms in three Collections, was noticed in vol. iv, p. 456 of the Journal. Part III has now appeared. The book is not one which lends itself easily to a critical notice. It is full of beauty and of suggestion. It is scholarly, but with an application of scholarship which is truly its own, and it is devotional with a devotion unlike that of the ordinary devotional commentary. It is a book for those who are willing to think and content to meditate. It is singularly free from the spirit of controversy. The treatment of Pss. civ, cix, cx, and exxxvii is specially fresh and stimulating. (3) Dr Strack's Commentary on Genesis has reached a second edition. The text is given in German with distinction of types to mark the limits of the various documents. The notes are quite brief, but wherever fuller treatment is necessary, e.g. on the Seven Days of Creation, a good VOL. VII. Η h</page><page sequence="2">466 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES excursus is given. The book is brought up to date, even the last edition of of Babel und Bibel, 1905, being used. (4) The Higher Criticism (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) consists of a Church Congress paper by Prof. Kirkpatrick, and of two papers reprinted respectively from the Expositor and from the Interpreter by Prof. Driver. The first urges the claims of criticism upon the clergy and the laity, the third is on the permanent religious value of the Old Testament. A list of books presenting or illustrating the results and the processes of criticism is added. (5) The Titles of the Psalms, by J. W. Thirtle, has reached a second edition (1905) within eighteen months. The author has a theory which throws much light on his subject; in particular he is able to account for the apparently double heading to Psalm lxxxviii, and to bring the difficult Jonath-elem-rechokim at the head of Psalm lvi into connexion with the subject-matter of the preceding Psalm. .The book is spun out, but it is well worthy of attention. (6) An Italian translation of the Psalms with a brief Introduction and short comments by Salvatore Minocchi appears under the title of I Salmi (Roma, 1905). Many of the notes suggest emendation of the Massoretic text, e.g. on xviii 46, xxii 17. The editor has read recent critical works on the Psalms and displays great independence in his own views. On li 6 he writes that the sin against God only must be idolatry. He explains li 16 to mean—Save me from a violent death. The book is interesting. (7) Dr Ottley's Religion of Israel is a companion volume to his Short Short Short History of the Hebrews. The first two chapters are on, ' The primitive religion of the Semites' and 'The work and influence of Moses'; the last two on, 'The final stage in Pre-Christian Judaism' and ' The Consummation in Jesus Christ'. It is advantageous to have so concise a sketch of Old Testament Religion. The length of Smend and Oehler and Schultz adds little to the value of these works. Why does Dr Ottley (p. 112, n. 1) follow a multitude to do evil in accepting so wanton an emendation as הדם for ההרים in Ezek. xviii 11, 15 ? (8) Dr P. Kleinert's Die Profeten Israels in sozialer Beziehung is rather a monograph on the Prophets and their general teaching than what its title suggests. Thus chapters II, III form an introduction to the subject of the Nature of Prophecy. Chapters IV-VII are apparently lectures on Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, and Micah respectively. References both to the Bible and to modern authorities are given at the end of the book. Chapter VIII discusses the Prophetical Law in Deuteronomy. Chapters IX-XI deal with Jeremiah and Ezekiel; the twelfth and last chapter is occupied with Deutero-Isaiah, Haggai and Zechariah, and Malachi. It is certainly very useful to have the social</page><page sequence="3">CHRONICLE 467 teaching of different parts of the Old Testament set forth as that of Deuteronomy is set in chapter VIII. (9) Johannes Herrmann, under the title of Die Idee der Siihtte or EineEine Untersuchung iiber Gebrauch und Bedeutung des Wortes kipper, discusses the Old Testament teaching on Propitiation. After a recapi tulation of the views of Hofmann, Ritschl, Riehm, and Schmoller, the writer in his second chapter presents us with a lexicographer's conspectus of of כפר and its derivatives together with חטאת and אשם. In chapter III each occurrence of כפר is separately considered. Then follows a dis cussion of kipper outside the limits of Ρ and Ezekiel, and then of kipper in Ezekiel and in P. The author's last word is, 'Von besonderem Interesse erscheint mir die Linie, welche vom ursemitischen Heidentum aus zu der Blutverwendung in Ρ fiihrt'. (10) The Guide for the Perplexed by Moses Maimonides. Translated by M. Friedlander, Ph.D. Second edition, revised throughout London, 1904. This is an important work for the history of the interpretation of the Old Testament. Maimonides, who lived in Egypt and composed this book in Arabic, wrote as one who was well acquainted with the philosophies prevalent in Arabic-speaking lands. Like Philo he was sufficiently in sympathy with the best Gentile thought to offer a philo sopher's view of the Old Testament to students of philosophy. A large part of the work is devoted to the discussion of the anthropomorphic terms applied to the Deity in the Bible; Maimonides calls such terms homonyms,homonyms, asserting that they have one meaning when used of men, and another when used of God. Some of these discussions are very interesting, eg. that on י And the tables were the work of God' (Exod. xxxii 16), regarding which Maimonides concludes that ' the writing of the tables was produced in the same manner as the rest of creation' (pp. 98, 99). Very interesting also is the view given of the nature of Prophecy (pp. 219 ff). On the problem of Evil the author says, '[God] only produces existence, and all existence is good; whilst evils are of a negative character, and cannot be acted upon' (p. 266). On the Book of Job Maimonides writes boldly (for his time), ' Its basis is a fiction, conceived for the purpose of explaining the different opinions which people hold on divine Providence' (p. 296). The work, as a whole, is rather prolix, though the author again and again declines to give a full exposition of his meaning on the ground, Verbum satis sapienti. Dr FriedlandeFs translation is easy to read, and useful indices of Biblical, Midrashic, and Talmudic passages are added. (11) Mr Aldis Wright has edited for the Text and Translation Society a Hebrew Commentary on the Book of Job from a MS of the thirteenth fourteenth century preserved in the Cambridge University Library. The author's name was Berechiah, but nothing further is known of him Η h 2</page><page sequence="4">468 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES beyond what may be gathered from the fact that he quotes Ibn Ezra and ' Ibn' Kimkhi, and that he makes some use of French equivalents in giving the meaning of some difficult or rare words. The Commentary js almost purely exegetical. The Redeemer Passage (xix 25 if) is explained without any reference to a Resurrection. The volume is completed with a translation of the Commentary into English from the pen of S. A. Hirsch, Ph.D. The book is a welcome addition to the exegetical literature of the Old Testament. W.
