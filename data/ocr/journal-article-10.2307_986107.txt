<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGION: THE CENTRAL CONCERNS THORTCILD JACOBSEN Professor of Assyriology, Harvard University (Read April 19, 1963, in the Symposium on Cuneiform Studies and the History of Civilization) THE best way to begin a paper entitled "An- cient Mesopotamian Religion: The Central Concerns" is perhaps to say what the words "religion" and "central concerns" were meant to convey. By "religion"-and so also by "ancient Meso- potamian religion"-we would wish to under- stand the human response to a unique type of experience, the one William James called re- ligious experience and Rudolph Otto "numinous" experience. Otto has analyzed it as a confronta- tion with power not of this world, a wholely other, outside of normal experience and in- describable in its terms; terrifying, ranging from sheer demonic dread through awe to sublime majesty; and fascinating with irresistible attrac- tion inviting unconditional allegiance: mysterium tremendum et fascinans.1 I See William James, The Varieties of Religious Experi- ence (New York, 1902); Rudolph Otto, The Idea of the Holy (Oxford, ninth impression, 1943), G. van der Leeuw, La Religion dans son essence et ses manifestations (Paris, 1948), ?110 Religion.

While this experience seems to be essentially one, the human response to it is demonstrably manifold and-since it is human-contingent, and dependent on many factors. As a particu- larly powerful such factor must be counted the urge in man to seek security and salvation in his allegiance with the power. The urge arises out of the inherent uncertainties of the human condition and is so dominant in man that under it his immediate understanding of the power, and of allegiance to it, comes in very considerable measure to reflect his own self, his deepest needs, his most profound fears. It is these most profound fears, conditioning and shaping the religious response, lending it different emphases from age to age, that we would at- tempt to trace for Ancient Mesopotamia.2 YOS.

Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandische Gesell- schaft. 2 It is, of course, in no way our intention to try to reduce religion to fear, or to fear and its counterpart hope; merely to distinguish and try to trace these important components of the human religious response for Ancient Mesopotamia. A more comprehensive statement we have tried to give in "Formative Tendencies in Sumerian Religion," The Bible and the Ancient Near East: Essays in Honour of William Foxwell Albright, edited by G. Ernest Wright (New York, 1961), pp. 267-278. See also our article, "Assyria and Babylonia. Religion," in the 1963 printing of the En- cyclopedia Britannica. As particularly characteristic of the Ancient Mesopotamian response we tend to see its unreflected apprehending of the numinous as will and power in and for the specific situation in which it was experienced to come into being and be. The numinous was thus experienced not as one but as many different powers, form was attributed to these different powers in terms of the different situations in which they were thought to be encountered and human values in the situation, whether good or evil, tended to condition the response as one of allegiance or one of avoidance and defense. It was particularly in this evaluation of situations that the human urge to seek security and salvation became guiding for selective attention and directed primary allegiance toward powers in situations and phenomena recognized as basic for human survival, powers in the basic economies. General presentations of Ancient Mesopotamian Religion may be found, e.g., in E. Dhorme, La Religion assyro- baby7onienne (Paris, 1910), which in many respects is not superseded by the same author's Les Religions de Babylonie PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, VOL. 107, NO. 6, DECEMBER, 1963 473</page><page sequence="2">474 THORKILD JACOBSEN [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. In thus dealing with Ancient Man in his most profoundly contingent and insecure aspect we must needs present a side of him that is not at all that of the self-assured resolute man of action, builder of cities and maker of history, that we know so well from the monuments. Rather, we must try to make our own the lines in "The Waste Land" that say: And I will show you something different from either Your shadow at morning, striding behind you, Or your shadow at evening, rising to meet you; I will show you fear in a handful of dust.

Frankfort et al, The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man (Chicago, 1946; also in Penguin edition as Before Philos- ophy, 1949) and D. 0. Edzard in Wbrterblnh der Mythologie, ed. H. W. Haussig section 1.1. I I.e., Ubaid, Warka, Protoliterate and Early Dynastic I incl. Generally we may say that in attempting to organ- ize the varied materials for Ancient Mesopotamian religion within a meaningful temporal framework we have been guided by the following considerations: (1) The sources available for the earliest periods down to the later parts of Early Dynastic are almost exclusively archaeological in nature, written sources of some substance begin late in Early Dynastic but flow freely only at two points in time, in the Old-Babylonian Period and in the Neo-Assyrian and later periods. We are thus rather unevenly informed and must often have recourse from the less well documented to the relatively fully documented periods for understanding. Such recourse, however, very obviously presents problems of method. (2) Most striking, perhaps, is the case of the earliest periods. Interesting and suggestive as are the materials directly datable to these periods it is quite clear that they do not in fact constitute an autonomous body of evidence interpretable in and of itself; rather, dependence on later evidence is so essential for uniderstanding that if the early materials were left to stand by themselves they would be largely meaningless and incoherent. (3) While recourse to later evidence is thus necessarv for understanding of the earlier materials such recourse must not be had uncritically, for the later materials cannot be considered of a piece but represent a stage of a develop- ing tradition comprising elements directly surviving, ele- ments surviving more or less altered and reinterpreted, and elements that are new developments altogether. Before they can be confidently used they must be carefully analyzed and evaluated, observable differences in basic religious attitude and form must be discerned, internal criterea of relative age considered and the various strata of tradition distinguished as far as possible. Only thus can they be utilized for the interpretation of older data without obvious danger of anachronism. (4) As an important critereon in the evaluation of the later materials we consider the observable difference be- through the fourth millennium, gave to the religious response in Mesopotamia its major direction would seem to have been a simple one: fear of starvation. Early Mesopotamian economy was uniques- tionably a remarkable achievement, able for the first time to provide sufficient food so that large numbers of humans could congregate in cities. But it was also a precarious and uncertain economy, for it was based on artificial irrigation, the most touchy and tricky basis imaginable, nervously reacting to vagaries of nature and man alike.4 Disasters, famine, slow or quick tween "intransitive" and "transitive active" view of the gods. All Ancient Mesopotamian gods appear to be the power in and for some phenomenon, they are gods, e.g., of heaven, of the storm, of the sweet waters, of the moon, of the sun, of birth, of fertility and yield, of reeds, of barley, of beer-making, etc., etc. However, whereas some of them such as, e.g., the god Dumuzid, god of fertility and yields, have intransitive character, are mere will and power for their relevant phenomenon to be, others, such as, e.g., Enlil, god of the storm, transcend the limits of the phe- nomenon with which they are associated in that they will and act beyond it, they are powers broadly active in human life, guiding and shaping human history. For a discussion of these two aspects see "Formative Tendenicies in Sumerian Religion," The Bible and the Ancient Near East, ed. G. Ernest Wright (New York, 1961), p. 268 f. and "Toward the Image of Tammuz." History of Religions (Chicago, 1961) 1, 2: pp. 190-192. (5) As for the relative age of these two views of the divine, it may be confidently assumed that the intransitive view is a general and an old feature, for an unmistakable initransitive core is traceable in all figures of the Sumerian pantheon. The active transitive view, on the other hand, applies less generally and-more important-it is always connected with and expressed under iniherently late anthropomorphic forms borrowed from human society and its human dignitaries. (On the earlier nonanthro- pomorphic stage of visualizing the gods see Falkenstein, Archaische Texte zus Uruk (Leipzig, 1936) and our "Forma- tive Tendencies in Sumerian Religion," p. 269 f.) The specific extension of anthropomorphism with which we are here dealing-politicomorphism-can be dated with a fair amount of probability to the middle of the Early Dynastic Period since the specific form of political institutions assumed for the gods, primitive democracy with general assembly at Nippur and ruler image close to that of primitive monarchy can best be accommodated at that point of time (See our discussion in "Early Political De- velopment in Mesopotamia," Zeitschriftfar Assyriologie 52 (1957); 91-140, esp. pp. 106-109 and 120). It would accordingly appear that materials characterized by transi- tive active character of the gods in politicomorph expres- sion are less suitable for reconstruction and interpretation of evidence from before Early Dynastic than is evidence characterized by an intransitive view and that the overall picture suggested is one of the gods as powers in nature, particularly in its economical aspects, before ca. 3000 B.C.; as powers also in history after that date. 4 See generally Frankfort et al., The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man, pp. 125-128; Robert M. Adams, "Early</page><page sequence="3">VOL. 107, NO. 6, 1963] ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGION 475 death must have been always with those early men.5 And the character of their religion as we know it bears this out. The powers to whom they turned were powers in and behind their primary economics on which life depended: fishing, herding, agriculture, as even the briefest look at the character of the chief gods of their cities will show. Aim and purpose of their cults were to insure the presence of these essential powers for fertility, produce, and food. Houses temples were built for them so that they might dwell with men as members of the human community; rituals, such as the one shown on the Uruk Vase and on numerous roll-seals, cele- Civilizations, Subsistence and Environment" in City Invincible, ed. Carl H. Kraeling and Robert M. Adams (Chicago, 1960); Jacobsen and Adams, "Salt and Silt in Ancient Mesopotamian Agriculture," Science 128, 3334 (1958): 1251-1257, Jacobsen, "Summary of Report by the Diyala Basin Archaeological Project ...," Sumer 14 (1958): 79-89. 5 Many passages in the later literature testify to intimate knowledge of the terrors of prolonged famine when "the daughter sees the mother go in and the mother does not open her door to the daughter; the daughter watches the balances of the mother, the mother watches the balances of the daughter" and-as the famine continues- "they set aside for a meal, they set aside the child for food" (CT XV 49.i.7'-1 2'). The importance of communal storage as a means to counteract the precariousness of the early economy and as a prime factor in the achievement of conditions for perma- nent human settlement has hardly yet received the atten- tion it deserves. It underlies the "temple-economy," which originally most likely embraced not merely a temple or group of temples but the whole community, as it under- lies the later palace economy. Significant are the frequent designations of temples as storehouses (e - u s - g i d - d a arahhu, naspaku, aslukkatu; e - g i - n a - a b - d U7: SU- tummu; g 'a - n u n: ganunu. Note especially the G a - n u n - m a h in Ur with its central cellas and surrounding store-rooms) and as places of division of yields (e - z i k i - s u - p [ e s, ] n a - a m - m u - I u - a - m u: bitu ki- i-i-ni ma-ha-zi sa ni-s'i-ia SBH 31.9 "my good house, my people's place of dividing up the yield" see further ZA 52: 103 note 19 but note that s u - - p e s is better under- stood as "to make the 'hands' three," i.e., to divide (yield) into three parts. The Accadian equivalent s'abasu is conceivably ultimately derived from the Sumerian ex- pression). The many-sided goddess Inannak seems orig- inally to have been the personified power of the store-house (see ZA 52: 108, note 32). In the Gilgamesh Epic she promises to store grain enough to feed the people for seven years to alleviate the famine that releasing the bull of heavenl will cause. The door of the giparu in Eannak at which she awaits her bridegroom Dumuzid is said to be the door of the store-house (e - u -s - g i d - d a TRS 70 rev. 2-3. Cf. ZA 52: 108 note 32). An example of a ruler-a "lord," e n, embodiment of magic powers for fertility- alleviating a famine with stored surplus of grain offers the story of Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta (Kramer, Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta (Philadelphia, 1952)). brated the sacred marriage between the power for fertility and crops, Dumuzid, and the power in the community stores, the goddess Inannak, thus binding the power for fertility to the com- munity in the strong bonds of marriage. We may surmise that other rites, lamenting the absence or the death of the power for fertility, endeavored to bring him back through the magic of human longing and desire. In brief: man felt solidaric with the powers in nature for fer- tility and produce and food, on which he de- pended so utterly, and, feeling solidaric, he did his utmost to help and enhance them, to insure that they would realize themselves, appear tangibly before his eyes in their own desirable mode of being.6 6 See "Formative Tendencies in Sumerian Religion," The Bible and the Ancient Near East . . ., ed. G. Ernest Wright (New York, 1961), p. 271-274 and "Assyria and Babylonia. Religion," Encyclopedia Britannica, 1963 printing. For the cult of Dumuzid and of Inannak see also ZA 52: 108, note 32, Edzart in Worterbuch der Myth- ologie, ed. H. W. Haussig 1, 1: pp. 5t1-53 and 81-89 and our article "Toward the Image of Tammuz" in History of Religions (Chicago, 1961), pp. 189-213. The name Dumuzid (written dD u m u - z i, the final d occurs in writing only when it forms a syllable with a following vowel) is mostly rendered as "the true son" (see, e.g., Edzart, op. cit., p. 51: "rechter Sohn"). In JNES 12 (1953): 166, note 23 we suggested that the element z i (d) most likely represents a factitive nomen agentis from the intransitive stem z i (d) which occurs in the meanings nesu "life," 'vigour," "health" and per- haps napistum "breath of life." We accordingly trans- lated Dumuzid as "he who quickens the youLng ones." A phrase written n a m - d u m u - z i occurs in a hymn to the goddess Manungal in a passage in which that goddess states her capabilities as a midwife but is un- fortunately not conclusive for the interpretation of the name Dumuzid. The passage (SEM 51.ii.4'-5' &amp; 53 obv. 5'-rev. 1' &amp; PBS 1.2 no. 104 rev. 4-5 &amp;3 NT409, 453 and 675) reads: dN in - t u - r a k i nam - d urm u [-z i - ka mu-da-an-gub-be-en] gi-dur ku5-da nam-tar-re[-da KA-sa6-ga-bi mu-zu] "I assist (the goddess of birth) Nintud at the place of child- quickening, I am experienced in (lit. 'I know') cutting the umbilical cord and in saying (only) nice things (because) of (the possible effect of words spoken at that time on) determining (the) fate (of the newborn child)." The translation here given, "place of child-quickening," as- sumes that n a m - d u m u - z i represents n a m - d u m u - z i (d) and refers to the often crucial task of making the newborn infant take its first breath. How- ever, because of the ambiguities of cuneiform orthography, it is just as possible that n a m - -d u m u - z i repre- sents n a m - d u m u - z i (g), which might denote either the "extraction of the child" or the "lifting up of the child" (cf. German "Hebamme"), and so would have nothing to do with the name dD u m u - z i (d) . The name of the goddess Inannak is usually analyzed as a derivation from older n i n - a n . a k and inter- preted "Lady of heaven." The final - k of the name</page><page sequence="4">476 THORKILD JACOBSEN [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. If we wish to gain an impression of what such a religion was like we must turn to survivals of the cult shown on the Uruk Vase, to the con- tinuing worship of the god of fertility and new occurs in writing only when it forms a syllable with a following vowel. In ZA 52: 108, note 34 we proposed a variant rendering: "Lady of the date-clusters" (a nI: sissinnu) and listed evidence in its favor. More recently the name has been discussed by I. J. Gelb in his article "The Name of the Goddess Inniin" in JNES 19 (1960): 72-79. Gelb presents in compact form extensive and varied materials and makes manv important observations. We tend to hesitate, however, in following him in his conclusions that the materials point to a form Innin as the standard form of the name of the goddess, but can here inidicate only a few main lines of ouLr differenit evalua- tion: The materials, we believe, might with advantage be strictly separated according to Sumeriani anid Accadian context and sifted according to whether referenice is to the standard name of the goddess of Uruk, to one of her epithets, or to other deities or entities altogether. If this is done we believe that (1) the older (i.e. Old-Babylonian or earlier) evidence for the reading of the sign-group dMUALANU in Sumerian context points to a reading n i n n a n a (k) . Note especially the syllabic reindering of the personal name written U r - dMUSLANu as u r - n i -in - [n a] - n a in MDP 18: 57 (Gelb 4), the Eme-sal form dG a s a n - a n - n a (Gelb, op. cit., 14), particularly the writings m u - g e - e b NIN- n a - n a (AO 4331+4335 i.2) and [m] u - g e4 -eb NIN-na-na-ke4 (AO 4327) in texts of Isin-Larsa date published by Thureau-Dangin in Cros, Nouvelles Fouilles de Tellohg. For the later loss of the initial n there are good parallels (see ZA 52: 108, note 32). That the name ended in a genitive - a k is indicated by numerous cases in which the final k formed a syllable with a following vowel and where accordingly dMlUSLANU occurs with a phonetic complement - k a or k e4. Incidentally, it may be noted that the consistencv with which the phonetic complement is - k a and - k e4 in older texts, not - n a - k a or - n a - k e4, tends to indi- cate long a before the k so that we should perhaps analyze nin-ana.ak &gt; nin-anak. (2) WVhen the sign muslanu occurs without divine determinative i.e. not as sign for the divine name here discussed, it had apparently also a possible value i n e n (Gelb 4) and a phonetic value n in ( YOS IV 43 seal. Gelb 11). It should also be noted that Sumerian had a separate word i n - n i n / n i n9 which was used as a honorific epithet for various goddesses, also for dMUSLANU. The fact that it was once translated by Accadian irnina "Victoria" (Sumer xiii p. 69.1 see below) suggests perhaps a meaning such as "conqueress." That it is not a phonetical rendering of dMUALANU is clearly shown by the fact that it occurs in Sumerian poetry in parallel with that designation and is listed as an epithet of dMUSLANU in the Old-Babylonian god-list TCL XV 10 1.203 separated by four other epithets from dMUSLANU in lines 197 and 198. (3) The Accadian materials appear to indicate that only the name Ishtar is used to render Sumerian dMUSLANU. Accadian also possesses a number of genuinely Accadian names for originally independent goddesses of war, most of whom later came to be considered aspects of Ishtar so that their names will serve as epithets for her. Such names are 0. Acc. Inin (endingless fi'l of '-n-n) "Skir- life, Dumuzid, under one of his varying aspects.7 We have chosen as an example a section of a lament for the god under the name and aspect of Damu ;8 the god is far away in the Nether mishing" (cf. Gelb, p. 76 and no. 2. The recognition that i-nin represents a divine name is due to him), Anufna (fa'fl of '-n-n with suffix -a) "Skirmish," Anunitum "She of the Skirmish," Irnina (-a form corresponding to irnittu) "Victoria." This name developed by assimilation (see Gelb, p. 78 f.) to Innina. All of these names are good Accadian formations and so not evidence for the reading of the Sumerian name written dMUALANU. We retain, therefore, for the time being the reading of the latter as Inannak. I This is not to say that the earlier phases of Ancient Mesopotamian religious life had not much more variety than the Dumuzid cults by themselves could suggest, probably they did. However, the Dumuzid cults with their focus on the death or disappearance of the god are probably more representative than one would at first think. Features of a similar nature are clearly present in the cult of Enlil at Nippur as shown by the banishment of the god to the Nether World in the myth of Enlil and Ninlil, interesting is also the ritual underlying E - n e - e m - m a - n i i - l u i - l (SBH 44, 43, 77 and 69 cf. also BE 30, 1 no. 8 and CT 42 pl. 28) which seems to center in a successful appeal to Enlil by Inannak for the dead Dumuzid. An old myth about the god Ishkur shows that also this god was thought to have disappeared to the Nether World and had to be rescued (Kramer, The Sumerians (Chicago, 1963), p. 169). The near death of the god Enkik in the Tilmun myth also seems to belong; it may well retain memories of rites connected with the low waters of summer, seen as a weakening of the god's powers. The myth of Inannak's Descent, finally, also seems to root in the complex of the disappearing and dying god. 8 On Damu and his relations to Dumuzid see Edzard, Worterbuch der Mythologie, ed. H. W. Haussig, 1, 1: p. 50 f. and literature there cited; also our article "Toward the Image of Tammuz," History of Religions (1961) 1: p. 202 f. The name Damu means "the child" (see Deimel, Pantheon 687.2). As a power for fertility and new life the god would appear to have been specifically the power in the lifegiving waters as they return in springtime in the rivers, rise in the ground and enter trees and plants as sap, for when in the cult Damu's mother and sister seek him he has died in the trees and rushes and the search moves though a world that has become the Nether World, dry and lifeless. When the god is found and returns, it is from the river that he comes back. The original setting of the Damu cult would seem to have been the essentially horticultural economy of the settlements along the lower Euphrates south of Uruk. Damu's home town is Girsu (Eme-sal Mersi) on the Euphrates and in the litany characteristic of the Damu laments he is identified with a number of neighboring deities-all chtonic in character-such as Ningishzida ("Lord good tree" married to dA - z i - m u - a "Well grown branch") of Gishbanda, Ninazu of Enegir (cf. van Dijk, Sumerische Gotterlieder (Heidelberg, 1960) 2: pp. 57-80), Sataran of Etummal, Alla, lord of the net, of Esagik, etc. Also identified with Damu in the liturgy is every single dead king of the Third Dynasty of Ur and</page><page sequence="5">VOL. 107, NO. 6, 1963] ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGION 477 World and the dry season with its growing threat of death drags on from day to day :' For him of the faraways ... the wailing for (fear) that he may not come,"' many of those of the following dynasty of Isin. For each- as for Damu and the gods identified with him-the litany makes a point of specifying where he "lies," i.e. where his grave is. It would seem, therefore, that we are here in direct continuation of very early concepts of the ruler as a magic source of fertility and able to exert that power from the earth, from his grave after death. The same early concept underlies the cult of the dead e n's for which see Deimel, "Die Listen uiber den Ahnenkult aus der Zeit Lugalandas und Urukaginas," Orientalia 2 (1920), and Penelope Weadock, The Giparu at Ur (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Chicago). Note also the listing of E n - me-e ni-lOu -an-na and En-me-en-gal-an-na with dD u in ii - z i s i b a "Dumuzid the shepherd" as antediluvian kings of Badtibira and of E n - s i b a - z i - a n - n a as antediluvian king of Larak in the Sumerian kinIglist (see AS 12: 71-74). These names occur also as forms of Dumuzid in the god-lists (CT XXIV 9, K 11038, restored by pl. 19.ii) and in the Dumuzid laments (e.g. BE 30: 1, BE 30: 12.ii.14-15, K 5044, unpubl. copy by Geers mentioning dA m - m e - l u - a n - [n a ... ] dAm- me-gal-an-[na][...] dAm-me-siba-[zi-an- n a ... ], CT 42.28 ii.22, and AO 4346 obv. in Cros, Nou- velles Fouilles p. 211 1'-2' A m - m e - [lI 'l - [a n - n a . . A m - m e - g a l - a n - n a ... ). They are most likely names of early rulers, e n's, who embodied Dumuzid in the cultrites and were worshiped as powers for fertility after their death. 9 CT XV 26.1-21 cf. TRS 8.64-75. Particularly helpful is Falkenistein's treatment ZA 47 (1942): 197-200, cf. his comments AOF 16 (1952): 60-65. See also his translation in Falkenstein and von Soden, Sumerische und Akkadische HIymnen und Gebete (Zurich, 1953), pp. 185-186. The passage is preceded in TRS 8 by a praisehymn for Damu and a probably secondary section dealing with a divine sentenice passed upon Uruk (the section may have come from the e n e m m a n i i l u i I u lament, see above note 5). It is followed by sections dealing with the search for the god. His mother asks for him from his nurse with whom she had placed him, probably a tree, moves on in the search to the rushes and finally to the desert. The last part of the composition consists of hymns of praise for Damu as the one who comes out of the river, they have the character of processional hymns. 'Oki-bad-du-ke4 (var. TRS 8 ki-be-da-ke4) i-lu nia- amm-er-ra (var. TRS 8) nam-mir-ra) The line allows of a great manv possible interpretations and a choice between them is not easy. We analyze ki-baddu (.a)k.e "for (.e) him of (.ak) the far- away places" i l nI a (. a) m . e r r . 0 . a "the wail (i l u) that (.a) he (.0) may not (n a.) travel (e r r) hither (. m .)." For e r aldku see Falkenstein, Die NTeusumerische Gerichtsurkunden 3: p. 108. The verb is attested in Eme-sal context also in the meaning "to bring" (wabalu see Deimel SL 232.2) which would furnish "be brought" for "go," "travel." The element n a - we inter- pret as the negative equivalent of h e - assuming that as h e - can denote both "may he" (positive wish) and "he may" (positive possibility) so n a - can denote both "may he niot" (negative wish) and "he may not" (nega- For my child of the faraways ... the wailing for (fear) that he may not come, For my Damu of the faraways ... for my anointed" one of the faraways . . .. From the pure cedar12 where I, the mother, gave birth . . .. tive possibility). An advantage of this interpretation is that it allows n a - to have the same meaning throughout the passage. 11 The term g u d u (UH+ISIB), Accadian pas'su "the anointed one" denotes a class of priests or cult-personnel. It is frequent as a designation of Damu in the Damu texts. Its original connotation is seen most clearly, perhaps, in passages such as utukke limnu'te 5 (CT CVI pl. 12) ii.1 (cf. 4. v. 60 on pl. 11): u h - t u k u (var. t a g - g a)- a - mu-db ia ga-ba-da-an-ses he-me-en "Be you a (man who begged:) 'Plagued with lice as I am (lit. in my lousiness) let me anoint myself with you.'" which show that anointing served specifically as a means to rid oneself of lice; conceivably the oil used contained petroleum or some other effective bituminous ingredient. That this connotation of delousing underlies the term g u d u: pas'su "the anointed one" may be seen from the writing of the word g u d u, UH+ISIB which consists of the sign u h u "louse" (uplu) and the sign i s i b "anointed" (pas'su K 4148.6 CT 11.38) and "clean" (ellu K 4148.3 CT 11.38). Most likely this writing renders an old word u h u - i -s i b "lice-cleansed" which went out of use and was replaced in the language by later g u d u . For such cases of old lost words retained in the writing but replaced in reading by later synonyms see the series D i r i -siiaku- watru. Further indication of the g u d u's concern to keep himself free of infection with lice is probably the stereotype line about the g u d u in laments for a destroyed temple: gudu-bi hi-li-a ba-ra-mu-un-du "its g u d u -priests no longer go about in wigs" (Lament for Ur 1. 348), gudu-bi hi-li-ta ba-ra-e: pa-si-is-su ina ku-uz-bi it-ta-si "its g u d u -priest has left (lit. gone out from) the wig" IV R. 11.33, for they suggest that the g u d u typically kept his head shaved to avoid lice and wore a wig. For personal cleanliness as charac- teristic of the g u d u generally see Gudea Cyl. A XXIX. 5-6 where e'-gudu-k ku a nu--silig-ge-dam "a pure gudu-house never wanting for water" is used as a metaphor and HGT 76. vi gudu -su-sikil-gel8 "like a g u d u clean of hands." The term g u d u: paslsu "the anointed one" would accordingly seem to be in origin a term of personal clean- liness which has been specialized to denote the ritual purity of priests so that "the anointed one" became a term for a class of priests or cult-personnel for whom such personal cleanliness was mandatory. From such special- ized connotation of ritual purity derives presumably also the symbolic use of anointing as a sign of consecration of priests and of sacred rulers in the Old Testament and elsewhere. In the case of the god Damu the use of the term g u d u may be assumed to have essentially its basic connotation of cleanness shading perhaps into sacred purity rather than that of membership in a specific class of priests. 12 For the close connection of Damu with the cedar, note also the following passage CT XV. 27.4-6 where his mother addressing his nurse in her search identifies herself as a cedar: zag- mu gier in-a m gab a- mu gi's u - ur-men5-am e-me-da zag-si-mu gerin-</page><page sequence="6">478 THORKILD JACOBSEN [PROC.

In her distress the mother of the god goes out into the desert to seek her child, and in another hymn we follow her as she is calling and calling for him there. But he is captive in the realms of death and cannot answer her cry :14 I am not one who can answer my mother, who cries for me in the desert, Who makes the cry for me echo in the desert, She will not be answered! I am not the grass-may not come up for her (again) I am not the waters-may not rise for her (again) I am not the grass, sprouting in the desert, I am not the new grass, coming up in the desert.

A partial duplicate is the Harvard text HSM 7527 pub- lished by Edzart in JCS 16 (1962): 80. A further dupli- cate, found in Ur itself, will be published by Gadd and Kramer. We owe the reference to it to Dr. Kramer. To the cult of Damu at Uruk may be assigned, on the other hand, the composition represented by TRS 8 and CT XV pl. 26 f and pl. 30 in which Uruk and Eaniiak seem to play a major role. On the basis of these texts we may visualize the Damu rites in Uruk as consisting of laments for the dead god, a search for him by his mother that takes her to various trees and rushes and into the desert, and then a finding of the god who comes out of the river and is escorted back in triumphal procession. In. Ur the search seems to have continued into the land of the dead where Damu's sister at last finds him. They return together to Ur by boat, probably down the Euphrates. The texts here mentioned appear to represent the Damu cult in its pure form. As the cult spread northwards it seems to have incorporated into its ritual and litany many features of the generally similar cult of Dumuzid the shepherd. To such a blending of Damu and Dumuzid materials testify the preserved versions of the composition Edinna usagga (e d i n - n a u - s a g - g a "In the desert in the early grass") which identify Dumuzid and Damu and contain materials from both cults. This lament-or perhaps better the ritual to which it belongs, lament in the desert for the dead Dumuzid-is first mentioned in economic texts from the period of Ur III (see, e.g., Jean, SA CLXIII. 29 1 udu-u- dNin-i6-par ui-sa- 'se "one grass-fed sheep (for) Ningiparak goilng out to the 'early grass' rite."

THE THIRD MILLENNIUM:17 AND THE SWORD With the coming of the third millennium B.C. a new fear took its place at the center of exist- ence together with the fear of starvation-the fear of war and its ravages. As the settled areas of the country grew and joined, the protection that had been afforded by relative isolation was no longer there and fear of enemy attack, death or slavery, became a part of life ever present in the depth of consciousness. The intensity of the danger and of the fear it engendered can be gauged by the great city-walls that arose around the towns in this period and the staggering amount of labor that must have gone into them. For a shield against danger men looked to the now vitally important insti- tutions of collective security, the great leagues and their officers, and particularly to the new institution of kingship as it took form and grew under the pressures of these years.18 The king, awesome and majestic in his power over men, was alike the defender against outside foes and the righter of wrongs among his people.19 The new concept-opening up, as it did, a possibility of approach to the element of majesty in the divine was early applied to the gods20 and it road to the Nether World-where these officials presum- ably came from-to seek her lost son there. Still not clarified is the relation of Damu to the god or goddess of the same name who was worshiped in Isin and was considered a child of the goddess of Isin, Nin-insinak. Most likely we are here dealing with a quite distinct figure, a divine leach, who was secondarily identified with the southern Damu. A text blending features of the southern cult with elements of the Isin cult offers BE XXX no. 2 (also published PBS 1.1 as no. 5). 17 I.e. Early Dynastic I I, II I, Agade, Gtitium, Ur I II incl. 18 Cf. ZA 52: 112-113 and p. 120. 19SeeZA 52: 110-120. 20 Some of the implications of "applied to the gods" may usefully be spelled out: 1. Role of Metaphor. As Rudolph Otto rightly insists (The Idea of the Holy, Chapter II, "Numen" and the "Numinous," p. 5-7), the numinous eludes apprehension in terms of concepts and cannot be described, only "evoked" in the mind. Concepts taken from general experience, if applied to the numinous, serve therefore essentially this function of "evoking," they are properly metaphors or "ideograms" only. The number of such effective evocative metaphors available to individuals or profoundly influenced the religious outlook. The gods, seen as kings and rulers, were no longer powers in nature only, they became powers in human affairs- in history. As great lords communities is always limited and the more so the more limited the general experience of the individual or com- munity has been. New general experience may therefore lay to hand new concepts which may prove powerful metaphors for evoking the numinous more fully and may direct and deepen religious understanding. As such a new concept, shaped by the political development at the turn of the third millennium B.C. and laying to hand a powerful religious metaphor we consider the concept of the ruler, of the lord and king. II. Specific Applicability. In two ways in particular was this new metaphor capable of extending and deepening the evocation of the numinous: in its suggestiveness of the element of "majestas" and in its suggestiveness of the element of "energy" which are components of "Tremen- dumn" (see Otto's analysis of "Tremendum," op. cit., pp. 12-24, especially pp. 20-23, "majestas," and pp. 23-24 "Energy.") IIA. "Majesty." The experience available in a small homogenous community is not generally con- ducive to the development of attitudes of deep respect and reverence. This must have been so also in the early Mesopotamian communities, and correspondingly feelings of real awe and reverence toward the divine are almost conspicuously lacking in old cults such as that of Dumuzid (see our analysis in "Toward the Image of Tammuz," History of Religions (1961) 1, pp. 207-212). With in- creasing social differentiation of the human community such attitudes of respect and reverence are, however, likely to develop, especially in connection with the growing power, authority, and distance of the ruler, so that the new concept of the ruler can offer for the first time an evocative metaphor or "ideogram" for the element of majesty in the numinous. A striking example is the well- known prayer of Gudea toward the end of the third millennium, utterly different in its divine image from the Dumuzid materials (Cyl. A viii.15-ix.4): "O my master Ningirsuk, lord, (flood-)water angry-red poured forth, Good lord, (seminal) water emitted by the great mountain (Enlil), Hero without challenger, Ningirsuk, I am to build you your house, But I have nothing to go by! Warrior, you have called for "the proper thing" But, son of Enlil, lord Ningirsuk, The heart of the matter I cannot know, Your heart, rising as (rise the waves in) mid-ocean, Crashing down as (does the falling) ushu-tree, Roaring like the waters pouring out (through a breach in a dike), Destroying cities like the flood-wave, Rushing at the enemy country like a storm, O my master, your heart, an outpouring (from a breach in a dike) not to be stemmed, Warrior, your heart, remote (and unapproachable) like the far-off heavens, How can I know it?" We base our interpretation of a - h u 's- g i4 - a as "(flood-)water angry-red poured forth" on a - - g i4 - a sanu "to pour waters out over," "to flood" and naqaru</page><page sequence="8">480 THORKILD JACOBSEN [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. they defended their cities against attack, and through decrees of social reform and covenants with their servant the human king that he would not deliver up the orphan and the widow sa ali "to devastate a town by flooding" (see Deimel, SL 579.287). The enigmatic n i g - d U7 - e "the proper thing," which is a major coficern in the early parts of Cylinder A, was finally successfully produced by Gudea in Cyl. A xxiii.26. The passage shows that "the proper thing" refers to the brick to be used for building the temple, Eninnu. This designation of the brick as the "proper," "befitting" thing can hardly apply otherwise than to a magical affinity with, a "participation" in, the particular essence of the temple and the god, for to know the inner- most core of "the proper thing" (s 'a - b i "its heart" viii.22 referring back to n i g - d U7 - e viii.20) is tanta- mount for Gudea to knowing the innermost core of the god's being ('s a . . . - z u "your heart, . . ." viii.23 re- sumed by s a - z u ix.1 and s a . . . - z u ix.2). Only thus, moreover, will Ningirsuk's answer to Gudea (Cyl. A. ix.7-xii.11) make sense at all, for it consists precisely in the requested authoritative statement of his own nature and the nature of his temples, among them Eninnu. That the brick in fact participated in the essence of Eninnu-and of Ningirsuk-is also signalized by the fact that Gudea stamped it (A. xiii.21-22) with the image of Imdugud, emblem and older form of Ningirsuk himself. The iden- tity of Eninnu with Ningirsuk was specifically revealed in Ningirsuk's answer (Cyl. A. xi.1-4). II. B. "Energy." Essential in the new concept of the ruler as it developed was, furthermore, unique and un- precedented power to act. The ruler embodied in his person the initiative of the community, he was the will energizing and directing it in concerted action. Because of this essential element of energy and action the new ruler-concept was able as a religious metaphor to evoke also the element of "energy" in the numinous, and thus to broaden and deepen further the religious understanding. As we have already mentioned (see above note 3 section (5)) the awareness of the element of "energy," of active transitive character of the divine is, when it goes beyond the particular natural phenomenon with which a god is associated, always connected with and expressed under a politicomorph form borrowed from the human ruler-image in one or other of its aspects. In the application of the metaphor of the ruler to the divine a degree of dynamic tension between metaphoric and everyday reference can hardly have been avoided and hopes for divine help must almost unavoidably have taken direction and color from what was expected of the human ruler: protection against external foes, justice and security within the community. III. Context. For the sake of clarity we have spoken here of the new concept of the ruler as if it were a constant that could be isolated. Actually this is an oversimplifica- tion. The concept of the ruler that proved such a powerful metaphor for the numinous was a concept in the process of evolving in fusion of the types of the "lord" e n, manager with magic powers to make things thrive under his hand, and "king," 1 u g a 1, originally the young leader in war and righter of wrongs internally. Nor was it ever applied in isolation, always in and with the whole political matrix in which it was imbedded. The ruler-metaphor is indis- soluble from a total view of existence, of the cosmos as a state in which the gods form the politically active ruling to the powerful man,2' they maintained justice and righteousness.22 Meeting as needed in as- sembly at Nippur the gods deliberated on human aristocracy. Human allegiance to the numinous and dependence on it is thus guided into channels parallel to those developed for dependence in human society and comes to be understood very largely in similar terms. IV. Point of Growth. As the point of growth of this whole development we may with some plausibility posit the ritual drama of the older periods such as, e.g., the sacred marriage rite of the Dumuzid cult and perhaps the rites of lament of the Damu cult. In these ritual dramas- as we know directly from later texts and by inference from early representations such as that on the Uruk Vase-the leader of the human community the "lord" (e n) became the embodiment of the god, was him and acted as him. Here accordingly, was a theophany in which the numinous was encountered not only in human form but in a human form socially defined and recognizable, that of "lord" (e n) and leader of the community generally. The appropriate- ness of the form of the ruler as a form for the divine, occurring as it did in a dramatically pregnant, recurrent, central and authoritative theophany, could therefore hardly have been questioned. As the form itself around the turn of the third millennium developed a new content of majesty and energy allowing more full and profound understanding of the numinous, and as human attention focussed ever more on hopes for protection and justice which it and the institutions for collective security in which it was embedded held out, the road to the develop- ment we have suggested above was open. 21 The divine initiative responsible for Urukaginak's re- forms is stated as follows in Cone B+C vii.29-viii.13: u4 dN i n - g i r - s u u r - s a g dE n - l i I - 1 a - k e4 U r u - ka-ge-na-ra nam-lugal Laga'saki e - n a - sum-ma-a sa-lu-36000-ta su-ni e-ma- ta-dan5-ba-a nam-tar-ra u4-bi-ta e-'s- gar inim lugal-n i dN i n - g i r - s u - k e4 e - n a - d u1, - g a b a - d a b5 "When NSingirsuk, the warrior of Enlil, had given to Urukagenak the kingship of Lagash and his hand had picked him out from among 36,000 men he set aside the former laws (decrees).

The convenant protecting orphans and widows is men- tioned in Cone B+C xii.24-28 n u - s ifg n u - m a - s u I u' - 'a - t u k u n u - n a - g 'a - g 'a - a dN i n - g i r - s u - da Ur u - ka- ge- na - ke4 i n i m - bi KA e - d a - KES "That he deliver not up the orphan and the widow to the powerful man, this convenant Urukagenak made with Ningirsuk." 22 An interesting aspect of the function of the gods as upholders of law and order is the possibility of seeking legal redress against demons causing disease and other evils which it opened up. The form of the lawsuit in which the god Enkik (Ea), god of the cleansing power of water, undertakes the responsibility for execution of the judgment and sends his messenger (the incantation priest) with the human plaintiff to the lawcourt of the divine judge Utu (Samas), the Sun-god, who hears the complaint and gives judgment in an assembly of gods is a common form in incantations. A following lustration ritual repre- sented Enkik's execution of the judgment. Particularly striking is the use of this form in the bit rimki ritual (see J. Laessoe, Studies on the Assyrian Ritual and Series b't</page><page sequence="9">VOL. 107, NO. 6, 1963] ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGION 481 affairs and shaped history.23 Against the de- cisions of this assembly no single god could prevail and so-for all the relative security the rule of one's own citygod could provide-basi- cally fear could not be stilled. We have the lament of the goddess of Ur, Ningal, when the divine assembly had decreed that Ur should be destroyed :24 rimki, (Copenhagen, 1955), esp. pp. 86-89) where the formal presentation of the case to the divine judge is designated by the term k i - dU t u - k a m "Being at the place of the Sun-god" and has reference to the fact that the lawsuit ritual was performed before the sun at sunrise. The earliest references to this ritual are, as far as we know, mentions in the economic texts of the Third Dynasty of Ur (see Schneider, "Die Gotternamen von Ur III," Analecta Orientalia 19 (Rome, 1939): p. 41-42 no. 41, section 5). In general see The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man p. 206-207. 23 For details of the form which application of the ruler metaphor to the divine took in Mesopotamia and the politicomorph understanding of the cosmos in terms of a state in which it is imbedded see The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man, Chapter V: "Mesopotamia: The Cosmos as a State," pp. 125-201 and cf.

The translation here given is that of The Intellec- tual Adventure of Ancient Man. The following comments may be offered: Line 99. The translation assumes antic- ipatory genitive construction with loss of the genitive mark as frequent in later texts. An alternative interpreta- tion is as conjunctive parataxis: "dread of the storm and its floodlike destruction." h a - m a - 1 a - 1 'a means literally "was verily tied and tied to me." The translation has in view the frequent use of this verb for tying on of burdens but connotations of inability to get rid of something: "cleaved to me," "haunted me" are also possible. Line 100. U4 [TUR] - b i - s e is restored on the basis of line 101. It seems to mean "in the manner of (- S' e) the fewest days" (see for the adverbializing force of - s e Poebel GSG ?389 and cf. ?394-395). Besides the meaning "of a sudden" also "shortly," "soon" might be considered. k i - n a - m i - u - n a - m a means literally "on my couch of night." LUL denotes "false," "illusory." The translation assumes that it here refers to dream-phantasies. Better is, per- haps, a reading 1 i b, Accadian ku7ru (k-r-' cf. Arabic karija "to slumber") which seems to denote a state of losing consciousness as in dozing off or in being completely dazed by grief. In i g i - 1 i b : daldpu "to be sleepless," "to be awake at night" the basic connotation is probably that of weariness of the eyes, drowsiness. Line 101 Dread of the storm's floodlike destruction weighed on me And of a sudden on my couch at night, Upon my couch at night no dreams were granted me, And of a sudden on my couch oblivion, Upon my couch oblivion, was not granted. Because (this) bitter weeping had been destined for my land And I could not, even if I scoured the earth-a cow seeking her calf- Have brought my people back, Because (this) bitter sorrow had been destined for my city, Even if I, birdlike, had stretched my wings And, like a bird, flown to my city, Yet my city would have been destroyed on its foundation Yet Ur would have perished where it lay. Because that day of storm had raised its hand And even had I screamed out loud and cried 'Turn back, 0 day of storm, (turn) to (thy) desert' The breast of that storm would not have been lifted from me. GIA- I [a' - a - b i] n u - 's i-in - g a - m a - n i - i b - t u' m "and (- n - g a -) its (i.e., the couch's tranquility) was not brought me thereon." The translation given above as- sumes that the tranquility (GIA- 1 a: qultu, "deep quiet of the night") of the couch has reference to sound dreamless sleep, oblivion, and that the prefix nus-, which is rendered lu-ma-an AN-TA and u'-ul AN-TA in MSL 6: p. 149.15-16 is here used in the second of these senses, as simple negation. A possible variant translation might be: "And of a sudden on my couch that (- b i) night-stillness (m u - u s - I 'a - a), on my couch that night-stillness, could it but (n u- -s) also (- n - g a -) have been transmitted (lit. 'brought' 'conveyed') to me there." Line 102. b a - m a - a 1 - 1 a - k e4 - e s lit. "because . . . was established for it." For gal/mal: sakanu see Deimel SL 80.22 and 342.860. Lines 103-104. The translation of these lines is uncertain, "scoured the earth" for k i 's u - - a g was a guess from the context and the deletion of n f(?) in line 104 may be too audacious. A better rendering, but also not certain, is perhaps: "even had I-as a cow the calf-tried to help it on the ground (k i - e) I could not have retrieved my land from the mire (i m i (. t a) i m i is wet clay, mire, for the loss of - t a, cf. GSG ?363). For s u - - a g: a-za-ru "to take pity on," "to help," see Deimel SL 354.165 and von Soden AHw sub voce az&amp;ru. The under- lying image would then be that of a cow (the goddess) trying to help its calf (her land) as it sinks deeper and deeper down in wet sticky clay. Line 105. d u - 1 u m would seem to be a loan from Accadian dullum. Line 106. Literally: "even if like a bird of heaven I had beat my wings in the direction toward it." Line 108. h e - e n - g a - m u - d a(!) - g u 1 literally: "would surely also/ yet have been destroyed for (lit. 'from with') me." Line 110.

In all the streets and roadways bodies lay In open fields that used to fill with dancers They lay in heaps The country's blood now filled its holes like metal in a mould Bodies dissolved-like fat left in the sun.

Literally the line reads u n - b i sika-kud-da-nu-me-a bar-ba ba-e-si "its (i.e., Ur's) people who are not potsherds filled its outsides." See AJSL 58 (1941): 223.

The new development has its beginnings in the concept of the "personal god,"27 originally a personification of a man's "luck" and ability to effective thinking and acting, but very early identified with some known figure of the pan- theon, usually a minor deity, who took a specially paternal interest in this particular man and his fortunes. In texts from the beginning of the second millennium, such as the Sumerian com- position "Man and his God" treated by Dr. Kramer,28 the emphasis is still very largely on the basic element of individual effectiveness. The man complains that what he knows does not come out right, what he says quite truthfully turns out to be false, he does things in all inno- cence and finds that he has been duped into committing wrong.29 His god his powers of clear and fast thinking is not there to suggest an answer when friends deceive or impute false- hood to him, or when evil-doers abuse him,30 his 27 For the concept of the personal god see The Intellec- tual Adventure of Ancient Man p. 203-207 and cf.

There is here the beginnings of a search- ing of the heart: the insight gained in the preceding millennium that the divine stands for, and upholds, a moral law is now bearing fruit in a realization of individual human responsibil- ity, but also of innate human inability to live up to that responsibility. In his plight es- tranged from his personal god the penitant may have to seek intercession by higher deities. In an Old Babylonian lamentation to the goddess Ishtar the conidition of the penitent sinner is described :3 not answer them back (for the common contraction of third person dative infix - n e - a - to - n a -, cf., e.g., Sollberger, Corpus, Ent. 45-73 m u - n e - d u', var. mu-ina-d u ; mu-na-du11 var. mu-nie-du11 and Descent of Inannak lines 264 and 265 m u - n a - b a - e - NE "they (tried to) give to them" etc. etc.) (39) you take away my wits." 31 Op. cit., line 98: e n - n a - m e - [s e n - m u n u - tar-re-en ki-mu nu-kin-[k]in-en "How long will you not ask for me, not seek out where I am (lit.

I had no qualms, Ishtar ........ and so on. As the second millennium further explored the question of man's acceptibility before his god the problem of the righteous sufferer led on to realization of man's finiteness and the all- together finite character of his insights and his moral judgments:35 What seems good to one's self, is a crime before the god, What to one's heart seems bad, is good before one's god. Who may comprehend the minds of gods in heaven's depth The thoughts of (those) divine deep waters, who could fathom them? How could mankind, beclouded, comprehend the ways of gods? In this realization that all human values are finite and that yet man is held responsible to absolutes beyond him, Mesopotamian religious thought reaches perhaps its finest insights.36 THE FIRST MILLENNIUM We have considered, thus, three millennia and seen how the human prayer slowly grew from "give us this day our daily bread" to ''preserve us from evil" and lastly "forgive us our trespasses." There is left the first millennium B.C. in which Mesopotamian civiliza- tion drew toward a close without producing any 3Ludlul bel nmeqi.

Yet in the case of Israel the new beginnings were not in all respects new; Israel came into being in a millennium when the concept of a moral universe had been achieved and when men could enter into a covenant of social justice with God as acting in History under which to live collectively and individually in moral responsibility. And one need only leaf through the books of the Old Testament to see and see in detail-how major themes and modes of approach directly continue Mesopotamian themes and approaches-but with a new freshness and with a deeper profun- dity.
