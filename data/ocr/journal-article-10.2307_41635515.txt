WHITTAKER One persistent element of Wittgenstein's philosophical work is his insistence on self-honesty as a condition for doing logical or sense-oriented philosophy. This gives his work a spiritual weight that is not often appreciated. Yet the connection between self-honesty and logical insights is unclear, and this paper attempts to clarify it. The paper includes brief introductions to Wittgenstein's earlier and later thought, along with some religiously relevant examples. The Concept of Mystery and the Value of Philosophy in the Later Wittgenstein , ERIC O. SPRINGSTED Alasdair Maclntyre has urged philosophers of faith to do philosophy in such a way as to address the deeper human concerns underlying philosophy's basic questions. This essay examines where Wittgenstein's later philosophy makes a contribution to that sort of project. It notes the importance of his doctrine of "meaning as use" for thinking philosophically about religion (it is centered in the life-world of religious people). But this article also deals with issues arising from Wittgenstein's view that philosophy should be a sort of conceptual therapy that undoes confusion and leaves everything as it is; this is his defactoism. It argues that there is an underlying sense of value. This changes from the Tractatus to the Philosophical Investigations. In the latter, he ultimately shows a commitment to a philosophical value of openness and willingness to transform one's mind by the discovery of what is given. Wittgenstein on Modernism and the Causal Point of View, RONALD E. HUSTWIT, Wittgenstein expressed an antipathy to modernism from his earliest work to his latest. He connected modernism with modern science and with what he called "the causal point of view." The causal point of view, which * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of the Review.

His analysis of the causal point of view lays bare the uncritically accepted place it holds in our thinking and helps to relieve the anxiety felt over the idea of causal necessity that accompanies it. Wittgenstein's world-view and larger philosophical tasks are often easily lost in the details of his analyses and remarks, but not here, as he unpacks the reasons for his discomfiture with the assumptions of the modern world. The Myth of Cartesian Privacy , H.O. MOUNCE Wittgenstein is often thought to have undermined the view, attributed to Descartes, that the mental is in a special sense private. In fact, this idea of privacy is more plausibly attributed to the empiricists than to Descartes. Indeed, Descartes's own view is not one that can easily be dismissed. In particular, it can serve to correct a tendency among Wittgenstein's followers to treat the mental in behavioristic terms. The point is illustrated by reference to an issue in Christian theology. "It Says What It Says," LARS HERTZBERG The aim of this essay is to point to some of the problems that arise in trying to clarify the distinction frequently made between literal and nonliterai ways of understanding certain religious beliefs, such as the belief in the resurrection of Christ. The disagreement is sometimes taken to concern whether the words used in the expression of belief are to be understood in a literal or a nonliterai sense. It may alternatively be taken to concern whether or not religious utterances are to be understood as factual assertions. This paper argues that, in either case, the application of the relevant distinction to religious expressions is problematic. It suggests that the disagreement should be understood as one of religious attitude rather than of the interpretation of utterances. The Strangeness of An Unmoved Mover : Aquinas , Wittgenstein , and " The Sense of Life," JOHN EDELMAN This essay is a discussion of Aquinas's argument "from motion" to the existence of God as the argument is found in his Summa Contra Gentiles. The aim of the essay is to suggest an approach to Aquinas's argument that emphasizes its particular context, where "context" signifies not so much the assumed Aristotelian physics as Aquinas's larger project of carrying out "the office of a wise man," namely, "to order things." Construing the relevant "ordering" as a making sense of things - indeed of "the whole of things" - the argument from motion is thus seen as part of an attempt to make sense of what, following Aristotle, can be called "the whole of life," that whole within which any one of us must live out his or her particular life. Several ideas found in Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus are introduced in the</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 705 conviction that they may help at least some of us to see the "strangeness" of the conclusion of Aquinas's argument, the conclusion, namely, that the first principle of the whole of being is an "unmoved mover" - the strangeness of which is essential to its significance. The Goodness of God and the Reality of Evil, JOHN KINSEY The later Wittgenstein's approach to philosophical inquiry has influenced a number of philosophers who have reflected on the significance of evil for a Christian view of creation. The strengths and shortcomings of this influence are considered here, with particular attention to the work of D. Z. Phillips. Wittgenstein's legacy emerges as a decidedly mixed blessing. On the one hand, a sensitive analysis of the religious use of language reveals the anthropomorphic confusion inherent in attempts to depict God as acting or as failing to act for morally sufficient reasons. On the other hand, a sharp distinction between the natural and the spiritual domains, and the opposition to metaphysics with which it is associated, obscures rather than assists the search for understanding. By way of contrast, the paper concludes with a discussion of Simone Weil's (profoundly metaphysical) conception of Christ's mediation between creature and Creator, a conception which points the way to a resolution of the intellectual tension to which evil gives rise in the order of creation. Reforging Siegfried's Sword: Wittgenstein andAnscombe, Wagner and Malory , STEPHEN MULHALL This paper examines the significance of Anscombe's decision to substitute the example of Excalibur for that of Nothung in section 39 of the Philosophical Investigations. It argues that the substitution significantly alters the mythological background to Wittgenstein's discussion of naming and its philosophical subliming, in which the Theatetus conception of identity, composition, and decomposition (as exemplified by objects and their possessors) is contrasted with that of Wagner's Ring , for Arthurian legend conceives of these matters differently again. The broader purpose of the paper is to demonstrate that these mythological worlds are not dispensable ornaments to Wittgenstein's philosophical explorations, but rather internal to his way of guiding and reorienting our reflections on proper names, personal identity, and selfhood.</page><page sequence="4">706 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY October 201 1 , Vol. 48, No. 4 The Argument from Self-Creation: A Refutation of Act- Consequentialism and a Defense of Moral Options , ALEX RAJCZI The standard form of act-consequentialism requires us to perform the action with the best consequences; it allows choice only on those rare occasions when several actions produce equally good results. This character- istic conflicts with our ordinary conception of morality. We ordinarily assume we may choose from a range of moral options even though some do not bring about the best possible results. In this battle between act-consequentialism and ordinary morality, act-consequentialism seems to have the upper hand. Options are puzzling - why would morality allow us to make the world a worse place than we could? A major challenge in contemporary ethical theory is to justify options. This essay offers a new argument for moral options and against act-consequentialism. The argument turns on the insight that some valuable things cannot exist unless there are genuine moral options. Specifically, only with options can people engage in the fundamental good of creating decision-procedures for choosing among different life-paths. Agent Causation and Acting for Reasons, REBEKAH L. H. RICE The Agent-Causal Theory of Action claims that an event counts as an action when, and only when, it is caused by an agent. The central difference between the Causal Theory of Action (CTA) and the Agent-Causal view comes down to a disagreement about what sort of item (or items) occupies the left- hand position in the causal relation. For CTA, the left-hand position is occupied by mental items within the agent, typically construed in terms of mental events (e.g., belief7desire pairs or intentions). For the agent-causal theory, it is the agent himself (that is, a substance) that does the causing. Agent-causal theorists generally concede that some intentional actions involve causal relations that are best understood in event-causal terms. Such intentional actions are "nonbasic," meaning that the agent does them by doing something else. But for any "basic" intentional action - behavior that, according to the agent-causal theorist, is caused directly by the agent - there is a causal relation between the agent, on the one hand, and the action, on the other, which is (i) primitive (not permitting of analysis) and (ii) irreducible to any other relation (including, importantly, the event-causal relation).</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 707 The Solo Numero Paradox , ISTVÁN ARANYOSI Leibniz notoriously insisted that no two individuals differ solo numero , that is, by being primitively distinct, without differing in some property. The details of Leibniz's own way of understanding and defending the principle - known as the principle of identity of indiscernibles (henceforth "the Principle") - is a matter of much debate. However, in contemporary meta- physics an equally notorious and discussed issue relates to a case put forward by Black (1952) as a counterexample to any necessary and nontrivial version of the principle. Black asks us to imagine, via one of the fictional characters of his dialogue, a world consisting solely of two completely resembling spheres, in a relational space. The supporter of the principle is then forced to admit that although there are ex hypothesi two objects in that universe, there is no property (except trivial ones), not even relational ones, to distinguish them, and hence the necessary version of the principle is falsified. Theism and Modal Collapse , KLAAS J. KRAAY God is traditionally taken to be a necessarily existing being who is unsurpassably powerful, knowledgeable, and good. The familiar problem of actual evil claims that the presence of gratuitous suffering in the actual world constitutes evidence against the existence of such a being. In contrast, the problem of possible evil claims that the possibility of bad worlds constitutes evidence against theism. How? It seems plausible to suppose that there are very bad possible worlds. But if God exists in every world, then God exists in those, too. And if God exists in very bad worlds, some say, God is culpable for not ensuring that they are better. This article considers this argument, surveys some responses, and offers a novel solution. Along the way, it argues that theists should maintain that the actual world is a multiverse featuring all and only universes worthy of being created and sustained by God, and - more controversially - it recommends that theists embrace modal collapse: the claim that this multiverse is the only possible world. Theoretic Identities as Explanatia and Explananda , KEVIN MORRIS The mind-brain identity theory, the thesis that sensations are identical with properties or processes of the brain, was introduced into contemporary discussion by U. T. Place, Herbert Feigl, and J. J. C. Smart in the 1950s. Despite its widespread rejection in the following decades, the identity theory has received several carefully articulated defenses in recent years. Aside from developing novel responses to well-known arguments against the identity theory, contemporary identity theorists have argued that the epistemological resources available to support the adoption of identities are more plentiful than has often been supposed; further, they have argued that mind-brain identities allow for the resolution of otherwise intractable explanatory puzzles about the phenomenal properties of experience.</page><page sequence="6">708 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS How Much Effort Can We Make? DAVID ALM As is well known, Rawls and his followers have argued that a person cannot justify a disproportionate share of social resources he is able to secure in the market by claiming that he deserves that share. There has been some controversy about why exactly Rawls, at least, thought his position to be the case, but this article focuses on just one factor that does seem to carry some weight with Rawlsians. This is that a person cannot deserve to have more money or other social goods than others if those competitive advantages of his that enable him to get more are not themselves deserved. If he has more, unfairness results. For example, someone could end up with more than others because he has more of some talent that happens to be much in demand. Yet this talent itself is likely to be inborn or else the result of early training, for which the person himself can take no credit. Even if he has developed the talent later in life, the aptitude and perseverance needed even to accomplish that feat is equally a prize in the "natural lottery." But what about effort? What Lies behind Misspeaking , ROY SORENSEN What distinguishes misspeaking from lying? Not the intent to deceive. For that often causes a slip of the tongue: "Officer, I always stop when the traffic light turns green!" Sincerity is the real difference. If the asserter connects his speech to his belief-forming processes, then he is sincere. Opening this channel may result in garbled transmission - and criticism for misarticulation. To be guilty of lying, however, the speaker must connect his speech to a process governing other attitudes such as supposition. This is why correlating eye movements with mental processes (remembering versus imagining) is thought to assist lie detection. Sincerity is a matter of connecting a speech act with the processes governing its corresponding propositional attitude. Since the connection is to the process, not the deep attitude itself, the standard of sincerity is surprisingly low. AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY January 201 2, Vol. 49, No. 1 The Monotonicity of 'No' and the No-Proposition View , BRADLEY ARMOUR-GARB This article reveals a tension between a fairly standard response to "liar sentences," of which "'(L) Sentence (L)' is not true" is an instance, and some features of our natural language determiners (for example, "every," "some," "no," and so forth) that have been established by formal linguists. The fairly standard response to liar sentences, which has been voiced by a number of</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 709 philosophers who work directly on the Liar paradox, but can also be heard from philosophers who do not work directly on that paradox, is that liar sentences do not express propositions. Call this the "No Proposition View." Evidently, the belief that liar sentences do not express propositions is a deeply held intuition. As the previously mentioned tension will reveal, there is reason to worry about whether this deeply held intuition can be sustained. Recent Work on Testimonial Knowledge , JOHN GRECO Recent interest in the epistemology of testimony can be traced to C. A. J. Coady's Testimony: A Philosophical Study (1992) and then a collection of papers edited by Bimal Krishna Matilal and Arindam Chakrabarti, Knowing from Words (1994). These two volumes framed several issues in the epistemology of testimony and largely set the agenda for work in that area over the next two decades. One major issue in this literature is whether testimonial knowledge can be "reduced" to some other kind of knowledge: Is testimonial knowledge sui generis , requiring its own distinctive treatment, or is testimonial knowledge merely an instance of, for example, inductive knowledge, requiring no special epistemology over and above that required for inductive knowledge in general? One way that testimonial knowledge might be special is that it involves social elements that make it distinctive. This possibility raises further issues that have been prominent in the literature: In what ways is testimonial knowledge a social phenomenon, and what are the consequences of this for the epistemology of testimony and for epistemology more generally? Nonreductive Physicalism and the Problem of Strong Closure , SOPHIE GIBB Closure is the central premise in one of the best arguments for physicalism - the argument from causal overdetermination. According to Closure, at every time at which a physical event has a sufficient cause, it has a sufficient physical cause. This principle is standardly defended by appealing to the fact that it enjoys empirical support from numerous confirming cases (and no discontinuing cases) in physics. However, in recent literature on mental causation, attempts have been made to provide a stronger argument for it. This essay argues that, insofar as these attempts are successful, they actually establish a far stronger closure principle. Worryingly, the acceptance of this stronger principle presents a new problem for the most popular form of physicalism, that of nonreductive physicalism. The problem shall be referred to as the "Problem of Strong Closure." Recipes for Moral Paradox, ANDREW SNEDDON Paradoxes play famous roles in philosophy. Mark Sainsbury's well- known definition is that a paradox is "an apparently unacceptable conclusion derived by apparently acceptable reasoning from apparently acceptable</page><page sequence="8">71 0 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS premises." Michael Clark has argued that some important paradoxes do not fit this model, and that hence we should have a more ecumenical notion of paradox. Either way, the philosophical import of paradoxes is clear. Saul Smilansky notes that, despite the famous role of paradoxes in philosophy, very few moral paradoxes have been developed and assessed. Smilansky's point is particularly apt if we concentrate on paradoxes about values or moral reasons. Some paradoxes that have been examined by ethicists concern neither, at least in certain formulations. For instance, the toxin paradox and paradoxes of deterrence have interested ethicists, but their subject matter is philosophical psychology: by invoking scenarios in which agents will not later want to do something that they now have reason to intend to do, these paradoxes probe questions of the nature of and relations between intention, desire, and knowledge. Smilansky offers ten moral paradoxes to fill this gap. However, Smilansky's general observation is well-taken: despite his efforts, ethicists have not examined very many moral paradoxes. Propositional Gratitude , SEAN MCALEER A striking feature of recent philosophical writing on gratitude is the disagreement that characterizes it: Saul Smilansky argues that I should be grateful to you for not harming me, while Patrick Fitzgerald argues that I often should be grateful to you for harming me; Christopher Wellman argues that gratitude is a virtue rather than a duty, while Claudia Card believes that it is a duty; Roslyn Weiss argues that gratitude is neither a matter of justice nor an imperfect duty, while Aquinas - okay, not very recent - takes gratitude to be part of justice. Despite this disagreement, contemporary authors - with one notable exception - share a pronounced topical preference for targeted gratitude (A's being grateful to B for x) over propositional gratitude (As being grateful that p), treating the latter as a poor, less interesting cousin of the former. Perhaps propositional gratitude gets short shrift because of the centrality of targeted gratitude to accounts of political obligation, a tradition stretching back at least to Plato's Crito . Or perhaps discussions of targeted gratitude, with their emphases on when gratitude is owed and what is owed, dominate because so many philosophers see questions of moral requirement or duty as the primary ethical questions. Or perhaps it is due to a more general tendency - still prevalent despite the inroads virtue ethics has made in recent decades - to construe ethics as primarily about doing rather than being. Or perhaps it is some combination of these and other factors. The Importance of Self-Forgiveness, BYRON WILLISTON In the climactic scene of Arthur Miller's The Crucible , John Proctor, accused of consorting with Satan, is negotiating for his life with Danforth, Salem's deputy governor. Danforth would have Proctor confess immediately or face execution. In the course of defending himself, Proctor has been forced to admit publicly to an adulterous liaison with Abigail, one of the young girls claiming to be demonically possessed. Proctor is weighed down by self-reproach and self-loathing for having betrayed his wife Elizabeth, as</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 71 1 well as by the prospect of lying to Danforth to save his own skin. In the end he refuses to confess and goes to his death. But before making this decision, he asks Elizabeth to forgive him. She replies, "John, it should come to naught that I should forgive you, if you'll not forgive yourself." As he is being led to the gallows, Elizabeth recognizes that John has been shamed in the course of these trials and their revelations, but claims that through this process he has reclaimed "his goodness." Expressivism and Dispositional Desires , CAJ STRANDBERG According to a persistent objection against metaethical expressivism, this view is committed to a strong version of internalism that is unable to account for cases where a person's moral judgment and motivation come apart. Recently, leading expressivists have argued that they can meet this objection by maintaining that moral judgments consist in noncognitive states that motivate in normal conditions. This article argues that an important dimension of internalism has, on the whole, gone unnoticed: internalist claims vary depending on whether moral judgments and motivation are understood as dispositional states or occurrent states. This variation can be invoked in an argument showing that expressivists are indeed committed to versions of internalism that make it impossible to account for cases in which moral judgment and motivation diverge. AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY March 2012, Vol. 90, No. 1 Against Credibility , JOSEPH SHIEBER How does the monitoring of a testifier's credibility by recipients of testimony bear upon the epistemic license accruing to a recipient's belief in the testifier's communications? According to an intuitive and philosophically influential conception, licensed acceptance of testimony requires that recipients of testimony monitor testifiers with respect to their credibility. However this article argues that this conception proves to be untenable when confronted with the wealth of empirical evidence bearing on the ways in which testifiers and their interlocutors actually interact.</page><page sequence="10">71 2 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS A Deflationary Theory of Diachronie Identity , ALEXANDER R. PRUSS Substantive theories of diachronic identity have been offered for different kinds of entities. The kind of entity whose diachronic identity has received the most attention in the literature is person, where such theories as the psychological theory, the body theory, the soul theory, and animalism have been defended. At the same time, Wittgenstein's remark that "to say of two things that they are identical is nonsense, and to say of one thing that it is identical with itself is to say nothing at all" suggests that the idea of further analyzing identity is mistaken at root. This article offers a simple, deflationary theory that reduces diachronic identity to quantification, synchronic identity and existence at a spacetime location (or at a time, for nonspatial entities). On logical grounds, the theory is guaranteed to have no counterexamples. Because the theoiy is guaranteed to have no counter- examples, all the imaginative examples offered as intuitive support for theories of personal identity are going to be either incorrect or compatible with the theory. The author argues that the deflationary theory is preferable on simplicity grounds to typical substantive theories, and that various problems that are commonly thought to concern diachronic identity are better seen as about something else. Darkness Visible? BRIGGS WRIGHT In the philosophy of perception, typically, everything is illuminated. Discussions of perceptual experience primarily focus on subjects situated in illuminated environs. Rarely do we see treatment of putative perceptual experience involving darkness. In this paper, the author carefully canvasses and characterizes the nature of experiences of darkness, marking a substantive distinction between two such kinds of experiences. Crucially, he gives an account of the distinctive phenomenology of experiences of darkness, and shows that neither of the two broad kinds of experiences of darkness requires, as Roy Sorensen has recently suggested, the reiflcation of unfamiliar entities to serve as objects of perceptual awareness. The author also offers potential candidates for the proper representational contents of experiences of darkness. This exploration not only reveals that such experiences pose no threat to a view like representationaiism, but also demonstrates how experiences of darkness can be given their rightful place in a naturalistic theory of perceptual awareness. At last, darkness will be brought out from the shadows. Colour Discrimination and Monitoring Theories of Consciousness , RENÉ JAGNOW According to the monitoring theory of consciousness, a mental state is conscious in virtue of being represented in the right way by a monitoring state. David Rosenthal, William Lycan, and Uriah Kriegel have developed three different influential versions of this theory. In order to explain color experiences, each of these authors combines his version of the monitoring</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 71 3 theory of consciousness with a specific account of color representation. Even though Rosenthal, Lycan, and Kriegel disagree on the specifics, they all hold that colors are represented by a single type of mental state. The main goal of this paper is to show that a more complex account of color representation is needed for the monitoring theory of consciousness to do justice to the phenomenology of color experiences. In particular, the article argues that the fine-grained character of color experience - that is, the fact that perceivers can become conscious of small differences between colors - requires that color representation be construed in terms of two different types of mental states, namely, sensory states that represent appearance properties and color representations that represent physical colors. Cartesian Functional Analysis , DEBORAH J. BROWN Despite eschewing the utility of ends or purposes in natural philosophy, Descartes frequently engages in functional explanation, which many have assumed is an essentially teleologica! form of explanation. This article considers the consistency of Descartes's appeal to natural functions, advancing the idea that he is utilizing a nonnormative, nonteleological form of functional explanation. It will be argued that Cartesian functional analysis resembles modern causal functional analysis, and yet, by emphasizing the interdependency of parts of biological systems, is able to avoid many of the problems attendant upon modern causal theories. It is for this reason, if no other, that the study of Descartes's natural philosophy should be of interest to contemporary theorists of functional analysis. Identifying Goodness , CHARLES R. PIGDEN This paper reconstructs Moore's Open Question Argument (OQA) and discusses its rise and fall. There are three basic objections to the OQA: Geach's point, that Moore presupposes that "good" is a predicative adjective (whereas it is in fact attributive); Lewy's point, that it leads straight to the Paradox of Analysis; and Durranťs point that even if "good" is not synonymous with any naturalistic predicate, goodness might be synthetically identical with a naturalistic property. As against Geach, the paper argues that "good" has both predicative and attributive uses and that in moral contexts, it is difficult to give a naturalistic account of the attributive "good." To deal with Lewy, the author reformulates the OQA. But the bulk of the paper is devoted to Durranťs objection. It argues that the post-Moorean program of looking for synthetic identities between moral and naturalistic properties is either redundant or impossible. For it can be carried through only if "good" expresses an empirical concept, in which case it is redundant since naturalism is true. But "good" does not express an empirical concept (a point proved by the reformulated OQA). Hence synthetic naturalism is impossible. The author discusses direct reference as a possible way out for the synthetic naturalist and concludes that it will not work. The OQA may be a bit battered, but it works after a fashion.</page><page sequence="12">71 4 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Against Normative Naturalism , MATTHEW S. BEDKE This paper considers normative naturalism, understood as the view that (i) normative sentences are descriptive of the way things are, and (ii) their truth/falsity does not require ontology beyond the ontology of the natural world. Assuming (i) for the sake of argument, the author here shows that (ii) is false, not only as applied to ethics, but more generally as applied to practical and epistemic normativity across the board. The argument is a descendant of Moore's Open Question Argument and Hume's Is-Ought Gap. It goes roughly as follows: to ensure that natural ontology suffices for normative truth, there must be semantically grounded entailments from the natural truths to the normative truths. There are none. Thus, natural ontology does not suffice for normative truth. Incompatibilism and Personal Relationships: Another Look at Strawson' s Objective Attitude, SETH SHABO In the context of his highly influential defense of compatibilism, P. F. Strawson introduced the terms "reactive attitude" and "objective attitude" to the free-will lexicon. He argued, in effect, that relinquishing such reactive attitudes as resentment and moral indignation isn't a real possibility for us, since doing so would commit us to exclusive objectivity, a stance incompatible with ordinary interpersonal relationships. While most commentators have challenged Strawson's link between personal relationships and the reactive attitudes, Tamler Sommers has taken up Strawson's claim that exclusive objectivity would preclude meaningful relationships. The author here sets out a defense of this claim by identifying a kind of interpersonal caring that is plausibly both required for such relationships and excluded by the objective attitude. He then argues that this defense helps to support Strawson's more controversial claim about personal relationships and the reactive attitudes. Liberalism , Religion and Integrity , KEVIN VALUER It is a commonplace that liberalism and religious belief conflict. Liberalism, its proponents and critics maintain, requires the privatization of religious belief, since liberals often argue that citizens of faith must repress their fundamental commitments when participating in public life. Critics of liberalism complain that privatization is objectionable because it requires citizens of faith to violate their integrity. The liberal political tradition has always sought to carve out social space for individuals to live by their own lights. If liberalism requires citizens to violate their integrity, liberals have cause for concern. The author here seeks to rebut this integrity objection to liberalism. He focuses on the dominant form of philosophical liberalism: public reason liberalism. He argues that the integrity objection undermines the mainstream conception of public reason liberalism, but not public reason liberalism itself. The paper opens by outlining the structure of public reason liberalism and the integrity objection. It then analyzes two versions of the objection and argues that the second version is successful against the</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 71 5 mainstream conception of public reason. The author argues in response that public reason liberalism need not endorse principles of restraint - the civic restrictions on religious expression typically associated with it. He then sketches a conception of public reason liberalism that eschews principles of restraint. This alternative promises to reconcile public reason liberals and their faith-friendly critics by putting the integrity objection to rest. Varieties of Disagreement and Predicates of Taste, TORFINN THOMESEN HUVENES Predicates of taste, such as "fun" and "tasty," have received considerable attention in recent debates between contextualists and relativists, with considerations involving disagreement playing a central role. Considerations involving disagreement have been taken to present a problem for contextualist treatments of predicates of taste. The goal of this paper is to argue that considerations involving disagreement do not undermine contextualism. To the extent that relativism was supposed to be motivated by contextualists being unable to deal with disagreement, this motivation is lacking. The argument against contextualism rests on a too simple and narrow conception of disagreement that turns out to be problematic once we consider a wider range of cases. If we reject the assumptions about disagreement that the argument rests on, it no longer poses a threat to contextualism. EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY December 201 1 , Vol. 19, No. 4 The Relationist and Substantivalist Theories of Time : Foes or Friends? JIRI BENOVSKY There are two traditionally rival views about the nature of time: substantivalism that takes time to be a substance that exists independently of events located in it, and relationism that takes time to be constructed out of events. In this paper, first, the author examines the strategies the two views use to face the possibilities of "empty time" and "time without change." The article goes on to show that two allegedly very different rival views are much less different than has been thought: their structure is extremely similar, their strategies are extremely similar, and they can both face the possibilities of empty time and time without change in the same way. Thus, the author argues in favor of a certain kind of equivalence between the two views; he discusses a Strong and a Weak version of this claim; and he provides reasons for endorsing the former. He also discusses the parallel between this pair of views about the nature of time and another analogous pair of views: the</page><page sequence="14">71 6 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS bundle theory and the substratum theory about the nature of material objects, with respect to the problem with Identity of Indiscernibles. - Correspondence to: jiri@benovsky.com Kant, Reichenbach, and the Fate of A Priori Principles, KARIN DE BOER This article contends that the relation of early logical empiricism to Kant was more complex than is often assumed. It argues that Reichenbach's early work on Kant and Einstein, entitled The Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge, aimed to transform rather than to oppose Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. On the one hand, the author argues that Reichenbach's conception of coordinating principles, derived from Kant's conception of synthetic a priori principles, offers a valuable way of accounting for the historicity of scientific paradigms. On the other hand, the article shows that even Reichenbach, in line with Neo-Kantianism, associated Kant's view of synthetic a priori principles too closely with Newtonian physics and, consequently, overestimated the difference between Kant's philosophy and his own. This is even more so, the author points out, in the retrospective account logical empiricism presented of its own history. Whereas contemporary reconstructions of this history, including Michael Friedman's, tend to endorse this account, this paper offers an interpretation of Kant's conception of a priori principles that contrasts with the one put forward by both Neo- Kantianism and logical empiricism. On this basis, the author reexamines the early Reichenbach's effort to accommodate these principles to the paradigm forged by Einstein. - Correspondence to: karindeboer@cs.com The French Revolution and the New School of Europe: Towards a Political Interpretation of German Idealism, MICHAEL MORRIS This paper considers the significant but generally overlooked role that the French Revolution played in the development of German Idealism. Specifically, it argues that Reinhold and Fichte's engagement in revolutionary political debates directly shaped their interpretation of Kant's philosophy, leading them (a) to overlook his reliance upon common sense, (b) to misconstrue his conception of the relationship between philosophical theory and received cognitive practice, (c) to fail to appreciate the fundamentally regressive nature of his transcendental argumentative strategy, and, ultimately, (d) to seek to deduce his philosophy from a single first-principle, one grounded in the immediate awareness of the subject's mental life. - Correspondence to: Michael.morris@uni-jena.de Toward an Ecological Theory of the Norms of Practical Deliberation, JENNIFER M. MORTON Practical deliberation is deliberation concerning what to do governed by norms of intention (for example means-end coherence and consistency), which are taken to be a mark of rational deliberation. According to the theory</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 71 7 of practical deliberation developed in this paper, we should think of the norms of rational practical deliberation ecologically: that is, the norms that constitute rational practical deliberation depend on the complex interaction between the psychological capacities of the agent in question and the agent's environment. It is argued that this view does a better job of justifying particular norms for practical deliberation than intrinsic or constitutivist theories. Finally, the author argues against the Myth Theory of deliberation, which takes there to be no such norms on deliberation. - Correspondence to: jmorton 1 @s warthmore. edu Thought's Social Nature , CHARLES TRAVIS Wittgenstein, throughout his career, was deeply Fregean. Frege thought of thought as essentially social, in this sense: whatever I can think is what others could think, deny, debate, investigate. Such, for him, was one central part of judgment's objectivity. Another was that truths are discovered, not invented: what is true is so, whether recognized as such or not. Later, Wittgenstein developed Frege's idea of thought as social compatibly with that second part. In this he exploited some further Fregean ideas: of a certain generality intrinsic to a thought; of lack of that generality in that which a thought represents as instancing some such generality. Seeing Wittgenstein as thus building on Frege helps clarify - inter alia - his worries in the Blue Book and the Investigations about meaning, intending, and understanding, and the point of the rule following discussion. - Correspondence to: c.s.travis@gmail.com Leave Truth Alone: On Deflationism and Contextualism , DANIEL WHITING According to deflationism, grasp of the concept of truth consists in nothing more than a disposition to accept a priori (nonparadoxical) instances of the schema: (DS) It is true that p if and only if p. According to contextualism, the same expression with the same meaning might, on different occasions of use, express different propositions bearing different truth-conditions (where this does not result from indexicality and the like). On this view, what is expressed in an utterance depends in a nonnegligible way on the circumstances. Charles Travis claims that contextualism shows that "deflationism is a mistake," that truth is a more substantive notion than deflationism allows. This paper examines Travis's arguments in support of this "inflationary" claim and argues that they are unsuccessful. - Correspondence to: d.whiting@soton.ac.uk</page><page sequence="16">71 8 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY 201 1 , Vol. 51 , No. 4 Against Superkitten Ethics , PHILIP E. DEVINE The author here criticizes the use of science-fiction examples in ethics, chiefly, though not solely, by defenders of abortion. We have no reliable intuitions concerning such examples - certainly nothing strong enough to set against the strong intuition that infanticide is virtually always wrong. Re-tracing the Five Famous Ways of Summa Theologiae 1.2.3 , LAWRENCE MOONAN Aquinas's Five Ways are not to be understood as demonstrative proofs, successful or not, for the existence of God. Rather, they provide a necessary step towards supplying licensable surrogates for the essential predications that cannot logically be drawn from the incomprehensible nature of God, yet would seem needed for the Summa" s declared genre of argued theology. (Predication secundum analogiam provides surrogates for nonrelational accidental predications, likewise unavailable.) What Aquinas is proving in arguing deum esse in ST 1.2.3 is not God's actual existence (see ST 1.3.4 ad 2) but an alternative interpretation of "God's being something" where "God is something" is a placeholder for, say, "God is prime mover" or, more explicitly, for such (necessary) identities as "The prime mover is the necessitated necessitator," an identity whose necessity depends at more than one place on the assumption of God's existence from faith, not on demonstrative proof of Goďs existence. Re-examining Recollection , JOE MCCOY The doctrine of recollection is one of the most controversial in the Platonic corpus, and much scholarship has been aimed at altering the doctrine to resolve its paradoxical features. Many of these features are generated by a failure to appreciate the difference between memory (mneme) and the distinct capacity of recollection (anamnesis). In several of the Platonic dialogues, Socrates gives an account of how recollection functions in ordinary contexts, and thus provides a basis for showing how anamnesis may be employed to describe learning in general. The mystery of learning consists in the fact that one must possess some knowledge of the matter being investigated prior to learning about it, and thus learning may be aptly described as a remembrance of some knowledge previously forgotten. This paper argues that the recollection account was formulated, not to resolve this mystery, but rather to capture descriptively its essential features.</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 71 9 The Fall , RAYMOND D. BOISVERT This essay reads Camus' novel The Fall as a reductio ad absurdum for two major strands in Western intellectual culture: the hyper-Augustinian "we are all depraved" strand and, more decisively, what the author calls the "hyper-Sartrean" strand of existentialist humanism. Many commentators have identified Sartre as a target of Camus's novel, but a detailed exploration of the critique is rarely undertaken. Examining Sartre's "Existentialism is a Human- ism" reveals an understanding of the human condition as involving a double disconnection: from nature and from other people. Camus' protagonist is just such a doubly detached individual. With little subtlety, Camus depicts his protagonist as "Satanic," that is, the fallen one, the universal accuser, the friend of destruction, and the enemy of connection. Such a "Fall" into self- isolation represents the all too alluring temptation against which Camus wishes to warn us. Siger of Brabant on Divine Providence and the Indeterminacy of Chance , ANDREW LAZELLA The compatibility of divine providence with the contingency of human freedom is widely-debated within medieval thought. Following recent works on the Islamic philosopher Averroes, this essay expands the issue of causal indeterminism to include the less disputed question of contingency in the larger framework of chance. In tradition of Latin Averroism, Siger of Brabant provides a unique and heterodox perspective on the compatibility of chance with providence. Unlike his fellow scholastics who attempt to preserve contingency under the watchful gaze of divine providence, Siger rejects such moves as destructive of contingency. He instead argues for restrictions on the determination of such events by the arche of divine providence, thus leaving them anarchic with respect to its order but capable of introducing new beginnings in the otherwise closed universe of causes. Stoicism as Anesthesia , MATTHEW D. WALZ Boethius first identifies Philosophy in the Consolation as his medica , his "healer" or "physician." Over the course of the dialogue Philosophy exercises her medical art systematically. In the second book, Philosophy first gives Boethius "gentler remedies" that are preparatory for the "sharper medicines" that she administers later. This article shows that, philosophically speaking, Philosophy's "gentler remedies" amount to persuading Boethius toward Stoicism, which functions as an anesthetic for the more invasive philosophical surgery that she performs afterwards. Seeing this, however, requires understanding how Philosophy draws out Boethius's spiritedness in the first book and how in the second book she sublimates it into an intellectual and volitional apathy toward the things of fortune, that is, into a Stoic attitude toward that which is other. Significantly, though, the Stoicism to which Philosophy leads Boethius is of a mitigated sort, inasmuch as</page><page sequence="18">720 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS friendship is not included among the things of fortune to which Boethius is anesthetized, an exception that opens up Boethius to genuine wonder and, consequently, to genuine philosophizing. THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY May 2011, Vol. 108, No. 5 Primitive Normativity and Skepticism about Rules, HANNAH GINSBORG The article focuses on the aspects of primitive normativity and the skepticisms about rules. The author looks into the skeptical agreement developed by philosopher Saul Kripke regarding rule-following. She also proposes a solution in addressing the skeptical challenges and approach in rule-following, as well as Kripke's idea of the normativity of meaning. THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY June/July 201 1 , Vol. 108, No. 6/7 Seifand Self -Understanding, TYLER BÜRGE THE JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY April 2012, Vol. 50, No. 2 A Likely Account of Necessity: Plato's Receptacle as a Physical and Metaphysical Foundation for Space, BARBARA SATTLER This paper aims to show that - and how - Plato's notion of the receptacle in the Timaeus provides the conditions for developing a mathematical as well as a physical space without itself being space. In response to the debate about whether Plato's conception of the receptacle is a conception of space or of matter, which presupposes some vague notion of space, the author</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 721 suggests employing criteria from topology and the theory of metric spaces as the most basic ones available. He shows that the main task of the receptacle consists in allowing the elements qua images of the Forms to exist as sensible things, since the receptacle is that in which the elements appear, change, and move. The receptacle guarantees this possibility by virtue of being pure continuity, while all further qualifications of this continuity required for a full notion of space are derived solely from the content of the receptacle. Hobbes , Descartes , and Ideas: A Secret Debate , GIANLUCA MORI The author proposes that the anonymous letter dated May 19, 1641, which Mersenne delivered to Descartes, should be attributed to Thomas Hobbes. Although the text is known, it is usually considered not so much in itself as for Descartes's two replies, which contain important clarifications on the proof of Goďs existence. Hobbes' hand is revealed by various thematic, conceptual, and lexical analogies and, above all, by the presence of two doctrines characteristic of his thought: 1) the denial of the existence of intellectual ideas; 2) the assertion that the nature of God can only be described by the proposition "God exists." Attribution to Hobbes of the May 19th 1641 letter throws new light on the debate that followed Descartes's Meditations as well as on Mersenne's role. Pufendorf on Morality , Sociability , and Moral Powers , STEPHEN DARWALL Recent commentary has generally missed important aspects and so, in my view, what is most fascinating and original in Pufendorf s thought. Pufendorf, although far from the first thinker to hold some version of a divine command theory of morality, may have been the first to attempt to work out what such a view must look like if it is to take seriously the conceptual links between authority, recognition, and accountability, as well as the psychology necessary for these to be realized in the moral life. In the end, however, this introduces an instability into Pufendorf's view. It is here argued that, whereas Pufendorf seeks to derive human moral powers, equal dignity, and sociability from God's superior moral power, the very idea of moral powers, including God's, seems already to presuppose a more basic moral power or dignity that is shared by any being that is capable of sociable relations. Rousseau's Virtue Epistemology, RYAN PATRICK HANLE Y Rousseau's moral and political philosophy is grounded in a largely overlooked virtue epistemology. This essay reconstructs this epistemology with a particular focus on Rousseau's conception of how our capacity for sensation might be cultivated to develop the judgment and wisdom that distinguish the developed virtuous agent. It proceeds in three sections. The first section focuses on Rousseau's conception of the first stage of development, and especially his sensationist claim that all knowledge</page><page sequence="20">722 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS originates in sensory impressions. The second section examines the maturing agent's transition from mere sensation to the cultivation of the capacity for judgment, particularly focusing on Rousseau's account of the agent's shift from the passive reception of sensory impressions of discrete objects to the active and synthetic processes of comparison and association that give rise to complex ideas and to moral conceptions. The third section turns to Rousseau's conception of the developed mind, focusing on his claim that the intellectual virtues not only require cultivation, but are indispensable to the proper exercise of freedom that distinguishes the fully moral human being. Nietzsche's Questions Concerning the Will to Truth , SCOTT JENKINS By a will to truth, Nietzsche understands an overriding commitment, unlimited in scope, to believing in accordance with evidence and argument. This paper shows that the critique of this commitment found in Nietzsche's later works uncovers the psychological grounds of our modern will to truth and establishes its affinity with distinctively moral commitments. It argues that Nietzsche's critique nevertheless provides no answer to his question concerning the value of a will to truth in general. Nietzsche's examination of the will to truth aims instead to establish that we presently lack any standard for determining its value. THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY August 2011, Vol. 108, No. 8 Revisability and Conceptual Change in "Two Dogmas of Empiricism , " DAVID J. CHALMERS This essay explores the article "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" by W. V. Quine which considers the analytic distinction of logical empiricism. It focuses on the final section of the article, which deals with revisability and conceptual change. It discusses this analysis using two-dimensional semantics and the Bayesian theory. A Modest Proposal about Chance , JENANN ISMAEL The article provides information on the proposal for quantum probabilities or chances as a problem in philosophy of science.

It also explores the Traditional Laplacian definitions that govern chancy events according to the dynamic law. MIND July 2011, Vol. 120, No. 479 Frege' s Puzzle and the Objects of Credence, DAVID J. CHALMERS The objects of credence are the entities to which credences are assigned for the purposes of a successful theory of credence. The author uses cases akin to Frege's puzzle to argue against referentialism about credence: the view that objects of credence are determined by the objects and properties at which one's credence is directed. He goes on to develop a nonreferential account of the objects of credence in terms of sets of epistemicaily possible scenarios. - Correspondence to: chalmers@anu.edu.au A New Resolution of the Judy Benjamin Problem , IGOR DOUVEN and JAN-WILLEM ROMEIJN Van Fraassen's Judy Benjamin problem has generally been taken to show that not all rational changes of belief can be modeled in a probabilistic framework if the available update rules are restricted to Bayes's rule and Jeffrey's generalization thereof. But alternative rules based on distance functions between probability assignments that allegedly can handle the problem seem to have counterintuitive consequences. Taking a cue from a recent proposal by Bradley, the author argues that Jeffrey's rule can solve the Judy Benjamin problem after all. Moreover, he shows that the specific instance of Jeffrey's rule that solves the Judy Bei'jamin problem can be underpinned by a particular distance function. Finally, he extends the set of distance functions to ones that take into account the varying degrees to which propositions may be epistemicaily entrenched. - Correspondence to: i.e.j.douven@rug.nl, j.w.romeyn@rug.nl Emergentisms, Ancient and Modern , JONARDON GANERI Jaegwon Kim has argued that the two key issues for emergentism are to give a positive characterization of the emergence relation and to explain the possibility of downward causation. This paper proposes an account of emergence which provides new answers to these two key issues. It argues that an appropriate emergence relation is characterized by a notion of "transformation," and that the real key issue for emergentism is located</page><page sequence="22">724 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS elsewhere than the places Kim identifies. The paper builds on Victor Caston's important work on ancient philosophy of mind, but appeals to sources he has not considered. - Correspondence to: j.ganeri@sussex.ac.uk On Intellectualism in Epistemologi /&gt; STEPHEN R. GRIMM According to "orthodox" epistemologa, it has recently been said that whether or not a true belief amounts to knowledge depends exclusively on truth-related factors: for example, on whether the true belief was formed in a reliable way, or was supported by good evidence, and so on. Jason Stanley refers to this as the "intellectualist" component of orthodox epistemologa and Jeremy Fantl and Matthew McGrath describe it as orthodox epistemology's commitment to a "purely epistemic" account of knowledge - that is, an account of knowledge where only truth-related factors figure in, whether or not a person knows. In the first part of this paper, the author clarifies the intellectualist thesis and distinguishes what he takes to be its two main strains. In the remainder of the paper he then takes a more critical turn and argues that even if , as a matter of fact, traditional epistemology has endorsed intellectualism in both of its strains, this is a mistake on the part of the tradition. At least one way of understanding intellectualism should be rejected, and its practicalist counterpart should be accepted instead. - Correspondence to: sgrimm@fordham.edu Parfit on ' the Normal/a Reliable/any Cause ' of Relation R, ALAN SIDELLE In section 96 of Reasons and Persons , Derek Parfit offers his now familiar tripartite distinction among candidates for "what matters": (1) Relation R with its normal cause; (2) R with any reliable cause; (3) R with any cause. He defends option (3). This paper tries to show that there is important ambiguity in this distinction and in Parfiťs defense of his position. There is something strange about Parfiťs way of dividing up the territory: the paper argues that those who have followed him in viewing the choice among (1)- (3) as an important question in thinking about "what matters" are mistaken, and that they bypass what seems to be a more important, even crucial, set of options and considerations. The author is less concerned with what Parfit does say than with what he ought to say, given his intuitions and arguments, and the general framework within which he is working. The author is particularly concerned to show that whether or not he is correct about what Parfit is doing with his tripartite distinction, it is a distinction with which we should not be particularly concerned in the analysis either of what matters or of psychological continuity. - Correspondence to: asidelle@wisc.edu The Moral/Conventional Distinction , NICHOLAS SOUTHWOOD Common sense suggests that moral judgments and conventional normative judgments are importantly different in kind. Yet a compelling vindicating account of the moral/conventional distinction has proven</page><page sequence="23">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 725 persistently elusive. The distinction is typically explicated in terms of either formal properties (the Form View) or substantive properties (the Content View) of the principles that figure in the judgments. But the most promising versions of these views face serious difficulties. After reviewing the diffi- culties with the standard accounts, the author proposes a new way of explicating the moral/conventional distinction in terms of the role that social practices play in grounding the judgments (the Grounds View). - Correspondence to: nicholas.southwood@anu.edu.au THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY January 2012, Vol. 62, No. 246 Credit Theories and the Value of Knowledge, JASON BAEHR One alleged advantage of credit theories of knowledge is that they are capable of explaining why knowledge is essentially more valuable than mere true belief. The author argues that credit theories in fact provide grounds for denying this claim and therefore are incapable of overcoming the "value problem" in epistemology. Much of the discussion revolves around the question of whether true belief is always epistemically valuable. The author also considers to what extent, if any, his main argument should worry credit theorists. Joint Action and Development , STEPHEN BUTTERFILL Given the premise that joint action plays some role in explaining how humans come to understand minds, what could joint action be? It is not what a leading account, Michael Bratman's, says it is, for on that account engaging in joint action involves sharing intentions and sharing intentions requires much of the understanding of minds whose development is supposed to be explained by appeal to joint action. This paper, therefore, offers an account of a different kind of joint action, an account compatible with the premise about development. The new account is no replacement for the leading account; rather the accounts characterize two kinds of joint action. Where the kind of joint action characterized by the leading account involves shared intentions, the new account characterizes a kind of joint action involving shared goals.</page><page sequence="24">726 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Consequentialism , Metaphysical Realism and the Argument from Cluelessness , DALE DORSEY Lenman's "argument from cluelessness" against consequentialism is that a significant percentage of the consequences of our actions are wholly unknowable, so that when it comes to assessing the moral quality of our actions, we are without a clue. The author distinguishes the argument from cluelessness from traditional epistemic objections to consequentialism. The argument from cluelessness should be no more problematic for consequentialism than the argument from epistemologica! skepticism should be for metaphysical realism. This puts those who would reject consequential- ism on the ground of cluelessness in an awkward philosophical position. Trans-world Causation? EDUARDO GARCÍA-RAMÍREZ According to Lewis, causal claims must be analyzed in terms of counterfactual conditionals, and these in turn are understood in terms of relations of comparative similarity among single concrete possible worlds. Lewis also claims that there is no transworld causation because there is no way to make sense of transworld counterfactuals without automatically making them come out to be false. In this paper, the author argues against this claim. He shows how to make sense of transworld counterfactuals in a nontrivial way that can make them come out to be true, by appealing to relations of comparative similarity among concrete possible worlds (that is, assuming modal realism). He argues either that merely making such sense of a relevant counterfactual is not enough to have causation, or that Lewis' modal realism must be given up. Thematic Unity in the Phenomenology of Thinking , ANDERS NES Many philosophers hold that the phenomenology of thinking (also known as cognitive phenomenology) reduces to the phenomenology of the speech, sensory imagery, emotions or feelings associated with it. But even if this reductionist claim is correct, there is still a properly cognitive dimension to the phenomenology of at least some thinking. Specifically, conceptual content makes a constitutive contribution to the phenomenology of at least some thought episodes, in that it constitutes what this author calls their thematic unity. Often, when a thought episode has a phenomenal character, the various associated speech, sensory imagery, emotions or feelings are often organized around a common theme, constituted by the conceptual content of one's thinking. Associative Responsibilities and Political Obligation , MASSIMO RENZO In this paper, the author criticizes an influential version of associative theory of political obligation and offers a reformulation of the theory in "quasi-voluntaiist" terms. He argues that, although unable by itself to solve</page><page sequence="25">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 727 the problem of political obligation, his quasi-voluntarist associative model can play an important role in solving this problem. Moreover, the model teaches us an important methodological lesson about the way in which we should think about the question of political obligation. Finally, the author suggests that the quasi-voluntarist associative model is particularly attractive because it manages to combine the main thrust of the traditional associative view with the most attractive feature of transactional theories, while avoiding at the same time the main problems that afflict each of these two approaches. Functional Beauty , Architecture , and Morality : A Beautiful Konzentrationslager? ANDREA SAUCHELLI Some works of architecture have remarkable aesthetic value. According to certain philosophers, part of this value derives from the appearance of such constructions to fulfill the function for which they were built. This paper argues that one way of understanding the connection between function and aesthetic value resides in the concept of functional beauty. It analyzes a number of recent accounts of this notion and then offers a better way of understanding it. The author then focuses his attention on the relation between aesthetic and moral values and claims that, if the notion of functional beauty makes any sense at all, then we have a pro tanto case for holding that moral defects in works of architecture can have aesthetic merits. Addressing Testimonial Injustice : Being Ignored and Being Rejected , JEREMY WANDERER The author examines a distinctive kind of injustice which arises when people are maltreated in their capacity as potential conveyors of knowledge. Extant discussions of testimonial injustice usually assume that the injustice occurs when an audience ignores the claims made by a testifier. This assumption obscures the fact that there are occasions where the best framework for thinking about testimonial injustice is that of inappropriately rejecting, not ignoring, those claims; the injustice differs in these two kinds of case. Light is thrown on the injustice involved in inappropriate rejection by examining the epistemic import of the distinctive second-person interrelations in play in such testimonial interactions. A Law unto Oneself, JONATHAN WEBBER We should understand the concept of self-legislation that is central to Kant's moral philosophy not in terms of the enactment of statute, but in terms of the way in which judges make law, by setting down and refining precedent through particular judgments. This paper presents a descriptive model of agency based on self-legislation so understood, and argues that we can read Kant's normative ethics as based on this view of agency. It is intended to contribute to contemporary debates in moral psychology and to exegetical discussion of Kant.</page><page sequence="26">728 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW January 201 2, Vol. 1 21 , No. 1 Belief and Indeterminacy , MICHAEL CAIE An attractive approach to the semantic paradoxes holds that cases of semantic pathology give rise to indeterminacy. What attitude should a rational agent have toward a proposition that he takes to be indeterminate in this sense? Orthodoxy holds that rationality requires that an agent disbelieve such a proposition. This paper argues that a rational agent should be such that it is indeterminate whether he believes the proposition in question. For rational agents, indeterminacy in the objects of their attitudes will filter up to the attitudes themselves. Dragging and Confirming , MATTHEW KOTZEN This essay addresses the question of when evidence for a stronger claim HI also constitutes evidence for a weaker claim H2. Although the answer "always" is tempting, it is false on a natural Bayesian conception of evidence. This essay first describes some prima facie counterexamples to this answer and surveys some weaker answers and rejects them. Next, it proposes an answer which appeals to the "Dragging Condition." After explaining and arguing for its use of the Dragging Condition, the essay argues that the Dragging Condition provides a general account of, and solution to, the counterexamples with which the essay began. The essay briefly discusses the relevance of the Dragging Condition to the recently much-discussed topic of "transmission failure" in epistemology, applies the Dragging Condition to the problem of "bootstrapping" in epistemology, and discusses three important objections to the view defended in the essay. Where Love and Resentment Meet: Strawson1 s Intrapersonal Defense of Compatibilism, SETHSHABO In his seminal essay "Freedom and Resentment," P. F. Strawson drew attention to the role of such emotions as resentment, moral indignation, and guilt in our moral and personal lives. According to Strawson, these reactive attitudes are at once constitutive of moral blame and inseparable from ordinary interpersonal relationships. On this basis, he concluded that relinquishing moral blame is not a real possibility for us, given our commitment to personal relationships. If well founded, this conclusion puts the traditional free-will debate in a new light. In particular, insofar as incompatibilists believe that we can or should forgo moral blame if determinism is true, their stance may seem out of touch with our emotional reality. This essay examines Strawson's claim that the reactive attitudes are inseparable from ordinary interpersonal relationships. Strawson says</page><page sequence="27">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 729 surprisingly little to support this intriguing claim, and thus far no argument for it has emerged in the literature. This essay's aim is to remedy this. Specifically, it sets out an argument for a suitably formulated version of the inseparability claim, an argument that appeals to the relationship between the reactive attitudes and other elements of our emotional lives. It then shows how this argument helps to answer an important recent challenge to Strawson's position. If this essay is right, there is good reason to doubt that the reforms envisaged by some incompatibilists, reforms to our blame-related practices, are a real possibility for us.

LIU The debates about human free will are traditionally the concern of metaphysics, but neuroscientists have recently entered the field arguing that acts of the will are determined by brain events which are themselves causal products of other events. We examine that claim through the example of free or voluntary switch of perception in relation to the Necker cube. When I am asked to see the cube in one way, I decide whether I will follow the command (or do as I am asked) using skills that reason and language give to me and change my brain states accordingly. The voluntary shift of perspective in seeing the Necker cube this way or that exemplifies the top-down control exercised by a human being on the basis of the role of language and meaning in their activity. It also indicates the lived story that is at the center of each human consciousness. In the third part of this essay, three arguments are used to undermine metaphysical objections to the very idea of top-down self control. - Correspondence to: grant.gillett@otaho.ac.nz, and liuch471@ student.otago.ac.nz</page><page sequence="28">730 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Huck Finn , Aristotle , and Anti-Intellectualism in Moral Psychology , JAMES MONTMARQUET Jonathan Bennett, Nomy Arpaly, and others see in Huckleberry Finn's apparent praiseworthiness for not turning Jim in (even though this goes against his own moral judgments in the matter) a model for an improved, nonintellectualist approach to moral appraisal. This paper tries to show - both on Aristotelian and on independent grounds - that these positions are fundamentally flawed. In the process, it tries to show how Huck may be blameless for lacking what would have been a praiseworthy belief (that I should help Jim), hence, blameless for not acting on this belief; but being "blamelessly unpraiseworthy,, is not the same thing as being praiseworthy. - Correspondence to: jmontmarquet@tnstate.edu The Irrevocability of Being, J.

Secondly, the paper applies this principle to a well-known issue in the philosophy of time, that of whether future events, like past events, have being, though not now occurring. - Correspondence to: jjvalberg@hotmail.com The Four Points of the Compass , JAMES ALEXANDER Philosophy has four forms: wonder, faith, doubt, and skepticism. These are not separate categories, but separate ideal possibilities. Modern academic philosophy has fallen, for several centuries, into an error: which is the error of supposing that philosophy is only what is here called doubt. Philosophy may be doubt; indeed, it is part of my argument that this is undeniably one element of, or one possibility in, philosophy; but doubt is only one of four points of the compass. In this essay, the nature of each point of the compass is indicated as it has been found in the history of philosophy. - Correspondence to: jalexand@bilkent.edu.tr</page><page sequence="29">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 731 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH November 201 1 , Vol. 83, No. 3 The Role of Visual Language in Berkeley's Account of Generality , KATHERINE DUNLOP This article presents literary criticism of George Berkley's New Theory of Vision and The Principles of Human Knowledge. It examines the role of visual language on the principles of knowledge formulated by Berkeley. It notes that Berkeley conceives the relations of signification as basic to all generality. The essay argues that Berkeley intends linguistic signification to be understood with reference to the visual language, signifying that human beings experience by touch. Unenriched Subsentential Illocutions , EROS CORAZZA In this paper, the author challenges the common wisdom (see Dummett and Davidson) that sentences are the minimal units with which one can perform a speech act or make a move in the language game, arguing, with Perry and Stainton, that subsentences can be used to perform full-fledged speech acts. In the author's discussion, he assumes the traditional framework which distinguishes between the proposition expressed and the thought or mental state one comes to grasp when using or understanding an utterance expressing a proposition. Unlike Stainton, the author will argue that the proposition expressed by a subsentential assertion and its corresponding thought are not the end product of a pragmatic process of free enrichment. He defends the view that a thought may concern something without the thinker having to represent that very thing. This should help us to resist the view that with the utterance of a subsentence enrichment is mandatory. The author further argues that subsentences and their corresponding thoughts are situated. Because of this we can successfully interact and engage in joint ventures using subsentences, and can be guided by thoughts without having to enrich them. The fact that the actors' unenriched thoughts are cosituated may suffice to explain the positive outcome of their joint project. Last but not least, the author shows how the picture he proposes gains further support by taking on board Perry's distinction between reflexive truth conditions and incremental truth conditions (or official content). If this essay is right in arguing that an utterance's reflexive truth conditions are the best tool to classify the semantic features of one's mental state (or sentence in Mentalese), we can further explain mental causation and linguistic communication without appealing to free enrichment.</page><page sequence="30">732 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS A Priori Skepticism , JAMES R. BEEBE This article examines a neglected form of radical skepticism that explores whether any of the logical, mathematical, or other self-evident beliefs count as knowledge. It outlines some of the basic considerations regarding skepticism about the external world that will act as useful starting points for articulating a priori skeptical challenges. The essay argues that a priori skeptics can obtain impossible skeptical hypotheses to present skeptical challenges. Concessive Knowledge Attributions and Fallibilism, CLAYTON LITTLEJOHN Lewis thought concessive knowledge attributions (for example, "I know that Harry is a zebra, but it might be that he's just a cleverly disguised mule") caused serious trouble for fallibilists. As he saw it, CKAs are overt statements of the fallibilist view and they are contradictory. Dougherty and Rysiew have argued that CKAs are pragmatically defective rather than semantically defective. Stanley thinks that their pragmatic response to Lewis fails, but the fallibilist cause is not lost because Lewis was wrong about the commitments of fallibilism. There are problems with Dougherty and Rysiew's response to Stanley, and there are problems with Stanley's response to Lewis. This paper offers a defense of fallibilism, showing that fallibilists need not worry about CKAs. Deriving Ethics from Action : A Nietzschean Version of Constitutivism , PAUL KATSAFANAS This essay considers the usage of constitutivism as an attractive justificatory strategy within ethics. It examines the structure of human motivation by engaging in philosophical psychology. The article focuses on the development of a successful constitutivism through the application of the theory of Friedrich Nietzsche. PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH January 2012, Vol. 84, No. 1 In Defense of the Phenomenal Concept Strategy , KATALIN BALOG In this article, the author discusses the phenomenal concept strategy. According to the author, on the constitutional account, there is an intimate relation between phenomenal concepts and their referents. She also</page><page sequence="31">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 733 proposes that token experiences serve as modes of presentation for the phenomenal properties that they instantiate. Cognitive Penetration of Colour Experience : Rethinking the Issue in Light of an Indirect Mechanism , FIONA MACPHERSON In this article, the author proposes a two-step mechanism of indirect cognitive penetration that explains how cognitive penetration may occur. She proposes that there is one potential counterexample to the cognitive impenetrability thesis that is not persuasively explained away by the usual strategies. She also claims that the second stage of the mechanism occurs in humans. Resultant Luck , CAROLINA SARTORIO This article discusses the concept of resultant luck. According to the author, resultant luck makes use of two important notions: the notion of being in control of an outcome and the notion of being morally responsible for an outcome. She further claims that the resultant luck is moral luck, which is about the results or consequences of acts. A Dual Aspect Account of Moral Language , CAJ STRANDBERG It is often observed in metaethics that moral language displays a certain duality in as much as it seems to concern both objective facts in the world and subjective attitudes that move to action. In this paper, the author defends The Dual Aspect Account, which is intended to capture this duality: A person's utterance of a sentence according to which cj^ing has a moral characteristic, such as "c()ing is wrong," conveys two things: The sentence expresses, in virtue of its conventional meaning, the belief that 4&gt;ing has a moral property, and the utterance of the sentence carries a generalized conversational implicature to the effect that the person in question has an action-guiding attitude in relation to (|)ing. This account has significant advantages over competing views: (1) as it is purely cognitivist, it does not have the difficulties of expressivism and various ecumenical positions; (2) yet, in spite of this, it can explain the close, "meaning-like," connection between moral language and attitudes; (3) in contrast to other pragmatic accounts, it is compatible with any relevant cognitivist view; (4) it does not rest on a contentious pragmatic notion, such as conventional implicature; (5) it does not imply that utterances of complex moral sentences, such as conditionals, convey attitudes. In addition, the generalized implicature in question is fully calculable and cancellable. Assertion and Practical Reasoning : Common or Divergent Epistemic Standards? JESSICA BROWN The article reports that there is a common epistemic standard for assertion and practical reasoning. An assertion may be criticized as rude,</page><page sequence="32">734 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS immoral, imprudent, or irrelevant. Both assertion and practical reasoning may be further criticized on the ground that one is not in a sufficiently good epistemic position to assert the proposition. Compatibilism and Moral Claimancy : An Intermediate Path to Appropriate Blame , SETH SHABO In this article, the author discusses compatibilism. He points out that it might be thought that contemporary compatibilists are committed to some robust conception of responsibility. He also proposes that if compatibilists can show that such an intermediate conception has application under determinism, they will have succeeded in defending responsibility-related attitudes and practices. PHRONESIS 2012, Vol. 57, No. 1 Modes of Being at Sophist 255c-e, FIONA LEIGH This article argues for a new interpretation of the argument for the nonidentity of Being and Difference at Sophist 255c-e, which turns on a distinction between modes of being a property. Though indebted to Frede, the distinction differs from his in an important respect: What distinguishes the modes is not the subject's relation to itself or to something numerically distinct, but whether it constitutes or conforms to the specification of some property. Thus the author's view, but not Frede's, allows for self-participation of the Forms. Against Frede and the more traditional interpretation, the author maintains that the distinction is not introduced by way of the pros alla/kath' hauta distinction, or by way of uses or senses of the verb "to be," but is established prior to the argument and is deployed in its frame. Moreover, since the author reads the argument's scope as restricted to properties in what she calls the attribute mode, her interpretation can explain, as its rivals cannot, why the criterion of difference at 255d6-7 does not apply to the Form Difference itself. - Correspondence to: fiona.leigh@ucl.ac.uk The Origin and Aim of Posterior Analytics 11.19 , DAVID BRONSTEIN In Posterior Analytics 11.19, Aristotle raises and answers the question, how do first principles become known? The usual view is that the question asks about the process or method by which we learn principles and that his answer is induction. The author argues that the question asks about the original prior knowledge from which principles become known and that his</page><page sequence="33">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 735 answer is perception. Hence the aim of 11.19 is not to explain how we get all the way to principles, but to defend the claim that our knowledge of them originates in perception. Aristotle explains how we learn principles earlier in book II in his account of definitional inquiry. In 11.19, he explains how we reach by induction the preliminary accounts necessary for such inquiries. - Correspondence to: dbronste@bu.edu Motion and Change in Aristotle's Physics 5.1 , JACOB ROSEN This paper illustrates how Aristotle's topological theses about change in Physics 5-6 can help address metaphysical issues. Two distinctions from Physics 5.1 are discussed: changing per se versus changing per aliud ; motion versus change. Change from white to black is motion and alteration, whereas change from white to not white is neither. But is not every change from white to black identical with a change from white to not white? Theses from Physics 6 refute the identity. Is change from white to black at least accompanied by change from white to not white? Perhaps, but given further theses from Physics 6, this supposition yields unwelcome consequences. Most likely, when something changes from white to black it changes merely per aliud , not per se , from white to not white. Genuine change between white and not white is found elsewhere; its admission has bearing on Aristotle's theory of perception. - Correspondence to: Jacob.rosen@philosophie.hu- berlin.de RATIO December 201 1 , Vol. 24, No. 4 Deontological Moral Obligations and Non-Welfarist Agent-Relative Values , MICHAEL SMITH Many claim that a plausible moral theory would have to include a principle of beneficence, a principle telling us to produce goods that are both welfarist and agent-neutral. But when we think carefully about the necessary connection between moral obligations and reasons for action, we see that agents have two reasons for action, and two moral obligations: they must not interfere with any agent's exercise of his rational capacities, and they must do what they can to make sure that agents have rational capacities to exercise. According to this distinctively deontological view of morality, though we are obliged to produce goods, the goods in question are nonwelfarist and agent- relative. The value of welfare thus turns out to be, at best, instrumental.</page><page sequence="34">736 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Recalcitrant Pluralism , PHILIP STRATTON-LAKE In this article, the author argues that the best form of deontology is one understood in terms of prima facie duties. He outlines how these duties are to be understood and shows how they offer a plausible and elegant connection between the reason why we ought to do certain acts, the normative reasons we have to do these acts, the reason why moral agents will do them, and the reasons certain people have to resent someone who does not do them. The author then argues that this form of deontology makes it harder to unify a pluralistic ethics under a single consequentialist principle in a plausible way, and illustrates this with reference to Rob Shaver's consequentialist arguments. Defending Double Effect , RALPH WEDGWOOD This essay defends a version of the Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE) - the doctrine that there is normally a stronger reason against an act that has a bad state of affairs as one of its intended effects than against an otherwise similar act that has that bad state of affairs as an unintended effect. First, a precise account of this version of the DDE is given. Secondly, some suggestions are made about why we should believe the DDE, and about why it is true. Finally, a solution is developed to the so-called closeness problem that any version of the DDE must face. The Possibility of Consent, DAVID OWENS Worries about the possibility of consent recall a more familiar problem about promising raised by Hume. To see the parallel here, we must distinguish the power of consent from the normative significance of choice. The author argues that we have normative interests, interests in being able to control the rights and obligations of ourselves and those around us, interests distinct from our interest in controlling the non-normative situation. Choice gets its normative significance from our non-normative control interests. By contrast, the possibility of consent depends on a species of normative interest that the author calls a permissive interest, an interest in it being the case that certain acts wrong us unless we declare otherwise. In the final section, he shows how our permissive interests underwrite the possibility of consent. Enforcement Rights Against Non-Culpable Non-Just Intrusion , PETER VALLENTYNE The author articulates and defends a principle governing enforcement rights in response to a nonculpable noi'just rights-intrusion (for example, wrongful bodily attack by someone who falsely, but with full epistemic justification, believes that he is acting permissibly). The account requires that the use of force reduces the harm from such intrusions and is sensitive to the extent to which the intruder is agent-responsible for imposing intrusion-harm.</page><page sequence="35">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 737 Does Moral Ignorance Exculpate? ELIZABETH HARMAN Nonmoral ignorance can exculpate: if Anne spoons cyanide into Bill's coffee, but thinks she is spooning sugar, then Anne may be blameless for poisoning Bill. Gideon Rosen argues that moral ignorance can also exculpate: if one does not believe that one's action is wrong, and one has not mismanaged one's beliefs, then one is blameless for acting wrongly. On his view, many apparently blameworthy actions are blameless. The author discusses several objections to Rosen. She then proposes an alternative view on which many agents who act wrongly are blameworthy, despite believing they are acting morally permissibly, and despite not having mismanaged their moral beliefs. RATIO March 2012, Vol. 25, No. 1 Character , Psychoanalytic Identification , and Numerical Identity , LOUISE BRADDOCK Identification figures prominently in moral psychological explanations. It is here argued that, in identification, the subject has an "identity-thought," which is a thought about his numerical identity with the figure he identifies with. In Freud's psychoanalytic psychology, character is founded on unconscious identification with parental figures. Moral philosophers have drawn on psychoanalysis to explain how undesirable or disadvantageous character dispositions are resistant to insight through being unconscious. According to Richard Wollheim's analysis of Freud's theory, identification is the subject's disposition to imagine, unconsciously, his bodily merging with the figure he identifies with. The author argues that this explanation of identification is not adequate. Human character is held to be capable of change when self-reflection brings unconscious identifications to conscious self-knowledge. She argues that, for self-knowledge, these identifications must be an intelligible part of the subject's self-conception, and that Wollheim's "merging phantasy" is not intelligible to the subject in this way. By contrast, the subject's thought that he is numerically identical to the figure he identifies with does provide an intelligible starting-point for reflecting on this identification. This psychoanalytic account provides a clear conception of identification with which to investigate puzzle cases in the moral psychology of character. - Correspondence to: leb41@cam.ac.uk</page><page sequence="36">738 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Just What Is Vagueness? OTÁVIO BUENO and MARK COLYVAN The authors argue that standard definitions of "vagueness" prejudice the question of how best to deal with the phenomenon of vagueness. In particular, the usual understanding of vagueness in terms of borderline cases, where the latter are thought of as truth-value gaps, begs the question against the subvaluational approach. According to this latter approach, borderline cases are inconsistent (that is, glutty, not gappy). The authors suggest that a definition of vagueness should be general enough to accommodate any genuine contender in the debate over how to best deal with the sorites paradox. Moreover, a definition of vagueness must be able to accommodate the variety of forms the sorites arguments can take. These include numerical, total-ordered sorites arguments, discrete versions, continuous versions, as well as others without any obvious metric structure at all. After considering the shortcomings of various definitions of "vagueness," the authors propose a very general, non-question-begging definition. - Correspondence to: otaviobueno@mac. com, mark. colyvan@sydney . edu. au Between The Old Metaphysics and The New Empiricism : Collingwooďs Defence Of The Autonomy Of Philosophy, GIUSEPPINA D'ORO Collingwood has failed to make a significant impact in the history of twentieth century philosophy either because he has been dismissed as a dusty old idealist committed to the very metaphysics the analytical school was trying to leave behind, or because his later work has been interpreted as advocating the dissolution of philosophy into history. This paper argues that Collingwooďs key philosophical works are a sustained attempt to defend the view that philosophy is an autonomous discipline with a distinctive domain of inquiry and that Collingwooďs attempt to defend the autonomy of philosophy is intimately connected to his defense of intentional notions against the kind of meaning skepticism which came to prevail from the 1920s. The author defends the philosophical claim that there is a third way between the idealist metaphysics with which Collingwood is often associated and the neo- empiricist agenda which characterized analytic philosophy in mid-century by defending the hermeneutic thesis that Collingwooďs work is a sustained attempt to articulate a conception of philosophy as an epistemologically first science. Since there is a via media between the old metaphysics and the new empiricism, there is no need to choose between a certain kind of armchair metaphysics and a scientifically informed ontology. - Correspondence to: g.ďoro@keele.ac.uk Should Marital Relations Be Non-Hierarchical? IDDO LANDAU The paper explores an egalitarian norm widely accepted today, which the author calls the Marital Non-Hierarchy Standard. According to this standard, marital relationships should be nonhierarchical; neither partner may be more dominant than the other. The Marital Non-Hierarchy Standard is exceptional: in almost all associations, including many financial, professional, educational</page><page sequence="37">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 739 and recreational ones, in almost all spheres of life, some hierarchies, within certain limits, are widely believed to be morally legitimate. The author argues that in marital relations, too, some hierarchies should be accepted as morally legitimate. It might be argued that marital relations should be loving, and love requires that lovers will have the same degree of power. However, contemporary analyses of love show that love is consistent with (some) hierarchies. It might also be argued that justice requires that lovers will have equal power. However, theories of distributive justice such as Rawls's, Sen's, Dworkin's, and almost all others allow some marital hierarchies. Thus, both the love requirement and the justice requirement allow some hierarchical marital relationships and conflict with the Marital Non-Hierarchy Standard. Until other justifications for this standard are presented, it is unclear why it should be endorsed. - Correspondence to: ilandau@research.haifa.ac.il Strong Interiority and (Traditional) Theism : What's The Problem? ROBERT OAKES Central to Spinozism is the thesis that the immanence of the Divine Substance in the cosmos (in natural objects) is - like the immanence of the dancer in the dance - maximal or total. Just as the dance consists entirely of the dancer in aesthetically-stylized motion, so the domain of nature is nothing in addition to God in cosmic guise. Accordingly, natural objects constitute modes of God. Hence, Spinozism and (traditional) theism are obviously irreconcilable. For it is indispensable to theism that the immanence of God in the cosmos is not maximal; rather, it is necessary that natural objects are distinct from the Divine Substance. Now it has standardly been presupposed by theists (and many others) that natural objects could not be distinct from God without being ontologically exterior to God; thus, that theism would readily collapse into Spinozism if the cosmos was interior to the Divine Substance. The author believes that this is a long-standing mistake. After demonstrating that there is probative warrant for maintaining that theism requires the interiority of natural objects to God, there is shown to be more than adequate justification for denying that this necessitates the collapse of theism into Spinozism. - Correspondence to: boakes5966@aol.com Testimony and Sincerity , THOMAS W. SIMPSON Is there a justified presumption that a speaker is testifying sincerely? Anti-reductionism about testimony claims that there is, absent reasons to the contrary. Yet why believe this, given the actuality and prevalence of lies and deception? The author examines one argument that may be appropriated to meet this challenge, David Lewis's claim that truthfulness is a convention. The author argues that it fails, and that the supposition that there is a presumption of sincerity remains unsupported. The failure of Lewis's argument is instructive, however, for it shows us a better way of approaching language use than the standard antireductionist treatment. As speech is an</page><page sequence="38">740 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS intentional action, so a presumption of the sincerity or otherwise of others' testimony must be explicable in the terms we normally use to explain action. - Correspondence to: tws21@cam.ac.uk Are Emotions Perceptual Experiences of Value? DEMIAN WHITING A number of emotion theorists hold that emotions are perceptions of value. In this paper, the author argues that they are wrong. He claims that, in the case of emotion, there is nothing that can provide the perceptual modality that is needed if the perceptual theory is to succeed (where by "perceptual modality" one means the particular manner in which something is perceived). The author argues that the five sensory modalities are not possible candidates for providing us with "emotional perception." He also offers an explanation for why the usual candidate offered - namely feeling or affectivity - does not give us the sought-after perceptual modality. He concludes that as there seems to be nothing else that can provide the needed perceptual modality, we should reject the perceptual theory of emotion. - Correspondence to: d.whiting@hull.ac.uk</page></plain_text>
