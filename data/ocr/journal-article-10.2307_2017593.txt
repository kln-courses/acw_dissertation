<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nuevos proleg6omenos a la metaftsica. ANGEL VASSALLO. Buenos Aires: Editorial Losada. 1938. 216 pp. $3.00 mon./arg. Angel Vassallo is an Argentine philosopher whose intellectual roots are buried deeply in French thought. Maurice Blondel, "one of the keenest French philosophers of our day, and perhaps the most profound and original of them," has been his special inspira- tion and point of departure. No other si-ngle book has exerted more influLence upon his way of thinking than Blondel's L'action. The above volume, a collection of recent essays and lectures, shows decisively that the philosopher from Aix has a good disciple down Argentine way. The "New Prolegomena to Metaphysics," as a title, might easily be construed as an ambitious effort to outdo Kant; but what</page><page sequence="2">192 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY should be implied from the title is that Professor Vassallo is not satisfied with Kant's solution to the problem of metaphysics. Kant, it is admitted, was to be sure on the right track as far as he went; but he permitted the rationalism or "intelectualismo," of which he was an avowed enemy from the start to get the best of him in the end, thereby failing to reach the goal. Following closely the lead of Blondel, the author suggests that the problem can be solved only by a "conversion of metaphysics into ethics." In the essay on Descartes, there is a "short meditation," which though "very schematic" at present is a manifest expression of Vassallo's own thinking. Descartes is credited with having taught philosophers '"to begin from consciousness." Now, according to the author, there are four basic ways of beginning from scratch, so to speak. The first three ways-realism, Kantian criticism, absolute idealism-all suffer from some difficulty or other. Gabriel Mar- cel, another important French influence, attacks idealism on the ground that it ignores "the personal in all its forms, ignores the tragic, denies the transcendent and tries to reduce it to expressions which do not recognize its essential traits." Realism is ruled out as naive, and the critical philosophy is analyzed as ultimately un- critical. Returning to the Cartesian point of departure, whose full con- sequences Descartes himself failed to appreciate, Vassallo concludes that "the correct way" of beginning from consciousness is not to conceive this basal category as a "receptacle of apodictic asser- tions" or as an "absolute logos," but as the "unhappy, needy awareness" of an "imperfect, finite being." In short, the proper beginning is not from consciousness ("desde la conciencia"), but consciousness from ("conciencia desde"), the tragic sense of finitude. In the reviewer's opinion, what the author must still do is to elaborate clearly the implicitly intimate relation between the prob- lem of "converting metaphysics into ethics" and the problem of "the ontological status of finitude." Whatever solution may be forthcoming from Vassallo 's sensitive and interesting pen, the suspicion remains that his Weltanschauung is "human, all too human," a product of an anthropomorphic predicament.
