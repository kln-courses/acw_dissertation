<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Periwigged Heralds": Epistemology and Intertextuality in Early American Cometography Christopher Johnson In the winter of 1680-81 an enormous comet appeared in the nighttime skies of Europe and the Americas.' This "blazing star" occasioned numerous treatises, poems, pamphlets, broadsides, ballads, engravings, and woodcuts. Evaluating this cometary copia, the historian of science, Pingr6, in 1783 ob- serves: The world was inundated with writings on these phenomena, on their nature, on their significations; for there were still astrologers and cometomantics [Cometomantiens] ... I believe that the languages were not even as confused at the Tower of Babel, as were the sentiments concerning this famous comet.2 Pingr6's belated impatience with the discursive flood of "astrologers and cometomantics" echoes of course the more general Cartesian objection to the confusion of words and things, a confusion that L'Academie des sciences and Royal Society dedicated themselves to eliminating. But the arduous nature of this effort in seventeenth-century Europe is exemplified by the numerous, of- ten-conflicting interpretations of the 1618, 1665, and 1680 comets-to say nothing of the unprecedented "new stars" or novas of 1572 and 1604, which were often treated as cometary phenomena. In this essay, though, I will trace the contours of this epistemological confusion in the Americas-specifically in 'The comet became visible in Europe on 14 November. Around Christmas it disappeared and then reappeared a week later-after it orbited the sun. It remained visible until 17 February. 2M.

More particularly, by focusing on some of the intertextual aspects of the interpretation of the 1680 comet in the Americas, I suggest that the herme- neutic of signs which dominated in one way or another almost every Early American cometography is indicative of broader epistemological and rhetori- cal tensions that characterize the period. Popular belief in late seventeenth-century Europe generally held that a comet's appearance heralded God's wrath. In Germany the terrible "Wunder- Komet" of 1680 precipitated the publication of nearly a hundred treatises, most of which echoed the motto on a medal struck by the State Library of Zurich: "The star threatens evil things. Have faith! God will set things right."3 The devout comet-watcher could thus look forward to imminent salvation, while sinners were urged to seize a final chance to repent. Still, even many of the learned who treated comets mathematically also embraced some form of theo- logical hermeneutic. Both Kepler and, later in his life, Newton wished to retain comets as actors in God's eschatological drama.4 Though others, like Galileo and Gassendi, saw the comet as a natural event without semiotic significance, the more astrologically inclined continued to see it not just as a sign but as the effective cause itself of ill, or less often, good fortune.5 Stanislaw Lubieniecki's 1667 Theatrum cometicum thus places one comet at Jerusalem's destruction and another at Christ's birth.6 In other words, the Theatrum, like most contem- porary cometographies, is fueled by the logic of analogy, for a comet was gen- erally read as a wondrous (but usually disastrous) sign linking the microcosm and macrocosm, or alternately, as a sign legible only by translating the Book of Nature with the lexicon provided by the Book of God, the Bible.7 When it came to comets, the epistemic shift that Foucault traces in The Order of Things, from a sixteenth-century symbolic or qualitative world-view to a seventeenth-cen- tury rationalist or quantitative one, was often slowly and/or incompletely achieved. Forced to speak of a comet's "beard" or "tail," even the less mantic cometographers found themselves interrogating the analogical nature of their discourse as much as the celestial objects that excited their curiosity. 3 Robinson, The Great Comet of 1680, 122. 4 See Kepler's Mysterium cosmographicum (1596) and De cometis libelli tres (1619).

Most famously, Pierre Bayle in his Pensees diverses; Ecrites a un Docteur de Sorbonne, d l 'occasion de la comete qui parut au mois de Decembre 1680, uses the comet as a kind of floating signifier which allows him to interrogate with proto-Enlightenment rigor all manner of credulous discourse. While this attack on astrological cometography is certainly fueled by religious motives, Bayle's treatise also represents a decisive rejection of analogical reasoning. For instance, in the course of refuting the ancient notion that comets presage disaster, Bayle challenges aspects of the poetic tradition as exemplified by Virgil, Lucan, and others: Poets are so obdurate as to strew their works with numerous, pompous descriptions, such as prodigies and the bestowal upon their heroes of marvelous attributes, for, to achieve their poetic aims, they will sup- pose a thousand amazing things. Thus far from believing on their word that the overthrow of the Roman Republic was the result of two or three comets, I would also not believe, if non-poets had not said it, that these things appeared at that time. For, in the end, one must realize that a man who is inspired to write a poem is ready to lay hold of all of nature at once. The sky and earth are not to act save by his order; all the elements are not to stir unless he sees fit.... He has need of comets because of the prejudices we already have in regard to them; if he finds them linked to every historical deed, he makes good use of them, and if he doesn't find them, he invents them himself and gives them the ap- pearance and figure the most capable of making it seem that the sky is concerned in the most distinguished manner with the matter at hand.8 Here cometography becomes an elaborate form of imaginative solipsism in which poets are infected by one of the Baconian distempers of learning (Ruskin will call it the pathetic fallacy), as they attempt to please their readers. Poets, and also, as Bayle will later show, certain historians, theologians, politicians, idolators, and atheists, are culpable of transforming comets into mere orna- ments of preconceived ideas. But even as Bayle uses literary discourse as an- other nail in the coffin of astrology, he inadvertently seizes upon one of the reasons why comets have had such symbolic and theological currency. When he declares that a poet "s'est empar6 de toute la Nature en m~me temps," he is invoking that long-standing model of nature-signaled by such metaphors as the Book of Nature, Book of Creation, and Book of the World-that linked the 8 Pierre Bayle, Pensees diverses; Ecrites a" un Docteur de Sorbonne, l'occasion de la comete qui parut au mois de Decembre 1680, ed.

As John Donne suggests when he compares him- self to a meteor, poets turn to comets because like themselves these objects mediate between different planes of existence: the real and the ideal, the sublunary and the superlunary.9 Thus if Foucault is right and the Enlightenment episteme of identity and difference relegates the Renaissance episteme of re- semblance to the safely fenced-off realm of literature, then Bayle's scorn for poets is indicative not only of that exile but also of the rewriting of the divine Book of Nature by the French Encyclopedists for whom Bayle's 1696 Dictionnaire historique et critique was the prototype. In the same skeptical vein Bayle's contemporary, Fontenelle, parodies cometary credulity in his farcical comedy, La comete, first performed in 1681. Making the chief target of his wit an astrologer who, upon the unexpected ap- pearance of the 1680 comet, cancels his daughter's impending marriage, Fontenelle also mocks the long-held hypothesis that a comet's "fire" was fu- eled by "exhalations" from the earth's atmosphere. More specifically still, he employs, as a plot device, a letter from Rome that reports how the ready-made figure of a comet was discovered on an egg. In response, Fontenelle's astrolo- ger exclaims, "Que j'aurois de curiosit6 de voir cet oeuf prodigieux!"10 Such "curiosit6," though, was more widespread in learned circles then we might sup- pose. Indeed, as Sara Schechner Genuth learnedly argues in Comets, Popular Culture, and the Birth of Modern Cosmology, the myriad interpretations of cometary phenomena demonstrate just how difficult it is to distinguish between popular beliefs and scientific hypotheses." This ambiguity, however, was not limited though to Europe. As Elias Trabulse, Antonio Lorente Medina, Victor Navarro Brot6ns, and Andrew Wil- liams, have persuasively demonstrated, it was also translated to the New World, where it was further complicated by the unique historical and cultural contexts produced by the discovery and colonization of the Americas.12 For my part, though, I would add that certain intertextual aspects of Early American 9 John Donne, "To the Countess of Bedford.

For the treatise on comets by the Mexican polymath Carlos de Sigiienza y G6ngora effectively inverts Bayle's critique of the cometary practices of poets. Interpolating verses into his text from Virgil, Francisco de Quevedo, Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz, and others, Sigiienza uses poetry to entertain and teach as the commonplace would have it, but his lesson is one of incredulity rather than credulity. In this his cometography not only would refute the dubious methods and claims of another cometary treatise by the German Jesuit Eusebio Francisco Kino, but it also indicates a larger episte- mological project that resembles the syncretic model of knowledge cultivated by the likes of Caramuel and Athanasius Kircher. Thus notwithstanding his skepticism, like his contemporary in Mexico, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, and one of his sources in Peru, Diego Andr6s Rocha, and his New England counter- part, Increase Mather, Sigiienza is unwilling or unable to separate completely discourses as seemingly unrelated as astronomy, theology, poetry, and what Anthony Pagden identifies as those belonging to the nascent discipline of com- parative ethnology.'3 Seventeenth-century Mexico was, Octavio Paz reminds us, a dynamic cul- ture built atop the living ruins of Aztec history but also one trying to establish a separate creole identity in the face of ubiquitous Spanish influences.'4 Argu- ably, the most remarkable intellectual figures in Nueva Espafia were Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz and Carlos de Sigiienza y G6ngora (1645-1700). While Sor Juana has been the subject of an enormous body of recent scholarship, Sigiienza is only beginning to receive the scholarly attention he deserves.'5 Educated by the Jesuits in the mould of Kircher, Gassendi, and Descartes, Sigiienza was a skilled mathematician and astronomer, a scrupulous calendarist, a groundbreak- ing ethnographer, a meticulous historian, a daring political allegorist, and an influential novelist. His writings, unfortunately many now lost, place him on the threshold of that period of occidental intellectual history in which Baroque polymathesis began to be challenged by Enlightenment rigor. Exemplifying Sigiienza's syncretism is his treatise, Teatro de virtudes politicas, an allegorical exegesis of the triumphal arch which he designed to welcome the new Viceroy to Mexico in September 1680. Here Sigiienza argues that the Viceroy ought to emulate the virtues of various pre-Columbian kings 13 See Anthony Pagden, The Fall of Natural Man: The American Indian and the Origins of Comparative Ethnology (Cambridge, 1986).

After explaining why he feels justified in allegorizing the arriving Viceroy's virtues on the panels in such an extravagant manner, he writes: I do not intend to expand further on this material, since the subject matter that I will decipher already beckons for explanation, but not by way of the sequences of painted boards that everyone saw, but rather according to the chronology of the Aztec Empire, of which I give a most exacting description in a discourse that precedes the almanac that I published for the year 1681, and which I submit to the learned and the curious.16 This allusion to his astrological writings ambiguously sets the stage for a consideration of his cometography, for Brot6ns notes that one of Sigiienza's reluctant duties as University Chair of Astrology and Mathematics was to pre- pare almanacs and lunar calendars."7 Both Brot6ns and Trabulse opine that the almanacs were written mainly for economic reasons,'" while Medina under- scores Sigiienza's "temerity" in making astrological predications in these texts.19 Yet, the issue is complicated by the fact that the Teatro ends with a long pan- egyric poem in which Sigiienza urges: Enter, illustrious, distinguished Marquis, propitious star for the Mexican orb, which despite its humiliating twilight, adores the light of your burning hand; enter, for the sky with its bright constellations awaits your sovereign genius, for in my breast and affection you loosen lightning bolts laying waste to [other] lights.20 '6 Carlos de Sigiienza y G6ngora, Teatro de virtudes politicas, in Seis obras, ed.

Yet the personal manner in which Sigiienza renovates this commonplace also suggests the power, be it imaginative and/or rhetorical, that the astrological paradigm must have had for him. In his Libra astronomica y filos6fica (published 1690, written probably 1682) Sigiienza methodically but also mockingly refutes the largely astrologi- cal and theological claims of another treatise, Exposici6n astron6mica del cometa, by a German Jesuit missionary, Father Eusebio Francisco Kino, who arrived in Mexico in 1681.21 The Libra expands upon arguments made in his now lost treatise Manifiestofilos6fico contra los cometas despojados del impe- rio que tenian sobre los timidos (1681) which was written after Sigiienza- who in 1680 was appointed the Real Cosm6grafo del Reino-witnessed the panic caused by the 1680 comet in the native and creole populations. Works of a just God, comets, the Libra asserts can only be understood through empirical and mathematical investigation. Conceding that scientific inquiry cannot com- pletely discover the true nature of comets, Sigiienza still dismisses the idea that comets presage misfortunes. Thus when the erudite Kino arrived in Mexico City to prepare for his missionary efforts in what now is the Sonora region of Mexico and the American southwest, Sigiienza welcomed him as a potential ally in the struggle against credulity. Kino, however, repaid Sigiienza with the Exposici6n which both fails to mention Sigiienza's work on comets and yet transparently attacks his ideas from an astrological and theological perspec- tive. Since most of the important aspects of this polemic have been examined by Trabulse, Brot6ns, and Medina, I will initially limit myself to rehearsing the major points of contention between Sigiienza and Kino. This, in turn, will al- low a greater focus on certain intertextual elements in Sigiienza's Libra that have received less attention. Trabulse and Medina suggest that political mo- tives may have also informed Kino's Exposici6n; to this end, I would also note how Kino slyly invokes the Virgin of Guadalupe in his treatise's title page, celestial map, prologue, and again in its closing paragraph. Dependent on the viceroy's favor for the undertaking that will win him his greatest fame-as lead missionary and royal cosmographer on the Gulf of California expeditions that explored the provinces of Sonora and Arizona beginning in 1683-Kino, Sigiienza felt, was an arriviste attempting to court favor with a treatise riddled with shoddy logic and worse mathematics.22 21 Carlos de Sigiienza y G6ngora, Libra astronomica y filos6fica, ed.

As a quick glance at Kino and Sigiienza's treatises con- firm, the astronomical and related investigations ofGassendi, Riccioli, Hevelius, Kepler, Kircher, and others exercised enormous influence on both writers. But in his desire to make these authorities his own, Sigfienza challenges Kino's use of the "eruditismo Atanasio" by citing various works of Kircher to refute him, especially the allegorical Itinerarium exstaticum (Rome, 1660).23 Likewise, Sigiienza demonstrates a familiarity with Giambattista Riccioli's Almagestum Novum (Bologna, 1651) and Chronologia reformata (1669) that far outstrips Kino's.24 Sigiienza was also well-informed of the main currents of more skep- tical European thinking on these matters. He has read Gassendi, been apprised of Cassini's recent cometary observations,25 and he cites recent Spanish work in astronomy, most notably that of Vicente Mut, the Mallorcan author of Cometarium anni MDCLXVand Observationes motum coelestium (both 1666), as well as Mexican efforts, especially that of Jose Zaragoza, whose Esphera en comtin y terrdqua (Madrid, 1675) Trabulse calls "a complete treatise of mod- em astronomy," to bolster his attack on Kino's mathematical and observational skills.26 In addition, Sigiienza does not ignore credulous American cometary voices. He devotes considerable space in the Libra to refuting Martin de la Torre, a "Flemish gentleman," living in the Yucatan who wrote the Manifiesto cristiano en favor de los cometas mantenidos en su natural significaci6n. He can barely contain his disdain for Joseph de Escobar Salmer6n y Castro, who taught medicine at Mexico's Real Universidad, and who, in his Discurso cometol6gico y relacidn del nuevo Cometa (1681), asserts, Sigiienza reports, "the frightening proposition that this comet had been formed from the exhala- tion of dead bodies and human sweat."27 23 Libra, 36, 43-45. 24Ibid., 38; see also 55-56. 251bid., 135. 26Ibid., 144; Trabulse, 10. He ignores, though, Pedro Mexia's credulous 1619 Discurso sobre los dos cometas que se vieron por el mes de noviembre del aio pasado de 1618. Mexia- not to be confused with the author of the Silva de varia leccirn-describes the comets as "signs" sent by God "so that we can amend our evil ways." Other early seventeenth-century Iberian astrological treatises on comets include: Onofre Pelejai, Discurso de la naturaleza, causas, y efectos de las cometas: primero en general y despubs en particular de que se han visto en el aiio (Valencia, 1619); Juan Casiano, Breve discurso a cerca del cometa visto en el mez de Noviembre deste ai-o de 1618 y sus significaciones (Lisbon, 1618); Antonio Luciano, Discurso mathematico sobre los dos cometas que se han parecido, en las quales se declaran los efectos que muestran por los signos y sefiales, a donde se vieron primero. El uno desde doze de Noviembre deste presente aiio de 1618. Y el otro desde 24 de dicho mes. Ponense sus generales significaciones (Valencia, 1618). Francisco de Artiga's Discurso de la naturaleza, propriedades, causas, y effectos de los cometas, y en particular del que apareci6 en el Deziembre de 1680 (Huesca, 1681), which cites Raymond Lull as its main authority, would have appeared too late to be critiqued by Sigiienza. 27 Libra, 19.</page><page sequence="9">Early American Cometography 407 In response to Kino's lack of intellectual generosity, Sigiienza frames the Libra as a defense of Mexican science in the light of perceived European con- descension: They think in some parts of Europe, and especially in the northern countries, as they are more remote, that not only the Indians, original inhabitants of these lands, but also that those of us of Spanish descent are born by mere chance or that we go about on two legs by divine dispensation; or that even if they avail themselves of English micro- scopes, rationality will barely be found in us.28 Such satire, I would argue, has just as fundamental a role in the Libra as its mathematical proofs that aim to establish the comet's parallax and correct posi- tions. Taken together they form part of what Fernand Hallyn calls, "the poetics of hypothesis," or that "original synthesis that as a totality requires a study sui generis of the structure and interaction of the elements that frame and inform it."29 Likewise, part of this "synthesis" is Sigiienza's intertextuality. Subtly re- affirming and subverting the intertextual nature of early modern scientific dis- course, Sigiienza at once appeals to and rejects the authority of Virgil, Lucan, Manilius, Terence, Palingenius, and other poets to demonstrate Kino's errors. For instance, Sigiienza quotes Gassendi's interpretation of Georgics, I. 84-93, to show that Virgil doubted that comets cause drought; but elsewhere he cites Georgics, I. 487-88 ("non alias caelo ceciderunt plura sereno / fulgura nec diri totiens arsere cometae"), which describes the portents accompanying Caesar's death in 44 BCE, only to brand them a "poetic judgment" lacking any empirical proof.30 Thus his skepticism toward poetic authorities is by no means absolute. Indeed, later in the treatise, Sigiienza invokes the poet who along with G6ngora has come to epitomize Spanish Baroque poetry: I beseech the reverend father to place among the sententiae, proverbs, maxims, and aphorisms of the poets whose verses serve as a second foundation for him, those verses which in his Parnassus, Francisco de Quevedo Villegas, the great glory of the Spanish nation, dictated with no less truth than grace. Not only on account of the copia of books he left us, but owing to how ... he makes himself master of the will of those who read with veneration and delight his numerous books. 28 Libra, 85. 29 Femand Hallyn, The Poetic Structure of the World: Copernicus and Kepler, tr.

Leslie (New York, 1993), 15. 30Libra, 53-54, 82.</page><page sequence="10">408 Christopher Johnson Then he quotes a poem he attributes to Quevedo; the first and last quintillas read: No comet is culpable, misfortune has no heralds because to die in torment, envy's enough for the courtier and worry's plenty for the king. [I...] When an author disturbs the world with comets and foresees an evil future, he's a poor prophet, and of the sort, I'm sure, who always commits an error.31 But when we check these verses against all known versions of Quevedo's twenty-five line poem, "Juicio moral de los cometas," the last quintilla, it seems, is Sigiienza's, not Quevedo's.32 By thus piggybacking on Quevedo's fame and acerbic poem, Sigiienza further politicizes the comet controversy-by playing on class differences-even as he creates a new poetic frame in which to view it. His paronomasia on "cometas" and "yerro cometa" suggests how attention to the material nature of signs can promote the critique of credulity that has come to be associated with Enlightenment science. For by refusing to make the comet into a mere term in a poetic conceit, Sigtienza outdoes Quevedo's own unchar- acteristic rejection of the principle of correspondence that informs so much of Spanish conceptista poetry and which forms also the basis of Graciatn's semi- nal theory of the conceit.33 This refusal has epistemological consequences as well; for elsewhere Sigiienza, citing Kircher as his authority, cautions his read- ers not to accept the analogy between microcosmos and macrocosmos as a source of material causation; at best, a comet can only have a notional, sym- bolic meaning.34 In sum, by rejecting analogy as a mode of thought in cometography, Sigiienza rejects the mode preferred by most Renaissance natu- 31Libra, 71-72: "Ninguin cometa es culpado, / ni hay signo de mala ley, / pues para morir penado, / la envidia basta al privado / y el cuidado sobra al rey.... Luego autor que al mundo inquieta / con cometas, y futuro / previene mal, mal profeta / es y del tal yo aseguro / que siempre yerro cometa." See Francisco de Quevedo, Poesia original completa, ed. J. M. Blecua (Barcelona, 1996), 141. 321 owe this claim to William G. Bryant; see his edition of the Libra (in Seis obras), 407.

Finally, Quevedo's poem may well have influ- enced his most famous seventeenth-century acolyte, the Brazilian Baroque poet, Gregorio de Matos (1633-96), who wrote the satiric, punning, "Efeitos sao do Cometa" in 16 ten-verse stanzas, arte menor, on the topic of incongruities.36 Here, as Matos's constant wordplay reminds the reader just how easily the material sign of a celestial object can be manipulated, the comet becomes the occasion to mock those who would absurdly link the little world of man with grand cosmic events. The most eccentric, epistemologically curious use of poetry in the treatise occurs right before Sigiienza begins his mathematical demonstrations. Here he blames Kino for first citing in the dedication various "learned authors" to sup- port his idea that the comet promises benign things, but then calling these same authors "nada" and "locos" in the book proper.37 To clinch his polemic, though, Sigiienza flirts himself with another species of contradiction: [Kino] could also have done (in order not to expose himself to error in his cometary threats) what Johannes Sturm, Louvain doctor, did, and arrange verses or periods in the form that they call retrograde or reflowing so that, reading them as events dictate, his believability would remain always intact. I offer here some of those that the illustrious Juan Caramuel gives us in his Metametricum. I do so in order to con- clude pleasantly the examination of his ill-conceived ideas and so that it might be seen without fear of error one can say anything one likes about comets; and also so that the reader may rest from the bother that such inconsequential things will have caused him and at the same time that the labor may be admired with which this diligent author con- structed an entire book in the same form that these verses have.38 35 See Maurice Slawinski, "Rhetoric and Science / Rhetoric of Science / Rhetoric as Sci- ence," Science, Culture and Popular Belief in Renaissance Europe, eds.

In the first poem, that is, Caramuel urges the comet to "ito retro" in order not to cause disaster; in the second poem he implores: "non retro ito" because he desires the comet's benign influence.39 In this way, poetic ingenium ironically demonstrates epistemological uncertainty. A word or two about Caramuel and the text Sigiienza cites: Juan Caramuel de Lobkowitz (1606-82), "the most fertile, erudite polymath of his century,"40 wrote on a myriad of subjects ranging from theology to Aztec arithmetic, and he corresponded with Descartes, Gassendi, and Kircher, as well as Sigiienza himself. In terms of method, though, "he was more ingenious than judicious, more marvelous than practical."41 Such ingenuity fuels the third volume of the Metametricum, which catalogues and illustrates every conceivable, however far-fetched, Latin stanzaic form. Sigiienza thus uses Caramuel much like he uses Quevedo: as masters of Baroque poetics, both are cited to prove a strictly rational thesis. In both instances Sigiienza wishes to provoke admiratio in his readers; but he also thereby insists on the rhetorical nature of scientific dis- course. His use of this protean verse form confirms his unwillingness to sepa- rate his cometography from literary and rhetorical traditions. By showing how one can argue both sides of a question or, as with Kino, how one can write an entire book arguing both sides of a question, Sigiienza mocks the notion fos- tered by the history of cometography that "without fear of error one can say anything one likes about comets." More generally, like Bacon, he would com- bat the kind of skepticism exemplified by Agrippa's On the Vanity of the Hu- man Sciences. To do so he ironically adapts the ancient method of controversia in which both sides of an issue (in utramque partem) are argued. Yet the irony goes both ways: Sigiienza intends to mock Kino by adopting what for Cicero and Erasmus was the only reasonable way to resolve an issue, but what, con- versely, was in the Skeptical tradition-think of the early Montaigne-a method that produced epistemological uncertainty.42 The literary and cultural resonance of this debate becomes richer still when we consider that soon after Sigiienza wrote his initial treatise attacking Kino's, his sometime friend and collaborator, Sor Juana, penned a sonnet entitled: "Aplaude la ciencia astron6mica del Padre Eusebio Francisco Kino, de la 39 The first two lines of the first poem reads: "Interitum id sidus radians, haud nunciat ortum / Principis: ito retro, non bona vaticinor." The last two lines of the second poem read: "Vaticinor bona, non retro ito; principis ortum / Nunciat, haud radians sidus in interitum." As Brot6ns notes (175), Vicente Mut cites these same verses to conclude his 1666 treatise. 40 Marcelino Menendez Pelayo, Historia de las ideas esteticas en Espania (Madrid, 1974), I, 798. 41 D.

Such epideixis is explicable, Paz argues, only if the complicated stringencies of patronage in the Mexican court are consid- ered.43 Kino, that is, had dedicated his treatise to the Viceroy whose wife was Sor Juana's most important patroness. From an epistemological standpoint, however, Sor Juana's poem reads in a less contingent manner. Indeed, we might recall that poet's philosophic epyllion, "Primero sueiio," for all its Cartesian echoes, is rather traditional in its approach to astronomy.44 Yet even as the Ba- roque rhetoric of the "Suefio" depends upon the astrological, microcosmic- macrocosmic world-view, it often undermines this episteme by exploring the disjunctions and disillusionments of poetic subjectivity. Likewise, her sonnet lauding Kino defiantly presents the seeker of knowledge as a scribe copying the divine Book of Nature even as the specters of ignorance and failure haunt her lines: Although the sky's pure light is clear, clear the moon and clear the stars, and clear the ephemeral sparks that the air uplifts and the blaze hastens; although the sunshine is clear, and the lightning leaves in its wake awesome light in the obscure dusk; all sluggish human knowl- edge was obscure and mortal plumes were unable to be, with urgent flight, Icari of rational discourse, until your pen, sovereign Eusebio, illuminated the celestial lights.45 Sor Juana's slippery rhetoric of clarity and obscurity depends here on what Hans Blumenberg calls the "absolute metaphor" of illumination, or that arche- typal, irreducible metaphor that represents the experience of intuition.46 It also reshapes the myth of Icarus in a manner prefiguring those verses in the "Suefio" where Sor Juana paints herself as flying too close to the sun in search of intui- tive certainty.47 I wonder, then, if there's not a touch of irony in figuring Kino as 43 Sigiienza lauds Sor Juana in the Preludio III of the Teatro de virtudes politicas, and Sor Juana returns the favor in her sonnet "Dulce, canoro Cisne Mexicano."

For if Sor Juana has accepted Kino's astrological interpretation of comets then, despite the title of her sonnet, the interloping Jesuit becomes not just a symbol of wisdom but potentially an un- welcome, ominous sign as well. Unfortunately, we have no record of Sigiienza's response to this poem. But another early American cometary voice throws further light on the intertextual nature of the tension between the astronomical and astrological perspectives. In his Libra, Sigiienza cites a contemporary Peruvian, Diego Andres Rocha, as someone supporting his skeptical position. In the passage quoted by Sigiienza, Rocha, also meditating on the appearance of the 1680 comet, argues that Francesco Giuntini, author of the well-known Speculum astrologiae and one of Kino's principal sources as well, had no "razon filos6fica" upon which to base his divinations of a comet's effects.48 Besides, adds Rocha, the tail of the 1680 comet-the direction of the tail was an integral factor in astrological predic- tion-was seen at different times to point in various cardinal directions. Since this reliance on empirical evidence was precisely the approach urged in the Libra, it behooves us to ask: who was Sigiienza's apparent ally in rationalism, and how should his citation of Rocha be viewed in the context of the history of science in the Americas? Rocha (1607-88) is principally remembered for two treatises published in Lima in one volume in 168 1: Tratado unico y singular del origen de los indios occidentales del Perui, Mixico, Santa Fe y Chile and Copia de carta que el autor escrivi6 a su hijo ... sobre el cometa del anio de 1680.49 This remarkable juxtaposition of topics is indicative not only of the syncretic approach to sci- ence which we already saw exemplified by Sigiienza (who it is clear from his citation knew both treatises), but it also speaks to the desire on the part of the late seventeenth-century creole mentalitW to master, if not understand, what Michel de Certeau calls the heterological-whether such alterity be ethnographic or astronomical. In other words, the inexplicable presence of advanced civili- zations in the Western Hemisphere, like the marvelous appearance of comets, were both conundrums which threatened scientific and theological assump- tions. Both phenomena challenged the notion of a stable, hierarchical universe whose microcosmic center was European man. In El origen de los indios, Rocha, chiefly through comparative mythology, linguistics, and (some very tendentious) logic, develops the thesis that the indios 48Libra, 328. 49 The full title of the latter text is Copia de carta que el autor escrivi6 a su hijo el General Don Juan Enriquez de Sanguesa, Residente en la Villa de Cochabamba, dondefue corregidor Justicia Mayor; sobre el cometa del airo de 1680.

And though Bartolom6 de las Casas, Diego Durin, and Gregorio Garciai had also argued that the indios were of Semitic origin, Rocha's proto-ethnology again allies him with Sigiienza, whose lifelong interest in Mexico's indigenous cul- tures was reflected in the unfortunately no longer extant treatises, Historia del imperio de los chichimecas, Ciclografia mexicana, La genealogia de los reyes mexicanos, Calendario de los meses yfiestas de los mexicanos, and Finix del Occidente which identified the Aztec god Quetzalc6atl with the apostle St. Thomas who, it was argued, visited the Americas in the course of his evangeli- cal journeys. For his part, though, Rocha gives the indios a Spanish origin as well as a Semitic one when he argues that these lost tribes inhabited pre-Roman Spain before they left for Atlantis. In this way, the conquest and colonization of the Americas uncannily promises a kind of patriotic, racial reunion. Rocha's text, however, rich with classical learning and philological examples, reads less fantastically than this brief summary of his thesis might suggest. His nu- merous gestures at historical objectivity, as well as the appeal that his thesis must have had to his fellow creoles, make his treatise a noteworthy moment in the period's cultural and intellectual history. Likewise, his Epistle on comets charts the murky boundaries separating science and culture albeit in a less ambitious manner. Taking a position some- where between the astrological and astronomical world-views, Rocha is wary of accepting any observation or hypothesis lacking a "raqon philosophica." Yet he still accepts the general notion that comets, "God's messengers and legates," are signs that "indicate misfortunes and punishments for the world."'0 Arguing first that comets are superlunary objects, he cites various authorities including Pliny, Kepler, Cardan, Cysat, and Tycho Brahe, but when he turns his attention to the 1680 comet, Rocha allows his imagination free reign when searching for anthropomorphic analogues: ... this comet is what Juntino [Giuntini] called the soldier and the Ar- abs square, if not in longitude than in the great part of its latitude, for the head and the neck are thinner, and the rest of the body covered down to the feet with a tunic of mail. This signifies the warrior's feroc- ity ... and to my mind this comet not only looks like a soldier dressed in mail, but indeed it looks like an army of them with many feet: one for many, as Virgil writes: "Armato milite complent"....51 Here Rocha seems unable to refrain from the kind of analogical reasoning which Foucault makes the hallmark of the sixteenth-century approach to knowledge. So Rocha, Colecci6n de libros raros, 148. 51 Ibid., 154-55.</page><page sequence="16">414 Christopher Johnson Indeed, his main authority in the Epistle is the sixteenth-century Florentine astrologer, Francesco Giuntini, "considered another Ptolemy,"52 who is best known for his enormous work-the final edition runs to 2483 pages-Specu- lum astrologiae (first published 1573, but greatly augmented in subsequent editions). The Speculum contains an edition of and commentary on Sacrobosco's Sphaera, a long commentary on Ptolemy, over 400 horoscopes of famous indi- viduals, treatises on medical astrology and eclipses, a calendar that Claudio Cannistra describes as "Astrologico e Poetico," and a neo-Aristotelian treatise on comets and judicial astrology.53 It is this last text, Tractatio utilis &amp; lectu digna de cometarum causis, effectibus, differentiis, et eorundem proprietatibus, that Rocha cites numerous times in support of his cometography.54 More a com- pendium than an attempt at original analysis, De cometis, as it is usually dubbed, invokes Seneca, Pliny, Callisthenes, Ptolemy, Plutarch, Aristotle, Averroes, Albumasar, and various unnamed "Arabs" as authorities. It also argues that the color, shape, and influence of the comet depend on its position in the sky and proximity to particular planets and constellations. Leaning on Aristotle's theory that comets are formed from terrestrial exhalations, Giuntini also offers a fully astrological theory of celestial influences-a comet in the proximity of Saturn will cause "melancholy diseases, fevers, or plagues, or quartan agues," the lat- ter including epilepsy, cancer, leprosy, paralysis, and hemorrhoids.55 Most im- portantly, Giuntini reads comets as portentous signs whose meaning is guaran- teed by history and God: Comets are evidence, by which it is made known, that all of nature is governed by some intelligence. And thus in this way effects [impres- siones] arise in the air not at random, nor do they exist by chance. Experiences prove that these are signs. Therefore they are placed by poets and astrologers among the signs, even though they have obscurer meanings than the stars themselves.56 While Sigiienza dubs Giuntini a "ridiculously superstitious astrologer," intriguingly, he also cites the Speculum and the De cometis as supplying evi- 52 Rocha, Colecci6n de libros raros, 147. 53 Claudio Cannistra, "L'astrologia in Toscana nel '500," http://www.cidaregioni.it/it/Toscana/ convengo_2000/astrologia_in_toscana_nel500.htm. 54 The full title is: Tractatio utilis &amp; lectu digna de Cometarum causis, effectibus, differentiis, et eorundum proprietatibus.

Alternately, Rocha's dependence on Giuntini as an authority ought not lead to the conclusion that the Peruvian's approach is essentially astrological. Instead, Giuntini provides the mathematically-chal- lenged Rocha with an analogical discourse with which to describe what would otherwise would have remained an incomprehensible phenomenon. But by borrowing Giuntini's nomenclature, Rocha shifts his attention fur- ther towards the signifier and away from the signified, as he considers whether the 1680 comet was not a cometa miles (a knight comet) but rather a cometa pertica (a pole or rod comet)-an important distinction since this latter type heralds drought.58 Others who observed the comet with him thought it had the form of a "broom," and this is significant because "the broom is a symbol that signifies punishment and the whip of God to clean and purge the world by sending wars and other calamities."59 While another observer, adept at deci- phering hieroglyphics, thought it looked like a fox's tail, and "the fox is a sym- bol of deceit and cleverness."60 Rocha, however, is not entirely blind to what Foucault calls in his analysis of the pre-Enlightenment episteme, "the plethoric yet absolutely poverty-stricken character of this knowledge."61 Stepping back from his catalogue of analogies, he concludes his exegesis of the symbolic importance of the comet by conceding: "But all of this is frivolous talk, without a philosophical basis."62 Though we may be sure, he affirms, that comets signal misfortunes, to say what particular misfortunes will occur and when they will transpire is beyond human knowledge. "What should vex you," he warns his son, "is when anyone says anything specific about this comet."63 This same ambivalence is manifested later in the treatise when Rocha, in the bestfulgurator tradition, interprets an unprecedented incident in which two lightning bolts hit the Cerro de San Crist6bal in Lima. First musing that they prefigure two victories over "enemy pirates," he then quotes some verses by an unnamed poet to support his claim, only to end by asserting: "But all this is mere wit [agudeza], and it is worth what you will."64 In this way, poetry and astrological prognostication ultimately come to have the same ambiguous epis- temological value for Rocha. An even more skeptical tone is adopted when Rocha reacts to a letter by a Spanish chair of mathematics, Fulgencio Vergel, 57Libra, 272, 284. But on 381 he is dismissed with other astrologers who habitually contra- dict themselves. 58 Rocha, Colecci6n de libros raros, 159. 59Ibid., 161. 60 Ibid., 162. 61 Foucault, The Order of Things, 30. 62 Rocha, 162. 63Ibid., 164. 64Ibid., 169.</page><page sequence="18">416 Christopher Johnson who concludes that the 1680 comet "was the shape of a broad sword, and threat- ens plague."65 Rocha comments: Much is needed to oppose a chair of mathematics, but in the reports it appears that the very same comet appeared with one form, color, and size here in America and with others in Europe. Here it appeared like a whip, broom, soldier dressed from head to toe in mail, like a fox's tail, and opening up at the end, like branches and twigs. In Cartagena ... they say ... that it appeared, from its neck down, like a piece of wool, all stretched out.66 This leads Rocha to ask: "[I]f its form cannot be ascertained, what is to be made of its effects?" Faced with such epistemological confusion, Rocha sheep- ishly concludes his treatise with the admission that whatever might be the exact mechanics of the comet's baleful influence, such malignity must be defeated with prayer, good works, and charity. The last instance that I wish to adduce of the early American reception of the 1680 comet occurs two years later in North America, when in 1683 In- crease Mather-Harvard President, Puritan minister, and father of Cotton Mather-published Kometographia, Or a Discourse Concerning Comets. And while he borrows from Gadbury's De cometis (1665) and Hooke's Cometa (1678), Mather also cites many of the same authorities used by Kino, Sigiienza, and Rocha.67 His belief in the prophetic, signifying function of comets is un- equivocal. As John Sherman's prefatory "To the Reader" declares: ... Comets are ordinarily the forerunners of disasterous Calamities, Mischiefs and Miseries, hastening to follow and fall down on the heads of the senseless and seare sinners.... If it be said that some of these Periwigged Heralds have appeared on the aetherial stage upon a more benign account: it may be rationally replied, that the number of such is very small: and that their blasting influences, might be direfully opera- tive in remoter and less known parts of the Earth.68 65 Rocha, Coleccion de libros raros, 172. 66 Ibid. 67 See Robinson, The Great Comet of 1680, 73-76; Williams, "Increase Mather and the Comets of 1680 and 1682," paragraphs 28-33. 68 Increase Mather, Kometographia, Or a Discourse Concerning Comets; Wherein the Na- ture of Blazing Stars in Enquired into: With an Historical Account of all the Comets which have appeared from the Beginning of the World unto this present Year, M.DC.LXXXII.

In the same vein, Mather preached two sermons prompted by comets, in 1681 and 1682 respectively, which Andrew Williams reads as reflecting the rhetoric of the Puritan jeremiad.69 Mather's interpretation of God's Two Books in the Kometographia, however, extends beyond New England; commenting on the 1516 comet, he wryly contributes to the Spanish Black Legend: A Comet of a Lunar nature was seen for some dayes. The King of Spain died. The next year Luther began to declare against indulgences. Soon after which the great Commotions and Mutations followed throughout all Antichristendome. Now did the merciless Spaniards fall upon the Indians inhabiting Terra firma, where they were murdered above four Millions of Souls.70 Still, if "[c]omets are forerunners of some great and commonly miserable Events hastening upon the World," Mather is unable to say if and how the causality of such a relation occurs.71 Although at one point he muses that there might be an analogy between the means by which the sun's beams reach us and how the comet's malign influences affect us, ultimately, Mather seems to view these "Periwigged Heralds" as mere signs rather than actual causes of misfor- tune: The reasons alleged by some to prove that Comets have a physical influence into such effects are not solid. I should therefore rather con- clude, that they are signs of such things to follow only in respect of their Universal and supernatural cause, God having ordained them for that end that to the Inhabitants of the World, when they behold such fearful sights might thereby be awakened into repentance.72 Here, despite his initial appeal to empirical "reasons," Mather, like Rocha, ultimately resolves his epistemological uncertainty by appealing to theological truths. 69 See Williams, "Increase Mather and the Comets of 1680 and 1682," paragraph 5. Mather preached in 1681, Heavens Alarm to the World. Or a Sermon Wherein is Showed that Fearful Sights and Signs in Heaven are the Presages of Great Calamities at Hand. In 1682, provoked by the comet that would later be christened after Edmund Halley, Mather delivered The Voice of God in Signal Providences. 70 Mather, Kometographia, 95.

Mather thus ends his treatise by citing Guillame de Salluste du Bartas's 1581 La sepmaine, the epic, cosmographic poem which had such wide-reaching influence on seventeenth-century European literature and thought. Using Josuah Sylvester's translation, Mather interpolates: There, with long Bloody hair, a Blazing Star Threatens the World with Famin, Plague &amp; War: To Princes death; to Kingdomes many crosses: To all Estates, inevitable losses: To Herdsmen, Rot; to Plowmen hapless Seasons: To Saylors, Storms: to Cities civil Treasons.74 Echoing verses by Lucan and Virgil, elsewhere in the poem du Bartas inge- niously emphasizes the theological significance of comets. Describing the ex- pulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden, he compares Gabriel's "waving sword, whose bodie shined bright" to a "flaming Comet in the midst of night."75 John Milton, in turn, imitates this very trope at the end of Paradise Lost (1674): The brandished sword of God before them blazed Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat, And vapor as the Libyan air adust, Began to parch that temperate clime; whereat In either hand the hast'ning angel caught Our ling'ring parents, and to th' eastern gate Led them direct ... (12.633-39).76 Thus both Du Bartas and Milton refashion a commonplace of late Renais- sance astrological cometography, namely the comet shaped as a sword that menacingly hung over Jerusalem during the time of Josephus.77 But here the comet threatens all humanity-not only the Jews. Indeed, Milton earlier in the poem gives a comet powerful new metaphoric currency when he compares Satan to a comet: 73 Williams, "Increase Mather and the Comets of 1680 and 1682," paragraphs 1-34, esp. 26. 74 Mather, Kometographia, 143. Du Bartas's original verses are more elliptical: "Un aster estincelant / Menace en autre part d'un crin presque sanglant / De gresle les bouviers, les pasteurs de pillage, / Les citoyens d'esmeute, et les nochers d'orage." 75 Du Bartas, The Divine Weeks (11. 637-38), I, 356. 76 John Milton, Paradise Lost, ed.

(2.707-11) Milton, it is surmised, was inspired here either by the 1618 comet or the famous 1604 supernova.78 Given this essay's chronological focus, though, I might recall that his remarkable revisiting of the astrological and theological worldview occurs twelve years before the publication of Newton's Principia (1686), whose third volume mathematically proves that comets can have ellip- tical, eccentric, and thus periodic orbits. The Principia is prefaced by a panegyric poem in which Edmund Halley- following Galileo whose study of the 1618 comet led him to declare that math- ematics was the legible script of the Creation79-proclaims: Now we know The sharply veering ways of comets, once A source of dread, nor longer do we quail Beneath appearances of bearded stars.s0 Liberated from "dread," Halley and Newton, nonetheless, never ceased in subsequent years to read comets as theological objects integral to God's eschatology.81 Though the Englishmen eschewed the fire and brimstone rheto- ric of Mather's Puritan sermons and Kometographia, they did contemplate with great precision the apocalyptic effects of a cometary collision with the sun, the earth, or other planets. More to the point, Newton calculated that the 1680 comet nearly missed hitting the sun, whereas Halley deduced that it came fright- eningly close to theearth. No longer a "sign" either in Mather's or Milton's sense, the 1680 comet continued to herald the possibility of doom. Harvard University. 78 See William B.
