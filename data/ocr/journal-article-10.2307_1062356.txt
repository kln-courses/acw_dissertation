<plain_text><page sequence="1">Johannes Maringer P R I E S T S AN D PRIESTESSES IN PREHISTORIC EUROPE In the history of religions priests and priestesses represent high sacral personages. Their specific character consists of being invested by a community as supernaturally authorized mediators to the transcendental world for the performance of the public cult. There is a difference, however, between the tasks of the professional priesthood and those priestly functions which could be performed by other persons-heads of families, chieftains, or dynastic rulers; furthermore, there is a difference between permanent and tem- porary priesthood. Some of the socioeconomic and ideological conditions necessary to support a professional priesthood are the following: a dif- ferentiated economy with a settled way of life, including leisure for spiritual activities; the existence of a production surplus, the material foundation of rich sacrificial custom requiring special ritual members; and the existence of cult centers requiring priests or priestesses for daily worship or for conducting seasonal cere- monies. To their specific obligations belong the offering of prayers; thankgivings in free or traditional form; performance of sacrifices of food, drink, incense, or the like; recitation of myths and holy texts; songs or hymns, sometimes accompanied by ritual dance; consecration or blessing of human beings, animals, plants, locali- 101</page><page sequence="2">Priests and Priestesses ties, or other objects; performance of symbolic acts, especially uniting the community with God; dramatization of myths; and the guarding of sanctuaries and cult objects, in part of their own producing, on grounds of supernatural authorization. Conse- quently, priests and priestesses are considered the guarantors of world and community order, contributing to the spiritual welfare of the society as well as of the individual. How far are these characteristic traits reflected in prehistoric findings, in the mute material in the hands of archaeologists ? We have two kinds of evidence to work with. Direct evidence consists of prehistoric art in caves, on rocks, on the walls of stone chambers for the dead, or on ceramic and metallic vessels which depicts persons in priestly dress leading religious rites such as sacrifices, ritual dances, processions, or the offering of prayers. Sometimes sculptured figures of priests or priestesses are also found. Indirect evidence is given when we discover graves containing personages invested with priestly insignia or emblems, when we find sanc- tuaries, or when we know of isolated finds of such emblems. As we will see later in this article, archaeologists have often hinted in their reports, which are more or less convincing, that these inter- pretations of the findings are correct. There have been several studies of ancient priesthood.1 None of them refer, however, to prehistoric material, but rely exclusively on material relating to the protohistoric cultures of the Oriental world. The same is true regarding contributions in encyclopedias, even those specializing in prehistoric archaeology.2 Therefore, it will be of interest to the historian of religions to have a study on this subject that fills the gap. There are no finds from the early Paleolithic that point to the existence of a priesthood. In fact, we know very little about the spiritual behavior of the hunters and foodgatherers of that period. However, we do have evidence from the period of Neanderthal man, the middle Paleolithic (ca. 120,000-30,000 B.C.); we have found a complex which shows the burial of a high personage, a tribal chieftain, who appears to have also been the tribe's priest. In 1957, E. Bonifay and B. Vandermeersch discovered an astonish- 1 G. Landmann, The Origin of Priesthood (Ekenaes, 1904); A. Horneffer, Der Priester.

In the following years Bonifay scientifically excavated the site and found within a moundlike stone heap the skeletal remains of a Mousterian man. The burial mound was supported by a wall of stone slabs. Behind that was found a heavy 2-square-meter slab; on it two carefully constructed stone boxes were placed containing numerous animal bones, especially of bears. Below an 800-kilogram block of stone a pit was discovered in the cave floor; in the pit were found the skull and bones of a brown bear, which may have been cut into pieces before it was placed there. Behind that a wall-like stone pile blocked the whole construction which, according to the excavator, forms a unit. According to his opinion the whole complex was probably constructed in a rather short time and by a preconceived plan by which local materials were skillfully utilized for the shaping of this sector of the cave.3 Who was this Neanderthal man that had been buried at such an expense ? He was certainly a high-ranking member of a hunters' group or tribe who gathered together from time to time for joint hunting, for seasonal meetings, and above all for rites such as sacrifice, dance, etc. To all appearances he was a chief, but at the same time also a spiritual leader or priest. The bones contained in the stone boxes and the skeleton of the bear in the pit signify, according to the excavator, offerings that were probably con- nected with a bear cult. From the Upper Paleolithic (ca. 30,000-10,000 B.C.) we have more finds that seem to contain the remains of ritual persons, male as well as female, and there is much discussion of whether they were shamans, sorcerers/sorceresses, or priests/priestesses. But the conditions for priesthood given earlier are mostly all in evidence, for example, cult centers and sanctuaries in fixed locations showing a surplus of material production and the existence of leisure time; furthermore, we have found pictures of ritual scenes, engraved and painted figures, statuettes, and sculptures in relief. Experts of the famous cave art of this period agree that as far as can be determined by skill and style, very few of the cave 3 E. Bonifay and B.

The gift of painting allowed these members of the society to occupy a high position. This was no ars pro arte, however, but was connected instead with the hunt and with game, with the economic welfare of the society, and, most important, with the animal world, mastered by superhuman beings, spirits (Tierherr/in), or a divine creator. Therefore the destruction of a creature that was prized and loved by its divine master or mistress, yet having to kill it in order to live, incurred the displeasure of the supernatural world, and the resulting mental conflict was ritually symbolized and resolved by art. The emotional catharsis experienced by the hunting society after participation in ritual dance has been stressed by all authors on the subject,4 and these dances are often represented in Paleolithic art on cave walls as well as on slabs, bones, antlers, and ivory. They reflect cere- monies of the same kind practiced in life. One of the most vivid representations is the famous Sorcier in the cave of the Trois- Freres, Ariege, France-a 75-centimeter-high therioanthropic figure dancing above an immense number of animals.5 Were the artists perhaps priests? The term "sorcerer" was attached to these figures at a time when ice age art was explained by sympathetic magic, and the artists and the disguised beings were thought to be magicians. This supposition can no longer be supported in the light of recent studies.6 As K. J. Narr writes: "Even if one would consider the reference to anthropological parallels to interpret Paleolithic rock-art feasible and useful at all, one becomes extremely skeptical about the unambiguous explana- tion of the art as picture magic and is rather inclined to see it as cultic or religious in nature."7 While the sorcerer in a magic Weltverstdndnis believes that he is able, by means of personal manipulations and occult practices, to seize an impersonal, pluralistic power, the shaman believes in spirits; he tries to acquire their help by means of personal guardian spirits who get him in touch with the spirit world, thus enabling 4 See P.

The most important structural element of shamanism is the trance-the journey to the other world.8 The shaministic interpretation of Paleolithic finds has several times been advanced by authors9 and critically discussed or refused by others.10 According to Narr, Paleolithic art shows some shamanistic traits, such as characteristic dress, harts' horns, bird attributes (spiritual assistants for the journey to the other world), and even trance or ecstasy. However, these traits are not con- vincingly shamanistic, in the sense of Siberian shamanism, but can be explained in other ways. Moreover, A. P. Okladnikov, the prominent expert on Siberian prehistory, stresses that Siberian shamanism was born much later, during the Neolithic (4000- 3000 B.C.).1l If neither sorcerers nor shamans were the unknown artists and leaders of the ceremonies and rites (initiation rites have been dis- covered in the French cave of Tuc d'Audoubert, Ariege), were they tribal priests? For H. Breuil and A. Leroi-Gourhan12 the orna- mented caves were "sanctuaries." The art, as a rule, was placed in the most remote parts of the caves-in halls, niches, and in hardly accessible upper galleries, obviously guarded by an Arkandisziplin (natural and artificial obstacles and signs of prohibition), and hidden to unauthorized people; moreover, according to Leroi-Gourhan,13 many of them had seldom been visited, whereas the most open ones show traces of intense usage. In both cases they were places for ceremonies, in the first case 8 See D. Schroder, "Zur Struktur des Schamanismus," Anthropos 50 (1955): 854; H. N. Michael, Studies in Siberian Shamanism.

The ceremonies consisted of engraving, reengraving, painting, repainting, dancing, and other rites. At any rate, these ceremonies required a spiritual or religious leader, a priest or a numenologische Relationsperson, as R. Pittioni15 prefers to call them. H. Breuill6 has called the sorcerer of the Trois Freres a god and gives to the ice age art a religious background; likewise, A. Leroi-Gourhan sees the origin of the art in religion and speaks of "l'art religieux."17 As we have already mentioned, Narr also points to a religious background, which to him is found in a phenomenon occurring among recent hunting tribes called "animalism." These tribes maintain close ties between animal and man, which are filled up with ritual and mythical content. How- ever, Leroi-Gourhan explains this by a symbolic complex of dualistic character ("symboles de la creation").18 Be this as it may, the spiritual leaders of the rites appear to have been tribal priests, very probably priest and artist at the same time, perhaps even chief and priest in personal union. In other parts of Europe, in ice-free eastern and northern Europe, for example, we have open-air sanctuaries with marks of sacrificial ceremonies. Thus at Eliseevichi in the Ukraine there was discovered an oval heap of bones, which consisted of parts of more than thirty mammoths and was surrounded by twenty-seven skulls, twenty-seven tusks of young mammoths, and ten lamellas of ivory, some of which were richly engraved. A corridor 1-11 meters wide led to this complex, and at the bottom of the heap was found a 152-centimeter-high female statuette of ivory.19 Another sacrificial site was discovered in Borcevo near Kostjenki on the Don River. It is situated on the outside of the camp of the hunters and consists of a stone block 2 meters behind a semicircular layer of piled-up slabs, heaps of horse bones, and two carbonized areas 14 Breuil, p. 23. 15 R.

During the first postglacial period, the Mesolithic (ca. 10,000/ 8000-5000 B.C.), socioeconomic conditions were not favorable for the existence of priests or priestesses. The successors of the Paleolithic hunters had abandoned the old centers of life and cult, living as fishermen and hunters of smaller animals on dunes along rivers, lakes, and seashores where they formed only small groups. They did not produce great art but only decorated small objects, especially bones or antlers, and only in a rather schematic style. In a larger camp of hunters at Star Carr in east England there were found twenty-four masks made from skulls of stags which must have served for ritual dances. The antlers were cut off and the stumps were hollowed out in order to put in branches, grasses, or flowers according to the seasons since these were probably used in seasonal ceremonies. Their excavator, J. G. D. Clark, believes these people practiced a fertility cult.22 Whether or not the dancers wearing the masks were sorcerers or simply disguised persons, there must have been a leader of the ceremonies, a tribal sorcerer or, in case the fertility cult was addressed to a divine spirit or a deity, a priest or priestess. With the Neolithic period (7000/5000-ca. 2000 B.C.), the transi- tion to an agricultural order of life brought better socioeconomic conditions, but with quite a new ideology. The collective rites of the village are now associated with plowing, seedtime, and harvest 20 See Hancar, "Die Venusstatuette von Jelisejevici." 21 See the following works by A.

Now the priest becomes the guardian of the new mysteries, and the mythological concepts which now emerge are related to the sky, sun, and moon as celestial divine powers or to the all-powerful goddess who makes the earth fruitful, often also associated with a male god, the divine bull. These are strongly in evidence in late Neolithic times. In southeastern Europe, where the Neolithic period started around 7000 B.C. and ended with the Chalcolithic era (ca. 5500- 3500 B.c.), we meet with evidence of religious cults (idols, clay models of shrines, remains of sanctuaries, shrine equipment, and objects related to cult practices). Regarding these idols, J. Neustupny states that they belonged mostly to the cult of fertility, but this cult included a whole set of equipment: figurines of wor- shippers, priestesses, devotees, anthropomorphic vessels, amulets, zoomorphic figurines, etc.23 The best proofs for the existence of priests or priestesses are the remains of sanctuaries and clay models of shrines. For instance, we have architectural remains encountered during excavations at Varvarovka, a Cucuteni-Tripolye settlement near Kishinev, Soviet Moldavia, where the ruins of a two-story structure were found. What we know of such sanctuaries comes from a two-story clay model, the second floor comprising the temple, discovered near Kiev in the Ros River valley. There are entrances on both floors, and in front of the larger portal or gate of the main temple is a platform adorned with bulls' horns. Further remains were dis- covered in the site of Sabatinovka (Cucuteni civilization) in the valley of the southern Bug. This rectangular building occupies about 70 square meters, exhibits a narrow entrance located on the long side paved with flat stones, and has a floor plastered with clay. A bone figurine was found at the entrance, and opposite the entrance was a large clay-plastered altar measuring 21 by 6 meters with sixteen female figurines on it, all seated on horn-backed stools; in the corner beside the altar stood a clay throne or chair (fig. 1).24 To these we could add numerous clay models of shrines discovered at Turda, Cascioarele (fig. 2), at Izvoarele in Rumania, and others in the Ukraine.25 They served in the domestic cult and are images of public shrines.26 All these sanctuaries no doubt had a 23 J.

Finally, in the Megalithic world of western Europe we find other sacral constructions, the alignments, which are plentiful in Brit- tany, the largest one being situated at Carnac, Morbihan. These lines of monoliths or menhirs were for ceremonial purposes, in- cluding processions, and probably also for sacrifices. This would indicate, once more, the necessity of a priesthood to carry out the services, which appear to have been connected with fertility and the death cult. Attempts have been made to build up systems of astrological magic or religion, but this should only be considered with extreme caution.29 In Great Britain late Neolithic people constructed ritual or ceremonial circular enclosures, some of them gigantic construc- tions of earthwork and huge sarsen monoliths, as at Avebury and Stonehenge, both in Wessex. They are regarded as sacred and nonutilitarian in character, probably connected with a cult of the dead and/or of the sun.30 Stonehenge underwent a reconstruction in the late Neolithic, while three others took place in the Bronze Age. It is probable that these "temples" had a staff of priests, but it is more difficult to prove that the priests also had the function 28 Ibid., pp. 144-46. 29 P. R.

Shrines of one kind or another are so numerous that there is reason to believe that not only every palace but also every private house was used for cult practices. Aside from these, many cave sanctuaries have also been discovered, but I am here concerned only with the places of public or semipublic cult. Many royal palaces at Knossos, Phaistos, Hagia Triada, Mallia, and Zakro contain small pillared rooms with altars or platforms on which female figurines, sacred horns, the double-axe symbol, and cult vessels were found stand- ing. They served as the semipublic cult of the royal family and household, the king or queen performing the ceremonies as a priest or priestess. Wide terraces of the palace court, decorated with high sacred horns like at Knossos, were obviously places of public cult in which the king as high priest executed sacred rites in the presence of the nobles, military, and administrative dignitaries. A shrine in the provincial town of Gournia in eastern Crete is situated at some distance from the palace on the summit of the town hill and has a road leading to it. The shrine is small, only 4 by 3 meters, with rudely constructed walls. In the center is a low plastered earthen table with three legs, and around it are some tube-shaped vessels with a vertical row of three or four snakelike loops on either side, a bigger handle on the back, and above this a pair of horns of consecration. The other equipment includes a bell- shaped female idol with raised hands, each holding a snake, and a snake around the body (fig. 4)-the "snake goddess" or "snake priestess." There are also heads of two other idols, three arms, several hands and bases, two snake heads, four small birds, and a fragment of a clay pithos. Clearly a goddess was invoked and worshipped in this small community sanctuary. We are entitled to assume that they had a priestess as guardian and officiant, clothed in the garment and with the snake attributes of the goddess. In many caves on Crete (Psycro, Kamares, Arkalokhori, Eileithya, and others) the symbols and votive objects point to the worship of the great goddess by single and grouped devotees. In some of the holy caves the builders had constructed entrances and rooms for the priests or priestesses. According to S. Marinatos31 the priests possessed fields, herds, and slaves. To judge by sub- sequent traditions, colleges of scholarly priests must have kept religious doctrines, holy words, and mysteries alive for centuries. 31 S.

In Enkomi, presumably the metropolis at that time, a shrine in the central part was excavated which yielded a 55-centimeter-high bronze statue of a horned god along with numerous vessels, bulls' horns, and miniature horns made of gold.33 In the northern part of the town, within strata of the final Bronze Age and early Iron Age, French archaeologists discovered a small sanctuary with the horns of consecration made of chalkstone.34 Also, in Myrtou-Pighades, English archaeologists discovered a shrine of the late Bronze Age: 32 C.

This votive piece represents an open-air circular temple in which a cult scene is enacted, presided over by a priest marked by a sacrificial bandeau.36 In the other parts of Europe, except for Mycenaean Greece, discoveries of the same kind are lacking. We may, however, point to the Malta temples and Stonehenge, which extended into the early Bronze Age. In northern Europe, at Kivik in southern Sweden, an unusually large cist built of stone slabs was found, probably the funeral monument of an important man. On the eight stones forming the grave chamber a series of impressive and mysterious carvings is presented showing the sacrifice of an ox, libations being poured, offerings being made, people walking in procession to the music of a flute, and more. According to H. R. E. Davidson, the burial must have been that of a king or priest, and those who prepared the grave must have been members of some organized cult of considerable complexity.37 In France and Germany we have found richly furnished princely burials. Among these, that of Acholshausen in southern Germany contained a wheeled cauldron and two disks of bronze which have been interpreted as priestly equipment; the remains seem to have been those of a high person, either a priest or a prince, who also performed priestly functions.38 Alleged priestly insignia have often been found in graves, such as a gold disk, obviously a symbol of the sun, found at Moordorf in nothern Germany; the disk probably decorated official attire.39 Likewise, a rich treasure of gold from Dieskau near Merseburg, middle Germany, consisting of two bracelets, an axe, and other gold objects, has been assumed to belong to the vestments of a 35 J. du Plat Taylor, Myrtou Pigadhes, A Late Bronze Age Sanctuary in Cyprus (Oxford, 1967). 36 P.

In all probability we also see priests as officiants in the cult scenes engraved on the rocks of northern Europe. We are, of course, not sure whether during the Bronze Age the cult of a personified sun god was developed or whether the human figures with body or head in the form of a wheeled cross (symbol of the sun) represented him; however, it appears from the pictographs that the symbol of the sun, for the purpose of adoration and blessing of the settlements and fields, was conveyed by longboats along the shore. This is also evidence of the existence of religious leaders, and we may assume that the persons in the pictographs who elevate the symbol were priests. In the final prehistoric period, the Iron Age, during which south Europe (Greece and Italy) had entered already into history, there are, to begin our investigation, the pictographs of the Val Camonica near Brescia, northern Italy, and those of Mount Bego in the west Alps which often show priests functioning in peculiar dress. According to E. Anati,43 the foremost expert of the Val Camonica pictographs, they appear in the depicted cult processions clearly separated from the group of mounted chiefs and adherents, on foot and unarmed, yet attired with a plume or similar headgear; they are the only ones not elevating their arms in adoration. On a pass in the Mount Bego district, a priest is depicted on a 107- by 94- centimeter slab of stone with elevated arms, adoring and blessing and wearing a large pectoral with a horn of consecration44 (fig. 5). 40 K.-H.

FIG. 5.-Carving on a slab of stone from the Mount Bego district in the western Alps, Italy (after F. Sacco). Furthermore, there are some discoveries of extraordinary burials of priestly dead. Of these the grave from Ohnenheim in eastern France seems to yield indisputable proof. The burial contained a chariot different from the usual Celtic ones encountered in noble graves; this one appears to have been a cult vehicle. Inside it is covered with a skin on which a wooden chair, embossed with bronze, stood. The rands of the box show dispositions for fastening a canopy or baldachin. Close to the chariot the skeletal remains of a man were found, and other remains of a twenty- or thirty-year- old man were lying behind the chariot, strangely enough, with the skull absent. Obviously, the first-mentioned remains are those of a high-ranking person, while the others are, to all appearances, those of the driver, who had been killed or sacrificed in order to follow his lord and to continue in his service in the other world. 45 G.

Raftery). Forrer,47 who has reconstructed the chariot, concludes that the lord had been a priest or a high-ranking druid. From the pre-Roman Iron Age of Denmark there were two vehicles found in the bog at Dejbjerg, West Jutland. The sides of the box and the poles were covered by openwork bronze mount- ings, a glittering decoration fashionable at the time. Further, each cart was decorated with human masks above the side boards.48 According to Davidson, such wagons must have been intended for transporting important people or for use in religious processions and were possibly wagons of the gods, carrying their symbol or statue in the Bronze Age traditional manner of transporting sacred objects in a wheeled carriage for worship and blessing.49 In this case the seat may have been intended for the god's symbol or image or for the priest or priestess in charge. The well-known passage from Germania chapter 40, where Tacitus describes the worship of the goddess Nerthus by tribes believed to have lived in Denmark, demonstrates such a sacred wagon in use. 47 R.

It consists of a large sepulchral mound containing three burials (of a man, a woman, and a child) with an oval construction on the top of the mound. In the grave of the woman a scepter-like item of iron was found. According to the excavators, the male dead was a priest-druid, and the woman may have been his successor.50 From a grave of the end of the Iron Age in Lithuania there were unearthed other remains that may be of a priest, for they are clothed in a mantle which has a marginal adornment consist- ing of bronze swastikas, and the entire web is covered by swastikas-all together thirty-four of them in twenty variants are preserved.51 Another burial of the Hallsttt civilization from Gaisheim near Nuremberg, south Germany, contained female remains endowed with rich bronze ornaments, among which is a pectoral loaded with sun symbols. That she was a priestess is not certain because she could also have been a noble pious lady.52 The same is true for a female found near Ancona, northern Italy. She was also adorned with a bronze pectoral, a splendid one consisting of two parts which must have been sewn on cloth or skin or directly fixed to an official attire.53 Its even more rich sun symbolism gives, it seems, preference to the assumption that she was a priestess (fig. 7). There is also another supposed burial of a priest in Chaivignieres in France.54 Bronze scepters with a horse's head at the top were found (fifteen specimens) in Russia, Hungary, and Czecho- slovakia55 and have been interpreted as the priestly insignia of a sun cult. Finally, we may include an archaeological find from Seuthopolis, where a royal palace of the third century B.C. was excavated. It consists of dwelling rooms, apartments, and a splendid many-colored hall, the sanctuary of the great Samo- thracian gods. This architectural uniting of temple and residence 50 J. Paulik and L.

These cover nearly all periods except the early Paleolithic. I admit that they are in many cases rather ambiguous, and there- fore my investigation may be considered as only a first attempt. Clearer light may be shed on the subject by future discoveries and by more transparent finds. However, I have been able to prove 56 D. P. Dimitrov, "Seuthopolis," Antiquity 35 (1961): 91-102. 119</page><page sequence="20">Priests and Priestesses sufficiently the existence of an official, probably permanent priesthood as well as an unofficial or semiofficial one, in operation only occasionally and practiced by tribal chiefs or princely or royal rulers. Both forms show a long tradition continuing into the clearer light of protohistoric and historic times. Many questions still remain to be answered, especially the extent of priestly functions in prehistoric times. The central function of the priesthood consisted undoubtedly of offering service to a super- human power or a personal deity in charge of a community. But other functions were also perceptible, such as praying, leading processions and dances, symbolic activities, producing cult pictures and probably also cult objects, presiding over sanctuaries, and perhaps even establishing a holy calendar to fix the times of annual ceremonies and the key points of the rural year.
