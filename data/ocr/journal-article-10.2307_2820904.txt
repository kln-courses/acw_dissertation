<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WORLD OF ANTS. A Science-fiction Universe. By Remy Chauvin; translated by George Ordish. Hill and Wang, New York. $5.95. 216 p. + 8 p. pl.; ill.; index. 1969. Science-fiction writers try to make fiction look like fact and the best of them succeed. Chauvain tries to make fact look like fiction; at least, such an attempt is implied in the subtitle and in such anthropomorphic chapter headings as "The Ants' Herds," "City Life," and "The Vices and Enemies of the Cities." The first 16 pages ("Instead of a Preface") give an all-too-sketchy background for the classification, anatomy, physiology and evolution of ants.

The remainder of the book is a readable and up- to-date account of behavior. The European forest ants (Formica polyctena and F. rufa) are exten- sively used as examples. The most interesting parts are those dealing with Chauvain's own observations. Illustrations comprise 41 figures and 11 photo- graphs. The photographs (9 of which are credited to others) are excellent. Thirty-two of the figures are borrowed; the redrawing of 19 of these is un- pardonably crude. The book abounds in a great variety of errors myrmecological, entomological, biological, and errors in rhetoric, spelling, derivation, and geography. Be- sides these there are contradictions and confusions. Another very annoying fault is pseudodocumenta- tion: he gives the names of those responsible for many observations but no references. Without "Literature Cited" it would require a lot of time and effort to vertify; far better not to give even the names. GEORGE C.
