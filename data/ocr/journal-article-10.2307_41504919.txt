Three months later, it played the largest theater in Spain, the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, and from there toured extensively to Berlin, Rome, Belgrade, London, Paris, and Saint-Paul- de- Vence in the south of France. From that production originated the unique, padded costume representing Merma, the monster, now in the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts (title page, fig. 1). The costume of the monster is grotesque but intriguing: a large, inverted wicker basket covered with white muslin forms the giant, dome-shaped head of the creature, while padded flaps and a gathered red silk cloth hang to the floor to complete the form. From within the wicker frame, the person wearing the costume looked out through openings under the creature's protruding eyes and nose, used armholes formed by the basket handles, and had ample room to walk, run, lunge, and kick. Painted on the white surface of the figure are streaks of black among spatters of red, yellow, green, and blue. The daring image of the costume is evidence that the octogenarian had not lost his youthful propensity to experiment. This costume, one of Miró's last endeavors, represents a return to theater design by an artist more recognized for his paintings, sculpture, and ceramics - his previous theater work was in the 1920s and 1930s when he designed costumes and sets for the Ballet Russes.2 Knowledge of the artist's personal history is needed to comprehend more fully the significance of the costume he designed so late in life and why he collaborated with the actor-mimes. Unifying the events in the long, productive life of Joan Miró is a deep attachment to Catalonia, his homeland. Officially, Catalonia (Catalunya) in present-day Spain is an autonomous region situated in the northeast triangle of the Iberian Peninsula formed by the Mediterranean coast and the eastern end of the Pyrenees mountain range. However, if the areas where Catalan is spoken are used to identify its boundaries, Catalonia also includes the autonomous region of Valencia, a zone of eastern Aragon, and the Balearic Islands comprising Majorca, Minorca, Ibiza, and Formentera.3 The beautiful, diverse countryside features tropical marshlands to the south, snow-clad peaks of the Pyrenees to the north, palm and northern fir, cork forests and vineyards, volcanoes, and miles of seacoast. Miró's early masterpiece The Farm (fig. 2) reveals reverence for his homeland.4 Creating a kind of magical realism, he painted a detailed description of the activities on a Catalan farm, a scene with which he was quite familiar in real life. During his youth, Miró spent many days visiting his parents' farm in the Catalonian village of Montroig, and in later years he became its owner. Throughout his life, he Figure 1.

The mas and the masia (the house and the farm- land) are subjects of many of his early paintings.5 Miró said about his attachment to Catalonia, "there is nothing random or fortuitous about my having come to live and work here ... It is the call of the earth."6 Miró's fervor for his homeland coincided with the modern revival of Catalan nationalism. Since the 1830s, "claims for a Catalan sense of self have often referred back to the land, la terra catalana ."7 The idealized view of the terrain was a response to a complex regional history of bloody revolution. As a nation-state, Catalonia repeatedly failed to gain political independence from the Spanish central government. In the twentieth century, suppression of the Catalan desire for autonomy rose to its zenith under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, Avho came to power at the end of the Spanish Civil War (1936-39).

In 1920, after the First World War, the young Miró left Catalonia and moved to Paris to settle among the poets, philoso- phers, and painters of the Parisian avant- garde. For the next decade he divided his life between studios in Paris and the farm in Montroig, painting in both places. Paris drew him into the intellectual currents of Europe; Montroig offered him repose and a return to his roots. In 1929, he strengthened his Catalan roots with his marriage to Pilar Juncosa of Majorca, and their daughter, Dolores, was born in Barcelona the following year. In Paris, Miró was part of the new Surrealist movement led by André Breton, whose Manifesto on Surrealism appeared in 1924, and Miró's work soon began to be exhibited as Surrealist. In 1925, the Galerie Pierre presented several paintings and drawings by Miró in a one-man show with invitations signed by all the mem- bers, of the surrealist group. As he became established, Miró developed an imaginative art of universal symbols rooted in his personal feelings, folk art, primitivism, native wit, and grotesquerie. Self-Portrait II (fig. 3) displays powerful color harmonies with imagery relating to its model, the artist's own face. Two exaggerated astral eyes resembling sunflowers dominate the space on a large canvas. Disproportionate body parts and staring eyes are prominent symbols throughout the artist's works.8 38 By associating with the Surrealists, Miró was able to pursue one of his keenest interests, his love of poetry. Miró recalled his early meetings with the contemporary French poets who, he stated, had inter- ested him more than the painters, "espe- cially the poetry they discussed. I gorged myself on it all night long - poetry principally in the tradition of Jarry's."9 Throughout his career, Miró would illustrate works by several poets, and his enthusiasm for poetry would be an important source of inspiration for his future work with La Claca in designing Mori el Merma. In 1932, financial troubles forced Miró and his family to move back to their apartment in Barcelona. From this base he continued to summer in Montroig and make occasional trips to Paris. However, in 1936 the Spanish Civil War broke out with General Franco's military coup against the Spanish Republican govern- ment. Trapped with his family during a visit to Paris, Miró decided to seek refuge there and did not return to Catalonia until 1940. During his exile Miró was sympathetic to the cause of the Spanish Republican government but refused to take an active part in politics. Beneath his tranquil facade, he felt deeply the sinister menace of fascist domination in his homeland and vented his personal torment in several works of dark comedy.10 In 1937 for the Paris World Fair, the Spanish Republican government commissioned Miró to paint The Reaper (fig. 4), which was designed on several large panels and placed in the Spanish Republican Pavilion.11 He turned to the Catalan peasant as his model, treated with exuberant violence. The profile of a large head, crowned by a crumpled hat, seemed to shout defiance while growing like a plant from the soil.12 In 1940, when the Nazi invasion of France was imminent, the artist and his family managed to slip across the French border into Catalonia, finally settling permanently in Palma de Mallorca in 1956. Despite the dominating rule of Spain's fascist govern- ment during the next two decades, he continued to build his artistic legacy in his homeland.13 Finally, in 1975 he saw one of his dearest ambitions realized - the opening in Barcelona of the Joan Miró Foundation and Center for Studies in the Contemporary Arts.14 This monumental event in the artist's life occurred, ironically, in the year of Franco's death. In 1976, when Miró undertook the designs for the popular La Claca mime troupe, the Spanish central government had begun its political transition from a totalitarian regime to a modern democracy. By 1979 the Spanish parliament would grant Catalonia its autonomy. In the years that followed, the newly elected president initiated a statewide program in the study of Catalan folklore.15 Under Franco's dictator- ship, pantomimes by La Claca had been censored and several actors had lived in exile; now, during this transitional period, the troupe was again allowed to perform on native soil. Interpreting an old Catalan tradition of street theater, La Claca's style was a cross between raucous Punch and Judy shows and the giant figures that formed the village parades for the feast of Corpus Christi.16 Miró was only too happy to join in bringing the actors back to their homeland in a play that would be a blatant parody of bourgeois values with veiled references to the Franco era.17 By the time La Claca members met Miró, the troupe was well known throughout Catalonia and Europe for its innovative theater productions. The company had been founded in 1968 by directors Joan Baixas and Theresa Calafell, who were</page><page sequence="4">Figure 4.

These experiences culmi- nated in La Claca's creation of an innova- tive amalgam of popular components, iconography, and both puppet and marionette theater techniques that was evident in dramatic plots consisting of telluric and familial elements portrayed through surprising visual effects. Bold designs of allegorical "object characters" depicted a delicate anthropomorphic balance that, while extreme, remained within the bounds of believability. During their shows, puppets were not restricted to playing only with other puppets, but rather puppets played alongside live actors.19 39</page><page sequence="5">Figure 6.

Miró's drawings for Alfred Jarry's (1873- 1907) Ubu Roi were La Claca's starting point for the production of Mori el Merma.20 The parody in Ubu Roi is revealed in grotesque archetypal imagery. Essentially, the drama is a savage caricature of a stupid, selfish bourgeois full of greed and cowardice - a terrifying image of humans' animal nature. The farcical stage action centers around the antihero Père Ubu, who makes himself king of Poland, tortures all the citizens, and is chased out of the country.21 The playwright's instructions for staging the play included costumes with no local or period reference; a cardboard horse's head for the main character, Ubu; a neutral stage set without curtains between acts; a simple placard indicating the location of the scenes; and a single actor to represent crowd scenes.22 The first public produc- tion of Ubu Roi in Paris (1896) caused a scandal; the unconventional play closed after two nights of rioting.23 Ubu Roi reappeared later when the surrealist poet- actor Antonin Artaud opened the Théâtre Alfred Jarry in Paris (1927), and in 1937, Max Ernst designed the decor for the production of Jarry's sequel, Ubu Enchaîné , at the Comédie des Champs- Élysées. 40 Stimulated at several times in his career by Jarry's writings as well as his own internal drama about Francoism, Miró produced lithographs illustrating Ubu in three different publications: a collector's edition of Ubu Roi (1966), in which he closely adhered to Jarry's classic text; Ubu aux Baleares (1963, fig. 5), in which he substituted his own poems; and L'Enfance ďUbu (1975), in which he replaced his poetry with popular Majorcan and Catalan sayings.24 The story and direction of Mori el Merma were by Joan Baixas, giants and masks were created by the company and painted by Joan Miró, and musical collaboration was by Rafael Subiratchs. Leading the cast of characters were Merma, played by Baixas, and the wife, played by Calafell. In what is essentially a portrayal of good winning over evil, the pretentious Merma ultimately chokes and dies at the end of the play.25 Dominating the stage action, Merma, the "anonymous embodiment of evil,"26 is a symbolic representation of Franco. His wife, wearing a white robe splashed with color and a red bulbous mask, resembles a ridiculous animal. Nimble creatures who move and make noises like birds and insects eventually overpower the monsters and their courtiers and reduce them to misery.27 When interviewed about his design for the new production, Miró explained: "For my work with the Claca, my point of departure was Ubu ... a parallel with Franco. Jarry is more and more relevant today. If my own personnages have become increasingly grotesque, it is because we are living in a monstrous epoch."28 To stage the new play, La Claca began rehearsing in a barn in Sand Esteve de Palautordera near Barcelona. Large-scale costumes based on Miró's drawings were executed by stretching white muslin over foam padding on wood and wicker armatures that allowed for the movement of the actors wearing them. In March 1977, after La Claca's preliminary work construct- ing the forms, Miró joined the troupe, and in just ten days he painted the gigantic costumes, puppet masks, and two canvases (fig. 6). 29 When asked later about what he most enjoyed in the creative process, Miró answered: "the puppets weren't real puppets because there were actors inside them. But these figures were very exciting to me. . . . You make a puppet say every- thing, with a brusque mobility that can dispense with words and explanations."30 Designing theater costumes to be worn, crunched, and soiled did not bother the artist. What truly mattered was the creation of imaginative creatures moving through three-dimensional space and stimulating the perception and feelings of hundreds of spectators.31 The scenario of the play was portrayed through mime rather than dialogue. Consequently, the staging consisted largely of actors manipulating props and wearing either masks or giant costumes to depict the various characters in the dramatic action. Miró's visual symbolism utilized familiar signs from his previous works. For example, a creature shaped like a gourd with a pointed head and black-ringed eyes stomps around with an enormous, human- shaped foot (fig. 7). Quite prominent among the costumed figures is the familiar sign of exaggerated, disproportionate body parts. The imagery depicts earthy, animal- like caricatures. The face of the costume of Merma extends downward into a pair of long padded flaps resembling dog-like jowls or elephant ears; the lower lip supports black tusks; on a small shelf attached to the back of the head is a bright red hook reminiscent of a peasant's cap. Merma's two bulbous eyes move indepen- dently of each other.</page><page sequence="6">Overall, the artist enhanced the powerful dramatic effect of the absurd shapes of the characters with a unifying visual motif of the grotesque personage of Ubu, one that appears also in Jarry's woodcut of Ubu (fig. 8). This motif, Miró later explained "is the spiral on Ubu's belly."32 Specifically, this symbol is a black spiral painted on a white background. Within the ensemble, the spiral motif occurs on the top of Merma's white head, in the eyes of various crea- tures, and on a white canvas backdrop in several scenes. However, the most provocative use of the symbolic spiral is in the last scene. Leading up to the climactic moment, the stage action evolves into a scene with a scaffolding of raised platforms, ropes, and pulleys that resembles a gallows.33 Attached to the front edge of the platform is a painted curtain that conceals the defeated monster, Merma. During the cacophony of grunts, clarinet wails, and tambourine and drum beats, the curtain is suddenly pulled aside to reveal the collapsed monster. Chanting "Mori el merma," the costumed actors cleverly use ropes and long poles to bring the creature forward and upward, positioning him to be hanged. Meanwhile, the actor inside Merma's costume slips out into the crowd scene. Unbeknownst to the audience, a large white canvas with a painted black spiral (fig. 9) is placed inside the giant head of the monster. At the moment Merma is raised, this large canvas simultaneously drops down and fans open as if it were a huge skirt or symbolic body. With long poles, the actors guide the opening of the skirt to nearly the width and height of the proscenium arch. The monstrous, hanging Merma with a billow- ing "skirt-body" is an awesome sight, as good wins over evil. At the same time it is frightening to observe the spreading skirt with its pattern of a black spiral on a white background - a sinister reminder of Ubu, of tyranny, of all that is poisonous. The audience is left questioning whether Merma, the monstrous tyrant, is truly dead or is resurrected as a goblin that continues to cast its evil spell. Mori el Merma has been described as a "sombre comedy."34 That Miró intended to portray incongruity in the visual shapes of the various characters is clear. Mixing comical visual elements with the dramatic theme of impending doom evoked a deep emotional reaction from the audience. After the play opened, Miró was asked how he felt about the audience's mixed response, laughing and then recoiling as if it had been hit in the face. He replied, "So much the better! You should hit hard. Violence is liberating."35 Perhaps the expressive intent of the play would have satisfied Artaud's requirements for a revolutionary theater of myth and magic.36 However, in the reality of the time and place in which Mori el Merma was created, the production represented more than experimental theater; it was an allegorical fable about liberation from tyranny after years of repression. Likewise, the costume design of Merma represented more than a grotesque Ubu; it was a symbolic manifes- tation of the universal tyranny that arose in the wake of Francoism.37 The significance of the costume design cannot not be fully appreciated without viewing it within the context of a live production. Fortunately, however, informative articles and filmed excerpts were created by individuals who did experience live performances in Barcelona during the month of June 1978. On 41 Figure 7.

The president of Catalonia was also there to greet him. When the performance was over, the audience responded with a standing ovation. Mounting the stage, Joan Miró, the master artist and grand old man, joined the young actor-mimes to receive his laurels. As the audience kept applauding, tears came to his eyes.38 This reflective man, who never took an active political role during the years of war and oppression, had nonetheless caused, in his unique way, a liberation through the revolutionary forms of his art. His response to the success of Mori el Merma was: "I am a Catalonian. I have always liked to have my feet on that soil. If Catalonia has become what it is today, I think I have played some part in it."39 42 Notes The author wishes to thank Arthur G.

Joan Baixas reported that in his first meeting with Miró at the Puppet Festival in Barcelona in November 1975, La Claca proposed that Catalan painters should collaborate in the celebrations by painting a pair of puppets, "big- heads," or other similar beasts. Miró received the same proposal sent to other artists and immediately responded that rather than just painting a couple of giant puppets, he wanted to do the whole show (J. Baixas, "Swimming</page><page sequence="8">against the current builds muscle," in Miró en escena [Barcelona: Fundació Joan Miró, exh. cat., 1985]: 390- 93). 20. Malet 1984 (note 14), 29. 21. Jarry wrote the play in 1888 at age fifteen as a schoolboy prank aimed at one of his teachers at the lycée in Rennes. The teacher, nicknamed "Père Ubu," was the butt of much ridicule among the pupils. The puppet play evolved around the exploits of Père Ubu and was performed for the benefit of Jarry's friends (M. Esslin, The Theatre of the Absurd [New York, 1961], 255-56). 22. H. Rischbieter, ed., Art and the Stage in the Twentieth Century (Greenwich, Conn., 1969), 25. 23.

Because of the deterioration of the original pieces, La Claca agreed with Miró to make copies of the main part of the costumes for Mori el Merma (R. M. Malet, Fundació Joan Miró, Barcelona, letter to author, June 21, 1995). It was La Claca's usual practice for the stage props to be constantly washed, repainted, repaired, and altered to add new effects to the spectacle throughout the run. La Claca found that the painter liked working with the artisans and adapted readily to their technical requirements. In their collaboration on the new play, Miró and La Claca agreed that the world of Merma would be "a single, indivisible unit with human movement, voice and presence, an inseparable part of the objects, with actors inside the puppets and beside them, in a black room, in the dark and with stage lighting. It has nothing to do with sculpture: the movement marks the difference." See Baixas 1985 (note 19), 391. 32.
