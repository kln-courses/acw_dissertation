<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bob and Sylvia and Chris and Doris: A Collaboration by Faye Hirsch Simmelink/Sukimoto Editions was founded in 1988 in Los Angeles by Doris Simmelink and Chris Sukimoto. Last year they moved their operation to Middletown, New York, in the Hud son Valley. Their shop is not far from the 150-acre Washingtonville home of artists Sylvia Plimack Mangold and Robert Mangold, both as renowned for their prints as their paintings. Simmelink first met them at Crown Point Press, where she began printing in the late 70s. Simmelink moved on in the early 80s to Gemini G.E.L., where she met Suki moto, her future husband and business partner. Both left Gemini in the mid-80s, doing their own and some contract printing (for Robert Feldman's Para sol Press, among others). Finally, they opened their shop, printing and publishing such artists as Jake Berthot, Alex Katz, Robert Therrien, and, more recently, Thomas Noskowski, Laura Owens, and Monique Prieto. And, of course, the Mangolds, with whom they now have a longstanding collabo rative relationship and friendship. Along with AOP's assistant editor, Ruth Altchek, I caught up with both couples in the Simmelink/Sukimoto work shop (temporary, for they will eventually move to another spot along the Hudson) on one of the few sunny days in August 2000.—FH 68 November-December 2000 Bob and Sylvia and Chris and Doris: A Collaboration by Faye Hirsch</page><page sequence="2">(Opposite page) Sylvia Pliinack Mangold.

Sylvia Plimack Mangold First 1 was painting the three trees—an elm, a pin oak, and this other tree— from a mid-distance, so it was like a landscape more than looking at the tree closely. But I just kept get ting closer and closer to the separate trees, and then I got involved with this form, the form of the elm tree, until it died. Everything that I do is very sys tematic, but when I'm doing it, it doesn't seem sys tematic. It seems like I'm adventurous. So I leave the house, and I'm painting outside, and I keep on get ting further and further away from my house. And I reached this pond, where I've been for 15 years. This [Winter Elm, 1997] is the tree that died. Doris Simmelink This was the last image that was done before it died. FH Did you know it was dying when you did it? SPM No, because it was winter. DS We finished it after we knew it was dying. I know we did, because we talked about it. It was a very emotional experience doing this print, be cause you became aware of everything . . . SPM I did a terrible painting, so bad, because the tree was dead. At first I thought, oh it's summer, and it doesn't have leaves on it, well that's interesting, but it didn't work at all. It was a terrible experience of trying to paint this tree. I have painted dead trees, but I knew they were dead. FH Do you think there's any kind of similarity between a tree, kind of its physiognomy, and a face? SPM No—more like a figure. I think of the trees like a Shiva. When I look at a tree, I don't want it to be anthropomorphic. No, no. I really want to get at the tree form. The trunk is sort of simple and the major branches are simple, but the farther forms are very quirky and wonderful and unexpected, and that they come from the same anatomy is interest ing to me. So finding these forms on the copper is pretty intense, pretty technical sometimes, but it's what I have to do. The transition from the trunk to the limbs to the branches is very important to me. That this be true to organic form and that you feel the sense of each species of tree as unique from one another. For me it becomes a study that I pursue until I think I've got it right. FH Do you prefer one season over the other? SPM Well, at first I preferred winter because I just couldn't deal with how to do the foliage—I still haven't figured it out. I mean I paint it ... I think about the problems of each season. The winter is more abstract by virtue of its color and the clarity of the space. You can have a specific form and a brush stroke adjacent without confusion. But the palette of greens and yellows is not only more Kodachrome—it tends toward cliche because the leaves are impressionistic, which I struggle with—I end up focusing on their volume instead of each leaf's shape. So I like winter because I love the way you can see form so clearly and find all those yel lows and purples and there is just more subtlety. I like summer because the days are long and I can stay outside for longer work sessions—and the paint goes on so easily or the watercolor dries so much more quickly.

I use a gelatin and the ground can crack and cause problems. So I try not to work on paint ings. Drawings are fine. Copper is fine. This summer my back was so bad that I had to work on just one drawing for weeks, of the maple. This earlier print [Maple Tree, 1999] is looking at the maple from the east, and I've been looking at it from the south, on my back.You know I got pretty tired of the fact that there was no way of working, so Bob said why don't you just get out there in the lawn chair and lie down on your back and draw? So that was a good idea. DS Maple Tree was the first time Sylvia really used spit bite to make the form. Prior to that it had mostly been a lot of drypoint with spit bite used either to enhance the form, or to enhance the sky DS If you get up close you can see the whole process happening. We did a self-portrait that really wasn't printed as an edition. There may be as many as 17 states of proofs that, as she changed, she would change this image. But three-quarters of the way through, in the process of scraping and burnishing and reprinting, it was very bizarre—but, remem ber?—one of the old images began to come up. SPM Mmm hmmm. DS One of the original images. She had complete ly changed the positioning of the nose and eyes on the plate, but we kept getting this old image, no matter how much we scraped away. There was some thing very stubborn about it. FH So you're out there in the freezing cold. SPM It's not freezing cold. FH Well, it was a mild winter but . . .You won't go out when it's 20, or ten, degrees out. (Left) Sylvia Plimack Mangold. Maple Tree, spit-bite aquatint (26 1/2x20-3/4 in.), 1999.

This was the first time that we didn't let her use the drypoint. It really made her nuts, because drypoint is the technique that Sylvia's really mastered. She has so much more control. She can take the plate out, and look at the tree, and manipulate it right there in front of her. So setting up outside with spit bite was a challenge. She does take the plates out and she works outside with the acid, too. And now—Sylvia has certainly developed a facility in spit bite. SPM For me, drypoint is like drawing—it's second nature. Actually, I prefer it to drawing. It's richer. You have this carving that takes place and when you print it you have all of these marks and shad ows and so forth where something had been. So it fills up a kind of space around the line. When you make a pencil line, even if you erase it you don't see the erasure—you don't really see it in prints except it makes this kind of atmosphere. SPM No. You're just sitting there, you're not exer cising, so you really can get cold. But I have big boots, I have hats, I have scarves—I feel like some sort of monk ... I don't know why I like it so much. I like being outside and feeling very close to what I'm looking at. I need to have nothing between me and the object because I need to see it as well as I can. And feel it, too. But it's hard, because your hands get cold. You can get physically uncomfortable. That's when I retreat to the studio in the house. And I work on the maple outside my window. It has this central column . . . you know, when you see the ac tual tree, you might not see it quite so prominently. I've brought attention to it. FH I am curious to see the actual tree. SPM But you won't because that's winter, and it's summer now.

DS The thing that's harder is that we have to work with people's schedules. Projects get spread out. When we were in Los Angeles we kind of held people hostage. But it's actually been harder the past few years because most of the artists we work with are much busier. So we started to do a lot of work through the mail, which is okay . . . FH I would think that would be very difficult. Robert Mangold It's quick, because you just do a FedEx overnight. Doris would pull a proof and you'd take a weekend to look at it, and say the blue was a little thin or something, and they'd pull another proof. Sometimes slowing down the process isn't bad because you get some time to think about it. You put it on your wall, you get a couple of days to make up your mind. them like a page, do a drawing. Some of them I liked, and wanted color, too, so we added color to them, which I also do in my sketchbooks. FH Has it been a while since you've looked at Pages? RM Yes.You know, what bothers me about it now is that I don't think I should have gone beyond the plate size. It almost takes away from the idea of the sketchbook size. FH Well, given that shape is really kind of impor tant to you . . . RM But because they were sketchbook pages, I wanted these to be just images on a page. But I shouldn't second-guess my judgment then. I was probably right. FH When did Chris [Sukimoto] enter the picture? DS I had left Crown Point Press and I was hired by Kathan to work on a project by Alex Katz at Jeryl [Parker]'s shop. That's when Chris and I began to Robert Mangold, I :n titled. three of six woodcuts (14x12 in. each), 1992. Courtesy Sinune link/Sukimoto Editions. ■ fru/j-'i-. SPM I could not have done that Winter Pin Oak [2000] through the mail. Because things happened while I was in the shop. RMYeah, there are things you can't do . . . DS And I think Bob's new print [Varied Figure Zone, 2000] wouldn't have been what it was. A lot of the work that we did with Bob, in Los Angeles, was about sending certain plates for him to draw on but trying also in a sense to second-guess certain techniques to send to him to do in order for some thing to happen. When we started publishing on our own, the first thing we did with him was Pages [1989], and it was done through the mail. It was a portfolio of ten prints based on the idea of the kind of original sketches Bob does, which are very small. RM I work in sketchbooks, so I wanted the plates to be like sketchbook pages. So they sent me a whole bunch of plates, some with soft ground, some with regular ground, and I would just treat work together. And, after we opened our own shop in 1988, Chris worked pretty much from the begin ning on the things we published of Bob's. This is a portfolio of seven untitled woodcuts from 1992. RM Everyone was making very big prints at the time. I somehow wanted to get back to a smaller, more intimate idea about what prints are. Less poster-like. I cut the blocks myself. I made sample prints, and then we went from there. FH Were you inking up the plates yourself, figur ing out the color? RM I made some tests with color and sent them out. And then Chris took it from there. And he did all the printing, didn't you? Chris Sukimoto Yes. FH You said that you wanted to set up a more inti mate kind of relationship with a print. RM Maybe I was just trying to figure out the role of printmaking for me.

And simply to redo drawings as prints didn't make sense. So I wanted to figure out some way that printmaking would be rewarding all by itself. And I've always loved making woodcuts. I enjoy carving them and it's something I can do in my own studio in my own time. And so I started developing this set of six woodcuts. FH You still do woodcuts. RM Yeah. FH Sylvia, do you do woodcuts? SPM I don't like woodcuts. If you make a mistake with a woodcut, you have to patch it—you need a magic wood. It's a process that you have to work out ahead, pretty much. RM For this series of three [Untitled etchings, 1995] I wanted to do a real good series of black-and white prints because I'd never done a full-scale print in black and white. DS This is a case of just putting the plate in the acid and letting something happen. This side was all open-bitten, and that's why there is an unevenness about the tone. RM I was doing drawings where I was rubbing graphite on watercolor paper and it would kind of pick up the surface texture. So they ran watercolor paper through the press with a soft ground, right? DS Yes. RA Is that dark line the plate edge? DSYes it is. We put a roulette around it so it would hold the ink. RM The goal was to do it on one plate. FH Why would that be the goal? RM Well, I just wanted a very simple black-and white print in as clean a way as I could imagine. These we decided to fold, too, 'cause I'd originally fooled with a center line. DS Though I didn't want to store them folded, because I was afraid the fold would become too prominent. We actually gave instructions to the framers to fold them and reinforce the fold. RM I wanted to establish the mid-point. And I'd toyed with doing it as an etched line. In none of them do they actually occur on the center. I may have been thinking of the idea of a book a little bit, I'm not sure. Again, I wanted to define printmaking in a different way than drawing. SPM [That Barnett Newman print] doesn't have a fold, it has a big black line. RM Oh, yes, I love Barnett Newman's prints, I'm just crazy about them. SPM These remind me of him. RM He is one of the great printmaking artists of the 20th century, even though he didn't actually do a lot of prints. FH What is it about them? RM They're really rich with ideas. I've probably studied his prints more than I have his paintings, because they're accessible, and you can get to them when you want to. Actually, I own a couple. FH With your painting, I think of fitting all these separate parts together. In prints, there's this whole other part that comes into play to make the whole—and that's the plate. RM In painting I roll the paint on, so, in a way, it's a process almost like printmaking. There's a distanc ing through a tool that connects it to printmaking. Plus I'm always involved in drawing—I draw lines on the paintings, I draw lines in the prints, and in the drawings. So everything in my work is as much 72 November-December 2000 Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Self Portrait, drypoint and aquatint (18 3/8x20-7/8 in.). 1994. Courtesy Simnielink/Suki moto Editions.

The woodcuts, especially. DS When you were doing those little woodcuts you were talking a lot about Albers. RM It's an odd connection, the Newman-Albers connection. At Yale, I didn't actually take a class with Albers. He was already gone. SPM But you were always so indignant about learning how to draw these ellipses and things. But then, Bob is such a terrific draftsman, he could do that Albers course in his sleep. And he would pick up his things as perfect examples .. . RM I don't know that that's true. SPM Oh yes, you were very good at doing those Albers things. RM We have different memories of things . . . FH Did you study with Albers? A SOUFFLE AND THE NEXT TIME IT'S SCRAMBLED EGGS AND ANOTHER TIME IT'S ..." I mean it got to be a road show. I didn't like it. But years later I came to appreciate a lot of his drawings and paintings and his prints. But espe cially his prints. SPM Even though he didn't like the Albers method, this is what art education is kind of miss ing now—this concrete way of proceeding. RM That kind of teaching is good when you can rebel against it. It works out well that way. Some people learn better if they go against the grain of what's being told to them. SPM Some people like to follow. RM Different teachers for different people. FH Different stories. So that brings us to Varied Figure Zone. RM This is the one we did here in Middletown. This is the first time I've done a print that goes SPM I took his course at Cooper Union with some one named Hans Beckmann, from the Bauhaus. RM But Albers had retired by that time.You maybe had one crit from him, right? SPM I had one crit of my painting where he came into my painting stall and said, "YOU MUST ONLY TELL ONE STORY AT A TIME." That was my lesson. RM I was at the Cleveland Institute before I went to Yale and Albers came to talk and it just turned me off. All the things you couldn't do, and that he didn't like, and I thought, this is so repressive. FH The irony is that the early woodcuts are actu ally quite free-spirited. RM Well, I think there's Albers the teacher and Albers the artist. It's quite different. Albers had quite a regimen. At least at Yale, he had become very formulaic, and he had any number of puppets that could get up and do the class.They'd almost do it with a German accent. "YOU PUT EGGS AND MILK TOGETHER AND ONE TIME IT'S right to the edge. I've done drawings like that.The nice thing about having Doris and Chris here is that they can come to my studio to see what I'm doing in drawings. Then they can say, well, we can try to do this, this way, or we can try to do some thing like that, that way. FH Do you think of the prints more in relation to drawing than to painting? RM I think so. In the beginning of my career as a printmaker, I'd do paintings and then I'd think, well maybe I'll try and do a print using these same images. But now, since I've been doing drawings that try things out in one direction or another, I'll also try them out in prints. But I might not end up doing a painting. It's a way of pursuing an idea, and another idea in another medium. Sometimes it ends there, and sometimes it goes on.

Courtesy Alexander and Bonin, New York. ; A Collaboration Continued from page 13 really like a separate section all by itself. So we ended up developing that as a separate piece, and these as well [ Varied Figure Zone (2 Part) and (i Part)]. So that parts of the four part print became two additional prints in the process. FH Something else you can do with prints—multiply them. RM Yeah. And we did it on different papers, in different ways. And I want ed to have kind of a deckled edge. So we worked on . . . what kind of paper was it? DS St. Armand—it's a handmade Canadian paper—it prints beautifully. RM And this is on Twinrocker. These sheets of paper had such funny shapes to them. DS Some of them have very exaggerated shapes—actual ly have little loops coming off the edges. FH So you used the same plates as for the four-part Varied Figure Zone. DS Yes—though actually we used different plates for the black because it had to be so dense. RM I didn't want the transparency that occurred in the black in the big one. I wanted the lines to stop. In the other, it's like a processional. Here I wanted the black to be anchored. How did you do that? DS This line plate was the same but the other one was remade and etched much more deeply to get a dense black that would print on top of these other two colors. FH That's what you said to them? "I want to stop it?" RMYes. DS This Twinrocker was actually quite difficult to print on because it's a watercolor paper, quite heavily sized. We actually got a batch without the final sizing. So it would print better. RM I tend to find papers that are very filled with size. DS That earlier Untitled black-and-white set was printed on a Fabriano paper that had so much sizing we had to change the blanket every three or four prints. So much of the sizing would go into the blankets and then start to stain the paper or they would get so stiff. So the blankets would be rewashed every night and then dried. RM [chuckling throughout last speech] I get very in volved in the paper we're printing on, and the paper that always prints the best . . . what's that paper called? SPM, DS, FH Somerset. RM That's always such a blah paper for me. Well, it's an absolutely wonderful paper for getting the image off the plate. I don't think any paper does better at it. And now I probably wouldn't mind using it so much if I'm not going to have a lot of paper around the edge. But I never like looking at Somerset paper. FH How about you, Sylvia? Are you as picky about the papers you choose? SM I am. But I like Somerset. I like Somerset because it's so great. DS Well it prints those delicate washes very well. SPM It picks up all kinds of stuff that other paper can't catch, so how can you not like it? DS One of the things we really like to do with Sylvia—and with Bob, too—is just to try to erase what's there to get beyond the surface of the copper. There are some really beauti ful things that come up. SPM You don't know how much went into that Winter Pin Oak [2000]. Even how many times I did these wash es ... I don't know how many times. I'd say eight is not an exaggeration. DS That's what's so interesting. There's so much work in the plate and then it's all minimized. SPM I worked on it for two years. FH Now are these printing techniques things both you and Doris know, or that over the years you've figured out? Do you help each other out? DS It's working together, yes—but mostly it's what Sylvia knows. She knows how to build the form. The more she knows about drypoint, the more she is able to come up with what she needs to do. SPM I wouldn't say that's right, because I don't know. It's just I know I don't want what I have. At a certain point you realize that you just keep pushing forward—not going backwards, not messing up what you did. Getting to that point of confidence takes a lot of experience. RM But you know more about the different etching techniques and things than I do. SPM I have such incredible tools. When I travel to Europe I buy tools. I have all different kinds of tools to help. It's just a kind of love. FH Did either of you study printmaking in school? SPM At Cooper Union I had a couple of courses with Will Barnet, who was a very good teacher. He taught me woodcut and lithography. RM I had a little bit of printmaking at Cleveland and Yale but it wasn't a very happy experience for me. I took print making with Peterdi at Yale. He was a very good teacher and a lot of people got a lot out of it, but I always found . . . it's complicated, it was the same way at Cleveland. I studied with someone who was a pupil of Lasansky. There was a tendency of people who were really involved in prints—they were printmakers, and they weren't very attuned to painters. It seemed to me when you went in there as a painter taking a printmaking course that they put up all these barriers. They made it seem so difficult to get an image that you'd go home and say, "Well, I'd rather do a drawing." The first person who didn't make me feel that way was at Yale-Norfolk summer school, where I had a teacher named Edmond Casarella. I did more prints in those six weeks than I had ever done at Cleveland or at Yale. And then I just forgot about it. It wasn't part of my daily rou 106 November December 2000 Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Winter Pin Oak. aquatint and drypoint (28 1/2x34 in.), 2000. Courtesy Alexander and Bonin, New York.</page><page sequence="8">tine or thoughts, although I did like to make woodcuts every now and then, just as images. I never made an edi tion. Then Bob Feldman sent me out to Kathan's [Crown Point Press] in 1971 or '72 and the attitude of Jeryl and Kathan and the people out there was whatever you want to try to do we'll figure out a way to do it. And it was such a different way of approaching it than what I'd been through in the classes, where it was like, well, first you've got to get an image that's worthy of putting on a plate. And then if you can find something worthy of putting on a plate, then we'll . . . anyway, it was such a different way of dealing with it. At Yale, there were a lot of people doing etchings, and I'm sure Peterdi was a good teacher. FH Sounds like you were in a real rebellious mood. SPM He was! He was a rebellious person! RM Yale was a weird place, and maybe it still is. It was then. The sculptors had their camp, and if you were a painter and wanted to work in sculpture, it was totally closed off. It was Sculptor's Territory. And the printmakers had their territory. So you didn't feel like you were wel come, in a way. There were barriers put up. FH Was that your experience, too? SPM I did art history. I had no interest in sculpture what soever. I mean, they were doing this modular ... RM They were all doing very Albersian, swirling, Gabo type work. SPM If I went down to the sculpture department during those two years it would be because I had a friend who was down there. These were territories. FH So when you crossed over it was to history rather than other media? SPM It all helped me think about what my goals might be—about dichotomy and conflict—and the levels at which you can enter into cultural objects. I was very seri ous—and Yale and Cooper Union were excellent educa tions—I especially appreciate that now as I see young artists who don't have all those resources and so they find ideas in technology. I was not a graduate student [atYale]—I got my B.F.A. I didn't have to take too many student courses. RM Sylvia didn't have to take the Yale drawing course— the Albers color course. SPM Plus I was working—I worked every night as a waitress at that time. RM And we got married the first year. SPM The first year we met, which was my second year at Yale [1961], FH Did you make prints before you met Doris? SPM The first print with Doris was when Feldman sent me to Crown Point, where I discovered printmaking wasn't such an isolated activity from what happens in your studio. It was a primary activity. The more I worked on a plate, I found out what you could do with it, and how indestructible it is. I would try to keep working on it, but still keep it so that it looked factual. RM One of the problems Sylvia has with watercolor is that you have to only work to a certain point, and then there's a watercolor. And Sylvia likes to work longer. So sometimes she overworks the watercolor, and she gets so annoyed. But with the print process she can keep going and go back and forward, and it gives you a flexibility. SPM Doris has to hold me back sometimes. I just want to go at it and go at it and not stop. FH Do you listen to her? SPM Yeah . . . DS Hold on, Sylvia. I'll already have two plates inked up and ready to go through the press and she's still following me with the roulette. But that's what's fun about being a printmaker. Being a printmaker this way. But Sylvia and I have a friendship, too—it's not just that you come to the shop and we're working together. RM Yeah, you're great friends. DS We 've been working together for a long time, and we do things besides make prints together. I think that enters into the whole experience, too. SPM But we weren't friends when we first met and I still thought you were terrific. So it didn't have to do with friendship, but with paying attention to the artist and try ing to help them get at what they're trying to get at. Being awake, and involved, and generous. DS Both Bob and Sylvia really devote an amazing amount of attention to the work, which is what then makes you want to devote that much attention to it. FH And it doesn't feel like it's taking away from your painting at all? RM It is taking away from the painting. DSYou feel that? RM But both Sylvia and I really love prints. We always go to the [IFPDA] Print Fair. We like to buy prints. SPM I own a Japanese print that is equal to any painting. RM So many people don't understand about working with prints, the effort that goes into it. They somehow think they're like posters or something. They have no clue. Sylvia once said to a collector, "Are you going to the print show?" And this collector, who will remain nameless, said, "Oh, we don't like prints," and Sylvia said, "Don't you like art?" FH She's our hero! RM The thing that can really make you feel good is that lots of people can afford your work. DS Having worked at Crown and Gemini, and then doing some on our own, I don't think I've ever worked with an artist who doesn't put care and attention into the making of a print. Artists don't think of it as reproduction. It's the nature of artists to approach whatever they're going to do with their image in a very serious way. SPM To make a print really slows you down; to make a shape takes—you have to make it inside out and outside in. So it's such a great vehicle for students' ideas. Because they have to take them apart. For me, it's affected my painting more than the painting has affected the prints. Editors' Note: A major monograph, Robert Mangold, has just been released by Phaidon Press. The Varied Figure Zone prints are available in New York at Senior &amp; Shopmaker Gal lery. Aside from Simmelink/Sukimoto, Pace Editions and Brooke Alexander Editions have recently published prints by Mangold. Plimack Mangold's prints are available at Alexander and Bonin.

Then Bob Feldman sent me out to Kathan's [Crown Point Press] in 1971 or '72 and the attitude of Jeryl and Kathan and the people out there was whatever you want to try to do we'll figure out a way to do it. And it was such a different way of approaching it than what I'd been through in the classes, where it was like, well, first you've got to get an image that's worthy of putting on a plate. And then if you can find something worthy of putting on a plate, then we'll . . . anyway, it was such a different way of dealing with it. At Yale, there were a lot of people doing etchings, and I'm sure Peterdi was a good teacher. FH Sounds like you were in a real rebellious mood. SPM He was! He was a rebellious person! RM Yale was a weird place, and maybe it still is. It was then. The sculptors had their camp, and if you were a painter and wanted to work in sculpture, it was totally closed off. It was Sculptor's Territory. And the printmakers had their territory. So you didn't feel like you were wel come, in a way. There were barriers put up. FH Was that your experience, too? SPM I did art history. I had no interest in sculpture what soever. I mean, they were doing this modular ... RM They were all doing very Albersian, swirling, Gabo type work. SPM If I went down to the sculpture department during those two years it would be because I had a friend who was down there. These were territories. FH So when you crossed over it was to history rather than other media? SPM It all helped me think about what my goals might be—about dichotomy and conflict—and the levels at which you can enter into cultural objects. I was very seri ous—and Yale and Cooper Union were excellent educa tions—I especially appreciate that now as I see young artists who don't have all those resources and so they find ideas in technology. I was not a graduate student [atYale]—I got my B.F.A. I didn't have to take too many student courses. RM Sylvia didn't have to take the Yale drawing course— the Albers color course. SPM Plus I was working—I worked every night as a waitress at that time. RM And we got married the first year. SPM The first year we met, which was my second year at Yale [1961], FH Did you make prints before you met Doris? SPM The first print with Doris was when Feldman sent me to Crown Point, where I discovered printmaking wasn't such an isolated activity from what happens in your studio. It was a primary activity. The more I worked on a plate, I found out what you could do with it, and how indestructible it is. I would try to keep working on it, but still keep it so that it looked factual. RM One of the problems Sylvia has with watercolor is that you have to only work to a certain point, and then there's a watercolor. And Sylvia likes to work longer. So sometimes she overworks the watercolor, and she gets so annoyed. But with the print process she can keep going and go back and forward, and it gives you a flexibility. SPM Doris has to hold me back sometimes. I just want to go at it and go at it and not stop. FH Do you listen to her? SPM Yeah . . . DS Hold on, Sylvia. I'll already have two plates inked up and ready to go through the press and she's still following me with the roulette. But that's what's fun about being a printmaker. Being a printmaker this way. But Sylvia and I have a friendship, too—it's not just that you come to the shop and we're working together. RM Yeah, you're great friends. DS We 've been working together for a long time, and we do things besides make prints together. I think that enters into the whole experience, too. SPM But we weren't friends when we first met and I still thought you were terrific. So it didn't have to do with friendship, but with paying attention to the artist and try ing to help them get at what they're trying to get at. Being awake, and involved, and generous. DS Both Bob and Sylvia really devote an amazing amount of attention to the work, which is what then makes you want to devote that much attention to it. FH And it doesn't feel like it's taking away from your painting at all? RM It is taking away from the painting. DSYou feel that? RM But both Sylvia and I really love prints. We always go to the [IFPDA] Print Fair. We like to buy prints. SPM I own a Japanese print that is equal to any painting. RM So many people don't understand about working with prints, the effort that goes into it. They somehow think they're like posters or something. They have no clue. Sylvia once said to a collector, "Are you going to the print show?" And this collector, who will remain nameless, said, "Oh, we don't like prints," and Sylvia said, "Don't you like art?" FH She's our hero! RM The thing that can really make you feel good is that lots of people can afford your work.
