<plain_text><page sequence="1">86 REVIEWS Alan F. Segal, Two Powers in Heaven. Early Rabbinic Reports about Christianity and Gnosticism (Studies in Judaism in Late Antiquity, 25). Leiden, Brill, 1977. XXVI, 313 pp. This book was a dissertation of Yale University and is now published in printed form by Brill at Leyden. It discusses all existing rabbinic passages about Jewish heretics and others who proclaim that there are two principles. The best known of these is rabbi Elisha ben Abuya, called Aher (- 100 C.E.), who is said to have seen Metatron, the Angel of the Lord or Jaoel, sitting and writing down the merits of Israel, from which he con- cluded that perhaps there are two deities. The young doctor has applied the methods of form-criticism to all these items and discussed them with great care and caution. His conclusions are convincing. There is no indi- cation whatsoever that these views have anything to do with Iranian dualism. Nor are the opponents aimed at always the same. Sometimes they may be Gnostics, other times Christians and as often as not heterodox Jews. By the end of the second century dualists who oppose the two powers are being called "two powers" heretics, but before that time there is no evidence for any opposing configuration of two deities among the heretics. They rather were Jews who were worried about anthropomorphism. Bibilical theophanies which picture God as a man or confuse the Lord with an angel are the basis of this tradition, which distinguishes between a completely transcendent God and His revelation in anthropomorphic shape. The rabbinic texts can be ascribed in general to the third century. However, the earliest reports can be safely dated to the Bar Kochba Revolt. And an extensive oral period must have preceded our first witnesses. In a special chapter devoted to Philo it is shown that this Jewish philosopher of the first century C.E. must have been familiar with these traditions to which in part he reacts and by which he was profoundly influenced. After all Philo does say that the Logos is a second God. The earliest form of this heresy involved assuming any anthropomorphic description in the Bible to have been concerning a divinity seperate from God. Closely connected with this heresy were mystical and apocalyptic traditions about the divine Name, the Angel of the Lord and Adam. The speculations about Christ as the Proper Name of God in the Valentinian Gospel of Truth are an indirect witness to these Jewish traditions. I could not agree more with the views of the author. I only add that then the demiurge of the Mandaeans, Ptahil or the angel Gabriel,</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 87 originates in these early Jewish circles. Moreover, a pupil of mine, Jarl Fossum, is preparing a thesis on the relevant Samaritan material, which clearly shows the impact of Plato's Timaeus upon these speculations. From these new insights Segal draws the necessary conclusions. Gnosticism, according to him, appears to be a later, sophisticated version of this heresy, dividing up the principal mediator, the Angel of the Lord, into a good saviour and a not so good demiurge. The Gnostic saviour then, or bearer of revelation, in so far as it is not Christ, goes back to the Jewish concept of the Angel of the Lord. And at the same time the Gnostic demiurge has inherited all the anthropomorphic features, such as the handicraft of a workman, from the same concept (this, by the way, explains why the Gnostic demiurge is so often designated as an angel). According to the author, all this tends to disconfirm the hypothesis, according to which Christianity is patterned on a preexistent Gnostic salvation myth in which a redeemed redeemer enters the world to save those who recognise him. Instead, angelic christology may be more ancient and more important in understanding the early church than is usually granted. Here Segal agrees with Edwin Yamauchi, who in his book Pre-Christian Gnosticism, Grand Rapids 1973, has given a general survey of the whole relevant material and concludes that the imposing scholarly edifice of Reitzenstein's and Bultmann's hypotheses is little more than a house of cards (p. 184). This of course does not mean that everything Usener or Dieterich or Bousset wrote was wrong. It does mean, however, that in the light of the present evidence Erik Peterson was right and that Jewish authors on Gnosticism are being rehabilitated. Bilthoven, N. Houdringelaan 32 G.
