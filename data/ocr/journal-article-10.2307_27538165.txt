<plain_text><page sequence="1">SK. LITERATURE AND KNOWLEDGE By EL?SEO VIVAS THE claim that art gives us knowledge is as old as West ern aesthetics, and in our own age it has been made for all the arts by both aestheticians and critics. Thus, while distinguishing aesthetic knowledge or expression from other kinds of knowledge, Croce, Collingwood and T. M. Greene assert that art is a vehicle of knowledge. Recently Morris Weitz has made a similar claim. Among critics we find Allen T?te asserting that "literature is the complete knowledge of man's experience," Van Ogden Vogt tells us that from a little brass tray typical of Saracenic art you could "describe almost off hand the main characteristics of the life from which it came, as a scientist reconstructs some old dinosaur from one of the fossil bones. You could conjure, for instance, the whole struc ture of fatalism in philosophy, despotism in government, the abstract decoration, the polygamy, and everything else from beggar to caliph that belonged in the same world with the little piece of brass." And Cecil Gray quotes Schweitzer with ap proval, to the effect that the dogma of the Trinity "can be ex pressed much more clearly and satisfactorily in music than in verbal formula." When we consider the multiplicity of the claims and the complexity of the problem they pose, it becomes evident that it would be hopeless to try to discuss it in the</page><page sequence="2">562 LITERATURE AND KNOWLEDGE compass of a short essay. We would have to examine criti cally the typical claims and order them in some sort of fashion, and we would have to consider them in reference to the different arts. For it is obvious that literature seems to give us something that at least looks as well as feels like knowledge, but only a top-flight musicologist like Schweitzer can read off the dogma of the Trinity from Bach. Let us therefore turn to the easiest of the questions that can be asked under the general problem: "Does literature give us knowledge?" This is not a small ques tion ; but it is not altogether beyond the possibility of a sketchy answer in a short essay. Nor is it quite as restrictive as it may at first blush seem ; the generic traits shared by the arts ought to make it possible to learn from one of them about the others, when appropriate modifications and allowances are made. Since the argument rests on a few key distinctions, it is es sential to grasp firmly the terms by means of which they are conveyed. I have adopted, with a minor modification, the ter minology that A. C. Bradley used in his inaugural dissertation, and with it I have accepted, of course, his substantive analysis.1 Within the experiential resources that are brought by the writer to the creative act, I mark off those resources that are distinctly aesthetic, because they have functioned as such in the creation of other aesthetic objects or in the training of the artist, from those resources to which we may refer as experiential in a wide sense of the term. The term "form" (employed usually in the plural) and the term "subject matter" mark this distinction. The term "the informed substance" of the work of literature, is used to point to the non-aesthetic aspect of the subject matter after it has been elaborated in the creative process and to indicate the intimate nature of the relationship in which the forms, as trans formed by the act of creation, stand to the substance, as transub stantiated by the same act. Thus it is assumed that the inform 1A. C. Bradley, "Poetry for Poetry's Sake," in Oxford Lectures on Poetry (Lon don, 1914), pp. 3-34.</page><page sequence="3">el?seo vivas 563 ing forms can be disinguished from the informed substance by a critic, for his purposes; but that they cannot be separated. The validity of this distinction is denied on organicist grounds by some aestheticians like Weitz. Consistently with the denial it can be argued by organicists that no resource which the writer brings to the creative act can properly be called aesthetic until it is used in the creation of the aesthetic object; and that all resources so used are aesthetic. These assertions are unobject ionable if they are taken to refer to the object within the aes thetic transaction. But the distinction between informing forms and informed substance is essential for criticism and for the resolution of our problem, although to argue this claim would require an essay of the length of the one I propose to write. Here I can only say that the distinction will justify itself prag matically in what follows. Note finally that the knowledge which is in question in this paper is that which can be tested by positive methods because the thing known is in some sense in dependent of the formulated knowledge and is referred to by the latter. But we cannot forbid anyone the right to use the term "knowledge" in any sense he chooses, so long as its mean ing is exhibited with satisfactory clarity.2 I If the function of literature were to imitate something which exists prior to the act of imitation and independently of it, as was generally believed until about the end of the eighteenth century, our problem would not be difficult. Our only question would be that which is argued between Plato and Aristotle as to the quality of the knowledge that art gives. But contemporary aesthetics almost universally rejects or simply ignores the classi 2I have in mind the claims made for the cognitive value of art by aestheticians like Croce and R. G. Collingwood. The latter tells us that art pursues "not a truth of relation," but "a truth of individual fact." In the context Collingwood makes clear what he means by truth of individual fact. The Principles of Art (Oxford, 1935).</page><page sequence="4">564 LITERATURE AND KNOWLEDGE cal theory. According to a contemporary interpreter of Aristotle, Richard McKeon, artistic imitation is "the presentation of an aspect of things in matter other than its natural matter." And this is possible because "the form joined to matter in the physi cal world is the same form that is expressed in the matter of art." Contemporary aesthetics does not deny that the writer does indeed take from the world both forms and subject matter and that the creative process turns these into the informed sub stance of his work; he is not God and cannot create out of nothing. But it argues that the Aristotelian account does not do justice to the creative process. For the writer does not gather up a form waiting to be picked up; his is an activity which for good reasons men have agreed to call "creative." The creative process consists of a wrenching by the artist of a form (or complex of forms) from the heart of nature or of the human actions which constitute his subject matter. But the form is not fully realized in the subject matter from which the artist pries it loose; nor is it partially realized in the exact manner in which the artist would have it. The artist must di vine the form that is potential in the matter of his experience, where ordinary men who lack his gift do not even suspect it to be hiding. But his guess is creative, because he does not take some of his forms from here and some from there and put them together like a jigsaw puzzle. He does this. But he also adds to the forms that he takes, and subtracts from them, by activi ties for the most part unconscious, which are conditioned by factors which neither the artist, the psychologist, nor the aesthe tician seems to be able to get at. The subject matter also has to be added to and whittled off, and it has its own stubborn way against which the artist must work. Artists, of course, vary widely in all respects, but it simply does not seem possible that they compose good poetry in the manner in which Poe tells us that he wrote The Raven. The genuine work of art comes from</page><page sequence="5">el?seo vivas 565 the unknown depths of the soul, where its growth is even more mysterious than the development of a foetus. The artist, moved by forces over which he exercises only limited conscious control, does not know clearly what he wants to say till the labor of the file is finished and he can discover his intention in his com position. Imitation assumes a conscious clarity about the end that the artist seeks to accomplish that does not square with the facts as we know them. Note, however, that the language I have used in speaking of the creative activity is not intended as explanatory. All it is intended to do is to catch impressionisti cally some of the important aspects of the creative act which can be observed or which must be posited, in terms that are frankly animistic and metaphorical. The analysis of these phe nomena in scientific terms is something which, so far as I can discover, is a long way off yet. Nor do I intend by what I have said to relegate the labor of creation exclusively to any particular level of the mind. So far as we know, artists vary considerably in respect to where the gestation and the finishing of their work takes place.3 But why, the puzzled reader may ask, beat a dead horse? The answer is that aestheticians have been sending to the press no tices of the demise of the imitation theory which are indelicately premature. It is true that outside of the "Chicago School of Criticism" the imitation theory has very few open defenders today. But the idea of imitation is frequently employed even by those who repudiate it explicitly, and the interest in the problem of art and knowledge which at the moment seems to 3The documents which justify these observations are so numerous as to be over whelming.

Anderson and others, The Basis of Artistic Crea tion in the Arts (New Brunswick, 1942); Phyllis Bartlett, Poems in Process (New York, 1951); Brand Blanshard, The Nature of Thought (London, 1939), Chapters XXI, XXII; Arthur R.

Some of these works, especially Rusu's, contain valuable bibliographies on the subject of the creative activity.</page><page sequence="6">566 literature and knowledge engage the energy of our up-and-coming young aestheticians almost exclusively has brought it back with renewed vigor, al though more often than not under a new alias and with false face. Nor can we ever expect to eliminate it altogether as a theory to contend with in aesthetics, since it points with a modi cum of adequacy to a fact which cannot be overlooked by the aesthetician and the critic. It seems therefore necessary to re view the grounds on which it has been repudiated, lest the in dispensable gain made by aesthetics in the last one hundred and fifty years be lost sight of, and lest the solution of our problem be speciously and too easily achieved. If we are asked what evidence we have for the belief that the mind adds to what it takes from experience, we can answer that a thorough examination of an artistic tradition, or of a single work, which discriminates all discoverable influences, reveals novelty which cannot be traced to these influences; or, other wise stated, that with the knowledge we possess we are far from being able to predict in its full specificity, the composition which a writer will achieve when he sets out to write. The late Alfred Einstein, discussing this very point, speaks of Mozart's creative listening. This phrase applies to all genuine artists and serves to distinguish them from the mere imitator of life or art. The artist perceives creatively; nor will an indefinite extension of the work done by John Livingston Lowes on "Kubla Khan" exhaust what any sensitive reader of the poem is able to find in it. Clearly, even when this argument is looked at sympa thetically it cannot be claimed for it that it adduces evidence that can be expected to convince an embattled mechanist. I ac cept it with the proviso that it requires the reinterpretation I shall offer below. Anyone who asserts or denies the spontaneity of the mind can do so only on grounds that go beyond our limited positive knowledge of what goes on beyond the range of direct observation, as the writer busies himself with the labor of composition; the assertion or denial is therefore purely specu</page><page sequence="7">EL?SEO VIVAS 567 lative or philosophical. But within the area of aesthetics proper it ought to be remembered that those who have first-hand ac quaintance with an artistic tradition, or with the work of any one artist, have felt that their experience favors the hypothesis of creativity. A thinker who approaches experience with humility cannot disregard this fact, nor will he be taken in by the coarse and altogether unphilosophical analogies between the human mind and calculating machines. But if it is positive evidence of the sort found in physics that is required to settle the issue, those who reject the notion of creativity ought to admit that in respect to such tests as they demand the problem remains an open one?until they are able to furnish us with an exhaustive analysis of the genesis of a genuine poem in which it is actually shown how the poem is to be traced to psychological or sociologi cal factors that are causally related to it. In the absence of such data, at the phenomenal level at least, and from the standpoint of both critic and writer, a genuine work of literature contains novelty. It is essential for criticism to emphasize this fact, until it is positively disproved, since it constitutes the indispensable basis for part of its work. Without assuming novelty the critic could not attribute excellence to the work of art. To sacrifice the practical role of criticism to a general philosophical theory, particularly one the coarseness of which ought by now to be so patent as is that of mechanism, is not wisdom and is not em piricism. A more complete analysis of the aesthetic transaction adds another factor that widens the distance that we find between literature and the actual world. The literary work is not merely endowed with novelty ; it is generally recognized by aestheticians today that in the aesthetic transaction it also appears as self sufficient or autonomous, in the sense that, as I am wont to put it, it is able to capture attention intransitively upon itself, and is thus able to prevent the mind from seeking comparisons between it and the actual world. Because this is one of the points on</page><page sequence="8">568 literature and knowledge which aestheticians are almost unanimous today, it is not neces sary here to do more than to refer to it.4 As readers, we go to the poem with minds stocked with knowledge, and the better stocked our minds are the better readers we make. But what we focus attention on is what we have before our mind's eye, a unique, self-evident and self-contained presentation which in hibits philosophic or scientific inquiries, inhibits the practical need to resolve moral perplexities as well as the need to respond to any objects within the work in an explicitly religious mode. This is the phenomenon towards which the phrase "suspension of disbelief" points without explaining how the work of art en ables the reader to do it. How to explain the sense in which art embodies meanings which are not referential and are yet in some sense meaningful, and how to account for the mechanism by means of which it performs this feat, is a difficult problem which it is easy to overlook or to brush aside. It has been said by an analytic philosopher that Mrs. L?ngeres "presentational symbol" is a contradiction in terms because for her the symbol does not represent or stand for anything beyond itself. This is hacking at a problem with a verbal meatcleaver. On the other hand, the fact is not explained by pointing to it with a fancy label, and neither the expression "presentational symbol" nor the notion of "icon" does more than refer to the fact. But it is essential to point to the fact of intransitivity, for it is determina tive of the aesthetic transaction. The diversity of theoretical con texts with which we can approach aesthetics enables us to en visage the fact in a multiplicity of ways. From the standpoint of the reader, the phrase "the captive mind" conveys the fact, since the reader's attention is imprisoned and utterly engrossed. Sometimes it is so thoroughly captured that the word "ecstasy" ^Innumerable aestheticians since Schopenhauer have insisted on the self-sufficiency of the aesthetic experience. See my "A Definition of the Esthetic Experience," in The Journal of Philosophy, XXIV, 23, 628 ff. Also "A Natural History of the Aes thetic Transaction," in Naturalism and the Human Spirit (New York, 1934), pp. 99 ff. The philosophy, if such it may be called, in terms of which the facts are interpreted in these essays, is false and has long been repudiated by the writer.</page><page sequence="9">EL?SEO VIVAS 569 is quite an appropriate designation of the state, since the basic and ever-present sense that we carry with us of ourselves as distinct from the world tends to vanish, and on rare and fortu nate occasions it disappears entirely. If the facts of creativity and intransivity are accepted, it fol lows that literature cannot give us knowledge about the world. But serious intercourse with literature, which is not controlled by doctrinaire presuppositions, will reveal to us that this is not the end of the matter; for literature does seem to have in some sense or other a resemblance to life or to the world. Nor is the novelty imported by the creative mind into the literary work an obstacle to its conveying knowledge. Indeed, the better the work, the greater its originality, and the more capable it is of capturing our mind, the deeper the knowledge it seems to be able to give us. II The strategies used by those who deny that literature is a vehicle of knowledge are many, nor could we examine them all. But at least two of these ought to be referred to in passing, since they have been profoundly influential not only in contemporary aesthetics but in contemporary criticism. One of these is perhaps best represented by John Dewey. He tells us that "no genuine work of art has ever been a repetition of anything that pre viously existed." Therefore, art cannot give us knowledge about our world. But Dewey cannot deny that in our inter course with literature we get something wThich feels very similar to what we experience when we acquire knowledge. These ex periences, he tells us, can be translated naturally as meaning that art enriches immediate experience.5 The expression theory has had to share dominance in the last twenty-five years with the doctrine of I. A. Richards, whose aesthetics constitutes the most systematic defense of poetry that 5John Dewey, Art as Experience (New York, 1934), P- 288.</page><page sequence="10">570 literature and knowledge we can find in the English language. But Richards also denies the cognitive claims of art. The function of art is not to give us knowledge, but to organize our attitudes. What we find in literature are not genuine statements, but pseudo-statements. In this manner, Richards attempted to prove that literature, and especially poetry, in which he is primarily interested, is "worth the devotion of the keenest hours of the best minds."6 It is a question of great interest, although not one precisely pertinent to our main subject, whether Richards's defense of literature does not, in fact, end up by digging a deeper grave for it than would have been dug by the forces from which he tried to rescue it. For he defended it on what we may call "therapeutic grounds." Religion, he tells us, was able, once upon a time, to organize our attitudes; but science has made it impossible for us today to take its claims seriously. But since religion performed an essential task, we must let literature do what religion no longer is able to do. Before we yield to the impulse to dismiss this doctrine as both psychologically and so ciologically naive, it is only fair to remember that The Princi ples of Literary Criticism was written at a time when it was much more difficult than it is today to grasp how false was the shallow positivistic notion that religion can be dispensed with or substituted for. But aside from this it is difficult to understand how lovers of poetry failed to see through Richards's defense. It constitutes an unanswerable indictment of our confusions that critics and amateurs of art accepted so readily Richards's doc trine as a defense of art, when at its heart the doctrine showed no awareness of the fact that art has a function all its own. According to Richards, the basic function of poetry is to organize our attitudes. But if this is its justification, it must and should give way to any agency which can perform it more efficiently. With the development of psychiatry, or with the development within us of a viable faith capable of engrossing and orienting 8I. A. Richards, The Principles of Literary Criticism (New York, 1925), p. 7.</page><page sequence="11">EL?SEO VIVAS 571 our energies, the need for poetry disappears. But poetry can at best organize the attitudes of the small minority that can read it and it can do it only in an unstable and accidental man ner. For obviously whether Milton or Calder?n can organize a man's attitudes depends not merely on the poet but on the man, and obviously the organization it is able to achieve cannot last long. An effective faith or a developed psychiatry should be able to organize anyone's attitudes and should do it in a stable fashion. The faith need not be one that is universal and capable of pragmatic verification because it is creative of stable culture. Any faith will do, so long as it awakens our energies and orients us towards an end. For that purpose, the faith of a Schweitzer cannot be called more effective than the faith of a Goebbels. If Richards is right, then, his defense of literature can at best only give us a stay of execution for poetry. It cannot expect to save it from ultimate elimination. And this is true of any defense of literature that fails to realize the fact that art has a function to perform in the human economy for which there can be no substitution. Be that as it may, those who maintain that literature is a vehicle of knowledge reply to the defenders of the expression and the organization theories that more than the subjective or ganization of attitudes or more than something that merely feels like knowledge is involved in the reading of literature. And they base their claim on the resemblance between literature and the world. That the imitation theory ignores the novelty of the work of literature is true. That in the aesthetic trans action the resemblance between the work of literature and the world is irrelevant and does not obtrude itself for consideration is also true. It is also true that a work of literature gives us a rich experience. That the richness of the experience has its source in the fact that literature creates order where chaos reigned, by organizing our attitudes, may be true. But litera ture does more. Literature gives us a grasp of the world which</page><page sequence="12">572 literature and knowledge is in some sense reflected in it. Richards tells us that The Waste Land is merely music of ideas, and that the ideas in the poem are arranged "not that they may tell us something, but that their effects in us may combine into a coherent whole of feeling and attitude and produce a peculiar liberation of the will." Let us assume that we know what we mean by the pretty phrase, "the music of ideas." Is this all that we can get from The Waste Land} Can we prevent the ideas of the poem from tell ing us something of the quality of contemporary life? Colling wood finds that in The Waste Land, Eliot "has expressed his idea (not his alone) of the decay of our civilization, manifested outwardly as a breakdown of social structures and inwardly as a drying-up of the emotional springs of life."7 Whether this is what the poem expressed or not can be easily ascertained by anyone who reads it; and whether Eliot is right or wrong about our civilization is susceptible of confirmation. If the reader had already made up his mind, before reading The Waste Land, that the condition of the world was such as was expressed by Eliot in his poem, he might be able to add a depth to his in sight that he did not possess before he read it, and not merely an emotional but a cognitive depth. At this point the defender of Dewey will want to interpose 7Op. cit., p. 295. That literature has at various times exercised profound cogni tive influence, both revolutionary and conservative, is a matter of historical record and cannot be denied. For its influence on theology, during the period and area indicated by the title, see L. E. Elliott-Binns, The Development of English Theology hi the Later Nineteenth Century (London, 1952), pp. 3-5. Theodor Reik confirms something we have known all along when he tells us that in his opinion "it is more useful for the student of psychology to read the great writers?Shakespeare, Dos toevski, Nietzsche, Tolstoy?than The Psychoanalytic Quarterly." And he adds, "Our students could learn more and better from such sources . . . than from psychiatric textbooks that muddy the waters with scientific terminology in an effort to make them appear deep." If this is what a psychologist finds in literature, why does not Richards find it? The answer is that empiricists are as given as others to cutting the legs of facts to make them fit into the beds of their theories. Were Richards to admit the fact that in some sense we can learn from literature, his aesthetics would collapse. Listening with the Third Ear, (Garden City, 1948), pp. 99-100. In view of the thesis developed in the last section of this essay, it is interesting to note that Reik distinguishes between the job of the scientist and that of the artist; the artist "shapes" emotional processes of an unconscious kind while the scientist "investigates" them.</page><page sequence="13">el?seo vivas 573 a remark. Whatever is true of Richards, for whose ideas he is not responsible, he will submit, it is precisely the failure to notice the special way in which the work of literature functions in the aesthetic experience that Dewey objects to. For Dewey, the work of art exists only in the aesthetic experience, and the work out of the experience is not the same as the work in it. Out of the experience what there is is paper with marks on it, or perhaps, if it is being read in a non-aesthetic mode, sociologi cal data, or perhaps phrases and incidents that have been dis joined and cannot any longer be considered parts of the work of art, since they are not functioning aesthetically to make up a self-sufficient whole. But for anyone who knows how to read poetry, The Waste Land is not a sociological document or a more or less incoherent jumble of phrase and images, but a complete aesthetic experience. This is indeed the case on Dewey's objective relativism; and I will not argue against it. What needs to be shown is that, even if we grant the truth of Dewey's observation, both Richards and the expression theory misinter pret the relation between the work-in-the-transaction and the work-out-of-it. It is true that the artist makes something new out of the stuff of his experience, both in respect to matter and form; and it may also be true that the work of art exists only in the aesthetic transaction. But from these facts it does not follow that the reader cannot carry out of the transaction and into the world of affairs the informed substance of the work to use it for his own non-aesthetic purposes. That he does it is a fact. How he manages to carry it out and to what uses he puts it is what must be explained. Ill It is, then, these seemingly contradictory considerations that set our problem. On the one hand, we have seen that the writer is creative and that in the aesthetic transaction the work of litera ture appears to the reader as self-sufficient; on the other, that</page><page sequence="14">574 LITERATURE AND KNOWLEDGE literature is or seems to be a vehicle of knowledge. But if the former is true, the latter cannot be true. Yet neither the former nor the latter can be denied. There are similarities between the work of literature and the world by means of which the work can tell us something about the world. But in spite of them the work obeys its own laws, so to speak, and does not refer to the world. That a work of literature is not like life is as irrelevant as is the fact that a painting of Pollock is unlike anything we have ever seen in nature. To criticize Kafka because in actual life little balls do not follow a man upstairs to his flat when he returns from his job is as irrelevant as it would be to reject Shakespeare because we know that ghosts cannot appear to their sons and ask them to revenge them. But if this is the case, what criterion of confirmation can be offered by those who assert that literature gives us knowledge? And what kind of knowledge does it give us, if the knowledge it gives is not about the world? It would seem, therefore, that if we claim that literature gives us knowledge, we have to deny its self-sufficiency and its novel ty ; and if we assert its self-sufficiency and its novelty, we have to deny that it is a vehicle of knowledge. In order to resolve this seeming difficulty we must investigate what the literary art ist does in the work and what kind of continuity exists between literature and the world. For these are the bases for asserting that the work of literature has a distinctive function to perform in the human economy. If we define this function properly, the question as to whether we classify it under knowledge or not, and what is its relation to positive knowledge (or knowledge in the narrow sense of the term) is one that answers itself. Our solution of this problem will be most easily grasped if we first turn to a concrete illustration and attempt on its basis to arrive at an abstract formulation of what the writer does and of the use to which his product can be put. For our illustration let us take Celine's novel, Journey to the End of the Night. There are several reasons for selecting this</page><page sequence="15">el?seo vivas 575 disagreeable novel, which should become clear as our examina tion of it proceeds. The novel tells about the adventures of its narrator-hero, named Ferdinand. He joins up early in 1914 as the Germans advance on Paris and is discharged after a period in a psychiatric hospital. He goes to Africa, gets shanghaied and shipped off in a boat going to the United States. In New York he jumps ship and finally goes to Detroit in search of work. He returns to France and studies medicine and practices in the environs of Paris. The novel consists of a number of characters and a succession of dramatic episodes which constitute a fictional wrorld of deserters, cowards, stupid officers, murderers, lechers, heartless exploiters, the whole unsavory mess drenched in hatred, distrust, ill-will?in a word, the novel presents us with a thoroughly evil fictional world. Let us assume that we have read it carefully. Is all we can do to grasp by careful reading what the author offers us for our apprehension? We have not finished with the book until we have digested our experience. This act of digesting the reading of a work of literature may or may not be chronologically con tinuous with the aesthetic experience. In some cases it may take place considerably later than the reading, after other ex periences enable us to grasp the meaning of what we read; in others it may even happen during the reading, in those periods of oscillation away from intransitive attention upon the object. In any case, the act of digesting is distinguishable and often separable from the aesthetic transaction. In the reading of a long work, the normal mind, incapable of sustained intransitive attention for a long period of time, will find itself oscillating between the aesthetic transaction and the critical activity. But whether we do it as we read it or afterwards, having grasped intransitively what is presented to our attention, we must try to master its powerful impact. In order to do so we seek to de termine what it will do or has done to our convictions about men and the world. To claim that what Journey does is not</page><page sequence="16">576 LITERATURE AND KNOWLEDGE done to our intellect but to our attitudes exclusively?to dis tinguish between our cognitive and our emotive response and to claim that our reading of Journey elicits a purely emotive re sponse?is to take an analytic distinction which is perfectly valid at the conceptual level as if it referred to phenomena that actually existed in us in separate compartments, and to command us to keep it separate ; and this is a patently arbitrary impera tive. All that we need consider here is that the imperative is not an aesthetic one but a moral one and that its effect, if obeyed, would be to compartmentalize life even more than it already is, and to foster schizophrenia. Journey undoubtedly affects us emotively. But this is not its exclusive effect on us. For a picture of man has been presented to us which does not jibe with what we know precisely because at least one of the factors constituting its novelty consists in excluding almost ab solutely from the work itself those aspects which in actual life modify and disguise the malice of which men are capable. And the failure of the picture to jibe with what we previously knew about men instigates the need to digest the picture. This is the critical tasky or, at least, an essential part of it. We do not un dertake it for extrinsic reasons. We undertake it because it is a necessity, since the novel has left us disturbed and even con fused, dissatisfied, perhaps irritated ; and the need to compose our mind, to look at our conception of the world and to see what has happened to it, is both urgent and reasonable. The urgency is felt directly and cannot be argued against. That it is reasonable may seem to require some sort of justification. I take it that it is because it is urgent and because its urgency expresses a basic human need which shares generic traits with the need towards integration that we see operative in philosophy, in science, and in practical life. There will, of course, be men who will read Journey with absorbing attention and who, reach ing the last line, will go about their business undisturbed. But to take this kind of men as exemplars of the ideal reader does</page><page sequence="17">el?seo vivas 577 not seem reasonable. If, then, the normal reader feels the need to undertake the critical task, the question now confronts us as aestheticians as to whether aesthetics has been justified in dis missing the theory of imitation as it has done. IV How do we go about the task of criticism? Here we can only consider its most superficial traits. Having read the novel in transitively, we can ask what the presuppositions are which must be posited as required to bring about and to sustain in the aesthetic transaction the work we have read. Let me dwell for a moment on the term that I have just introduced. It is not a felicitous term, but it will do. The term "presuppositions" is intended to cover all the factors, both of a purely aesthetic na ture and others, which control the selection of subject matter and the elaboration which the artist gives to it in order to in form it into the substance of his work. Since most of the activity takes place beyond the reach of observation, we are almost en tirely in the dark as to how it happens. But in spite of our ignorance, it is possible to assert with a modicum of confidence that the process is not one which is guided exclusively by purely aesthetic considerations. The artist's total personality, including the whole complex of his espoused and his recognized values? and this constitutes a major part of himself?is involved in the choice.8 In making this assertion I am not moralizing the pro cess of artistic creation. What is usually called morality be comes operative when we have to resolve practical perplexities as regards which we notice differences of value. Note also that although what I mean by the term "presuppositions" covers all the operative principles controlling the selections, whether aes thetic, intellectual, moral, or religious, which make the work of 8If the terms "espoused" and "recognized" are not self-explanatory, an account of how they are intended will be found in the writer's The Moral Life and the Ethical Life (Chicago, 1950), pp. 71, 190, 217. 2</page><page sequence="18">578 literature and knowledge literature possible, what we are interested in here almost ex clusively are the presuppositions that control the selection of the subject matter of the work. In actual practice the critic will meet with varying degrees of success when he seeks in the finished object for its presupposi tions. And in his search it will be easy for him to fall into a trap, because the tendency?particularly in an age debauched by the facile techniques of parlor psychoanalysis?is to abandon the objective search and to enter into a search for the subjective intentions that guided the writer in the completion of his work. About these subjective motivations we seldom know enough, but what we know is sufficient to assert that they need not be identi cal with the actual operative principles that control the pro duction of the work. The principles to which I refer, the pre suppositions of the work, are inferred from the work itself. The reason for this is obvious: Consciousness proposes and the id disposes. I cannot enter into the details of the process by which I ar rived at the results I am about to state as regards Journey} but it is hardly necessary to do so, since one of the reasons for choosing it was that I could not think of a serious novel that presents so easy a critical task as it does. Should there be dis agreement about my results, it is not necessary to resolve it, since the analysis is not given here for its own sake, but solely for the sake of the illustration that it furnishes. Succinctly stated, Journey was made possible by a systematic selection of subject matter such that nothing in it contradicts the hatred that constitutes one of the informing factors of the novel. The actual journeys of the narrator-hero and the moral voyage of discovery which constitutes his quest run parallel and both finally take him to the end of the night, not to the dawn of the new day. No subject matter is accepted for information into the substance of the book whose affective tone can be character ized by words like "love," in any but its most animal sense,</page><page sequence="19">EL?SEO VIVAS 579 "joy," "gratitude," "piety." When pitiful incidents are intro duced, what is contemptible or weak or mean in them is brought forward. Virtues are shown up as fronts for self-interest and malice, and only one of the minor characters of the novel, the whore in Detroit, is capable of decency. The dominant attitude of the narrator-hero is fully explicit; to cite only one of the innumerable examples that could be given, he tells us, "One human being can only tolerate another human being and rather like him, if he plays the part of an admiring doormat." But it is not merely Ferdinand who is instinct with impotent hatred and resentment. The world must also be, if it is to justify Ferdinand's attitude. The novel is thoroughly consistent, and its contrivance gives evidence of superb creative power. To enter its world is to have an immediate fictional experience of a world created by a paranoid at an advanced stage in the development of his psychosis. But only a magnificently gifted paranoid, of course, can create the world in which Ferdinand lives. From what I have said, it follows that although the aesthetic object appears in the aesthetic transaction as involving unique ness and as being self-sufficient, its uniqueness and self-sufficiency are not absolute, for the object is dependent on the presupposi tions that make it possible, and not all of these are purely aesthetic. If, then, the self-sufficiency of a work of literature in the intransitive experience gives it a sort of congressional immunity from moral and cognitive jurisdiction, it does so only within the transaction. Outside it, it is open to criticism. The work is open to criticism not only in the obvious sense that we must consider the practical effects that it has on us, but also in the sense that we must criticize the presuppositions that make it possible in moral and cognitive terms. The criticism to which Journey is open, succinctly stated, is that the presuppositions that control it are perverse and have produced a work which, while perhaps not open to serious criticism from a purely aes thetic standpoint, is open to condemnation because the subject</page><page sequence="20">580 LITERATURE AND KNOWLEDGE matter it has organized into its informed substance has been se lected by a perverted mind and is valid only for that type of mind. But why is this objectionable? This question can be answered both at the aesthetic level and at the non-aesthetic. A complete answer must include, of course, both, with a clear exhibition of the intimate way in which each answer affects the answer we give the other. Aesthetically it would have to be shown that in the case of Journey the intransitivity of the transaction is blocked by the informed substance of the novel. While it would be a relatively easy task, and a radically important one, to demon strate this fact, wTe must ignore it, in order to turn to the second and give reasons why the perverse informed substance of the novel is objectionable. However, I shall not attempt to answer this question as stated. Instead, I shall consider the broader problem, what is it that the artist does to his subject matter when he creates a work of literature and how does the created work function in human experience? If this can be made clear, any one ought to be able to see for himself why perversity must be objected to in a work of art. V One thing we know about the artist, and that is that he has a passion for order, in response to which he shapes or informs experiential subject matter into a self-sufficient and relatively novel object. The subject matter of his work lies heaped pell mell in his mind as it is dumped in it by the accidents of ex perience, and he has what almost amounts to a compulsion to inform it. The "Prefaces" of the New York Edition and The Note Books of Henry James, to cite familiar examples, are full of instances of the way in which a chance suggestion germinates in the writer's mind, grows, and forces him, so to speak, to master it by ordering it into a work of art. It is the recognition</page><page sequence="21">el?seo vivas 581 of this primary need that gives formalist aesthetics its unde featable strength; but the process involves more than struggle to achieve order, and this the formalist misses. However, the act of creation does not take place if it does not seek order, which is achieved when an object is constructed which can be apprehended intransitively as self-sufficient in the aesthetic transaction. This process I call "the organization of the primary subject matter of experience." By the phrase, "the organization of the primary subject mat ter (or the data) of experience," I would refer to the fact that the writer organizes into a literary work the subject matter or data gathered by him in his practical living. What experience presents him with is a mass of stuff which is usually too dis orderly for his mind to be able to comprehend. I am not re ferring to the "data" of experience of the epistemologist, which is the stuff of experience analyzed down to its elemental com ponents. I mean the stuff of life as lived, as it comes to the artist in its own terms, in its presentational or dramatic con creteness, with its dynamism and fuzziness, involving action and passion, value freighted, and already exhibiting a discernible modicum of order. The writer eats, loves, hates; he plays and works and quarrels. He is a father and a citizen. He may have a more or less articulate abstract theory about the life of man. He is curious about men and the way they go about their busi ness. His whole life is a constant gathering of stuff which he later uses as subject matter for his art. When we consider the relation of the artist's life to his work it appears that no simple theory will account for the resources that he brings to the cre ative act. Yet in spite of the bewildering variety of types which we find among writers, this we can say, that if a man is an artist the subject matter that he brings to the creative act is made up, for the most part, not of a heap of abstract formula, but of concrete presentational or dramatic subject matter. I call it "dramatic" in order to emphasize the fact that it consists</page><page sequence="22">582 LITERATURE AND KNOWLEDGE of the actions and passions of men and is not an articulated system of abstractions such as we may find in even the most concrete descriptions of the anthropologist or the social scientist. In this sense, the subject matter of the writer is dramatic even if it consists of mere yearning and not of action. And it is con crete, even if the writer is concerned with the moral structure of experience or with the metaphysical values which sustain human existence. In this connection the first chapter of Ber diaev's study of Dostoevski makes rewarding reading, for in it is suggested the manner in which the great Russian novelist fused "ideas" and used them along with the actions and pas sions of men, as constitutents of his novels. We must not forget, however, that the subject matter out of which he makes his art he also gathers from art itself. His love of art is something that occupies a unique place in his scale of espoused values. Malraux tells us that "every artist's career begins with the pastiche." This is true. But it is not the whole truth. For to the love of art we must add a selective yet vo racious hunger for certain aspects of the primary data of ex perience. It is well known that Henry James was as finicky, when he listened to a story, as a spoilt child before his food tray. The dinner companion who told him, for instance, the story that led to The Spoils of Poyntony told him more than he needed to hear. "Life being all inclusion and confusion, and art being all discrimination and selection," the writer has to know when to close his mind's ear to the person who is giving him more than he cares to take. But for all his choosiness, James nevertheless pounced on the morsel he selected from the offered tray with the wolfish relish of a starved man. The data that the artist picks?James's "germs"?are not, as he stumbles upon them, in a state of absolute chaos. The artist is not a Hebrew God; he does not find, as Jahveh did, that his subject matter is utterly without form, and void, and that darkness is upon its face. I take it that there is no need to dwell on the</page><page sequence="23">el?seo vivas 583 fact that the artist, as artist, is not interested in organizing the actual data of experience but in its symbolic elaboration?he is not a Solon, intent on rearing a state; he is a fictioner working with symbols. Note that the organization to which I refer is not that of which Richards spoke. What I have in mind is the symbolic organization of the primary data of experience achieved by the artist in the literary work. For its proper aesthetic perception, it is to be found in the object, whatever philosophy may decide about its real locus later on. The organization is achieved with reference to principles of order which it is the business of cri ticism to discover. In our novel the formal unity of the tale is achieved by the participation of the narrator-hero in the epi sodes he tells about. Through the variety of his experience the hero first discovers and then confirms what he gradually learns about the evil nature of the world. Thus the presuppositions that control the selection of the subject matter of the novel are in "harmony," as critics say, with those which selected the form in which the subject matter was informed. VI It is the fact that the artist orders and defines the elements of primary experience that gives Bergson's theory of art the irrefragable content of truth it has. Bergson lays it down that art reveals the reality of things. He is working with a con trast between the practical grasp of things and this other grasp, the aesthetic, which tears the veil behind which things hide from our urgency and resolution. We need not accept the theoretical wrappings in order to discover a valid truth in this claim. There is no question here of a reality superior to the reality to which the physicist's formulas refer. There is a superior reality sym bolized in the work of art?but it is superior, not to the reality of the world of physics, but to the alleged reality of our physical</page><page sequence="24">584 LITERATURE AND KNOWLEDGE world, that is, of the clich?-cluttered, hastily grasped, by-pas sion-blurred world in which we daily live. It is the reality of this world that the artist seeks, through his activity, which we now have to call, not an act of creation, but of discovery. The resolution of this apparent contradiction I must postpone for a while. Here I would indicate that Bergson is right when he argues that practical perception has no need to discriminate the full presentational, concrete-structured reality of what it seeks to grasp only to use. But that only the gaze of the artist des cries the real seems to me to be an unwarranted assertion. The physicist also reveals a deep-seated reality, namely the mathe matical structure of nature, which is an aspect of the complex structure of reality, and one in which the artist is only super ficially interested, just as the physicist is not interested in the deep-seated reality which the artist reveals. Since this assertion may seem to blur the distinction between art and science it is necessary to draw it explicitly. For all prac tical purposes, we can distinguish between art and science in terms of the subject matter and of the levels of abstraction in which physicist and artist are respectively interested as well as of the purposes they seek to realize. But this is not where the radical seat of the distinction lies, for only arbitrarily can we declare that a man cannot look intransitively upon the physical reality to which his formula points or the interrelated pattern of implicative relations which constitutes a mathematical demon stration. When I remember my old chemistry teacher I must maintain that a laboratory experiment, even reeking of hydrogen sulphide, can to some men be a thing of beauty, just as a clean job of decapitation must have seemed a thing of beauty to so accomplished a craftsman as the late M. de Paris. Where, then, does the distinction radically lie? Not in the substance appre hended, but in the manner and in the purpose for which it is apprehended. And this is the reason why it is so difficult actually to separate and even to distinguish the cognitive from the aes</page><page sequence="25">el?seo vivas 585 thetic mode of experience. As contrasted with the religious and the moral, the cognitive and the aesthetic modes share in the fact that the direction of attention is not reflective but outwards on an object (even if it be the self) with which the attending self is not identified during the act of cognition or of aesthetic apprehension. This is the truth of Kant's famous disinterested interest, but it ought to be noted that it holds for the object of knowledge as well as for the object of aesthetic apprehension. There is a distinction, however, between the aesthetic and the cognitive modes of experience, since the knower does not center his attention intransitively on a self-sufficient object, but on re lations, implicative or causal, that branch out indefinitely from it backwards and forwards, towards the hypothesis his inquiry confirms or towards the consequences and the new problems it opens up. And this is true of the mathematician who, having enjoyed the elegant self-sufficiency of a demonstration, soon takes up from where he left off merely to gaze on the beauty of the relations he has disclosed, and seeks new relations sug gested by those already explored. The artist presents an object for contemplation which during the act of contemplation elicits rapt attention, sustains it, and feeds it intransitively. Spinoza, fascinated by a spider capturing a fly?was he a naturalist or an amateur of the drama? The answer depends on what went on in his mind as he looked. The artist orders experience at what we usually call the com monsense level, but what I prefer to call the dramatic level. This is the level at which we all live when we return from the cells where we carry on our specialized professional activities. It is a world which does not seem ever to succeed in assimilating in an operative manner the viable knowledge which at any stage in the development of a civilization the creative mind in science or philosophy, in morality and in religion, puts at its disposal. It is the world in which men actually live whether they are civil ized technosophists or preliterate Australian aborigines. This</page><page sequence="26">586 LITERATURE AND KNOWLEDGE world derives the order which it possesses inherently from many sources, but, back of all of them, finally from the creative activity of men who rear institutions and discover values and establish a hierarchy among them and create "myths" which are expressive of the relations that they discern to obtain among themselves and between themselves and the universe. To claim that it is the artist that brings about this order would be to turn him into a statesman, prophet, theologian, scientist, and engineer all in one. But the order the world inherently has is never satisfactory, since it is always threatened by chaos and is at best ?whether we are speaking of the sociological or the cosmologi cal dimension?a generic order, structured in institutions and conceptions which must serve the members of a society in differently in their several roles and statuses. Nor is it easy to grasp, for all the seeming familiarity with it that members of a society seem to possess. Particularly in historically dynamic, complex societies, it requires constant redefinition in concrete viable terms. To discover in its specificity the nature and struc ture of experience as lived, and to present it in terms that men can grasp, is the creative task of the artist. And it is an essen tial task. He is engaged in giving us a refurbished picture of our world in concrete terms. He teaches us to discern what we in our purblindness cannot see for ourselves; he tells us what is the dramatic pattern of human life and thus defines for us its sense. It is this fact, as has often been noticed, that gives Oscar Wilde's shopworn epigram its validity; for life imitates art in the sense that we discover in it what the artist through his work tells us is there. For this reason, without his aid our com prehension of our culture coarsens, we get confused, our sensi bilities harden; and because, as a result, our imaginative grasp falters, our daily living insensibly relapses to the level of in stinct, automatism and animal brutality. In one of Van Wyck Brooks's earliest essays, "America's Coming-of-Age," referring to Whitman, he speaks of the function of the poet in the most</page><page sequence="27">el?seo vivas 587 radical and primitive sense of the word, as a man who first gives to a nation a certain focal center in the consciousness of its own character. To do this is to exhibit to a people in dramatic terms the structure of its life and the order of rank of its values. This is what the literary artist does in the degree to which he is creative. He presents us with a symbolic fiction of a world charged with value; he defines that value in dramatic terms within the grasp of men; he shows the hierarchy that structures it; and he thus gives us the means to give vivid individual con tent to the generalizations on which we fall when we take stock of our experience. Thus the reader of Journey comes face to face with a symbolic world which reveals precisely what quality life can have when men are as here depicted. And it is a sad comment on the quality of our life that many prominent critics saw our world faithfully reflected in Journey. Hatred, dis trust, malice, selfishness, and murder never rise to grandeur in Journey as they do in Macbeth or Othello. Journey gives us a world in which no defeat of heroic proportions is possible. Neither audacity nor love nor malice are creative of epic des truction; they are impotent. Resentment and self-hatred trims all size to its own scale, and perceives nothing but what is emo tionally and morally congruous with it. VII But how shall we resolve the contradiction involved in the claim that the artist creates novel objects and that he discovers the hidden reality of our practical, commonsense world? The contradiction is only apparent, not real, since the two assertions were made from different points of view. From an external point of view, there is novelty in his product and spontaneity is involved in the process. From the standpoint of the artist, however, we grasp a different aspect of the creative process, since what the artist does is not to invent something new but to extri</page><page sequence="28">588 LITERATURE AND KNOWLEDGE cate out of the subject matter at hand its own proper structure or order. If this is what the theory of imitation intends?and there are some passages in the Poetics which, with the usual tucking and pulling that constitute the art of learned exegesis, could be used to justify this interpretation?it is a valid theory, and in this respect at least is not necessarily in conflict with ex pression theories that emphasize the novelty or uniqueness of the work of art. If this is true, McKeon's statement in the article referred to above is justified when he tells us that "it is possible for the doctrine of imitation to persist in all essen tials even when the term has disappeared." What the artist does, as we have already seen, is to wrench from his subject matter something that is not fully realized in it, or that, life being the bungling thing it is, is realized in a different manner than it would be if it were designed to meet the demands of aesthetic order exclusively. In talking of the creative activity, above, we emphasized the fact that he did the wrenching. Now we must emphasize that he wrenches something. The artist creates then, in the sense that he makes a dramatic structure out of subject matter in which the ordinary ungifted mind would not think of looking for it. But the structure is no more in vented by him than it is by the physicist when the latter dis covers the laws of the physical world and expresses them in the tools he has at hand. The writer discovers this structure, in the sense that the forms and the substance of his work are found by him in the data of experience which is the subject matter of his art. In James' Notebooks we find numerous ex amples of the way in which a story takes the bit in its mouth in spite of the writer's editorial commitments as to length and general development, and in spite of the intentions that he formulated as he began to explore the possibilities involved in the initial "germ" from which his creative activity took off. In successive entries we see James gradually discovering the story, and we are able to follow the way in which, as it reveals itself</page><page sequence="29">el?seo vivas 589 to him, it forces him to alter his plans. In view of these facts^ an author's relation to his theme is poorly described as an effort to say what he wants. We come closer to the facts if we speak of it as an effort to tease out the potentialities of the story, an effort to discover how to do them justice, by so treating them as to meet their objective requiredness. The writer who says what he wants, or what the editor, or the Commissar in charge of artistic production, wants him to say is not an artist, however useful his product may be for political or for moral reasons. This is what critics mean when they speak of the "sincerity" of the writer. It is very easy for the writer to push his subject matter around with the bulldozer of a lucid will, so as to come out where he wants to come out and not where the story wants to come out. This is the reason why there is such a profound truth in the Platonic myth of poetic inspiration. What the writer does is to accept or to reject what is offered to his con sciousness from the depths of his mind. His responsibility as artist is to decide whether what is offered to him now belongs with what he has already accepted or has a greater right to sur vive than what he has already put down on paper. This is a great responsibility, and calls for acuity of superior power; but it is one which is controlled by his ability to discern the re quiredness of the potentialities of the object as this gradually reveals itself to him, and not by what he wants. When we, as readers, look upon the object that the artist has made, we find it to be a symbol embodying the order towards which, in terms of presuppositions we seldom do more than sense in a confused way, the subject matter of experience tends. True that the con structions of the writer are those of a unique man at a given time working within a given artistic tradition in a specific cul ture at a specific stage in its history; nor can they be redupli cated by anyone else nor can they be confirmed in any sense in which the scientist confirms his hypotheses. But to the extent to which the literary object approaches perfection, the order</page><page sequence="30">590 LITERATURE AND KNOWLEDGE which informs it is not arbitrary, since it is inherent in it. It is to the extent that it is able to exhibit order that is inherent in it that it is able to become a public object. There is a kind of congruence, or pre-established harmony, between the work of literature and actual life. But it is not one in which literature imitates life. Rather the relation is, so to speak, "normative," in the sense that it tells us, not what actual life is like, but what it would be like if it had the wisdom or the good fortune to possess the economical interrelatedness that art possesses for attention. What literature, therefore, gives us is a symbolic construct of what life ought to be like in order to answer the demands of aesthetic apprehension of it. What it gives us we can, if we desire, call "knowledge" in an extended and vague sense of the word, since it is a product of the mind and it is an object of perception, and since it has undeniable similarities with the symbolic constructions which we call knowledge in the narrow sense. But while we cannot deny anyone the right to use words as he chooses, we have a right to demand that his use does not confuse him and mislead us. VIII It is desirable to emphasize the fact that the "ought" of which I have been speaking is neither a cognitive, religious, nor moral, but a purely aesthetic "ought." The aesthetic ought is satisfied when the analytically discernible components of the object are so related as to elicit and sustain intransitive attention on the object. To speak of the organization which elicits such a response as a "logical affair," as is done by James K. Feibleman, is mis leading, since no one has discovered the implicative relations which allow the innumerable components of a work of literature to go together in order to constitute an object so organized as to elicit and sustain intransitive attention. And it is at least as misleading to argue that the work of literature ought to be</page><page sequence="31">el?seo vivas 591 plausible in the sense that it must be satisfying in the light of the reader's inductive knowledge about the world. Non-aes thetic demands, cognitive, moral or religious, intrude on the aesthetic experience when for any reason the aesthetic object fails to capture attention in an intransitive manner, or when for abnormal reasons we fail to yield attention to it. To argue that literature refers to the world because it must be plausible is to deny to the creative artist his autonomy and to the object created its self-sufficiency. Thus our knowledge of the world tells us that men do not change in their sleep into "monstrous beetles." But the writer of Metamorphosis transports us with out effort, it would seem, into a world of his own creation, by devices which the acuity of a good critic can disclose, although seldom exhaustively, and the purpose of which is to exclude from our conscious response our non-aesthetic demands in such a way that they do not become the basis of a criticism of his symbolic construction. Man, among the other things which make him unique, is a culture building animal. And he has never been known to create a culture which did not include a more or less well de fined hierarchy of values: dramatic conceptions about himself and about the nature on which he depends to survive, and animistic conceptions of the forces which define and control his destiny. These, the girders of culture, are seldom formulated by him in the abstract way in which theologians, philosophers and scientists discuss them. They are expressed in mythopoetic terms, essentially dramatic and anthropomorphic. And they are created or discovered?depending on our point of view?by the artist at a given juncture in history, in terms of the factors of a culture which, when he starts his work, is already a going affair, but which would not survive for long if it did not have the benefit of his renovating ministrations. In the narrow sense of the word, literature does not give us knowledge, since it does not give us a picture of which we may demand correspondence</page><page sequence="32">592 LITERATURE AND KNOWLEDGE with the actual world as we actually grasp it. It gives us an aesthetically ordered picture. But life seldom achieves the order that a work of literature possesses; and when it does, it does so only by happy accident. But if literature does not give us knowledge, it ought to be recognized that it is prior in the order of logic to all knowledge, since it is constitutive of culture, which is one of the conditions of knowledge.</page></plain_text>
