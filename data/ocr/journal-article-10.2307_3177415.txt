<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beyond Suzhou: Region and Memory in the Gardens of Sichuan Jerome Silbergeld The title of Maggie Keswick's book The Chinese Garden, which has served as American readers' most popular introduction to this topic since 1978, provides both a label and a limit for the study of Chinese gardens.' Put in the singular, it suggests an isolated species so self-contained, so coherent and distinct from other varieties, that little or no internal differentiation need be discerned by the armchair audience.2 The title of Osvald Siren's earlier classic on the subject (1949), which Keswick's book supplanted, suggested otherwise: Gardens of China. Yet Siren's first chapter, entitled "The Chinese Gar- den-A Work of Art in Forms of Nature," brings us right back to the point, as does the very first sentence of his text, which begins, "The Chinese garden, considered as a special type of landscape gardening..."3 To give them their due, these books and various others of their class do differentiate, and they recognize not just one type of garden but two: imperial gardens and scholars' gardens. This duality is based not so much on historical evolution or geographic diversity as it is on royal versus private patronage and the predictable differ- ential in physical scale and degree of visual grandeur-in other words, a sumptuary distinction.4 Only coincidentally do two different regions tend to provide the essential examples of these two different types: in the north, capital sites along the Wei and Yellow River valleys, Xi'an and Luoyang, origi- nally offered up the grand imperial style, now hard to recon- struct, while Beijing and the Manchu summer palaces at Chengde today supply the only actual surviving examples; in the south, the Yangzi River delta towns give us the smaller, more austere private gardens, ranging from Yangzhou to Hangzhou, with Suzhou at their center. Siren wrote in his preface, "The present work is not the result of any systematic preliminary studies, it has not been prompted by the ambi- tion of scientific research, but is simply a resume of memories I have preserved from former years of wandering abroad, of impressions I received in the course of rambles in Peking parks and the gardens of Suzhou."5 Later writers have been scarcely less circumscribed in their wanderings, and this in- cludes Chinese writers as well. As demonstrated by the map from Peng Yigang's excellent Zhongguo gudian yuanlin fensi [Analysis of the traditional Chinese garden] (Fig. 1), the author has made his way south to a few of the gardens in the Guangzhou area, but vast areas of China remain unexplored by him and by others.6 There's a hole where Sichuan ought to be in this map of our architectural knowledge, so it is a map of our present ignorance as well. It is also a reminder of the historical isolation of this huge province: traditionally, larger in area and population than any European country, it is walled off from the rest of China in all directions by impassable moun- tains, like a huge Switzerland, and distinct in its own history and regional customs.7 Sichuan's landlocked isolation has been famously described by the mid-eighth-century poet Li Bo (Li Bai), who wrote, "It would be easier to climb to Heaven than to walk the Sichuan Road, / And those who hear the tale of it turn pale with fear."8 Readily accessible only through the treacherous Yangzi River gorges,9 Sichuan was the nearly impregnable stronghold to which the Chinese government retreated for safety during its twentieth-century war with Japan. In earlier centuries, Sichuan became inde- pendent of the rest of China during nearly every major national upheaval, including the third, the tenth, the thir- teenth, and the seventeenth centuries.10 In each of these periods, as China experienced decline, Sichuan flourished, benefiting from all those who fled the turmoil of the national capital and other cultural centers and filled Sichuan's cities with refugee artists and poets."l Its cultural history resembles a light flickering on and off, sparkling when the rest of China goes dark and dimming while the rest of China glows. Si- chuan (or Shu) has been described as a kingdom within a kingdom, and the Chinese have an expression about its his- torical cycle of dynastic rise and fall: "When the nation has not yet rebelled, Sichuan has already begun to rebel; when the nation is back at peace, Sichuan is the last to be pacified [Tianxia wei luan, Shu xian luan; Tianxia yi zhi, Shu hou zhi]." The Chinese also have a familiar term for what we would call a hick or a country bumpkin, and that is a xiali Ba ren, literally, a "villager from Ba," or eastern Sichuan. This sug- gests how remote and provincial Sichuan might seem to the rest of China, its local customs poorly understood and its history poorly recorded, so "quaint" that until a couple of years ago its famous river gorges appeared on a low-denom- ination bill with a Tibetan woman and Moslem man on the reverse (Fig. 2). Yet Sichuan is scarcely a cultural backwater. The poets who came from or dwelt for periods of time in Sichuan illuminate-even dominate-China's literary hall of fame, including Sima Xiangru (179-117 B.C.E.), Yang Xiong (53 B.C.E.-18 C.E.), Chen Zi'ang (661-702), Li Bo (701-762), Du Fu (712-770), Yuan Zhen (779-831), Su Shi (1037- 1101), and Lu You (1125-1210). As for its architecture, at first glance, it appears strikingly different from everything one is taught about traditional styles and techniques-iso- lated Sichuan preserving in its architecture some strange jewel, as exotic to the traveler from another province as it is to the foreigner already acclimated to China. Yet nationalist pride after 1949 displaced regional awareness, and only with its gradual revival since Mao Zedong's death in 1976 have conditions become ripe for Sichuan locals once again to appreciate their distinctive cultural heritage and for a hand- ful of specialists to begin developing a crude index of Si- chuan's early surviving architecture. Before defining and interpreting a distinctive "Sichuan style" (or what later will more accurately be refined into a "Chengdu style"), something should first be said of the other styles that are already well understood.

As microcosms now be- lieved to have been constructed in order to legitimize the authority of their royal owners, these vast parks arose even before the first emperor sat on the throne of a unified China in the late third century B.c.E.12 From early literature like Sima Xiangru's famous "Zi xu," or "Sir Fantasy," we can guess that the various regional rulers of early China competed almost as much through the magnificence of their parks and their palaces as they did on the field of battle, confident perhaps that success in the architectural realm would assure _K,C ~ c, f 13f 1 Map of China showing areas where garden research has been undertaken *:"-'. j* .4 (from Peng Yigang, Zhongguo gudian * Gc.

The design of those gardens gave later poets ample fuel for verbal extravagance; the three voices in Sima Xiangru's poem, knights from three different parts of China (including Chu, just to the east of what is now Sichuan), went on and on about their respective lords' royal parks, each proclaiming theirs the grandest, like three drunken braggarts on their barstools.'3 What we know of royal parks in the most recent thousand years suggests that they pale in comparison with those earlier prototypes. The factors that led to this decline would not have been singular, but the rise of private gardens must have helped to strip the royal parks of their unique aura. We should also imagine, I think, that the rise of private gardens was met with efforts by China's rulers to maintain their architectural exclusivity, but as the royal prerogative became increasingly less enforceable, BB ""e *S L</page><page sequence="3">REGION AND MEMORY IN TIIE GARDENS OF SICI-UAN 209 3 Copy after Wang Wei (699-759), Wang River Villa, section of a handscroll, ink and colors on silk, Ming dynasty. Seattle Art Museum (from Harry Trubner et al., Asiatic Art in the Seattle Art Museum [Seattle: Seattle Art Museum, 1973], no. 154) sumptuary laws were negotiated to minimize the rate and scale of encroachment. The earliest private "garden" sites, it is thought, were found rather than built, exemplified by the Bamboo Grove of Nan- jing's famous "Seven Sages" (a group of celebrated individu- alists from the third century C.E.), or at least relatively simple, like Wang Xizhi's (303-361) waterside Orchid Pavilion (Lan- ting) on the slopes of Mt. Lanzhu in Kuaiji Prefecture (near modern-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province) and Tao Yuan- ming's (365-427) humble eastern fence, five willows, and chrysanthemum beds planted by his own hand somewhere in the shadow of Mt. Lu.14 It did not take long for the private garden to evolve from such humble means into privately owned estates like Wang Wei's (699-759), which sprawled along the banks of the Wang River south of Xi'an, with rambling villas and thatched halls, a deer park, and even the site of an ancient temple ruin (Fig. 3).1 Recorded for pos- terity in his own painting and poetry, and perhaps the most famous garden of all time, Wang Wei's Wang River Villa dates to the 730s and 740s, and by then private gardens ran both large and small. Regardless of scale, they often shared a structural concept developed along the lines of emerging fengshui ideals like those that YangYunsong (ca. 840-ca. 888) formalized soon afterward. This employed a classic pattern of mountains to the rear (meaning the north), water flowing southward through the property and pooling in the front, and buildings well protected within a so-called dragon's lair, making pooled waters central to the design and proximate to the inhabitants, while mountains were peripheral to the do- main, with architecture opening outward to receive them as "borrowed scenery." Such pond-centered, outward-looking gardens typified a high Tang style found not just in private Chinese gardens but also in palace architecture and Buddhist temples, in China, Korea, and Japan, like the Hosshoji in Kyoto, built on a grand scale by the Heian-period emperor Shirakawa from 1077 onward (Fig. 4). Here, a low-lying grassy island set within the lake symbolized a world-mountain and served as a sacred precinct on which was set a Chinese-styled eight-sided, nine-story pagoda, drawing the focus of the other buildings away from them and their courtyard interiors.16 The secular, aristocratic gardens of the late Heian and Ka- makura periods known to us through surviving screen paint- ings, such as the Jing6ji's Senzui bybbu (Landscape folding screen), retained much of this open, pond-oriented layout even as the buildings themselves were being converted to accommodate native Japanese structural traditions.17 The next step historically, which generated the private garden as we know it in later times in Suzhou, gradually shifted the balance toward prioritizing mountains over water, yang over yin, or at least toward equalizing the two, by figu- ratively transporting the mountains into and distributing them throughout the garden and representing them not by islands within water but by large chunks of rugged rock. Royal parks led the way, and in no royal park was this more elabo- rately carried out than in that of the early-twelfth-century emperor Huizong (Zhao Ji, 1082-1135, r. 1101-26), the Genyue (Gen Mountain) Garden in Bianliang (modern Kaifeng). Motivated by the pronouncement of the royal fang- shi (soothsayer) at the outset of Huizong's reign that for him to breed male heirs, which he then lacked, he needed to supply gen-indicated by the seventh of the Book of Divina- tion's (the Yijing) eight trigrams, literally, a yangline over two yin lines, reduplicated, and the fifty-second of the book's sixty-four hexagrams, standing for mountain and stability-in the form of more rockery in the northeastern part of the capital city.18 Huizong went to work massively importing rocks from the south of China and became infatuated with the kind of rocks found in the acid waters of Lake Tai near Suzhou. With the help of flotillas that plied the Grand Canal ferrying mountains of rock, his enterprise became known from 1105 on as the Flower and Rock Network. This was described shortly afterward by Zhang.Hao (ca. 1180-1250), who wrote, without much exaggeration:</page><page sequence="4">210 ART BUI,I,ITIN JUNE 2004 VOLUME LXXXVI NUMBER 2 I I 4 Hossh6ji, Kyoto, reconstructed ground plan, ca. 1083 (from Bunji Kobayashi, Japanese Architecture, pl. 45) The expenses involved... are easily reckoned to be al- most infinite in number. Common people were dis- patched to search around cliffs and sift through swamps. Shrouded and secret locales were not disregarded. ... Mountains were hacked to pieces and rocks were carted away.... every possible scheme was used in order to get the rocks out and to their destination.... The boats continued, one after the other, day and night, without a break.... Still, they did not supply enough.19 Quite literally, Huizong broke the royal bank with these enterprises and got into such political trouble for it that neither he nor his dynasty could get out of it again. One might think that the collapse of the Northern Song dynasty in 1126-27-with the sack of the capital city byJurched Tartars, the capture of Huizong and the Song royal family, and the flight of a rump court south to Hangzhou-might forever have given intensive gardening a bad name in China, but the continued evolution of garden style toward petromania went on unabated. It is not, however, in the increasingly conserva- tive traditions of palace gardens that this development cul- minates but rather in private scholars' gardens. From the fourteenth century on, one increasingly finds the visual celebration of rockery, of yang, wherever one turns to gaze on the garden. Some paintings rendered the gathered stones of scholars' gardens with mineral pigments, as in the handscroll attributed to Xie Huan (act. 1426-52) depicting a historically famous ninth-century gathering but in a garden design that one might guess was brought thoroughly up-to- date (Fig. 5). Such gatherings are also a reminder that the garden-based studio was the site where a substantial portion of the Chinese scholars' paintings, calligraphies, poems, mu- sical compositions, and philosophical essays were produced over the centuries, inspired by the garden's aesthetics and energized by the gathered yang and yin forces placed at the disposal of the painter-writer-musician. Paths of stone lead in and around exotic rockery gathered from Lake Tai, erected in the garden as miniature mountains, simulacra of the real thing. Inside the studio, where the scholar executes a poem or a painting-perhaps a painting-within-a-painting or a poem descriptive of this very garden-we also see the minia- ture mountains further miniaturized into the form of a small desk-top stone. Increasingly valuable in their own day as collectible items,20 we might regard such stones today as an early form of "found art" but for the fact, frequently over- looked, that they were often very carefully worked by artisans whose intent was to thoroughly disguise their unnatural ef- forts.

All these stones-taihu from Suzhou, lingbi from Anhui, yingstones from Guangdong, and so forth-allowed painters to model their landscapes without having to leave their studios at all.21 Sliced marble from Dali in deep southern Yunnan Province produced an accidental landscape once every hundred slices or so, more valued the closer they came to styles of landscape actually practiced by painters. These were set into furniture or displayed on the walls (Figs. 7, 8). Lovely examples were framed and hung, like minimalist paintings. Outside the studio, terraces of inset stones, selected for common size, color, and shape, dazzled and directed the eye. Bridges of stone, elevated, imitate the bridges leading to heaven and immortality-or imitated the paintings of such bridges. A hierarchy of stone types was established; a terrace could be built up of lesser quality yellow stone (huang shi), with flanking stones made of so-called bamboo shoot rockery guarding a central stone from Lake Tai, very much like a Buddhist temple altar with guardian deities flanking a central icon (Figs. 9, 10). The analogy was undoubtedly intentional and the veneration of great rocks very real; their power-male, yang, phallocentric-was no less potent than that of anthropomorphic icons, and no less genuine than their own aesthetic impact. 6 Snow on Mount Yi, white marble scholar's rock, Qing dynasty.

The spatial organization dizzied the eye, engaged the senses, and involved the mind, like the multidimensional, multimedia display of a great Baroque cathedral-this in contrast to the Renaissance-like clarity set forth in earlier, simpler pre-Song gardens. 9 Liu Garden, Suzhou, rocks in the design of a temple altar</page><page sequence="7">REGION AND MEMORY IN THE GARDENS OF SIICHUAN 213 10 Toshodaiji, Kondo (Golden Hall), Nara, main altar, ca. 759 (from Minoru Ooka, Temples of Japan and Their Art [New York: Weatherhill / Heibonsha, 1973], pl. 43) '2' ';i&lt;8-.1"s f - ,/ ' -- - T 11 ' 9) 0 0 0 -' 0 o o c 0 0 oo s 0 0 o O -., 'o o o o 0 0 .

For example: a pavilion conventionally belongs in the rustic outer reaches of the garden, disclosing the semihidden pathways and pro- viding the tourist a prime view back toward the center of the garden. But in Suzhou's Garden of the Master of Fishing Nets, a pavilion is hauled back into the courtyard itself, cut in half, and plastered up against a wall; the viewer, who expects a pavilion to facilitate a gaze down on the garden rockery, is here dislodged, and the rockery is put in the viewer's place, like an icon in a temple, requiring his obeisance.22 The gardens of Suzhou are full of such architect-generated sur- prises, more often than not played on the theme of rockery.23 Figuring out how quickly these developments occurred and how to date architectural or other events within a gar- den's continuing evolution is no easy matter, presenting the historian a series of conundrums. Chinese buildings are made of wooden modules that are replaced part by part as necessity dictates.24 After a period of time, a building is not all of one age but a bionic composite of different eras, as are the rockery, the water features, the flora, and the architecture of a garden. Dated paintings portraying named, surviving gardens serve as valuable historical records. By giving careful attention to important early paintings such as Ni Zan's (1301-1374) 1373 depiction of Suzhou's Lion Grove Garden and Wen Zhengming's (1470-1559) two albums of 1535 and 1551 depicting Suzhou's Zhuozheng Garden, some historians of Chinese gardens have come in recent years to believe that Suzhou's so-called Ming gardens are better understood as the products of mid-to-late Qing design, with elements even of the twentieth century.25 But sometimes the dating of paint- ings is as perplexing for the Chinese art historian as the dating of buildings and of garden designs, and even when the date of a painting seems secure, the license enjoyed by Chi- nese painters like Ni Zan and Wen Zhengming in rendering detailed subjects like gardens and architecture may well have surpassed even the freedom of architects and carpenters to alter such subjects over time, none of which provides the modern historian much assurance in gauging these dates with accuracy today. Questions of methodology have become increasingly unsettled and conceptually more troubling.26 The Chinese textual record typically proves equally unhelpful in supplying an accurate stylistic description of these garden sites. In surveying Sichuan gardens, the situation is both easier and more frustrating, for no early paintings and few relevant texts appear to exist to either clarify or complicate matters. It is, therefore, a slightly sorry but fairly evident truth</page><page sequence="9">REGION ANI) MEMORY IN THE GARDENS OF SICHUAN 215 . ? . . - ? .

Their architectural array, rather than dense and crowded, is sparse, their court- yards large and loosely compounded. Each main compound tends to retain its structural independence. Water is brought in from sources to the north, drawn down the west side and sometimes the east, and pools in front of the main halls. In Chengdu's or nearby Meishan's gardens, the mountains re- main far outside the garden; the stones inside are few, rela- tively unimportant, and mostly of local varieties that a Suzhou connoisseur would consider provincial and inferior (Fig. 15). Their near absence takes us back to an earlier era. The most conspicuous miniature mountain (jia shan, "false moun- tains") at the Shrine of the Three Sus is made not of stone but of wood (Fig. 16). The horticulture in Suzhou's gardens today is carefully limited and distributed, much of it semi- or fully miniaturized, just as the rockery is. In contrast, Si- chuan's gardens settle beneath a spreading canopy of full- scale vegetation, far wider in variety and collectively casting a darker shadow over the gardens (Figs. 17, 18). The vegeta- 20 Shrine of the Three Sus, black walls tion, often unkempt and including thick stands of tall bam- boo (Figs. 18, 36), adds a visual density to the garden not provided by the architecture itself. Partly as a result, the entire palette by which Sichuan gardens are colored differs from that of Suzhou or Beijing as conventionally as the Venetian palette did from the Florentine or the Roman. The palette of royal architecture in Beijing, like that in Tang-period Chang'an, was grand, loaded with deeply satu- rated reds, greens, blue, and gold. Suzhou wall colors, by contrast, are plain, simple, and elegant: uniformly white- washed stucco-covered walls contrast cleanly with brownish red lacquered columns and doors, pale stone, and gray-tiled roofs. Limestone set against lime-painted stucco walls pro- duces a beautiful tonal minimalism (Fig. 19). In Sichuan, on the other hand, as in Meishan's Shrine of the Three Sus, black lacquer columns, doors, and windows, gray roof tiles, and even some black- and gray-colored walls all plunge the architecture into reclusively deep shadow (Fig. 20).

The occasional use of dark red walls in some of these gardens, a peculiarity I will come back to shortly, further adds to the tonal depth (Figs. 21, 35, 36), as do the shadows cast by multisided, multistoried towers (lou)--an architectural element not to be confused with the Buddhist pagoda (ta), though not unrelated-almost never seen in Suzhou gardens (Fig. 22). The circular (one-sided), square (four-sided, not rectangular), or polygonal (eight- or twelve-sided) building, with conical or pyramidal roof, is rare in China, almost always seen either as state temples, as Bud-</page><page sequence="13">REGION AND IMEMORY IN T-IE GARDENS OF SICHUAN 219 dhist pagodas, or as single-story garden pavilions (ting) and towers (lou).28 The dual appearance of such structures in temple and in garden architecture reinforces an awareness of the garden's religious overtones. Sichuan's multistoried tow- ers, reaching heavenward, invoke this relation even more strongly than the ordinary garden pavilion. The dark naturalism of Sichuan's gardens matches the character of the province, heralded in its own poetry as "luxuriant," "secluded," "dangerous," and "heroic."29 This rustic preference for rugged, primitive naturalism rather than urbane elegance is pursued in Sichuan's finest garden architecture, from its general aspect down to its smallest details. The placement of roof tiles, which in most Suzhou buildings typically includes a smooth sheathing layer of flat tile and a layer of mud beneath the double layer of trough and seam-covering tiles, in Sichuan is structurally much sim- 23 Du Fu Thatched Hall, bamboo gate and fence pler, more primitive: the lower layers of sheathing and mud are completely omitted, with the trough (yin) tiles slung directly onto the rafters, visibly hanging down between them,_ . t7..?, ' - and with small amounts of mud troweled between them and the thin strip of each rafter to hold them in place. All the tiles - "i'- are thinner than in Suzhou, the roof weight considerably less, ' and the whole affair technically less polished, with leaking rainwater a much more common problem and replacement more frequent. In Sichuan gardens, one finds primitive bam- boo gateways and wattle fences that a Japanese gardener might feel at home with (Fig. 23) but unlike those that are usually found in Suzhou or Beijing, Xi'an or Guangzhou. On Mt. Qingcheng, the sacred mountain chain west of Chengdu, where institutionalized Daoism found its first home in the first century C.E., one finds pavilions so primitive they look almost like a bird's nest stuck together with twigs, or at least like a man-made birdcage (Fig. 24). The timbers are not even stripped of their bark. This reversion to the primordial ori- gins of human architecture touches aesthetic bedrock and resonates compellingly with Daoist fundamentals. Ironically, then, this simple structure constitutes one of Sichuan's most esteemed works of architecture. Most importantly, most Sichuan buildings are engineered in an entirely different way from Chinese buildings else- where, the two systems as different as Gothic was from Ro- manesque but with region as well as chronology shaping the 24 Hillside pavilion, Mt.

Best known throughout most of China, the tai- liang or liangzhu system of stacked and elevated tie beams and struts used for suspending the roof beam, purlins, and rafters is efficient, reducing the need for tall timber (Fig. 25). But Sichuan's chuandou system uses tall timber from ground to roof, often placed at close intervals along the gable end and tied together with horizontal beams that penetrate the hol- lowed-out posts (Fig. 26). When repeated through the length of the building, this arrangement of posts breaks the interior space into small rooms, so the system is no more efficient in expanding space than it is in conserving raw materials, but until recently, rugged Sichuan has had timber to spare. The tailiang system is basically designed for efficiency but operates within a narrower range of variables, both structurally and visually, providing little aesthetic variety. Sichuan's chuandou system, on the other hand, leaves the architect free to use the gable ends of the building like a painter's canvas, creating patterns that emerge, like Piet Mondrian's designs, in seem- ingly endless variation (Fig. 27).30 (As mentioned earlier, 28 Wu Hou Ci, roof-ridge decoration virtually no architectural renderings from Sichuan exist to steer architectural historians toward a dated history, and Chinese painters everywhere tend to shy away from depicting the gable end-the informal but structurally more revealing side of buildings.) Other features found consistently through- out this architecture include radically upturned corners with high ridges made of sculpted clay;3l ridge beams tiled with sacred jewel patterns, derived from the pearl-and-flame motif of Buddhist architecture but typically found on even the humblest domestic buildings (Fig. 28) ;32 decorative sus- pended plumbs carved in floral designs (occasionally found elsewhere in China but consistently used only here); the frequent use of stilts to support second-story storage rooms and sometimes whole hillside buildings; the rarity of brackets, which elsewhere serve as a defining feature of institutional architecture; and diagonal struts, often carved with symbolic patterns, extending upward from the columns to the eaves purlins and taking over the function of the missing brackets (Fig. 29).</page><page sequence="15">REGION AND MEMORY IN TI-IE GARDENS OF SIC-IUAN 221 30 Ise Shinto Shrine, Yojoden (photo: Yoshio Watanabe, from Kenzo Tange et al., Ise: Prototype ofJapanese Architecture, 136) I I I 29 Du Fu Thatched Hall, Water Bamboo Dwelling, eave- bearing struts If Sichuan's architecture reminds travelers of early sur- viving Japanese architecture, this is surely more than just coincidental. There is a very striking affinity here that needs to be explored at various levels. For example, at Japan's national Ise Shinto Shrine, one of the most notable distinguishing features is the use of extended gable fascia (chigi) and a series of short pegs crossing the ridge beam, called katsuogi (Fig. 30). Noboru Kawazoe has written that these "have a function, but it is aesthetic and expressive, not structural,"33 but on thatched farmhouses near Chengdu, we find strikingly similar features, with bundles of rice thatch that help lash down the ridge beam and attach the roofing thatch (Fig. 31). In one of Sichuan's finest old buildings, the Water Bamboo Dwelling at the Du Fu Thatched Hall (with a remarkable under-the-floor sys- tem of ventilation), the latticed windows, full-length along three sides of the building (Fig. 32), bring to mind Ise's Yojoden, the latter building probably derived in form from a stable for Japan's sacred horses, and one can readily imagine that its Chengdu counterpart, if not original to the eighth century, was at least inspired by the memory of Du Fu's great love for horses and horse paintings.34 Overall, Sichuan's style is both primitive and sophisti- cated-like a Gothic cathedral or, like Ise itself, an onto- 31 Farmhouse northwest of Chengdu logical remnant of a distant past that might be supplanted by a more sophisticated technology but not surpassed aes- thetically. Historically, I propose this thesis: that Sichuan's chuandou architecture preceded China's tailiang; that it once spread over most of China; that tailiang was devel- oped in the early centuries before the Common Era to cope with northern China's gradual deforestation, emerg- ing more or less together with dougong bracketing; and that over the succeeding centuries, chuandou gradually re- treated to southern and southwestern China with the re- cession of China's vanishing woodlot of tall evergreens. A study of the posthole pattern in ancient raised-foundation remains dating all the way back to the Shang dynasty (ca. 1600-ca. 1035 B.C.E.) in north-central China (Fig. 33), arrayed in depth across the gable end of buildings, sup- ports this possibility, complemented by the persistence into recent times of occasional chuandou engineering in the north. The presence of chuandou-like inserted tie beams and multiple gable-end ground-to-roof columns in early-eighth-century Japan in buildings like the Horyuji's Denpodo (at Ikaruga, Nara Prefecture, originally a secular</page><page sequence="16">222 ART BUI.I.ETIrN JUNE 2004 VOLUME LXXXVI NUMBER 2 32 Du Fu Thatched Hall, Water Bamboo Dwelling, view of main entrance residence, donated and converted in 739 into a Buddhist lecture hall) suggests that chuandou, at least in a hybridized form, was still available for transmission from the southern coast of China at that relatively late date (Fig. 34).35 In all, then, Sichuan's chuandou architecture is like star- light that allows us to peer into China's distant architec- tural past. This does not imply simply some laggard con- servatism, for in decorative details Sichuan has readily blended native features with southern Chinese, Southeast Asian, and even Tibetan elements into its art of building, together with northern and northeastern features brought in during the various early politically driven migrations into the province. But there is a core traditionalism in its approach, evident in the chuandou engineering system and the classically Tang-like arrangement of buildings within the landscape, and additionally coded by the red stucco walls mentioned earlier: red stucco used sometimes for buildings, sometimes for freestanding walls, sometimes for the long, curving walkways unique to Sichuan's gardens (Figs. 21, 35). Elsewhere, red walls are normally limited to royal palaces, temples, and shrines, as well as for enshrin- ing workers' factories in the Communist era. Their pres- ence in Sichuan gardens signals the distinctive function of 33 Schematic reconstruction of ceremonial structure at Anyang, Henan Province, ca. 1250 B.C.E.

Whereas Suzhou's finest gardens were typically private landholdings whose wealthy owners were often historically marginal figures,3" the major Sichuan gardens are associated with revered contributors to Si- chuan's regional society and literature. Among them are the brilliant hydrologist Li Bing (early third century B.C.E.), who tamed and reshaped Sichuan's river system as governor of the Shu Commandery under Qin authority,37 and his son Erlang, the tamer of Sichuan's forests-the two deified and worshiped together at the Two Kings Shrine, at Dujiangyan;38 or the early-third-century burial ground of the ruler Liu Bei (162-223) of the Shu-Han Kingdom and the shrine of his minister, the immensely talented and popular Zhuge Liang (181-234), who chose to be buried outside the province rather than upstage his own ruler (the two figures were subsequently conjoined at the Zhao- lie Miao and Wu Hou Ci in Chengdu, Figs. 21, 28, 35);39 the Zither Terrace of the poet Sima Xiangru and the famous well at which he and his wife Zhuo Wenjun made their humble living producing wine, in Qiong- lai; Chen Zi'ang's study on Jinhua Mountain; Chengdu's Thatched Hall of the eighth-century poet Du Fu, probably dating back to about the tenth century (Figs. 13, 17, 18, 23, 26, 29, 32); the Longxi Garden of the eighth-century poet Li Bo, in Qinglian Xian; the River Viewing Tower Park, which overlooks Chengdu's Brocade River, dedicated to the ninth-century female poet Xue Tao (768/781-831/ 832), now with its famous assortment of bamboo (Figs. 22, 36);40 the Shrine of the Three Sus at Meishan: the great . , 4 .</page><page sequence="17">REGION AND MEMORY IN THE GARDENS OF SICHUAN 223 34 Horyilji, Ikaruga, Nara Prefecture, Denpodo, early 8th century (from Kakichi Suzuki, Early Buddhist Architecture in Japan, pl. 90) eleventh-century poet-statesman-calligrapher painter Su Shi, his father Su Xun (943-1047), and his younger brother Su Che (1039-1112) (Figs. 14, 20); the shrine of poet Lu You at the Yanhua Pool where he served in Shuzhou (now called Chongqing, southwest of Chengdu); and others.41 As suggested earlier, the dating of these garden sites and their architecture is particularly challenging, and only more recent dates can sometimes accurately be provided. For ex- ample, the poet Wei Zhuang (836?-910), boating down Chengdu's Washing Flowers Stream (Huanhua xi), noted in verse that "the column bases still remain" from Du Fu's thatched hall on the west side of town, meaning, of course, that nothing more survived-other than a solitary thatched room, which he recorded as hovering over the ruins.42 His- torical records demonstrate that in the Northern Song pe- riod (960-1127), Li Dafang, the prefect of Chengdu, rebuilt Du Fu's thatched hall and hung his portrait and that local officials in the early Southern Song (1127-1279) raised funds to extend the hall, add courtyards, and plant trees, flowers, and bamboo. But how this or the approximately seventeen recorded further restorations of the next three dynasties reflected a Tang dynasty original style or is retained in today's style is not easily demonstrated.43 In the war with Japan, the entire site was horribly damaged and required near-total restoration after the Chinese civil war ended in 1949. In the years since 1981, I have seen both significant erasures and wholesale additions. The River Viewing Tower Park associ- ated with the poetess Xue Tao is built on the wrong side of town, as her known dwelling place was on the east side of Chengdu rather than the west (she was a near neighbor of Du Fu's estate). The well that can be seen there today, associated 35 Wu Hou Ci, red-walled walk, behind the Tomb of Liu Bei (Hui Ling) with her famous papermaking, was first established in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), although it was not originally named after Xue Tao, while the stone stela inscribed "Xue Tao's Well" (Fig. 36) was written in 1644 by the mayor of Chengdu, Bei Yingxiong. The three pavilions of Poetry-chant- ing, Paper-washing, and Brocade-washing were not built until 1814 (the first of these three authorized by the provincial governor and city mayor) and then were rebuilt after burning down in the early 1850s, and the landmark three-story tower for which the garden was later given its name, in 1953, was built in 1889 (Fig. 22). The "tomb of Xue Tao" is hardly likely to be hers.44 As these two examples suggest, while some of Sichuan's garden sites may be original to their owners, others may have been selected and developed only long centuries after the death of those they honor (individual buildings are no easier to date but are typically much younger than the site itself). But they all function as memorial sites. Thus, their red walls (Figs. 21, 35), thus, the strong presence of me- morial tablets, memorial halls, memorial images, and me- morial stelae (Fig. 36). More like public parks, these were sites where the general public could come to venerate those great men and women of culture who had risen among them.

Functionally, these gar- dens lie as much in the domains of tomb architecture and of Daoist temples and shrines as in that of domestic gar- dens. Some of their patrons who paid for their upkeep and development were probably actual descendants, like the Su family of Meishan, which sports a huge population today claiming descent from the famous Su Shi. Otherwise, pa- tronage seems to have been picked up by the civic and financial leaders of the community. The single-ownership and restricted urban scale of Suzhou's gardens allowed periodically for the coherent refurbishing of an inherited design and account for the relative stylistic consistency of each as seen today. The varied architectural assemblage within any one Sichuan garden-set on a large and sprawl- ing site, probably with a longer history and more diversi- fied patronage than any of Suzhou's gardens-reveals a range of visual expression and mixture of details closely juxtaposed, often impossible to sort out by date yet whose striking inconsistency speaks to a constant change around the stylistic edges even as the basic system appears to have remained unchanged. As described earlier, chuandou itself seems to have encouraged such variation. The conserva- tism of Sichuan's garden style, then, can be explained not merely by the general conservatism of this landlocked geographic bastion but more importantly by the special tenacity with which Sichuan, long ignored in the public record of China, has chosen to memorialize its favored ancestors as a display of regional pride. With regional differentiation as a central topic, it would be inadequate here to essentialize "Sichuan" itself, for Sichuan is huge and internally differentiated, and aspects of its style spread beyond the dotted lines of any map. In ancient times, the region was divided between Shu on the great agrarian plain to the west (the Red Basin) and Ba in the narrow valley district to the east, domains centered around Chengdu and Chongqing, respectively. Today, this ancient political divide has been reestablished with the removal in 1998 of Chongqing from the province of Si- chuan and the establishment of a Chongqing special eco- nomic zone that reports not to the provincial governor but directly to the State Council (Guowuyuan) in Beijing. Technically, this makes Chongqing the largest municipal- ity in the world, with a population of about thirty million and an area the size of Austria. What has been described here as "Sichuan style" more closely conforms to a classic Chengdu style than to the gardens of hilly Chongqing, whose profiles are even more rugged and elevations more varied, and whose collective architectural history beyond the mid-nineteenth century is even murkier than that of its counterpart in Chengdu. Further study of institutional records may contribute to further differentiation, but it can still be expected to rein- force the general characteristics described here. Sichuan style presumably also overlaps significantly with the re- gional styles ofYunnan to the south and Hunan to the east. Still, just as the gourmet can readily differentiate between the spicy cuisines of Sichuan and Hunan for which each is equally renowned, distinguishing what they do not share from what they do, there is a core style in Sichuan's garden architecture, a particular function and a patronage pattern that come together to render Sichuan distinctive in its garden heritage. The presence of such significant regional variation within the Chinese architectural domain may not entirely negate the formulation of an essential "Chinese garden," but it draws attention to the greater complexity to be found within China's family of gardens and suggests further new horizons for regionally based architectural study.</page><page sequence="19">REGION AND MEMORY IN THE GARDENS OF SICHUAN 225 Jerome Silbergeld is the P.

However, in his book Fruitful Sites: Garden Culture in Ming Dynasty China (London: Reaktion Books, 1996), 51, Clunas argues that by its conspicuous absence from Ming dynasty sump- tuary legislation, which otherwise "encompassed every aspect of material culture that it was possible to view as an object of consumption, from gar- ments to dwellings to furniture and tableware," gardens must have been viewed "as being something conceptually allied to production, rather than as an object of luxury consumption," hence not specifically regulated. Such study extended into other periods of time has yet to be undertaken. 5. Siren (as in n. 3), iii. 6.

Throughout its long history, the area that constitutes modern-day Si- chuan has undergone repeated transformations in its political and carto- graphic identity, not until the late 13th century achieving a somewhat stable existence under the name Sichuan (literally, the "Four Rivers," counting the Min, Tuo,Jialing, and either the Qian, the Fou, or the Yangzi River). Looking back into its tangled history prior to its conquest by the state of Qin in 316 B.C.E. (which later achieved the first unification of China), the region was divided into two contending political-ethnic groups, one known as Shu, centered around modern Chengdu in the west, the other called Ba, centered in what is now Chongqing in the east. When China divided into three contending regions following the fall of the Han dynasty in the early 3rd century, one of these occupied the southwest, with Chengdu as its capital (far more extensive in territory than modern Sichuan) and adopted the name Shu-Han; when China was again disunited in the 10th century after the fall of the Tang dynasty, Chengdu was the capital of the Qian (Former) Shu King- dom and then of the Hou (Latter) Shu Kingdom (both states fairly close in scale to that of modern Sichuan Province). In a 1955 transformation, Sichuan received the eastern portion of Xikang Province, primarily Tibetan in ethnic- ity, the remainder of which was restored to Tibet. Sichuan remains the most ethnically diverse province in China today. 11.

Most of these Ming examples, more precisely, represented writers disassociating them- selves from the luxury consumers of their day, antisnob snobs perhaps, whatever their own actual economic practices may have been.

In the Garden of the Master of Fishing Nets, the view from the main hall to the central lake is blocked by a two-story-tall pile of rocks, turning the eye instead to the narrow, shaded, "backyard," which in turn focuses attention on the garden's signature (net-shaped) lattice windows. This rock pile is referred to by name as the Barrier of Clouds, transforming yanginto yin. A second-story library must be accessed outdoors by yet another pile of "clouds." A rare, black-painted wall serves as a night sky, turning an open moon-gate into a white shining orb, beside which is planted a cassia tree, Chinese symbol of the moon (the largest rock of all). A half dozen other "tricks" become apparent, but perhaps only on one's fourth or fifth visit to the garden. 24.

A study of some of Wen Zhengming's Zhuozheng Garden illustrations has ledJan Stuart (as in n. 21), 171, to conclude, "The only evidence that Wen Zhengming's album can provide about the physical appearance of the [Zhuozheng Garden] is that [owner] Wang Xianchen must have had a rock ledge near his pond. But, based on Wen Zhengming's painting, we cannot know how large it was or what it looked like. Artists, who were either painting their own garden or a close friend's, emphasized the meaning of the garden not its appearance. Ming scholar-officials were more concerned with the ideas in a garden than physical attributes." 27. The most influential of all studies of Suzhou gardens has now been translated into English: Liu Dunzhen, Chinese Classical Gardens of Suzhou, trans. Chen Lixian (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1992). 28. For literature on state temples (mingtang), quasi observatories with astrological functions, emphatic seasonal, monthly, and complex numerical associations that court advisers argued passionately and sometimes endlessly over, and their successors down to the present day struggled to reconstruct or merely understand, see Edward Soothill, Hall of Light: A Study of Early Chinese Kingship (London: Lutterworth Press, 1951); and Nancy Steinhardt, "The Han Ritual Hall," in Chinese Traditional Architecture (New York: China Institute, 1984), 70-77.

Rhyming in the original ("Emei Tianxia xiu / Qingcheng Tianxia yu / Jianmen Tianxia xian / Kuimen Tianxiajian"), Sichuan's (anonymous) logo poem names the province's four most famous sites, all of them dark and dangerous, including theJianmen (Sword Gate) Pass ("so narrow that a single swordsman could hold off an army of ten thousand"), which leads into the Chengdu Plain from the north, and ending with the Yangzi River's Kuimen Gorge (Fig. 2), which leads into the province from the east: "Mt. Emei, most luxuriant place on earth / Mt. Qingcheng, most secluded place on earth / Jianmen Pass, most dangerous place on earth / Kuimen Gorge, most heroic place on earth." 30. Indicative of his lack of exposure to Sichuan architecture, the mod- ern founder of Chinese architectural history, Liang Sicheng, makes no mention of chuandou in the volume that summarized his pioneering career, A Pictorial History of Chinese Architecture: A Study of the Development of Its Structural System and the Evolution of Its Types (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1984). But evidence of chuandou's antiquity does appear there, unlabeled, in Liang's drawing, fig. 14, of a ceramic house model from a Han dynasty tomb, lst-2nd century c.E., from Changsha, which then as now lay one province to the east of Sichuan. Evidence of chuandou archi- tecture's still more ancient roots in Sichuan itself is found in a cluster of houses from about 1000 B.C.E. from Shi'erqiao, where Chengdu now stands, whose long end beams (drilled at regular horizontal intervals) and planks of wood, walls of bamboo, and straw roofs were sufficiently well preserved when excavated in the late 1980s to permit a reasonable recon- struction; see "Chengdu Shi'erqiao Shangdai jianzhu yizhi diyiqi fajue jianbao" [Preliminary report on the excavation of the first-period archi- tectural remains from the Shang Dynasty at Shi'erqiao, Chengdu], Wenwu 379, no. 12 (Dec. 1987): 1-23, fig. 11, pl. 2.1; and Jay Xu, "Sichuan before the Warring States Period," in Bagley (as in n. 7), 34-35, fig. 10. 31. This curvature becomes increasingly pronounced as one travels south from Chengdu toward Yunnan Province, suggesting Southeast Asian origins. 32. In 2001, retracing the ancient path of Emperor Minghuang's (r. 713- 56) famous flight from insurrectionist troops in 756 from the northern capital at Chang'an into Sichuan, I observed these decorative ridge tiles suddenly begin to appear within the first five miles or so south of the Shaanxi-Sichuan border and thereon continue with great regularity. Rarely in architecture does regionalism so closely approximate political boundaries. 33.

For discussion of some of Du Fu's renowned poems on the horse paintings of his day, especially those by Cao Ba (act. mid-8th century) and Han Gan (ca. 715-after 781), who were said to set the standard for all time, see Wang Bomin, ed., Li Bo, Du Fu lun hua shi sanji [Miscellaneous notes on poems by Li Bo and Du Fu about painting] (Shanghai: Xiling yinshe, 1983), 78-90;Joseph Lee, "Tu Fu's Art Criticism and Han Kan's Painting," Journal of the American Oriental Society 90, no. 3 (July-Sept. 1970): 449-61; and David Hawkes, A Little Primer of Tu Fu (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1967), 133-44. 35. Several similarly constructed buildings still exist from that moment in time, little altered despite periodic reconstructions, including the sutra re- pository and belfry in the main compound of Horyuji's west precinct, Kairyuoji's west Kondo (Nara), and the Tegaimon from Todaiji (also Nara). See Mary Neighbour Parent's detailed study The Roof in Japanese Buddhist Architecture (New York: Weatherhill; Tokyo: Kaijima, 1983), 28-32, 44-47. Parent (18-20) describes the period as one of a "flood of cultural importation from Tang China" in architecture; she does not mention chuandou, and nothing is really known as yet of its vestiges at that time in eastern China, where this "flood" would have arrived from. However, further research could be pursued on the basis of this Japanese material. 36. See Clunas, 1996 (as in n. 4); also, Liu Dunzhen (as in n. 27). 37.

Aerial-view drawings of the Du Fu Thatched Hall closely based on Qing-period stone carvings of 1793 and 1881 are published in Zhao Changgeng (as in n. 41), 42-43, showing ongoing changes in the particulars but stability in the design principles described here. Both the Water Gate (Fig. 17) and the Water Bamboo Dwelling (Figs. 18, 26, 29, 32) make their first appearance in the 1881 stone carving; however, the Water Bamboo Dwelling seems to have been reconstructed and rotated 90 degrees between 1881 and the present day. 44.
