<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ashley's Textiles by Richard Calvocoressi The name of Ashley Havinden - or 'Ashley', as he chose to sign his work - will always remain synonymous with the elegant and popular face of modernism in graphic design and typo- graphy. During the 1930s, designs for posters, advertisements, packages, book covers, brochures, showcards and catalogues, all stamped with his clean but cheerful asymmetric style, poured from the offices of W. S. Crawford Ltd., the London advertising agency whose artistic director Ashley was from 1929 until his retirement thirty-eight years later. Today, connoisseurs of the period tend to play down his remarkable achievement in visual com- munication, while drawing attention to the work of other brilliant artist-designers such as E. McKnight Kauffer - forgetting, perhaps, that it was Ashley who was responsible for Crawfords employing Kauffer in 1929-30, and that it was Ashley, too, who was the strongest supporter in public of Kauffer's work: whenever the opportunity arose, in lectures, articles and interviews, he would never fail to push his friend's designs above his own. Ashley's activities in other fields have also been ignored: as an abstract painter and as a designer of rugs and fabrics. Neither of these was connected with his commercial work for Crawfords, although it would be foolish to pretend that experience in one field did not inform and enhance work in another: techniques used in commercial art - air-brush spraying, for example - would often find their way into Ashley's paintings, whilst abstract shapes devised in painting would be borrowed as the basis for symbols and motifs in both graphic art and textile design. It is worth chronicling Ashley's brief affair ( c . 1934-39) with the textile industry since it is here that the qualities of wit and slickness which we associate with some of his commercial designs are quietened and softened into something altogether more lyrical : with no message to put across, Ashley could afford to relax his dandyish pose. This is particularly evident in a fadeless, glazed cotton fabric called Ashley's Abstract (plate 1) which was produced by Edinburgh Weavers in 1937.1 The biomorphic and vaguely anthropomorphic forms of the pattern, printed in an attractive colour scheme of powder blue, rust, coral and slate, suggest a general familiarity with the sculpture of Henry Moore and more specifically with Moore's drawings - his habit of jotting down any number of 'sculptural ideas' on a single sheet of paper. Ashley in fact took lessons in drawing from Moore in 1932, when both men were living in Hampstead, in order to improve his sense of three-dimensional form. As would be expected, Moore's attitude to line was very different from that of his pupil, who regarded it as essentially decorative and not descriptive or suggestive of forms in the round. In his Line Drawing for Reproduction, an excellent little manual for the aspiring commercial artist and illustrator published by The Studio in 1933, Ashley illustrated part of a page of Moore's sketches, recom- mending to the student the sculptor's method of establishing shape or mass on paper by means of rapid wash first, before exploring its contour with a pen - the opposite of his own practice.2 The fabric called Ashley's Abstract reproduces something of this freer manner of working. Ashley's first designs for textiles were commissioned in 1934 by the husband and wife firm of Duncan Miller Ltd. The Havindens had met the Duncan Millers a year earlier, in 1933, while the latter were still in charge of the modern furniture department at Curtis Moffat in Fitzroy Square. They became close friends, dining together once a week, and later shared a weekend house in Hampshire, together with the cartoonist and illustrator Walter Goetz and the architect Wells Coates, a friend of the Millers who was responsible for introducing Ashley to Gropius, Breuer, Moholy-Nagy and Bayer at his appartment in Lawn Road Flats. Duncan Miller Ltd. had a lucrative sideline hiring out ihodern interiors to film and theatre companies. This sometimes included rugs which were designed by Ashley and handwoven by the Royal 4</page><page sequence="2">Wilton Carpet Company. 'As a result of my experiments in abstract painting', Ashley later wrote, 'I jumped at the idea of the application of bold brush forms and vivid colours to produce "swooping" designs for modern rugs'.3 The rugs were generally quite large, some measuring as much as 17ft by 10ft. Ashley was paid by the foot, at the rate of Is, and when each rug had outlived its usefulness (there was a constant demand for new designs) he was given the opportunity of buying it for £5. Through rug designing Ashley evolved his famous 'Ashley Script', first used on posters for the Milk Marketing Board's propaganda campaign in 1936 and later on advertisements for the Brewers Society, Simpsons of Piccadilly, Enos and many other firms. This type gives the appearance of having been drawn free-hand with a thick brush; its informality and fluidity (eminently suitable for advertising liquids such as milk and beer) stem directly from the 'bold brush forms' of Ashley's rug designs. Ashley's professional relationship with the enterprising Duncan Millers continued through- out the thirties. In 1935 he was asked by Alex Simpson, the young managing director of the menswear firm of S. Simpson Ltd, to carry out the advertising and some of the interior design for his new department store in Piccadilly, built by Joseph Emberton and finally opened on April 29, 1936. Simpsons were already clients of Crawfords, who had been responsible for handling the publicity campaign in 1934 to launch their revolutionary 30 shillings ready-made beltless flannel trousers - better known by its brand name, Daks. For the new building Ashley designed Simpsons' name-plate and trade-mark - the former set discreetly at eye level in metal letters on the black marble front of the store, the latter a simple but ingenious needle and thread device in the shape of an 'S' (praised by Herbert Read for being both 'human' and 'abstract'4), which appeared on publicity brochures, on crockery, cutlery and menu covers in the Snack Bar and which was woven into rugs throughout the store. An important part of Ashley's commission involved designing a range of twenty large rugs for the various floors of the six-storey building, and this is where Duncan Miller came in. Presumably at Ashley's suggestion, the rugs were produced as before by Duncan Miller and woven by Royal Wilton. It was also at Ashley's suggestion that Moholy-Nagy was employed for a year or so by Simpsons as a part-time design consultant to arrange the window and some of the interior displays in the new store. The two street windows were the longest strips of non- reflecting glass in London at the time and it required considerable skill in lighting and display techniques to entice window-shoppers with a continuously changing array of goods. Both here and in his exhibition of Flying on the sixth floor Moholy made use of screens pierced with square or circular openings. Training in display was available in the shop to any Simpsons agent in Britain who was interested. It is worth recounting the story of Simpsons in some detail because the shop became identified in the mind of the trade and the public with a 'new look' in large stores, sleek and stream- lined, helped on no doubt by Ashley's rugs and his efforts to give the firm a distinctive styling.5 The building inside and out was noted for its imaginative lighting, its attention to detail and the ease and comfort with which customers could select their purchases. Although it was too late to incorporate Moholy 's suggestion that the lift-shafts should be allowed to operate in glass-enclosed columns instead of being built into wells, so that passengers could survey the different displays on each floor as they travelled up and down, the Modern Movement ideals of functionalism and honesty were not absent from the bespoke tailoring department on the fourth floor, where a customer could watch cutters at work behind a large glass screen while being fitted for his latest grey flannel or worsted three-piece. Moholy 's salary appears to have been £2,000, while for his rug designs Ashley was offered 350 guineas on account at the store. The reason for this was simply the enormous cost of the whole operation and the fact that Simpsons, unlike other new London stores such as Peter Jones (owned by John Lewis &amp; Co. Ltd.), had a relatively small capital. Ashley's reputation as a natty dresser and his interest in clothes - in 1946 he designed the menswear section at the 'Britain Can Make It' exhibition, as well as the official poster - may have had its origins in this unusual method of payment. 5</page><page sequence="3">In August 1937 the Duncan Millers gave Ashley a one-man exhibition of his rugs and fabrics at their showrooms in Lower Grosvenor Place, which coincided with two further exhibitions of his work in London: of abstract paintings at the London Gallery and of posters, typography and advertisements at Lund Humphries in Bedford Square. In a contemporary photograph of the exhibition at Duncan Miller (plate 2), Ashley's Abstract can be seen draped from a table, behind which hangs one of the Royal Wilton rugs. The same rug was later illustrated in a photograph of Lady Daphne Straight's writing-room in Harper's Bazaar , February 1938. To the right of this rug can just be made out a second draped fabric called Swallow, an organdie produced by Warner and Sons for Duncan Miller. It makes use of one of Ashley's favourite motifs, a bird and olive (see below). The London Gallery in Cork Street had been founded the previous year by Mrs Noel Norton, a former employee of Crawfords. It opened in October 1936 and for a year or so remained committed to showing non-objective art, one of the very few in Britain at the time to do so. One-man shows devoted to the work of Moholy-Nagy, Bayer, Ashley and Gabo were held, as well as an important mixed exhibition of 'Constructive Art' in July 19376 Both Marcel Breuer and Herbert Bayer were involved with the gallery's interior decoration, while Ashley designed its stationery and publicity material in a spare, asymmetric idiom strongly reminiscent of Bauhaus typography and sat on the advisory committee with Gropius, Moholy-Nagy, Bayer, Moore, Herbert Read and others. One of the principal aims of the gallery, before it was taken over by the Surrealists in 1938, was to integrate abstract painting and sculpture with interior design, a policy also adopted by Duncan Miller. In the same year that the London Gallery opened, an exhibition called 'Modern Pictures for Modern Rooms', organised by S. John Woods and Duncan Miller, was held at the latter's showrooms; in it works by Brancusi, Gabo, Giacometti, Hepworth, Moholy-Nagy, Mondrian, Nicholson, Piper and others could be seen in contemporary settings. Three years later, at the San Francisco Golden Gate exhibition of 1939, a room designed by Duncan Miller, incorporating an Ashley rug produced by Edinburgh Weavers, boasted a Piper abstract painting and a carving by Moore, both of about 1937. The rugs which Ashley designed for Edinburgh Weavers were few and were of the hand- knotted Donegal type; they were made at Morton Sundour's works at Carlisle. Edinburgh Weavers had been founded in 1928 by James Morton as a research unit to create fabrics which were in keeping with the spirit of contemporary architecture and design, but which represented a deliberate move away from the restrained beiges and off-whites of the Twenties, towards a style whose chief considerations were 'space and texture and colour'.7 The firm was based at Edinburgh, where the Morton family were then living, for only the first couple of years of its existence; after the slump of 1930 it was forced to merge with the parent company at Carlisle, where all its fabrics were subsequently manufactured. It did, however, maintain showrooms in the West End of London (Hanover Square and after 1935, New Bond Street) which were run by Antony Hunt, EW's public relations man.8 Both Hunt and Alastair Morton, EW's artistic director, believed passionately in the search for a modern style in textiles and to this end employed painters, sculptors and commercial artists to initiate visual ideas which could be refined and converted into fabrics. One of Morton's closest supporters during the Thirties was Gordon Russell whose firm often incorporated EW fabrics into its interior displays and advertising. Betty Joel in Knightsbridge was another place where EW, as well as Duncan Miller, fabrics could be seen. Ashley first came into contact with Edinburgh Weavers in 1935 when he designed a publicity brochure and showcard for Morton Sundour Fabrics, as well as the cover of the bi-annual house magazine, the Sundour Shuttle, for which he used the same 'Sundour Flower' motif. It was probably shortly afterwards that Alastair Morton first asked him to design a fabric for EW ; a letter written to Ashley in May 1936 seems to indicate that a professional rapport was already well established: 6</page><page sequence="4">'I took away with me last time I saw you one of your rough sketches to see if we could work it into a repeat. I am sending you to-day a sketch showing how we intend to work it out, and I would like your comments on this. It has not been too easy, and some of the shapes I do not like too well. I think the brown colouring would look better if it can be further subdued and put white on a coloured ground'.9 This careful co-operative relationship between producer and designer was typical of Morton. His experience of different fibres, his ability to spot which design should be a weave and which a print, his capacity to invent special printing techniques and use new weaves and con- structions, and, simultaneously, his genuine understanding of those artists he chose to use - all these factors contributed to the originality and high quality of so many EW fabrics of the Thirties. Ashley enjoyed a close collaboration with Morton which lasted until the outbreak of war. Years later he recalled the nature of that co-operation: 'I remember Alastair Morton telling me to ignore the limitations of the "Jacquard" looms. He said it was his job together with his assistants to find a way of interpreting my designs in the weaving. My only limitation was to see that my designs were made to the correct cloth width, and also the "repeats" of the pattern were to be indicated so that they were practical. '10 Because he was at heart a painter - it was Ashley who suggested he 'go abstract' in 1936 - Morton alone could translate sympathetically the work of fellow artists into the different, though still two-dimensional, medium of fabric. All he required of his artist-designers was they they should understand the basic principles of weaving; it was his own job to know about weave effects, cloth constructions and other technical details. Ben Nicholson, who executed at least half a dozen designs for EW during the late 1930s, thought that his own fabrics 'should have been attributed half to him (Morton) and half to me'.11 Morton's most significant venture at Edinburgh Weavers before the war was to launch a range of 'Constructivist Fabrics' in October 1937, to designs by Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, Eileen Holding, Arthur Jackson, Winifred Nicholson and Ashley. Although Ashley was never really a part of the British Constructivist movement - if movement isn't too strong a word - he was nevertheless painting abstract pictures at the time, in a style influenced by his ex-Bauhaus friends Bayer and Moholy-Nagy. Early in 1939 he showed eight of these paintings at the Lefevre Gallery in a mixed exhibition of nine abstract artists which included Morton, J. C. Stephenson and Arthur Jackson. A one-man show of Ben Nicholson's work was held simultaneously at the same gallery, and reviewing both exhibitions in The Listener, John Summerson accurately defined both the strength and limitation of Ashley's talent when he described his 'hard, clear immaculate studies' as 'a half-way house between creative and decorative design'.12 (T. W. Earp in the Daily Telegraph was less kind, finding 'Havinden's circles and osseous shapes' lacking in 'impulse of design'; he dismissed the work of the group as a whole as no more than 'minor, decorative ornament'.13). Ashley's contribution to the EW Constructivist range was a woven fabric called Segment (plate 3), a design consisting of white squares and overlapping concentric circles against a background of pastel green, blue or one of two or three other shades: like most EW fabrics, it was manufactured in several colourways. Segment is probably the most geometrical-abstract design Ashley ever created, with the possible exception of a woven fabric called Eclipse, which was introduced by Edinburgh Weavers in 1935 and advertised covering a Finmar chair. There is no absolute certainty that Ashley was responsible for designing Eclipse but he gave that title to one of his paintings of the same year and, in 1939, painted a work, Forms through Slats, which bears a certain resemblance to the fabric. Ashley's Abstract was also announced along with the Constructivist Fabrics although it had been seen two months earlier in Ashley's exhibition at Duncan Miller. Strictly speaking it bears little relation to the hard-edged forms and restrained use of colour to be found, for example, in Ben Nicholson's Vertical - a design based on his White Reliefs (one of which Morton owned) and made up brilliantly by Edinburgh Weavers with those contrasting weaves and other textural effects for which the firm was admired. 7</page><page sequence="5">Plate 1 Ashley's Abstract designed by Ashley Havinden for Edinburgh Weavers, 1937 .

On the wall hang two of Ashley's abstract paintings Eclipse, 1935, and Solar Movement, 1936. 11</page><page sequence="9">In some unpublished Notes on Fabric Design, written just before Edinburgh Weavers launched its Constructivist range, Alastair Morton expressed his convinction that 'Contemporary design- should develop two styles; firstly a style built up of sensitive formalised objects having pleasing associations, such as flowers, leaves etc. (this style will be the most popular), and, secondly, an abstract style similar to the present constructivist paintings, depending alone on the abstract qualities of colour and form'.14 Both styles were proposed by Morton as alternatives to those period concoctions - Regency, Victorian, William Morris - which the textile trade in a moment of uncertainty was then reviving. There is no doubt that Morton's closest sympathies lay with the latter, abstract style; Ashley's designs, on the other hand, conform more or less to the former, and designs for EW by Marion Dorn, John Tandy, Hans Aufseeser and Miriam Wornum also fit Morton's prescription for a more popular style. Amongst EW woven fabrics by Ashley in this stylised - representational idiom can be counted the following: Milky Way, Maskerade and Alvan, all 1935; Silvan, 1936 and Uccello, 1937-8. Milky Way, whose theme is stars and comets, has a satin ground in a range of brilliant shades, upon which a rough etched shading of beige is traversed by a floating ribbon design in white. It also came as a hand-tufted rug, reflecting Ashley's belief in the correlation of fabric and carpet designs: 'I approached the fabric field through rug designing and so the designs tend to be suitable for rugs as well as fabrics'.15 The consistency of Ashley's designs can be appreciated by looking at the photograph of his exhibition at Duncan Miller (plate 2). The composition of Milky Way is interesting since only one unit of the fabric was actually drawn, making a complete rug design, while the pattern repeat of the fabric was achieved photo- graphically. Maskerade (plate 4) is a rayon fabric which also makes use of stars (combined with flowing lines on a soft matt ground), as does a hand block-printed fabric which Ashley designed for Campbell Fabrics in 1937. The latter has a distinctly marine flavour: lengths of rope coil around stars, which are presumably meant to represent starfish. Such motifs are common to Edward Wadsworth's surrealist paintings of the same date. The marine style in furnishing fabrics was probably influenced by the decorative work which artists like Wads worth carried out for ocean liners. EW fabrics were used on both the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth. In 1938 Ashley designed another marine fabric, this time for Edinburgh Weavers, an attractive chintz printed in blue and orange with a formalised sea and shell motif. Silvan (plate 5) is an example of the 'Lumetufť or machine tufted process introduced by EW in 1937; Marion Dorn's Hasta, which shows even more strikingly the effect öf different weaves, belongs to the same category. Silvan is a mixture of cotton and rayon damask in basic colours of pale green, blue or rust. Small-scale drawings in pencil or gouache for its oak-leaf design point to Ashley's meticulous working method; he worked out ideas for paintings in the same precise, miniature fashion. The leaf reappears in other Ashley fabrics of the time (eg on a screen print produced by EW in 1938). The bird and olive motif is likewise not restricted to Uccello (plate 6) but can be found in Ashley's graphic work16, and, with variations, in a hand block-printed fabric of delightfully simple design which Campbell Fabrics brought out in 1938. Ucello, a rayon and cotton fabric, was produced in four colour combinations; here the use of different weaves gives varying degrees of sheen to the material. But the contrast of colours and textures which became something of a hallmark of EW fabrics during the Thirties can be seen at its best in another weave, almost certainly designed by Ashley, which exploits the more fluid forms of contemporary abstract art. There appears to be no record of the exact title and date of the fabric but Ashley used it to cover the dining-room chairs in his flat at High Point Two (architects Lubetkin and Tecton), where he moved in 1938 (plate 7). The fabric probably dates from the previous year when Ashley painted a picture, Composition with Floating Forms, later interpreted in tapestry form by Aubusson, whose biomorphic shapes - like a flattened Arp relief or Calder mobile17 - closely resemble those of the fabric repeat. The same shapes reappear on the cover of the MARS (Modern Architectural Research group) exhibition catalogue which Ashley designed towards the end of 1937 for John Summerson, who wrote the text. In its preliminary stages, the design of this didactic exhibition, which ran 12</page><page sequence="10">from January 11-29, 1938, at the New Burlington Galleries, was in the capable hands of Moholy-Nagy; after his departure to found the New Bauhaus at Chicago the job was handed over to Misha Black. Ashley's catalogue was printed in sans-serif type, the majority of it lower-case, and the layout echoed the format of Moholy-Nagy 's Bauhausbücher. The cover design combined letters with abstract or stylised shapes symbolising builders' materials: bricks (printed in red), wood (printed in brown), glass and steel. This juxtaposition of geometric and organic form combined with lettering is reminiscent of the publicity and typo- graphic work of Herbert Bayer, for which Ashley had great respect. He in fact owned a water- colour by Bayer, probably bought from the latter 's one-man show at the London Gallery in the spring of 1937, in which letters are used for their concrete and visual effect alone. This water-colour contains the source of a number of those devices which surface in Ashley's painting, commercial work and textile design - in particular, grid-and slat-like shapes, transparent frames or windows, and marine objects. Although he worked for other textile firms such as Campbells and the Old Bleach Linen Co. (for whom he also designed publicity material), Ashley's collaboration with Edinburgh Weavers was the most consistent and arguably the most fruitful. In 1937 his fabrics were shown at the Paris Exhibition, where he designed the Book Section in the British Pavilion (architect Oliver Hill). He saw his designs in very much the same way that Alastair Morton regarded the EW Constructivist range. 'The modern apartment', Ashley wrote in 1938, with its broad simple lines, its large use of glass both for mirrors and windows, its graceful furniture using new principles of construction, giving strength and comfort without bulk - makes an ideal setting for the new fabric and rug designs. These at their best are a visual equivalent in terms of draped materials of the modern paintings and architecture of to-day.'18 For a succinct but accurate assessment of Ashley's achievement in textiles, there can be no improvement on the words of Antony Hunt: 'Whilst still preserving almost abstract forms, Ashley brought a little poetry and colour back into design.
