Porter ^^^^H A Rare kernos Variant from Tell el-Hesi One of the most intriguing cultic vessels found in ancient sanctuaries arid graves is the so-called kernos. Although the term kernos appears in ancient sources, it is not related to the modern object class: in fact, the true ancient name of this special vessel is unknown. Generally of small size, kernoi consist of a clay ring, usually hollow, to which is affixed small vases and ceramic pomegranates, animal figurines, animal heads, or even anthropomorphic elements. The attachments connect with the hollow circular ring by means of small holes on the top of the ring. The kernoi seem to have played a role in fertility rituals and their iconography suggests a symbolic importance. According to ancient Near Eastern and Greek sources, kernoi may represent a microcosmos depicting the earth with plants and animals. The hollow ring, when filled with liquids, suggests a circular subterranean ocean, the source of water for every spring and river, possibly represented by the small vases. Although rare, kernoi are known over a wide geographic area for a very long period of time. The earliest examples appear in Mesopotamia and Syria in the first half of the third millennium B.C.E., and soon after, in Egypt and Cyprus. In the Late Bronze Age, (ca. 1550-1200 B.C.E.) they achieve wide international distribution extending as far as Mycenaean Greece. In ancient Palestine, kernoi are most common in the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age, just as on Cyprus and Greece. In the Aegean and in the western Greek colonies of Southern Italy and Sicily, they continue to be produced until Hellenistic times. During the 1979 excavation season at Tell el-Hesi, located some twenty-three kilometers east of Gaza, a fragmentary kernos of particular interest was found The kernos from Tell el-Hesi.

The object was discovered in a secondary context, but presumably it dates to the Late Bronze or Early Iron Age. This new kernos is typologically interesting. In being fixed on a bowl, it is quite similar to the so-called kernos bowls. On the other hand, the lack of a zoomorphic spout, shaped like an entire animal or animal protome (the upper portion of an animal with muzzle and legs), that protrudes from the vessel's exterior on the bottom of the bowl clearly distinguishes this kernos variant from the kernos bowls. There are no remains of this second animal on the bottom of the Hesi vessel and, therefore, this piece must be considered a kernos in all respects. But this specimen belongs to a rare typological variant of this group. After analysing the fragment and its points of breakage, it is evident that the circular base was not, as was customary, separate, but fixed on the rim of a bowl mounted on another foot. In Byblos, this variant appears for the first time by the end of the Early Bronze Age in a votive deposit of the so-called sacred precinct in the area neighboring the temple of the goddess Baalat Gebal. The nearest typological and chronological parallel for the Hesi kernos is a fragmentary unprovenanced example at the Hecht Museum at Haifa, which was purchased in Jerusalem and can only be dated approximately to the twelfth or eleventh century B.C.E. As with the Hesi The kernos in Haifa (unknown provenience). Courtesy of the Hecht Museum, University of Haifa. vessel, the ring of the kernos is fixed on the rim of a bowl, but in this case the bowl in broken. The attachments, still intact, suggest a possible reconstruction for the Hesi kernos. A small vessel, probably used as a liquid fill hole, may have sat on the opposite side of the ring from the head of the bull, which functioned as a spout, as on the Hecht Museum example. Two pomegranates, one connected with the ring and the other one not, are further elements of the iconography. In addition, the rather fine clay of the Hecht Museum kernos, which shows traces of red color on the pomegranates, is similar to the Hesi piece. This kernos variant, so rare in the Near East, was transmitted to the West probably via the Phoenicians. Two pieces appearing in Punic necropoleis at Mozia in Sicily and at Bithia in Sardinia can be dated to the seventh century B.C.E. These Punic kernoi, whose rings are fixed on bowls with a high foot, show other characteristic attachments for this region: the pouring spout is a head of a ram and the small receptacles are like goblets, a common shape in Punic necropoleis, especially in offering vessels found in the sacrificial area of the so-called tophet. The context at Tell el-Hesi in which the new kernos was found (a disturbed fill) unfortunately does not suggest its function. To discover this, we are obliged to study data from analogous finds. Above all we have to emphasize once more that the typological difference between kernoi and kernos bowls is not accidental, but deliberate and attributable to their different ritual functions. If kernos bowls had been used for libation sacrifices, the liquid poured into them would first have overflowed the rim and only then poured out of the animal shaped spout. Moreover, the second zoomorphic protome, with its muzzle at the bottom of the bowl and in a position clearly reminiscent of drinking, only has a purpose if the recipient, that is the zoomorphic protome attached to the ring, was used as a spout for drinking and not for libations. By sucking at the zoomorphic protome on the ring the liquid in the bowl passed through the muzzle of the protome or animal on the bottom of the bowl.

The contexts of Late Bronze and Early Iron Age kernoi from Cyprus and the Levant, although showing some regional variations, suggest their use in fertility rites, and, more generally, for social prosperity. Therefore liquids of highly symbolic value such as water, wine, oil, milk, honey, or even a mixture of these may have been used. The zoomorphic (sexually powerful animals like bulls, rams, and ibexes) and plant-shaped (pomegranates) iconography of the attachments further emphasize their connection with fertility. Given the intense economic and cultural exchanges between the two regions, these ritual acts must have been transmitted?via Cyprus?to the West, first to the Mycenaean area and later to the western Phoenician colonies and Archaic Greece. On Cyprus, their use in funerary contexts clearly prevails, although one important piece has been found in the courtyard of the ingot god at Enkomi. In the Levant, the contexts vary. Although found primarily in sanctuaries, examples also come from graves, factories, and storerooms containing vital products for the site's economy. These contexts suggest that specific propitiatory rituals may have been performed in these locations. The kernoi are not the only vessels of complex structure that were used in such situations: kernos bowls, animal-shaped rhyta, and askoi with similar iconographie elements sometimes belong to the same find context as kernoi. The Tell el-Hesi kernos is part of the iconographie and ritual tradition of the Late Bronze Age, a tradition that, as far as this vessel type is concerned, was common to the Levantine, Cypriot, and Mycenaean regions. It is not possible to determine with certainty whether their typological affinity implies a similar religious or symbolic meaning. Both vessel types are found in similar cultic contexts, sometimes even together. Their different ritual functions?kernos bowls were used for drinking and kernoi for libations?may well have complemented each other within a single ritual context.
