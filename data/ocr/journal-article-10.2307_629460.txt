<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENTS ON SOME ARCHAIC GREEK INSCRIPTIONS THE following miscellany consists mainly of comments on various archaic inscriptions already published, but also includes four unpublished stones from Crete, observed during a six months' stay in Greece in 1947. Two of these are archaic, the other two considerably later, and therefore added separately at the end. All are listed geographically, under the headings of the relevant volumes of Inscriptiones Graecae or Inscriptiones Creticae; where the inscription discussed is not included in that volume, the heading is bracketed. Grateful acknowledgment is here made to N. Platon, Ephor of Crete and Director of the Candia Museum, for permission to photograph and publish nos. 8-11, and to G. Kotzias, Ephor of Attica, for permission to photograph nos. 1-2. IG J2. Attica. i. IG J2 8o6 (fig. i).

The name Aisimides was fairly common in Attica; cf. Kirchner, Prosopographia Attica, nos. 307-3Io, and Pausanias I, 3, 2. The date appears to be in the first half of the sixth. century. IG IV.

JEFFERY who, arriving at dawn, acted as decoys by ascending to a point about 3 km.

As Chabrias was en route for Cyprus, it was generally concluded that this took place some- where on the north-east or east coast,2 neither the Herakleion nor Tripyrgia being otherwise known. Welter, who rightly observed that this stone must be from the precinct in question, recorded (loc. cit.) for its provenance: ' von der Ostseite der Insel. ... .Nicht ndiher lokali- sierbar, doch wohl an der Nordostseite '. But Keramopoullos in his brief report (loc. cit.) stated that it was brought to the Museum from the coastal area of KfijTrot on the south-east side of the island, south of the small village of BAxXrl8ES. If this is so, reference to Thiersch's detailed map at the end of Aigina I (reproduced by Welter, op. cit., end) suggests that the Herakleion may have lain somewhere on the south-east spurs of the Oros, on the other side of the mountain from the precinct of Zeus Hellenios. Tripyrgia, lying c. 16 stades on the far side of it, would then be located somewhere immediately to the north-west or north-east of the Oros. 3.

It has been pointed out already 3 that Aegina is the provenance for much of the 'Black and White ' Middle Protoattic ware (c. 680-630 B.c.) to which the stand belongs. It is there- fore of interest to note that the dialect and letter-forms used by the painter of the stand 4 indicate that he was himself an Aeginetan. The non-Attic lambda ., which F. von Hiller suggested might mean that the artist was Ionic,5 is a characteristic of the epichoric alphabet of Aegina, and the sigma ? occurs occasionally in Aeginetan, as in Attic, for the more usual form 5.6 This by itself is hardly conclusive, but the form of the name also is not the Attic Msv?AscoS, the Ionic MEsvE'rlos, nor the Homeric MEsvAaxoS, but MEsvcAas, in the Doric dialect which was the native speech of the Aeginetans.7 IG V, i.

Among the many unsolved problems connected with the early wars of Laconia and Messenia, one of the most interesting is that of the hypothetical Messenian revolt at the beginning of the fifth century. The case for its existence s rests, as far as ancient authority is concerned, on statements by Plato,9 Strabo,'o and Pausanias.11 Those of Plato and Strabo, whether correct or not, are reasonably straightforward: that the Spartans were having trouble with the Messenians at the time of the battle of Marathon (Plato), and that there were four, not 2 Hirschfeld, RE I, s.v.'

Pausanias on the contrary involves his evidence by telescoping two different centuries, and sets forth as an historical event the irreconcilable contradiction that in the time of the 28th to 29th Olympiads (668-66o, by the traditional reckon- a ing), at the close of the second Messenian war under the leadership of Aristomenes, the defeated Messenians were offered asylum in Zankle by Anaxilas of Rhegion, whose reign lasted from FIG. 3.-INSCRIPTION ON A PROTOATTIC STAND, CVA c. 494 to 476.

All this is matter that has been well dealt with already; the only reason for repeating it here is that on two other occasions Pausanias gives what may be evidence for this early fifth- century rising, and he gives it in very much the same way; that is, he refers in each case to a Laconian votive offering connected with a revolt of the Messenians, which he himself pro- ceeds to attribute specifically to one or other of the early wars. The first offering was in the temple of Apollo at Amyklai. After narrating the events of the first Messenian war, he describes three bronze tripods there, dedicated by the Lace- daemonians after that war (IV, I4, 2); in III, 18, 5 he describes them in more detail, saying that two were made by Gitiadas and one by Kalon of Aegina, and that they were said to be 'a tithe- offering from the war against the Messenians'. The activity of the bronzeworker Kalon is dated securely c. 500-480 B.C., both by the literary references which couple his work with that of the late archaic artists Hegias of Athens, Ageladas of Argos and Kanachos of Sikyon,12 and by a base bearing his signature on the Acro- polis at Athens, dated c. 500 B.c. by the letter- ing, which came from the 'Perserschutt '.13 The date of Gitiadas is not certain, since the only other reference to his work, also by Pausanias (III, 17, 2), is that he made the temple and image of Athena Chalkioikos at Sparta, which was supposed to have been begun in remote times by Tyndareus and his sons and left incomplete. Dickins believed him to have made the temple in the middle of the sixth century or earlier; 14 C. Robert held that he lived in the middle or second half of the century,15 while Overbeck 16 connected him, from the description of his work, with Bathykles of Magnesia, who is believed to have completed his chief work, FIG. 5.-LACEDAEMONIAN DEDICATION AT OLYMPIA, Olympia V, 252. 12 Overbeck, Schriftquellen, nos. 418-42o; Lippold, RE X, 1757. 13 IG I2 501. 14 BSA XIII 138 ff.; Collignon, Histoire I,; 228f. 15 RE VII, I371 f. 16 Geschichte I4, 71.</page><page sequence="4">28 L. H. JEFFERY the throne of Apollo at Amyklai, at the end of the sixth century." -If this is so, Gitiadas may have been an older contemporary of Kalon. But whatever Gitiadas' true date may be, there remains an undoubted chronological awkwardness with Kalon, which is usually explained in one of two ways: either that the tripods were indeed made to commemorate the first war, as Pausanias says, but over two hundred years after the event, or that the war in question was the famous revolt of 464 B.C., and Kalon's period of activity must therefore be stretched down to fit the date.18 The plain facts, however, suggest that Gitiadas of Sparta (ft. middle to second half of the sixth century?) and Kalon of Aegina (f. c. 500-480) made a set of three tripods, dedicated at Amyklai, which later generations down to Pausanias' time connected with a Messenian war, either by oral tradition or quite possibly because there was an inscription on them recording that they were dedicated &amp;r6 TrWv Mevacrvicov; the inference is that the bronze-workers were commissioned to make the set reasonably soon after the event which it commemorated, and the conclusion from this inference is that the event took place at the end of the sixth or (at latest) the beginning of the fifth century. The second offering mentioned by Pausanias (V, 24, 3) was the bronze Zeus, twelve feet high, dedicated by the Lacedaemonians in the Altis at Olympia, of which half the base, made in Laconian stone,19 still survives (fig. 5). The dedication is still visible, though badly weathered (fig. 6). 2 Pausanias says that the occasion for the dedication was the second Messenian revolt (vi{Kca daTroo-T-rTi ME9oorvIiol S ErTEpaC TrTE Es r6dEPOV KCioya-rEaCav); but since the inscription is obviously later than the seventh century it has been suggested that by the second revolt Pausanias meant the second revolt after the first war, that is, the rising of 464.21 As long ago as 1901, B. Weil observed in a letter to F. von Hiller 22 that the lettering suggested a date c. 490, but no comparative material was quoted. The dating of archaic Laconian inscriptions is still far from certain; but a lower limit can be set by the fragmentary relief of a discus-thrower from the Amyklaion, dated c. 475 by comparison with other reliefs and statuettes of this type.23 The lettering of the relief is better proportioned, and the epsilon with horizontal bars is a later form than that of the Olympia base; but on the other hand the nu of the relief appears to be earlier than those of the base. An upper limit is more easily provided, firstly by the famous Magoula relief in Berlin, dated in the last quarter of the sixth century,24 and secondly by the names written on some of the architectural blocks during the construction of the Apollo throne at Amyklai, near the end of the century.25 Two other inscribed reliefs, the dedications of Pleistiadas to the Dioscuri and of Anaxibios to Athena Chalkioikos, also suggest a date late in the sixth century on stylistic grounds."6 In all these cases the lettering bears a general resemblance to that of the Olympia base, but the forms of nu and epsilon may be slightly earlier. As the nu on the base varies, however, the point can hardly be pressed (fig. 4). Nor is there any inscription on stone which can be securely dated to the mid-fifth century,"2 and thus provide a control for the later dating; though it may be 17 E. A. Lane, BSA XXXIV, 157; E.

Anaxibios: IG V, I, 215; Langlotz, op. cit., 86 and 94. I find it hard to accept Langlotz' dates for either (c. 56o and beginning of the sixth century, respectively). The Anaxibios relief was dated in the second half of the sixth century by its discoverer Dickins (BSA XIV, 145), the Pleistiadas in the early fifth century by Wace (Cat., 178). 27 The evidence for dating IG V, I, 721 c. 457 B.C. is the reading [Tav]aypca in the last line, which caused the editors to restore it as a grave-epigram after the battle of Tanagra. If this restoration is correct, it will be significant for the dating of the Olympia base that its letters are undoubtedly considerably earlier than those of the epigram, although the latter is written boustrophedon; cf. IG V, I, Plate II. The latter photograph suggests, however, that the gamma in the last line is far from certain, and the alterna- tive reading -atpal cannot be excluded; and since an epigram of this type has no parallel among the other fifth- century military epitaphs of Laconia, I think that the identification is too doubtful to be of any help in dating.</page><page sequence="5">COMMENTS ON SOME ARCHAIC GREEK INSCRIPTIONS 29 FIG. 6.-LACEDAEMONIAN DEDICATION AT OLYMPIA, Olympia V, 252.

JEFFERY tentatively remarked that the use of tailed epsilon and upsilon K appears somewhat archaic, even in conservative Laconia, for the time of the Helot Revolt; the forms on the stele of Damonon 28 in the third quarter of the century are the standard forms E and Y. In conclusion, therefore, the evidence indicates that the date can hardly be earlier than the last years of the sixth century, and other inscriptions of that period give some support for a date c. 500-490; but the lower dating c. 464-452 cannot be definitely ruled out on epigraphical grounds, for lack of comparative material. There is, however, a further point which may be relevant. The circular base, I'27 m. in diameter and 0-78 m. high, is hollow throughout like the joint of a pipe, with a rim o0 19 m. wide between the outer edge and the inner; the inner walls of the hole are smoothed, except for a rough band 0-36 m. high and 0o24 m. from the top (visible in fig. 5). It is suggested in the commentary to Olympia V, 252 that there was originally a smaller circular base inserted here (the diameter being c. o089 m.), on which the statue itself stood; but it is hard to see the reason for two bases here, if the outer is merely a rim round the inner, and even harder to see why a hole was pierced right through the outer, instead of a socket.29 It may be noted also that an early fifth-century bronze statue on the Acropolis at Athens, not over life-size according to the cuttings for the tenons under the feet, had a circular base o.91 m. in diameter,30 so that an anthropomorphic Zeus twelve feet high would look, by this standard, distinctly top-heavy on a base whose diameter is only 0-36 m. wider. It is therefore suggested that the statue of Zeus may have been of the same type as the Apollo of Amyklai, a human head and arms surmounting a circular core sheathed in bronze, the lower end of which was inserted directly into the hollow base prepared for it in the sculptor's workshop in Laconia, and the whole monument thus dispatched to Olympia for erection. If this should be so, it would be a further point in favour of the earlier date; it is conceivable that a bronze sculptor working for the Lacedaemonians might still have used this archaic model for a large-scale work c. 500-490, but unlikely that it would have been used as late as c. 460.31 IG V, 2. Arcadia. 5. Bronze pinax from Arcadia (now in the collection of Professor D. M. Robinson), dealing with rules and penalties in the ritual of Demeter Thesmophoros. D. M. Robinson, Class. Philol. XXXVIII (I943), I91 f.; L. Robert, REG LVII (i944), 2Io f.; A. J. Beattie, Cl. Qu. XLI (1947), 66 ff. The pinax shows the interesting peculiarity of a three-stroke crooked iota, instead of the straight type normal in Arcadian; the rest of the alphabet is the ordinary Arcadian epichoric. Professor Robinson notes in his commentary op. cit., p. 191: 'According to the dealer, the tablet was said by some to have been brought to Kalavryta from the site of Kleitor (5 hours away), but according to others it came from Lykosoura'; he himself inclines to the belief that it came from somewhere near Kleitor or Lousoi. This conclusion is confirmed by the only other case so far attested of a crooked iota in the Arcadian alphabet, the inscription on the lip of a bronze lebes-fragment said to have been found in the Kalavryta area, which was probably dedicated in the sanctuary of Artemis at Lousoi.32 The three-stroke iota is one of the hallmarks of the Achaean alphabet, and it may well have happened that in the northernmost part of Arcadia near the Achaean border the Achaean iota was used in the local alphabet until it was displaced at some time in the fifth century by the standard straight type. This would definitely exclude Lykosoura as the provenance of the pinax, since it would be hard to account for the appearance of a crooked iota in southern Arcadia. If it comes from near the Achaean 28'IG V, I, 213. 29 Curtius suggested in the original publication (AZ XXXIV, 49) that this hollowing out was done to make the transport easier. 30 IG I2 532. 31 Other Laconian examples of this pillar type of statue are the Athena Chalkioikos (Frazer, Paus.

IG VII. Megara. 6. Bronze statuette of Herakles, early fifth-century, now in the Benaki Museum. Inscription on left leg: HEpCoaCS (fig. 8). H. G. G. Payne, JHS LIV (I934), 163 ff., P1. VII; C. Picard, Manuel II, I (I939), i6o f., fig. 74; M. Lejeune, REA XLVII (I945), 105. In his brilliant analysis of the statuette as a work of art, Payne assigned it to a North-east Peloponnesian school, which might be tentatively identified as Argive, or less closely as Argivo-Corinthian. Of the inscription he observed (a) that it appears to be in the Corinthian alphabet, and is more likely to have been inscribed by the sculptor than the dedicator, (b) that the omission of A is an error, but the use of E = E in the sixth letter, though abnormal for Corinthian, could be paralleled in a few other Corinthian inscriptions, and (c) that the nominative ending -c'as occurs in Central and West Greek dialects, but has not been hitherto attested in Corinthian. The most noticeable letter-form in the inscription is the triangular rho. With this may be compared the two early fifth-century inscriptions from Megara published in AM XXXI, (1906) pp. 89 ff., P1. XI, and LIX (1934), 52 if., no. io, where the identical form is used. Lejeune has already pointed out (loc. cit.) that the use of B -E and 1r by no means confines the inscription to Corinth, since several other States in the neighbourhood, including Megara, also used it. In addition, the alphas here are both written A, that is A when left to right, a reversal which may be observed fairly consistently in other Megarian epichoric inscriptions.35 By itself this point would be worth little, since the reversal might be due to carelessness, but taken in conjunction with the epsilon and rho it provides additional support for a Megarian origin. Finally, all the known examples of Megarian epichoric script show for sigma the form 5, whereas Corinth was still using M in the first quarter of the fifth century.36 Admittedly, the sigma on the Benaki statuette is I not 5, but the forms are interchangeable, and at this point there was hardly room on the bronze for the fourth stroke. 33 Professor Robinson notes a sanctuary of Demeter at Kleitor mentioned by Pausanias VIII, 21, 3 (op. cit., 191); but Pausanias, usually careful in adding cult epithets, gives her none in this instance. 34 Cf. IG V, 2, 360. A good example of the uncertain boundary between N. Arcadia and Achaea is the case of Tritoia, Paus. VI, I2, 8-9. 35 Roehl, Imag3., 52, 1-2 and 54, 4- 36 IG 12 92-7.</page><page sequence="8">32 L. H. JEFFERY As for the dialect, the unique nominative form 'HpaK?cas has analogies for the -c'as ending in both Corinthian and Megarian.37 It was cut by someone who could use a bronze-worker's chisel, which may point to the artist himself; but there is no surviving tradition of a Megarian school of bronze-workers, and Payne has made out an excellent case for an Argivo-Corinthian origin on grounds of style. It is possible that the officials of the sanctuary where it was offered had the inscription cut by a local artisan. Was the statuette then dedicated in a sanctuary somewhere in the Megarid ? It has often been observed as a curious fact that there is no record of a cult of Herakles at Megara,38 and yet the cult was widespread in her colonies, and Plutarch narrates 39 that when Alexander was granted citizenship by the people of Megara and showed some amusement at their evident notion of this as a supreme honour, he was informed that, of all non-Megarians, only Herakles had ever been granted citizenship before. The tomb of Alkmene was also claimed to be in FIG. IO.-PART OF A LEGAL CODE, Axos. FIG. I I.-PART OF A LEGAL CODE, Axos. Megarian territory.40 The only other evidence is a Hellenistic inscription which mentions a Herakleion at Aigosthena,41 and another of Roman date from Pegai,42 referring to a statue of Herakles there, possibly illustrated on late coins of the town.43 On this point, as on many others, there is a wide gap in the known early history of Megara; perhaps in the Benaki statuette we have one small stone to fill the breach. IG XIV. Siris (Herakleia). 7. The origin of the colonists who founded Siris has long been a matter of dispute.

Ia; Megarian, SGDI IV, 3, P. 339. The use of the nominative is awkward here, since the labelling of a deity with his name is as alien to sculpture as it is common in vase-painting. A genitive for ownership is what one would expect; can this possibly be another example of the genitive ending in -kas for masculine a-stem nouns, doubtfully attested in Megarian? (Buck, Gk. Dial2. 81, 105, 2b; Hoffmann, SGDI IV, 3, PP. 344 f.) 38 Highbarger, History of Ancient Megara (1927), 65 and note 246; Hanell, Megarische Studien (1934), 30 and 202 f. a39 Tpi IpovapxiaS, 826c. 40 Paus.

Perret in his detailed study of the colony.49 On the other side, the literary tradition has been supported by many scholars.50 To their arguments may be added the following piece of epigraphical evidence, which does not seem to have been used in any discussions of the problem. The site of Herakleia is generally located in the modern district cf Policoro between the rivers Agri (Akiris) and Sinni (Siris), and Siris is believed to have been about 41 km. south of Herakleia, on the left bank of the Siris; 51 but, as Perret has observed,52 though traces of the acropolis may have been preserved in some tufa foundations on the north side, the town site must have been obliterated by the changing course of the river, and there is little hope of anything but chance finds to illustrate its history. One such minor find (fig. 9) was in fact published in 1912 by P. Orsi.53 It is a loomweight of archaic shape, inscribed with the name of its owner, 'lIco8iKrq ip; and the alphabet and dialect are clearly Ionic, with the closed form of eta which forbids a date much (if at all) later than the middle of the sixth century. The clay is not described, but at this date a loomweight painted with the owner's name can hardly have been an import; common sense would suggest that it must be local.54 It is admittedly only a single clue; but it does indicate that there was some settlement in this area in the sixth century which, using the Ionic dialect and script, must itself be of Ionic origin; which is exactly what the literary tradition records of Siris. The strongest argument for her Achaean origin is that based on the joint Siris-Pyxous coinage, with its Achaean alphabet and type; but it proves only that at some period after c. 550 B.C., the date suggested for the earliest examples, the city was inhabited by Achaeans. We are thus brought back to the conclusion that she was indeed defeated by an Achaean coalition in the sixth century, and continued to exist after her defeat, under the same name but with an Achaean population settled there by one or all of her conquerors.55 That she was in fact inhabited in the fifth century before the foundation of Herakleia may perhaps be inferred from the reference of Herodotus; 56 it is certainly confirmed by Diodorus.57 45 Strabo VI, 264; Schol. ad Lycophronem; Alexandra, 978, 984; Aristotle and Timaeus ap. Athenaeum XII, 523c. It is the latter reference which calls them specifically Colophonians. 46 Schol. ad Lyc., loc. cit.; Justin XX, 2, I-Io. The date-limits for this war are suggested as c. 550-520 (Philipp, loc. cit.), c. 535-530 (Berard, op. cit., 206), or c. 550-540 (Dunbabin, op. cit., 360). 4' Strabo VI, 264; Diod. Sic.

He maintains (206 ff.) that some early traders settled there (termed 'Ionians' for general rather than ethnic reasons), were dispossessed at the end of the eighth or the beginning of the seventh century B.C. by Achaean colonists and that this was the war referred to by the literary authorities (note 46 above); thus Siris, populated by Achaeans, had no reverses until her power waned after the fall of Sybaris in 5I0. 50 Pais, Italia Antica II, 43 ff.; Ciaceri, Storia della Magna Graecia I2, 127 ff.; Bilabel, Die Ionische Kolonisation, 206 ff.; J.

The only traces found were some tufa blocks from a horseshoe-shaped building or buildings, and some Hellenistic tombs.

Themistocles is here made to refer to Siris as a town, (' is piv T-rv iv 'larc FT '), not merely as an area; there is no need to assume that she must have been uninhabited when the Athenians thus proposed to get possession on the grounds of their Ionic ancestry.

Two fragments of stone inscribed boustrophedon were found in 1947 58 in the possession of householders in the modern village of Axos, which lies immediately below the archaic acropolis. The owners stated in both cases that they came from the acropolis, but could give no details of the precise spot where they were found. (a) (fig. Io). Fragment of hard, dark grey limestone, broken on all sides and at back. Max. width 0o25 m., height 0.26 m., thickness 0-035 m. Letter-height oooI5-0.02 m.; the circular letters with a central dot, apparently made by a cutting compass; all the letters neatly cut, but very shallow. (b) (figs. I I, 12). Left lower corner of a block of similar limestone, broken at top and right side; the left side, back and bottom are preserved. Max. width o019 m., height 0-30 m., thickness 0-093 m. Letters as on (a). The left side is smoothly finished with vertical chisel-strokes, the bottom more roughly picked, the back fairly smoothly dressed, the strokes following the natural ' grain ' of the stone where it was split off originally. On examination it was found that the bottom of (a) joined the top of (b), giving a combined height of 0-56 m. (figs. 13, 14). The break was old, for a lime-white accretion had formed on the underside of (a); it had also covered the inscribed face in patches, and had been partly scraped off by the owner.

If the restoration is correct, it is the only reference so far known to the version of the calendar in use at Axos, and shows that here the uncontracted form of the Doric was used. For the calendars of other Cretan cities, cf. M. Guarducci, IC I, p. 154 and Epigraphica VII (I945), 72 ff.; van Effenterre, BCH LXX (1946), 59 ff. The text clearly formed part of a legal code, and apparently concerned artificers (FEpyacrcTai); a fine (?) of 30 or 40 staters is also mentioned, and the chief magistrate (6 Tr6Kc KoUMcOv). The surviving part of the main code of Axos (IC II, v, nos. 1-7, I1) deals with the privileges accorded to certain technicians working for the city (no. I), with occasional references to Fipyov (nos. 2, L. 9, and 4, L. 5) and FEpyd E[oG01 (no. 3, L. 4); cf. also a similar fragment from Gortyn, SGDI, 4984. The main code is inscribed in letters o-o7-0oo9 m. high on great flat slabs from the wall of the upper of the two temples on the acropolis. The new fragment cannot belong to these, as its letters are only one quarter as large. The careful smoothing of its left side suggests that it was meant to show, while the closeness of the last line to the bottom edge means that it can hardly have been a stele. It may come from the corner of one of the walls of the lower temple on the east slope of the hill.59 The letter-forms are like those of the main code; in addition to the regular Cretan forms 5 = ' , $ (or S) = i, M - a, and I for punctuation, there is the characteristic Axian digamma /X, used also by Eleutherna to the west and Prinias to the south; 60 the sharply-angled iota and absence of qoppa are also features of both the main code and the new fragment. Probably the same stonemason carried out both commissions. The date may be the end of the sixth or the beginning of the fifth century. IC I, viii. Knossos. 9. In 1935, part of a limestone block bearing the remains of an inscription was dug up immediately south of the Villa Ariadne vineyard, in the small plot of ground outside the gateway which leads past the guardian's house up to the Palace. Two fragments of reliefs in similar stone, dated tentatively in the late seventh and early sixth centuries, were also found in the same vineyard area.61 The inscription is published here, scanty though it is, as an adden- dum to the only other certainly archaic fragment as yet recorded from the vicinity of the Palace, a rectangular block containing three lines from a legal code, found in a house in the adjoining village of Makrytichos.62 Candia Museum no. 260 (fig. 15).

The lambda is not the N type used in most parts of Crete, but the so- called Chalcidic ,, whose use in Crete has so far been attested only at Eltynia and Dreros.63 The eta is the unusual form 14 with tilted crossbars, also used at Dreros side by side with the more normal form E.64 In the same way, the E was also used at Knossos, as the Makrytichos fragment shows. These similarities may, however, be fortuitous; it would be intriguing but rash to draw from them the conclusion that there were any particular bonds between sixth-century Knossos and Dreros, as the famous Dreros oath testifies for the third century.65 The Makrytichos fragment from its dimensions is plainly a wall-block, and so almost certainly is the new piece. They may well be from the same inscription, as the size of the letters is the same in each case; if this is so, the unusually wide spacing between the lines of the new piece suggests that it came from somewhere near the end of the inscription, when the FIG.
