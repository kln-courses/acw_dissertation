<plain_text><page sequence="1">Another Look at Charles M. Skinner JOHN BEALLE What, then, are we? But be calm. Nature is so. Be at one with it. In the multitude of lights out there, not one falters or hastens, seldom does one brighten or grow dull: therefore, know that we are sheltered and saved by law; that we are parts of an infinite order; and we dream that somewhere in the universe, whose sun-clouds roll about the throne of it, dwells Mind. "On the Roof" (1897c) Why does this melancholy pertain to us, free, prospering Americans? Is progress too swift for us? Are our political burdens too heavy? Cannot those who reach civilization live through it? Can we not cut loose from our social austerities and be ourselves? "The Gates of the Hudson" (1906a) Much attention has recently been given to the role of American folklore as a rhetorical device for the representation or construction of national, regional, or ethnic culture (e.g., Whisnant 1983; Becker and Franco 1988). As such a device, concepts associated with folklore can serve the ideological interests of large groups of people, and by doing so can achieve widespread popularity. By considering folklore specifically as a component of American culture, this direction of study locates folklore within larger taxonomies and thus expands the field of American folklore as conceived by Dorson (1959, 1969) and Dundes (1966). Viewing folklore as a rhetorical device brings new significance to efforts normally excluded from scholarly concern by placing all representations of folklore within a larger American cultural context (Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1988; Hirsch 1987). Western Folklore 53 (April, 1994): 99-123 99</page><page sequence="2">100 WESTERN FOLKLORE The task of this article is to reconsider the ideological significance of the work of Charles M. Skinner (1852-1907), best known for his publication in 1896 of Myths and Legends of Our Own Land. It was the first work of its kind-a comprehensive, regionally organized text collection of national scope which presented a folklore genre to the American public. The two-volume book was vigorously promoted by its publisher (Lippincott), who placed it at the top of its lists of current publications; it was an immediate success, requiring five editions in its debut year.' Although Skinner had not previously published folklore- related works, he followed this work with Myths and Legends Beyond Our Borders (1898), Myths and Legends of Our New Possessions and Pro- tectorates (1900), American Myths and Legends (1903), and Myths and Legends of Flowers, Trees, Fruits, and Plants, in All Ages and in All Climes (posthumously, 1911). Skinner's work returned to folklorists' attention in the paper by Richard Dorson at the 1969 UCLA Conference on American Folk Legend, "How Shall We Rewrite Charles M. Skinner Today?" (Dor- son 1971b). Following the conference mandate, Dorson measured Skinner against contemporary legend methodology and found, as might be expected of someone he could call "frankly the popularizer," much to be desired. For example, Skinner drew from a wide variety of sources, yet identified none of them specifically. Dorson conceded that Skinner "knew his public and gave them what they wanted." He also credited Skinner with having a reasonable grasp of what a legend was and admitted that although Skinner had no overt theory, he had "a fair idea what he was up to" (1971b:69-70). I hope to demonstrate here that since Dorson based his assessment only on Skinner's texts and short prefaces, however, "what he was up to" largely eluded Dorson. Skinner had specific philosophical ambitions which he ad- vanced by exploiting specific features of folklore. Moreover, Skinner operated outside of the prevailing doctrines which at the time guided the use of folklore (Bronner 1986:1-38; Zumwalt 1988). Skinner was never a member of the American Folk- lore Society nor any of its local chapters, and demonstrated only a remote awareness of even the most general principles of Boasian 1. Subsequent editions were in 1902, 1924, 1969. Advertising was in The Dial, where Lippincott regularly announced its new offerings. Information on editions is from the National Union Catalog: Pre-1956 Imprints. Since this information is collected from libraries and not from publishers, it would tend, if inaccurate, to underrepresent actual publication data.</page><page sequence="3">ANOTHER LOOK AT CHARLES M. SKINNER 101 cultural pluralism. His widely popular myth and legend collections were never mentioned or reviewed in the Journal of American Folklore; his only contribution to the Journal was a single Canadian legend text published in 1906. Skinner espoused some degree of anti- industrialism, yet there is no evidence that he read Morris, Ruskin, or Carlyle, or felt the influence of the settlement house cultural pro- gramming which closely followed their ideas (Evans 1982, 1988). He was not influenced by the pluralist playground movement (Melvin 1983), nor, as when they later published resource lists which included legend material for storytelling, were they influenced by him (Han- mer and Knight 1914; Williams 1927). In the tenor of his writing, there is no discernible attention to folkloristic method at any point in his career. Though he appears aware of the basic taxonomies, it seems clear that Skinner never pretended to be a folklorist as the field was then defined. Thus the source of his extraordinary interest in the subject matter must be sought elsewhere. During the period of his folklore collections, Skinner also pub- lished articles in popular magazines on widely diverse topics. These disparate publications reveal principles which guided his interest in folklore. Most prominently, he displayed a broad familiarity with and a personal admiration for New England transcendentalism. Whereas this inheritance is most evident in his writings on nature, he also struggles to bring transcendentalist thought to bear on issues of pop- ular concern. Guided by the principle that one should look in every- day life for the various means to carry out life's unitary purpose, Skinner had to find such means in the fast-changing world of turn- of-the-century Brooklyn (Burke 1966:9). This search meant contend- ing not merely with dramatic social and technological change, but also with the moral climate which helped produce that change. Nature as he envisioned it was being steadily eroded by urbanization, so Skinner sought other sources for the kind of ontological affirmation he be- lieved was central to human life. One such source was folklore. It was this fairly specific set of concerns that Skinner brought to the subject and which this paper seeks to assess. SKINNER'S LIFE Biographical information on Skinner is supplied in part by his younger brother Otis Skinner (1858-1942) and his niece Cornelia</page><page sequence="4">102 WESTERN FOLKLORE Otis Skinner (1901-1971), both of whom had illustrious and lengthy careers in the theatre and wrote autobiographies (Otis Skinner 1924; Cornelia Otis Skinner 1948). Each depicts father Charles A. Skinner, a Universalist minister of "granite-faced New England stock," as aus- tere and overbearing, and his wife as demure and easy-going. Yet Charles A. was an extension of a larger family ethos which would produce four Universalist clergymen over four generations -Charles M.'s grandfather Warren, his uncle Dolphus, and his son Clarence. Clarence, a tireless social reformer, was recognized as a primary au- thor of the Universalist "Social Gospel" of the early twentieth century (Miller 1985:493-509). As Cornelia would conclude of the family a century later: the Skinners were exceedingly patrifocal and imposed an oppressive sense of duty on their male youth. From so inauspicious a beginning, all three boys-Charles M., Otis, and William-pursued artistic careers, each demanding some measure of family adjustment. A fourth child, a daughter, died in infancy. The eldest of the boys, Charles Montgomery Skinner was born in 1852 in Victor, N.Y.; a year later the family moved to Cambridge where he spent the better part of his youth. His father's ministerial salary provided modest domestic comfort but little extravagance. Otis nevertheless recalls Cambridge happily, particularly family outings across the Charles River to the Boston Museum, a "dignified place of amusement ... exempt from Puritan prejudice," whose theatre/ lecture-hall "ministers of the gospel could freely patronize" (Otis Skinner 1924:13, 16). Equally memorable was the makeshift theatre in the family's cellar kitchen where Charles would produce plays and scenes which he had written and directed. When Charles was fourteen, the family moved to a "less rigid" Hartford, Connecticut, where, as before, he attended common schools.2 He continued to write poetry, stories, and drama, and to produce plays with other children. He inspired increasing admiration from Otis, whom he advised on the mysteries of nature, the merits of literary works, and the meaning of painting and music. Recalling one of his dramatic fantasies, carried to excess, in which Charles led two playmates to the recruiting office to enlist in the Union Army, Otis 2. Cornelia is thoroughly contradicted in her recollection that the move to Hartford did not include Charles.</page><page sequence="5">ANOTHER LOOK AT CHARLES M. SKINNER 103 would later proclaim, "my brother was my hero." Apparently in spite of such exploits, Otis viewed the boys' childhood as clearly circum- scribed by parental modesty. Reflecting on his upbringing on the evening prior to his acting debut, he could attribute his emergence as an actor only to the Skinners' "infinite righteousness." Charles married Ada Blanchard at age twenty-four and later moved his family to New York to pursue a writing career. There is no evidence of publication before 1881 when he took a position as writer for the Brooklyn Times, covering "police reports, street accidents, and hospital cases" (Otis Skinner 1924:22). During this year, he sum- moned Otis to visit, and together they toured Manhattan, securing at least a glimpse of those sites associated with the "dazzling elite" (Otis Skinner 1924:52-54). Most memorable, however, was their atten- dance of a performance at the Lyceum Theatre of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, an event to which Otis attributes the discovery of his life's work. Without discounting the theatrical bias of these accounts, we can conclude that the brothers surmounted cultural limitations with- in the family and that of the three, Charles gained some admiration for his resourcefulness. Otis' assessment of him would seem to lend credence to the view advanced here that his work had an air of independence to it. In 1884, Skinner took a position on the editorial staff of the Brook- lyn Daily Eagle. His tenure at the Eagle coincides approximately with that of editor St. Clair McKelway who in 1886 took command of a paper staffed by "boisterous, hard-drinking, self-taught, men who saw the newspaper business as a 'man's game'," civilized it, and led it through a period of prosperity and influence unmatched in its history (Schroth 1974:97-112; Schroth 1979:106-9). This must have come as a relief to Skinner, who under the previous regime would have endured a staff which once "dangled a fellow reporter, a clergyman's son, out the third-floor window by his feet and made him yell obscen- ities at homecomers at the Fulton Ferry" (Schroth 1979:106). Appar- ently Skinner prospered under McKelway. He was assigned "special subjects" and began writing and lecturing on matters even of inter- national scope. In 1890, he began contributing articles of widely varying subjects to popular American periodicals. In addition to reg- ular coverage of art and drama, he wrote on music, prison methods, labor conditions, communes, and natural disasters. In 1902 he rep- resented the Eagle on the relief expedition to Martinique following</page><page sequence="6">104 WESTERN FOLKLORE the eruption of Mt. Pelke. In 1906 he was stricken with cancer and died the following year at age fifty-five. NATURE, GEOGRAPHY, AND LOCALITY Skinner's writings in popular periodicals parallel his folklore pub- lications and betray an orientation to American folklore not evident in his myth and legend volumes alone. Rather, these popular writings were the format in which he struggled to bring transcendental prin- ciples to bear on contemporary American life. Frequent (though never precise) references to Thoreau, Emerson, Whitman, Abbott, and Longfellow suggest a comprehensive and self-motivated expo- sure to their works well beyond his common school education. His style, interests, and philosophy are similar to later transcendentalist John Burroughs (1837-1921), whom he admired and cites on occa- sion. Although this influence is most clearly seen in the character of his writing, there is also biographical evidence to suggest it. The pro- found Universalist tradition in his family, particularly as practiced in Cambridge, would have provided him an early exposure to transcen- dental ideas.3 More striking, however, was the circumstantial relation- ship Skinner developed with Walt Whitman through his assignments on two newspapers which Whitman had previously edited. Whitman edited the Brooklyn Daily Eagle from 1846 to 1847; Skinner was a special topics editor for the paper from 1884 until the early 1900s. Whitman edited the Brooklyn Times from 1857 to 1859; Skinner wrote for the paper from 1881 to 1884. That Skinner believes this significant is evident from his retrospec- tive of Whitman's tenure on the two newspapers, "Walt Whitman as an Editor" (Skinner:1903c).4 Skinner makes much of a single ex- change of correspondence with Whitman in which he inquires re- garding the circumstances of Whitman's controversial resignation from the Times in 1859. Later authorities have concluded that Skin- ner's explanation of the departure is "a trifle more explicit" than his sources provide (Holloway 1932:13-15). He also begins the account 3. Although the religious foundation of transcendentalism was supplied more substantially by other denominations-particularly Unitarianism--for a time during the 1820s, primarily for its humanism and rationalism, Universalism provided a hospitable environment (see Rose 1981:14- 15, 44-45). In any case, Skinner considered it a liberal church (1896:11, 139-40). 4. In the interest of brevity, references to Charles M. Skinner will be designated by "Skinner"; references to other Skinner family members will include given names.</page><page sequence="7">ANOTHER LOOK AT CHARLES M. SKINNER 105 with an arresting scene: in the office of the Brooklyn Times, he writes, there was once a first edition copy of Leaves of Grass. "A scamp" has stolen it, and all that remains of the poet are memories. In the wake of this bit of tragic irony, Skinner proceeds to recount and discuss Whitman's views on a variety of matters-social reform, nature, sla- very, phrenology, church architecture, politics and demagoguery- matters to which they both, as representatives of the same newspa- pers, might have been exposed. By consequence of his evidently singular concern at the papers, he thus positions himself as an heir to Whitman's thinking, yet in its giant shadow as well. These circumstances place unfortunate limits on Skinner's creati- vity-in his contributions to popular magazines his role is primarily to comment on contemporary life. Taken in this light, his folklore works are refreshingly innovative. Nevertheless, he maintains a consistent adherence to transcendentalist principles on an extraordinarily di- verse array of topics, primarily through a pervasive and sometimes meticulous attention to the redemptive potential of nature. Some- times this view of nature appears shamelessly anthropomorphic, as in his discourse on animals: It is well to have [animals] about us. We can go to them now and then for lessons-lessons in calm, in content, in the art of living in the present, in simplicity, in truth, in health, in strength, most of all in modesty-for we cannot see, without admiring, their many economies and shifts, their skill and ingenuity, their self-sufficing gifts; and seeing these, we ought to understand that we have not yet come to the high top of power or mind or morals. [1898a:66] Dogs, he says, "have a quick instinct as to character, and know who are friends and who otherwise" (1898a:67), and the crab, "isn't he like a human being?" (1898a:69). Behind these observations is the view that objective knowledge is limited or, perhaps, irrelevant. Animals are for Skinner vehicles by which he can deliberately assess the territory of human subjectivity. For instance, he writes the following of mud-wasps: Here, at a little hostelry, where shoremen put in for beer and sand- wiches, we find four or five rowdies from the city actually forgetting their drink, their obscenity, and their oaths, such an interest has been aroused in them by the discovery of mud-wasps who are building houses under the veranda roof, just over their heads. [Skinner 1898a:69]</page><page sequence="8">106 WESTERN FOLKLORE Skinner's nature is obscured by the complexities of contemporary life, yet it nevertheless retains its transcendental promise. In the city, one must look more closely, even sharpen one's senses, to achieve tran- scendence. The city holds further potential, since association with one's fellows is as much a part of nature as are other species. The country and the city are radically different human environments, always working sub- jectively against one another, so that one is never completely at peace in either. In their extremes, the country-the unsettled West-is too isolating (Skinner 1903b:580), the city too confining. Reviewers seize upon this dichotomy as a basic premise of his writing (Anonymous Reviews 1897a:321, 1897b:525, 1900:493). Skinner urges city dwell- ers to position themselves between society and nature. Referring to the title of his essay on city life, Flowers in the Pave, Skinner pleads that "grass growing on a patch of undisturbed pave, or darkness resting on it, is a blanket of peace" (1897a:620). Elsewhere he proclaims, "Everybody whose house has a flat roof can escape from town" (1897c: 130). The city is an environment which provides opportunities for encounters with nature, yet at the same time obscures nature from all but the vigilant. Skinner is intrigued by the relative prosperity of various species in the two environments. For example, insects thrive in the city-and thus provide excellent vehicles for developing one's powers of observation-due to the lamentable disappearance of birds of prey (Skinner 1897e:793). More perplexing is the house sparrow, or En- glish sparrow. Introduced artificially into the United States in Brook- lyn in 1850, this species had become demonstrably populous and urban by the turn-of-the-century when Skinner was writing. Naturally Skinner urges citizens to pay it serious heed, but much of his discus- sion of the sparrow is facetious. The sparrow is an "immigrant," com- monly considered noisy, quarrelsome, and greedy. Surely he must have learned his voice and his vices from the needless quarreling of civilized people "an octave above the pleasant" (Skinner 1901:552). Skinner even computes that the "unspeakable scamp" screams, "Skreekle," 99,120 times a day. Though there is a sense that Skinner has shifted the locus of nature from the (non-human) species to the way any species associates within its environment, it seems also likely that he has simply lost his resolve to the cause of a bit of humor. In any case it is very much the character of his writing to give the ap- pearance that he has momentarily lost control of his thoughts.</page><page sequence="9">ANOTHER LOOK AT CHARLES M. SKINNER 107 Skinner's view of geography is related to this pivotal tie between human subjectivity and nature. Topographical features impose upon human consciousness, thus localities are without question Skinner's most significant geographical category since they represent nature directly confronted. Nations, and less so regions, are places, but they do not (or should not) mediate observation. Cultural pluralism, in the sense that behavior is self-evident because it is a part of, for example, regional, national, or ethnic culture, is not a part of Skinner's thought. Dorson is particularly critical on this point, noting that Skinner's "urge to localize" led him to exclude a wealth of regional folk material to which he should have had access (1971b:71). For Skinner, this choice is deliberate and is designed to advance a personal engagement with the natural environment. In one of his earliest popular articles (1890), Skinner describes Greenland, first through its physical geography, including climate and natural resources, and then in terms of ways the people-the Eskimos, the Danes, and various shipping and trading peoples- relate to that environment and to one another. Greenland's Eskimos, for instance, are notably peaceable, have thriving churches and schools, but are being ravaged by disease. Yet these are sociological observations, representing conditions of living rather than racial or cultural attributes. Insofar as groups of people have ontological char- acteristics, they do so only by virtue of their habitual encounter with circumstances. Thus Eskimos are good-natured in part because the government of the Danes, who protect them as their wards, "though selfish, is enlightened and kindly" (1890:205). Again, Skinner is less concerned with their status as "traditional" people or "folk" (words he rarely uses) than he is with their relationships. As is somewhat evident in his exposition on Greenland, Skinner's point of view in his writings is frequently that of a traveler. Often, his purpose in writing is to encourage others to travel. Describing Green- land, he writes of its nearness to the U.S. and hopes for increased accessibility by commercial sea vessels (Skinner 1890:206). He also encourages walking, and offers practical advice for meeting interest- ing people (Skinner 1897f). Cultivating backyard gardens in the city is partly meant to relieve the urge and necessity for going to the country. Thus his descriptions of exotic places are not meant to bring the world into the home, as was the common practice of his day. He even disdains photography-again, not an entirely popular stance for his time (see Orvell 1989)-and uses it judiciously in his publications</page><page sequence="10">108 WESTERN FOLKLORE (Skinner 1897f; Skinner 1907:CXI). Travel, as Skinner's writing de- picts it, entails quintessential freedom--breaking the bonds of civili- zation and being in position to create ties with nature and strangers anew. Land or "environment" (a word Skinner does use) is the crucial determinant of consciousness. Yet as humans we are at all times re- sponsible for the way we use land just as we are for the way we see landscape. Both prosperity (what we get from the land) and con- sciousness (how we experience it) are the result of this dialectic. No- where is this more apparent than in his discussion, in one of his last publications before his death, of the Palisades near the mouth of the Hudson River. Standing both physically and spiritually adjacent to Manhattan, the Palisades, visually, is "a focus in the landscape, a sym- bol of the steadfast and aspiring in the national spirit" (Skinner 1906a:665-66). To explore the Palisades by foot one "must jump, slide, wade and scramble"-thus through this normally solitary en- counter with the unrelenting power of the landscape, one experiences genuine humility. Yet consciousness is not merely passive. Skinner objects to those who would have the Palisades as a public park on the grounds that reclamation for public use would render impossible the very experi- ence from which he gains spiritual reward. Let us pray that they be left in their savage beauty; that they be not pranked with stairs and fences, revetted, foregrounded with lawns, flower beds, statuary and rustic benches imitated in cast iron. [Skinner 1906a:665] This is frankly a doctrine of authenticity; perhaps it is useful to offer for comparison a second case in which natural conditions are violated by artificiality--the training of animals to act as humans:5 Trained animals show remarkably what men can make them do, but artifice is seldom so interesting as nature, and it is in their true char- acters, rather than as clumsy imitators of other species, that they de- serve our notice best. [Skinner 1898a:66] 5. Skinner's father was an acquaintance of P. T. Barnum, who was an active Boston area Uni- versalist during his ministerial tenure there. Indeed, Otis Skinner opens his autobiography with the text of a letter of introduction from Barnum which he considered as pivotal in his securing his first stage role (Otis Skinner 1924:1).</page><page sequence="11">ANOTHER LOOK AT CHARLES M. SKINNER 109 In each of these cases Skinner identifies a breech of the dialectic by which objective nature is engaged and transcended by subjective hu- manity. Authenticity--the unspoiled Palisades or animals observed (even anthropomorphically) in the wild-lies not within the object, but in the way the object is addressed by the subject. Stated another way, we cannot achieve transcendence -locating humanity within nature-if we force nature to become human. TECHNOLOGY, URBAN LIFE, AND SOCIAL REFORM Skinner's doctrine of subjectivity and nature would be far less in- teresting had he not also endeavored to respond to the exigencies of urban life. Undoubtedly he would have been exposed to the dramatic urbanization of Brooklyn during his years at the Eagle. During this time, immigration contributed to stunning leaps in Brooklyn's popu- lation: in 1880, it stood at 556,663; in 1890 at 806,343; in 1900 at 1,166,582 (Miller, Miller &amp; Karp 1979:4). The Brooklyn Bridge, com- pleted in 1883, radically altered Brooklyn's relationship with Manhat- tan, diminishing its (and the Eagle's) cultural autonomy. Originally, the Eagle had enthusiastically supported the construction of the bridge and, oblivious to the cultural changes it would bring, had christened it as "man's triumph over nature, as proof of his courage, enterprise, skill, faith, and endurance" (Schroth 1974:86; Schroth 1979:107). With equal vehemence, the Eagle opposed Brooklyn's an- nexation as a New York borough, the coup de grafce to autonomy, which came in 1898 (Miller, Miller &amp; Karp 1979:25). Yet Skinner, particularly for someone who once covered the crime beat for the Times, seems curiously oblivious to much of what is com- monly associated with turn-of-the-century New York and its environs and with the concerns of others who would write on folklore. Again, it is entirely likely that consideration of his Times and Eagle writing would reveal a more exact picture of his position on social reform. Yet it is not to be denied that while others-Jacob Riis, for example-were confronting social issues in popular periodicals profoundly and di- rectly, Skinner was not. Yet on the margins of his field of concern are observations on social reform, tenement life, wage earning, industrial development, and poverty. Skinner chose his subjects carefully, how- ever, as if aware that writing about them would shape his thought as profoundly as would experiencing them.</page><page sequence="12">110 WESTERN FOLKLORE For instance, Skinner writes only indirectly on the subject of pov- erty. Addressing one of its guises, charity, he writes most deliberately, though arriving at conclusions that are hardly certain. On the one hand, he recounts the selfless generosity of Father Puitz of St. Vincent who, after the violent eruption of the La Soufriere volcano destroyed part of the island, gave his life's savings to those suffering from the disaster, sacrificing his only chance to return to his European home- land (Skinner 1903d). Of this incident he is unequivocally sympa- thetic. Elsewhere, however, he is disturbed by the complexities of charitable giving: There is too much of charity, and too little kindness. A man has to be pretty low in body and mind to accept charity; but, granted that he must, how can he endure to receive bread, coal, and flannel shirts all the time? Is it not enough to crush the life out of him? [Skinner 1897a:620] Skinner is impressed by a Connecticut couple who, out of work for some time due to illness (again, a circumstance, not an attribute), spent money given to them by sympathetic neighbors on tickets to hear Charles Dickens read! "Gifts with beauty, gifts that teach," Skin- ner writes, "... make a horizon for [a man's] life, so that he can look up once in a while, when he is earning, and refresh himself, and feel that there is something on this earth, after all, besides bread and coal and flannel" (1897a:620). Skinner's ambivalence is a consequence of his analysis of poverty: poverty is a spiritual, not an economic, condition. More precisely, social, economic, and technological conditions exist, but they must be distinguished from the ontologies they produce. This is the ultimate source of his optimism-humans are most happy when they are "be- holden to nothing and nobody" (Skinner 1897a:311). Spiritual free- dom ultimately leads to overall prosperity; indeed, desperate condi- tions are produced because humanity is inhospitable to itself. Man is more abusive than the earth. He slays for gain, he slays for sport, he fells the woods, he blasts the hills, he dries the streams, he mars loveliness, he lives unbeautifully, until he gets intelligence and sees that the rest of creation thrives by opposite conduct, when he begins to act with modesty and to harmonize his actions to those of the rest of the world. [Skinner 1897a, quoted in Hubbard 1900:121-22] Thus Skinner draws upon transcendental thought to address contem- porary social conditions. As a general principle, he argues that since</page><page sequence="13">ANOTHER LOOK AT CHARLES M. SKINNER 111 nature is generous, and transcendent humanity is within nature, it follows that generosity must be natural. Gloom and greed are both unnatural states of existence. The latter can come to no pleasure: "To enjoy solely by consuming, without continuing or creating, is hard" (1897a:619). Both can be overcome by deliberate individual action and, following widespread adherence to these principles, social im- provement for all will prevail. Otherwise, Skinner half-seriously prophesies, if either gloom or greed goes unchecked, the city will self-destruct from corruption and oppression, its population will flee to other more desirable locales, and "within a twelve-month Nature will have declared herself in the place that had forgotten her" (1901:550). While poverty is depicted as a subjective response to conditions, technology is a vehicle which produces subjective response. Skinner is not unilaterally anti-industrial--he does not view technology as an evil monolith-but considers that some technologies present particular ontological problems. Technology, in fact, is much like the land. To the extent that it accommodates transcendent experience, it is good. If it enslaves humankind, it is not. For example, Skinner is bewildered by the unrestrained popularity of the electric trolley car (Skinner 1902). In 1895, the aggressive driving of trolley operators was responsible for an estimated one pe- destrian death per week, thus leading to the name "Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers" for the professional baseball franchise (Miller, Miller &amp; Karp 1979:23). For Skinner, the trolley would revolutionize Ameri- can life more than any other innovation in transportation because with it Americans could refuse to live near their work. It was an innovation which would feed American families' desire "to separate industrial and social life," leading to the creation of suburbs and to autonomous boroughs, each "differing as widely in the dominant race as in geographical place, yet increasingly self-sustaining" (Skinner 1902:800). Consequently, "flats and tenements" would be worst served by the trolley since it would exacerbate their isolation and discourage reform. In contrast, rural districts would stand to gain the most: "country industries will be made easier, touch with the markets more rapid, amusements more generous, and life will be broader, freer, more diverse" (1902:807). On the whole, given the course of Skinner's life and work, it would be difficult to defend his social and cultural thought against the charge of some measure of myopia. Yet, particularly in his singular</page><page sequence="14">112 WESTERN FOLKLORE approach to folklore, he is important because he duplicates so few of the ideas of his contemporaries. To his credit, he resists the tempta- tion to indulge in the symbology of gloom associated with the tene- ments and, furthermore, rejects the sovereign ideology of realism with which that indulgence was defended. In his obsessive proclivity to provide ontological solutions for political and economic problems, he can be accused of unwittingly abetting the social realities he detests (see Whisnant 1983). Yet because he views town and country- perhaps also the past and the present-as a part of a single, albeit ontological, system, he at least avoids the trap of finding the solution to one in the other.6 Skinner's ontologies do not compensate for social realities. For Skinner, all environments are local, and it is mobility and its symbolic instruments, much more than capitalism, which neutral- izes the significance of locality and leads to social fragmentation. And it is this aspect of Skinner's thinking-the preeminence of locality- which is most evident in his folklore collections. SKINNER'S TRANSCENDENTAL FOLKLORISTICS In the short preface to Skinner's first collection, Myths and Legends of Our Own Land (1896), there is little more than a vague indication of what his intentions are. At the time the book was published, he had been amassing this collection for some time--"so long that a claim may be set forth for some measure of completeness" (Skinner 1896:I, 5). There is also an indication that his efforts were partly intended to assess the national literature at the end of its "episodes of our four historic centuries," thus necessitating the "measure of completeness" he claimed at the time to have achieved. Whether by this he also meant to position himself within the declining ethos of the Columbian centenary (e.g., the 1893 Chicago Exposition) is not clear, but it is easy to speculate that that played some role in the book's popularity (see Rydell 1984; Banta and Hinsley 1986; Newell 1892). If so, characteristic centenary sentiments are notably scarce in the body of Skinner's work. Various urban and rural settings and races of characters appear, but are not linked to an interpretive spectrum of progress or racial superiority. Skinner is shamelessly nostalgic, but his 6. Compare Williams (1973), who severely criticizes the literary treatment of the extremes of the English industrial revolution on Marxist terms. For Williams, the literary representation of country and city obscures the fact that they are the products of a single system of economic capitalism which exploits both populations.</page><page sequence="15">ANOTHER LOOK AT CHARLES M. SKINNER 113 depiction of the past is not one opposed to the technological present. It is a "receding past, beyond the memory of living man" (Dorson 1971b:72). Significantly, he is not concerned with collecting legends before they disappear, but with the question of there having been sufficient time (naturally, since the European arrival) for America to have produced a national legendry. Racial and cultural taxonomy is not of primary importance to Skin- ner; consequently, he generally does not take explicit exception to popular doctrine. His legends are peopled by various races and cul- tures, but their importance is secondary. Of the Hudson River, for instance, he notes that "historic scenes have been enacted on its shores, and Indian, Dutchman, Briton, and American have invested it with romance" (1896:I, 31). Stereotypes are incidental both to this legend and to the collection as a whole. This point is lost on one reviewer who took Skinner's collection as evidence that "the Aryan imagination may be trusted to grow a plentiful crop of legends in four centuries" (Anonymous Review 1896a:318). In fact, Skinner is contemptuous of "the fad of Anglomania" and the general intolerance--"the habit of putting other people under discipline for not thinking as we do, or being so lucky"-that accom- panies it (Skinner 1897a:619; cf. Gossett 1963). In his lone Journal of American Folklore publication, he urges readers to overcome "local or creed bias" in engaging a Canadian saint's legend (Skinner 1906b: 341). Perhaps this stance is articulated particularly for Journal read- ers. He appears to wholeheartedly affirm Whitman's vehement objection to slavery, which he quotes in detail (Skinner 1903c:684). Yet if Skinner is misunderstood in one instance, he is ambivalent in another. He accepts without question European domination of Indi- ans, even contributing a piece of Western romance to an adventure magazine (Skinner 1903b), but elsewhere is contemptuous of the gra- tuitous taking of common land for private property (Skinner 1897a:619). Skinner's savages are surely noble, but so are others who stalk the land in the legendary past which he constructs. While it would be difficult to completely extricate Skinner's work from the narrative of conquest, he can at least be credited with some degree of resistance through the vehicle of transcendentalism.7 7. On romanticization and conquest, see Green (1988a, 1988b) and Kirshenblatt-Gimblett (1988).</page><page sequence="16">114 WESTERN FOLKLORE He also carefully positions his collections taxonomically, taking care to indicate that his texts are legends, while "as to folk-lore, that of the Indian tribes and of the Southern negro is too copious to be recounted in this work" (1896:I, 6). This possible reference to New- ell's (1888) charter for the Society (which did address explicitly "the folklore of Indian tribes and the Southern negro") is perhaps the only place Skinner reveals an awareness of Boasian folkloristics. Newell's sense of the term folk-lore excluded the possibility of newly formed American traditions, including instead survivals of Old World tradi- tions of the European settlers (see Dundes 1966:228). As an indica- tion of the resilience of this doctrine, Alexander Krappe, an Ameri- can folklorist writing specifically on local legend in 1930, discusses only European texts and does not once mention Skinner's works. Since newly formed traditions are precisely what Skinner's collections consist of, he appropriately and prudently distinguishes his texts as myths and legends. In doing so, he also buys distance from the Boa- sian milieu and what would for him be oppressive rigor. Rather, he clearly perceives himself within a literary tradition, as providing source material for the Hawthornes and Irvings to come. Thus we come to Skinner's obsession with locality, of which Dor- son's objection has already been noted. Particularly in the American volumes, legends are meticulously localized, often almost formula- ically, in the first sentence: "Bramley's Mountain, near the present village of Bloomfield, New York, on the edge of the Catskill group, was the home of a young couple .. ." (1896:II, 73). Some tragic or otherwise dramatic incident occurs-on Bramley's Mountain, the hus- band of this idyllic couple is murdered by a previously unsuccessful suitor. She deceives and kills the murderer, then takes her own life at the site where her husband was killed. Through this legend, the tragic incident is connected not with any contemporary local population, but with the land itself. The characters, sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly, still stalk the locality. Legend affixes them to the locality and keeps them alive in memory. The lovers of Bramley's Mountain are Indians-this would be im- portant were it the dominant theme in Skinner's collections. For in- stance, Sollors (1986) attributes the association (by Whites) of Indians with romantic love and melancholy to despondency over their pre- sumed ultimate extinction. Arguing this point with regard to a local legend, Jones (1989) has surveyed chronologically an Alabama lover's leap legend, demonstrating that unrequited romantic love appears</page><page sequence="17">ANOTHER LOOK AT CHARLES M. SKINNER 115 increasingly and only in later variants. The earliest texts have no mention of love. Jones speculates that the girl's death-alleged to be suicidal-was related to the expulsion of the Cherokees from the area in the 1830s. Though Skinner at times operates in this thematic tra- dition (and certainly may be accused, as Sollors does [1986:114-15], of contributing to it), his overall distribution of melancholy, atrocity, and revenge does not indicate consistent racial attributes. Nor are Skinner's localities always rural. Manhattan and the Hud- son comprise half of the first volume of Myths and Legends of Our Own Land. In his own Brooklyn (Flatbush, precisely), an eighteenth cen- tury settler on a drunken spree has a slapstick run-in with pirates (1896:II, 129-31). On Ellis Island, "with the great immigrant station on it and crowds going and coming all the time," a long ago encounter with the devil in a tavern still deters Battery boatmen from late night excursions (1896:11,118-21). Elsewhere, Skinner recounts the found- ing, at Good Luck, New Jersey, of his own Universalism, "the first liberal church" (1896:II, 139-40). Why this preoccupation with locality? And why also with legend? As Dorson readily admits (1971b:69), Skinner's instinctive grasp of the concept of legend was relatively sound, an extraordinary assess- ment given Skinner's training and given the status of legend scholar- ship at the time. On the whole, his texts provide the potential for belief and are set in the recent or historical past (Georges 1971). His grasp of the generic qualities of the legend are even more extraordi- nary given that folklore was not central to the overall concerns of his writing. What was central to his interests was the land, and much can be discerned of his view of folklore by allowing him this reversal of the folklorist's customary hierarchy of significance. Recall his profound affection for nature, for instance, for the un- spoiled Palisades of the Hudson River: "I love my Hudson and am much in its company; it solaces many whose unkind fate holds them to town" (1906a:667). Skinner looks to the future and sees, as at Niagara, artifice: pavement, stairs, fences, lawns, flower beds-a pub- lic park. He looks to the past and sees myth. Poetry has evaded this region, and art has almost ignored it, save in the instance presently to be noted, but our predecessors in the land, the Indians, invested them with a glamor of myth. In their belief the Pal- isades were a part of the wall built by Manitou - whence, Manhattoes, or Manhattan-to keep evil beings that haunted the great lakes from vex- ing the race of men; but the fresh seas burst through, cutting the</page><page sequence="18">116 WESTERN FOLKLORE splendid pass of the Highlands, and the rogues descended on the flood, to our besetment even at this day. [Skinner 1906a:669] Myth provides a model in which nature is held in sufficient awe that humankind is much a part of it. Later, legends replace myths and attribute to the land the location of buried treasures or lovers' leaps. And the "instance presently to be noted": Skinner is referring to the paintings of Van Dearing Perrine, "self-taught, uninfluenced by academics" (Skinner 1906a:671), which Skinner reproduces in the essay and which he critiques in terms of his experiences of the Hudson. Perrine had come to New York from the West as a teen and had for some twenty-five years lived in poverty in the vicinity of the Palisades while painting landscapes.8 In his life and his work, Perrine exemplified the sentiments of commitment. Thus Skinner concluded that all art--painting, myth, poetry, legend, etc.- protects the land by giving it significance. In turn, the land taxonom- ically unites artistic genres and subsumes them beneath its signifi- cance. Local legend, then, was important to Skinner because it affixes land to those who care most for it, those who experience it on terms it sets forth. Krappe ([1930] 1964:70, emphasis in original) vividly describes the relationship between the land and local legend: Local legends are tied to the landscape in which they arise. Usually they were invented to explain some uncommon feature in that very land- scape. This feature remaining, the aetiological legend remains with it. Were this feature to disappear, owing to some change in the earth's surface, the legend would disappear likewise. Local legends are trans- mitted from generation to generation in that neighborhood, with little or no modification. When transmitted to outsiders ... the legend is as a rule quickly forgotten. . . . Out of sight, out of mind, certainly holds true for this particular production of the popular genius. Local legends, in sum, do not migrate. Jason (1971:141-43) explores the rhetoric of land affixation: the local legend delineates a geographical space using a variety of cultural descriptors. Skinner takes command of this geographical space him- 8. Perrine (1869-1955), after his lengthy poverty, began to rise in prominence at about the time Skinner's work appeared. His painting, "The Palisades," was selected to hang in the White House during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. Perrine believed in the natural creativity of children, and in painting as a vehicle for the emotions and not the intellect (see National Cyclopaedia 1962).</page><page sequence="19">ANOTHER LOOK AT CHARLES M. SKINNER 117 self by juxtaposing special symbolic places (identified in the legendary event) with local and remote places in the real world (identified by contemporary names of places and sites). Skinner's legendary past is to some degree mythopoeic-it was a time when humanity intuitively understood the spiritual perfection of nature-but it is a world nei- ther inaccessible nor remote. Dorson (1971b:70) notes the accidental similarity of Skinner's col- lection with Stewart's later study (Names on the Land, 1945) of the naming of American places. Whitman described this phenomenon as follows: Names are the turning point of who shall be master. -There is so much virtue in names that a nation which produces its own names, haughtily adheres to them, and subordinates others to them, leads all the rest of the nations of the earth. [Whitman 1904, quoted in Simpson 1986:231] In such a way, writes Stewart (cf. Boorstin 1965:299), a prominent feature of the conquest of America was the production or adoption by Europeans during the nineteenth century of well over a million place names. But part of the power of names is that while names remain fixed, other significances (including the naming process itself) are erased from memory due to mobility-thus the necessity for Stewart's study (see Krappe [1930] 1964:70). Skinner's legends contradict this loss of meaning by juxtaposing names with events. They also contradict legal ownership of the land, since its attachment to its possessor is remote and arbitrary rather than immediate and experiential. Migratory genres (as well as ontological attributes--race, etc.) can move from place to place with the people who are defined by them. They are cultural vehicles which accommodate mobility and conquest. Local legend, in contrast, emphasizes commitment. Furthermore, localization is not a device of realism-which Skinner opposes-but a specific component of coherent genre. Skinner dis- dains photography, for instance, preferring the interactive, subjective instrumentality of a sketchpad. A picture is not an imitation of an object: it is a disclosure of the painter's understanding of that object. If it is an imitation, it pretends to be what it is not, and great art never does that, whether it be an art of painting, or of acting, or of architecture, or of music. [1907:CXVI] Likewise, he deplores precision in painting except as it circum- scribes the employment of the subjective in genre painting (1907:</page><page sequence="20">118 WESTERN FOLKLORE CXI-CXII).9 The conventions of the style guide the otherwise boundless subjectivity of the painter in his or her engagement of everyday subjects. Skinner is critical of studio painters for their lack of worldly engagement (1906a:671), and thus conceives of genre paint- ing as a means by which the artist is instructed to contemplate first- hand the everyday world. Skinner's prescient understanding of legend can be attributed in part to his understanding of it as an instrument of seeing. He presents his legends "in every case reconstructed" (Skinner 1896:I, 5; Dorson 1971b:70) because as legends they guide both his and his reader's subjective experience. Furthermore, according to Skinner's approach to reading, these "reconstructions" should not impose unnecessarily upon the mind-" ... we are untrue to ourselves, anyway, when we read, putting the thoughts of others into us.. ." (1897a:31 1). Reading is itself an unnatural process: We associate oftener on a spiritual or animal basis than on the mental one. We hesitate to approach a scholar; but how easily we chatter with a sailor, a soldier, a laborer, a farmer, or a tramp! [Skinner 1897a:311] Insofar as the local legend can overcome these limitations, it does so by communicating both the content of the story and its generic form. "The moment our discourse rises above the ground line of familiar facts, and is inflamed with passion or exalted by thought," Emerson wrote ([1836] 1985), "it clothes itself in images." Because local legend is a folk genre, it communicates its principles in so non-exalted a form. Thus in his own eyes, it is a testament to Skinner's success that so few of his motives are visible to readers of his collections. As Dorson laments, there is little editorial information about the legends. Sources are not identified; the processes of text collection and selec- tion are invisible. Skinner's posture is carefully "reconstructed" in the legends so that it is, as he hopes, unobtrusive to the reader. Perhaps this posture is motivated by the transcendentalist view that language 9. Skinner is referring here to Francis D. Millet (1846-1912), known as a muralist, genre painter, and tireless traveler--he was a passenger on the Titanic when it sank. Millet was appointed director of decoration at the 1893 Columbian Exposition and is credited with the tonal scheme resulting in the "White City." His genre paintings reflected his "conservatively progressive" attitude toward painting-they are considered excellent but unchallenging works (National Cyclopaedia 1916:202).</page><page sequence="21">ANOTHER LOOK AT CHARLES M. SKINNER 119 is a part of the natural world, connected to the things it describes rather than to the speakers who utter it (Simpson 1986). Whatever the case, identifying the source of the text takes the reader out of the moral process Skinner seeks to set in motion because this would mark the legend as belonging to someone else. It is precisely this feature which separates Skinner from later pop- ularizers and regionalists. American pluralism, an idea to which Skin- ner was not exposed, imposed a mediating (and perhaps obscuring) factor between humankind's relationship with environment- culture. The crucial difference was in the mechanism of transcendence. For Skinner, transcendence was achieved by experiencing humankind's spiritual unity with all of nature. For pluralists, the goal was to become one with the culture, to take on the moral or aesthetic purity of a generalized cultural other. In extreme cases, the question of cultural transcendence even implied a prior question of qualification (Dorson 1950). Less extreme examples include Constance Rourke's study of Charles Sheeler, depicting an artist who sought to recreate Shaker culture in painting (Hyman 1955:118). Botkin, whose popular collec- tions are easily the most similar to those of Skinner, struggled with regional culture as a source for literary inspiration, ultimately arriving at a regional experience that was in fact local: "the spirit confronting destiny in particularized surroundings" (Botkin 1933:296; cf. Hirsch 1987:9-10). These issues, which would help sustain interest in folklore throughout the twentieth century, were of minimal concern to Skin- ner. His world, rather, was one in which dramatic population in- creases, economic uncertainty, and industrialization would impose upon an idealism based upon humankind's unity with nature. It was hardly an environment which was hospitable: ... in America of the late nineteenth century, when religion became less of a battleground and anxieties were centered upon the economic problem, Transcendentalism-or what little was left of it-seemed no more than a harmless exhortation to self-reliance and optimism. [Miller 1967:13] Skinner worked in this environment, preserving transcendentalist tradition with sometimes ingenious results. He is important to folk- lorists because he provides a conscientious alternative to our often resolute pluralist doctrine. We can appreciate, then, that he wrote so</page><page sequence="22">120 WESTERN FOLKLORE confidently, that he maintained so broad a vision, and, perhaps also, that he arrived at so unlikely a solution as to compile collections of myths and legends.
