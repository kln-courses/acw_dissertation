<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 20, No. 2, June 1979 ? 1979 by Alexander Marshack Upper Paleolithic Symbol Systems of the Russian Plain: Cognitive and Comparative Analysis by Alexander Marshack MICROSCOPIC ANALYSES of engraved and carved mobiliary arti- facts from the Upper Paleolithic mammoth-hunting cultures of the Russian plain, encompassing the drainage of the Dnepr and Don Rivers, have revealed the presence of a number of com- plex symbol systems.' These have been found to differ from the symbol systems of the Western European Upper Paleo- lithic cultures. The results of this research provide an impor- tant new body of analytic data for comparing the diverse regional European traditions of the Upper Paleolithic and for reconsidering the origins, meanings, and uses of early Homo sapiens sapiens image, symbol, and art. I shall describe several of the most important of these symbol systems, touch on some of the cognitive strategies involved in their manufacture and use, and compare them with the symbol systems and modes of symbol usage of the Western European Upper Paleolithic. The data and discussion should have some relevance for the interpretation and study of European sym- bolic traditions of the post-Pleistocene. 1 The research in this paper was conducted during 1976-77 un- der auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., and was funded by the National Geographic Society, the National En- dowment for the Humanities, and the Harry F. Guggenheim Foun- dation. Artifacts were examined at the State Historical Museum, Moscow; the Anthropological Museum of the University of Mos- cow; the Ethnographic Museum of the Academy of Sciences, Len- ingrad; the Hermitage, Leningrad; the Archaeological Institute, Kiev; the Archaeological Section of the Museum of Natural Sci- ences, Kiev; the Paleontological Section of the Museum of Natural Sciences, Kiev; and the State Historical Museum, Kiev. Certain pieces were made available for study by their excavators. ALEXANDER MARSHACK has been a Research Associate of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard Uni- versity (Cambridge, Mass. 02138, U.S.A.) since 1965. He has developed microscopic and spectroscopic techniques for study- ing prehistoric engraving and painting. He has been interested in the production sequences, uses, and cognitive strategies evi- dent in the diverse symbol systems of the Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic of Europe (CA 13:445-77). He has recently begun to study the American prehistoric engraved materials. He has used these broad comparative studies of early preliterate symbol sys- tems to explore the relation of early image systems to the evo- lution of language (CA 17:274-82) and more general cultural developments in the Paleolithic and immediate post-Paleolithic. The present paper was submitted in final form 3 v 78. THE MATERIALS AND THEIR STUDY The archaeological materials consist of a number of classes of symbolic or decorated artifacts: female figurines; decorated and undecorated amulets, pendants, and beads; small, crude animal carvings; carved vulvas; decorated utilitarian objects such as burnishers, spatulas, spoons, and shovels; painted mammoth bones; and ritual burials with symbolic grave goods. These are well known and have been widely published (Boris- kovsky 1958, Abramova 1967, Klein 1969, Jelinek 1975). The publication of the symbolic artifacts has been mainly descrip- tive, though there has been some theoretical discussion as to their possible meaning and function, based largely on ethno- graphic comparison with shamanistic traditions of historic Si- beria and on hypotheses concerning the role of art and symbol in early hunting cultures (Abramova 1967:80-90). There has also been an attempt to impute an arithmetic numerology to these mammoth-hunters (Frolov 1974), including use of the "magic number 7," again based largely on ethnographic com- parison and inference. Till now there has been no systematic study of the artifacts themselves. One reason is that there has been no body of theory within which such a study could be undertaken and ino methodology for instituting such study. The development of the microscopic methodology as part of a pro- gram of study devoted to Western European symbolic materials (Marshack 1970a, b, c; 1972a, b; 1976a, b; 1977) has provided us with a number of analytic techniques and a body of data that make it possible to begin an intensive analysis of the Russian materials and a broad comparative study of Eastern and West- ern European Upper Paleolithic symbolic traditions. FISHLIKE IMAGES The symbolic artifacts from Timonovka, excavated by Gorod- tsov (1935) on the right bank of the Desna (a tributary of the Dnepr), have been described by Abramova (1967:43) as "com- posed of several fragments of bone and mammoth tusk with engraved designs that are more of a geometric character." This is the traditional manner of describing the regional Upper Paleolithic style of engraving and marking. One of the simpler of these designs (fig. 1) was originally described by Gorodtsov as looking like a fish. There has been no discussion in the litera- Vol. 20 * No. 2 * June 1979 271</page><page sequence="2">FIG. 1.

Other fishlike images have been excavated from Upper Paleolithic levels in the Soviet Union, but these too have been little discussed. The reasons for the neglect are many. It has been assumed traditionally that the inhabitants of the Russian plain were primarily hunters-of herbivores such as reindeer, mammoth, and horse and smaller species that provided fur and skins- but that they had given little attention, under subarctic condi- tions, to gathering and fishing. Though excavated sites on the Russian plain are almost always on river terraces, skeletal re- mains of fish have not been recovered, and bone or ivory tools such as fishhooks or barbed harpoons have not been found (but see Addendum). In addition, the cold climate of the region during much of the late Wiirm, with permafrost sometimes ex- tending as far south as 47-48O north latitude, did not invite images of riverine activity. Recently, however, researchers have suggested that the mammoth-bone huts and the hearths of mammoth-bone fires excavated on the river terraces may have been winter habitations, which would account for the scant skeletal evidence of migratory birds and of fish. Subarctic hunters today, during the spring and summer runs of fish, de- bone and dry their catch outside the camp for eventual winter use. The solution of this problem will have relevance for an understanding of the symbolic materials from Timonovka and the other sites on the Russian plain. In 1968, while studying the engraved and carved artifacts in the Moravian Museum in Brno, Czechoslovakia, I came upon an unpublished fragment of mammoth tusk from the Pavlo- vian or East Gravettian site of Predmost. Incised on the tusk was an image that looked like a geometricized fish (fig. 2). I was informed by a number of archaeologists in Brno that there were no known incised representations of fish in the East FIG. 2. Schematic fish (6 cm) incised on a piece of mammoth tusk from Pfedmost, Czechoslovakia. Gravettian cultures of Moravia, though an ivory fishhook or prong had been found at Predmost. Like the image from Predmost, the Timonovka fishlike image was intentionally incised upon a nonutilitarian, unshaped frag- ment of mammoth ivory. Microscopic study indicated that the engraving involved four conceptual acts. First, a series of long, more or less horizontal lines was incised, outlining the top of an arced fish form. The form was then filled in below by a series of short strokes crossing each other at an angle (\/\% t and by parallel strokes ( ) overcrossed7 by others ( tttC), creating a quickly drawn hatch or schematic fish-scale motif. This internal hatching was accumulated from left to right. The form was then closed by a series of lines below, completing the fish body. Finally, a number of quick strokes were added below and above to sketch what seem to be schematic fins and tail. The full sequence suggests that the engraver was not in- tending to illustrate a realistic fish but was engaged in the in- formal marking of a rough fishlike form that stressed the fish- scale motif. In contrast, the Piredmost fish seemed to have been structured around the image of the barbed spine. Breuil and de Saint-Perier (1927) had earlier shown that schematized fish were engraved as decorative motifs on late Franco-Cantabrian Upper Paleolithic batons, points, spear throwers, and harpoons and could be schematized as ovals, sets of hatch marks, series of undulating arcs, or rhomboidal lozenges. Realistic and sche- matized fish were, in fact, major motifs among these materials, though they are comparatively rare in the caves of the area. An unpublished fragment of mammoth ivory from Timonov- ka (fig. 3) on exhibit in the State Historical Museum, Moscow, is repeatedly incised with the type of motif that has been de- scribed as "oblique checkerwork" (Abramova 1967). Micro- scopic analysis of the fragment revealed an unexpected com- plexity in the sequence of engraving and in the strategies involved. The tusk had been broken at both ends. A vertical cut at left seems related to the break, but the actual breakage does not occur along this cut. The horizontal grooves in the ivory were formed by persistent overengraving, perhaps to ex- tract sections of ivory to make such tools as points or needles. These grooves had apparently so weakened the tusk that it had broken. As a result, the remaining fragment now had six "panels" formed by these grooves. On each of these panels fish motifs were engraved, each incised with a different point and a different rhythm and spacing. The microscope indicates that each of the engravings is complete and that the fish forms had been carefully placed within each panel. The large panel at the top (fig. 4) has three incised fish forms, each beginning at the left and narrowing as it proceeds towards the right. A fourth, extremely schematic, almost ser- pentine fish was added lightly between the first and second. The widest panel, the third down (fig. 5), has two fish forms. In all, there are ten schematic fish forms (fig. 6), accumulated over a period of time. The strategies involved in constructing each fish, except for the two smallest and most schematic, are similar to those seen in figure 3. These data suggest the presence of a tradition of marking 272 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC SYMBOL SYSTEMS fishlike motifs on nonutilitarian fragments of ivory. It must be stressed that the motifs were not used to decorate a utilitarian or ritual object. Further, while the images are near-iconic and often recognizable, they are not art. A microscopic study of the remaining engraved ivory fragments from Timonovka indicated that the tradition of marking scraps of ivory was open-that it was the act of marking that was important and not the pre- cision or placement of the motifs. The result is a variability in the final appearance of all the accumulations. A small fragment of tusk from a young mammoth (fig. 7), the tip of which was shaved as though to make a pole or stake but which was subsequently broken in use, was engraved with what Abramova (1967:pl. 36, 17) has described as an "oblique network [of] transverse hatchings." Microscopic analysis of the engraving reveals that it too was incised after the breakage and that the incised lines at left, at the edge of the break, are unbroken. The incised composition seems to be random and unstructured, but the microscope reveals that it consists of precisely the same type of intentional accumulation as in figure 6, this time on a narrow, rounded surface that was not divided into panels (figs. 8, 9). Eight fish forms were tightly packed on one face of the tusk, each made with a different point and a different rhythm and spacing (fig. 10). The three fish at left in the exploded schematic rendition are facing right and were engraved from right to left. The two fish at right face in the opposite direction and were engraved from left to right. A fish accumulation or melange of this type was clearly not intended as decoration or as a composition. Instead, it seems to repre- sent a sequence of private or specialized acts of ritual participa- tion involving the marking of a fish motif. The fact that these ~~~~~~~~~~~~- - |- s- ---- - --- --- --- ------ - -------- Ir.' -i 1 Pf*l|I .M.~~~~~~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~ ~ .: ..... forme byS thegovs fragments are found in the habitation site suggests that the engraver was participating in a meaningful cultural tradition understood within the group. A third, again unpublished, fragment of engraved mammoth ivory from Timonovka (fig. 11) has two deep horizontal grooves comparable to those on the fragment illustrated in figure 2, suggesting that this artifact, like the other, is a scrap derived from the process of tool making. Below the incised grooves (fig. 12) there are three schematic fish forms each engraved by a different point from left to right and each more schematic than the last. The second fish looks serpentine, like the most schematic of the fish forms (the second from the top) in figure 6. The lower fish is a mere angular form, similar again to the most schematic of the fish forms in figure 6. A fourth fish form was lightly engraved near the lower of the two hori- zontal grooves. Another probable fish was placed between the grooves. The mode of image making and accumulation described here was one of the fundamental forms of symbol usage among the early H. sapiens sapiens cultures. It has recently been document- ed within Western European Upper Paleolithic cultures (Mar- shack 1976a, b; 1977). Intensive microscopic analyses were 5 . S iN N |w a |~~~~~~ :i A i ., FIG. 4.

Unrolled linear rendition of the ten schematic fish forms of the ivory fragment of figure 3. performed on hundreds of engraved nonrepresentational com- positions on artifacts from the Franco-Cantabrian area, eastern Spain, the many sites of the Romanellian tradition of Italy, and dispersed, but rare, Magdalenian sites as far north as Germany (Gonnersdorf and Hohlenstein) and Poland (Maszyska). These analyses revealed that the seemingly random macaroni/mean- der images found in these cultures were used as participatory and cumulative motifs on nonutilitarian fragments of bone and stone in habitation sites. The macaroni/meander motif also ap- pears in the Franco-Cantabrian caves, and here again it was used cumulatively in acts of ritual participation. The presence of a tradition on the Russian plain of marking and accumulating schematized motifs on nonutilitarian frag- ments in the habitation site, like the comparable tradition in Western Europe, poses a complex series of problems for ar- chaeological, cultural, and psychological studies of early H. sapiens sapiens. From the viewpoint of both the evolution of the hominid cognitive-and-symbolic capacity and the develop- ment of human cultural forms and structures, this mode of motif use may have been one of the early, pre-art symbol- making processes out of which art evolved. The use of mean- ingful, near-iconic images and, later, of more representational and formal images may represent a process in which the image served as a symbol in the cultural continuum and as a point marker in a periodic sequence of symbolic relations and acts. This formulation differs markedly both from Breuil's sug- gestion (Breuil, Obermaier, and Werner 1915) that art may have evolved from random doodling in soft clay and from more recent but related suggestions that it may have evolved from idiosyncratic, somewhat aesthetic experimental acts by pri- mates. The primate capacity to doodle and primate and homi- nid acts of doodling do not create symbols, which are products of cultural communication and interchange with a communal semantics. Just as human infant babbling does not lead to lan- guage outside a cultural context, human or chimpanzee doo- dling does not lead to symbol outside a symboling cultural context. It is not the capacity for, or even the expression of, such pre-language or pre-art processes that is important for ontogeny and phylogeny and for the development of cultural forms, but the utilization of these capacities and expressions within established symboling processes. The ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of the hominid symboling capacity requires feedback between the individuals in a group and the ongoing cultural structures. In evolutionary terms, it is the use of the individual's incipient symboling capacity, within a re- ceptive context or culture, that makes the capacity initially and increasingly meaningful, functional, and adaptive and thus a behavioral aspect for which genetic selection can be operative. At the advanced sapiens stage, the use of the near-iconic sym- bolic image, like language, seems to have been generic. I am forced to these thoughts because the archaeological data suggest that the use of near-iconic and nonrepresentational images in the Upper Paleolithic developed its own internally consistent strategies and cultural forms without recourse to or development from any naturalistic or representational tradi- tions. Once instituted as a functional mode, these early sym- bolic strategies and forms could develop either towards natu- ralism or towards an increasing elaboration of the near-iconic and the schematic. With dispersal of the early H. sapiens sa- piens cultures, regional and temporal styles appear and indi- vidual strategies and skills enter into image and motif pro- duction (Marshack 1977:314-15, figs. 41-44).

Such a development did not occur on the Russian plain, where the realistic animal image is rare, and it was not a major aspect of either Pavlovian or Romanellian traditions. On the Russian plain and apparently in these other areas, it was the near-iconic image and the phenomenologically related abstract motif that assumed the role of primary ele- ment in the functional symbolism. Within this frame, these cul- tures developed a number of symbol systems that were as sophisticated as those in the Franco-Cantabrian cultures where more naturalistic animal images were in use in ritual, decora- tion, and symbolic illustration. These diverse modes of regional image making may have served comparable symbolic and cul- FIG. 1 1.

This is partially suggested by the continuing presence and development of schematic motif manufacture in the Western European tradition, contemporaneous with natu- ralistic traditions. I have tentatively proposed (1977) that the macaroni/ mean- der accumulations in Western Europe represent a tradition of water-related symbolism and ritual. On the river terraces of the Russian plain, the mammoth-hunters developed their own tra- ditions of motif marking, involving a stylistically different, but cognitively and perhaps culturally related, mode of engraving and accumulating a water-related imagery. What the fishlike motif meant, precisely and fully, and what network of cultural concepts was involved in its use can only be surmised. It seems clear, however, that it was not part of a simple "hunting magic" intended to facilitate the capture of fish by the drawing of a fish image. The more schematic motifs are not sufficiently fishlike to have served as images of this type. If the mammoth-bone huts of the Russian plain were win- ter dwellings, we have the problem of the fish motif's being made while rivers were frozen. It could have been a sign of the coming thaw and spring, of the renewal of life. It could also have represented a species that had disappeared from the en- vironment but would reappear with the proper ritual interven- tion. In such usage, the seasonal changes occurring in the realm of water-and-fish would represent periodic constants for the Upper Paleolithic hunters and the symbols would encom- pass a recognition of the constancy, variability, and periodicity of the phenomena. It is perhaps significant that at Timonovka only a single crude animal figure was found-a mammoth carving compar- able to those from other sites of the Russian plain (Kostenki I and Avdeevo) and from Predmost in Moravia and Vogelherd in Germany. The comparative rarity in the Russian-plain sites of representations of mammoth, a major animal species, and the total absence of images of reindeer and other species which were sources of food contrasts with the persistent use of a "minor" species in ritual marking. Ethnographically, the sym- bolic use of minor species for mythological and ritual purposes is, of course, well known. ZIGZAGS AND DOUBLE LINES At the terrace site of Eliseyevichi on the Sudost River (a tribu- tary of the Desna), Polikarpovich (1968) excavated a group of ivory plaquettes containing what have traditionally been described as "complex geometric designs" (Abramova 1967: 45). These designs are so intricate that adequate linear rendi- tions have not been published, though Polikarpovich published photographs of the artifacts. An unpublished fragment of tusk from Eliseyevichi is en- graved over the entire area of the outer surface with an unusual composition (fig. 13). Microscopic analysis indicates that none of the engraved lines are broken and that they were incised with different points. This mode of accumulating motifs on different areas of a surface and along the edges separates the motifs for the maker visually and sequentially. Here again, a fragment was used as the surface for a ritual or symbolic marking within the habitation site. The motifs engraved on the fragment include the ladder, the multiple zigzag (broken by a crack in the ivory), the single-line zigzag, a geometricized right-angle form, sets of two parallel lines which form a double-line motif, and others. The ladder (fig. 14) has a branch consisting of doubled parallel lines at- tached at left. The linear zigzag has single lines attached. The doubled parallel lines at bottom left (fig. 15) have a branch attached. The three lines at top have a branch of two lines attached. The sets of doubled lines scattered about are over- crossed by other sets. The accumulation documents a tradition of periodic marking (a) by the placement of motifs in associa- 276 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC SYMBOL SYSTEMS tion with related motifs, (b) by the attachment of related, often schematized, motifs to an earlier more carefully made motif, and (c) by the overengraving of one motif on another of the same class. These strategies are quite simple, but unless one understands them the end result can be visually confusing and seemingly random. This mode of motif use and accumulation, but with a some- what different iconography, has been documented for the West- ern European Upper Paleolithic (Marshack 1972a; 1976a, b; 1977). These images and motifs, as noted earlier, are not art, and they are not public images intended to be seen. They are also not decorations, that is, motifs applied to a utilitarian, ritual, or costume artifact. Finally, they are not notations, which are linearly and sequentially ordered and can only be understood in that order. Instead, they are nonlinear, like the fish accumulations, but apparently have a more complex syn- tax. A limited library of semantically related motifs is periodi- cally and repeatedly utilized. This mode of symbol usage con- tains the possibility of providing motifs which can be used for meaningful decorative purposes, on the one hand, and, under the proper social and economic conditions, for pictographic rec- ord keeping or motif sequencing as a form of pre-writing mnemonics, on the other. No new cognitive capacity or cultural tradition would be required-only the development of other specific skills and strategies and other social uses. A somewhat crescent-shaped ivory plaque from Eliseyevichi, convex on one face and concave on the other, is shaped like a tool whose upper arced edge may have been used for smooth- ing skins (fig. 16). It is broken at right and has a chip or flake missing from the center, perhaps a result of pressure applied z -;&gt;s 6 ft c ti l , ;ag;2s*.&lt;8t * i&lt; q 8 &gt; z | _ @ f 4 6 &lt;. t t i _l __ _ tX *' x t&lt;*;?.ay &gt; Sl _ l --- --41 t 4' : 's t ^1 '. ^ _ l_ 2 .

The entire surface is engraved with a seemingly random ac- cumulation of motifs: ladders, zigzags, doubled parallel lines, sets of linear marks, long rectangular forms, and others. Poli- karpovich (1968) and Abramova (1967) have published the photograph and described its "geometric decoration." Soviet archaeologists have referred to this kind of artifact as a "churinga," comparing it to the symbolically marked ovaloid plaques used in ritual by the Australian Aborigines. The com- parison is based partly on the shapes of the artifacts and on the fact that they are presumably decorated, not on any evi- dence for comparable use. Microscopic analysis shows that the engraving is complete and conforms to the breakage, taking into account the missing flake. The slight deterioration and fragmentation that have oc- FIG. 14.

What we apparently have is a plaque that, whatever its original purpose, was broken and was then used for the accumulation of motifs. The microscope in- dicates that the motifs along the edges were engraved first, conforming to the contours of both the plaque and breakage, and the interior motifs later, conforming to the markings that had been made along the edges. There are two zigzag motifs, each attached to a horizontal containing line. The zigzag along the edge, engraved by a differ- ent point from that in the interior, is both worn and deterio- rated, as though it had been incised long before the second, which is still relatively fresh. The interior zigzag, consisting of a long line and an appended zigzag, was renewed at a later date by use of a different point and the addition of a long line and a single angular set of "zigs" (fig. 18). To one side of this interior zigzag is a ladder motif, which was itself later renewed or reused by the addition of a lightly engraved, schematic lad- der, consisting of angles. To the left of the zigzag is a crude serpentine band engraved over all the lines it touches, thus representing a late, perhaps the last, addition to the plaque. In mid-surface (fig. 16) there is a single line, with others at- tached as branches. This motif of the vertical with attached branches appears on other Eliseyevichi plaques (figs. 27, 32) and among the engraved artifacts from Timonovka. Of particular interest are the simple lines and sets of linear marks which are scattered throughout the composition. Visu- ally these do not form recognizable motifs as do the ladder and the zigzag. The microscope indicates that there are two classes of such marks. In the first, there is a set of three to thirteen or more marks made by a single point which gives the appearance of some form of counting. These sets or counts are not sequentially ordered and are randomly placed so that one cannot test them for possible internal linear periodicities or arithmetical regularities. If they do indeed represent some form of counting, they are not subdivided into arithmetic sets or multiples. The second class consists of the motif of the double line, two parallel lines made as a unit, with one point, one pres- sure, and one angle and rhythm of marking. I have described a double-line motif of this type as a "schematic band" (Mar- shack 1976b, 1977). Visually simple and undramatic, this dou- ble line can easily be overlooked, and so it will be discussed in greater detail below. A nonutilitarian scrap of ivory from Eliseyevichi (fig. 19) has a large flake missing in mid-section. Engraved upon'the avail- able outer surface is an accumulation of three motifs: the zig- zag, the rectangle, and the double line. Once again, the micro- scope indicates that the engraving is complete and that the motifs were incised on the fragment in its present form. The zigzag is appended to a long containing line, as is usual among the Russian materials. The rectangles at right (fig. 20) repre- sent an accumulation, since three are parallel and were made by one point and pressure while the last is separated from the three by a stroke and is engraved by a different point and at a different angle. The primary zigzag is engraved by an exceed- ingly sharp point, different from the others. In this area there are a number of motifs. To the left, in mid-fragment, is a random accumulation of double lines, each pair engraved with a different point, pressure, and spacing (fig. 21). On the other side of the rounded fragment (fig. 22), a series of more than a dozen narrow double-line motifs is incised. The marking is so fine and the lines are so carefully parallel that one's first impression is that they were engraved by a denticu- late tool tracking two points.

The double lines here come to a point and sometimes cross each other (fig. 23), indicating that each line was separately engraved and that this parallel marking had been disturbed by the drop of the en- graving tool over the edge. A result of this type could not have been achieved with a denticulate. Most of these double-line sets were engraved from left to right; one set. the fourth from the bottom, however, was engraved from right to left. In the process of engraving the lower line of this set, the flint point broke, creating a gap and then an irregular gash *vhere the tool again hit the ivory. This line was then discontinued. The accident provides us with additional documentation of the strategy involved in marking the double line. When this area of the ivory was filled with double lines, a number of larger two-line and three-line sets were engraved over those already made. The combined data provide evidence for a sequence of marking and accumulating the double-line motif. The motif and its derivation are so unfamiliar that they require a bit more discussion. At the IXth International Congress of the Union of Pre- and Protohistoric Sciences in Nice in 1976, I presented the mi- croscopic analysis of an unpublished fragment of bone from the Pavlovian site of Dolni Vestonice, Czechoslovakia (Marshack 1976b). The fragment is incised with a seemingly random but nevertheless carefully incised set of band motifs (fig. 24). The engraving represents the earliest known example of macaroni or band marking on a nonutilitarian fragment from Central Europe (ca. 27,000 B.C.). This basic form of band marking has been found to be ubiquitous throughout the Western European Upper Paleolithic (Marshack 1976a, b; 1977), from the Peri- gordian to the Romanellian (ca. 28,000-8500 B.C.). Five bands were incised. Each consists of short sections of quickly incised parallel lines appended to one another linearly. There is a tendency for a band to begin as a wide "funnel" and to peter out as a few thin strokes towards the end. This tendency, documented in the Franco-Cantabrian, eastern Span- ish, and Romanellian traditions, apparently led to the so-called comet motif found in the West. After these five bands were engraved, they were overcrossed by three double-line motifs and then by a few single lines. Comparable band accumulations in the West have shown that the double-line motif is often the abstraction of earlier, more complex, filled bands and that it is, in effect, a motif intended for secondary marking and as a schematization of the primary band (Marshack 1977). Among the Russian materials the double-line motif may also be an abstraction of the band motif, regionally stylized as the zigzag. If this is an accurate reading of the data, we would have in the double line a near-iconic schematization of the zigzag/ band that would be culturally comparable to the schematiza- tion of the fish. Because I have assumed that the band motif in the Western European Upper Paleolithic, with its variants of the serpentine, the zigzag, and the double line, is an aspect of a water-related symbolism, I am tentatively proposing that the closely associated zigzag and double line and the contem- poraneous schematic fish in the Upper Paleolithic of the Rus- sian plain are, likewise, aspects of a water-related symbolism. These would thus represent a concatenation of related images produced by a culture that stylistically favored abstraction and schematization over representation and realism. This does not imply equivalence among the fish and zigzag or double-line motifs, but it does suggest that a relation may have existed in ritual usage and in supporting linguistic structures and mythol- ogized explanations. A comparison of the Eastern and Western European tradi- tions of accumulating the band or macaroni motif has shown that in both the band often becomes serpentine as it is extended (Marshack 1977).

In both cases, in the early stages of such band forma- tion we are dealing with an unconscious cognitive strategy arrived at during the process of marking the motif. The seman- tics of the motif, which apparently includes the meaning of flowing water, has influenced the near-iconic forms. In some areas of Europe these schematizations become formalized to create local styles. We thus find the serpentine band in the caves of La Pileta, Spain, and Gargas, France; the geometri- cized and serpentine band at Parpallo, Spain, and at Romanelli s ~~~~~I ( FIG. 21.

In every area in which these variations appear, there is evidence to suggest that the system is still open and that there is room for idiosyncratic strategies conceived during the process of marking (Marshack 1976b, 1977). For example, an unpublished fragment of rib from Avdeevo, on the River Seim (a tributary of the Dnepr), has a crudely made zigzag or macaroni band incised upon it (fig. 25). The band seems to have been quickly made, yet it is clearly inten- tional and is similar to a large body of macaroni bands found in the Western European materials (fig. 26). The presence of the zigzag band at Avdeevo probably does not represent a dis- persal of the image but is rather the result of the strategy utilized by the engraver in incising a schematized, inherently serpentine band. We are faced with a theoretical problem conceming the dis- persal of images. I assume that certain aspects of a tool tradi- 280 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC SYMBOL SYSTEMS tion can be dispersed without complex linguistic explanation, merely as the strategies involved in manufacturing functional end products. There is evidence for the dispersal of basic tool forms, with local variations, throughout Upper Paleolithic Eu- rope. The processes of such dispersal, whether by people, con- cepts, or artifacts, are still under discussion. We have evidence, as well, of an early dispersal of female figurines during the Aurignacian-Perigordian-Gravettian periods and of a dispersal of more generalized symbols such as vulvas, animal images, and costume pieces. We can perhaps assume that recognizable images and decorative forms can be dispersed without the ac- companiment of complex linguistic or mythological supporting structures. In the case of the nondecorative band accumula- tions, however, we have a ritual mode of motif use that re- quires linguistic explanation. In addition, the motifs are not macro- images or forms as are tools, art, or decorations, but E X . -. &lt; S * ; ; ' ' ' ' ' ;~~~~~~.. . .. .. ..t .. ..... 4, .. .... _ s iiiisv.^ _ s_ rs; .. ..... . ... .?.. ....... _. _ . s ~~~~~~~~~~~~..,....i oF _ sa _ .Ik5P-.8 * . . .... . . . . .

Un- like other artifacts, the marked fragments are intended to be- come discards. Can one theoretically assume a diffusion or dispersal for this mode of symbol usage, for the band motif, and for the necessary supporting linguistic contents or struc- tures? The dynamics of such a possible dispersal or diffusion are at the moment unclear. If the zigzag/serpentine/band was a water-related motif, it had a common phenomenological ref- erence among all the riverside hunting cultures of Upper Pa- leolithic Europe. Could it, then, be an aspect of an earlier cul- tural development? Quite specialized symbolic strategies and modes did appear at roughly the same time among skeletally different H. sapiens sapiens groups across Europe and even among the Mongoloid mammoth-hunters of Mal'ta, Siberia. If we assume differences in language, certainly where there are significant differences in skeletal type, then we may have to assume that the symbolic mode under discussion is older than its appearance in the Upper Paleolithic. I have recently raised the possibility that a tradition of near-iconic motif or symbol use was present as early as the Mousterian (Marshack 1976c). Certainly ritual burial and the use of ochre, symbolic artifacts, and pattern engraving occur before the evidence for repre- sentational or naturalistic imagery and "art." These archaeo- logical materials suggest, once again, that the near-iconic sym- bolic mode, like language, may have been generic. An irregularly shaped, nonutilitarian fragment of ivory (fig. 27) from Eliseyevichi is carefully incised with sets of parallel zigzags and some subsidiary motifs.

The flat surface has scraping marks which suggest that it was once part of a shaped artifact that had broken in use and thus become available for symbolic mark- ing. Each of the zigzags is attached to a line. The small zigzag at right, apparently the last to be engraved, is attached to a single line. Among the central zigzags, one is engraved towards the right and the other towards the left. Each is attached to a double line. Between these double lines is an incised "chevron" pattern which is, as we shall see, a simplified zigzag. The micro- scope indicates that each of the double lines is closed at one end by a stroke and at the other end by the edge of the frag- ment, which thus serves as a line. This closure of the double line suggests that comparable rectangular forms incised in sets along the edge of a plaque (figs. 16, 19) may in fact represent the double-line motif, which has been stylistically clarified for the maker as a unit or a set of two lines by the act of closing the form or pair. Each closing would separate that set of two lines from all nearby doubled lines and from other accumulations or sets of unit marks (fig. 16).

Rectangles, as objects or as phenomena, did not exist in the life or among the artifacts of the hunters of the Russian plain. They apparently were, how- ever, functional in the artificial realm of the symbol. The "geo- metricizing" of the band, as either zigzag, double line, or rec- tangle, may thus represent an aspect of motif use. The long lines to which zigzags are attached in the materials of the Rus- sian plain may likewise represent a marking strategy devised for delimiting the motif in order to make possible the accumu- lation of zigzag sets. On this piece, four zigzags have been ac- cumulated in a number of ways: sequentially, in parallel, and in conjunction. To the left of the zigzags is a faintly engraved vertical line with attached branches (fig. 28), a subsidiary motif of the type seen in mid-plaque in figure 11. Branching is one of the modes of cumulative marking that has been documented in the West- em European macaroni tradition (Marshack 1977). The ac- cumulation on this fragment was completed by the addition of subsidiary lines or motifs at the left. FIG. 26. Close-up of engraving on the fragment of figure 25, showing band sections at right angles to each other creating a zigzag form. 282 CURRENT A,NTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC SYMBOL SYSTEMS FIG. 27. Fragment of mammoth ivory (13.3 cm) from Eliseyevichi, incised with three zigzag motifs attached to lines and other sub- sidiary motifs. This style of accumulating zigzag motifs occurs on a more complex, shaped plaque from Eliseyevichi (fig. 29). It is a somewhat ovaloid and crescent-shaped plaque cut from the out- er layer of a tusk. Many of the motifs engraved on it are so eroded or worn that they can be recovered only by micro- scopic examination. These early motifs are overengraved by later, more sharply incised ones. Not apparent at first, but clear after microscopic examination, is the fact that the ear- liest engraving consists of two wide bands or double lines that extend the length of the plaque. Over these the subsequent motifs were engraved. At the far right, along the curve of the rounded point, is a deteriorated zigzag attached to a double line. In mid-plaque there is an accumulation of three zigzags similar to that in figure 28. It consists of one zigzag engraved towards the right and one towards the left, with a narrow band of zigzags be- tween. This middle zigzag band indicates that the usual motif, consisting of at least three zigzagging rows, can be simplified to two rows of marks at an angle, a "zig" and a "zag," as noted earlier in figure 18. The double lines which separate the zigzags are closed at one end by a stroke, as in the previous example. On the right half of the plaque are three double arcs (fig. 30). One arc is overcrossed by five lines, suggesting a later use of the arc. One arc has a band added, again suggesting a secondary use or renewal of the original motif. The arc at top right overcrosses an exceedingly faint and worn sequence of tiny marks and an earlier ladder motif. In the close-up we can see that there are many more lines to the accumulation than are visible in figure 29, documenting a rather lengthy periodic use of the surface. The reverse face of the plaque (fig. 31) has a subsidiary marking. There is one horizontal double line upon which a number of small, closed double lines rest. Other double-line motifs occur as well, some open and others closed at one end, again suggesting that they may represent schematizations and clarifications of the one motif. Microscopic analysis of another plaque of the same type from Eliseyevichi (fig. 32) provides data on an interesting sequence of accumulation. On the tip at far left is a zigzag attached to a long line, apparently the first motif incised on the plaque. To the right of the zigzag is a "geometric" form consisting of an upright with three attached branches, all made as double lines, recalling the simpler, more schematic motif of the single vertical line with attached branches seen in figures 16 and 28. The present carefully made image seems to be an elaboration of the others. Each branch of two lines is closed at one end to form a rectangle. This branched form was then overmarked with a complex series of motifs, each incised by a different point (fig. 33). The three horizontal branches were overengraved by a series of descending lines made by a dull, flat point, creating a crude ladder effect. After this, a linear, horizontal, double-line zigzag was attached to the lower branch. Then, attached to this zigzag and over- crossing it, four double-line motifs, two of them closed at one end, were added. Finally, a set of six lines, perhaps three double lines, was attached to the vertical double line at left, which had itself been attached to the zigzag, which had ear- lier been attached to the lower branch. The addition of six lines, or of three double lines, created a ladder effect between the vertical at left, the original line of containment of the primary zigzag, and the double line. The sequence has devel- oped in almost circular fashion, ending against the motif with which it began. The full sequence of attaching motif to motif involved over a dozen symbolic steps. The end result is a com- position that has a "geometricized" complexity. The same process and strategy is repeated at the right, be- ginning with a vertical double line and attached horizontal double-line branches. This time, however, the double lines are not closed at their ends, indicating a simplification of the earlier marking. This second branched form was used. like the other, by the addition of branches and by a marking of the branches. At the far right is a subsidiary marking consisting of linear sets. A similar subsidiary marking occurs on the reverse face. The total engraving involves an accumulation of motifs by various strategies, the primary cumulative modes being attach- ment and branching. FISH-AND-WATER ASSOCIATIONS A tradition of accumulating the fish and the zigzag and related motifs, including the double line, the branched form, the lad- der, the arc, and sets of linear marks, has been found in the Upper Paleolithic of the Russian plain on two classes of arti- facts: nonutilitarian fragments of ivory and chipped or broken plaques which may once have been functional.

Vol. 20 * No. 2 * June 1979 283</page><page sequence="14">we can analyze compositions in which these motifs assume a formal, schematized, and stylized form. In these compositions, the motifs may seem like decoration, but the cumulative mode by which they are made indicates that they are examples of periodic symbolic marking. A fragmented plaque from Eliseyevichi has a rough fishlike shape (fig. 34). Microscopic analysis indicates that there are two fish-scale or netlike patterns incised on it, one towards the right and the other towards the left, each attached to the same line but engraved with a different point and a different rhythm and spacing. Though the plaque is broken at left, the fish-scale motif is complete and ends by petering out. It is clear that these motifs were not intended to fill or to cover the surface but rather represent a meaningful pattern that was marked twice. The containing line to which they are attached has made it possible to delimit them and yet to associate them. To the right is a carefully incised multiple zigzag, again attached to a long line. Added to one of the fish-scale motifs is a subsidiary marking consisting of a long line with eleven short marks at- tached to it. Added to the long line containing the zigzag are sets of four and two marks. Additional sets of marks appear at the far right. These make the artifact look like a fish with a tail, but the impression may merely be the result of a later subsidiary marking such as those which have been discussed earlier and which are found on both faces of such plaques. If the zigzag motif is derived from the water-related band and the fish-scale motif is related to the cruder, abstracted fish motifs found at Timonovka, then we have on this plaque an exceedingly schematic and stylized association of water and fish motifs. It is impossible to determine which was the first motif engraved on this surface-the zigzag, the two fish-scale motifs, or the sets of linear marks-since there is no overcross- ing of these motifs. Whatever the sequence, though, it would probably have had its own meaning to the maker. A similar plaque of ivory, a deteriorating fragmented exam- ple from Eliseyevichi (Polikarpovich 1968: fig. 38), is on ex- hibit in the State Historical Museum, Moscow. Since it has been thickly coated with an opaque lacquer in order to pre- serve it, the engraving cannot be studied. However, a line ren- dition was made before the lacquering (fig. 35). There are five zigzag motifs, each attached to a long line. Between two of the zigzags is a band that has been marked to create a ladder effect, suggesting that the ladder may also be related to the band and be an aspect of the water symbolism. The band, apparently, could be empty or differentially filled and still function as the motif, though there may have been some slight variation in meaning. The mode of marking suggests a sequence: within the central group a zigzag motif was first attached to a line, a band or ladder was appended, the original zigzag was then com- pleted to make a neat join with the band, and, finally, a second zigzag was appended to the band at right. The association of fish and water may involve a relation of concepts or a sequence of concepts; this is an interpretive dif- ficulty that cannot be solved by any recourse to logic. A mark- FIG. 29.

The order could as easily be reversed. The semantic possibilities are endless. These two examples make it possible to analyze still more complex examples from Eliseyevichi. A fragmented, nonutili- tarian scrap of ivory (fig. 36) with much surface deterioration and flaking contains a complete engraving that is conceptually divided in two. On the right half (fig. 37) are two fish-scale or net motifs attached to a single line which has been partially lost to flaking. The motif at left, extremely schem,atic and crude, seems to have been made after the more carefully in- cised motif at the right. This half of the plaque also contains a number of new motifs or types of marking. At the right are two groups of tiny marks arranged in rows; other rows of such marks appear in mid-plaque. These rows were engraved as sets, documenting three or four markings of a motif consisting of rows of tiny marks. On each side of the fish-scale motifs are crude, intentionally engraved "streams," recalling the macaroni streams or bands of the Dolni Vestonice example (fig. 24) and the tradition of marking bands and streams in the Western European Upper Paleolithic (Marshack 1976b, 1977). Two lightly engraved rectangular forms were added at the far right. Assuming that the motifs accumulated here are related, we can essay a comparison with similar associations in the Western European Upper Paleolithic. Among the Romanellian and the Parpallo materials, rows of tiny marks appear often, sometimes alone but often in association with macaroni bands (Marshack 1977:figs. 7b, 14a). I have proposed that these may represent a rain aspect of the water symbolism as the band represents a stream aspect. If these suggestions are valid, then the motifs on this half of the plaque represent three aspects of the generic, water-related symbolism: fish, stream, and rain. Although re- lated and associated, they are not necessarily equivalent, either semantically or in the assumed ritual sequence of marking. The left half of the fragment (fig. 38) has the most interest- ing new forms and poses additional theoretical and interpretive problems. An engraved rectangle, partially open at one end, was quartered by an interior right-angle cross. Each of the quarters was then marked with from three to four lines. There are thirteen such lines in the quarters. A single short line con- nects the upper left quarter, with four lines, to the lower left, containing three. Attached to this quartered "square" is an an- gle, and associated with this are other forms and sets of marks. As I have said, we do not find rectangles or linear geometry among the structures or the artifacts of the Russian Upper Paleolithic, and therefore we can probably assume that the squared and angular forms in the symbolic materials derive from conceptual models. Such models may be cognitively simi- lar to those found in American Indian ritual sandpaintings (Reichard 1977 [1939]), where the quartered square represents a mythological, ritual universe, or to Australian Aboriginal sand- story compositions, ordered in a circle around a center which can represent a campsite or a waterhole (Munn 1973). Such conceptual models among preliterate peoples that have no for- mal geometry or arithmetic often assume ordered and quite complex geometrical forms. The literature on Asian shamanism is rich in examples of "geometricized" symbolism and imagery, including the center, the quarters, and horizontal levels of ascending and descending reality (Eliade 1951, 1952). Such models are usually supported by narrative and explanation, that is, they represent an ordered arrangement of places or events which may be mythological, ritual, or phenomenological. It is important that though they look arithmetic or geometric to us, these models do not represent an arithmeticized geometry in the modem sense. The capacity to model, however, is the same that is later used in science. Under the proper cultural conditions, these early traditions can be the precursors of arith- metic and geometry. This problem of precursive cognitive traditions and strate- gies has not been given much attention by archaeologists or prehistorians, perhaps because it is more psychological and anthropological than archaeological. I raised the problem ini- tially and peripherally in my discussion of nonarithmetic lunar notations in the Upper Paleolithic (1972b, c), notations based on models of periodicity but not, in our modern sense, either astronomical or calendric, since these terms presume a recog- nition of arithmetical periodicities. These nonarithmetic nota- tional traditions can perhaps be considered precursive of as- tronomy and the calendar (Marshack 1974). Many of the equinoctial and solstitial observations of the North American Indian were nonarithmetical and observational and, therefore, precursive of a calendar. The late Upper Paleolithic settlement of Mezherich, con- sisting of mammoth-bone houses on a rise near the conjunction of the Rosava and Ros' Rivers southeast of Kiev, has pro- vided a number of artifacts engraved in an evolved style but within the tradition under discussion (Pidoplichko 1969, 1976). A small, broken, shovel-like fragment of ivory (fig. 39) is in- cised with an accumulation of zigzag and streamlike motifs. Microscopic analysis indicates that the engraver carefully took into consideration the available marking areas and the edges of breakage, again suggesting that the artifact was not deco- rated but engraved after the rounded, functional bottom edge had fragmented. As far as can be determined, there are nine or ten zigzag motifs or subsidiary zigzag additions incised on the surface in a seemingly random placement. Two of the zigzags, along the Vol. 20 * No. 2 * June 1979 285</page><page sequence="16">right edge, are contained within horizontal lines to create a zig- zag band (fig. 40). A third zigzag is engraved parallel to the edge at far left and is contained by single lines (fig. 41). Sub- sequent to the engraving of these formal and contained zigzag motifs, a number of subsidiary zigzags were added. One of these begins at the edge of the break in the ivory and proceeds as a stream to meet other zigzag additions associated with the band at bottom right. A still more schematic stream is attached to the upper zigzag band at right (fig. 39) but was engraved after the fragment had been turned so that it ascends from the band as it is here presented. These streamlike additions recall the bands or streams incised as subsidiary motifs on the frag- ment of figure 37. A set of unbroken engraved strokes along the broken edge at bottom right indicates that these marks, like the remainder of the engraving, were made after the object had ceased to be functional. The sequential analysis of this composition documents the common tendency in an accumulation to proceed from the well- made or formal image to increasingly abstract or schematized representations of the motif. All the motifs on this spatula, though visually and stylistically different, are clearly related and may be semantically equivalent, that is, they may be ex- amples of the generic band, representing an aspect of flowing water. LINEAR SEQUENCES In 1972 I published the analysis of a notational sequence en- graved on an ivory tusk from Gontzi (1972a: figs. 5, 6), on the right bank of the Udai River (a tributary of the Sula) south- east of Kiev. On the Gontzi tusk, sets of marks were engraved along a horizontal containing line, with cue marks engraved above the line between the sets as the notation proceeded. Be- cause of this linear structure, it was possible to conduct arith- metical tests of the developing sequence of sets and subsets and to suggest that the notations may have been lunar (1972b: fig. 14). One reason I went to the Soviet Union was to subject the Gontzi tusk to microscopic examination in order to clarify the linear, sequential mode of notation. Unfortunately, it had been lost during the chaos of World War II and its aftermath. I did, however, find a few examples of counting among the Russian materials; among the artifacts from Avdeevo were some that contained sets of marks engraved on short contain- ing lines, suggesting a mode of structuring sets comparable to that on the Gontzi ivory. The Russian engravings also docu- ment a tradition of accumulating motifs along a containing line. It was the combined analytic data, suggesting the presence of varied and variable marking strategies with distinct regional styles, that made it possible to conduct an analysis of the most complex single composition yet excavated from the Upper Pa- leolithic of the Russian plain. _ ri BI ! z u-= - _ail li_ _ _ I .N.v l_ 1 , , _e_ l F _ _ _ S i I . _ 11111 _ _ | _ I . 1_ a - * S | ; _ . . __ | . . | . . . | . | - __ R R ! ! | E _, . i. w E _L ...

All these motifs are separately ordered along horizontal containing lines. Microscopic examination indicates that the drawing by Pidop- lichko (1969:fig. 58) is presented upside down, rendering his interpretation of the central geometric forms as possible "huts" unlikely. The analysis indicates that the upper row of ladder motifs was made as four discrete sets and not as the unit ren- dered in the illustration by Pidoplichko. Each set of ladders had its own horizontal containing line, which had been engraved by a different point, and its own cue marks indicating the be- ginning and/or the ending of a set. The first set of ladder motifs, at top left (fig. 43), has con- necting marks, or bars, between the ladders. Similar connecting lines are visible among the other nondeteriorated sets of lad- ders. The fifth and last set, engraved at left below the first, had been placed in mid-plaque in the empty area between a row of ladders above and a row of geometric forms below. This fifth set is itself an accumulation of ladder motifs and sub- sidiary linear additions, each motif engraved by a different point. This set as a unit and the ladders themselves have a dif- ferent size and spacing from the earlier sets. In conformity with the general tendency towards increasing schematization and simplification of sequential accumulations, the ladders in this set seem to have been made more quickly. They are made with many different points, rhythms, pressures, and angles of engraving. Apparently, the individual ladder as a motif, as well as sets of ladders as units, could be accumulated. On the right side of the plaque, within the free area below the upper ladders and under the third and fourth ladder sets, FIG. 32. Broken, shaped plaque of mammoth ivory (23.6 cm) from Eliseyevichi, incised with carefully structured geometric forms and one zigzag attached to a line. is a late, subsidiary addition consisting of double-line motifs and some single lines contained by a horizontal line. A still later subsidiary set was added to this by attaching another horizontal line and then marking within the delimited area. This mode of attaching sets to sets by first appending horizontal containing lines was also employed at the bottom of the plaque. At the bottom are two multiple zigzag motifs, one with three zigzag rows and the other with two, each attached to a hori- zontal line and enclosed by a second horizontal line to form a zigzag band. After these were made, two later horizontal lines were attached at left, and double lines were added within this subsidiary band area. This addition is similar to the one ap- pended to the ladders at top right. Sets of double lines were also accumulated between the zigzag motifs and the central geometric forms. We therefore have evidence of the accumu- lation of sets of motifs by placing them upon a line. In earlier examples, the same motifs had been accumulated in a seemingly more random fashion. Generally, each motif on the Mezherich plaque is accumulated within a group of similar motifs, and therefore the strategy does not represent a linear sequence of mixed or different motifs and images such as one finds in writing or even in pictographic recording. Neverthe- less, the strategies of linear sequencing tend towards such de- velopments. Attached to the longest single line on the plaque, engraved horizontally across its widest portion, are five narrow, rectan- gular motifs and four complex arced forms that Pidoplichko considered "probable huts." If one turns the illustration (fig. 42) 1800 to test the "hut" hypothesis, one is faced with a num- Vol. 20 * No. 2 * June 1979 287</page><page sequence="18">FIG. 33.

The horizontal to which the supposed "huts" are attached creates a flat roof with a rounded entry within which is a supposed hearth or fireplace. The actual mammoth- bone dwellings at Mezherich and other sites of the Russian plain, as reconstructed, had rounded roofs and rested on a flat ground, the exact reverse of the hut images conjectured by Pidoplichko. If the forms are, instead, viewed as presented in figure 42, they look like twin peaks between which a possible astronomical body is sighted. Since we have no evidence of astronomically aligned sightings or structures in the Upper Paleolithic, and since the terrain around Mezherich consists of rolling hills and valleys rather than of sharp peaks, it is difficult to affirm that these do represent peaks or observations. It is possible, however, that they represent "geometricized" or sche- matized hills, made in that regional mode which also sche- matized fish and water forms, but this cannot be proven. When one examines the twin-peaked forms by microscope, it seems that each was made by a different engraving point and that a different rhythm of engraving was used to incise the in- ternal zigzags and lines within each form, The images had been ik* FIG. 34.

Since I had found such black paint in many of the Russian en- gravings but knew of no reference to this technique of high- lighting engravings, I did not clean the plaque, except in a few microscopic areas where lines crossed. As a result it was diffi- cult to do cross-sectional studies of the geometric forms. The zigzags inside the peaked forms were apparently made with the plaque turned 1800; that is, they descend from the horizontal line. However, this tells us nothing about the proper position for viewing the peaked forms. We have seen sets of zigzags attached to a single line that were engraved in opposite directions, the ivory having been turned for the engraving of ~~~~~ - FIG. 37.

The peaked forms themselves stand on the hori- zontal and were engraved with the plaque held as in figure 42. The crude circles between the twin peaks and the five rectan- gular forms between the structures also seem to have been made at different times and by different points, with the plaque held as illustrated. It therefore seems that on this plaque we have an accumula- tion of peaked forms, rectangles, and circles comparable to the accumulation of ladders, zigzags, and double lines. Earlier, on a plaque from Eliseyevichi (fig. 29), we found three arcs placed in a seemingly random fashion within a composition containing zig- zags, ladders, double lines, and sets of linear marks. On that plaque the accumulation proceeded from the edges inward. On the Mezherich plaque, instead of filling up the surface by mark- ing from the edges inward, the engraver ordered his accumula- tions of motifs along separate, containing lines.

Vol. 20 * No. 2 * June 1979 289</page><page sequence="20">sequential mode of ordering similar motifs apparently repre- sents a cognitive strategy intended to clarify the process of motif accumulation. It is a strategy derived from the engrav- ing tradition and represents a development towards the formal structuring of motif accumulations, the creation, in effect, of a regional, cultural style. This is the manner, for instance, in which notational sets were accumulated on the Gontzi ivory at a site which was, like Mezherich, situated on a tributary of the Dnepr south of Kiev. The few examples of counting I was able to find, those at Avdeevo, a site located on a river also draining to the middle Dnepr, had notational sets engraved along containing lines. The use of the containing line is regional and differs markedly from the cumulative macaroni marking in the Western European Upper Paleolithic, which has more in common with the branching and attachment modes and strate- gies documented in figure 32. Assuming a tradition on the Russian plain of accumulating water-related motifs, we can consider possible interpretations of the central forms on the Mezherich plaque. Fish and water are "periodic," whether as natural phenomena or as concepts utilized in human activity. The periodic marking and use of these symbols may therefore have involved "time-factored" recognitions and concepts, even when these are not expressed in the images.2 It is therefore possible that such rare motifs as the quartered or squared image, the double arc, and the twin- peaked form are related to the water motifs with which they are associated. It is possible, for example, that the three dou- bled arcs (fig. 29) may have represented "sky arcs" or "rain- bow arcs" and may thus be signs of certain seasons; perhaps they were "year arcs" and represented the ending of a year and the beginning of another. Perhaps they were seasonal habita- tions or ritual structures, again representing some periodic as- pect of the practical or ceremonial life related to fish and water and also to a counting of days, events, or persons. The posing of such questions at this stage of the research is intended merely to open up areas for inquiry and theoretical discussion, with the possibility of future validation or invalidation. In the same vein of supposition, it is possible that the four twin-peaked forms (fig. 42) represent seasonal observations of the sun's solstitial or equinoctial position above the horizon. Perhaps the quartered image represents a nonarithmetic con- ceptual model involving seasonal and directional recognitions or a ritual structuring such as occurs in American Indian sand- painting and Siberian shamanistic ritual. Perhaps the thir- teen marks in the quartered square represent the number of "moons" in a lunar year divided into four seasons, with the single line connecting two quarters indicating the passage to the new year. 2 I introduced the concept of the "time-factored" image or sym- bol and artifact to help explain the periodic use of animal images (1970c) and the presence of periodic accumulations of notations (1970b, 1972a) that I was finding during microscopic study of the mobiliary artifacts. The concept proved its value when the re- search also began to produce evidence for the reshaping of broken tools and the subsequent symbolic marking or remarking of these secondary artifacts (1972b, c). It proved itself again when the research began to uncover the seasonal nature of many representa- tional images (1972a), of complex compositions (1970a, 1972a), and of certain depicted rituals (1972a). As a result of such find- ings it became clear that the images and compositions need not be "translated" or fully understood to be studied and compared. Their syntax, or modes of usage, could often be determined. Images and symbolic artifacts could be studied as aspects of the cultural con- tinuum, as point markers and visualizations of continuous and periodic cultural processes. f~~~~~~~~9 -n FIG. 39.

The site of Suponevo, on the Ri-ver Desna some 4 km south of Timonovka, has among its engraved artifacts a number of fishlike motifs similar to those at Timonovka, but one artifact is stylistically different. A rough, irregularly shaped fragment of mammoth ivory (fig. 44) is incised with "crude angles and zigzags" (Abramova 1967:44). The microscope shows that the engraving is complete, that it was incised on the fragment as is, and that it was carefully composed so that the base of each multiple angle touches at least one of the three broken edges of the fragment. It thus appears to be an accumulation or set of three motifs. If a similar set were made along a straight line or edge, it would be a horizontal variant of the zigzag. This mode of marking the zigzag band occurs in the Western Euro- pean Upper Paleolithic tradition (Marshack 1972a:figs. 43c, 52c) and in the post-Paleolithic of this area on the Russian plain (see figure 47 below). The true zigzag, of course, is con- tinuous. What we seem to have in the stylized example from Suponevo is the outcome of a particular strategy of marking the basic band in which each band section, consisting of multi- ple parallel lines, is attached to the next at an angle. The Avdeevo rib (fig. 25) shows this mode of accumulation, though here it was done vertically. This style is also found among the engravings from Romanelli (Marshack 1977). On the Supo- nevo artifact, the band sections are made horizontally, with one edge always serving as a conceptual line. Within the band- marking tradition these variants may be equivalent in meaning, indicating regional or temporal differences. From Avdeevo comes an incised artifact with a set of dif- 41 FIG. 40.

A nonutilitarian fragment of young mammoth tusk (fig. 45) has seven sets of cross-hatches, each incised with a different point and a different pressure and rhythm (fig. 46). These hatches were engraved during the same period and in the same area as the fish motifs and the fish-scale or net motifs. It is possible that they represent a schematization of one of these motifs. The nonlinear accumulation of hatches is similar to the accumulation of fish motifs on the artifacts from Timonovka (figs. 4 and 7), and comparable hatches also appear at Timo- novka. Breuil and de Saint-Perier (1927) documented se- quences of engraved fish among the Franco-Cantabrian mate- rials which also become increasingly schematic, ending either as ovals or as simple hatches. Some of these schematized fish are associated with zigzags, a relation of schematic fish and schematized water I had noted in other examples (Marshack 1972a:fig. 195b). At the farthest remove from Avdeevo within the European Upper Paleolithic, at El Pendo in Santander, Spain, one finds numerous examples of fish associated with the zigzag motif (Barandiaran 1973). One late-Magdalenian engraved fragment of horn has on one face a fish with a zigzag and two band motifs and on the other face three hatch or net motifs comparable to those from Avdeevo, each hatch made by a different point and apparently at a different time (pl. 47, no. 7). There is clearly no contemporaneous connection between these widely sepa- rated Upper Paleolithic cultures. Nevertheless, the modes of symbol usage are similar. With comparative data of this type we are faced again with profound theoretical problems. The presence of the fish as a major motif and of macaroni accumulations among the El Pendo materials (Marshack 1976b), in the Cantabrian caves of the same region, and as far south as La Pileta in the Milaga region (Marshack 1977) sug- gests that certain aspects of the widespread Upper Paleolithic symbolic tradition may have had common roots. These roots were at least cognitive, that is, based on common modes of perception and common strategies and modes of iconic-symbol use, if not yet acceptable as culturally derived and dispersed. The problem is not new. The dispersal of certain Paleolithic symbolic modes and motifs has for a long time been acknowl- edged, but we are here discussing a complex mode of abstract- ing and schematizing phenomenological and cultural struc- tures whose meanings were necessarily maintained by language and ritual.

The female images, the animal images, the decorative traditions, and the burial practices, from this point of view, would then be not separate traditions but specialized aspects of the more generalized H. sapiens sapiens tradition of artificial cultural modeling and symboling.

Concurrently, microscopic analyses of other excavated materials revealed that engraved animal images were often used and reused and at times overmarked by various motifs and signs (Marshack 1970c). It was found that female images could also be accumulated and used (1972a, 1976a). As the research progressed, it became clear that the tradition of periodic marking and accumulation was one of the fundamental modes of symbol usage throughout the Upper Paleolithic. With the accumulation of analytic data from different Upper Paleo- lithic cultures and regions, it became apparent that this mode of image making and use persisted into the Mesolithic and in some regions into the Neolithic, even though the Upper Paleo- lithic "artistic" tradition of realistic, representational animal and female images apparently disappeared (Marshack 1970d, 1972a, 1976c). As a result, substantial revisions have had to be made in a number of earlier published interpretations. The incised Mag- lemosian amber bear from Resen Mose, Denmark (1970d, 1972a), for instance, can now be seen to be an example of motif accumulation, involving ladders, zigzags, bands, and hatches, derived from the tradition discussed in this paper. Reexamination of the engraved Mesolithic artifacts in the Na- tional Museum, Copenhagen, indicates that both Western and Eastern traditions of the European Upper Paleolithic are pres- ent in the materials. The Western European macaroni tradition appears in the early Maglemose; the Eastern, more geometric tradition discussed here appears later. The two traditions merge in a distinctly regional style (Marshack 1976b). As part of my study of the Soviet materials, I searched for examples of Mesolithic engraving, either from the Russian plain or from the lake regions to the north. Clark (1975) had noted the visual similarity of the Eliseyevichi net motif to net motifs in Maglemosian engraving. He had also confirmed the presence FIG. 43.

The Mesolithic sites of Russia and the Eastern Baltic are shallow, and bone material is rare. However, an incised, non- utilitarian bovid jaw recently excavated (Berezovitz 1958) from a bog at Putivl, on the River Seim, within the area once in- habited by the mammoth-hunters, contains an accumulation of motifs that derives directly from the Upper Paleolithic of the Russian plain (fig. 47). The jaw contains a set of ladder motifs attached to a line, an accumulation of hatch motifs almost ex- actly like that on the Avdeevo ivory, and a series of multiple angles or zigzags attached to horizontal bands, which are filled with marking (one of these bands is attached to a ladder mo- tif). There are also sets of unit marks, and there is one zigzag along the bottom edge that is enclosed or contained by a hori- zontal line. Three schematic animals, their bodies filled with geometric patterns, are similar to animals found in the Scandi- navian Mesolithic, where they are also associated with the mo- tifs under discussion (Broholm 1924: fig. 15). In fact, the total composition is typical of the Scandinavian Mesolithic (Broholm 1924, Liversage 1966, Fischer 1974). The jaw was published as probably Neolithic, but it may be more accurately described as Neolithic of regional Mesolithic and Upper Paleolithic deriva- tion. The analytic data and the theoretical questions presented here have relevance for almost all the widely dispersed sym- bolic traditions of the post-Wiirm and, more particularly, for the rock art of all known preliterate, pre-writing cultures, from Eurasia to Africa to the Americas and even to Australia. The rock art evidences the same modes of image use, reuse, associa- tion, and accumulation as are found in the earlier Eastern and Western European traditions.

Different specialized areas of the brain and a different func- tional anatomy are involved in the use of language and the use of icon and image. Nevertheless, the level of evolved capacity and the cortical architectonics involved in these two modalities, including their associative functions, suggest that they are as- pects of one development and evolved together. It would prob- ably be impossible to develop complex, artificial iconographic traditions without language and impossible to have language without reference to the near-iconographic conceptual models implied in linguistic semantics. As a result, the same theoretical problems hold for the study of all prehistoric symbolic systems. The question of whether language was dispersed from a single origin or was repeatedly invented may be asked of these icono- graphic systems as well. If we assume the presence of certain regularities in the phenomenological and relational worlds of early man, similarities in the symbolic products referring to these may not be surprising, but this does not solve the problem of a possible dispersal of cultural strategies and modes. Within the Eurasian heartland and contiguous areas (perhaps, then, the human world), the periodic mode of symbol use and the presence of a water-related iconography are abundantly documented. One also finds a broad distribution of the animal image, the female image, the human or anthropomorphic image, and even the more specialized vulvar image. It is difficult to make any choice between diffusion and independent invention without more and better archaeological evidence. Wherever a FIG. 46. Close-up of the incised area on the broken tusk of figure 45, indicating the accumulation of the hatch motifs. water-related iconography appears in the cultures of the proto- historic and historic periods, there is an implied cosmological semantic. We may thus have evidence not of a diffusion of the motif, but of a fundamental human recognition of the seasonal, periodic, variable, and life-supporting nature of water-related phenomena.3 FIG. 47. Bovid jaw (40.5 cm) found in probable Neolithic context in a bog at Putivl, the Ukraine, with ladder, zigzag, hatch, and band motifs derived from the Upper Paleolithic (after Berezovitz 1958). 3Since I completed this manuscript, scholars in France and En- gland (Sauvet, Sauvet, and Wlodarczyk 1977, Bahn 1978) have sent me papers they say are in part based on my research. As in the work of Frolov (1974), the use of my ideas and data is per- haps some measure of their value. I have found, however, that what is usually involved is the acceptance of one idea, such as the presence of lunar notation or a water-related symbolism or the evidence for a variable use or meaning of an image or symbol. There has been no wide use or discussion of the principle of funda- mental cognitive modes operating in H. sapiens sapiens symbol manufacture and usage. It is this, if valid, that makes the analysis possible and the data important.

Three fish vertebrae the largest ca. .08 cm, excavated by B. Klfma at Pavlov, Czechoslovakia. ADDENDUM After this paper was accepted for publication, I visited Czecho- slovakia to confirm the presence and the rendition of the en- graved fish from Predmost (fig. 2). I again discussed the prob- lem of fish images in contexts where no fish bones had been excavated. Bohuslav Klima, at the museum in Dolni Vestonice, handed me a small vial containing three recently excavated, un- published fish vertebrae (fig. 48) from the site of Pavlov, ca. 27,000 B.C. They had been recovered by use of fine-sieve sifting and washing, a technique that had not till then been used by archaeologists in Czechoslovakia or on the Russian plain. When I reported the presence of fish vertebrae to American archae- ologist Olga Soffer, of Hunter College, who had excavated at Avdeevo and Mezherich with Soviet archaeologists in 1977-78, she informed me that she had personally examined and con- firmed the presence of eye lenses of fish of the carp family which had been recovered by Polikarpovich at Eliseyevichi by a test washing early in the excavation. Polikarpovich (1968) mentions these eye lenses in a few short sentences. Fishing, then, did occur. The small size of the vertebrae and the pres- ence of fish eyes but no vertebrae at Eliseyevichi may indicate the existence of a deboning process whereby a split fish had its spine and inner organs removed and was then hung up to dry with head and tail still attached.

I have long ad- mired the technique he has developed for recognizing, decipher- ing, and analyzing Pleistocene mobiliary and rock art. There is no doubt that he has added many interesting facts to our knowledge of these important documents of the activity of Upper Paleolithic man. His careful investigations have helped us to discover and/or identify animal figures and-what is even more decisive-to recognize such details as the open mouth and the hooked kipe of the fish on the "bdton" from Mont- gaudier, from which it can be determined that the Ice Age the artifacts themselves-the rigorous, intensive, and systematic firsthand analysis of each artifact and image and the equally rigor- ous study of the tradition within which the artifacts and images were made and functioned.

The methodology requires evaluation and validation and the theoretical bases of the research need discussion before ideas derived from them can be used in other research and theory. artist was depicting a male salmon in the season of spawning (Marshack 1970e). After so many years of theory and hypoth- esis about the interpretation of these documents, presuming magical or sexual conceptions, etc., precise observations that reveal what the prehistoric hunter-fisher consciously or un- consciously intended to depict are very useful and stimulating. It is clear that Ice Age man knew all the details of the animals upon which his and his family's lives depended. I am persuaded that the only way to approach the thinking that is hidden be- hind Pleistocene art is through a thoroughly objective analysis involving the collaboration of archaeologists, zoologists, and ethologists. Marshack's method will be very helpful for such a reexamination of the problem. On the other hand, I am not so happy about some of his in- terpretations of nonfigural engravings like those described here. Though his ideas are quite sophisticated, they seem to me far too hypothetical. When, for instance, he reports that "we do not find rectangles or linear geometry among the structures or the artifacts of the Russian Upper Paleolithic" and therefore assumes that "the squared and angular forms in the symbolic materials derive from conceptual models" and when he states that "a limited library of semantically related motifs is periodi- cally and repeatedly utilized," he may be right, or he may be wrong. Neither he nor anyone else can prove such hypotheses, and it is quite possible that others will offer divergent explana- tions for such motifs and accumulations. Again, it seems to me hazardous to refer to "American Indian ritual sandpaintings . . . where the quartered square represents a mythological, ritual universe" or to "the way in which Australian Aboriginal sand-story compositions are ordered" in attempting to inter- pret Upper Paleolithic engravings. One could equally well use contemporary folkloristic patterns from Europe to show that the same ladder, double-line, and zigzag motifs as on the Rus- sian finds are used extensively in a purely decorative sense. Maybe I am too pragmatic, but I think that the interpretation of Pleistocene art demands a great deal of caution. by JESPER CHRISTENSEN 422B Altair Place, Venice, Calif. 90291, U.S.A. 16 xii 78 Among the Russian Paleolithic artifacts discussed by Marshack is an ivory fragment from Eliseyevichi (figs. 36-38) which contains a quadrangular sign quartered by a right-angled cross. Marshack hypothetically interprets this sign as representing the idea of the four quarters of the world. On the same object is an accumulation of water symbols. On the evidence of the Russian material it is, apparently, not possible to explain this association of cosmic symbol and water images, and Marshack only concludes that a water-related iconography always has "an implied cosmological semantic." However, on artifacts and cave walls in Western Europe dating from the late Upper Paleolithic, one finds a set of numerical symbols-including the quartered quadrangle-used frequently and systematically in association with water images. I shall describe this symbol sys- tem and interpret it on the basis of the comparative study of religious phenomena. The symbolic numbers of the Western art contribute to a general understanding of the concepts un- derlying the accumulative use of water images. The symbols in question are strictly numerical: that is, they represent elementary numbers-"two," "three," and "four." The number "two," depicted by means of paired strokes or dots, is found on artifacts from the Mousterian (at La Fer- rassie; see Peyrony 1934; Muller-Karpe 1966: pl. 35, L) and is frequent in the later phases of French-Cantabrian art. On some decorated objects from Bruniquel (see, for example, Leroi- Gourhan 1968:fig. 207) paired strokes are arranged so as to form zigzag lines; by this device "two" is combined with a representation of "flowing water." The same design is juxta- Vol. 20 * No. 2 - June 1979 295</page><page sequence="26">posed with wavy lines and paired dots on an artifact from La Madeleine (Breuil and de Saint-Perier 1927:157, nos. 8 and 14). Another water-related form is seen on an artifact from Le Placard (Breuil 1912; Graziosi 1960:pl. 92h), where an un- dulating band with a side branch is composed of double strokes. In the cave of La Pileta in southern Spain one finds "meanders" associated with lines of paired dots (Breuil, Obermaier, and Werner 1915; Muller-Karpe 1966:168, no. 7; Breuil 1952:392, fig. 514). A piece from Isturitz (de Saint-Perier 1936) shows "two" marks placed on a schematic fish (fig. la). Fish forms are associated with doubled marks on a bone fragment from Gourdan (Breuil 1913:220; Chollot 1964:173). A roughly fish-shaped object from La Vache (Nougier and Robert 1970) contains a number of schematic fish images and several fish tails (fig. lb); a series of paired signs along the edges is a con- spicuous feature of the engraving. Another fish-shaped bone implement from Isturitz (de Saint-Perier 1936:73) contains a large fish and a field of paired strokes. "Two" and "three" are combined in the form of three sets of double marks. Two examples are found in the Lascaux cave; one is painted (Leroi-Gourhan 1968:414, fig. 323), while the other (Laming-Emperaire 1962; Leroi-Gourhan 1968: 516, XXXVII) is engraved (fig. lc). The same motif is painted in the Fontanet cave (Delteil, Durbas, and Wahl 1972). A piece of bone from Las Caldas (Corchon Rodriguez 1974: fig. 1) shows three pairs of long strokes surrounded by short "two" marks. In the Portel grotto three sets of "two" signs are executed on a natural rock shape that suggests the body of a fish (Beltrfan 1966); a drawing of a salmon, a surface with "meanders" (p. 168), and several "comets" are executed on adjacent wall faces (see the plan in Leroi-Gourhan 1968:361).

A similar arrangement is found in the cave of La Pasiega (Breuil, Obermaier, and Alcalde del Rio 1913:fig. 9; Breuil 1952:374). In the Pech Merle cave one finds an isolated panel with two groups of three dots, each group arranged in a triangle (Lemozi, Renault, and David 1969:pl. 2). The number "three," by itself, is also used as an element of water imagery, as seen on a bone from El Pendo (K6nig 1973:154) on which a fish is associated with sets of "three" signs (fig. le). An engraved fish in the Pindal grotto (Breuil 1952:381) is superimposed on three red dots. In the cave of Los Casares one finds groups of three fish set head to tail in a curious triangular design (Cabre Aguilo 1934:no. 7). Various signs indicating "four" are found in the cave of Le Gabillou (Gaussen 1964:nos. 147, 42, 146, and 185); they in- clude four parallel strokes, a square quartered by a right- angled cross (fig. lf), an isolated cross, and a rectangle with all four sides set off by double lines. In the Lascaux cave one finds four lines next to two squares, each made up of four verticals (Laming-Emperaire 1962; Leroi-Gourhan 1968:516), as well as crosses each consisting of four separate strokes (Breuil 1952:fig. 79). A combination of "four" and a water design is exemplified by some crosses and a zigzag on a staff from Lafaye (Pajot 1968: fig. 93). Two rows of four crosses each are drawn on a fish-shaped object from Laugerie-Basse (Leroi-Gourhan 1968: 400). A schematic fish is superimposed on a square in the dominant panel of the Tito Bustillo grotto (Jorda Cerda 1970: no. 26). Many squares and a great number of doubled marks are associated with large serpentine "meanders" in the "Sanc- tuary" of the Pileta cave (Breuil, Obermaier, and Werner 1915; Breuil 1952:392). A large square in the cave of La Mouthe (Graziosi 1960:pl. 270) is juxtaposed with a zigzag band. Asso- ciations of "four" and water images like these are close parallels to the designs on the ivory fragment from Eliseyevichi. A com- prehensive view of the numerical system as a whole-the func- tion of the numbers together-is required, however, to under- stand the full implications of this system. All three basic numbers of the system are distinctly combined in the mentioned design from Lascaux (fig. lc), in which three "two" signs are drawn inside a quadrangle, that is, "four." In the Tete du Lion grotto, two lines, one consisting of four and the other of three dots, are arranged in a carefully balanced figure (Combier 1972), a conspicuous element of the main panel. Two panels filled with dots and strokes dominate the big in- tersection of the Niaux cave; they contain the following numeri- cal symbols: "four," both in the form of four verticals and as four dots marking off a square; "three," as three dots in a tri- angular setting (once combined with the four black verticals, once alone) and as three dots in a line; "two," represented by numerous dots and short strokes; and "four" and "two" com- bined in two parallel rows of four dots each (Beltrian 1973). (,Different numerical signs ("two," "three," "four," crosses) are used to express complex ideas in a limited space in collections of decorated teeth from Duruthy (May 1962; Miiller-Karpe 1966:pl. 30D), St.-Germain-la-Riviere (May 1962; Muller- Karpe 1966:pl. 131 E2), and La Marche (Lwoff 1943:pl. 1). The most important feature of this system is the frequency with which it is associated with water designs. A square with an internal "two" mark in the Lascaux cave (Laming-Em- peraire 1962; Leroi-Gourhan 1968:516) is located in a small room the walls of which are covered with "meanders" and "comets" (Marshack 1977: 303; Leroi-Gourhan 1968: 415) . Among the engraved teeth from Duruthy are one with a fish and one with a zigzag line (Muiller-Karpe 1966: pl. 30 D, 1 and 7). On a staff from La Madeleine (Capitan and Peyrony 1928; Miller-Karpe 1966:102, no. 15) one finds a schematic fish which has four dots arranged in a square on its body and three dots arranged in a triangle on its tail; another fish on the same object is marked with two rows of three dots each. On a bone knife from Laugerie-Basse (Breuil 1935:fig. 1) a cross is combined with a schematic fish and a net/fish-scale design (fig. lg). On another object from the same site (Girod and Massenat 1900), a large cross is found together with rows of dots that might represent, as suggested by Marshack in another context, a "rain aspect of the water symbolism" (fig. lh). The arms of the crosses just mentioned are made up of, in one case, double strokes, in the other case, triple lines; by this device, "four" (cross) is combined with "two" and with "three." The design on a bone from Gourdan (Breuil and de Saint-Perier 1927:105) unites "water," "three," and "four," by means of a zigzag combined with a straight line so as to make four triangles in a row. A richly decorated staff (fig. li) from the same site (Chollot 1964) has two large salmon at the top and a zigzag running around it, as well as a field of tiny strokes (rain?). Among the numerical signs on this object are three strokes, two crosses, and, possibly, "two" marks (the wounds on the deer). Apparently, the numerical system refers to a coherent set of concepts. For the symbols that pertain to the number "four," the widespread concept of the world's four quarters is the most plausible basis for an interpretation. Marshack refers to the mythical and ritual lore of the North American Indians in suggesting this explanation of the quartered square from Elise- yevichi. K6nig (1973) argues that the "four" signs of pre- and protohistoric,European art represent one of the earliest known conceptual models of the world. She renders a right-angled cross on a circular object excavated in Hungary and dated to the Mousterian; another cross from a Mousterian level is re- ported found in the Caucasus (Archeologia, March 1976, p. 69). The major part of K6nig's book is devoted to a discussion of the number "three" and its usage from the Paleolithic to historic times. She considers "three" to be the capital symbol for defining time; it is typified by the three phases of the moon- waxing, full, and waning-and represents the idea that time is renewed periodically. To K6nig, a combination of "four" and "three" is a total image of the world, uniting space and time. The symbol "two" has not, to my knowledge, been given a satisfactory explanation. By analogy with the suggested cos- mologic significance of "three" and "four," it can be assumed that "two" represents one of the most widespread ideas about the ordering of the world: that creation starts with the separa- tion of sky and earth. Hereby the two polar regions of the world appear. In the opinion of Eliade (1972:240), this idea is "one of the leitmotiven of universal mythology." "Two" de- fines the vertical and "four" the horizontal dimension of the world. In the cave of Bayol, which has the shape of a twisting and descending corridor (see description and plan in Leroi- Gourhan 1968:392), a number of "two" marks are set in a con- spicuous location: precisely at the point where the visitor loses sight of daylight. The "two" signs here mark the boundary between the realms of light and darkness, between sky and earth. The accumulative usage of water images described by Mar- shack (1977) clarifies the function of the numerical system: the presence of cosmogonic numbers in repetitive designs indicates that the creation and ordering of the cosmos can be "repeated." Eliade has demonstrated that the focal point of early religious beliefs is, precisely, the concept of an "eternal return." Any renewal of vital powers is brought about by ritually repeating the original act whereby the cosmos was created. In Eliade's (1972:412) words, The creation myth, in addition to its important function as model and justification for all human activities, also constitutes the archetype Vol. 20 * No. 2* June 1979 297</page><page sequence="28">of a whole complexus of myths and ritual systems. Every idea of renewal, of beginning again, or restoring what once was, at what- ever level it appears, can be traced back to . . . the notion of "the creation of the cosmos." The symbolic numbers of the Paleolithic material are readily explained on the basis of this idea. "Two" and "four" signify the events whereby the present world order was constituted: the separation of sky and earth and the fixing of the cardinal points. Engraving or painting these two sets of signs was a ritual whereby the creative act was repeated; the use of the symbols served to reconstitute the cosmos. By this reenact- ment of the original event, time was recreated, too. Eliade points out that "the notion of regeneration is bound with the conception of a new time" (p. 407); "the symbolic repetition of the creation . . . regenerates time in its entirety" (p. 402). "Three," according to K6nig, indicates that time is renewed in cycles. In consequence of Eliade's exposition it can be said, more precisely still, that "three" represents the renewal of time following a ritual "repetition" of the creative act that took the place at the dawn of the cosmos. The practice of associating numerical signs and water images finds a plausible explanation in the fundamental concepts about water discussed by Eliade: "water symbolizes the whole of po- tentiality; it is . . . the source of all possible existence" (p. 188); "water purifies and regenerates because it nullifies the past, and restores ... the integrity of the dawn of things" (p. 195). If one assumes that such ideas were present in the Upper Paleolithic, a consistent picture emerges: the water images were used as the main symbols of the renewal of life powers, and the application of the numerical marks to the water designs was a means of implementing the ritual repeti- tion of primordial creation. The complexity of the design on the mentioned piece of mammoth tusk from Eliseyevichi is largely explainable against the background of the Western material. The quartered square on this object contains 13 interior strokes, indicating the 13 lunar months of a year. Thus this symbol represents the equa- tion of "world" and "year" that is essential to many New Year rituals recorded in historical times. In any case, the presence of the cosmic sign along with different sets of fish- scale designs, rows of dots, and "streams" indicates that the concept of an "eternal return" was present at the time when these engravings were executed and that this "return," or recreation, was the purpose of those rituals of which only the accumulative images survive. by ALEXANDER GALLUS 2 Patterson St., Nunawading, Victoria 3131, Australia. 20 xii 78 Recently I have been occupied with a reinterpretation of the semantics and purpose of the "meanderoid" tradition in Aus- tralia, a modification of my first attempts (Gallus 1977). As for its "origins," the most archaic stage seems to be an exclu- sively nonpictorial ("near-iconic," "abstract") facies on bone fragments in the Acheulian and Mousterian of Western Europe (Marshack 1976c:276-79; 1977:289-92), on pebbles in the Mousterian of Hungary (Vertes 1965:pl. 12, 5; G'abori-Cs'ank et al. 1968:pl. 42), in a cave in Hungary (Vertes 1965:pl. 42), and in the oldest parts of the Western European cave sanc- tuaries, where it persisted into the pictorial stage and later. It is present continentwide in Australia. In the present essay, the finds from Timonovka appear to be less advanced than the rest and must be judged with the oldest tradition. They cannot be analysed in a common interpretative effort with the others. My comments refer to conceptualiza- tions derived from this archaic stage alone and include only the Timonovka finds. 1. The term "symbolic artifact" is anachronistic and ethno- centric. Every artefact satisfies a need and is "functional" when in the judgment of the understanding actor (Gallus 1976) it is effective. The term "symbolic" derives from modern ideas about whether an artefact or action really influences the en- vironment as intended. This judgment relates to the cognitive universe of modern man and cannot be projected into the past as an absolute (cf. Jarvie 1976, 1977). 2. I agree that the engravings were not "images intended to be seen" and that the "act of marking" was all-important. Consequently, the markings cannot have been intended to "participate" in the efficacy of anything else, nor were they accumulated "intentionally" to convey some meaning. They were a single-purpose activity performed at recurrent intervals. The image remained visible, because it had been engraved in a medium which retained it. Old images might be overengraved or the engraved object discarded because the images were spent, having served their purpose. The association between the se- quential externalizations was not spatial, but mental (neu- ronal). The individual images are minimal visual clues (Megaw 1967:395, 397-98; 1970:22; Gombrich 1972:373). I regard every single act of externalization of the minimal visual clue as an evocation of psychic contents ("engrams" [Gallus 1977: 384, after Margenau 1950:54-74]). Culturally it satisfies a par- ticular recurrent need. The externalization of the same clue associates with (evokes) the same preexistent cognitive memory complex. If the "evocation" was seasonal, why was it needed? Suppos- ing that man's thinking had not yet reached a level of abstrac- tion permitting him to grasp the regular return of the vital seasonal phenomena, one could argue that the externalization of the clue was needed to insure their reappearance. The phe- nomena had to be "evoked" by influencing the environment in the right place, at the right time, with appropriate action. From observations in Koonalda I have concluded that the agency to be influenced was a mana-like experience which had been projected into the environment in the form of an indepen- dent force or power which controlled or caused the needed phenomena (Gallus 1977:376-84). The seasonal changes had to be evoked by contact with the governing agency, and contact could only become efficacious in the right place, at the right time, and by means of the right minimal visual clue. On the neurophysiological level, this evocative contact can be understood as an association of the externalized minimal visual clue (taking the form of a sense impression) with a pre- existent cognitive engram (the mana concept). Since the mana concept is experienced as permanently projected into the en- vironment, the contact event, occurring on a neuronal circuit, is experienced as contact with reality outside man. 3. I agree with Marshack that the seasonal need involved the evocation of rain, but the spiritual contents must have been much richer than that alone. 4. The mental processes involved are predominantly visual. The associations are made between visual memory traces and "inner" experiences of man's decision-making and willed ac- tivity, which must be the basis of mana or "agency" concepts. No evolved "language" is needed to understand this archaic stage. 5. The Australian scene cannot be left out of any compara- tive analysis. by JOEL GUNN Division of Social Sciences, University of Texas at San An- tonio, San Antonio, Tex. 78285, U.S.A. 19 xii 78 Marshack and his traveling microscope have provided the com- munity of persons interested in prehistoric information systems another body of high-resolution data. Certainly the most thought-provoking aspect of the article is its comparative na- ture. In research projects as original and innovative as Mar- shack's, the real insights often do not come to mind until the 298 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="29">Marshtack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC SYMBOL SYSTEMS strong light of comparative perspective is cast on the masses of empirical data. For future reference, I would point out that ecological conditions and lithic technology suggest that the southeastern United States may have been an area of Late Pleistocene high culture similar to southwestern Europe and Eastern Europe. It would be very interesting and informative for Marshack to turn his comparative attentions to that area with the intention of resolving questions of the origins of New World big-game hunters. While reading Marshack's discussion of fish symbols in the Russian plain, I could not help but think about the very im- portant function fish play in the diet of high-latitude-dwellers. Since sunlight is weak, vitamin-D synthesis on the skin may be insufficient for the body's needs. Fish provides an abundant alternative source of vitamin D. One writer has pointed out that the classic Neanderthals may have suffered from chronic vitamin-D deficiency. Fishing is a necessary condition for effective human life in reduced sunlight and may have ac- counted to some extent for the success of Homo sapiens sapiens over Neanderthals (Loomis 1967). Certainly the necessity of maintaining fish as a component of the diet would have been symbolized and ritualized by Late Pleistocene people into some sort of "Think Fish" ethic. The reminder need not have been consciously transmitted, however. It could have been em- bedded in the everyday ritual of life. The fish symbols re- covered today may represent totems or even an arbitrary vo- cabulary of fish-related symbols for things like "Meet me at the river." Marshack's inquiries into meanders seem to me to be the most revealing aspect of his work. In a previous article he has indicated that meanders may be the oldest and most persistent representation made by man (Marshack 1977). The idea that a meander represents a "point marker" or symbol of change has fascinating implications. Mammals in general are designed to detect motion and change in their environment, as a means of either preying or avoiding predation. Curves are particularly important relative to motion. For instance, when pursued in the hunt, animals execute curves as a means of avoiding cap- ture and death. Humans often locate their camps near curves and junctions in rivers and streams, since these are usually topographically advantageous places. It seems plausible that when humans first turned to recording their perceptions they would have dwelt on the theme to which they were most bio- logically and culturally attuned, a change of motion repre- sented by lines that turn and dodge. I am intrigued by the idea of composition. Most, though certainly not all, modern art forms show the beings and things of the natural and cultural world in empirical relationships to each other. Generally we prefer representations that look like photographs. As Leroi-Gourhan has pointed out, late Upper Paleolithic artists hardly ever utilized such natural composi- tions, preferring instead to represent apparently mythic rela- tionships. As Marshack points out, meanders and various marks have been considered by most authorities as just prac- tice for subsequent realistic representations, which someone finally stumbled onto by accident. If I read him correctly, he is arguing for a precedent, developed and self-contained tradi- tion which consisted of meanders and the like. Such a concep- tion lends itself to a very interesting analysis of the evolution of art. To set the stage, I would suggest that we too often think in terms of the contents of art galleries and Sistine Chapels when we consider prehistoric art. Cartooning is perhaps more akin to prehistoric efforts. Cartoon characters are typically shown in an abstract fashion, with meanders, etc., to mark the prog- ress of the individual being illustrated. It is easy to visualize prehistoric cartoonists marking the course of the individual they are considering, be it animal, human, or spirit, with an array of meanders. This is, after all, the most important aspect of observation to the unsophisticated mammal/human: motion and change in motion. The ripple and flow of water in a stream or dust in the wind are natural examples suggestive of such representations. Later, crude representations or symbols of the meandering individuals were added and in time became impor- tant in their own right. The next and perhaps most significant break with the pri- meval, "motional" tradition was when artists of the represen- tational school began to incorporate the impression of motion into their representations. When I was a graduate student, I visited Lascaux, thanks to the generosity of Mme. Guichard of the Les Ezyies Museum. I was mystified by the herd of horses on one wall, specifically by the way they held their heads. Years later, I was watching a John WVayne movie and realized that horses hold their heads in that peculiar way when they are crossing a river. The artist at Lascaux was apparently representing the motion of river crossing. As is typical of civilization, we have specialists who perform difficult tasks such as exact-perspective representations of ani- mals or humans. For many of the less specialized and less talented of us, motional art is still a viable pastime. by ARNE B. JOHANSEN Arkeologisk museum i Stavanger, Postboks 478, N-4001 Stav- anger, Norway. 28 xii 78 Marshack's paper is a real eye-opener. Its main value is the basic viewpoint it offers on prehistoric "art." With this idea as eyeglasses, much of our old material will speak to us in a new way. Reading this paper is like standing on the threshold of something new and fascinating. Prehistoric "art" is not necessarily to be considered as the more or less skillful attempt at depicting or representing for decorative purposes something in the "real" world. Rather, it is to be regarded as the end product of complex syntactic symbolic behaviour in a social context, perhaps most closely related to language. Of course, Marshack is well aware that numerous other points of de- parture are equally possible, but we have to start somewhere and get out of our fixed positions. Marshack's help here is most welcome. To me the value of the basic idea so dominates that my criti- cal comments become almost invisible: The paper provides no clear and detailed presentation of the method used. I should especially like to have had better documented the clues to the cumulative creation of the en- gravings. Are the indications of such accumulation strong enough to preclude alternatives such as that the artist created the whole image at one time, using different tools (perhaps they broke in due course)? In a banal way, of course, every line or bundle of lines is accumulated, because at each moment only one small part of it is being executed, but I suppose the author means more than that. Marshack does not go deep enough into the problem of being human. He should try to look at man more holistically. For instance, under what conditions did prehistoric man feel a need for making symbols on bone and stone? In the countless settlements and other sites where not a trace of symbolic be- haviour is preserved, is it because people were not in that symbol-needing situation, or is it because they expressed their symbols in perishable materials like sand, dust, or water? Or is it perhaps because the distinction between symbolic and nonsymbolic behaviour is far less clear than Marshack believes? What, for instance, is the difference in symbolic value between a very elaborate and expensive flint arrowhead or slate knife and an engraved fragment of mammoth tusk? Marshack would perhaps answer that the arrow and the knife were intended for practical use while the decorated tusk had only an "ideologi- cal job" to do. This is not a satisfactory answer, because it presupposes a knowledge of the living societies in question Vol. 20 * No. 2 * June 1979 299</page><page sequence="30">which neither Marshack nor I have. I am, for instance, equally ready to believe that an engraved reindeer rib had as much survival value for a tundra hunting community as a handful of arrowheads which could be replaced in a few minutes from the nearest lump of flint. Similarly, I can be convinced that a perfectly polished, brown-green banana-shaped slate knife was totally unfit for any practical task. Where, in fact, is the divid- ing line between "tools" and "symbolic artifacts"? Another elaboration of Marshack's ideas I am eagerly wait- ing for is a more thorough discussion of the relation between the two forms of symbolic behaviour: engraved tusk fragments and sound sequences (language). The beginning of such an elaboration is found in his 1976 CA article, but the foundations are not well developed. Both in that paper and in this one, Mar- shack seems to take for granted that creating language (sym- bolic behaviour) is necessarily some sort of abstracting of es- sentials from the raw picture of the world as it presents itself to man. I do not believe firmly enough that language has that origin. (Neither do Kant, Wittgenstein, Whorf, Feyerabend, and many others.) Perhaps instead language creates the world for us? The process starts when the first beam of light hits the eye of the newborn child (at the latest) and goes on until death. The ability to create a language in this broad sense of the word is a necessary condition for having any organized experience of the world at all. Man is the language-able creature. The world cannot present itself to man at all before man has a language (is able to manipulate symbols). Therefore, I look forward very much to the next paper from Marshack, which I hope will be on something like "The Epis- temology of Prehistoric Man." by ZBIGNIEW KOBYLIN'SKI and URSZULA KOBYLIN'SKA Swierczewskiego 94/115, 01-016 Warszawa/Instytut Historii Kultury Materialnej Polskiej Akademii Nauk, ul.

Sposrod roznych intryguj4cych problemow poruszonych w tym swietnym artykule, zwrocimy uwage na tylko jeden. S4dzimv, ze autor powinien wyrazniej sprecyzowac pokrew- ne i nie zawsze rozdzielane pojecia znaku i symbolu, co wy- jasni1oby szereg nasuwajacych sie nam w4tpliwo9ci. Jesli bo- wiem owe mikroryty mialy ((prywatny)), nie przeznaczony do publicznego ogl4dania charakter oraz nie byly przeznaczone do pieczolowitego przechowywania, to jawi4 sie nam one jako jakosciowo rozne od takich pozniejszych symboli, jak np. przedstawienia lodzi w Skandynawii od epoki br?zu po sred- niowiecze, czy krzyz w chrzescijanstwie, ktore pelnily wazn? rol~ w spolecznym komunikowaniu sie, jako przedmiotowe rejestraty pamiDci kulturowej. W tym swietle rysuje siD znacz- ne zroznicowanie przedmiotow nazywanych ogolnie sym- bolami. Jedyn, cech, wspoln, takich przedmiotow pozostaje wowczas ich znakowy charakter. Pod pojeciDm symbolu pro- ponujemy zatem rozumiec wyl4cznie nieprzezroczysty semanty- cznie czyli posiadaj4cy funkcjD poetyck, wg okreslenia R. Jakobsona (Guiraud 1974:11-12) albo ukierunkowany na same- go siebie wg semiotykow radzieckich (Zalizniak, Iwanow, To- porow 1977:70-71) znak postaciowy, oznakowuj,cy bezpos- rednio postrzezenia zymstowe (Wiercinski 1976:105), multi- wokalny (Turner 1975:55), posiadaj,cy duz, zdolnosc mode- luj,c, i wzbudzaj,cy stany emocyjno-motywacyjne, przez co percepowany jest jako tozsamy ze swym desygnatem (Wasilew- ski 1977:110). Marshack stwierdza, ze wykryte przez niego systemy sym- boliczne s,, przynajmniej po czDsci, abstrakcyjne, ((prawie iko- niczne)) i w zwi,zku z tym spoleczne przekazanie informacji o ich znaczeniu wymagalo pomocy jDzyka. Jesli rzeczywiscie zgodzimy sip, ze symbole te byly dla ich tworcow abstrakcyjne, tak jak dla ich wspolczesnego odbiorcy, a nie reprezentuj,ce (przedstawiaj,ce) i oczywiste (konieczne), jako, ze percepcja rzeczywistosci i sposob jej odwzorowywania zalezny jest od spoleczno-kulturowej praktyki danej grupy, to wowczas wyla- nia siD problem rozwoju i nastDpstwa historycznych sposobow artykulacji swiata, ktory zwykle przedstawiany jest jako na- stDpstwo dwoch odrDbnych sposobow myslenia: prewerbalnego, analogicznego i werbalnego, abstrakcyjnego (Wygotski 1971: 178-93). Uniwersalna ludzka cecha tworzenia symboli zwi,- zana jest wowczas z mysleniem analogicznym, zmystowym, a nie abstrakcyjnym. Tworzenie symboli i ich uzywanie w spole- cznym komunikowaniu sie zwi,zane jest z niemoznosci, racjo- nalnego zrozumienia rzeczywistosci i jej artykulacji w werbal- nym, syntaktycznym jDzyku. Symbole stanowi, ten rodzaj znakow, ktore odnosz, sie wprost do wDzlow skojarzefn zym- slowych i nie wymagaj, obecnosci myslenia werbalnego; jesli zas dyskutowane przez autora "symbole" s, wg niego abstrak- cyjne i wymagaly wytlumaczenia jDzykowego, to ich zwi,zek z desygnatami nie byl konieczny lecz konwencjonalny, a zatem nie byly symbolami lecz po prostu znakami.

Symbol zwerbalizowany, ujawniony przestaje byc symbolem (Czerwinski 1973:129). Obecnos tych samych symboli w roznych miejscach wynika zatem nie z dyfuzji ich wyspecjalizowanych znaczen ani z ist- nienia wrodzonych archetypow, lecz z podobiefnstwa spolecznej praktyki powodujacej podobn, percepcjD rzeczywistosci oraz z uniwersalnych ludzkich kluczowych doznan zmystowych, ktore zawsze musz, byc symbolizowane-w tym sensie proponujemy mowic o symbolach archetypowych. Jesli jednak zgodzic siD z autorem, ze w badanych przez niego artefaktach widoczna jest abstrakcyjnosc, nawet z tendencj, do formalnego modelowania rzeczywistosci, to wynika z tego, ze owe dwa sposoby myslenia od poczatku, a co najmniej od momentu powstania jDzyka (blizsze okreslenie tego momentu rowniez pozostaje dyskusyjne), biegly rownolegle, ze zmie- niajqc4 siD tylko w czasie proporcj, wainosci na korzysc mysli abstrakcyjnej.

[The great importance of this article consists in the fact that it will stimulate discussion of questions seldom raised in archae- ology. The article is heuristic and contains a number of ideas which are of value not only for archaeology, but also for other sciences dealing with man. It is, in the first place, an attractive presentation of the highly effective method of microscopic analysis of mobiliary artifacts and a summary of the results obtained in the investigation of materials from the Russian Upper Paleolithic which have revealed the presence of possibly symbolic markings. This aspect of the article has special value in that it enlarges the repertory of archaeological investigative methods and broadens our knowledge of the spiritual culture of Paleolithic society through the attempt to decipher the con- crete meanings of individual markings. Thus it can also be treated as a contribution to "comparative symbology," since it increases our knowledge of the varieties of symbolic systems and illustrates the universality of the need for the symboliza- tion of certain meanings. Finally, the article can be treated as a contribution to our understanding of the intellectual develop- ment of man because of its ideas on the origin of abstract thought and art and the hypothesis of man's innate compe- tence in the sphere of symbolization, i.e., his capacity for the creation and utilization of symbols. Of the various intriguing questions discussed in this excellent article, one deserves special attention. We believe that the author should have defined more clearly the related, but not always sufficiently distinguished, concepts of symbol and sign, as this would have clarified a number of controversial points. If the micromarkings had a "private" character, not designed for public viewing, and were not meant for careful preservation, then they appear to us to be qualitatively different from such later symbols as the representations of boats in Scandinavia from the Bronze Age to medieval times or of the cross in Chris- tianity, which have played important roles in social communi- cation as objects of cultural tradition and memory. It appears that the term symbol, as it is generally used, covers a great variety of objects whose only common feature is the fact that they are signs. We suggest that "symbol" be reserved exclusively for the representational sign which is semantically opaque, i.e., in the words of R. Jakobson, has a poetic function (Guiraud 1974:11-12), or, as Soviet semioticians would have it, is self-reflective (Zalizniak, Ivanov, and Toporov 1977:70- 71); directly signifies sense perceptions (Wiercinski 1976:105); is multivocal (Turner 1975:55); and has a high capacity for modelling and evokes emotional-motivational states and there- fore is perceived as identical with its referent (Wasilewski 1977:110). Marshack maintains that the symbolic systems he has dis- covered are, at least to some extent, abstract, "near-iconic," and that making their meanings socially understandable re- quired the aid of language. If we accept that these symbols were abstract for their creators, just as they are for their con- temporary viewer, rather than representational and obvious (determined), then, since the perception of reality and the manner of its representation depend on the sociocultural prac- tices of a given group, there arises the problem of the develop- ment, and its stages, of the historical articulation of the world. This development is usually presented as the succession of two different modes of thought: one preverbal and analogical, the other verbal and abstract (Vygotsky 1971:178-93). In this scheme the universal human propensity for creating symbols is connected not with the abstract, but with the analogical, phase. The creation of symbols and their utilization in social communication reflect the inability to understand reality ra- tionally and to articulate it in a verbal, syntactic language. Symbols constitute the kind of signs which relate directly to knots of sense associations and do not require verbal thinking. If, however, the "symbols" discussed by the author of the article were, as he thinks, abstract, and if they required verbal ex- planation, then their connection with their referents was not necessary, but conventional, which means that they were not symbols but simply signs. One should note here that in many contemporary "primitive" cultures the creation of symbols and participation in symbolic behavior go hand in hand with the inability to articulate their meaning in language, since to ar- ticulate something linguistically means to translate it into the logic of verbal categories, and this is impossible in the case of symbols. A symbol which is verbalized, explained, ceases to be a symbol (Czerwifnski 1973:129). The presence of the same symbols in various localities re- sults not from the diffusion of their specialized meanings or from the existence of innate archetypes, but from the similarity of social practices, which brings about a similar perception of reality, and from the basic universal human experiences which are always symbolized. It is in this sense that we should speak of archetypal symbols. If, on the other hand, we agree with the author that the arti- facts studied by him exhibit an element of abstraction and even a tendency toward the formal modelling of reality, then it is necessary to conclude that from the very beginning, or at least from the beginning of language, the two above-men- tioned modes of thought developed side by side (a more precise determination of when this happened also remains problematic) and only the relative importance of the abstract mode changed with time. In such a case, one should speak not of two different stages in the development of thinking, but of a continuous and fluid transition from the preponderance of the logical to the preponderance of the abstract mode. This thesis might find support in the hypothesis regarding the location of the two modes of thinking in the two hemispheres of the brain and the preponderance of one mode over the other resulting from social training through positive-negative reinforcement (Pare- des and Hepburn 1976:27). It might also find support in Pia- get's studies of the ontogeny of thinking, which have shown an almost parallel development of pictorial and operational elements in the thought of children, with the difference that the development of the operational element takes longer (Piaget et al. 1967:152-99). This leads finally to the problem, also discussed in Marshack's article, of the "generic" character of the ability to create ab- stract "symbols," analogous to the problem of the "generic" character of the ability to use language. One must ask whether the capacity for abstraction and symbolization is innate or genetically transmitted as Chomsky considers linguistic com- petence to be. In both cases it is impossible to give a firm an- swer in view of the present state of the biological sciences (Schaff 1972). Even if the ability to create abstract "symbols" is passed on genetically, it remains true that particular symbols and their meanings are inherited culturally as part of the semiotic system of a given culture.] Vol. 20 * No. 2 June 1979 301</page><page sequence="32">by WILLIAM BREEN MURRAY Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad de Monterrey, Mon- terrey, Nuevo Leo'n, Mexico. 28 xi 78 Marshack's paper merits close study, and his methodology of microscopic analysis provides a new and valuable tool for re- search into prehistoric art. Yet after careful reading I remained unconvinced by his central arguments, and I would like to di- rect my remarks to at least three factors which led me to this reaction. First, the objects are presented without any consistent place- ment in archaeological contexts which would permit functional analysis. This may be due to deficiencies in excavation which are not remediable at this stage, but the loss of such context is crucial, particularly when-as in the case of the fish-scale motif-the available archaeological data do not support Mar- shack's interpretation (cf. Klein 1973:50-51). Although I have nothing against internal analysis, I think it must be supple- mented whenever possible by contextual data if we are to avoid misleading subjective projections about meanings. Second, when the geometrical motifs are as generalized as straight lines and zigzags, identification of the markings as intentional does not in itself establish that they form a "com- position" or are symbols of cognitive processes. The hard fact is that geometrical shapes are essentially uninterpretable un- less (a) they can be reduced to a representation of something whose significance can be independently established (the basis of the fish-scale argument), or (b) archaeological or ethnological data can provide some kind of external clue. Frankly, I know of no species of fish with two different kinds of scales on its body like that shown in figure 34, and I agree with Marshack that ethnographic analogies are a dangerous basis for interpret- ing pieces this old. Finally, there is an unresolved problem of grouping. Mar- shack's enthusiasm for a linguistico-symbolic interpretation leads him to gloss over many details of superposition which his own microscopic study amply documents. The many hands which carved on the pieces, the varied orientations from left to right or right to left, the differing conditions of line wear, and the possible utilitarian antecedents of some pieces all sug- gest that they may have been used for a relatively long period of time and for many different purposes. Marshack may well have lumped pieces and motifs which belong to radically dif- ferent time periods and cultural/functional contexts and whose only real unity is that they happen to be found at present in East European museums. A review of the microscopic data led me to an alternative nonartistic hypothesis which takes into account the random- ness and simplicity of at least some of the markings. Marshack mentions the prior use of some pieces to extract bone for instru- ments such as needles and awls. The discovery of an ivory fishhook at Predmost is also suggestive. Is it possible that the discarded bone was used to hone or test such implements? In this case some of the straight lines and zigzags might be sharpen- ing grooves or "doodles" much as we might produce on a scratch pad while testing a ball-point pen. I suspect that microscopic analysis might shed further light on the instrument used to produce the markings and wonder whether Marshack would care to comment on whether this angle was ever considered, and, if so, what his -data show. by OSAGA ODAK Institute of African Studies, University of Nairobi, P.O. Box 30197, Nairobi, Kenya. 13 xii 78 I am deeply interested in Marshack's work, particularly in the analytical method he introduces into the study of prehistoric art. The subjection to microscopic examination of mobiliary artifacts from archaeological excavations in the Russian plain, particularly from such celebrated sites as Timonovka, Eliseye- vichi, Avdeevo, Mezherich, and Suponevo, forces us to re- examine in a new light the interpretations based on traditional methods. The revelation through microscopic study of details such as the sequence of work in the process of engraving, the procedure followed, the tools employed, the direction taken, the periodicity of marking, and such subsidiary but important information as the marking of objects after they had lost their utility adds flesh to the already built-up skeleton. The artifacts reexamined by Marshack had been studied at various times from 1935 (Gorodtsov) to 1976 (Pidoplichko). Previous studies either concentrated on some aspects of archae- ology, the engravings being secondarily treated if at all and sometimes not treated (e.g., Boriskovsky 1958; Gorodtsov 1935; Pidoplichko 1969, 1976; Polikarpovich 1940, 1968), or were principally preoccupied with studying the engravings themselves through traditional methods (e.g., Abramova 1967, Frolov 1974). The latter group of investigators' interpretation of the role and function of the engravings is not at variance with the observations provided by recent or modern ethno- graphic enquiry and visual examination, namely, that the pre- historic art was either used for religious purposes, had magical intentions, or was connected with ritual practices. New dimen- sions to the study of prehistoric art are being opened up by the work of Marshack, who, on the foundations laid by the "visual" investigators, is developing and perfecting the estab- lished techniques through the use of the latest available in- struments. Microscopic analysis is but an extension of visual examinations of the engravings on artifacts. Marshack's observations concerning the notational and pre- arithmetical association of some marks, if proven, would be a considerable contribution to solving the problem of the origin of writing and mathematics. His attempt to link the symbolic patterns with language and human physical types will ob- viously be viewed with disfavour, however, since it presents theories that are difficult to prove. Marshack writes that "the analytic data and the theoretical questions presented here have relevance for almost all the widely dispersed symbolic traditions of the post-Wiirm and, more particularly, for the rock art of the known preliterate, pre-writing cultures, from Eurasia to Africa to the Americas and even to Australia." This view assumes that "the modes of image use, reuse, association and accumulation" among these "preliterate" peoples are not as old as the pre-Wurm symbolic systems of Russia and Western Europe, since meaningful com- parison is possible only in the post-Wiirm period. This assump- tion ignores the fact that, contrary to the commonly held no- tion, Africa's prehistoric art is as old as Europe's. A fragment of rock art within a dateable context was excavated at Apollo II Cave and was found to be contemporaneous with the earliest recognisable mobiliary art under discussion (Wendt 1976). Al- though a tradition of engraving on movable artifacts is rarely found in Africa's prehistoric art, motifs like those described by Marshack in reference to Palaeolithic systems on the Russian plain and in Western Europe are not rare in some parts of Africa. The difference is that the available markings of which I am aware are on exposed rock surfaces, for example, at three sites in the Kisii district of South Nyanza in Kenya. The motifs inscribed on the mammoth ivory from Timonovka (fig. 2) and Eliseyvichi (fig. 13) and on the bone fragment from Dolni Vestonice (fig. 24) and the linear engravings illustrated in vari- ous figures (particularly figs. 44, 45, and 46) are all observable on rock surfaces at these sites. Discovered by Ongesa Elkana of Kisii Teachers College, one of these has been reported by Bower (1973: 137-38). The sites near Nyabigena Primary School, like the one at Muoma village, are littered with small isolated rock surfaces on which engravings are abundant. Three other sites are found at South Maragoli in Western Province, Kenya. Within veins of apparently intrusive feldspar on granite tors are found engraved lines constituting motifs, some of which are analogous to motifs engraved on the artifacts from the Russian plain (e.g., from Mezherich). I am inclined to think 302 CUIRRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="33">Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC SYMBOL SYSTEMS that the Maragoli engravings, with a number of motifs (includ- ing groups of parallel lines enclosed within other parallels, which in turn are attached to horizontal, slanting lines to form angles and arcs of various lengths) are comparable to the pre- arithmetical or pre-writing notations described by Marshack in a number of his publications (e.g., Marshack 1972; 1977: esp. pl. 31). Some of these rock markings are large enough to warrant de- tailed visual examination, while many more are so minute that their detailed study calls for a magnifying glass. The exposure of these objects to a variety of natural deteriorating agents makes it sometimes difficult to differentiate between natural and artificial markings, and this demands the use of a micro- scope. In this context, visual and microscopic study can be complementary rather than mutually exclusive. If Marshack's microscopic method can be of use in examining large areas of exposed rock outcrops, we would wholeheartedly welcome it. In examining the engravings in Kenya, however, we are faced with the problem of dating. Marshack is lucky in that the arti- facts he examined have been more or less securely dated. The marks in West Kenya are difficult to date. I am convinced, however, that their detailed study will reveal their stylistic similarity and perhaps contemporaneity with the European en- gravings on mobiliary artifacts studied by Marshack. Reading Marshack's paper, one wonders why and where he draws the line between symbol systems and art. To my way of thinking, art is not confined to the decorative patterns with aesthetic content executed on an object, but comprises a totality of evidences of human behaviour, including the notational and associated systems which are the subjects of Marshack's study, irrespective of their functional implications. Finally, I wish to state that while Australian natives, some Africans (see Odak n.d., Gramly 1975), and aboriginal Ameri- cans have recently executed art on rock surfaces for ritual, re- ligious, and other sociocultural purposes, or still do so, this does not draw them closer to the executors of the Palaeolithic art on the Russian plain or in Western Europe. The intricacies of Palaeolithic man's social behaviour that called for the execu- tion of the symbols are unknown, and the scant information that Marshack's new method has placed at our disposal is not enough to warrant such comparison. Reply by ALEXANDER MARSHACK New York, N.Y., U.S.A. 10 ii 79 I hope that the absence of substantial commentary from special- ists in the Paleolithic and post-Paleolithic archaeology of Eu- rope, due perhaps to the return date set within the year-end holidays, will be remedied by continuation of the discussion in CA. In the meantime, the receipt of a range of comments re- lating to semiotic and semantic problems and of commentary from Australia, Africa, and the Americas referring to regional symbolic traditions and analytic problems offers the unexpected opportunity to extend the theoretical discussion to these areas and problems. It will allow me to discuss the validity of using limited prehistoric analytic data in cross-cultural comparisons, a problem posed by both Odak and Bandi. Koblifnski and Kobli'nska discuss problems relating to gen- eral semantics, semiotics, and epistemology more than to the analysis and interpretation of archaeological data. Since these general problems are fundamental to any discussion of symbol and the evolved human capacity for symbolizing, it will be necessary to spend some time clarifying what are the most difficult questions posed by any of the commentators. I will attempt to reply in terms of the archaeological data. One cannot easily differentiate between representation, icon, sign, and symbol in the early archaeological materials. An in- cised baton perce from the cave of Veyrier at Saleve, France (de Mortillet 1868, Breuil 1912), was one of the first examples of Upper Paleolithic art to be excavated in Europe. It has a male ibex engraved on one face and a plant in full leaf on the other. The style is late Magdalenian and naturalistic. Another early example of Upper Paleolithic engraving, excavated about the same time, is a realistic mammoth incised on a nonutili- tarian fragment of ivory from La Madeleine, France (Lartet and Christy 1865-75: B pl. 28). It was the accumulation of such recognizable animal images that led to early 20th-century theories of hunting magic. When I cleaned the protective coat- ing of wax from the Veyrier baton and examined the ibex by microscope, I found that there were exceedingly faint incised darts in the animal, one in the chest and another in the head near the eyes. This seemed, then, a true example of "hunting magic." As I continued to work through the body of Franco- Cantabrian materials, however, I found that the image of the male ibex appeared quite often among the mobiliary materials in relation to plant images representing the spring. Often these ibexes in a spring context had been "killed" (Marshack 1970a, 1972a). When I examined the mammoth from La Madeleine, I found that it had been used or renewed a number of times- that it had at least four backs and four or five trunks. This use and reuse of a single animal image I found to be a major tradition in the Western European Upper Paleolithic (Mar- shack 1970c). For the analyst these data posed a problem. Were these naturalistic images art, symbol, icon, sign? Was the quick addition of a later schematic and nonnaturalistic, near-iconic eye, ear, muzzle, back, trunk, leg, or tail any different in mean- ing or intent from the engraving of the original naturalistic animal image? Did the image of the male ibex and the spring plant, and perhaps even the real or symbolic sacrifice of a male ibex in the spring, represent a mythologized ritual and relation that referred to neither plant nor ibex but rather to a third, undepicted entity which represented the change of season? Did the apparently "private" engraving of an extra eye, ear, muzzle, back, or dart represent a traditional, cultural mode and act? If so, was this secondary marking more impor- tant than the schematized image that was being marked? Was each addition symbolic of a comparable or equivalent use of the animal image? These questions indicate the difficulty in at- tempting definition, interpretation, and classification in terms such as those raised by Koblinski and Kobli'nska. The accumu- lating research data suggest that animal images or motifs could be used in different ways and in different contexts. In some uses an animal was renewed, in others killed; in still others it was associated with a range of nonrepresentational signs and symbols. Some of these uses were "private," occurring in miniscule scale on mobiliary artifacts, and some were "public," occurring on the relatively open walls of a cave. Kobli'nski and Koblin'ska refer to the Christian cross as a "public" symbol communicating a traditional meaning. If the cross were at some future time to be found only archaeologi- cally, without any supporting linguistic or mythological con- tent, archaeologists might describe it as an architectural ele- ment, found at the top of ritual or sanctuary structures. They would also find it inside the sanctuary, here usually associated with an image of killing. They might therefore describe it as a probable instrument of torture or death (which it was at one time in Rome), and they might note that this act of killing or sacrifice had the central place in the sanctuary and presum- ably therefore also in the culture. This would be only partially true and represent only one symbolic aspect of the culture. How could the archaeologist determine from the central "pub- lic" image of Christ on the cross, or even from any of the sub- sidiary illustrative panels in the sanctuary depicting the Vol. 20 * No. 2 June 1979 303</page><page sequence="34">crucifixion narrative, that it was also an image of life and resur- rection and that it played a role in a mythologized spring cere- monial, the Christian Easter? Further, the image of the cross would be found in graves, in homes, and as an image that went to war on banners, shields, and swords and around the necks of soldiers as an amulet or pendant. There would, how- ever, be no evidence that it could be used in ritual at times of birth, baptism, illness, or dying, that it was also a "private" participatory symbol when it was gestured as the "sign of the cross," or that such private and schematized uses were far more prevalent than the public appearance of the image in sanctuaries or homes. Archaeologists would find an odd bit of functional evidence: the figure on the cross in the sanctuary, and often the cross itself, would be worn down in certain places (for example, on the toe of the figure or at the base of the cross) by repeated touching suggestive of a private, participatory, and noniconic ritual performed in the public, ceremonial place. (Evidence of this kind of touching occurs also in the Upper Paleolithic caves.) It is clear from these suggestions that the meanings and uses of the cross could not be adequately categorized, interpreted, or translated, though the data available would, of course, be significant and indicative of certain aspects of the "syntax" or use of symbol or image. The archaeologist with some knowl- edge of ethnography would assume that any single example or use of the image may not have involved the full linguistic component that culturally adhered to it. Nevertheless, he would also assume that the persistence and transmission of the image required linguistic support and explanation. No con- temporary Christian can explain all the meanings (affective, behavioral, cognitive, cultural, historical, etc.) adhering to the image of the cross. Going beyond the image itself in the Chris- tian tradition, the cross is also used as a conceptual model for a tripartite division or structuring of the spiritual world, an aspect of the tradition that would not be found archaeologi- cally in any of the materials mentioned above. All this may in part be what Koblin'ski and Koblifnska mean when they say that the meanings of symbol cannot be verbalized. The diffi- culty, however, adheres not only to the syrnbol as image or as product and object, but also to the culturally specified ways in which a particular symbol is used. The macaroni motif in the Western European cultures (Mar- shack 1977) and the fish, zigzag, ladder, and net or scale motifs on the Russian plain cannot be fully translated or interpreted. They certainly cannot be adequately explained by reference to contemporary theories concerning image, symbol, and myth, whether of Freud, Jung, Marx, or Eliade, or by analogy with data derived from ethnography. For one thing, we do not have any linguistic reference; for another, we do not know the con- texts. We can, however, make certain determinations concern- ing the strategies involved in their accumulation and use, and these may be suggestive. On the Russian plain, for instance, the zigzag not only is used as a private, ritual, participatory motif on nonutilitarian fragments of ivory, but also appears as a "public" motif at Mezin, where zigzag designs are painted in red ochre on mammoth bones which may have been used as percussion instruments and are incised as a decorative element on carved, schematic female images (Shovkoplyas 1965). If we assume that the motifs are water-related when they appear as participatory images, then their use in these other contexts would suggest that they were more than representations of water and were, indeed, aspects of a wider, encompassing mythology. They were probably symbols, then, in the sense to which Koblinski and Koblifnska refer. Our difficulty in in- terpreting them, however, is due not to the fact that they are symbols and therefore unexplainable, but to the fact that we lack contextual referents and relevant productions in any other mode. The problem Of interpretation is, then, not as simple as these commentators imply. Much that is verbalized in a culture, for instance, cannot be verbally explained, not only because of the poetic inferences that are possible, but also because language can be used as symbolic images and gestures are used, as a marker in social relationships or in ritual and ceremony. A verbalized cliche of ritual greeting may have as little explain- able meaning to the performer or the recipient as a gestural cliche of ritual greeting or an engraved cliche of ritual mark- ing. It may be not the product (statement, gesture, or image) that carries the weight of meaning, but the participatory act itself. No matter what the mode of production, such symbolic cliches are always used culturally in the proper mode, at the proper time, and in the proper context. They may have no meaning outside of such cultural contexts. Archaeologically, therefore, we are faced with a special problem. All that we have for study are the products of cultural behavior that hap- pen to have been made of imperishable materials and that have been accidentally retained in the soil or on a protected wall. Yet human symbolic activity occurs equally in all modes. As far as the brain is concerned, there is probably no preferred mode, though different cultures may specialize in production in various modes and language itself can perhaps be used symbolically in more varied and specialized ways than can can image or gesture. It was a fundamental error of early attempts at interpretation of Upper Paleolithic image and symbol to assume that if the image was recognizable it could be compared analytically to images known ethnographically. The interpretation of hunting and fertility magic for the animal and female images was one result. Similar errors were made in attempting to interpret the nonrepresentational images; sets of marks were called hunting tallies, geometric forms were called traps and pitfalls, hand- prints were termed images of sacrifice or signs of a visit. Gallus, in attributing the Australian macaronis to acts involving mana, and Christensen, in taking all the examples of two, three, or four marks that he finds in the literature as evidence of nu- meration, fall into this error. The road to even partial under- standing of early symbol is difficult and requires systematic, methodical firsthand study of the materials and the traditions of which they are a part, in terms both of contemporaneous complexity and of regional developments and changes in the traditions. Gallus (1971, 1977; Wright 1971) is the discoverer of strati- fied remains in the cave of Koonalda (ca. 20,000 B.C.), the earliest and most important of the prehistoric marked caves in Australia. Recent studies have put the appearance of Homo sapiens sapiens in Australia at approximately 35,000- 30,000 B.C. (White and O'Connell 1979), roughly the period during which other groups of H. sapiens sapiens appeared in Europe (ca. 38,000-35,000 B.C.). A careful comparison of the indigenous nonfigurative marking that was made by these different hunting-gathering peoples at opposite ends of the earth should be enlightening, since it can be assumed that in discussing the macaronis in Koonalda Cave we are dealing not with a dispersed tradition or style but with a com- parable mode of noniconic or near-iconic marking. The mac- aronis in Koonalda Cave (Edwards and Maynard 1969) at first glance look exactly like those in the Upper Paleolithic of France and Spain. Gallus (1977) notes that "meanderoid" marking has been found throughout Australia. I should add that nonfigurative engraving on mobiliary artifacts of stone is also found in prehistoric contexts throughout Australia. Gallus (1977) has presented his own analysis of the Koonalda Cave macaronis, accompanied by an interpretation of pre- historic symbol based in part on the Jungian concept of a genetic, subconscious neuronal form of archetypal perception. This is the basis of his rather cryptic remark that "every single act of externalization [is] an evocation of psychic contents ('en- grams') . .. [and that] the externalization associates with (evokes) the same preexistent cognitive memory complex." The attempt to explain the origirns or interpret the meanin!gs of 304 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="35">Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC SYMBOL SYSTEMS early symbol by recourse to heuristic philosophical or psycho- logical models instead of systematic analysis of the available materials represents a traditional Western approach to the study of art and image. The concepts of mana and the arche- type, used in this way, are instances of this approach. Such generalizations do not aid us in formulating analytic methodolo- gies or programs for research either into the nature or uses of prehistoric symbol or into the Koonalda Cave system of mark- ing. I should like to approach the Koonalda Cave images and some of the other prehistoric Australian images differently- not in terms of modern ethnographic or psychological models, but analytically, in terms of the internal evidence derived from Australia, and comparatively, in terms of the contemporary European materials. In the cave of Tuc d'Audoubert in the Pyrenean foothills of France, there is a complex, incised macaroni on the low ceil- ing of a chamber deep in the cave, possibly of early Aurigna- cian derivation. The accumulation begins with a number of engraved serpentine lines emanating from a long crack in the ceiling; then, by branching and extension, the macaronis inter- lace the entire area around the crack. (These macaronis are now being prepared for publication by R. Begouen.) I have found incised macaronis emanating from cracks, holes, and deep corners in other Franco-Cantabrian caves, among the en- graved macaronis on fragments of stone from Parpallo in Spain and G6nnersdorf in Germany, and among the Romanel- lian materials of Italy. They seem to represent a strategy of marking that is utilized where a natural fault occurs on the marking surface and are probably related to the general se- mantics of the tradition and the concept of the flow of water. A river runs through the cave of Tuc d'Audoubert. In 1975 I presented my methodology, mode of inquiry, and findings concerning the European macaronis to a graduate student from Harvard, Christine E. Sharpe, in preparation for a preliminary study she was to undertake of the engravings in Koonalda Cave with Gallus in 1976. In the report of this study (Sharpe and Sharpe 1976:128-29), special note is made of the association of [incised] lines with holes in the boulders. . . . on one corner of [a boulder] are two deep interlocking holes. The area in and around these is profusely engraved ... [On another boulder] the greatest concentration of lines is around and pointing away from small holes. . . . [There is] a superb example where two lines emerge from a natural hole and run some seven inches down the stone; there are no other lines around. .. . Some sixteen natural indentations in the limestone are surrounded by carefully extended groups of parallel lines and herringbone patterns. The Sharpes conclude (p. 130) that "the most striking place- ment is the connection lines have with holes.... the longest most complete lines are often directly above crevices in the cave floor, etc." These data and others (Edwards and Maynard 1969) suggest that the Koonalda Cave markings are not random and were not intended to achieve some general mana. Certain motifs and strategies were involved related to anomalies in the rock (holes, cracks, crevices, gullies) suggesting places of exit, entrance, or hiding. There may be a range of such strategies and usages that can be determined. In the European Upper Paleolithic caves, rock features and anomalies were often incorporated into images and compositions, and Leroi-Gourhan (1965) has noted the relation of particular areas of a cave to certain classes of image and composition. Such comparisons and analogies do not suggest an equivalent semantics, but they do suggest certain common cognitive modes of symbol usage, the use of natural features in the environment. If we tentatively suggest that the macaroni tradition at Koonalda Cave may also be involved in a water-related symbol- ism, ritual, and mythology, we can attempt to enlarge the range of inquiry to see what related data can be obtained from Koonalda Cave and from the Australian symbolic tradition. Koonalda Cave, on the arid Nullarbor Plain of South Austra- lia, contains a lake that may have provided drinking water in the dry season to the early Aborigines of the area or to the prehistoric miners of flint nodules who worked in the cave (Wright 1971). Many of the Franco-Cantabrian caves in which macaronis are found also contain lakes, pools (La Pileta, Gar- gas), streams, or rivers (Marsoulas, Tuc d'Audoubert) or have water dripping from their ceilings or walls (Pech Merle, Rouf- fignac, etc.). On the basis of complex internal evidence in the European tradition, I earlier hypothesized that the macaronis represented a water-related symbolism (1977). There can be no direct or dispersed relation of the European tradition to that in Australia. If, however, the proposed preliterate and pre- artistic mode of near-iconic ritual marking was common among early H. sapiens sapiens cultures, including even the use of red ochre in the near-iconic mode, then it may be pos- sible to suggest that a water-related symbolism was involved in the marking of macaronis in Koonalda Cave. If so, the Koonalda Cave marking may represent an early regional example of what would appear later, both archaeologi- cally and ethnographically, as a highly evolved water-related iconography, ritual, and mythology. The water-related and ser- pentine mythology, iconography, and ceremonial of the Austra- lian Aborigines are in fact voluminously documented, as are the indigenous mythologies that involve the exit and entrance of spirits and ancestors from springs, caves, rocks, holes, and other natural features of the environment. A near-iconic mode of marking is also well documented (Munn 1962, 1966, 1969, 1973, 1974). Since I am dealing with archaeological materials and their analysis, I return to these. There are two bodies of prehistoric materials in Australia, cyclons (Black 1942) and unworked stones (Cooper 1947, Dortch 1976) incised with noniconic and near-iconic "geo- metric" marking. These have been little examined for the same reasons that the European incised materials have received little systematic study: there has been no methodology, theory, or comparative data with which to begin. The Australian stones are available because they have happened to survive and not because they were primary or major symbolic items in the prehistoric Australian cultures. Nevertheless, they are there, and our present method of inquiry may enable us to obtain data of relevance to the Koonalda Cave tradition of marking and the more complex and evolved iconography known eth- nographically. In the Darling, Paroo, and Warrego River valleys of western New South Wales, more than 100 conelike stones of hammered and ground limestone, slates, and- quartzite have been found. Similar stones occur as far away as the Northern Territory (Black 1942). These are the cyclons, a name derived from their cylindrical, conelike shape. They are often quite heavy and large, up to 4-5 lb. or more, and at least half are incised with linear marks. No two have the same pattern. Present-day Aborigines have no idea as to their use or meaning, though a few 19th-century informants suggested that they had once been variously used. These stones have an added oddity: the cir- cular flat base of the cone often shows flaking due to percussive action, as though it had been used to pound the earth. McCarthy (1967:63-64) wrote: The simple line motifs on the cylcons represent the earliest art of the Australian Aborigines, to which were added some of the motifs- radiate, barred, oval, herringbone-of the Linear Design Period.... Thus, cylcons were in use probably from a very early period of occupation until the pecking phase of recent times. Unfortunately, no information about their meaning or function has been obtained from the Aborigines, primarily because the linear motifs were pre- historic in this region. It is generally believed they had a ritual significance.... A microscopic study of the cylcons in collections in Canberra and Sydney in 1974 revealed that some had as many as four, Vol. 20 * No. 2 * June 1979 305</page><page sequence="36">five, or six percussion flakes missing at the base, often docu- menting a sequence of breakage and weathering over extremely long periods. Some flakes were totally weathered and worn, al- most obliterated, while others were relatively fresh; often a newer flake cut into a worn ancient flake. Allowing for a normal rate of surface deterioration for such stones, these se- quences of breakage seemed to span generations. Since even the cylcons with apparently fresh flakes were at least 100 years old, it is possible that some cylcons had been in use for hun- dreds of years. Occasionally a fresh engraving crossed over an old and worn flake. In some instances red ochre had been ap- plied over all the flakes. The microscope also indicated that some sets and groups of engraved marks had been worn down and were almost obliterated, while others immediately adjacent were newly cut. On the harder cylcons of slate, such accumula- tions seemed to have occurred over long periods. On the softer limestone, a different strategy of sequential use was found. Not only were sets of marks periodically incised on some of the softer cylcons, but some seemed to have been regularly ground down so that the surface was wiped clean. This process resulted, finally, in a smaller, less elongated cylcon. The con- temporary tradition in Australia of preserving ritual or cere- monial objects such as churingas for long periods and of periodic painting or engraving to renew such objects is well known. So too is the beating of rhythms either against sticks or on the earth during song and dance, perhaps indicating one possible use of the cylcons and reason for their flaking. The cylcons have a variable marking: sometimes sets of linear marks (fig. 49) that look like similar marking in Upper Paleolithic Europe, sometimes circles, emu tracks, ladder patterns, or serpentine water-like patterns. Often there is a mixture of motifs, some made earlier and some later. The combined iconography sug- -~~~~~4 Z .. ~~~ ~~~~ .. ...... . ::".. . ... :!. .':'..: s - v 2 - V S F ? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~ ~ ~ ~~--- ------ *.: ... ..... . .. :::. . :. ... FIG. 49. Details of the engraved linear sets on a prehistoric slate cylcon (43.8 cm) from Wilconnia, N.S.W., Australia, indicating the engraving by different tools and at different times. The detail above shows a hole marked along its sides, suggestive of the Koonalda marking around holes; the one below shows two emu tracks engraved over the earlier marking. gests a variable mythological, ritual, and ceremonial use for these objects. Among the interpretations for the cylcons that were gathered from informants in the 19th century (Black 1942:20-24) were some claiming they were used in rain-making, in ceremonies "for the purpose of increasing the supply of snakes," "in ceremonial observances connected with the assembling of people at the time the mardoo seed was ripe" and "in incantations for caus- ing the supply of game and other food to increase, for the making of rain and other secret ceremonies." These are some of the uses known ethnographically for the engraved and paint- ed wooden churingas. On the churingas, water holes and spirings or places in which water snakes or spirits lived or disappeared were often imaged as circles, lines leading to or from or sur- rounding them being related to mythological events. A near- iconic mode of water-related marking can perhaps be suggested for the prehistoric and contemporary Australian tradition. This marking sometimes looked like the European water- related images, but the two surely had different uses, accom- panying mythologies, and developments. From the point of view, however, of the hypothesized general, preliterate mode of noniconic or near-iconic marking, the two traditions are comparable, since they result from essentially the same cogni- tive and perceptual processes, skills, and capacities and since both entail a concurrent use of elaborate supporting linguistic structures. These iconographic systems or complexes were al- ways cross-modal and took their relevance from special cultural contexts and usage. A rare stone churinga from the Aranda tribe of Central Australia (Mountford and Walsh 1943) is incised and pecked with two designs made at different times, each design showing differential weathering and wear. The designs relate to the wandering of two mythological ancestors associated with the bringing of rain to the many parts of the country through which they travelled. At the end of their journey, it is said, they went into the ground in a boggy place adjacent to the Finke River. The design includes concentric circles representing the places or water holes, animal tracks, and serpentine lines repre- senting movement and wandering. The churinga was used in rain-making ceremonies. If we add to these ritual, mythological, and image-making traditions the Australian mode of incising rocks to make them bleed in order to induce rain (White 1974:17) and of incising the flesh to cause blood to flow for complex ritual purposes, we begin to see that there is a rich ethnographic evidence for nonlinguistic "cognitive" strategies, structures, and modes that can, in theory, be involved in the prehistoric marking and that can to some degree, perhaps, be studied diachronically, synchronically, geographically, and comparatively. A funda- mental aspect of all such studies of regional symbolic modes and traditions would involve a study of the evolved cross- modal H. sapiens sapiens capacity for symboling as well as studies of brain function in changing cultural contexts. Gunn suggests a study of American Indian materials by the present method. These studies have already begun. The same analytic, interpretive, and comparative possibilities, problems, and limitations as discussed above exist in these studies. There is a large body of incised American Indian stones, usually nonutilitarian fragments used solely for marking, which contain nonfigurative, noniconic and near-iconic "geometric" markings that look to the eye like the prehistoric engraving from Europe and Australia. Derived usually from prehistoric and archaic contexts and from hunting-gathering stages, these compositions are little known to American archaeologists and are almost totally unknown outside America. These incised stones began to be found in the 19th century, have ended up in state and regional collections, and have been published primarily in local archaeological journals. They are found in every area of North America. They contain many of the same motifs as those docu- mented on the mammoth ivory fragments of the Russian plain: 306 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="37">Marshiack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC SYMBOL SYSTEMS zigzags, hatches, serpentine motifs, ladders, arcs, and sets of linear marks. There are no ethnographic data available con- cerning their use or meaning. Merely by their presence and ubiquitous distribution, however, they pose analytic and in- terpretive problems of importance to American archaeology. In southern and central Nevada, almost 2,000 incised sand- stone slates have been found in the last decade, many in carbon- dated contexts going back to ca. 7500 B.C. (McKee and Thomas 1972; Thomas 1978). This makes them the largest body of FIG. 50. Incised nonutilitarian fragment of sandstone from Wilson Cabin, Nevada (15.4 cm) engraved with eleven zigzag and band motifs. prehistoric symbolic materials ever found in one area in the Americas. The nearly 400 early incised stones excavated at Gate Cliff seem to represent the work of an indigenous population that lived, hunted, and fished at lakeside during the glacial period and then adapted to the desiccation that followed. There is a possi- bility, then, that we are dealing with a marking tradition that entered the Americas as part of a late Upper Paleolithic cul- tuial complex and that it can be studied as it developed in this area to about A.D. 1000. In preparation for a study of the Gate Cliff slates, I instructed Trudy Thomas in my method of in- quiry and microscopic techniques. In her first paper (Thomas 1978) she states: [It is] clear that incising of non-utilitarian material was a major tradition in the central Great Basin for thousands of years.... Some of the motifs incised on the stones are also found represented in the petroglyphs and pictographs of the area. ... Overmarking of later motifs over earlier ones is common. ... Many of the stones were carried about for a time or were given a great deal of handling. ... There is evidence that many designs were accumulated on a given stone rather than applied in a single marking effort. ... Changes in tool track [and] differential patination suggest [that] a significant amount of time elapsed between [some] marking epi- sodes.... Microscopic analysis of almost 1,000 incised slates from Nevada sites other than Gate Cliff has indicated that the same cognitive modes and strategies were involved in the American accumulations as in the European Upper Paleolithic and Meso- lithic. Figures 50 and 51 represent the engraving of a zigzag ac- cumulation on a piece of nonutilitarian sandstone from Wilson Cabin, Spring Mountains, Nevada (Santini 1974). The en- graving began with a sequence of zigzag motifs, each made by a different point, in a different style, and with a different pres- sure. The primary zigzag was apparently the central band con- taining zigzags that are themselves double-lined. The other bands and zigzags were added later. One of the zigzag bands is a series of marks made by "walking" a denticulate tool across the surface. Over these zigzag accumulations a final, large ser- pentine zigzag was engraved, again by "walking" a denticulate tool. On the reverse face of the stone is another accumulation Fit. 51.

If the above accumulation had been found incised on mam- moth ivory on the Russian plain, I would have accepted it as a late regional example on both analytical and typological grounds. Yet clearly these are different traditions, involving different peoples and different mythological explanations, ritu- als, and sequences of periodic use. Nevertheless, the Russian and American Indian traditions, like the Australian, may have represented common strategies as well as an iconography and mythology in which water, river, spring, rain, serpent, and lightning variously played their parts. A discussion of the American Indian materials is being prepared for publication. We have, then, evidence for a ubiquitous mode of symbol marking among early preliterate hunting-gathering peoples that cannot be adequately explained by any of the traditional theo- ries. As indicated, a comprehensive study of these early tradi- tions will require inputs from all the sciences of man. Turning to Odak's commentary concerning African rock art, I think it is clear that I have not assumed any chronological priority either for the European tradition or for European capacities and skills. Historically, Paleolithic archaeology be- gan as a Western discipline with excavations in Europe. As a result, the first Paleolithic mobiliary images and cave art were discovered in Europe, and the first interpretations and analyses were made of these materials. This centrism is an accident of history, and my interest in the Russian, Siberian, Australian, and American materials and in the dispersed Mesolithic tradi- tions is specifically intended to shift this focus and to put the study of prehistoric symbol into the broad frame of H. sapiens evolution. I am aware of Wendt's (1974) early example of paint- ing from South Africa and I have already examined the incised bone and wood materials from Border Cave in South Africa (Beaumont 1973: fig. 4), which may have a comparable dating. I hope that the continuing research does not degenerate into a search for origins and priorities based on geographical, racial, or nationalistic grounds. The traditions under study are all late ex- amples of symboling capacities whose origins are far earlier than any of the artifacts or materials that will be available for study. Odak's own program of systematic research into the re- gional ethnography and archaeology of Kenyan rock art is a major step towards providing data for the comprehensive, com- parative study of preliterate symbol. I am not suggesting that the possible priority, dispersal, dif- fusion, and fusion of early symboling traditions and modes is not a necessary and valid subject of study. In Europe, for in- stance, I have indicated the persistence and dispersal of certain Upper Paleolithic modes and motifs into post-Wuirm times. I have tentatively suggested a possible continuity and develop- ment in the Australian mode of symbol marking from Koonalda Cave to the present and the possibility of certain Eurasian traditions' having entered the Americas and developed regional styles. It is possible that aspects of the European Upper Paleo- lithic and Mesolithic symboling modes and motifs are to be found in contiguous areas such as North Africa (say, the Cap- sian), in the Near East (both in the Mesolithic and Neolithic), and in northern and central Asia. These questions constitute a related but separate area in the study of prehistoric symbol. My own research, for instance, began with a study of an en- graved Mesolithic bone tool from Ishango at the headwaters of the Nile, a site that also contained barbed harpoons. The presence of the barbed harpoon at Ishango, with notational marking, raises a number of questions concerned with the rela- tively contemporaneous or closely sequential appearance of tools and tool styles: the bola, the atlatl or spear thrower, the barbed harpoon, the bow and arrow, the needle, the composite inset cutting edge, etc. With so many unsolved problems in the realms of both the utilitarian and the symbolic, we must rely on archaeological discovery for eventual answers. Returning to images and symbols, it is obvious that one does not need to disperse a tradition of representing animals by an outline or by attributes of a particular species, such as antlers or horns; also, there is no easy way of representing water by use of line except as a band, a serpentine, or a zigzag; the sun can best be represented by a circle. Each of these iconic or near-iconic figures can then be stylistically elaborated, or an anthropomorphic or animistic substitute image can be created for the object to be imaged. One does not require a dispersal of these quite basic modes, and one does not need to look for regions of origin. They occur in Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. To answer Odak on his closing remarks, therefore: if we dis- cuss cognitive and symbolic modes and strategies, that is, mat- ters of syntax and cultural usage, instead of attempting to in- terpret in full and in detail a lost semantics, we can-as sug- gested in this paper-compare cross-cultural symboling sys- tems and traditions. Comparisons, at some level, are necessary. Archaeology itself is descriptive, analytic, and comparative, as is every humanistic discipline-anthropology, ethnology, linguistics, cognitive and developmental psychology, ethology, primatology. The scientific problem is to understand the nature and relevance of the phenomena that are being studied and compared as well as the limitations and possibilities in- herent in each area of study and each body of data. Concerning Odak's question of a definition of art and symbol, both words are classificatory and typological when used in criticism or science, but, as used by the brain or by the culture, art and symbol need not be considered as separate human products. (In this sense, they are perhaps like Koblinski and Koblifnska's "sign" and "symbol.") If "symbolic" is so defined as to include all human products or productions to the extent that they have cultural meaning beyond the purely utilitarian, then all the products of a culture-including language and so- cial relations-are to that degree symbolic. If "art" is defined as all the products of man that are made with skills and affec- tive results that go beyond what is needed for mere utilitarian function, then much of what man makes is artistic. The pre- historic use of skulls, antlers, teeth, fossils, and even red ochre can be symbolic, however, without being art. Again, a simple grave, burial, or cremation is symbolic but not art, though it may involve activities and artifacts that fall within that defini- tion. What is important is that, despite the academic defini- tions, all the symbolic uses and products just mentioned have meaning only in context, as part of a culture and as aspects of cross-modal behavior involving image, language (verbal or not), narrative, and a structured sequence of periodic or repetitive behavior. These considerations are crucial for an understand- ing of the species-specific symboling capacity that evolved in man, because most discussions tend to be based on such artifac- tual remnants as tool industries or the first appearance of images made of durable materials. These artifacts represent not the cross-modal capacities that must have been evolving in the hominid line, but specialized products of these evolving capacities. To look more deeply into the holistic problem of being hu- man, as Johansen suggests, is, therefore, precisely what I am now attempting. Johansen asks about the possible symbolic nature of tools and the absence of symbolic materials from cer- tain sites and areas. Though not germane to the analytical and interpretive problems in the present paper, these are impor- tant questions. Of course, tools had symbolic content in the Upper Paleolithic, much as tools have today, but even here the problem is not simple. For the prehistoric child, the adult tool was a symbol of adult activity and knowledge and skill. It may also have been symbolic of specialized male or female activity or of restricted ceremonial or ritual activity. For the adult, there were probably tools that were made and used with- out affect or symbolic content, but a successful dart or point may because of its success have suddenly become symbolic to 308 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="39">Marshack: UPPER PALEOLITHIC SYMBOL SYSTEMS the user. In the Upper Paleolithic there were tools, such as the large and fragile Solutrean points, that could not have served in hard, practical use, but may have been symbolic, either as items of trade or as tools used in ritual sacrifice or shamanistic performance. The decorated bone and antler tools may have acquired symbolic attributes because of the design or the act of marking. These represent separate problems with- in the study of human symboling. The more important question for archaeology concerns the lack of symbolic material from some areas or sites and the abundance from others. In part the problem is due to the nature of the archaeological materials and the fact that these provide inherently skewed evidence. The incised slates or fragments from the Upper Paleolithic, or from Australia or the Americas, represent traditions that have found their way to materials that persist. The slates from the Nevada desert, for instance, may represent a tradition transferred to stone in a period when desiccation and deforestation had made bone and wood more valuable for other uses. The painted caves of the Franco-Canta- brian area preserve an evidence that is missing in the rest of Europe, but the evidence of equally skilled ritual activities and specialized symbolic traditions exists in the other areas of Upper Paleolithic Europe. We know that the symbolic produc- tions of the Australian Aborigine or the American Indian were far more complex in all modes than is indicated by the sparse, skewed evidence of the incised slates or the marked walls. Archaeology therefore faces a problem of placing the materials it recovers in balance with normative human behavior. The abundance of graves, tombs, or pyramids in certain cultures does not necessarily indicate a weighted interest in death or the afterlife. The presence of painted pots or carved offerings in tombs or sanctuaries does not necessarily represent the core of symbolic activity or iconography in a culture. Unfortunately, archaeology can deal only with the materials it finds. It is for these reasons that the rare examples of symbolic activity in other modes in the Upper Paleolithic, such as the presence of complex musical instruments, are so important; they suggest the presence of symbolic production that may have been as meaningful as the images: dance, music, song, narrative, and perhaps even rituals for curing, births, etc. Gunn's commentary, while appreciative of the research re- ported, discusses problems and makes points that do not really concern it. Johansen asks a valid methodological question con- cerning the accumulation of marks. It is not microscopic examination of the marks and study of cross-sections alone that helps in determining patterns of accumulation. There are modes of marking with which one quickly becomes familiar. Work marks and so-called tool-testing marks are randomly made. Gripping marks at the base of a point may have a cer- tain regularity and rhythm in the stroking, but they have no other structure or pattern and are limited to this one area on a single artifact class. One can usually determine when a point breaks in the process of engraving (see fig. 23). This happens rarely in the light engraving of bone, ivory, or antler. In the accumulation of sets of small marks there is seldom an indica- tion of breakage for the significant last mark in a set. When a new set is engraved, it begins with a point incising a different cross-section. Exceedingly complex decorative compositions, such as those on the bracelets from Mezin or the head bands from Moravia, show exactly the same cross-sections across the entire engraving. The engraving of an animal, however, with the shifts and changes of the angle and direction of applied pressure, can fracture a point more easily. Normal microwear will not significantly change a cross-section in most notational or motif marking. These methodological problems require a separate paper. Bandi questions whether one can determine the presence of complex conceptual models or symbol systems in the pre- historic materials or make comparisons between the European, American Indian, and Australian conceptual modes. This could not be done using traditional analytic and interpretive pro- cedures, but I assume that the present paper and discussion have indicated theoretical and methodological approaches that make such efforts possible and valid. I touch briefly on the ex- tremely rich "geometric" symbolic forms in the Western Euro- pean Upper Paleolithic: the painted and engraved checker- board forms in Lascaux; the badgelike forms in Castillo; the angular tectiforms in Font de Gaume, Bernifal, and Gourdan- the hutlike image in La Mouthe; the geometric "macaroni" motifs of Parpallo and Romanelli; etc. Attempts to interpret these functionally (Lindner 1937) as traps, pitfalls, huts, or costumes were utilitarian, materialist explanations for these images of a hunting-gathering culture. Later interpretations of the images as sexual, as male and female, or as totemic, sha- manistic, etc., were based on anthropological theories concerned with primitive symbol and rite. A systematic, firsthand analysis of this body of imagery in the Franco-Cantabrian caves has shown that they represent different classes of symbol and that they were often used, reused, added to, changed, and built up piecemeal over a period of time. They were aspects of a complex symbolic usage. The "syntax" of such usage could often be determined without any attempt at interpretation of the images. With the syntax determined, however, it was often possible to offer a range of possible alternative interpretations that might eventually be verified. These studies of the cave imagery are now being prepared for publication. These research approaches represent a profound rupture with almost a century of attempts to read or interpret these images on the basis of what they look like to us, often using contempo- rary theories available in related disciplines. Christensen's at- tempt to relate numerology to water symbolism in published images on the basis of the theories and research of Marshack, K6nig, Eliade, and others represents the traditional approach. There is a difference between stating that sets of marks look like some form of counting but cannot be tested, or that certain sequences can be tested for possible arithmetic periodicity, and Christensen's categorical statement that all the sets of marks (two, three, or four) which one finds engraved in diverse styles on different artifacts and in different contexts are "strictly numerical: that is, they represent elementary numbers." At- tempts to find numerical systems in the Upper Paleolithic ma- terials began with Lartet and Christy (1865-75). I have been able to ascertain the presence of notation but no evidence of a number system. Most of the illustrative examples that Chris- tensen cites were not adequately studied or published by the original authors. Many of the double marks can as easily represent the band motif, as I have suggested, as an aspect of "numerology." In the Upper Paleolithic the double mark can appear as a wound in an animal or even as a participatory ritual marking in an animal (La Pileta), while in other con- texts it appears to be the schematized band motif. Zigzags themselves can represent hair on an animal, grass upon which an animal is feeding, or something entirely different, depend- ing on the context. The attempt to generalize philosophically about the total conceptual world of prehistoric man is an in- teresting exercise for the scholar, but it does not replace first- hand research with the artifacts of a culture, region, or period.
