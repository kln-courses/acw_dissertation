Willis and Yoshika Oniki 219 West Plata Street, Space 1, Tucson, Arizona 85705 Many naturalists (e.g. 2, 3) have briefly noted that in tropical forests of the New World birds follow marching swarms of army ants and capture arthropods flushed by the ants. Buffon (7) reported of the bird that was later named Formicarius (the type genus of the neotropical family Formicariidae; of 238 species of antbirds) that it stayed around nests of leaf-cutting ants; but we know of no evidence to support his account. Recent studies, including several thousand hours of field observations by the authors, have cleared up some of the early errors and given a rough picture of a situation involving dozens of bird species. DO BIRDS EAT ARMY ANTS? Anecdotalists and other scientists, even good observers (2), sometimes assume that birds eat army ants. We have at times found heads of army ants among triturated contents of bird stomachs, but suspect that the ants were eaten only because they were attached to some other prey. Von Ihering (59) reports a young ground-cuckoo (Neomorphus geoffroyi) with a stomach full of ants, but this bird may also have digested a large prey covered with indigestible ants. Skutch (54) reports chickens' eating army ants, but they may actually have been eating wasp larvae. Lancaster (29) reports a nesting tinamou that pecked at army ants. Ordinarily birds peck only at ants attacking their feet or plumage; when foraging, they wait until spiders or other arthropods flee the ants. Commensal beetles in army-ant colonies are often shaped like ants (19), suggest- ing that visually cued predators select for mimicry. Perhaps birds are among these predators [although army ants themselves, or parasitic flies that follow ants (43), could also effect evolution of commensal mimicry], for individual birds low in peck orders sometimes steal bits of booty from homeward-bound army ants or pick up insects near ant trails and bivouacs (66). They could thus eliminate any poorly mimetic commensal other than one that stayed inside the ant nest. If so, we would have independent evidence that being like an army ant keeps one from being bird food. 243 0066-4162/78/1120-0243$01.00</page><page sequence="2">244 WILLIS &amp; ONIKI We know that few worker ants of any species are bird food, although larvae are ravenously eaten-as if on assembly lines-when ants flee a nest at the approach of army ants. Army ants carrying their brood often emigrate at night [(46); but see (25) for a daytime-emigrating species], perhaps to avoid bird thievery of the brood. WHAT ANTS ARE FOLLOWED? The following of ants depends, so far as is known, on the ants' flushing of prey. We exclude here the woodpeckers that extract ant larvae (47), birds that eat winged ants leaving nests, and birds using ants for "anting" (60). Birds have not been found eating larvae or reproductives of army ants, but "anting" with workers as well as with small prey has been reported (see below). With these restrictions, known cases of ant following involve species of the ant subfamily Dorylinae, the driver ants (tribe Dorylini) of Africa (42), and army ants (tribe Ecitonini) of America. No birds have yet been reported at small raids of the doryline tribe Aenictini in the Asian tropics. Legionary or army ants are defined (80) as ants that raid for food in groups and that change the nest site periodically; at present nearly all such ants are allocated to the Dorylinae. Driver ants (Anomma wilverthi and A. nigricans) are followed by thrushes (Tur- didae), bulbuls (Pycnonotidae), and other birds at times (8, 11). J. R. Karr (personal communication) suggests that driver ants are irregular in swarming, so that African birds probably do not depend on them. In the New World, only a few of the many Ecitonini (4, 46) attract birds. Screech owls (Otus spp.) may occasionally follow nocturnally raiding species. Underground species do not attract birds. Species that form "column raids," long lines to raid wasp and ant nests, attract birds only when spread out briefly (37, 66, 70, 74). The army ants most followed are "swarm raiders," species that form wide pha- lanxes that trap or flush roaches, spiders, and other active prey as well as larvae of social insects. Eciton rapax, a large yellow-gastered Amazonian species, attracts a few birds to its straggling raids. Two other swarm raiders, which occur from northern Mexico (58) to nearly 300 S in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (E. 0. Willis, unpublished data), account for most records. Labidus praedator, a tiny black or brownish ant (and perhaps related species of similar appearance), swarms with circling or serpentine movements on or near the ground in forests and pastures up to at least 2400 m altitude, as at Tijeras, Huila, Colombia (E. 0. Willis, unpublished data). It captures many isopods, and tends to swarm on the surface mainly in rainy weather; it is known as the "rain ant" in southeastern Brazil, and leads many to think that army ants in general swarm only when it rains. It swarms at night or by day, but does not swarm every day nor all day long; thus it is undependable for birds, and is often overlooked by them. Eciton burchelli is a two-toned ant (yellowish gaster, brownish foreparts) of medium size (about 1 cm) that forms swarm raids up to 20 m across, which flow through forests at about 15 m per hour, searching for arthropods that can be chewed apart at the joints and carried in pieces back to the massive "bivouac" or temporary nest of interlaced ants. Unlike driver ants, they do not have scissorlike mandibles</page><page sequence="3">BIRDS AND ARMY ANTS 245 and cannot easily cut apart trapped vertebrates or meat in larders. They can swarm over small vertebrates and bite and sting them to death, as once befell a White- plumed Antbird (Pithys albifrons) trapped in a mist net at Manaus. However, the dangers of these marabunta (Spanish) or taoca (Portuguese, from the Tupi- Guarani) have been greatly exaggerated. For birds, Eciton burchelli present a dependable resource. They swarm nearly every day and nearly all day long for some 14 "nomadic" days in each 35-day reproductive cycle (46). They carry the growing larvae to new bivouac sites nearly every night. For some 21 "statary" days in each reproductive cycle, the newly pupated larvae and then the eggs stay with the queen and workers in a hollow tree or other protected site, but the ants still raid nearly every day (66). Regularity in swarming, with three or so out-of-phase colonies per km2 (on Barro Colorado Island [BCI] in Panama'), allows some ant-following birds to be "profes- sional"-they get over 50 percent of their food, often nearly all of it, by following army ants. They shift to nomadic and large colonies when possible, but seldom are without a colony to follow. Since the ants swarm in dry or wet seasons or weather, there is no break in food availability. The only problems occur at altitudinal and latitudinal limits, where the ants fail to swarm in cold weather or move so slowly that they flush little prey. Altitudinal limits recorded include 1350 m both at Rancho Grande (Venezuela) and on the Serra de Caparao (Brazil). Southward, ants failed to swarm the first day of a cold wave in Mato Grosso, and moved late and slowly on following days (79a). Eciton burchelli seem to be absent from savannas such as the lianos of Venezuela and the cerrados of central Brazil, but they may yet be found in gallery woodlands in these regions. In partly cleared areas they swarm through pastures and semiopen zones near woods, even into houses, but require cavities or logs for statary nests. Near Cosala (Sinaloa, Mexico), Willis saw one colony swarming in desert scrub near a wooded wash. He has found Labidus praedator in gallery woodlands 180 km W of Barra de Garcas, Mato Grosso. Neither E. Burchelli nor L. praedator occur in a 200-ha woodlot near Campinas, Brazil, although both survive in a 1400-ha woodlot to the west (E. 0. Willis, unpublished). Probably army ants, like other "big" predators, go extinct in isolated small plots (9, 77). WHAT ANIMALS FOLLOW ARMY ANTS? Tachinid and stylopid flies (43) lay eggs on fleeing arthropods. Bufo marinus occa- sionally sits around army-ant columns. Teid lizards of the genera Ameiva and Kentropyx often follow ants, especially Amneiva festiva and A. leptophrys on BCI. They shuffle in the leaf litter, mainly at sunny spots too hot and bright for bird competitors. Some iguanids, especially the large Anolisfrenatus of large tree trunks on BCI, catch flushed insects. There are four main families and types of ant-following birds: walkers (Cuculi- dae), climbers (Dendrocolaptidae), clingers and hoppers (Formicariidae), and perchers (Thraupidae). In no family are the regular followers more than a small</page><page sequence="4">246 WILLIS &amp; ONIKI fraction of the total number of species. Nearly all antbirds and woodcreepers follow ants at times, but few tanagers and cuckoos do so. The largest group of regular ant followers is in the family Formicariidae, but most antbirds rarely follow ants. Table 1 lists the 50 species that follow ants regularly; most are professionals. When one goes beyond the basic 50 species into species that get little of their total food over ants, one ranges from common species that are frequent at swarms (79) Table 1 Fifty birds that regularly follow army ants Birds Weights (g) Sourcea Cuculidae (Cuckoos) Neomorphus (4 spp.)b, c (350) W, 48 Dendrocolaptidae (Woodcreepers)d Dendrocincla (7 spp.)b, c, d 30-55 W, 65, 72 Hylexetastes (2 spp.) 125 W Dendrocolaptes (4 spp.)c 60-90 W Formicariidae (Antbirds) Pyriglena (3 spp.) 30 W, 36 Gymnocichla nudiceps (30) W Myrmeciza fortis (40) W Myrmeciza immaculata (40) W Percnostola rufifronse 30 W Hylophylax naevioides 17 70 Hylophylax poecilonotae 17 W Rhegmatorhina (5 spp.) 35 69 Gymnopithys (5 spp.) 25-35 51, 66, 68 Skutchia borbae 55 67 Phlegopsis (3 spp.)b 50 W, 36 Phaenostictus mcleannani 50 74 Pithys (2 spp.)b 20; ?

However, there are many tropical species and fami- lies for which we have no documented records of ant following, if by "documented record" we mean a statement that a bird on one occasion was seen to capture a prey flushed by ants. For instance, there is no such record for any woodpeckser (Picidae), although some woodpeckers wander near groups of birds following army ants in the same way they wander near interspecific flocks away from ants (35). One has to distinguish birds wandering past swarms from birds capturing prey flushed by ants, and only careful observation shows which is the case for a given species. Table 2 shows that 21 of 46 families of neotropical land birds have never been recorded to have captured prey flushed by ants. The 13 families in which ant following is occasional to fairly regular include the Falconidae (Micrastur ruficollis, and rarely M. gilvicollis, are persistent ant follow- ers that terrify small birds but mostly capture large insects), the Cuculidae (espe- cially Piaya cayana and at forest edges the anis, Crotophaga), the Bucconidae and Momotidae, the partly frugivorous Pipridae and the omnivorous Corvidae (17), but not the omnivorous Icteridae or the partly frugivorous Cotingidae. Turdidae, good ant followers in the Old World, follow ants readily in the New whenever there is little competition, as on Trinidad (65) or at swarms of Labidus praedator (64). Rarely recorded with ants, and a surprise when found, are the Tinamidae (Tinamus major, rarely others) and the Cracidae (Penelope superciliaris and P. jacquacu). Woodrails (Aramides cajanea) and trumpeters (Psophia sp.) can follow persistently, as can toucans [Ramphastos sulphuratus, R. vitellinus, and related "grunting" spe- Table 2 Families of neotropical land birds at ant swarms or not Family Statusa Family Status Family Status Tinamidae C Trogonidae A Hirundinidae A Cathartidae A Bucconidae E Corvidae E Accipitridae A Galbulidae A Troglodytidae E Falconidae D Momotidae E Mimidae A Cracidae C Alcedinidae A Turdidae E Rallidae B Ramphastidae C Sylviidae C Psophiidae D Picidae A Motacillidae A Columbidae A Dendrocolaptidae E Ploceidae A Psittacidae A Rhinocryptidae B Estrildidae A Cuculidae D Formicariidae E Vireonidae C Tytonidae A Furnariidae C Icteridae B Strigidae A Cotingidae A Parulidae D Nyctibiidae A Rupicolidae B Coerebidae A Caprimulgidae A Pipridae E Thraupidae D Apodidae A Tyrannidae C Fringillidae C Trochilidae A aA: Not yet recorded.

In the big family Furnariidae, a few species of A utomolus follow ants, but seldom; leafscrapers (Sclerurus) in stolid apathy ignore ants a few centimeters from the leaves they are flicking aside in search of other insects. DO BIRD FLOCKS FOLLOW ANTS? Johnson (23) proposed that interspecific flocks of birds occasionally join the "feast- ing activities" of birds that follow army ants. Later studies (35, 70) suggest that the interspecific flocks and the flocks of ant-following birds are normally separate, although some species occur in both. However, birds of interspecific flocks are easily attracted by an ant-following flock; they wheel around it and forage in their nor- mally diverse ways. Sometimes one of them catches an insect flushed by the ants. Birds from the interspecific flock sometimes shift to the ant-following group, such as Xiphorhynchus woodcreepers. Johnson suggested that Dendrocincla fuliginosa did so, but it follows ants more than flocks. Other flocking species ignore ants in seeming blindness, and most flocks leave the area of the ant swarm within 30 minutes. HOW MANY BIRDS FOLLOW ANTS? The number of species and individuals following a given swarm of army ants or recorded with army ants in a general region varies widely. Large colonies and regularly swarming ones (nomadic) attract large numbers of birds, at times 20-26 individuals of one or two species, plus scattered individuals of up to 30 other species. Over the course of a few days, the number of individuals following a colony can vary from 0 to 50, the number of species from 0 to 20 and back, although fluctuations are generally smaller; a wild fluctuation usually means that the colony swarmed for a day in an open area or up a tree in ant nests and thereby lost all its followers that day. In general, the number of regular species following ants decreases toward the peripheries of the distributions of army ants, whether these peripheries are the edges of the tropics or gradations into montane or dry or flooded areas. No regular ant follower occurs on the west coast of Mexico north of Tehuantepec, although swarms of E. burchelli in Nayarit attracted Crotophaga sulcirostris and other nonprofession- als (E. 0. Willis and F. G. Stiles, unpublished). In eastern Mexico, two Dendrocincla and two Dendrocolaptes, plus the tanagers Habia fuscicauda and Trichothraupis penicillata, move in. Species together at a single raid seldom exceed five, however (62). In eastern Guatemala, the antbird Gymnocichla nudiceps adds to this assem- blage (30). Several more antbirds appear in eastern Honduras (33), and a ground- cuckoo in Nicaragua (20). From there to the lowlands of eastern Panama' and northern Colombia, one can find up to ten regular ant following species in a given region. The number decreases in the dry forests eastward and in western Ecuador, as well as in dry Pacific Central America. Only around the humid Golfo Dulce in Costa Rica can one find as many as six regular species on the Pacific slope. The decrease from ten species to a few across central Panam'a is very striking, but details remain to be investigated.</page><page sequence="7">BIRDS AND ARMY ANTS 249 Amazonian ant-following guilds are larger, with a maximum of 12 or 13 species in eastern Ecuador. The maximum for any one swarm, however, is ten for nearby Umbria in Colombia. To the east, the species for a given region decrease to nine at Manaus and eight (formerly) at Belem, with occasional raids attracting all the species known for a given region. On the south side of the Amazon there is often one species more than on the north bank directly opposite. Numbers of species decrease rapidly in neighboring savanna or scrubland regions, but pick up again to five in southeastern forests. Willis (with W. Belton) has seen four even at Torres, in Rio Grande do Sul. Guilds differ in different regions, even across large rivers in Amazonia, while the numbers of species remain similar if there is no change of forest type. One thus gets replicates of guilds, mostly little studied as yet. The guilds west and east of the Rio Madeira are different but little known, as are guilds west and east of the Rio Tapajoz and guilds in eastern Ecuador and Colombia. These guilds may have arisen in isolated forest refugia, as Haffer (16) suggests, but now are separated by rivers or by dry forests or simply by slight habitat changes. Often the antbird components of guilds differ most, for they rarely cross even small rivers or wide roads; wood- creeper components of guilds differ less. To records of regular components of guilds must be added records of irregular species, which can cause lists in a given region to lengthen greatly; but ant-following individuals of each such species represent such a small fraction of its population that all the irregular species together add up to the equivalent of one or two regular species. In general, irregular species are rare at a given swarm wherever regular species are present, and dominate species lists at each swarm in peripheral forests. [However, lists of irregular species present in the central forest areas are usually long (36, 37) because there one accumulates many observations of brief visits by many irregular species. Few species other than regular ones occur at ant swarms in southeastern forests also.] WHAT IS THE ROLE OF MIGRANTS? Northward, the numbers of irregular ant followers are augmented by migrant species from North America, especially thrushes and wood-warblers. Migrants are generally smaller than and subordinate to the better-adapted resident ant followers, and tend to go to swarms of the unpredictable Labidus praedator, while residents preempt the regular swarms of Eciton burchelli (64). Migrants are especially numer- ous on BCI, which in recent years has lost several species of regular ant followers because of its small size (77, 82). More work is needed in northern Central America, where migrants by their numbers may press on residents more strongly and even prevent breeding by residents. H. R. Pulliam (personal communication) finds that migrant sparrows seem to discourage local breeding about 6-10? north of the Tropic of Cancer. It is curious that no ant-following antbird is found north of Guatemala; former Mayan use of the forest rather than migrants may have eliminated them. Migrants are very rare at swarms of ants in Amazonia, and only a few altitudinal or southern migrants follow ant swarms in southern Brazil.</page><page sequence="8">250 WILLIS &amp; ONIKI HOW IS FOOD DIVIDED? Birds sometimes steal food from the grasp of army ants. If birds or parasitic flies were not present to cut off the escape route, however, most arthropods would flee upward from the ants. Evolution of swarm-raiding ants probably required aerial predators. The ants flush many arthropods, and birds crowd in over some swarms and form dominance rings. Large birds take the central and best zone, and supplant smaller ones or chase them to peripheral zones. Let us consider the three guilds for which we have more than one year each of observations. On BCI, the large antbird Phaenostictus mcleannani takes the central "A" zone over each swarm that it reaches, the medium-sized Gymnopithys bicolor takes the surrounding "B" zone, and the small Hylophylax naevioides takes the "C" outer reaches of the swarm (70). At Belem, the large Phlegopsis nigromaculata takes the center and the medium-sized Pyriglena leuconota the outer reaches of each swarm (36). North of the Amazon and east of the Negro there is no large antbird to take the center of swarms (37). Thus, Dendrocincla merula, a 55-gram woodcreeper related to the smaller D. castanoptera of the rest of Amazonia, takes the center of most swarms from Gymnopithys rufigula, a medium-sized antbird for which 26 individuals have been recorded at a single swarm. Infiltrating among the G. rufigula is the speedy little Pithys albifrons, despite constant attacks by the former. At the far edges of the swarm, Hylophylax poecilonota sometimes gains some prey, as it does in undisturbed forests near Belem. (See also Figure 1.) As well as division by dominance, division by perch type is common. Even the above species show slight differences in perch diameters and angles, while it is common for subordinate species to forage higher than dominant ones (65, 68, 70) when the latter are present. Large birds also take larger prey than do smaller oqes, judging from the fact that prey champed rather than swallowed quickly by each species tends to be close to the average length of the predator's bill. Woodcreepers perch vertically and on thick perches while antbirds can cling across slender vertical perches only. Feduccia (13) suggested that climbing woodcreepers evolved from ovenbirds to exploit ants; other routes between the two families are possible, how- ever (76). Woodcreepers divide up their thick perches much as antbirds do: by dominance and by slight variations in foraging behavior. In Panama', Dendrocolaptes certhia sometimes took low trunks from the smaller Dendrocincla fuliginosa, but usually preferred larger trunks. At Belem, the same happened while Dendrocincla castanoptera infiltrated among the antbirds on slender saplings. North of the Ama- zon, the large Hylexetastes perrotti dominates the medium-large Dendrocolaptes picumnus, which dominates D. certhia and relegates it to foraging away from ants most of the time. Although below D. certhia in dominance, Dendrocinclafuliginosa stays with the ants, and Dendrocincla merula takes the place of a large antbird. (See also Figure 2.) The system is rather like that of different perch diameters and fruit sizes for Melanesian pigeons (9). Large birds, such as ground-cuckoos of the genus Neomorphus and antpittas (Pittasoma), walk or hop at the borders of raids and thus use another type of perch.</page><page sequence="9">BIRDS AND ARMY ANTS 251 la 0 ~0 ;3 cd~ Vo m~~~~~~~~~~~~4 4 4) 4) 0 "0~~~ .0 . 0 4%, IP 0 0 :F1 4) 1 * **.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~e I. * *'*.,* .0. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 4)~c U</page><page sequence="10">252 WILLIS &amp; ONIKI cd )- '4 '.. t3 U &gt;DO ;: I z cd ~ N bD b ZN a _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _v K (9 n 0 . .- 0 cd .0 b).

Where there are many species of antbirds, there is usually one that both hops on horizontal twigs and clings to vertical perches, and here tanagers may disappear. The tanagers, and species of antbirds that hop as well as cling, do well at forest edges or in low forests where light reaches the forest floor and allows horizontal branches to persist. The antbird Percnostola rufifrons at Manaus uses forest edges or second growth, thus taking the place occupied by Gymnopithys rufigula in the forest interior. Fire-eyes (Pyriglena) take the same niche south of the Amazon, but are absent wherever there are many species of antbirds. Nonprofessional ant-followers tend to exploit areas between the professional ones or occupy the upper and outer reaches of a swarm (37). When larger or better- adapted species are absent, the small professional species and the nonprofessionals move downward and toward the center, closer to where the ants flush the most food (65). Concentrations of food above the ground attract many woodcreepers, while concentrations near the ground attract antbirds. Often Micrastur ruficollis takes the place of a ground bird, running about on logs or the ground or pouncing from large horizontal lianas near the ground. Overlap of niches and separation of niches are obvious at any moderately active group of ant-following birds; clear, too, is the fact that aggression keeps some birds out while others like Pithys albifrons return persistently. Since the attacks by other species on P. albifrons must number in the billions yearly, one who believes in selection through competition must ask "Why doesn't Pithys ever learn?" Obvi- ously, it makes its living while getting beaten up, and does not have a better place to go. Opportunity and competition, the carrot and the stick, both play a part. ARE ANT FOLLOWERS TERRITORIAL? Johnson (23) erroneously believed that some ant followers were nonterritorial, following the nomadic ants wherever they wandered. Only the color banding of individuals and the careful observation of dominance patterns have cleared up the confusion. Some ant followers, mostly species that can find food even when ants leave their territories, maintain fixed territories and seldom leave them-Spotted Antbirds on BCI, for instance (70). Presumably this is the primitive pattern. Birds that follow ants all the time cannot stay on their territories unless the territories are huge, for at times there may be several ant colonies on a given territory and at other times none. These birds have territories, but wander widely around them. They may feed for weeks away from their territories, even if they nest and (probably) roost only on their territories. The best-studied of this type of territory is that of the Bicolored Antbird (66). Pairs maintain nonoverlapping territories, but follow ant swarms wherever they go. Two to four breeding pairs often follow the same colony of ants for weeks. The pair that "owns" the local territory dominates others, but suddenly becomes subordinate to the pair of the next territory when the ants cross the invisible border into that</page><page sequence="12">254 WILLIS &amp; ONIKI territory. Pairs rarely wander more than two territories away from their own, for in transit they drop very low in hierarchies when distant from their home areas; they return to swarms closer to their home territories. Modifications of this type of territory occur in most ant-following antbirds. Old pairs of Ocellated Antbirds (74) tolerate their sons and daughters-in-law, so that family clans form in which all nest separately but all dominate outsiders. Within the clan, the old pair dominate in rare cases of conflict. A high density is thus achieved even with a large "territory" for each old pair. Emlen (12) and Willis (66) found such early definitions of territory as "a defended area" (34) anthropomorphic, and suggested an operational definition: A territory is a space in which an animal or group dominates others that dominate it elsewhere. Wilson (81) garbled the facts about Bicolored Antbirds, while Brown (5) offered only an appeal to authority in trying to suggest that Bicolored Antbirds are nonter- ritorial. Others discussing territoriality (6) have failed to consider the recent argu- ments, in part because "defended area" is often used to justify the human use of private property (1). One needs "dominance space" to emphasize balances of aggres- sion and submission nonmoralistically, avoiding both "defense" (a capitalistic pref- erence) and "offense" (a communistic bias). The concept of dominance space as applied to the territoriality of antbirds is less clouded by anthropomorphism, and includes resource advantages of aggression counteracted eventually by energetic and other disadvantages of continuing to assert dominance. HOW SOCIAL ARE ANT FOLLOWERS? Instead of dividing up animal behavior ecologically, into favorable or unfavorable small, medium, and large factors (foraging, reproductive, spatial, maintenance, agonistic, and antipredatory behaviors, respectively), some have recently suggested that "sociobiology" is a separate science rather than just variably successful kinds of responses in each of the six basic units. One of the present authors has written on sociobiology (78), but he found that it was not a practical subdivision. Inter- specific associations, predator-prey communication, parasitism of fetus on the mother, and competitive aggregations are also sociobiological phenomena, while temperature control is so only if animals aggregate. Here we shall use the widest possible definition of social behavior-interactions of two or more animals-and discuss sociology as part of behavior in general. In foraging behavior (the ecological terms are "growth" or "feeding"), ant- following birds readily use each other and the ants to find swarms of ants. Ant- following birds readily go to noises of others. Playing tape-recorded songs of Bicolored Antbirds on BCI attracted not only territorial Bicolors but also nonter- ritorial ones and other anti-following species (66). The birds often turn toward an ant swarm on reaching the column of ants between bivouac and swarm. They also follow each other about if any bird seems to know where it is going. The birds also use nonsocial methods of finding ants, such as visiting an inactive statary bivouac tree every few hours, or simple wandering near the place where the ants were last seen.</page><page sequence="13">BIRDS AND ARMY ANTS 255 In reproductive behavior ("reproduction," in ecology), ant-following birds feed the young for rather short periods-up to two months-after incubation and brood- ing. Species with simple foraging techniques, such as dominant antbirds and the infiltrating Pithys albifrons, care for their fledglings barely a month. Nonfeeding associations between adults and young last longer periods in some dominant species (74). Probably these associations show that dominants can be nepotic, while aggre- gations of subordinates quickly attract a patronizing dominant. The value to young in associating with adults may include protection from competitors or predators and hence represent foraging or antipredatory behavior rather than reproductive Oedi- pal advantages, but little is certain. Several subordinate species are very nonsocial, even to the point that females care for young alone in the woodcreeper genus Dendrocincla (38, 50, 72); thus mobility between and use of scattered bits of foraging space is facilitated. In spatial behavior (ecological terms are "habitat selection" or "dispersal/disper- sion"), one could cite the previously described methods of territoriality or of finding ants. Dispersal of young antbirds and woodcreepers involves movements of a few kilometers through forests at times, while settled adults stay in areas from 3-5 km across (Pithys albifrons at Manaus) down to 200 m in diameter (70). Open habitats are avoided, and different species or subspecies may occur on the two sides of large rivers. In maintenance behavior (the ecological term is "pollution" or "environmental physiology"), mutual grooming occurs mainly as part of the reproductive pattern between mates in antbirds. Maintenance is relatively nonsocial in these birds; of course, they incubate and brood. Antbirds and woodcreepers do perform "anting," brushing small insects through their wing or tail feathers. Potter (40) suggested that these insects spray substances that soothe feather irritation during molt, while Dubunin (see 26) found that anting kills feather mites. In most cases subordinate antbirds "ant." This suggests that hungry birds rub distasteful prey in their feathers so as to detoxify it before eating. Dominant birds seldom attempt to eat distasteful prey (66). Perhaps the behavior pattern began as a foraging technique and later in evolution or in ontogeny became a maintenance one. In agonistic behavior ("competition," in ecology), territorial and competitive aspects have been discussed. Many of the calls of antbirds are used in agonistic behavior. Dominant species tend to emphasize submissive calls and displays and are "social," while subordinate species generally emphasize aggressive calls and do not aggregate so closely; the former need to crowd together in the rich central area of the swarm for sufficient prey to support their large bodies, while the subordinates must keep apart to use small peripheral "hotspots." Agonistic behavior, like repro- ductive behavior, is seldom nonsocial unless avoidance reactions, mistakes, or at- tacks on inanimate objects are considered nonsocial. In antipredator behavior ("predation," in ecology), many of the calls of different species are similar. Probably the high, thin "keening" notes have been selected for in many antbirds because acoustic characteristics make their sources difficult for predators to locate (32). The "chirring" buzzes of many antbirds in the presence of ground predators and humans apparently mimic the low-pitched warning growls of</page><page sequence="14">256 WILLIS &amp; ONIKI carnivores; vocal Batesian mimicry may be involved. Chirrs are surely antipreda- tory, and Johnson (23) was wrong to think them altruistic calls of aggregation. Sharp, "chipping" noises occur as alarm calls in many species; they may startle a predator, tell it that the bird is alert and will be hard to catch, or direct its attention to the place the bird is about to leave. Bare areas around the eyes of many unrelated antbirds evidently work as independently evolved "giant eyespot" designs that repel predators or competitors; whether these are social or nonsocial raises the question of whether an animal communicating with an enemy is being social. Mortality rates of homosexual pairs of male Bicolored Antbirds are low, which suggests that aggre- gation of birds is advantageous (77). Heterosexual pairs have rather high rates, which suggests that nesting eliminates the advantage. IS HIGH NEST PREDATION NORMAL? Many authors (e.g. 15, 44, 52, 63, 77) have found high predation of nests in tropical birds. Some (52, 56) report higher predation in forest than in open areas near houses. It was thus a surprise to Oniki (37a) and Willis [studies of ant-following birds at the same localities and times, using the method of observation of adults without actually visiting nests explained in (75)] to find fairly low nest mortalities of equatorial birds, and to find that mortality rates were lower among forest birds than among birds of clearings. Phlegopsis nigromaculata, in forest at Belem, had low (20%) nest mortality; Pyriglena leuconota, in second growth, had rather high (80%) mortality, but nothing like the figures of 88-96% mortality from BCI (77). More studies are needed, for even the extensive studies of Oniki are not based on enough nests, habitats, or years. It is possible that high rates of nest predation are not normal in tropical forests, which might explain why so few forest birds have short incubation or nestling periods. Low predation could be due to the many ways birds have of concealing nests in a complex environment like a tropical forest (28). An open habitat provides many fewer places where nests can be hidden. Moreover, a forest simply has more volume for a predator to search than does a less stratified habitat (44). In addition, nesting periods can be scattered out over more of the year when forest shade evens out fluctuations in temperature and moisture. There remains the question of why Trinidad and Central American studies show such high nest mortalities. Could it be that the isolated woodlot of Skutch (52) and the isolated BCI are losing species because nest-robbing small predators become too abundant once large predators like eagles and pumas disappear or are hunted out? And that low nest mortalities near houses result from a second stage of human interference in which small predators are also eliminated? We could then expect low nest mortalities near houses, high ones in intermediate zones, and low mortalities again distant from humans. On the basis of the present inadequate data, one cannot even assert that nest mortalities rise in subequatorial zones and drop slightly near the equator. We can see the importance of doing future studies in areas far from man, who after all is actively changing evolutionary pressures far from his houses. Theories that explain low clutch sizes near the equator and in forests as results of high predation (14, 53) cannot be important if there is less predation in forests than</page><page sequence="15">BIRDS AND ARMY ANTS 257 near forest edges. In that case, the theory that tropical birds have low clutch sizes because they and other animals split up the available resources very finely becomes more cogent. IS LOW ADULT MORTALITY NORMAL? Adult mortalities on BCI were higher in two strongly professional antbirds (20- 35% yr1) than in Spotted Antbirds (15% yr1), which suggests that the wide traveling forced on the strongly professional species by their way of life exacts a toll (77). Presumably Spotted Antbirds learn well the hiding places in their small territo- ries, and undertake no long movements searching for ants. Recent studies show some Spotted Antbirds more than 10 years old. Adult mortality rates at Belem and Manaus were low in some years but not others. Subordinate species, which have to travel about, generally had higher mor- tality rates than dominant species; the opposite had been true on BCI, where subordinate species do not try to locate distant swarms. Caution should be urged on those who assume that tropical forest birds have long lives, for the data are varied. Moreover, many reports come from areas near man, where forest hawks are likely to disappear. ARE THERE DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITIONS? The demographic transition from "r-selection" to "K-selection" is said to occur in humans during changes from "underdeveloped" to "developed" cultures, but which aspects of these changes are important is disputed. Similar transitions seem to occur in ant-following birds. Antbirds in general lay two eggs each, as do most other species of ant-following birds (a few tanagers lay three, but little is known about their demography). Transitions to the low reproductive rates of "K-selection" or back to the high rates of "r-selection" thus are expressed not in clutch size but, most commonly, by nesting more or less often per year. Since lengths of incubation and brooding periods vary little within a family (except that larger birds tend to have longer periods), and since care of young is only marginally shorter in dominant species or others that do not have complex foraging styles, the length of the nesting season indicates the number of broods (given that, as is usually the case, individuals of a species nest without breaks and at much the same times of year). Many woodcreepers at Manaus nest but once per year, and the breeding season is short. By contrast, on BCI and in Trinidad (57, 72) one of these same woodcreep- ers has a long breeding season. Some antbirds, such as Phlegopsis nigromaculata at Belem, nest a few times in six months of the year while others, such as Pyriglena leuconota in the same area, nest repeatedly over ten months of the year. P. ni- gromaculata also showed "K-selection" in the fact that some mated females failed to breed during 14 months of studies. By contrast, Pithys albifrons at Manaus not only breeds much of the year, but a female with one offspring hurriedly divorces her mate and leaves him caring for it so as to start a new nest quickly with a new mate.</page><page sequence="16">258 WILLIS &amp; ONIKI Table 3 indicates length of breeding season for several species at BCI, Belem, and Manaus. Short breeding season does not correlate well with dominance status, for Phaenostictus mcleannani on BCI is dominant but nests nearly all year. Instead, low mortality rates and especially low adult mortalities correlate with low birth rates, just as some have suggested for the demographic transition in humans: "Where mortalities are high, people have many children to take care of them in old age." Obviously, the antbirds do not expect their offspring to care for them in old age, and one may question the theory even for humans. P. mcleannani is the most social of antbirds, forming clans that last for years, but under mortality conditions on BCI it had nests all year. Schaffer (45) suggests that high nest-predation rates or any other factor that increases the expense of rearing young will tend to encourage evolution of breeding strategies that deemphasize raising young, as long as adult mortalities are not high or expensive. Table 3 suggests that Hylophylax naevioides, with high nest mortalities but low adult losses, cuts its breeding season in the way suggested. Pithys albifrons may have low nest losses at Manaus, for no forest bird there is known to have high mortalities (Y. Oniki, unpublished). Thus, it should be less expensive to raise young than to conserve adults, and the nest season is long. Where both adult and juvenile mortalities are high, the birds studied show long breeding seasons-as if young are more valuable per unit of expense. Where neither adult nor nest losses are high, the results suggest that conserving adults and maintaining short breeding seasons are best. We can also understand the mortality-related demographic transitions if competi- tion with or among offspring is the problem. Where mortality rates are consistently low, the environment soon fills up with birds of that species, and juveniles, being low in hierarchies, find no places. Dominance helps to achieve a low mortality rate in many cases, for usually the dominant birds do not have to travel between swarms Table 3 Ant-following birds and demographic transitions Nest Adult loss Breeding Place and species Dominance predation (yrCt) (mo yr-1) BCI, Panama Phaenostictus mcleannani dominant 80% or more 20% or more -10 Gymnopithys bicolor second 80% or more 20% or more -10 Hylophylax naevioides subordinate 80% or more &lt;20% 3-6 Manaus, Brazil Dendrocincla merulaa dominant &lt; 80% &lt;20% 3-6 Gymnopithys rufigula second &lt; 80% &lt; 20% 3-6 Pithys albifrons subordinate ? 20% or more -10 Belem, Brazil Phlegopsis nigromaculata dominant &lt; 80% &lt; 20% 3_6b Pyriglena leuconota second 80% or more 20% or more -10 a Since there is no large antbird at Manaus, a woodcreeper takes its place. bP. nigromaculata also has nonbreeding pairs, another sign of low reproductivity.</page><page sequence="17">BIRDS AND ARMY ANTS 259 when ousted by larger birds, nor forage on the dangerous periphery of swarms. Moreover, the young dominant bird is mnore likely to find a place over ants than the young subordinate bird. However, P. mcleannani on Barro Colorado has been saddled with a high and perhaps abnormal mortality rate; the island has very high predation rates, perhaps because large eagles and felids are gone and no longer eat nest-robbing snakes and opossums [see Janzen (21) for a similar suggestion]. Where mortality rates are high for this reason, or in the case of Pyriglena leuconota at Belem for reasons of low dominance, the environment is seldom full, and the species in question breeds repeatedly each year. Kluijver (27) showed that in titmice in Europe high density inhibited second broods even more than it did clutch size. Competition against entering juveniles may be important, if an adult wastes its energy producing young that are likely to die. The picture is complicated in humans by the fact that because each of its individuals expects or needs progressively more goods for less work, competition or parental expense in a developed culture reaches a high level at much lower densities than in an underdeveloped culture. Neverthe- less, the phenomenon could be similar to that in birds. SHOULD ANT FOLLOWERS HAVE STANDING? Army ants and ant-following birds disappear when humans cut neotropical forests. Old cocoa plantations with overstory trees do support them in some areas; but modem cocoa growing uses bananas for shade. Pyriglena atra, an antbird of overcut central Bahia in Brazil, is already on the IUCN list of endangered species. One of the most striking results of a 10-year study of the population dynamics of ant- following antbirds on BCI (77) was the realization that this island reserve of 15 km2 was losing 10 or so species of birds every decade. Moreover, the disappearing birds were generally large or specialized; by "ecological truncation" the large ground-cuckoo was first to go, the largest woodcreeper second, the largest antbird third, etc. Ecological truncation, and not island biogeography as later suggested (49), predicts that 50 reserves of 15 km2 each would preserve fewer species than one of 750 km2. Island biogeography theory (31) is probably only marginally relevant to the problem of reserves, despite enthusiasm at Princeton after our stay there in 1971- 1972. Low species numbers on islands of vegetation in seas of water or cultivation can have various causes: Some species never get there, or have insufficient area in which to speciate (55); small islands have too few habitats (22); edge species begin to take over if edges become disproportionately long because the refuge was not made large and elliptical or round (61). However, we wonder whether those who claim elevation or habitat diversity are more important than area (22, 41) really propose that 10 ha each of pine, fir, and sagebrush would support the same diversity of species as 1000 ha of each. Island biogeography is most interesting when combined with continental biogeog- raphy, which suggests that connected islands of habitat keep more species than do isolated islands. The implications of connecting refuges with corridor zones have to date proved too frightening even for the most dedicated conservationists. Essen-</page><page sequence="18">260 WILLIS &amp; ONIKI tially, humans would have to live in "parks." The native fauna and flora would form a matrix around us. We could move between our parks under or above ground, of course. Such a matrix of habitat would preserve more species than would islands of habitat of the same total area, as long as humans did not insist on occupying more than 50% of the earth. (In other words we would have to forego about 35 years of human expansion at the present doubling-rate of our population). If Darwin was right, of course, it may be difficult to prevent the fit (us?) from displacing the less fit (them); and one wonders if they are worth saving. It may be possible to live without the ant-following birds, even though they can be really charming. Skutch (51) reports that a Bicolored Antbird named James learned to follow him regularly when he stirred the leaf litter with a stick. Related antbirds in Guyana follow herds of white-lipped peccaries. Young females of that antbird species used to stay so charmingly close to Willis at Manaus that he began to think they selected mates by staying close to males that scared off competitors. (Perhaps James was not a male.) One young Dendrocincla merula at Manaus often alighted on Willis at idle moments and pecked aggressively at his notebook; a hypothesis is probably hidden there somewhere. Half the recent excitement in refuge theory would not have erupted had it not been for the antbirds. [E. Mayr (personal communication) accuses the BCI study of being the only basis for that excitement.] But reserves filled with elegant birds and novel ideas attract few tourists when people are running out of food. We may elect to starve our minds as well as our bodies in pursuit of a Darwinian maximum, although we hope we will become more intelligent than that. Is there any practical value to antbirds? We think them unlikely to turn on our crops or us, blackbird-fashion, in the days when humans have inherited the earth and every surviving thing has begun to evolve inward upon us. If antbirds disappear, will pesky insects of the leaf litter start recycling carbon too fast, resulting in erosion? Will tropical landscapes we hope to convert to me- thanol, ethanol, and sun power (39) suddenly require more insecticides and human work because no army ant or antbird is left to control a new pest? It is theoretically possible for us to trap every ray of sunlight and with them to create humans, in the way King Midas turned things to gold. Were we to do this we would dare not leave anything else alive, lest a second thing be needed to control it. Alternatively, perhaps we should arrange for ants and birds, like trees and rivers and slaves, to have legal standing or rights (10).</page><page sequence="19">BIRDS AND ARMY ANTS 261 Literature Cited 1.
