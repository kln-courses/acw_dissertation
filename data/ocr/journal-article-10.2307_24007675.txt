Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 1997. xiv + 211p., 1+XLVII pl. + 3 maps. € 76.- (ISBN 90-6980-100-0). Drawing together and modelling the résulte of many years of research on the site and the history of Ramtek (Rämagiri) hill, Hans Bakker (B.) présents an impressive study of the history, the religious context and the artistic achieve ments of the (Eastern) Väkätaka rulers. With his work a more comprehensive account of this dynasty, whose Western branch has thus far received greater attention as patrons of the Ajanta caves, is in view. The need for such an ac count is made clear throughout the book, as for example when Β. argues that the development of the Ajanta caves should be seen in relation to Eastern Väkätaka (Hindu) art (p. 3 &amp; 42ff). What B. présents, however, is not a monograph that Covers ail the ramifications of Väkätaka history and its cultural context or of the history of research, but rather an "essay" that aims to delineate a cultural setting and offer fresh views and new data. In service of this goal, he employs "iconology" as a method for investigating the social and cultural context of artefacts by using textual évi dence for the interprétation of the visual material that in turn might again contribute to the understanding of its historical or cultural context. Fully aware that the circularity implied in taking up the issue of "text/icon" and "context" cannot or even should not be avoided in order to make this procédure successful, B. demonstrates not only the well-known interrelation between icons and texts but also their dependence on the larger cultural context and the religious preferences of the clients. Consequently, B. deals with both: The first part of the study (p. 7-92) contains the "context", i.e., "A Short History of the Väkätaka Kingdom" (p. 9ff), a survey of "The Hindu Religion in the Väkätaka Kingdom" (p. 58ff.), as well as a description of "The Väkätaka Sites" (p. 80ff.). The second part (p. 93-159) présents the artefacts in the form of "A Catalogue of Väkätaka Hindu Sculpture" and discusses their iconography and meaning. The two parts of the book are interdependent and thus each part is nourished by the data provided in the other. Sometimes, arguments and data are con tained in a section that one would need in another, which demands some back and forth reading (e.g., the discussion of Mahesvara sites in the section on re ligion would have also been helpful in Part II). However, this problem of pré sentation appears to be in the nature of things, in this case of the iconological approach. The first part starts with "A Short History" (p. 9) of the dynasty. The title is rather an Understatement as B. in fact présents ail the relevant data, discusses the opinions of other scholars and deals with the difficulties and lacunae of the material. Included in the "Appendices" (p. 161-171) is also a new édition of "The Kevala-Narasimha Temple Inscription" (p. 163-167 + photograph), a translation of which, at least of those passages that are referred to in the main text, as, e.g., on p. 17, would have been welcomed. It is an advantage of the study that B. pays attention to matrimonial policy, and it can only be hoped that thanks to his efforts further research in this field will be encouraged.</page><page sequence="2">Anzeigen 261 A remark might be made in this connection on B.'s interprétation of the fact that Queen Prabhâvatï Guptâ married off her daughter to her half-brother. B. points out that this marriage between maternai uncle and niece might be re garded as against the law. His justified réservation about such a judgment might be supported not only by taking reference to the "rule of a dowager" (p. 17), but also by other Indian cases in which this type of marriage is re garded as legal and has been interpreted (e.g., by Th.R. Trautmann) as part of the complex of cross-cousin marriage. It has not become clear to me why B. interprets this alliance as an attempt to "consolidate matrilinear bonds" (ibid.) as this type of marriage confirme the rules of patrilineal descent. These imply that Prabhâvatï has through her marriage left her kinship group that in turn can now be treated as an affinai group, i.e., marriage as an exchange of women between the two groups is again possible. While in the case of matrilinear de scent such a marriage is indeed not possible because brother and sister would be regarded as kin, it still might be argued that it could have stressed a matri lateral bond and/or, even more probable, could testify to a tendency to strength en a matrimonial/political alliance by repeating it in the foliowing génération (as is also the case in cross-cousin marriages). The study proceeds (Ch. II) with a discussion of the Bhâgavata and Mâhesva ra faiths in Vâkâtaka times. B. states that "the archaeological remains of Râmagiri reflect the initial phase of th[e] fusion" of "two ... différent sets of deities" on which "Vaisnavism, as represented in the images found in Eastern Vidarbha, seems to have been focused" (p. 59). While the first set is seen in the Pancavïra group (Sâtvata religion), the second cannot be made out so easily. Vâsudeva Krsna as représentative of the Bhâgavata faith as well as the com bined worship of Krsna and Balarâma are mentioned as the possible second set, but Nârâyana of the Nârâyanïya section of the epic and the avatâras of Visnu are also referred to. Ail the relevant figures in this highly interesting process of blending and retaining différent deities are mentioned by B. B. has, in this connection, an interesting explanation for a passage in the Nârâyanïya section (Mahâbhârata 12.332.13-18) that describes the ascent to Vâsudeva in which the soul passes through the other "Sâtvata" gods such as Aniruddha. The ascent starts, according to the passage, when the soul has passed the sun, called "gâte". B. interprets this as indicating that the place of Sâmba, the fifth Vrsni deity, has been taken by Aditya, the sun (p. 62). Al though it is possible that the author of the passage is referring to the older concept of the sun as a gâte to a heavenly world (e.g., Mundaka Upanisad 1.2.11) and thus as indicating death (cf. MBh 12.332.14a where it is stated that ail limbs are burned by this heavenly fire), B.'s interprétation is worth pursuing. It might allow us to get a better grasp on this "fifth" deity which was associ ated with the Vrsni caturmürti group in a still not fully explained way (and also on the relationship between Sûrya, Samba and the depiction of Nârâyana as a god with solar features in the Nârâyanïya). With regard to the fusion of the différent Strands, B. suggests that the Sâtva ta religion was integrated into that of the Bhâgavatas by creating abstract Pâftcarâtra on the one hand and by making Krsna and Balarâma avatâras, of Visnu on the other. It remains, however, open as to what is meant by "Vaisnava"</page><page sequence="3">262 Anzeigen and what exactly is referred to as "Bhägavata religion"; e.g., would B. view the Bhagavadgïtà and the Näräyanlya as documents of the Bhägavatas or is this term to be applied to the blending and juxtaposition of cults in the fourth and fifth centuries A.D.? The impression of juxtaposition and sometimes even of a fusion of cults as a characteristic feature of the epoch is also corroborated in B.'s more detailed analysis of êaiva, i.e., Mähesvara, religion that is according to him also characterised by an intertwining of différent strande, i.e., Päsupata theology and the iconographie features of a Mahesvara cult popularized inter alia through the Mahäbhärata. He convincingly delineates the theological as well as iconographical distinction between Sadäsiva (aniconic or semi-iconic représentation) and Mahesvara (iconic, anthropomorphic) that became relevant for the Väkätakas. This is one of the many cases in which the füll strength of B.'s iconological method and his usage of a large spectrum of texts (in par ticular Epics and Puränas) becomes apparent. Plurality, the apparently non-exclusive religious preferences of the respective rulers, and matrimonial alliances that seem to have also allowed the rétention of matrilateral identity emerge as characteristic features of this dynasty. That this is the case is also supported by B.'s discussion of the Väkätaka (Hindu) art in Part II. The detailed iconographical analysis of the respective works of art is time and again extended to iconological interprétations that apart from identifying a sculpture aim at defïning its possible meaning within the Väkätaka cultural setting. B.'s suggestions in cases of difficult identifications are intrigu ing as well as substantial: note, for example, his interprétation of the remark - able multi-tiered images from Mandhal (pl. I-II &amp; VII-VIII) as Mahesvara (p. 95ff.) and Sadäsiva (p. lOlff.) respectively. In support of this interprétation, these images might also be seen against the backeround of earlier developments of Visvarûpa iconography, both Vaisnava and Saiva. The difficulties that one encounters in interpreting the coexistence and/or fusion of Vaisnava or Krsnaite cuits in the textual sources reappear on an iconographical level. The identification of a sculpture as representing either Vâsudeva and/or Visnu appears to be open to discussion, as does the question of when the two can be equated. This holds true for the identification of an image from Mandhal (pl. XIX-XX) as Vâsudeva (in the discussion of the image the deity is also called Visnu [p. 119]) in contrast to an image from Nagardhan called Visnu (pl. XXVII and p. 128) that could also be regarded as Vâsudeva. B.'s discus sions stimulate such considérations. It is also thanks to B. that a catalogue is now available that meets not only documentary, but also aesthetic standards. With this study Râmagiri and the other sites of the Eastern Väkätakas now have the prospect of being studied by a wider public. B.'s attempt to make sense of the archaeological remains and to ask for the cultural-historical con text should inspire future research on this and other dynasties. It is to be hoped that this exemplary monograph will provoke further iconological studies or at least deeper considération of the question of text/icons and context by drawing on larger académie or even theoretical discussions.
