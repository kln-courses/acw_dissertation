<plain_text><page sequence="1">POETRY IN THE ECOSPHERE Del Ivan Janik Human beings have broken out of the circle of life, driven not by biological need, but by the social organization which they have devised to "conquer" nature: means of gaining wealth that are governed by requirements conflicting with those which govern nature. The end result is the environmental crisis, a crisis of survival. —Barry Commoner I the crisis that ECOLOGiST barry commoner describes has become all too apparent in the short time since such warnings began to receive public attention; it is manifested in the air and water pollution that plague the industrialized nations, in the actual or threatened dis appearance of many species of plant and animal life, and in the depletion of the natural resources which are the foundation of modern technological civilization. The immediate causes of this crisis are of course complex, but they can ultimately be traced to the fundamental attitudes which western man has taken toward his physical environ ment. The historian Lynn White, writing in Science, suggests that the contemporary world-wide upset is due basically to the nineteenth century marriage of science and technology, both of which have their roots in the assumption underlying the great western religions that everything in the physical world exists only to serve man's purposes. The world-wide expansion of the influence of western culture in the centuries coinciding with the scientific, industrial, and technological revolutions has led to the almost universal acceptance of the ethic of aggrandizement that is embodied in the Book of Genesis. Leo Marx, also in Science, sees modern technological man's behavior as being based on "an arrogant conception of man, and above all of human consciousness, as wholly unique—as an entity distinct from and po tentially independent of, the rest of nature." It has become clear that piecemeal responses to the ecological crisis are hopelessly inadequate. Withdrawal to the remaining wild places of the earth is a frivolous personal gesture; the environmental "clean 395</page><page sequence="2">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW ups" halfheartedly begun by progress-oriented governments ignore the depth and universality of the problem; equally halfhearted moves toward curbing the growth of human population can at best merely delay catastrophe; and further applications of the technological exper tise which itself brought about the crisis are almost certain to ex acerbate it unless such efforts can be coordinated to prevent the cure of one environmental ill from becoming the cause of another. What is needed is a revolution in consciousness, the development of an ecologi cal consciousness that looks beyond the anthropocentric assumptions that dominate modern thought. This does not mean an atavistic "return to nature," but a sensitive and sophisticated awareness of the independent existence of the non-human and its absolute value be yond its instrumentality for human ends. Such a consciousness exists, and not only among contemporary ecologists and environmental activists; it has been evidenced in the appearance in the twentieth century of imaginative literature, partic ularly poetry, which offers an alternative to the anthropocentrism that dominates our culture. I am not referring to "nature poetry" like that of Wordsworth or even of Thoreau, which in spite of its celebration of rural and wilderness scenes still viewed the non-human in terms of its human signification. The poetry I have in mind is characterized, first, by an awareness of the non-humanity of nature; a biocentrism founded on a respect for the integrity of the non-human. This awareness has often taken the form of a conscious withdrawal from the viewpoint of the human speaker, an attempt to understand the universe as it is experienced by a hawk, an otter, a fish. Secondly, this new con sciousness involves a poetic expression of what Barry Commoner calls the first law of ecology: "Everything is connected to everything else." II Of the poets I intend to discuss in this connection, William Carlos Williams was perhaps the least consciously committed to the prin ciples I have outlined, but their presence in his work stemmed directly from his conception of the nature and function of poetry. The best known and most succinct statement of Williams' poetic credo comes from the first book of Paterson: "No ideas but in things." Williams saw traditional western art as "sentimental"—in other words, anthropo centric—and to that sentimentalism he opposed a scrupulous objec tivity. In the eccentric prose of Spring and All, Williams denounced 396</page><page sequence="3">ECOSPHERE traditional literature's insistence upon viewing nature exclusively in terms of its utility in illuminating human attitudes and behaviors. Crude symbolism is to associate emotions with natural phenomena such as anger with lightning, flowers with love it goes further and associates certain textures with What I put down of value will have this value: an escape from crude symbolism, the annihilation of strained associations, complicated ritual istic forms designed to separate the work from "reality"—such as rhyme, meter as meter and not as the essential of the work, one of its words. . . The word must be put down for itself, not as a symbol of nature but a part, cognizant of the whole—aware—civilized. It should be clear that Williams does not mean "civilized" in the accepted sense, but in a broader, biocentric context; the poem, like the poet and the external objects he describes, is a thing among things—a part of the total environment, the ecosphere. The job of the poet is to render, as clearly and thoroughly as he can, the relation ships among the things of the world. Williams' early poem "To a Wood Thrush" demonstrates that in order to do this the poet must overcome his habitual anthropocentrism. The poem begins in an almost Keatsian evocation of the wood thrush "singing across the orchard/ before night"; but it suddenly breaks off: First I tried to write conventionally praising you but found it no more than my own thoughts that I was giving. No. What can I say? Vistas of delight waking suddenly before a cheated world. The poem confronts the inadequacy of human language and concep tion to deal with natural fact; and while it might be argued that the final lines attempt to ascribe to the bird a sudden "delight" and an awareness of the "cheated world," it must be remembered that "no ideas but in things" does not mean that ideas are to be wholly excluded from poetry. Ideas—abstractions about the world—must not only be grounded in the things of that world; they must remain in those things, in their simplicity and in the complexity of their inter 397</page><page sequence="4">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW relationships with other things. "To a Wood Thrush" has as its subject not only the objective fact of the bird's song, but also the objective fact of the poet's perception of it. Williams was above all a poet of the senses. He wrote in the essay "Yours, O Youth" that the function of literature was the conveying of accurate information: "We see every advantage to a man in up-to date information made his own through experience of its significance in his environment. This is knowledge. Spurious information is that which is unrelated to the contacts of experience." This insistence on the literary primacy of the "contacts of experience" led Williams to a sensual recognition of the interrelatedness of things. "Flowers by the Sea" is an example of how Williams expressed this perception of radical connectedness. When over the flowery, sharp pasture's edge, unseen the salt ocean lifts its form—chicory and daisies tied, released, seem hardly flowers alone but color and the movement—or the shape perhaps—of restlessness, whereas the sea is circled and sways peacefully upon its plantlike stem That the focus is on the total environment perceived by the poet is emphasized by the transposition of accustomed metaphors: the flow ers take on the characteristics of the encroaching water, while the sea sways on a "plantlike stem." But the environment of Williams' poetry is not an idealized world of untouched nature. The critic Alan Ostrom has observed that there are three classes of "things" in Williams: man, the natural world, and the class of made things, "coming between the [first] two classes to disrupt the needed (and theoretically normal) contact between them." This, Ostrom explains, is not the world Williams wanted, but the one he saw. In "Raleigh Was Right," Williams warned against false poetic sentimentality about nature, which is really only an inversion of anthropomorphism. We cannot go to the country for the country will bring us no peace What can the small violets tell us 398</page><page sequence="5">ECOSPHERE that grow on furry stems in the long grass among lance shaped leaves? Though you praise us and call to mind the poets who sung of our loveliness it was long ago! long ago! when country people would plow and sow with flowering minds and pockets at ease— if ever this were true. "Nature" is only meaningful to man insofar as he is, and recognizes that he is, a part of it. There are still flowers, deep in the country or among the urban cinders, but we cannot celebrate them without also recognizing the objective existence of stalled traffic and polluted lakes. Williams' ecological message is implicit in his very approach to po etry: the world is out there; it is not human; and it cannot be ignored, because man is inevitably connected to every part of it. Ill In "An Elegy for D. H. Lawrence," Williams honored his fellow poet in a manner that revealed his awareness of the connections between Lawrence's writing and his own. Throughout the poem the fact of Lawrence's death is juxtaposed with images of the non-human world, which is imagined not as mourning (the conventional pathetic fallacy) but as living out the multiplicity of lives that Lawrence in his own poetry had sought to describe. Unlike Williams, however, Lawrence did not begin with a poetic approach that rejected anthropocentrism; his early "nature poetry" was little distinguished from the verse of his Georgian contemporaries. Here there's an almond-tree—you have never seen Such a one in the north—it flowers on the street, and I stand Every day by the fence to look up at the flowers that expand At rest in the blue, and wonder what they mean. It was not until his third volume of poetry, Look! We Have Come Through!, that Lawrence developed the voice and the attitude that characterized his mature poetry. It was there that Lawrence aban doned traditional rhymed stanzaic forms and adopted free verse, for 399</page><page sequence="6">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW reasons quite similar to those Williams later expressed in Spring and All. Traditional forms were inadequate to Lawrence's conception of living reality, because they seemed to permanently "fix" it as a biologist fixed living tissue with formalin. Lawrence saw reality not in fixity but in change. He insisted, as in his essay "Poetry of the Present," that poetry must focus on the objective existence of things in their vital relationships with other things, in the ongoing flux: "There must be the rapid momentaneous association of things which meet and pass on the forever incalculable journey of creation: everything left in its own rapid, fluid relationship with the rest of things." Look! We Have Come Through! presents a newly married couple's difficult journey toward understanding, and it centers on the man's gradual realization of the absolute "otherness" of his wife—his realization that she is in no way an extension of himself. Finally he recognizes that this perception applies to the rest of the natural world as well, and that only when this is admitted can things attain their full being. The blazing tiger will spring upon the deer, undimmed, the hen will nestle over her chickens, we shall love, we shall hate, but it will be like music, sheer utterance, issuing straight out of the unknown, the lightning and the rainbow appearing in us unbidden, unchecked, like ambassadors. Birds, Beasts and Flowers, Lawrence's next collection of new poems, expanded upon this sense of the "otherness" of the non-human, expressing his realization of its absolute value independent of man. "Bare Almond Trees" illustrates the change in the nature of Law rence's perceptions. Wet almond trees, in the rain, Like iron sticking grimly out of the earth; Black almond trunks, in the rain, Like iron implements twisted, hideous, out of the earth, Out of the deep, soft fledge of Sicilian winter-green, Earth-grass uneatable, Almond trunks curving blackly, iron-dark, climbing the slopes. The emphasis is now not on the trees' possible "meaning" for the poet, but on the objective fact of their existence within their specific environment. The most explicit expressions of Lawrence's concept of "otherness" appear in the "Creatures" and "Reptiles" sections of the volume, which record confrontations with alien creatures which men 400</page><page sequence="7">ECOSPHERE have traditionally regarded as sinister antagonists or simply as sources of food. In the well-known poem "Snake," the speaker comes upon a snake at a water-trough and vacillates between awe based on the reptile's godlike self-sufficiency and revulsion founded on folklore. Finally he flings a log at the creature, and it withdraws beneath the earth. The speaker immediately feels regret: For he seemed to me again like a king, Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld, Now due to be crowned again. And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords Of life. And I have something to expiate; A pettiness. In "Fish," the speaker makes an effort to project himself into the wholly different consciousness of the "other" that lives beneath the water, but finds that this is radically impossible. In one sequence he catches a small fish, and its separateness is suddenly impressed upon him. He sees the "mirror-flat bright eye" and feels in his hand the "mucous, leaping life-throb," and realizes, "I am not the measure of creation./ This is beyond me, this fish./ His God stands outside my God." Lawrence's sense of the absolute individual worth of each living thing and at the same time of the fundamental interdependence of all life seems to have developed partly out of observations like that recorded in "Fish" and partly out of his understanding of the mystical and practical union of primitive societies with their natural environ ments. According to Lawrence, the pre-Columbian Indians and the ancient Etruscans sensed and revered the mana, the immanent spirit ual force, inherent in all things. In the essay "New Mexico" he wrote of the religion of the American Indians, "the whole life-effort of man was to get his life into direct contact with the elemental life of the cosmos, mountain-life, cloud-life, thunder-life, air-life, earth-life, sun life." It is this sense of the living environment that Lawrence felt to be missing from the modern experience. The poems that followed Birds, Beasts and Flowers repeatedly focus on the contrast between Lawrence's view of man as he exists in the modern world, "absolved from the sun and the earth and the moon," and man as he could be if he lived in harmony with his environment. Rejecting the tradition which asserts that man, separate from and superior to his surroundings, was created to exploit them for profit and pride, Lawrence concluded Apocalypse, 401</page><page sequence="8">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW one of his last books, by offering an alternative: "What we want is to destroy our false, inorganic connections . . . and re-establish the living organic connections, with the cosmos, the sun and earth, with man kind and nation and family. Start with the sun, and the rest will slowly, slowly happen." IV The poet whose name has been most closely linked with the contem porary environmental movement is neither Lawrence nor Williams but Robinson Jeffers, whose phrase, "not man apart," has been adopted as the name of the magazine published by the organization Friends of the Earth. Yet Jeffers' poetry is not biocentric in the sense I have been describing. His long narrative poems, set in the California coast country, emphasize human relationships, and a recurrent theme in his shorter lyrics is a myth of a total destruction of civilization which would leave a triumphant unspoiled world. This view is unreal istic and even overly optimistic, for it fails to take into account the realities of modern technology's effects on the ecosphere. Never theless, Jeffers' poetry is touched with an awareness of the value of non-human life and of man's effect on his organic—and inorganic— environment. Jeffers shared with Lawrence the conviction that the proper study of a poet extends beyond man to "non-human nature," which offers a perspective that promotes greater understanding and humility. Many of Jeffers' short lyrics celebrate nature's creative destructive ecological relationships. "Fire in the Hills" describes the flight of threatened animals from a forest fire, watched by predatory eagles that circle above. In "Fawn's Foster Mother," Jeffers' per ception of the interdependence of living things is extended to the human sphere, as an old woman remembers how, when she had her second child, she also nursed a day-old fawn her husband had found in a fern-brake. "Boats in a Fog" evokes a primitive life that is ennobled by the necessity of a closeness between man and nature. One by one, trailing their leader, six crept by me, Out of the vapor and into it, The throb of their engines subdued by the fog, patient and cautious. Coasting all around the peninsula Back to the buoys in Monterey harbor. A flight of pelicans Is nothing lovelier to look at; The flight of the planets is nothing nobler; all the arts lose virtue 402</page><page sequence="9">ECOSPHERE Against the essential reality Of creatures going about their business among the equally Earnest elements of nature. This is the life that Jeffers longed for but found impossible in the modern world. Yet there is a grudging hopefulness in Jeffers' poetry, and the injunction of "The Answer" stands parallel with Lawrence's counsel that we must "start with the sun." Organic wholeness, the wholeness of life and things, the divine beauty of the universe. Love that, not man Apart from that . . . IV In the works of two poets of a later generation, Theodore Roethke and Ted Hughes, the ideas of the independent value of external nature and its interdependence with the life of man are less central, but they are insistently and eloquently expressed. Roethke's poetry is full of close, loving observations of nature, many of them related to his boyhood experiences in and around the greenhouses his father had owned. The early poem "Cuttings" exemplifies Roethke's fascination, shared with D. H. Lawrence, with the minute details of living things. One nub of growth Nudges a sand-crumb loose, Pokes through a misty sheath Its pale tendrilous horn. Significantly, Roethke focused not just on individual living things but on whole environments, man-made as well as natural. Like Williams and Lawrence he was aware of the paradox of the separateness and interconnectedness of things. The ferns had their ways, and the pulsing lizards, And the new plants, still awkward in their soil. The lovely diminutives. I could watch! I could watch! I saw the separateness of all things! My heart lifted up the great grasses; The weeds believed me, and the nesting birds. There were clouds making a rout of shapes crossing a windbreak of cedars, And a bee shaking drops from a rain-soaked honeysuckle. The worms were delighted as wrens. And I walked, I walked through the light air; I moved with the morning. 403</page><page sequence="10">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW As this poem, "In a Field of Light," suggests, however, his sense of interconnectedness, almost a mystical merging, was the more exciting concept for Roethke; he was finally interested in man, and in man's place in the larger natural context. His view was not, like Jeffers', that man is unworthy of nature, but that man is a part of nature—not only potentially but in fact—and that therefore both equally deserve the attention and concern of the poet. Yet Roethke's sense of the ultimate unity of things does not in his eyes absolve man from his responsibility to the whole. In "Moss-Gathering," Roethke described one of his tasks as a worker for his father's greenhouse business: he would go into a swamp and cut patches of turf for lining cemetery baskets. But something always went out of me when I dug.those loose carpets Of green, or plunged to my elbows in the spongy yellowish moss of the marshes: And afterwards I always felt mean, jogging back over the logging road, As if I had broken the natural order of things in that swampland; Disturbed some rhythm, old and of vast importance, By pulling off flesh from the living planet: As if I had committed, against the whole scheme of life, a desecration. The poem reveals a sense of guilt at the human exploitation of nature that resembles the feeling of "pettiness" that Lawrence expressed in "Snake." The human education that leads one to hate or to exploit nature is more than petty; it is a desecration, a behavior unworthy of and inadequate to the larger scheme of life of which man is only a part. Ted Hughes' poetry shares with Roethke's an ultimate emphasis on man and his inner identity; but often, like Roethke's and Lawrence's, it focuses outward, on the living things with which man shares the ecosphere. Hughes' poem "Fern," like Lawrence's "Bare Almond Trees" and Roethke's "Cuttings," communicates the separateness and significance of every manifestation of life. The mouse's ear unfurls its trust, The spider takes up her bequest, And the retina Reins the creation with a bridle of water. 404</page><page sequence="11">ECOSPHERE And, among them, the fern Dances gravely, like the plume Of a warrior returning, under the low hills, Into his own kingdom. The final simile does not center in its human component; rather, it uses a human image to communicate the nature of a being that in its "gesture" provides "the one note of silence/ To which the whole earth dances gravely." Another Hughes poem, "Pike," presents a con frontation that is reminiscent of Lawrence's "Fish." Hughes empha sizes the pikes' predatory nature: whether they are tiny inhabitants of an aquarium or huge denizens of a pond, they are alien, mysterious, and somehow dangerous. The ancient pond of the poem . . . held Pike too immense to stir, so immense and old That past nightfall I dared not cast But silently cast and fished With the hair frozen on my head For what might move, for what eye might move. It is not any actual danger that causes the speaker's fear, but a recognition of the pikes' "otherness": a realization that behind the eye of a pike there is an unfathomable alien intelligence. "Hawk Roost ing" is an attempt to put aside the human consciousness completely and enter that of another being. The hawk speaks: I sit in the top of the wood, my eyes closed, Inaction, no falsifying dream Between my hooked head and hooked feet: Or in sleep rehearse perfect kills and eat. But the poem is also an indirect comment on man's view of the universe. It is the nature of the hawk, living outside history, to kill for sustenance and take no thought for the consequences of its actions. The hawk's point of view is logically unassailable. No arguments assert my right: The sun is behind me. Nothing has changed since I began. My eye has permitted no change. I am going to keep things like this. For the hawk this "attitude" is inevitable; in man it is inexcusable, for 405</page><page sequence="12">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW he knows, or should know, that he cannot "keep things like this" by continuing his own thoughtless predation. V The impulse, almost by the time of these poems by Hughes an unconscious movement, toward a biocentric poetry, a poetry of the ecosphere, has come to consciousness in the work of the contemporary American poet Gary Snyder. The following note appears in Snyder's "Lookout's Journal" on July 28, 1952: —If one wished to write a poetry of nature, where an audience? Must come from the very conflict of an attempt to articulate the vision poetry &amp; nature in our time. (reject the human; but the tension of human events, brutal and tragic, against a non-human background? Like Jeffers?) It is clear that Snyder does not mean a "poetry of nature" in the traditional sense, for he recognizes that his impulse has a peculiarly contemporary source, and that there was at least one general prece dent for what he wanted to attempt. Snyder did not adopt Jeffers' particular formula, but his own approach to the "poetry of nature" came out of sources similar to those which underlay the work of Jeffers, Lawrence, and the other poets discussed here. As a lookout for the Forest Service in the Pacific Northwest, Snyder developed the habit of close observation that is also reflected in the poetry of Wil liams, Lawrence, and Roethke. His contact with non-western cultures fostered in him a mystic awareness of the oneness of nature like that towards which Roethke was striving; and Snyder's interest in primi tive cultures, particularly the American Indian tribes, contributed to his sense of the possibility of a relation to the natural world other than that assumed by the anthropocentric West. Snyder's poetry is based on intense observation of the non-human and its relation to man. He writes in Earth House Hold, "Of all the streams of civilized tradition with roots in the paleolithic, poetry is one of the few that can realistically claim an unchanged function and a relevance which will outlast most of the activities that surround us today. Poets, as few others, must live close to the world that primitive men are in: the world, in its nakedness, which is fundamental for all of us—birth, love, death; the sheer fact of being alive." Snyder recog nizes, like Williams and Lawrence before him, that a poet of nature can only record his observations, and cannot force human inter 406</page><page sequence="13">ECOSPHERE pretations on natural events. He is in the position of the primitive who can respond to the external world only with wonder. A small cricket on the typescript page of "Kyoto born in spring song" grooms himself in time with The Well-Tempered Clavier. I quit typing and watch him thru a glass. How well-articulated! How neat! Nobody understands the ANIMAL KINGDOM. In Snyder's poetry, as in Jeffers', there are constant reminders that man is part of a larger whole; yet Snyder's awareness of the relation ship between man and his natural environment is revealed not on a cosmic scale but on an intimate level, with humility and precision. And Snyder moves beyond Jeffers, and beyond the other poets dis cussed here, in his sense of conscious purpose. He sees his poetry not only as literature but as a path to a new consciousness which may in turn eventually affect man's practical relations with his environment. Snyder sees himself not only as a poet, but as a poet-revolutionary. The poem "Long Hair" imagines an environmental revolution from within. Once every year, the Deer catch human beings. They do various things which irresistibly draw men near them; each one selects a certain man. The deer shoots the man, who is then compelled to skin it and carry its meat home and eat it. Then the Deer is inside the man. He waits and hides in there, but the man doesn't know it. When enough Deer have occupied enough men, they will strike all at once. The man who don't have Deer in them will also be taken by surprise, and everything will change some. This is called "takeover from inside." Deer trails slide under freeways slip into cities swing back and forth in crops and orchards run up the sides of schools! Deer spoor and crisscross dusty tracks Are in the house: and coming out the walls: And deer bound through my hair. These poets offer a new tradition, a new consciousness that denies the prevalent anthropocentric, exploitative world-view. The tradition has 407</page><page sequence="14">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW its roots in nineteenth century Romanticism and in non-western literatures and the beliefs of primitive societies. The consciousness has arisen in these poets through a variety of experiences: the habit of close objective observation that for Williams and Lawrence was at the heart of the poetic impulse; the experience of Roethke in his father's Michigan greenhouse; the isolation of Jeffers on the Carmel coast, Hughes at an outpost in East Yorkshire, and Snyder in the mountains of America and Japan. And this new tradition of a poetry of the ecosphere is coming to purposeful self-awareness in Snyder's most recent work. The question that remains is whether the deer can take over men's minds in time; whether the revolution in consciousness that these poets and their poems represent comes too late.
