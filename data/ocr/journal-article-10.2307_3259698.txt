<plain_text><page sequence="1">90 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE is to be attributed far more to his affinities with borrowings from Greek thought than from the Hebrew tradition" (p. 63) and "the emphasis he placed on sin and indeed his very conception of its nature was non-rabbinic in character. If it was Jewish at all it was that Judaism of the Diaspora, profoundly modified by its Greco-Oriental religious development" (p. 72). On page 67 comes the remarkable statement: "Proselytizing was unknown to traditional Judaism" a view which though G. F. Moore partly shared it, is contradicted by St. Matthew; and on page 78 the eschatology of I Cor. 15 is described as a Greek not a Jewish "mystery." On page 84 Paul is depicted as "the founder of a new religion," but on p. 169 it is said that "in its specific charac- teristics, Paul's ethics turn out to be the ethics which Jesus had preached in terms simply of the imminence of the Kingdom of God." A curiously one-sided bibliography concludes the book. ROBERT P. CASEY By Light, Light. The Mystic Gospel of Hellenistic Judaism, by Erwin R. Goodenough, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1935. The serious defect of many books which claim to deal with the history of religion is that they heap together unnecessary detail on well known fact and do very little else. They do not perceive the difference between information and understanding. The result is that many "learned" books merely duplicate informa- tion, and it is delightful to find in Goodenough's By Light, Light a book remarkable for its addition to understanding, though it also adds to information. The question asked and answered in By Light, Light is: What was the religion of Philo, and how did it affect his theology? I will venture to paraphrase the answer: In the Hellenistic world in the centuries immediately preceding the Christian era the anthropomorphic theology of the Greeks had been changed by its impregnation with philosophy. Edu- cated men no longer really thought of their spiritual necessities and the satisfaction of those necessities in anthropomorphic terms, but in philosophic ones. They formulated their spiritual needs in terms of "reality," which is infinite, and untrammeled by material limitations, and they believed that sometimes at least they could break the limitations and reach the reality beyond. The limitations were "humanity" and the reality beyond was by implication "deity". This is termed Mysticism by Goodenough, and I think cor- rectly. But one of the most pressing necessities of intellectual</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 91 life in all ages is to express relationship to traditional forms by affirmation or negation. The Hellenistic world desired partly to deny the anthro- pomorphism of the past, partly to retain a verbal connection with the phraseology used by their ancestors. Thus in Egypt and wherever Egyptian ideas had travelled, the myth of Osiris and Isis was used to express the mystical experience. The Orphic and Dionysiac "Services", as we might call them, were similarly used. That is the real explanation of the rapid growth of "Sacra- mental" or "mystery" religions. Ultimately all the national religions of the East had been transfigured in this way. To some of their adherents, the anthropomorphic names of the deities probably seemed to be the real thing, and the mysticism was merely strange doctrine, to others the mysticism was the real thing, and the anthropomorphism merely typology. Goodenough emphasizes this fact and insists that to the more educated the continued use of traditional language about, for instance, Isis or Osiris, was not really a concession to mythology. The initiates into the mysteries did not believe the mythological element to be objectively true; it was to them only a typological expression of mysticism. This seems true in the case of educated persons; probably not true for uneducated ones. It would be strange if Judaism had escaped this process which "mysticized" Egyptian and Oriental cults, yet it has often been said that such was the case. It has also been said that Philo, like Melchisedek, had no predecessors and no successors. Goodenough argues that neither proposition is true: Philo represents a wide- spread Jewish mysticism, much influenced by Orphic thought, parallel to the cult of Isis which in Plutarch represents mysticism applied to Egyptian religion. Moreover, from the Philonic writings it is clear that he was not the first of his kind. We think that Goodenough is right and commend his work as intro- ducing a neglected factor to all who are interested in early Christianity. In chapters I-III he shows how Philo makes use of the Israelite myth in much the same way as Plutarch made use of the Egyp- tian. Probably Philo did not go quite so far as Plutarch, but the extremists whom Philo castigates in the De Migratione A brahami certainly did so. Goodenough then devotes five chapters to discussing the posi- tion of the Patriarchs, and shows how closely their position approaches that of a "Lord" in the other sacramental cults. Indeed he has convinced us that it is extremely probable that an educated Alexandrian Jew of the extremist party and an educated Egyptian had exactly the same religion, expressed it</page><page sequence="3">92 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE by exactly the same use of mythology-though not the same mythology-and had the same disbelief in the objective truth of those or any other myths. In the tenth chapter Goodenough discusses the possibility of discovering traces of this mystical Hellenized Judaism in other writers than Philo and gives a very valuable summary of the chief documents of Hellenistic Judaism. I would however ven- ture one slight protest. Goodenough obviously feels that Helle- nistic Judaism was the triumph of Greek thought over Jewish. Doubtless in one sense this is true. Hellenistic Judaism only existed because of Greek thought and would not have existed without it. Nevertheless Philo certainly thought of himself as a Jew and Judaism is the religion, culture, worship and theology of living Jews. Jews make Judaism, not Judaism Jews, just as Christians make Christianity, not Christianity Christians. Of course there is a tendency in all religions to resist change: the Prophets were bitterly opposed by the upholders of the old religion of Israel; just as Hellenistic Judaism was by the Pales- tinian scribes. The Hellenistic Jews were unsuccessful, and the Prophets won. The triumph of the Prophets remade and revivi- fied Israel. The success of the Palestinian scribes limited Judaism and Hellenistic Judaism perished in Alexandria; the synagogue won the battle, but lost the war, for most of the Hellenistic in its theology reappeared in Christianity and here it was trium- phant. Nevertheless it was once a genuine Judaism. A wider recognition of the enormous importance of Hellenistic Judaism for the history of Christianity will probably be the most impor- tant result of Goodenough's book. The last chapter of this book is devoted to a discussion of Bousset's exposition of the evidence for thinking that there is a Jewish source behind the liturgical parts of the Apostolic Constitutions. It is a little strange to read that this admirable essay (in the G'tt. gel. Nachr.) is said to have been somewhat neglected. It is certainly well known in Germany, where Pro- fessor Lietzmann once told me that in his opinion it was Bousset's finest work. Bousset admittedly never made clear that these prayers belong to a "mystic" cultus of the Hellenistic diaspora. In future this view must be seriously considered. Finally, the attention of New Testament scholars should be called to the following problems which, if not all raised for the first time, are certainly emphasized by Goodenough's work. (1) How far had the Mystic school spread into Rome and Corinth? The discussion of Paul's epistles to the Romans and Corinthians has usually resolved itself into a consideration of the part played by Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians,</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 93 with "God-fearers" as a third class. It has usually been assumed that the Jewish Christians belonged to the Rabbinic type. Hence- forth the possibility that they belonged to "mystic" types must be tested. (2) Similarly is it not probable that Pauline or deutero-Pauline phraseology akin to Philo's, comes from the "mystic" Judaism, and are not many "Pauline" phrases in the Christian Liturgy taken from the "Mystic Liturgy," which was also used by Paul, rather than from Paul directly? Goodenough obviously leans to this view and, I think, correctly. (3) It is curious that Philo's "scripture" is that of the Saddu- cees, not of the Pharisees. Have we sufficiently reckoned with the possibility that some of the Sadducees, even in Jerusalem, were mystic in religion as well as Hellenized in customs? KIRSOPP LAKE Visio Sancti Pauli, by Theodore Silverstein, Studies and Docu- ments IV, Christophers, London, 1935. The Visio Pauli is one of the most important of the later Apocalypses which seem to have had so much influence on the thought of ordinary Christians as distinguished from theologians. It was undoubtedly written in Greek but it is doubtful whether it is a product of the fourth century or of the third. It describes Saint Paul's visit to the abode of the departed whether damned or blessed. It was early translated into most of the languages both of the East and of the West and in Latin was frequently edited and revised throughout the middle ages. It was undoubt- edly known to Dante and other writers so that the Latin text is Geschichte der alten Kirche, Vols. 1-2, by Hans Lietzmann, de Gruyter, Berlin, 1935-36. It is becoming clearer every day that just as the Old Testa- ment is ceasing to be a separate discipline and can be studied only as part of ancient Oriental history, so the New Testament can no longer be distinguished sharply from Church history on the one hand, or from the story of Hellenism on the other. There- fore though it is impossible to review at length Professor Hans Lietzmann's History of the Early Church, it is an agreeable duty to call attention to it, for it gives a better short account of the historical results of modern critical investigations of the New Testament than can be found elsewhere. I wish there were a translation. KIRSOPP LAKE</page></plain_text>
