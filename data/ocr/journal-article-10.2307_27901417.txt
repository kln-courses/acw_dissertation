<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XLIV, No. i January, 1934 THE MONIST A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS UNDER the term 'Forms' in the title are included the 'Categories' of Hegel's Logic, and the 'Notions' of his Philosophy of Nature and Spirit, considered as Uni versals determined through the pure activity of Reason; and the present article is designed as a study of Hegel's or dering of these Forms, with suggestions for renaming and reordering them-not in a spirit antagonistic to that of Hegel, but in the hope of clarifying and somewhat simpli fying Hegel's own thought and intention. Preliminary to such a study, some consideration must be given to the method by which the philosopher has attained his results. THE DIALECTICAL METHOD As Croce, McTaggart, and other commentators have demonstrated, it is only in a relatively small number of cases that the first and second members of Hegel's triads can in any literal sense be described as "opposites" of each other. A thorough examination of the Logic, indeed, will disclose at least three quite dififerent kinds of relationship between thesis and antithesis. That of Opposition in the strict sense obtains in such pairs as Being-Nothing, One Many, Repulsion-Attraction (treated by Hegel as ele ments in the synthesis of the One and the Many), Identity Difiference, Universal-Particular, Cognition-Volition, etc.1 Most of these, it will be observed, belong to the general sphere of Being. ll follow usually the order in the Encyclopedia (cited hereafter as Enc), using Wallace's translation (Oxford, 1892). References thereto are to sections.</page><page sequence="2">THE MONIST A second relationship is that of Correlativity rather than opposition. This type is found especially in the sphere of Essence, for reasons which Hegel himself clearly states (Enc. 112). Notable examples are Essence-Appearance, Force - Expression, Inner - Outer, Substance - Accident, Cause-Effect; also Subjective-Objective in Notion and in the Philosophy of Spirit. A third important type of triad is based on a principle which we may call that of Determination-a passage from "indefinite, incoherent homogeneity'' to "definite, coherent heterogeneity," in the language of Herbert Spencer. This is exemplified by such transitions as those from being-in General to Determinate Being, and from Quantity in Gen eral to Quantum, in the Logic; from Mechanics to Physics, and from the Physics of Individuality in General to the Physics of Particular Individuality in the Philosophy of Nattire; from Beauty in General to the Types of Art in the Aesthetics; and from Religion in General to the Particular Religions in the Philosophy of Religion. Many triads, indeed, do not seem to exemplify any of these three principles, but simply to represent an advance in three stages-as notably the final triad in the Logic (Art, Religion, Philosophy). And yet in all these cases a fairly good defense may be made of Hegel's view that thc second of each pair is the opposite-or at least the correlate or determinate-of the first. Another especially interesting tendency is observable, however, in the working out of Hegel's method to which some attention should be given. Although in most cases the second member of a triad is simply the antithesis, in one of the three senses just indicated, of the first, in others there is a totally different situation: the first member is the undifferentiated source, as it were, of the total move ment, and the second is a differentiation of the first into</page><page sequence="3">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 3 two opposing or correlated elements, which the synthesis unites in a higher form. In other words, whereas in the usual triad, the third member is a synthesis of the first and second ; in the latter type, the third member is a synthesis of the two parts of the second, which in turn is a differen tiation of the first. This is exemplified by the basic triad of all-that of Being, Essence, and Notion. Being, Hegel tells us, is simple, immediate, undifferentiated ; in Essence, however, everything is mediated by something else. This is why the categories of Essence are always in pairs, the second member of which is a reflection of the first. The proper complete title of the second sphere of the Logic, therefore, is not merely "Essence," but "Essence-Appear ance" ; and Notion is from this standpoint the synthesis of Essence and Appearance, rather than of Being and Es sence. Another example of this type of development, in a much more restricted field, is found in the Greater Logic,2 where Being-for-Self as Such (thesis) differentiates into the One and the Many (antithesis) ; whereas in the Encyclopedia (96f.), the One and the Many are respectively thesis and antithesis within the category of Being-for-Self. In such cases as these, I propose to apply the term "anti thesis" to the second stage in the triadic development as a whole, and to denominate its two members prothesis and metathesis respectively. That is to say, in the basic triad of the Logic, Being is thesis, Essence is prothesis and Ap pearance metathesis of the antithetic stage, and Notion synthesis. Finally, the problem of the relation between any given synthesis and the following thesis is recognized by all com 2To be cited as GL.

On the whole, however, Hegel's general inten tion seems to be to regard the third member of a triad not so much as the actual completion of the first two, but as the transition to the next thesis, which latter alone marks the real advance. Thus Becoming, though it does unite Being and Nothing, is really but the transition from sim ple Indeterminate Being to Determinate Being. That is to say, by "Being" Hegel means "Anything-at-all" ; now Anything-at-all is Nothing-in-particular; but when Any thing - at - all becomes Something - in - particular (i.e., Nothing passes into Being), we have something definite a Determinate Being. Becoming, therefore, is the process whereby Being Indefinite is transformed into Being Defin ite, and this latter alone is the goal of the first triad of the Logic. This type of advance is exemplified also in the Greater Logic, where the last category of Being is de nominated "Transition to Essence."4 In such cases I suggest that the term panthesis be adopted for any category or notion regarded as including and "sublating" the three parts of an earlier triad, the term "synthesis" being retained in its traditional sense as denoting the third element of a triad: thus, Becoming is the synthesis of Being and Nothing, but Determinate Be ing is the panthesis which includes Being, Nothing, and Becoming as moments. In the basic triad, again, combin ing* this suggestion with that offered on a previous page, 3See McTaggart, Studies in Hegelian Dialectic (to be cited hereafter as McTL), sec. 80; and the same author's Commentary on Hegel's Logic (McTL), sec. 13. GL, Vol. I, p. 403. Cf. McTL, sec. 20.</page><page sequence="5">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 5 we have the following situation: the thesis is obviously Being; the antithetic stage is that of Essence (prothesis), with its expression in Appearance (metathesis) ; Actual ity, rather than Notion, is the synthesis of all the antitheses of this sphere-Essence and Appearance, Ground and Ex istence, Inner and Outer, etc. ; and Notion is the panthesis which includes and sublates the previous moments. If this interpretation of the dialectic is at all acceptable, the fundamental movement seems to be somewhat as fol lows: (i) the presentation of a thesis-simple, undiffer entiated, immediate; (2) the differentiation or "diremp tion" of this thesis into two antithetical (in some sense of that term) elements, each of which "mediates" the other, and the second of which (metathesis) "reflects" or ex presses the first (prothesis)-i.e., in other words, thesis "goes forth" from itself (as prothesis) into its "other" (metathesis) ; and (3) the reunion of prothesis and meta thesis in synthesis-the return of the original thesis to itself in more complete form. Every complete category or notion, therefore, is a panthesis which develops or explicates itself in the manner indicated. Between Being in its simplest form (the primal thesis of the dialectic) and the final cate gory in the Logic (the terminal panthesis), each larger category is at once panthesis, relative to the previous triad or triads, and thesis, relative to the succeeding ones. As panthesis, it includes and transcends ("sublates") all pre vious triads as elements in itself ; as thesis, it is the source of all later categories. Assuming that in his Logic Hegel was endeavoring to trace the process whereby Reality unfolds its own inner na ture, and reveals it in fuller and fuller form to the eye of reason ; and that the nature of that process is as analyzed above ; we may now proceed in our task of examining the working-out of the plan of the dialectic, making bold to</page><page sequence="6">6 THE MONIST suggest certain modifications which the writer hopes may serve to clarify and simplify Hegel's own thought. And in pursuance of this aim, we shall cheerfully pass over many difficult matters of detail, and concentrate so far as is possible upon the main outline. THE LOGIC With this plan in view, we shall suggest at the outset a revision of the terminology of Hegel's basic triad. In its simplest form, Reality is conceived merely as Being5 that which is; and I see no reason for not accepting Hegel's term in this case. But regarding Essence and Notion, something more must be said. For common sense, things simply are just what they appear to be: the sphere of Being, then, is the sphere of common sense. But deeper thought looks beneath the sur face of things, and grasps Reality no longer as merely that which is, but as that which appears, and as in itself more than what it appears to be-in other words, Appearance is thought of as the superficial expression of some under lying Essence. Now historically this conception of Reality as something which "underlies" phenomena has been known as the substantialistic conception of things. I pro pose, therefore, that this second stage of the dialectic, this second level of definition of Reality, be designated Sub stance rather than Essence. Substance is not merely a cate gory within the broader sphere of Essence; on the con trary, Essence is but one side (the "inner") of the con cept of Substance-the thesis of the dialectic of Substance, rather than the whole of that dialectic. Furthermore, in this whole division of the Logic Hegel is describing Reality in substantialistic terms-which, for a monist, means in ?r&gt;Words designating Forms, and used in the technical sense of Hegel, or of the present reconstruction, will be printed with capitalized initials; and when presented for the first time, will ordinarily be italicized.</page><page sequence="7">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 7 Spinozistic terms. And that Hegel himself permits us to interpret him thus is confirmed on reading his introduction "On the Notion in Generar' to the second volume of his Science of Logic? where he discusses the now transcended view of things predominantly in terms of Substance, and the term "Essence" quite takes second place. The sphere of Substance, however, is the sphere of scientific rather than philosophical thought, for philosophy must view the world not merely as a system of mutually re lated but distinct entities, but as a unity, a whole which transcends its parts. This is the "holistic" view of things, so prominent in contemporary as well as Hegelian thought. For Hegel, as for Lotze and the later personalists, Per sonality is the highest category descriptive of Reality, and it is "Personality" which I shall suggest as a more illumin ating term than Hegel's own "Absolute Idea." It is a term, moreover, which Hegel himself gives us every encourage ment in several places to use-as, for example, in the Preface to his Phenomenology of Spirit, where he tells us that "everything depends on grasping and expressing the ultimate truth not as Substance only but as Subject [i.e., Personality] as well."7 In the Encyclopedia, again, he tells us that God is not merely "Absolute Thing," as with Spin oza, but "Absolute Person" (Enc. 151 Z)8; and in the Greater Logic, that the chief defect of Spinoza's philoso phy consists in the fact that Substance, his highest cate gory, "lacks the principle of Personality."9 In the section "On the Notion in General" already referred to, Hegel tells us that "the consummation of Substance.... is no longer Substance itself, but something higher-the Notion, &lt;&gt;Johnston and Struthers, Vol. II, pp. 211-216. "Baillie's translation, second edition, p. 80. Italics mine. ^Z-Zusatz. Johnston and Struthers, Vol. II, p. 168.</page><page sequence="8">8 THE MONIST the Subject"T ; and in the concluding pages of his Science of Logic, that the "richest/' "most concrete" term of all is "personality," which "comprehends everything within it self."11 That the Notion is the Ego or Selfhood we are also assured more than once in the larger work12; and in both versions the Idea is described as "Subject-Object," a term which is equivalent to Selfhood.13 It is in this third division of the Logic that Hegel's terminology seems most urgently to call for revision. Though the philosopher's intention in using the terms No tion, Idea, etc., is fairly clear, certainly to say that the highest conception of Reality is that which defines it as Notion or as Absolute Idea, is to use unnecessarily tech nical and obscure language. I therefore suggest the term Spirit as the best general term for this third division. The three levels of definition of Reality, then, are Being, Sub stance, and Spirit, respectively. In proposing these terms I do not feel that Hegel's meaning is being distorted, but rather clarified. On the basis of this general analysis, then, we may proceed to our study of the principal categories in each division.14 I. THE DOCTRINE OF BEING The three divisions of Being are justified by Hegel on the ground that (A) Quality is "the character identical with Being," (B) Quantity "the character external to Be ing," and (C) Measure "the unity of the first two." (Enc. 85 Z.) In these three, then, we have what we may call the InternalUy of Being, the Externality of Being, and the lOIbid., p. 214. n/W., p. 483. izibid., pp. 217, 347, etc. ixibid., p. 398; sec. 214. i^The suggested reconstruction is tabulated at the close of this article. This may easily be compared with the arrangement of the GL by reference to the Table of Contents of McTL, and with that of the Enc. by consulting the convenient chart at the end of W. T. Stace's Philosophy of Hegel.</page><page sequence="9">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 9 Union of Internally and Externality, respectively, consti tuting a well-founded triad-i.e., one in which the general principles of the dialectic are correctly applied. The three subdivisions of (A) Quality also constitute a well-founded triad. McTaggart speaks of the "ambiguity with which Hegel uses the word Being" (McT.L., p. 14), and also many other words which appear more than once in his list of categories. I cannot see, however, that there is any real ambiguity, as the distinctions in meaning are al ways perfectly clear ; but whatever confusion there may be is quite easily avoided by varying the words slightly in each case. The first general category of Quality may be called, for example, (1) Being-in-General, Indeterminate Being, or "Anything"; and the first category under this, (a) Pure Being. Being, then, is the primal thesis of the dialectic: in Fichtean language, Being "posits" itself; then, as prothesis, "opposits" to itself (b) Non-Being or Nothing (metathesis)15; and these two are 'composited1 in (c) Becoming, which is the synthesis of Being and Non Being. In Becoming is involved the idea of something definite "coming into being" from something else; hence, we have through it arrived at the next stadium of Quality -(2) Determinate Being or Something-which is, as for merly explained, the panthesis that involves the elements of the previous triad in itself. In the development of Determinate Being, there is a notorious diversity between the two versions of the Logic. A full comparison and criticism of these would lead us too far afield. I will therefore merely suggest and briefly de fend a revision that seems to me to bring out in simpler form the essential points of Hegel's analysis. Any determinate Something is so only in relation to 15For reasons which will appear in the discussion on Quantity, the term "Non-Being" is preferable here. This is a purely qualitative term, whereas "Nothing" inevitably implies "absence of quantity."</page><page sequence="10">IO THE MONIST something Other. The fundamental antithesis, then, seems tobe between (a) B eing-in-It self (prothesis) and (b) Be ing-in-relation-to-Anothcr (metathesis), though for Hegel this is but a minor distinction in the course of the account in the Encyclopedia (sec. 91), As every definite Something tends to pass over into its "Other"-to "alter" itself, or make itself its "Alter"-the synthetic process which unites Self and Other is, in Hegel's language, (c) Alteration. Tn this process of Alteration, however, it is seen that each Something is limited externally by its Other-hence the category of (i) the Finite, as the bounding of each Some thing by its Other. But as the process of mutual limitation continues by the very nature of things indefinitely (Enc. 93), we have the category of (ii) the False Infinite-of that which is the opposite of the Finite, and therefore false ly conceived, (iii) The True Infinite, on the contrary, is that which includes but transcends the Finite, and so is synthetic in its relation to the two lower categories. He gel's discussion of the qualitative Finite and Infinite, there fore, seems to me to find its most natural place under the category of Alteration. With the category of the Infinite we reach that of (3) Being-for-Self-or ^//-determined Being, as distinguished from that which is determined by an external Other; ot that essentially permanent reality of a thing which per sists throughout all of its "alteration." But to be "for-Self" is to be (a) One individual thing; and the very idea of One involves that of (b) Many others of the same kind, with their (c) Mutual Relations of Repulsion md Attraction. The simple analysis of the Encyclopedia seems to me here far more satisfactory in every way than the elaborate one of the Greater Logic.1* With the category of the Many in Relation to one an i6See McTL, pp. 40f.</page><page sequence="11">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS I ! other, Quality passes into (B) Quantity. The opposition here consists in the fact that Quality is inherent in a thing, and to alter the quality of a thing changes the thing; whereas Quantity is external to the nature of a thing, and to alter it (within certain limits, as the later category of Measure makes clear) does not change the thing. It is evident that Hegel thinks of the principal categor ies of Quantity as parallel to those of Quality-Quantum, for example, is the "Determinate Being of Quantity" (Enc. ioi Z). If the sphere of Being constitutes a unity, with common characteristics distinct from those of Es sence and Notion, this situation is to be expected ; and yet it can hardly be contended that the dialectic of Quantity as Hegel works it out fulfils this expectation. The analysis may be so reconstructed, however, as clearly to show this parallelism, and at the same time, I think, in a way which does full justice to the intention of Hegel. Quantity is first considered, then, in its general nature -(i) Quantity-in-General. As with Being-in-General, Quantity in its general nature means (a) All there is, Quantity as Universal. The distinction between continu ous and discrete quantity, and the need of uniting them in the general conception of Quantity, may be treated as a subtriad of All ; recognizing, in the arrangement of this subtriad, what McTaggart has demonstrated (M-cT.L. sec. 51)-viz., that continuity is the original character of Quantity, and that the passage from continuity to discrete ness marks a real advance in the idea of Quantity. The subtriad might then read: (i) Quantity as Continuous, (ii) Quantity as Discrete, (iii) Union of Continuity and Discreteness. As Being inevitably leads to Non-Being, so All neces sarily implies its opposite-(b) Nothing, or Zero; and as Becoming is the pasage from Non-Being to Being, so is</page><page sequence="12">12 THE MONIST (c) Number the passage from Nothing to All. Number thus seems to appear far more naturally as the synthetic element of Quantity-in-General, than as a synonym for, or subdivision of, Quantum. Furthermore, it is under Number, is it not, that the idea of an infinite progression first appears, (i) Number as Such is a finite category; but if carried through, the summation of numbers continues on indefinitely, and we find ourselves on the way to (ii) a Quantitative Infinite Progression: the "truth" of Num ber, however, is to be found in (iii) the Infinite as Synthe sis of Finites, finite numbers being elements in the total, rather than the total an unattainable "always yet to be." Wih the category of Number we pass to the second main category of Quantity-that of (2) Determinate Quantity, or Quantum (Extensive Magnitude). As De terminate Being is the product of a process of Becoming, so every Determinate Quantity is the product of a process of Numbering, and is indicated by some specific number. Like Determinate Being, again, each Quantum is first it self-(a) This Quantum-set over against many (b) Other Quanta; but only in (c) the Sum of All Quanta can the perfection of the idea of Quantum be found. With this category, we are not simply back again at the original con ception of Quantity-in-General, for there has been a pro nounced advance in the interval. Rather have we now at tained the point at which the idea of Quantum or Exten sive Magnitude passes into that of (3) Degree, or Inten sive Magnitude. With this last concept, again, the idea of Quality reappears, though, as just indicated with reference to Quantity-in-General, at a higher level. Degree would seem to be a category not calling for any further analysis, but rather leading on immediately to the final category of Being, in which Quality and Quantity are completely united.</page><page sequence="13">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 13 This final category, (C) Measure, is treated in much simpler fashion in the Encyclopedia than it is in the Greater Logic, but even the briefer analysis calls for reconsidera tion. By Measure, Hegel means a Standard by which things are measured. Let us call the two antithetic sub categories ( i ) the Measure as Standard and (2) the Meas ured, respectively. When the object measured does not "measure up to the standard," we have conflict between these: the "truth" of Measure, then, the fulfilment of its meaning, is found in (3) the Agreement of Measure and Measured. Now the distinction of Measure and Measured is just the kind of distinction that we find characterizing the sphere of Essence. Being as Measure is no longer in its immediacy, the very idea of Measure involving that of something mediating something else. We are ready, then, to give our attention to that which I have already proposed to call III. THE DOCTRINE OF SUBSTANCE The conception of Reality as Substance differs from the conception of it as Being in that we now think of it no longer merely as that which is, but as distinguished into an Inner and an Outer aspect, of which the latter is the expression of the former, and the former that which "un derlies" the latter. The relation of Inner and Outer is bet ter treated in this manner, I think-not as a specific cate gory-pair as in Hegel's own analysis, but rather as a kind of paradigm of the whole second division of the Logic.17 The analysis differs considerably in the two versions of that work,18 and the reconstruction herein proposed will be found to deviate still further from the original presenta tions. In both versions of the Logic the three principal ITThis arrangement also offers an interesting parallel to the contrast be tween Quality as Internally, and Quantity as Externality, of Being. 18 See McTL, secs. 152-154.</page><page sequence="14">THE MONIST categories are denominated Essence, Appearance, and Ac tuality; following a more common custom, which I am sure does no damage to Hegel's thought, I propose the term "Existence" for the second of these, thus making the triad read-Essence, Existence, and Actuality. This procedure will be justified further as we advance ; but if Existence is the "going-forth" of Essence, and Ap pearance the "shining-for th" of the same, these two con cepts are synonymous if not identical, and the position of the Greater Logic in placing Existence and Appearance together in the second division of the "doctrine of Essence" would seem preferable to that of the Encyclopedia which separates widely these two categories. Furthermore, if the Thing is the union of Essence and Existence, it would seem to belong in the third rather in either the first (as Encyclopedia) or second (as Greater Logic) division. Our analysis of (A) Essence will approach nearer that of the Greater Logic than that of the Encyclopedia, but the category of Show we shall place where it undoubtedly be longs-in the second division. Essence, as the "inner side" of things, then, will contain only what Hegel calls the "cate gories" or "determinations of reflection"-(i) Identity, (2) Difference, and (3) Ground. His own discussion of these may suffice, the main point seeming to be that "the true essentiality of anything" consists in referring it to some Ground which unites Differences in Identity (Enc. 121). As Ground of Existence, Essence now passes imme diately into its opposite. (B) Existence is the "going-forth" or "oppositing" of Essence. In its original extreme form, Existence is (1) "Mere" Appearance, or Show-that which is as far as possible from Reality. As such, Appearances are con trast e! with things as they are in themselves-i.e., the</page><page sequence="15">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS I 5 category of (2) Thing-in-Itself is the veritable antithesis of Appearance. But the true relation between Reality and Appearance is not that of opposition or mutual exclusion, but of correlation and interdependence; hence Existence correctly conceived is (3) Phenomenon-not a mere "shin ing" (Schein), but the "Shining-Forth" (Erscheinung) of essential Reality. As Hegel puts it, "to show or shine is the characteristic by which Essence is distinguished from Being"; "the Appearance.... does not stand on its own feet, and has its being not in itself but in something else" (Enc. 131 and Z). Thus, whereas for Kant a phenomenon is a human representation of Reality, for Hegel it is the forth-shining of Absolute Reality.10 The category of Phenomenon, or Appearance, or Forth-Shining, being that which synthesizes Mere Ap pearance and Things-in-Themselves, carries us directly to the third main division of the sphere of Substance-that of (C) Actuality, which is the complete unity of Essence and Existence, "or of Inward with Outward" (Enc. 142). Actuality, Hegel tells us, is always reasonable ; but Exis tence abstracted from Essence may often be unreasonable. The two versions of the Logic diverge considerably in their analysis of Actuality, and neither is very satisfactory from the strictly logical standpoint. Besides, the category of Thing as union of Ground and Existence (Enc. 125) must find its true place here, as we have stated above. I propose, therefore, the following principal triad, whose correspondence with those of Quality, Quantity, etc. is obvious-Actuality-in-General ; The Thing, or Determin ate Actuality; and Relation. (1) Actuality-in-General will have as its analysis the three subcategories Possibility, Contingency, and Neces sity. In the Encyclopedia these are not treated as cate 19See Windelband, History of Philosophy, English tr., p. 611, note 3.</page><page sequence="16">i6 THE MONIST gories at all, but merely as aspects of Actuality; and in the Greater Logic they are subcategories in the second division of Actuality. Their true place, however, seems to be here. (a) Possibility is the inner or formal condition of Actuality, (b) Contingency its outward or material character as fact, and (c) ATcccssity the carrying to completeness of the union of the previous factors. In this statement are con densed six important sections in the Encyclopedia (143 148). In this connection also Hegel touches on the subject of free will (Enc. 145 Z). As the Infinite is falsely thought of as opposed to the Finite, so for the ordinary "under standing" Freedom means Contingency and is opposed to Necessity. This, however, is a False Freedom, true Free dom transcending Contingency altogether, and being iden tified with a higher type of Necessity which becomes ex plicit only in the sphere of Notion or Spirit. Necessity being that which "determines" things, we come to our second category, (2) The Thing, or Determin ate Actuality. This is not the "thing-in-itself" which mere ly "exists" in opposition to Essence, and so is unknowable; but the Thing as union of Essence (Ground) and Exis tence-for Essence is the Ground not only of Existence in general, but also of all particular existents. The Thing is first considered as (a) a Substratum (Hegel's category of Materien, "Matters") possessing (b) Properties. This ar rangement reverses Hegel's order, but seems more in ac cordance with that philosopher's general principles; the Thing an sich is not the thing as possessing properties, as in the Encyclopedia (and in a similar fashion in the Greater Logic), but the thing as "underlying" and abstracted from its properties, the Properties themselves being the "Other" of the Thing-"mere" Accidents. Combining these we have the false notion of Substance so harshly criticized by</page><page sequence="17">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 1/ Locke and Hume under the ludicrous delusion that they were thereby refuting Aristotle and the Scholastics. The true conception of Substance, however, is that which, as Aristotle and Hegel agree, regards (c) Substance as Syn thesis of Matter and Form. "The numerous diverse mat ters coalesce into the one Matter," and the "distinct proper ties and their external relation.... in the thing constitute the Form" (Enc. 128), Substance being the unity of its Ac cidents rather than the substratum thereof.20 With the category of Substance-as-Synthesis we have brought the concept whose dialectic we have been follow ing since the category of Essence (i.e., Substance-in-Gen eral, or the substantialistic view of Reality) to its explicit formulation. Only one more step remains-to bring to gether the hitherto separated categories of Actuality-in General and the Thing. This synthesis is accomplished in the category of (3) Relation. This we may further desig nate the Actuality of Things; for in their Actuality-even from the purely logical standpoint, to say nothing of the empirical facts, with which however we are not yet con cerned-no Thing is an isolated unit, but is by its very na ture related to other Things. Relation in its primal (thetic) form is simply (a) Ac tivity, and with this concept of Activity we pass from the static to the dynamic view of Things so commonly repre sented in contemporary thought by the term "Event." This category, therefore, is the equivalent of Hegel's pair, Force and Manifestation-the Thing conceived as expressing it self and its inherent powers in some external Activity. Through its own Activity, and through that alone, does each Thing come into external relations with other Things : hence, the second (antithetic) form of Relation is that of - The parallel with the distinction between the true and false concep tions of the Infinite is evident.</page><page sequence="18">i8 THE MONIST (b) Causality, or External Determination. The nature of Causation has been so thoroughly canvassed by friend and foe alike (including Hegel himself), that it will suffice here just to remind ourselves that whereas in the naive view (i) Cause and (ii) Effect are distinct things (or events, if we advance to the scientific view), and that from that standpoint a "First Cause" is perfectly conceivable; yet from the higher philosophical standpoint, every Cause is also Effect, and every Effect also Cause, and a First Cause or Causa Sui is inconceivable. The "truth" (Hegelianly speaking) of the causal relation, therefore, is found in the idea of (ii) Interaction, or Reciprocal Activity. In this suggested reconstruction of Hegel it is to be observed that A Reconsideration of the etc., Gal. 7, The Monist, Jan. we not only reject entirely our philosopher's deduction of Causality from Substantiality, the erroneousness of which is I think fairly widely admitted, even by sympathetic critics ; but also that, in divergence from both Hegel and Kant, we think of Reciprocity, not as a species of Relation coordinate with Causality (and Substantiality), but as the logical "truth" or explication of Causality itself-i.e., Cau sality itself is a reciprocal causality. Finally, with the idea of a world of interacting things we arrive at the synthesis in the triad of relations-viz., the category of (c) Totality or Wholeness, The World as a S elf-Determined Whole. Here properly belongs, I think, Hegel's paired category of the Whole and its Parts, the Whole being conceived as a unity with properties not found in the parts or their sum-the historic conception which is known in contemporary philosophical literature as "Hol ism." At the close of the discussion of Essence in the Ency clopedia, and in the introduction to the doctrine of Notion</page><page sequence="19">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 19 in the Greater Logic, Hegel presents his conception of Freedom as "the truth of Necessity" (Enc. 158; G. L., Vol. II, p. 212), continuing the preliminary statement of the subject cited above (p. 15). In the sphere of Substance, Necessity is the essential guiding principle ; but in passing from the sphere of Substance to that of Spirit, we pass also from the realm of Necessity to that of Freedom. And yet, Freedom is not the opposite of Necessity, as the ab stract understanding would have it to be, but rather Neces sity at a higher "level," as we would say today. "Necessity indeed qua necessity is far from being freedom : yet free dom presupposes necessity, and contains it as an... . ele ment in itself" (Enc. 158 Z). Necessity as such is deter mination from without: Freedom is ^//-determination. In the category of Causality, therefore, we have the idea of Necessity in its most explicit form; but when we pass on to the higher category of Totality, we approach also the idea of Freedom, since the Whole cannot be determined by anything but itself. It is only an "approach" to real free dom, however, for the World of Actuality is after all the World of Relativity. Its freedom is therefore still but a relative freedom : it leads ns on to the Absolute Freedom ofSpitit, but we attain this Absolute Freedom only in the third general stage of the dialectic. III. THE DOCTRINE OF SPIRIT The use of the world "Spirit" for the third great stage of the Dialectic has already been explained (pp. 8f.). The highest conception of the Absolute is that which defines it as Spirit-ultimately, as we shall see, as Personality. In Spirit, as Hegel says of Notion, is found "the truth of Substance" (Enc. 158), and so the union of Substance with Being, the return of the Absolute to itself. For the three</page><page sequence="20">20 THE MONIST divisions of Spirit, I propose the names of Subjectivity, Ob jectivity, and Organism; in the first two following the terminology of the Greater Logic, and using the term "Or ganism" more or less in the Whiteheadian sense as the most appropriate one that I can think of for the third place. Spirit, then, is first conceived (A) as "Subjective", as "pure thought" thinking, as it were, in vacuo, apart from objective reality.21 First of all, again within the field of Subjectivity, Spirit is ( i ) the simple Notion, the Concrete Universal of Reason which, as distinguished from the ab stract "concept" of the understanding, the concept of formal logic, includes (as the subsequent analysis shows) all particulars within itself. By restricting the term in this way, we apply it in its most natural sense, and at the same time obviate whatever ambiguity there may be in Hegel's usage. The analysis of the Notion yields, as with Hegel, three moments: (a) Universality, the self-identity of the No tion; (b) Particularity, the differentiation of the Notion; and (c) Individuality, the "actuality" of Notion (Enc. 163), the union of the Universal and its Particulars. The "universals" of formal logic are really, as Peirce used properly to call them, "generals"-or, in Crocean lang uage, "pseudo-concepts"-separated from the particulars of ordinary experience; the true Universal, on the con trary, the "concept" of Croce and the "Notion" of Hegel, has "the character of thorough concreteness" (Enc. 160 Z), and differentiates its particulars from within itself. Hegel's Realism of Universals is, therefore, the converse 211 cannot at all agree with McTaggart (Commentary, sec. 183) that "for Hegel, Subjective does not mean mental," but "particular, contingent, and capricious." Contingency and caprice have already been transcended in the third division of Substance, and Particularity will be transcended in the first division of Spirit. Certainly the categories of Subjectivity are just as "uni versal, necessary, and reasonable" as those of Objectivity or Organism.</page><page sequence="21">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 21 of that of the scholastics, its motto being "Res in Univer salia." In the Notion itself, however, the particulars are im plicit only: (2) Judgment is the product of an analysis which makes these particulars explicit, and so is the "real ized particularity of the Notion" (Enc. 165). At this point Hegel enters upon his critique of the classifications and analyses of the traditional logic. It would be quite profit less for us to pursue the same course here, so I do not pro pose to enter upon the matter at all. Let it suffice, there fore, merely to record the third step in the dialectic of Sub jectivity. Every judgment is the combination of two dis tinct Notions, subject and predicate, and by itself is groundless and abstract; in (3) Syllogism, however, as the word itself implies, there is a true synthesis of Notions and Judgments-the three terms of the two premises, by vir tue of the middle terms, unite in a single Notion in the con clusion. In Syllogism, furthermore, Subjectivity completes itself and passes over into its opposite. (B) Objectivity is the fulfillment of the subjectivity of "pure thought," and Subjectivity the ground of objective reality. Hegel's analysis of Objectivity in the Encyclopedia seems to me on the whole a true one, and the additional subdivisions in the Greater Logic unnecessary. I have no revisions to suggest, therefore, expect to propose the term "Finalism" rather than "Teleology" as a more symmetri cal (shall we say?) name for the synthetic category. The three "moments" are distinguished primarily by their con ception of the nature of Objects in their relation to one another: (1) in Mechanism, each object is regarded as "immediate and undifferentiated" (Enc. 194 Z), as inde pendent of all other objects, and the relation between them as merely external; (2) in Chemism, each object is re</page><page sequence="22">THE MONIST garded as a fusion of many more elementary objects, which "are what they are only by their relation to each other," and so lose their distinctive characters in those of the larger whole; (3) in Finalism, objects are related in such a way that each retains its distinctive character, and yet is sub servient to the ends of the whole. The subdivisions of Mechanism and of Teleology or Finalism, in the Encyclo pedia I leave untouched: the latter, however, call for a few words of comment. McTaggart has contended (Commentary, secs. 255, 260) that Hegel uses the terms "Means" and "End" in a different sense from that of ordinary language, and yet vitiates his argument by confusing these two usages. I cannot accept this criticism. "In their common and un Hegelian sense," says McTaggart, Means and End are regarded as distinct from each other, and "Means exist only for the sake of the End, while the End exists for its own sake"; but "in their Hegelian sense/' there is no such separation, and Means and End are thought of as intrin sically related. But this is not properly described as a dis tinction between Hegelian and unHegelian usage, but rather as one between what Hegel himself so carefully de scribes as the standpoint of Immanent and External Tele ology respectively. The latter may be the common and ordinary sense of these terms, but it is also a part of Hegel's sense, though of course the other is for Hegel the "truer" meaning. A brief consideration of Hegel's analysis may make this clear. The three "moments" of Finalism are: (a) the Sub jective End, or Design-the end as a plan in the mind ; (b) the Means, as the objective working out of the design ; and (c) the Realized End, as the product of the union of Design and Means, or of the application of the Design to the</page><page sequence="23">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 23 Means. The Means is here the middle term which enables the Subjective Design to be Realized Objectively. So long, however, as we remain in the second stage, we have hard ly advanced beyond Mechanism, since the relation between Means and (Subjective) End is still a merely external one: in other words, Finalism is at this stage but an external Finalism, "the point of view taken by Utility" (Enc. 205 Z). If Means and End are quite apart from each other, the Means being merely instruments inserted between the plan in the mind and the object in view7 is the real world, an infinite regress sets in, and we have a fatal contradic tion (G.L., Vol. II, pp. 391-3; Enc. 211 cf. McTL., secs. 259f.). By advancing to the third stage, however, the con tradiction is overcome: "the Realized End is the unity of (Subjective) End and Means," and these latter are no longer conceived as "two realities connected with each other" merely, but as "two aspects distinguishable within a single reality" (McT.L., p. 270). In other words, as Hegel himself assures us, the true "notion" of design is that of "Inner Design" (Enc. 204), the true Finalism an Immanent Finalism. The ancient controversy between Mechanism and Tele ology, Causalism and Finalism, is therefore solved by the Hegelian dialectic. Causalism belongs to the sphere of Substance, the realm of Necessity ; Finalism to the higher realm of Spirit and Freedom. Cause and Effect, though correlative, are in their individual nature set over against each other; and when a Cause "passes into" its Effect, it loses itself in that effect, and altogether ceases to be; the Subjective End, on the contrary, is itself Realized in its objective effect, and "is at the end what it was in the be ginning" (loc. cit.). The idea of Finalism does not, how ever, destroy or supersede that of Causalism ; it merely, in</page><page sequence="24">24 THE MONIST the orthodox Hegelian sence, subordinates and transcends it. With the category of Finalism as ultimately worked out, therefore, we attain the complete union of Subjective and Objective, the inner world of thought and the world of outer reality, and so pass over into (c) Organism, the Hegelian "Idea." The living organism in the biological sense is the best example, Hegel tells us (loc. cit.), of a teleological system. In a somewhat extended sense, there fore, this seems an appropriate term for the final great triad of the Dialectic. And in this usage we have the at least partial backing, as it were, of Professor Whitehead; though personally I hesitate to accept his inclusion of what is below biological life under that term, for we need badly the distinction of organic and inorganic. The usage sug gested here, however, is not subject to this objection, since it is definitely applied to the highest, rather than to every, stage in the deduction of Reality. Organism is a higher category than Totality, for not all wholes are organic wholes, as the argument has shown; Totality, therefore, is the broader concept. In describing Reality as Organism we are defining what Hegel would call the "Idea" as distinguished from the mere "Notion" of Reality, but it is certainly more natural to speak of "the Idea of Reality as Organism" than of "Reality as the Idea." Organism is the unity-in difference of Subjectivity and Objectivity and of all other distinctions. In its lowest form it is ( I ) Life, in which this union of Subjectivity and Objectivity (Soul and Body, as Hegel here denominates them) is merely implicit. Life is, in other words, primarily an objective thing, though containing the germ of subjectivity within it. Hegers terms and subdivisions here are undoubtedly governed too</page><page sequence="25">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS decidedly by empirical biological considerations; but we must remember that we are still in the realm of Logic, and are considering Life as the contemporary philosophical vitalists do-as a supposedly final definition of Reality not as a specific phenomenon of nature. McTaggart asks in this connection (Commentary, sec. 265) whether for Hegel there are many Organisms in the universe or only one; and aswers that for him there are a plurality of Or ganisms in relation to one another, but that in reality "the universe ought to be conceived as one Organism"-"one Teleological System." On this point I am inclined to agree with McTaggart's criticism ; but the difficulty may be ob viated by a revision of Hegers terminology, recognizing his comfusion of logic and biology, as above noted. Sen sitivity, Reproduction, Kind, etc. are certainly biological concepts rather than categories. A strict adherence to the dialectical method would then produce some such triad as the following: (a) Life in General-as characterized, for example, by such philoso phers as Bergson, Joad, and Wildon Carr; (2) the Living Individual Organism, as one of many in external "organic * relations to one another, and yet each in itself a union of "organs" and internal relations; (3) the Universe as an Organic System-of Individuals in organic relation with one another and with the Whole.22 The first of these repre sents Life as an undifferentiated Universal-the position of universalistic vitalism ; the second is the Particularity of Life, its differentiation into subordinate units, each of which is an individual only "by courtesy"-the position of pluralistic vitalism (e.g., the philosophy of Driesch). The term Individuality, however, is found in the third stage, since ultimately the only true Individual is the world as a 22See McTL, pp. 287, 303, 306.</page><page sequence="26">26 THE MONIST whole, the unity-in-difference of Life-this being the posi tion of Hegel himself at this particular stage of the "Idea," and perhaps the final position of "Holism" as taught by most of its advocates. The failure of Life as an ultimate category consists in the fact that though in the living Organism "Soul" (Life itself) and "Body" are undistinguished, Life finds its "op posite" in Death, in which this unity of Soul and Body is broken. We are driven on, then, to a higher category in which Subjectivity and Objectivity may be explicitly set over against each other, and in which Soul (i^X^l) becomes Mind (vov ). For this second category, in order to obvi ate Hegel's quite unnecessary double use of the term "Cog nition," I shall ofifer the perfectly obvious substitute term, (2)Consciousness.2* The general characteristic of con sciousness as the awareness by some subjective Mind of some external Object distinct from itself is commonplace enough to need no further comment. It is here that Hegel, in his subdivisions, makes his most notorious break with the principle of the triad, for he distinguishes but two of these. Even if we are to consider the Abstract Idea as synthesis of Cognition proper and Volition, the error is not corrected; for Abstract Idea is "panthesis" (sup., p. 4) rather than synthesis, and the real synthesis is yet to seek. We shall accept, then, Hegel's "prothesis" and "meta thesis" (sup., p. 3), and attempt to complete the triad our selves. The basis of the analysis is as follows.24 The Universe as an Organic System involves a harmony between each individual in the system and the universe as a whole. Con sciousness involves a contrast between the individual as subjective and the universe as objective. The harmony, See McTL, p. 292. 2467. McTL, secs. 279-293.</page><page sequence="27">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 2/ therefore, may be produced either ( i ) by bringing the Sub jective into conformity with the Objective regarded as fixed, or (2) by bringing the Objective into conformity with the Subjective regarded as fixed, or else (3) by hav ing each in some way conform to the other on equal terms. The first of these constitute respectively Hegel's cate gories of Cognition (in the narrower, which is our only, sense) and Volition, the Theoretical and Practical activi ties of Consciousness ; the third, Hegel neglects altogether. In (a) Cognition or Theoretical Consciousness (Intel ligence), then, Thought (Subjectivity) conforms itself to conditions determined by the Object, the individual subor dinating himself to the universe ; and the goal of this ac tivity, which is the activity of science and philosophy, is Truth. Conversely, in (b) Volition or Practical Conscious ness (Will), Thought endeavors to make Objects conform to itself, the individual to subordinate the universe to it self ; and in this aspect of Consciousness the ideal is that of the Good. "Intelligence" says Hegel (Enc. 234 Z), "pro poses to take the world as it is, Will takes steps to make the world what it ought to be" ; hence arises the contradiction between what is and what ought to be. The harmony be tween them is attained, according to Hegel, by "the process of Will itself," which leads directly to the Abstract Idea; but this solution sufifers from the twofold defect of asym metry in attributing the synthesis to the metathetic element in the antithesis acting apart from the prophetic element, and of failure to distinguish between the transition to the next and final category (synthesis proper) and the goal of that transition (panthesis). The true synthesis, however, must be sought in some aspect of consciousness distinct from both Intelligence and Will, and yet capable of restor ing the balance between the two sides which each of these</page><page sequence="28">28 THE MONIST respectively exaggerates. Such a third and reconciling as pect is to be found in (c) the Emotional life of the soul, the sentiment of Love, whose object and ideal is that of Beauty -not merely in the sensuous or aesthetic, but in the spiri tual sense of that term.2' McTaggart has, with much dif fidence, suggested this completion of Hegel's triad,26 but T see no reason for diffidence, but rather for thankfulness in a frank acceptance of this solution. In Knowledge, Sub jective conforms to Objective; in Volition, Objective con forms to Subjective; in Love, "neither side has the pre eminence," "it is sufficient that the two terms be in har mony"27-"the two sides of the harmony [are] on a level," neither being "subordinate to the other."28 This is the true synthesis of Cognition and Volition, which marks the tran sition from the category of Consciousness to the final cate gory of the dialectic-that of (3) Absolute Self-Con sciousness, Personality, or Spirit in its Explicitness. In defining Reality ultimately in terms of Personality we are conceiving the "Absolute Idea" of Reality, the Ab solute in its all-comprehensiveness; and here again (cf. sup., p. 8) this seems a more natural way of putting the supreme truth of metaphysics than to say in the literal terminology of Hegel that Reality is the Absolute Idea. Every concept of the Logic is a category descriptive of Reality as a whole in one grade of comprehensiveness or another ; the categories of Spirit are distinguished as No tions from the lower categories of Being and Substance, the categories of Organism as Ideas, and the final categorv -r,Cy. Plato, Symposium, 210. ^Commentary, sec. 295 ; Studies in Hegelian Cosmology, secs. 284-302. ^Cosmology, sec. 284. At the close of the second edition of this work, McTaggart appends the following significant final note: "My present view is that every state of consciousness in absolute reality is a state alike of knowl edge, of volition, and of love." This view was developed in his last book, The Nature of Existence, and is certainly profoundly true. 2*McTL., sec. 288.</page><page sequence="29">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 29 of Personality as the Absolute Idea of Reality. Regarding this final category, three things remain to be said. First, in Personality we find not only the unity of The oretical and Practical, as Hegel states (Enc. 236 Z), but also their complete realization, and that of the Emotional as well. Intelligence aims at Truth, Will at the Good, Love at the Beautiful; but on the level of mere Mind, these are Ideals ever unattainable-the standpoint of 'finitude," of "abstract morality" (Enc. 234 Z), abstract understanding, and merely subjective emotion, has not yet been completely transcended. On the higher level of Personality, however, the True, the Good, and the Beautiful attain their harmon ious realization. Secondly, in Personality again we find the synthesis and completion of Life and Consciousness. Organism in general is the "unity-in-difference of Subjectivity and Ob jectivity" (sup. p. 23) ; in Life, however, this complex unity is merely implicit, life itself being primarily objective, though containing the germ of subjectivity (sup. p. 24) ; in Consciousness, Subjectivity, the difference between Sub jective and Objective, becomes explicit (sup., p. 25), but the unity remains but implicit; in Personality, finally, the unity in difference of Subjective and Objective is explicit and complete-the Objective is "over against" the Subjec tive, but also united with it. Thirdly, and most important of all, in Personality, Subjective is no longer merely Subjective but Subject. The term "Object" has been all along freely used as a syn onym of Objective; but "Subject" is a higher term than "Subjective," and by no means equivalent to it, for Sub jective is the source of both Subjectivity and Objectivity. What Hegel says of the "Idea," or Organism in general -that "it may be called" among other things "subject-ob</page><page sequence="30">3 THE MONIST ject" (Enc. 214)-is wholly true only of the "Absolute Idea," or Personality. This is, indeed, the supreme defini tion of Personality, that Personality is Subject-Object;2* as it is the supreme truth of metaphysics that Reality can ulimately be defined only as Personality. Personality being, then, the final category of the dia lectic, the dialectical process closes with it. Within the field of pure thought, there is really nothing more to be done. All that is left for the Absolute as so defined is to pass over into its Other and manifest itself as (not "become," since it is already complete in itself), Nature. But for us, in our description of the Absolute, there is one more thing to be done-namely, to analyze it into its triadic constituents. Such an analysis, indeed, is not a passage to something higher, any more than is the passage to Nature, and Hegel wras entirely justified in refusing to subdivide his category of Absolute Idea; but a complete account should, I think, go one step further. If Personality is Subject-Object, it is the unity-in-dif ference of two factors. These two factors are (a) Person ality as Subject, the Absolute Ego; and (b) Personality as Object, the Absolute Me.T The distinction between Subject and Object is just as clear in Self-Consciousness as in ordinary Consciousness, even though in the former case there is identity as well as distinction between them, and even though it is not until the level of Self-Conscious ness has been attained that the Subjective is truly a Sub ject. The Absolute Ego is also the Ego of Fichte which "eternally posits its own being," and the Absolute Me is the same Ego as object of that positing. This process of "positing," however, does not consist merely in a passive 29See my article, "The Problem of the Self," Philosophical Review, Vol. XLII (1933), pp. 487-499. 30The term Me is to be understood as the Latin word, accusative of Ego; not the English, accusative of "I."</page><page sequence="31">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 3 I contemplation by the Absolute of its own Being, but in ac tivity-the process of "positing" is a dynamic process, a "deed-act": hence the unity of Subject and Object in Per sonality is a dynamic unity which we may denominate (c) Personality as Agent. It is as Agent that the Absolute Ego eternally posits its own being, and it is as Agent that the same Absolute Ego opposits the Non-Ego. With this latter process, however, we are led out of the science of Logic into the Philosophy of Nature or Cosmology. COSMOLOGY Nature is, then, the Non-Ego of Absolute Spirit, the externalization and particularization of the Absolute Ego. But why should the Absolute opposit a Non-Ego ? As Personality, the Absolute is self-sufficient: the passage to Nature is not like that from the lower categories to the higher, a transition from greater to lesser incompleteness, since in the Idea of Personality all defects of the earlier categories are removed and all conflicts solved. The an swer may first be given, perhaps, in the metaphorical lan guage of Plotinus: "the One overflows, as it were, and what overflows forms another hypostasis."31 The tran sition from category to category is motivated by the fact that Reason is dissatisfied with incompleteness, and so must press on until completeness has been attained; the transition from the Absolute to Nature is motivated by the fact that a merely inward completeness is after all in-com plete, and calls for something beyond to fulfill that which is within. Nature, in other words, is set up by pure Thought as material for Thought to work upon, as a prob lem which Absolute Reason proposes to itself; it is the "Anstoss" of Fichte, which originates (as everything ZlEnneads V 2. I quote from Fuller's translation, as found in Bakewell's Source Book of Ancient Philosophy, p. 371.</page><page sequence="32">3^ THE MONIST must) within the Ego, and so is in no real sense a "thing in-itself," but once opposited becomes a stimulus of inter action between the Ego and itself.''2 The solution of this problem, however, the goal of the Ansioss, is the reunion of Spirit and Nature in the spirit of man. Nature is but a stage, a "moment," through which the Absolute passes on its way from the inner complete ness of pure Thought to the final completeness which re sults from this ultimate reunion. The Absolute, in other words, op posit s Nature in order that it may finally 'corn posit' it (we may say) with itself. Hence, the Great Tri ad of Reality in its wholeness : The Absolute, Nature, Fin ite Personality. It is fashionable for even admirers of Hegel to despise and disparage that genius's Naturphilosophie, and cer tainly from the standpoint of modern scientific philosophy the publication of the second section of the Encyclopedia seems like an unfortunate incident in the history of thought. But, after all, modern scientific philosophy has very little if any use for Hegel anyway, or for the type of idealism which he represents; and yet if Hegel zvas an absolute idealist, and was to make any pretense to a com plete system of philosophy, it is hard to see how he could have justifiably neglected an attempt, at least, at a philoso phy of nature. Otherwise there would have been an un reconciled dualism, and so a fundamental contradiction, at the very heart of his philosophy.33 What Hegel is at tempting in this section of the Encyclopedia is to deduce not Nature itself, as a system of things-but the thought of Nature:34 "he endeavors to find the Idea in everything, S^See Fichte, Werke, I, 279. (Quoted by Wallace, in his translation of Hegel's Logic, pp. 405f., as a note to Hegel's criticism in Enc 60 Z (2).

We accept, therefore, the legitimacy-nay, necessity -of Hegel's endeavor in this field: what we may fairly criticize is not his aim or the general trend of his deduc tions, (nor is this the place to discuss the validity of abso lute idealism as such), but the detailed working out of his plan. So bad is this, that we can have but little use for it, and shall not attempt to scrutinize it step by step, as we did the major stages of the Logic; and yet there is much that may and should be said about its broad outlines, as part of the general plan of his philosophy. The categories of Logic are "universals" in the fullest sense of that term-i.e., they are predicable of everything. The "Notions" of the philosophy of nature and of spirit, on the other hand, are only 'generals/ quasi-universals which apply only to some things-those of Nature being sensuous universals, which apply only to certain kinds of physical things. Being, Quality, Substance, Personality, etc., are categories, because everything is Being, has Qual ities, etc. ; but only some things are Vegetable Organisms or Minds, Space and Time and Gravitation apply only within the physical world, Law and Morality and Religion only to persons, etc. The transition, therefore, from Logic to Philosophy of Nature is a transition "from the general sphere of pure universals to the general sphere of sensuous [quasi-] universals."35 The dialectical process of Nature starts with the empti est and most abstract of all Notions applicable to physical nature, that which is at the opposite pole to Absolute Per 35&lt;9/&gt;. cit, pp. 301f.</page><page sequence="34">34 THE MONIST sonality; for, as says McTaggart (Dialectic, p. 239), "since the process of Nature includes all reality below the level of Spirit, its lowest stage must be that at which reality is on the pont of vanishing altogether." When the Absolute opposits its Non-Ego, it passes first to the extreme opposite pole of Being, to that which is almost but not quite Non-Being. The first Notion of Nature, then, is Space, which is in every sense the extreme op posite of Thought, since the essence of Thought is in ternality and the essence of Space is externality. From this abstract starting-point, the dialectical pro cess passes by the usual logical stages to the most concrete of all natural Notions ; the entire scheme presenting, as Dr. Stace is fond of reminding us,36 a philosophy of evolution which needs only the temporal claim introduced by science to give it empirical content and make it complete. Evolu tion as a merely temporal process is quite devoid of philoso phical significance, the later stages not being necessarily any "higher" in terms of value than the earlier. Hegel shows that the process of evolution can also be interpreted as a logical and teleological process. "The philosophy of nature," says Mr. Stace, "gives us a series of natural Forms of increasing value," an advancing revelation of the presence of Reason in Nature, which reaches its goal in the realm of Finite Spirit. The general triad of Nature corresponds to the three categories of Being in the Logic: Mechanics, the indeter minate Being-in-General of Nature ; Physics, its Determin ate Being; and Organics, its S elf-Determinate Being, or Being-for-Self. So far we have a distinctly logical process, independent of any empirical considerations, and necessary 36&lt;9/\ cit., pp. 313-315.

(I) Mechanics is, in Hegel's cosmology, Nature con sidered in its most general and abstract features, its Uni versality. Concepts in the field of scientific mechanics and astronomy must be rigidly excluded from any revision of that cosmology. Pure reason can tell us nothing of the solar system in its relation to the rest of the celestial uni verse, of the relation between matter and motion, or of the ultimate motive of gravitation. The proper subordinate tri ad within the sphere of Mechanics is, I would suggest, Space, Time and Matter. Properly defined, these are strict ly a priori concepts, necessary if Nature is to be rational, regardless of any specific theories or conclusions about them in the field of mathematical physics. (A) Space is, as already indicated, Pure Externality, the abstract form of physical nature; (B) Time is, so far as physical nature in general is concerned, the "opposite" or correlate of Space, possessing properties in every way parallel with but opposed to those of Space.38 In a sense Professor Alex ander is right in describing Time as the "Mind of Space" :3i) if Space is the pure externality, Time is the Internally, of Nature. All physical phenomena are "in," and can be thought of only as in, Space; all mental (as well as physi cal) phenomena, similarly, "in" Time. Hence, in passing from Space to Time, we are also passing from that which is purely physical to that in which first appears the germ of spirituality. But contemporary physics hyphenates these two Notions, and in so doing leads us in good Hegelian a7Th s italicized clause expresses, of course, the postulate of any "philo sophy" of Nature. 38See my Rifts in the Universe (Yale University Press, 1927), pp. 29-31. espace, Time, and Deity, Vol. II, pp. 38-44.</page><page sequence="36">36 THE MONIST fashion to the synthesis of the two in (c) Matter.

Some "stuff" there must be, if Na ture is natural, even if that "stuff" be merely a mathemati cal formula !

Thought regarding bodies inevitably leads, accord ing to the principle of the dialectic, through these stages, which correspond on the whole with the stages in the Encyclopedia; but we are unwilling to follow Hegel fur ther in his consideration of the nature of light, the "four elements," or the bodies of the solar system. Whatever may be the actual process of cosmic evolution, and of the formation of the particular bodies now existent in the uni verse, the general scheme of things outlined above will ap ply; but we cannot forestall the whole of natural science in determining the specific facts. The Differentiation and Interaction of particular Bod ies leads by a strictly logical process to the Idea of Living Organisms as the only real Individuals in Nature, and so to the third stage of Hegel's cosmology-(III) Organics, the</page><page sequence="37">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 37 Individuality and Self-Determinate Being of Nature. In organic things fall short of complete Individuality, this state being attained only in the realm of organic nature, which is the realm of Life. Again, inorganic things are de termined in their activities solely from without; but in or ganisms there is at least an element of self-determination. The distinction between Cosmology and Logic in this field consists in the fact that whereas for Logic, Individuality, Organism, etc., are characterizations of Reality as a whole, in Cosmology, these categories are specifically realized in different parts or aspects of Nature. To define Reality as Individuality or Life, or even Organism, or as anything short of Personality, is an inadequate definition ; to define plants and animals as living individual organisms, how ever, is a perfectly adequate definition. But, as in the Physics, so here, we cannot follow Hegel in his subdivisions, which anticipate the classifications of geology, minerology, and the biological sciences. On the other hand, it is here, if anywhere, rather than in the Logic, that the idea of Sensibility, Assimilation, etc. belongs. An organism is by its very nature bound up with its environ ment, and maintains its own existence only through inter action with that environment. This interaction, further more, is, of course, a twosided one- the organism is af fected by things outside, and in its turn affects what is without.40 The general triad of Organics, therefore, would seem to be somewhat as follows: (A) Receptivity, includ ing under this such empirical biological properties as sen sitiveness to stimulation, ingestion of food, anabolism, etc. ; (B) Reactivity-responsiveness to stimulation, katabol ism, etc.; (C) S elf-Maintenance (including growth as the product of the interaction of the first two). Reproduction, 40These are specific applications in the realms of organic life of the gen eral Notion of Interaction of Bodies in the Physcis.</page><page sequence="38">38 THE MONIST or propogation of the species, is merely an extension of self-maintenance, as the species or "Kind" (Enc. 220) it self is merely an extension of the individual. With the ideas of Self-Maintenance and Self-Deter mination we are on the border of what Hegel calls the Philosophy of Spirit. In his own Cosmology, the transi tion to Spirit is made through the Animal Organism, in which Consciousness first makes its appearance. Strictly speaking, however, as we have contended, philosophical Cosmology is not concerned with the kinds of organisms and other bodies in the universe, but merely with the ideas of Organism, Body, etc. The true transition, therefore, would seem to be via the idea of Self-Determination, which is an essential characteristic of Spirit, but is found in Na ture only in part. So far as man is determined in his ac tivities by external conditions he is a purely natural being ; so far as he is determined from within, he is a spiritual being. ANTHROPOLOGY The third division of Hegel's general philosophical sys tem he calls Philosophy of Mind or Spirit. In our own re vision, however, the term Spirit appears, for reasons al ready stated, as the name of the third division of the Logic. The realm of Hegel's Philosophie des Geistes is that of fin ite human spirits, in whom, according to his general teach ing, the Absolute or Infinite Spirit finds its most complete external manifestation, and through whom the Absolute as Ego 'composits' the Non-Ego with itself. I propose, therefore, that the term "Anthropology," which Hegel em ploys only for the first subsection of this branch of his system, be adopted as the title of the whole. It is in man that Nature passes into Spirit. Anthropology, therefore,</page><page sequence="39">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 39 seems the most appropriate term for the philosophy of fin ite spirit. The three main divisions of the Hegelian system, then, are Logic, Cosmology and Anthropology; dealing respec tively with the Absolute or God, Nature, and Man. The student is much tempted, once having started on the work of revision, to suggest the substitution of "Theology" for "Logic" ; but this would involve such a wrench to Hegel's fundamental teaching that one resists that temptation, though even he has given us some justification for such a change when he tells us that Logic "shows forth God as He is in His eternal essence before the creation of Nature" (G.L., I, 60). The titles which Hegel gives to the three divisions of his Anthropology are highly ambiguous. The terms "Sub jective" and "Objective" are notoriously equivocal, and by "Absolute Spirit" is meant primarily not Absolute Spirit at all, but finite spirit in its ascent to union with Absolute Spirit-though it is true that for Hegel his union of man with the Absolute is also the highest stage in the life of the Absolute itself. As to the translation of "Geist " always a troublesome question for English interpretators of German philosophy, the term "Mind" seems especially appropriate to the first and second stages of the Anthropology, while in the third stage Mind becomes more explicitly "Spirit." I propose, therefore, to entitle the three main divisions of Anthropology (I) Individual Mind, or Psychology; (II) Social Mind, or Sociology; and (III) Spirit, or Pneumatol ogy. In the first of these, Mind is considered in itself, as connected with some individual organism; in the second, Mind is considered as going out of its individuality into relations with other finite minds ; and in the third as return ing to itself in a higher form-that is, the finite as united with the Absolute.</page><page sequence="40">40 THE MONIST The realm of (I) Individual Mind is throughout the realm of Psychology, and it seems unnecessary to restrict the latter term to the third stage of "Subjective Spirit," as does Hegel. This being the first "sphere" after the Cos mology, its three stages are distinguished primarily ac cording to the relations which subsist in each between Mind and Nature, or between Subject and Object. In Hegel's own account, these are entitled Soul, Consciousness, and Mind respectively, and Self-Consciousness appears as a subdivision of Consciousness in general; but to us, as an alysis will attempt to demonstrate, Self-Consciousness is rather to be distinguished from ordinary or external Con sciousness as the third or synthetic stage of Individual Mind. The three stages will then be denominated (A) Sentience, (B) Consciousness, and (C) S elf-Conscious ness. (A) Sentience is the stage in which Mind has not yet become separated from Nature, and the distinction be tween Subject and Object which characterizes Conscious ness has not yet arisen-i.e., Mind is still merely Soid, in the original sense of that term. Soul is considered ( i ) as it is in itself, in its undifferentiated universality-the Soul as Such (Hegel's "Natural Soul") ; (2) as distinguishing various Feelings within itself, the particularization of Soul (Hegel's "Feeling Soul"); and (3) in its Actuality, as uniting its Feelings with itself (Hegel's "Actual Soul"). In the stage of Sentience; the Feelings of the Soul are literally and merely "contents" of and zvithin the Soul it self. In (B) Consciousness there is a distinction between the Mind as Subject and a realm of external "objects" Mind, in other words, is now Explicit, not merely implicit as Soul. In Hegel's analysis, "Consciousness Proper" is taken as cognitive or theoretical only, and the distinction</page><page sequence="41">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 41 of theoretical and practical, which in the Logic appears un der the category of "Cognition," is here postponed to the third division of Subjective Spirit. This involves some du plications and repetitions in the subdivisions of "Conscious ness Proper" (Sub-Section B.(a)) and "Psychology Mind" (Sub-Section C), and an artificial separation be tween the contents of these two subsections. Properly speaking, it would seem, the distinction of theoretical and practical belongs in the realm of Consciousness itself. This would result in the following analysis : (I) Theoretical Consciousness, or Cognition, in which Mind is determined by Nature, presents as its three stages : (a) Sensibility, the consciousness of particulars (Percep tual Knowledge) ; (b) Understanding, the consciousness of universals regarded as opposed to particulars (Concep tual Knowledge) ; and (c) Reason, the consciousness of the universal in the particulars-i.e., of individuals (Ra tional Knowledge). These constitute the familiar three theoretical "faculties" of the Kantian psychology, with the Hegelian interpretation of "Understanding" and "Rea son." Sensibility may also be further subdivided into (i) Intuition, or immediate apprehension, in which the distinc tion of subject and object characteristic of Consciousness is still merely implicit; (ii) the Datum directly presented to the mind by the object; and (iii) Sense-Perception, in which, through the union of Intuition and Datum, there is explicit knowledge of external physical objects. Similarly, Understanding may be subdivided into (i) Imagery, the re turn of intuitions in the form of representations; (ii) Mem ory, the explicit recognition of imagery as based upon pre vious actual experience of objects; and (iii) Conception, or the formation of universal ideas through the suppression of particular images. It will be recognized that these various divisions and subdivisions of Theoretical Consciousness</page><page sequence="42">42 THE MONIST correspond in condensed fashion to Hegel's own divisions in Sub-Section B (a) and Sub-Section C of his "Subjective Spirit," at the same time eliminating the duplications and repetitions which mar the philosopher's analysis. (2) Practical Consciousness1 or Conation, in which Mind rises above Nature and (at least partially) determines it, has for its three stages: (a) Impulse-Mind seeking satisfaction immediately, in this or that particular object or act; (b) Choice-Mind as universal, setting over against itself a multiplicity of particular impulses, and selecting among them; and (c) Rational Will-Mind identifying itself with the chosen motive, and realizing itself through the same. In Rational Will, the union of Reason and Will, Mind at tains Freedom, self-determination, and, therefore, Person ality. The synthesis may, then, be denominated (3) The Ego as Subject of Consciousness, the unitary ground of theoretical and practical consciousness. In Sentience, Subject and Object have not yet been dis tinguished; in Consciousness, they are opposed to one an other-Mind is Subject, Nature is Object; in (C) Self consciousness, Subject and Object have again become one, an Identity-in-Difference-Mind is both Subject and Ob ject, and yet the distinction between the two aspects is maintained. The three moments of Self-Consciousness are : (1) Individual S elf-Consciousness-the awareness of the individual self as an isolated unit; (2) Other-Self Con sciousness-the awareness of other selves as "other," as isolated units like oneself but alien; (3) Universal Self Consciousness-the awareness of oneself as one of many interrelated selves, the recognition of one's own selfhood in all selves and yet of a distinction between oneself and other selves. In this final stage only is Love possible, that which binds many selves together in a larger unity; and</page><page sequence="43">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 43 with this stage we have reached the highest level of Indi vidual Mind, and find ourselves passing over inevitably into the world of Society. (II) Social Mind, which constitutes the content of the science of Sociology, is the realm in which Individual Mind objectifies itself and so realizes its Freedom. Freedom, however, can be realized only through the instrumentality of its opposite-Necessity. Hence the world of Nature or Necessity gives the materials from which Mind in its free dom creates a new mental w7orld, a world of Instit itt ions, as a field for its own operations. Hegel's philosophy of Objective Spirit exemplifies bet ter perhaps than any other part of his entire system the essential character of his method. It will, therefore, appear in our revision almost unchanged. The first two stages re present the interactions of minds in Society in purely ex ternal and internal, and so equally onesided, terms respec tively ; in the third stage, these two sides are united. In the first stage, (A) Society is thought of as a mere aggregate of isolated units, each being concerned solely in the de fense and promotion of his individual Rights as a person, and being controlled in his activities only by external com pulsion; it is the realm of Legality rather than of morality, of Heteronomy rather than autonomy. Morality proper first appears in the second stage as (B) the Morality of Conscience. Society is still regarded as an aggregate of isolated units, but each of these is now governed in his con duct by the inner sense of obligation or Duty, of "Right" rather than "Rights." Rights and Duties, taken by them selves, however, are equally abstract and one-sided; and the "truth" of morality is to be found in the correlativity of these as exemplified in (C) the Institutions of Social Morality. In the first two stages, Society, we repeat, is</page><page sequence="44">44 THE MONIST a mere aggregate of isolated units-there are as yet no Institutions, but merely the abstract elements out of which Institutions are composed; in the third stage, Society ap pears as a higher unity of which individuals are "mem bers," a "whole" rather than a collection. Social Institutions are grouped by Hegel, according to his fundamental doctrine, under three heads: the Family, Civil Society, and the State. ( i ) The Family is naturally the primary or thetic Institution, because based upon the most immediate of all ties, that of Sexual Love; though as an ethical institution, the only true bond of family unity is a rational, not merely a romantic or a physical, Love. In marriage, two individuals of opposite sexes renounce their independent personalities to become one person, a unity which manifests itself objectively in the offspring. The three elements of the Family, therefore, are (a) the Husband, (b) the Wife, and (c) the Child. This is an al most painfully obvious analysis, but is after all an unusual ly clear exemplification of the Hegelian principle, and so would seem to find in its obviousness confirmation rather than condemnation. Hegel's analysis as developed in his Philosophy of Right seems to represent a considerable dis tortion of relative values; there appears to be no rational justification, for example, for treating Family Property as a distinct phase of the Family as an Institution, or as more than a specific example of Property in general. With the adolescence of the Child, however, as Hegel rightly insists, the original unity of the family begins to dissolve, and the Child becomes an independent person, having been pre pared for that new status by the process of education. (2)Civil Society should not be characterized, as Hegel characterizes it, as an atomistic state of things, since this view of the social relation was transcended once for all in</page><page sequence="45">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 45 the passage from Inner to Social Morality. As Hegel him self goes on to show, though each individual in Civil So ciety is seeking his own ends only, and using Society mere ly as a means to the realization of those ends, nevertheless there is even at this stage a recognition of the mutual in terdependence of all the "members" of the social entity, and in gaining his own ends each member also helps to pro mote the ends of the community. Civil Society, therefore, is simply Society as a system of many distinct, coordinate, and more or less independent Institutions of varying de grees of unity, but all possessing some degree of such unity through the bond of some Common Interest-physical need, friendship, educational advantage, or what not. Un der it would be included such Institutions as the school, various business organizations, "society" in the popular sense of that term, etc. (3) The State is for Hegel the supreme Social Insti tution. In the Family, the members sacrifice their individ ual ends entirely to those of the Institution; in Civil So ciety, the Institution is merely a means for the realization of the ends of the members ; in the State, ideally considered, there is a complete synthesis of individual and institutional ends. The State is an end in itself, but not apart from its individual members; rather, the individual finds the most complete satisfaction of his own interests in the identifica tion of them with those of the State. As thus uniting so perfectly the elements of universality as exclusively re presented by the Family, and of particularity as exclusively represented in Civil Society, the State is a true Individual -an Individual of individuals, whose members are bound by a tie most comparable to that which even more closely binds the Family-namely, the tie of Patriotism, or Civic Love.</page><page sequence="46">46 THE MONIST The three moments in the philosophy of the State are : (a) the National State-the State as geographically and racially limited; (b) Internationalism-the State as one among many, retaining its independent "sovereignty," but recognizing its interdependence with all other States; (c) The World-State-humanity organized as a political unit, in which the various National States are "members." In the second stage, the relations between the various Na tions are analogous to those between individuals in Civil Society ; in the third stage, the relations are analogous to those between individuals in the Nation-the Nation's in dividuality and "inner freedom" are not lost, but its in dependent sovereignty is sacrificed to that of the World State. In Hegel's own description, this third stage appears as "Universal History'' thus introducing illegitimately the time-element into what is otherwise a purely logical analysis. Certainly, the world has a history; but so has every Nation, every Family, every Individual, and every thing else, and there seems no logical reason for introduc ing the idea of History at this particular place, and re stricting it thereto. The sentiment of Patriotism, as we have noted, binds together the members of every National State. When re stricted to one particular Nation to the exclusion of all others, this excellent and entirely rational sentiment be comes the dangerous hate-breeding sentiment of National ism; when extended to cover all mankind in the World State, it becomes the all-inclusive sentiment of Humani tarianism, with which national Patriotism is entirely com patible, but which refuses to be bound in any exclusive way by geographical and racial limitations. As family loyalty does not necessarily involve enmity to other fami lies, so national loyalty is in every way compatible with a</page><page sequence="47">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 4/ broader even if less ardent loyalty to the World-State. With this stage, however, we have attained the final step in the development of Social Mind. Beyond Humanity we cannot go without passing into a supersocial or superhu man realm-the realm of Spirit. (III) If we are to follow the plan which Hegel has laid down, though we have deviated from him in so many particular points, we may associate with Spirit the ancient science of Pneumatology. Finite Spirit is the return of Mind to its source in Absolute Spirit, and so ultimately the return of Absolute Spirit to itself. The Individual and Social Minds limit each other, and so are both of them finite. As Spirit, Mind transcends its finitude and becomes one with the Absolute. As Spirit, again, Man has transcended not only Nature, but also his fellow-man, and in so doing becomes for the first time ivholly Free. This return of Finite to Absolute Spirit is the End and goal of the entire world-process-the 'composi tion' of Absolute Ego and Non-Ego, of the Absolute and Nature, for which all previous stages are but preparatory. The process of uniting the Finite with the Infinite is, in the broad sense of that term, as Hegel himself admits (Enc. 554), Religion. This process, however, attains its goal in three different and successively more and more adequate ways, which in Hegel's analysis are denominated Art, Revealed Religion, and Philosophy respectively. Whether this arrangement of the final triad of Hegel's system is the correct one, even from the general standpoint of its author, has been much discussed, and must be care fully considered by us before we close. That Art constitutes the first and thetic method of the return of Spirit to the Absolute is a position with which we can have no serious controversy. Art is the "moment</page><page sequence="48">THE MONIST of immediacy" in this sphere, since in Art the Absolute appears to Finite Spirit in the form of Sensibility, which is the least adequate form of Consciousness. In Nature it self Man finds the Absolute under the sensuous form of Beauty; in Art, Man creates a realm of Beauty which sets before the world of man his own immediate experiences of the Absolute as revealed in Nature. It is around the question of the relative adequacy of Revealed Religion and Philosophy as modes of union with the Absolute that most of the discussion in this general sphere has centred. As Hegel puts it, Art is defective be cause, though the Absolute is in reality pure universal Spirit, in Art the Absolute appears in the form of particu lar sense-objects; but the essence of Spirit being Thought, not Sensibility, the only adequate apprehension of the Ab solute will be the apprehension of it as Pure Thought; and this is attained, according to Hegel, only in Philosophy. Philosophy, therefore, is the highest, synthetic, and only adequate mode of what in the broadest sense of the term is called Religion; and in Philosophy, finally, the Abso lute comes to itself. Between Art and Philosophy, how ever, there is an intermediate realm, that of the historic religions, in which the Absolute is manifested to men in the form of mental images (cf. Enc. 451), which stand in between sense-objects on the one hand and the Notions or ideas of Reason on the other. Only philosophers can know the Absolute as it is; for the ordinary run of man kind the historic religions must suffice, since imagination is the highest faculty by which they are capable of attain ing any knowledge of the truth. Again, whereas in Art, man and the Absolute are in immediate union, though on a low and inadequate level; in Religion, man and the Ab solute are thought of as sundered from one another, though</page><page sequence="49">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 49 yearning for a union which can be attained adequately only in Philosophy. In other words, Art reveals the Ab solute to man in finite form; Revealed Religion presents the Absolute as infinite, but infinitely removed from finite man; Philosophy reveals the ultimate unity of finite and infinite, and is therefore truly the synthesis of Art and Re ligion. McTaggart has devoted the sixth chapter of his Stud ies in Hegelian Dialectic to a refutation of this position. "There is some difference/' he succinctly puts it (p. 201), "between holding that philosophy is the knowledge of the highest form ot reality, and holding that it is itself the highest form of reality" (italics mine). Philosophy is merely knowledge. Reality must, however, if Reality is Spirit, include action and feeling as well as knowledge. Both Art and Religion, indeed, which for Hegel are lower forms of Spirit than Philosophy, include elements of action (the creation of works of art, religious worship) and feel ing (aesthetic and religious emotion) as well as of knowl edge, and are therefore in some senses more adequate re presentations of Reality than Philosophy, which is purely cognition. But Hegel himself treats both Religion and Art as forms of knowledge only, ignoring these other ele ments. For Hegel, indeed, "the supreme nature of Spirit [is] to be expressed as knowledge, and as knowledge only" ; but on various grounds, McTaggart shows, knowl edge is totally unfitted by itself to represent adequately the total and diverse nature of Reality. "We must there fore/' he concludes (p. 223), "look for the ultimate nature of Spirit in something which transcends and surpasses cog nition, including it as a moment, but transforming it and raising it into a higher sphere, where its imperfections vanish."</page><page sequence="50">5o THE MONIST A similar situation arose in our consideration of the category of Consciousness in the Logic. Neither Cogni tion nor Volition, we there saw, is in itself sufficient, nor are both together sufficient, as descriptions of the total nature of Mind ; but a synthesis wras found in the element of Feeling, exemplified by Love. So here, any adequate de scription of Spirit must include all three of these ele ments.41 As McTaggart sees the situation (op. cit. pp. 226-229), Philosophy, far from being the synthesis of Art and Re ligion, rather constitutes, together with Religion, the anti thesis of the final triad, and the synthesis is still to be sought beyond all of these. "All the stages in this triad of Abso lute Spirit/' says our critic (op. cit., pp. 220f.), "are oc cupied in endeavoring to find a harmony between the in dividual spirit.... on the one hand, and the rest of the uni verse on the other. Such a harmony is directly and im mediately presented" to us in Art under the form of Beauty. But a merely "immediate" harmony can never be anything but superficial, contingent, and therefore defec tive ; for complete satisfaction "it is necessary to find some ground of harmony which is universal," rational, and necessary. Both Religion and Philosophy, McTaggart con tends, produce, with differing degrees of rational assur ance, just the "ground of harmony" needed, in that both go deeper than the surface and reveal the required har mony as inherent in the inner nature of things. But not even yet have we attained a real synthesis, since that would require a harmony which is both "direct and immediate on the one hand, and universal and necessary on the other. Art gives the first and Philosophy the second, but Philoso 41 McTaggart returns to this matter in the chapter of his Studies in Hegel ian Dialectic already cited. Cf. also the final note in his Studies in Hegelian Cosmology, quoted above, note 27.</page><page sequence="51">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 5 I phy can no more unite the two than Art can" (op. cit., p. 228). The synthesis, in other words, "must be as direct as art, as certain and universal as philosophy" (p. 229). But as to where that synthesis is actually to be found, Mc Taggart refuses to say. It is therefore incumbent upon us to continue the search. We may agree with McTaggart, I think, in holding that Philosophy belongs to the antithesis of the final triad. Art is thesis because of its simple immediacy, Philosophy is antithesis (or a part of the antithesis) because of its mediacy, and the synthesis must unite these two moments. As to Knowledge, Feeling and Will, all of which must be included in the final synthesis, it can hardly be doubted that Feeling reaches its highest manifestation in the realm of Art and Beauty, Knowledge in Philosophy, and Will in the now transcended realm of Morality. But what of Re ligion? Is it, as Hegel would have us think, and as Mc Taggart's description would also lead us to conclude, mere ly a form of Knowledge of a lower degree than Philoso phy ?- Is it not in Religion at its best that the final synthe sis is to be found, and does not Religion at its best most adequately satisfy McTaggart's criterion that "the highest stage of spirit would have to include, not only the percep tion of the rationality of all things, which is oflfered by philosophy, but also the complete acquiescence which is the goal of successful volition, and the pleasure which is the inevitable result of conscious harmony"? Philosophy may attempt to demonstrate for us "the rationality of all things," but in Religion there is the direct acceptance of this rationality; Morality may set before us "the goal of successful volition," but Religion alone can produce in us "complete acquiescence" in the goal (my italics) ; Art may bring us the most exalted pleasure that is possible in the</page><page sequence="52">52 THE MONIST realm of the senses, but only Religion can bring the bles sedness which transcends the pleasures of the senses. In Art, again, we have the realization by man of the ideal of Beauty, and the most complete satisfaction of his emotional nature; in Morality we have man's realization of the ideal of Goodness, and the most complete satisfaction of his vo litional nature; in Philosophy (including the sciences) we have man's realization of the ideal of Truth, and the most complete satisfaction of his intellectual nature; but the final harmonization of all his ideals man finds in Religion, which alone brings complete satisfaction to all sides of his nature, and constitutes, therefore, the required synthesis of our final triad. Completing our reconsideration of the Hegelian Forms, then, after our long critical digression, we formulate our final triad as follows.-(A) Art constitutes the thesis of the triad, the manifestation of ultimate Reality to man through Feeling under the sensuous form of Beauty. As a general name for the antithesis I shall suggest the word (B) Science rather than Philosophy, on the twofold ground that it is a more inclusive term for the pure Knowl edge (scientia) aspect of Spirit, and that in employing this term we shall run less risk of confusion than if we should adopt for the antithesis of our final triad the same word that Hegel uses for the synthesis. Truth, of course, is the direct object of Science in all its varieties, the Absolute be ing manifested to the truth-seeker in purely intellectual form, as opposed to the purely sensuous form of Beauty; it is, therefore, the true antithesis of Beauty. Knowledge, however, as we saw in our analysis of Theoretical Con sciousness, is of three grades : ( i ) perceptual knowledge or the knowledge of Common Sense (Science Implicit), de</page><page sequence="53">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 53 rived through the senses; 42 (2) conceptual knowledge, or the knowledge of the Empirical Sciences, derived through the Understanding; and (3) rational knowledge, or the knowledge of Philosophy, attained through Reason. These three capitalized terms, therefore, may be taken to repre sent the three subordinate moments of the larger an tithesis. Finally, (C) Religion is the long-sought-for synthesis of the closing triad, and so the consummation of the entire Anthropology. God Himself, the Absolute Spirit and the Supreme Good of man, is, of course, the direct and central Object of Religion. In our defense of this solution of the problem of the final synthesis, we have twice asserted that it is only "Religion at its best39 which meets the necessary conditions. In its earlier forms, Religion is quite unworthy of that exalted rank; and yet, in all important forms of Religion, we find as their dominating goal the reunion of man with the Source from which he has become alienated -and this is the essence, after all, of the Hegelian doc trine. This reunion is brought about in three ways : ( 1 ) through Revelation of the Truth of God; (2) through Sanctification by the Grace of God; and (3) through Wor ship, as the manifestation of man's Love for God in re sponse to this twofold gift of God to man. In these three phases of Religion respectively the intellectual, rational, and emotional aspects of man's nature attain their most complete satisfaction; and in the union of all three, the final goal of life is attained. Those who would follow Hegel must reconcile them selves to a long journey. Nothing short of completeness would satisfy him, and nothing short of completeness can 42Art is a matter of Feeling, and so corresponds in the Individual Mind to the level of Soul; Common Sense is Knowledge derived from the senses, and so belongs to a higher level-but in both cases, the object is a sensuous rather than a conceptual one.</page><page sequence="54">54 THE MONIST satisfy the true philosopher. Granting the panlogistic and monistic premises of Hegel's philosophy, to avoid being carried too far afield in our criticisms, I suppose his grav est defect consists in what we may call his anthropomorphic egoism-the assumption which seems to lie behind almost everything he wrote that the human reasoning of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was identical with the Absolute Reason. The thought seems never to have occurred to him that even if all that is real is rational, some of his own rea sonings might be far from real-if he did have an inkling of this possibility, he seems, like his interpreter, J. Hutchin son Stirling, to have kept the secret to himself. That the entire history of philosophy should attain its final syn thesis, and therefore its impregnable consummation, in the Hegelian system itself, strikes his most ardent admirers as a ridiculous, if not tragically misguided, contention. And if no finality can justifiably be attributed to Hegel's own teachings, certainly none can be claimed for the revisions of those teachings which any temerarious student of his writings may suggest. All such a student can pretend to claim is that he is trying to make somewhat clearer the fundamental ideas of a profound but unwontedly obscure master of thought. This humble student, then, can think of no words more fitting with which to close his long critique than those of another student whose philosophical genius was vastly more worthy of the object of his study, J. E. McTaggart, who concludes his Commentary on Hegel's Logic with the expression of his conviction that, notwithstanding Hegel's many defects, he "has penetrated further into the true nature of reality than any philosopher before or after him."</page><page sequence="55">A RECONSIDERATION OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS 55 TABULAR VIEW OF THE HEGELIAN FORMS LOGIC I.
